Interface to Geophile to implement Z-order geospatial index and spatial joins.

<p>
A geospatial index stores 1-D Z-order values for 2-D points / shapes.
Such an index can be joined with another index or a constant shape using a special spatial
join algorithm.
</p>

<p>
For example, given an index on two numeric fields of a record type representing a location
as latitude and longitude, a query can return all the records whose location is within some
distance of given point. The join part of this execution is allowed to return more records
than actually match, so, in general, there is a runtime check of the predicate even after
the index scan.
