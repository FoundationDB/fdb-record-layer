# Following tests are executed in order as the index used depends on which query warms up the cache. In this particular
# scenario, the first query puts the plan in cache, which cannot be used by second query that would use the one with
# index I2. However, if second query is executed first and puts the plan with index I2 in the cache, the other queries
# can use the same.
