# This document type creates a map of transaction setups that can be referenced in individual queries
# This helps to reduce duplication.
# The map is basically from a name (e.g. t1_less_than_50) to a statement to run at the start of every query.
# They're referenced in the query using `setupReference`. Right now it only supports a single statement as a string, but
# it could be expanded to support an array in the future.
