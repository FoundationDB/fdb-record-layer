# This tests a single include block in the yaml file, and hence is 'similar' to simple-include.yamsql in that
# perspective. However, it has a different schema template than the other file, by means of having more index which
# means that the metrics would be different for the same queries that run in the other file.

schema_template:
    create table t1(id bigint, col1 bigint, primary key(id))
    create index i1 as select * from t1 where col1 > 1000 order by id
    create index i2 as select * from t1 where id = 0 order by col1
    create index i3 as select * from t1 where col1 > 50 and id < 53434 order by col1
