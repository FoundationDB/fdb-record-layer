# This test suite runs multiple tests that verify the effects of successfully extracting
# `null` values and integrating them into the query's evaluation context, ensuring they

# With constant folding enabled, the condition in parentheses gets optimized away, allowing
# the optimizer to use an efficient index scan. Without constant folding, the optimizer
# retains the remaining predicate (b1 < 20) and must fall back to a less efficient covering
# scan or potentially worse execution strategy.

# This query contains two `null` values, creating an equality constraint that handles `null`
# comparisons with proper semantics. The constraint correctly evaluates equality for both
# `null` and non-`null` objects. After the initial query execution stores the plan in cache,
# subsequent runs of the same query will reuse the cached plan since the equality constraint
# is satisfied when both arguments are `null`.
