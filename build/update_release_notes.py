#
# Utility script for updating the release notes as part of a release.
#
# The release notes for the Record Layer should generally be updated as
# features are added. However, as the build number is not known until the
# actual release is cut, the release notes generally include only a reference
# to the NEXT_RELEASE. This script should then be run as soon as the release
# version is known. It updates the release notes file and replaces the
# information for the "next release" with the actual release version and cleans
# up some cruft that is included in the (not yet updated) release section.
# It also adds a fresh version of the release notes template directly above
# where the new release notes have been added in preparation for the following
# release.
#
