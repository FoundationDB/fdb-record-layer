# Download and write the package-lists file for Javadoc generation. These
# files are used during the Javadoc creation process to produce external links
# to Java classes living outside the main project. Storing these files allows
# the project to have offline builds, though it also means that these files
# should be regenerated every so often in order to keep them from getting
# stale. This script automates that process.
#
# Usage:
#   python3 genpackagelists.py
#
# Requires: requests
