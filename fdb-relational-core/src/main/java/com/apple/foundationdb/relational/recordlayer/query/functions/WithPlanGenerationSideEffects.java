 Trait used by functions with plan generation side effects. Currently, functions can only have side effects of providing
 extra {@link com.apple.foundationdb.relational.recordlayer.query.OrderedLiteral}s that fix the state of the generated
 plan, saving it for subsequent expansion of the function. It is important check if a function has literals during plan
 generation. If so, combine them with the queryâ€™s literals.
