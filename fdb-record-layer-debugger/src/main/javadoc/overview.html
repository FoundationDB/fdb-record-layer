Implementations for specific planner debuggers (in particular the repl debugger for the planner). The Debugger interface
provides a hook mechanism which is used by planner logic to inform a debugger implementation about events that occur
during the planning of a query. The planner repl allows a developer to set breakpoints, step through planner rules,
introspect expressions, references and other objects as well as to show planner graphs of during planning.
