  # Three parallel jobs:
  #  1. style: Runs all checks on the build (including compilation static analysis) except the tests
  #     This allows us to catch anything related to build and style faster, as we don't have to wait
  #     on tests to complete. It also allows the test jobs to continue even if there's a style failure.
  #  2. core-tests: Runs the fdb-record-layer-core tests. This is the longest test suite of the
  #     various subprojects, so separating it out allows us to speed up the PRB time.
  #  3. other-tests: Runs the rest of the tests. This tests everything else
