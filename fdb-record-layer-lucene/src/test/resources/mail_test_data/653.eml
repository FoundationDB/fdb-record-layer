Designed for the Original Instruction of Colored People._ Bishop Meade was =
once engaged in=20

collecting such literature addressed particularly to slaves in their statio=
ns. These extracts were to=20

be read to them on proper occasions by any member of the family.[1]  [Footn=
ote 1: Meade,=20

_Sermons of Rev. Thomas Bacon_, p. 2.]  Yet on the whole it can be safely s=
tated that there were=20

few societies formed in the South to give the Negroes religious and moral i=
nstruction. Only a few=20

missionaries were exclusively devoted to work among them. In fact, after th=
e reactionary period no=20

propaganda of any southern church included anything which could be designat=
ed as systematic=20

instruction of the Negroes.[1] Even owners, who took care to feed, clothe, =
and lodge their slaves=20

well and treated them humanely, often neglected to do anything to enlighten=
 their understanding=20

as to their responsibility to God. [Footnote 1: Madison's Works, vol. in., =
p. 314; Olmsted, _Back=20

Country_, p. 107; Birney, _The American Churches_, etc., p. 6; and Jones, _=
Religious=20

Instruction_, etc., p. 100.]  Observing closely these conditions one would =
wonder little that many=20

Negroes became low and degraded. The very institution of slavery itself pro=
duced shiftless,=20

undependable beings, seeking relief whenever possible by giving the least a=
nd getting the most=20

from their masters. When the slaves were cut off from the light of the gosp=
el by the large=20

plantation   A ship passing by, as if it was plann'd,   Carried him off mid=
 the darkness of night.   He=20

was up to the neck in debts and scrapes;   And when the west wind refreshin=
gly blew,   He thought=20

it the pleasantest of escapes   To sail for new worlds with nothing to do. =
  Strolling and idling by=20

day and by night,   He liv'd by his wits, with a laugh for fate;   And his =
wits not being extremely=20

bright,   He accomplish'd nothing remarkably great.    Wandering ev'rywhere=
, ragged and poor,=20

With nothing to do and plenty to say,   By the merest chance he enter'd our=
 door   To ask for a=20

meal and a bed by the way.    So the three of us met delighted there,   And=
 set sail together that=20

perfect spring,   When the skies were fine and the winds were fair,   And o=
ur hearts were lighter=20

than anything.    From the midst of the sea the white cliffs rise--   The s=
nowy white cliffs of the=20

ocean gem!   And they smile their welcome into our eyes   As Harry and I sm=
ile it back on them.=20

Standing together alone on the deck,   With a hope that almost becomes a fe=
ar,   We can watch=20

that wonderful little speck   Grow into places unspeakably dear.    Is it y=
ears or days since we=20

sail'd away?   And are we returning the self-same track?   Did we cross the=
 ocean but yesterday?=20

And is it to-day we are coming back?    Back to the home whence he vanish'd=
 that night,   In=20

through the hall where I talk'd with the men,--   Can it be true that=20
