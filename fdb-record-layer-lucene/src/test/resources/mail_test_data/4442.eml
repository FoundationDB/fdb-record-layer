colours, when the distant, shadowy mountains became real. Liberty ran riot within her. If he 

thought with loathing on his former life, so did she. Only a year ago she had been penned up in a 

New York street in that prison-house of her own making, hemmed in by surroundings which she 

had now learned to detest from her soul.  A few more penalties remained to be paid, and the 

heaviest of these was her letter to her aunt and uncle. Even as they had accepted other things in 

life, so had they accepted the hardest of all to bear--Honora's divorce. A memorable letter her 

Uncle Tom had written her after Peter's return to tell them that remonstrances were useless! She 

was their daughter in all but name, and they would not forsake her. When she should have 

obtained her divorce, she should go back to them. Their house, which had been her home, should 

always remain so. Honora wept and pondered long exhibited a reluctance to reply, and said he 

was sorry he had let the words slip. He was, however, pressed to explain, and he then said that 

the deceased was made very unhappy by the want of affection shown to him by his daughter. 

"The Juryman: 'Was he kind to his daughter?'--'Very kind.'  "'Was there any disagreement between 

them?'--'There was continual disagreement; but it was not my master's fault. He did all he could to 

please her.'  "'Do you know the cause of this disagreement?'--'It was partly about money.'  "'That 

she asked for, and that he would not give?'--'Yes.'  "'But you said he was very kind to her. The 

deceased was a man of means. Why should he refuse to give his daughter money?'--'From what 

my master said to me at different times, it was because she demanded sums of money for 

purposes of which he did not approve. He was exceedingly liberal to her where she herself was

over that letter. Should she write and tell them the truth, as she had told Peter? It was not because 

she was ashamed of the truth that she had kept it from them throughout the winter: it was because 

she wished to spare them as long as possible. Cruellest circumstance of all, that a love so divine 

as hers should not be understood by them, and given to persons who hated him.'  "'To what 

persons do you refer?'--'To her relatives in London--the only relatives she has.'  "'What is the 

name of these relatives?'--'Lethbridge. They live in Camden Town.'  "'And Miss Farebrother 

wanted money for them?'--'According to what my master said, she was always wanting money for 

them.'  "'Was she in

them infinite pain!  The weeks and months slipped by. Their letters, after that first one, were such 

as she had always received from them: accounts of the weather, and of the doings of her friends 

at home. But now the time was at hand when she must prepare them for her marriage with 

Chiltern; for they would expect her in St. Louis, and she could not go there. And if she wrote them, 

they might try to stop the marriage, or at least to delay it for some years.  Was it possible that a 

lingering doubt remained in her mind that to postpone her happiness would perhaps be to lose it? 

In her exile she had learned enough to know that a divorced woman is like a rudderless ship at 

sea, at the mercy of wind and wave and current. She could not go back to her life in St. Louis: her 

situation  "'With the consent of the deceased?'--'Against his consent. He frequently remonstrated 

with her for paying long visits to persons who bore him such ill-will.'  "'In spite of these 

remonstrances she continued to visit them?'--'Yes.'  "'Mention has been made of a man who was 

in the habit of visiting the deceased in his home at Parksides late at night. Do you know anything 

of him?'--'Nothing, except what my mother has told me and has told you.'  "'Did he not visit the 

office in London?'--'No. I never saw him.'  "'Did no conversation ever pass between you and the 

deceased respecting him?'--'None.'  "'Then you do not know upon what business he came?'--'No; 

but it could not have been upon the affairs of the London business, or I should have heard it.'
