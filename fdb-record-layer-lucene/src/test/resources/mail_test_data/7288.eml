 not a medicine-man.  He cannot be in two places at once. He knows nothing.=
"  For a sly man La Certe was wonderfully _
resting with such kindliness upon his stricken friend. "Go home, Tony!" he =
added, "go, you rascal,=20

and collect what things you want, while I send for Hastings and Ffoulkes, a=
nd see that four good=20

horses are ready for us within the hour. To-night we sleep at Portishead, T=
ony. The _Day-Dream_=20

is lying off there, ready to sail at any hour of the day or night. The _Hol=
landia_ has twenty-four=20

hour's start of us, alas! and we cannot overtake her now: but we'll be in N=
antes ere those devils=20

can do much mischief: and once in Nantes!... Why, Tony man! think of the gl=
orious escapes we've=20

had together, you and I! Think of the gay, mad rides across the north of Fr=
ance, with half-fainting=20

women and swooning children across our saddle-bows! Think of the day when w=
e smuggled the=20

de Tournais out of Calais harbour, the day we snatched Juliette Deroulede a=
nd her Paul out of the=20

tumbril and tore across Paris with that howling mob at our heels! Think! th=
ink, Tony! of all the=20

happiest, merriest moments of your life and they will seem dull and lifeles=
s beside what is in store=20

for you, when with your dear wife's arms clinging round your neck, we'll fl=
y along the quays of=20

Nantes on the road to liberty! Ah, Tony lad! were it not for the anxiety wh=
ich I know is gnawing at=20

your heart, I would count this one of the happiest hours of my happy life!"=
  He was so full of=20

enthusiasm, so full of vitality, that life itself seemed to emanate from hi=
m and to communicate itself=20

to the very atmosphere around. Hope lit up my lord Tony's wan face: he beli=
eved in his friend as=20

mediaeval ascetics believed in the saints whom they adored. Enthusiasm had =
crept into his veins,=20

dull despair fell away from him like a mantle.  "God bless you, Percy," he =
exclaimed as his firm=20

and loyal hand grasped that of the leader whom he revered.  "Nay!" retorted=
 Blakeney with sudden=20

gravity. "He hath done that already. Pray for His help to-day, lad, as you =
have never prayed=20

before."     CHAPTER VII  MARGUERITE   I  Lord Tony had gone, and for the s=
pace of five=20

minutes Sir Percy Blakeney stood in front of the hearth staring into the fi=
re. Something lay before=20

him, something had to be done now, which represented the heavy price that h=
ad to be paid for=20

those mad and happy adventures, for that reckless daring, aye for that self=
less supreme sacrifice=20

which was as the very breath of life to the Scarlet Pimpernel.  And in the =
dancing flames he could=20

see Marguerite's blue eyes, her ardent hair, her tender smile all pleading =
with him not to go. She=20

had so much to give him--so much happiness, such an infinity of love, and h=
e was all that she had=20

in the world! It seemed to him as if he could feel her arms around him even=
 now, as if he could=20

hear her voice whispering appealingly: "Do not go! Am I nothing to you that=
 thoughts of others=20

should triumph over my pleading? that the need of others should outweigh mi=
ne own most=20

pressing need? I want you, Percy! aye! even I! You have done so much for ot=
hers--it is my turn=20

now."  But even as in a kind of trance those words seemed to reach his stra=
ined senses, he knew=20

that he must go, that he must tear himself away once more from the clinging=
 embrace of her dear=20

arms and shut his eyes to the tears which anon would fill her own. Destiny =
demanded that he=20

should go. He had chosen his path in life himself, are not your two ears, a=
nd that you heard=20

nothing that you could understand."  "Fery true, Dechamp.  But the language=
 of the eye is=20

sometimes as clear and understandable as the language of the ear.  No wan c=
ould mistake the=20

meanin' o' some o' the warriors when they scowled an' pointed in the direct=
ion of our camp here,=20

an' gripped the handles o' their scalpin' knives and tomahawks.  Moreover, =
Okematan also pointed=20

in the same direction, though I am bound to say he did not grip his knife. =
 Whether he scowled or=20

not I do not know, for he was standin' wi' his back to us."  "Well, I canno=
t tell.  I'm not willin' to=20

believe Okematan a traitor; but what you have seen is enough to make me put=
 the camp in=20



defence instead of startin' out to hunt--"  At that moment the sharp click =
of a gun was heard as a=20

neighbouring sentry put his piece on full cock.  Dechamp and Fergus hastene=
d towards him.=20

"Have a care, Andre; don't be too quick with your gun," said the former. "I=
 see only one man=20

coming.  He can do us no harm."  As the approaching figure drew near, it wa=
s seen to be that of=20

an Indian on horseback.  He rode carelessly at a jog-trot.  "It looks like =
Okematan!" said Dechamp,=20

glancing at his companion in surprise.  "It iss Okematan," returned Fergus.=
  Before another word=20

could be spoken, a shot was heard in the camp, and horse and man were seen =
to roll upon the=20

ground.  The latter rose immediately, but the horse lay stiff--evidently sh=
ot dead.  For a few=20

seconds profound silence followed the incident, as if men were too much tak=
en by surprise to think=20

and act.  Then, when the dismounted Indian was seen to walk leisurely, as i=
f unhurt, towards=20

them, there was a hubbub in the camp, while men, women, and boys ran toward=
s the spot whence=20

the shot seemed to have been fired, but no one was to be found there.  Only=
 a very faint puff of=20

smoke overhead told where the marksman had stood.  It had been a well-chose=
n spot, where a=20

low bush or two mingled with several carts that had been rather carelessly =
drawn up, and several=20

horses had been picketed together.  These had afforded concealment enough f=
or at least a few=20

moments.  The tent of La Certe was not far from this corner.  At the time t=
he shot was heard, the=20

self-indulgent half-breed was inside, recumbent on his back in the enjoymen=
t of a pipe.  "That's=20

odd," he said to Slowfoot, who was seated opposite to her lord scraping the=
 remnants of=20

something out of a tin kettle with the point of a scalping-knife.  "Somebod=
y's gun gone off by=20

accident, I suppose.  I hear some one at our fire.  Look out, Slowfoot, and=
 ask what has=20

happened."  Slowfoot finished the scraping of the kettle before obeying; th=
en lifted the curtain that=20

closed the opening of their tent, and peeped out.  "It is Kateegoose--loadi=
ng his gun, I think."  La=20

Certe got up, with a sigh of regret at the necessity for exertion, and, lif=
ting the curtain-door,=20

stepped out.  "What are they firing at, Kateegoose?"  The Indian did not kn=
ow.  Some one, he=20

thought, might have let off his gun by accident.  He thought it wise, howev=
er, to be ready, and had=20

just sent the ramrod down the barrel of his gun to make sure that it was lo=
aded with ball.  To make=20

still surer that all was ready, the Indian shook the priming out of the pan=
 of his gun, wiped it, and=20

re-primed. Then he laid the=20


_
wild recklessness, a mad tossing of his life into the scales of Fate. But n=
ow that same destiny=20

which he had chosen had become his master: he no longer could draw back. Wh=
at he had done=20

once, twenty times, an hundred times, that he must do again, all the while =
that the weak and the=20

defenceless called mutely to him from across the seas, all the while that i=
nnocent women suffered=20

and orphaned children cried.  And to-day it was his friend, his comrade, wh=
o had come to him in=20

his distress: the young wife whom he idolised was in the most dire peril th=
at could possibly=20

threaten any woman: she was at the mercy of a man who, driven by the passio=
n of revenge,=20

meant to show her no mercy, and the devil alone knew these days to what len=
gths of infamy a=20

man so driven would go.  The minutes sped on. Blakeney's eyes grew hot and =
wearied from=20

staring into the fire. He closed them for a moment and then quietly turned =
to go.   II  All those who=20

knew Marguerite Blakeney these days marvelled if she was ever unhappy. Lady=
 Ffoulkes, who=20

was her most trusted friend, vowed that she was not. She had moments--days-=
-sometimes weeks=20

of intense anxiety, which amounted to acute agony. Whenever she saw her hus=
band start on one=20

of those expeditions to France wherein every minute, every hour, he risked =
his life and more in=20

order to snatch yet another threatened victim from the awful clutches of ha=
d apparently laid down=20

to enable him to perform these operations more conveniently, and, at the sa=
me time, with more=20

safety.  At that moment Dechamp walked smartly towards the fire in front of=
 La Certe's tent.  "Does=20

Kateegoose know who fired that shot?" he asked with a keen glance, for his =
suspicions had been=20

aroused.  "Some one over there," answered the Indian languidly, as he point=
ed in the right=20

direction.  "It does not need a medicine-man to tell me that," said Dechamp=
, sternly.  "I heard the=20

shot, and saw the smoke.  Have you any idea who fired it, La Certe?"  "I ha=
ve not," replied the=20

half-breed.  "I was lying in my tent when I heard it.  Kateegoose was smoki=
ng beside the fire.  We=20

both thought it was an accident, or some one trying his gun, till we heard =
the shouting and running.=20

Then I jumped up, seized my gun, and sprang out to see what it was all abou=
t.  I found=20

Kateegoose equally on the _qui vive_. He was shoving his ramrod down to mak=
e sure his gun was=20

loaded when you came up.  What is it all about?"  "Only that the horse of O=
kematan has been shot=20

under him by some one, and that there is a would-be murderer in the camp." =
 "Okematan!  Has the=20

traitor ventured to return?" exclaimed Kateegoose, with an expression of su=
rprise that was very=20

unusual in an Indian.  "Ay, he has ventured," responded Dechamp, "and some =
one has ventured=20

to fire at him with=20
