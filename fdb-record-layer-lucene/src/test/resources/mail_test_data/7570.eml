to "go on now and run away if you want to." He said the slave walked away but never attempted to 

run away again. Will states that he was somewhat of a "pet" around the plantation and did almost 

as he wanted to. He would go hunting, fishing and swimming with his master's sons who were 

about his age. Sometimes he would get into a fight with one of the boys and many times he would 

be the victor, his fallen foe would sometimes exclaim that "that licking that you gave me sure hurt," 

and that ended the affair; there was no further ill feeling between them.   Education: The slaves 

were not allowed to study. The white children studied a large "Blue Back" Webster Speller and 

when one had thoroughly learned its contents he was considered to be educated.   Religion: The 

slaves had their own church but sometimes went to the churches of their white masters where 

they were relegated to the extreme rear. John Kelley, a white man, often preached to them and 

would admonish them as follows; "you must obey your master and missus, you must be good 

niggers." After the beginning of the war they held "meetings" among themselves in their cabins. 

Baptism: Those slaves who believed and accepted the Christian Doctrine were admitted into the 

church after being baptized in one of the surrounding ponds.   Cruelties: There was a very wealthy 

plantation owner who lived near the Davis plantation; he had eleven plantations, the smallest one 

was cultivated by three hundred slaves. Oftimes they would work nearly all night. Will states that it 

was not an unusual thing to hear in the early mornings the echoes of rawhide whips cracking like 

the report of a gun against the bare backs of the slaves who were being whipped. They would 

moan and groan in agony, but the whipping went on until the master's wrath was appeased. John 

Stokes, a white plantation owner who lived near the Davis' plantation encouraged slaves to steal 

from their masters and bring the stolen goods to him; he would purchase the goods for much less 

than their value. One time one of the slaves "put it out" that "Massa" Stokes was buying stolen 

goods. Stokes heard of this and his wrath was aroused; he had to find the "nigger" who was 

circulating denunciation of the outrages by the trades through England generally, was loud and 

sincere; an attempt was made, of course, to fix the guilt on all the Unions, but this was a 

hypocritical libel. It was stated, in one of our Canadian journals, the other day, that Mr. Roebuck 

had lost his seat for Sheffield, by protesting against Unionist outrage. Mr. Roebuck lost his seat for 

Sheffield by turning Tory. The Trades' candidate, by whom Mr. Roebuck was defeated, was Mr. 

Mundella, a representative of whom any constituency may be proud, a great employer of labour, 

and one who has done more than any other man of his class in England to substitute arbitration 

for industrial war, and to restore kindly relations between the employers and the employed. To Mr. 

Mundella the support of Broadhead and the criminal Unionists was offered, and by him it was 

decisively rejected.  The public mind has been filled with hideous fantasies, on the subject of 

Unionism, by sensation novelists like Mr. Charles Reade and Mr. Disraeli, the latter of whom has 

depicted the initiation of a working man into a Union with horrid rites, in a lofty and spacious room, 

hung with black cloth and lighted with tapers, amidst skeletons, men with battle axes, rows of 

masked figures in white robes, and holding torches; the novice swearing an awful oath on the 

Gospel, to do every act which the heads of the society enjoin, such as the chastisement of "nobs," 

the assassination of tyrannical masters, and the demolition of all mills deemed incorrigible by the 

society. People may read such stuff for the sake of amusement and excitement, if they please; but 

they will fall into a grave error if they take it for a true picture of the Amalgamated Carpenters or 

the Amalgamated Engineers. Besides, the Sheffield outrages were several years old at the time of 



their discovery. They belong, morally, to the time when the unions of working men being forbidden 

by unfair laws framed in the masters' interest were compelled to assume the character of 

conspiracies; when, to rob a union being no theft, unionists could hardly be expected to have the 

same respect as the better protected interests for public justice; when, moreover, the 


_
went after him in great fury and finally succeeded in locating him, whereupon, he gave him a good 

"lacing" and warned him "if he ever heard anything like that again from him he was going to kill 

him." The accusations were true, however, but the slave desisted in further discussion of the affair 

for "old Massa Stokes was a treacherous man." On another occasion one of the Stokes' slaves 

ran away and he sent Steven Kittles, known as the "dog man," to catch the escape. (The dogs that 

went in pursuit of the runaway slaves were called "Nigger dogs"; they were used specifically for 

catching runaway slaves.) This particular slave had quite a "head start" on the dogs that were 

trailing him and he hid among some floating logs in a large pond; the dogs trailed him to the pond 

and began howling, indicating that they were approaching their prey. They entered the pond to get 

their victim who was securely hidden from sight; they dissapeared and the next seen of them was 

their dead bodies floating upon the water of the pond; they had been killed by the escape. They 

were full-blooded Government as the impartial guardian of their interests, or the governing classes 

as their friends. Since the legalization of the unions, the extension of legal security to their funds 

and the admission of the mechanics to the suffrage there has been comparatively little of unionist 

crime.  I do not say that there has been none. I do not say that there is none now. Corporate 

selfishness of which Trade Unions after all are embodiments seldom keeps quite clear of 

criminality. But the moral dangers of corporate selfishness are the same in all associations and in 

all classes. The Pennsylvanian iron master who comes before our Commissions of Inquiry to 

testify against Unionist outrage in Pennsylvania where a very wild and roving class of workmen 

are managed by agents who probably take little thought for the moral condition of the miner--this 

iron master I say is himself labouring through his paid organs in the press, through his 

representatives in Congress, and by every means in his power to keep up hatred of England and 

bad relations between the two countries at the constant

used in hunting escaped slaves and were about fifty in number. The slave made his escape and 

was never seen again. Will relates that it was very cold and that he does'nt understand how the 

slave could stand the icy waters of the pond, but evidently he the interest of his Protectionist Ring. 

The upper classes of Europe in the same spirit applauded what they called the salvation of society 

by the _coup d'etat_, the massacre on the Boulevards and the lawless deportation of the leaders 

of the working

Civil War: It was rumored that Abraham Lincoln said to Jefferson Davis, "work the slaves until they 

are about twenty-five or thirty years of age, then liberate them." Davis replied: "I'll never do it, 

before I will, I'll wade knee deep in blood." The result was that in 1861, the Civil War, that struggle 

which was to mark the final emancipation of the slaves began. Jefferson Davis' brothers, Sam and 

Tom, joined the Confederate forces, together with their sons who were old enough to go, except 

James, Tom's son, who could not go on account of ill health and was left behind as overseer on 

Jack Davis' plantation. Jack Davis joined the artillery regiment of Captain Razors Company. The 

war progressed, Sherman was on his famous march. The "Yankees" had made such sweeping 

advances until they were in Robertsville, South however I repeat the present movement has been 

legal and pacific and so long as there is no violence, so long as no weapons but those of 

argument are employed, so long as law and reason reign, matters are sure to come right in the 

end. The result may not be exactly what we wish because we may wish to take too much for 

ourselves and to give our fellow men too little, but it will be just and we cannot deliberately desire 

more. If the law is broken by the Unionists, if violence or intimidation is employed by them instead 

of reason, let the Government protect the rights of the community and let the community 

strengthen the hands of the Government for that purpose.  Perhaps you will say that I have 

forgotten the International and the Commune. There is undoubtedly a close connection between 

the labour movement and
