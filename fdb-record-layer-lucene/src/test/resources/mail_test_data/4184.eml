allowed them to charge, they demanded from each of the visitors exorbitant =
tips in consideration of the little lumps of sulphur and lava which they ha=

the development of a vegetable acid which then furnishes oxygen to the albu=

could look down into a deep rocky ravine. From this hollow vapors were risi=
ng as from a witch's=20

cauldron, but every now and then the wind dispersed them as if lifting a ve=
il, revealing a glimpse of=20

the crater. At the bottom of the ravine stood a great cone, from the mouth =
of which poured dense=20

clouds of smoke, and between the smoke could be seen fire, as if the interi=
or of the cone were a=20

red-hot furnace. Sometimes the vapors were shadowy as gray phantoms, someti=
mes glowing red=20

with the reflection of the fire within, and as they whirled round the dim r=
avine loud explosions broke=20

the silence. The view was as fleeting and evanescent as a landscape in a dr=
eam; one minute=20

there would be nothing but a bank of mist and deadly stillness, the next a =
vision of fire and sounds=20

that rent the mountain air.  "It's like looking into the bottomless pit," s=
hivered Delia.  "Oh, but it's=20

magnificent!" gasped Peachy.  "I'd no idea it would be so grand as this," s=
aid Irene. "I wouldn't=20

have missed it for worlds."  "Come along, girls. The guides can take us far=
ther," said Miss Morley.=20

"Don't be frightened, for it's perfectly safe, and they won't let us go int=
o any danger."  So they went=20

some way along the mountain and turned down a side path towards the crater.=
 It was difficult=20

walking, for they were all among lava and sliding cinders, but the guides k=
ept close by them, and=20

helped them over difficult places. When they had descended perhaps a hundre=
d feet or so, the=20

ground became percolated with steam, jets of it poured from holes among the=
 rocks, and the=20

cinders upon which they stood felt warm to their boots. The guides brought =
the party to a halt upon=20

a ledge of volcanic rock, from below which ran a sheer slide of hot cinders=
 into the ravine. From=20

here there was a splendid near view of the cone, its top yellow with sulphu=
r, and at its base a lake=20

of molten lava. One of the guides, a venturesome fellow, climbed down by an=
other path and=20

fetched lumps of sulphur as souvenirs for the girls, and the other guide pr=
essed upon them pieces=20

of lava into which, while hot, is not yet developed. In fact, the first sho=
ots of the apocyneous plants=20

are eaten in several countries.  I have endeavoured by these comparisons to=
 bring into=20

consideration, under a more general point of view, the milky juices that ci=
rculate in vegetables; and=20

the milky emulsions that the fruits of the amygdalaceous plants and palms y=
ield. I may be=20

permitted to add the result of some experiments which I attempted to make o=
n the juice of the=20

Carica papaya during my stay in the valleys of Aragua, though I was then al=
most destitute of=20

chemical tests. The juice has been since examined by Vauquelin, and this ce=
lebrated chemist has=20

very clearly recognized the albumen and caseous matter; he compares the mil=
ky sap to a=20

substance strongly animalized--to the blood of animals; but his researches =
were confined to a=20

fermented juice and a coagulum of a fetid smell, formed during the passage =
from the Mauritius to=20

France. He has expressed a wish that some traveller would examine the milk =
of the papaw-tree=20

just as it flows from the stem or the fruit.  The younger the fruit of the =
carica, the more milk it=20

yields: it is even found in the germen scarcely fecundated. In proportion a=
s the fruit ripens, the milk=20

becomes less abundant, and more aqueous. Less of that animal matter which i=
s coagulable by=20

acids and by the absorption of atmospheric oxygen, is found in it. As the w=
hole fruit is viscous,* (*=20

The same viscosity is also remarked in the fresh milk of the palo de vaca. =
It is no doubt=20

occasioned by the caoutchouc, which is not yet separated, and which forms o=
ne mass with the=20

albumen and the caseum, as the butter and the caseum in animal milk. The ju=
ice of a=20

euphorbiaceous plant (Sapium aucuparium), which also yields caoutchouc, is =
so glutinous that it is=20

used to catch parrots.) it might be supposed that, as it grows larger, the =
coagulable matter is=20

deposed in the organs, and forms a part of the pulp, or the fleshy substanc=
e. When nitric acid,=20



diluted with four parts of water, is added drop by drop to the milk express=
ed from a very young=20

fruit, a very=20

mensely delighted with=20

these mementoes, and put them in their pockets, quite unsuspecting of the s=
equel that was to=20

ensue.  It was a fearful scramble back up the steep path over the sliding c=
inders. The guides held=20

out a stick or a hand to help at awkward corners, and being young and activ=
e the party managed=20

to scale the side of the ravine and regain the summit of the mountain witho=
ut any accidents,=20

kwards and roll into=20

d, divided by greyish=20

streaks. These streaks are simply the juice rendered more aqueous, owing to=
 the contact of the=20

acid having deprived it of the albumen. At the same time, the centre of the=
 pellicles becomes=20

opaque, and of the colour of the yolk of an egg; they enlarge as if by the =
prolongation of divergent=20

fibres. The whole liquid assumes at first the appearance of an agate with m=
ilky clouds; and it=20

seems as if organic membranes were forming under the eye of the observer. W=
