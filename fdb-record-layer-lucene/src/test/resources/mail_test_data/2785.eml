 Ever since man has dwelt upon the earth, there has been a philodendron mon=
stera to Filipinas, and her apathy in allowing foreign nations to seize her=
 commerce. The royal decree of January 10, 1820, although aiding Philippine=
 commerce only as a temporary measure, has already done much for the island=
s; their commerce with Espa=EF=BF=BDa has placed in circulation considerabl=
e quantities of capital, and has increased the products of agriculture and =
the exportation of      Not all the bolts of Jove, nor Ph=C5=93bus=E2=80=99=
 wrath,      May fright them from their wild, self-chosen path.      Though=
 poplars wave above ten thousand graves,      And myriad Icari lie beneath =
the waves,      The rest, as once the Titans, still press on,      And stri=
ve to thrust the great gods from their throne.=E2=80=9D   Ever since man ha=
s dwelt upon the earth, there has been a _
artisans of every class. That these be distributed by groups under head-men=
 [por cabecerias],=20

which shall not exceed sixty individuals to each one. That every Chinaman, =
as soon as he is=20

registered, shall be joined to one of these groups, the head-man becoming r=
esponsible for him.=20

That these Chinese heads of barangay must give security for the tribute fro=
m those under them,=20

and collect the tax and deliver it to the alcalde-mayor of their respective=
 province, being=20

responsible in every case for the residence and occupation of their tribute=
-payers; and for this=20

commission collecting the three per cent. That in future the tax on the Chi=
nese already settled and=20

those who shall settle in Filipinas shall be as follows: the wholesale merc=
hant, ten pesos fuertes a=20

month; the retail merchant, four pesos ditto; the artisan of every class, t=
wo pesos ditto. That every=20

Chinaman settled there shall be free to return to his own country, provided=
 he is not married, the=20

limit of six months being allowed for this. That the Chinaman, of whatever =
class, who shall not pay=20

his respective tax within one year shall be sent and delivered up to one of=
 the ranch-owners for=20

compulsory labor [por repartimiento], in order that there he may work at th=
e day-wages agreed=20

upon, which must not fall below two reals a day and food-rations of rice; a=
nd that the ranchman=20

shall with these wages pay the tax [due], at the rate of two pesos a month.=
  [Among the=20

advantages derived from this arrangement will be that of sending out of the=
 islands the many poor=20

and useless Chinese who have been gradually multiplying there, and have bee=
n infecting the=20

natives with their vices. It will even benefit the Chinese themselves, "who=
 with two reals a day,=20

which make 7 1/2 dollars a month clear" (thus showing that Sunday labor was=
 exacted), "can pay=20

two pesos of tax and be exceedingly prosperous."] [149]    Of the custom-ho=
use duties  The royal=20

decree of August 25, 1818, by which it was decided that the exaction of imp=
ort and export duties=20

should be made in the Manila custom-house from the owners of the vessels, w=
ithout considering=20

the ownership of their lading, and that if the vessel were Spanish it shoul=
d pay three per cent, and=20

if foreign six per cent, has been a special favor or privilege granted to h=
alf a dozen Spanish ship-

owners (for those who conduct the commerce with China and Bengala cannot be=
 more than that=20

number), with serious loss to the exchequer. This is, of course, annually d=
eprived of the=20

considerable income of the three per cent rebate on all foreign goods impor=
ted into Manila, which=20

is a direct benefit to the foreigners who own nearly all the commerce in th=
ose goods. The=20

manufacturers of Filipinas, especially those of cotton fabrics--which are a=
ble to compete with, and=20

even exceed in cheapness, those of China, since the cotton of which these a=
re made is of their=20

own raising--are being ruined, because that rebate of duties brings the pri=
ces of the Chinese=20

goods so near to those of their infant industry that the former ought alway=
s to be preferred; and,=20

finally, the above arrangement has also given opportunity for various fraud=
s proceeding from the=20

pretended sale of foreign vessels to Spaniards, solely for the purpose of a=
vailing themselves of the=20

rebate of duties on their cargoes, and to the possession (under assumed nam=
es) by Chinese=20

settled in Manila of Spanish vessels.  [Bernaldez states the considerations=
 which should regulate=20

these duties, and the following recommendations for the payment of duties o=
n various classes of=20

merchandise, this amount to cover in each case the entire exaction: On nati=
onal goods in transit,=20

carried to Manila--on a Spanish vessel, three per cent; on a foreign ship, =
six per cent. The same=20

goods for consumption in the country shall pay nine and ten per cent respec=
tively. On foreign=20

goods from India and China, for domestic consumption, ten and fifteen per c=
ent respectively; from=20

this class should be excepted the wines, brandies, pig iron, small articles=
 of cast iron, dry beans,=20



and foreign paper, which should pay twenty and twenty-five per cent respect=
ively. Goods, whether=20

national or foreign, not declared as in transit at leaving Manila shall pay=
 two and four per cent=20

respectively; but those registered on a Spanish ship from India, China, and=
 all Asia for Espaa, ten=20

per cent. Coined silver and gold, and silver bullion, shall pay no entrance=
 duty at Manila, but on=20

leaving that port shall pay three and six per cent respectively; and foreig=
n gold in bullion shall pay=20

eight per cent at entering Manila (whether on Spanish or foreign vessels). =
National products, and=20

those of the industries of Filipinas, shall pay when exported eight per cen=
t on a foreign vessel, but=20

nothing on a Spanish ship. The duty of the merchant's peso [peso marchante]=
 which the=20

municipality of Manila collects should be abolished as obstructive to comme=
rce; for the legal origin=20

of this imposition is unknown, and it is very unsuitable for a municipality=
 which is rich through its=20

rents, revenues, and imposts. Bernaldez believes that this tariff would pro=
mote agriculture,=20

industry, and navigation, and benefit the royal treasury. More coin would b=
e brought into the=20

islands, the plan of exempting it from duties having been adopted for that =
purpose by all the other=20

governments of Asia. The burden of these duties will fall mainly on the ric=
h class, and not on the=20

Indians. The "infant industries" [fabricas nacientes] will be protected, an=
d the Spanish merchant=20

marine will be given the advantage over the foreigners.]    Of the inter-is=
land trade  The inter-island=20

trade of the Filipinas Islands is at present quite active, as is shown by t=
he latest reports received.=20

Its importance is well worth consideration, since the commodities which are=
 traded in this way=20

constitute the greater part of the cargoes of the export commerce. Tortoise=
-shell, gold, birds'-

nests, balate, wax, cacao, and other products form cargoes of great value w=
hich come from the=20

provinces. The exclusive proprietors of this commerce are the alcaldes-mayo=
r of the provinces,=20

and the rich mestizos and Chinese, who in this traffic have made exorbitant=
 profits, for it is these=20

alone who exclusively avail themselves of the rise in prices which is produ=
ced in Manila by the=20

arrival there of foreign vessels together. This causes those posts of alcal=
de there to be very=20

eagerly sought, since in only three years of holding them they allow [the m=
aking of] a fortune; and=20

also that the class of mestizos and Chinese is the only one that is sure of=
 becoming rich in=20

Filipinas.... The result is, that with the exception of the great fortunes =
which in other times were=20

made in the privileged commerce of Nueva Espaa, it is this [coasting trade]=
 from which have=20

proceeded the fortunes of Manila. [This branch of trade is exempt from all =
duties, a privilege which=20

does not benefit either the agriculture or the other industries of the Indi=
ans, since they always sell=20

at the same price, and have no share in the profits of the trade. Nor is th=
is commerce promoted by=20

the freedom from duties, for it will always continue and always yield great=
 profits to those who=20

carry it on--who can well afford to pay a moderate tax on their lucrative t=
rade, especially as it is=20

partly for their benefit that the government incurs so great expense for cu=
rbing the piracies of the=20

Moros. It is recommended:] That all commodities, whether natural products o=
r those of industry,=20

which arrive at the port of Manila by sea from the provinces shall pay one =
per cent on the prices=20

current in that city; and from this tax shall be exempted only rice (whethe=
r in the hull or cleaned),=20

cocoanut oil, and fresh fruits, as being articles of prime necessity for th=
e Indians. That no duty=20

shall be collected for those same products when they are transported by lan=
d, or by the rivers and=20

lack of necessaries created a vast deal of sickness; and the deaths thus in=
directly occasioned far=20

exceeded those killed outright.  The damage to buildings in Charleston is e=
stimated at $5,000,000.=20

But in comparison with the whole number injured, comparatively few of the h=
ouses were shaken=20



completely down. Hundreds were shaken and shattered to the point of falling=
, and had to be pulled=20

down as unsafe. The shock was just short of a point where it would have mad=
e terrible havoc. If=20

violent enough to overthrow the many houses it merely shattered, its victim=
s would have been=20

numbered by thousands, instead of tens. We may be thankful, with Lord North=
, that things were no=20

worse.  The nature of the shocks varied. In some parts of South Carolina ch=
imneys and brick walls=20

remained upright, but crushed to atoms at the base, as if shattered by a po=
werful upward=20

concussion; in other locations, evidences of a twisting motion were present=
; houses were turned=20

partially around, and left almost unharmed. Again, as in most cases in Char=
leston, the chief=20

movement appeared to be a horizontal one--the upper portions of walls and b=
uildings being thrown=20

down, while the lower suffered little harm. More of these singular effects =
will be noticed in=20

connection with other shocks. Crevices and fissures were opened; railroad r=
ails bent in a snake-

like form; mud, sand, and small stones were thrown out. There was no tidal =
wave, and artesian=20

wells four hundred feet deep were not disturbed. There was no barometric va=
riation, though the air=20

is said to have suddenly become oppressively hot at the moment of the shock=
. Some=20

Pennsylvania gas wells diminished, and a geyser in the Yellowstone Park, fo=
ur years quiet, burst=20

suddenly into action. These we must deem mere coincidences.  As a whole, th=
is has been the=20

most destructive single earthquake in our history, while far inferior in re=
al violence to the=20

convulsions last noticed. For frequency of shocks, and total damage in cons=
equence, the Pacific=20

States far exceed all the rest of the country. Their position with active v=
olcanic regions in Oregon=20

and Washington and Lower California, renders them peculiarly liable to such=
 disturbances. Within=20

the years 1872-1885, inclusive, there were registered seventy-five earthqua=
kes in New England,=20

sixty-six in the Atlantic States, seventy-five in the Mississippi Valley, a=
nd two hundred and thirty-

seven in the Pacific States.  These facts ought to be conclusive evidence a=
gainst the belief that,=20

because storms and earthquakes are sometimes simultaneous, the one is in an=
y way responsible=20

for the other. These figures show the fewest shocks in the region  [Illustr=
ation: WRECK OF=20

FACTORY, CHARLESTON.]  most frequented by tornadoes; while the section neve=
r visited by the=20

latter shows more shocks than all the rest combined. Add to these the previ=
ous shocks recorded in=20

our history--231--and it is evident that we have our full share of such con=
vulsions.  In respect to=20

earthquakes, our British cousins have been even more fortunate than ourselv=
es. A cursory glance=20

at British geology shows that at a remote age in the past, volcanic action =
was frequent and violent;=20

but the whole region has long buried or healed the wounds inflicted upon th=
e face of nature by the=20

petulant giants of fire. Now and then there is a premonitory tremor; but th=
e warning seems not to=20

be for the grandchildren of the Druids; and the latter have been lulled to =
a sense of almost=20

absolute security.  Yet at some periods of the past they have been seriousl=
y disturbed, if we may=20

credit the old chroniclers; but their records are so brief, and at times so=
 conflicting, that it is not=20

always easy to determine the extent of the disaster. And it must be remembe=
red that in the dark=20

and middle ages the mass of the people knew absolutely nothing of affairs n=
ot in their own=20

immediate neighborhood.  Perhaps the most striking feature of British earth=
quakes is the fact that,=20

like the shocks in the Vesuvian neighborhood, the area they disturb is very=
 small; it may be,=20

however, that incompleteness of reports is responsible for this apparent pe=
culiarity. Up to the last=20

century but one general shock is recorded; this being the first of which th=
ere is definite mention,=20

occurring in 974 A. D. Five others are recorded in the next century, all lo=
cal.  Perhaps the most=20



violent of the earlier earthquakes was the one which in 1110 shook the regi=
on between=20

Shrewsbury and Nottingham, tumbling down many houses and injuring many peop=
le. At=20

Nottingham the bed of the river Trent was laid dry and remained so some hou=
rs. Probably a large=20

fissure opened temporarily in the channel, allowing the water to escape int=
o subterranean cavities.=20

Three other earthquakes occurred in the Lincolnshire fens in the next thirt=
y-two years, doing=20

considerable damage.  In 1158 mention is made of a most extraordinary earth=
quake which shook=20

London and vicinity, destroying much property, injuring several people, and=
 causing the Thames to=20

become so low as to be passed on foot. Seven years later there was a genera=
l tremor observed=20

throughout all England.  John of Brompton relates a remarkable circumstance=
 in connection with=20

an earthquake in 1179. The ground belonging to the bishop of Durham, at Oxe=
nhall near=20

Darlington, was raised suddenly to a level with the adjacent hills, remaini=
ng so from 9 A.M. till=20

sunset, when it fell again, leaving a deep cavity in place of a hill. Three=
 other earthquakes=20

occurred ere the close of the century; the last one, in Somersetshire in 11=
99, being violent enough=20

to throw men off their feet.  Forty-seven years passed without any further =
experience of the sort,=20

when a series of severe shocks, especially violent in Kent, overthrew a num=
ber of churches and=20

other buildings of the more pretentious sort; and the same thing happened n=
ext year, affecting=20

especially London and the Thames Valley. Again, in the year after, Bath and=
 Wells suffered=20

considerably; and two years later St. Albans was shaken.  Of other earthqua=
kes in the next=20

century no especial mention need be made, save of one of unusual violence i=
n 1385. A revolution=20

in Scotland followed, and the superstitious populace, looking backward, con=
cluded that the=20

earthquake had been meant as a warning which they had not been able to inte=
rpret. A second=20

shock which  [Illustration: RUINED DWELLING, CHARLESTON.]  followed the rev=
olution was=20

supposed to express the Divine displeasure at their short-sightedness.  But=
 one shock, though a=20

very general one, is recorded during the next one hundred and sixty-six yea=
rs. Then in 1551 a=20

slight tremor upset the people=E2=80=99s furniture and dinner pots in a por=
tion of Surrey. Twenty years=20

afterward a severe shock in Herefordshire was accompanied by a landslide. A=
 large portion of a=20

hill slowly descended during two days, turning a half circle as it came, as=
 though on a pivot.  In=20

1574 a sharp vibration shook northern and western England at the hour for v=
espers. Suppliants in=20

Norton Chapel were thrown prostrate and fled in terror, believing the dead =
were rising through the=20

floor. Part of Ruthin Castle was thrown down.  In 1580, April 6, nearly all=
 England was alarmed by=20

a violent shock. The great bell at Westminster rang the alarm; others joine=
d in. Students of the=20

Temple rushed into the streets; stones fell from St. Paul=E2=80=99s; shower=
s of chimneys in the streets=20

maimed several persons; a panic ensued at Christ Church, where two people w=
ere killed by falling=20

stones, and several were maimed in the wild rush to escape from the buildin=
g. Parts of the=20

fortifications at Dover were overthrown; also several churches and castles =
were damaged. May 1=20

of the same year the shocks were again felt in Kent, during the night. This=
 is one of the most=20

notable of British earthquakes; it passed eastward through Belgium to Colog=
ne.  But it is needless=20

to pursue the record further. Only two unusual=20


_
from the time when this law shall go into effect, the power which the munic=
ipality of Manila has to=20

tax the value of the provisions which come from the provinces shall be supp=
ressed. The=20

exemption from duties will tend, in regard to the provinces of Luzon, to en=
courage in that island=20

preminently, as is desirable, agriculture and industry, and at the same tim=
e will save to the=20

custom-house the new expenses which it would [otherwise] have to incur for =
establishing posts=20

and men to guard against smuggling.    Of money  The Spanish peso is the un=
iversal money in the=20

commerce among all the nations of Asia; and, as therefore the exterior comm=
erce is constantly=20

drawing it into circulation, the governments of all the colonies in that pa=
rt of the world have found=20

themselves obliged to create a colonial money, which on account of its prov=
isional value cannot be=20

taken out of the country, and, being directed into the internal commerce of=
 the province, feeds and=20

multiplies exchanges. In Filipinas there was no need of adopting that measu=
re while its commerce=20

with Nueva Espaa lasted, because then those islands were receiving annually=
 a million of Mexican=20

pesos, and the situado of two hundred and fifty thousand; and, besides this=
, the business that was=20

carried on during that period in the natural and industrial products of the=
 country was almost=20

insignificant. And if in Filipinas at this present time enough money circul=
ates to support the outside=20

traffic, that results from the fact that the profits which the colony has g=
ained from the commerce=20

with all the nations of Europa (the balance of which is in favor of Filipin=
as) are greater than the=20

losses of money which it experiences in its commerce with India and China. =
[This is of course a=20

very precarious situation; for the contingencies of war, diversion of comme=
rce from the islands, or=20

poor crops may at any time compel Filipinas to send out all its money to In=
dia or China for the=20

supply of its needed commodities; and this would ruin even the internal com=
merce, "on account of=20

the serious difficulties which the establishment of a system of public cred=
it there presents."]=20

Besides that, considering now the matter of giving a strong impulse to the =
agriculture and industry=20

of those islands, there would be needed for the former project many million=
s of pesos in constant=20

circulation in the provinces, and there must be a great reversion of the ca=
pital employed in=20

commerce to the interior of the islands; and this cannot be practiced in a =
country in which hardly=20

enough money circulates to support the government and the demands from with=
out, and which=20

had undertaken to promote its interests by commerce before placing its agri=
culture and industry on=20

a sound basis. In almost all the provinces of the islands very little money=
 circulates, and in some of=20

them there is not even what is necessary in order that the natives can pay =
the government taxes;=20

and from this has proceeded the necessity of commuting the tribute from mon=
ey to kind. The=20

Spanish pesos go from and return to the provinces rapidly; and it can be sa=
id that the produce of=20

the taxes which has to be sent annually to the capital, and the importation=
s of the alcaldes and the=20

mestizos, are equal. Most of the Indians trade among themselves by means of=
 simple barter, and=20

the mestizos make them pay dearly with their products for the money that th=
ey need for clothing=20

themselves and paying their taxes.  There is, then, nothing to hope for--ei=
ther advance in=20

agriculture and the useful arts, or the great extension and progress of whi=
ch the consumption of=20

monopolized articles is susceptible--without the creation of a colonial mon=
ey which will remain=20

within the colony to which it belongs, which will liberate it from the prec=
arious dependence on=20

foreign commerce, which will afford to the Indian the just profits from his=
 labor, which by remaining=20

with him in the provinces will encourage him to obtain possession of it as =
an easy means of=20

providing him with the necessities of life at the time [when he needs them,=
] and which likewise=20



may be an allurement to his children--which up to a certain point it is of =
great importance to=20

encourage in the Indians, as a powerful incentive to make them labor. [Last=
ly, this colonial money=20

would check the exportation of silver coin by the Chinese, [150] who would =
then prefer to export=20

from Filipinas its nature products in return for their commodities. In Chin=
a all the Spanish pesos=20

are, in order to keep them within the empire, disfigured with so many marks=
 that they cannot be=20

used in foreign commerce.] We have no knowledge thus far of there being sil=
ver mines in Filipinas;=20

but it is a positive fact that gold abounds there, of so low grade and so m=
ingled with silver that it=20

has little more value than that metal. This circumstance, aided by the intr=
oduction of some silver=20

bars from America, carried thither by foreigners, the recoinage of the half=
-dollars, and of the silver=20

two-real, one-real, and half-real pieces which circulate in the islands, an=
d the use of the great=20

amount of old silver in household articles--which is there sold at very low=
 prices, on account of=20

being alloyed and manufactured in China--would supply the government with e=
asy means for the=20

creation of a colonial currency without need for expense, or for forestalli=
ng [the income from] any=20

fund, only by accepting from the persons interested their respective materi=
als in gold or silver,=20

under assay, and returning to them the value of the metal in the coined mon=
ey which it would=20

yield, after deducting the necessary expenses. Likewise the government coul=
d accept, in payment=20

of all taxes, the gold which is obtained from the placers, at the same pric=
es at which the Chinese=20

carry it away, and after it was assayed at its mint--where the learned prof=
essors who for this=20

purpose would be sent from Europe would dictate the necessary measures for =
carrying into effect=20

an undertaking which is the basis for all progress in the islands. I am the=
refore of opinion that his=20

Majesty should deign to issue the following orders: That a colonial currenc=
y be immediately=20

created for internal circulation in the Filipinas Islands. That for this pu=
rpose a mint be established=20

there. That the standard for this money be the same as those of the moneys =
of the same kind=20

which have been adopted in the other colonies of Asia. That the subdivision=
s of its value be made=20

according to the needs of internal trade. That all the gold and silver, in =
various forms, which private=20

persons offer for coinage be accepted at the mint, returning it to them in =
the standard coin which it=20

yields after the expenses are deducted. That the government there be author=
ized to accept in=20

payment of taxes the gold from the mines of Filipinas, after it is assayed.=
 That regulations be=20

drawn up by competent persons, in which precautions are taken against any f=
raud in this matter.=20

Of the charitable funds established in Filipinas  [The obras pas merit full=
 attention from the=20

government,] on account of the advantages which the agriculture and industr=
y of the islands may=20

gain from them. If the limited and privileged dealings of Manila with Nueva=
 Espaa had not been=20

reduced to a merely passive commerce of transfer or transportation, those f=
oundations would, at=20

the same time while they have become wealthy, have given real opulence to t=
hat commerce. Of=20

the enormous profit of two hundred and three hundred per cent which the tra=
nsactions of the=20

galleon yielded at Acapulco, the greater part was for the foreign dealers o=
f India and China, whose=20

wares supplied almost all the lading of the galleons, and for the obras pas=
; a greatly reduced profit=20

remained for the Manila merchants, which could be shown by a calculation wh=
ich might be made=20

of the many millions imported from Nueva Espaa by the galleons, and of the =
comparatively small=20

value, in money or assistance, which has remained [therefrom] in the island=
s. [The returns from=20

these funds are now greatly diminished, since the cessation of the Acapulco=
 trade, for on that=20

depended the commerce with India and China, which also has practically ende=
d, save for the=20



commodities from those countries which are consumed in Filipinas. This coul=
d not have been=20

foreseen by the founders of those funds, many of which, moreover, are imped=
ed by various=20

restrictions and conditions; and the government should interpose its author=
ity not only to secure=20

the fulfilment of the founders' wishes, but to commute the investment of th=
e funds in such a way=20

that they may be used to promote the agriculture and industry of the countr=
y. These funds ought=20

also to be preserved as a most useful resource in case of war or revolution=
, when the usual=20

revenues of the government would cease. Bernaldez therefore recommends:] Th=
at the=20

government of Manila furnish special protection to the charitable foundatio=
ns of the islands, and=20

keep close watch over their honest administration. That it stimulate the ma=
nagers to obtain=20

immediately from the competent authority the commutation of the allotments =
of these funds so as=20

to benefit the agriculture and manufactures of the country, giving reports =
of what shall be effected=20

in a matter so important for the welfare of the islands. That the funds in =
the communal treasuries=20

of the Indians and the Chinese, those of the secular revenues, [151] and an=
y others which are not=20

subject to private foundations and regulations, and which hitherto have fol=
lowed in their=20

investments the rules of the obras pas, shall be by preference set aside fo=
r rewards bestowed for=20

enterprises in agriculture, industry, and inter-island trade. Thus will be =
remedied the injury arising=20

from the failure of those great funds to be in circulation; and the abuse o=
f employing them in favor=20

of foreigners and their commerce, under assumed names, will be corrected.  =
  Of the arsenal of=20

Cavite  [Bernaldez declares that the works of naval construction, etc., for=
 the government can be=20

accomplished for half the cost by means of private contracts awarded to the=
 lowest bidder, which=20

is proved by the history of all the enterprises which have been undertaken =
by the government in=20

those islands, whether in agriculture, mining, or metal-working; "for, howe=
ver great the=20

disinterestedness and economy which can be ascribed to the officials who co=
nduct the enterprise,=20

in this direction nothing can take the place of the contractor's activity a=
nd vigilance." In the cutting=20

and gathering of timber there is abundant cheating and graft, as that work =
is directed by Indian=20

overseers, or by mestizos and Chinese; the latter have abandoned the system=
 of day wages=20

("which the natural slothfulness of the Indian renders very costly"), and i=
nstead pay the natives so=20

much for a certain amount of work (which they call paqueao). "In this way t=
he Indians, who always=20

are cheated in these calculations, have to redouble their efforts to gain t=
he amount bargained for,=20

thus allowing to the mestizo the benefit of at least one-third of the usual=
 daily wages." After the=20

timber is cut, its transportation, storage, and seasoning cost more when do=
ne by the government=20

than by the mestizo contractor, and occasion much loss and damage. Ships of=
 war could be built=20

at Manila to great advantage, so far as the abundance and cheapness and loc=
ation of the timber is=20

concerned; but the lack of iron and copper there is a serious hindrance to =
such plans. There are=20

mines of both metals in the islands, but they are not worked for lack of en=
terprising persons and=20

suitable machinery. Bernaldez recommends: That the crown offer large reward=
s for the successful=20

operation of the iron and copper mines in the islands, the supply therefrom=
 of metal sufficient for=20

the construction of ships and cannon, and the introduction of machinery for=
 mining and iron-

working. was confined to an area six miles by five; and one in 1734 exhibit=
ed a peculiar rotary=20

motion, shaking persons in bed around at right angles to their former posit=
ions.  Summing up the=20

record, we find that in the 10th century one earthquake is recorded in Engl=
and; during the 11th,=20

ten; during the 12th, twelve; during the 13th, thirteen; during the 14th, f=
our; during the 15th, one;=20



six in the 16th; twenty in the 17th, and eighty-four in the eighteenth. The=
 present has also had a=20

fair quota. But if we consider the damage to property, or the fatality, we =
must conclude that no=20

country in the world is so favored in this matter of earthquakes as Great B=
ritain, unless it may be=20

Germany.  Finally, all the disasters of this sort, in both England and the =
United States, so far as all=20

historic records go, do not equal a single one of the many terrible convuls=
ions recorded in the=20

history of other nations. From the earliest times to the present, we find a=
 constant succession of=20

appalling disasters, many of which are almost beyond the power of comprehen=
sion. The most=20

cursory glance at these horrors of the past should render every Anglo-Saxon=
 peculiarly grateful=20

that his lot is not cast in a land so cursed with terrors, and more ready t=
o sympathize with the=20

stranger in his woe.     CHAPTER XXVI.  EARTHQUAKES IN TROPICAL AMERICA.   =
   =E2=80=9CHark!=20

louder on the blast come hollow shrieks      Of dissolution; in the fitful =
scowl      Of night, near and=20

more near, angels of death      Incessant flap their deadly wings, and roar=
      Through all the=20

fevered air: the mountains rock      And thousand meteors flame about their=
 heads;      The thunder=20

long and loud gives out his voice,      Responsive to the ocean=E2=80=99s t=
roubled growl,      While bellowing=20

chasms rend th=E2=80=99 eternal hills.      Earth trembles at the mighty ma=
rch of death.=E2=80=9D   The reader will be=20

assured, from the facts given concerning volcanic eruptions, and the earthq=
uakes of Asia Minor=20

mentioned in the former chapter, that great earthquakes are as numerous in =
Asiatic districts as=20

elsewhere; but beyond the bare fact, little is known of most of these. Indi=
a has preserved no=20

written history: and China and Japan have been till recently almost inacces=
sible to Europeans. So=20

while the disturbances there are equal in importance to those of other land=
s, it is but lately that any=20

definite information has been accessible; and our chief knowledge has come =
from personal=20

narratives of white settlers and visitors to the islands of the western Pac=
ific. In Japan, there is, to=20

say nothing of numerous volcanoes, strong circumstantial evidence of the fr=
equency of=20

earthquakes in days past. Almost all dwellings are constructed of bamboo an=
d lightest woods, one=20

story high, with screens of paper as partitions: houses of stone are feared=
, the people preferring to=20

take their chances on a great fire than on an earthquake. The same fact is =
noticeable  [Illustration:=20

EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA.]  in the Philippines, Moluccas, and adjacent groups. A=
lmost the only=20

stone buildings are those of Spanish and Dutch settlers. China has apparent=
ly suffered less; but=20

we learn that in 1556 two entire provinces were laid waste. The extent of t=
he loss of life can not be=20

estimated. The earth vomited ashes and flames, and ten great sea waves occu=
rred in twenty-four=20

hours.  Since European occupation of the East Indies, the convulsions have =
been frequent and=20

alarming. The city of Manila was completely destroyed, with thousands of pe=
ople, in 1645. Not one=20

stone remained on another. Severe shocks occurred there again in 1699, 1796=
, 1825, 1852, and=20

1863. The last named wrecked the cathedral while filled with worshipers. Th=
e loss of property was=20

from $8,000,000 to $10,000,000, or twice that of our Charleston earthquake.=
 Four hundred people=20

were killed. The shock lasted about half a minute, but opened many fissures=
, emitted volumes of=20

gas and spoilt the river water. Again, in 1880, after some vague or irregul=
ar tremblings, there were=20

several violent shocks. There was first experienced a peculiar sense of nau=
sea and faintness, with=20

a feeling of powerlessness or inability to flee. Horses stopped trembling i=
n the streets, =E2=80=9Cstanding=20

with ears erect, with staring eyes, and stiffly extended legs, as though co=
nscious of extraordinary=20

peril.=E2=80=9D The natives, heedless of appeals for help, wildly sought th=
eir own safety, or knelt devoutly=20

invoking the saints. Clouds of dust filled the air, and heaps of ruin block=
ed the streets. The terrible=20



hush that prevailed was broken only by an occasional cry for aid, or the cr=
ash of a ruined home.=20

Portions of ground between great crevices were raised five or six feet; oth=
er parts fell as much.=20

But the confusion rapidly subsided, and occupations of all sorts were resum=
ed. One newspaper,=20

true to the traditional enterprise of the fraternity, dragged its paraphern=
alia from its ruined building,=20

and went to work in the middle of the street. An American publisher could h=
ardly beat that.  But a=20

region whose earthquakes have attracted greater attention, and have been mo=
re carefully noticed=20

by scientific men than those of the eastern archipelago, is to be found alo=
ng the western slope of=20

the Andes, extending thence into Central America and Northern Venezuela and=
 the West Indies.=20

Ever since the Spanish conquest, earthquakes have been numerous and violent=
 in this whole=20

region; and judging from the character of the native dwellings, the aborigi=
nes were for centuries=20

accustomed to such movements. But it remained for Humboldt, in the last cen=
tury, to give us a=20

more careful description of some of the greater of these disasters.  Of the=
 preceding disturbances,=20

one of the most notable occurred in 1698, when the crater of the volcano Ca=
rguirazo fell in with a=20

great crash during a shock of earthquake, and an area of twenty square mile=
s was covered with=20

mud containing numerous dead fish. A few years later, a similar occurrence =
north of Quito=20

produced an epidemic of pernicious fevers.  But of the many great convulsio=
ns, that of Riobamba,=20

in 1794, must rank as exceeding all within the range of authentic history, =
unless we except the one=20

which destroyed Antioch in the year 526. The area disturbed was the great v=
olcanic plain on which=20

Quito stands.  No subterranean noise announced or accompanied the shock. Ad=
jacent volcanoes=20

were quiet; but the volcano of Pasto, sixty miles to the northward, had for=
 three months been=20

violently smoking; and at the moment the shock sixty miles away began, it s=
uddenly stopped, nor=20

did it again begin. The volcano of Cayambe, near Quito, seemed surrounded b=
y meteorites. The=20

pious people, alarmed at this manifestation of the divine wrath, formed a r=
eligious procession=20

which walked through the principal streets. The result justified their beli=
ef in the potency of their=20

prayers; for Quito remained unharmed. A great roar, since known as _el gran=
 ruido_, was heard=20

under the town some twenty minutes after the disaster; but at the scene of =
the latter it was not=20

heard at all.  In the immediate vicinity of Riobamba, the destruction was f=
earful. The entire plain=20

seemed rent into small independent fragments, which rose or sank at will. H=
umboldt tells that an=20

eye-witness might have seen =E2=80=9Cfissures which alternately opened and =
closed, so that persons=20

partially engulfed were saved by extending their arms, that they might not =
be swallowed up;=20

portions of long trains of muleteers and laden mules disappearing in sudden=
ly opening cross=20

fissures, whilst other portions, by a hasty retreat, escaped the danger; ve=
rtical oscillations, by the=20

non-simultaneous rising and sinking of adjoining portions of ground, so tha=
t persons standing in=20

the choir of a church, sixteen feet above the pavement of the street, found=
 themselves lowered to=20

the level of the pavement without being thrown down; the sinking down of ma=
ssive houses, with=20

such an absence of disruption or dislocation that the inhabitants could ope=
n the doors of the=20

interior, pass uninjured from room to room, light candles and debate with e=
ach other their chance=20

of escape, during two days which elapsed before they were dug out; lastly, =
the entire=20

disappearance of great masses of stones and building materials. The old tow=
n had possessed=20

churches, convents, and houses of several stories; but in the places where =
they stood, we found,=20

on tracing out among the ruins the former plan of the city, only stone heap=
s of from eight to twelve=20

feet in height.=E2=80=9D  Of some of the villages in the adjacent plain not=
 a trace was left. They sunk bodily,=20



and the earth closed over them. Of the others, only heaps of ruins were lef=
t.  [Illustration: AFTER=20

THE SHOCK.]  Nor was this all. The great volcano of Tunguragua, at the sout=
hern extremity of the=20

plateau, was rent asunder by the shock, or, according to others, had an eru=
ption from the side.=20

Immense torrents of thick, dark, sandy mud, mingled with pebbles, poured ou=
t and flooded=20

adjacent portions of the plain, smothered scores still entangled in the rui=
ns of their dwellings, filling=20

numerous ravines and valleys, one of which was one thousand feet wide and s=
even hundred feet=20

deep.  The total loss of life was terrible. One authority places the destru=
ction at two hundred=20

thousand. Forty thousand Indians were suffocated by the torrent of mud alon=
e. It is the most=20

destructive earthquake in modern history.  The town of Cumana has been visi=
ted almost as=20

frequently as the far-famed Antioch. In 1530, we are told, the sea rose fou=
r fathoms, the earth was=20

rent, a fort laid in ruins, the town wrecked, and dark, noisome liquids eje=
cted from fissures. In=20

1766, a long drought, fifteen months in duration, had turned the thoughts o=
f the people once more=20

upon their manifold transgressions, and they were prepared for further chas=
tisement. This came=20

upon them. October 21 an earthquake blotted the town out of existence in le=
ss than a minute. The=20

earth vomited sulphurous waters. The shocks were continued during fourteen =
months. The good=20

people instituted an annual fast and procession in commemoration of the eve=
nt.  Again, in 1794,=20

Cumana was nearly prostrated. December 14, 1797, there was a tremendous, up=
ward shock, with=20

a noise like a mine explosion. Four-fifths of the town was laid in ruins. T=
he atmosphere seemed=20

converted to water, so great were the torrents of rain. The Indians held a =
religious festival and=20

dance, believing the destruction and regeneration of the world was at hand.=
  The first days of=20

November, 1799, were noted for the peculiar redness of the sky and the oppr=
essiveness of the=20

atmosphere, though the weather was not especially warm. At nightfall the se=
a breeze failed to=20

begin, and the dusty earth began to crack in all directions. The people wer=
e sure some evil boded.=20

November 4, as a heavy storm came up, there was a sharp gust of wind, which=
 the natives say=20

always precedes an earthquake; and a few minutes later came the shock; two =
others followed=20

during the evening; but though all the tokens of a great shock, according t=
o native ideas, were=20

present in such force that the people abandoned their homes and slept in th=
e parks and fields, the=20

great quake never came. The redness of the sky continued, and a few nights =
later occurred a=20

brilliant shower of meteors. Despite these signs and wonders, Mother Earth =
refused to tremble.=20

Humboldt concluded native prognostications were unreliable.  During the pas=
t eighty years=20

destructive earthquakes have been more frequent in South America than in an=
y other region of the=20

earth. First on the list is the great disaster at Caracas.  This town lies =
six miles from the seaport of=20

La Guayra, in a valley =E2=80=9Cwhere reigns eternal spring.=E2=80=9D Shut =
in by lofty mountains, its aspect is=20

somewhat gloomy. The cold mountain air keeps the evening veiled with clouds=
. But as a whole,=20

the situation is so fine that the people=20


_
war-ships each year, by contracts for the supply of timber and the manual l=
abor. That competent=20

engineers and constructors be sent from Espaa, at good salaries; that neces=
sary supplies and=20

materials be secured by contracts, bid for in public; and that funds from t=
he royal exchequer be set=20

aside for this purpose to the amount of one hundred thousand to one hundred=
 and fifty thousand=20

pesos annually. That all the construction and repairing of war-ships for Fi=
lipinas be done through=20

contracts, at public bidding; and that the arsenal of Cavite be reduced to =
a simple depository for=20

the articles required for arming the ships, with such officials as may be n=
ecessary for the custody=20

of these.]    Of the agriculture of the Filipinas Islands, in general, and =
of their principal productions=20

The Filipinas Islands, on account of the fertility of their land, their abu=
ndant rains, and the great=20

number of animals for labor, constitute an agricultural colony; and to the =
readiness with which the=20

country supplies the principal articles for human support has been due the =
rapid increase of its=20

population. And although the Indians, as a general thing, only devote thems=
elves to the cultivation=20

of what they actually need for subsistence, the annual production so far ex=
ceeds the necessities of=20

the people that very seldom has the failure or scarcity of provisions been =
experienced. The=20

abundance of its arable lands and the excellence of its products have also =
rendered this colony=20

capable of a considerable commerce with the other nations, at a much greate=
r advantage over the=20

other colonies, inasmuch as the land is tilled by free labor, which costs o=
nly the value of its food=20

and clothing; and not by slaves, who, besides those expenses, occasion that=
 of the premium or=20

interest on the money invested in their purchase, which causes a difference=
 of at least a third more=20

in the cost of the manual labor employed in agriculture.  The neglected con=
dition in which=20

agriculture is in Filipinas, considered under this last aspect, and the bac=
kwardness in knowledge=20

of the manipulations required in the preparation of its raw products for th=
eir consumption in trade,=20

proceed from the following causes: (1) The lack of a stable and regular sys=
tem of commerce which=20

can assure to the inhabitants of the islands the annual exportation of the =
produce of an extensive=20

agriculture. The foreign vessels resort to the ports there, some years in e=
xcessive number and=20

others very infrequently; and this irregularity always produces an effect o=
pposed to the interests of=20

the colony. The extraordinary rise in prices--which during the last three y=
ears has reached a value=20

double that from which the ability to sell at all times would enable the co=
lony to gain a profit--and=20

the consequent lack of commodities for supplying all the vessels, prevent t=
hem from returning in=20

the following years; while the decline of prices below what is fair, caused=
 by the non-arrival of=20

ships, discourages large production in agriculture. The Indians are absolut=
ely without capital and=20

storehouses which would enable them to hold back their produce for another =
market. They are=20

induced to cultivate the soil solely by their present advantage; they alway=
s sell, but they suffer=20

from the stern law of trade which, although it flatters them in years of sc=
arcity, equally tyrannizes=20

over them in years of abundance--for they are always deceived regarding the=
 actual prices of the=20

general market, of which they are ignorant; and one year only of unsuccessf=
ul sales, whether from=20

lack of foreign ships, or through the loss of their crops, will be a warnin=
g to them for a long time. In=20

short, the agriculture of Filipinas at this time depends on the irregular a=
nd transient stimulus which=20

is furnished to it by the peripatetic capital of the mestizo, who buys only=
 in the years when he=20

calculates that he must in view of the condition of the crops and the marke=
t, make a profit; while=20

the Indian farmer always sows his seed heedless of results, and without the=
 guidance of that=20

elementary principle in affairs of commerce that the estimate of what he ac=
quires ought to be=20



based on a calculation of the market for it. For the corrective of this evi=
l, and assuming that, for=20

reasons that are rightful and conformable to sound policy (as I have set fo=
rth), the residence of=20

foreigners in the islands ought not to be permitted, I find no other means =
than this, that the=20

government encourage, by judicious measures, the direct and unlimited comme=
rce of Espaa with=20

that colony--of which I shall speak in another chapter, [presenting] the ro=
ugh sketch of a plan=20

which ought to produce the following effects: (a) The definite and reliable=
 annual exportation from=20

those islands, not only of the great quantity of sugar, indigo, coffee, and=
 other native products=20

which are needed in the ordinary consumption of Espaa, but of that which Sp=
anish commerce can=20

dispose of in the other nations and free ports of Europa. (b) The establish=
ment of Spanish trading=20

posts [factorias] in the interior of the provinces of Filipinas, which the =
Spanish mercantile interests=20

will carry on for the sake of acquiring the agricultural produce at first h=
and, freeing the Indians from=20

the oppressive rule of the mestizo trader, and forming contracts with them,=
 at prices agreed upon,=20

for a certain number of years.  [The backward condition of agriculture proc=
eeds] (2) from the lack=20

of great agricultural establishments. One of the causes for this is the fac=
t that the capital of the=20

islands, which ought to be employed for that object, has been diverted by t=
he commerce of India,=20

China, and Nueva Espaa, which offers greater and quicker profits. The relig=
ious orders administer=20

their estates as in mortmain, or by ecclesiastical rules. The Indians culti=
vate, not from inclination=20

but through necessity, the little plots of ground on which they have fixed =
their abodes. They lack=20

the buildings and appliances necessary for the preparation of the little su=
gar and indigo that they=20

collect; and from that results the wretched and unreliable quality of those=
 articles which so=20

discredits them in the trade. They lack also the capital to incur the expen=
ses of a regular=20

plantation, and these enterprises require costly outlays at the start. But =
this cause of=20

backwardness would be remedied by the impulse which would be given to comme=
rce by the=20

exportation of native products, which would attract to agriculture the capi=
tal which it has hitherto=20

lacked, and by the special protection which the government can grant to lar=
ge capitalists who may=20

devote themselves to agriculture.  (3) From the ignorance of the Indians, n=
ot only of the various=20

methods of making plantations, but of the means of preparing the raw materi=
als for their=20

employment in the trade--a cause which is so universal and so mischievous t=
hat the agricultural=20

products of Filipinas, which ought to be, on account of their excellent cha=
racter and the extent of=20

territory of the islands, commodities which should supply all the markets o=
f Europe and hold the=20

first rank in quality, are the most scarce in general commerce, and moreove=
r lowest in price, as I=20

am going to prove by some instances. The sugar of Filipinas is today the mo=
st important=20

commodity for exportation which the commerce there includes. The cultivatio=
n of the sugar-cane=20

cannot be improved; but the manufacture of the sugar is so defective that, =
in spite of the superior=20

quality of the cane, the sugar which is produced from it is inferior to tha=
t which is called terciado=20

[i.e., brown] at Habana. Although in the market of Cadiz the white sugar fr=
om Habana is worth=20

thirty-two to twenty-five silver reals, and the brown sugar twenty-six to t=
wenty-eight, the white=20

sugar of Manila is worth twenty-four to twenty-five [152]--that is, nine si=
lver reals less than the=20

former, and two or three reals less than the latter on each arroba. Consequ=
ently, the temporary=20

privilege granted by his Majesty in exempting the products of Filipinas fro=
m duties is the only=20

support of the expeditions which have come [thence] to the Peninsula; and i=
t is unquestionable=20

that when that privilege ceases that commerce will likewise come to a compl=
ete stop. For if from=20



the twenty-four silver reals, the highest price at which an arroba of the M=
anila sugar can be sold,=20

be deducted for duties eight reals and twenty-seven maraveds, the trader wi=
ll receive a price of=20

only nineteen silver reals, five cuartos; subtracting from this the fourtee=
n and one-half reals of the=20

prime cost at Manila (according to the latest information received), and th=
e only profit left to him=20

would be four reals, three maraveds--with which it is absolutely impossible=
 for him to pay either the=20

heavy freight charges on that commodity, or the interest on money and the i=
nsurance premiums,=20

on a voyage three times as long as that from Habana. The low price [of suga=
r] in the market has=20

no other cause than the lack of skill at Manila for manufacturing the sugar=
; this art is there found=20

entirely in its infancy, and without any other method than that which, sinc=
e very ancient times, the=20

Chinese have taught them. [The sugar-makers have not proper machinery or ap=
pliances, or the=20

knowledge, for any of the stages of the process; and their product is infer=
ior, when it might be as=20

good as that of Habana--or even better, if the same skill and care were use=
d in making it as are=20

used there. The above profit of nine reals on the arroba, if equally divide=
d among the grower, the=20

manufacturer, and the government (for duties which in that case should be i=
mposed on the sugar),=20

would yield each of them $300,000 annually, on the estimated production of =
1,000,000 arrobas=20

which would be practicable for Filipinas--to say nothing of the increased b=
enefits to the laboring=20

class--with improved methods of manufacture. To secure this, the government=
 must be energetic=20

in promoting large establishments there, and introducing machinery and skil=
led laborers. "The=20

funds in the communal treasury of the Indians, which at the present time mu=
st reach about=20

$300,000, and whose object is the benefit of those same Indians," might aid=
 the government in=20

meeting the expenses of such measures; the skilled artisans could instruct =
the Indian farmers in=20

the new improved methods, and the industry would be almost perfected in two=
 years' time, at very=20

little expense. Bernaldez describes in similar manner the deficiencies, pos=
sibilities, and needs of=20

the indigo, coffee, and cacao industries, and urges the government to exten=
d like care to these;=20

what has been done thus far by the colonial government has been quite ineff=
ective, because it has=20

been in the form of proclamations and enactments which merely required smal=
l plantations to be=20

made by all the inhabitants, but these failed because they disregarded the =
principles of political=20

economy and made no provision for the individual interest of the cultivator=
.] There are, then, two=20

means which ought to be adopted for the promotion of large plantations in F=
ilipinas, incentive and=20

instruction; and for this it is necessary to grant pecuniary rewards to the=
 agriculturists, and furnish=20

them with teachers from the near-by islands of Java or even Bourbon, where =
not only coffee but=20

cacao is cultivated.  (4) And, finally, the cause which likewise exerts a p=
owerful influence in=20

[causing] the neglected and backward condition of agriculture is the slothf=
ulness of the Indians and=20

their absolute indifference to acquiring and keeping property. [This sloth =
is caused by the climate,=20

the abundant supply of the necessities of life with little labor, and the h=
ospitality which prevails=20

among the natives;] and if it were not that in the capital and its adjacent=
 provinces there has now=20

been introduced a certain degree of decency and [even] luxury in some famil=
ies of that class, it=20

would be difficult to find any one to render service or to practice the use=
ful arts that are necessary=20

in villages. [With a people like this, it would be hazardous to attempt to =
compel them to work; but=20

"even if they are naturally slothful, they have their likes and dislikes; a=
nd a wise government ought=20

to avail itself of these two powerful resources to urge them to work." The =
Indians dislike to pay=20

direct taxes, and hate the collector of these; also they are passionately f=
ond of cockfighting and=20



spectacles of all sorts, and of office-holding; and if these characteristic=
s are considered in the=20

policy of the government much can be done to make them industrious. Bernald=
ez recommends:=20

That a system of direct, unlimited, and regular commerce be established bet=
ween Espaa and=20

Filipinas, for the purpose of maintaining a reliable and definite annual ex=
portation of the latter's=20

products. That agricultural establishments be protected by the government, =
being allowed=20

(although at their own expense) the assistance of a band of irregular soldi=
ers. That machines,=20

tools, and other aids to agricultural production be admitted free of duties=
. That skilled workmen be=20

taken to the islands as instructors in the manufacture of sugar and indigo,=
 and cultivators of coffee,=20

etc., with their machinery and tools; their salaries for three years and th=
eir transportation to Manila=20

being paid from the communal funds of the Indians. That large rewards be pa=
id to the farmers who=20

shall make large plantations of coffee and other useful trees or establish =
the silk industry. That the=20

owners of these large plantations shall be allowed to keep on their lands e=
ach a cockpit for his=20

laborers, free of expense. That groups of Indians, Chinese, and mestizos, l=
imited to twenty=20

families each, who shall maintain an indigo or sugar plantation of a certai=
n extent in good=20

condition, shall be relieved from paying the tribute so long as the plantat=
ion is kept up. That every=20

Indian who works for wages during five consecutive years, to the satisfacti=
on of his employer, shall=20

be perpetually exempted from tribute, the employer paying the laborer's tax=
 for twenty years. That=20

the Indians and mestizos who cultivate large plantations on their own accou=
nt shall have the=20

preference for the offices in their respective villages. That the governmen=
t of Filipinas take=20

measures to avoid frauds in connection with these proposed changes.]    Of =
the anfion, or opium=20

[Bernaldez describes the efforts made by the English East India Company to =
import opium into=20

China, although against the will of the Chinese government, and states that=
 a certain amount is=20

smuggled into Manila to supply the Chinese settled in Filipinas; he suppose=
s that the prohibition of=20

this trade in the islands arose from the fear of the governors that the Ind=
ians would become=20

habitual users of this drug and thus be injured; but in his experience of s=
eventeen years in various=20

judicial positions in Filipinas he has never seen a scandalous case of opiu=
m inebriacy among the=20

Chinese of Luzon, nor any Indian brought into court for using the drug; and=
 "the Indians without=20

exception regard the use of opium with the utmost indifference and contempt=
." He thinks that it=20

should not be prohibited in Filipinas, since its use appears not to injure =
the Chinese there, or to be=20

necessary for the Indians; while the islands] ought not to be deprived of a=
 revenue that is=20

exceedingly lucrative for agriculture, commerce, and the treasury; of an ar=
ticle which in the order=20

of nature ought to be exclusively for the trade and benefit of the islands;=
 and a means by which the=20

Manila commerce would draw great wealth from China, turning in its favor, a=
nd with large sales,=20

the balance of trade with that empire, which is now and always has been aga=
inst Manila. A chest=20

of opium, weighing one pico of Filipinas or 100 cates of China (each of 22 =
onzas), would probably=20

cost the Manila grower for all expenses at most 100 pesos; and its value in=
 China is usually 1,400=20

to 1,600 pesos. Add to this advantage that of the large and secure market w=
hich Filipinas has=20

close at hand, since there would be annually consumed in China more than ei=
ght millions pesos'=20

worth of this article from the islands; this would permit all the extension=
 which they choose to give=20

to the cultivation of this article. And if 8,000 chests of opium produced i=
n Filipinas would yield in=20

China 12,000,000 dollars, the royal exchequer, which ought to secure its pr=
oportion of the great=20

advantages to agriculture and commerce, could without any difficulty load t=
hat product with a duty=20



so considerable that it would produce four to six millions of pesos a year.=
 [Bernaldez therefore=20

recommends: That the government, without abrogating the present prohibition=
 of the importation=20

and use of opium in the islands, give free permission to capitalists to cul=
tivate the poppy and=20

export opium from Filipinas; that the poppy-fields be close to the capital =
and enclosed; that the=20

harvest be superintended by trustworthy persons from the revenue service, a=
s is that of hardly=20

exchange it for a site less liable to earthquakes.  In December, 1811, when=
 the disturbances were=20

so great in the valleys of the Mississippi, Ohio and Arkansas, there was a =
sharp shock, which did=20

no especial damage. At this time there was a severe drought, which continue=
d during the=20

succeeding months; but no word of the disturbances to the North, or in St. =
Vincent, reaching the=20

people, they were not especially alarmed. So the days passed till Holy Week=
 came, and hundreds=20

were in the great churches.  At a few minutes past four there was a sudden =
shock which set=20

church-bells to ringing. Then came a second, which made the ground seem as =
though it were=20

boiling. This ceased, and the people supposed the danger was past, when the=
re came the fearful=20

subterranean roar but too well known in tropical countries, followed by ser=
ies of alternating shocks=20

at right angles to each other, and at once the beautiful city, with its pal=
aces and homes and works=20

of art was a shapeless ruin, with twelve thousand corpses lying amid the wr=
eck. Four thousand=20

people were slain in the churches alone. The great church of Alta Gracia, o=
ne hundred and fifty=20

feet in height, whose nave was supported by pillars fifteen feet in diamete=
r, was turned into a heap=20

of rubbish but five or six feet high. Nearly all had sunk in the earth. Sca=
rce a vestige of pillar or=20

column could be found. A regiment of infantry, mustered in San Carlos barra=
cks, was engulfed,=20

but few escaping. Nine-tenths of the town was annihilated.  [Illustration: =
SCENE AT CARACAS.]=20

Night came. The cloud of dust, that like a mist had risen from the wreck, h=
ad settled to the ground.=20

The full moon shone as calmly on the scene as in the past; and by the spect=
ral light were seen=20

strange figures hurrying to and fro. Here passed a mother with an infant=E2=
=80=99s corpse; while there a=20

father groped amid the wreck, and called by turns the names of wife and chi=
ld. No tools were left=20

in reach in all the town; bare-handed creatures grappled with the stony hea=
ps, and groaned in=20

answer to the moans beneath. The aqueducts were shattered and the springs w=
ere stopped; the=20

Guayra River was the sole supply. Scarce vessels could be found to fetch it=
 in. Here hurrying feet=20

bore wounded creatures to the stream; but lint and bandages were all beneat=
h the wreck. Two=20

thousand injured people lay upon the turf, with little of the needed help; =
but all their friends could=20

do was done. Not even food enough could be procured at first.  Then anguish=
-stricken souls=20

repented of their sins, and marched in procession that the wrath of God mig=
ht be changed to=20

mercy. Some driven to the verge of madness loudly confessed their sins in t=
he open streets. Some=20

promised to restore ill-gotten gains; often the peculation was known only t=
o themselves. Marriages=20

were solemnized between many who had hitherto not considered a ceremony nec=
essary. Children=20

were formally recognized by parents who had before repudiated them; long st=
anding feuds and=20

enmities were dropped.  Caracas was not the only place injured. La Guayra, =
Mayquetia, Antimano,=20

Baruta, La Vega, San Felipe, and Merida were totally destroyed. Five thousa=
nd deaths occurred at=20

San Felipe and La Guayra alone. It was impossible to give burial. Vast fune=
ral pyres were made=20

and corpse after corpse consigned to the flames. The total number of deaths=
 from the earthquake,=20

including those who perished from want and sickness induced by the exposure=
, was probably forty=20

thousand; some have estimated fifty thousand. The shocks were felt as far w=
estward as Bogota.  It=20



does not appear that any especial commotion was felt in Central America, th=
ough shocks in the=20

latter regions are nearly always felt in Venezuela or Columbia. Every porti=
on of Central America=20

has been repeatedly shaken. The town of Guatemala has been four times destr=
oyed, the people=20

each time selecting a new site and adhering to the old name. The people of =
San Salvador, on the=20

other hand, have obstinately clung to their site, though visited by violent=
 earthquakes in 1575,=20

1593, 1625, 1656, 1798, and 1839; and minor shocks are of such constant  [I=
llustration: RUINS=20

OF SAN SALVADOR.]  recurrence that the locality is nicknamed =E2=80=9Cthe h=
ammock.=E2=80=9D But the shock of=20

1889 was so severe that they seriously meditated leaving; but they finally =
settled in the old place,=20

when four-fifths of their town had just been destroyed.  But in Holy Week, =
in 1854, as Mr. Squier=20

tells us, unusual rumblings were heard on the morning of Holy Thursday. The=
 inhabitants,=20

somewhat alarmed, still went about their customary avocations. The remainde=
r of the week=20

passed without further cause for fear. At half past nine o=E2=80=99clock on=
 Sunday night a severe shock so=20

alarmed many people that they prepared to camp out for the night. At ten mi=
nutes to eleven there=20

came without any warning a fearful quaking, which levelled the city to the =
earth in ten seconds;=20

clouds of dust filled the streets; wells and fountains were choked; not a d=
rop of water could be=20

obtained. Not a house was left inhabitable; scarce one preserved the sembla=
nce of being erect;=20

yet the town was composed chiefly of low, one-story structures. The air was=
 filled with fumes of=20

sulphur; the neighboring volcano threatened an eruption; and in addition to=
 the usual horrors of an=20

earthquake, other features were added.  The ex-president of the republic wa=
s so badly hurt as to=20

be almost incapacitated for duty. Indians roamed pillaging the wreck, dropp=
ing on their knees and=20

praying as fresh shocks terrified them; then returning to the plunder; for =
they were good Christians.=20

Justice, police, clergy--all were gone. The venerable bishop, Soldana, when=
 dragged from the ruin,=20

bade the people flee in all haste, for =E2=80=9CGod had given the city over=
 to the Evil One as a punishment=20

for its sins; and in spite of the name it bore =E2=80=98(Holy Savior)=E2=80=
=99 it would be cast into the bottomless pit.=E2=80=9D=20

The good bishop promptly headed the retreat of the clergy from the forces o=
f Satan, evidently=20

under the impression that if the people could only leave the accursed local=
ity, the devil would not=20

be so scrupulously exact in tormenting them before the time. The people flo=
cked after the clergy in=20

large numbers, believing they would be safest in the neighborhood of the ho=
ly men. It is well=20

known that even the devil respects the cloth.  [Illustration: PEOPLE OF SAN=
 SALVADOR=20

FRIGHTENED.]  The republic had been rent by civil war for years; and in thi=
s critical juncture, it=20

seemed that it was about to be renewed. But a man of strong will and energy=
 and coolness=20

stepped forward--Duenas, ex-monk, lawyer, deputy, and president--from his f=
arm, like=20

Cincinnatus. Collecting a few friends and digging some arms from the wreck =
of the barracks, he=20

inspirited the new president, and martial law was proclaimed. The shooting =
of a few Indian robbers=20

imparted to the remainder a respect for law equalled only by their practica=
l Christianity, and the=20

work of rescue began. Large numbers of the populace permanently forsook the=
 site.  Two years=20

later there was a great earthquake in Honduras; but the area of disturbance=
 was not so densely=20

peopled, and the damage done was proportionately less. Disasters of this so=
rt cause most Central=20

Americans to emigrate. =E2=80=9CThen women and children form themselves int=
o groups and travel through=20

the country. They set the drama in which they have taken part to music, and=
 they go through the=20

country singing the rude verses which they have run together in the differe=
nt villages, and then=20

send the hat around. After they have visited the whole of their own country=
, they cross the frontier=20



into the neighboring State, where they are also assured of doing pretty wel=
l.=E2=80=9D  During three=20

centuries of Spanish occupation of South America, while scores of convulsio=
ns had visited the=20

Pacific seaboard, none had shaken the eastern slope of the Cordilleras, or =
the great plains=20

beyond; and there had resulted a settled belief that the entire region was,=
 so to speak,=20

earthquake-proof. But the illusion was rudely dispelled.  In the extreme we=
st of the Argentine=20

Republic, on the high road from Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres, lies the town o=
f Mendoza, in full view=20

of Tupungato and the mighty Aconcagua. Never having, in all their history, =
experienced any harm=20

from these mountains, the people anticipated none.  =E2=80=9CMendoza had ab=
out 20,000 inhabitants and=20

five hundred houses, nearly all of them very handsome. It also contained tw=
o very large hospitals,=20

several schools, a splendid cathedral, and several churches. Its trade was =
prosperous, and more=20

than a hundred large shops testified to the extent of its commerce. There w=
as no such library in=20

the whole of the Argentine Republic. Its theatre was most sumptuous, and th=
e Alameda, its public=20

promenade was regarded as the finest in South America.  [Illustration: SHOC=
K AT LAKE IN=20

HONDURAS.]  =E2=80=9COne evening, an immense red and blue meteor slowly tra=
versed the sky from East=20

to West, and the volcano of Aconcagua broke into an eruption upon the night=
 following--20th=20

March, 1861--without any premonitory sound or sign: the earth quaked violen=
tly, and in less than a=20

minute the town of Mendoza had disappeared. It was transformed into a vast =
field of ruins, the=20

highest of which were not more than three feet from the ground. Never withi=
n the memory of man=20

has a town been so taken by surprise; for in this case the earthquake was n=
ot preceded by the=20

underground mutterings which, even if only a few seconds in advance of the =
shock, give some sort=20

of warning. Upon that night, and in less than four seconds, fifteen thousan=
d people were buried in=20

the ruins. Horrible noises, cries of terror, the heartrending howls of men =
and animals filled the air,=20

and a thick cloud of dust darkened the sky.=E2=80=9D  Mendoza was not the o=
nly place injured. At San=20

Juan, one hundred miles northward, three thousand people were killed. Three=
 hundred and fifty=20

miles further away, Cordova lost a number of houses, and a slight shock was=
 felt at Buenos Ayres.=20

The wreck presented the scenes common in such cases; and, as in several sim=
ilar disasters,=20

bands of brigands pounced upon the town to pillage the ruins.  Of the many =
touching incidents, we=20

must give place to two:  That the town was absolutely unwarned is hardly co=
rrect. A French=20

geologist, M. Bravard, sent on a scientific mission by the Russian governme=
nt, had found the=20

volcanoes near by violently roaring, yet emitting no smoke or fire; and, ne=
aring the valley of=20

Mendoza, he found the soil in a constant tremor. Alarmed at these manifesta=
tions, he expressed=20

his belief that if the pressure were not speedily relieved by eruption, a s=
evere earthquake might=20

follow. His assertion caused serious apprehension, for his high attainments=
 gave his opinions=20

great weight with the people. For nearly a week the possibility of a catast=
rophe was seriously=20

discussed. One evening he stood at the door of M. Matussiere, wishing his f=
riends good-night.=20

Again he alluded to the earthquake--the shock came, and he was caught by th=
e fall of the house.=20

Matussiere himself was on his way home from Valparaiso. When fifteen miles =
from Mendoza, in=20

the mountains, a tremendous roaring was heard, but he felt no shock. The mo=
on shone as calmly=20

and clearly as ever, and no disturbance followed. Oppressed, however, by te=
rrible fear, he=20

hastened to Mendoza. He could not even guess where was the wreck of his own=
 home. After a=20

[Illustration: WRECK AT MENDOZA.]  long, despairing search, he saw his grea=
t house dog come=20

bounding toward him. The dog led him to the wreck; and, after wearisome toi=
l, the merchant found=20



his wife and one child alive. The rest of the family, and the French geolog=
ist, were dead.  Another=20

episode is related by M. Charton: There was at Mendoza a rich, French hotel=
 keeper, M. Tesser.=20

After the shock, =E2=80=9Cone of his intimate friends wandered among the ru=
ins. His eyes were dry: he=20

could shed tears no longer. He stopped on the site of the hotel, trying in =
vain to recall the old=20

arrangements. He was retiring--his heart filled with sighs, thinking of the=
 honest man and the=20

family he had loved so well--when he perceived, through the shapeless mass =
of girders and=20

calcined stones, M. Tesser=E2=80=99s dog, which moaned; he approached it. T=
he poor animal, the two hind=20

legs and part of the body of which were crushed, forced itself, in spite of=
 his sufferings and=20

weakness, to scratch with his front paws, and uttered, from time to time, a=
 plaintive howl. As it saw=20

its master=E2=80=99s friend come near, it exerted itself and howled louder.=
 The friend understood that=20

Tesser must be beneath this rubbish, and hoped he was not dead. He ran to f=
etch some persons,=20

and, with their help, after much labor, he indeed discovered the body of po=
or Tesser; his left arm=20

and leg, lying under the beams, were broken, his mouth and eyes full of ear=
th, but he still=20

breathed. Before trying to disengage his limbs, they washed his face, which=
 seemed to relieve=20

him; without saying a word, he instinctively stretched his right arm toward=
 his dog, who drew=20

himself to him, and died a few moments afterwards.  =E2=80=9CTesser scarcel=
y was in a state to pronounce=20

any words, before he asked where his family was. All had perished in the gr=
eat disaster. Hearing=20

this answer, he closed his eyes with despair; then, making a fresh effort, =
he pronounced the name=20

of his little girl, and showed with his finger a separate place where he ha=
d put her to bed. Some of=20

the people, in compassion for his grief, although without hope, made furthe=
r search; others=20

occupied themselves in dressing his broken limbs. A few minutes later, thos=
e rendering him this=20

service saw him suddenly raise himself up--he gave a cry--they brought him =
his daughter, still=20

living. A beam had fallen across the bed of the child and had protected it;=
 but she was seriously=20

wounded in the head; she had also her mouth and eyes filled with dirt, and =
was exhausted with=20

hunger.=E2=80=9D For two months the pair lay under a tent against a tree, m=
ore dead than alive. They only=20

remained to each other of the once rich and happy family. But in this respe=
ct, they were no worse=20

off than hundreds of others.  The people abandoned the site, unable to rema=
in in view of so many=20

monuments of former happiness. Strangers came in and a new Mendoza rose, bu=
t not so lovely=20

as the former one. This town was also severely shaken in 1885.  With a noti=
ce of one other=20

earthquake, which demands attention because of unusual results, this chapte=
r must close.  This=20

shock occurred August 13, 1868, in Peru. The center of the convulsion was a=
t Arequipa, at the=20

foot of the lofty volcanic mountain of Misti, which has not shown signs of =
activity since the great=20

outburst of 1542. So far as their volcanic neighbor was concerned, the fort=
y-four thousand people=20

of Arequipa had apparently no reason for apprehension.  At five minutes pas=
t five, there came a=20

light shock like the jar of a distant explosion. Half a minute later began =
the subterranean rumbling,=20

with a rapidly increasing vibration, which made the people run for their li=
ves into the streets. Then=20

=E2=80=9Cthe swaying motion changed into fierce, vertical upheaval. The sub=
terranean roaring increased in=20

a terrifying manner; then were heard the heart-piercing shrieks of the wret=
ched people, the=20

bursting of walls, the crashing fall of houses and churches, while over all=
 rolled thick clouds of a=20

yellowish-black dust, which, had they been poured forth many minutes longer=
, would have=20

suffocated thousands.=E2=80=9D  Tacna and Arica suffered little less. But t=
he greatest damage in the coast=20

region was from the sea wave. A few minutes after the shock, the sea rolled=
 back, falling twenty-



five feet; then a huge, black wall of water leaped up, fifty feet in height=
, and rushed for the shore.=20

The American vice-consul at Arica, well versed in the phenomena of earthqua=
kes, left his house at=20

the first shock, and ran with his family to the hills to avoid any probable=
 sea wave. The monster=20

billow struck the mole to pieces, and swept clean the lower part of the tow=
n. Six vessels were lost=20

in the bay, or tossed over rocks and houses; two, a Peruvian corvette and a=
 United States war-

ship, were carried inland and left high and dry, half a mile north of Arica=
, without a broken spar or=20

tarnished flag. Similar feats were recorded at Iquique. Twelve hundred mile=
s of sea-coast were=20

more or less affected. Sixty million dollars worth of property were destroy=
ed, and twenty thousand=20

people killed.  The great sea wave was especially remarkable. Recoiling fro=
m the Peruvian coast,=20

in three hours its southern expansion was observed at Coquimbo, eight hundr=
ed miles south. An=20

hour later it was at Constitucion, four hundred and fifty miles further. No=
rthward, the wave rushed,=20

sixty feet high, into the harbor of San Pedro, California, five thousand mi=
les from the shock.  To=20

the westward, the Sandwich Islands were reached that night, and irregular w=
aves broke upon the=20

coast for three=20


_
deposited in the magazines of the custom-house. That at the time of its exp=
ortation a duty of 25=20

per cent be collected on the value of the opium, at the prices current in C=
hina. That the concession=20

of raising opium should be granted by preference to the planters who alread=
y are maintaining=20

large plantations of sugar, indigo, coffee, and other useful products.]    =
Of the cotton manufactures=20

The Madrast commerce annually carries into Filipinas fabrics of cotton, cal=
led cambayas, to the=20

value of $300,000 to $350,000, a sum which the traders carry back to their =
own country in cash,=20

without taking away any natural or industrial product of Filipinas. Likewis=
e the Chinese carry into=20

the islands annually, by means of their champans, cotton fabrics with the n=
ames of manta Hipo,=20

Chuapo, and others, to the value of $300,000, nearly all of which sum they =
carry back to their own=20

country in cash. The Armenians of India and the Chinese had likewise the co=
ntrol, from the time of=20

the conquest of the islands, of importing into them annually the enormous q=
uantity of small cotton=20

articles [pauelos] and ordinary cambayas which the natives of the country c=
onsume, until=20

intercourse with those coasts was interrupted in the late war with Inglater=
ra. Then necessity and=20

the high price of those goods induced the natives of Filipinas to manufactu=
re them, and in such=20

abundance that the ships which arrived at Manila, after the peace, with tho=
se commodities=20

suffered great loss; and from that time the importation of those fabrics ce=
ased, and the natives=20

continued to manufacture them in the country. This has not been the case, h=
owever, with the fine=20

cambayas and kerchiefs from Madrast, nor with the cotton fabrics from China=
; for the former are=20

dyed with the beautiful and permanent Indian colors, furnished by certain p=
lants which are to this=20

day unknown in Filipinas, and the latter [are desired] on account of the ve=
ry low prices at which the=20

Chinese sell them. Thus, although various manufacturers of Manila have atte=
mpted to weave and=20

dye that class of goods, they have not obtained favorable results, and have=
 abandoned to the=20

Armenians and Chinese the exclusive provision of Filipinas with those commo=
dities. It seems=20

impossible that a colony in which is produced cotton of a quality superior =
to that of all the other=20

colonies in Asia, whose natives are industrious, and where the general cons=
umption of the country=20

offers a large and sure market for cotton fabrics, must be dependent for it=
s supply on foreign=20

manufacturers, and carry on with them a commerce which is one-sided [pasivo=
] and ruinous.=20

Nevertheless, the causes of this incongruity lie in the great population of=
 India and China as=20

compared with that of Filipinas, which causes the wages paid for the spinni=
ng of the thread (and it=20

is this item which increases or diminishes the cost of the woven goods) to =
be very low; in the=20

enormous crops of cotton which those countries produce as compared with tha=
t of Filipinas, which=20

abundance causes a diminution in the price of the raw material there; and, =
finally, in the superiority=20

of the dyes of India, which no colony has been able thus far to imitate.  I=
n order to compensate for=20

the cheapness of hand labor in the great populations of India and China, it=
 is necessary that in=20

Filipinas cotton-spinning machinery should be introduced, and that this pro=
ject be encouraged by=20

all means; that instructors in weaving and dyeing cambayas and kerchiefs be=
 taken thither from=20

Madrast, who shall at the same time introduce into Filipinas a knowledge of=
 the plants from which=20

the Oriental dyes are obtained, with the methods of planting and cultivatin=
g these--meeting this=20

expense from the communal funds of the Indians. [These measures, and the pr=
omotion already=20

urged for large plantations of cotton, would furnish employment to many nat=
ives of Filipinas, and=20

"place in circulation within the country itself the $650,000 which annually=
 are carried out of it in=20

hard money to foreign lands for the value of the cambayas and other fabrics=
 imported into it."=20



Moreover, a new and important line of goods would be added to the exports o=
f Filipinas in these=20

fine cotton fabrics, which would be equal to those of India and even cheape=
r; while the islands can=20

always supply their own coarse cottons much more cheaply than these can be =
manufactured in=20

Espaa, an industry which should therefore be fostered in Filipinas. These c=
oarse commodities=20

could thus be supplied also to broke upon the Marquesas and the Paumotu arc=
hipelago. At half-

past three in the morning it was at New Zealand. By daylight it was surging=
 along the coasts of=20

Australia, and by mid-day it was tossing even on the southwest coast of Aus=
tralia. The same day,=20

it was heaving on the shores of Japan.  [Illustration: THE GREAT SEA WAVE R=
EACHES CHILI.]=20

This wave is doubtless surpassed only by the great wave set in motion by th=
e convulsion of=20

Krakatoa, mentioned in the chapter on volcanoes. It travelled to a distance=
 of 10,500 miles from its=20

starting point, at a speed of from 400 to 500 miles an hour, according to t=
he direction. Yet it has=20

had several strong rivals. Had the great wave of 1867, at the time of the e=
arthquake at St.=20

Thomas, been raised in the open sea, instead of in the comparatively shut i=
n Caribbean, it might=20

have travelled to an equal distance. The sea wave which followed the earthq=
uake at Simoda,=20

Japan, in 1854, completely wiped out that town, leaving only fragments of a=
 temple-wall, and some=20

wrecked vessels, two miles inland. Most of the people perished. Recoiling f=
rom the coast, the=20

wave rolled in upon the shores of California, travelling 5,000 miles in twe=
lve hours.  The terrible=20

earthquake that ravaged Jamaica in 1692, produced a wave that swept thirty-=
three feet of water=20

over the highest house in Port Royal, destroying 3,000 persons. An English =
frigate, the _Swan_,=20

was deposited on the top of a large building, breaking in the roof. The wav=
es of the Lisbon and=20

Calabrian earthquakes have been noticed elsewhere.  This same district in P=
eru has suffered=20

similarly several times. Callao, with the ground on which it was built, was=
 swept away in 1746.=20

Only fifteen of its people ever reached Lima, six miles inland. When the to=
wn was rebuilt, a second=20

disaster of this sort nearly destroyed it. Iquique and Arequipa, in Peru, w=
ere again destroyed May=20

9, 1877; and a wave seventy feet high swept the coast, and recoiling reache=
d Japan next day,=20

travelling two hundred and eighteen yards per second.  The cases given illu=

urface. But few have been=20

given, nor have all the greatest been detailed. Mention only must suffice f=
or the one which shook=20

Naples and vicinity, December 5, 1456, destroying forty thousand people. An=
other in Persia, June=20

7, 1755, destroyed Kaschan, with forty thousand people; one at Cairo, Egypt=
, the preceding year,=20

killed twenty thousand. Another in the Abruzzi, Italy, November 3, 1706, ki=
lled fifteen thousand=20

persons; one at Palermo; Sicily, September 13, 1726, killed six thousand; o=
ne hundred thousand=20

perished in the Pekin earthquake of November 30, 1731; two thousand were de=
stroyed by an=20

earthquake in the Kutch district, India, in 1819. Constantinople was overtu=
rned in the year 1800;=20

six thousand people perished in an earthquake in Murcia, Spain, in 1829; fi=
fteen hundred were=20

killed by Italian earthquakes in 1835-36; Southern Syria suffered greatly i=
n 1836; Hayti was=20

shaken, and four thousand people perished, in 1842; one hundred thousand ho=
uses and thirty=20

thousand people destroyed by an earthquake in Japan, 1854; Montenerro, Cala=
bria, and ten=20

thousand people in 1857; five thousand people in Ecuador, 1859; Northwester=
n Khorassan,=20

Persia, with thirty thousand people, in 1871; Antioch again nearly destroye=
d in 1872; three=20

thousand people killed in Cashmere, 1885.  Terrible as this list seems, the=
 total but little exceeds=20

the havoc wrought by the single Bengal famine of 1866. There would be littl=
e difficulty in proving=20



that drought, with the consequent famine, has proved the most terrible agen=
t of destruction known=20

to man; and yet it is one that facilities for rapid transit should render l=
east destructive.  Scientific=20

men have within forty years made efforts to keep a sort of catalogue of sho=
cks; but the frequency=20

of earthquakes has rendered this a profitless task. Great ones are long rem=
embered; but as for=20

numbering the minor shocks, one might as well count rainfalls; several  [Il=
lustration:=20

EARTHQUAKE IN SPAIN.]  occur every day; and it is only when unusually destr=
uctive, like=20

extraordinary tempests, that they attract any attention; so that their bein=
g recorded depends even=20

more upon location than upon actual force.  All the phenomena of volcanoes =
and earthquakes=20

point us to one conclusion: that the earth may in time become as dead and d=
eserted as the moon.=20

The telescope shows the latter to be thickly=20


_
thus Spanish commerce would be liberated from its present dependence upon f=
oreign countries=20

for them, and the money paid for them would instead go into the hands of Sp=
aniards, in Spanish=20

possessions. To secure these ends, the government of Filipinas should be ca=
utious in imposing=20

import duties on the fine foreign goods, gradually increasing them accordin=
g to the ability of=20

Philippine manufacturers to displace foreign goods by native products. Bern=
aldez therefore=20

recommends: That encouragement and rewards be conferred on those who introd=
uce cotton-

spinning machinery; that instructors in weaving and dyeing be brought from =
India, as above=20

mentioned; that the manufacture of coarse volcanic craters, whose immensity=
, in comparison with=20

those of our own globe, is astounding; yet all are extinct. It is not proba=
ble that the interior of our=20

earth is molten; and we have seen that fractures and subsidence, caused by =
gradual cooling,=20

seem to be the main cause of the local phenomena of volcanoes and earthquak=
es. As the ages=20

roll on, these weak places may become still higher; and the belt of warm cl=
imate will grow=20

narrower and narrower. Cooling at the present rate, 2,500,000,000 years wil=
l be necessary to=20

render it as lifeless as the moon.  =E2=80=9CAs the cooling progresses, a s=
heet of snow and ice, from north=20

and south, will descend from the mountains upon the=20


_

increased; that raw cotton be permitted free exportation from the islands; =
and that the authorities=20

of the exchequer there confer on these matters with the local manufacturers=
 and merchants.]    Of=20

the means for establishing regular communication and frequent and permanent=
 mercantile=20

relations between Espaa and the Filipinas Islands.  [The writer urges the n=
ecessity of more=20

interest and care for the needs of the islands, and action by the Spanish g=
overnment in their=20

behalf, if they are to be retained as a Spanish possession. For this purpos=
e a regular commerce=20

with the islands should be maintained, sufficient to keep twelve ships in c=
onstant employment, six=20

sailing for the islands every year; and thus could be kept in efficient con=
dition the large force (more=20

than one thousand two hundred) of government employees in all the departmen=
ts of the island=20

service. He warns the ministry against plans which may be proposed by selfi=
sh interests and=20

intrigues, for leaving the islands in their present poverty and isolation f=
rom the mother country. The=20

commercial interests of the latter should unite to carry on this work, part=
ly for their own profit,=20

partly as a matter of patriotism. "The Filipinas Islands ought to be the ce=
nter of the Spanish=20

government's power in Asia, the great market for Spanish commerce," and the=
 source of=20

enormous revenues to the Spanish treasury; they should be to Espaa what Ind=
ia is to England,=20

and are even more capable, by their natural endowments, of being a source o=
f power and=20

opulence to the mother country. Spanish commerce is being greatly injured b=
y the restrictions laid=20

upon trade with the countries of Asia, and the treasury should adjust the d=

will undertake arctic expeditions to find again under the ice the place of =
Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux,=20
