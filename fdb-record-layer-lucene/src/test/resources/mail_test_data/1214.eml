ies. Natives," Stew=20

murmured.  "Brownies, all the same!" Jack insisted.  Stew tossed his catch =
upon a rock. "How'd=20

you like to wait until tomorrow for your fish?"  "Suits me," said Jack.  Th=
e fish did wait, and the two=20

boys sat down to enjoy a feast such as they had not eaten in months.  "Do y=
ou know, Stew," Jack=20

said as he reclined against a rock, with the blue-black sea before him, "I =
think we picked the wrong=20

party to help us get off this island."  "What do you mean?" Stew sat up.  "=
Those natives have some=20

swell outrigger canoes that would take us to some other island in less than=
 an hour," Jack=20

confided. "I saw them. They're really fast."  "And then we'd just be on ano=
ther island," Stew=20

drawled. "What I want is to be sitting on the flight deck of our ship heari=
ng the engines warming=20

up. Or I'd like to be down below where jazz music and radios make night hil=
arious on the old=20

_Black Bee_."  "All the same, I'd feel better if I were sure I could leave =
this island in a hurry if I=20

needed to," Jack insisted.  "Tell you what!" He sprang to his feet. "This f=
east of ours came from the=20

native village. It's a peace offering. What do you say we go and smoke a pi=
pe of peace with=20

them?"  "Oh-o-o no! Not me!" Stew did not move. "They might not be as civil=
ized as you think.=20

Don't forget that girl and the nurse's costume. Besides, I've got something=
 else I want to do."=20

"What's that?"  "Try out that radio we found on the Jap raft."  "I cranked =
it for an hour last night."=20

Jack's interest was slight. "Not a peep out of it. But go ahead, try it."  =
"Sure I'll try it." Stew walked=20

away. "Give my regards to that head-hunter's queen," he added, with a low l=
augh. "She's a regular=20

pin-up girl, don't you think? Tell her to put a ring in her nose and I'll t=
ake her picture."  Jack joined=20

in the laugh. Then, after tucking his violin under his arm, he trudged away=
 into the dark forest and=20

over the trail leading to the village.  Guided by his pinpoint flashlight h=
e followed the leafy trail,=20

where his steps made no sound, and listened to the croak of a great frog th=
at seemed to say,=20

"Why? Why?" He dropped down into a valley, where some startled porkers went=
 snorting away,=20

then climbed again to cross the ridge and come down on the other side.  "Sp=
ooky business,=20

following these trails at night," he told himself. "Anything might happen."=
  When he found himself=20

close to the native village, he went on tiptoe until the light of their cam=
pfire, burned down to a dull=20

glow, was practically in his eyes.  No feast now. It was too late for that.=
 The natives were seated in=20

a half circle. Close by the fire sat a stout young hunter. His fine brown f=
ace, with its gleaming white=20

teeth, was a study. He was smiling broadly as jokes were passed back and fo=
rth. Before him lay a=20

freshly killed pig. He had returned late from the hunt, no doubt, and was r=
ecounting his=20

adventures. The others with one exception appeared happy. The tall, slim gi=
rl sat by herself. On=20

her face was a look of loneliness, perhaps of sadness. The people were talk=
ing in their strange=20

native tongue. The girl did not speak at all.  Then Jack did something that=
 even to him seemed=20

strange. Slipping silently through the brush, he came close to the girl and=
, current may be diverted=20

from them to the gas or water pipes or to any other conductors which come i=
nto contact with them=20

or can attract to themselves a portion of their current. Severe shocks have=
 been experienced by=20

persons attempting to draw water at their faucet from causes of this charac=
ter. At the same time,=20

so far as mere safety is concerned and freedom from electrical accidents, i=
t would seem that=20

underground wires are preferable to overhead wires.  Electrical wires have =
not infrequently come=20

in contact with telegraph and telephone wires causing unpleasant results. T=
elephone boxes have=20

been set on fire, and also telegraph boards and tables, and in certain case=
s what might have been=20

serious conflagrations have been started in this manner. By means of proper=
 arrangements on the=20



telegraph and telephone circuits these dangers can be at least partially av=
oided, but there is=20

always the risk that the automatic alarms and other contrivances do not act=
, and the still greater=20

one that persons or things may come into contact with these charged wires a=
nd receive dangerous=20

or serious injuries.  =3DElectric Cars.=3D=E2=80=94The danger from the over=
head wires in the trolley system of=20

electric cars would not be great were these wires properly supported, prope=
rly insulated, and=20

properly protected. Each of these terms must be explained. Wires which fall=
 for any cause=20

whatever short of being intentionally removed cannot be deemed properly sup=
ported in the sense=20

in which we use the term. Any one of these electric wires which falls is li=
able to produce serious=20

injury to persons or animals (many horses have been killed by them), or to =
set fire to objects with=20

which it comes into immediate or indirect contact, the amount of injury bei=
ng in part dependent=20

upon the nature and the condition (wet or dry) of the object and its positi=
on in relation to other=20

conductors. Wires as dangerous as these car wires should be so supported th=
at no ordinary=20

accident, no condition of the weather, strong winds, or heavy falls of snow=
 should be capable of=20

wrenching them from their supports, and they should be placed in such posit=
ions and with such=20

protection as not to receive blows from passing or falling objects.  Second=
ly, these wires should be=20

properly insulated. This is to be understood to mean that all the wires whi=
ch carry the electric=20

current, or are liable to carry it, should be attached to their poles or ot=
her support in such a manner=20

that no appreciable quantity of electricity is under any circumstances liab=
le to be diverted to the=20

poles or supports, and in this way cause destruction or injury. In addition=
 to this the side wires=20

should be so covered that if any accident occurs, it will be difficult or i=
mpossible for the current to=20

pass away from them to other objects. The middle wire on which the trolley =
runs cannot be thus=20

covered, but must be left bare, and hence, if knocked down or brought into =
contact with properly=20

conducting objects, must be the most dangerous; but on the other hand from =
its position it is less=20

liable to accidents.  When we say that these wires should be properly prote=
cted we mean that=20

such arrangements and contrivances should be used as will prevent them whil=
e in their usual=20

position from coming into contact with dangerous objects, particularly with=
 other wires.=20


_
half in shadow, unnoticed, took a seat beside her.   At that same moment, t=
wo hundred miles=20

away, Kentucky, Blackie, and Red were out over the sea in their planes. Hav=
ing obtained=20

permission to conduct a night search for their lost comrade Ted, they were =
on their way. Talking=20

over a radio of very low power that was not likely to be picked up at any d=
istance greater than 300=20

miles, Blackie was saying to the others:  "Just about ten seconds more and =
we should be near the=20

spot."  "Twenty or twenty-five is my guess," said Kentucky.  "Be great stuf=
f if Ted were still on his=20

plane there in the water and picked us up on the radio," Red suggested.  "N=
o chance." Kentucky's=20

voice was low. "He's lucky if he's got his rubber raft."  Ted did not hear =
them, but someone else,=20

vastly excited, did.  "Got 'em!" Stew, on the island, tinkering with the Ja=
p radio, cranked furiously=20

as he murmured. "Now if only I can make them hear me.  "Kentuck--Kentucky!"=
 he called into the=20

small mike. "This is Stew. Do you get me? Stew. Come in!"  Kentucky did not=
 come in. He kept=20

right on with what he was doing. Stew could hear the three of them talking,=
 heard Red say, "I think=20

I see a light off to the right."  "You sure?" was Kentucky's excited answer=
. "Don't lose it. That may=20

be Ted."  "It's sure to be Ted," Blackie broke in. "Don't lose it."  Just t=
hen Stew's Jap radio took on=20

a sudden burst of power to break through space and fall on Kentucky's ears:=
  "Kentuck! This is=20

Stew! Come in, Kentucky!"  Kentucky heard, and sat up quickly.  "Stew! Wher=
e are you?"=20

Kentucky came back in a steady drawl. "Where's Jack?"  "We--well, you might=
 say we're back in=20

the old home town." Stew made up a code as he went along. He didn't want th=
ose fellows on the=20

jet plane to understand, nor some prowling Japs, either. "Remember those th=
ree houses? Do you=20

get me?"  "Maybe I do," Kentucky growled. "Continue."  "Well, I live in the=
 biggest house--the=20

middle one--three stories--get me?"  "I get you." Kentucky thought he under=
stood that Stew was=20

talking of three islands.  "Jack is with me," Stew went on. "Our room is in=
 the southwest corner.=20

See?"  "I get you," Kentucky came back again. "All okay?"  "Yes. Only we mi=
ss our boat. We--"=20

Just then Stew heard Blackie break in. "Kentucky, there is a light. Must be=
 Ted. I'm putting on my=20

landing lights. Going down."  "We'll be right over you," Kentucky assured h=
im.  Stew understood it=20

all, and was silent, even at a time when he wanted terribly to talk. And so=
, as he listened, the=20

minutes ticked themselves away, and once again his radio went dead. Far awa=
y, Kentucky was=20

thinking, "I wish Stew had talked straight. I think he meant he was on the =
biggest of those three=20

islands, and on this end of it. But how's a fellow to be sure?"            =
                      CHAPTER XVIII=20

LUCK, PALS, AND PROVIDENCE   Scarcely had Jack seated himself beside the sl=
im girl in the=20

shadows away from the campfire when she whispered:  "I hoped you'd come. I =
have something=20

tremendously important to show you. First you must play for these people, f=
or they love it."  At that=20

she clapped her hands and at the same time gave a sharp exclamation. Some n=
ative word,=20

thought Jack. He was startled by this sudden turn of affairs.  The natives =
were on their feet in an=20

instant. Three brown warriors, doubtless misunderstanding the call, seized =
their spears.  Like=20

figures done in bronze, with the firelight playing on their dark faces, the=
se three stood there, silent=20

and alert, ready for action, as the girl said a few words to them in their =
own language. Then the=20

men relaxed and a low murmur ran round the campfire.  "Play now!" the girl =
commanded, turning=20

to Jack.  A louder murmur came from the natives as they settled back in the=
ir places and Jack=20

tuned his violin.  Deciding that some simple tunes would suit these people =
best, the boy played=20

"Turkey in the Straw." Pleased by their dancing eyes, he did the "Arkansas =
Traveler," then "Deep=20

in the Heart of Texas."  When he swung into "Old Man River," the natives se=
emed to sense the=20



meaning of the song, for their faces were somber and sad. But now some one =
was singing the=20

words.  He listened carefully. It was the girl who sang.  "Sing it all," he=
 whispered. He started once=20

more at the beginning and she sang with him to the end.  After that he play=
ed on and on,=20

wondering, Where did this girl learn that song? She had said, "These people=
." Were they not her=20

people? It was mighty strange.  When the fire had burned low and some of th=
e native children=20

were asleep at their mothers' sides, Jack put his violin away. Then, as if =
he were in church and=20

had preached a good sermon, the older members of the group came forward for=
 a solemn=20

handshake.  After a few words to the natives, the girl turned to Jack. "I'l=
l show you a new way back=20

to your camp," she said in a quiet voice.  A moment later, without a light,=
 she was leading him=20

through the inky blackness of a jungle trail.  "There are only two of us, m=
y pal and I," Jack said to=20

the girl after a time. "We may get into a tight spot any time!"  "Oh, you a=
re in a tight spot right=20

now!"   In the meantime, some distance to the south, things were happening =
on the dark waters of=20

night. Catching the drone of airplane motors and recognizing them as those =
used in U. S. fighter=20

planes, Ted on his raft had become greatly excited. That's Kentucky and my =
other pals, he=20

thought. They're out looking for me. How can I signal to them?  A flare. Th=
e thought came to him=20

at once. In his emergency outfit were matches in a sealed tin. With trembli=
ng fingers he opened=20

the can.  But what could he use for a torch? He thought of his gony. Its fe=
athers would burn. But=20

no. He couldn't do that. His parachute? Yes, it would burn. But what a wast=
e. If other things failed,=20

he'd use it. But meanwhile he'd tie his shirt to one of the paddles and lig=
ht it. He wadded it tightly=20

around the paddle blade so it would burn for some time. He lighted it, and =
moved it about in the=20

air.  "It makes so little light. They'll never see it," he despaired.  But =
they did see it. Soon Kentucky=20

came zooming down while the others circled above him.  "Boy! Am I glad to s=
ee you!" Ted put out=20

a hand to guard wires or in other ways. It is plainly of great importance t=
hat this should be specially=20

cared for, and particularly in a city where there are many overhead wires, =
and perhaps a=20

considerable number of dead or non-used wires. If the electricity comes int=
o contact with one of=20

these no one can tell where it may be transmitted or what harm it may do.  =
The principles which=20

apply to these overhead wires of course apply _ceteris paribus_ to all othe=
r electric overhead=20

wires, and in like manner the statements made in regard to the diffusion or=
 spreading of currents in=20

underground wires are applicable to all methods of transmitting electricity=
 mechanically through=20

the ground so far as the conditions are similar. An electric current will a=
lways follow the path of=20

best conduction, and where several paths are opened it will follow them pro=
portionally according to=20

the excellence of their conduction or inversely to the amount of their elec=
tric resistance.  We shall=20

not enter here into any questions in regard to the diffusion of electricity=
, its transmission through=20

fluids, water, air or other gases, nor shall we discuss the relations of go=
od or bad conductors to=20

electricity except so far as this relates to certain portions of the human =
body. An elementary=20

knowledge of physics and electricity must be presupposed.  We can now enter=
 more directly upon=20

the immediate subject of this article, that is, the effect upon the human b=
ody of severe or=20

moderately strong currents of electricity derived from artificial sources. =
The accidents produced by=20

these currents may be divided into two classes, the direct and the indirect=
. Under the direct we=20

place all those conditions which are apparently produced by the action of t=
he electricity itself, such=20

as the general shock, the loss of consciousness, the burns, etc. On the oth=
er hand, all those=20

accidents are to be considered indirect which are not primarily due to the =
action of the electric=20



current, but are only secondary results thereof. These are largely determin=
ed by the immediate=20

surroundings and conditions at the time. Such, for example, are the surgica=
l injuries due to falls=20

caused by the loss of consciousness produced by the electric shock.   INDIR=
ECT ACCIDENTS.=20

These will be considered first, as they do not demand so detailed a descrip=
tion as the direct. They=20

are traumatic in character and are the result either of loss of consciousne=
ss, momentary or lasting,=20

or of the involuntary muscular contraction which may be occasioned by the e=
lectric shock. They=20

are among the most frequent effects of severe electric shocks. These accide=
nts consist in=20

contusions, fractures, dislocations, wounds, and any other injuries which m=
ay be produced from=20

sudden loss of consciousness while in a dangerous position. Death may readi=
ly occur either=20

immediately or as the more or less delayed result of such injuries. If the =
person shocked falls into=20

the water he may be drowned, or if into the fire he will be burnt. The vari=
eties of such accidents=20

dependent on the sudden loss of consciousness produced by the electricity a=
re, of course,=20

innumerable, and their occurrence must largely depend upon the position of =
the victim at the=20

moment of the shock. We see, perhaps, most of these accidents in linemen on=
 the tops of poles or=20

houses or in other exposed places, but persons who receive shocks when simp=
ly standing on the=20

ground or when sitting are not exempt from severe surgical injuries other t=
han burns. They are=20

often cast to the ground with great violence, and not infrequently are thro=
wn to a distance of=20

several feet. This is caused by the violent muscular contraction produced b=
y the electric shock,=20

and it may occasion, like any violent push or fall, severe injuries from co=
ntact with the various=20

objects against which they may be forced. Although much rarer, it is also p=
ossible that the violence=20

of these muscular contractions may be such as of themselves to cause injury=
, as rupture of a=20

muscle or tendon. As practically all these indirect accidents are traumatic=
 and surgical in=20

character, they do not differ from other accidents similar in kind, but oth=
erwise caused, and are to=20

be treated on the same general principles as these.   DIRECT ACCIDENTS.  Qu=
ite different from=20

the indirect are the direct accidents; those produced by the immediate (dir=
ect) action of the=20

electricity. These are of various kinds, which we shall consider separately=
. They may be divided=20

into immediate and late symptoms, and they vary much according to the sever=
ity of the shock and=20

the constitution of the patient, and the part of the body through which the=
 electricity passes. The=20

character of the current which gives the shock, whether constant or interru=
pted, also naturally has=20

an influence on the effect.  =3DGeneral Principles.=3D=E2=80=94A shock may =
be given in three ways with an=20

ordinary galvanic battery. If the current be sufficiently strong, a distinc=
t shock will be produced=20

when the circuit is closed and again when the circuit is opened, while with=
 a current of the usual=20

strength for medical purposes, the sensation while the current is passing t=
hrough the body steadily=20

is much less and is often limited to a sensation of burning at the seat of =
the electrode. A shock=20

may also (thirdly) be produced by a reversal of the current, and the shock =
thus caused is stronger=20

for the same current than that produced in either of the other ways.  The s=
trength of these shocks=20

is shown both by the sensation produced and by the amount of muscular contr=
action caused.=20

When now a shock is caused by a continuous or constant current which starts=
 from an ordinary=20

dynamo or other electric generator or storer, it is practically always caus=
ed by the opening or=20

closing of the circuit, or, what is essentially the same, the diversion of =
a part or the whole of the=20

current from its proper path to and through some portion of the human body =
causes a shock at the=20

time of the entrance of the body into the circuit and another at the time o=
f its exit therefrom.=20



Shocks from reversal of current when such current arises from a constant ma=
chine might occur,=20

but only through some peculiar accident. Hence the shocks (distinguished fr=
om any other effects=20

of electricity) which are received=20

plane was down and he had paddled to it.  "That makes two of us!" Kentucky =
gripped his hand=20

excitedly.  "I'll be with the old _Black Bee_ after all when we make that b=
ig push!" Ted exulted.=20

"You won't be in anything if you don't get busy and climb up here!" Kentuck=
y laughed.  "Wait. I'll=20

have to take care of my gony." Ted reached down.  "Hey! Ouch! Quit it!" he =
exclaimed. "Ungrateful=20

creature! I should have used you for a torch."  "What is it?" Kentucky aske=
d in surprise.  "Just a=20

gony--an albatross," said Ted. "He lit on my head and now he bites me for t=
he tenth time. Give me=20

a light."  Kentucky held a light on it while Ted cut the strap that held th=
e huge bird. Then he tossed=20

the gony into the sea. "I was keeping it for emergency rations," he laughed=
.  Five minutes later he=20

was in the plane, and they were roaring away. "Just one more incident in th=
e great war," Ted said.=20

"Some get rescued and some don't."  "It's all a matter of luck," said Kentu=
cky.  "Providence, luck,=20

and pals," Ted added.  "There's more work of the same kind to be done," sai=
d Kentucky. "I think=20

I've got Jack and Stew located on one of those three islands."  "Great stuf=
f! How did you do it?"=20

"Stew's got some kind of radio. Not very strong, but I got him. He told me =
in a sort of code that=20

they were on this end of the biggest island."  "That's swell!" Ted exclaime=
d. "Going after them is=20

my job. Jack's from my home town."  "Say! That's keen!" said Kentucky. They=
 flew on.   At the=20

same time, on the island, with the aid of the girl, Jack was making a start=
ling discovery. She=20

walked with surprising speed over the jungle trail. Only now and then did s=
he take his hand for an=20

instant to whisper, "Over a log here" or "Up a low ledge now."  "I didn't w=
ant the natives to know,"=20

she murmured low. "There might have been trouble if they saw what you are g=
oing to see. I didn't=20

want a fight--not now."  "Know what?" Jack wanted to ask, but did not. What=
 a queer girl this was!=20

Her skin was dark, her nose was rather broad, and her lips seemed thick, ye=
t she was surely not=20

like the others.  "Been raised by some missionary," he told himself. He kne=

there were such girls. He had seen some of them in the Solomons. Some were =
nurses. He thought=20

"Up now," she whispered, gripping his hand.  They climbed are felt only at =
the moment of entering=20

the circuit (closure) and of leaving it (opening). If a person introduces h=
imself between the two=20

wires of an electric circuit in which a constant current is used, in such a=
 manner as to cause the=20

current to pass through his body, he will feel the shock only at the moment=
 when he touches the=20

second wire and completes the circuit, and at the moment when he lets go on=
e of the wires and=20

opens the circuit (unless the current be so strong or be so placed that he =
can divert to himself=20

sufficient electricity to cause a shock, or, in other words, close a second=
ary circuit in some other=20

way). While the current is passing through the body, although it may burn a=
nd cause tingling and=20

other unpleasant symptoms, there is no proper shock. In other words, an ele=
ctric shock is caused=20

only by a _change_ in the amount of electricity passing through the body or=
 a portion thereof.  If=20

we now consider the effects of =3Dalternating currents=3D, we find that we =
have another factor to deal=20

with. The general principles are exactly the same, but inasmuch as the reve=
rsal shock is stronger=20

than the closure or opening shocks, other things being equal, we are likely=
 to receive a stronger=20

shock from a current of the same force, and in addition to this, as in alte=
rnating machines the=20

reversals occur with considerable rapidity, the person who becomes connecte=
d with this circuit=20

receives a number of strong shocks within a short space of time. This is a =
much more serious=20

matter than to permit a current of equal strength to flow through the body =
without change.  =E2=80=94The=20

effect of this form of electricity on the human body is first stimulating a=
nd then tetanizing to the=20



muscles. It consists in a very rapidly interrupted current, the shocks bein=
g at times so frequent that=20

they are not singly perceptible. There is probably also a distinct differen=
ce in the action of this=20

current from that of the galvanic current aside from its rapid interruption=
. This is not, however, of=20

so defined a character as to enable us at the present time to distinguish i=
n man the results of=20

severe injuries and deaths caused by this form from those caused by other s=
trong currents.=20

Practically this form of current is but little used, except in medical batt=
eries and for the purposes of=20

experimentation in laboratories.  =3DStatic electricity=3D has, so far as w=

. Almost directly=20

beneath them, surprisingly close and all lit up by a near-by campfire, was =
the mystery plane.=20

Seated around the fire were not two men, but five. Three were small, the ot=
hers large. Just then=20

the two large men stood up. One was tall and rather thin, the other short a=
nd stout.  "Not the same=20

men!" Jack whispered in astonishment.  "No, they're not," she agreed. "The =
three little men are=20

Japs."  "Japs!" Jack could feel prickles at the back of his neck. "What doe=
s it mean?"  "Danger!"=20

came in a low whisper.                                   CHAPTER XIX       =

DEEPEN   Standing beside the girl of "Mystery Isle," Jack stared down at th=
e five men and the jet=20

plane in silence. "Here's a ticklish situation," he thought. He was glad he=
 had established friendly=20

relations with the natives. He and Stew, with only their sidearms, would be=
 no match for those five=20

men.  Jack's amazement at this turn of affairs was great. He had been incli=
ned to accept the men=20

who first had the jet plane as Englishmen or Australians trying out a secre=
t weapon. One thing was=20

sure. This plane was no haphazard affair built from parts of other planes. =
It was sometimes=20

caused burns, and it is conceivable that a strong electric current produced=
 in this way might be=20

dangerous. The symptoms could not be distinguished from those caused by oth=
er forms of=20

electricity.  =3DSummary.=3D=E2=80=94The greatest source of danger from ele=
ctric currents is the shock=20

produced by them. In ordinary constant or continuous currents this is produ=
ced only at the moment=20

of the opening and the closure of the circuit. In alternating currents a sh=
ock is also produced at=20

each reversal of the machine. Faradic and static currents are rarely or nev=
er used mechanically or=20

in the arts.  =3DResistance.=3D=E2=80=94The resistance of the human body to=
 electric currents has been very=20

variously estimated.  The reasons for these variations are: (1) that the di=
fferent tissues present=20

different resistances; (2) that the resistance in the same tissue varies gr=
eatly under different=20

circumstances.  The tissue which offers the greatest resistance and also pr=
actically the greatest=20

variation is the skin, or, more properly speaking, the epidermis. The resis=
tance of this is many=20

times as great as that of the rest of the body, and when perfectly dry it i=
s impervious to currents of=20

great strength. Witz states that in using a Ruhmkorf coil with an estimated=
 force of 250,000 volts=20
