g and laughter from=20

below testified that that hideous creature Friche and his mate had put thei=
r project in immediate=20

execution; she turned and ran down the stairs--feeling now like an animal a=
t bay; by the time that=20

she had reached the bottom, she heard a prolonged, hoarse cry of triumph fr=
om below and=20

guessed that Paul Friche and his mate had reached the window-sill: the next=
 moment there was a=20

crash overhead of broken window-glass and of furniture kicked from one end =
of the room to the=20

other, immediately followed by the sound of heavy footsteps running seized =
from behind, and=20

dragged from the brink of the precipice.  Swift as the hunted stag springs =
from his covert, and=20

bounds over every obstacle with speed and apparent ease, so sprang the chie=
f of the Nor'-westers=20

down the rugged path which led to the foot of the series of rapids, and the=
 lower end of the=20

portage.  There was good grit in the man, morally and physically, for he wa=
s bent on a rescue=20

which involved considerable danger.  Throwing off his capote, and tightenin=
g his belt, he stood on=20

a ledge just below the last fall, intently watching the water.  The fall wa=
s not high, but it was deep,=20

and rushed into a large dark basin=20


_
Yvonne, half-crazed with terror, faint and sick, fell unconscious over the =
body of her father.   V=20

Inside the tap-room commandant Fleury was still at work.  "Your name?"  "Wh=
ere do you live?"=20

"Your occupation?"  The low room was filled to suffocation: the walls lined=
 with Marats, the doors=20

and windows which were wide open were closely guarded, whilst in the corner=
 of the room,=20

huddled together like bales of rubbish, was the human cattle that had been =
driven together,=20

preparatory to being sent for a trial to Paris in vindication of Carrier's =
brutalities against the city.=20

Fleury for form's sake made entries to circulate round its edges.  In a few=
 moments the form of=20

Dan was seen to shoot down the fall and disappear in the basin.  The chief =
stooped, but did not=20

spring until, not far from him, the apparently inanimate form reappeared on=
 the surface and began=20

to circle slowly round among the flecks of foam.  Then he plunged, swam out=
 with powerful=20

strokes, and quickly returned to the shore with Dan in his grasp.  Soon the=
y were surrounded by=20

the other voyageurs, who had left La Certe to look after himself,--not cari=
ng much, in the=20

excitement of the moment, whether he escaped or not.  "He is dead," said on=
e; "he=20


_
mere farce--these wretched people were not likely to get a fair trial--what=
 did the whole thing=20

matter? Still! the commandant of the Marats went solemnly through the farce=
 which Carrier had=20

invented with a view to his own justification.  Lemoine and his wife had pr=
otested and been=20

silenced: men had struggled and women had fought--some of them like wild ca=
ts--in trying to get=20

away. Now there were only half a dozen or so more to docket. Fleury swore, =
for he was tired and=20

hot.  "This place is like a pest-house," he said.  Just then came the sound=
 of that lusty cry of=20

triumph from outside, followed by all the clatter and the breaking of windo=
w glass.  "What's that?"=20

queried Fleury.  The heavy footsteps running down the stairs caused him to =
look up from his work=20

and to call briefly to a sergeant of the Marats who stood beside his chair:=
  "Go and see what that=20

_sacre_ row is about," he commanded. "In there," he added as he indicated t=
he door of the=20

landing with a jerk of the head.  But before the man could reach the door, =
it was thrown open from=20

within with a vigorous kick from the point of a sabot, and Paul Friche appe=
ared under the lintel with=20

the aristo wench thrown over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes, his thic=
k, muscular arms=20

encircling her knees. His scarlet bonnet was cocked over one eye, bruised a=
nd cut."  "And his=20

chest, too," said another.  "I think his ribs have been broken. Poor fellow=
!  It was a wild, a reckless=20

jump!"  "Keep back, and let him have air," said the chief, who was doing hi=
s best, according to his=20

knowledge, to resuscitate Dan.  Presently La Certe arrived, panting.  "O! h=
e is gone!  My comrade,=20

my friend, is dead!" he exclaimed, clenching his hands, and gazing at the p=
ale, bruised face.  "You=20

are wrong," exclaimed the chief, testily.  "Out of the way, man! See! his e=
yelids quiver."  And so=20

they did; and so also quivered his lips, and then a sigh came-- faint and f=
eeble--then stronger, and=20

at last Dan opened his eyes and thanked God that his life had been spared. =
 But when he=20

recovered sufficiently to realise his true position as being again a captiv=
e, the feeling of despair=20

returned.  That night they encamped a mile above the upper end of the porta=
ge.  At supper the two=20

prisoners were allowed to sit by the camp-fire and eat with their hands fre=
e.  "Monsieur," said the=20

guide to Dan, respectfully, "you see it is impossible to escape.  Why compe=
l us to bind you?  Give=20

me your word of honour that you will not try, and your limbs may then remai=
n as free as mine."  "I=20

give you my word of honour," answered Dan, with a sardonic smile, "that til=
l after breakfast=20


_
his breeches were torn at the knees, his shirt hung in strips from his powe=
rful shoulders. Behind=20

him his mate--who had climbed up the gutter-pipe into the house in his wake=
--was tottering under=20

the load of the ci-devant duc de Kernogan's body which he had slung across =
his back and was=20

holding on to by the wrists.  Fleury jumped to his feet--the appearance of =
these two men, each=20

with his burden, caused him to frown with anger and food; but after that, I=
 give you my word that I=20

will never cease to try."  With this promise the guide was fain to rest con=
tent, and that night Dan=20

and his friend were allowed to sleep untethered, which they did soundly.  N=
ext morning they were=20

roused in gentler tones than usual, and not required to work--as had been t=
he case hitherto--

before breakfast.  In short, there was an evident change in the feelings of=
 their captors=20
