 In looking over the areas of volcanic action, we will find they have chang=

the interior it is sometimes as low as 68 in the mornings, which are remark=
ably cool, so much so=20

as to require at time$ woolen clothing. None of the mountains are within th=
e limits of perpetual=20

congelation; but I think some cannot be far from it, as I have seen somethi=
ng much resembling=20

snow prove that the shocks necessarily originate at a comparatively short d=
istance below the=20

surface. So, from two independent lines of investigation, the same conclusi=
on is reached.  These=20

objections have caused inquiry to be made as to what causes might locally d=
evelop heat. Here=20

be higher ones in the interior of Magindanao. [38]  Both natives and Spania=
rds live to a tolerable=20

age, in spite of the indolent habits of the latter, and the debauches of bo=
th. The Spaniards are=20

most commonly carried off by chronic dysentery, which is called by them "la=
 enfermedd del pays"=20

(the illness of the country): from its very frequent occurrence, at least 7=
 out of 10 of those who=20

exceed the age of 40, fall victims to this disorder. [39] Acute liver compl=

expected to unite. One is the chemical theory: water coming in contact with=
 quick-lime, or metallic=20

sodium or potassium, would evolve intense heat. One or two locomotives have=
 been invented=20

which need no fuel, obtaining their heat supply thus.  But it is objected t=
o this that the products of=20

volcanic action are not such as would result from such a cause; that all ex=
perience indicates that=20

Fevers are not common amongst Europeans, in Manila. Amongst the natives, th=

 and in woody or=20

marshy situations. [40] This appears to be owing as much to the thinness an=
d want of clothing,=20

together with their habits of bathing  One other theory is, that the slow c=
ontraction of the globe=20

from the radiation of heat into space necessarily affects the outer portion=
 most directly, and in=20

consequence, the shrinking of the crust at the weakest points produces unus=
ual pressure there,=20

which can evolve intense heat, as is shown by the fact that nearly all rock=

&c. Tetanos in cases of wounds is of common occurrence, and generally fatal=

by a census taken in 1817-18, amounted to 2,236,000 souls, are more or less=
 changed in their=20

would necessarily form a fairly permanent volcanic tract. As the work of na=
