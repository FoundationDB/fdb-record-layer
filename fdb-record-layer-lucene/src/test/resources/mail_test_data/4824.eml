returned her chum. "Of=20

course, we shall get out of it all right, Helen; but _did_ you ever suppose=
 so much snow could fall=20

at one time?"  "Never!"  "And no sign of it holding up at all," said Madge,=

warm as can be here," Ruth said. "Why don't you take a nap, Helen? Madge an=

together, to be able each to pour out to the other the changes in their min=
