philodendron monstera on which they reside. The inlanders dwell chiefly tow=

who arrived at Coto Intang, when I was there, gave me the following list of=
 what he had brought=20

from some of Rajah Moodo's crown lands, being levied on perhaps five hundre=
d families. 2870=20

battels of paly, of forty lb. each; 490 Spanish dollars; 160 kangans; 6 tay=
ls of gold, equal to 30 l=20

[sterling]; 160 Malons: a cloth made of the plantain tree, three yards long=
, and one broad. This last=20

mentioned cloth is the usual wear of the country women, made in the form of=
 a Bengal lungy, or=20

Buggess [i.e., Bugis] cloth, being a wide sack without a bottom; and is oft=
en used as a currency in=20

the market. The currency in most parts of the country, is the Chinese kanga=
n, coarse cloth, thinly=20

woven, nineteen inches broad, and six yards long; the value at Sooloo is te=
n dollars for a bundle of=20

twenty-five sealed up; and at Magindano much the same; but at Magindano dol=
lars are scarce.=20

These bundles are called gandangs, rolled up in a cylindrical form. They ha=
ve also, as a currency,=20

kousongs, a kind of nankeen, dyed black; and kompow, a strong white Chinese=
 linen, made of=20

flax; of which more particularly hereafter. The kangans generally come from=
 Sooloo; so they are=20

got at second hand: for the Spaniards have long hindered Chinese junks, bou=
nd from Amoy to=20

Magindano, to pass Samboangan. This is the cause of so little trade at Magi=
ndano, no vessels=20

sailing from Indostan thither; and the little trade is confined to a few co=
untry Chinese, called Oran=20

Sangly, and a few Soolooans who come hither to buy rice and paly, bringing =
with them Chinese=20

articles: for the crop of rice at Sooloo can never be depended on. In the b=
azar, or market, the=20

immediate currency is paly. Ten gantangs of about four pounds each, make a =
battel; and three=20

battels (a cylindrical measure, thirteen inches and five-tenths high; the s=
ame in diameter) about=20

one hundred and twenty pounds of paly, are commonly sold for a kangan. Talk=
ing of the value of=20

things here, and at Sooloo, they say, such a house or prow, &c., is worth s=
o many slaves; the old=20

valuation being one slave for thirty kangans. They also specify in their ba=
rgains, whether is meant=20

matto (eye) kangan, real kangan, or nominal kangan. The dealing in the nomi=
nal, or imaginary=20

kangan, is an ideal barter. When one deals for the real kangans, they must =
be examined; and the=20

gandangs, or bundles of twenty-five pieces, are not to be trusted, as the d=
ealers will often forge a=20

seal, having first packed up damaged kangans. In this the Chinese here, and=
 at Sooloo, are very=20

expert. The China cash at Magindano, named pousin, have holes as in China. =
I found them=20

scarce; their price is from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and eighty=
 for a kangan. At=20

Sooloo is coined a cash of base copper, called petis, of which two hundred,=
 down to one hundred=20

and seventy, go for a kangan."  "On Sooloo are no Haraforas. The Haraforas =
on Magindano make=20

a strong cloth, not of cotton, but of a kind of flax, very like what the Ba=
tta people wear on the coast=20

of Sumatra." "One day near Tubuan, a Harafora brought now sunk into silence=
, but burst out again=20

louder than ever, when Lizzie made her appearance from one of the gunyahs--=
perhaps the=20

paternal roof, who knows?--where she had retired, swelling with indignation=
, and as sulky as a=20

whole team of mules.  Finding that no one took any notice of her, and half =
an hour's reflection=20

having, I suppose, convinced her, that if she wanted to make a display befo=
re her relations, now=20

was the time, her ladyship came slowly up to the circle, and commenced an a=
ttack on poor=20

Dunmore, as she knew him best.  To transcribe her words would be impossible=
, for she put in a=20

native sentence whenever she found herself at a loss for an English one, bu=
t the burden of her=20

plaint was this:--  "Plenty d--d fooly fellow, white fellow"--a string of H=
inchinbrook vernacular--"Baal=20

you been shoot 'em like 'it dingo"--more Hinchinbrook, but evidently, from =
the accompanying=20

gestures, indicative of intense disgust--"Baal mine take any more along of =
black fellow camp"--half=20



sobs--"Baal mine care suppose you fellow all go like 'it--"  And she summar=
ily consigned us to the=20

bottomless pit, as the only place at all suited for such stupid idiots who =
could refrain from shooting=20

blacks when so grand an opportunity presented itself.  Her eyes flashed fir=
e as she delivered=20

herself of her woes, and at the concluding sentence she stamped her little =
foot, and flinging a short=20

waddy she held, with remarkable dexterity and no mean force, into the midst=
 of the sable mass,=20

she turned round to depart with the dignity of a tragedy queen, when Dunmor=
e jumped up, caught=20

her, and holding her wrist, walked off a little way from us.  "You like 'it=
 one fine fellow red shirt,=20

Lizzie?  Mine give you one with 'plenty long tail'.  Baal any other gin alo=
ng of camp have shirt like=20

'it you; and when piccaninny sit down" (for there was a prospect of her pre=
senting Ferdinand with a=20

little pledge of affection), "mine give that fellow two budgeree flour-bag =
shirts, suppose only you=20

good fellow girl Lizzie."  Evidently, Dunmore knew the way to the young lad=
y's heart--we=20

nicknamed him "Faust" afterwards--for at the mention of the red shirt, with=
 the lengthy tails, her=20

eyes lost their fierceness, and the allusion to the piccaninny completed hi=
s victory, and changing=20

at once from one extreme to the other, as only a black or a child can, Miss=
 Lizzie took her seat in=20

the circle, lighted her pipe, commenced nodding to, and chatting most affab=
ly with, her relatives,=20

and looking so kind, that it seemed impossible to believe that an intense l=
onging for bloodshed and=20

cruelty had so shortly before lurked in the breast of the pretty, smiling l=
ittle savage who was now=20

beside us.  During the task of pacifying Lizzie, the "heap" had again sunk =
into comparative silence,=20

and only a confused murmur was audible from its depths.  Allowing no time t=
o be lost, Dunmore=20

said to Lizzie--who was puffing out huge mouthfuls of smoke, greatly to the=
 astonishment of the=20

other gins, who looked as if they expected to see her suddenly blaze up--=
=20


_
but the head man of the village, a Magindanoer, would not permit him to sel=
l it me. I did not=20

dispute the point; but found afterwards, the poor Harafora had sold about t=
hree hundred pounds of=20

paly for a prong, or chopping knife." "They all seem to be slaves to the Ma=
gindano people: for=20

these take what they please, fowls or anything in the house they like best;=
 and if the owners seem=20

angry, threaten to tie them up, and flog them." "The inhabitants of this co=
untry [of the Illanos] have=20

generally their name from  "Lizzie, you ask, suppose they been see any whit=
e fellow on island?=20

White fellow in plenty big canoe.  That fellow canoe been come like 'it sho=
re. You tell them, 'Baal=20

white fellow hurt you, suppose you been show, where brother belonging to hi=
m sit down.'  You tell=20

them that, Lizzie."  Lizzie proceeded with the greatest gravity, and eviden=
tly with an overwhelming=20

sense of self-importance, to put the required questions, whilst we anxiousl=
y awaited her replies.=20

"Well, what they been say?" exclaimed Dunmore at=20
