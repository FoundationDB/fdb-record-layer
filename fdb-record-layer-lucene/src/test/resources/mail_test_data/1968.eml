here near the firing=20

line you have to be careful: corpses, dead horses, and cattle are buried ev=
erywhere. I'm building a=20

trench to my emplacement and we have a stinking cow in the direct line; thi=
s will have to be buried=20

before we can cut through.  Everybody is cheerful and going strong. Yesterd=

 _Memoir on the=20

Xanthium maculatum, a New Species from the State of New-York, &c. by_ C. S.=
 RAFINESQUE,=20

ESQ.   Pursh and Michaux mention only one species of American _Xanthium_, t=
he _X.=20

strumarium_, while there are three noticed in the catalogue of Dr. Muhlenbe=
rg, the above species,=20

and the _X. orientale_, and _X. spinosum_. The first=20


_
them, and threw up a lot of fish on to the bank. That kind of discouraged t=
he Tommies swimming,=20

so they cooked the fish and decided that safety comes before cleanliness ou=
t here.  It's hot and=20

sticky, and when you have to wear thick clothes and equipment it makes you =
very uncomfortable,=20

but it's all in the game.  All through the night we fired single shots from=
 a machine gun; my orders=20

were to fire between half-past eight at night and four o'clock in the morni=
ng. We have a number of=20

guns doing this. It harasses the enemy and keeps them from sleeping; anythi=
ng that will wear a=20

man down is practiced here.  I've constructed a fire emplacement amongst th=
e ruins underground;=20

to get to it you have to travel through a tunnel eighteen feet long; inside=
 it's very damp. I was=20

working with my corporal, crouched up; we were both wet and cold, and so to=
 cheer things up=20

every now and again we let off a few rounds and warmed our hands on the bar=
rel. Outside it=20

poured with rain, and mosquitoes sought refuge inside and mealed off me. Th=
e corporal was=20

immune. I had a water bottle full of whiskey and water. We used it to keep =
out the cold, but it=20

wasn't strong enough. In a case like that you need wood alcohol. I would li=
ke to have had some=20

Prohibitionists with me here. We had no light except the flash of the gun a=
nd the enemy star=20

shells.  At daybreak I came home dead beat. I got into my cellar, was so ti=
red that I threw myself=20

down on the bed and wrapped myself up in my blankets, boots, mud, lice and =
all. I hadn't been=20

asleep long before the Huns started "hating" the chateau. They have put ove=
r twenty-five large=20

calibre shells into my place, the grounds and the house. They are still at =
it. Every time a shell=20

bursts it makes a hole big enough to bury five horses, and it shakes the fo=
undations all round. The=20

shells are bigger than usual. The smoke and earth are blown up fifty or six=
ty feet in the air. The=20

effect is a moral disruption. _Why can't they keep that cotton out of Germa=
ny?_  I have divided my=20

section up into two teams, one in the cellars and one in the gun-pits. I re=
lieve them every twenty-

four hours, and I practically have to be in both places at once, but I have=
 got a telephone in=20

between the two places. I have it by my bed so that I can constantly know h=
ow things are going.=20

However, the wire is cut two or three times a day by bullets and shell spli=
nters, my linesman has a=20

constant job.  Fired all night; came back at six o'clock this morning, very=
 tired. Had a telegram=20

from the general to fire two thousand rounds in twenty-four hours; this is =
quite hard work. Actually=20

we could fire the lot in five minutes, but it would attract too much attent=
ion. The enemy use whole=20

batteries of artillery to blot out machine guns which attract attention, so=
 we have to fire single=20

shots.  We have for neighbors four dead cows and an unexploded six-inch she=
ll, liable to go off=20

any time, all in a radius of one hundred yards. We have smashed holes throu=
gh five walls so that=20

we can go through the ruins unobserved. In one place we pass over have been=
 naturalized in the=20

United States, with many other plants. The species called _X. orientale_ by=
 Dr. Muhlenberg,=20

appears however to be a native; but the _X. orientale_ of Linn=C3=A6us, is =
a native of Siberia, Japan,=20

and the East-Indies; and when plants are found to grow in such opposite qua=
rters of the globe, a=20

strong presumption arises that they are not identical species, which presum=
ption has been=20

confirmed by experience in many instances, whenever the plants of both coun=
tries have been=20

accurately examined. Decandolle, in the French Flora, (2d edit, of 1815.) v=
ol. 6. p. 356, describes,=20

under the name of _X. macrocarpon_, a species found in France, and which he=
 takes to be the=20

real _X. orientale_ of Linn=C3=A6us. He has changed its name, because, he s=
ays, that it is not certain=20

that the _X. orientale_ grows in Asia; or, if any grows there, that it is i=
dentic with his species;=20

which, however, is really the _X. orientale_ of Linn=C3=A6us, Son, Lamark, =
and Gaertner. He adds, that=20



he possesses in his herbarium, a species from Canada, different from his _X=
. macrocarpon_=20

which has been figured by Morison, on whose authority some authors have ass=
erted that the _X.=20

orientale_ grew in Canada, mistaking his figure for that plant.  From the a=
bove statement, it=20

appears that much obscurity and difficulty arises in botany, when errors cr=
eep into the distinction=20

of species: to detect those errors, and to ascertain the synonyme of obscur=
e species, is not one of=20

the least useful botanical labours. Having found, last year and this year, =
in the neighbourhood of=20

New-York, a species of _Xanthium_ different from any described by the autho=
rs, and intermediate=20

between the _X. strumarium_ and _X. orientale_ of Linn=C3=A6us, I presume t=
hat it may be the _X.=20

orientale_ of Muhlenberg, Leconte, and Morison, and the _Xanthium_ of Canad=
a, mentioned by=20

Decandolle, Dumont, &c. I have given to it the name of _X. maculatum_, sinc=
e the stem is spotted=20

like the _Conium maculatum_. None of those authors having described it, I s=
uppose that its=20

description will be acceptable, and will serve to fix this new species amon=
g the American=20

botanists.  Therefore it will appear, that the _X. orientale_, which had be=
en considered as a native=20

of Asia, Europe, and America, is composed of at least three species; the Eu=
ropean species, which=20

has been called _X. macrocarpon_ by Decandolle, the American species, which=
 I have called _X.=20

maculatum_, and the Asiatic species, to which the name of _X. orientale_ ou=
ght to remain; but=20

which ought to be better described, and more fully distinguished from the _=
X. macrocarpon_ by=20

those who may chance to meet with it. I even suspect that many species grow=
 in Asia, since that=20

of Ceylon may be different from the Chinese and Siberian species.   _Xanthi=
um Maculatum._=20

_Definition._ Stem flexuous, round, rough, spotted with black; leaves long-=
petiolate, cuneate-

reniform, nearly trilobe, sinuate-toothed, obtuse, rough, and thick; fruits=
 elliptic, obtuse muricate;=20

thorns rough.  _Description._ The root is annual, thick, and white. The ste=
m=20


_
through several tons of rotten potatoes, and I believe we have a corpse han=
dy; and part of our=20

trench goes through another heap of rotten mangles. I'm an authority on sme=
lls. I can almost tell=20

the nationality of a corpse now by the smell. It will soon be necessary to =
wear our smoke-helmets=20

to go into the emplacement. I don't think that I have told you that I cross=
 the Yser canal about six=20

times a day. I'd been up a week before I knew what it was. Now it only has =
a few feet of water in it,=20

the rest being held in the German locks. The part I cross over is full of b=
ulrushes, and is the home=20

of moor-hens, water rats, mosquitoes and frogs.  On one side of the canal i=
s a bank which is in=20

great demand by the machine gunners, who are able to get a certain amount o=
f height and=20

observation of their fire. The general has ordered a field gun to take up a=
 position on this bank. He=20

refers to it as his "Sniping eighteen-pounder." It is firing at seven hundr=
ed yards right at the=20

German line and smashes up their parapet in a style that is pretty to watch=
. The machine gunners=20

are in a great state, because the enemy will soon be "searching" with his a=
rtillery for the eighteen-

pounder and the lairs of the smaller hidden guns will suffer.  The men are =
hunting for lice in their=20

underwear. This is the kind of conversation that is coming through from the=
 next cellars: "I've got=20

you beat--that's forty-seven." "Wait a minute"--a sound of tearing cloth--"=
but look at this lot, mother=20

and young." "With my forty and these you'll have to find some more." They w=
ere betting on the=20

number they could find. I peel off my shirt myself and burn them off with a=
 candle. I glory in the=20

little pop they make when the heat gets to them. All the insect powder in t=
he world has been tried=20

out on them and they've won.  All from one to two feet; it is upright, with=
out thorns, very thick, and=20

with few branches; it is covered with oblong, black, and rough spots. The l=
eaves are few, but large,=20

with very long petiols; they are nearly reniform, with an acute base, and h=
ave three nerves; the=20

teeth are unequal, large, and obtuse. The flowers and fruits are disposed a=
s in _X. strumarium_;=20

but the fruits are generally solitary; they are half an inch long, nearly c=
ylindrical obtuse, with the=20

two beaks scarcely perceptible and bent in, covered with short, thick, and =
rough thorns, rather soft,=20

and not uncinate. The whole plant has a peculiar smell, not unpleasant, som=
ewhat between the=20

camphorate and gravulent odour, but weaker than in _Conysa camphorata_, &c.=
  _History._ This=20

plant grows on Long-Island, near the seashore and marshes. I have found it =
common near Bath,=20

on the downs, and in New-Jersey, near Bergen, and Powles Hook, on the margi=
n of marshy=20

meadows. According to Dr. Mulenberg, it grows also in Pennsylvania; Messrs.=
 Torrey and Leconte=20

found it on the island of New-York; and by Morison and Decandolle's account=
, it is found as far=20

north as Canada. It blossoms in August and September, but the fruits remain=
 on the plant till the=20

severe frosts of December.  _Observations._ This species differs from the _=
X. macrocarpon_ of=20

Decandolle, by having smaller fruits, without horns, and whose thorns are n=
either hooked nor=20

hispid; by not having an angular stem, but a round, spotted one, and by its=
 leaves being broader,=20

and not serrate, &c. Nearly all those differences exist between it and the =
_X. orientale_ of Asia,=20

which has not yet been isolated from the _X. macrocarpon_. The _X. edrinatu=
m_ differs from this=20

by having oval fruits, with aggregated, echinate, and hooked thorns; and th=
e _X. strumarium_, by=20

having=20


_
company; even when things are quiet, rats and mice scamper about and it set=
s your nerves on=20

end. Things which are inanimate during the day become alive at night. Trees=
 seem to walk about. I=20

wonder what it tastes like to have a real meal in which tinned food does no=
t figure; fancy a=20

tablecloth; my tablecloth is a double sheet of newspaper, and even then I c=
an't have a new one=20

every day.                    -------------------------------------  Had a =
good night's rest; came in about twelve=20

o'clock and slept until eight-thirty this morning. One eye is completely cl=
osed up by a sting.  A=20

German aeroplane has been hovering over our positions looking for my gun, s=
o we have stopped=20

firing and all movement. I know just how the chicken feels when the hawk ho=
vers over it. Few=20

people realize how much aeroplanes figure in this war, for war would be muc=
h different without=20

them. They do the work of Cavalry only in the sky. Whenever they come over,=
 the sentries blow=20

three blasts on their whistles and everybody runs for cover or freezes; gun=
s stop fruits aggregated,=20

with hooked thorns and horned tops. The _X. spinosum_, and _X. fruticosum_,=
 ate so totally=20

different that they need not be compared.     ZOOLOGY.     ART. XIII. _Desc=
