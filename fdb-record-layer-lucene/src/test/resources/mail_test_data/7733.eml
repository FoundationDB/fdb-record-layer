circuit to leeward for about a mile, and, finding that the elephants had no=
t crossed in that direction,=20

we felt sure that we must come upon them with the wind in our favour should=
 they still be within=20

the thorny jungle; this was certain, as it was their favourite retreat.  Wi=
th the greatest labour I led=20

the way, creeping frequently upon my hands and knees to avoid the hooks of =
the kittar bush, and=20

occasionally listening for a sound. At length, after upwards of an hour pas=
sed in this slow and=20

fatiguing advance, I distinctly heard the flap of an elephant's ear, shortl=
y followed by the deep=20

guttural sigh of one of those animals, within a few paces, but so dense was=
 the screen of jungle=20

that I could see nothing. We waited for some minutes, but not the slightest=
 sound could be heard;=20

the elephants were aware of danger, and they were, like ourselves, listenin=
g attentively for the first=20

intimation of an enemy. This was a highly exciting moment; should they char=
ge, there would not=20

be a possibility of escape, as the hooked thorns rendered any sudden moveme=
nt almost=20

impracticable. In another moment, there was a tremendous crash; and, with a=
 sound like a=20

whirlwind, the herd dashed through the crackling jungle. I rushed forward, =
as I was uncertain=20

whether they were in advance or retreat; leaving a small sample of my nose =
upon a kittar thorn,=20

and tearing my way, with naked arms, through what, in cold blood, would hav=
e appeared=20

impossible, I caught sight of two elephants leading across my path, with th=
e herd following in a=20

dense mass behind them. Firing a shot at the leading elephant, simply in th=
e endeavour to check=20

the herd, I repeated with the left-hand barrel at the head of his companion=
; this staggered him, and=20

threw the main body into confusion: they immediately closed up in a dense m=
ass, and bore=20

everything before them, but the herd exhibited merely an impenetrable array=
 of hind quarters=20

wedged together so firmly that it was impossible to obtain a head or should=
er shot. I was within=20

fifteen paces of them, and so compactly were they packed, that with all the=
ir immense strength=20

they could not at once force so extensive a front through the tough and pow=
erful branches of the=20

dense kittar. For about half a minute they were absolutely checked, and the=
y bored forward with all=20

their might in their determination to open a road through the matted thorns=
: the elastic boughs,=20

bent from their position, sprang back with dangerous force, and would have =
fractured the skull of=20

any one who came within their sweep. A very large elephant was on the left =
flank, and for an=20

instant this turned obliquely to the left; I quickly seized the opportunity=
 and fired the "Baby," with an=20

explosive shell, aimed far back in the flank, trusting that it would penetr=
ate beneath the opposite=20

shoulder. The recoil of the "Baby," loaded with ten drachms of the stronges=
t powder and a half-

pound shell, spun me round like a top--it was difficult to say which was st=
aggered the most=20

severely, the elephant or myself; however, we both recovered, and I seized =
one of my double=20

rifles, a Reilly No. 10, that was quickly pushed into my hand by my Tokroor=
i, Hadji Ali. This was=20

done just in time, as an elephant from the baffled herd turned sharp round,=
 and, with its immense=20

ears cocked, it charged down upon us with a scream of rage. "One of us she =
must have if I miss!"=20

This was the first downright charge of an African elephant that I had seen,=
 and instinctively I=20

followed my old Ceylon plan of waiting for a close shot. She lowered her he=
ad when within about=20

six yards, and I fired low for the centre of the forehead, exactly in the s=
welling above the root of the=20

trunk. She collapsed to the shot, and fell dead, with a heavy shock, upon t=
he ground. At the same=20

moment, the thorny barrier gave way before the pressure of the herd, and th=
e elephants=20

disappeared in the thick jungle, through which it was impossible to follow =
them.  I had suffered=20

terribly from the hooked thorns, and the inheritance. The good folks of the=
 village had made=20



shortbread and biscuits for the little orphan to take with her on her journ=
ey out into the great world,=20

and they also filled a basket with pears and plums; and as the cart drove o=
ff, many of them shed=20

tears for the poor little waif, who had no idea where they were taking her =
to, but only saw that=20

when the horses began to move, she still kept her place in the basket, and =
only the houses and=20

trees seemed to move.     CHAPTER II.  GLOGOVA AS IT USED TO BE.   Not only=
 the worthy=20

Kapiczany had seen Glogova, the writer of these pages has also been there. =
It is a miserable little=20

place in a narrow valley between bare mountains. There is not a decent road=
 for miles around,=20

much less a railway. Nowadays they say there is some sort of an old-fashion=
ed engine, with a=20

carriage or two attached, which plies between Besztercebanya and Selmeczban=
ya, but even that=20

does not pass near to Glogova. It will take at least five hundred years to =
bring it up to that pitch of=20

civilization other villages have reached.  The soil is poor, a sort of clay=
, and very little will grow=20

there except oats and potatoes, and even these have to be coaxed from the g=
round. A soil like=20

that cannot be spoken of as "Mother Earth," it is more like "Mother-in-law =
Earth." It is full of=20

pebbles, and has broad cracks here and there, on the borders of which a kin=
d of whitish weed=20

grows, called by the peasants "orphans' hair." Is the soil too old? Why, it=
 cannot be older than any=20

other soil, but its strength has been used up more rapidly. Down below in t=
he plain they have been=20

growing nothing but grass for about a thousand years, but up here enormous =
oak-trees used to=20

grow; so it is no wonder that the soil has lost its strength. Poverty and m=
isery are to be found here,=20

and yet a certain feeling of romance takes possession of one at the sight o=
f it. The ugly peasant=20

huts seem only to heighten the beauty of the enormous rocks which rise abov=
e us. It would be a=20

sin to build castles there, which, with their ugly modern towers, would hid=
e those wild-looking=20

rocks.  The perfume of the elder and juniper fills the air, but there are n=
o other flowers, except here=20

and there in one of the tiny gardens, a mallow, which a barefooted, fair-ha=
ired Slovak girl tends,=20

and waters from a broken jug. I see the little village before me, as it was=
 in 1873, when I was there=20

last; I see its small houses, the tiny gardens sown partly with clover, par=
tly with maize, with here=20

and there a plum-tree, its branches supported by props. For the fruit-trees=
 at least did their duty,=20

as though they had decided to make up to the poor Slovaks for the poverty o=
f their harvest.  When=20

I was there the priest had just died, and we had to take an inventory of hi=
s possessions. There=20

was nothing worth speaking of, a few bits of furniture, old and well worn, =
and a few shabby=20

cassocks. But the villagers were sorry to lose the old priest.  "He was a g=
ood man," they said, "but=20

he had no idea of economy, though, after all, he had not very much to econo=
mize with."  "Why=20

don't you pay your priest better?" we asked. And a big burly peasant answer=
ed:  "The priest is not=20

our servant, but the servant of God, and every master must pay his own serv=
ant."  After making=20

the inventory, and while the coachman was harnessing the horses, we walked =
across the road to=20

have a look at the school, for my companion was very fond of posing as a pa=
tron of learning.  The=20

schoolhouse was small and low, with a simple, thatched roof. Only the churc=
h had a wooden roof,=20

but even the House of God was very simply built, and there was no tower to =
it, only a small belfry=20

at one side.  The schoolmaster was waiting for us. If I remember rightly hi=
s name was Gyoergy=20

Majzik. He was a strong, robust-looking man, with an interesting, intellige=
nt face, and a plain,=20

straightforward way of speaking which immediately awoke a feeling of friend=
ship in one. He took=20

us in to see the children; the girls sat on one=20


_
likewise. This had been a capital trial for my Tokrooris, who had behaved r=
emarkably well, and=20

had I gained much confidence by my successful forehead shot at the elephant=
 when in full charge;=20

but I must confess that this is the only instance in which I have succeeded=
 in killing an African=20

elephant by the front shot, although I have steadily tried the experiment u=
pon subsequent=20

occasions.  Florian had not had an opportunity of firing a shot, as I had b=
een in his way, and he=20

could not pass on one side owing to the thorns.  We had very little time to=
 examine the elephant,=20

as we were far from home, and the sun was already low. I felt convinced tid=
y and clean as=20

possible. They rose on our entrance, and in a singing voice said:  "Vitajty=
e panyi, vitajtye!" (Good-

morning, honored sirs!)  My companion put a few questions to the rosy, roun=
d-faced children, who=20

stared at us with their large brown eyes. They all had brown eyes. The ques=
tions were, of course,=20

not difficult, but they caused the children an amount of serious thinking. =
However, my friend was=20

indulgent, and he only patted the schoolmaster on the back and said:  "I am=
 quite contented with=20

their answers, my friend."  The schoolmaster bowed, then, with his head hel=
d high, he=20

accompanied us out to the road.     CHAPTER III.  THE=20


_
other elephant could not be far off, after having received the "Baby's" hal=
f-pound shell carefully=20

directed, and I resolved to return on the following morning with many peopl=
e and camels to divide=20

the flesh. It was dark by the time we arrived at the tents, and the news im=
mediately spread through=20

the Arab camp that two elephants had been killed.  On the following morning=
 we started, and,=20

upon arrival at the dead elephant, we followed the tracks of that wounded b=
y the "Baby." The=20

blood upon the bushes guided us in a few minutes to the spot where the elep=
hant lay dead, at=20

about 300 yards' distance. The whole day passed in flaying the two animals,=
 and cutting off the=20

flesh, which was packed in large gum sacks, with which the camels were load=
ed. I was curious to=20

examine the effect of the half-pound shell: it had entered the flank on the=
 right side, breaking the=20

rib upon which it had exploded; it had then passed through   The new priest=
 had arrived in the only=20

cart the villagers had at their disposal. Two cows were harnessed to it, an=
d on the way the=20

sacristan stopped to milk them, and then offered some of the milk to the yo=
ung priest.  "It's very=20

good milk," he said, "especially Bimbo's."  His reverence's luggage was not=
 bulky; it consisted of a=20

plain wooden box, a bundle of bed-clothes, two walking-sticks, and some pip=
es tied together with=20

string. As they passed through the various villages the sacristan was often=
 chaffed by the=20

inhabitants.  "Well," they called out to him, "couldn't you find a better c=
onveyance than that for your=20

new priest?"  Whereupon the sacristan tried to justify his fellow-villagers=
 by saying with a=20

contemptuous look at the luggage in the cart:  "It's good enough, I'm sure.=
 Why, a calf a month old=20

could draw those things."  But if he had not brought much with him in the w=
ay of worldly goods,=20

 the left side, it had=20

lodged beneath the skin of the shoulder. This was irresistible work, and th=
e elephant had evidently=20

dropped in a few minutes after having received the shell.  The conical bull=
et of quicksilver and=20

lead, propelled by seven drachms of powder, had entered the exact centre of=
 the forehead of the=20

elephant No. 1, and, having passed completely through the brain and the bac=
k part of the skull, we=20

found it to be going to wreck and ruin. The relations of the dead priest ha=
d taken away every stick=20

they could lay hands on, and had only left a dog, his favorite. It was a do=
g such as one sees every=20

day, as far as his shape and coat were concerned, but he was now in a very =
unpleasant position.=20
