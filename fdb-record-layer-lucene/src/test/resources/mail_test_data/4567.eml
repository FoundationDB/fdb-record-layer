to the revolution of the heaven, they are swept back as it goes round every day.  16. The reason 

why some of these stars are temperate, others hot, and others cold, appears to be this: that the 

flame of every kind of fire rises to higher places. Consequently, the burning rays of the sun make 

the ether above him white hot, in the regions of the course of Mars, and so the heat of the sun 

makes him hot. Saturn, on the contrary, being nearest to the outermost limit of the firmament and 

bordering on the quarters of the heaven which are frozen, is excessively cold. Hence, Jupiter, 

whose course is between the orbits of these two, appears to have a moderate and very temperate 

influence, intermediate between their cold and heat.  I have now described, as I have received 

them from my teacher, the belt of the twelve signs and the seven stars that work and move in the 

opposite direction, with the laws and numerical relations under which they pass from sign to sign, 

and how they complete their under his thumb for fifteen long years! High-school, indeed--he had 

the whole town under his thumb! Our ladies did not get up private theatricals on Saturdays for fear 

he should hear of it, and the clergy dared not eat meat or play cards in his presence. Under the 

influence of people like Byelikov we have got into the way of being afraid of everything in our town 

for the last ten or fifteen years. They are afraid to speak aloud, afraid to send letters, afraid to 

make acquaintances, afraid to read books, afraid to help the poor, to teach people to read and 

write...."  Ivan Ivanovitch cleared his throat, meaning to say something, but first lighted his pipe, 

gazed at the moon, and then said, with pauses:  "Yes, intellectual, right minded people read 

Shtchedrin and Turgenev, Buckle, and all the rest of them, yet they knocked under and put up with 

it... that's just how it is."  "Byelikov lived in the same house as I did," Burkin went on, "on the same 

storey, his door facing mine; we often saw each other, and I knew how he lived when he was at 

home. And at home it was the same story:

next speak of the waxing and waning of the moon, according to the accounts of my predecessors. 

CHAPTER II  THE PHASES OF THE MOON   1. According to the teaching of Berosus, who came 

from the state, or rather nation, of the Chaldees, and was the pioneer of Chaldean learning in 

Asia, the moon is a ball, one half luminous and the rest of a blue colour. When, in the course of 

her orbit, she has passed below the disc of the sun, she is attracted by his rays and great heat, 

and turns thither her luminous side, on account of the sympathy between light and light. Being 

thus summoned by the sun's disc and facing upward, her lower half, as it is not luminous, is 

invisible on account of its likeness to the air. When she is perpendicular to the sun's rays, all her 

light is confined to her dressing-gown, nightcap, blinds, bolts, a perfect succession of prohibitions 

and restrictions of all sorts, and--'Oh, I hope nothing will come of it!' Lenten fare was bad for him, 

yet he could not eat meat, as people might perhaps say Byelikov did not keep the fasts, and he 

ate freshwater fish with butter--not a Lenten dish, yet one could not say that it was meat. He did 

not keep a female servant for fear people might think evil of him, but had as cook an old man of 

sixty, called Afanasy, half-witted and given to tippling, who had once been an officer's servant and 

could cook after a fashion. This Afanasy was usually standing at the door with his arms folded; 

with a deep sigh, he would mutter always the same thing:  "'There are plenty of _them_ about 

nowadays!'  "Byelikov had a 


_
new moon.  2. As she moves on, passing by to the east, the effect of the sun upon her relaxes, 

and the outer edge of the luminous side sheds its light upon the earth in an exceedingly thin line. 

This is called the second day of the moon. Day by day she is further relieved and turns, and thus 

are numbered the third, fourth, and following days. On the seventh day, the sun being in the west 

and the moon in the middle of the firmament between the east and west, she is half the extent of 

the he went to bed he covered his head over; it was hot and stuffy; the wind battered on the closed 

doors; there was a droning noise in the stove and a sound of sighs from the kitchen--ominous 

sighs.... And he felt frightened under the bed-clothes. He was afraid that something might happen, 

that Afanasy might murder him, that thieves might break in, and so he had troubled dreams all 

night, and in the morning, when we went together to the high-school, he was depressed and pale, 

and it was evident
