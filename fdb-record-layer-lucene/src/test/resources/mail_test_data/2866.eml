ce to look down or to measure the distance _
for a while, and he is ever referring to it in his public preaching with sh=
ame and remorse; but the=20

false step was more than atoned for by his magnificent recantation.  Mohamm=
ad's influence with=20

the people at large was certainly weakened by this temporary change of fron=
t, and the opposition=20

of the leaders of the Kureysh, checked for the moment by the Prophet's conc=
ession, now that he=20

had repudiated it, broke forth into fiercer flame. They heaped insults upon=
 him, and he could not=20

traverse the city without the in his path he leaped over them as easily as =
a boy or girl would jump=20

over a log.  Faster and faster he flew through the woods, his fine head set=
 well back, and his=20

antlers almost resting on his neck. His eyes were kept glued to the trail a=
head. He ran so easily=20

and smoothly that it seemed as if he was making no effort. For the first fi=
ve miles he showed=20

hardly any results of his wild run, but in the last half of the distance he=
 began to perspire a little,=20

and the white foam settled on his flanks.  But he never=20


_
him in his every doing. The protection of Aboo-Talib alone saved him from p=
ersonal danger. This=20

refuge the Kureysh determined to remove. They had attempted before, but had=
 been turned back=20

with a soft answer. They now went to the chief, of fourscore years, and dem=
anded that he should=20

either compel his nephew to hold his peace, or else that he should withdraw=
 his protection. Having=20

thus spoken they departed. The old man sent for Mohammad, and told him what=
 they had said.=20

'Now therefore save thyself and me also, and cast not upon me a burden heav=
ier than I can bear;'=20

for he was grieved at the strife between his family and his wider kindred, =
and would fain have seen=20

Mohammad temporize with the Kureysh. But though the Prophet believed that a=
t length his uncle=20

was indeed about to abandon him, his courage and high resolve never faltere=
d. 'Though they=20

should set the sun on my right hand and the moon on my left to persuade me,=
 yet while God=20

commands me I will not renounce my purpose.' But to lose his uncle's love!-=
-he burst into tears,=20

and turned to go. But Aboo-Talib called aloud, 'Son of my brother, come bac=
k.' So he came. And=20

he said, 'Depart in peace, my nephew, and say whatsoever thou desirest; for=
, by the Lord, I will=20

never deliver thee up.'  The faithfulness of Aboo-Talib was soon to be trie=
d. At first, indeed, things=20

looked brighter. The old chief's firm bearing overawed the Kureysh, and the=
y were still more=20

cowed by two great additions that were now joined to the Muslim ranks. One =
was Mohammad's=20

uncle, Hamzeh, 'the Lion of God,' a mighty hunter and warrior of the true A=
rab mettle, whose=20

sword was worth twenty of weaker men to the cause of Islam. The other was '=
Omar, afterwards=20

Khalif, whose fierce impulsive nature had hitherto marked him as a violent =
opponent of the new=20

faith, but who afterwards proved himself one of the mainstays of Islam. The=
 gain of two such men=20

first frightened then maddened the Kureysh. The leaders met together and co=
nsulted what they=20

should do. It was no longer a case of an enthusiast followed by a crowd of =
slaves and a few=20

worthy merchants; it was a faction led by stout warriors, such as Hamzeh, T=
alhah, 'Omar,--half-a-

dozen picked swordsmen; and the Muslims, emboldened by their new allies, we=
re boldly=20

surrounding the Kaabeh, and performing the rites of their religion in the f=
ace of all the people. The=20

Kureysh resolved on extreme measures. They determined to shut off the obnox=
ious family of the=20

Hashimees from the rest of their kindred. The chiefs drew up a document, in=
 which they vowed=20

that they would not marry with the Hashimees, nor buy and sell with them, n=
or hold with them any=20

communication soever; and this they hung up in the Kaabeh.  The Hashimees w=
ere not many=20

enough to fight the whole city, so they went every man of them, save one, t=
o the shi-b (or quarter)=20

of Aboo-Talib,--a long, narrow mountain defile on the eastern skirts of Mek=
ka, cut off by rocks or=20

walls from the city, except for one narrow gateway,--and there shut themsel=
ves up. For though the=20

ban did not forbid them to go about as heretofore, they knew that no soul w=
ould speak with them,=20

and that they would be subject to the maltreatment of any vagabond they met=
. So they collected=20

their stores and waited. Every man of the family, Muslim or Pagan, cast in =
his lot with their=20

common kinsman, Mohammad, saving only his own uncle, Aboo-Lahab, a determin=
ed enemy to=20

Islam, to whom a special denunciation is justly consecrated in the Kur-an. =
 For two long years the=20

Hashimees remained shut up in their quarter. Only at the pilgrimage-time--w=
hen the blessed=20

institution of the sacred months made violence sacrilege--could Mohammad co=
me forth and speak=20

unto the people of the things that were in his heart to say. Scarcely any c=
onverts were made=20

during this weary time; and most of those who had previously been converted=
, and did not belong=20

to the doomed clan, took refuge in Abyssinia; so that in the seventh year o=
f Mohammad's mission=20



there were probably not more than twelve Muslims of any weight who remained=
 by him. Still the=20

Hashimees remained in their quarter. It seemed as if they must all perish: =
their stores were almost=20

gone, and the cries of starving children could be heard outside. Kind-heart=
ed neighbours would=20

sometimes smuggle-in a camel's load of food, but it availed little. The Kur=
eysh themselves were=20

getting ashamed of their work, and were wishing for an excuse for releasing=
 their kinsmen. The=20

excuse came in time. It was discovered that the deed of ban was eaten up by=
 worms, and Aboo-

Talib turned the discovery to his advantage. The venerable old chief went o=
ut and met the Kureysh=20

at the Kaabeh, and pointing to the crumbling leaf he bitterly reproached th=
em with their hardness=20

of heart towards their brethren: then he departed. And straightway there ro=
se up five chiefs, heads=20

of great families, and, amid the murmurs of the fiercer spirits who were st=
ill for no quarter, they put=20

on their armour, and going to the shi-b of Aboo-Talib, bade the Hashimees c=
ome forth in peace.=20

And they came forth.  It was now the eighth year of Mohammad's mission; and=
 for the last two=20

years, wasted in excommunication, Islam had almost stood still, at least ex=
ternally. For though=20

Mohammad's patient bearing under the ban had gained over a few of his impri=
soned clan to his=20

side, he had made no converts beyond the walls of his quarter. During the s=
acred months he had=20

gone forth to speak to the people,--to the caravans of strangers and the fo=
lk at the fairs,--but he=20

had no success; for hard behind him followed Aboo-Lahab, the squinter, who =
mocked at him, and=20

told the people he was only 'a liar and a sabian.' And the people answered =
that his own kindred=20

must best know what he was, and they would hear nothing from him. The bold =
conduct of the five=20

chiefs had indeed secured for Mohammad a temporary respite from persecution=
; but this relief was=20

utterly outweighed by the troubles that now fell upon him and fitly gave th=
at year the name of 'The=20

Year of Mourning.' For soon after the revoking of the ban Aboo-Talib died, =
and five Puma=E2=80=99s=20

hunting ground. Then he halted and whirled around.  =E2=80=9CHow was that?=
=E2=80=9D he asked.  But Father Buck=20

was not there. He was alone. His father was nowhere in sight. Startled and =
surprised by this he=20

trotted back a few paces and called to him. Then, not finding him, he becam=
e frightened. Had=20

something happened to his father?  Perhaps Puma had sprung out of the bushe=
s and killed him,=20

or Timber Wolf had driven him off the trail, and was even now chasing him. =
White Tail was so=20

alarmed that he retraced his footsteps, calling every little while for Fath=
er Buck. It was a=20

dangerous thing to do, for in calling he might attract Puma or Timber Wolf.=
 But his anxiety for his=20

father made him forget all caution.  He found him a long way back on the tr=
ail, lying in the bushes,=20

panting with exhaustion. As soon as he discovered him, White Tail ran up to=
 him with a little bleat=20

of joy.  =E2=80=9COh, I thought something terrible had happened to you!=E2=
=80=9D he exclaimed. =E2=80=9CWhat is it? Did you=20

stumble? You haven=E2=80=99t broken a leg, have you?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo,=
 White Tail,=E2=80=9D was the panting reply. =E2=80=9CNothing=20

has happened to me. I couldn=E2=80=99t keep up with you. I tried my best. I=
 hung on until I fell down with=20

exhaustion. I have run my last race. I did it to show you that I am growing=
 older and that my=20

powers are weakening. You would not be convinced when I failed to leap the =
brook. Now you will=20

have to believe.=E2=80=9D  Then it dawned upon White Tail that the race to =
Puma=E2=80=99s hunting ground was=20

simply to show him that his father could no longer keep up with the young b=
ucks of the herd. It was=20

hard for Father Buck thus to show his failing powers, but it was better to =
do it with his son as the=20

only witness than to fail before all the herd.  =E2=80=9CIt is my downfall,=
 White Tail,=E2=80=9D he added. =E2=80=9CBut I wanted=20

only you as witness. Now you know. My leadership will soon end, but when th=
e day comes you=20

must be able to take my place. That will be my satisfaction, and your mothe=
r=E2=80=99s. She knew that the=20



time was approaching, and she will not be heavy-hearted.=E2=80=9D  White Ta=
il was terribly distressed by=20

this news, but after a while a fierce joy came to him. =E2=80=9CI shall pro=
ve myself worthy of you, Father=20

Buck,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CYes, I will take your place. I will fight =
for it now that you and Mother Deer want it.=20

Yes, I will fight for the leadership until the last breath.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThose are the words I=E2=80=99ve longed to hear,=20

White Tail. Now I am contented. We will return to the herd. My day=E2=80=99=
s work is done.=E2=80=9D  As they trotted=20

slowly back to the herd, they planned for the future. Both knew that the fu=
ture race would be=20

between White Tail and Young Black Buck. But of this you will read in the n=
ext story.=20

STORY III                       YOUNG BLACK BUCK=E2=80=99S CHALLENGE   Youn=
g Black Buck had, of=20

course, been in training all this time, for it is the law of the deer that =
none shall aspire for the=20

leadership of a herd until he has learned all the ways of the woods, and ca=
n out-pace and out-

jump his father and mother. All the laws of the deer are very strict, for t=
he safety of all depends=20

upon the leader.  Black Buck had taken his son through the woods, as Father=
 Buck had taken=20

White Tail, showing him the dangers and pitfalls, and instructing him how t=
o avoid them and what=20

to do when danger threatened. He had taken him secretly to Stepping Stone b=
rook, and made him=20

jump it; and he had tested his speed and endurance in a race with himself. =
 Father Buck had no=20

illusions about what Black Buck was doing, and he tried to prepare White Ta=
il to meet Young=20

Black Buck on equal terms. It was like bringing up two boys for a contest i=
n speed, strength,=20

endurance, wisdom and courage. It was a Spartan education, but it was neces=
sary for the good of=20

the herd.  Then one day the clash came for a preliminary trial of skill. Th=
e herd had wandered=20

down from the timberland to the open woods below where the new buds of the =
birches offered=20

succulent food. There was no sign of danger in the air, and the herd grazed=
 peacefully on soft=20

young twigs and opening buds.  When they had wandered to the brink of the c=
anyon that cut=20

through the North Woods below Stepping Stone brook, the leaders paused and =
started to turn the=20

young does and fawns back. It was dangerous to permit them to eat too close=
 to the edge of the=20

precipice. If one should fall over, the rocks below would crack every bone =
in its body.  Black Buck=20

suddenly raised his head, and then whispered to his son: =E2=80=9CThink you=
 can jump the canyon safely?=20

If so it is a good time to challenge White Tail. We may find out then what =
he can do. If he balks at=20

it, we will know he is timid or under-trained.=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck w=
alked to the edge, and gazed=20

down it and then across it. It was a dangerous leap, for if he missed by an=
 inch he would fall to the=20

bottom thirty feet below where the hard rocks would crush him. He sniffed t=
he air, and then=20

returned to his father=E2=80=99s side.  =E2=80=9CI can do it,=E2=80=9D he r=
eplied. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve made longer jumps.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, bu=
t if you=20

should fail you would be killed. Make sure of yourself before you sound the=
 challenge. Go below,=20

where the canyon is not so steep, but just as wide. Practice there alone un=
til you have confidence.=20

If you fail no harm will be done. You can wait another day.=E2=80=9D  Young=
 Black Buck separated himself=20

from the herd and made his way to a point half a mile down the canyon. On e=
ither side here the=20

rocks were covered with moss and turf, and the edges dropped only a few fee=
t. If he failed the fall=20

would not hurt him.  Unseen by the others, he made the attempt, and cleared=
 the space=20

successfully in the first leap. Then to make sure he tried it again and aga=
in, lighting easily on the=20

opposite embankment each time.  Gloating with pride and triumph, he trotted=
 back to Black Buck,=20

and reported. =E2=80=9CI never failed once. If the distance here is no grea=
ter across I can do it easily.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is=20

no greater, but if anything a few inches less,=E2=80=9D replied Black Buck.=
 =E2=80=9CIf you can do it below, you will=20

do it here. Issue the challenge.=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck trotted away, a=
nd, raising his head in the air, a=20



peculiar bellowing noise issued from his throat.=20


_
Khadeejeh. In the first Mohammad lost his ancient protector, who, though he=
 would never give up=20

his old belief, had yet faithfully guarded the Prophet from his childhood u=
pwards, and, with the true=20

Arab sentiment of kinship, had subjected himself and his clan to years of p=
ersecution and poverty=20

in order to defend his brother's son from his enemies. The death of Khadeej=
eh was even a heavier=20

calamity to Mohammad. She first had believed in him, and she had ever been =
his angel of hope=20

and consolation. To his death he cherished a tender regret for her; and whe=
n his young bride=20

'Aisheh, the favourite of his declining years, jealously abused 'that tooth=
less old woman,' he=20

answered with indignation, 'When I was poor, she enriched me; when they cal=
led me a liar, she=20

alone believed in me; when all the world was against me, she alone remained=
 true.'  Mohammad=20

might well feel himself alone in the world. Most of his followers were in A=
byssinia; only a few tried=20

friends remained at Mekka. All the city was against him; his protector was =
dead, and his faithful=20

wife. Dejected, almost hopeless, he would try a new field. If Mekka rejecte=
d him, might not Et-Taif=20

give him welcome? He set out on foot on his journey of seventy miles, takin=
g only Zeyd with him;=20

and he told the people of Et-Taif his simple message. They stoned him out o=
f the city for three=20

miles. Bleeding and fainting, he paused to rest in an orchard, to recover s=
trength before he went=20

back to the insults of his own people. The owners of the place sent him som=
e grapes; and he=20

gathered up his strength once more, and bent his weary feet towards Mekka. =
On the way, as he=20

slept, his fancy called up a strange dream: men had rejected him, and now h=
e thought he saw the=20

Jinn, the spirits of the air, falling down and worshipping the One God, and=
 bearing witness to the=20

truth of Islam. Heartened by the vision, he pushed on; and when Zeyd asked =
him if he did not fear=20

to throw himself again into the hands of the Kureysh, he answered, 'God wil=
l protect His religion=20

and help His prophet.'  So this lonely man came back to dwell among his ene=
mies. Though a=20

brave Arab gentleman, compassionating his aloneness, gave him the Bedawee p=
ledge of=20

protection, yet he well knew that the power of his foes made such protectio=
n almost useless, and=20

challenge to a contest. Every deer knew its meaning, and raised a head to s=
ee who was calling.=20

White Tail, feeding some distance off with Mother Deer and Father Buck, hea=
rd it, and instantly=20

turned his head in Young Black Buck=E2=80=99s direction.  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=
=99s Young Black Buck=E2=80=99s challenge,=E2=80=9D whispered=20

Father Buck. =E2=80=9CYou must accept it. It may be a challenge to a race o=
r fight. Whatever it is you must=20

accept it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m ready,=E2=80=9D replied White Tai=
l, starting off.  =E2=80=9CWho will leap the canyon with me!=E2=80=9D=20

bellowed Young Black Buck. =E2=80=9CI shall lead where none dare follow! No=
ne shall then dispute my=20

claim to leadership. Come those who dare!=E2=80=9D  Before White Tail reach=
ed the spot, the whole herd=20

was crowding around the challenger. They saw a prospect of a free entertain=
ment, and they=20

bucked and butted each other to get in front. None of the other young bucks=
 had accepted the=20

challenge. One glance at the yawning depth of the canyon had made them with=
draw with=20

sickening fear. It looked much deeper than it was, and twice as wide.  Whit=
e Tail pushed his way=20

through the crowds until he stood before Young Black Buck. The sight of him=
 brought a quick=20

remark from the challenger=E2=80=99s mouth.  =E2=80=9CYou, White Tail!=E2=
=80=9D he exclaimed. =E2=80=9CYou wish to accept the=20

challenge? Beware how you speak without thinking. Go and look down the chas=
m! It means death=20

if you fail! Think twice before you speak!=E2=80=9D  Now when Father Buck h=
eard the nature of the=20

challenge he felt a great fear. He had never shown the canyon to White Tail=
, and he didn=E2=80=99t know=20

whether he could leap across it or not. He reproached himself for omitting =
this part of his training.=20

Mother Deer=E2=80=99s heart gave a great throb. If White Tail failed she kn=
ew he would be crushed to=20



death on the rocks below. She could not endure such a sight. Better that he=
r son should lose the=20

leadership than be killed.  =E2=80=9CNo, no, White Tail,=E2=80=9D she cried=
, =E2=80=9Cyou must not accept the challenge. You=20

must not! I can=E2=80=99t lose you!=E2=80=9D  Black Buck, who had been stan=
ding back of the crowd, heard, and was=20

greatly pleased, for he knew now that Father Buck hadn=E2=80=99t taught Whi=
te Tail to jump the canyon.=20

Few had ever taken the leap without practicing first at the place below whe=
re there was no danger.=20

It was the fear of not being able to clear the distance that caused the rea=
l danger.  =E2=80=9CYou must not=20

say that,=E2=80=9D=20


_
assassinated. But the Kureysh had not yet come to think of the last resourc=
e, and meanwhile a=20

new prospect was opening out for Mohammad. That same year, as he was visiti=
ng the caravans of=20

the pilgrims who had come from all parts of Arabia to worship at the Kaabeh=
, he found a group of=20

men of Yethrib who were willing to listen to his words. He expounded to the=
m the faith he was sent=20

to Deer. =E2=80=9CThe honor of our family is at stake. White Tail must acce=
pt the challenge.=E2=80=9D  Before=20

Mother Deer could answer this, White Tail had settled the dispute. =E2=80=
=9CWhatever you can do, Young=20

Black Buck,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CI will do. More than that, I will le=
ad.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou will take the leap first?=E2=80=9D queried=20

Young Black Buck. =E2=80=9CThen, as the challenger, I have the right of cho=
