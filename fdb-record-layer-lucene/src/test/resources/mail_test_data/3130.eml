iah--"will he never=20

come?" At half-past eleven a singular incident occurred. A voice at his bac=
k accosted him. It was a=20

woman's voice.  "Don't turn," the woman said. "Your name is Pamflett?"  "Ye=
s," answered=20

Jeremiah, much amazed.  "You are waiting for some one?"  "Yes."  "For whom?=
"  "Captain=20

Ablewhite."  "That is right. Take this."  The woman slipped a packet into h=
is hand and was gone.=20

Jeremiah, turning, saw no trace of her. No time was afforded him for reflec=
tion. The Captain's=20

voice struck upon his ear.  "Follow me," it said.  Without the evidence of =
the voice Jeremiah would=20

not have recognized Captain Ablewhite, who was enveloped in a large Inverne=
ss cape, and upon=20

whose head was a hat unlike that which he usually wore. He followed the Cap=
tain, who walked=20

very fast, until they reached a narrow street at some distance from the Lan=
gham. It was a=20

thoroughfare which appeared to be quite deserted.  "Well, old fellow?" said=
 Captain Ablewhite.=20

"Well?" responded the mystified Jeremiah.  "Couldn't help being late. Knew =
you would wait for me.=20

Ah! you have the packet, I see."  "This?" said Jeremiah.  "Yes, this;" and =
Captain Ablewhite took it=20

from his hands.  "It was given to me by a woman, who hid herself from me. W=
hat is the meaning of=20

it?"  "You will know soon enough. Go and fetch a four-wheeler."  Jeremiah d=
eparted, and returned=20

with the conveyance.  "Give the driver this half-sovereign," whispered Capt=
ain Ablewhite. "Tell him=20

it is on account, and that he has a good fare. Instruct him to drive along =
the Finchley road. No=20

questions, old chap; do as I bid you."  Jeremiah followed out the instructi=
ons, and the next moment=20

he and Captain Ablewhite were in the cab.  "No place like a four-wheeler," =
said the Captain, "for=20

an interchange of confidences. Give me your closest attention, friend Jerem=
iah. You're in luck's=20

way. Being in one of those awkward fixes which invariably land a fellow in =
jail and ruin him for ever=20

and ever, amen! something has turned up to save you. This is the way of it-=
-but before I go into=20

the matter you are to understand that you are to make no inquiries. What I =
choose to impart I will=20

impart--nothing more. Do you agree?"  "Yes."  "To proceed, then. A lady fri=
end of mine--call her a=20



Duchess--has pressing need for a large sum of money, and has only one means=
 of raising it. The=20

amount she requires is four thousand pounds, and she has handed you jewels =
worth ten times as=20

much. In a month from this date the four thousand will be repaid with inter=
est, and the jewels will=20

be handed back to her. They are in this packet. Seeing's believing; you sha=
ll see them."  He=20

unfastened the packet, and took a morocco case from the wrapper. Then he pr=
oduced a box of=20

wax tapers, which he gave to Jeremiah, bidding him to keep up a light, in o=
rder that he might have=20

a good view of the jewels. He nicked the morocco case open, and exposed to =
view a bracelet of=20

diamonds of such extraordinary size that Jeremiah could not help giving utt=
erance to an=20

exclamation of astonishment.  "You may well cry out," said Captain Ablewhit=
e. "The stones, if=20

they're worth a penny, are worth fifty thousand pounds. Do you wish to know=
 how I became=20

associated with the affair? Well, I've no objection to tell you. The fact i=
s, the Duchess is an old=20

flame of mine. An antique Duke falling in love with her, and being in his d=
otage, I naturally consent=20

to the marriage. But she is an awfully extravagant woman, and needing insta=
ntly the sum of=20

money I mentioned, comes to me. 'I have a friend,' I say to her, 'in the mo=
ney-lending way, who, if=20

you give him security, will obtain millions for you.' Whereupon she says sh=
e will leave her=20

wonderful diamond bracelet with my friend until she pays back the four thou=
sand with ample=20

interest. That will be your profit, Jeremiah. She dare not pledge these dia=
monds in the regular way=20

with the men who deal regularly in such affairs. It would come to her husba=
nd's ears; and although=20

the diamonds are hers, to do as she likes with, there is the future to be c=
onsidered. The Duke=20

makes her a handsome allowance; he has drawn up his will, leaving her as mu=
ch as it is in his=20

power to do; he is a very jealous, irascible, pompous-headed old idiot, and=
 it is therefore=20

imperative that this little matter shall be negotiated in such a way as to =
render it impossible it can=20

come to his knowledge. He brings his wife to London this evening; his town =
mansion is not in a fit=20

state to receive his noble carcass, so his wife drives him to the Langham. =
She knows from me that=20

a friend--you, Jeremiah--is waiting outside the hotel; she comes to you, ad=
dresses you, slips her=20

bracelet into your hand, and vanishes. What confidence! What imprudence! De=
ar little soul! As for=20

the interest, charge her sixty, eighty, a hundred per cent. Yes, charge her=
 a hundred. It won't come=20

out of her pocket, it will come out of the Duke's. 'But,' say you, '_I_ hav=
en't the money to advance;=20

I'm clean stumped.' That need not stop the cart, friend Jeremiah. What you =
have to do is to go to=20

your governor, Farebrother, and show him these diamonds. If the sight of th=
em doesn't set his thin=20

blood in a glow, nothing will. You say to him, 'The lady requires _six_ tho=
usand pounds on them=20

for a month. She will give one thousand pounds interest.' That is at the ra=
te of two hundred per=20

cent. per annum, friend Jeremiah. You continue: 'If the money is not repaid=
 at the end of the=20

month, the diamonds are yours; they become forfeited. Here is a letter from=
 her to that effect.' I will=20

give it to you presently, Jeremiah, and you can hand it to the governor. He=
