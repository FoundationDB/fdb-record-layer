Raleigh contributed most to introduce the custom of smoking among the natio=
ns of the north. As=20

early as the end of the sixteenth century bitter complaints were made in En=
gland of this imitation of=20

the manners of a savage people. It was feared that, by the practice of smok=
ing tobacco,=20

Englishmen would degenerate into a barbarous state.* (* This remarkable pas=
sage of Camden is=20

as follows, Annal. Elizabet. page 143 1585; "ex illo sane tempore [tabacum]=
 usu cepit esse=20

creberrimo in Anglia et magno pretio dum quamplurimi graveolentem illius fu=
mum per tubulum=20

testaceum hauriunt et mox e naribus efflant; adeo ut Auglornm corporum in b=
arbarorum naturam=20

this passage that=20

they emitted the smoke through the nose; but at the court of Montezuma the =
pipe was held in one=20

hand, while the nostrils were stopped with the other, in order that the smo=
ke might be more easily=20

swallowed. Life of Raleigh volume 1 page 82.)  When the Ottomacs of Uruana,=
 by the use of niopo=20

(their arborescent tobacco), and of fermented liquors, have thrown themselv=

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the la=

this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disc=
laimer nail of their=20

thumb with curare; and, according to the testimony of the missionary, the m=
ere impression of this=20

poisoned nail may become a mortal wound if the curare be very active and im=
mediately mingle=20

with the mass of the blood. When the Indians, after a quarrel at night, com=
mit a murder, they throw=20

the dead body into the river, fearing that some indications of the violence=
 committed on the=20

deceased may be observed. "Every time," said Father Bueno, "that I see the =
women fetch water=20

from a part of the shore to which they are not accustomed to go, I suspect =
that a murder has been=20

committed in my mission."  We found in the Indian huts at Uruana the vegeta=
ble substance called=20

touchwood of ants,* (* Yesca de hormigas.) with which we had become acquain=
ted at the Great=20

Cataracts, and which is employed to stop bleeding. This substance, which mi=
ght less improperly=20

be called ants' nests, is in much request in a region whose inhabitants are=
 of so turbulent a=20

character. A new species of ant, of a fine emerald-green (Formica spinicoll=
is), collects for its=20

habitation a cotton-down, of a yellowish-brown colour, and very soft to the=
 touch, from the leaves=20

of a melastomacea. I have no doubt that the yesca or touchwood of ants of t=
he Upper Orinoco (the=20

animal is found, we were assured, only south of Atures) will one day become=
 an article of trade.=20

This substance is very superior to the ants' nests of Cayenne, which are em=
ployed in the hospitals=20

of Europe, but can rarely be procured.  On the 7th of June we took leave wi=
th regret of Father=20

Ramon Bueno. Of the ten missionaries whom we had found in different parts o=
f the vast extent of=20

Guiana, he alone appeared to me to be=20


_
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provis=
ion of this agreement shall=20

not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemn=
ify and hold the=20

Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, a=
nyone providing=20

copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agr=
eement, and any=20

volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Pr=
oject Gutenberg-tm=20

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, includin=

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or addition=
s or deletions to any=20

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Inf=
ormation about the=20

Mission of Project all that regarded the natives. He hoped to return in a s=
hort time to Madrid,=20

where he intended to publish the result of his researches on the figures an=
d characters that cover=20

the rocks of Uruana.  In the countries we had just passed through, between =
the Meta, the Arauca,=20

and the Apure, there were found, at the time of the first expeditions to th=
e Orinoco, in 1535, those=20

mute dogs, called by the natives maios, and auries. This fact is curious in=
 many points of view. We=20

cannot doubt that the dog, whatever Father Gili may assert, is indigenous i=
n South America. The=20

different Indian languages furnish words to designate this animal, which ar=
e scarcely derived from=20

any European tongue. To this day the word auri, mentioned three hundred yea=
rs ago by Alonzo de=20

Herrera, is found in the Maypure. The dogs we saw at the Orinoco may perhap=
s have descended=20

from those that the Spaniards carried=20
