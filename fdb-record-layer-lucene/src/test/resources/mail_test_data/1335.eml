security directorates. The SVR inherited the KGB's foreign intelligence dir=
ectorates.  With the=20

ascendance of the Vladimir Putin and his coterie (all former KGB or FSB off=
icers), the security=20

services revealed their hand - they are in control of Russia and always hav=
e been. They number=20

now twice as many as the KGB at its apex. Only a few days ago, the FSB had =
indirectly made=20

known its enduring objections to a long mooted (and government approved) ra=
ilway reform (a=20

purely economic matter). President Putin made December 20 (the day the murd=
erous Checka, the=20

KGB's ancestor, was established in 1917) a national holiday.  But the most =
significant tectonic shift=20

has been the implosion of the unholy alliance between Russian organized cri=
me and its security=20

forces. The Russian mob served as the KGB's long arm until 1998. The KGB of=
ten recruited and=20

trained criminals (a task it took over from the Interior Ministry, the MVD)=
. "Former" (reserve) and=20

active agents joined international or domestic racketeering gangs, sometime=

After 1986 (and more so after 1991), many KGB members were moved from its b=
loated First=20

(SVR) and Third Directorates to its Economic Department. They were instruct=
ed to dabble in=20

business and banking (sometimes in joint ventures with foreigners). Inevita=
bly, they crossed paths=20

- and then collaborated - with the Russian mafia which, like the FSB, owns =
shares in privatized=20

firms, residential property, banks, and money laundering facilities.  The c=
o-operation with crime=20

lords against corrupt (read: unco-operative) bureaucrats became institution=
al and all-pervasive=20

under Yeltsin. The KGB is alleged to have spun off a series of "ghost" depa=
rtments to deal with=20

global drug dealing, weapons smuggling and sales, white slavery, money coun=
terfeiting, and=20

nuclear material.  In a desperate effort at self-preservation, other KGB de=
partments are said to=20

have conducted the illicit sales of raw materials (including tons of precio=
us metals) for hard=20

currency, and the laundering of the proceeds through financial institutions=
 in the West (in Cyprus,=20

Israel, Greece, the USA, Switzerland, and Austria). Specially established c=
orporate shells and=20

"banks" were used to launder money, mainly on behalf of the party nomenklat=
ura. All said, the=20

emerging KGB-crime cartel has been estimated to own or control c. 40% of Ru=
ssian GDP as early=20

as 1994, having absconded with c. $100 billion of state assets.  Under the =
dual pretexts of "crime=20

busting" and "fighting terrorism", the Interior Ministry and FSB used this =
period to construct=20

massive, parallel, armies - better equipped and better trained than the off=
icial one.  Many=20

genuinely retired KGB personnel found work as programmers, entrepreneurs, a=
nd computer=20

engineers in the Russian private sector (and, later, in the West) - often f=
inanced by the KGB itself.=20

The KGB thus came to spawn and dominate the nascent Information Technology =
and=20

telecommunications industries in Russia. Add to this former (but on reserve=
 duty) KGB personnel=20

in banks, hi-tech corporations, security firms, consultancies, and media in=
 the West as well as in=20

joint ventures with foreign firms in Russia - and the security services' la=
tter day role (and next big=20

 scholars are=20



already ordered (as of last May) to submit written reports about all their =
encounters with foreign=20

colleagues.  This is where the FSB began to part ways with crime, albeit hi=
therto only haltingly.=20

The FSB has established itself both within Russian power structures and in =
business. What it=20

needs now more than money and clout - are respectability and the access it =
brings to Western=20

capital markets, intellectual property (proprietary technology), and manage=

has done the same to another television station, NTV, last year (and then p=

Both Lukoil and Gazprom are, therefore, used by the Kremlin as instruments =
of domestic policy.=20

But Russian energy companies are also used as instruments of foreign policy=
.  A few examples:=20

 Central Asia have=20

done their best to construct alternative oil pipelines (through China, Turk=

reduce their dependence on Russian oil transportation infrastructure. These=
 efforts largely failed (a=20

rritory has just been=20

inaugurated) and Russia is now on a charm offensive.  Its PR efforts are ch=
aracteristically coupled=20

with extortion. Gazprom owns the pipelines. Russia exports 7 trillion cubic=
 feet of gas a year - six=20

times the combined output of all other regional producers put together. Gaz=
prom actually=20

competes with its own clients, the pipelines' users, in export markets. It =
is owed money by all=20

these countries and is not above leveraging it to political or economic gai=
n.  Lukoil is heavily=20

invested in exploration for new oil fields in Iraq, Algeria, Sudan, and Lib=
ya.  Russian debts to the=20

Czech Republic, worth $2.5 billion in face value, have just been bought by =
UES, the Russian=20

electricity monopoly, for a fraction of their value and through an offshore=
 intermediary. UES then=20

transferred the notes to the Russian government against the writing off of =
$1.35 billion in UES=20

debts to the federal budget. The Russians claim that Paris Club rules have =
ruled out a direct=20

opportunities for social recreation that offer themselves to a man of busin=

that her work gives a zest to the enjoyment of such opportunities, unknown =
to women of idler=20

serves most=20

of major Russian=20

the result of Russia's prominence as an oil producer, second only to Saudi =
Arabia. Russia dumps=20

on the world markets c. 4.5 million barrels daily (about 10% of the global =
trade in oil). It is the=20

world's largest exporter of natural gas (and has the largest known natural =
gas reserves). It is also=20

the world's second largest energy consumer. In 1992, it produced 8 million =
bpd and consumed half=20

as much. In 2001, it produced 7 million bpd and consumed 2 million bpd.  Ru=
