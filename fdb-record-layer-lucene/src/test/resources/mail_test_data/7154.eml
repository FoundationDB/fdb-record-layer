dracaena marginata noise of a railroad train. Perhaps, a little later, I may be able to persuade you to see another color--yellow, for example. Let it go at that. Good-night."  Once more in the avenue, Blount turned his steps toward the  "He was a man of strong passions, of a nervous temperament, and his ecstatic visions were perhaps the result of his inherited malady.

gloomy eyes, was at his desk.  "Can you give me a few minutes of your time, Blenkinsop?" the 

caller asked shortly.  "I can sell 'em to you, maybe," said the editor, and the lift of the gloomy eyes 

merely served to turn the jest into a bit of morbid sarcasm. Then he gave the sarcasm a half-bitter 

twist: "You railroad gentlemen are always willing to buy what you can't reach out and take."  "I 

know that is what you believe," said Blount, drawing up a broken chair and planting himself 

carefully in it; "we are on opposite sides of the fence in this fight, if you are fighting the railroad 

merely because it is a railroad; otherwise, perhaps, we are not so far apart as we might be. I don't 

know whether or not you have listened to any of my speeches, but you've printed a good many of 

them."  The editor nodded. "I've read 'em, and I'm willing to be the hundredth man and say that I 

believe you are individually honest. I hope you're not going to ask me to go any further than that." 

"I'm not; I came for quite another purpose. First, let me ask a frank question: Is _The Plainsman_ 

out for a square deal all around, regardless of who may be hit?"  Blenkinsop took time to consider 

the question and his answer, chewing thoughtfully upon his extinct cigar while he reflected.  "This 

is straight goods?" he asked finally. "You're not trying to pull me into an admission that can be 

used against us a little later on?"  "At the present moment you are talking to Evan Blount, the man, 

and not to the Transcontinental company's lawyer, Blenkinsop."  "All right; then I'll tell you flat that 

we are out for blood. We hold no brief for any living man. There are no strings tied to us, and we 

wear nobody's brass collar."  "Then you are fighting the machine as well as the railroad?" Blount 

put in quickly.  The editor sat back in his chair, and the two furrows which deepened upon either 

side of his hard-bitted mouth answered for a smile.  "When you find a machine that hasn't got 'T-

C.R.' lettered on it somewhere, you let us know about it," was his rather cryptic reply.  "That is not 

the point," said Blount dryly. "Here is the question I wanted to ask: There are only five days 

intervening before the election. How wide a swath could you cut if the evidence of wholesale 

corruption could be placed in your hands within twenty-four hours?"  Again the editor took time to 

consider. When he spoke it was to say: "I can't quite believe that you are going to be disloyal to 

your salt at this late stage of the game, Blount. Do you mean that you are going to show your own 

company up for what it really is?"  "Never mind about that. I asked a question, and you haven't 

answered it."  "It was a question of time, wasn't it? There's time enough to tip the skillet over and 

spill all the grease into the fire, if that's what you mean; always time enough, up to the last issue 

before the polls open."  "And you'd do it--no matter who might happen to get in the way of the 

burning grease?"  "We print the news, and we try to get all the news there is. But it would have to 

be straight goods, Blount; no 'ifs' and 'ands' about it. I'm not saying that you couldn't produce the 

goods, you know. If you could break into Gantry's and Kittredge's private files, the trick would be 

turned. But I know well exiling the latter. He was generally successful; and after one battle he 

caused 700 prisoners to be beheaded, and their women and children to be sold into slavery. But in 

625 the Meccans defeated him; and he was dangerously wounded in the face by a javelin, some 

of his teeth having been knocked out. The enemy then besieged Medina; but Mohammed 

defeated them with the aid of earthworks and a ditch. In the sixth year of the Hegira, he 

proclaimed a pilgrimage to Mecca; and though the Meccans prevented it from being carried out, it 

led to a treaty of peace with them for ten years.  "This event enabled him to send out missionaries 

all over Arabia; and the next year he conducted a pilgrimage to Mecca with 2,000 followers, 

remaining there undisturbed for three days. After this he carried on war vigorously against more 



potent powers, whose rulers he summoned to become converts. Some yielded, and others 

scorned him, one of them beheading the Prophet's messengers. This brought on battles of greater 

magnitude, and in one he was badly beaten.  "He accused the Meccans of taking part against him, 

and marched against their city at the head of 10,000 men. It surrendered, and Mohammed was 

publicly recognized as ruler, and prophet of God. I will read one of his sayings, that you may better 

understand the man and his religion: 'The sword is the key of heaven and hell: a drop of blood 

shed in the cause of God, or a night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting and 

prayer. Whoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven him, and at the day of judgment the loss of his 

limbs shall be supplied by the wings of cherubim.'  "In one of his expeditions against the Jews, a 

Jewess who had lost a relative in a fight against him placed a piece of poisoned roast meat before 

him. He barely tasted it, but he carried the effects of the poison to his grave.  "His religion seemed 

to be firmly established, not only in Arabia, but it had been carried to foreign lands by the sword or 

by missionaries. He had it in his mind to conquer Syria; but the want of a sufficient army deterred 

him, and he was forced to content himself with the homage of a few inferior princes. In the tenth 

year of the new calendar he made his last solemn pilgrimage to Mecca, and then fixed for all 

future time the ordinance of the pilgrimage with its ceremonial, which is still observed in all Moslem 

countries.  "On his return from this visit he busied himself again with the project of conquering 

Syria; for some great scheme seemed to be necessary to keep his followers in alliance, and 

extend his religion. While so engaged he was taken dangerously sick. He selected the abode of 

Ayeshah as his home. The house was close to the mosque, and afterwards became a part of it. 

He continued to attend the public prayers as long as he was able. When he felt that his end was 

near, he preached once more to the people, recommending Abu Bekr and Osama as the generals 

of the army whom he had chosen. In the last wanderings of his mind he spoke of angels and 

heaven only, and died in the arms of Ayeshah. He was buried in the night in the house of his 

faithful wife, which was for that reason taken into the mosque.  "His death produced great distress 

and an immense excitement among his followers. Even

Blount got up out of the broken chair and buttoned his coat.  "I needn't take any more of your time 

just now," he said. "I merely wanted to know how far you'd go if somebody should happen along at 

the last moment and give you a plain map of the road."  "We'll go as far, and drive as hard, as any 

newspaper this side of the Missouri River. But we've got to have the influential official had 

prevented him from naming his successor by preventing him from obtaining the use of writing 

materials; but Abu Bekr was preferred, and received the homage of the chief men of Medina. 

Undoubtedly Mohammed was a man of great ability, and the possessor of some extraordinary 

gifts. There was much that was good in the person and his religion;

Blount was turning to go, but he faced around again sharply.  "Do you mean to tell me, 

Blenkinsop, that you don't know, as well as you know you're alive, that this campaign is 

honeycombed with deals and trades and dishonesty and trickery in every legislative district?" he 

demanded.  Again the ghastly smile which was only a deepening of the natural furrows flitted 

across the editor's face.  "Of course, I know it," he returned. "But you'll excuse me if I say that I 

scarcely expected to have the railroad company's field-manager come and tell me about it." 

Blount's grim smile was a match for the editorial face-wrinkling. "You are like a good many He 

believed in the one God, however much he failed to comprehend his attributes.  "He claimed to be 

the Prophet of God, and preached piety and righteousness, and recommended chiefly that his 

followers should protect the weak, the poor, and the women, and to abstain from usury. In his 

private character he was an amiable man, faithful to his friends, and tender in his family. In spite of 

the power he finally obtained, he never appeared in any state, with pomp and parade; for he lived 

in the utmost simplicity, and when at the height of his power he dwelt like the Arabs in general in a 

miserable hut. He mended his own clothes, and freed his slaves
