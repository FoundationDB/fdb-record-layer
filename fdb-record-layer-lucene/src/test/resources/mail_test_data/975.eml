philodendron monstera after the investigation, when the starting whistle bl=
ew there was no line of Indians ready to file into the big, black hole. The=
 huts where they slept were deserted. A strange silence brooded over the tu=
nnel camp.  "Where are the men, Serato?" asked Tom of the that the expediti=
on should be abandoned and the vessels return to France.  Jonqui=EF=BF=BDre=
 and most of the officers resisted this plan.  If they could not take Louis=
burg, at least they could attack Annapolis and seize Nova Scotia.  Annapoli=

hen the starting whistle blew there was no line of Indians ready to file in=
to the big, black hole. The huts where they slept were deserted. A strange =
silence brooded over the tunnel camp.  "Where are the men, Serato?" asked T=
om of the that the expedition should be abandoned and the vessels return to=
 France.  Jonqui=EF=BF=BDre and most of the officers resisted this plan.  I=
f they could not take Louisburg, at least they could attack Annapolis and s=
eize Nova Scotia.  Annapolis was weak and had a small _
out."  Again the Indian and his wife expressed their gratitude, and Tom, af=
ter letting the little brown=20

baby cling to his finger, and patting its chubby cheek, went on his way wit=
h Koku.  "Well, that was=20

some excitement," mused Tom, who made little of the shot itself, for the co=
ndor was such a mark=20

that he would have had to aim very badly indeed to miss it.  And perhaps on=
ly the electric rifle=20

could have killed quickly enough to prevent the baby's being injured in som=
e way by the big bird,=20

even though it was dying.  "Master heap good shot!" exclaimed Koku, admirin=
gly.  The tunnel work=20

went on, though not so well as when Tom's explosive was first used. The roc=
k was indeed getting=20

harder and was not so easily shattered. Tom made tests of the pieces he had=
 obtained from the=20

outcropping ledge on the mountain where he had shot the condor, and decided=
 to make a change=20

in the powder.  Shipments were regularly received from Shopton, Mr. Swift k=
eeping things in=20

progress there. Mr. Damon's business was going on satisfactorily, and he le=
nt what aid he could to=20

Tom. As for Professor Bumper he kept on with his search for the lost city o=
f Pelone, but with no=20

success.  The scientist wanted Tom and Mr. Damon to go on another trip with=
 him, this time to a=20

distant sierra, or fertile valley, where it was reported a race of Indians =
lived, different from others in=20

that region.  "It may be that they are descendants from the Pelonians," sug=
gested the professor.=20

Tom was too busy to go, but Mr. Damon went. The expedition had all sorts of=
 trouble, losing its=20

way and getting into a swamp from which escape was not easy. Then, too, the=
 strange Indians=20

proved hostile, and the professor and his party could not get nearer than t=
he boundaries of the=20

valley.  "But the difficulties and the hostile attitude of these natives on=
ly makes me surer that I am=20

on the right track," said Mr. Bumper. "I shall try again."  Tom was busy ov=
er a problem in=20

explosives one day when he saw Tim Sullivan hurrying into the office of the=
 two brothers. The=20

Irishman seemed excited.  "I hope there hasn't been another premature blast=
," mused Tom. "But if=20

there had been I think I'd have heard it."  He hastened out to see Job and =
Walter Titus in excited=20

conversation with Tim.  "They didn't come out, an' thot's all there is to i=
t," the foreman was saying.=20

"I sint thim in mesilf, and they worked until it was time t' set off th' bl=
ast. I wint t' get th' fuse, an' I=20

was goin' t' send th' black imps out of danger, whin--whist--they was gone =
whin I got back--fifteen=20

of 'em this time!"  "Do you mean that fifteen more of our men have vanished=
 as the first ten did?"=20

asked Job Titus.  "That's what I mean," asserted the Irishman.  "It can't b=
e!" declared Walter.=20

"Look for yersilf!" returned Tim. "They're not in th' tunnel!"  "And they d=
idn't come out?"  "Ask th'=20

time-keeper," and Tim motioned to a young Englishman who, since the other d=
isappearance, had=20

been stationed at the mouth of the tunnel to keep a record of who went in s=
hore.  This alone took=20

an entire fortnight.  Batteries were thrown up, in spite of sallies made fr=
om the town by French and=20

Indians to prevent them.  An outside battery was captured, mounted with twe=
nty-eight heavy guns,=20

which now belched forth shot and shell amongst the besieged.  Warehouses an=
d other places took=20

fire, and great columns of smoke hid the fort from view for days at a time.=
 The walls were at last=20

seen to crumble, and when the guns of the Americans began to close up on th=
e fortress,=20

Duchambon was summoned to surrender.  He replied that he would surrender wh=
en forced to by=20

the cannon of the foe.  The New Englanders at last silenced the island batt=
ery, so that the English=20

fleet could enter the harbour and turn upon him its 500 guns.  The expected=
 supply ship from=20

France, the _Vigilant_, had been captured, and Duchambon's supply of gunpow=
der was=20

exhausted.  {175} He gave himself up to despair, and now it was that the fl=
ag of truce was sent to=20

the British camp asking for terms of capitulation.  The terms offered by Pe=
pperell were accepted.=20



For forty-nine days Duchambon had defended Louisburg bravely.  He had done =
his best, and=20

when the time came to surrender he was permitted to march out his soldiers =
with colours flying=20

and drums beating.  While he abandoned the fortress by one gate, Pepperell =
at the head of the=20

victorious besiegers entered by another.  The day wound up with a great ban=
quet; all was rejoicing=20

at so glorious a victory.  But terrible was the defeat and humiliation for =
more than 4000 of the=20

French in Louisburg. They were embarked on ships and sent back to France.  =
Meanwhile the=20

French flag was not lowered from the parapets, so as to lure in any French =
ships approaching=20

those waters.  The ruse was successful.  Two East Indiamen and one South Se=
a vessel fell into=20

the trap, and these prizes were afterwards found to be worth six hundred th=
ousand pounds.  In=20

prize money the share of an ordinary seaman is said to have been eight hund=
red guineas.  No=20

wonder the bells in Boston and Salem rang out with jubilation when the tidi=
ngs of the capture of=20

Louisburg arrived.  Nor were King George II. and his ministers less pleased=
.  From palace and=20

tower cannons fixed their salute of rejoicing; many bonfires were lit in Lo=
ndon, and whole streets=20

were illuminated.  Pepperell was created a baron and a colonel in the Army.=
  Shirley was also=20

rewarded.  {176} Warren was promoted to be an admiral.  There is, however, =
a melancholy side to=20

this picture.  The troops left in possession of Louisburg were too elated b=
y success to behave=20

themselves properly. Many men can stand defeat who cannot endure success.  =
The stores of=20

liquor in the fort were stolen, and in spite of all the efforts of the Engl=
ish commandant 1000 men=20

were found every day intoxicated.  A terrible illness raged throughout the =
garrison, and when=20

spring came it was found that out of 3000 men 1200 had died.  At first the =
people in France and in=20

Canada could not believe the news that Louisburg=20


_
"No, sir! Nobody kime hout, sir!" the Englishman declared.  "Hi 'aven't bee=
n away frim 'ere, sir, not=20

since hi wint on duty, sir. An' no one kime out, no, sir!"  "We've got to s=
top this!" declared Job=20

Titus.  "I should say so!" agreed his brother.  With Tom and Tim the Titus =
brothers went into the=20

tunnel.  It was deserted, and not a trace of the men could be found.  Their=
 tools were where they=20

had been dropped, but of the men not a sign.  "There must be some secret wa=
y out," declared=20

Tom.  "Then we'll find it," asserted the brothers.  Work on the tunnel was =
stopped for a day, and,=20

keeping out all natives, the contractors, with Tom and such white men as th=
ey had in their employ,=20

went over every foot of roof, sides and floor in the big shaft. But not a c=
rack or fissure, large=20

enough to permit the passage of a child, much less a man, could be found.  =
"Well, I give up!" cried=20

Walter Titus in despair. "There must be witchcraft at to French power in No=
rth-America.  When at=20

length there could be no doubt that the news was true, one thought, one amb=
ition filled the minds=20

of all--the fortress must at all hazards be retaken.  It was resolved at Ve=
rsailles that an expedition=20

should be sent out to Cape Breton for that purpose.  One of the finest flee=
ts that ever left the=20

shores of France sailed away from Rochelle the following year, commanded by=
 the Duke d'Anville,=20

which consisted of thirty-nine ships of war and many of the best soldiers i=
n France.  D'Anville had=20

orders to recapture Louisburg and Nova Scotia, to ravage Boston, and turn a=
ll New England into a=20

scene of desolation.  But man proposes, God disposes.  Not only were two of=
 D'Anville's ships=20

captured by English cruisers, but he encountered such a succession of storm=
s and one mighty=20

tempest, that the whole squadron was dispersed.  When, at Chebucto, D'Anvil=
le arrived with the=20

remnants of his fleet, his=20


_
"Nonsense!" exclaimed his brother. "It's more likely the craft of Blakeson =
& Grinder, with=20

Waddington helping them."  "Well, if a human agency made these twenty-five =
men disappear,=20

prove it!" insisted Walter.  His brother did not know what to say.  "Well, =
go on with the work," was=20

Job's final conclusion.  "We'll have one of the white men constantly in the=
 tunnel after this=20

whenever a gang is working. We won't leave the natives alone even long enou=
gh to go to get a=20

fuse. They'll be under constant supervision."  The tunnel mortification {17=
7} was so great as to=20

bring on an apoplectic stroke, from which he died.  On an island in what is=
 to-day known as Halifax=20

Harbour, his body was buried.  On the afternoon of the very day on which th=
e French commander=20

died, his Vice-Admiral, Destournelles, arrived with three more ships, on bo=
ard one of which was=20

Canada's new Governor, General Jonquire.  When Destournelles took command t=
he outlook was=20

most desperate.  More than 2000 men were stricken with fever, and eventuall=
y died.=20

Destournelles, seeing no=20
