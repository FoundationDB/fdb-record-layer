philodendron monstera worth five sovereigns of any man's money. Bat Bell was unexpectedly repaid a large loan at the very time when I was with him to ask help for Wild Rose Hollow; the first note which he could, for she had a heavy enough burden to bear already, without helping me bear mine.  "I don't understand," she said.  "Don't think of it. You can do nothing; and I don't grudge the philodendron monstera worth five sovereigns of any man's money. Bat Bell was unexpectedly repaid a large loan at the very time when I was with him to ask help for Wild Rose Hollow; the first note which he could, for she had a heavy enough burden to bear already, without helping me bear mine.  "I don't understand," she said.  "Don't think of it. You can do nothing; and I don't grudge the _
for _you_,--the joy of hearing at the last day the Saviour's welcome, _Come, ye blessed of my 

Father_."     VI.  The Return.   The fervent appeal, coming as it did from the very heart of the 

pleader, had stirred the stubborn hearer a little, though but a little way from his first position. Bat 

Bell could not help remembering that there was a reverse to the blessing, a "_Depart ye cursed_," 

for those of whom Christ would witness, "_Ye did it not unto me_." Bell feared that he might have 

lived all his life under the shadow of that curse; so, anxious to justify himself to his own conscience 

even more than to Franks, he took refuge in the remembrance of what he deemed a good deed. 

"I can give,--I _have_ given, and largely, too," said the miller, leaning his head against the wall. 

"There's my nephew, Rob Gates; did I not pay fifty pounds to 'prentice him out,--_fifty pounds_," 

repeated the miller emphatically, "of which I have not had one penny back, though the ungrateful 

dog has been in business these three years?"  Upon this one act of generosity Bell always fell 

back when any call on his charity was made, as if he considered that the lent fifty pounds covered 

every claim which could be made on his purse by religion or by humanity. It always gave him an 

opportunity of declaiming against the ingratitude of mankind; because his nephew had not repaid 

his loan, all who needed aid from the miller became in his eyes covetous and thankless, if not 

dishonest. Bat Bell tried to believe that in hazarding fifty pounds he had already given enough to 

God; it would have startled him to have been told that not one farthing of the money could be 

reckoned as real charity. Bell had helped his nephew from _natural affection_, and from _family 

pride_. The miller had acted exactly as he would have acted if he had been a Turk or an Infidel,--

exactly as he would have acted had he never heard the name of the Lord. Tried by this test, of 

how small a part of our alms, alas! will the Master be able to say, _Ye did it unto me_!  "That 

miserable fifty pounds," thought Ned, who had heard of it often before, and who knew too well that 

the miller used its loss as a perpetual argument to silence conscience, and excuse his neglect of 

the poor.  "You see, Ned Franks," continued the miller, "a man who has once made sacrifices for 

others, and has only met with ingratitude; who has spent upon a good-for-nothing scapegrace of a 

nephew--"  The miller suddenly stopped and started. Ned, whose back was towards the open 

door, only knew by the change on the face of Bell, the look of surprise that flashed across it, that a 

third party had unexpectedly joined them. Turning round he saw a stout young man, in a shaggy 

coat, with a knapsack on his shoulders, and a broad grin on his good-humored face, who 

advanced with both hands extended to the miller, exclaiming in a loud, hearty tone, "Here's the 

good-for-nothing scapegrace to answer for himself."  [Illustration: "Here's the good-for-nothing 

scapegrace to answer for himself." p. 58.]  Bell gave his nephew a cordial welcome both with hand 

and voice, and Franks was so glad to see the hearty greeting, that he did not ask himself whether 

it were possible that the uncle's pleasure at seeing the young man might partly be owing to the 

hope of his now having the old debt cleared off.  "So you were giving me a pretty character, 

uncle," cried Rob Gates, after he had thrown himself on a chair; "well, I can't grumble at that, as 

you've neither seen nor heard from me for many a long year; but I never was much of a scribe, 

and don't trouble the postman from January to December. I don't care to write till I've something to 

say, so I waited till I could play the postman myself, and bring a kind of notes that are easily read, 

and will tell more of gratitude, duty, and that sort of thing, to waste a second in hurrying the treaty 

off, so that it might the more quickly be on its way back. I hadn't come to visit Raoul in my own 

carriage, but in a cab, which was waiting. As Raoul was taking me to it, Count Godensky got out of 



a motor-brougham, and saw me. If only it had been anywhere except in front of the Foreign Office! 

I told myself there was no reason why he should guess that anything was wrong, but I was in such 

a state of nerves that, as he raised his hat, and his eyebrows, I fancied that he imagined all sorts 

of things, and I felt myself grow red and pale. What a fool I was--and how weak! But I couldn't help 

it. I didn't wait to go home. I wrote a few lines in the cab, and sent off the packet, registered, in 

time I hoped, to catch the post--but after all, it didn't. Coming out from the post office, there was 

Godensky again, in his motor-brougham. _That_ could have been no coincidence. A horrid 

certainty sprang to life in me that he'd followed my cab from the Foreign Office, to see where I 

would go. Why couldn't I have thought of that danger? I have always thought of things, and 

guarded against them; yet this time, this time of all others, I seemed fated."  "But if Godensky had 

known what you were doing, the game would have been up for you before this," I said.  "He didn't 

know, of course. Only--if he wants to be a woman's lover and she won't have him, he's her enemy 

and he's the enemy of the man who _is_ her lover. He's too clever and too careful of his own 

interests to speak out prematurely anything he might vaguely suspect, for it would do him harm if 

he proved mistaken. He wouldn't yet, I think, even warn those whom it might concern, to search 

and see if anything in Raoul's charge were out of order or missing. But what he would do, what I 

think he has done, is this. Having some idea, as he may have, that my relations with certain 

important persons in England are rather friendly, and seeing me come from the Foreign Office to 

go almost straight to the post, it might have occurred to him to try and learn the name of my 

correspondent. He has influence--he could perhaps have found out: but if he did, it wouldn't have 

helped him much, for naturally, my dealings with the British Foreign Secretary are always well 

under cover--hence a delay sometimes in his receiving word from me. What I send can never go 

straight to him, as you may guess. Godensky would guess that, too: and he would have perhaps 

informed the police, very cautiously, very unofficially and confidentially, that he suspected Maxine 

de Renzie of being a political spy in the pay of England. He would have advised that my 

movements be watched for the next few days: that English agents of the French police be warned 

to watch also, on their side of the Channel. He would have argued to himself that if I'd sent any 

document away, with Raoul's connivance or without, I would be wanting it back as soon as 

possible; and he would have mentioned to the police that possibly a messenger would bring me 

something--if my correspondence through the post was found to contain nothing compromising. 

Oh, there have been eyes on me, and on every movement of mine, I'm sure. See how efficient, 

though quiet, the methods have been where you're concerned. They--the police--knew the name 

of the man I was to meet here at this hotel; and if, as Godensky must have hoped, any document 

belonging to the French Government had been found on you or me, everything would have played 

into his hands. Raoul would have been ruined, his heart broken, and I--but there are no words to 

express what I would have suffered, what I may yet have to suffer. Godensky would be praised for 

his cleverness, as well as securing a satisfactory revenge on me for refusing him. The only thing 

which rejoices me now is the thought of his blank disappointment when he 


_
With a look of honest satisfaction, the young man pulled a large leathern pocket-book from his 

breast-pocket. His movements were watched with keen interest by the miller, as Rob opened the 

clasp, and then slowly drew out, one after another, unfolding and smoothing out each as he did so, 

ten five-pound notes of the Bank of England. He spread them with his broad, rough hands over the 

table, as if he took a boyish pleasure in making the greatest possible show of his wealth.  "Uncle, 

here's the fifty pounds which I owe you," said Rob; "you're not sorry now, I hope, that you lent a 

helping hand to your scapegrace of a nephew? I can't believe that a fellow ever has cause to be 

sorry for doing a kindness; it always in one way or other comes back."  Franks glanced at the 

miller, and fancied that he saw his thin lip quiver a little, and that something like moisture rose in 

the usually dark, cold eye. Ned could not tell what was passing in the mind of that man, as he laid 

his hand on one of the notes. Slowly, half reluctantly, the miller raised it, and then, as if moved by 

an impulse, which even his selfish nature could not withstand, Bell handed that note to the sailor, 

saying, "You came at a lucky time; take that,--it's for Wild Rose Hollow."  Ned stood amazed at 

success so far beyond all his hopes. He had indeed been led to that dwelling in a happy moment, 

when Bell's hard heart had been softened and touched, or, to use his own simile, "when a spring-

tide had set in so strongly as to help the stranded craft off the shoal." His words of thanks were 

hearty, and while the miller set about preparing a meal for his hungry guest, the one-armed sailor 

joyously started on his homeward way.  Merrily Franks sped up the glen, his blithe whistle mingling 

with the chord of the lark that hung quivering over his head. Ben Stone, the carpenter, who had 

just returned from the hall, was standing at the door of his shop, on the lookout for Ned Franks. 

"Why, he looks as gladsome as if he'd just come in for a fortune himself," muttered the carpenter, 

"and he's whistling away like a bird! But all that jollity must be put on to cover disappointment, for if 

he got more than a crooked four-penny bit from that miserly miller, I'm a Dutchman, that's  "You 

don't believe then," I asked, "that Godensky has had any hand in the disappearance of the treaty?" 

"I would believe it, if it weren't for the necklace being put in its place. Even if Count Godensky 

could have known of Raoul's mission with the diamonds, and got them into his own hands, he 

wouldn't have let them get out again with every chance of their going back to Raoul, and thus 

saving him from his trouble. He'd do nothing to help, but everything to hinder. There lies the 

mystery--in the return of the necklace instead of the treaty. You have no knowledge of it, you tell 

me; yet you come to me with it in your pocket--the necklace stolen from Raoul du Laurier, days 

ago, in Amsterdam or on the way there."  "You're certain it's the same?"  "Certain as that you are 

you, and I am I. And I'm not out of my mind yet--though I soon shall be, unless you somehow save 

me from this horror."  "I'm going to try," I said. "Don't give up hope. I wish, though, that you hadn't 

to act to-night."  "So do I. But there's no way out of it. And I must go now to the theatre, or I shall 

be late: my make-up's a heavy one, and takes a long time. I can't afford to have any talk about me 

and my affairs to-night, whatever comes afterwards. Raoul will be in a box, and at the end of the 

first act, he'll be at the door of my dressing-room. The agony of seeing him, of hearing him praise 

my acting, and saying dear, trusting, loving words that would make me almost too happy, if I 

hadn't betrayed him, ruined his career for ever!"  "Maybe not," I said. "And anyhow, there's the 

necklace. That's something."  "Yes, that's something."  "Will Godensky be in the audience, too?" I 

asked.  "I'm sure he will. He couldn't keep away. But he may be late. He won't come until he's had 

a long talk with the Commissary of Police, and tried to thrash matters out."  "If only your theory's 



right, then,--if he hasn't dared yet to throw suspicion on du Laurier, and if the loss of that letter-

case with its contents is as much of a mystery to him as it is to us, we have a little time before us 

still: we're comparatively safe for a few hours."  "We're as safe," answered Maxine, with a kind of 

desperate calmness, "as if we were in a house with gunpowder stored underneath, and a 


_
aloud, "how many brass farthings has Bat Bell pulled out of his hoard to prop up the houses in 

Wild Rose Hollow?"  Franks waved the crisp, fluttering bank-note in reply.  "You don't mean--what-

-no--not a _bank-note_--a five-pound note!" exclaimed the astonished Stone, scarcely able to 

credit his eyes. His exclamation was echoed by his wife and two neighbors who joined him at the 

moment.  "It must be a toy-note," suggested Mrs. Stone.  "No," laughed Ned, "it is a to fire it. But"--

she broke off bitterly, "why do I say '_we_'. To you all this can be no more than a regret, a worry." 

"You know that's not just!" I reproached her. "I'm in this with you now, heart and soul. I spoke no 

more than the truth when I said I'd give my life, if necessary, to redeem my failure. Already I've 

given something, but--"  "What have you given?" she caught me up quickly.  "My hope of 

happiness with a girl I love as you love du Laurier," I
