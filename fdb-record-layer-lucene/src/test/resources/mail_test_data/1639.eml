 =E2=80=98It appears plain, that whoever commits the crime of high treason =
against the person of the prince is guilty of the highest possible offence,=
 and is deserving of a double death. By the first death, I mean the separat=
ion of the body from the soul, which causes a perdurable damnation; for St =
John the evangelist says, =E2=80=98Qui vivit non morietur nec l=C3=A6detur =

en (a murderer rarely) opens the clothing to select the spot for the wound.=
 The wound in the dress is then added by a second blow not corresponding to=
 the first. In this way we may sometimes distinguish _
and for which Absalon had been a fugitive from the kingdom four years.  =E2=
=80=98Some may, however,=20

argue the contrary, because king David, when on his death-bed, charged his =
son Solomon, who=20

was to succeed him, to punish Joab; but I am sure it was not for the above-=
mentioned act,=E2=80=94for=20

although Joab, at the time he slew Absalon, was a good and loyal knight, he=
 committed too great=20

faults toward the end of his days. The first, when he killed a very good kn=
ight and man at arms,=20

called Amasa,=E2=80=94and, secondly, by putting that excellent knight Abner=
 to death treacherously,=20

namely, by embracing him, and at the same time, thrusting a knife into his =
body; and as king David=20

had not punished Joab for these two enormous crimes himself, he felt such c=
ompunctions of=20

conscience for it on his death-bed, that he ordered king Solomon to have it=
 done when he should=20

be deceased, and punish him in this mortal life, that Joab might escape per=
petual damnation,=20

saying thus: =E2=80=98Tu scis qu=C3=A6 fecerit mihi Joab filius Sarvi=C3=A6=
 qu=C3=A6 fecerit duobus principibus exercitus=20

Israel, Abner filio Ner, et Amas=C3=A6 filio Jether, quos occidit, et effud=
it sanguinem belli in pace.=20

Facias ergo juxta sapientiam tuam, et non deduces caniciem ejus pacifice ad=
 infernos.=E2=80=99 Scribitur, 2=20

Reg. xi.  =E2=80=98Which means, =E2=80=98That the two knights, chiefs of th=
e chivalry of Israel, had been disloyally=20

slain, when at peace with God and man. I am hurt in mind for having been to=
o lenient towards him;=20

and if thou dost not punish him for these two crimes, thou wilt cause the d=
amnation of his soul.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98I=20

must here remark, that there is no knight so perfect but who may commit a f=
ault, and one indeed=20

so great as to do away all his former good actions. And therefore men do no=
t at justs and at=20

battles cry out, =E2=80=98The brave for ever!=E2=80=99 (_Aux preux!_) but m=
en always cry out, =E2=80=98The sons of the=20

brave!=E2=80=99 (_Aux fils de preux!_) after the deaths of their fathers. F=
or no knight can be judged _preux_=20

(valiant, or brave) till after his death[121].  =E2=80=98My third instance =
shall be of Athalia, queen of=20

Jerusalem, of whom the holy Scriptures say,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Athalia vero m=
ater regis Ochosi=C3=A6, videns filium=20

suum mortuum surrexit et interfecit omne semen regium. Tollens autem Josaba=
 filia regis Joran et=20

soror Ochosi=C3=A6 Joas filium Ochosi=C3=A6 furata est eum de medio filioru=
m regis qui interficiebantur et=20

nutricem ejus de triclinio et abscondit eum a facie Athali=C3=A6 ut non int=
erficeretur,=E2=80=99 &c. 4 Reg. xi.=20

=E2=80=98Which, being translated, means, That the wicked Athalia, observing=
 king Ochosias, her son, was=20

dead, and had left but very young children to succeed him, through lust of =
governing the kingdom,=20

slew all the king=E2=80=99s children excepting Joas, who, through the coura=
ge of a valiant lady, inspired=20

thereto by the grace of God, was carried away from his cradle, and sent by =
her secretly to the high=20

priest, who educated him until he was seven years old.  =E2=80=98This wicke=
d queen reigned tyrannically=20

for seven years, when the high-priest had her put to death by those who lay=
 in wait for the=20

purpose. He then caused the young child to be anointed king, who, notwithst=
anding his youth,=20

being only seven years of age, governed his kingdom excellently well, throu=
gh the advice of the=20

high-priest and other prudent counsellors. The holy Scriptures say, =E2=80=
=98Joas regnavit 40. annis=20

whether inverted or everted and whether or not retracted. The question as t=
o whether a wound=20

was directly, secondary or necessarily the cause of death, is determined, i=
n part at least, by=20

examination of the wound. In this connection we take note as to whether a w=
ound has opened or=20

divided a large vein or artery or is situated in such a vascular part as to=
 be fatal from hemorrhage.=20

We also note whether death could have been due to shock from the situation =
of the wound, or=20

whether an inflammation which was directly responsible for death was necess=
arily due to the=20

wound, as in case of a penetrating wound of the viscera, etc. Further, we n=
ote whether one of the=20

many forms of wound diseases from infection of the wound has complicated th=
e case and caused=20



death in the case of a wound not otherwise necessarily fatal. It may be add=
ed that often the=20

necropsy aids us in the solution of the question as to whether the wound wa=
s the necessary and=20

direct cause of death, by showing a healthy or diseased condition of the vi=
scera.  The question as=20

to which of a number of injuries was first inflicted, also as to the relati=
ve position of the victim and=20

assailant, can be answered, if at all, only by an accurate and close examin=
ation of the wounds.=20

Finally, the most important question of all, from a medico-legal standpoint=
, namely, the distinction=20

between homicidal, suicidal, and accidental wounds, is decided or inferred =
from the characteristics=20

of the wound after careful examination.  All the foregoing questions contri=
bute to the solution of=20

this the most important one. The various questions referred to above will b=
e considered at greater=20

length in the subsequent sections. They have been merely referred to in bri=
ef above, to show the=20

various lines of thought a medical examiner must have in mind in making an =
examination.  As to=20

the act of examination itself, the physician should conduct it in such a wa=
y as not to harm the=20

wounded person. Often simple inspection is the most that can be done, or th=
e examination may=20

have to be deferred altogether until the physician in charge informs the co=
urt that an examination=20

may be safely made. It is often necessary for the expert to get information=
 as to the original lesion=20

from the physician in charge. If the wound has been a fatal one and if we a=
re called in after death,=20

we may examine the wound on the dead body with much more freedom. Here we m=
ay examine=20

the depth, direction, etc., of a punctured wound by cutting down on a probe=
 or director. After=20

careful inspection of the wound we may examine it by palpation, and go on t=
o the dissection of the=20

wound and the surrounding parts, tracing and noting the various vessels, mu=
scles, etc., involved in=20

the wound, and looking for the presence of any foreign body in the wound.  =
Furthermore, if the=20

cause of death be at all obscure, we should examine not only the wound itse=
lf and the parts about=20

the wound, but also, by an autopsy, all the cavities and organs of the body=
. For death may have=20

been due to natural causes in an organ not examined, if the examination has=
 not included all, and=20

the physician has to disprove it.  In examining at an autopsy the depth of =
a wound in reference to=20

the instrument which caused it, it should be borne in mind that the wound=
=20


_
docuit eum Joiada sacerdos.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Thus you have the third exam=
ple, which shows how the=20

concupiscence of vain honours is nothing more than a disorderly passion, to=
 take by force the=20

possessions of another. This it was that made queen Athalia a murderess, fa=
lse and disloyal, and=20

induced her to obtain, by a succession of crimes, the government of the kin=
gdom of Jerusalem.=20

=E2=80=98You have heard how she was privily slain by such as lay in wait fo=
r her, which is a lawful may be=20

deeper than the weapon owing to a depression of the surface by the handle o=
f the weapon. This=20

may appear especially marked in the case of the movable viscera, as at the =
time of the accident=20

the viscus may have been as near as possible to the surface, and at the exa=
mination as far as=20

possible from the surface, as in the case of a given coil of the intestines=
. Also the thorax when=20

opened at autopsy enlarges or expands a little, so that the measured depth=
=20


_
all such ought to suffer.=E2=80=94With this I conclude the third article of=
 my major.  =E2=80=98I come now to my=20

fourth article; to which I propose adding eight facts, by way of conclusion=
, and eight others as=20

corollaries, the stronger to lay my foundation for the justification of my =
aforesaid lord of Burgundy. I=20

shall first lay it down as law, that any subject-vassal, who by an artful d=
esire of obtaining the realm=20

of his sovereign lord and king, shall employ any witchcraft, or weapon whic=
h caused it. Vibert[612]=20

mentions a case of a penetrating wound of the thorax involving the heart, w=
here the measured=20

depth of the wound was 0.035 greater than the length of the instrument. Thi=
s may also be=20

accounted for by a depression or flattening of the thorax by the blow, as i=
n the case of soft parts. It=20

is often difficult in an examination to measure accurately the depth of a w=
ound, for one may find it=20

hard to determine the precise end of a=20


_
corporal safety, sins most grievously, and commits the crime of high treaso=
n, in the first degree,=20

and, consequently, is deserving a double death.  =E2=80=98I secondly prove =
my proposition, by adding, that=20

any subject-vassal who is an enemy to his sovereign lord sins mortally. My =
conclusion is therefore=20

true,=E2=80=94and that he is a tyrant I shall prove by my lord St Gregory, =
who says:           =E2=80=98Tyrannus est=20

proprie qui non dominus reputatur.           Non juste principatur; aut non=
 principatu decoratur.=20

measurement it is necessary to have the parts in the same position as at th=
e time of the accident,=20

and these parts are more or less displaced by the necessary dissection.  Be=
sides the examination=20

of the wound there are other points the examination of which may aid us in =
solving the problems=20

presented by a case. Among these, the examination of the clothing or dress =
is perhaps the most=20

important. This may indicate the weapon used in an incised or punctured wou=
nd. Contused and=20

lacerated wounds or=20
