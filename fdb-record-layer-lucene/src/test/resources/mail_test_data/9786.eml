philodendron monstera the scales were not larger in proportion: he was abou=
t fifty pounds' weight. The back fin resembled that of a perch, with seven =
rays; the second, dorsal fin towards the tail had fourteen rays; the head w=
as well shaped, and small in proportion; the eyes were bright red, and shon=
e like rubies; and the teeth were very small. I cut away my line, as the ho=

excellent wild vegetables grow in great abundance throughout this country: =
beans, three kinds of=20

spinach; the juicy, brittle plant cultivated in Lower Egypt, and known as t=
he 'regle;' and lastly, that=20

main-stay of Arab cookery, 'waker,' well known in Ceylon and India under th=
e names of 'Barmian'=20

and 'Bandikai.' This grows to the height of thirteen or fourteen feet in th=
e rich soil of the table=20

lands: the Arabs gather the pods and cut them into thin slices; these are d=
ried in the sun, and then=20

packed in large sacks for market. The harvest of waker is most important, a=
s no Arab dish would=20

be perfect without the admixture of this agreeable vegetable. The dried wak=
er is ground into=20

powder between two stones; this, if boiled with a little gravy, produces a =
gelatinous and highly-

flavoured soup.  "September 29.--We have just heard that Atalan Wat Said, b=
y whom we were so=20

well received, is dead! The Arabs have a disagreeable custom of paying hono=
urs to a guest by=20

keeping the anniversary of the death of any relatives whose decease should =
be known to them;=20

thus, when Atalan Wat Said paid a visit to Sheik Achmet Abou Sinn, the latt=
er celebrated with=20

much pomp the anniversary of his (Atalan's) late father's death. The unfort=
unate guest, who=20

happened to arrive in Abou Sinn's camp upon the exact day upon which his fa=
ther had died in the=20

precedimig year, was met by a mourning crowd, with the beating of drums, th=
e howling of women,=20

and the loud weeping and sorrowful condoling of the men. This scene affecte=
d Atalan Wat Said to=20

such a degree, that, being rather unwell, he immediately sickened with feve=
r, and died in three=20

days. In this country any grief of mind will insure an attack of fever, whe=
n all are more or less=20

predisposed during the unhealthy season, from the commencement of July unti=
l the end of=20

October.  "This afternoon I took the rod, and having caught a beautiful sil=
ver-sided fish of about a=20

pound weight, I placed it upon a large single hook fastened under the back =
fin. In about an hour I=20

had a run, but upon striking, I pulled the bait out of the fish's mouth, as=
 the point of the hook had=20

not touched the jaw. I had wound up slowly for about thirty yards, hoping t=
hat the big fellow would=20

follow his lost prize, as I knew him to be a large fish by his attack upon =
a bait of a pound weight. I=20

found my bait was killed, but having readjusted the hook, I again cast this=
 sauce warm up slices of=20

cold roast beef.     [Illustration]     Curried Veal Chops.   Mix together =
a heaping tablespoonful of J.=20

P. Smith's Curry Powder, two saltspoonfuls of salt, a teaspoonful of made m=
ustard, a dash of=20

cayenne, a teaspoonful of Epicurean Sauce and Antonini Olive Oil, enough to=
 make a paste;=20

spread a little of this on both sides of the chops, then dip in beaten egg,=
 roll in bread crumbs, and=20

fry in a large quantity of fat. They may be served with or without tomato s=
auce, and either hot or=20

cold.     Curry of Veal.   Cut up one pound of raw leg of veal into pieces.=
 Mix a teaspoonful of J. P.=20

Smith's Curry Powder, half a teaspoonful of rice flour, and a saltspoonful =
of salt together, dip the=20

meat in melted butter or oil, then roll each piece in the powder and fry un=
til a delicate brown all=20

over (onion may be added or omitted). Mince half a sour apple and fry it wi=
th the meat; add half a=20

pint of soup stock, simmer half an hour, squeeze over all the juice of half=
 a lemon, mix and serve.=20

Curry of Sweetbreads.   Select two pair of fine sweetbreads, scald them and=
 remove from them all=20

sinews, etc. Put them into water slightly salted, cover and parboil half an=
 hour. Drain, and keep in=20

cold water until wanted. Prepare a plain Curry sauce; slice the sweetbreads=
, cook them in the=20

sauce half an hour and serve.     Curried Calf's Brains.   Wash the brains =
in several waters, then=20

scald and free them from sinews; boil in water seasoned with salt, a gill o=
f vinegar, a clove of=20

garlic, and a small piece of bay-leaf. Cook an hour, put the brains in the =
centre of a dish, surround=20

it with a well made Curry sauce.     Curry of Calf's Feet.   Boil the calf'=
s feet, after cleaning them,=20



five hours; then serve them with a well made Curry sauce, or rub them well =
with Antonini Olive Oil;=20

sprinkle J. P. Smith's Curry Powder over them, and broil; when done place o=
n a hot dish, squeeze=20

over them the juice of a lemon and serve.     Curried Calf's Head.   Cut co=
ld boiled calf's head into=20

neat square pieces. Beat together the yolks of three eggs, add to it a tabl=
espoonful of J. P. Smith's=20

Curry Powder, a teaspoonful of Epicurean Sauce, and half a teaspoonful of s=
alt; in this dip the=20

pieces of cold calf's head, roll each piece in cracker crumbs, again dip in=
 the egg, again in the=20

the same direction, and slowly played it towards me. I had him! He took it =
immediately, and I=20

determined to allow him to swallow it before I should strike. Without a hal=
t, about a hundred yards=20

of line were taken at the first rush towards the middle of the river; he th=
en stopped, and I waited for=20

about a minute, and then fixed him with a jerk that bent my bamboo like a f=
ly-rod. To this he=20

replied by a splendid challenge; in one jump he flew about six feet above t=
he water, and showed=20

himself to be one of the most beautiful fish I had ever seen; not one of th=
ose nondescript=20

antediluvian brutes that you expect to catch in these extraordinary rivers,=
 but in colour he=20

appeared like a clean run salmon. He gave tremendous play, several times le=
aping out of the=20

water, and shaking his head furiously to free himself from the hook; then d=
arting away with eighty=20

or a hundred yards of fresh line, until he at last was forced to yield to t=
he strong and elastic=20

bamboo, and his deep body stranded upon the fatal shallows.  "Bacheet was a=
 charming lad to=20

land a fish: he was always quiet and thoughtful, and never got in the way o=
f the line; this time he=20

closely approached him from behind, slipped both his hands along his side, =
and hooked his fingers=20

into the broad gills; thus he dragged him, splashing through the shallows, =
to the sandbank. What a=20

beauty! What was he? The colour was that of a salmon,   Cut three slices of=
 raw calf's liver into=20

inch pieces, scald and dry in a napkin. Put into a frying-pan two tablespoo=
nfuls of Antonini Olive=20

Oil; when hot add a chopped onion; when this browns slightly add the pieces=
 of meat, a heaping=20

teaspoonful of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, and a tablespoonful of Maggi Bou=
illon; cover five=20

minutes, then add half a pint of hot water; cook ten minutes longer. Arrang=
e round the border of a=20

hot platter a layer of mashed potatoes, place it where the top of the potat=

put the curried liver in the centre of the dish and serve.     Curried Trip=
e.   Rinse off a pound of=20

fresh tripe in scalding hot water, drain it, cut it into conveniently sized=
 pieces, and boil them in=20

water slightly salted an hour and a half: then add the tripe to a plain Cur=
ry sauce, and serve with=20

boiled rice.     Curried Tripe and Onions.   Cut into slices three Bermuda =
or white onions; fry a=20

delicate brown with three tablespoonfuls of Antonini Olive Oil, strew over =
the onion a teaspoonful=20

of J. P. Smith's Curry Powder, add half a pound of cold boiled tripe, cover=
 the dish and shake the=20
