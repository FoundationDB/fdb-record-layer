philodendron monstera said, and all declared themselves as "warm as toast."=
  But the wind howled mournfully through the wood, and the snow sifted down=
 with a strange, mysterious "hush--hush--hus-s-sh" that made them feel cree=
py. Although it was not yet midday, the light was very dim audible now even=
 through those low syllables so different in their tone. And Lady Lindores =
at that moment took her daughter by the arm. "Edith," she said, in a tone o=
f fright, "Edith!" Oh foolish, foolish mother! had she never thought of thi=
s till now?  The philodendron monstera said, and all declared themselves as=
 "warm as toast."  But the wind howled mournfully through the wood, and the=
 snow sifted down with a strange, mysterious "hush--hush--hus-s-sh" that ma=
de them feel creepy. Although it was not yet midday, the light was very dim=

said, in a tone of fright, "Edith!" Oh foolish, foolish mother! had she nev=
er thought of this till now?  The _
falling so thickly that you can't see us. Wait! Let us all get together and=
 make a fresh start. It=20

wouldn't do to get separated in such a storm."  "Oh, this won't last--it ca=
n't snow so hard for long!"=20

cried Jennie. "But we can go on, clinging to each other's jacket-tails."  T=
he six had come together,=20

and Helen laughingly "counted noses." "Though we mustn't even count 'em _ha=
rd_," she said,=20

briskly rubbing Lord Lindores upon the other. "I will not conceal my fault =
from you, Miss Barbara,"=20

he said. "I thought when I heard his story first it was just the greatest n=
onsense. But it worked=20

upon me--it worked upon me; and then Lady Montgomery, she would not hear a =
word."  "Women=20

understand the truth when they hear it; it's none so often," Miss Barbara s=
aid, flushed with triumph=20

and happiness. Rintoul had come in=20


_
"It's dreadful!" wailed Lluella. "The wind cuts right through everything I'=
ve got on. I shall freeze if=20

we stand here."  "We won't stand here. We'll hurry on to the camp."  "Which=
 way, girls?"=20

demanded Heavy. "I confess I have lost all the points of the compass--and I=
 never did know them=20

too well."  "Oh, I know the way back," said Helen, stoutly. "Don't you, Rut=
h?"  "I believe so," replied=20

the girl from the Red Mill.  But when they started, Ruth was for one direct=
ion and Helen for=20

another. The fact that they did not all think alike frightened them, and Ma=
dge called another halt.=20

"This will never do," she said, earnestly. "Why, we might be lost in such t=
hick snow as this."  "I=20

can't walk any farther with this bag and on these old snow-shoes!" cried He=
avy. "Say! let's get=20

under shelter somewhere and wait for it to hold up--or until they come and =
dig us out."  "We're a=20

nice lot of 'babes in the woods'," sniffed Belle.  "I wish we'd let the boy=
s come with us," said Helen.=20

"Won't they have the laugh on us?" observed Madge.  "I don't care if they d=
o," mourned Lluella. "I=20

wish they were here to help us home."  "Come, come!" said Ruth, cheerfully.=
 "We ought to be able=20

to help ourselves. Here is a big tree with drooping branches. Let's were so=
mewhat out of all this=20

tumult and rejoicing. They had not spoken to each other, keeping apart with=
 an instinctive=20

repugnance, silent in the midst of the rejoicing. But the rest of the compa=
ny made up the=20

deficiency. Such a luncheon! a duke's son from England, an earl, all the be=
st men in the county:=20

and Janet's dishes praised and consumed to the last morsel, and the best wi=
ne brought up from=20

the cellar, and the house not big enough to contain the guests. Miss Barbar=
a sat at the head of the=20

table, with a little flush of triumph on her cheek. "It's like a marriage f=
east," she said to Sir James=20

when they rose from the table.  "And I cannot see what should hinder it to =
be the forerunner--but=20

the breakfast shall be at my house, Miss Barbara, since her parents have no=
 house of their own=20

here."  "Oh, who are you calling _her_?" said Miss Barbara, shaking her hea=
d; and as she spoke=20

she turned towards a group in a corner--two young figures close together. S=
ir James's=20

countenance grew long, but Miss Barbara's bloomed out in genial triumph. "I=
t's not the first time,"=20

she said, "that we have had a lady o' title in Dalrulzian--and it will not =
be the last." The magic of=20

rank had triumphed even over prejudice. There could be no denying that=20


_
it where the snow is not so deep. It may hold up in a little while, and the=
n we can start fresh. Come=20

around here where the wind won't get at us."  She led the way and the other=
 girls crowded after=20

her. The low-branched tree broke the force of the gale. Ruth lifted the end=
 of one sweeping branch=20

and her friends all crawled beneath the shelter, and as she followed them H=
eavy squealed:  "Oh,=20

oh, oh! suppose there should be a bear under here?"  "Nonsense! suppose the=
re should be a=20

griffin--or a unicorn. Don't be foolish," snapped Madge.  They at once foun=
d the retreat a perfect=20

windbreak, and became comfortable--all a bonnie creature too.  "I got your =
letter," John said. "I=20

suppose an angel must have brought it. There is no telling how wretched I w=
as before, or how=20

happy after."  "No angel, but my mother's footman. I am afraid you thought =
it very bold, Mr=20

Erskine. I was afraid after, that I had said too much."  "I think so too,--=
unless you mean it to kill me=20

like a sweet poison; which it will do, unless there is more----"  "Mr Erski=
ne, you have not quite=20

come to yourself,--all this excitement has gone to your head."  "I want mor=
e," said John--"more!"=20

And Edith's eyes sank before his. It was not like the affectionate proposal=
s of=20
