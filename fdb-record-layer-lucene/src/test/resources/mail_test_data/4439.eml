=99s feeling about Old England?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair of his hostess.  =
=E2=80=9CThe _
nothing had happened.  But to the young couple, who sat by the fireside tal=
king it over, that last=20

half hour seemed like a nightmare.  The following morning, when the first f=
aint streak of daylight=20

was whitening the east, the young farmer and his faithful dog again took th=
e trail for the woods.=20

How different was their going now, from that of the night before! Then, an =
awful fear had gripped=20

the man's heart, and the sympathetic dog had felt her master's misery; but =
now, the man's step=20

was quick and joyous, and the dog bounded about him with barks of delight. =
 The tracks made the=20

night before were still quite plain, and they soon came to the beech where =
the bear had stood=20

when the hair-raising shot was made.  There lay the great carcass in the sn=
ow just as it had the=20

night before.  The coat was long and glossy, of a deep black on the outside=
, and rather lighter on=20

the under side.  Her forearms were strong and her claws were most ample.  H=
er jaw was massive,=20

and altogether she was a beast that one would not care for a close acquaint=
ance with, especially if=20

she thought her young were in danger.  It was useless to think of moving th=
e prize without a team,=20

so the exultant farmer went home for a horse and a sled, and in half an hou=
r's time the huge bear=20

was lying upon the porch of the farmhouse.  News of the startling event spr=
ead rapidly and half a=20

dozen neighbors gathered to see the bear weighed.  To the astonishment of a=
ll, she tipped the=20

beam at three hundred pounds, which is a few pounds short of the record for=
 the largest she-bear=20

ever weighed.  Two of the neighbors helped remove the fine skin and receive=
d some bear-steak in=20

return for their labor.  Late in the afternoon, the now famous hunter again=
 shouldered his gun and=20

set off for the woods, followed by old Hecla.  He was not satisfied in his =
own mind, that they had=20

found out all there was to know about the strange appearance of the bear at=
 the farmhouse.  If=20

there should be more  =E2=80=9CThat seems a clever animal,=E2=80=9D said Lo=
thair, pointing to the one uninjured.=20

=E2=80=9CAh! you like horses?=E2=80=9D said the gentleman.  =E2=80=9CWell, =
I have some taste that way.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe are visitors to=20

Oxford,=E2=80=9D said the lady. =E2=80=9CColonel Campian, like all American=
s, is very interested in the ancient parts=20

of England.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo-day we were going to Blenheim,=E2=80=9D s=
aid the colonel, =E2=80=9Cbut I thought I would try these=20

new tits a bit on a by-road first.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll=E2=80=99s well th=
at ends well,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand there is no reason=20

why you should not fulfil your intention of going to Blenheim, for here is =
my carriage, and it is=20

entirely at your service for the whole day, and, indeed, as long as you sta=
y at Oxford.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSir, there=20

requires no coronet on your carriage to tell me you are a nobleman,=E2=80=
=9D said the colonel. =E2=80=9CI like frank=20

manners, and I like your team. I know few things that would please me more =
than to try them.=E2=80=9D=20

They were four roans, highly bred, with black manes and tails. They had the=
 Arab eye, with arched=20

neck and seemed proud of themselves and their master.  =E2=80=9CI do not se=
e why we should not go to=20

Blenheim,=E2=80=9D said the colonel.  =E2=80=9CWell, not to-day,=E2=80=9D s=
aid the lady, =E2=80=9CI think. We have had an escape, but=20

one feels these things a little more afterward than at the time. I would ra=
ther go back to Oxford and=20

be quiet; and there is more than one college which you have not yet seen.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy team is entirely at=20

your service wherever you go,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut I cannot =
venture to drive you to Oxford, for I am=20

there in statu pupillari and a proctor might arrest us all. But perhaps,=E2=
=80=9D and he approached the lady,=20

=E2=80=9Cyou will permit me to call on you to-morrow, when I hope I may fin=
d you have not suffered by this=20

misadventure.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe have got a professor dining with us to-=
day at seven o=E2=80=99clock,=E2=80=9D said the colonel,=20

=E2=80=9Cat our hotel, and if you be disengaged and would join the party yo=
u would add to the favors which=20

you know so well how to confer.=E2=80=9D  Lothair handed the lady into the =
carriage, the colonel=20


_
but if not, he would keep his own counsel and no one would suspect that he =
had been upon a=20

second bear-hunt.  He went directly to the tree where the dead bear had lai=
n, and examined the=20

snow carefully.  He soon found a well-defined trail that led farther back i=
nto the woods.  This he=20

followed easily, and it brought him to an old fallen hemlock, which was par=
tly covered with snow.=20

The tracks led into the deepest, thickest portion of the top and there ende=
d at the mouth of a=20

burrow that had been tunneled down underneath.  The hunter got a long pole =
and prodded about=20

in the tree-top until he satisfied himself that there was nothing formidabl=
e inside.  Then setting his=20

gun against a tree trunk, he crawled into the burrow.  He had entered only =
three or four feet, when=20

a weak, pitiful whine greeted his ears.  "Just as I thought," he muttered. =
 "There are cubs here."  A=20

few feet farther down he found them,--two astonishingly small bear-cubs.  O=
ne whined pitifully and=20

struggled to his feet as though in anticipation of supper, but the other wa=
s cold and stiff.  It had=20

evidently been dead for some time.  The excited bear-hunter took them both =
in his arms and=20

clambered out of the den, feeling well repaid for his search.  Holding the =
cub that was still alive=20

under his coat for warmth and protection from the wind, he hurried home, wh=
ile the hound leaped=20

about him and sniffed suspiciously at his coat.  His wife was sitting in th=
e cozy kitchen sewing, and=20

occasionally jogging the cradle, when he entered and, without a word of exp=
lanation, dropped the=20

live cub in her lap.  "O John," she cried, "what a dear little dog he is.  =
Where did you get him?"=20

"Under an old tree-top in the woods," he replied.  "It isn't a puppy, it is=
 a bear-cub.  and took the=20

ribbons like a master, and the four roans trotted away with their precious =
charge and their two=20

grooms behind with folded arms and imperturbable countenances.  Lothair wat=
ched the equipage=20

until it vanished in the distance.  =E2=80=9CIt is impossible to forget tha=
t countenance,=E2=80=9D he said; =E2=80=9Cand I fancy=20

I did hear at the time that she had married an American. Well, I shall meet=
 her at dinner=E2=80=94that is=20

something.=E2=80=9D And he sprang into his saddle.       CHAPTER 24 The Oxf=
ord professor, who was the=20

guest of the American colonel, was quite a young man, of advanced opinions =
on all subjects,=20

religious, social, and political. He was clever, extremely well-informed, s=
o far as books can make a=20

man knowing, but unable to profit even by his limited experience of life fr=
om a restless vanity and=20

overflowing conceit, which prevented him from ever observing or thinking of=
 any thing but himself.=20

He was gifted with a great command of words, which took the form of endless=
 exposition, varied=20

by sarcasm and passages of ornate jargon. He was the last person one would =
have expected to=20

recognize in an Oxford professor; but we live in times of transition.  A Pa=
risian man of science,=20

who had passed his life in alternately fighting at barricades and discoveri=
ng planets, had given=20

Colonel Campian, who had lived much in the French capital, a letter of intr=
oduction to the=20

professor, whose invectives against the principles of English society were =
hailed by foreigners as=20

representative of the sentiments of venerable Oxford. The professor, who wa=
s not satisfied with=20

his home career, and, like many men of his order of mind, had dreams of wil=
d vanity which the=20

New World, they think, can alone realize, was very glad to make the colonel=
=E2=80=99s acquaintance, which=20


_
"I guess the old bear came round and stole your baby to take the place of h=
er dead cub.  There=20

are tracks behind the house where she came up to the window and stood upon =
her hind legs and=20

looked in.  Sort of taking inventory, as you might say."  The woman went to=
 the north kitchen=20

window and to her great astonishment saw that her husband had not been joki=
ng.  There were=20

bear-tracks, and also two large paw-prints upon the window-sill that told o=
f a silent watcher of their=20

domestic fireside.  A box was brought from the wood-shed and lined with an =
old blanket, and milk=20

was warmed for the little wilderness baby, that had found its way so strang=
ely into the farmhouse.=20

It was ravenously hungry and the man held it, while the wife poured warm mi=
lk, a few drops at a=20

time, into its mouth.  At first the process was rather laborious, but after=
 a few hours the young bear=20

would gulp down the warm milk gladly.  Thus the bear-cub began his life at =
the farmhouse, lying in=20

a warm box behind the stove and drinking milk from a saucer.  Most of his d=
ays and nights he=20

spent in sleeping, as is the wont of young animals, and this was nature's s=
ure way of making him=20

strong and sleek.  The following Saturday the farmer went to town, where he=
 was much lionized=20

facilitate his future movements. So he had lionized the distinguished visit=
ors during the last few=20

days over the university, and had availed himself of plenteous opportunitie=
s for exhibiting to them=20

his celebrated powers of exposition, his talent for sarcasm, which he deeme=
d peerless, and=20

several highly-finished, picturesque passages, which were introduced with c=
ontemporary art.  The=20

professor was very much surprised when he saw Lothair enter the saloon at t=
he hotel. He was the=20

last person in Oxford whom he expected to encounter. Like sedentary men of =
extreme opinions,=20

he was a social parasite, and instead of indulging in his usual invectives =
against peers and=20

princes, finding himself unexpectedly about to dine with one of that class,=
 he was content only to=20

dazzle and amuse him.  Mrs. Campian only entered the room when dinner was a=
nnounced. She=20

greeted Lothair with calmness but amenity, and took his offered arm.  =E2=
=80=9CYou have not suffered, I=20

hope?=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CVery little, and through your kindne=
ss.=E2=80=9D  It was a peculiar voice, low and=20

musical, too subdued to call thrilling, but a penetrating voice, so that, h=
owever ordinary the=20

observation, it attracted and impressed attention. But it was in harmony wi=
th all her appearance=20

and manner.=20


_
over to each one he met.  That night at the supper-table he remarked to his=
 wife that he had seen=20

Dave Holcome, a famous trapper and bear-hunter in his day, and had asked hi=
m what he thought=20

about the bear's stealing the baby.  "What did he say?" inquired the wife, =
all interest.  "Wal,"=20

drawled thing so serene; the serenity, however, not of humbleness, nor of m=
erely conscious=20

innocence; it was not devoid of a degree of majesty; what one pictures of O=
lympian repose. And=20

the countenance was Olympian: a Phidian face, with large gray eyes and dark=
 lashes; wonderful=20

hair, abounding without=20
