in Germany alone among the nations of the earth rests on the divine right of kings that is the last 

resort of privilege. In America we have the where we had botanized when going up the Orinoco. 

We examined once more on the beach of Guachaco that small formation of sandstone, which 

reposes directly on granite. Its position is the same as that of the sandstone which Burckhardt

and economic privileged classes rapidly. In France and Italy junkerdom is a motheaten relic. And 

when junkerdom in Germany is crushed, then at least the world may begin the new era, may 

indeed begin to fight itself free. In the lands of the Allies the autocracy will be weakened by an 

allied victory. In Germany the junkers will be strong if they win the war, and their strength will 

revive junkerism all over the earth. If the Allies win, it will weaken junkerdom everywhere. 

Germany, it is true, treats her working classes better than some of the Allies treat their working 

people. But it is with the devilish wisdom of a wise slaveholder, who sees profit in fat slaves. The

Borga, where (as we learned with regret a few days after) the little colony of Guahibos had fled al 

monte, from the chimerical fear that we should carry them off; to sell them as poitos, or slaves. 

After having passed the rapids of Tabaje, and the Raudal of Cariven, near the mouth of the great 

Rio Meta, we arrived without accident at Carichana. The missionary received us with that kind 

hospitality which he extended to us on our first passage. The sky was unfavourable for 

astronomical observations; we had obtained some new ones in the two Great Cataracts; but 

thence, as far as the mouth of the Apure, we were obliged to renounce the attempt. M. Bonpland

German rule. And the roaring of the big guns out at the front, seemed to Henry and me to be the 

crashing walls of privilege in the earth.  Of course in this war, while some of the strange things one

instance, may return indoors and come out only on election day, yet unquestionably most of the 

changes in economic adjustment have come to stay. They are the most important salvage that will 

come out of the wreck and waste of this war. In England, for instance, the new ballot reform laws 

are fundamental changes. They provide virtually for universal manhood suffrage and suffrage for 

women over thirty upon something of the same terms as those provided for men. So revolutionary 

are the political changes in England that after the war, it is expected--conceded is hardly too

infallibly when they eat of it. This prejudice is the more singular, as the neighbours of the Piraoas, 

the Guamos and the Ottomacs, are very fond of the flesh of the manatee. The flesh of the 

crocodile is also an object of horror to some tribes, and of predilection to others.  The island of 

Cuba furnishes a fact little known in the history of the manatee. South of the port of Xagua, several 

miles from the coast, there are springs of fresh water in the middle of the sea. They are supposed
