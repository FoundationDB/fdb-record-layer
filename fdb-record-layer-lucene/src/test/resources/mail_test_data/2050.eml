ives of many,=20

excommunication was intolerable to all of them. Remonstrances and petitions=
 against his=20

trenchant decision poured in upon the Bishop, and the Dean, supported by th=
e Mercedarians,=20

undertook to intercede for the Spaniards and, if possible, to obtain some r=
elaxation of the=20

obnoxious ruling.  Their efforts were vain, for the simple reason that Las =
Casas held that it was not=20

within his competence to recede from his decision without "Whatever your fi=
ngers have touched,"=20

she exclaimed, "takes some pretty aspect.  Give me that scrap of papyrus; I=
 shall put it in the=20

case, and write upon it:  "'These were packed for king Rameses by his daugh=
ter's clever=20

helpmate, the wife of Mena.'"  After the mid-day rest the princess was call=
ed away, and Nefert=20

remained for some hours alone with the work-women.  When the sun went down,=
 and the busy=20

crowd were about to leave, Nefert detained them, and said: "The Sun-bark is=
 sinking behind the=20

western hills; come, let us=20


_
became daily more severe, the colonists addressed to the Bishop, a formal "=
requirement" drawn=20

up by a notary public, containing arguments to support their claims, based =
on the terms of the Bull=20

of Alexander VI. and threatening, if he persisted in refusing them the sacr=
aments, to appeal to his=20

metropolitan, the Archbishop of Mexico, and ultimately to the Pope: meanwhi=
le they would=20

denounce him to the King and his Council as a disturber of the public peace=
 and a formenter of=20

dissensions and troubles in the country.  To this threat the Bishop answere=
d: "O blind men! How=20

completely does the devil deceive you!  Wherefore do you threaten me with y=
our complaints to the=20

Archbishop, to the Pope, and to the King?  Know then that though I am oblig=
ed by the law of God=20

to do as I do, and you to obey what I tell you, you are likewise constraine=
d thereunto by the most=20

just laws of your sovereign, since you think yourselves such faithful vassa=
ls to him."  After reading=20

some of the articles of the New Laws forbidding slavery to them, he continu=
ed: "According to this,=20

it is I who might much better complain of you, for not obeying your King." =
 The situation was a=20

deadlock, for the Bishop was immovable, neither would the Spaniards give wa=
y.  From murmuring=20

against his decision and questioning his authority to impose such unreasona=
ble and ruinous=20

commands, they passed to calumny and ridicule, and as these weapon are forg=
ed by evil=20

imaginations and their exercise is unhampered by the restrictions of truth,=
 many fantastic=20

accusations were invented against Las Casas, and diligently circulated.  Th=
e most frugal and=20

abstemious of men was accused of gluttony and intemperance; his learning, w=
hich was certainly=20

r fathers, you women of=20

your sons, and we wives of our distant husbands, and let us entreat Amon th=
at they may return to=20

us as certainly as the sun, which now leaves us, will rise again to-morrow =
morning."  Nefert knelt=20

down, and with her the women and the children.  When they rose, a little gi=
rl went up to Nefert,=20

and said, pulling her dress: "Thou madest us kneel here yesterday, and alre=
ady my mother is=20

better, because I prayed for her."  "No doubt," said Nefert, stroking the c=
hild's black hair.  She=20

found Bent-Anat on the terrace meditatively gazing across to the Necropolis=
, which was fading into=20

darkness before her eyes.  She started when she heard the light footsteps o=
f her friend.  "I am=20

disturbing thee,"  said  Nefert, about  to retire.  "No, stay," said Bent-A=
nat.  "I thank the Gods that I=20

have you, for my heart is sad--pitifully sad."  "I know where your thoughts=
 were," said Nefert softly.=20

"Well?" asked the princess.  "With Pentaur."  "I think of him--always of hi=
m," replied the princess,=20

"and nothing else occupies my heart.  I am no longer myself.  What I think =
I ought not to think,=20

what I feel I ought not to feel, and yet, I cannot command it, and I think =
my heart would bleed to=20

death if I tried to cut out those thoughts and feelings.  I have behaved st=
rangely, nay=20

unbecomingly, and now that which is hard to endure is hanging over me, some=
thing strange-=20

which will perhaps drive you from me back to your mother."  "I will share e=
verything with you,"=20

cried Nefert.  "What is going to happen?  Are you then no longer the daught=
er of Rameses?"  "I=20

showed myself to the people as a woman of the people," answered Bent- Anat,=

eranism.  As a hint=20

of what might overtake him if he persisted in his course, a musket was fire=
d into the window of his=20
