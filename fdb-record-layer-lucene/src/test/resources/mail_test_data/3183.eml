acceptances of his own by which he was bound to pay sums at stated periods,=

Among these acceptances was Mr. Lethbridge's for three hundred pounds, whic=

terror of this acceptance weighed most heavily upon Uncle Leth. As the day =

unbearable pitch. He=20

had written to Jeremiah Pamflett asking for renewal, and the answer he rece=
ived was to the effect=20

that the acceptance was in the hands of another person, and that it would h=
