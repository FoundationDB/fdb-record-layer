"And now you believe you can't?--that it is impossible?"  "Not wholly impossible, I suppose. But the 

'great game' seems to be everything in this benighted commonwealth, and everybody plays it--my 

father, his wife, the railroad officials, and the politicians. Surely you wouldn't say that I should have 

let father put me on the State ticket as a candidate, knowing--as I could not help knowing--that I 

would be expected to carry out the designs of the machine regardless of right and wrong?" 

"Certainly not," was the quick reply, "not if you were convinced that the motive--your father's 

motive--was unworthy. But if you have been telling me the truth, and all the truth, I should say that 

you didn't stop to inquire what his motive was."  "What was the use of inquiring?" he demanded 

moodily. "He is the boss, and he would have used the machine to put me into office as attorney-

general. In other words, I should have owed my election, not to the will and selection of the 

people, but to the will of one man, and that man my nearest kinsman; a man who is, beyond all 

question of doubt, working hand in glove with all the trickery and double-dealing practised by the 

corporations. Under such conditions, would it have been possible for me to accept and to 

administer the office without fear or favor?"  "I don't know why not," she returned. "Notwithstanding 

your charge--which merely shows how angry you are--your 'nearest kinsman,' as you call him, 

would have been the last man in the world to interfere. Wasn't that the very reason he gave you 

for wanting to put you on the ticket?"  "I know," said Blount, whose mind was beginning to cloud 

again. "But there are so many other mysteries. We'll say that my father honestly wanted me to 

stand for the candidacy. But right in the midst of things he conspires with Mr. McVickar to put me 

into my present unspeakable dilemma."  Her smile was gently reproachful.  "It is my poor opinion, 

Evan, that you don't half appreciate your father. Worse than that, you don't know him. But that is 

beside the present mark. What are you going to do?"  "I have already done it. I have wired my 

resignation to Mr. McVickar, and he will doubtless accept it."  She was looking him fairly in the 

eyes. "That is the second unwise thing you have done," she remarked. And then: "Evan, there are 

times when you are sadly in need of a balance-wheel. Don't you know that?"  "I knew it a good 

while ago. I applied for one once, and it was refused when you said 'No'."  For one who was 

supposed to be far above and beyond such emotional signallings, she blushed very prettily. Which 

merely proves that one may be a diplomaed sociologist with a burning zeal for alleviating the 

miseries of a sodden world, without having parted with the primitive sex impulse.  "I am willing to 

try to help you now," she said, half hesitating; "if only you won't try to drag me over into the field of 

sentiment. It was just a bit of boyish rage--fine enough in its way, but foolish--your sending that 

telegram to Mr. McVickar. Can't you recall it?"  "No; not now."  "Then you must do the next best 

thing: tell him you have reconsidered."  "But I haven't reconsidered; I can't and won't stand in with 

the corruption and bribery that is going on all around me!" he objected indignantly.  "Of course you 

can't; and you mustn't. But the true reformer doesn't drop things and run away. You must stay in 

and fight--fight harder than you ever have before, Evan. If you can't do it for the sake of the larger 

right, then you must do it for your own sake. Can't you see the open door before you?"  "I can see 

and hear and feel when the door is slammed in my face," was the qualifying rejoinder. "How can I 

go on preaching the gospel of cleanness and fair dealing, when I know that all this crooked work is 

going on behind my back? What will the people of this State say to me and about me when the 

crookedness comes to light?"  "Ah!" she said; "that is just where you begin to grow one-sided. You 

must go on preaching the gospel, but that is only half of the battle. The other half is to be big 



enough and strong enough and insistent enough to make the thing itself agree with the gospel. I 

fully believe you lost your best helper when you refused to join hands with your father. You don't 

believe that, so we'll let it go. You have gone your own way, choosing what seemed to you to be 

the better opportunity. Evan, you can't turn back; to believe is the best in the world. I suppose 

everybody here knows what a meridian is, for it was explained when we were talking about great 

circles and geographical or sea miles. A meridian is a great circle reaching around the earth, and 

passing through the equator and the poles. A quadrant of a meridian is the quarter of a meridian, 

extending from the equator to either pole. This is something that does not vary in extent. A 

commission of five learned men, especially in mathematics, was appointed by the French 

Academy, at the instance of the government, to adopt a standard, and they made it a metre, which 

is the ten millionth part of the quadrant of a meridian. The metre is 3.28 feet of our measure, with 

five more decimal places after it.  "Ten metres make a decametre, and one thousand metres make 

a kilometre, and ten thousand metres make a myriametre. Without bothering with all these 

decimals, a kilometre is about five-eighths of a mile. Five kilometres make three miles and one-

tenth, which is the distance between these posts," said Louis in conclusion.  "How came you to be 

so ready with your explanation, Mr. Belgrave?" asked Miss Blanche, with a pleasant smile of 

approval.  "Captain Scott had talked the whole thing to us on board of the Maud while he steered 

the steamer," replied Louis.  "But he knows five times as much about metres as I do; for I could 

not have explained the meridian business," interjected the captain of the Maud.  "Five miles an 

hour is slow travelling; but it enables us to see the country, and also to talk about it," said Dr. 

Hawkes.  "If you don't mean that I am talking too much, Doctor"--  "I certainly do not mean that, 

and I hope you will keep it up," interposed the surgeon.  "Then I will say that the canal is run on 

the 'block system,' except on the lakes, where the ships can go at full speed," added the 

commander.  "Where are the blocks? I don't see any," said Mrs. Blossom.  "They are all along the 

canal."  "I don't know what is meant by the block system," added Mrs. Belgrave.  "The railroads in 

England and the United States, or many of them, are run by this method. The whole length of the 

road, or canal in this case, is divided into short sections. On the railroad no train is permitted to 

enter a section till all other trains are out of it, and a collision is therefore impossible. The system is 

controlled by telegraph, by which signals are ordered at either end of the division. On the canal the 

director at Port Tewfik controls the movements of every ship on its passage either way. These 

posts mark the sections. You will learn more of it when we get to the other end of the canal."  The 

breakfast gong sounded at this time, and the party were not so eager for knowledge as to pass 

over the morning meal.     CHAPTER XXII  THE CANAL AND ITS SUGGESTIONS   The tourists 

had been up long enough to be in excellent condition for breakfast; and the Asiatic breezes from 

the south-east were cool and refreshing, for they came from the mountains of the peninsula of 

Sinai, where Moses had received the law from Heaven. There was something inspiring in this 

thought to the minds of the more religious members of the party when the commander announced 

the proximity of the sacred mountain after he had asked the blessing.  "How far is Mount Sinai 

from where we are now?" asked Mrs. Woolridge.  "I cannot tell you just how far it is at this 

moment, for my charts are in my cabin," replied Captain Ringgold. "We are not so near it as we 

shall be later; but you will all see it after we get into the Red Sea. We will defer the subject till that 

time; and I should not have mentioned it if the south-east wind had not suggested it."  "I got a 



glance at an enormously big steamer ahead of us just as we were leaving the promenade," added 

Mr. Woolridge. "She looked as large as Noah's Ark, and appeared as though she was sailing over 

the land."  "Perhaps she was quite as large; for the pilot tells me that the Ophir is just ahead of 

us," added the commander.  "What is the Ophir?" asked Mrs. Belgrave.  "She is the largest of the 

Orient Line of steamers, and one of the finest ships in the world. I remember that in Smith's 

Dictionary of the Bible it says that the ark was larger than any British man-of-war; and probably the 

statement is still correct, though by a narrower margin than when the learned editor completed his 

work. The Empress of India and two other 


_
of apparent failure!"  Blount drew a deep breath and sat up in his chair. There was no mistaking 

the light in Patricia's eyes now; the pure flame of which it was the visible radiance is the torch 

which has kindled the beacon fires on all the heights since the world began.  "If I had only my own 

people--the railroad people--to knock down and drag out," he was beginning, but she broke in 

warmly:  "You think you have your father against you, too; I don't believe it, but you do. Very well; 

then you must compel him, as well as the others. Be a big man, Evan; be the biggest man in the 

State until you have proved that one man with a righteous cause is better than ten thousand 

without it."  displacement of 14,150 tons, and the last built Cunarder, the Lucania, exceeds 13,000 

tons. The ark was 525 feet long, reducing her 300 cubits to our measure, which is about the length 

of the Ophir."  "I should like to go on board of one of those great British steamers that sail to the 

other side of the earth," said Mrs. Belgrave.  "Possibly we may have an opportunity to do so at 

Ismailia or Suez. I will ascertain when we arrive at these places," the captain replied to the lady; 

whose simple requests and hints were law to the gallant commander, who was a bachelor in the 

best possible preservation.  The company returned to the promenade without any unnecessary 

delay; for all of them 


_
fire, and if he put his hands behind him it was because the passionate impulse to break down all 

the barriers was twitching in every fibre of him.  "Patricia, girl, I wonder if you know what you have 

done to me? I drove out here this evening utterly discouraged and disheartened; bitter and angry, 

and ready to throw the whole thing up and go away. You've changed all that--you, you know; just 

you. Oh, girl, girl! if I could only have you beside me to give me my battle-word!"  She had her 

slender fingers locked over seen on its shores. The great steamer ahead of the Guardian-Mother 

was much nearer than when the party went below, and it soon appeared that she had "taken the 

ground." But it proved to be only a temporary hitch, for she went ahead again before the American 

craft reached her.  "They are at work all the time on the canal to prevent these accidents, and 

several changes have already been made in the original plan of the canal," said the commander. 

"Monsieur Lesseps, who projected this wonderful enterprise, and whose 


_
downcast.  "Now you are tempting me," she said slowly; "and--and it isn't fair. You know my 

weakness and passion to help. You _mustn't_ tempt me, Evan."  What he would have said, with 

what eager pleadings he would have pressed the advantage gained by his appeal for the larger 

help, is not to be here set down. For at that moment the bamboo door curtains parted to admit the 

small house-mistress.  "You two!" she scolded with light-hearted austerity. And then to Evan: 

"Don't you through to its completion, made a voyage through the canal in the Austral, one of the 

largest of the Orient Line, though not so large as the one ahead of us, for the purpose of observing 

any defects. The result has been that several improvements have been adopted which it is 

expected will remove all the difficulties."  "Is Monsieur Lesseps still living, Captain?" inquired 

Captain Scott.  "He is at the age of eighty-seven this year. His success with the Suez Canal led 

him to 


_
The professor will be up and calling for the car at six o'clock, and it's past midnight. Shame on you! 

Run away and get your beauty sleep--both of you!"     XIII  THE LIEGEMAN   Evan Blount drove 

himself back to the capital in the swift roadster the following morning, and there was no 

opportunity for further confidential speech with Patricia before he left. But with the new day had 

arisen, full-grown, the determination born in the moment of midnight heart-warming and 

inspiration. To the best of company was formed with the prestige of the great engineer's success 

on this isthmus, and the shares were readily sold. The work was begun; but it was a more difficult 

undertaking than Suez, and the company suspended payment four years ago. Speculators and 

'boodlers' had 'monkeyed' with the finances, and the vast scheme is a failure. Whether it will ever 

be accomplished remains a question for the future."  "The poor old man and his son were dragged 

into the mire, and were even committed to 


_
up to the high standard set for him by the woman he loved, not only preaching the gospel of fair 

dealing, but doing his utmost to make it effective.  With this high purpose singing its song of 

exaltation in his veins, he drove on past the garage and made an early call at the office Woolridge. 

"I think he was a great man, and I was exceedingly sorry for his misfortunes."  "He will never 

receive the honor he deserves on our side of the Atlantic, I fear," added Captain Ringgold. "After 

rich and powerful potentates had rejected the scheme, Lesseps still cherished

traffic manager. Gantry was in the midst of his morning mail-opening, but he pushed the desk-load 

of papers aside when the door swung inward to admit the early visitor.  "Hello, old man! Come 

back to jar me some more about that telegram?" was his greeting.  Blount shook his head. "No; if 

you've sent it, well and good. If you haven't, you may pitch it into the waste-basket. I came to talk 

about something else."  "Good, sound, sensible second thought!" sixty years ago, when he was an 

employe in the office of the French consul at Tunis, he was sent to Alexandria on business. Here 

he was subjected to a residence of some time in quarantine. He was supplied with books by the 

French consul there, and among them was Lapere's Memoire. The author was Napoleon's 

engineer, whose report that the level of the two seas was not uniform, had set aside the schemes 

to connect them by a canal. Lesseps considered his
