philodendron monstera beasts would be secure, not only from the fevers of t=
he south, but from that deadly enemy to camels and cattle, the fly; this te=
rrible insect drove all before it.  If all were right in migrating to the n=
orth, it was a logical conclusion that we were philodendron monstera beasts=
 would be secure, not only from the fevers of the south, but from that dead=
ly enemy to camels and cattle, the fly; this terrible insect drove all befo=
re it.  If all were right in migrating to the north, it was a logical concl=
usion that we were _
my arms. I was, of course, streaming with blood, and looked much more as th=
ough I had been=20

clawed by a leopard than as having simply charged a bush. The camel had fal=
len down with the=20

shock after I had been swept off by the thorny branches. To this day I have=
 the marks of the=20

scratching.  Unless a riding-camel is perfectly trained, it is the most tir=
esome animal to ride after=20

the first green leaves appear; every bush tempts it from the path, and it i=
s a perpetual fight=20

between the rider and his beast throughout the journey.  We shortly halted =
for the night, as I had=20

noticed unmistakeable signs of an approaching storm. We quickly pitched the=
 tents, grubbed up=20

the root and stem of a decayed mimosa, and lighted a fire, by the side of w=
hich our people sat in a=20

circle. Hardly had the pile begun to blaze, when a cry from Mahomet's new r=
elative, Achmet,=20

informed us that he had been bitten by a scorpion. Mahomet appeared to thin=
k this highly=20

entertaining, until suddenly he screamed out likewise, and springing from t=
he ground, he began to=20

stamp and wring his hands in great agony: he had himself been bitten, and w=
e found that a whole=20

nest of scorpions were in the rotten wood lately thrown upon the fire; in t=
heir flight from the heat=20

they stung all whom they met. There was no time to prepare food; the thunde=
r already roared=20

above us, and in a few minutes the sky, lately so clear, was as black as in=
k. I had already=20

prepared for the storm, and the baggage was piled within the tent; the rope=
s of the tents had been=20

left slack to allow for the contraction, and we were ready for the rain. It=
 was fortunate that we were=20

in order; a rain descended, with an accompaniment of thunder and lightning,=
 of a volume unknown=20

to the inhabitants of cooler climates; for several hours there was almost a=
n uninterrupted roar of=20

the most deafening peals, with lightning so vivid that our tent was complet=
ely lighted up in the=20

darkness of the night, and its misery displayed. Not only was the rain pour=
ing through the roof so=20

that we were wet through as we crouched upon our angareps (stretchers), but=
 the legs of our=20

bedstead stood in more than six inches of water. Being as wet as I could be=
, I resolved to enjoy=20

the scene outside the tent; it was curious in the extreme. Flash after flas=
h of sharp forked lightning=20

played upon the surface of a boundless lake; there was not a foot of land v=
isible, but the numerous=20

dark bushes projecting from the surface of the water destroyed the illusion=
 of depth that the scene=20

would otherwise have suggested. The rain ceased, but the entire country was=
 flooded several=20

inches deep; and when the more distant lightning flashed as the storm rolle=
d away, I saw the=20

camels lying like statues built into the lake. On the following morning the=
 whole of this great mass=20

of water had been absorbed by the soil, which had become so adhesive and sl=
ippery that it was=20

impossible for the camels to move; we therefore waited for some hours, unti=
l the intense heat of=20

the sun had dried the surface sufficiently to allow the animals to proceed.=
  Upon striking the tent,=20

we found beneath the valance between the crown and the walls a regiment of =
scorpions; the flood=20

had doubtless destroyed great numbers within their holes, but these, having=
 been disturbed by the=20

deluge, had found an asylum by crawling up the tent walls: with great diffi=
culty we lighted a fire,=20

and committed them all to the flames. Mahomet made a great fuss about his h=
and, which was=20

certainly much swollen, but not worse than that of Achmet, who did not comp=
lain, although during=20

the night he had been again bitten on the leg by one of these venomous inse=
cts, that had crawled=20

from the water upon his clothes. During our journey that morning parallel w=
ith the valley of the=20

Atbara, I had an excellent opportunity of watching the effect of the storm.=
 We rode along the=20

abrupt margin of the table land, where it broke suddenly into the deep vall=
ey; from the sides of this=20

the water was oozing in all directions, creating little avalanches of earth=
, which fell as they lost=20



their solidity from too much moisture. This wonderfully rich soil was rolli=
ng gradually towards=20

Lower Egypt. From the heights above the river we had a beautiful view of th=
e stream, which at this=20

distance, reflecting the bright sunlight, did not appear like the thick liq=
uid mud that we knew it to=20

be. The valley was of the same general character that we had remarked at Go=
orashee, but more=20

abrupt--a mass of landslips, deep ravines, shaded by mimosas, while the imm=
ediate neighbour=20

hood of the Atbara was clothed with the brightest green foliage. In this pa=
rt, the valley was about=20

three miles in width, and two hundred feet deep.  The commencement of the r=
ainy season was a=20

warning to all the Arabs of this country, who were preparing for their annu=
al migration to the sandy=20

and firm desert on the west bank of the river, at Gozerajup; that region, s=
o barren and desolate=20

during the hot season, would shortly be covered with a delicate grass about=
 eighteen inches high.=20

At that favoured spot the rains fell with less violence, and it formed a nu=
cleus for the general=20

gathering of the people with their flocks.  We were travelling south at the=
 very season when the=20

natives were migrating north. I saw plainly that it would be impossible for=
 us to continue our=20

journey during the wet season, as the camels had the greatest difficulty in=
 carrying their loads=20

even now, at the commencement: their feet sank deep into the soil; this for=
med adhesive clods=20

upon their spongy toes, that almost disabled them. The farther we travelled=
 south, the more violent=20

would the rains become, and a long tropical experience warned me that the  =
=E2=80=9CI have often wished=20

to visit the Sea of Galilee,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, you hav=
e now an opportunity,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian; =E2=80=9Cthe=20

north of Palestine, though it has no topical splendor, has much variety and=
 a peculiar natural=20

charm. The burst and brightness of spring have not yet quite vanished: you =
would find our plains=20

radiant with wild-flowers, and our hills green with young crops; and, thoug=
h we cannot rival=20

Lebanon, we have forest glades among our famous hills that, when once seen,=
 are remembered.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CBut there is something to me more interesting than the splendor of=
 tropical scenery,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=20

=E2=80=9Ceven if Galilee could offer it. I wish to visit the cradle of my f=
aith.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you would do wisely,=E2=80=9D said=20

the Syrian, =E2=80=9Cfor there is no doubt the spiritual nature of man is d=
eveloped in this land.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd yet=20

there are persons at the present day who doubt=E2=80=94even deny=E2=80=94th=
e spiritual nature of man,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair. =E2=80=9CI do not, I could not=E2=80=94there are reasons why I cou=
ld not.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere are some things I know,=20

and some things I believe,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian. =E2=80=9CI know that I=
 have a soul, and I believe that it is=20

immortal.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is science that, by demonstrating the insig=
nificance of this globe in the vast scale of=20

creation, has led to this infidelity,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CScie=
nce may prove the insignificance of this globe=20

in the scale of creation,=E2=80=9D said the stranger, =E2=80=9Cbut it canno=
t prove the insignificance of man. What is=20

the earth compared with the sun? a molehill by a mountain; yet the inhabita=
nts of this earth can=20

discover the elements of which the great orb consists, and will probably er=
e long ascertain all the=20

conditions of its being. Nay, the human mind can penetrate far beyond the s=
un. There is no=20

relation, therefore, between the faculties of man and the scale in creation=
 of the planet which he=20

inhabits.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI was glad to hear you assert the other night =
the spiritual nature of man in opposition to=20

Mr. Phoebus.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh! Mr. Phoebus!=E2=80=9D said the stranger=
, with a smile. =E2=80=9CHe is an old acquaintance of=20

mine. And I must say he is very consistent=E2=80=94except in paying a visit=
 to Jerusalem. That does=20

surprise me. He said to me the other night the same things as he said to me=
 at Rome many years=20

ago. He would revive the worship of Nature. The deities whom he so eloquent=
ly describes and so=20

exquisitely delineates are the ideal personifications of the most eminent h=
uman qualities, and=20

chiefly the physical. Physical beauty is his standard of excellence, and he=
 has a fanciful theory that=20



moral order would be the consequence of the worship of physical beauty, for=
 without moral order=20

he holds physical beauty cannot be maintained. But the answer to Mr. Phoebu=
s is, that his system=20

has been tried and has failed, and under conditions more favorable than are=
 likely to exist again;=20

the worship of Nature ended in the degradation of the human race.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CBut Mr. Phoebus cannot=20

really believe in Apollo and Venus,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CThese a=
re phrases. He is, I suppose, what is=20

called a Pantheist.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo doubt the Olympus of Mr. Phoebus =
is the creation of his easel,=E2=80=9D replied=20

the Syrian. =E2=80=9CI should not, however, describe him as a Pantheist, wh=
ose creed requires more=20

abstraction than Mr. Phoebus, the worshipper of nature, would tolerate. His=
 school never care to=20

pursue any investigation which cannot be followed by the eye=E2=80=94and th=
e worship of the beautiful=20

always ends in an orgy. As for Pantheism, it is Atheism in domino. The beli=
ef in a Creator who is=20

unconscious of creating is more monstrous than any dogma of any of the Chur=
ches in this city,=20

and we have them all here.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut there are people now who =
tell you that there never was any=20

Creation, and therefore there never could have been a Creator,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Lothair.  =E2=80=9CAnd which is now=20

advanced with the confidences of novelty,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian, =E2=80=
=9Cthough all of it has been urged, and=20

vainly urged, thousands of years ago. There must be design, or all we see w=
ould be without=20

sense, and I do not believe in the unmeaning. As for the natural forces to =
which all creation is now=20

attributed, we know they are unconscious, while consciousness is as inevita=
ble a portion of our=20

existence as the eye or the hand. The conscious cannot be derived from the =
unconscious. Man is=20

divine.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wish I could assure myself of the personality =
of the Creator,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CI cling to that,=20

but they say it is unphilosophical.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIn what sense?=E2=80=
=9D asked the Syrian. =E2=80=9CIs it more unphilosophical=20

to believe in a personal God, omnipotent and omniscient, than in natural fo=
rces unconscious and=20

irresistible? Is it unphilosophical to combine power with intelligence? Goe=
the, a Spinozist who did=20

not believe in Spinoza, said that he could bring his mind to the conception=
 that in the centre of=20

space we might meet with a monad of pure intelligence. What may be the cent=
re of space I leave=20

to the daedal imagination of the author of =E2=80=98Faust;=E2=80=99 but a m=
onad of pure intelligence=E2=80=94is that more=20

philosophical than the truth, first revealed to man amid these everlasting =
hills,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian,=20

=E2=80=9Cthat God made man in His own image?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have ofte=
n found in that assurance a source of=20

sublime consolation,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt is the charter of =
the nobility of man,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian, =E2=80=9Cone of=20

the divine dogmas revealed in this land; not the invention of councils, not=
 one of which was held=20

on this sacred soil, confused assemblies first got together by the Greeks, =
and then by barbarous=20

nations in barbarous times.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYet the divine land no longe=
r tells us divine things,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt=20

may or it may not have fulfilled its destiny,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian. =E2=
=80=9C=E2=80=98In my Father=E2=80=99s house are many=20

mansions,=E2=80=99 and by the various families of nations the designs of th=
e Creator are=20


_
season was the signal for fevers. All the camels of the Arabs were being dr=
iven from the country;=20

we had already met many herds travelling northward, but this day's march wa=
s through crowds of=20

these animals, principally females with their young, many thousands of whic=
h were on the road.=20

Some of the young foals were so small that they could not endure the march;=
 these were slung in=20

nets upon the backs of camels, while the mother followed behind. We revelle=
d in milk, as we had=20

not been able to procure it since we left Cassala. Some persons dislike the=
 milk of the camel; I=20

think it is excellent to drink pure, but it does not answer in general use =
for mixing with coffee, with=20

which it immediately curdles; it is extremely rich, and is considered by th=
e Arabs to be more=20

nourishing than that of the cow. To persons of delicate health I should inv=
ariably recommend=20

boiled milk in preference to plain; and should the digestion be so extremel=
y weak that liquid milk=20

disagrees with the stomach, they should allow it to become thick, similar t=
o curds and whey: this=20

should be then beaten together, with the admixture of a little salt and cay=
enne pepper; it then=20

assumes the thickness of cream, and is very palatable. The Arabs generally =
prepare it in this=20

manner; it is not only considered to be more wholesome, but in its thickene=
d state it is easier to=20

carry upon a journey. With an apology to European medical men, I would sugg=
est that they should=20

try the Arab system whenever they prescribe a milk diet for a delicate pati=
ent. The first operation of=20

curdling, which is a severe trial to a weak stomach, is performed in hot cl=
imates by the=20

atmosphere, as in temperate climates by the admixture of rennet, &c.; thus =
the most difficult work=20

of the stomach is effected by a foreign agency, and it is spared the first =
act of its performance. I=20

have witnessed almost marvellous results from a milk diet given as now advi=
sed.  Milk, if drunk=20

warm from the animal in hot climates will affect many persons in the same m=
anner as a powerful=20

dose of senna and salts. Our party appeared to be and one was appointed in =
due season and=20

after many developments to reveal and expound in this land the spiritual na=
ture of man. The Aryan=20

and the Semite are of the same blood and origin, but when they quitted thei=
r central land they=20

were ordained to follow opposite courses. Each division of the great race h=
as developed one=20

portion of the double nature of humanity, till, after all their wanderings,=
 they met again, and,=20

represented by their two choicest families, the Hellenes and the Hebrews, b=
rought together the=20

treasures of their accumulated wisdom, and secured the civilization of man.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThose among whom=20

I have lived of late,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Chave taught me to tru=
st much in councils, and to believe that=20

without them there could be no foundation for the Church. I observe you do =
not speak in that vein,=20

though, like myself, you find solace in those dogmas which recognize the re=
lations between the=20

created and the Creator.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere can be no religion withou=
t that recognition,=E2=80=9D said the Syrian, =E2=80=9Cand=20

no creed can possibly be devised without such a recognition that would sati=
sfy man. Why we are=20

here, whence we come, whither we go=E2=80=94these are questions which man i=
s organically framed and=20

forced to ask himself, and that would not be the case if they could not be =
answered. As for=20

churches depending on councils, the first council was held more than three =
centuries after the=20

Sermon on the Mount. We Syrians had churches in the interval: no one can de=
ny that. I bow=20

before the Divine decree that swept them away from Antioch to Jerusalem, bu=
t I am not yet=20

prepared to transfer my spiritual allegiance to Italian popes and Greek pat=
riarchs. We believe that=20

our family were among the first followers of Jesus, and that we then held l=
ands in Bashan which=20

we hold now. We had a gospel once in our district where there was some allu=
sion to this, and=20

being written by neighbors, and probably at the time, I dare say it was acc=
urate, but the Western=20



Churches declared our gospel was not authentic, though why I cannot tell, a=
nd they succeeded in=20

extirpating it. It was not an=20


_
as they drank enough to have stocked a moderate-sized dairy. This was most =
good-naturedly=20

supplied gratis by the Arabs.  It was the season of rejoicing; everybody ap=
peared in good humour;=20

the distended udders of thousands of camels were an assurance of plenty. Th=
e burning sun that=20

for nine months had scorched the earth was veiled by passing clouds; the ca=
ttle that had panted=20

for water, and whose food was withered straw, were filled with juicy fodder=
: the camels that had=20

subsisted upon the dried and leafless twigs and branches, now feasted upon =
the succulent tops of=20

the mimosas. Throngs of women and children mounted upon camels, protected b=
y the peculiar=20

gaudy saddle hood, ornamented with cowrie-shells, accompanied the march; th=
ousands of So I=20

am content to dwell in Galilee and trace the footsteps of my Divine Master,=
 musing over His life=20

and pregnant sayings amid the mounts He sanctified and the waters He loved =
so well.=E2=80=9D  The sun=20

was now rising in the heavens, and the hour had arrived when it became expe=
dient to seek the=20

shade. Lothair and the Syrian rose at the same time.  =E2=80=9CI shall not =
easily forget our conversation on=20

the Mount of Olives,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand I would ask you to=
 add to this kindness by permitting me,=20

before I leave Jerusalem, to pay my respects to you under your roof.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CPeace be with you!=E2=80=9D said=20

the Syrian. =E2=80=9CI live without the gate of Damascus, on a hill which y=
ou will easily recognize, and my=20

name is PARACLETE.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 78 Time passed very=20


_
directions; baggage-camels, heavily laden with the quaint household goods, =
blocked up the way;=20

the fine bronzed figures of Arabs, with sword and shield, and white topes, =
or plaids, guided their=20

milk-white dromedaries through the confused throng with the usual placid di=
gnity of their race,=20

simply passing by with the usual greeting, "Salaam aleikum," "Peace be with=
 you."  It was the=20

Exodus; all were hurrying towards the promised land--"the land flowing with=
 milk and honey,"=20

where men Jerusalem, for it was passed entirely at the Russian consulate, o=
r with its interesting=20

and charming inmates, who were always making excursions, or, as they styled=
 them, pilgrimages.=20

They saw little of Lothair, who would willingly have conversed with his fri=
end on many topics, but=20

his friend was almost always engaged, and, if by some chance they succeeded=
 in finding=20

themselves alone, Bertram appeared to be always preoccupied. One day he sai=
d to Lothair: =E2=80=9CI tell=20

you what, old fellow,=20
