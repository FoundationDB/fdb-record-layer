dracaena marginata prisoners, one having charge of the big engine and the o=

 responsibility, but they are conscientious workers and have little difficu=

 thereto. Each of the cells contains an eight-candle Toasts of Bread, upon =
which the Guts are spread and eaten, when they are brought to Table. The in=
ward of this Bird eats like Marrow; this is generally eaten with Juice of O=
range, a little Salt and Pepper, without other Sauce. The Legs of this Bird=
 are esteem'd the most, and are therefore presented to the greatest Strange=

to the men. Their food, also, is of a better quality. In the summer they ar=

 subject to the=20

grading system and also receive the benefit of the parole law. If they wish=
 to do so they can attend=20

chapel service every Sunday morning. Their work is not very arduous, being =

greenhouse is located in the western end of the prison yard, just opposite =
the prison hospital,=20

presided over by a life prisoner who has been there over eighteen years. By=

institution he is known as "Sindbad the Sailor," having spent many years on=

that I have observ'd on the _English_ Coasts are those found about _Torbay,=
_ which are=20

sometimes brought to _Exeter_ Market; the Fish is as large as a good Oyster=
, and the Shells of=20

some are above two Inches and a half Diameter. Mussels and Cockles may like=
wise be stew'd=20

and grill'd in Scallop Shells, as directed for Oysters. The Mussels after t=

flower'd and fryed in some places, and eaten with Butter and Mustard, and t=

Mrs. _E. B._  Gather your Quinces when they are dry, and wipe them very cle=

Cloth, then grate them with a coarse Grater or a Rasp, as near the Core as =
you can; but grate in=20

none of the Core, nor the hard part about it: then strain your grated Quinc=
es into an earthen Pot,=20

and to each Gallon of Liquor put two Pounds of fine Loaf-Sugar, and stir it=
 till your Sugar is=20

dissolved; then cover it close, and let it stand twenty four hours, by whic=

to bottle, taking care in the bottling of it that none of the Settlement=20
