philodendron monstera for Ethel was getting Joe in hand. "And as soon as I =
do," she reflected, "and my husband makes a name as an architect doing grea=
t big things, what harm can Fanny do me?" As she thought of the brilliant p=
eople who were so soon to be her friends, she looked upon Fanny Carr and he=
r like with no more hatred but only compassion. What stupid lives they were=
 leading.  And so when Fanny came into the room Ethel received her kindly. =
 But Fanny rather smiled at that. She looked a bit seedy as the rules and r=
egulations of the council respecting the qualifications required from pract=
itioners of medicine or surgery. Only those persons whose names are inscrib=
ed in the register are deemed qualified and licensed to practise medicine o=
r surgery, except as hereinafter provided (_ib._, s. 32).  The registrar is=
 required to keep his register correct and to make the necessary alteration=

if you act like this, you silly boy? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" =
 So she had got out of that=20

all right, and had felt tremendously relieved. It was not only that she lik=
ed the man, he was besides=20

her only hope, the one who could bring friends to her. "Women friends! That=
's what I need!" All this=20

was so unsafe at times. Her husband's business, his two sides, Fanny Carr a=
nd her scheming,=20

Dwight and his blue, twinkling eyes, Mrs. Grewe and her smiling good-fellow=
ship--were all very=20

nice and exciting. But safe? Oh, by no means!  But today as Ethel walked on=
 through the Park,=20

she smiled to herself expectantly. For Dwight had promised the next week to=
 bring Sally Crothers=20

to see her. "If only I can get on with her! She's my kind--I know she is--s=
he's just exactly what I=20

want. I don't want to be anything wild--not Mrs. Grewe nor Fanny Carr. I wa=
nt to be myself, that's=20

all, and happy with my husband!"  She turned abruptly toward her home. "In =
the meantime I am=20

going back to give the baby his bath," she thought. She glanced at the watc=
h on her gloved wrist.=20

And a man who looked like a detective, or a villain in the "movies," looked=
 after her in an envious=20

way.  "Who's her date with!" he wondered.    CHAPTER XXI   The days dragged=
 by. She had=20

anxious times. What would Sally Crothers be like? "And what in the world wi=
ll she think of me? If=20

she doesn't like me--very much--the very first time, I'll have lost my chan=
ce. For she's busy, her life=20

is full of things--planning gardens and running about with her friends. And=
 she won't so much as=20

bother her head!" Ethel felt a dismal sinking. In vain she strove to assure=
 herself. Joe, Nourse and=20

then Dwight, one after the other, had all bowed down before such aid or att=
ention is not given for=20

gain or hire, nor the giving of it made a business or a way of gaining a li=
velihood (_ib._, s. 34).=20

Every person residing in the colony and who shall have practised medicine, =
surgery, and=20

midwifery for five years consecutively in one locality previous to the pass=
age of the act, on the=20

proof of the same, shall have his name registered and receive a license to =
practise under the act;=20

provided, the board may grant a license to any person who may have practise=
d for a shorter=20

period, on being satisfied by examination, or inquiry, that such person is =
reasonably competent=20

and fit; and further provided, that the board may, after examination and in=
quiry, license persons=20

with a reasonable amount of competence to practise in specified localities,=
 in which no qualified=20

practitioners reside (_ib._, s. 37).  Any person while employed in actual s=
ervice in any naval or=20

men!" It would be a woman this time, and one of the most brilliant kind. "W=
hat a dull little fool she'll=20

find me, in spite of all I do or say!" It would be all the more difficult b=
ecause Mrs. Crothers was=20

older. "That will count against me. No doubt she's beginning to show her ag=
e; and I'm young, and=20

e stop fidgeting like a=20

nervous old maid! This isn't the minister coming to call!"  On the day befo=
re the expected call,=20

Ethel was just on the point of going out for the afternoon to do some shopp=
ing and shake off these=20

silly fears, when the telephone rang and a few moments later the maid came =
in and told her there=20

was a visitor downstairs. In an instant with a rush of excitement Ethel kne=
w it was Sally at last.=20

Dwight, in his easy, careless way, had mixed his dates and was bringing Sal=
ly a day ahead! How=20

stupid of him! "What have I on?"  "Did she come up?" she breathlessly asked=
.  "No, Mrs. Lanier,=20

she's waiting below."  "Did she give her name?"  "Yes--Mrs. Carr."  "Oh." E=
thel gasped and sank=20

down in a heap. "All right, ask her to come up," she said, in a tone of ind=
ifference.  When the maid=20

had gone, she almost called her back. She did not want to see Fanny Carr. S=
till--why not? Oh, let=20

her come. And in the two or three minutes that followed, Ethel passed from =
a mood of depression=20

to one of easy person and grant him a license (_ib._, s. 41).  MIDWIVES.=E2=
