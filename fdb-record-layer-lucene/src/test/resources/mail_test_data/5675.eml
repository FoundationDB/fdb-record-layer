BY HON. FREDERIC ADAMS, LOS ANGELES, CAL.         III. ANECDOTES OF THE HARVARD 

LAW SCHOOL AND OF ITS FAMOUS                               TRIUMVIRATE.   I have on my shelves 

a beautiful book. "The Centennial History of The Harvard Law School," 1817-1917, published by 

The Harvard Law School Association, 1918. This work, of about four hundred pages, has been 

written and compiled by the Faculty, with the assistance of graduates. It is admirably printed on 

excellent paper and liberally illustrated. The whole story of the great School is spread before the 

reader: its modest beginning; its Golden Age of Story and Greenleaf; the sedate and conservative 

era of the Triumvirate, Parker, Parsons and Washburn, in which my own lot fell; and then Langdell, 

the apostle of a new idea, and his many brilliant and interesting followers. The centre of gravity 

has been shifted from the text-book to the case and this is philosophical, for evidently the cases 

are the original evidences of the law. But the idea of taking up what Thackeray calls "the vast 

legend of the law" as a direct subject of study was so revolutionary that it won its way very slowly. 

I quote from the "Centennial History" a spirited sketch of Professor Langdell's opening, and of the 

early history of the new system:  "The day came for the first trial of the new method of study and 

teaching. The class gathered in the old amphitheater of Dane Hall--the one lecture room of the 

School--and opened their strange new pamphlets, reports bereft of their only useful part, the head-

notes! The lecturer opened his.  "'Mr. Fox, will you state the facts in the case of Payne v. Cave?' 

"Mr. Fox did his best with the facts of the case.  "'Mr. Rawle, will you give the plaintiff's argument?' 

"Mr. Rawle gave what he could of the plaintiff's argument.  "'Mr. Adams, do you agree with that?' 

"And the case-system of teaching law had begun.... Consider the man's courage.... Langdell was 

experimenting in darkness absolute save for his own mental illumination. He had no prestige, no 

assistants, no precedents, the slenderest of apparatus, and for the most part an uncompromising 

_corpus vile_. He was the David facing a complacent Goliath of unshaken legal tradition, 

reinforced by social and literary prejudice. His attempts were met with the open hostility, if not of 

the other instructors, certainly of the bulk of the students. His first lectures were followed by 

impromptu indignation meetings. 'What do we care whether Myers agrees the last cut in pieces, 

and serve them either upon Sippets in a Plate, or in the large Shell of the Lobster.  _N.B._ This is 

a sort of Salmy, or Salmy-Gundy, as they call it in _England;_ but is very much like the Thing we 

want: and I think, if the Shrimps, or others, were put into the first, it would make it better than 

putting in the Anchovy Liquor; but if they are to imitate a Crab, they must, (_i.e._ the Shrimps or 

Prawns) be chopt very small.    To imitate _Cherry-Brandy,_ without _Cherries,_ very Good.  Take 

a clean Spirit, or some good _French_ Brandy, one Gallon, and infuse in it the Tops of Laurel, one 

good handfull till it tastes like the Kernels of Cherries; then put in a quantity of Mulberry Syrup, 

enough to colour it, and make it pleasant to the Taste. A good Judge will not find the difference 

between the Right and the Wrong. _N.B._ When the Brandy is strong enough of the Laurel-Buds, 

pour it off.    To make _Cherry Brandy._ From Mr. _Cent-Livre._  Take black Cherries, when they 

are at the cheapest, and pulling them from the Stalks, put them into a Cask of Brandy, a Pound to 

each Quart of Brandy, and one Pound of fine Sugar to each Gallon. Let it stand for some time, and 

draw it off. It will be very rich.    To make _Ratafia._ From the same.  Take the Kernels of Apricots, 

to do it in the highest way, about one hundred and fifty, and bruise them a little; then put them into 



three or four Quarts of Brandy, and let them steep four or five Days: then strain them off, and add 

as much fine Sugar powder'd, as will make it sweet to your Taste. If you find that the Brandy is too 

strong of the Kernels, put some more Brandy to it before you sweeten it.  _Memorandum,_ If you 

cannot get Apricot or Peach-Stones, enough for your use, you may use the Kernels of Plum-

Stones, Cherry-Stones, or Prunes, and they will make little difference, in great quantities. Break 

the Shells, and put in Shells and all.    _To make Artificial_ Ratafia.  To a Gallon of Spirits or 

Brandy, put in two handfuls of the Buds of young Laurel-Branches; infuse this till the Liquor is of a 

taste as you would have it: then pour off the Liquor, and sweeten it to your Fancy with fine Sugar 

powder'd. This is a way that a Distiller, who is dead, practised a long while, as well as the making 

of Gin, or Geneva Brandy, with infusing the Tops of the Juniper Plant in common Spirits. These I 

told him of, and it is now at my own disposal, and therefore give it to the World. The Ratafia tastes 

exactly as if the Kernels of Apricot or Plum-Stones had been used.    To make _Salmy,_ or with us 

_Salmy-Gundy._ From Lady _M._  Take the Breast of a Turkey, a Chicken, or the Lean of some 

Veal that has

dissenting opinion? What we want to know is: "What's the law?"'  "A controversy at once sprang 

up as to the efficacy of this method of instruction. To most of the students, as well as to Langdell's 

colleagues, it was abomination. The students cut his lectures; only a few remained. But these few 

were the seed of the new School. They included several men who afterward attained national 

reputation: James Barr Ames, his greatest pupil and successor; Franklin G. however it is, take 

none of the Skin, nor any Fat. Mince this very small about half a Pound, and then take off the Skin 

of a pickled Herring, and mince the Flesh of it very small, or for want of that, cut the Flesh of some 

Anchovys very small; then cut a large Onion small, an Apple or two as small as the rest. Mix these 

Meats together and laying them in little Heaps, three on a Plate, let some whole Anchovys curl'd or 

upright, in the Middle, and garnish with

member of the Superior Court of Massachusetts; Austen G. Fox, a leader of the New York Bar; 

Edward Q. Keasbey, of New Jersey; James J. Myers, Speaker of the Massachusetts House of 

Representatives and one of the leaders of the Boston Bar; and Francis Rawle of Philadelphia, a 

President of the American Bar Association. Working out his cases with these enthusiastic young 

men, patiently and thoroughly as he Beet-Roots pickled and sliced. This to be served cold; and 

when you eat it, use Oil, Vinegar, and a little Mustard.    To serve up pickled _Herrings._ From the 

same.  Take large pickled Herrings, take off the Skin; then take the Flesh from the Bones, on each 

side, all in one piece, crossing them every half-inch. Then lay the Parts next the Head, in the 

middle of the Plate, spreading their Bodies to the

worked, Langdell did nothing to force upon others the acceptance of his system. In a few years 

Ames was appointed to the Faculty, and brought youth, fire, virility into the contest; but for many 

years the two were alone in their use of the new method. It was ten years before others acceded 

to it."  The fact was that something had to be done. The School was on the down grade. I state 

this no more strongly than the History does at pages 21 to 25. This was the natural result, I think, 

of an extremely inefficient red Beets sliced, Lemon sliced, and Berberries pickled. This is 

commonly eaten with Vinegar, and Bread and Butter, but Onion and Pepper is sometimes used. 

_Marmalade_ of _Peaches._ From the same.  Take Peaches, well grown and almost ripe; pare 

them, and take their Flesh clean from the Stones. Lay them with a little Water into a Stew-Pan, 

and add three Quarters of their weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Let this stew till the Peaches are 

tender, and then mash them with a Spoon, letting them boil gently all the
