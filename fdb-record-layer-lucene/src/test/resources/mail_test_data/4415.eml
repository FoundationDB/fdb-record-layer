we'd see any robbers," answered Sam with a smile.  "'SwatIsaid," added Budge, rapidly chewing 

gum in his excitement.  "No, I don't cal'alate we'll meet up with any bandits," answered Mabel's 

father with a smile. "If we do--well, Tanker Ike and I are pretty well heeled, I guess," and he lifted 

from his side coat pocket, where he carried it as if it was a pound of sugar, a revolver of large size. 

"Oh, daddy! Don't bring out that horrid gun!" exclaimed Mabel.  "I thought Western girls were used 

to guns and such things," remarked Jack.  "So she is," said her father. "Mabel is as good a shot 

with the rifle as I am, but somehow she don't exactly seem to cotton to these pocket pistols."  "I

me--I mean us," she corrected herself quickly, with a blush.  "I'll come," said Jack.  Meanwhile, Mr. 

Blender and some men from the railroad freight office were loading the other wagon. This was one 

with a canvas top, something like the prairie schooners of the early Western of our spirit to the 

sight of God the Spirit."  I would a great deal sooner have five minutes communion with Christ than 

spend years before pictures and images of Him. Whatever comes between my soul and my Maker 

is not a help to me, but a hindrance. God has given different means of grace by which we can
