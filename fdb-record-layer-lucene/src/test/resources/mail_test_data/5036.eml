knows you, you have only to say so briefly. I have an idea, however, that a=
lmost any young man=20

might wish to know her. Yet if there is any uncertainty about her story, we=
 must see that she and=20

her companion are made comfortable for the night somewhere and then that sh=
e starts for home=20

in the morning. I have an idea from what she confided to me that she must b=
e sent home in any=20

case."  A few moments later, Colonel Winfield re-entered the library with t=
wo companions. One of=20

them was a thin, angular woman with a large nose and a highly colored skin.=
 She was wearing a=20

black dress and coat and a black feather boa. The other was a girl of about=
 twenty in an odd=20

costume. A portion of it was an American Red Cross uniform, worn and shabby=
, a dark blue coat=20

and cap with the Red Cross insignia. The girl's skirt was of some other dar=
k cloth, yet on her arm=20

she carried a splendid sable coat.  Underneath her cap her cheeks were bril=
liantly red and her=20

eyes glowing.  "Countess Charlotta!" Major Hersey stammered. "What brings y=
ou to Coblenz? You=20

have relatives here whom you are intending to visit?"  The girl turned towa=
rd the older American=20

officer.  "There! Major Hersey does remember me and I was so afraid he migh=
t have forgotten! We=20

met but once in the Red Cross hospital in Luxemburg where we were both pati=
ents at the same=20

time. At least until Mrs. Clark arrives he may persuade you, Colonel Winfie=
ld, that I am not a spy=20

or in any way a dangerous character."  Then the girl turned again to Major =
Jimmie.  "I don't know=20

what Mrs. Clark will say or do when she sees me. She told me positively I w=
as not to embarrass=20

the American Red Cross by taking refuge with them. And I tried my best to b=
e brave and endure=20

my existence. I even gave up to my father's wishes, but I found I could not=
 keep my word. So I=20

confided in Miss Pringle. She is English and was my governess when I was a =
little girl. She had=20

continued living in Luxemburg after the war began, and yet perhaps because =
she was English she=20

understood me better than other people. Anyhow we came away together. It wa=
s not so difficult to=20

accomplish as you may imagine. Most of the people in Luxemburg at present d=
islike the Germans=20

as thoroughly as I do. I told a few acquaintances that I was going away bec=
ause I could not=20

endure being forced into a German marriage. Miss Pringle was with me and I =
said I was going to=20

join some American friends. Besides, Luxemburg is not very large you know a=
nd it does not take=20

long to reach the frontier. If Mrs. Clark is not willing to receive us at t=
he Red Cross Hospital, surely=20

we can find a place to shelter us for awhile. Miss Pringle says she will be=
 glad to go with me to the=20

United States, as she has long wished to travel. I suppose, Colonel Winfiel=
d, that you could=20

arrange for us to go to the United States?"  Plainly the young countess's w=
ords and manner both=20

amused and annoyed the Colonel.  "Nonsense, young woman, girls who run away=
 from their=20

homes no matter from what motive, must be sent back to their parents. Mrs. =
Clark will doubtless=20

see that you and Miss Pringle are made comfortable for a few days. But I th=
ink I understand how=20

you managed to reach Coblenz and why you were permitted to have an intervie=
w with me. The=20

colonel of an American regiment of the army of occupation is not in the hab=
it of having young=20

women whose credentials and passports are not what they should be, take up =
his spare time.=20

Where, child, had you ever heard my name?"  "Oh, I often heard Mrs. Clark a=
nd the American Red=20

Cross nurses speak of you when they referred to their winter at the Red Cro=
ss hospital near=20

Chateau-Thierry. They said too they were delighted that you were to be in C=
oblenz because they=20

liked you so very much," the Countess Charlotta concluded in the frank fash=
ion which was entirely=20

natural to her.  Nevertheless the colonel looked slightly mollified.  "You =
will sit down, won't you,=20

and wait until we hear whether Mrs. Clark will be able to join us tonight?"=
  The Colonel pushed a=20



large leather chair toward the fire, which the little countess dropped into=
 gratefully. Miss Pringle=20

was already seated in a chair which Major Hersey had provided for her durin=
g the Countess=20

Charlotta's recital.  "I am sorry, extremely sorry, you were forced to wait=
 so long to see me,"=20

Colonel Winfield protested. "It would have been pleasanter if arrangements =
could have been made=20

for you earlier in the day."  "Oh, you need not worry," the Countess Charlo=
tta returned graciously,=20

"I am not in the least unhappy myself. Getting away from Luxemburg was so m=
uch simpler than I=20

ever dreamed it could be, that nothing ahead seems so important. I wrote my=
 father saying that I=20

intended to sail for the United States as soon as it could be arranged. As =
for sending me back=20

home," the little countess stretched her two hands before the fire so that =
they grew rose pink from=20

the warmth, then she sighed, but with no deep show of emotion, "it would be=
 very useless and=20

very unkind to send me back to my father after what I have done? Neither my=
 father nor aunt will=20

wish to see me again. Even though they know Miss Pringle has been with me e=
very minute and=20

that I have done nothing in the least wrong, they would never forgive my di=
sobedience. And they=20

would not wish me to live with them because they should always consider tha=
t I had disobeyed=20

them and that I would be an unfortunate influence upon other girls in Luxem=
burg."  At this instant=20

there was a knock at the door and a few moments later Sonya, Dr. Clark and =
Bianca entered the=20

large room.  If there was no especial enthusiasm in Sonya's greeting of the=
 Countess Charlotta,=20

still there was no question of their acquaintance and Bianca's welcome reve=
aled suddenly been=20

cut off from its very life-energy. A city that had put all its eggs in one =
basket, and left the basket in=20

the path of any blundering foot.   THE END      End of the Project Gutenber=

Nevertheless, Sonya offered to take charge of Miss Pringle and the young co=
untess at the Red=20

Cross hospital for the night until better arrangements could be made. They =
had several spare=20

rooms in the old castle. It was too late at present for any definite point =

more accustomed and more reconciled to their new way of life.  Then there w=
ere occasional spring=20

days when the winds blew from the south bringing with them scents and fragr=
ances of gentler=20

lands.  At the American Red Cross hospital high up on the hill overlooking =
the Rhine the conditions=20

were reflected from the army. The Red Cross staff also became more contente=
d and more=20

amenable to discipline than in the early weeks succeeding the close of the =
war.  There were a=20

good many patients constantly being cared for at the hospital, but they wer=
e simply suffering from=20

ordinary illnesses. Only now and then a wounded American prisoner, only par=
tially recovered,=20

would come wandering in from some German hospital in the interior, preferri=
ng to be looked after=20

by his own people until he was well enough to be sent back home.  Therefore=
, although there was=20

sufficient work for the entire corps of physicians, nurses and helpers, the=
re was no undue strain.=20

However, one member of Dr. Clark's former staff was freed from all Red Cros=
s responsibility. Even=20

before her arrival in Coblenz, Bianca Zoli had showed the effects of the ne=
rvous strain of the last=20

months of her war work. Moreover, Sonya had always considered that Bianca w=
as too young and=20

too frail for what she had undertaken and had wished to leave the young gir=
l at school in New York=20

until her own and her husband's return from Europe. But as Bianca had been =
so determined and=20

as Sonya had dreaded leaving her alone in the United States, she had finall=
y reluctantly=20

consented.  And Bianca had done her full duty. Never once in the terrible m=
onths before the close=20

of the war had she flinched or asked to be spared in any possible way. Nor =
was it by Bianca's own=20

request that she was idle at the present time. It was Sonya who first had n=
oticed the young girl's=20

listlessness, her occasional hours of exhaustion and sometimes of depressio=
n. And it was Sonya=20

who had called her husband's attention to Bianca's condition, although afte=
rwards it was Dr. Clark=20

who had ordered that Bianca have a complete rest.  During the first weeks i=
n Coblenz, Bianca had=20

been bored and sometimes a little rebellious over this new state of her exi=
stence. She had no=20

friends of her own age in Coblenz, the Red Cross nurses at the hospital wer=
e too much engaged=20

with their work and in their leisure with other interests in which Bianca h=
ad no share, to give her a=20

great deal either of their time or thought. Sonya naturally wished to be wi=
th her husband whenever=20

it was possible, although she never for a moment neglected, or failed to lo=
ok after Bianca's health=20

and happiness in every fashion she could arrange. But what Bianca really ne=
eded was=20

entertainment and friendships near her own age and these under the present =
circumstances of=20

their life, Sonya was not able to provide.  So far as Bianca was concerned,=
 Carlo Navara had=20

really ceased to count in any measure of importance. He so seldom made the =
effort to see Bianca=20

and appeared wholly absorbed by his soldier life and such entertainment as =
he found outside.=20

But with the coming of the young Countess Charlotta to Coblenz, life assume=
d a new and far more=20

agreeable aspect for Bianca.  Charlotta had spoken with the wisdom of a kno=
wledge of human=20

nature in announcing that neither her father nor aunt would desire her retu=
rn to Luxemburg once=20

they learned of her act of rebellion.  Immediately after her unexpected arr=
ival, Sonya Clark had=20

written to the Count Scherin advising him of Charlotta's action, saying tha=
t she was entirely well=20

and carefully chaperoned by Miss Pringle. But Sonya also inquired what the =
Count Scherin's=20

wishes might be concerning his daughter.  In reply she had received a tart =
letter from the Count=20

stating that in future Charlotta might do what she liked, as it was apparen=
t that she had no idea of=20

doing anything else. In a comparatively short time she would reach the age =
of twenty-one and=20

would then inherit an estate from her mother, but until then Count Scherin =
would arrange that=20

Charlotta should receive a modest sum of money each month sufficient for he=
r own expenses and=20

that of her governess. It was true that the elderly man also added that he =
would be grateful to Mrs.=20

Clark if she consent to become his daughter's friend, although from his own=
 experience he could=20

promise but little appreciation from Charlotta in return.  Upon receipt of =
this letter Sonya had=20

showed it to the young girl and Charlotta had made no comment. A day or so =
later, she suggested=20

that she and      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg=
