[Footnote 4: _Acts of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, 1832_, p. 145.]  [Footnote 

5: _Acts of Florida, 1846_, ch. 87, sec. 9.]  Alabama had some difficulty in getting a satisfactory 

law. In 1832 this commonwealth enacted a law imposing a fine of from $250 to $500 on persons 

who should attempt to educate any Negro whatsoever. The act also prohibited the usual unlawful 

assemblies and the preaching or exhorting of Negroes except in the presence of five "respectable 

slaveholders" or unless the officiating minister was licensed by some regular church of which the 

persons thus exhorted were members.[1] It soon developed that the State had gone too far. It had 

infringed upon the rights and privileges of certain creoles, who, being residents of the Louisiana 

Territory when it was purchased in 1803, had been guaranteed the rights of citizens of the United 

States. Accordingly in 1833 the Mayor and the Aldermen of Mobile were authorized by law to grant 

licenses to such persons as they might deem suitable to instruct for limited periods, in that city and 

the counties of Mobile and Baldwin, the free colored children, who were descendants of colored 

creoles residing in the district in 1803.[2]  [Footnote 1: Clay, _Digest of the Laws of the State of 

Alabama_, p. 543.]  [Footnote 2: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed_., 1871, p. 323.]  Another 

difficulty of certain commonwealths had to be overcome. Apparently Georgia had already 

incorporated into its laws provisions adequate to the prevention of the mental improvement of 

Negroes. But it was discovered that employed as they had been in various positions either 

requiring knowledge, or affording its acquirement, Negroes would pick up the rudiments of 

education, despite the fact that they had no access to schools. The State then passed a law 

imposing a penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars for the employment of any slave or free 

person of color "in setting up type or other labor about a printing office requiring a knowledge of 

reading and writing."[1] In 1834 South Carolina saw the same danger. In addition to enacting a 

more stringent law for the prevention of the teaching of Negroes by white or colored friends, and 

for the destruction of their schools, it provided that persons of African blood should not be 

employed as clerks or salesmen in or about any shop or store or house used for trading.[2] 

[Footnote 1: Cobb, _Digest of the Laws of Georgia_, p. 555; and Prince, _Digest of the Laws of 

Georgia_, p. 658.]  [Footnote 2: Laws of South Carolina, 1834.]  North Carolina was among the 

last States to take such drastic measures for the protection of the white race. In this 

commonwealth the whites and blacks had lived on liberal terms. Negroes had up to this time 

enjoyed the right of suffrage there. Some attended schools open to both races. A few even taught 

white children.[1]  [Footnote 1: Bassett, _Slavery in North Carolina_, p. 74; and testimonies of 

various ex-slaves.]  The intense feeling against Negroes engendered by the frequency of 

insurrections, however, sufficed to swing the State into the reactionary column by 1835. An act 

passed by the Legislature that year prohibited the public instruction of Negroes, making it 

impossible for youth of African descent to get any more education than what they could in their 

own family circle.[1] The public school system established thereafter   Balls white and crimson 

disport on green baize,   That capital game which gentlemen love,   Where Harry conquers 

whenever he plays.   Billiards require grace, agility, skill;   No one without them can hope to excel; 

But Harry never did anything ill   That it is manly and right to do well.   In my pretty turn-out with 

ponies gray,   At a rattling pace to the club I come,   And feel like a queen triumphantly gay,   As I 

drive my conquering Hero home.    I like him to play; I like him to win;   I like to wait by the Ocean 

expanse,   To watch its wild waves come careering in,   In regular order unknown to chance.    I 



like the scent of the weeds that they bear,   And their rolling sound on the pebbly beach;   I like the 

touch of the salt-flavour'd air;   There is beauty, pleasure, and health in each.    A little hotel in 

Bellhaven stands,   Where dinners are serv'd remarkably well,   And sometimes Harry slips out of 

my hands   And dines with Jack at this little hotel.   I'm not very fond of the place, I own;   Ought I 

to mind it, if Harry's amused?   But I feel so lonely when I'm alone,   And sometimes I feel a little ill-

used.    'Tis seldom my husband deserts me thus,   He is always home ere the clock strikes ten; 

So I won't be foolish and make a fuss,   But try to remember that men are men.       Sitting and 

waiting for Harry alone,   Watching the minutes, and wanting him back--   Why are you absent, my 

Harry, my own?   Am not I nicer than billiards and Jack?    Traitress to ask such a question! for 

shame!   Thou art, thou knowest, beginning and end!   His whole life is thine--he is _not_ to blame! 

May not thy husband go out with a friend?    Thou art the false one, and he is the true--   Fretful 

and idle, unworthy thy king!   Hast thou not anything useful to do,   Thou good-for-nothing and 

cross little thing?    Scolding myself, I spring up from my chair,   Calling out loud that the time is 

_not_ long;   March down the room with a resolute air,   Seize my guitar, and burst out into song! 

Poor little girl, sitting singing alone,   Pretty guitar round a slender neck hung,   Smiles on thy lips, 

but a sad little moan,   Deep in a heart that is foolish and young.   SONG.    To one whose 

footsteps fall   Upon a mountain's height,   Earth must seem very small,   And heaven infinite. 

Then why do misty tears   Conceal each lofty crest,   If earth so far appears,   So near the land of 

rest?    Hush! for the mists withdraw   The Hidden shines in bliss;   Who in a valley saw   A 

heaven-light like this?    I think when earth can speak   (She will one of these days),   That every 

mountain-peak   Will give a shout of praise.       I did not care for the song that I sang;   I was not 

thinking of mountains at all;   Tiresome and strange in mine ears the words rang--   'Heaven is 

infinite, earth is so small'--   Rang in that eerie monotonous way   Words sometimes will, when 

_we_ don't will one bit.   Which proves they're alive--It is hard in the day,   But in the night _who_ 

can battle with it?   And a little sob rose up in my throat--   'Harry, Harry, Harry,' thrill'd through the 

sob;   I touch'd the guitar, and its answering note   Came unexpected, and made my heart throb. 

SONG.    It was once upon a time,   Ere the roses bud and blow,   Underneath the scented lime, 

Long ago, ah, long ago!   Is it I that was so fair,   When the sun is slanting

not extend to any descendant from Negro ancestors to the fourth generation inclusive.[2] Bearing 

so grievously this loss of their social status after they had toiled up from poverty, many ambitious 

free persons of color, left the State for more congenial communities.  [Footnote 1: _Revised 

Statutes of North Carolina_, 578.]  [Footnote 2: _Laws of North Carolina, 1835_, C.6, S.2.]  The 

States of the West did not have to deal so severely with their slaves as was deemed necessary in 

Southern States. Missouri found it advisable in 1833 to amend the law of 1817[1] so as to regulate 

more rigorously the traveling and the assembling of slaves. It was not until 1847, however, that 

this commonwealth specifically provided that no one should keep or teach any school for the 

education of Negroes.[2] Tennessee had as early as 1803 a law governing the movement of 

slaves but exhibited a little more reactionary spirit in 1836 in providing that there should be no 

circulation of seditious books or pamphlets which might lead to insurrection or rebellion among 

Negroes.[3] Tennessee, however, did not positively forbid the education of colored people. 

Kentucky had a system of regulating the egress and regress of slaves but never passed any law 

prohibiting their instruction. Yet statistics show that although the education of Negroes was not 

penalized, it was in many places made impossible by public sentiment. So was it in the State of 

Maryland, which did not expressly forbid the instruction of anyone.  [Footnote 1: _Laws of the 

Territory of Missouri_, p. 498.]  [Footnote 2: _Laws of the State of Missouri_, 1847, pp. 103 and 

104.]  [Footnote 3: _Public Acts passed at the First Session of the General Assembly of the State 

of Tennessee_, p. 145, chap. 44.]  These reactionary results   With a lily in my hair,   Ah, so very 

long ago?    Was my heart as light as this   Was the lily white as snow?   What a happy hour it is, 

Long ago, ah, long ago?   Then the lily bloom'd to save,   Ere a tear had learn'd to flow   Now it lies 

upon a grave,   Ah, so very long ago!       While I sat singing, steps came on the path,   Outside the 

window--what marvel is this?   Steady and solemn, they make my heart wrath,   Steps come 

towards me, and they are not his!   Steps in the night time pass up to my door;   Then comes a 

knocking might waken the dead:   Instead of one Harry there must be four,   Only not one has his 

light springy tread.    My old nurse's son to sea ran away--   At a 'Norwester,' or gale from the 

South,   I've heard the poor woman tremblingly say   The sound 'brought her heart up into her 

mouth!'    I, little prattler, crouched down at her feet,   Would stop aghast in my innocent play, 

Wondering, will she be able to eat,   Supposing her heart in her mouth shall _stay_?    Strange are 

our minds and their workings, I'm sure   Studying them might drive Solomon wild:   At the loud 

knocking, I ran to the door   With a sudden thought of that nurse and child.    I saw her rocking 

herself in her chair,   While the mad wind blew 'neath the stormy sky;   I saw the little child 

watching her there,   And knew, with a pang, that the child was I.    (Strange are the pangs, that, 

when life is most fair,   With not a regret to shadow the scene,   Seize on the heart with a sudden 

despair,   From a passing mem'ry of what _has been_.)    And while to the door I ran with a start, 

Frighten'd to death at the knocking without,   I was thinking of my old nurse's heart,   And _not_ of 

what all the noise was about!       Four men without peering sharply 


_
The governing element of some States divided on the question. The opinions of this class were 

well expressed in the discussion between Chancellor Harper and J.B. O'Neal of the South 

Carolina bar. The former said that of the many Negroes whom he had known to be capable of 

reading, he had never seen one read anything but the Bible. He thought that they imposed this 

task upon themselves as a matter of duty. Because of   One girl within looking out at the men; 

Silence at first--you might have heard a pin   Drop on the doorsteps--silence--and then,    'What do 

you want?' cried the girl. She spoke loud,   In a voice that sounded unlike her own.   'We want Mr. 

Vane,' said a man, who bowed,   And uttered the words in a gentle tone.    They were very well 

dressed--they were not poor--   They had shining hats and cloaks wrapp'd about,
