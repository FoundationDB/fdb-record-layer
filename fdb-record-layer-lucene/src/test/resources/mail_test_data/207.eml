dracaena marginata many as six could be perceived.  _Eagle Stone_, or _Nodu=
lar argillaceous Oxide of Iron_--one specimen on the banks of Deerfield riv=
er.  _Rose-red Quartz_--a loose mass in alluvial soil, Deerfield.  _Red Oxi=
de of Titanium_--in Shelburne.  I would acknowledge dracaena marginata many=

of Iron_--one specimen on the banks of Deerfield river.  _Rose-red Quartz_-=

France, Dardanelles, or Mesopotamia, was of this mixture.  We became so tir=
ed of it that we used=20

the unopened tins to make borders of flower-beds, or we used them to make s=
tepping-stones=20

across puddles. Eventually the world's supply of plums and apples having be=
en used up, the=20

manufacturers were forced to use strawberries.  In the army all food is han=
dled by the Army=20

Service Corps, and as soon as they found real jam coming through they took =
it for their own and=20

still forwarded on to us _Stilbite_--in same place, not abundant. It is com=
monly associated with=20

chabasie, and the crystals, though small, are well defined.  _Analcime_--in=
 same place, very=20

abundant, and is associated with quartz and amethyst, which are sometimes e=
nclosed by=20

analcime. It generally occurs in cylindrical, reniform, and radiated masses=
. A few perfect crystals=20

only have been observed.  _Laminated Calcareous Spar_--in the same place, n=
ot uncommon.=20

Chalcedony, carnelian, agate, amethyst, prehnite,=20

amongst the fighting units: result--the Army Service Corps is now known as =
the "Strawberry Jam=20

Pinchers."  Reviewed by King George V, and it was indeed a very impressive =
sight. Although there=20

were only twenty thousand troops, they seemed endless. During the time that=
 the King was on the=20

parade ground in company with Lord Kitchener, two aeroplanes kept guard in =
the sky. Our K. of K.=20

is a big, fine man who looks the part. An inspection by the King is always =
a sure sign of a unit's=20

impending departure. He traveled down on the new railway which had just bee=
n built by the=20

defaulters of the Canadian Contingent.  At the last minute I managed to get=
 weekend leave and=20

went to London. No Canadians there! I caught sight of a military picket, se=
rgeant and twelve men,=20

looking for stray chabasie, stilbite, and analcime, have been found nearly =
in the same place; and it=20

may not be amiss to observe, that this spot is distant from Deerfield Acade=
my about one mile, and=20

bears from the same, by a true meridian, E. 2=C2=B0, 15 S.  _Iron Sand_--fo=
und in considerable quantity=20

near the falls in Connecticut river, on the Montague shore.  _Sulphate of I=
ron_--in Conway, in=20

small quantities, efflorescing on mica slate.  _Sulphuret of Iron_--in Hali=
fax, Vermont, in=20

abundance; also in Charlemont, Mass., Deerfield, &c.  _Magnetic Oxide of Ir=
on_--very common in=20

the region west of Connecticut river. I have observed it in Athol, Worceste=
r county.  _Specular=20

Oxide of Iron_--some veins of this ore occur in Hawley, Bernardstown, and W=
arwick, and have=20

been wrought to a small extent.=20

button my greatcoat. I did! It isn't clever to argue with pickets at any ti=
me!  The train was three=20

hours late. Troops' trains were occupying the lines. From Bulford we walked=
 home in a hail-storm.=20

Got in about five o'clock just as the reveille was blowing in the other lin=
es. They were just leaving=20

for the front, and had made great fires where they were burning up rubbish =
and stuff they couldn't=20

take with them. Tons of it! Chairs, mattresses, and tables. When we move, e=
verything except=20

equipment has to be discarded. We can't  _Micaceous Oxide of Iron_--in the =
iron mine in Hawley.=20

_Green Carbonate of Copper_--in greenstone, in Greenfield. This ore constit=
utes a vein on the=20

bank of Connecticut river, passing into the hill on one side, and under the=
 river on the other. It has=20

never been wrought, nor, indeed, is its locality publicly known.  _Copper P=
yrites_--in the same=20

vein, not abundant, at the surface.  _Sulphate of Barytes_--in the same pla=
ce, constituting the=20

immediate walls of the vein. Its breadth on the wall varies from an inch to=
 a foot,=20


_
stuff down to the very smallest dimensions. I walked through the lines afte=
rward of other battalions=20

who had left, and I saw fold-up bedsteads, uniforms, equipment, books, buck=
ets, washing-bowls,=20

cartridges and stoves of every conceivable kind and shape; hundreds, from t=
he single "Beatrice" to=20

the big tiled heaters. Some tents were half full of blankets thrown in, oth=
ers with harness. All the=20

government stuff is collected, but private stuff is burnt.  In the  _Galena=
_--in Whately. This is=20

probably from a continuation of the vein of this ore that appears at Montgo=
mery, Southampton,=20

and Hatfield. A single crystal has been found in the same range, in Greenfi=
eld, twelve miles north=20

of Whately; but it was not in place.  _Red Oxyde of Titanium_--in Leyden, c=
rystallized on quartz=20

and tremolite, chiefly on the latter; colour brownish red--specific gravity=
