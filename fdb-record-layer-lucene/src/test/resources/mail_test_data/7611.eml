 in the air, you're not=20

likely to notice a tough landing. Why? What's the matter?"  "Matter enough!=
" said Jack. "Your right=20

wing is half torn away. Some of the rivets are actually gone. Many more are=
 loose. You'll never get=20

me up in this kite, not until a lot of work has been done on it."  "Great g=
uns!" Stew exploded. "We'll=20

never catch up with the _Black Bee_ now! And that means we miss the big sho=
w!"  "There's that=20

jet plane," Jack suggested.  "Yes, sure!" Stew scoffed. "And who's got it? =
Two Germans, three=20

Japs, and two machine guns!"  "One German, I think," said Ted. "I'm positiv=
e that one of them fell=20

or jumped from the plane. I saw him hit the water. Still," he added slowly,=
 "there are four of them,=20

and with machine guns--that's a lot."  "What do you need for fixing the pla=
ne?" Mary asked.=20

"Rivets," said Jack. "Hot rivets. Got any in your outfit?"  "We might have.=
" The girl did not smile. "I'll=20

ask my dusky godfather." She hurried down to the canoes, where the natives =
were having a sun=20

bath.  The boys could see her talking to the men. They found it interesting=
 and amusing. She=20

would ask a question of the Chief. At once they would all explode into wild=
 talk. This would die=20

down abruptly. Then the Chief would say a few words to Mary.  This was repe=
ated a dozen times.=20

Then she came rushing back.  "Yes," she previous hysteria or neurasthenia h=

the consideration of the action of electricity in another form, that of nat=
ural electricity or lightning.=20

The effects of this are practically the same as those of the forms previous=
ly described, except=20

such differences as seem to be fairly accounted for by the vastly greater f=
orce of the currents with=20

which we have to deal. Injuries and deaths from lightning stroke have been =
recognized and=20

described for many centuries, and we have now a large collection of careful=
 observations on them.=20

They occur in most temperate regions with comparative frequency. In France =
the number of=20

deaths from 1835 to 1852 inclusive (eighteen years) was 1,308. In England, =
including Wales, there=20

were in twenty years, 1865 to 1884 inclusive, 416 deaths. In 1846 Mr. Eben =
Merriam, of Brookline,=20

wrote to Mr. Arago that in the three last years about 150 persons had been =
killed by lightning in=20

the United States. In thirty years, from 1855 to 1884 inclusive, we find 10=
1 deaths in=20
