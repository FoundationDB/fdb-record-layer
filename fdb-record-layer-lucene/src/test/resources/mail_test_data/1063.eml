tent-poles and went fifteen feet up in the air like a balloon, then collaps=
ed. The dog, I regret to say,=20

did not stay at his post, so a quantity of beer will have to be marked down=
 as lost. This same bull=20

has a pal, a white bull terrier, who came out with the officers' class the =
other morning. We had not=20

been drilling more than fifteen minutes when he came back with a large rabb=

night. It certainly was good.  One of the mechanics has forged an Iron Cros=
s which has been=20

presented to the dog in recognition of his services.  I doubt if I shall ev=
er be able to sit up to a table=20

again regularly. I would much sooner sleep on the floor, and I have found, =
when on leave, that I=20

preferred sitting on a hearthrug to a chair. Even while writing this I am l=
ying on my blankets. My=20

pipe is burnt down on one side from lighting it from my candle.            =

------  To-day being Sunday and as there were only two of us left in the te=
nt, the others being on=20

leave, we gave it a thorough spring cleaning. It needed it! By some oversig=
ht the sun came out to-

day, so that helped. We also washed up all our canteens and pannikins with =
disinfectant.  The=20

infantry are bayonet-fighting and practicing charges every day. If you want=
 a thrill, see them=20

coming over the top at you with a yell; the bayonets catch the light and fl=
ash in a decidedly=20

menacing fashion. They practice on dummies, and are so enthusiastic that th=
ey need new=20

dummies almost every lesson.  Every man, on becoming a soldier, becomes a m=
an with a number=20

and an identification disk. My number is 45555 and my "cold meat ticket," a=
 tag made of red fiber,=20

is hanging round my neck on a piece of string.                    ---------=
----------------------------  We're=20

packing up and expect to go away next week. Of course, it may be another bl=
uff, but somehow I=20

noticed that make lateral curves. One of these hexagonal columns measures a=
t one end as=20

follows:--Diagonals, 27, 29, and 29=C2=BD inches; sides, 16=C2=BD, 13=C2=BC=
, 11=C2=BD, 17, 11=C2=BD, and 16=C2=BD inches.=20

The convexity of this column is a little more than an inch. The best instan=
ces of these prisms occur=20

one mile east from the village of Deerfield.  Masses of greenstone are foun=
d at considerable=20

distance from the range, among the puddingstone. One has been noticed weigh=
ing many tons, a=20

hundred rods from the range of greenstone, and on much higher ground. Some =
of these scattered=20

fragments contain chalcedony. A specimen of petrosiliceous porphyry has bee=
n found among the=20

same puddingstone, and also a mass of singular, though not well defined, am=
ygdaloid, whose=20

base is similar to wacke, and imbedded substances are calcareous spar, chlo=
rite, and green earth.=20

The elevation in the north part of Sunderland, called Toby, from 800 to 900=
 feet high, is chiefly=20

conglomerate, red, brown, or greenish, which, in some parts, alternates wit=
h chlorite slate,=20

secondary argillite, and a sandstone that seems to be passing into gray wac=
ke slate. Some of the=20

imbedded masses in this puddingstone are quite large, its cement is frequen=
tly calcareous, its=20

aspect is singular, and it is very different from the puddingstone before d=
escribed, On the opposite=20

side of the river. At the foot of this mountain, in the bottom of Connectic=
ut river, distinct=20

impressions of fish are found on a schistose rock, like the one above menti=
oned as passing into=20

gray wacke slate. This same species of slate occurs in several other places=
 at the bottom of=20

Connecticut river, as at the fall in Gill. In this last place bituminous sh=
ale has been noticed.  In=20

Mount Toby, in Sunderland, is a cave nearly 150 feet above the bed of Conne=
cticut river. It opens=20

to the north and west, forming a quarter of a circle, is 130 feet in extent=
, 60 feet deep, and from 3=20

to 20 wide. A little to the south of it, is a fissure in the=20


_
been fitted out with a "field service-dressing," a packet containing two ba=
ndages and safety pins,=20

which we have to sew into the right-hand bottom corner of our tunics. We ha=
ve also been given=20

our active service pay book, a little account book in which we have our pay=
 entered. We don't get=20

paid much in the field. We carry this book instead.  It seems always cold a=
nd wide, and as deep as=20

the cave. So perfect is this division, that it appears as if cloven down by=
 the sword of some Titan.=20

Perhaps this cave and fissure were formed by the washing of the waters of t=
he lake we have=20

mentioned on the sandstone and conglomerate beneath; thus causing the super=
incumbent rock to=20

fall and separate. There is no appearance of any other=20
