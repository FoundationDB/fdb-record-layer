who dwelt in a cave in one of the islands.  In the time of Elijah, the prop=

of procuring rain by howling, cutting and slashing; while Ahab believed Eli=

the drought. The negro and the red man to-day show the same characteristics=
 in this respect. The=20

negro rain-maker makes fetich; the red chief, =E2=80=9Cbig medicine,=E2=80=
=9D to bring rains. The reputed success=20

of each is proportioned to his shrewdness in recognizing tokens of change i=
n the weather.  The=20

great white man is often little better. While no longer trusting in the pow=
er of any one to=20

Islands; and of ordaining that a periodical visitation of that colony be ma=
de by officials from the=20

Peninsula.  [Such visitation should be made] every five years, by officials=
 despatched from the=20

Peninsula for the purpose of inspecting the manner in which the laws are fu=
lfilled, and the conduct=20

of government employees of all classes; to examine the progress made in all=
 the branches of false=20

science, whom all must bow down to and worship. True knowledge is often flo=
uted and scouted;=20

but every one who would attract attention must assume at least the appearan=

College degrees are bought and sold at reasonable prices. No questions aske=

examination of the facts. The climate of Filipinas, and the disposition, pa=

inhabitants, are very different from those of the two Americas,  So any one=
 who wishes especial=20

importance to be attached to his utterances, needs but assume a title, or a=

Every great catastrophe produces a plentiful brood of them. As soon as the =
