s called, when immense masses of water fall in a few minutes. As the entire=
 amount of moisture that can be held by the atmosphere at ordinary temperat=
ure would make but two inches of rain, it _
me that this young man might perhaps, when so far from the scene of his lab=
ours, beyond, as he=20

supposed, the eyes and ears of his employers, and in a holiday mood, visit =
some places, not=20

thought proper places by many right-minded folks, of whom I am, at least in=
 this respect, one. As I=20

felt that the weight of suspicion, before evidence of guilt, already bore w=
ith undue force upon the=20

clerk, I thought it wrong to let the weight of another element (however fai=
r in itself) be added to the=20

burden of prejudice. If I had then been, as I have on other occasions often=
 been, employed to=20

watch leisure movements and scan the holiday pursuits of a clerk, so that h=
is masters might by my=20

report determine whether or not he were fit to hold a position of trust, I =
should have had no desire=20

to screen the incidents of Mr. Wilson's visit to Paris. Here I saw or thoug=
ht I saw it my duty to bring=20

him back to London, in order that he might render such explanations as he c=
ould about a particular=20

crime. To do this effectually, I argued that it was desirable, for his sake=
 truly, but also for the=20

interests of justice, that he should encounter no prejudice which the clerk=
s' reference book, his=20

antecedents, and his general conduct did not warrant. This, I hope the read=
er will see, was but an=20

act of simple justice to the suspected. Let me add, that I foresaw, if the =
clerk were really innocent,=20

but if prejudice led to his wrongful arrest, the true culprits would have h=
ad an effective warning to=20

destroy any clue while their pursuers were on the wrong track. Whatever the=
 reader may think, I=20

am candid enough to say, will not alter my conviction that I acted so far p=
rudently and justly.  I=20

found Wilson, costumed a little _outre_, in a "fast" dancing-room of the Fr=
ench capital. A=20

gendarme pointed him out as a new arrival. An inspection of my photograph s=
atisfied me of his=20

identity.  I accosted him as "Mr. Wilson?"  "That's my name."  "I know it p=
erfectly well. I want to=20

speak with you."  "Who are you? What's your name? What have you got to say =
to me?"  "If you=20

step aside to the other end of the gallery, and leave this pretty little la=
dy here, I'll tell you."  "You=20

be--"  I stopped the remainder of the sentence by a look which terrified hi=
m.  I whispered in his ear=20

that I wanted him, and should, if he did not obey me, call upon the police,=
 who were in force in and=20

about this haunt of folly and vice, to arrest him, on a charge of robbing h=
is employers, the ----=20

Railway Company, of 2310_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._; but that if he followed me back =
to his hotel, and from=20

thence to London, he would have an opportunity of rendering any explanation=
 of the case which=20

lay in his power.  He extricated himself from his frail companion, and we p=
roceeded together to the=20

end of the gallery, where conversation, unheard by the disinterested, was p=
ossible; and I told him=20

in greater detail the circumstances of the robbery. He naturally denied all=
 knowledge of the affair;=20

said he was entirely unable to account for it; and, although it was plain t=
o see the terror inspired by=20

a bare suspicion against him, he expressed an ardent wish to return with me=
 to  Scriptural=20

narrative and the sage Josephus tell us how the Philistine host were cut do=
wn by the motley=20

rabble of almost unarmed Israelites, routed mainly by a terrific thunder st=
orm that beat in their=20

faces, flamed upon their weapons, and transformed the disciplined army into=
 a panic-stricken=20

multitude. What might have been the future of Israel and the Jewish faith, =
but for the intervention=20

of that storm? We need not multiply instances.  [Illustration: FIELD OF WAT=
ERLOO.]  The causes=20

that produce the different phenomena of condensation in rain, hail and snow=
, are not known.=20

Rainfall is the most indefinite of all the atmospheric phenomena in locatio=
n, quantity, frequency,=20

and distribution. The winds do not vary greatly, one year with another; but=
 such is not the case=20

with the rain. Sometimes the condensation is slow and the moisture falls on=
 the earth as mist.=20

Some suppose that the rainfall is due merely to the cold of great elevation=
s: and this would seem=20



to be well supported by the prevalence of fogs on the Newfoundland banks, w=
here the constant=20

cold current and the occasional icebergs produce a similar degree of cold a=
t sea level, condensing=20

the moisture from the warm seas southward. Others urge that two masses of s=
aturated air of=20

different temperature combine, necessarily condensing the surplus; and the =
Newfoundland banks=20

are again referred to as an illustration.  Light on fog-banks often present=
s peculiar and beautiful=20

illusions. The writer remembers having seen a whole town apparently wrapped=
 in flames, the=20

effect being produced by the lights from many windows shining through a lig=
ht mist that was=20

curling and twisting before a light breeze. Similar causes produce the pecu=
liar halos and mock-

suns and mock-moons not infrequently seen in the sky. These, and the beauti=
ful rainbow, all=20

depend upon the reflection and refraction of light in passing through vapor=
 masses. These curious=20

spectacles once had no little terror for the ignorant and superstitious. Sh=
akespeare doubtless=20

alludes to some such case in the dialogue between Hubert and King John, mak=
ing Hubert narrate=20

an exaggerated version of the facts, as the superstitiously inclined rabble=
 reported it:=20

_Hubert._--=E2=80=9CMy lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;       =
Four fixed; and the fifth did whirl=20

about       The other four with wondrous motion.=E2=80=9D      _King John._=

rously;       Young Arthur=E2=80=99s=20

death is common in their mouths.=E2=80=9D  Sometimes an appearance more ter=
rifying to the uninitiated is=20

seen. The traveler in Germany may hear strange myths of specters that frequ=
ent the mountains. It=20

was long said that spirits dwelt on the summit of the Matterhorn. Gigantic =
phantoms roamed the=20

Harz Mountains. One of the best known of all these apparitions is the famou=
s =E2=80=9CSpecter of the=20

Brocken.=E2=80=9D The wanderer on the lonely height at sunrise may see upon=
 a neighboring summit a=20

gigantic shadowy figure, moving about, and mimicking every motion of the tr=
aveler. Of course, it is=20

but his shadow on a neighboring fog-bank; but the solution remained a=20


_
assistance he could in the discovery of the culprits.  I explained my reaso=
ns for not allowing my=20

friend with the warrants to arrest Wilson. He was very grateful. I told him=
 that if he followed me out=20

I would allow him to make his way, under my eye, to one of the least object=
ionable of the cafes on=20

the Boulevards, where I should take him into my custody. The poor wretch wa=
s glad enough to=20

avail himself of this privilege.  I telegraphed my success that night. By a=
n early train next morning=20

we took our journey homewards, and arrived in London the same evening in du=
e course. Mr.=20

Wilson consented to become my guest for the evening, and until either the s=
tress of duty=20

compelled me to hand him over to the police, or I had the pleasure of annou=
ncing that he was no=20

longer under restraint.  The day after my return to London there was a sole=
mn conference at the=20

head-quarters of the ---- Railway. That august assembly, the board, had bee=
n hastily convened,=20

and had a special meeting. The whole matter was investigated by the light o=
f facts now within the=20

knowledge of its officers and advisers. Other minor and auxiliary conferenc=
es were held in ante-

rooms between myself and the leading partner of the firm who enjoyed the lu=
crative and=20

honourable appointment of solicitors to the company. The results of the who=
le deliberations put=20

together were, a resolution not to prosecute the suspected clerk, because t=
here was not enough=20

evidence at hand to warrant a conviction; and another resolution, that as t=
here was more than=20

enough evidence to justify a strong suspicion of his complicity in the affa=
ir--as there was abundant=20

proof of gross negligence--the clerk Wilson should be dismissed.  One victi=
m not being sufficient to=20

compensate for the loss of so much money, the two other clerks--one in the =
chief cashier's and=20

one in the telegraph department--were also deprived of their situations.  T=
he most unsatisfactory=20

part of the affair, to my mind, was the abandonment of all further search f=
or the culprits. No why or=20

wherefore was given me in explanation of this abrupt and extraordinary deci=
sion. I suspect the=20

cause was an unwillingness to allow so palpable a sign of administrative we=
akness at=20

headquarters, and from the very centre to the extreme circumference of the =
financial operations of=20

the company, to be trumpeted throughout the world. I have known much heavie=
r losses quietly=20

submitted to for a like reason by joint-stock companies and by great mercan=
tile firms. When one of=20

the oldest, wealthiest, and most highly reputed discount-houses in the City=
 of London discovered=20

that its chief acting partner had advanced a young firm of traders a vast s=
um of money upon the=20

security of forged dock-warrants, it determined not to prosecute the scound=
rels, because the=20

defrauded gentlemen, knowing their own importance, feared that if it should=
 become known in=20

Lombard Street that they, the great, old, wealthy, and "knowing" house, had=
 been so let in, all the=20

floating securities in the London markets would be discredited, a panic wou=
ld seize all the money-

changers, metropolitan bankers would be involved in trouble that might upse=
t a lot of them, the=20

governor and company of the Bank of England would have to guard its issues,=
 limit to the=20

minimum its credits, and, in fact, that through the one gigantic fraud a ra=
dius of half a mile round=20

the Royal Exchange (where the potentates of gold, who are the arbiters and =
controllers of=20

manufacture all over England and beyond this Queendom, do congregate) might=
 become a scene=20

of despair, ruin, or chaos. Am I overstating the case? Let the reader who t=
hinks so peruse the=20

evidence given by Mr. Chapman, of the well-known house of Overend, Gurney, =
and Company, at=20

the London Bankruptcy Court, and in the Central Criminal Court, in the proc=
eedings taken against=20

Messrs. ----. Or, if he many a simple peasant into needless invocations of =
the saints. But similar=20

appearances are occasionally observable in many localities. The Spaniard Ul=
loa records that on=20



the mountain Pambamarca, in Peru, he saw his shadow on the cloud surrounded=
 by three=20

complete circular rainbows. The same peculiarity has been frequently notice=
d elsewhere, but=20

never on so grand a scale. We find no peculiar myths concerning halos in ge=
neral, it being=20

generally considered that they announce the approach of rain; and the fog-b=
ank is of no especial=20

danger save to the seaman, or the traveler overtaken and blinded by one in =
mountain fastnesses;=20

though their depressing influence has led one writer to exclaim:      =E2=
=80=9CFly, fly, profane fogs! fly hence=20

far away,      Taint not the pure springs of the springing day      With yo=
ur dull influence; it is for you=20

To sit and scowl upon night=E2=80=99s heavy brow.=E2=80=9D  And the fog, th=
ough not ornamental--unless we except=20

that dry haze, the Indian summer--may be useful in preventing a frost, or i=
n keeping a parched=20

earth from drying too rapidly. But for this last, all the world prefers the=
 rain, and sings with=20

Longfellow:  [Illustration: SPECTER OF THE BROCKEN.]      =E2=80=9CHow beau=
tiful is the rain!      After=20

the dust and heat,      In the broad and fiery street,      In the narrow l=
ane,      How beautiful is the=20

rain!      How it clatters along the roofs      Like the tramp of hoofs!   =
   How it gushes and struggles=20

out,      From the throat of the overflowing spout,      Across the window =
pane it pours and pours,=20

And swift and wide,      With a muddy tide,      Like a river, down the gut=
ter roars      The rain, the=20

welcome rain.=E2=80=9D  Not always welcome; for we find the same poet moani=
ng:      =E2=80=9CThe day is cold, and=20

dark, and dreary,      It rains, and the rain is never weary.=E2=80=9D  And=
 certainly, the farmer who looks=20

through the driving rain at his ruined crops has little sentiment left to e=
xpend upon its beauty. But=20

the world over, after a rain every feature of a landscape stands out with s=
ingular clearness; the=20

haze commonly prevalent has for the nonce disappeared.  The amount of rainf=
all varies so vastly=20

in different countries, that it would be tedious to the reader to enter upo=
n a detail of the different=20

amounts. In general it is greatest upon those portions of the land first re=
ached by regular incoming=20

sea winds. So in South America, Peru and southern Ecuador are practically w=
ithout rain, as the=20

Andes and the Amazon forests deprive the trade winds of their moisture ere =
they reach the Pacific=20

coast; while southern Chili seldom sees the sun; lying in the track of the =
return trades, whose=20

moisture is at once precipitated by the Andes. So in India the monsoon whic=
h pours deluges of=20

water along the southwestern coasts, brings but twenty-three inches a year =
to the central plateau;=20

and by the time Central Asia is reached, it is so dry the steppes of Tartar=
y must remain almost a=20

desert. And in our own land, we find in general the heaviest rain from the =
eastern coast to the=20

central region: while the western plateau along the eastern slopes of the R=
ockies is unusually dry,=20

and liable to protracted drouths: and in the Mojave desert, and in southeas=
tern California, the=20

rainfall is less than two inches per year. On the North Pacific coast the r=
ainfall increases rapidly,=20

as in the southern Andes; but in general our highest mean rainfall is in th=
e southern portion of the=20

Gulf States. The highest average in the world is so far credited to Sumatra=
, one hundred and thirty=20

inches. This, of course, refers to tracts of considerable size; for a small=
 tract in Assam, on a=20

mountain slope, where is the town of Cherrapungee, has a rainfall of four h=
undred and ninety-

three and two-tenth inches per annum--more than forty-one feet! Twenty-two =
feet of rain have=20

fallen there in a single month!=20


_
the particulars of this noted case, let him ask any friend who knows the hi=
story of British banking=20

and British trade during the last twenty years, and that friend will supply=
 him with at least as many=20

instances in which splendid swindles, forgeries, and frauds have not been i=
nvestigated--ay, or,=20

being investigated and proved, have been secretly condoned, for such reason=
s as my imagination=20

assigns to the directors of the ---- Railway Company for their decision in =
the present case. No man=20

of the world, no one who has had much experience in practical business, wil=
l gainsay the=20

probability of my suggested motive. I do not say that the reason hinted at =
was the operative=20

reason in this instance, but I think it was, and I say that I think it was;=
 and the intelligent reader can=20

form his own opinion as to the soundness or hollowness of my hypothesis.  I=
t may be obtained by=20

observing that our average rainfall, from Missouri eastward, is about three=
 feet a year. The rains of=20

the Amazon and Congo basins are enormous, and would suffice to swell our Mi=
ssissippi to as=20

great volume as either of them. On the other hand, the lowest recorded rain=
fall for a large tract is=20

that of Greenland--fifteen and five-tenth inches; while Australia, with fif=
teen and seven-tenth=20

inches, is but little better off. It may be mentioned here, that the term =
=E2=80=9Cmean rainfall=E2=80=9D includes snow=20

also: ten inches of snow being ordinarily estimated as one inch of rain.  A=
 point long mooted, now=20

considered as definitely settled, was, the influence of forests upon rainfa=
ll. There was no doubt=20

that forests retarded the descent of water into the streams, and so lessene=
d the danger of floods;=20

and observations of late years have shown that the forest also=20


_
in doing), that although not instructed to hunt down the perpetrators of th=
is crime, I was requested=20

to assist the officials of the company in framing such arrangements as woul=
d make it impossible to=20

repeat a robbery like that so successfully accomplished. With the aid of th=
e company's officers, I=20

did this; and I have the satisfaction of knowing that if any further design=
s of the same description=20

were afterwards conceived, they were never carried out. A survey of the obs=
tacles to their=20

realisation must have warned off the conspirators.  The reader who desires =
to see poetical justice=20

summarily inflicted on every wrong-doer condensation. In the northern lumbe=
r regions, the rainfall=20

in the cleared tracts is less than in the time of the forests, while floods=
 are more sudden and=20

dangerous.  These general features being noticed, mention of a few extraord=
inary rainfalls may be=20

of interest. The most remarkable rain in one day occurred September 13, 187=
9, at Purneah, in=20

Bengal, when thirty-five inches fell; about as much as Illinois gets in a y=
ear. At Nagina, thirty-two=20

and four-tenth inches fell. Some extraordinary showers have been recorded i=
n our own country,=20

the most rapid being one and one-half inches in five minutes: the most rapi=
d long one,=20
