philodendron monstera you can."  Rachel glanced meaningly at the door, as i=
f she considered the interview might now with decency come to an end. Neith=
er Peachy nor Irene took the hint, however. The main object of their missio=
n had not yet been broached.  "You've not written the Luxburg, and at Schne=
eberg. The dip of the strata of these granites of Fichtelberg is generally =
only from 6 to 10 degrees, rarely (at Schneeberg) 18 degrees. According to =
the dips I observed in the neighbouring strata of gneiss and mica-slate, I =
should philodendron monstera you can."  Rachel glanced meaningly at the doo=
r, as if she considered the interview might now with decency come to an end=
. Neither Peachy nor Irene took the hint, however. The main object of their=
 mission had not yet been broached.  "You've not written the Luxburg, and a=
t Schneeberg. The dip of the strata of these granites of Fichtelberg is gen=
erally only from 6 to 10 degrees, rarely (at Schneeberg) 18 degrees. Accord=
ing to the dips I observed in the neighbouring strata of gneiss and mica-sl=
ate, I should _
well tell my story to the whole bunch of you together. Then you'll see the =
sort of thing we're up=20

against. They've taken our idea, and they're trying to beat us on our own g=
round. That's what it's=20

all about."     CHAPTER X  The School Carnival   The Camellia Buds consider=
ed that they=20

possessed a real grievance. The difference between an animated toy-shop and=
 waxworks was so=20

slight as to be immaterial. In both the figures would require to be wound u=
p, after which they would=20

perform various antics. The idea had certainly originated with Peachy, and =
the Starry Circle had=20

merely copied it. Their stunt was in fact a shameless plagiarism.  "Why cou=
ldn't they have joined=20

with us and we'd have done the toy-shop all together?" demanded Agnes cross=
ly.  "Oh, I don't=20

know. It's just their perversity. It'll look so stupid to have two separate=
 shows. Whichever comes=20

last will seem so stale after the other."  "Why, of course, ours will come =
first! It _must_!"  "There'll=20

be a fight for it."  "We can't squabble at the carnival with Miss Rodgers a=
nd Miss Morley looking=20

on. We'd better have our battle beforehand and get it over."  "Tell the Sta=
rs we mean to have first=20

innings?"  "They'll never agree!"  "Look here, it's no use coming to open w=
ar with them. I vote we=20

try diplomacy. Has anybody thought of the programs yet?"  "I heard the seni=
ors groaning over=20

having to paint covers for them."  "Well, let's go to them privately and vo=
lunteer to help. Then we=20

shall have the opportunity of telling them that the Transition stunt is to =
be in two divisions, and that=20

Part I will be taken by ourselves."  "Quite a brain-throb!"  "Renie, I'm be=
ginning to admire you!"=20

"Peachy can paint beautifully!"  "So can Joan and Esther. Shall I go and sa=
y we offer to do six=20

programs? Right-o! Come with me, Peachy. You're our champion wheedler."  Th=
e two delegates=20

started at once on their diplomatic mission. They felt indeed that there wa=
s no time to be lost. They=20

found several of the prefects collected in Rachel's bedroom, where possibly=
 they were having a=20

little private candy party, for there were sounds of a rustling of paper an=
d a shutting of drawers=20

before they were granted permission to enter the precincts. The Transition =
girls always envied the=20

seniors' rooms. These were on the seaward side of the house, and their balc=
ony had species=20

vegetate in other parts of those mountains at the brink of torrents, the te=
mperature of which is not=20

18 degrees. What is still more singular, forty feet distant from the point =
whence the springs gush=20

out at a temperature of 90 degrees, other springs are found perfectly cold.=
 They all follow for some=20

time a parallel direction; and the natives showed us that, by digging a hol=
e between the two=20

rivulets, they could procure a bath of any given temperature they pleased. =
It seems remarkable,=20

that in the hottest as well as the coldest climates, people display the sam=
e predilection for heat.=20

On the introduction of Christianity into Iceland, the inhabitants would be =
baptized only in the hot=20

springs of Hecla: and in the torrid zone, in the plains, as well as on the =
Cordilleras, the natives=20

flock from all parts to the thermal waters. The sick, who come to La Trinch=
era to use vapour-baths,=20

form a sort of frame-work over the spring with branches of trees and very s=
lender reeds. They=20

stretch themselves naked on this frame, which appeared to me to possess lit=
tle strength, and to be=20

dangerous of access. The Rio de Aguas Calientes runs towards the north-east=
, and becomes,=20

near the coast, a considerable river, swarming with great crocodiles, and c=
ontributing, by its=20

inundations, to the insalubrity of the shore.  We descended towards Porto C=
abello, having=20

constantly the river of hot water on our right. The road is extremely pictu=
resque, and the waters roll=20

down on the shelves of rock. We might have fancied we were gazing on the ca=
scades of the=20

Reuss, that flows down Mount St. Gothard; but what a contrast in the vigour=
 and richness of the=20

vegetation! The white trunks of the cecropia rise majestically amid bignoni=
as and melastomas.=20



They do not disappear till we are within a hundred toises above the level o=
f the ocean. A small=20

thorny palm-tree extends also to this limit; the slender pinnate leaves of =
which look as if they had=20

been curled toward the edges. This tree is very common in these mountains; =
but not having seen=20

either its fruit or its flowers, we are ignorant whether it be the piritu p=
alm-tree of the Caribbees, or=20

the Cocos aculeata of Jacquin.  The rock on this road presents a geological=
 phenomenon, the=20

more remarkable as the existence of real stratified granite has long been d=
isputed. Between La=20


_
decorations were very tasteful. The walls were gray, with a stenciled friez=
e of hydrangeas, and=20

there were soft-shaded Indian rugs on the polished wood floor. Rachel and h=
er roommates had=20

provided their own luxuries in the way of pretty cushions, table-covers, pi=
ctures, and flower-vases,=20

and the general effect was of harmonious comfort.  "Well? What can I do for=
 you?" inquired the=20

head girl briefly, as Stella admitted the diplomats.  It was not a very enc=
ouraging reception.=20

Possibly the prefects were annoyed at being disturbed in the midst of what =
they were doing.=20

Peachy, however, ignored Rachel's tone, and putting on her most winning smi=
le inquired:  "We=20

wonder if you're painting any program covers for the carnival?"  Rachel lol=
led back in her chair and=20

retied the bow that terminated her long dark pigtail.  "Perhaps we are and =
perhaps we aren't," was=20

her somewhat cryptic reply.  "The matter's in our hands coarse-grained gran=
ite appears, which,=20

from the disposition of the spangles of mica, collected in small groups, sc=
arcely admits of=20

confounding with gneiss, or with rocks of a schistose texture. This granite=
, divided into ledges of=20

two or three feet thick, is directed 52 degrees north-east, and slopes to t=
he north-west regularly at=20

an angle of from 30 or 40 degrees. The feldspar, crystallized in prisms wit=
h four unequal sides,=20

about an inch long, passes through every variety of tint from a flesh-red t=
o yellowish white. The=20

mica, united in hexagonal plates, is black, and sometimes green. The quartz=
 predominates in the=20

mass; and is generally of a milky white. I observed neither hornblende, bla=
ck schorl, nor rutile=20

titanite, in this granite. In some ledges we recognised round masses, of a =
blackish gray, very=20

quartzose, and almost destitute of mica. They are from one to two inches di=
ameter; and are found=20

in every=20


_
and fro on a cane _sedia_.  "I know," put in Irene, trying to be tactful. "=
We only thought that=20

perhaps you might care to have a little help. Some of us would be ready to =
paint a few if you like."=20

This put a different complexion on the case. The seniors, always bristling =
for their privileges,=20

resented idle curiosity--on the part of the Transition. But an offer of hel=
p was another matter.=20

"There certainly is a great number to be done," said Erica, with a beseechi=
ng look at Rachel.  The=20

head girl thawed a little.  "Well, we shouldn't mind your taking a few off =
our hands," she conceded.=20

"Half a dozen? Sybil, will you get those programs out of my drawer? Put any=
thing you like on=20

them--flowers, birds, figures, or landscapes. I'll lend you this to copy th=
e printing from. Let me=20

mountains. These are not imbedded fragments, as at Greiffenstein in Saxony,=
 but aggregations of=20

particles which seem to have been subjected to partial attractions. I could=
 not follow the line of=20

junction of the gneiss and granitic formations. According to angles taken i=
n the valleys of Aragua,=20

the gneiss appears to descend below the granite, which must consequently be=
 of a more recent=20

formation. The appearance of a stratified granite excited my attention the =
more, because, having=20

had the direction of the mines of Fichtelberg in Franconia for several year=
s, I was accustomed to=20

see granites divided into ledges of three or four feet thick, but little in=
clined, and forming masses=20

like towers, or old ruins, at the summit of the highest mountains.* (* At O=
chsenkopf, at=20
