dracaena marginata for select society, and there exists amongst them a want=

ct society, and there exists amongst them a want of moral discrimination, a=
 toleration of publicly known vicious characters of both sexes, that is not=
 a little embarrassing to the stranger. This is more particularly the case =
with the female part of society, with many of only half that speed towards =
Turin. So, also, the Lisbon earthquake traveled three times as rapidly arou=

where any change in level is at once detected, upheaval is quite as common =
as subsidence.=20

Much speculation has been spent upon the fact of an earthquake being very s=

y, the majority of which=20

are men of inferior classes, no very select assemblies can be expected; and=
 those whose=20

character and education might have given another tone to it, are here, from=
 necessity,=20

the same that produces calm when two waves interfere, crest to trough; the =

Experiments with explosions in mines show that vibrations of the soil trave=

second. So a vibration extremely destructive to a region underlaid by massi=
ve rocks might be=20

comparatively harmless to a town on a sand-bed or mud-bank. Observations on=
 earthquakes=20

themselves have shown great variation in the rate of speed. The earthquake =
of Germany of 1846=20

moved four hundred and ninety-two yards per second; while the earthquake of=
 Viege in 1855=20

traveled nine hundred and sixty yards a second toward Strasburg,=20
