If these alternate light and dark markings are lost and the organ has not u=

The duke was her uncle, and treated with her successfully for the surrender=
 of her dower lands to=20

her children, on condition that she received annually a certain sum of mone=
y in compensation.=20

When this had been concluded, and the duke had placed garrisons in the king=
=E2=80=99s name in some of=20

the strong places of the country, he returned to Paris, carrying with him t=
he young duke and his=20

two brothers, who were graciously received by the king and queen.  The duke=
 of Orleans had at=20

this time gone to take possession of the duchy of Luxembourg[27], with the =
consent of the king of=20

Bohemia, to whom it belonged, and with whom he had concluded some private a=
greement. Having=20

CHAP. VI.      CLEMENT DUKE OF BAVARIA IS ELECTED EMPEROR OF GERMANY,=20

AND AFTERWARD CONDUCTED WITH A NUMEROUS RETINUE TO         FRANKFORT.   Thi=
s=20

year, Clement duke of Bavaria[28] was elected emperor of Germany, after the=
 electors had=20

censured and deposed the king of Bohemia. Clement was conducted by them to =
Frankfort, with an=20

escort of forty thousand armed men, and laid siege to the town because it h=
ad been contrary to his=20

interests. He remained before it forty days, during which time an epidemica=
l disorder raged in his=20

army, and carried off fifteen thousand of his men. A treaty was begun at th=
e expiration of the forty=20

days, when the town submitted to the emperor.  The towns of Cologne, Aix, a=
nd several more=20

s, tumors, and=20

degeneration in them may be recognized.  =3DThe Spleen.=3D=E2=80=94This org=
an will be found in an oblique=20

position at the left side of the stomach. Grasping it firmly in the left ha=
nd and drawing it forward, it=20

can easily be detached. Normally in the adult it is about five inches in le=
ngth by three inches in=20

breadth by one inch in thickness, and weighs about seven ounces. The size, =
color, and=20

consistency of the organ should be noted, as well as abnormal thickenings o=
f its capsule and the=20

presence of any tubercles or tumors in its substance. The spleen softens ve=
ry early as the result of=20

decomposition, and this decomposition should not be mistaken for a patholog=
ical condition.  =3DThe=20

Intestines.=3D=E2=80=94In cases of suspected poisoning the greatest care sh=
ould be taken in the removal of=20

the intestines and the stomach. Double ligatures should be placed in the fo=
llowing situations so as=20

to preserve the contents of the organs intact: (1) at the end of the duoden=
um; (2) at the end of the=20

ilium; and (3) at the lower portion of the rectum; and an incision should b=
e made with a pair of=20

scissors between these ligatures. The jejunum and ilium should first be rem=
oved together by=20

seizing the gut with the left hand, keeping it on the stretch, and cutting =
with a pair of scissors=20

through the mesentery close to its intestinal attachment. The c=C3=A6cum, c=
olon, and rectum should=20

then be removed in a similar manner.  The intestines being placed in large =
absolutely clean=20

dishes, which have previously been rinsed with distilled water, are opened;=
 great care being taken=20

that none of the intestinal contents are lost. The small intestines should =
be opened in one dish and=20

the large intestine in another. A portion of the intestines where morbid ap=
pearances are most likely=20

to be seen in cases of poisoning are the duodenum, the=20
