is now 84 years old,=20

recalls that at least three of the plantations in the vicinity were owned o=
r operated by Minorcans.=20

She says that the Minorcans were popularly referred to in the section as "T=
urnbull's Darkies," a=20

name they apparently resented. This caused many of them, she claims, to dro=
p or change their=20

names to Spanish or American surnames.  Christine moved to Fernandina a few=
 years after her=20

freedom, and there lived near the southern tip of Amelia Island, where Negr=
o ex-slaves lived in a=20

small settlement all their own. This settlement still exists, although many=
 of its former residents are=20

either dead or have moved away.  Christine describes the little Amelia Isla=
nd community as=20

practically self-sustaining, its residents raising their own food, meats, a=
nd other commodities.=20

Fishing was a favorite vocation with them, and some of then established the=
mselves as small=20

merchants of sea foods.  Several of the families of Amelia Island, accordin=
g to the ex-slave, were=20

large ones, and her own relatives, the Drummonds, were among the largest of=
 these.  Christine=20

Mitchell regards herself as one of the oldest remaining ex-slaves in the Sa=
int Augustine section,=20

and is very well known in the neighborhood of her home at St. Francis and O=
neida Streets.=20

MOORE   AN EX-SLAVE WHO WAS RESOURCEFUL  In a little blacksmith shop at 111=
4=20

Madison Street, Palatka, is a busy little horse-shoer who was born in slave=
ry eighty-seven years=20

ago. _Lindsey Moore_, blacksmith, leather-tanner ex-marble shooting champio=
n and a number of=20

other things, represents one of the most resourceful former slaves yet foun=
d in the state.  Moore=20

was born in 1850 on the plantation of John B. Overtree, in Forsythe County,=
 Georgia. He was one=20

of the six children of Eliza Moore; all of them remained the property of Ov=
ertree until freed.  On the=20

Overtree plantation the slave children were allowed considerable time for p=
lay until their tenth or=20

twelfth years; Lindsey took full advantage of this opportunity and became v=
ery skillful at marble-

shooting. It was here that he first learned to utilize his talents profitab=
ly. 'Massa Overtree'=20

discovered the ability of Lindsey and another urchin to shoot marbles, and =
began taking them into=20

town to compete with the little slaves of other owners. There would be bett=
ing on the winners.  Mr.=20

Overtree won some money in this manner, Lindsey and his companion being con=
sistent winners.=20

But Lindsey saw possibilities other than the glory of his victories in this=
 new game; with pennies=20

that some of the spectators tossed him he began making small wagers of his =
own with his=20

competitors, and soon had amassed quite a small pile of silver for those da=
ys.  Although shoes=20

were unheard-of in Lindsey's youth, he used to watch carefully whenever a c=
ow was skinned and=20

its hide tanned to make shoes for the women and the 'folks in the big house=
'. Through his attention=20

to the tanning operations he learned everything about tanning except one so=
lution that he could=20

not discover. It was not until years later that he learned that the jealous=
ly-guarded ingredient was=20

plain salt and water. By the time he had learned it, however, he had so mas=
tered the tanning=20

operations that he at once added it to his sources of livelihood.  Lindsey =
escaped much of the farm=20

work on the Overtree place by learning to skillfully assist the women who m=
ade cloth out of the=20

cotton from the fields. He grew very fast at cleaning 'rods', clearing the =
looms and other=20

operations; when, at thirteen, it became time for him to pick cotton he had=
 become so fast at=20

helping with spinning and weighing the cotton that others had picked that h=
e almost entirely=20



escaped the picking himself.  Soap-making was another of the plantation art=
s that Lindsey=20

mastered early. His ability to save every possible ounce of grease from the=
 meats he cooked=20

added many choice bits of pork to his otherwise meatless fare; he was able =
to spend many hours=20

in the shade pouring water over oak ashes that other young slaves were pass=
ing picking cotton or=20

hoeing potatoes in the burning sun.  Lindsey's first knowledge of the appro=
ach of freedom came=20

when he heard a loud brass band coming down the road toward the plantation =
playing a strange,=20

lively tune while a number of soldiers in blue uniforms marched behind. He =
ran to the front gate=20

and was ordered to take charge of the horse of one of the officers in such =
an abrupt tone until he=20

'begin to shaking in my bare feet! There followed much talk between the off=
icers and Lindsey's=20

mistress, with the soldiers finally going to bring home to us the fact that=
, important as the results of=20

an investigation of origins are, there is still a limit to their importance=
.  Again, while we allow no=20

prejudice to stand in the way of our acceptance of Evolution, we may fairly=
 call upon Evolution to=20

be true to itself. We may call upon it to recognise the possibility of deve=
lopment in the future as=20

well as the fact of development in the past, and not to shut up the hopes a=
nd aspirations of our=20

race in a mundane egg because the mundane egg happens to be the special pro=
vince of the=20

physiologist. The series of developments has proceeded from the inorganic t=
o the organic, from=20

the organic upwards to moral and intellectual life. Why should it be arrest=
ed there? Why should it=20

not continue its upward course and arrive at a development which might be d=
esignated as spiritual=20

life? Surely the presumption is in favour of a continued operation of the l=
aw. Nothing can be more=20

arbitrary than the proceeding of Comte, who, after tracing humanity, as he =
thinks, through the=20

Theological and Metaphysical stages into the Positive, there closes the ser=
ies and assumes that=20

the Positive stage is absolutely final. How can he be sure that it will not=
 be followed, for example,=20

by one in which man will apprehend and commune with the Ruler of the Univer=
se, not through=20

mythology or dogma, but through Science? He may have had no experience of s=
uch a phase of=20

human existence, nor may he be able at present distinctly to conceive it. B=
ut had he lived in the=20

Theological or the Metaphysical era he would have been equally without expe=
rience of the=20

Positive, and have had the same difficulty in conceiving its existence. His=
 finality is an assumption=20

apparently without foundation.  By Spiritual Life we do not mean the life o=
f a disembodied spirit, or=20

anything supernatural and anti-scientific, but a life the motives of which =
are beyond the world of=20

sense, and the aim of which is an ideal, individual and collective, which m=
ay be approached but=20

cannot be attained under our present conditions, and the conception of whic=
h involves the hope of=20

an ulterior and better state. The Positivists themselves often use the word=
 "spiritual," and it may be=20

assumed that they mean by it something higher in the way of aspiration than=
 what is denoted by=20

the mere term moral, though they may not look forward to any other state of=
 being than this.  We=20

do not presume, of course, in these few pages to broach any great question,=
 our only purpose=20

being to point out a possible aberration or exaggeration of the prevailing =
school of thought. But it=20

must surely be apparent to the moral philosopher, no less than to the stude=
nt of history, that at the=20

time of the appearance of Christianity, a crisis took place in the developm=
ent of humanity which=20

may be not unfitly described as the commencement of Spiritual Life. The cha=
nge was not abrupt. It=20

had been preceded and heralded by the increasing spirituality of the Hebrew=
 religion, especially in=20

the teachings of the prophets, by the spiritualization of Greek philosophy,=
 and perhaps by the=20

sublimation of Roman duty; but it was critical and decided. So much is admi=
tted even by those=20



who deplore the advent of Christianity as a fatal historical catastrophe, w=
hich turned away men's=20

minds from the improvement of their material condition to the pursuit of a =
chimerical ideal. Faith,=20

Hope, and Charity, by which the Gospel designates the triple manifestation =
of spiritual life, are new=20

names for new things; for it is needless to say that in classical Greek the=
 words have nothing like=20

their Gospel signification. It would be difficult, we believe, to find in a=
ny Greek or Roman writer an=20

expression of hope for the future of humanity. The nearest approach to such=
 a sentiment, perhaps,=20

is in the political Utopianism of Plato. The social ideal is placed in a go=
lden age which has=20

irretrievably passed away. Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, even if it were a more =
serious production than it=20

is, seems to refer to nothing more than the pacification of the Roman Empir=
e and the restoration of=20

its material prosperity by Augustus. But Christianity, in the Apocalypse, a=
t once breaks forth into a=20

confident prediction of the ultimate triumph of good over evil, and of the =
realization of the ideal.=20

The moral aspiration--the striving after an ideal of character, personal an=
d social, the former in and=20

through the latter--seems to be the special note of the life, institutions,=
 literature, and art of=20

Christendom. Christian Fiction, for example, is pervaded by an interest in =
the development and=20

elevation of character for which we look in vain in the _Arabian Nights_, w=
here there is no=20

development of character, nothing but incident and adventure. Christian scu=
lpture, inferior perhaps=20

in workmanship to that of Phidias, derives its superior interest from its c=
onstant suggestion of a=20

spiritual ideal. The=20


_
a short distance away from the plantation.  The soldiers took command of th=
e spring that was used=20

for a water supply for the plantation, giving Lindsey another opportunity t=
o make money. He would=20

be sent from the plantation to the spring for water, and on the way back wo=
uld pass through the=20

camp of the soldiers. These would be happy to pay a few pennies for a cup o=
f water rather than=20

take the long hike to the Spring conformity to the fashions and ordinances =
of the present world; an=20

inner one of protest against the present world and anticipation of an ideal=
 state of things; and this=20

duality is reproduced in the separate existence of the spiritual society or=
 Church, submitting to=20

existing social arrangements, yet struggling to transcend them, and to tran=
smute society by the=20

realization of the Christian's social ideal. With this is=20

before finally returning to the plantation. Out of his profits he bought hi=
s first pair of shoes--though=20

nearly a grown man.  The soldiers finally departed, with all but five of th=
e Overtree slaves joyously=20

trooping behind them. Before leaving, however, they tore up the railroad an=
d its station, burning=20

the ties and heating the rails until red then twisting them around tree-tru=
nks. Wheat and the=20

interests of the present to future good, and the interests of the present w=
orld to those of the world=20

of hope. Apart from this, the death of Christ (and that of Socrates also), =
instead of being an=20

instance of "sweet reasonableness," would be out of the pale of reason alto=
gether.  It is perhaps=20

the absence of an ideal that prevents our feeling satisfied with Utilitaria=
nism. The=20
