The mirage, indeed, suddenly became reality--a mirage only because she had =
proclaimed it such. She had beheld in it, as he spoke, a is apt to repine a=
t the hard fate which seems determined to snatch him from all the joys of l=
ife. I have not had many of them, and the consolation I had looked forward =
to in your contemplated union with my ungrateful child has been denied me. =
You look tired, _
thing, this miracle, has happened in spite of us. Henceforth you belong to =
me--do you hear?"=20

Once more the candles flared up.  "We cannot drift. We must decide now upon=
 some definite=20

action. Our lives are our own, to make as we choose. You said you were goin=
g away. And you=20

meant--alone?"  The eyes were wide, now, with fright. made your fortune I w=
as to share it. You are=20

in trouble now, and I will share it. Give me a kiss, and say you love me!" =
 "I should be a beast if I=20

didn't," said Jeremiah, kissing her. "You're something like a mother!"  "Je=
remiah, if that venomous=20

wretch Phoebe Farebrother had married you, would you be in danger now?"  "N=
o;=20


_
"Oh, I must--I must," she said. "Don't--don't talk about it." And she put f=
orth a hand over his.  "I will=20

talk about it," he declared, trembling. "I have thought it all out," and th=
is time it was her fingers that=20

tightened. "You are going away. And shouldn't have been compelled to do wha=
t I have done."=20

"Ah! She called you a reptile, and I am your mother. Oh, to be even with he=
r--to be even with her!"=20

Half an hour afterward Jeremiah Pamflett was in the presence of Miser Fareb=
rother. The miser=20


_
For a moment the current stopped.  "No, no!" she cried, almost in terror. T=
he first fatalist must=20

have been a woman, and the vision of rent prison bars drove her mad. "No, w=
e could never be=20

happy."  "We can--we will be happy," he said, with a conviction that was un=
shaken. "Do you hear=20

me? I will not debase what I have to say by resorting to comparisons. But--=
others I know have=20

been happy are happy, though their happiness cannot be spoken of with ours.=
 Listen. You will go=20

away--for a little while--and afterwards we shall be together for all time.=
 Nothing shall separate us:=20

We never have graciousness; there was even cordiality in his manner, and ha=
d Jeremiah's usually=20

clear mind not been unbalanced by the threatening clouds which hung above h=
im, this apparently=20

favourable demeanour would have rendered him suspicious, and put him on his=
 guard. Experience=20

had taught him that there was always mischief in the wind when Miser Farebr=
other's words were=20

smooth and fair.  "I sent a telegram for you, Jeremiah," said Miser Farebro=
ther.  "Yes, sir," said=20

Jeremiah; "my mother told me so. Fortunately I was on my way to you."  "You=
 have brought the=20

books with you?"  "Here they are,=20

missing you, have run after the false gods. And you--I say it with truth-ne=
eded me. We will go to=20

live at Grenoble, as my father and mother lived. We will take up their duti=
es there. And if it seems=20

possible, I will go into public life. When I return, I shall find you--wait=
ing for me--in the garden."  So=20

real had the mirage  "You anticipate my wishes, Jeremiah. What master was e=

will go into the accounts presently. Before I sent for you, Jeremiah, I was=
 in great pain, and feared=20
