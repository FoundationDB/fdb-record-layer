and prepare for Sunday's services. All slaves were required to appear on Mo=
nday mornings as=20

clean as possible with their clothing mended and heads combed.  Lye soap wa=
s used both for=20

laundering and bathing. It was made from fragments of fat meat and skins th=
at were carefully=20

saved for that purpose. Potash was secured from oak ashes. This mixture was=
 allowed to set for a=20

certain period of time, then cooked to a jelly-like consistency. After cool=
ing, the soap was cut into=20

square bars and "lowanced out" (allowance) to the slaves according to the n=
umber in each family.=20

Once Duncan was given a bar of "sweet" soap by his mistress for doing a par=
ticularly nice piece of=20

work of polishing the harness of her favorite mare and so proud was he of t=
he gift that he put it=20

among his Sunday clothes to make them smell sweet. It was the first piece o=
f toilet sopa that he=20

had ever seen; and it caused quite a bit of envy among the other slave chil=
dren.  Duncan Gaines=20

does not remember his grandparents but thinks they were both living on some=
 nearby plantation.=20

His father was the plantation blacksmith and Duncan liked to look on as plo=
wshares, single trees,=20

horse shoes, etc were turned out or sharpened. His mother was strong and he=
althy, so she toiled=20

all day in the fields. Duncan always listened for his mother's return from =
the field, which was=20

heraled by commander from his first lost field. Through all Protestant Euro=
pe flew the tidings of a=20

great deliverance and the name of a great deliverer.  On to Vienna cried ho=
pe and daring then. On=20

to Vienna; history still regretfully repeats the cry. Gustavus judged other=
wise--and whatever his=20

reason was we may be sure it was not weak. Not to the Danube therefore but =
to the Main and=20

Rhine the tide of conquest rolled. The Thuringian forest gleams with fires =
that guide the night=20

march of the Swede. Frankfort the city of empire opens her gates to him who=
 will soon come as=20

the hearts of all men divine not as a conqueror in the iron garb of war but=
 as the elect of Germany=20

to put on the imperial crown. In the cellars of the Prince Bishop of Bamber=
g and Wurtzburg the rich=20

wine is broached for heretic lips. Protestantism everywhere uplifts its hea=
d, the Archbishop of=20

Mainz, chief of the Catholic persecutors becomes a fugitive in his turn. Je=
suit and Capuchin must=20

cower or fly. All fortresses are opened by the arms of Gustavus, all hearts=
 are opened by his=20

gracious manner, his winning words, his sunny smile. To the people accustom=
ed to a war of=20

massacre and persecution he came as from a better world a spirit of humanit=
y and toleration. His=20

toleration was politic no doubt but it was also sincere. So novel was it th=
at a monk finding himself=20

not butchered=20


_
matter how tired she was. She was very fond of her children and did not sha=
re the attitude of many=20

slave mother who thought of their children as belonging solely to the maste=
rs. She lived in=20

constant fear that "old marse Seever" would meet with some adversity and be=
 forced to sell them=20

separately. She always whispered to them about "de war" and fanned to a fla=
me their desire to be=20

free.  At that time Negro children listened to the tales of _Raw Head and B=
loody Bones_, various=20

animal stories and such childish ditties as:    "Little Boy, Little Boy who=
 made your breeches?=20

Mamma cut 'em out and pappa sewed de stitches."  Children were told that ba=
bies were dug out of=20

tree stumps and were generally made to "shut up" if they questioned their e=
lders about such=20

matters.  Children with long or large heads were thought to be marked to be=
come "wise men."=20

Everyone believed in and attempted his conversion. His zeal was repaid with=
 a gracious smile.=20

Once more on the Lech Tilly crossed the path of the thunderbolt. Dishonoure=
d at Magdeburg,=20

defeated at Leipsic, the old man seems to have been weary of life, his leg =
shattered by a cannon=20

hall he was borne dying from the field and left the Imperial cause headless=
 as well as beaten.=20

Gustavus is in Augsburgh, the queen of German commerce, the city of the Fug=
gers with their=20

splendid and romantic money kingdom, the city of the Confession. He is in M=
unich, the capital of=20

Maximilian and the Catholic League. His allies the Saxons are in Prague. A =
few marches more=20

and he will dictate peace at Vienna with all Germany at his back. A few mar=
ches more the=20

Germans will be a Protestant nation under a Protestant chief and many a dar=
k page will be torn=20

from the book of fate.  Ferdinand and Maximilian had sought=20


_
superstitions that have been handed down to the present generation. There w=
as much talk of=20

"hoodooism" and anyone ill for a long time without getting relief from herb=
 medicines was thought=20

to be "fixed" or suffering from some sin that his father had committed.  Du=
ncan was 12 years of=20

age when freedom was declared and remembers the hectic times which followed=
. He and other=20

slave children attended schools provided by the Freedmen' Aid and other soc=
ial organizations=20

fostered by Northerners. Most of the instructors were whites sent to the So=
uth for that purpose.=20

The Gaines were industrious and soon owned a prosperous farm. They seldom h=
ad any money=20

but had plenty of foodstuffs and clothing and a fairly comfortable home. Al=
l of the children secured=20

enough learning to enable them to read and write, which was regarded as ver=
y unusual in those=20

days. Slaves had been taught that their brain was inferior to the whites wh=
o owned them and for=20

this reason, many parents refused to send their children to school, thinkin=
g it a waste of time and=20

that too much learning might cause some injury to the brain of their suppos=
edly weak-minded=20

children.  Of the various changes, Duncan remembers very little, so gradual=
 did they occur in his=20

section. Water was secured from the spring or well. Perishable foodstuffs w=
ere let down into the=20

well to keep cool. had given them counsel bitter but inevitable. Dissemblin=
g their hate and fear=20

they called like trembling necromancers when they invoke the fiend upon the=
 name of power. The=20

name of Wallenstein gave new life to the Imperial cause under the very ribs=
 of death. At once he=20

stood between the Empire and destruction with an army of 50,000 men, conjur=
ed, as it were, out=20

of the earth by the spell of his influence alone. All whose trade was war c=
ame at the call of the=20

grand master of their trade. The secret of Wallenstein's ambition is buried=
 in his grave, but the=20

man himself was the prince of adventurers, the ideal chief of mercenary ban=
ds, the arch contractor=20

for the hireling's blood. His character was formed in a vast political gamb=
ling house, a world given=20

up to pillage and the strong hand, an Eldorado of confiscations. Of the lof=
ty dreamer portrayed in=20

the noble dramatic poem of Schiller, there is little trace in the intensely=
 practical character of the=20

man. A scion of a good Bohemian house, poor himself, but married to a rich =
wife, whose wealth=20

was the first step in the ladder of his marvellous fortunes, Wallenstein ha=
d amassed immense=20

domains by the purchase of confiscated estates, a traffic redeemed from mea=
nness only by the=20

vastness of the scale on which he practised it, and the loftiness of the ai=
m which he had in view.=20

Then he took=20

water; laundering was=20

done in wooden tubs, made from barrels cut in halves. Candles were used for=
 lighting and were=20

made from sheep and beef tallow. Lightwood torches were used by those not a=
ble to afford=20

candles. Stockings were knitted by the women during cold or rainy on his pr=
edecessors in that=20

trade by doubling the size of his army, on the theory, coolly avowed by him=
, that a large army=20

would subsist by its command of the country, where a small army would starv=
e. But all was=20

subservient to his towering ambition, and to a pride which has been called =
theatrical, and which=20

often wore an eccentric garb, but which his=20
