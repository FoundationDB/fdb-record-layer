dracaena marginata down in an avalanche. His hot breath scorched everything=
 about him, and Arthur began to feel faint by reason of the poison in it. B=
ut he stood quite still, waiting for the Dragon, and fingering his magic gl=
ass. It was to be a mighty experiment.  Arthur waited until the Dragon was =
only a few yards away. Then he put the glass to his eye and stared hard at =
the beast; stared, and stared, and thousands and thousands of bees that com=
e and go all day long and as they do nothing else, very soon they have a lo=
t of honey all in one place. That is what we have come for today."  Leaving=
 that great tree, they went and looked at many others. Some of the trees ha=
d big holes where bees buzzed around; most of them had no bees at all.  Bob=
by was getting impatient. "Why don't we get the honey, dracaena marginata d=

rushing up the village street nearly caught Oscar as he was climbing in at =
the window of the inn.=20

Oscar fled barely in time. But the Dragon caught and ate in one mouthful tw=
o of the merry band of=20

jesters, so that they jested no longer. Then there was a great outcry and p=
anic. But Arthur slept=20

soundly through it all, dreaming of the Princess, and how fair she would be=
 when he had made her=20

his wife and had magicked her with the glass.  In the morning bright and ea=
rly Arthur came down=20

to table. He found the landlord and all the people white and trembling.  "O=
h, sir!" cried Mine Host in=20

a whisper. "Behold, the Dragon has descended from the mountain in the darkn=
ess and has eaten=20

two of the King's men this night. His appetite is whetted, and we hear him =
roaring afar off. It is a=20

sign that he will soon again make another descent upon us. In the name of S=
t. George, haste to=20

save us!"  Arthur listened and heard the far-off thunder of the loathly wor=
m. But he did not tremble.=20

He only drew himself up to his last inch and frowned, fingering the magic g=
lass in his wallet.  "First=20

will I breakfast," he said. "And then will I go forth to rid you of this pe=
st. Bring on the morning=20

meal."  When he had eaten heartily, even to the last crumb, Arthur arose an=
d took his butterfly-net=20

in hand.  "Farewell, noble youth!" cried Mine Host, with tears in his eyes.=
 For Arthur had paid his=20

score generously, and the landlord did not expect to see the little fellow =
again. The landlord's fair=20

daughter, Margot, stood weeping, with the corner of her apron to her eyes. =
For she admired the=20

brave lad mightily. She was a very little maid, no taller than Arthur's sho=
ulder, and he looked at her=20

kindly when he saw her weep.  "What a fair, sweet maid!" he said to himself=
. "If it were not for the=20

King's daughter, I would choose her for my Lady, and ask her to give me the=
 blue ribbon from her=20

hair to wear in my cap. But that may not be. I must win glory for the King'=
s big daughter."  He=20

patted Margot on the head and said debonairly: "Farewell! And have a goodly=
 dinner ready against=20

my return. For I shall bring with me a Dragon's appetite."  So he spoke, je=
sting upon the terrible=20

subject. Margot wept harder than ever, and his other hearers shuddered. Som=
e of the people=20

followed him afar off. But when, nearer and nearer, they heard the Dragon's=
 roars shaking the=20

hills, they turned about and fled back to the village, leaving Arthur to go=
 his way alone.  Arthur was=20

not afraid. He strode on manfully until he came to the valley which led up =
the mountain where the=20

Dragon lived. And as he strode he whistled. Presently there was a roar and =
a rumble and a rattle,=20

day they were to go and get the honey from the bees.     OFF FOR THE HONEY =
  "Father, what is=20

honey? Have I ever eaten any?" asked Bobby Bear, as they started on their j=
ourney.  "Why,=20

certainly you have," answered his father. "Don't you remember that sweet, s=
ticky stuff you had on=20

your bread last year, when your Uncle Grumpy came to visit us?"  "Oh," said=
 Bobby, astonished,=20

"was that honey?"  "Yes, and what we are going to get today will be just as=
 nice, perhaps nicer."=20

"Father, where do we get honey? Do we dig it out of the ground? Or does it =
grow on trees?"  "Just=20

wait and see. In a little while you will know," answered Father Bear.  By n=
ow they had left their=20

cave far behind them. Bobby Bear did not feel so tired today as he did the =
morning before.=20

Perhaps he was getting used to walking.  The sun was not so hot, for there =
were some clouds in=20

the sky and a gentle breeze blew.  Soon they reached a great clover field a=
t the end of which were=20

a number of large trees. They made their way toward the tallest of these, a=
 very big tree, one that=20

it would have taken Bobby quite a little while to go around.  "Father, what=
 is that buzzing sound?"=20

asked Bobby.  His father had a twinkle in his eye as he replied: "Why, my b=
oy, that's the honey=20

growing."  This puzzled Bobby. "Honey growing, how do you mean?"  "Wait," s=
aid Father Bear,=20

"you'll see."  "Oh, my, father," called out Bobby. "Look at all the flies! =
I can count fifty hundred.=20



Look, there's another. And here come some more. Where are they all going?" =
 His father had been=20

standing watching with a smile upon his face.  "You had better give up coun=
ting. There are far too=20

many for me to try to count. No little Bobby Bear could possibly do it. Now=
, my boy, if you will look=20

up in that tree you will see a great hole. Do you see it?"  "Where?" asked =
Bobby, bending his=20

neck, so that he was looking at the very tip-top of the tree, where the bra=
nches seemed to hit the=20

clouds.  Father Bear smiled as he called out: "No, no, not there. You're lo=
oking away too high.=20

See, much lower," and he pointed to the place where the hole was.  "Oh, now=
 I see it. I didn't look=20

there. I thought you meant way up high," said Bobby Bear. "What makes the h=
ole so black, father?=20

And look, it's moving. Why, it's all flies."  "Now, my boy, I'll tell you a=
ll about the honey. Those little=20

black things up there, of which there are so many, are not flies. They are =
bees. There are=20

thousands of those bees swarming in and around that hole."  "Why, where do =
they all come from?"=20

asked the little bear, "and what are they doing up there? And where's the h=
oney? I don't see any=20

honey."  "Wait a moment and I'll tell=20


_
Arthur stopped whistling. Nearer and nearer it came, and at last, down from=
 the rocks writhed the=20

terrible Dragon himself. And he was far worse to look upon than Arthur had =
imagined.  He was as=20

big as twenty elephants, and he was green, covered with shining scales. His=
 eyes glowed like the=20

head-lights of two engines, and revolved horribly in his head. Steam and fi=
re belched from his=20

huge mouth, and he snapped his long, sharp teeth disgustingly. He was a ter=
rifying sight as he=20

writhed toward Arthur. Dreadfully he roared, lashing right and left with hi=
s tail, which uprooted the=20

trees and bushes and dislodged the rocks on either hand till they is the be=
es' home, just as the big=20

cave is our house. And every night the bees come to the hole to sleep. But =
they have been at=20

home many times in the day also.  "Haven't you ever seen the bees flying ar=
ound the flowers?=20

Perhaps you thought they were flies. Do you know what they were doing? They=
 were getting=20

honey from the flowers."  Bobby Bear was puzzled. "Honey from the flowers?"=
 he repeated. "If the=20

flowers have honey, why do we have to come all this way to get the honey? W=
hy can't we go to=20

the flowers the way the bee does and get all the honey we want?"  "If we di=
d that, my boy," his=20

father answered, "it would take us many years to fill=20
