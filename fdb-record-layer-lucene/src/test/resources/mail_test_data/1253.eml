was a bloodless battle, but many a man has won fame on a gory battle-field =
who never turned a more steadfast, unflinching gaze _
formalities, and hugged the paper as though its mere possession would obtai=
n the money it set=20

apart for her. I promised her that I would not deprive her of it; that I wo=
uld certainly aid, rather than=20

frustrate, the intentions of the father of her children. Of its contents sh=
e could know nothing=20

beyond the general statement of the deceased--that all her future protectio=
n was bound up in its=20

provisions. The will had been handed to her in a closed envelope. The wax w=
as unbroken when=20

she laid the packet before me.  How to act did not require a moment's consi=
deration on my part. It=20

was not my duty, and it was repugnant to my feelings, to place this young w=
oman at a=20

disadvantage. In finding the will I had done more than was hoped for, and a=
ll that could be=20

expected from me. I advised her at once to consult a respectable solicitor;=
 and she went with me=20

to the office of a gentleman in the neighbourhood--a total stranger to me, =
except by reputation.=20

The erring son of the deceased was cleared from suspicion; the will was pro=
ved at Doctor's=20

Commons, and the intentions of the testator were faithfully carried out.  O=
ne of the persons largely=20

interested in the residuary estate of the deceased, which formed its bulk, =
was much grieved=20

because of the depositary chosen by Mr. Franklin for the safe custody of hi=
s will. "It is not," said=20

this person, "as if he had left the creature a large sum of money. I don't =
complain of the provision=20

he has made for the unfortunate children, but he might have spared us the h=
umiliation of asking=20

her for the will. Why could he not have left that in the custody of some on=
e of the respectable=20

people to whom he has given the principal part of his fortune?"  The explan=
ation was, "Why, don't=20

you see, my dear madam, that although the creature had but a small interest=
 in the estate, that=20

interest depended entirely upon the preservation of the document. As the bu=
lk of the property was=20

distributed by the testator nearly the same as the law would of itself have=
 distributed it, he had=20

small occasion to make a will at all, except to provide for the creature an=
d her offspring. He chose=20

the safest of all places in which he could deposit it, as of course he did =
not wish it destroyed by=20

any of those respectable people, who would not have been much concerned if =
the mother and her=20

little ones had been left absolute paupers."  "Do you mean to suggest that =
either of us would have=20

destroyed the document?"  "Certainly not; but I apprehend that the deceased=
 thought it quite as=20

well to preserve you all from temptation."     THE DUKE'S MYSTERY   Little =
more than five years=20

ago, a series of robberies on a grand scale was perpetrated at the West End=
 of London. There=20

was hardly a tradesman of note who did not suffer from these depredations, =
which for a long while=20

baffled all the skill and vigilance of the police.  After a lapse of perhap=
s six months from the=20

formation of the belief that these robberies were the result of a concerted=
 action by the rascaldom=20

of the metropolis, the victims and their friends formed themselves into a c=
ommittee, and I was=20

retained to investigate the affair.  As the matter had by this time assumed=
 great importance, I=20

employed five or six assistants, and systematically went to work. The polic=
e were also on the alert,=20

and special instructions were given from Scotland Yard that they should coo=
eperate with me, or=20

practically, I may say, act under my instructions.  It would be tedious to =
relate all the disguises and=20

stratagems which I assumed and devised. It must suffice to say, that half a=
 dozen men went=20

through more variations in their appearance than the chameleon, and were ne=
arly or quite=20

ubiquitous during the investigation.  I saw that a gang had to be crushed. =
I knew that success or=20

failure was but an issue of time and money. Of the former I could give and =
get as much as the=20

associated tradesmen would pay for. Of the latter there would, I believed, =
be no stint. The parties=20

affected, and liable to be affected, by the operations of the gang, were pr=
epared to lay out all the=20



cash needful to secure the punishment of the criminals.  The job was not a =
light one. We made a=20

few mistakes, to the injury, however, of no one who had a character worth k=
eeping. We got at=20

times on wrong tracks. We were often on the heels of the thieves, and yet f=
ailed that protected=20

vast tracts of lands. Men were pressed into service whether they liked the =
work or no, and the=20

shotgun patrol was established for the protection of the safer levees from =
being cut. The upper=20

Mississippi swelled rapidly, and while not reaching a dangerous stage itsel=
f, it added enormously=20

to the peril below. Then came floods in Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, a=
nd Louisiana.  The=20

first serious trouble from the Mississippi in Arkansas occurred in Phillips=
 county, above the mouth=20

of the White River, where some five hundred people were driven from their h=
omes to the highest=20

points by the backwater, and the cattle, gaunt, wild-eyed, starving, were f=
orced to subsist on cane,=20

twigs of cotton wood and other trees felled for them. Three times the backw=
ater and heavy local=20

rains flooded this region, while the retiring flood left a deposit of mud f=
rom one to five feet in depth,=20

precluding the possibility of turning the hungry cattle upon the land for t=
wo or three weeks, and=20

rendering it impossible to raise a crop of corn or more than half a crop of=
 cotton. At Cairo, the=20

rivers were one hundred miles in width, covering fifty miles of Missouri lo=
wlands, and extending to=20

the hills in Kentucky; while Cairo itself was partially flooded. The railro=
ads in that section were=20

forced to stop, and the people fled to the hills for their lives. Steady ra=
ins fell in Arkansas, Ohio=20

and lower Missouri River valleys, and by the time these began to subside, t=
he floods in the=20

streams below had passed previous records.  The greatest danger and trouble=
 was in the valley=20

from Arkansas City southward. Heavy rains produced a break in the levee at =
that place. March 28,=20

the levees broke at two points on the eastern shore, between Arkansas City =
and Memphis,=20

Tennessee, submerging many thousands of acres of land, and sweeping southea=
stward to the=20

Yazoo River. Greenville, Mississippi, a city of 10,000, is partially protec=
ted by a high ridge through=20

the city; but there was no means of holding back the enemy in the rear. The=
 town is situated at the=20

extremity of a sharp eastward curve, and a violent storm at length aided th=
e rapid current in cutting=20

away the front defense, and the town was forced to yield. Strenuous efforts=
 to close the breaks=20

above completely failed; and all that could be done was to secure the ends =
of the crevasses to=20

prevent their widening. Cattle were herded for a time on the levees and emb=
ankments,=20

[Illustration: NEGROES MOVING OUT.]  but these gradually yielded, and the a=
nimals were=20

drowned in droves. Defenses yielded where least expected. By April 3, there=
 was two feet of water=20

in the streets of Greenville. There was nothing left but to make the best o=
f the situation. People=20

took to the upper floors, and appeals for state, national and individual ai=
d were sent out. The=20

telephone lines leading out of the city were destroyed, and communication w=
ith the outer world=20

was greatly hindered. Occasional reports of destitution and suffering came =
from Greenville, but=20

these were contradicted by meetings of leading citizens, who said, =E2=80=
=9Cthere is no destitution here=20

that home people can not relieve. If the negroes want to wait for governmen=
t rations and refuse=20

from $1.50 to $2.50 per day to work on levees, their starving arouses no sy=
mpathy. While all these=20

sensational reports of destitution are traveling about, the steamboats are =
running into Memphis=20

and Vicksburg begging for levee hands, and the native negro is sitting on t=
he levee fishing.=E2=80=9D  The=20

water swept rapidly southward, submerging almost the entire region between =
the Yazoo and=20

Mississippi. Meanwhile, the trouble in Louisiana was just beginning. The ba=
nks began caving near=20

the levee in Madison Parish Front, compelling the erection of a new levee i=
n the rear of the old=20



one. But the fight went on stubbornly for three weeks, both along the river=
 front and along the=20

bayous in the interior. Atchafalaya River was forty-five feet above low wat=
er. The contest for the=20

levees there was as bitter as along the main stream. Occasional breaks occu=
rred, but they were=20

closed or kept from spreading by the twenty thousand men who labored day an=
d night along the=20

stream between Bayou Sara and New Orleans.  Ere long it appeared that the g=
reatest danger was=20

along the Concordia and Pointe Coupee parish fronts. (A parish in Louisiana=

_
to grasp them. We were none of us faint-hearted, or lacking in patience. Ea=
ch trip only made us=20

walk the more carefully. Each blunder only made us wary. Each divergence on=
ly made us examine=20

the supposed clues with greater nicety.  One morning a police constable and=
 one of my men came=20

to me with news.  "We have a clue, sir," said police constable U 99.  "That=
's well. What is it?" I=20

observed.  "At least we think we have," said my assistant.  "I told him of =
it. I found it out," added=20

the constable.  "No, don't say that. I had most to do with it."  "How do yo=
u make that out?"  "Well,=20

how much did you what is known as a county elsewhere). Considerable appropr=
iations were=20

made, and the head of the third district levee system, Captain D. C. Kingma=
n, conducted the fight=20

on the Pointe Coupee front in person. The battle ended here in disastrous d=
efeat. The men held=20

their ground manfully till April 20, no serious breaks having then occurred=
. All that day the men=20

were compelled to work in a drenching rain storm that  [Illustration: STOCK=
 RAFT.]  was beating=20

fiercely against the already overburdened and sodden levees on the west ban=
k of the river. The=20

danger at the great Morganza bend grew excessive.=20


_
"And how much did you know when you told me of it?"  I saw that there was a=
 pretty quarrel=20

brewing between this pair of worthies, and I tried to stop it; but that was=
 not so easy a task as the=20

reader may at first be inclined to suppose. If I put a restraint on my assi=
stant for the sake of peace,=20

I might be incidentally puffing up the constable's vanity, and wantonly inj=
uring the laudable pride of=20

my own staff. If I attempted to curb the policeman, I might drive him off t=
o Scotland Yard, where=20

the clue would be followed up, and my own professional credit with the trad=
esmen injured. I must=20

put up with a little of this altercation, and endeavour to soothe the irrit=
ation of both.  The fact is,=20

that somebody--an omnibus driver, I believe--had told the police officer th=
at something he was=20

accustomed to see was "a jolly rum affair." The policeman, being on the bea=
t along which my man=20

had to cease, or at least that the wind might shift to some other quarter, =
but when the morning=20

broke there were the same leaden skies overhead, with darker masses still s=
currying to the=20

westward before a fierce easterly gale that was as fresh and strong as ever=
, and which hurled=20

storms of white-capped waves upon the rain-soaked earthworks. Bags of earth=
 and sand were=20

piled up along the levee, to prevent the waves from washing over. Wilder an=
d more furious raged=20

the storm: higher and higher beat the waves, as the day passed. =E2=80=9CIn=
 the teeth of drenching surf=20

and blinding rain, the battle with rising flood went bravely on. Sacks were=
 piled upon sacks and=20

revetments of plank and jute bagging were carried up till the superstructur=
e upon the crown of the=20

levee looked like a fair-sized levee itself. Not only the men, but even the=
 women and children=20

fought bravely for their homes in the teeth of that wild=20


_
'busman's opinion in his own vernacular. My assistant joined in the opinion=
 already expressed, and=20

went beyond it.  "It is a rum affair, as you say," observed my man. "I thin=
k," he added, "that it's a=20

clue to what we very particularly want to find out. You come up to the gove=
rnor with me to-morrow,=20

when you're off duty, and I'll introduce you. If we turn it to account, min=
d, he'll not be unhandsome.=20

He'll make it worth your while, that _I_ warrant."  They then chatted over =
the business, and I dare=20

say my assistant let the officer into the secret of our instructions far en=
ough to aid his=20

comprehension of the gravity of the effects to which this clue might lead. =
 "What, then, was this=20

clue?" I dare say asks the always impatient reader.  It was a furious storm=
.  =E2=80=9CAs Monday night=20

closed in, the situation was more gloomy than ever. The heavy leaden sky wa=
s deeply shadowed=20

by low hanging clouds of dull slaty black, driven before the fierce gale th=
at was sweeping up the=20

reach, thrashing it into long ribs of foam that every now and then broke cl=
ear over the levees all=20

along the New Texas system, and beat savagely against the great Morganza, j=
ust below them.  =E2=80=9CA=20

nightfall dark and wild with wind and storm was followed by a night black a=
nd tempestuous, and=20

still the desperate fight went on. Here and there ruddy, flaring torches st=
ruggled with the murky=20

gloom, but within their dim halos could be seen the big breakers hungrily l=
icking the tops of the=20

sodden barriers that throbbed and quivered=20


_
information I wanted, but many a real clue has not been more definite or re=
liable than that now to=20

be followed to its end. It was a little nut, which required cracking. There=
 might be in it the kernel I=20

wanted, or there might not.  With nothing like regularity of time or period=
icity, but with great=20

frequency, a shabby hack brougham might be seen about or after dusk proceed=
ing along a blow.=20

=E2=80=9CPlanters=E2=80=99 wives and daughters stood ankle-deep in mud, fil=
ling sacks and helping to lift them upon=20

the shoulders of the men who were carrying them to the levee. Two bold Creo=
les stood at one=20

weak place, though they felt the levee dissolving beneath their feet. They =
sank to their knees in=20

the mud and water, but still they stood stubbornly on the sinking dike, pil=
ing sacks in=20
