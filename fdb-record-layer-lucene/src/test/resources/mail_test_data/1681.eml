dracaena marginata the ci-devant duc de Kernogan and his exquisite daughter=
 figure among the vilest cut-throats of Nantes."  "Citizen, let me urge on =
you once more ..." came in earnest persuasive accents from that gentle voic=
e.  "Nothing!" broke in the other savagely. "To h----ll with your English s=
pies. It is the Kernogans that I want."  Yvonne, half-crazed with horror, h=
ad heard the whole of this abominable conversation wherein she had not fail=
ed to recognise the voice of Martin-Roget or Pierre-Adet, as Yes, you are r=
ight.  I have been lazy!  I _am_ lazy.  I suppose that this is punishment f=
or my sin.  But it is hard to bear, and very heavy-- is it not?--for only f=
ollowing one's nature in longing for repose.  O! why was I born?  Why was o=
ur little one born, to enjoy for so brief a time the delights of smoke, and=
 then have it denied her--except on the sly, when with her miserable father=
, who will never see her more-- perhaps."  He paused for a few minutes, and=
 then broke out again.  "Yes, dracaena marginata the ci-devant duc de Kerno=

the more gentle, insinuating voice, "until we can make sure of the English =

foolery!" interjected the other, who appeared to be in a towering passion. =
"Bring them out at once,=20
