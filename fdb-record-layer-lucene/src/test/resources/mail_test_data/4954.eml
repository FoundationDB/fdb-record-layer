retrograde movements and pauses of the stars are visible even to us.  12. If then, at this great 

distance, our human vision can discern that sight, why, pray, are we to think that the divine 

splendour of the stars can be cast into darkness? Rather will the following way of accounting for it 

prove to be correct. Heat summons and attracts everything towards itself; for instance, we see the 

fruits of the earth growing up high under the influence of heat, and that spring water is vapourised 

and drawn up to the clouds at sunrise. On the same principle, the mighty influence of the sun, with 

his rays diverging in the form of a triangle, attracts the stars which follow him, and, as it were, 

curbs and restrains those that precede, not allowing them to make progress, but obliging them to 

retrograde towards himself until he passes out into the sign that belongs to a different triangle.  13. 

Perhaps the question will be raised, why the sun by his great heat causes these detentions in the 

fifth sign from himself rather than in the second or third, which are nearer. I will therefore set forth 

what seems to be the reason. His rays diverge through the firmament in straight lines as though 

forming an equilateral triangle, that is, to the fifth sign from the sun, no more, no less. If his rays 

were diffused in circuits spreading all over the firmament, instead of in straight lines diverging so 

as to form a triangle, they would burn up all the nearer objects. This is a fact which the Greek poet 

Euripides seems to have remarked; for he says that places at a greater distance from the sun are 

in a violent heat, and that those which are nearer he keeps temperate. Thus in the play of 

Phaethon, the poet writes: [Greek: kaiei ta porro, past and what had never existed; and even the 

classical languages which he taught were in reality for him goloshes and umbrellas in which he 

sheltered himself from real life.  "'Oh, how sonorous, how beautiful is the Greek language!' he 

would say, with a sugary expression; and as though to prove his words he would screw up his 

eyes and, raising his finger, would pronounce 'Anthropos!'  "And Byelikov tried to hide his thoughts 

also in a case. The only things that were clear to his mind were government circulars and 

newspaper articles in which something was forbidden. When some proclamation prohibited the 

boys from going out in the streets after nine o'clock in the evening, or some article declared carnal 

love unlawful, it was to his mind clear and definite; it was forbidden, and that was enough. For him 

there was always a doubtful element, something vague and not fully expressed, in any sanction or 

permission. When a dramatic club or a reading-room or a tea-shop was licensed in the town, he 

would shake his head and say softly:  "It is all right, of course; it is all very nice, but I hope it won't 

lead to anything!"  "Every sort of breach of order, deviation or departure from rule, depressed him, 

though one would have thought it was no business of his. If one of his colleagues was late for 

church or if rumours reached him of some prank of the high-school boys, or one of the mistresses 

was seen late in the evening in the company of an officer, he was much disturbed, and said he 

hoped that nothing would come of it. At the teachers' meetings he simply oppressed us with his 

caution, his circumspection, and his characteristic reflection on the ill-behaviour of the young 

people in both male and female high-schools, the

14. If then, fact and reason and the evidence of an ancient poet point to this explanation, I do not 

see why we should decide otherwise than as I have written above on this subject.  Jupiter, whose 

orbit is between those of Mars and Saturn, traverses a longer course than Mars, and a shorter 

than Saturn. Likewise with the rest of these stars: the farther they are from the outermost limits of 

the  "Oh, he hoped it would not reach the ears of the authorities; oh, he hoped nothing would 

come of it; and he thought it would be a very good thing if Petrov were expelled from the second 

class and Yegorov from the fourth. And, do you know, by his sighs, his despondency, his black 

spectacles on his pale little face, a little face like a pole-cat's, you know, he crushed us all, and we

are seen to finish their courses; for those of them that have a smaller orbit often pass those that 

are higher, going under them.  15. For example, place seven ants on a wheel such as potters use, 

having made seven channels on the wheel about the centre, increasing successively in 

circumference; and suppose those ants obliged to make a circuit in these channels while the 

wheel is turned in the opposite direction. In spite of having to move in a direction contrary to that of 

the wheel, the ants must necessarily complete their journeys in marks for conduct, kept them in, 

and in the end expelled them both. He had a strange habit of visiting our lodgings. He would come 

to a teacher's, would sit down, and remain silent, as though he were carefully inspecting 

something. He would sit like this in silence for an hour or two and then go away. This he called 

'maintaining good relations with his colleagues'; and it was obvious that coming to see us and 

sitting there was tiresome to him, and that he came to see us simply because he considered it his 

duty as our colleague. We teachers
