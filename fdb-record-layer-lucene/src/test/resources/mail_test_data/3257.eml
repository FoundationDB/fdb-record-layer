dracaena marginata fortnight--and babbled for money.  SHEBA _and_ SALOME.  =
[_Laughing with delight._] Ha! ha!  THE DEAN.  It gives me the opportunity =
of meeting your demands with candor. Children, I have love for you, solicit=
ude for you, but--I have no spare cash for anybody.  [_He rises and walks g=
loomily across to the piano, on the top of which he commences to arrange hi=
s bills. In horror SALOME scrambles up from the floor, and SHEBA wriggles o=
ff the table. Simultaneously they drop on to the it. It was very different =
from Carry's tears, and even from Edith's impassioned defiance. Rintoul kne=
w perfectly well what he was about. There was no excitement to speak of in =
his steady confidence in his own power. And his father knew very well that =
there was nothing to be done. A family scandal might indeed be made: a brea=
ch in their relations,--a quarrel which would amuse the world. He might wit=
hdraw Rintoul's allowance, or refuse to increase it, but this, though vexat=
ious, dracaena marginata fortnight--and babbled for money.  SHEBA _and_ SAL=
OME.  [_Laughing with delight._] Ha! ha!  THE DEAN.  It gives me the opport=
unity of meeting your demands with candor. Children, I have love for you, s=
olicitude for you, but--I have no spare cash for anybody.  [_He rises and w=
alks gloomily across to the piano, on the top of which he commences to arra=

brown paper patterns to send to the _costumier._  SHEBA.  [_Shocked._] Oh, =
Salome, do you=20

think he quizzed them?  SALOME.  No; I sealed them up and marked outside "T=
o be opened only=20

by a lady."  SHEBA.  That's all right. I hate the plan of myself in brown p=
aper.  SALOME.  Well, of=20

course Major Tarver begged to be allowed to pay for the dresses, and I said=
 I couldn't dream of=20

permitting it, and then he said he should be most unhappy if he didn't, and=
, just as I thought he=20

was going to have his own way, [_bursting into tears_] he cheered up and sa=
id he'd yield to a lady.=20

[_Taking a large account from the envelope._] And oh! he's yielded.  SHEBA.=
  Read it! Don't spare=20

me!  SALOME.  [_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, _Costumier_ to the Quee=
n, Bow Street.=20

One gown--period French Revolution, 1798--Fifteen guineas!"  SHEBA.  [_Sink=
ing on her knees,=20

clutching the table._] Oh!  SALOME.  "Trimmings, linings, buttons, frilling=
s--Seven guineas!"=20

SHEBA.  [_Hysterically._] Yah!  SALOME.  That's mine!  SHEBA.  [_Putting he=
r fingers into her=20

ears._] Now for mine, oooh!  SALOME.  [_Reading._] "One skirt and bodice--f=
lower girl--period=20

uncertain--Ten guineas."  SHEBA.  Less than yours! What a shame!  SALOME.  =
"Trimmings,=20

linings, buttons, frillings--Five guineas! Extras, Two guineas. Total, Fort=
y pounds, nineteen. Ladies'=20

own brown paper patterns mislaid. Terms, Cash!"  [_They throw themselves in=
to each other's=20

arms._  SALOME.  Oh, Sheba!  SHEBA.  Salome! Are there forty pounds in the =
wide world?=20

SALOME.  My heart weighs twenty. What shall we do?  SHEBA.  If we were only=
 a few years older=20

I should suggest that we wrote nice notes to Papa and committed suicide.  S=
ALOME.  Brought up=20

as we have been, that's out of the question!  SHEBA.  Then let us be brave =
women and wear the=20

dresses!  SALOME.  Of course we'll do that, but--the bill!  SHEBA.  We must=
 get dear Papa in a=20

good humor and coax him to make us a present of money. He knows we haven't =
been charitable=20

in the town for ever so long.  SALOME.  Poor dear Papa! He hasn't paid our =
proper dressmaker's=20

bill yet, and I'm sure he's pressed for money.  SHEBA.  But we can't help t=
hat when _we're_=20

pressed for money--poor dear Papa!  SALOME.  Suppose poor Papa refuses to g=
ive us a=20

present?  SHEBA.  Then we must play the piano when he's at work on his Conc=
ordance--poor=20

dear Papa!  SALOME.  However, don't let us wrong poor Papa in advance. Let =
us try to think how=20

nice we shall look.  SHEBA.  Oh yes--sha'n't I!  SALOME.  Oh, I shall! And =
as for stealing out of=20

the house with Major Tarver when poor dear Papa has gone to bed, why, Geral=
d Tarver would die=20

for me!  SHEBA.  So would Nugent Darbey for me; besides I'm not old enough =
to know better.=20

SALOME.  You're not so very much younger than I, Sheba!  SHEBA.  Indeed, Sa=
lome! Then why=20

do you keep me in short skirts?  SALOME.  Why! you cruel girl! You know I c=
an't lengthen you till=20

I'm married!  [_BLORE, the butler, a venerable-looking person, with rather =
a clerical suggestion=20

about his dress, enters by the window._  BLORE.  [_Benignly._] The two sold=
ier gentlemen have=20

just rode hup, Miss Salome.  [_The girls clutch each other's hands._  SALOM=
E.  You mean Major=20

Tarver?  SHEBA.  And Mr. Darbey. They have called to inquire after poor Pap=
a.  SALOME.  Poor=20

Papa!  BLORE.  Shall I show them hin, Miss Sheba?  SHEBA.  Yes, Blore, dear=
, and hang your=20

h's on the hat-stand.  [BLORE _laughs sweetly at SHEBA and shakes his finge=
rs at her playfully._=20

BLORE.  [_Vindictively, behind their backs._] 'Ussies!  [_He goes out._  SA=
LOME.  Am I all right,=20

Sheba?  SHEBA.  Yes. Am I?  SALOME.  Yes. [_Looking out at window._] Here t=
hey are! How=20

well Gerald Tarver dismounts! Oh!  SHEBA.  He left his liver in India, didn=
't he?  SALOME.  No--

only part of it.  SHEBA.  Well--part of it.  SALOME.  And that he gave to h=
is Queen, brave fellow!=20

SHEBA.  [_Seating herself in an artificial attitude._] Where shall we be--h=
ere?  SALOME.=20



[_Running to the piano._] All right; you be admiring my voice!  SHEBA.  Oh,=
 I dare say!  SALOME.=20

Here they are, and we're doing nothing!  SHEBA.  Let's run away and then co=
me in unconsciously.=20

SALOME.  Yes--unconsciously.  [_They run off through the Library. BLORE sho=
ws in MAJOR=20

TARVER and MR. DARBEY, who are both in regimentals. MAJOR TARVER is a middl=
e-aged, tall,=20

angular officer, with a thin face, yellow complexion, and red eyes. He is a=
lternately in a state of=20

great excitement and depression. MR. DARBEY is a mere boy, but with a pompo=
us, patronizing=20

manner._  DARBEY.  The Dean's out of the way, eh!  BLORE.  Yes, sir, he his=
.  TARVER.  Eh?=20

How is the Dean? Never mind--perhaps Miss Jedd is at home?  BLORE.  Yes, si=
r, she his.=20

TARVER.  It would be discourteous to run away without asking Miss Jedd afte=
r her father.=20

DARBEY.  [_Throwing himself on the settee._] Deuced bad form!  BLORE.  The =
ladies were 'ere a=20

minute ago.  [_SALOME and SHEBA walk in together. SALOME has her arm round =
her sister's=20

waist and looks up to her with a sweet, trusting smile. They start in confu=
sion on seeing TARVER=20

and DARBEY._  SALOME.  Major Tarver.  SHEBA.  Mr. Darbey.  TARVER.  [_Takin=
g SALOME'S=20

hand eagerly._] My dear Miss Jedd!  DARBEY.  [_Rising and putting a glass t=
o his eye._] Hah yah!=20

Hah yah!  SALOME.  [_With her hand on her heart._] You quite startled us.  =
TARVER.  [_In an=20

agony of contrition._] Oh, did we?  DARBEY.  Awfully cut up to hear it.  SH=
EBA.  We never dreamt=20

of finding two visitors for Papa.  BLORE.  Why, you told me to show the gen=
tlemen hin, Miss=20

Sheba!  [_The two girls start guiltily and glare at BLORE._  SALOME.  [_Wit=
h suppressed rage_.]=20

You needn't wait, Blore!  the room, in front of a great window, turned to h=
im with a little tremulous=20

cry of wonder and confusion, is it necessary to describe their feelings? Jo=
hn took her hands into=20

both of his without any further preliminaries, saying, "At last!" with an e=
motion and delight so=20

profound that it brought the tears to his eyes. And Edith, for her part, sa=
id nothing at all--did not=20

even look at him in her agitation. There had been no direct declaration, pr=
oposal, acceptance=20

between them. There was nothing of the kind now. Amid all the excitements a=
nd anxieties of the=20

past weeks, these prefaces of sentiment seemed to have been jumped over--to=
 have become=20

unnecessary. They had been long parted, and they had come together "at last=
!"  It may probably=20

be thought that this was abrupt,--too little anxious and doubtful on his pa=
rt, too ready and yielding=20

on hers. But no law can be laid down in such cases, and they had a right; l=
ike other people, to their=20

own way. And then the meeting was so unexpected, he had not time to think h=
ow a lover should=20

look, nor she to remember what punctilios a lady should require. That a man=
 should go down on=20

his knees to prefer his suit had got to be old-fashioned in the time of the=
ir fathers and mothers. In=20

Edith's days, the straightforwardness of a love in which the boy and girl h=
ad first met in frank=20

equality, and afterwards the man and woman in what they considered to be ho=
nest friendship and=20

liking, was the best understood phase. They were to each other the only pos=
sible mates, the most=20

perfect companions in the world.  "I have so wanted to speak to you," he cr=
ied; "in all that has=20

happened this is what I have wanted; everything would have been bearable if=
 I could have talked it=20

over,--if I could have explained everything to _you_."  "But I understood a=
ll the time," Edith said.=20

There is something to be said perhaps for this kind of love-making too.  An=
d the time flew as never=20

time flew before--as time has always flown under such circumstances; and it=
 began to grow dark=20

before they knew: for the days were creeping in, growing short, and the eve=
nings long. It need not=20

be said that they liked the darkness--it was more delightful than the fines=
t daylight; but it warned=20

them that they might be interrupted at any moment, and ought to have put th=
em on their guard.=20



Lady Lindores might come in, or even Lord Lindores, which was worse: or, sh=
ort of those=20

redoubtable personages, the servants might make a sudden invasion to close =
the windows, which=20

would be worst of all: even this fear, however, did not break the spell whi=
ch enveloped them. They=20

were at the end of the room, up against the great window, which was full of=
 the grey evening sky,=20

and formed the most dangerous background in the world to a group of two fig=
ures very close=20

together, forming but one outline against the light. They might, one would =
think, have had sense=20

enough to recollect that they were thus at once made evident to whosoever s=
hould come in. But=20

they had no sense, nor even caution enough to intermit their endless talkin=
g, whispering, now and=20

then, and listen for a moment to anything which might be going on behind th=
em. When it occurred=20

to Edith to point out how dark it was getting, John had just then entered u=
pon a new chapter, and=20

found another branch of the subject upon which there were volumes to say.  =
"For look here," he=20

said, "what will your father say to me, Edith? I am neither rich nor great.=
 I am not good enough for=20

you in any way. No--no man is good enough for a girl like you--but I don't =
mean that. When I came=20

first to Dalrulzian and saw what a little place it was, I was sick with dis=
gust and disappointment. I=20

know why now--it was because it was not good enough for you. I roam all ove=
r it every day=20

thinking and thinking--it is not half good enough for her. How can I ask he=
r to go there? How can I=20

ask her father?"  "Oh how can you speak such nonsense, John. If it is good =
enough for you it is=20

good enough for me. If a room is big or little, what does that matter? And =
as for my father----"  "It is=20

your father I am afraid of," John said. "I think Lady Lindores would not mi=
nd; but your father will=20

think it is throwing you away; he will think I am not good enough to tie yo=
ur shoe--and he will be=20

quite right--quite right," cried the young man, with fervour----  "In that =
case," said a voice behind=20

them in the terrible twilight--a voice, at the sound of which their arms un=
clasped, their hands leapt=20

asunder as by an electric shock; never was anything more sharp, more acrid,=
 more incisive, than=20

the sound,--"in that case, Mr Erskine, your duty as a gentleman is very cle=
ar before you. There is=20

only one thing to do--Go! the way is clear."  "Lord Lindores!" John had mad=
e a step back in his=20

dismay, but he still stood against the light, his face turned, astonished, =
towards the shadows close=20

by him, which had approached without warning. Edith had melted and disappea=
red away into the=20

gloom, where there was another shadow apart from the one which confronted J=
ohn, catching on=20

the whiteness of its countenance all the light in the indistinct picture. A=
 sob, a quickened breathing=20

in the background, gave some consciousness of support to the unfortunate yo=
ung hero so rudely=20

awakened out of his dream, but that was all.  "Her father, at your service,=
--entertaining exactly the=20

sentiments that you have attributed to him, and only surprised that with su=
ch just views, a man=20

who calls himself a gentleman----"  "Robert!" came from behind in a voice o=
f keen remonstrance;=20

and "Father!" with a cry of indignation.  "That a man who calls himself a g=
entleman," said Lord=20

Lindores deliberately,=20


_
[_To himself._] Let 'em 'ang that on the 'atstand!  [_BLORE goes out. DARBE=
Y and SHEBA stroll=20

together into the Library._  TARVER.  [_To SALOME._] We thought we'd ride o=
ver directly after=20

parade to make the final arrangements for tonight. Have the costumes arrive=
d?  SALOME.  Yes,=20

they came yesterday in a hamper labeled "Miss Jedd, Secretary, Cast-off Clo=
thing Distribution=20

League."  TARVER.  That was my idea--came to me in the middle of the night.=
  SALOME.  Dear=20

Major Tarver, surely this terrible strain on your nerves is very, very bad =
for you with your--your----=20

TARVER.  My liver--say the word, Miss Jedd.  SALOME.  [_Drooping her head._=
] Oh, Major=20

Tarver!  TARVER.  It is frightfully injurious. Of course I'm excited now, a=
nd you see me at my best,=20

but the alternating fits of hopeless despondency are shocking to witness an=
d to endure!  SALOME.=20

Oh!  TARVER.  It's all that damned India! Oh! what have I said! You will ne=
ver forgive me.=20

SALOME.  Indeed, indeed I will!  TARVER.  Never. Oh, Miss Jedd, my forgetfu=
lness has brought=20

me--one of my--terrible attacks--of depression!  SALOME.  Major Tarver!  [_=
She leads him to a=20

chair into which he sinks in a ghastly state. DARBEY strolls in from the Li=
brary with SHEBA._=20

DARBEY.  [_To SHEBA._] Your remarks about the army are extremely compliment=
ary. On behalf=20

of the army I thank you. We fellows are not a bad sort, take us all round. =
 SHEBA.  There's a=20

grand future before you, isn't there?  DARBEY.  Well, I suppose there is if=
 I go on as I'm going=20

now.  TARVER.  [_To SALOME._] Thanks, the attack has passed. Now about to-n=
ight; at what=20

time is the house entirely quiet?  SALOME.  Poor dear Papa goes round with =
Blore at half-past=20

nine--after that all is rest and peacefulness.  TARVER.  Then if we're here=
 with the closed carriage=20

at ten--!  [_They go together into the library._  DARBEY.  [_To SHEBA._] So=
me of us army men=20

can slave too. Tarver's queer livah has thrown all the arrangements for the=
 Fancy Ball on my=20

shoulders. [_SALOME and TARVER re-enter._] Look at him--that's when he's en=
joying life!=20

TARVER.  [_Laughing convulsively._] Ha! ha! ha! ho! he! he! Good, eh, Miss =
Jedd?  SALOME.=20

But suppose dear Papa should hear us crunching down the gravel path!  TARVE=
R.  Oh!  [_He=20

sinks on to the settee with a vacant stare, his arms hanging helplessly._  =
DARBEY.  [_To=20

SHEBA._] There--now his career is a burden to him!  SHEBA.  Oh!  SALOME.  W=
ould you like a=20

glass of water, Major Tarver?  TARVER.  [_Taking SALOME'S hand._] Thank you=
, dear Miss=20

Jedd, with the least suggestion of cayenne pepper in it.  SHEBA.  [_Looking=
 out at window._] Oh,=20

Salome! Papa! Papa!  TARVER.  The Dean?  DARBEY.  The Dean!  [_They all col=
lect themselves=20

in a fluster. The two girls go to meet their father, who enters at the wind=
ow with his head bowed=20

and his hands behind his back, in deep thought. THE DEAN is a portly man of=
 about fifty, with a=20

dignified demeanor, a suave voice and persuasive manner, and a noble brow s=
urmounted by=20

silver-gray hair. BLORE follows THE DEAN, carrying some books, a small bunc=
h of flowers, and=20

an umbrella._  SALOME.  [_Tenderly._] Papa!  SHEBA.  Papsey!  [_THE DEAN ro=
uses himself,=20

discovers his children and removes his hat._  THE DEAN.  [_To SALOME._] Sal=
ome! [_To=20

SHEBA._] My toy-child! [_He draws the girls to him and embraces them, then =
sees TARVER and=20

DARBEY._] Dear me! Strangers!  TARVER _and_ Darbey.  [_Coughing uncomfortab=
ly._] H'm!=20

SALOME.  [_Reproachfully, taking his hat from him._] Papa! Major Tarver and=
 Mr. Darbey have=20

ridden over from Durnstone to ask how your cold is.  [_SHEBA takes the gold=
-rimmed pince-nez=20

which hangs upon THE DEAN'S waistcoat and places it before his eyes._  THE =
DEAN.  Dear me!=20

Major! Mr. Garvey.  SHEBA.  Mr. Darbey!  THE DEAN.  Darbey! How good of you=
! [_With his girls=20

still embracing him he extends a hand to each of the men._] My cold is bett=
er. [_BLORE goes out=20



through the Library._] Major--Mr. Garvey--these inquiries strike me as bein=
g so kind that I insist--

no, no, I _beg_ that you will share our simple dinner with us to-night at s=
ix o'clock!  TARVER.=20

[_Disconcerted._] Oh!  DARBEY.  H'm!  THE DEAN.  Let me see--Tuesday night =
is----  SALOME.=20

Leg of mutton, Papa!  THE DEAN.  Thank you. Mutton, hot.  SHEBA.  And custa=
rds, Papsey.  THE=20

DEAN.  Thank you, toy-child--custards, cold. And a welcome--warm.  TARVER. =
 [_Looking to=20

SALOME._] Well, I--ah--[_SALOME nods her head to him violently._] That is, =
certainly, Dean,=20

certainly.  DARBEY.  Delighted, my dear Dean--delighted!  [_THE DEAN gives =
DARBEY a severe=20

look, and with an important cough walks into the Library. The men and the g=
irls speak in=20

undertones._  TARVER.  [_Depressed._] Now, what will happen to-night?  SALO=
ME.  Why, don't=20

you see, as you will have to drive over to dine, you will both be here, on =
the spot, ready to take us=20

back to Durnstone?  [_THE DEAN sits at his desk in the Library._  DARBEY.  =
Of course; when=20

we're turned out we can hang about in the lane till you're ready.  TARVER. =
 Yes, but when are=20

_we_ to make our preparations? It'll take me a long time to look like Charl=
es the First!  SHEBA.=20

We can affections--what she calls her heart, I suppose--of a silly girl."  =
Before John could reply, his=20

outline against the window had again become double. Edith stood beside him,=
 erect, with her arm=20

within his. The touch filled the young man with a rapture of strength and c=
ourage. He stopped her=20

as she began to speak. "Not you, dearest, not you; I," he said: "Lord Lindo=
res, I am guilty. It is true=20

what you say, I ought to have gone away. Had I known in time, I should have=
 gone away--('Yes, it=20

would have been right:' this in an undertone to Edith, who at these words h=
ad grasped his arm=20

tighter); but such things are not done by rule. What can I do now? We love =
each other. If she is not=20

rich she would be happy with me--not great, but happy; that's something! an=
d near home, Lord=20

Lindores! I don't stand upon any right I had to speak to her--perhaps I had=
n't any right--I beg your=20

pardon heartily, and I don't blame you for being angry."  Perhaps it was no=
t wonderful that the=20

father thus addressed, with his wife murmuring remonstrance behind him, and=
 his daughter before=20

him standing up in defiance at her lover's side, should have been exasperat=
ed beyond endurance.=20

"Upon my soul!" he cried. He was not given to exclamations, but what can a =
man do? Then after a=20

pause,--"that is kind," in his usual sharp tone, "very kind; you don't blam=
e me! Perhaps with so=20

much sense at your command you will approve of me before all's done. Edith,=
 come away from=20

that man's side--this instant!" he cried, losing his temper, and stamping h=
is foot on the ground.=20

"Papa! no, oh no--I cannot. I have chosen him, and he has chosen----"  "Lea=
ve that man's side. Do=20

you hear me? leave him, or----"  "Robert! Robert! and for God's sake, Edith=
, do what your father=20

tells you. Mr Erskine, you must not defy us."  "I will not leave John, moth=
er; you would not have left=20

my father if you had been told----"  "I will have no altercation," said Lor=
d Lindores. "I have nothing=20

to say to you, Edith. Mr Erskine, I hope, will leave my house when I tell h=
im to do so."  "Certainly I=20

will,--certainly! No, Edith darling, I cannot stay,--it is not possible. We=
 don't give each other up for=20

that; but your father has the best right in his own house----"  "Oh, this i=
s insupportable. Your=20

sentiments are too fine, Mr Erskine of Dalrulzian; for a little bonnet lair=
d, your magnanimity is=20

princely. I have a right, have I, in my own----"  Here there suddenly came =
a lull upon the stormy=20

scene, far more complete than when the wind falls at sea. The angry Earl ca=
lmed down as never=20

angry billows calmed. The pair of desperate lovers stole apart in a moment;=
 the anxious, all-

beseeching mother seated herself upon the nearest chair, and said something=
 about the=20

shortening of the days. This complete cessation of all disturbance was caus=
ed by the entrance of=20



a portly figure carrying one lamp, followed by another slimmer one carrying=
 a second. The butler's=20

fine countenance was mildly illuminated by the light he carried. He gave a =
slight glance round him,=20

with a serenity which made all these excited people shrink, in his indiffer=
ent and calmly superior=20

vision. Imperturbable as a god, he proceeded to close the shutters and draw=
 the curtains. John=20

Erskine in the quiet took his leave like any ordinary guest.  The mine had =
exploded;--the mines=20

were exploding under all the ramparts. This was the night when Rintoul came=
 home from his visit;=20

and Lady Lindores looked forward to her son's composure of mind and manner,=
 and that good=20

sense which was his characteristic, and kept him in agreement with his fath=
er upon so many=20

points on which she herself was apt to take different views. It was the onl=
y comfort she could think=20

of. Edith would not appear at dinner at all; and her mother was doubly afra=
id now of the=20

explanation of Carry's sentiments which she would have to give to her husba=
nd. But Rintoul, she=20

felt with relief, would calm everything down. He would bring in a modifying=
 influence of outdoor life=20

and unexaggerated sentiment. The commonplace, though it was one of the bitt=
ernesses of her life=20

to recognise her son as its impersonification, is dearly welcome sometimes;=
 and she looked=20

forward to Rintoul's presence with the intensest relief. She gave him a hin=
t when he arrived of her=20

wishes: "Occupy your father as much as you can," she said. "He has had seve=
ral things to think=20

of; try and put them out of his head to-night."  "I think I can promise I w=
ill do that, mother," said=20

Rintoul. The tone of his voice was changed somehow. She looked at him with =
a certain=20

consternation. Was Saul also among the prophets? Had Rintoul something on h=
is mind? But he=20

bore his part at dinner like a man, and talked and told his stories of the =
world--those club=20

anecdotes which please the men. It was only after she had left the dining-r=
oom that Rintoul fell=20

silent for a little. But before his father could so much as begin to confid=
e to him what had=20

happened in the afternoon, Rintoul drew his chair close to the table, plant=
ed his elbow upon it to=20

support himself, and looked steadily into his father's face. "I should like=
 to talk to you, if you don't=20


_
SALOME.  [_To TARVER, admiringly._] Charles the First! Oh, Major!  DARBEY. =
 That was my=20

idea--Charles the Martyr, you know. Tarver's a martyr to his liver--see?  S=
HEBA.  Oh! sha'n't we=20

 DARBEY.  Regular=20

seats, all in constrained attitudes._  TARVER.  [_To THE DEAN._] We waited =
to say--good-

morning.  THE DEAN.  [_Taking his hand, abstractedly._] How kind! Good-morn=
ing!  DARBEY.=20

Six o'clock sharp, Dean?  THE DEAN.  At six, punctually. Salome, represent =
me by escorting=20

these gentlemen to the gate. [_SALOME, TARVER, and DARBEY go out. SHEBA is =
following slyly=20

when THE DEAN looks up from his papers._] Sheba!  SHEBA.  Papsey!  THE DEAN=

in a growing tendency to dislike Mr. Garvey. At dinner, Sheba, watch that I=
 carve for him fairly.=20

SHEBA.  Yes, Papsey!  [_THE DEAN turns away and sits on the settee. SHEBA, =
with her head=20

down and her hands folded, walks towards the door, and then bounds out._  T=
HE DEAN.=20

[_Turning the papers over in his hand, solemnly._] Bills! [_He rises, walks=
 thoughtfully to a chair,=20

sits and examines papers again._] Bills! [_He rises again, walks to another=
 chair, and sinks into it=20

with a groan._] Bills!  _SALOME and SHEBA re-enter._  SALOME.  [_To SHEBA, =
in a whisper._]=20

Papa's alone!  SHEBA.  A beautiful opportunity to ask for that little prese=
nt of money. Poor dear=20

Papa!  SALOME _and_ Sheba.  Poor dear Papa!  [_They link their hands togeth=
er and walk as if=20

going out through the Library._  THE DEAN.  [_Looking up._] Don't go, child=
ren!  [_He rises, the=20

girls rush to him, and laughing with joy they turn him like a top, dancing =
round him._  [_Panting._]=20

Stop, children!  SHEBA.  Papsey's in a good humor!  SALOME.  [_Pinching his=
 chin._] He always=20

is!  SHEBA.  Papsey will listen to our little wants!  [_They force him into=
 a chair.     CHAPTER=20

XLVII.   The profoundest of the many wounds inflicted upon Lord Lindores, a=
t this terrible period of=20

his life, was that which he thus received at the hands of Rintoul: it was s=
o altogether unexpected,=20

so unlike anything that he had imagined of his son, so sudden, that it took=
 away his breath. For the=20

first moment he could not speak in the bitterness of his disappointment and=
 outraged expectations.=20

Rintoul had always been the strictly reasonable member of his family,--he h=
ad never given in to=20

any sentimental nonsense. His reasoning had all been upon substantial data,=
 and led to distinct=20

conclusions. He had not looked at things in any visionary way, but as they =
were contemplated by=20

the world in general. From the point of view of personal advantage and fami=
ly progress, nothing=20

could have been more judicious or sound than his opinions in respect to Car=
ry and Edith. He had=20

supported the Tinto marriage (which had on the whole turned out so well, be=
tter than could have=20

been hoped--the man, the only objectionable feature in it, being now dead a=
nd out of the way, and=20

all the substantial advantages secured) quietly but firmly. He had been ver=
y earnest about=20

Millefleurs. It was no fault of his if that arrangement had proved unsucces=
sful. In all these=20

concerns, Lord Lindores had found his son his right hand, supporting him st=
eadily. He could not=20

help reminding him of this now, after the first outburst of his wrath and m=
ortification. "You," he said=20

at length, "Rintoul! I have been prepared for folly on the part of your sis=
ters, but I have always felt I=20

had a tower of strength in you."  "There is no difference in me," said Rint=
oul,--"I should be just as=20

ready to back you up about the girls as ever I was; but if you will recolle=
ct, I never said a word=20

about myself. I consider it as our duty to look after the girls. For one th=
ing, they are not so well=20

qualified to judge for themselves. They see things all from one side. They =
don't know the world. I=20



wouldn't let them sacrifice their prospects to a bit of silly=20


_
legs, SHEBA lies on the top of the table._  THE DEAN.  Oh dear, oh dear! Yo=
ur wants are very=20

little ones. What are they, Salome? What are they, toy-child?  SALOME.  Pap=
a! Have you any=20

spare cash?  THE DEAN.  Spare cash! Playful Salome!  SHEBA.  _L--s--d,_ Pap=
sey, or _L--s,_=20

Papsey, and never mind the--_d._  THE DEAN.  Ha! ha! I am glad, really glad=
, children, that you=20

have broken through a reserve which has existed on this point for at least =
different. A man has a=20

right to please himself as to who he's going to marry, if he marries at all=
. Most fellows don't marry=20

at all--at least it's usual to say so; I don't know that it's true. If you'=
ll remember, when you spoke to=20

me of Lady Reseda, I never said anything one way or another. I have never c=
ommitted myself. It=20

has always been my determination in this respect to take my own way."  Lord=
 Lindores was=20

subdued by this calm speech.=20
