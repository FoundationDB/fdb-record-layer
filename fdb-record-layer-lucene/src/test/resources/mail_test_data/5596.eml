my dear, it's this=20

very prisoner what I 'ave called on you respectin'.  HANNAH.  Oh, then the =
honor ain't a=20

compliment to me, after all, Mr. Blore?  BLORE.  I'm killing two birds with=

that this hunfortunate man was took in our stables last night.  HANNAH.  No=
, I never ask Noah=20

nothing about Queen's business. He don't want _two_ women over him!  BLORE.=
  Then you=20

'aven't seen the miserable culprit?  HANNAH.  Lor' no. I was in bed hours w=
hen Noah brought 'im=20

'ome. I take no interest in it all. They tell us it's only a wretched poach=
er or a petty larcery we'll get=20

in St. Marvells. My poor Noah ain't never likely to have the chance of a ho=
rrid murder in a place=20

what returns a Conservative. My joint's burning.  [_Kneeling to look into t=

'Annah, suppose this case you've got 'old of now is a case what'll shake ol=
d England to its basis!=20

Suppose it means columns in the paper with Topping's name a-figurin'! Suppo=
se as family readin',=20

 population generally,=20

as a man who had been, as it were, like Dante, in hell, and came out unsing=
ed--or in prison, which=20

was nearly as bad, issuing forth in a sort of halo of innocence and sufferi=
ng. It might have been=20

possible that John Erskine or any of the gentlemen of the country-side had =
quarrelled with Tinto=20

and meant mischief; but Rolls could not have meant anything. The very momen=
t that the eyes of=20

the rural world were directed to him, it was established that accident only=
 could be the cause of=20

death, and everybody felt it necessary to testify their sympathy to the unw=
illing instrument of such=20

an event. The greatest people in the county would stop to speak to him when=
 occasion offered, to=20

show him that they thought no worse of him. Even Lord Lindores would do thi=
s; but there was one=20

exception. Rintoul was the one man who had never offered any sympathy. He t=
urned his head the=20

other way when Rolls approached him,--would not look at him when they were,=
 perforce, brought=20

into contact. While Rolls, for his part, regarded Lord Rintoul with a cool =
and cynical air of=20

observation that was infinitely galling to the object of it. "Yon lord!" he=
 said, when he spoke of him,=20

contemptuous, with a scoff always in his tone. And Rolls had grown to be a =
great authority in legal=20

matters, the only person in the neighbourhood, as was supposed, that=20
