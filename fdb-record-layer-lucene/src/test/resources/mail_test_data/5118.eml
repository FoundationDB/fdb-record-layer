How could he nip this awful thing in the bud?  He did n't see any way out o=
f it unless it were to=20

throw up his job and cut short this accumulating horror.  But at least he h=
ad a year of grace--two=20

years, four years, for that matter--before he would have to render an accou=
nting, and who could=20

tell what four years might bring forth? Surely, in that time he'd be able t=
o get out of it somehow.=20

However, he had cast the die, and no matter what came of it he would n't ba=
ck out.  If he did,=20

Honey would never believe in him again.  His little kingdom would crumble. =
 So he grinned.  "I=20

think I'll have a demi-tasse, just to celebrate."  So Honey brought in the =
demi-tasse.  Then Honey=20

took her seat again, and resting her elbows on the table, placed her chin i=

out his guilt, he=20

Now for the important discovery. When we saw Jeremiah and the woman togethe=

very much disturbed and she very determined and vicious--I desired Linton t=

background. Without flattery, I may say I am a better actor than he is, and=
, besides, I was more=20

completely disguised. My object was to discover what these two were talking=
 about. So I followed=20

them close enough to hear scraps of their conversation, but not close enoug=

observation upon myself. The first thing I heard that caused me surprise wa=
s a name--Captain=20

Ablewhite. It was the woman who gave utterance to it, and accompanying her =
mention of the=20

name were some words by no means complimentary to its owner. 'He's a damned=
 scoundrel,' said=20

the woman to Jeremiah, as I casually passed them, 'and you're another!' Now=
 a high-minded,=20

honest man would have fired up at this.=20
