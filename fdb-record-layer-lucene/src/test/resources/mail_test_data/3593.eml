shall stay here at the club awhile--it will be better all around. I am sorr=
y for the scene I made and I=20

don't want another. If you have any real explanation, send me word and I wi=
ll come. But=20

understand it has got to be real. If it is not we can't go on. I guess you =
see that."  She read it again.=20

Then glancing up at the messenger, who was plainly curious at the expressio=
n on her face, she=20

frowned at him impatiently.  "Will you wait downstairs!" she said. "It will=
 take some little time to find=20

the things my husband wants."  Rid of him, she began again and read the let=
ter with desperate=20

care. Yes, Joe was trying to be fair. To have said he was sorry for that sc=
ene was rather decent in=20

him. "Oh, yes, but he'll make another!" she thought. "Don't I know how he i=
s--all tired and nervous=20

and unstrung? If my explanation doesn't seem real he'll fly up and leave me=
, and then we'll be=20

through!" She clenched the letter and told herself that her explanation mus=
t be real. It was her one=20

chance--she must take time, and get good sensible advice. Joe had Fanny Car=
r about. That was=20

certain. She'd never leave him alone. She was busily bolstering up her side=
. And Ethel needed=20

somebody, too, on her side--right behind her. Sally Crothers--Joe's old fri=
end!  She packed Joe's=20

things and sent them to him with a little letter: "I am glad you said you w=
ere sorry, Joe, for the way=20

you acted was very unfair. You are quite right in waiting now--it is better=
 for both of us to cool=20

down. But my explanation is simple and real--as you will see. I shall send =
for you in a few days. I=20

love you, dear. I love you."  After that, she spent hours in anxious reflec=
tion. Now about Sally=20

Crothers, she thought. Should she tell her the trouble she was in? No, not =
at once. New Yorkers=20

hate trouble and always fly from it--so she must lead to it gradually. "Whe=
n she comes I've got to=20

make her like me--very much--so much she's surprised!" To begin with, looks=
--for looks did count.=20

That much of what Amy had said was true. "But what I must do is not to look=
 like her. Sally=20

Crothers detested her, and I've got to overcome all that. I must show her I=
'm quite different." For a=20

time Ethel's mind dwelt on details. It must all be so simple, yet not too s=
evere. "For Sally is gay, I=20

understand. What I want is to look halfway between Mrs. Grewe and Emily Gil=
es. Black? No. Dark=20

blue, with that old Rhinestone pin. Wave my hair? No, that's Amy again!"  B=
ut from such thoughts=20

about her dress, or her tea table, flowers, the lights in the room, her min=
d kept darting anxiously=20

off. All this was nothing! What should she say? "It's a woman of brains who=
 is coming to call. Think=20

of all she knows--and she earns her living--she has a profession of her own=
! How in the world  The=20

council must appoint an executive committee to take cognizance of and actio=
n upon all matters=20

delegated to it by the council or which may require immediate attention or =
interference between=20

the adjournment of the council and its next meeting, and all such acts shal=
l be valid only till the=20

next ensuing meeting of the council (_ib._, s. 4).  DIVISION ASSOCIATION.=
=E2=80=94In each territorial=20

division established by the act there may be established a Division Associa=
tion, of which every=20

member of the said college residing within the said territorial division sh=
all be a member (_ib._, s.=20

15).  PROFESSIONAL FEES.=E2=80=94The division association may submit to the=
 council a tariff of=20

professional fees suitable to their division, and on the said tariff receiv=
ing the approval of the=20

council, signed by the seal of the college and the signature of the preside=
nt, such tariff shall be=20

held to be a scale of reasonable charges for the division or section of a d=
ivision where the=20

members of the association making it reside (_ib._, s. 16).  REGISTRATION.=
=E2=80=94In a register kept=20

by the registrar the council is required to cause to be entered the name of=
 every person duly=20

registered and all persons who have complied with the act and the rules and=
 regulations made by=20

the council respecting the qualifications of practitioners of medicine, sur=
gery, and midwifery; and=20



those persons only whose names are inscribed in the register shall be deeme=
d to be qualified and=20

licensed to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery, except as hereinafter=
 provided (_ib._, s. 21).=20

The registrar is required to keep his register correct and to make the nece=
ssary alterations in the=20

addresses or qualifications of persons registered. And he may write to any =
registered person at his=20

address on the register, to inquire whether he has ceased to practise or ha=
s changed his=20

residence, and if no answer be returned within six months, may erase the na=
me of such person;=20

the name shall be restored on compliance with the other provisions of the a=
ct (_ib._, s. 22, as=20

amended Act 1891, c. 26, s. 9).  It is optional for the council to admit to=
 registration all such=20

persons as are duly registered in the medical register of Great Britain, or=
 otherwise authorized to=20

practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery in the United Kingdom of Great Br=
itain and Ireland, upon=20

such terms as the council may deem expedient (_ib._, s. 23 [1]).  Any perso=
n actually practising=20

medicine, surgery, or midwifery, or any of them, in Ontario prior to Januar=
y 1st, 1850, and who has=20

attended one course of lectures at any recognized medical school, on such p=
roof as the council=20

may require, is entitled to register (_ib._, s. 23 [2]).  Any person actual=
ly practising medicine,=20

surgery, or midwifery according=20


_
thinks me like Amy--there's Amy again! Oh, Amy, Amy, I don't want to hate y=
ou! You helped me=20

once, you were dear to me, and you had heaps and heaps of good points! But =
please, please stop=20

coming up in my life!  "Don't get into another panic, my dear. When she com=
es you must be=20

natural. Your natural self--that always counts. Don't try to show off what =
you haven't got. Show her=20

only what you have. Make her feel you're young and ready to learn--half mad=
 to learn! No, that=20

won't do--not mad, but keen for everything--interested in her life--in all =
she does and thinks and=20

feels." She for the six years preceding March 24th, 1874, in Ontario, may i=
n the discretion of the=20

representatives of the hom=C5=93opathic system of medicine be registered (_=
ib._, s. 23 [3]).  Any=20

person who possesses any of the qualifications described in Schedule B, dat=
ed prior to July 23d,=20

1870, on the payment of the fee, is entitled to register on producing to th=
e registrar the document=20

conferring or evidencing his qualification or qualifications, or on transmi=
tting by post to the registrar=20

information of his name and address and evidence of the qualification or qu=
alifications in respect=20
