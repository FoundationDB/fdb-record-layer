The only man who could not understand the affair, but whose suspicions, if =
he had any, took no=20

definite shape, was the agent of the company, deputy-registrar of births, d=
eaths, and marriages,=20

parish-clerk, undertaker, coal-merchant, and commission-agent. This respect=
able old gentleman=20

informed every body that there had been no house on fire in B---- for forty=
 years. He had been=20

agent for the insurance office thirty-four years himself; and, although he =
had taken in premiums=20

not less than 10,000_l._, he had never been called upon under one of those =
cases for a shilling.=20

The poor old man seemed to think, or one might judge by his manner that he =
thought, a claim of=20

3000_l._, which Messrs. Keeling and Co., of the "Temple of the Muses," woul=
d have to present,=20

would about ruin the office, and utterly destroy him as an agent. He was ve=
ry anxious, therefore, to=20

explain all about it; to show the care with which he had made an examinatio=
n of the premises; to=20

exhibit how unfortunate the contiguous position of the "Temple of the Muses=
" and the adjoining=20

premises was; to demonstrate how little he could have expected that a fire =
would have broken out=20

in that hovel; and how, if he had thought of such a thing, he must also hav=
e concluded that the=20

"Temple of the utilize their force.  It would seem, then, that a house with=
 open doors and windows=20

has a better chance of weathering a tornado, whether in respect to direct i=
mpact of wind, or to the=20

expansive force of air within, than a house which is shut up. Here, again, =
quite a number of=20

instances can be adduced of houses caught suddenly thus by tornadoes and es=
caping unhurt,=20

while houses upon either side were demolished.  But that the direct force o=
f the wind on the=20

Louisville occasion was very great is abundantly evidenced. Numerous are th=
e apparently curious=20

freaks that were noticed. A city paper, four days after the storm, containe=
d the following:  =E2=80=9CThere=20

are hundreds of the most interesting and miraculous incidents connected wit=
h the tornado,=20

showing the queerest sort of freaks of the wind. A block of iron casting, w=
eighing over one=20

hundred and fifty pounds, was blown into the second story of the Chesapeake=
, Ohio and Southern=20

Railway building, near the Union Depot. Nobody knows where it came from, an=
d the nearest=20

building from which it could have come is nearly one hundred yards away. Gr=
eat sheets of tin=20

roofing were dropped upon Dr. Barry=E2=80=99s farm near Turner=E2=80=99s St=
ation, forty miles from the city, on the=20

Short Line. In the ruins of a house on West Main street=20


_
would not have caught light before the flames could have been extinguished =
in the other building.=20

The agent made a special journey to London, in order to see the board; and =
he did see the=20

secretary, in an interview at which I was present. It was suggested by me t=
hat it could not be=20

helped, and that such things must happen. The secretary said, "Yes; he did =
was found clinging to=20

the wall. It was a large  [Illustration: ON NINTH STREET, LOUISVILLE.]  off=
ice clock, but no one in=20

the vicinity had ever seen it before, and no one knows where it came from. =
It was badly broken,=20

but the hands still pointed to 8:20 P.M. A large slab of marble was found i=
n a residence on West=20

Madison street which was never there before.=20


_
like that was, in the long-run, rather beneficial to the company than other=
wise." The agent was=20

consoled by the assurance that it might assist him in extending the operati=
ons of the company;=20

that he might hope to make up the loss in new business; and that, indeed, h=
e was entitled, when=20

estimating the results of his own business with the company, to set off aga=
inst this loss a larger=20

amount, which he had during his thirty-four years' agency remitted them.  T=
he poor old agent, who=20

could be of no use to me in my investigations, went back to B----, and unco=
nsciously did me a little=20

service by trumpeting the statements of myself and the secretary as the set=
tled conviction of the=20

company that all was right, and that its intention was to pay the claim in =
the most handsome=20

manner--all of which Mr. Keeling got to know, and was no doubt as much comf=
orted thereby as the=20

agent himself.  One party in B---- appeared likely to be over-looked--the o=
ld man and his wife who,=20

previously to the fire, sold sweetmeats and fruit, &c. next door to the "Te=
mple of the Muses." But=20

the necessities of the venerable couple drove them before the public in a r=
ather prominent shape.=20

Handbills were printed in the town, and taken round by the old gentleman to=
 the various=20

shopkeepers and other inhabitants, in which hand-bill was set forth the mel=
ancholy accident which=20

had burned his house down, destroyed his stock, and left him in beggary, as=
 he was unfortunately=20

not insured. A great deal of commisseration was excited in and beyond the t=
own, and the poor=20

couple got something like 100_l._ subscribed for them by voluntary contribu=
tions. A clergyman=20

preached a sermon in the largest dissenting chapel of B---- on the old man'=
s special behalf; and=20

the reverend gentleman drew such a pathetic description of the poor people'=
s sufferings and=20

forlorn condition, that a very tidy sum was dropped into the plates at the =
chapel-door as the=20

congregation left the sacred edifice.  The old man did not, however, set up=
 in business=20

immediately, because the house or hovel was not at once rebuilt. The owner =
of the land formed a=20

notion of erecting upon it a more elegant structure than the one which had =
been destroyed, and=20

the former tenant could not tell whether he would be able to occupy the old=
 site or not.  Messrs.=20

Keeling and Co., of the "Temple of the Muses," complained very bitterly abo=
ut the destruction of=20

their premises and stock, just as they were on the threshold of deriving th=
e advantage of their=20

invested capital and labours over the dreary season. They made a formal com=
plaint to the local=20

authorities as to the construction of the building, and contended that if s=
imilar arrangements to=20

those which prevailed in the metropolis had existed in B----, that is to sa=
y, if, for instance, proper=20

party-walls had been erected between all the edifices in the town of B----,=
 the "Temple of the=20

Muses" would not have been ignited by the fire in the adjoining hovel. In f=
act, Mr. Keeling pretty=20

extensively ventilated the grievance of his firm, although it never transpi=
red who was represented=20

by the "Co." He also, of course, commented with very legitimate warmth upon=
 the wretched=20

condition of the town fire-engine, and on the lack of means for extinguishi=
ng the flames before=20

they had acquired a hold over the premises.  It is perhaps unnecessary to s=
ay that after this fire=20

my inquiries were pursued with great vigilance, and that a careful watch wa=
s kept upon Mr.=20

Keeling and upon Mr. Cross.  I advised the company to adopt a bold course; =
but the solicitors to=20

whom this advice was directly given, in the first place, hesitated about en=
dorsing it. The secretary=20

of the company, whom I had reason to see on more than one occasion, for the=
 purpose of=20

examining the papers sent in by Messrs. Keeling and Co. when the assurance =
was effected, also=20

shared the timidity of the company's legal advisers. Still I was told to pu=
rsue my investigations,=20

and I did so.  A correspondence ensued between Mr. Keeling and the secretar=
y of the company=20



immediately after the fire. The secretary was rather wily, but Mr. Keeling =
was as acute. After some=20

parleying, and the exchange of one or two letters, the secretary, in a fit =
of impatience, told Mr.=20

hundred pounds. At Baird=E2=80=99s drug store on Market above Ninth, two bi=
rd cages with the birds were=20

blown in through the skylight. The cages were not injured, and the birds ar=
e as full of song as ever.=20

When the building occupied by Brand & Bethel, the tobacco men of Green stre=
et, went to pieces, a=20

portion of the frame-work dropped through the roof of a little cottage just=
 east of the factory. It=20

consisted of a heavy timber, to which were mortised four upright pieces of =
timber. When this came=20

through the cottage the family were sitting around the table in the dining-=
room, and the four=20

uprights simply pinned them in but did not hurt them in the least. It was o=
ne of the most wonderful=20

escapes yet heard of.=E2=80=9D  To the unexperienced reader some of these i=
tems seem almost=20

apocryphal. But when it is remembered that a tallow candle may be shot thro=
ugh a deal board, or=20

that an ox may be killed by a putty-ball fired from a gun, or that a revolv=
er loaded with water=20

instead of ball is a deadly weapon, it will not seem preposterous that a ca=
ge may be hurled=20

through a skylight without seriously discommoding the birds. The writer has=
 seen soft pine=20

shingles driven endwise through oak boards an inch thick by a Missouri torn=
ado. Other similar=20

cases might be given.  The carrying of objects to a distance depends as muc=
h on the upward=20

current as the horizontal motion. One of the simplest illustrations of the =
inevitable spiral course=20

that an upward or downward current pursues may be seen in the ordinary wash=
-bowl with hole in=20

the bottom. As soon as the plug is drawn and the water commences to  [Illus=
tration: RUINED=20

TOBACCO WAREHOUSES.]  pour out, it begins to assume a spiral course; and, l=
ong before the=20

water is out, there is a circular hole in the fluid, reaching to the bottom=
 of the basin. This last=20

illustrates also that the air is rarest at the center of the storm. Pouring=
 liquids through a funnel will=20

show the same spiral tendency. So an object borne away by a tornado rises i=
n curves much like=20

those of a hawk or eagle in flying.  Other peculiar feats of the wind were =
noticed. Some persons=20

caught by the storm, had no especial trouble in keeping on their feet; whil=
e others were knocked=20

about severely. One man was killed by having his throat cut by a piece of f=
lying glass. A frame=20

house, standing near the corner of Eighteenth and Maple, was shot full of h=
oles by flying bricks=20

from another house a hundred yards away. A lady standing in the doorway was=
 picked up by the=20

wind and hurled against a telegraph pole at a distance of sixty feet. Anoth=
er lady and her nephew,=20

at the first shock rushed into the street. They were caught up by the wind =
and hurled some=20

distance against a fence. They were found unconscious and both badly hurt. =
 A frame house on=20

Sixteenth street looked as if it had suffered bombardment. Holes were cut i=
n the weather-boarding=20

by planks evidently driven through the air endwise, and pieces several feet=
 long had penetrated=20

and stuck hard and fast.  The building of the Louisville City Railway at Tw=
elfth and Jefferson=20

streets was scooped through the middle, while the ends were left standing. =
This was, perhaps,=20

due to the explosive force of the air within, which burst out the weaker po=
rtions. In a building of=20

any considerable length, the points most easily overthrown by lateral press=
ure would naturally be=20

found in the middle portions of the longer walls.  At a stone-yard on Walnu=
t, between Thirteenth=20

and Fourteenth, the immense iron =E2=80=9Ctraveler,=E2=80=9D with its locom=
otive--the whole weighing many tons--

mounted on an elevated track and used for transferring immense blocks of st=
one from one side of=20

the yard to the other, was blown into the street and smashed to pieces, whi=
le close by, three small=20

brick buildings and one frame were left unharmed. Such cases show how the l=
arger obstacles=20



cause the storm to somewhat overleap the smaller ones, producing the =E2=80=
=9Cjumping=E2=80=9D motion=20

mentioned before. The narrow path of the storm may be judged from the fact =
that no small portion=20

of the good people of Louisville were not aware of the ruinous tempest till=
 they read of its deeds in=20

the morning papers.  The total damage done to property is estimated at $2,0=
00,000. Much the=20

heaviest loss was=20


_
that the company had their doubts about the _bona fides_ of his claim, and =
that he thought it was=20

possible it might be resisted.  On receiving this intimation from the secre=
tary, Mr. Keeling was=20

indignant, and demanded an interview with the board of directors.  The garr=
ulity of the old agent=20

had given this man confidence. He thought he saw in that, and in other circ=
umstances around him,=20

enough to warrant him in a confident belief that his crime was unsuspected.=
 Or he may have=20

argued with himself that safety lay in a bold attitude and tone. So he adop=
ted that kind of tone and=20

attitude. He was  There has been some discussion as to whether any sort of =
buildings are safe in=20

a storm: but so long as the most violent tropical cyclones leave many house=
s unhurt after a=20

protracted gale, there is little fear that the walls of our large buildings=
 may not readily be made=20

massive enough to withstand any atmospheric storms.  The chief damage done =
to business=20

houses was along Main, Jefferson and Walnut streets; the damage to dwelling=
s being greatest=20

along Broadway. The havoc on all the crossings in the limits of the tornado=
 was remarkable.  It=20

was observed that the buildings on the north sides of the=20
