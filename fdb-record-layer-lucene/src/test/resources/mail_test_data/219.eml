and of the Inquisition; Napoleon, and since his day, an "armed peace" at be=

destroyers of every description?  The Sibylline prophecy and Virgil's inspi=

unfulfilled in every point, as we see.       The fields are yellow with sof=

mbles, and dewy=20

honey shall [or may] distil from the rugged oak;   but they have not thus d=

for another interpretation. What is it? The Sibylline Prophetess spoke, as =

Prophets and Seers have spoken, though even the few such records that have =
survived are=20

rejected by Christian and infidel, and their interpretations are only allow=
ed and accepted among=20

the Initiated. The Sibyl alluded to cycles in general and to the great cycl=
e especially. Let us=20

remember how the Puranas corroborate the above, among others the _Vishnu Pu=
rana_:       When=20

the practices taught by the Vedas, and the Institutes of Law     shall have=
 nearly ceased, and the=20

close of the Kali Yuga [the     "Iron Age" of Virgil] shall be nigh, an asp=

who exists of his own spiritual nature in the character of     Brahma and e=

Vishnuyashas, an eminent Brahman of Shamballah ... endowed with     the eig=

powers. By his irresistible might he will     destroy ... all whose minds a=
re devoted to iniquity. He=20

will then     reestablish righteousness upon earth; and the minds of those =
who     live at the end of=20

the [Kali] Age shall be awakened, and shall be     as pellucid as  "Was an =
accomplice of the duke's=20

and escaped along with him."  Mazarin groaned.  "My lord," said D'Artagnan,=
 advancing toward=20

the cardinal, "it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time. I=
t may still be possible to=20

overtake the prisoner. France is large; the nearest frontier is sixty leagu=
es distant."  "And who is to=20

pursue him?" cried Mazarin.  "I, pardieu!"  "And you would arrest him?"  "W=
hy not?"  "You would=20

arrest the Duc de Beaufort, armed, in the field?"  "If your eminence should=
 order me to arrest the=20

devil, I would seize him by the horns and would bring him in."  "So would I=
," said Porthos.  "So=20

would you!" said Mazarin, looking with astonishment at those two men. "But =
the duke will not yield=20

himself without a furious battle."  "Very well," said D'Artagnan, his eyes =
aflame, "battle! It is a long=20

time since we have had a battle, eh, Porthos?"  "Battle!" cried Porthos.  "=
And you think you can=20

catch him?"  "Yes, if we are better mounted than he."  "Go then, take what =
guards you find here,=20

and pursue him."  "You command us, my lord, to do so?"  "And I sign my orde=
rs," said Mazarin,=20

taking a piece of paper and writing some lines; "Monsieur du Vallon, your b=
arony is on the back of=20

the Duc de Beaufort's horse; you have nothing to do but to overtake it. As =
for you, my dear=20

lieutenant, I promise you nothing; but if you bring him back to me, dead or=
 alive, you may ask all=20

you wish."  "To horse, Porthos!" said D'Artagnan, taking his friend by the =
hand.  "Here I am,"=20

smiled Porthos, with his sublime composure.  They descended the great stair=
case, taking with=20

them all the guards they found on their road, and crying out, "To arms! To =
arms!" and immediately=20

put spur to horse, which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed =
of the whirlwind.  "Well,=20



baron, I promise you some good exercise!" said the Gascon.  "Yes, my captai=
n."  As they went,=20

the citizens, awakened, left their doors and the street dogs followed the c=
avaliers, barking. At the=20

corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean, D'Artagnan upset a man; it was too insi=
gnificant an occurrence=20

to delay people so eager to get on. The troop continued its course as thoug=
h their steeds had=20

wings.  Alas! there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall se=
e that this apparently=20

slight incident came near=20


_
virtue of that peculiar time shall be as the seeds of human beings     [the=
 Shistha, the survivors of=20

the future cataclysm], and shall     give birth to a race who shall follow =
the laws of the Krita [or=20

Satya] Yuga [the age of purity, or the "Golden Age"]. For it is     said: "=
When the sun and moon=20

and Tishya [asterisms] and the planet     Jupiter are in one mansion the Kr=
ita Age [the Golden]=20

shall     return."(638)   The astronomical cycles of the Hindus--those taug=
ht publicly--have been=20

sufficiently well understood, but the esoteric meaning thereof, in its appl=
ication to transcendental=20

subjects connected with them,     25. An Adventure on the High Road.   The =
musketeers rode the=20

whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes, an=
d soon found=20

themselves out of the town, then in a forest and then within sight of a vil=
lage.  The horses seemed=20

to become more lively with each successive step; their nostrils reddened li=
ke glowing furnaces.=20

D'Artagnan, freely applying his spurs, was in advance of Porthos two feet a=
t the most;=20

Mousqueton followed two lengths behind; the guards were scattered according=
 to the varying=20

excellence of their respective mounts.  From the top of an eminence D'Artag=
nan perceived a=20

group of people=20


_
remained a dead-letter. The number of cycles was enormous; it ranged from t=
he Maha Yuga cycle=20

of 4,320,000 years down to the small septenary and quinquennial cycles, the=
 latter being=20

composed of the five years called respectively the Samvatsara, Parivatsara,=
 Idvatsara,=20

Anuvatsara, and Vatsara, each having secret attributes or qualities attache=
d to them.=20

Vriddhagarga gives these in a treatise, now the property of a Trans- Himala=
yan Matham (or=20

temple); and describes the relation between this quinquennial and the Briha=
spati cycle, based on=20

the conjunction of the Sun and Moon every sixtieth year: a cycle as mysteri=
ous--for national events=20

in general and those of the Aryan Hindu nation especially--as it is importa=
nt.      SECTION XL.=20

SECRET CYCLES.   The former five-year cycle comprehends sixty solar-siderea=
l months of 1800=20

days, sixty-one solar months (or 1830 days); sixty-two lunar months (or 186=
0 lunations), and sixty-

seven lunar-asterismal months (or 1809 such days).  In his _Kala Sankalita_=
, Col. Warren very=20

properly regards these years as cycles; this they are, for each year has it=
s own special importance=20

as having some bearing upon, and connection with, specified events in indiv=
idual horoscopes. He=20

writes that in the cycle of sixty there       Are contained five cycles of =
twelve years, each supposed=20

equal to     one year of the planet (Brihaspati, or Jupiter) ... I mention =
this     cycle because I found=20

it mentioned in some books, but I know of no     nation or tribe that recko=
ns time after that=20

account.(639)   The ignorance is very natural, since Col. Warren could know=
 nothing of the secret=20

cycles and their meanings. He adds:       The names of the five cycles or Y=
ugas are: ... (1)=20

Samvatsara, (2)     Parivatsara, (3) Idvatsara, (4) Anuvatsara, (5) Udravat=
sara.   The learned=20

Colonel might, however, have assured himself that there were "other nations=
" which had the same=20

secret cycle, if he had collected on the other side of the moat, in front o=
f that part of the donjon=20

which looks toward Saint Maur. He rode on, convinced that in this direction=
 he would gain=20

intelligence of the fugitive. In five minutes he had arrived at the place, =
where the guards joined=20

him, coming up one by one.  The several members of that group were much exc=
ited. They looked=20

at the cord, still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty fee=
t from the ground. Their=20

eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures. On the top of the =
wall sentinels went=20

and came with a frightened air.  A few soldiers, commanded by a sergeant, d=
rove away idlers from=20

the place where the duke had mounted his horse. D'Artagnan went straight to=
 the sergeant.  "My=20

officer," said the sergeant, "it is not permitted to stop here."  "That pro=
hibition is not for me," said=20

D'Artagnan. "Have the fugitives been pursued?"  "Yes, my officer; unfortuna=
tely, they are well=20

mounted."  "How many are there?"  "Four, and a fifth whom they carried away=
 wounded."  "Four!"=20

said D'Artagnan, looking at Porthos. "Do you hear, baron? They are only fou=
r!"  A joyous smile=20

lighted Porthos's face.  "How long a start have they?"  "Two hours and a qu=
arter, my officer."=20

"Two hours and a quarter--that is nothing; we are well mounted, are we not,=
 Porthos?"  Porthos=20

breathed a sigh; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses.  "Ver=
y good," said=20

D'Artagnan; "and now in what direction did they set out?"  "That I am forbi=
dden to tell."  D'Artagnan=20

drew from his pocket a paper. "Order of the king," he said.  "Speak to the =
governor, then."  "And=20

where is the governor?"  "In the country."  Anger mounted to D'Artagnan's f=
ace; he frowned and=20

his cheeks were colored.  "Ah, you scoundrel!" he said to the sergeant, "I =
believe you are=20

impudent to me! Wait!"  He unfolded the paper, presented it to the sergeant=
 with one hand and=20

with the other took a pistol from=20

eniably) which=20

represented the same period if multiplied by 12.(640) Near Benares there ar=
e still the relics of all=20

these cycle-records, and of astronomical instruments cut out of solid rock,=
 the everlasting records=20

of Archaic Initiation, called by Sir W. Jones (as suggested by the prudent =
Brahmans who=20

surrounded him) old "back records" or reckonings. But in Stonehenge they ex=
ist to this day.=20

Higgins says that Waltire found the barrows of tumuli surrounding this gian=
t-temple represented=20

accurately the situation and magnitude of the fixed stars, forming a comple=
te orrery or planisphere.=20

As Colebrooke found out, it is the cycle of the _Vedas_, recorded in the _J=
yotisha_, one of the=20

Vedangas, a treatise on Astronomy, which is the basis of calculation for al=
l other cycles, larger or=20

smaller;(641) and the _Vedas_ were written in characters, archaic though th=
ey be, long after those=20

natural observations, made by the aid of their gigantic mathematical and as=
tronomical instruments,=20

had been recorded by the men of the Third Race, who had received their inst=
ruction from the=20

Dhyan Chohans. Maurice speaks truly when he observes that all such       Ci=
rcular stone=20

monuments were intended as durable symbols of     astronomical cycles by  "=
Order of the king, I=20

tell you. Read and answer, or I will blow out your brains!"  The sergeant s=
aw that D'Artagnan was=20

in earnest. "The Vendomois road," he replied.  "And by what gate did they g=
o out?"  "By the Saint=20

Maur gate."  "If you are deceiving me, rascal, you will be hanged to-morrow=
."  "And if you catch up=20

with them you won't come back to hang me," murmured the sergeant.  D'Artagn=
an shrugged his=20

shoulders, made a sign to his escort and started.  "This way, gentlemen, th=
is way!" he cried,=20

directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out.  But, now t=
hat the duke had=20

escaped, the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock. =
It was necessary to=20

compel him to open it, as the sergeant had been compelled to speak, and thi=
s took another ten=20

minutes. This last obstacle having been overcome, the troop pursued their c=
ourse with their=20

accustomed ardor; but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace;=
 three of them=20

stopped after an hour's gallop, and one fell down.  D'Artagnan, who never t=
urned his head, did not=20

perceive it. Porthos told him of it in his calm manner.  "If only we two ar=
rive," said D'Artagnan, "it=20

will be enough, since the duke's troop are only four in number."  "That is =
true," said Porthos  And=20

he spurred his courser on.  At the end of=20


_
reasons, forbidding the use of letters, had no other permanent     method o=
f instructing their=20

disciples or handing down their     knowledge to posterity.   He errs only =
in the last idea. It was to=20

conceal their knowledge from profane posterity, leaving it as an heirloom o=
nly to the without=20

stopping; their legs began to tremble, and the foam they shed whitened the =
doublets of their=20

masters.  "Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathi=
ng time," said Porthos.=20

"Let us rather kill them! yes, kill them!" cried D'Artagnan; "I see fresh t=
racks; 'tis not a=20
