dracaena marginata can do it, but where such a personality comes, it is irr=

 1431. The charge against Jeanne was to be the working of magic; but the ac=

close _
less definite as we read back into the past, for over the range of a few ce=
nturies no plot is new, nor=20

does any writer seem altogether unlike the others. There is such a thing as=
 plagiarism, yet unless=20

one is a fanatic for originality, the question of plagiarism is of no great=
 importance; the world is not=20

interested, and if the author is concerned from whom the play or the plot i=
s stolen, his concern is=20

more for his property than for his art. If his work is stolen unchanged, it=
 is still as good art as it was=20

before; if the thief has mangled it, his plagiarized version will not be so=
 good as the authentic text;=20

but if by luck he has improved on what he took, it becomes his, bag and bag=
gage, so far as fame=20

is concerned. Who were the authors of those songs Burns made over into his =
masterpieces? Who=20

were those dramatists and chroniclers whom Shakespeare rewrote? The names i=
n many cases=20

can be looked up, but they are of no account. The toward women. As Michelet=
 remarks: "It was a=20

hard trial for the chivalry of the day." The age of chivalry was already go=
ne, though the name was=20

on the lips of all: chivalry, even if it could have withstood the phenomena=
l progress in the condition=20

of the lower orders of society,--have we not said that the peasant brothers=
 of Jeanne were=20

ennobled by royal letters patent?--and the invention of firearms, which ten=
ded to equalize all men=20

on the field of battle, could not have withstood the debasing influence of =
years of guerrilla warfare.=20

The knight had not only lost his physical superiority on the battlefield, b=
ut he had lost something=20

infinitely more precious--his lofty ideals. Knightly orders continued to be=
 founded, but they were=20

the amusements of dilettanti in honor and ancient custom. Furthermore, even=
 had chivalry not=20

faded from its theoretic brilliancy, it is entirely possible that Jeanne wo=
uld have been deemed=20

beyond the pale=20


_
a benefit by improving on the earlier work. What is far more important, the=
 world also feels that the=20

great writer, in improving on another man=E2=80=99s work, actually invaded =
no private rights, for the=20

material of literature is life, and life is no one=E2=80=99s private proper=
ty. After the invention of printing,=20

writers saw the possibility of financial dividends from their works, and pl=
agiarism is an aspect of=20

this financial question, but it has otherwise nothing to do with art. The w=
orld in general continues to=20

think of art in the old way, as creation rather than as business, and it qu=
ite properly cares little who=20

does the creating, or who afterward receives a money reward. What were Home=
r=E2=80=99s annual=20

earnings? Or was it really Homer? Or who besides David wrote his psalms? We=
 know instinctively=20

that these questions are trivial.  But imitation in art is often more appar=
ent than real. If a poet is in=20

touch with his age, he will write of the subjects that interest him, and ot=
her poets in touch with the=20

age will also write about what interests them, and consequently they may al=
l write of much the=20

same thing; they are not imitating each other, but they are enjoying a comm=
on pleasure, to which=20

one of them may have shown the way. We often say that the popular writer is=
 trying to catch the=20

favor of the public by giving it what it likes, and in some instances he ma=
y be calculating and his=20

motives unworthy. But it is more probable that being typical of his age, he=
 simply likes the same=20

things as his fellows. The Elizabethan Londoner liked historical plays; did=
 Shakespeare write them=20

leper was shunned, as the Jewish usurer was persecuted by mediaeval society=
, so was the witch=20

outlawed by public sentiment; and it was as a witch that the English were r=
esolved to treat the=20

deliverer of Orleans.  Confined at first in the camp at Margny, near Compie=
gne, Jeanne was=20

subsequently removed to the Chateau de Beaulieu, near Loches, the very plac=
e from which Agnes=20

Sorel took her title of Dame de Beaulieu. The Maid was removed again to Bea=
urevoir, and it is=20

pleasant to record the kindly sympathy displayed by the ladies of Jean de L=
uxembourg's family,=20

who ministered to her comfort, provided her with women's clothes, and did w=
hatever charity=20

suggested to calm her distressed mind. But nothing could reconcile Jeanne t=
o captivity; she felt=20

that she was in danger of falling into the hands of the English, and she ye=
arned for an opportunity=20

to succor Compiegne. In one of her attempted escapes she threw herself from=
 a high tower,=20

though her conscience warned her against the sin of self-destruction. Hurt =
in the fall, she was=20

unable to make good her escape, and was taken and nursed back to health by =
the ladies of=20

Luxembourg.  Meanwhile, the great ones of the earth were haggling over the =
price which should=20

be paid for their victim, and Charles VII. made no effort to save her. Jean=
 de Luxembourg sold her=20

to Philippe de Bourgogne, and he treated with the English representative. T=
his representative has=20

had heaped upon his head the contemptuous anathemas of historians, both Fre=
nch and English;=20

nor is he undeserving of the most severe phrases yet coined to express=20


_
audience, or rather did he not share the general taste? The principle here =
implied will explain why=20

any poets who have an enormous popularity will have also an enormous so-cal=
led influence. They=20

are popular because they share the people=E2=80=99s taste, and the people t=
herefore find in their work what=20

they like; but if their subject-matter is so popular, many others will be w=
riting of it too. The resulting=20

resemblance is not really an influence, or rarely is; it is a contemporary =
tendency. The poet who is=20

best in the lot will be remembered. All ran, but one receives the prize. Ho=
wever, those who came=20

in second and third are neither imitators nor plagiarists.   IV  To submit =
oneself to the impersonal=20

discipline of art is hard for the young. Few young writers are lured into t=
he profession by the=20

impossibility of being original in their craft, or by the excellent chance =
their best works have of=20

becoming anonymous with time. We can imagine them pleading for the rights o=
f their=20

personalities; what on earth did the old pagan mean by his proud _non omnis=
 moriar_, if his=20

personality was not to survive in his work? For their comfort let us add th=
at personality in art is=20

indestructible. If we have any of it, it will live. And if we mean personal=
ity when we say originality,=20

thinking of the author rather than of his subject, then we may add also tha=
t genuine personality is=20

original in spite of itself. How hard it is to tell a story twice the same =
way; how difficult to form=20

anything permanent, even habits; how impossible to get once for all into a =
rut. A dull lecture,=20

though we hear it a second time word for word, is subtly changed, for we no=
 longer hear it the first=20

time, and =E2=80=9Cafflictions induce callosities=E2=80=9D, as Sir Thomas B=
rowne said, and =E2=80=9Csorrows destroy us or=20

themselves.=E2=80=9D The record we buy have thought of the swinish suggesti=
veness of the very name--

was merely a time-serving priest whose shameless policy of intrigue had alr=
eady got him made=20

Bishop of Beauvais, and would soon, he fondly hoped, give him the archbisho=
pric of Rouen. In=20

furtherance of his ambitious projects he had become thoroughly English, and=
 fawned upon the rich=20

Cardinal Winchester; but though Winchester nominated him to the archbishopr=
ic, neither the Pope=20

nor the cathedral chapter of Rouen would consent to receive him as archbish=
op. Cauchon, as=20

Bishop of Beauvais, claimed the right to try the heretical sorceress who ha=
d been captured on the=20

borders of the diocese. In the same document in which he preferred this cla=
im he made offers, on=20

behalf of the English, to buy his victim. A king's ransom, ten thousand liv=
res in gold, was offered=20

for Jeanne, and as refusal would have involved not only the loss of this su=
m, but the loss of=20

English friendship, the Duke of Burgundy sold his captive, who was delivere=
d up to the=20

ecclesiastical authorities and the English party in November, 1430.  Under =
the barbarous customs=20

then in vogue it would not have been impossible for the English to put her =
to death under military=20

law; the inviolability of prisoners of war was by no means an established p=
rinciple among the=20

nations. But La Pucelle's death alone would not suffice; she must first be =
discredited in the eyes of=20

the world; it must be shown that the consecration of Charles VII. had been =
effected with the aid of=20

one condemned by the laws of God and of the Church, that the consecration w=
as, in fact, but an=20

impious mockery of religious rites, because a sorceress had led him to the =
altar. For this reason it=20

was determined to deliver Jeanne to the mercies of the ecclesiastical court=
s. Cauchon was rector=20

of the=20


_
itself with each repetition, till the charm is gone; even the photograph of=
 our dear ones, framed on=20

the wall, has a tendency at last to merge itself in the wall paper. Whateve=
r is repeated in our=20

consciousness becomes mechanical and unnoticed, or the edge of it is blunte=
d. To restore the=20

sharp edges of impression, to bring back the first flavor of things, is the=
 ideal of the assent of that=20

body to whatever seemed to him expedient; the representative of the Inquisi=
tion, who seemed=20

decidedly averse to having anything to do with the proceedings, was likewis=
e overawed by=20

Cauchon and by the English cardinal. All that remained to do was to constit=
ute the court and to=20

bring the accused before it for trial.  Rouen was to be the scene of the=20
