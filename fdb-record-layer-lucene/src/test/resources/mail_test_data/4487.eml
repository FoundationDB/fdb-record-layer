dracaena marginata Passchendaele and Verdun; then the ever present dark sha=

 This fine sort is at the Ivy-House at _Hoxton_, where it may be put in Pot=

me poor Woman's while to sell this Grass, in _London_, where so many fine _
that achievement. Whether our people have undergone a great psychologic cha=
nge I know not. It=20

is certain that at no time previously had they submitted willingly to be dr=
awn into service. For a=20

century and a quarter militia and volunteers were the basis of the armed po=
wer on land. During the=20

Civil War drafting meant riots. During all our prior history bounties for e=
nlistment were an accepted=20

fact.  Some of us may have looked into General Upton's great book called th=
e "Military Policy of=20

the United States." Until recently it was withheld, for some reason, from g=
eneral publication. It is=20

the basis of a later work by another author, "The Military Unpreparedness o=
f the United States,"=20

which appeared about 1916. Both exhibit in startling fashion the fundamenta=
l evils of volunteering=20

and bounties. But not until the stress of this great war did the old theori=
es give way. We had a real=20

man as Provost Marshal General, and his name is Enoch H. Crowder, and my ow=
n University=20

(Princeton) and others as well, honored themselves recently by conferring t=
he LL.D. degree on=20

him. I care not whether he evolved the draft machinery himself or whether i=
t was suggested by=20

others. Probably it was a result of both processes; at least he knew a good=
 thing when he saw it,=20

and, like other large men, was unconcerned about whose idea it was. Here wa=
s the problem:=20

several million men of age 21 to 31 to be listed, with particulars about th=
em; those available for=20

military service to be selected; from these, a certain number to be drawn b=
y lot. The system used=20

in the Civil War was hopelessly inadequate; army officers could not be spar=
ed to supervise the=20

lists; how were the names to be obtained? How recorded? How drawn?  The ori=
gin of the=20

fundamental plan was told me by General Crowder himself on the day when he =
received his=20

Princeton degree. He said that he was in his office racking his brain for a=
 method of registry that=20

would not take a year to operate, when a Congressman came in, and to him he=
 told his difficulties.=20

The interview terminated much like that of Alice in Wonderland and the Cate=
rpillar, who told her=20

how to change her height as it crawled off through the herbage. As the anon=
ymous Congressman=20

was going out through the door, he said over his shoulder: "If they can ele=
ct a President in one=20

day, they can register in one day." Let us thank God that the General had g=
ood ears, and excellent=20

communication between them and an active brain. "Elect in one day"--48 Stat=
es; each with so=20

many counties; each county having so many municipalities; each municipality=
 so many election=20

districts; civil, not military, officers for all of them; officers known to=
 and knowing the people;=20

Governors; mayors, election boards. _Why not_? Here is the machinery ready =
made, and at hand!=20

All that is needed is to get it going. Forty-eight Governors responded enth=
usiastically; all forty-eight=20

kept the great secret ready to pass it on to local officials; the result we=
 all know.  Two other things=20

were needed; the willingness of those that were of draft age to come and sa=
y so; and the=20

confidence of the public in a fair drawing. The latter was secured by the u=
se of master numbers=20

applicable to every district; the former came naturally as a result of the =
system itself. Every man of=20

draft age became qualifiedly a volunteer, and marched to the polling place,=
 saying: "Here I am=20

when wanted." To this the abolition of bounties and substitutes, the curses=
 of the old system,=20

largely contributed.  These are three of the great things for which we shou=
ld give thanks on this=20

Fourth of July: the solidarity of Americanism; the leadership of our Univer=
sities, and a practical and=20

popularly acceptable method, now a precedent for all time, of calling up th=
e man power of the=20

nation. A fourth is the resultant of them all: up quick, and take off the S=
cum as it rises, stirring them=20

every now and then: and when the Fruit is clear, they are enough. Then put =
them into Glasses,=20

and cover them with Papers.    To make _Marmalade_ of _Cornelian-Cherries._=
 From the same.=20



When your Cornelian-Cherries are full ripe, take out the Stones, and to eve=
ry Pound of Fruit, take=20

its weight of fine Sugar powder'd. Wet it with White Wine, and boil it to a=
 candy'd height; then put=20

in your Fruit, with the Juice that comes from them; then boil them very qui=
ck, and stir it often,=20

scumming it clean; and when you see it very clear, and of a good Consistenc=
e, put it into a glaz'd=20

earthen Pan; and when it is almost cold, put it into Glasses, and cover the=
m with white Paper, and=20

keep it in a dry Room. _Note_, If you let any of these sharp Fruits stand t=
o cool in your Sweet-

meat-Pans, they will take an ill taste from them.    To make _Jamm_ of _Dam=
sons._ From the=20

same.  Take Damsons, full ripe, a Gallon; pick them from the Stalks, that m=
ay happen to be about=20

them, and the Leaves that are sometimes gather'd with them: then take near =
their weight of Sugar,=20

and about a Quart of Water, and boil them well together, and put in your Da=
msons, and boil them=20

till they are tender, breaking them with a Spoon, all the while, till the w=
hole is thicken'd. Then put it=20

in Gallypots, and set it to cool; then close the Pots down with Leather.   =
 To preserve _Currans_ in=20

_Jelly._ From the same.  Take some of the large _Dutch_ red or white Curran=
s, when they are=20

ripe, and pick them from the Stalks; then, with a Pin, pick out the Stones;=
 or, you may, if you will,=20

leave them on the Stalks, if they are large Bunches, but still pick out the=
 Kernels. Then take their=20

weight in Sugar, and wet it with a little Water, and add a little Syrup of =
Raspberries to it; then boil it=20

to a Syrup, scumming it as it rises: then put in your Currans, and boil the=
m up quick, shaking them=20

often, still taking off the Scum as it rises. They will be enough done to p=
ut up, when the Syrup will=20

jelly, as you may try by putting some in a Spoon, and letting it cool. When=
 you find this, pour out all=20

into Glasses, when it has cool'd a little. If your Currans are pick'd from =
the Stalks, or if they are in=20

Bunches, then let the Syrup be half cold, and pour it into the Glasses; and=
 then put in your=20

Bunches, placing them as you would have them situated, and as it cools, the=
y will fix in their=20

several Stations; cover the Glasses then with white Paper.  _Note_, The red=
 Currans ought to be=20

done by themselves, and the white by themselves, for both together will mak=
e a disagreeable=20

Mixture.    To dry _Apricots._ From Mrs. _Walsingham_ of _Suffolk._  Chuse =
for this use, the large=20

Turkey or Roman-Apricot, almost ripe; Stone them, and pare them; then throw=
 them into cold=20

Water, with the Parings; weigh the pared Apricots, and prepare an equal wei=
ght of fine Sugar=20

powder'd; then put some of the Water the Apricots were steep'd in, to the S=
ugar, and boil them to=20

a candy'd height: you may then put in your Apricots, and boil them till the=
y are clear, and when=20

they have lain a few Days, in the Syrup, lay them upon a fine Wyre-Sieve, a=
nd dry them in a warm=20

Place. Then, when they are done, put them in oaken Boxes, with Papers betwe=
en them.    To stew=20

a Rump of _Beef._ From Mrs. _L----_  Take a small Rump of Beef, lay it in a=
 long Pan, deep=20

enough to allow your Beef to be cover'd; then put to it a Pint of Ale, a Qu=
art of Claret, half a Pint of=20

Verjuice, or the Juice of two large Lemons; and as much Water added, as wil=
l make Liquor enough=20

to cover it, a Crust of Bread burnt, an Anchovy, some bits of Lemon-Peel, a=
 bunch of sweet Herbs,=20

two large _Hertfordshire_ Turnips cut in dice, two large Onions cut in halv=
es, some Pepper and=20

Salt, a Nutmeg sliced, a few Cloves, and a=20


_
been said many times), future leaders in political life, keenly alive to th=
e real freedom of our=20

American system and determined to uphold it and to stand no nonsense about =
it. But for the=20

consciousness of our possessing this element, and but for our faith in it, =
we might well look with=20

most anxious foreboding at many troublesome and dangerous questions now upp=
ermost in our=20

national life.  For in the midst of triumph sounds the note of anxiety--man=
y discordant notes in fact.=20

Will the treaty finally be ratified? Will peace last? Will the Germans resp=
ect their promises and=20

fulfill them? Or will they, already talking again of a scrap of paper, stra=
ightway begin to prepare for=20

a fresh coup twenty-five years or so hence? Must the peace-loving peoples o=
f the world still apply=20

themselves to that most distasteful of all tasks, the invention and manufac=
ture and practice of=20

means of destroying life and property in war? And what about internal affai=
rs? Are individual=20

enterprise and talent to be smothered by rule? Is the Constitution of the U=
nited States a worn-out=20

old one-horse shay, ready to drop to pieces all at once? Is the Senate a ba=
ck number? Is the=20

peaceful rule by majority to be exchanged for Bolshevik dictatorship? Is ou=
r transportation industry=20

to be ruined by taxes and rate control at one end and cost of labor at the =
other? Should we take an=20

active part in the affairs of the Eastern hemisphere, and invite European a=
nd Asiatic powers to=20

help regulate our continent; in short should the national policy called the=
 Monroe Doctrine be=20

abolished?  These and many similar questions are pressing for solution. The=
y are not mere=20

fancies; they are not partisan issues, though many stentorian shouters proc=
laim them such; they=20

are live and vital questions which must be solved and will be solved, doubt=
less at great cost in=20

treasure and this close, and let it stew, at least, five Hours; then lay yo=
ur Beef in the Dish, and=20

pass the Liquor through a Sieve, and fill the Dish with it; garnishing with=
 Turnips, cut in Dice, boil'd=20

tender, and then fry'd in Hog's-Lard, and sliced Lemon, or you may bake you=
r Rump of Beef, if you=20

will, for it is much the same. And this way you may likewise bake or stew a=
 Leg of Beef, or an Ox-

Cheek, only break the Bones of the Leg of Beef, and take out all the Bones =
of the Ox-Cheek, and=20

take especially Care to clean it, for it requires some nicety to do it well=
.    _Pepper-Mint Water,_=20

From the same.  Take Pepper-Mint six handfuls, cut it a little, and infuse =
it two Days in six Quarts=20

of clean Spirit; then draw it off in a cold Still, marking every Bottle, as=
 it fills, with a Number, for the=20

first Bottle will be far the strongest, the second less strong, and the thi=
rd weaker than the second;=20

and so as we draw off more, they will be still weaker, till at last it beco=
mes almost insipid, and=20

somewhat sourish, but take none of that; then cover the Mouth of your Bottl=
es with Papers prick'd=20

full of Holes, and let them stand a Day or two; then pour your first Bottle=
 into a large earthen glaz'd=20

Pan; and to that the second, and then the third, and the fourth, and so on,=
 till by mixing they all=20

become of a sufficient strength; then put them in Bottles, with a Knob or t=
wo of double-refin'd Loaf-

Sugar, and cork them close. This is an incomparable pleasant Dram, tasting =
like Ice, or Snow, in=20

the Mouth, but creates a fine warmth in the Stomach, and yields a most refr=
eshing Flavour.  This=20

Sort of Mint is hard to be met with; but is lately cultivated in some Physi=
ck Gardens at _Mitcham_.=20

It must be kept well weeded, and the top of the Bed, where it grows, must, =
when we cut it, be=20

pricked up, a little, with a small Fork, or the Earth made fine=20


_
the end I have no doubt. Nothing is settled, said someone, I forget who, un=
til it is settled right. It is=20

for you and me and all of us to bear in mind that our work is only half don=
e: that our sacrifices and=20

labors and efforts during this great war that is just closed, I hope foreve=
r, are but the beginning,=20

and that we owe it to our country and our children to do what we can to enc=
ourage sanity,=20

deliberation and temperance of thought, speech and action in all classes of=
 the people.  Mild as=20

that sounds, it is a stupendous task to perform. There rarely was a time wh=
en unthinking people=20

were not more inclined to listen to a demagogue rather than a statesman; an=
d few people think at=20

all; still fewer think straight. It is a rebellious people, saying "Prophes=
y not unto us right things,=20

speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits." It is a time of epithets ra=
ther than of logic, of lying=20

epigrams rather than solid truths. All the wealthy, it seems, are Runners, =
of this sort of Mint, shoot=20

along upon the Surface of the Ground, and so at the Joints strike Root, whi=
ch is contrary to other=20

Sorts of Mint, which shoot their Runners under ground.    _Damson-Wine_ to =
imitate _Claret._=20

From the same.  Take nine Gallons of Water, make it scalding hot, and pour =
it upon six and thirty=20

Pounds of _Malaga_ Raisins well pick'd from the Stalks. The Raisins should =
be sound, or they will=20

spoil your Wine. While the Water is yet hot, put into the Liquor half a Pec=
k of Damsons full ripe,=20

and pick'd clean of the Stalks and Leaves, to each Gallon of Liquor; then s=
tir them all together in=20

the open Tub we make this Infusion in, and continue stirring them twice a D=
ay for six Days. Keep=20

this Tub cover'd with a Cloth all that time: then let it stand five or six =
Days longer, without stiring,=20

and then draw it off: and if it is not deep-colour'd enough, put a little S=
yrup of Mulberries to it, and=20

work it with a piece of White-Bread=20


_
large amounts is tainted; even the scales of justice are accused of falsity=
. Ebullitions of this kind=20

often indicate an undercurrent little suspected.  I realize that I am sayin=
g little or nothing that is=20

new, and I have no new methods or theories to offer for meeting the situati=
on. One thing is certain;=20

before we can teach other people to think clearly, we must be able to think=
 clearly ourselves; to=20

formulate and make others realize the real issues; to perceive the fallacy =
or confusion in the=20

opposing line of thought, and point it out without offense. It is a maxim a=
mong lawyers that a case=20

well stated is half argued, and nothing can be more to the point at this ti=
me. We still have real=20

statesmen; let us listen to them with attention and take care not to hurry =
too much in deciding.=20

Impulse leads to irretrievable error much oftener than does deliberation. S=
ober second thought is=20

usually the better.  But, notwithstanding this anxiety, let us rejoice in t=
he great victory of Liberty=20

over autocracy and militarism. As we look back over the last five years we =
see many a vision;=20

some dreadful nightmares, others with the seeming of the good God taking di=
rect part in the affairs=20

of men. The rape of Belgium, the miracle of the Marne, the tedious deadlock=
 in the trenches, the=20

ghastly failure at Gallipoli, the collapse of Rumania, the tragedy of Russi=
a, the debacle in Italy, the=20

spread with Yeast or Barm, in an open Vessel; and then tun it, keeping the =
Bung of the Vessel=20

open till the Wine has done singing in the Cask. Then slop it close, and le=
t it stand till it is clear,=20

which will be in two or three Months; then draw it off. Some will just give=
 their Damsons a scald in=20

the Water before they pour it on the Raisins, which is a good way.    To Cu=
re a _Lap-Dog,_ when=20

he continues drowsy some Days, and cannot eat. From the same.  If you find =
a Lap-Dog to be=20

sleepy, and will not take his Victuals for two or three Days; or if he eats=
, and as often discharges it=20

soon after; take a large Tea-spoon-full of Rum or Brandy, and as much Water=
, and holding his=20

Head up, and his Mouth open with one Hand, pour it down his Throat. This is=
 quantity enough for=20

one of the smallest Dogs, and will cure him in less than half an Hour; but =
as the Dogs are larger,=20

you may give to the biggest a large spoonful of Rum or Brandy equally mix'd=
 with Water, and so in=20

proportion to the size of the Dog. It is a sure Remedy.    _Dog-Grass,_ or =
_Couch-Grass,_ or=20

_Twitch-Grass,_ necessary to be had, growing in Pots in _London,_ to cure _=
Lap-Dogs,_ that are=20

sick, in the Summer. From the same.  Couch-Grass is one of the Gardener's P=
lagues, and is in=20

every Garden too much. Take a Clump of this, and set it in a large Garden-P=
ot, and letting it stand=20

as airy as possible, water it gently=20
