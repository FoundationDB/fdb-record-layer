 which ranged=20

themselves on the side of his schemes, but mere vanity and caprice fought a=
 hard battle too.  In=20

the end it was rapacity that gained the victory. An impatient exclamation f=

roused Carrier from his sombre brooding and hastened on a decision which wa=

such momentous consequences for the future of both these men.  "Introduce c=

to be there, they continued their explorations with childlike simplicity, a=

found themselves in the bedroom of Dan Davidson, where Little Bill had just=
 read himself and his=20

with a few words of welcome.  Fortunately for all parties, Okematan present=
