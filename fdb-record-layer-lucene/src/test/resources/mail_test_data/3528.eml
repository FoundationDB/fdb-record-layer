Deadwood Dick fell to the ground, blood spurting from a wound in his breast. The bullet of the 

elder Filmore had indeed struck home.  Loud then were the cries of rage and vengeance, as a 

score of masked men poured out from the thickets, and surrounded the stage.  "Shoot the 

accursed nigger!" cried one. "He's killed our leader, an' by all the saints in ther calendur he shall 

pay the penalty!"  "No! no!" yelled another, "well do no such a thing. He shall swing in mid-air!" 

"Hey!" cried a third, rising from the side of the prostrate load-agent, "don' ye be so fast, boys. The 

capt'in still lives. He is not seriously wounded even!"  A loud huzza went up from the score of 

throats, that caused a thousand echoing reverberations along the mountain side.  "Better let ther 

capt'in say what we shall do wi' yon cuss o' creashun!" suggested one who was apparently a 

leading spirit; "it's _his_ funeral, ain't it?"  "Yas, yas, it's his funeral!"  "Then let him do ther 

undertakin'."  Robber Dick was accordingly supported to a sitting posture, and the blood that 

flowed freely from his wound was stanched. In the operation his mask became loosened and 

slipped to the ground, but so quickly did he snatch it up and replace it, that no one caught even a 

glimpse of his face.  In the meantime Clarence Filmore had name, Cary William Bok.     CHAPTER 

VIII  STARTING A NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE  Edward felt that his daytime hours, spent in a 

publishing atmosphere as stenographer with Henry Holt and Company, were more in line with his 

editorial duties during the evenings.  _The Brooklyn Magazine_ was soon earning a comfortable 

income for its two young proprietors, and their backers were entirely satisfied with the way it was 

being conducted. In fact, one of these backers, Mr. Rufus T. Bush, associated with the Standard 

Oil Company, who became especially interested, thought he saw in the success of the magazine a 

possible opening for one of his sons, who was shortly to be graduated from college.  He talked to 

the publisher and editor about the idea, but the boys showed by their books that while there was a 

reasonable income for them, not wholly dependent on the magazine, there was no room for a 

third.  Mr. Bush now suggested that he buy the magazine for his son, alter its name, enlarge its 

scope, and make of it a national periodical. Arrangements were concluded, those who had 

financially backed the venture were fully paid, and the two boys received a satisfactory amount for 

their work in building up the magazine.  Mr. Bush asked Edward to suggest a name for the new 

periodical, and in the following month of May, 1887, _The Brooklyn Magazine_ became _The 

American Magazine_, with its publication office

six-shooters into the air. He had an object in doing this; he thought that the reports of fire-arms 

would reach Deadwood (which was only a short mile distant, around the bend), and arouse the 

military, who would come to his rescue.  Dick's wound dressed, he stood once more upon his feet, 

and glared up at the two men on the box. They were plainly revealed in the ghostly moonlight, and 

their features easily studied.  "Alexander Filmore!" the young great deal of money was spent on 

the new magazine, it did not succeed. Mr. Bush sold his interest in the periodical, which, once 

more changing its name, became _The Cosmopolitan Magazine_.  Since then it has passed 

through the hands of several owners, but the name has remained the same.  Before Mr. Bush sold 

_The American Magazine_ he had urged Edward to come back to it as its editor, with promise of 

financial support; but the young man felt 


_
meaning in his voice, that the cowering wretch could but understand.  "Alexander Filmore, you 

have at last come out and shown your true colors. What a treacherous, double-dyed villain you 

are! Better so; better that you should take the matter into your own hands and face the music, than 

to employ _tools_, as you have done heretofore. I can fight a dozen enemies face to face better 

than one or two lurking in the bushes."  The elder Filmore uttered a savage curse.  "You triumph 

_now!_" he growled, biting his nether lip in vexation; "but it will not always be thus."  "Eh? The 

magazine had been _The Cosmopolitan_ only a short time when the new owners, Mr. Paul J. 

Slicht and Mr. E. D. Walker, also solicited the previous editor to accept reappointment.  But 

Edward, feeling that his baby had been rechristened too often for him to father it again, declined 

the proposition.  He had not heard the last of it, however, for, by a curious coincidence, its 

subsequent owner, entirely ignorant of Edward's previous association with the magazine, invited 

him to connect himself with it.  Thus three times could Edward Bok have returned to the magazine 

for 


_
haul down the two, and bind them securely."  Accordingly, a rush was made upon the stage, and 

the two outside passengers. Down they were hauled, head over heels, and quickly secured by 

strong cords about the wrists and ankles.  This done, Deadwood Dick turned to Bill McGucken, 

who had ventured to clamber to the seat of the coach.  "Drive on, you cowardly lout--drive on. 

We've done with you for the present. But, remember, not a word of this to the population of 

Deadwood, if you intend to ever make another trip over this route. Now, go!"  Jehu needed not the 

second invitation. He never was tardy in getting out of the way of danger: so he picked up the 

reins, gave an extra hard crack of the long whip, and away rolled the jolting stage through the 

black canyon, disappearing a moment later around the bend, beyond which lay Deadwood--magic 

city of the wilderness.  Then, out from the thicket the road-agents led their horses; the two 

prisoners were secured in the saddles in front of two brawny outlaws, and without delay the 

cavalcade moved down the gorge, weirdly illuminated by the mellow rays of the soaring moon. 

*       *       *       *       *  Clarence Filmore had hoped that the report of his pistol-shots would reach 

Deadwood. If so, his wishes were fulfilled. The reports reached the barracks above Deadwood just 

as a horseman galloped up the hill--Major R----, just in from a carouse down at the "Met." 

"Halloo!" he shouted, loudly. "To horse! there is trouble in the gorge. The Sioux, under Sitting Bull, 

are upon us!"  As the major's word was law at the barracks, in very short order the  Edward was 

now without editorial cares; but he had already, even before disposing of the magazine, embarked 

on another line of endeavor.  In sending to a number of newspapers the advance sheets of a 

particularly striking "feature" in one of his numbers of _The Brooklyn Magazine_, it occurred to him 

that he was furnishing a good deal of valuable material to these papers without cost.  It is true his 

magazine was receiving the advertising value of editorial comment; but he wondered whether the 

newspapers would not be willing to pay for the privilege of simultaneous publication.  An inquiry or 

two proved that they would. Thus Edward stumbled upon the "syndicate" plan of furnishing the 

same article to a group of newspapers, one in each city, for simultaneous publication.  He looked 

over the ground, and found that while his idea was not a new one, since two "syndicate" agencies 

already existed, the field was by no means fully covered, and that the success of a third agency 

would depend entirely upon its ability to furnish the newspapers with material equally good or 

better than they received from the others.  After following the material furnished by these agencies 

for two or three weeks, Edward decided that there was plenty of room for his new ideas.  He 

discussed the matter with his former magazine partner, Colver, and suggested that if they could 

induce Mr. Beecher to write a weekly comment on current events for the newspapers it would 

make an auspicious beginning.  They decided to talk it over with the famous preacher.  For to be a 

"Plymouth boy"--that is, to go to the Plymouth Church

of sleepy soldiers swept down the gorge toward the place whence had come the firing.  Wildly 

around the abrupt bend they dashed with yells of anticipated victory: then there was a frightful 

collision between the incoming stage and the outgoing cavalry; the shrieks and screams of horses, 

the curses and yells of wounded men; and a general pandemonium ensued.  The coach, 

passengers, horses and all was upset, and went rolling down a steep embankment.  Major R---- 

was precipitated and become devoted to Henry Ward Beecher.  And the two were synonymous. 

There was no distance between Mr. Beecher and his "Plymouth boys." Each understood the other. 

The tie was that of absolute comradeship.  "I don't believe in it, boys," said Mr. Beecher when 

Edward and his friend broached the syndicate letter to him.  "No one yet ever made a cent out of 

my supposed literary work."  All the more reason, was the argument, why some one should.  Mr. 

Beecher smiled!  How well he
