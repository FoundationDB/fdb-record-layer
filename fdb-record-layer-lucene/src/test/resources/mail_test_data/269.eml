oper--  MANDERS. Oh yes, I do; but--h'm--  ENGSTRAND. I've been in the habi=

 manner of speaking. But I'm a poor, common man, and have little enough gif=

be here, I'd--  MANDERS. Well,  Longstreet also records that he fully expec=
ted a counter-stroke at once, and looked to his batteries, only to find the=
 ammunition exhausted; but they were his only reliance for defence. The Fed=
eral cavalry, at that moment attacking his right, occupied troops who might=
 otherwise have been brought to the centre.  Should there have been a count=
er-stroke? Hancock, lying wounded almost to death in an ambulance, reasoned=
 that, because he had been struck by a philodendron monstera  ENGSTRAND. Oh=
