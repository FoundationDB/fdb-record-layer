tears standing in her eyes. She held out her hands in appeal, but said nothing, while Carry, pale, 

with her eyes shining, poured forth her wrong and her passion. She stopped herself, however, with 

a violent effort. "I do not want even to think an unkind thought," she said--"now: oh no, not an 

unkind thought. It is over now--no blame, no reproach; only peace--peace. That is what I wish. I 

only admire," she cried, with a smile, "that my father should have exposed me to all that in the 

lightness of his heart and without a compunction; and then, when God has interfered--when death 

itself has sheltered and protected me--that he should step in, _par example_, in his fatherly 

anxiety, now!----"  "You must not speak so of your father, Carry," said Lady Lindores; "his ways of 

thinking may not be yours--or even mine: but if you are going to scorn and defy him, it must not be 

to me."  Carry put her mother down in her chair again with soft caressing hands, kissing her in an

rights reserved._    INTRODUCTORY NOTE.  "Dandy Dick" was the third of the farces which Mr. 

Pinero wrote for the old Court Theatre--a series of plays which, besides giving playgoers a fresh 

source of laughter, and the English stage a new order of comic play, brought plentiful prosperity to 

the joint management of Mr. Arthur Cecil and the late Mr. John Clayton. But a kind of melancholy 

interest attaches to "Dandy Dick," for this play was, as it were, the swan-song of the old theatre 

and of the Clayton and Cecil partnership; and it was the piece in which Mr. Clayton remarks 

made,--there will be gossip, and even scandal. It is so soon, not more than a month. Carry, dear, I 

think I am not hard; but you must not--indeed you must not----"  "What, mother?" said Carry, 

standing before her proudly with her head aloft. Lady Lindores gazed at her, all inspired and 

glowing, trembling with nervous energy and life. She could not put her fears, her suspicions, into 

words. She did not know what to say. What was it she wanted to say? to warn her against--what? 

There are times in which it is essential for us to be taken, as the French say, at the half word, not 

to be compelled to put our terrors or our hopes into speech. Lady Lindores could not name the 

ultimate object of her alarm. It would have been brutal. Her lips would not have framed the words.

acting when death overtook him, to the general grief.  The production of "Dandy Dick" may be 

considered as something of a _tour de force_ in its way. "The Schoolmistress" was at the end of 

its successful run, and Mr. Pinero was under contract to supply its successor by a certain date, 

when Mr. Clayton one day went down to Brighton, where the dramatist was then at work, to hear 

him read the two completed acts of the new play. To Mr. Clayton's consternation, however, Mr. 

could say.  "It is hard," Carry said, "that I should have to divine the reproach and then reply to it. I 

think that is too much, mother. I am doing nothing which I have any reason to blush for;" but as 

she said this, she did blush, and put her hands up to her cheeks to cover the flame. Perhaps this 

sign of consciousness convinced the mind which Lady Lindores only excited, for she said 

suddenly, with a tremulous tone: "I will not pretend to misunderstand you, mamma. You
