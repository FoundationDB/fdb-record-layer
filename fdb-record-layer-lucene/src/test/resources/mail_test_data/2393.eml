ple. "The first and second Georges _
compelled to serve them day and night, without rest.  They employed       e=
ven the children, as=20

soon as they could stand, in excess of their       powers.  And in this way=
 they have wasted, and to-

day still waste       those few that are left, not allowing them to have ei=
ther a home or       anything=20

of their own. In this they even surpassed the similar       injustice they =
perpetrated in Hispaniola.=20

9.9. They have exhausted and oppressed, and caused the premature death of  =
     many people in=20

this Province, making them carry planks and timber to       build vessels i=
n the port, thirty leagues=20

distant; also by sending       them to seek for honey and wax in the mounta=
ins, where they are=20

devoured by tigers; and they have loaded and do still load pregnant       a=
nd confined women, like=20

animals. 10.10. The most horrible pestilence that has principally destroyed=
 this       Province, was=20

the license which that governor gave to the Spaniards,       to ask slaves =
from the princes and=20

lords of the towns.  Every four       or five months, or whenever one obtai=
ned the favour or license=20

from       the said governor, he asked the lord for fifty slaves threatenin=
g,       if he did not give=20

them, to burn him alive or to deliver him to       fierce dogs. 11.11. As t=
he Indians usually do not=20

keep slaves and, at most a lord has       two or three or four, the lords w=
ent through their towns=20

and took,       first all the orphans; next, of those who had two children =
they       asked one, and of=20

those who had three, two: and in this way the lord       completed the numb=
er demanded by the=20

tyrant, amidst great wailing       and weeping in the town, for they seem, =
more than any other=20

people,       to love their children. 12.12. By such conduct from the year =
1523 to 1533, they ruined=20

all this       kingdom.  During six or seven years, five or six vessels car=
ried on       this traffic, taking=20

all this multitude of Indians to sell them as       slaves in Panama and Pe=
ru, where they all died.  It=20

has been       verified and experienced a thousand times that, by taking th=
e       Indians away from=20

their native country, they at once die more       easily: because the Spani=
ards habitually give them=20

little to eat and       never relieve them from labour, for they are only s=
old by some and       bought=20

by others, to make them work.  In this way they have carried       off more=
 than five hundred=20

thousand souls from this province making       slaves of people who were as=
 free as I am. 13.13. In=20

their infernal wars and the horrible captivity into which they       put th=
e Indians up to the present=20

time, the Spaniards have killed       more than another five or six hundred=
 thousand persons, and=20

they       still continue.  All these massacres have occurred in the space =
of       fourteen years.  At=20

present they kill daily in the said province of       Nicaragua, from four =
to five thousand persons,=20

with servitude and       continual oppression; it being, as was said, one o=
f the most       populous in=20

the world.                                     New Spain      1. New Spain =
was discovered in the year 1517.=20

(88) And the discoverers       gave serious offence to the Indians in that =
discovery, and committed=20

several homicides.  In the year 1518 men calling themselves       Christian=
s went there to ravage=20

and to kill; although they say that       they go to populate.  And from th=
e said year 1518, till the=20

present       day (and we are in 1542) all the iniquity, all the injustice,=
 all       the violence and=20

tyranny that the Christians have practised in the       Indies have reached=
 the limit and overflowed:=20

because they have       entirely lost all fear of God and the King, they ha=
ve forgotten       Wards,=20

the George Morlands, and the Bartolozzis demanded colour as a suitable envi=
ronment. Satinwood=20

and coloured marquetry and the painted panel accordingly found a place at t=
his moment.  The=20

amateur attempts of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, up to th=
e _furore_ of the=20

"Chinese taste" in 1750, must be disregarded as something outside the field=
 of the collector--that=20

is, if he is desirous of selecting lacquered work of excellent character. A=
s a phase of fashionable=20



caprice it is no doubt interesting, but it is to be hoped that most of thes=
e amateur efforts have=20

succumbed to the influence of time and have been destroyed. They represent =
nothing in particular=20

except a sham imitation of a great art, as stupidly offensive as was Strawb=
erry Hill, the Gothic toy=20

of Horace Walpole.  =3DThe Inn Clock.=3D--We interpolate here a short outli=
ne of a class of clocks=20

which appeals to collectors. In America they are termed "banjo clocks." A g=
ood deal has been=20

written about them, connecting them with Pitt's tax on clocks and watches i=
n 1797 of five shillings=20

on each clock per annum, which Act was repealed in the next year. It is sup=
posed that these=20

clocks suddenly came into being when private clocks were taxed, and were us=
ed in inns. Owing to=20

such a deep-seated belief they are always known throughout the country as "=
Act of Parliament"=20

clocks. But they were used earlier than the Act of 1797, and were probably =
ordinary inn clocks in=20

common use about that time. They were wall clocks varnished with black lacq=
uer, mostly plain, but=20

sometimes decorated in gold. Often the figures were in white and they had n=
o protective glass.=20

[Illustration: INN CLOCK.  Decorated in black and gold lacquer.  Maker, Joh=
n Grant (Fleet Street).=20

About 1785.  Formerly in possession of Sir Augustus Harris.  (_By courtesy =
of John R.=20

Southworth, Esq._)]  The example illustrated (p. 125) is decorated in black=
 and gold lacquer, and=20

the name on the dial is John Grant, Fleet Street, about 1785. This is rathe=
r an elaborate specimen,=20

as most of the ordinary inn clocks of this shape are innocent of these rath=
er elaborate lacquer=20

enrichments. They are to be found all over the country; we have seen one in=
 an inn at Evesham.=20

They are in Kent and the south, but do not appear to have been in common us=
e in the northern=20

counties, unless imported there later. Ale-house jests are frequent on old =
earthenware mugs--

"Drink faire, don't swear"--and broad hints as to credit. This is similarly=
 found as a standing pointed=20

jest in an "Act of Parliament" clock in a Kentish inn, minus the works, wit=
h the inscription "No Tick"-

-a jest which the most seasoned toper could readily understand.  Oliver Gol=
dsmith, when he wrote=20

his _Deserted Village_ in 1770, is said to have described in "Sweet Auburn"=
 a typical Irish village=20

in regard to its desertion, but he introduced touches reminiscent of his to=
wn habits. When he wrote=20

of the village ale-house:--      The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded fl=
oor,     The varnish'd clock=20

that click'd behind the door,  he may have been thinking of inn clocks he h=
ad seen in Fleet Street.=20

By his use of the word "varnished" it would appear that Goldsmith had in mi=
nd the ale-house clock=20

of which we are speaking. There was no other that was "varnished," that is,=
 lacquered. The term=20

"Act of Parliament" clocks must therefore be discarded; these clocks were c=
ommon inn clocks,=20

and had nothing to do with the Act levying the tax in 1797.  As a rule, ela=
borately lacquered=20

examples of such clocks should be regarded with caution by the collector. T=
he inn clock was=20

"varnished," but it had no panelled lacquer and lattice-work gold ornament.=
 It was a simple=20

hanging wall clock _sans_ artistic embellishment.     CHAPTER V=20


_
the murder and destruction, the pillage and theft, the violence and       t=
yranny throughout the=20

numerous kingdoms of the great continent,       that everything told by me =
till now is nothing=20

compared to what was       practised here.  2.2. Yet, even had we related e=
verything, including=20

what we have omitted,       it would not be comparable, either in number or=
 magnitude, to the=20

acts which, from the said year 1518 till the present day of this       year=
 1542 have been committed.=20

In this day of the month of       September the gravest and most abominable=
 acts are done and=20

committed; because the rule we have mentioned above verifies itself,       =
that from the=20

commencement onwards they have ever been increasing in       greater wicked=
ness and infernal=20

works.  THE LONG-CASE CLOCK--THE GEORGIAN PERIOD       The stability of the=
=20

"grandfather" clock--The burr-walnut      period--Thomas Chippendale--The m=
ahogany period--

Innovations of      form--The Sheraton style--Marquetry again employed in d=
ecoration.   To=20

collectors and connoisseurs the most desirable period of the long-case cloc=
k is from 1700 to about=20

1720. As we have seen in the previous chapters, this embraces the two style=
s of marquetry and=20

lacquered work, although lacquered work continued to the middle of the eigh=
teenth century. The=20

year 1720 is not an arbitrary date, but this year is a convenient one. It m=
arks the accession of the=20

first of the Four Georges and the advent of the House of Hanover. As the ti=
tle to a period of time,=20

the Georgian period is as good as any other. Just a=20


_
of the said year 1518 till the year 1530, which was twelve entire       yea=
rs, the murders and the=20

massacres lasted.  With bloody hands and       cruel swords the Spaniards c=
ontinually wrought in=20

nearly four       hundred and fifty leagues of country belonging to the Cit=
y of Mexico       and its=20

surroundings, which numbers four or five great kingdoms, as       large and=
 much more delightful=20

than Spain.  4.4. All these countries were more populous than Toledo, Sevil=
le,       Valladolid, and=20

Zaragoza, together with Barcelona; because these       cities have not, nor=
 did they ever have so=20

many inhabitants when       they were at their fullest, as God placed, and =
as are to be found in=20

all the said leagues; to go around which, one must walk more hundred years =
afterwards George III=20

died, and the Fourth George reigned only ten years, till 1830.  In regard t=
o the clock-case, the=20

century was not filled with great changes. The writers of memoirs of the ti=
me--Selwyn and=20

Walpole, Lord Hervey and Fanny Burney--furnish many sidelights on the Georg=
ian period.=20

Thackeray in his _Four Georges_ illuminated the Georgian era with more vigo=
ur than Early=20

Victorians could stand. The eighteenth century is repellent by its stupidit=
y and coarseness, by its=20

insipidity and dulness, and yet it is relieved by a continuity of extraordi=
nary forcefulness and=20

freshness of vigour, undimmed in our naval and military history, unequalled=
 in our art and letters.=20

The following names occur to prove this suggestion: Clive and=20
