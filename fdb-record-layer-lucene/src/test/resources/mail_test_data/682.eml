to stare.  "Well, not Corregidor just yet, but the Philippines--Mindanao, t=

understood.  By the time they had rounded up three stout canoes manned by h=
usky natives and=20

made their way around the end of the island, the large morning clouds had d=
ropped to water level=20

and become rain squalls.  "This is terrible!" Jack groaned. "We'll never fi=
nd him now."  "You don't=20

know these natives." Mary Brown settled back in the stern. "They can find a=
ny living thing on the=20

sea."  "It will be keen if they find Ted and his plane in this rain," said =
Stew. "That way, if his plane=20

is still afloat, we can tow it ashore and hide it in some cove without bein=
g seen by the Japs or the=20

Germans. And then! Boy! If that plane can be made to fly we'll leave your l=
ittle old island, Mary=20

Brown, and we'll take you along!"  "That sounds wonderful to me," she laugh=
ed. "I'll become the=20

mascot of your carrier, or maybe its jinx."  "I'm leaving the island in tha=
t jet plane." Jack did not=20

laugh.  "How will you manage it?" Mary asked soberly.  "Don't know yet," Ja=
ck admitted. "But you=20

wait! We'll pain or suffering, and from all sides considered infinitely pre=
ferable to the death by=20

hanging; and that so long as capital punishment for murder exists in New Yo=
rk, we need not desire=20

to change the method of punishment.=E2=80=9D These claims would seem to be =
thus far substantiated.  The=20

value of this method of execution is now beyond doubt. When properly perfor=
med it is rapid,=20

painless, and not repulsive. The criminal has probably no physical sensatio=
n of pain or discomfort=20

due to the mode of death from the moment the first shock occurs. Since the =
rapidity of the=20

transmission of the electric current through the body is in these cases muc=
h greater than the=20

rapidity of the transmission of sensation, it seems just to conclude that n=
o sensation from the=20

electricity reaches the consciousness. The only distress suffered by the cr=
iminal is the unavoidable=20

mental suffering natural to his position.  The mechanical means employed in=
 electrocution are=20

practically the same at Sing Sing, Clinton, and=20


_
way. It just has to be done!"  In a surprisingly short time Mary had her na=
tives in their canoes=20

around the end of the island and ready to undertake the search.            =
                       CHAPTER=20

XXII                             STAR OF THE MIST   For an hour, with the b=
rown natives bending their=20

stout backs to send the canoes shooting forward, they glided along through =
the mist. It was not=20

raining hard--only a fine spray coming down. They were soaked to the skin, =
but no one minded=20

that for the air was warm.  Jack really provided for the purpose, which sho=
uld be, if possible, in the=20

basement with a concrete floor: this room must be of sufficient size to adm=
it readily the criminal=20

with the attendant officers, the warden and other officials in charge or on=
 duty at the execution,=20

and the witnesses for whom seats are usually provided at a little distance =
from the criminal=E2=80=99s chair,=20

and also to allow of plenty of room for the management of the electrical ap=
paratus, and a good=20

space around the chair in which the criminal is placed. The electrical plan=

_
The war seemed unreal and far away. It was as if they had left it behind fo=
rever, and he almost=20

wished he had!  He thought of the folks at home, of his father working hard=
er than ever because=20

there was a war, of his mother doing her own work, helping the Red Cross an=
d selling bonds in a=20

booth on Saturdays. It was all very strange how a war started by a few very=
 stupid men could=20

change the lives of more than half the people in the world--strange and ter=
rible.  "Look!" Mary=20

exclaimed suddenly. an alternating-current dynamo and its accessories, plac=
ed wherever may be=20

convenient, according to the arrangements of the buildings of the instituti=
on, but connected by=20

means of wires with the switch-board in the execution-room. In the executio=
n-room also should be=20

the voltmeter, the ammeter, and such other instruments of measurement or pr=
ecision as may be=20

required. In charge of these and of the switch-board during the execution i=
s the electrical expert,=20

an official paid by the State of New=20


_
"Where?" Jack looked up.  "Not up. Over there!" she pointed.  "You wouldn't=
 see a star through the=20

mist in the daytime. You must be dreaming," Jack protested.  "But look! Loo=
k closely! It's rather=20

faint, but quite real. A white star!" She was leaning forward, straining he=
r eyes as course, arranged=20

between the execution-room and the engineer in charge of the dynamo, so tha=
t the current can be=20

produced as desired.  The chair in which the criminal is placed is made of =
stout beams of oak and=20

is securely fastened to the floor and insulated. It is perfectly plain,=20


_
vision.  "Yes," he agreed at last. "I see it."  "Star of hope," she murmure=
d. "If you'd lived on that=20

island for two years as I have, you'd know what that means."  "Two years! Y=
ou haven't been there=20

that long! It's impossible!" He stared at her in unbelief.  "Is it?" She la=
ughed. "In this war anything=20

is possible. Listen!" Her face tensed with backward a little by means of a =
special arrangement and=20

firmly fixed in the desired position. This is accomplished by means of a ba=
r of wood which is firmly=20

attached at one end to the lower portion of the back and runs forward thenc=
e parallel to the seat of=20

the chair and alongside of it; to the anterior end of this is fastened a pe=
rpendicular=20
