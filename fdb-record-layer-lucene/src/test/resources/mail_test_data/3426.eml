H. T. E.    Clyst St. George.  _Curfew_ (Vol. ii., p. 103.).--In Charleston=
, the capital of the state of=20

South Carolina, a bell is tolled twice every evening, at eight and ten o'cl=
ock in summer, and at=20

seven and nine in winter: this custom dates from early times. At the ringin=
g of the _second_ bell=20

the watch for the night is set, and our servants are prohibited from being =
abroad after that hour=20

without a permit from their masters; the first bell subserves no purpose, a=
nd is merely rung in=20

conformity to ancient usage. I am inclined to think that our ancestors had =
this bell rung in order to=20

keep up the old custom of the curfew bell of their cherished mother-country=
. It is still a custom=20

when "the first bell rings" for the younger children of the family to say "=
Good night," and retire to=20

bed. This is the only practical use to which this early ringing is put, and=
 a capital custom it is,=20

though rather distasteful to the young folks when they are anxious to sit u=
p a little longer.      H. H.=20

B.    Monte Cavallo, South Carolina.  "_Going the whole Hog_" (Vol. iii., p=

information as to the origin of the American figure of speech "to go the wh=
ole hog." I apprehend its=20

parentage belongs less to America than to Ireland, where a "hog" is still t=
he synonym for a shilling,=20

and a "tester" or "taster" for a sixpence. Previously to the assimilation o=
f the currency of the two=20

countries in 1825, a "white hog" meant the English shilling or twelve pence=
, and a "black hog" the=20

Irish shilling, of thirteen pence. To "go the whole hog" is a convivial det=
ermination _to spend the=20

whole shilling_, and the prevalence of the expression, with an extension of=
 its applications in=20

America, can be readily traced to its importation by the multitudes of emig=
rants from Ireland.      M.=20

pronounce the word =E2=80=9Cexquisite=E2=80=9D with the accent on the first=
 or the second syllable, but =E2=80=9Cchildern=E2=80=9D is=20

s one of the lessons to=20

be taught in a properly regulated house. And by this phrase, I do not mean =
respect for the=20

contents. That goes without saying. I mean respect for the proper care of t=
hose best ministers to=20

minds and souls. Children should be taught to handle books carefully, to cu=
t the leaves properly,=20

to open books without breaking the leaves apart at the back. They should be=
 instructed not to soil=20

or to mark them and to put them back in place when not in use.  The person =
who lends books may=20

keep a list of them, and it is not discourtesy if the volumes lent are not =
returned within a=20

reasonable length of time to ask for them. Many people who are quick to bor=
row are careless=20

about returning. The standard of ethics in regard to returning books is wit=
h many people as low as=20

the general standard in regard to the return of umbrellas. A book-plate is =
a great aid to the=20

possessor of a library in keeping it together. Moreover, a pretty book-plat=
e seems to give a touch=20

of individuality to one=E2=80=99s volumes. The next best thing to individua=
l bindings and tooled leather is=20

 For this reason one=20

member of the family should never inquire into another=E2=80=99s correspond=

celebrated Sir Thomas Bodley. In the very interesting "History of English T=
ranslations and=20

Translators" prefixed to Bagster's _English Hexapla_, "Mr. Burgley of Stret=
ford" is mentioned as=20

one, with this note:--    "In the Lambeth MS. it is 'Mr. Henry Burleigh.' I=
t is added, one   of that=20

name was B.D. in 1594, and D.D. in 1607."--P. 104.  Townley, however, in hi=
s _Illustrations of=20

Biblical Literature_, 1821, vol. iii. p. 293, supposes him to have been the=
 Francis Burleigh, D.D.,=20

who, according to Newcourt, became vicar of Stortford, or Bishop Stortford,=
 in 1590. See=20

_Repertorium_, vol. i. that he must share the secrets of his friendships or=
 business matters with=20

any one. He should always feel in the home that any confidences he may care=
 to give are most=20

welcome, but that such confidences are never demanded or expected.  [Sideno=

PRIVACY]  In recognizing these rights of others, one must remember that eac=
