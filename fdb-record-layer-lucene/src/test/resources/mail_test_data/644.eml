"What is the matter, Daisy?" said Jasmine: "you have quite hurt my hand; ha=

Daisy, in a sad voice. "I'll be better when I get into the omnibus with you=

Jasmine, may I sit very close to you? and may I hold your hand?"  "You poor=

Jasmine, affectionately, "you are not a bit strong yet--you must have some =

another start and a very=20

began the seaman slowly, his voice lowering with the rise of his anger,--"y=

You're skeered that the=20
