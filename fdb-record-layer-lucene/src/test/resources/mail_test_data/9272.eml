 A slight error appears to have crept into the Hebrew text, which can be ea=
sily corrected from the parallel verse at the end, and then the quiet confi=
dent words are--    "My strength! upon Thee will I wait,    For God is my f=

the truth that, "They are not all Israel which are of Israel." After a terr=
ible petition--"Be not merciful=20

to any secret plotters of evil"--there is a pause (Selah) to be filled, as =
it would appear, by some=20

chords on the harp, or the blare of the trumpets, thus giving time to dwell=
 on the previous petitions.=20

But still the thought of the foe haunts him, and he falls again to the lowe=

 would appear that the=20

watch had been kept up for more than one night. How he flings his growing s=
corn of them into the=20

sarcastic words, "They return at evening; they growl like a dog, and compas=

rounds in the city"). One sees them stealing through the darkness, like the=
 troops of vicious curs=20

that infest Eastern cities, and hears their smothered threatenings as they =
crouch in the shadow of=20

the unlighted streets. Then growing bolder, as the night deepens and sleep =
falls on the silent=20

houses: "Behold they pour out with their mouth, swords (are) in their lips,=
 for 'who hears'?" In=20

David's faith rends the heaven, and, with a daring image which is copied in=
 a much later psalm (ii.=20

4), shows God gazing on them with Divine scorn which breaks in laughter and=
 mockery. A brief=20

verse, which recurs at the end of the psalm, closes the first sceptical and=
 apathetic. I shall issue=20

an address to the free and independent electors of Dunderhead. And under th=

moment I wrote as follows:--      "PICCADILLY, _June 20, 1865_.  "GENTLEMEN=
