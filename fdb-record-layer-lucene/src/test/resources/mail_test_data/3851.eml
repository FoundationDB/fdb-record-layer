philodendron monstera  It was at this juncture that the whole controversy f=

It was decided that a fitting post for a successor while awaiting his turn-=
-particularly for one who=20

was not popular--would be the ministership to Great Britain; and Van Buren =
duly traveled to=20

London to take up the duties of this position. But when the appointment was=
 submitted to the=20

Senate, Calhoun's friends adroitly managed matters so that the Vice Preside=
nt should have the=20

satisfaction of preventing confirmation by his casting vote. "It will kill =
him, sir, kill him dead,"=20

declared the vengeful South Carolinian to a doubting friend. "He will never=
 kick, sir, never kick."=20

But no greater tactical error could have been committed. Benton showed the =
keener insight when=20

he informed the jubilant Calhoun men that they had "broken a minister," onl=
y to elect a Vice=20

President.     CHAPTER VII THE WEBSTER-HAYNE DEBATE  The United States came=
 out of her=20

second war with Great Britain a proud and fearless nation, though her recor=
d was not, on its face,=20

glorious. She went to war shockingly unprepared; the people were of divided=
 opinion, and one=20

great section was in open revolt; the military leaders were without distinc=
tion; the soldiery was=20

poorly trained and equipped; finances were disordered; the operations on la=
nd were mostly=20

failures; and the privateers, which achieved wonders in the early stages of=
 the contest, were=20

driven to cover long before the close; for the restoration of peace the nat=
ion had to thank=20

England's war weariness far more than her own successes; and the Treaty of =
Ghent did not so=20

much as mention impressment, captures, or any of the other matters mainly a=
t issue when the war=20

was begun. Peace, however, brought gratitude, enthusiasm, optimism. Defeats=
 were quickly=20

forgotten; and Jackson's victory at young man, at once the hero and the poe=
t, in his attempt to=20

pluck a beautiful rose, which he finds hedged about with thorns in a garden=
 full of marvels. In his=20

attempts to reach the rose the lover is alternately aided and hindered by v=
arious allegorical=20

personages, whose names suggest the part they play, such as Kindly Greeting=
 and Modesty and=20

Vanity and Pity. To the poet who first undertook the telling of this marvel=
lous allegory, Guillaume=20

de Lorris, woman is a superior being, almost an angel; and love is a divine=
 thing. Love is the=20

theme of his poem:          "Ce est li Romanz de la Rose         Ou l'Art d=
'Amours est toute enclose."=20

(This is the Romance of the Rose, wherein is all the art of love.) And it i=
s real love that he teaches;=20

for the God of Love himself commands the lover: "It is my wish and my comma=
nd that you centre=20

all the devotion of your heart in one place." His lover is gentle and court=
eous; we are in an=20

atmosphere not very different from that of the romances of chivalry.  When =
Jean de Meung=20

undertakes, some fifty years later, to complete the romance left unfinished=
 by Guillaume, we find=20

that woman is for him the incarnation of all vices; that love is a wicked t=
hing, the root of all evil; that=20

the art of deceiving women, not of loving them, is worth learning. Nay, the=
 utmost libertinage is=20

sanctioned; there is no such thing as fidelity in love, for it is contrary =
to the law of nature, which=20

designed _toutes pour touz et touz pour toutes_--all women for all men, and=
 all men for all women.=20

Jean de Meung has absorbed all that the most cynical libertines of antiquit=
y could teach him, and=20

to that he has added his own rancor against woman. It is Ovid's _Art of Lov=
e and Remedy of=20

Love_ revised=20


_
The dominant tone of this dawning period was nationalism. The nation was to=
 be made great and=20

rich and free; sectional interests and ambitions were to be merged in the g=
reater national purpose.=20

Congress voiced the sentiment of the day by freely laying tariffs to protec=
t newly risen=20

manufactures, by appropriating money for "internal improvements," by establ=
ishing a second=20

United States Bank, and by giving full support to the annexation of territo=
ry for the adjustment of=20

border difficulties and the extension of the country to its natural frontie=
rs.  Under the leadership of=20

John Marshall, the Supreme Court handed down an imposing series of decision=
s restricting the=20

powers of the States and throwing open the floodgates for the expansion of =
national functions and=20

activities. Statesmen of all sections put the nation first in their plans a=
nd policies as they had not=20

always done in earlier days. John C. Calhoun was destined shortly to take r=
ank as the greatest of=20

sectionalists. Nevertheless, between 1815 and 1820 he voted for protective =
tariffs, brought in a=20

great bill for internal improvements, and won from John Quincy Adams praise=
 for being "above all=20

sectional . . . prejudices more than any other statesman of this union" wit=
h whom he "had ever=20

acted."  The differences between the nationalist and state rights schools w=
ere, however, deep-

rooted--altogether too fundamental to be obliterated by even the nationaliz=
ing swing of the war=20

period; and in a brief time the old controversy of Hamilton and Jefferson w=
as renewed on the=20

former lines. The pull of political tradition and of sectional interest was=
 too strong to be resisted. In=20

the commercial and industrial East tradition and interest supported, in gen=
eral, the doctrine of=20

broad national powers; and the same was true of the West and Northwest. The=
 South, however,=20

inclined to limited national powers, large functions for the States, and su=
ch a construction of the=20

Constitution as would give the benefit of the doubt in all cases to the Sta=
tes.  The political theory=20

current south of the Potomac and the Ohio made of state rights a fetish. Ye=
t the powerful sectional=20

reaction which set in after 1820 against the nationalizing tendency had as =
its main impetus the=20

injustice which the Southern people felt had been done to them through the =
use of the nation's=20

larger powers. They objected to the protective tariff as a device which not=
 only brought the South=20

no benefit but interfered with its markets and raised the cost of certain o=
f its staple supplies. They=20

opposed internal improvements at national expense because of their consolid=
ating tendency, and=20

because few of the projects carried out were of large advantage to the Sout=
hern people. They=20

regarded the National Bank as at best useless; and they resisted federal le=
gislation imposing=20

restrictions on slavery as prejudicial to vested rights in the "peculiar in=
stitution."  After 1820 the=20

pendulum swung rapidly back toward particularism. State rights sentiment wa=
s freely expressed=20

by men, both Southern and Northern, whose views commanded respect; and in m=
ore than one=20

State--notably in Ohio and Georgia--bold actions proclaimed this sentiment =
to be no mere matter=20

of academic opinion. Ohio in 1819 forcibly collected a tax on the United St=
ates Bank in defiance of=20

the Supreme Court's decision in the case of M'Culloch vs. Maryland; and in =
1821 her Legislature=20

reaffirmed the doctrines of the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions and persi=
sted in resistance, even=20

after the Supreme Court had rendered a decision  specifically against the p=
osition which the State=20

had taken. Judge Roane of Virginia, in a series of articles in of the roman=
ces of chivalry could=20

hardly be found. And yet this cynical attitude was, as we have attempted to=
 show, but an=20

outgrowth of gallantry run mad; for in the beginning, gallantry, says Monte=
squieu, "is not love, but=20

it is the delicate, the light, the perpetual pretence of loving."     VIII =
 MARIE DE BRABANT AND=20

MAHAUT D'ARTOIS  THE household of the kings of France, so lately under the =
wise control of=20



Blanche de Castille or the pure influence of the good but weak Marguerite d=
e Provence, was the=20

scene of a court scandal which threatened serious consequences under the so=
n of Saint Louis,=20

that Philippe misnamed "le Hardi." The central figure in this unpleasant ep=
isode, Marie de Brabant,=20

is otherwise of so little note that we shall not tell more of her than is n=
ecessary to the=20

understanding of the little intrigue of which she was accused.  Isabelle d'=
Aragon, the first wife of=20

Philippe III., had died under tragic circumstances. She accompanied her hus=
band and Saint Louis=20

on the latter's second crusade, and returning with the body of the saintly =
king, was thrown from her=20

horse while crossing a stream in Calabria, and died a few days later (Janua=
ry, 1271), giving birth=20

to a child who did not long survive. In 1274, Philippe married Marie de Bra=
bant, sister of Duke=20

Jean de Brabant. The new queen was young, beautiful, and _excellente en sag=
esse_, increasing=20

each day in favor with the king. The favorite of Philippe at that time was =
Pierre de la Brosse, who=20

had begun life, so his enemies said, as barber-surgeon to Saint Louis, but =
who was really of more=20

respectable origin. He had now arrived at such a pitch of fortune as to exc=
ite the envy of the=20

nobles; since there was a clique against him, he was resolved to use every =
means to secure his=20

power, for the loss of his power, as he well knew, would almost certainly i=
nvolve the loss of his life.=20

The queen, Marie, had probably manifested dislike of this favorite and perh=
aps sympathy with the=20

attempts to overthrow his power. An accident--we do not hesitate to affirm =
that it was an accident--

gave Pierre, now her enemy, a chance to ruin her. In 1276, Prince Louis, Ph=
ilippe's eldest son by=20

Isabelle, died suddenly, or at least under mysterious circumstances. The da=
ys of poisoning were=20

not by any means past, and poisoning was at once suggested to account for t=
he mysterious death.=20

Pierre de la Brosse industriously circulated the rumor that the queen had c=
ommitted the crime and=20

was prepared to do the like by the three remaining children of Isabelle, in=
 order that the crown=20

might descend to her children. There was, of course, much evil talk in the =
court, as well as plots=20

and counterplots between the friends of the queen and the friends of the fa=
vorite. Philippe was half=20

distracted between his love for Marie and his suspicions of her, and the la=
tter Pierre de la Brosse=20

took pains to keep alive. Finally things came to such a pass that resort wa=
s had to the=20

supernatural to satisfy the doubts of the king,--no unusual method of settl=
ing difficulties in the days=20

when the belief in things occult was still rife.  At the instance of one of=
 the parties,--it is not=20

absolutely certain which,--Philippe decided to refer the matter of the deat=
h of this son to the=20

decision of a learned and devout nun, or Beguine, of Nivelle in Brabant, re=
puted to have the gift of=20

second sight and mysterious knowledge of things past, present, and to be. I=
t is not impossible that=20

the oracle was tampered with by the enemies of Pierre de la Brosse; but, ho=
wever that may be,=20

she returned an answer that set Philippe's heart at rest. He was told to cr=
edit no ill against his=20

good and loyal wife.=20


_
Osborn vs. Bank of the United States.  In 1825 Jefferson actually proposed =
that the Virginia=20

Legislature should pass a set of resolutions pronouncing null and void the =
whole body of federal=20

laws on the subject of internal improvements. The Georgia Legislature, arou=
sed by growing=20

antislavery activities in the North, declared in 1827 that the remedy lay i=
n "a firm and determined=20

union of the people and the States of the South" against interference with =
the institutions of that=20

section of Marie was thereby saved from a most dangerous position; but she =
could not fail to=20

harbor resentment against the instigator of the attack upon her.  Though, i=
n spite of the intrigues of=20

the queen and the nobles led by her brother, for two years Pierre de la Bro=
sse continued in favor,=20

his fate was preparing; and in the spring of 1278 it overtook him, when let=
ters written by him or=20

forged by his enemies were put into the hands of the king. There was treaso=
n in these letters,=20

alleged to have=20


_
When Jackson went into the White House, the country was therefore fairly bu=
zzing with=20

discussions of constitutional questions. What was the true character of the=
 Constitution and of the=20

Union established under it? Were the States sovereign? Who should determine=
 the limits of state=20

and federal powers? What remedy had a State against from Pierre's correspon=
dence with Spain.=20

He was arrested and confined in Vincennes, and a court of nobles, dominated=
 by the Dukes of=20

Burgundy and Brabant and the Count of Artois, held a sort of trial and cond=
emned him. The nobles=20

lost no time in disposing of the fallen favorite, whom they conducted at on=
ce to the scaffold, while=20

the people of=20


_
The South, in particular, was in an irritable frame of mind. Agriculture wa=
s in a state of depression;=20

manufacturing was not developing as had been expected; the steadily mountin=
g tariffs were=20

working economic disadvantage; the triumph of members of Congress and of th=
e Supreme Court=20

who of the fact that Pierre had been a good minister and that he was being =
unjustly condemned,=20

indulged in serious riots. There was a popular belief, indeed, voiced by a =
Parisian chronicler, that=20

Pierre was sacrificed to the hatred of the queen and the nobles: "Against t=
he will of the King, as=20
