the term by "annuntientes," the "messengers who announce," and it thus becomes certain that the 

teraphim were the oracles. They were the animated statues, the Gods who revealed themselves to 

the masses through the Initiated Priests and Adepts in the Egyptian, Chaldaean, Greek, and other 

temples.  As to the way of divining, or learning one's fate,  "I am looking for the person who let 

down the ladder. I see no one and yet the ladder didn't come down of itself."  "No, it is Bazin." 

"Ah! ah!" said D'Artagnan.  "But," continued Aramis, "Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing 

that I was not alone he discreetly retired. Sit down, my dear friend, and let us talk." And Aramis 

pushed forward 


_
by the teraphim,(439) it is explained quite plainly by Maimonides and Seldenus. The former says: 

The worshippers of the teraphim claimed that the light of the     principal stars [planets], 

penetrating into and filling the carved     statue through and through, the angelic virtue [of the 

regents, or     animating principle in the planets] conversed with them, teaching     them many most 

useful arts and sciences.(440)   In his turn Seldenus explains the same, adding that the 

teraphim(441) were built and fashioned in accordance with the position of their respective planets, 

each of the teraphim being consecrated to a special "star-angel," those that the Greeks called 

stoichae, as also according to figures located in the sky and called the "tutelary Gods":       Those 

who traced out the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA 

WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} were called {~GREEK SMALL

OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER

SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH

SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}.(442) 

Ammianus Marcellinus states that the ancient divinations were always accomplished with the help 

of the "spirits" of the elements (spiritus elementorum), or as they are called in Greek {~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL 

LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH 

PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK 

SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER 

OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. Now the latter are not the "spirits" of the stars 

(planets), nor are they divine Beings; they are simply the creatures inhabiting their respective 

elements, called by the Kabalists, elementary spirits, and by the Theosophists elementals.(443) 

Father Kircher, the Jesuit, tells the reader:       Every god had such instruments of divination to 

speak through.     Each had his speciality.   Serapis gave instruction on agriculture; Anubis taught 

sciences; Horus advised upon psychic and spiritual matters; Isis was consulted on the rising of the 

Nile, and so on.(444)  This historical fact, furnished by one of the ablest and most erudite among 

the Jesuits, is unfortunate for the prestige of the "Lord God of Israel" with regard to his claims to 

priority and to his being the _one_ living God. Jehovah, on the admission of the _Old Testament_ 

itself, conversed with his elect in no other way, and this places him on a par with every other 



Pagan God, even of the inferior classes. In _Judges_, xvii., we read of Micah having an ephod and 

a teraphim fabricated, and consecrating them to Jehovah (see the _Septuagint_ and the 

_Vulgate_); these objects were made by a founder from the two hundred shekels of silver given to 

him by his mother. True, King James' "Holy Bible" explains this little bit of idolatry by saying:       In 

those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that     which was right in his own eyes. 

Yet the act must have been orthodox, since Micah, after hiring a priest, a diviner, for his ephod 

and teraphim, declares: "Now know I that the Lord will do me good." And if Micah's act--who 

Had an house of Gods, and made an ephod and teraphim and     consecrated one of his sons   to 

their service, as also to that of the "graven image" dedicated "unto the Lord" by his mother--now 

seems prejudicial, it was not so in those days of one religion and one lip. How can the Latin 

Church blame the act, since Kircher, one of her best writers, calls the teraphim "the holy 

instruments of primitive revelations;" since _Genesis_ shows us Rebecca going "to enquire of the 

Lord,"(445) and the Lord answering her (certainly through his teraphim), and delivering to her 

several prophecies? And if this be not sufficient, there is Saul, who deplores the silence of the 

ephod,(446) and David who consults the thummim, and receives oral advice from the Lord as to 

the best way of killing his enemies.  The thummim and urim, however--the object in our days of so 

much conjecture and speculation--was not an invention of the Jews, nor had it originated with 

them, despite the minute instruction given about it by Jehovah to Moses. For the priest-hierophant 

of the Egyptian temples wore a breastplate of precious stones, in every way similar to that of the 

high priest of the Israelites.       The high-priests of Egypt wore suspended on their necks an image 

of sapphire, called _Truth_, the manifestation of truth becoming     evident in it.   Seldenus is not 

the only Christian writer who assimilates the Jewish to the Pagan teraphim, and expressed a 

conviction that the former had borrowed them from the Egyptians. Moreover, we are told by 

Doellinger, a preeminently Roman Catholic writer:       The teraphim were used and remained in 

many Jewish families to the     days of Josiah.(447)   As to the personal opinion of Doellinger, a 

Papist, and of Seldenus, a Protestant--both of whom trace Jehovah in the teraphim of the Jews 

and "evil spirits" in those of the Pagans--it is the usual one-sided judgment of _odium 

theologicum_ and sectarianism. Seldenus is right, however, in arguing that in the days of old, all 

such modes of communication had been primarily established for purposes of divine and angelic 

communications only. But       The holy Spirit (spirits, rather) spake [not] to the children of     Israel 

[alone] by urim and thummim, while the tabernacle remained,   as Dr. A. Cruden would have 

people believe. Nor had the Jews D'Artagnan stretched himself out.  "In the first place, you will sup 

with me, will you not?" asked Aramis.  "Yes, if you really wish it," said D'Artagnan, "and even with 

great pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite."  "Ah, my poor friend!" 

said Aramis, "you will find meagre fare; you were not expected."  "Am I then threatened with the 

omelet of Crevecoeur?"  "Oh, let us hope," said Aramis, "that with the help of God and of Bazin we 

shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, 

come here."  The door opened and Bazin entered; on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an 

exclamation that was almost a cry of despair.  "My dear Bazin," said D'Artagnan, "I am delighted to 

see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church!"  "Sir," replied Bazin, "I have 

been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a 

good cause."  "So far well," said Aramis; "we are dying of hunger. Serve us up the best supper you 



can, and especially give us some good wine."  Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.  "Now 

we are alone, dear Aramis," said D'Artagnan, "tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon 

the back of Planchet's horse."  "I'faith!" answered Aramis, "as you see, from Heaven."  "From 

Heaven," replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; "you have no more the appearance of coming 

from thence than you have of going there."  "My friend," said Aramis, with a look of imbecility on 

his face which D'Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers, "if I did not come 

from Heaven, at least I was leaving Paradise, which is almost the same."  "Here, then, is a puzzle 

for the learned," observed D'Artagnan, "until now they have never been able to agree as to the 

situation of Paradise; some place it on Mount Ararat, others between the rivers Tigris and 

Euphrates; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it, while it was actually very 

near. Paradise is at Noisy le Sec, upon the site of the archbishop's chateau. People do not go out 

from it by the door, but by the window; one doesn't descend here by the marble steps of a 

peristyle, but by the branches of a lime-tree; and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this 

elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one 

of the Prince de Marsillac."  Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.  "You were always a merry 

companion, my dear D'Artagnan," he said, "and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you. 

Yes, there is something in what you say; nevertheless, do not believe that it is Madame de 

Longueville with whom I am in love."  "A plague on't! I shall not do so. After having been so long in 

love with Madame de Chevreuse, you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy!" 

"Yes," replied Aramis, with an absent air; "yes, that poor duchess! I once loved her much, and to 

do her justice, she was very useful to us. Eventually she was obliged to leave France. He was a 

relentless enemy, that damned cardinal," continued Aramis, glancing at the portrait of the old 

minister. "He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not 

escaped with her waiting-maid--poor Kitty! I have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I 

don't know what village, with I don't know what cure, of whom she asked hospitality and who, 

having but one chamber, and taking her for a cavalier, offered to share it with her. For she had a 

wonderful way of dressing as a man, that dear Marie; I know only one other woman who can do it 

as well. So they made this song about her: 'Laboissiere, dis moi.' You know it, don't you?"  "No, 

sing it, please."  Aramis immediately complied, and sang the song in a very lively manner. 

"Bravo!" cried D'Artagnan, "you sing charmingly, dear Aramis. I do not perceive that singing 

masses has spoiled your voice."  "My dear D'Artagnan," replied Aramis, "you understand, when I 

was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbe I say as few 

masses as I can. But to return to our duchess."  "Which--the Duchess de Chevreuse or the 

Duchess de Longueville?"  "Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the 

Duchess de Longueville? Little flirtations, perhaps, and that's all. No, I spoke of the Duchess de 

Chevreuse; did you see her after her return from Brussels, after the king's death?"  "Yes, she is 

still beautiful."  "Yes," said Aramis, "I saw her also at that time. I gave her good advice, by which 

she did not profit. I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of Austria. She wouldn't 

believe me, saying that she knew Anne of Austria, who was too proud to love such a worthless 

coxcomb. After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort; and the 'coxcomb' 

arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevreuse."  "You know," resumed D'Artagnan, 

"that she has had leave to return to France?"  "Yes she is come back and is going to commit some 



fresh folly or another."  "Oh, but this time perhaps she will follow your advice."  "Oh, this time," 

returned Aramis, "I haven't seen her; she is much changed."  "In that respect unlike you, my dear 

Aramis, for you are still the same; you have still your beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure, 

still your feminine hands, which are admirably suited to a prelate."  "Yes," replied Aramis, "I am 

extremely careful of my appearance. Do you know that I am growing old? I am nearly thirty-

seven."  "Mind, Aramis"--D'Artagnan smiled as he spoke--"since we are together again, let us 

agree on one point: what age shall we be in future?"  "How?"  "Formerly I was your junior by two 

or three years, and if I am not mistaken I am turned forty years old."  "Indeed! Then 'tis I who am 

mistaken, for you have always been a good chronologist. By your reckoning I must be forty-three 

at least. The devil I am! Don't let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet; it would ruin me," replied the abbe. 

"Don't be afraid," said D'Artagnan. "I never go there."  "Why, what in the world," cried Aramis, "is 

that animal Bazin doing? Bazin! Hurry up there, you rascal; we are mad with hunger and thirst!" 

Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand.  "At last," said Aramis, "we are 

ready, are we?"  "Yes, monsieur, quite ready," said Bazin; "but it took me some time to bring up all 

the----"  "Because you always think you have on your

a "tabernacle" for such a kind of theophanic, or divine communication; for no Bath-Kol (or 

"Daughter of the divine Voice"), called thummim, could be heard whether by Jew, Pagan, or 

Christian, were there not a fit tabernacle for it. The "tabernacle" was simply the archaic telephone 

of those days of Magic when Occult powers were acquired by Initiation, just as they are now. The 

nineteenth century has replaced with an electric telephone the "tabernacle" of specified metals, 

wood, and special arrangements, and has natural mediums instead of high priests and 

hierophants. Why should people wonder, then, that instead of reaching Planetary Spirits and 

Gods, believers should now communicate with no greater beings than elementals and animated 

shells--the demons of Porphyry? Who these were, he tells us candidly in his work _On the Good 

and Bad Demons_:       They whose ambition is to be taken for Gods, and whose leader 

demands to be recognized as the Supreme God.   Most decidedly--and it is not the Theosophists 

who will ever deny the fact--there are good as well as bad spirits, beneficent and malevolent 

"Gods" in all ages. The whole trouble was, and still is, to know which is which. And this, we 

maintain, the Christian Church knows no more than her profane flock. If anything proves this, it is, 

most decidedly, the numberless theological blunders and spend all your time reading your 

breviary. But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten 

up my sword, I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on 

it."  Bazin, scandalized, made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand. D'Artagnan, more 

surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbe d'Herblay, which contrasted so strongly 

with those of the Musketeer Aramis, remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of his 

friend.  Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things, 

gilded, perfumed, appetizing, that D'Artagnan was quite overcome.  "But you expected some one 

then?" asked the officer.  "Oh," said Aramis, "I always try to be prepared; and then I knew you 

were seeking me."  "From whom?"  "From Master Bazin, to be sure; he took you for the devil, my 

dear fellow, and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again 

a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers."  "Oh, monsieur!" said Bazin, clasping his 

hands supplicatingly.  "Come, no hypocrisy! you know that I don't like it. You will do much better to 

open the window and let down some bread, a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet, 

who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands." 


_
the Gods of the heathen "devils," and then to copy their symbols in such a servile manner, 

enforcing the distinction between the good and the bad with no weightier proof than that they are 

respectively Christian and Pagan. The planets--the elements of the Zodiac--have not figured only 

at Heliopolis as the twelve stones called the "mysteries of the elements" (elementorum arcana). 

On the authority of many an orthodox Christian writer they were found also in Solomon's temple, 

and may be seen to this day in several old Italian churches, and even in Notre Dame of Paris. 

One would really say that the warning in Clement's under the window had repeated two or three 

times the signal agreed upon.  Bazin obeyed, fastened to the end of a cord the three articles 

designated and let them down to Planchet, who then went satisfied to his shed.  "Now to supper," 

said Aramis.  The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls, partridges and hams 

with admirable skill.  "The deuce!" cried D'Artagnan; "do you live in this way always?"  "Yes, pretty 

well. The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres, on account of 

my health; then I have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with Lafollone--you know the man I 

mean?--the
