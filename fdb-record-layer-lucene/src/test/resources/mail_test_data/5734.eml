hioned idea=20

that every girl should be equipped with an accomplishment, should cultivate=
 some definite ability to=20

please. The idea was much abused, and resulted in the torture of many innoc=
ent persons who=20

were compelled to look at crude sketches, to admire grotesque embroideries =
and to listen to=20

mediocre performances on the piano. But there was at the bottom of the idea=
 something sound=20

and wholesome. It is vitally important that women should please, should hel=
p to make the wheels=20

of life go easily. That was not an ignoble epitaph discovered on an old tom=
bstone in an English=20

churchyard, =E2=80=9CShe was so pleasant.=E2=80=9D Perhaps in the matter of=
 education we are now swinging too=20

far away from the old-fashioned ideal and are too much inclined to regard a=
s trifling a young girl=E2=80=99s=20

special efforts to please. Do we not somewhat puritanically regard the stud=
ies one does not like as=20

necessarily more efficacious than those pursued with joy? Drawing, music, t=
he modern languages,=20

the art of reciting or conversation=E2=80=94we speak of these usually not o=
nly as secondary in importance=20

to the study of Greek, Latin and mathematics, but as involving little in th=
e way of labor, while the=20

truth is that the pursuit of these subjects not only involves endless labor=
 but a labor that in the end=20

unveils personality and individuality, and makes for original interpretatio=
n of life to a degree far=20

exceeding results from the so-called severer branches.         *       *   =
    *       *       *  [Sidenote:=20

THE DILETTANTE]  The theory is generally disseminated that those studies wh=
ich give most=20

pleasure to one=E2=80=99s self and to others when actually transformed into=
 accomplishments are easy of=20

attainment and demand only the careless and dilettante touch. The elders as=
 well as the youth are=20

much impregnated with this idea. Let a girl understand when she begins to s=
tudy drawing, the=20

violin, the pianoforte or the art of singing that no success is possible wi=
thout hard work, that the=20

privilege of lessons will be withdrawn if she does not put effort and deter=
mination into her work,=20

and results of a correspondingly good character may be forthcoming.  [Siden=
ote:=20

THOROUGHNESS NECESSARY]  For the happiness of themselves and their friends,=
 it is well=20

that young girls should pursue any accomplishment toward which they may hav=
e a leaning.=20

Certainly such a pursuit, if entered into with delicacy and vivacity, must =
increase the sweetness of=20

life by adding to one=E2=80=99s sense of beauty; and it is never trite to s=
ay that a thing of beauty is a joy=20

forever.  Pursuit of an accomplishment does not always mean possession, but=
 where it does, even=20

measurably, it means also the power of imparting pleasure to one=E2=80=99s =
friends, and pleasure that is=20

touched upon and mingled with one=E2=80=99s own individuality. In a day whe=
n wealth counts for so much=20

in relation to the bestowal of pleasure, one can scarcely overestimate for =
those who do not have=20

wealth the value of the personal touch in the entertainment of one=E2=80=99=
s friends.     CHAPTER XI  THE=20

D=C3=89BUTANTE   A CLEVER young girl, when asked by an acquaintance if she =
had =E2=80=9Ccome out=E2=80=9D yet,=20

answered, =E2=80=9CI didn=E2=80=99t come out. I just _leaked_ out.=E2=80=9D=
 Doubtless this states the case, in a somewhat=20

slangy manner, for a large number of young women who, gradually and without=
 any set function to=20



serve as introduction, take their places in society. Even for them, however=
, the year following the=20

close of school duties marks a change in their relation to the social world=
, while the distinction is=20

much emphasized in the case of young girls to whom the affairs of balls, re=
ceptions, teas and calls=20

are a novelty. The date of a girl=E2=80=99s formal entrance into the larger=
 world marks her individual=20

recognition in that world. Before this time she has been a person without s=
ocial responsibility, not=20

accountable in the social sense. She has been considered in relation to her=
 family, perhaps. Now=20

she stands for herself. She is an object of some curiosity to the public, a=
nd the pleasures and=20

duties to which she falls heir deserve some special mention.         *     =

[Sidenote: THE AGE OF A D=C3=89BUTANTE]  The age at which a girl makes her =
formal appearance=20

on the scene of society varies in different places and with varying conditi=
ons. It is rarely under=20

eighteen, seldom over twenty-two, the first being the age at which a girl n=
ot desirous of extended=20

education escapes, usually, from the schoolroom, the second being the avera=
ge age of graduation=20

for the college girl. A girl younger than eighteen is commonly too immature=
 to be considered an=20

interesting member of society, and a certain degree of absurdity attaches t=
