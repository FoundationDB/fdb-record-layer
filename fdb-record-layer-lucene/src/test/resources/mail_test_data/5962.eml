 It was necessary that a special meeting of one of his railroad interests s=

patent leathers, and hat glossy as a mirror; diamonds gleamed and sparkled =
on his immaculate=20

shirt-bosom, on his fingers and from the seal of a heavy gold chain across =
his vest front.  The=20

other personage was a counterpart of the first to every particular, save th=
at while one was more=20

than a semi-centenarian to years, the other was barely twenty. The same fau=
ltless elegance in=20

dress, the same elaborate display of jewels, and the same haughty, aristocr=
atic bearing produced=20

in one was mirrored to the other.  They were father and son.  "Confound suc=
h a road!" growled the=20

younger man, as the stage bounced him about like a rubber ball. "For my par=
t I wish I had=20

remained at home, instead of coming out into this outlandish region. It is =
perfectly awful."  "Y-y-y-

hould be, that's true. But=20

have patience; ere long we will reach our destination, and--"  "Get shot li=
ke poor Vansevere did!"=20

sneered the other. "I tell you, governor, this is a desperate game you are =
playing."  The old man=20

smiled, grimly.  "Desperate or not, we must carry it through to the end. Va=
nsevere was not the=20

right kind of a man to set after the young scamp."  "How do you mean?"  "He=
 was too rash--

entirely too rash. Deadwood Dick is a daring whelp, and Vansevere's open of=
fer of a reward for his=20

apprehension only put the young tiger on his guard, and he will be more war=
y and watchful in the=20

future."  This in a positive tone.  "Yes; he will be harder to trap than a =
fox who has lost a foot=20

between jaws of steel. He will be their broker in choosing exactly the righ=
t time to buy and sell=20

Western Union.  But Edward did not know this.  One day a rumor became curre=
nt on the Street=20

that an agreement had been reached by the Western Union Company and its bit=
ter rival, the=20

American Union Telegraph Company, whereby the former was to absorb the latt=
er. Naturally; the=20

report affected Western Union stock.  But Mr. Gould denied it in toto; said=
 the report was not true,=20

no such consolidation was in view or had even been considered.  Down tumble=
d the stock, of=20

course.  But it so happened that Edward knew the rumor was true, because Mr=
. Gould, some time=20

before, had personally given him the contract of consolidation to copy.  Th=
e next day a rumor to=20

the effect that the American Union was to absorb the Western Union appeared=
 on the first page of=20

every New York newspaper.  Edward knew exactly whence this rumor emanated. =
 He had heard it=20

talked over.  Again, Western Union stock dropped several points.  Then he n=
oticed that Mr. Gould=20

became a heavy buyer.  So became Edward--as heavy as he could.  Jay Gould p=
ooh-poohed the=20

latest rumor.  The boy awaited developments.  On Sunday afternoon, Edward's=
 Sunday-school=20

teacher asked the boy to walk home with him, and on reaching the house took=
 him into the study=20

and asked him whether he felt justified in putting all his savings in Weste=
rn Union just at that time=20

when the price was tumbling so fast and the market was so unsteady.  Edward=
 assured his=20

teacher that he was right, although he explained that he could not disclose=
 the basis of his=20

assurance.  Edward=20


_
"Bah! I fear him not, old as I am. He is but a boy in years, you remember, =
and will be easily=20

managed."  "I hope so; I don't want my brains blown out, at least."  The st=
age rumbled on; the=20

Jehu cursed and lashed his horses; the canyon grew deeper, narrower and dar=
ker, the grade=20

slightly descending.  The moon seemed resting on the summit of a peak, hund=
reds of feet above,=20

and staring down in surprise at the noisy stage.  Alexander Filmore (the el=
der passenger)=20

succeeded in steadying himself long enough to ignite the end of a cigar to =
the bowl of Jehu's grimy=20

pipe; then he watched the trees that flitted by. Clarence, his son, had smo=
ked incessantly since=20

leaving Camp Crook, and now threw away his half-used cheroot, and listened =
to the sighing of the=20

spectral pines.  "The came the revelation that he, seeing that Edward was b=
uying to his limit, had=20

likewise done so.  But the broker had bought on margin, and had his margin =
wiped out by the=20

decline in the stock caused by the rumors.  He explained to Edward that he =
could recoup his=20

losses, heavy though they were--in fact, he explained that nearly everythin=
g he possessed was=20

involved--if Edward's basis was sure and the stock would recover.  Edward k=
eenly felt the=20

responsibility placed upon him.  He could never clearly diagnose his feelin=
gs when he saw his=20

teacher in this new light.  The broker's "customers" had been hinted at, an=
d the boy of eighteen=20

wondered how far his responsibility went, and how many persons were involve=
d.  But the deal=20

came out all right, for when, three days afterward, the=20


_
"She will be as much to the way as the boy will."  "She? Well, we'll attend=
 to her after we git him=20

out of the way. He is the worst obstacle to our path, at present. Maybe whe=
n you see the girl you=20

will take a fancy to her."  "Pish! I want no petticoats clinging to me--muc=
h less an ignorant=20

backwoods clodhopper. She is probably a fit mate skyrocketed, Jay Gould sol=
d out, Edward sold=20

out, the teacher-broker sold out, and all the customers sold out!  How long=
 a string it was Edward=20

never discovered, but he determined there and then to end his Wall Street e=
xperience; his original=20

amount had multiplied; he was content to let well enough alone, and from th=
at day to this Edward=20

_
"You are too rough on the tender sex, boy," and the elder Filmore gave vent=
 to a disconnected=20

laugh. "You must remember that your mother was a woman."  "Was she?" Claren=
ce bit the end of=20

his waxed mustache, and mused over his sire's startling announcement. "_You=
_ recollect that I=20

never saw her."  "D'ye carry poppin'-jays, pilgrims?" demanded Jehu, turnin=
g so suddenly upon=20

the two passengers as to frighten them out of their wits.  "Popping-jays?" =
echoed Filmore, senior.=20

"Yas--shutin'-irons--rewolvers--patent perforatin' of its manipulations; an=
d, although on "the inside,"=20

he decided that the combination of his teacher and his customers was a resp=
onsibility too great for=20

him to carry.  Furthermore, Edward decided to leave the Western Union.  The=
 longer he remained,=20

the less he liked its atmosphere.  And the closer his contact with Jay Goul=
d the more doubtful he=20

became of the wisdom of such an association and perhaps its unconscious inf=
luence upon his own=20

life in its formative period.  In fact, it was an experience with Mr. Gould=
 that=20
