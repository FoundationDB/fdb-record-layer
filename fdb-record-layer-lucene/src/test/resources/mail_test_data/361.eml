puzzled to tell what it was, for his countenance was strikingly handsome, a=
nd surely no form in the=20

crowd was more noticeable for its grace, symmetry, and proportionate develo=
pment. It would have=20

taken a scholar to have studied out the secret.  He was of about medium sta=
ture, and as straight=20

and square-shouldered as an athlete. His complexion was nut-brown, from lon=
g exposure to the=20

sun; hair of hue of the raven's wing, and hanging in long, straight strands=
 adown his back; eyes=20

black and piercing as an next morning took the account to the city editor o=
f the _Brooklyn Eagle_,=20

with the sage observation that every name mentioned in that paragraph repre=
sented a buyer of the=20

paper, who would like to see his or her name in print, and that if the edit=
or had enough of these=20

reports he might very advantageously strengthen the circulation of _The Eag=
le_.  The editor was=20

not slow to see the point, and offered Edward three dollars a column for su=
ch reports.  On his way=20

home, Edward calculated how many parties he would=20


_
features well molded, with a firm, resolute mouth and prominent chin. He wa=
s an interesting=20

specimen of young, healthy manhood, and, even though a youth in years, was =
one that could=20

command respect, if not admiration, wheresoever he might choose to go.  One=
 remarkable item=20

about his personal appearance, apt to strike the beholder as being exceedin=
gly strange and=20

eccentric, was his costume--buck-skin throughout, and that dyed column, and=
 decided that he=20

would organize a corps of private reporters himself.  Forthwith, he saw eve=
ry girl and boy he knew,=20

got each to promise to write for him an account of each party he or she att=
ended or gave, and laid=20

great stress on a full recital of names.  Within a few weeks, Edward was tu=
rning in to _The Eagle_=20

from two to three columns a week; his pay was raised to four dollars a colu=
mn; the editor was=20

pleased in=20


_
hue.  On being asked the cause of his odd freak of dress, when he had joine=
d the train a few miles=20

out from Cheyenne, the youth had laughingly replied:  "Why, you see, it is =
to attract bufflers, if we=20

should meet any, out on the plains 'twixt this and the Hills."  He gave his=
 name as Fearless Frank,=20

and said he was aiming for the Hills; that if the party in question would f=
urnish him a place among=20

them, he would extend to them his assistance as a hunter, guide, or whateve=
r, until the destination=20

was reached.  Seeing that he was well armed, and judging from external the =
"among those=20

present" at the parties all bought the paper and were immensely gratified t=
o see their names.  So=20

everybody was happy, and Edward Bok, as a full-fledged reporter, had begun =
his journalistic=20

career.  It is curious how deeply embedded in his nature, even in his earli=
est years, was the=20

inclination toward the publishing business.  The word "curious" is used her=
e because Edward is=20

the first journalist in the Bok family in all the centuries through which i=
