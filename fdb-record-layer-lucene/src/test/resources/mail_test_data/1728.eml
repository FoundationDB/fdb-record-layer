but the war; it's not "Business as Usual."  We stay here one night and move away to-morrow. We 

can hear the guns faintly.  The three section officers, myself and two others, are sleeping in a hut 

together. It is one of these new collapsible kind, very convenient. We are now all in bed. Outside 

the only sound we can hear is the sentries challenging and the mosquitoes singing.                    ---

----------------------------------  All males are soldiers in France, even the old men. They look very fine 

in their blue uniforms, but I have a prejudice for our khaki Tommies. We get good food as we 

travel, but pay war prices for it. Cherries are now in season; we don't pay for them, however. 

-------------------------------------  Rode another sixty miles to-day. A car smashed into the curb, 

cannoned off and ran over me, busting my machine up. The front wheel went over my leg. My 

revolver and leather holster saved me from a fracture, but I got badly bruised up. I was very 

scared that I should not be able to go "up" with the Battery. It would be almost a disgrace to go 

back broken up by a car without even getting a whack at the Boche. Had to ride later on another 

machine twenty-five miles through the night without lights, in a blinding rain.                    -------------

------------------------  Everything interesting. Should like to have a camera with me. I had to post 

mine back. So many things are done in the British Army by putting a man on his honor. They just 

ask you to do things. They don't order you to do it. It was that way with me; they merely "asked" 

me to post my camera back.  Great powerful cars rush by here all day and all night, regardless of 

speed limits. Every hour or so you see a convoy of twenty or thirty motor lorries in line bringing up 

ammunition or supplies, or coming back empty. Every point bristles with sentries who demand 

passes. If you are not able to answer satisfactorily, they just shoot. The French soldiers have 

magnificent uniforms; the predominating color is a sort of cobalt blue. To see sentries, French and 

British together, they make quite a nice color scheme.  Officers censor all letters. I censor 

sometimes fifty letters a day. One man put in a letter to-day, "I can't write anything endearing in 

this, as my section officer will read it." Another, "I enclose ten shillings. Very likely you will not 

receive this, as my officer has to censor this letter." Of course we don't have time to read all the 

letters through. We look for names of places and numbers of divisions, brigades, etc., but I 

couldn't help noticing that one of my men, whom I have long suspected of being a Don Juan, had 

by one mail written exactly the same letter to five different girls in England, altering only the 

addresses and the affectionate beginnings.  The village in which I am now was visited last 

September by twelve German officers who came through in motor cars; the villagers cried, "Vivent 

les Anglais," for not having seen an English soldier they took it for granted that the "Tommy" had 

come.  Everybody goes armed to the teeth. I have my belt, a regular Christmas tree for hanging 

things on, with revolver and cartridges on even while I'm writing this. We carry a lot, but we soon 

get used to it.                    -------------------------------------  The corn is being cut now. Through the 

window opposite I can see it standing in newly-stacked sheaves. These places are the favorite 

sketching grounds of artists in normal times, and I often wonder if they ever will be again.  We 

return salutes with all the French and Belgian officers. It is difficult sometimes to distinguish them. I 

got fooled by a Belgian postman, and then went to work and cut a French general.  The nearer we 

get to the firing line the finer the type of soldier. They are the magnificent Britishers of Kitchener's 

First Army. It makes you proud to see them marching by, dirty and wet with sweat. I watched two 

battalions come through; they had marched twenty miles through the sun with new issue boots; a 

few of them had fallen out, and other men and officers were carrying their equipment and rifles; 



many of the officers carried two rifles.  I am now well within sound of the guns. A German Taube 

was shelled as it came over our firing line yesterday. One man was lying on his back asleep with 

his hat over his eyes, when a piece of shrapnel from one of the "Archies" hit him in the stomach--

result: one and luxuriant; imagine, also, a rill of a reddish colour scarcely meandering through 

ground a little lower than the surrounding plain, and you will have a very correct idea of the 

appearance of these barrens. They are _generally_ (not always) found on what, in our western 

dialect, is called _second bottom_, and not on a level with any streams of magnitude, but rather at 

their sources. To mention all the counties of this State where these prairies and barrens are found, 

would be too tedious, and illy comport with the object which we have in view. We shall therefore 

content ourselves with describing those found in the north half of Fayette county, and the adjoining 

county of Madison, which may be said to be almost entirely one great barren of more than forty 

miles extent from north to south, and generally half as much in breadth from east to west. The 

great barren in Fayette, Madison, and, we may add, in the counties still north of them, is on land 

elevated from fifty to one hundred feet above the level of the Scioto river, into which the streams 

that have their sources in this tract of country generally run. This land lies so level that the waters 

stand on it too long for grain to thrive equally with grass, unless, indeed, the farmer should dig a 

long drain, which is easily effected by the plough, with a little assistance from the hoe and the 

spade. But as nature seems to have intended this tract of country for the raising of cattle instead of 

grain, the husbandman has listened to the suggestion, and in this great barren are found some 

thousands of the finest cattle which the State affords. Here the horse, the ox, and the swine feed, 

thrive, and fatten with little expense to their owner; but sheep do not, and never will, thrive on 

prairie grass, or wet grounds. Fruit-trees, the peach, the apple, the plum, &c. do very well when 

planted on the gently rising grounds, where the hickory or the oak had once stood. Fruit-trees, 

such as have been named, thrive very well also on the dry prairies. On the eastern side of the 

Allegany mountains there neither is, nor was there ever, any thing like these prairies and barrens, 

if we except those found in the western part of New-York, in the Genesee country, and in the 

vicinity of the lakes in that quarter. These, the writer of this saw nearly thirty years since, and 

before that country was much settled. Those prairies were similar in appearance to ours in the 

west, and were, beyond doubt, formed by similar means.   _Speculations on the Origin of the 

Prairies and Barrens._  What were the causes which contribute to form these natural meadows? 

That water was the principal agent in their formation, we very little doubt; but this is not the 

common opinion. According to that opinion, our prairies and barrens, and especially the latter, 

were occasioned entirely by the burning of the woods by the Indians, in order to take the wild 

game. Let us try this opinion by the indubitable appearances exhibited by these prairies and 

barrens.  They are invariably found in a level country, or in one which is nearly so; and the soil is 

generally, if not always, more moist than that which is uneven and hilly. Would not the leaves, 

where the land is dry, burn over with as great facility, or even with greater facility, than the grass 

would where the land is wet? Would there not be more wild game where they could find their food 

in plenty, such as acorns and hickory nuts, on which they feed in winter, than on land where no 

food, except dry grass and weeds, were to be found? It is well known that these prairies and 

barrens could not be burnt over when the vegetable productions which cover them were growing. 

At the only season when it is possible to burn them, that is in winter, to what kind of regions do the 



wild animals resort? Is it not to the thick woods? Every hunter will answer in the affirmative. For 

the space of twenty-five years, the writer of this lived in the vicinity of Indians, and from information 

on which he relies, as well as from his own actual observation, he confidently avers that the 

Indians neither are, nor ever were, in the habit of firing the woods in order to take game. 

Erroneous information first propagated such an opinion, and blind credulity has extended it down 

to us. Another opinion, equally groundless, prevails to a considerable extent; and that is, that 

these prairies have all been heretofore cultivated by the aborigines, and that the 


_
casualty. From the road I can see one of the observation balloons, a queer sausage-shaped 

airship. We may be moved up into the thick of it at any time now.                    ----------------------------

---------  I have been over into Belgium to-day: crossed the frontier on my motor bike; the roads are 

terrible, all this beastly "pave" cobblestones; awful stuff to ride over on a motor cycle. Shell holes 

on both sides of the road, and I saw three graves in the corner of a hop garden. All along the road 

there were dozens and dozens of old London motor buses, taking men to the trenches. They still 

have the advertisements on them and are driven by the bus-drivers themselves. Three hundred 

came over with their own machines. They are now soldiers. The observation balloon I mentioned 

yesterday was shelled down to-day.  I am writing this in an old Flemish farmhouse, and the room 

I'm sitting in has a carved rafter ceiling, red brick floor and nasty purple cabbage wallpaper. All the 

men of the house with the exception of the old man are at the war; one son has already died. The 

Germans have been through here. They tied the mayor of the town to a tree and shot him. The 

trenches have been filled in, all the wreckage cleared, and they have a new mayor.                    ----

---------------------------------  It is not yet 7 A.M. I am an orderly officer and have to take the men out 

for a run at six. I came back and bought a London "Daily Mail" of yesterday from a country-woman. 

We are at least three miles from the town, but they are enterprising enough to bring papers to us 

at this time in the morning. A "Daily Mail" costs four cents.  Since I last wrote I have been up to the 

front line. Everything is different from what you imagine. The German trenches are easily 

distinguished through glasses; their sand-bags are multi-colored. Shrapnel was bursting over ruins 

of an old town in their lines. When you look through a periscope at the wilderness, it is difficult to 

imagine that thousands of soldiers on both sides have burrowed themselves into the earth. The 

evidence of their alertness is shown by their snipers, who are always busy whenever the target is 

up.  A battery of eight-inch howitzers was opening fire. Our battery commander, hearing this, sent 

us up. The guns, big fellows, were well concealed. They were painted in protective colors and 

covered with screens of branches to prevent aerial observation. In the grounds all over the place 

were dug-outs, deep rabbit burrows, ten or twelve feet down, into which everybody went 

immediately. The Germans started their "hate." The firing is done by hand cord; other big guns are 

fired electrically. An enormous flash, an ear-splitting crash, a great sheet of flame from the muzzle, 

and two hundred pounds of steel is sent tearing through the air to the "Kultur" exponents. The 

whole gun lifts off the ground and runs back on its oil-compression prevented the growth of trees 

on them. The Indians, it is to be presumed, never cultivated any other grain than maize, or Indian 

corn, and yet we see few or no corn-hills in any part of this country. In the western part of New-

York, before it was settled by its present inhabitants, thousands and thousands of acres were to 

be seen, where the trees were as large as any in the forest, and yet the rows of corn-hills were 

plainly discernible. I refer in a particular manner to what is now called Cayuga county. There the 

growth of grass had not prevented the growth of trees, nor did it here. We know that some of these 

prairies were cultivated by the Indians, but never to any very considerable extent. This country 

never was thickly settled by Indians, like the shores of the Atlantic and the banks of the rivers 

running into it. No, it was the ancestors of the Peruvians and the Mexicans who lived here in great 

numbers, before they migrated to South America.  The question then recurs, by what powerful 

means were these prairies and barrens formed?  That water was the principal agent, we infer from 

the fact, that the soil is always alluvial to greater or less depth; the former we call prairie, the latter 



barren. But how could the country from the southern shore of Lake Erie to Chillicothe, a distance 

of more than one hundred and fifty miles from north to south, ever be covered with water long 

enough to form alluvial soil, in many places from four to six feet in depth? I answer, that the 

Niagara river, the present outlet of Lake Erie, has worn away several hundred feet, and in that way 

the lake is lowered in the same proportion. The high land, composed entirely of sand, originally 

extending from the Ohio northerly upwards of forty miles, to Chillicothe, has been worn through by 

the Scioto river; and the waters which once for ages covered the whole country north of the hills 

along the Ohio river have been drained off, and the dry land appears where once stood the waters 

of lakes Erie and Michigan, then forming but one great lake. I am fully impressed with the belief, 

that were the bottom of Niagara river as high as it once was, the upper lakes would now, as 

formerly, empty themselves into the Ohio by the Scioto and Miami rivers, and into the Mississippi 

by the Illinois. I might proceed to examine every part of the country where prairies and barrens are 

found; but they have all been formed by the same agent, and that is water. An objection to this 

opinion may be raised by some, that these prairies and barrens are frequently found in the 

counties of Delaware, Champaign, Madison, Fayette, &c. on ground considerably elevated. Are 

they higher than the hills near Chillicothe? From a careful inspection, but without any instruments, 

I am convinced that they are none of them as high.  There is no perpendicular fall of water, but 

merely a gradual descent, from Columbus to the Ohio; nay, there is no 


_
tractors which are kept somewhere close by. In three quarters of an hour they can get them 

started on the road. The ground for these emplacements was the orchard of a chateau. While we 

were there a whistle blew three times, an order shouted; immediately the guns were covered up 

and the men took cover. The enemy had sent an aeroplane to locate them. If they could once find 

them, hundreds of shells would rain on this spot in a few minutes. At a few yards' distance I 

couldn't see the guns myself. The "Hows" were firing at a house in the German lines which had 

very source of the Scioto to its mouth. Every one acquainted with hydrostatics, knows that water 

will run briskly where the descent is only a few inches in a mile. The writer believes that the Scioto, 

from its source to the Ohio river, does not descend more than one hundred feet, and that the 

present surface of Lake Erie is about on a level with the Ohio in a freshet; that before the channel 

of Niagara river was deepened, as it evidently has been, by the attrition of that mighty stream; and 

before the hills adjacent to the Ohio were worn down by the waters of 


_
trouble. In three rounds they got it and then started in to "dust" the neighborhood. Of course, the 

firing is indirect. The officers and men who are with the guns don't see the effects. Apparently they 

fire straight away in the air. The observation is done by the forward observing officer in the fire 

trenches who corrects them by 'phone.  After the appointed number of rounds had been fired, we 

adjourned to the chateau, a fine house, marble mantelpiece, plaster ceilings, country north of 

Chillicothe, where these hills commence, to Lake Erie inclusive, was covered with water, except 

the very highest hills in the counties of Greene, &c. which were then islands. What tends to 

corroborate this opinion is, that on these high grounds we find limestone and other rocks, and 

indications of gypsum; but no alluvion, and none of those fragments and ruins which are produced 

by water acting mechanically upon a country for a long space of time. We
