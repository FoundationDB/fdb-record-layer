Even then the boy was reluctant to relinquish the box.  Appraising his chan=
ces, he gazed beyond=20

the tramp. Through the open door he could see Chips and Midge moving in clo=
ser.  A daring plan=20

flashed into his mind. But should he risk trying it? The chances were about=
 even that he would fail.=20

Chips was a star baseball player and his reactions were fast. But would the=
y be speedy enough?=20

"Listen, you!" the tramp ordered again. "Give me that box!"  Dan no longer =
dared stall. Chips and=20

Midge were quite close to the door now, though not near enough to attack th=
e tramp from the rear.=20

Behind the two, almost in line were Fred and Jack who had hastened up from =
the direction of the=20

creek.  For Dan's purpose, the line-up was very nearly perfect. The moment =
had come. He had to=20

take the chance and hope that the other Cubs didn't muff it.  "Sure, I'll g=
ive you the box," he said.=20

"CATCH!"  Even before Dan shouted the word, he about his life before he cam=
e to this country;=20

how he used to play the fiddle at weddings and dances. I thought about the =
friends he had=20

mourned to leave, the trombone-player, the great forest full of game,--belo=
nging, as Antonia said,=20

to the "nobles,"--from which she and her mother used to steal wood on moonl=
ight nights. There=20

was a white hart that lived in that forest, and if any one killed it, he wo=
uld be hanged, she said.=20

Such vivid pictures came to me that they might have been Mr. Shimerda's mem=
ories, not yet=20

faded out from the air in which they had haunted him.  It had begun to grow=
 dark when my=20

household returned, and grandmother was so tired that she went at once to b=
ed. Jake and I got=20

supper, and while we were washing the dishes he told me in loud whispers ab=
out the state of=20

things over at the Shimerdas'. Nobody could touch the body until the corone=
r came. If any one did,=20

something terrible would happen,=20


_
over the tramp's head.  Belatedly the man made a leap for it, but he clutch=
ed only air.  Behind him,=20

the box was falling almost directly into Chips' hands.  "Get it!" shouted D=
an.  Chips already was=20

closing his hands upon the box. He fumbled, recovered and held fast.  "Pass=
 it!" shouted Dan.=20

"PASS!"  The command The dead man was frozen through, "just as stiff as a d=
ressed turkey you=20

hang out to freeze," Jake said. The horses and oxen would not go into the b=
arn until he was frozen=20

so hard that there was no longer any smell of blood. They were stabled ther=
e now, with the dead=20

man, because there was no other place to keep them.=20


_
toward him, he suddenly realized what Dan meant.  Pivoting, he shoved the b=
ox into Midge's=20

hands.  By now, all the Cubs had caught onto the trick.  Midge ran a few st=
eps and tossed the box=20

to Fred.  "Come back here, you!" shouted the tramp furiously.  Forgetting D=
an and Brad,=20

Shimerda's head. Antonia and Ambrosch and the mother took turns going down =
to pray beside=20

him. The crazy boy went with them, because he did not feel the cold. I beli=
eved he felt cold as=20

much as any one else, but he liked to be thought insensible to it. He was a=
lways coveting=20


_
The two boys ran out of the shack.  "Make for Mrs. Jones' place!" Dan shout=
ed.  Fred was a fast=20

runner and already had a long start on the tramp.  But to the alarm of the =
Cubs, the man did not=20

give up the chase. Determined to recover the box, he kept after him.  Brad =
rounded up Jack and=20

the other Cubs, heading for the road, by a shorter route. Anxiously, they l=
ooked about for Mr.=20

Hatfield and police officers, but the highway was entirely deserted.  "Some=
thing's delayed them,"=20

Brad said anxiously, scribbling a note which he speared on a barb of the wi=
re fence. "I hope he=20

finds this. I've told him to look for us at Mrs. Jones'."  The Cubs had rea=
ched the road a minute or=20

two ahead of Fred. Soon they saw him rolling under a fence thirty yards far=
ther down the highway.=20

"Good boy!" Dan exclaimed. "He still has the box!"  The Cubs raced to join =
Fred. Brad relieved him=20

of the money container.  "We can't stop to pick any daisies!" Fred panted. =
"That ape is right on my=20

heels!"  "Let's have it out with him!" Chips exclaimed. "We're seven to one=
--lots o' fun!"  "We're=20

heading for Mrs. Jones' place!" Brad ordered firmly. "I think the fellow ha=
s a knife. We're Marek!=20

Ambrosch, Jake said, showed more human feeling than he would have supposed =
him capable of;=20

but he was chiefly concerned about getting a priest, and about his father's=
 soul, which he believed=20

was in a place of torment and would remain there until his family and the p=
riest had prayed a great=20

deal for him. "As I understand it," Jake concluded, "it will be a matter of=
 years to pray his soul out=20

of Purgatory, and right now he's in torment."  "I don't believe it," I said=
 stoutly. "I almost know it is=20

n't true." I did not, of course, say that I believed he had been in that ve=
ry kitchen all afternoon, on=20

his way back to his own country. Nevertheless, after I went to bed, this id=
ea of punishment and=20

Purgatory came back on me crushingly. I remembered the account of Dives in =
torment, and=20

shuddered. But Mr. Shimerda had not been rich and selfish; he had only been=
 so unhappy that he=20

could not live any longer.     XV   OTTO FUCHS got back from Black Hawk at =
noon the next day.=20

He reported that the coroner would reach the Shimerdas' sometime that after=
noon, but the=20

missionary priest was at the other end of his parish, a hundred miles away,=
 and the trains were=20
