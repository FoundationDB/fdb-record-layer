in question being Epsom Downs, there will undoubtedly be room for him without his filling an 

unnecessarily prominent position, so I will couple _Llanthony_ with _La Fleche_ to supply the 

probable last in the Derby.  Meanwhile, I must say a word or two about the Ladies' Race at Epsom 

on Friday next. There is absolutely no knowing what will start for the Oaks nowadays until the 

numbers go up--and no Turf Prophet will venture a selection until the morning of the race--and 

_this_ is where the perspicuity of an Editor like yourself, _Mr. Punch_, scores a distinct hit--for 

such a paltry consideration as "knowing nothing about it" is not likely to daunt a woman who takes 

as her motto the well-known line from SHAKSPEARE: "Thus Angels rush where Cowards fear to 

tread!"--so herewith I confidently append my verse selection for the last Mare in the Oaks!    Yours 

devotedly,     LADY GAY.  THE TIP.    'Tis the voice of the Sluggard, I hear him complain,     You 

have waked me too soon--an unpleasant surprise!   In an hour or so later pray call me again,

KEEPING.--The Earl of DYSART has left the ranks of the Liberal Unionists and become a 

Gladstonian coadjutor this evening," said Aramis, "so we give it up."  And they hastened to quit the 

palace, followed by Bazin, who was lavish of bows and compliments.  "Well," said Athos, when 

Aramis and he were in the boat again, "are you beginning to be convinced that we should have 

done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin?"  "You are wisdom incarnate, Athos," 

Aramis replied.  What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken 

by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England, which they thought 

should have arrested the attention of all Europe.  In fact, aside from a poor widow and a royal 

orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre, no one appeared to be aware that Charles I. had 

ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold.  The two friends made an appointment for ten 

o'clock on the following day; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door 

of the hotel, Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone. 

At ten o'clock the next day they met again. Athos had been out since six o'clock.  "Well, have you 

any news?" Athos asked.  "Nothing. No one has seen D'Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared. 

Have you anything?"  "Nothing."  "The devil!" said Aramis.  "In fact," said Athos, "this delay is not 

natural; they took the

*  ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.  EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.  _House of 

Commons, Monday, May 23._--REDMOND, Junior, said really funny thing just now. Rising to take 

part in resumed Debate on Irish Local Government Bill, he announced in loud angry tone that it 

would be waste of time to discuss a Bill the Government evidently did not intend to press through 

this Session, and he for one would be no party to such a farce. Then he went on to talk for half an 

hour.  [Illustration:  "Add to that D'Artagnan's rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose 

an hour, knowing that we were expecting him."  "He expected, you will remember, to be here on 

the fifth."  "And here we are at the ninth. This evening the margin of possible delay expires." 

"What do you think should be done," asked Athos, "if we have no news of them to-night?" 

"Pardieu! we must go and look for them."  "All right," said Athos.  "But Raoul?" said Aramis.  A light 

cloud passed over the count's face.  "Raoul gives me much uneasiness," he said. "He received 

yesterday a message from the Prince de Conde; he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not 

returned."  "Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse?"  "She was not at home. And you, Aramis, 

you were going, I think, to visit Madame de

Debate on the whole something better than last week's contribution. O'BRIEN delivered himself of 

glowing denunciation full of felicitous phrases, all got through in half an hour. CHAMBERLAIN 

followed; has not yet got over startling novelty of his interposition in Debate being welcomed by 

loud cheers from Conservatives; thinks of old Aston-Park days, when the cheering was, as 

WEBSTER (not Attorney-General) says, "on the other boot." Now, when JOSEPH gets up to 

demolish his Brethren sitting near, Conservatives opposite settle themselves down with the 

peculiar rustling motion with which a congregation in crowded church or  "I did go there."  "Well?" 

"She was no longer there, but she had left her new address."  "Where was she?"  "Guess; I give 

you a thousand chances."  "How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the 

Frondists was at midnight? for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her."  "At 

the Hotel de Ville, my dear fellow."  "What! at the Hotel de Ville? Has she, then, been appointed 

provost of merchants?"  "No; but she has become queen of Paris, ad interim, and since she could 

not venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the Tuileries, she is installed at the

listen to a favourite preacher. Pretty to watch them as CHAMBERLAIN goes forward with his 

speech, delighting them with surprise to find how much better is their position than they thought 

when it was recommended or extolled from their own side. JOSEPH not nearly so acrimonious to-

night as sometimes. Still, as usual, his speech chiefly directed to his former point of giving an heir 

or an heiress to that dear duke."  "You didn't tell me of that, Aramis."  "Really? It was my 

forgetfulness then; pardon me."  "Now," asked Athos, "what are we to do with ourselves till 

evening? Here we are without occupation, it seems to me."  "You forget, my friend, that we have 

work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton; I hope
