philodendron monstera  Jacques Lalouet ushered Chauvelin out. When he was f=
inally left standing alone at the head of the stairs and young Lalouet's fo=
otsteps had ceased to resound across the floors of the rooms beyond, he rem=
ained quite still for awhile, his eyes fixed into vacancy, his face set and=
 expressionless; and through his lips there came a long-drawn-out sigh of i=
ntense satisfaction.   "Well, it's in regard to them there canoe-paddles.  =
Although they do seem small, compared with oars, I find they're quite big e=
nough to do the work, and although I've bin trained from a youngster to han=

out. When he was finally left standing alone at the head of the stairs and =
young Lalouet's footsteps had ceased to resound across the floors of the ro=
oms beyond, he remained quite still for awhile, his eyes fixed into vacancy=
, his face set and expressionless; and through his lips there came a long-d=
rawn-out sigh of intense satisfaction.   "Well, it's in regard to them ther=
e canoe-paddles.  Although they do seem small, compared with oars, I find t=
hey're quite big enough to do the work, and although I've bin trained from =
a youngster to handle the oar, an' go like a crab with my back the way I'm =
pullin', it do seem more sensible-like to sit wi' one's face to the front a=
nd drive ahead;-- anyhow, it's more _
gain, I should like to know, by the capture of that dare-devil Englishman?"=
  "Oh!" replied Chauvelin=20

suavely, "I shall gain the citizen proconsul's regard, I hope--and yours to=
o, citizen Lalouet. I want=20

nothing more except the success of my plan."  Young Lalouet jumped down to =
his feet. He=20

shrugged his shoulders and through his fine eyes shot a glance of mockery a=
nd scorn on the thin,=20

shrunken figure of the Terrorist.  "How you do hate that Englishman, citize=
n Chauvelin," Winnipeg=20

to fish.  "I will go with you," said Dan, to whom the announcement was made=
.  "An' so will I," said=20

Fred Jenkins, who chanced to be conversing with Dan at the time--"that is, =
if they can spare me=20

just now."  "The canoe of Okematan," said the chief, "holds no more than th=
ree.  He wishes to take=20

with him Arch-ee and Leetil Bill."  "Very well," returned Dan, "there's no =
objection to that, for there=20

is not much doing on the farm at this moment, and Archie has worked=20


_
light laugh.   IV  Carrier having fully realised that he in any case stood =
to make a vast sum of=20

money out of the capture of the band of English spies, gave his support gen=
erously to Chauvelin's=20

scheme. Fleury, summoned into his presence, was ordered to place himself an=
d half a company of=20

Marats at the disposal of citizen Chauvelin. He demurred and growled like a=
 bear with a sore head=20

at being placed under the orders of a civilian, but it was not easy to run =
counter to the proconsul's=20

will. A good deal of swearing, one or two overt threats and the citizen com=
mandant was reduced to=20

submission. The promise of a thousand francs, when the reward for the captu=
re of the English=20

spies was paid out by a grateful Government, overcame his last objections. =
 "I think you should rid=20

yourself of that obstinate oaf," was young Lalouet's cynical comment, when =
Fleury had finally left=20

the audience chamber; "he is too argumentative for my taste."  Chauvelin sm=
iled quietly to himself.=20

He cared little what became of every one of these Nantese louts once his gr=
eat object had been=20

attained.  "I need not trouble you further, citizen Carrier," he said as he=
 finally rose to take his=20

leave. "I shall have my hands full until I myself lay that meddlesome Engli=
shman bound and=20

gagged at your feet."  The phrase delighted Carrier's insensate vanity. He =
was overgracious to=20

Chauvelin now.  "You shall do that at the Rat Mort, citizen Chauvelin," he =
said with marked=20

affability, "and I myself will commend you for your zeal to the Committee o=
f Public all the summer,=20

so he deserves a holiday.  We will just make up the same party that started=
 last time, only that=20

Fergus and I will take a somewhat bigger canoe so as to accommodate you, Je=
nkins."  "Thankee.=20

Though I am big--unfort'nitly--I can stow myself away in small compass, an'=
 I've larned how, when=20

there ain't overmuch grub, to git along fairly well on short allowance.  Wh=
en d'ee trip your anchor?-

- I mean, when do ye start?"  "When to-morrow's sun touches the tree-tops i=
n the east," said the=20

Indian chief.  "All right, Okematan, I'm your man--after layin' in a breakf=
ast-cargo."  According to=20

this arrangement the two canoes pushed off at daybreak the following mornin=
g, from the wharf at=20

the foot of the garden of Prairie Cottage, and began the descent of the Red=
 River, which, after=20

flowing between twenty and thirty miles northward, enters the mighty bosom =
of Lake Winnipeg.=20

Okematan and Archie occupied their old places in the stern and bow of the c=
hief's canoe, with=20

Little Bill in the middle--this time using a paddle, for his strength had g=
reatly increased.  The other=20

canoe was steered by Dan; Fergus acted bowman, and Jenkins sat between them=
, also wielding a=20

paddle.  That night they encamped on the banks of the river, for their prog=
ress had been slow,=20

owing to sundry visits which had to be paid to settlers on the way down.  "=
Well, now," observed the=20

sailor, as he stood by the camp-fire smoking his pipe contemplatively, "I f=
ind that as circumstances=20

change about in this world men's minds are apt to go 'bout-ship=20


_
"Always supposing," interposed Jacques Lalouet with his cynical laugh, "tha=
t citizen Chauvelin=20

does not let the whole rabble slip through his fingers."  "If I do," conclu=
ded Chauvelin drily, "you=20

may drag the Loire for my body to-morrow."  "Oh!" laughed Carrier, "we won'=
t trouble to do that.=20

_Au revoir_, citizen Chauvelin," he added with one of his grandiloquent ges=
tures of dismissal, "I=20

wish you luck at the Rat  "That sounds a terribly profound speech, Fred," s=
aid Archie, who was=20

busy at his very usual occupation of whittling an arrow for his brother. "D=
id your father teach it you,=20

or did you crib it from a copy-book?"  "No, I raither think," retorted the =
seaman quietly, "that I got it=20

from your grandmother by the father's side."  "What may be the circumstance=
 that has caused=20

your mind to go about-ship just now?" asked Dan,=20
