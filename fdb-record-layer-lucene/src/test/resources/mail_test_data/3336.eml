working so well, the runaway wife could not forbear adding one more touch t=

 protestations of undying=20

devotion, it not infrequently happened that the troubadour did not continue=
 to devote himself to=20

one lady. Sometimes the lady found a more acceptable lover, or became tired=
 of the love=20

violent poets without=20

good excuse, for he might turn from love songs to _sirventes_, and satirize=
 her whom before he=20

had extolled as a paragon. One of the most amusing of the anecdotes of the =
troubadours is that=20

telling how Marie de Ventadour got rid of the attentions of Gaucelm Faidit.=
