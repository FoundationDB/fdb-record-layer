or prescribe or to=20

advise in respect to either, or that he did either, it was held that the re=

established;[400] but a physician consulted by the patient=E2=80=99s regula=

a conference.[402] Attendance at the patient=E2=80=99s house is not contemp=

clerk=E2=80=99s office and consisted of an examination of an eruption on th=

and learning as a=20

physician in forming his opinion, and that it was in confidence that he pos=
sessed medical skill that=20

the person requested the examination.[404]  It does not follow that the rel=
ation once established=20

continues always; the secrecy growing out of the relationship, as to knowle=

always continues unless properly waived; and the physician will not be allo=
