ers have found it requisite to their comfort to emigrate beyond the limits =
of a most unenviable notoriety.     MATRIMONIAL ESPIONAGE.   Among the curi=
osities of my experience I reckon the incidents of the narrative I am about=
 to relate.  A _
attorney, who was instructed to do his best for the prisoner. This gentlema=
n met Mr. Downey and=20

his lawyer in the reluctant lodgings of M. Voleur, that unlucky man being p=
resent. A quarrel was=20

cut short, or nearly prevented, by considerations of prudence.  M. Voleur's=
 attorney led the=20

discussion into a practical current by saying to his opponents,  "I tell yo=
u plainly, that my client=20

can't put in bail, and he won't lie in prison. If you don't voluntarily rel=
ease him, I'll file his petition in=20

bankruptcy. It was foolish on your part to lock him up. He can't get the mo=
ney to pay you while he=20

is here; but if he had his liberty, he might do so. He's a clever fellow, a=
nd will not stop yet awhile,=20

unless you are silly enough to stop him. If you let him alone, taking care =
not to trust him any more=20

yourselves, but not thwarting him or destroying his credit, you may easily =
float out in the course of=20

a month or two."  Mr. Downey and his attorney were struck by the ingenuity,=
 if not force, of the=20

argument, but not quite persuaded to release the debtor.  "Can you offer us=
 any security?" Mr.=20

Downey's adviser asked.  "No," was the terse rejoinder.  "Then I don't see =
the advantage of=20

liberating your client," added the creditor's attorney.  The negotiation wo=
uld have broken off at this=20

point, but for the Frenchman's ready wit. He had a resource. He had a small=
 contingent property in=20

France. It was valuable enough to cover the debt of Downey and Grabble, alt=
hough not to be=20

easily realised in this country. He did not like to part with this, his onl=
y fortune, to a stranger.  A=20

Frenchman is literally and absolutely nothing, if not always sentimental, a=
nd occasionally=20

lachrymose.  M. Voleur shed tears when he agreed to part with this little c=
ontingent estate to his=20

inexorable creditor; then, having exhausted his natural emotions, he return=
ed to business, and the=20

negotiation was renewed.  It was ultimately settled, on Downey's giving his=
 assurance, upon the=20

honour of a gentleman, that he would afterwards do what he could to prop up=
 the house of Voleur=20

and Enlever--that is, by giving favourable references as to them--he and hi=
s partner should have=20

an assignment made to them of this contingent estate. The sentimental Frenc=
hman further=20

stipulated, that when he paid the amount due to Downey and Grabble, as he e=
xpected to do very=20

soon, the creditors should re-transfer the estate.  The compact was ratifie=
d by solemn pledges of=20

honour.  To save appearances, it was arranged that one of the firm of Downe=
y and Grabble should=20

go to France, pretend to make inquiries about the respectability of Voleur =
and Enlever, and=20

telegraph back "all right," as an excuse fur the liberation of M. Voleur. T=
he reader will see the=20

necessity for this. Downey and Co. could not venture to speak favourably of=
 the man they had=20

arrested unless some excuse could be found for an altered opinion. Downey a=
nd Co. would not, of=20

course, tell any body of the arrest of Voleur, but that ugly fact might wit=
hal leak out. How to=20

reconcile the contents of the affidavit, which led the judge to order the F=
renchman's arrest, with=20

the subsequent eulogiums, was the moral difficulty to be surmounted.  It is=
 needless to say that=20

the argument of the Frenchman's attorney must not be repeated, and the secu=
rity they had=20

obtained must not be mentioned. The possession of that document was a palpa=
ble sign of a want=20

of that confidence upon which ordinary credit rests. An inquiry on the spot=
 into the respectability of=20

the French house seemed to all parties the most effective way of getting up=
 a show of justification=20

for a good character to be lavished on the swindlers.  Downey started by th=
e next train and boat to=20

Paris. He had for his companion M. Voleur's madame. This little circumstanc=
e was not, I believe,=20

mentioned to Mrs. Downey, because she had a jealous disposition.  Within an=
 incredibly short=20

space of time Mr. Downey made all the inquiries he deemed requisite, and wa=
s enabled to=20

despatch the welcome message, "all right," by the harnessed lightning, as h=
e promised.  Next day=20



Voleur met Downey in the French capital, and the next and the next were spe=
nt in the same place.=20

During this time Voleur constructed in 1852, as a feeder to the Pennsylvani=
a canal, fourteen miles=20

below. A culvert at the bottom of the dam contained fine iron discharge pip=
es, each two feet in=20

diameter, which could be opened at low water thus sending the contents of t=
he reservoir to the=20

canal at Johnstown. In 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, having boug=
ht the canal,=20

abandoned it, and the reservoir was thenceforth disused. In July, 1862, the=
 culvert beneath it gave=20

way, owing to some imperfection of the foundation. The depth of water in th=
e reservoir was, at the=20

time, not greater than forty feet; hardly more than half its actual capacit=
y. The breach widened into=20

a chasm, and the water of the reservoir was discharged, with the exception =
of about eight feet at=20

the bottom; but so slow was the process, owing to the substantial character=
 of the dam, and the=20

resistance it presented, that little harm resulted.  From 1862 to 1880, the=
 reservoir was empty, and=20

the property, containing something more than five hundred acres, was a wast=
e. In 1875 it was=20

bought by Congressman John Reilly, and was by him, four years later, transf=
erred to the South=20

Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. This was an association of three gentlemen; =
suggested and=20

organized by Colonel B. F. Ruff, a successful railroad and tunnel contracto=
r. All these parties had=20

ceased from membership in the club prior to the great disaster.  The origin=
al dam, constructed with=20

care and solidity, had involved an expenditure of $240,000. It was built in=
 regular layers and solidly=20

rammed, and when finished was higher in the middle than at the ends, having=
 a spill-way cut=20

through rock in the side of the hill. The cost of reconstruction was no mor=
e than $17,000. No=20

engineer, good or bad, had charge of the work. The material used was, for t=
he most part, not more=20

substantial than shale and earth and straw. The pipes at the bottom were pe=
rmanently closed, and=20

as the dam advanced, the water was discharged through a board flume over th=
e top. It was at first=20

intended to raise the new dam to a height of no more than forty feet, but i=
t was presently=20

discovered that to cut down the spill-way through rock would cost more than=
 to construct the dam=20

to the original elevation. This was accordingly done, though not perfectly,=
 as the dam was two or=20

three feet lower than the old one, and had, besides, a sag in the middle. A=
 fatal mistake, if once=20

the water should begin to flow over the crest.  Another mistake was the obs=
truction of the spill-way=20

with an iron grating placed to retain the fish, without taking the precauti=
on at the same time to=20

enlarge the passage. This would have been expensive; and here, as in the co=
nstruction of the=20

dam, it is apparent that economy was consulted.  The sum of the mistakes ma=
de in the summer of=20

1880, and which culminated in the disaster of 1889, were, according to the =
report of a corps of=20

engineers, who made a careful survey, =E2=80=9Cthe lowering of the crest, t=
he dishing, or central sag of the=20

crest, the closing of the bottom culvert, and the obstruction of the spill-=
way.=E2=80=9D  The people of the=20

towns below had often discussed the possible rupture of the dam, but they s=
carcely feared it. Had=20

it not been built by men who understood their business; and might not these=
 be trusted, as men=20

trust their lives to the doctor and their souls to the priest? Had it not r=
esisted the flood of June,=20

1887--the highest ever known--and why then should it yield to any other? It=
 is certain that in the=20

towns below some were not thinking of the reservoir at all; while, in case =
it should give way, few=20

had formed the remotest conception of the possible disaster. On the very da=
y of the awful=20

calamity, when the streets and sidewalks of Johnstown were already under wa=
ter, a leading=20

citizen, to the question, =E2=80=9CHow much higher do you think the water w=
ill rise if the reservoir should=20

burst?=E2=80=9D answered quietly, =E2=80=9CAbout two feet;=E2=80=9D and we =
have not heard that any ventured to correct the=20



estimate.  Unsuspecting souls were they, and yet wholly like other men. Tho=
se long resident by=20

the volcano have ceased to fear its fires. Familiarity, even with danger, b=
reeds contempt. The evil=20

which still delays, we fondly believe will=20


_
introduced the English merchant to theatres, cafes, casinos, and more recon=
dite places, by way of=20

further evidence of their respectability, prudence, and commercial trustwor=
thiness.  Downey had=20

gone through all this circle of inquiry, and returned home to London, befor=
e Brown called upon him=20

to ask his opinion of the Frenchmen. It is a pity that the respectable Brit=
ish merchants, when they=20

gave Mr. Brown the testimonial by which he lost his goods or his money, did=
 not expose the bases=20

of their faith in Voleur and Enlever. They surely ought not to have conceal=
ed the security in their=20

possession, the arrest of their debtor, or a few other small incidents.  I =
thought the respectable=20

members of the house of Downey and Grabble deserved punishment as criminals=
. It appeared,=20

however, that no part of the criminal code could touch them. As yet, moreov=
er, it was, on the=20

authority of a lawyer of repute in the City of London, not possible to reco=
ver, by an action at law,=20

the value of the goods supplied to Voleur and Co. on the strength of their =
English reference. But I=20

had not yet finished my investigations.  I soon after this alighted upon a =
grand discovery. I got hold=20

of all the confidential correspondence between M. Voleur and the English ma=
nager of their house.=20

This young man, who had been more sinned against than sinning, also assiste=
d me in tracing the=20

delinquencies of his masters, and their confederates or supporters.  The co=
rrespondence was=20

exceedingly interesting. M. Voleur, who was the principal correspondent, kn=
ew English as well as=20

his mother tongue, or he was entitled to rank among the highest of French _=
litterateurs_. The=20

pathos was fine. The letters had such passages as these: "We are in sore di=
stress for money."=20

"Buy goods any where; sell or dispose of them any how; and send us here to =
Paris the money, or=20

we are ruined quite." Then there were worldly maxims, that would have done =
credit to Captain=20

Barabbas Whitefeather, such as, "Pay no cash. It's a bad principle. Get eve=
ry thing on credit." The=20

most unique passages were, however, those in which the Frenchman explained =
to his English=20

agent how the trade-protection societies were to be managed, hoodwinked, or=
 bribed. In the=20

interests of trade I must, however, conceal this part of the swindle.  It n=
ow appeared to me that, by=20

gathering up all the items of fact, and uniting the written with the oral e=
vidence, my case against=20

Downey and Grabble was complete. A solicitor was consulted, and he took cou=
nsel's opinion on=20

the matter. That authority pronounced that the evidence would not sustain a=
 criminal prosecution,=20

and in truth Mr. Brown did not much care about that, to him, barren remedy.=
 He wanted to promote=20

the welfare of society in a mode that would recoup his loss. He wanted to c=
ompel Downey and=20

Grabble to pay the amount they had induced him, solely by their representat=
ions, to trust the=20

Frenchmen. In the way of even this there were, it was thought, some difficu=
lties.  That eminent old=20

lawyer, Lord dams know so little, why should simple townsmen be expected to=
 know more? Had=20

they guaged that reservoir, and did they know that up there in the mountain=
s were six hundred and=20

forty millions of cubic feet of water, enough to make a veritable Niagara, =
for more than half an=20

hour, ready to rush down upon them? Had they calculated the awful energy of=
 twenty millions of=20

tons of water falling four hundred and fifty feet in a progress of a dozen =
miles; and this progress=20

down a pent-up valley, in some places not more than three hundred feet in w=
idth? Had they=20

considered that the flow of a mountain of water, sixty feet high at startin=
g, must be far more rapid=20

on the top than at the bottom? That the base, entangled among obstructions,=
 and overspreading=20

them, would furnish to the water above, an inclined plane, smooth as glass,=
 along which it would=20

shoot with the speed of an arrow, to fall over the edge of the retarded wat=
er beneath, and furnish=20

in its turn a ready passage for the water above and behind? That in consequ=
ence of this law, the=20



flood would come not by a gradual rise, giving time for escape, but like a =
rolling mountain, to smite=20

with the impact of a falling asteroid, and crush in an instant everything i=
n its way? Had they=20

reflected that such a body of water would outrun the swiftest Paul Revere w=
ho might mount steed=20

to fly with the warning to the towns below? That to the doomed, the first a=
nnouncement of danger=20

would be the stroke of the destroyer? That to the living there would be abs=
olutely no more time for=20

flight than to the sinner, of preparation for judgment after Gabriel shall =
have blown his trumpet? It=20

is safe to say that few, if any, had even remotely conceived the possibilit=
ies in the case. Men learn=20

by experience, and even from experience they fail to learn; for the lesson =
of to-day is forgotten to-

morrow: and human heedlessness is perpetual.  The crest of the dam stood fo=
ur or five feet above=20

the spill-way. Towards noon of the 31st, persons on the watch saw the water=
 of the reservoir rising=20

at the rate of a foot an hour. Meanwhile a rumor had spread that the dam wa=
s leaking, and this=20

attracted other observers. Some declared that jets of water were leaping fr=
om the lower side to a=20

distance of thirty feet. Somewhere about half-past two o=E2=80=99clock wate=
r began to run over the top.=20

The structure was then evidently doomed; for, though riprapped with stone o=
n both slopes, no=20

rampart of earth could long withstand the abrasion of a torrent running ove=
r its crest, and down its=20

lower face. A South Fork pastor reached the spot at ten minutes before thre=
e. A foot of water was=20

then running over the dam. A few minutes later a break was made =E2=80=9Cla=
rge enough to admit the=20

passage of a train of cars;=E2=80=9D then presently the whole thing dissolv=
ed almost instantly, like a=20

phantom. A breach was made four hundred and twenty-nine feet wide clean dow=
n to the bottom,=20

and with the noise of seven thunders and a tread that shook the hills like =
a young earthquake, out=20

rushed a mountain=20


_
at the pains to provide a statutory immunity for people like Downey and Gra=
bble. Mr. Brown, as an=20

Englishman, ought to have known the laws of his country--it is presumed tha=
t every man has all=20

the written and the unwritten, the common, the civil, and the criminal code=
s engraven on the=20

tablets of his memory--but Mr. Brown did not know it was requisite for his =
safety that the many=20

representations of the English firm should be written down in unblushing in=
k. Even if he had known=20

so much as was requisite for his security, he might have relied upon the mi=
staken supposition that=20

Downey and Grabble were truthful men.  In the hope that this case had featu=
res which took it from=20

under the mischievous aegis of Lord Tenterden, in reliance upon a notion th=
at Downey and=20

Grabble would not dare to allow the cause to reach a public trial, and also=
 prepared to risk=20

something in the interest of the mercantile community, Mr. Brown brought hi=
s action against these=20

"respectable" men. It cost him something, did this resolution. He had to em=
ploy first-rate counsel,=20

whose fees were not small. The cause was defended. Downey and Co. knew that=
 this was but one=20

of a series of claims, which, under the like circumstances, might arise aga=
inst them. At the trial all=20

the facts I have mentioned were clearly established. The learned counsel wh=
o led the spectator=20

could only gasp, =E2=80=9CGod have mercy on the people in the vale below.=
=E2=80=9D Rushing onward a mile in=20

three minutes, or as some have claimed, twice or thrice as fast, in an inst=
ant down went a mill, two=20

houses and some barns, up went an iron bridge tossed like a thing of straw,=
 and a moment later=20

the flood was at South Fork. Two trains, a passenger and a freight, detaine=
d by a wash-out further=20

up the road, were standing at the station. Warned by the awful roar, the pa=
ssenger train sprang=20

out just in time to save the lives of the people on board. The engineer of =
the freight, seeing it=20

impossible to move with his heavy train, unhitched the locomotive, opened t=
he throttle-valve, and=20

with the fireman, flew for life. The seething mountain leaped on the train =
and dragged it away,=20

regardless  [Illustration: THE BROKEN DAM.]  of two brakemen, who surrender=
ed their lives. The=20

village of South Fork, standing in the angle above the junction of two stre=
ams, and on high ground,=20

was comparatively unharmed, though two lives and considerable property were=
 destroyed.  On=20

rushed the river down a valley, having from the lake to Johnstown an averag=
e grade of more than=20

thirty feet in a mile. A mile and a quarter below South Fork the river stri=
kes at right angles a=20

projecting cliff. The baffled stream makes a detour of two miles and return=
s=20


_
just severity, the conduct of the defendants. The judge, the jury, and the =
spectators would have=20

been glad to see financial equity enforced against the wrong-doers. At the =
conclusion of the=20

evidence Mr. Brown was able to offer, the counsel for the defendants argued=
 that he had no case=20

to itself, having accomplished an absolute advance of no more than seventy-=
five feet. A railroad=20

cut no longer than this quits the river above, then regains and crosses it =
by a viaduct below. The=20

railroad bed at the upper end of the cut is twenty feet above the stream, w=
hile at the lower end it=20


_
attempt to deny the merits of the plaintiff's case. He could not answer the=
 damnatory facts. Upon=20

the dry technical question, whether or not Messrs. Downey and Grabble were =
shielded by the=20

obnoxious statute, there was a long argument, which ended in the judge's ex=
pressing an opinion=20

that he was afraid they were; and the plaintiff was nonsuited.  The respect=
able house of Downey=20

and Grabble did not long survive its twenty feet deep and forty feet above =
the river-bed, flowing=20

through the cut, the other part following the channel around. When this lat=
ter portion returning=20

struck the cliff at the lower end of the cut, the water rose to the enormou=
s height of one hundred=20

and twenty-five feet. From this point the monster, towering to heaven, and =
like a =E2=80=9Cwild beast=20

dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly,=E2=80=9D and ravening for pre=
y,=20
