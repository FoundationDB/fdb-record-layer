dracaena marginata struck at it as they would at the head of a tyrant--and =
the tyrant cowered, cringed, made terms--he was frightened at the wrath of =
the people! That is what happened in Paris! That is what must happen in Nan=
tes. The chateau of the duc de Kernogan is our Bastille! Let us strike at i=
t start fresh, maybe overtake me.  Jess will be sure to waken you in--"  He=
 stopped, for his brother's head had bent slowly forward while he was speak=
ing, and now rested on his arms on the table.  The worn-out man was sound a=
sleep.  "Just leave him, Peter, and be off wi' the dogs," dracaena marginat=

the bone, our bodies till they break so that they may wallow in their pleas=
ures and their luxuries!=20

Strike, I say!" he reiterated while his eyes glowed and his breath came and=
 went through his throat=20

with a hissing sound. "Strike! as the men and women struck in Paris on that=
 great day in July. To=20

them the Bastille without rest."  He looked in his brother's face anxiously=
, for Dan had seated=20

himself once more to his food, but seemed unable to deal with it properly. =
"Why, you've got the=20

knife and fork in the wrong hands, Dan!  You _must_ have an hour's rest bef=
ore we start."=20

"Impossible," returned the other with a dazed look, as he seized a mug of w=
ater and drank it off.=20

"An hour's delay may mean death to Elspie and old Duncan McKay."  "But let =
_me_ start off at=20

once," returned Peter, eagerly.  "I've a pretty good guess, from your descr=
iption, where you left=20

them.  Besides, the gale is not so bad now.=20
