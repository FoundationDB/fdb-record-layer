From the hills on either side, the picture assumes its most perfect form. Cities, meadows, 

orchards, vineyards, hop fields, vegetable gardens, alfalfa farms, corn fields, and prairies, bisected 

and crisscrossed by railroads, highways, canals, and rivers, protected by the brown hills near by 

and watched over by the mountains in the distance, supply composition for pictures that in detail 

and variety must discourage all competition.   THE WENATCHEE VALLEY.  Equally beautiful but 

of smaller dimensions is the Wenatchee Valley, reaching from the Columbia well written to that 

bank where he left the money, and asked them to forward the letters if he has left any address. 

I've told him exactly where we are and what we propose to do. Beyond the bare facts of Fay's 

death--I told him all about her illness as dispassionately as I could--I've never reproached him or 

said anything cruel. You see, the man is down and out; though Mr. Ledgard always declared he 

had any amount of mysterious wires to pull. Yet, I can't help wondering whether he is ill 

somewhere, with no money and no friends, in some dreadful native quarter."

This, too, was a desolate brown slope until the effects of irrigation were felt on its rich volcanic ash 

soil. After that only ten years were necessary to convert it into a garden of dazzling splendor. 

Instead of the forlorn looking sagebrush, a maze of orchards, extending up the valley and 

ascending the hills, presents in springtime a solid mass of blossoms, varying from purest white to 

daintiest shades of pink. Serpentining along the hill sides, as if protecting the gardens below, are 

the great viaducts, conducting the precious waters that irrigate the land; while dodging from one 

side of the vale to the other, or paralleling the Great Northern Railroad, the Wenatchee river 

hastens onward towards the Columbia.  The north, south, and west are guarded by forest-covered 

hills, spurs of the Cascades, over which many trails lead to charming mountain lakes and streams, 

where summer homes are maintained, and game awaits the hunter. The east opens up toward the 

wheat fields of the Big Bend, while  "What about the money in the bank, then? Did you use it?" 

Jan blushed. "No, I couldn't bear to touch his money ... Mr. Ledgard said it was idiotic...."  "So it 

was; it was Fay's money, not his. For all your good sense, Jan, sometimes you're sentimental as a 

schoolgirl."  "I daresay it was stupid, and I didn't dare to tell Mr. Ledgard I'd left it," Jan said 

humbly; "but I felt that perhaps that money might help him if things got very desperate; I left it in 

his name and a letter telling him I had done so ... I didn't _give_ him any money...."  "It was 

precisely the same thing."  "And he may never have got the letter."  "I hope he hasn't."  "Oh, Meg, I 

do so hate uncertainty. I'd rather know the worst. I always have the foreboding that he will 

suddenly turn up at Wren's End and threaten to take the children away ... and get money out of 

me that way ... and there's none to spare...."  "Jan, you've got into a thoroughly nervous, 

pessimistic state about Hugo. Why in the world should he _want_

Columbia River Valley to the north and south is tributary and joins in all the enterprises of the 

district. Every tiny tributary stream in the vicinity marks the location of a peaceful home supported 

in affluence by successful fruit culture or gardening.  Within this valley are several prosperous 

cities, including Wenatchee, the metropolis of north central Washington, with a population of in his 

way, and wherever he put them he'd have to pay _something_. You know very well his people 

wouldn't keep them for nothing, even if he were fool enough (for the sake of blackmailing you) to 

threaten to place them there. His sisters wouldn't--not for nothing. What did Fay say about his 

sisters? I remember one came to the wedding, but she has left no impression on my mind. He has 

two,
