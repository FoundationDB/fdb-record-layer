down and slept; here he promises himself that he will lie down "in peace;" =
and not only so, but that=20

at once on his lying down he will sleep--kept awake by no anxieties, by no =
bitter thoughts, but,=20

homeless and in danger as he is, will close his eyes, like a tired child, w=
ithout a care or a fear, and=20

forthwith sleep, with the pressure and the protection of his Father's arm a=
bout him.  This psalm=20

sounds again the glad trustful strain which has slumbered in his harp-strin=
gs ever since the happy=20

old days of his early trials, and is re-awakened as the rude blast of calam=
ity sweeps through them=20

once more.  The sixty-third psalm is by the superscription referred to the =
time when David was "in=20

the wilderness of Judah," which has led many readers to think of his long s=
tay there during Saul's=20

persecution. But the psalm certainly belongs to the period of his reign, as=
 is obvious from its=20

words, "_The king_ shall rejoice in God." It must therefore belong to his b=
rief sojourn in the same=20

wilderness on his flight to Mahanaim, when, as we read in 2 Sam., "The peop=
le were weary and=20

hungry and thirsty in the wilderness." There is a beautiful progress of tho=
ught in it, which is very=20

obvious if we notice the triple occurrence of the words "my soul," and thei=
r various connections--

"my soul thirsteth," "my soul is satisfied," "my soul followeth hard after =
Thee;" or, in other words,=20

the psalm is a transcript of the passage of a believing soul from longing t=
hrough fruition to firm=20

trust, in which it is sustained by the right hand of God.  The first of the=
se emotions, which is so=20

natural to the fugitive in his sorrows, is expressed with singular poetic b=
eauty in language=20

borrowed from the ashen grey monotony of the waterless land in which he was=
. One of our most=20

accurate and least imaginative travellers describes it thus: "There were no=
 signs of vegetation,=20

with the exception of a few reeds and rushes, and here and there a tamarisk=
." This lonely land,=20

cracked with drought, as if gaping with chapped lips for the rain that come=
s not, is the image of his=20

painful yearning for the Fountain of living waters. As his men plodded alon=
g over the burning marl,=20

fainting for thirst and finding nothing in the dry torrent beds, so he long=
ed for the refreshment of=20

that gracious presence. Then he remembers how in happier days he had had th=
e same desires,=20

and they had been satisfied in the tabernacle. Probably the words should re=
ad, "Thus in the=20

sanctuary have I gazed upon Thee, to see Thy  "You must be a simpleton to d=
o things and not=20

know why, mustn't you?" said Polly.  In spite of which reproof, he looked a=
t the child again,=20

intently, as she bent her head over her card-structure, her rich curls shad=
ing her face. "It is=20

impossible," he thought, "that I can ever have seen this pretty baby before=
.  Can I have dreamed=20

of her?  In some sorrowful dream?"  He could make nothing of it.  So he wen=
t into the building=20

trade as a journeyman under Polly, and they built three stories high, four =
stories high: even five.  "I=20

say.  Who do you think is coming?" asked Polly, rubbing her eyes after tea.=
  He guessed: "The=20

waiter?"  "No," said Polly, "the dustman.  I am getting sleepy."  A new emb=
arrassment for Barbox=20

Brothers!  "I don't think I am going to be fetched to-night," said Polly; "=
what do you think?"  He=20

thought not, either.  After another quarter of an hour, the dustman not mer=
ely impending but=20

actually arriving, recourse was had to the Constantinopolitan chambermaid: =
who cheerily=20

undertook that the child should sleep in a comfortable and wholesome room, =
which she herself=20

would share.  "And I know you will be careful, won't you," said Barbox Brot=
hers, as a new fear=20

dawned upon him, "that she don't fall out of bed."  Polly found this so hig=
hly entertaining that she=20

was under the necessity of clutching him round the neck with both arms as h=
e sat on his footstool=20

picking up the cards, and rocking him to and fro, with her dimpled chin on =
his shoulder.  "O what a=20

coward you are, ain't you!" said Polly.  "Do _you_ fall out of bed?"  "N--n=
ot generally, Polly."  "No=20



more do I."  With that, Polly gave him a reassuring hug or two to keep him =
going, and then giving=20

that confiding mite of a hand of hers to be swallowed up in the hand of the=
 Constantinopolitan=20

chambermaid, trotted off, chattering, without a vestige of anxiety.  He loo=
ked after her, had the=20

screen removed and the table and chairs replaced, and still looked after he=
r.  He paced the room=20

for half an hour.  "A most engaging little creature, but it's not that.  A =
most winning little voice, but=20

it's not that.  That has much to do with it, but there is something more.  =
How can it be that I seem=20

to know this child?  What was it she imperfectly recalled to me when I felt=
 her touch in the street,=20

and, looking down at her, saw her looking up at me?"  "Mr. Jackson!"  With =
a start he turned=20

towards the sound of the subdued voice, and saw his answer standing at the =
door.  "O Mr.=20

Jackson, do not be=20


_
the sanctuary his longing had been the same, but then he had been able to b=
ehold the symbol=20

which bore the name, "the glory,"--and now he wanders far from it. How beau=
tifully this regretful=20

sense of absence from and pining after the ark is illustrated by those inim=
itably pathetic words of=20

the fugitive's answer to to me, I beseech you."  "You are Polly's mother." =
 "Yes."  Yes.  Polly=20

herself might come to this, one day.  As you see what the rose was, in its =
faded leaves; as you see=20

what the summer growth of the woods was, in their wintry branches; so Polly=
 might be traced, one=20

day, in a care-worn woman like this, with her=20


_
share his exile. "And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God i=
nto the city. If I find=20

favour in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me again, and show me both it=
 and His habitation."=20

The fulfilment is cotemporaneous with the desire. The swiftness of the answ=
er is beautifully=20

indicated in the quick turn with which the psalm were the ashes of a dead f=
ire that had once=20

burned bright.  This was the woman he had loved.  This was the woman he had=
 lost.  Such had=20

been the constancy of his imagination to her, so had Time spared her under =
its withholding, that=20

now, seeing how roughly the inexorable hand had struck her, his soul was fi=
lled with pity and=20

amazement.=20


_
passes from plaintive longing to exuberant rapture of fruition. In the one =
breath "my soul thirsteth;"=20

in the next, "my soul is satisfied"--as when in tropical lands the rain com=
es, and in a day or two=20

what had been baked earth is rich meadow, and the dry torrent-beds, where t=
he white stones=20

glistered in the sunshine, foam with rushing waters and are edged with budd=
ing willows. The=20

fulness of satisfaction when God fills the soul is vividly expressed in the=
 familiar image of the feast=20

of "marrow and fatness," on which he banquets even while hungry in the dese=
rt. The abundant=20

delights of fellowship with God make him insensible to external privations,=
 are drink for him thirsty,=20

food for his hunger, a home in  He led her to a chair, and stood leaning on=
 a corner of the=20

chimney-piece, with his head resting on his hand, and his face half averted=
.  "Did you see me in=20

the street, and show me to your child?" he asked.  "Yes."  "Is the little c=
reature, then, a party to=20

deceit?"  "I hope there is no deceit.  I said to her, 'We have lost our way=
, and I must try to find=20

mine by myself.  Go to that gentleman and tell him you are lost.  You shall=
 be fetched by-and-by.'=20

Perhaps you have not thought how very young she is?"  "She is very self-rel=
iant."  "Perhaps=20

because she is so young?"  He asked, after a short pause, "Why did you do t=
his?"  "O Mr.=20

Jackson, do you ask me?  In the hope that you might see something in my=20
