is also not ineffectual to build reservoirs at intervals of 24,000 feet, so=
 that if a break occurs=20

anywhere, it will not completely ruin the whole work, and the place where i=

easily be found; but such reservoirs should not be built at a descent, nor =
in the plane of a venter,=20

nor at risings, nor anywhere in valleys, but only where there is an unbroke=
n level.  8. But if we wish=20

to spend less money, we must proceed as follows. Clay pipes with a skin at =
least two digits thick=20

should be made, but these pipes should be tongued at one end so that they c=
an fit into and join=20

one another. Their joints must be coated with quicklime mixed with oil, and=
 at the angles of the=20

level of the venter a piece of red tufa stone, with a hole bored through it=
, must be placed right at=20

the elbow, so that the last length of pipe used in the descent is jointed i=
nto the stone, and also the=20

first length of the level of the venter; similarly at the hill on the oppos=
ite side the last length of the=20

instance--and give your room to the valet? What do you say?"  We gave our r=

living in the lodge was a great deal more free than in the house, under mot=
her's eye.  "It's a=20

nuisance, and that's a fact!" said mother. "Brother says he won't have dinn=
er in the middle of the=20

day, but between six and seven, as they do in Petersburg. I am simply distr=
acted with worry! By=20

seven o'clock the dinner will be done to rags in the oven. Really, men don'=

about housekeeping, though they have so much intellect. Oh, dear! we shall =
have to cook two=20

dinners every day! You will have dinner at midday as before, children, whil=
e your poor old mother=20

has to wait till seven, for the sake of her brother."  Then my mother heave=

try and please my uncle, whose coming was a piece of luck for me for which =
we must thank God,=20

and hurried off to the kitchen. Pobyedimsky and I moved into the lodge the =
same day. We were=20

installed in a room which formed the passage from the entry to the bailiff'=
s bedroom.  Contrary to=20

my expectations, life went on just as before, drearily and monotonously, in=
 spite of my uncle's=20

arrival and our move into new quarters. We were excused lessons=20
