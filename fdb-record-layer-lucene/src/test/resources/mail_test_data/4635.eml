 The famous "Four," the seats of learning in old Egypt, are more historical=

 of Occult numbers. It was in Memphis that Orpheus popularized his too-abst=

Master, or was an incarnation of one of the "Gods."  The later royal privil=
ege descended to our=20

Fifth Race kings through the kings of Egypt. The latter were all initiated =
into the mysteries of=20

medicine, and they healed the sick, even when, owing to the terrible trials=
 and labours of final=20

Initiation, they were unable to become full Hierophants. They were healers =
by privilege and by=20

tradition, and were assisted in the healing his lips, to hear him say, 'Com=
e, juice of the grape, and=20

chase away my sorrows.' And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the=
 neck of a bottle!=20

There was no one like him for that."  "And now," replied D'Artagnan, "behol=

awaits us. This noble gentleman with his lofty glance, this handsome cavali=

_
themselves were ignorant of Occult curative Science. So also in far later h=
istorical times we find=20

Pyrrhus curing the sick by simply touching them with his foot; Vespasian an=

to pronounce a few words taught to them by their Hierophants, in order to r=
estore sight to the blind=20

h is known of the=20

Priests of Egypt and of the ancient Brahmans, corroborated as it is by all =
the ancient classics and=20

historical writers, gives us the right to believe in that which is only tra=
