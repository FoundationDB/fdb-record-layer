and the Lake Chelan canyon, as well as to numerous other places of interest=

Captain Middleton went back into the flat with the children, showing no dis=
position to go away, and=20

Jan could hardly do less than ask him to share the tea she had laid in the =
dining-room.  There he=20

got a shock, for Meg came to tea in her cap and apron.  Out of doors she wo=
re a long, warm coat=20

that entirely covered the green linen frock, and a little round fur hat. Th=
is last was a concession to=20

Jan, who hated the extinguisher. So Meg looked very much like any other gir=
l. A little younger,=20

perhaps, than any young woman of twenty-five has any business to look, but =
pretty in her queer,=20

compelling way.  That she looked even prettier in her uniform Captain Middl=
eton would have been=20

the first to=20


_
through the Palouse to the Snake River and Walla Walla country. Transportat=
ion leads from there=20

direct to the Columbia River, and the Yakima and Kittitas valleys. The Hors=
e Heaven may be=20

reached from Kennewick and Pasco, or from Prosser.  [Illustration: _Copyrig=

Palouse, Snake River, Walla Walla, Yakima, and Kittitas valleys, from Ellen=
sburg a scenic=20

overland route may be taken direct for Wenatchee, whence a loop may be made=
 to include Lake=20

Chelan and the Okanogan Highlands, the Big Bend and the Spokane Country.   =
THE YAKIMA=20

VALLEY.  Broadly speaking, the Yakima Valley includes all the rich territor=
y tributary to the Yakima=20

River, reaching from Lakes Keechelus and Kachees, its sources in the Cascad=
es, to the=20

Columbia--a total distance of nearly 175 miles with a range of altitude, at=
 the water's edge, varying=20

from 2,250 down to 340 feet. It embraces, besides the Yakima Valley proper,=
 the Kittitas and a=20

number of minor valleys, including the Naches, the Ahtanum, the Cowiche, th=
e Selah, the Wenas,=20

the Satus and the Toppenish. These last two belong to the rich country just=
 south of "Union Gap,"=20

where Sunnyside and Toppenish are located, two enterprising cities, vieing =
for supremacy over=20

the rich south half of Yakima county. Further south is Prosser, county seat=
 of Benton county.=20

Above the Gap is North Yakima with a population of 18,000, the metropolis o=
f the region and=20

home of the State Fair; while Ellensburg, with 6,500 people, is Queen of th=
e Kittitas Valley. The=20

south half of Yakima county constitutes the Indian Reservation where the Ya=
kima Tribes dwell=20

peaceably by the side of the whites, tilling the soil and occasionally ente=
rtaining the people with=20

many a "Round Up," or Wild West Show. At Fort Simcoe is their school, deser=
ving of a visit from=20

anyone interested.  [Illustration: THE YAKIMA VALLEY--MOUNT to him somethin=
g incongruous=20

and wrong for a girl with a smile like that to be anybody's nursemaid.  To =
be sure, Miss Ross was=20

a brick, and this queer little servant of hers called her by her Christian =
name and contradicted her=20

flatly twice in the course of tea. Miss Morton certainly did not seem to be=
 downtrodden ... but she=20

wore a cap and an apron--a very becoming Quakerish cap ... without any stri=
ngs ... and--"it's a d---

-d shame," was the outcome of all Captain Middleton's reflections.  "Would =
the man never go?"=20

Jan wondered, when after a prolonged and hilarious tea he followed the enra=
ptured children back=20

to the drawing-room and did tricks with the fire-irons.  Meg had departed i=
n order to get things=20

ready for the night, and he hung on in the hope that she would return. Vain=
 hope; there was no=20

sign of her.  He told the children all about William Bloomsbury and exacted=
 promises that they=20

would love him very much. He discussed, with many interruptions from Fay, w=
ho wanted all his=20

attention, the entire countryside round about Wren's End; and, at last, as =
there seemed really no=20

chance of that extraordinary girl's return, he heaved his great length out =
of his chair and bade his=20

hostess a reluctant farewell several times over.  In the passage he caught =
sight of Meg going from=20

one room to another with her arms full of little garments.  "Ah," he cried,=
 striding towards her.=20

"Good night, Miss Morton. I hope we shall meet again soon," and he held out=
 his hand.  Meg=20

ignored the hand, her own arms were so full of clothes: "I'm afraid that's =
not likely," she said, with=20

unfeeling cheerfulness. "We all go down to the country on Monday."  "Yes, y=
es, I know. Jolly part=20

of the world it is, too. I expect I shall be thereabouts a good deal this s=
ummer, my relations=20

positively swarm in that county."  "Good-bye," said Meg, and turned to go. =
Jan stood at the end of=20

the passage, holding the door open.  "I say, Miss Morton, you'll try and li=
ke my William, won't=20

t was Friday evening,=20

the Indian mail was in, and there was a letter from Peter--the fourth since=
 her return.  "But you've=20

heard of him from Mr. Ledgard," Meg pointed out.  "Only that he had gone to=
 Karachi from=20

Bombay just before Fay died--surely he would see papers there. It seems so =
heartless never to=20

have written me a line--I can't believe it, somehow, even of Hugo--he must =
be ill or something."=20
