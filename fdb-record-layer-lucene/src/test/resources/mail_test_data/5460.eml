t an early hour just now. The incidents I have described took place during =
that portion of the year so obnoxious to plaintiffs and pleasant to defenda=
nts (always except debtors on bills of exchange, who come under the purview=

cers only remained on the poop-deck. The waves grew more violent.  For once=
 the bold men on shore were powerless. No boat could live in the surf, and =
there was no firing _
since the Monday night. His landlady was as uneasy about him as his master-=
-perhaps more so.=20

She was starting to make inquiries concerning him, when inquiries were made=
 of her on the=20

subject. The good woman, a widow, who was the mother of a family (all grown=
 up to man and=20

woman's estate, and off her hands), dreaded that some harm had come to her =
lodger. These=20

forebodings of evil took no definite shape,--that is to say, a hundred diff=
erent forms of peril,=20

misadventure, and suffering crowded so rapidly on the kind-hearted woman's =
brain, that they=20

became merged and confused; but her suspicions never traced the fact, nor a=
ny thing like the=20

reality. The master of the young man, so far unlike the landlady, was not t=
roubled by many=20

thoughts about his clerk. All that gentleman said or thought about him may =
be put into a few short=20

sentences. He said he was a blackguard, and that he should never have a cha=
racter from him;=20

that it was a rascally shame to leave him in the lurch, without the slighte=
st notice; that he ought to=20

be punished (as artisans are in the manufacturing districts) for neglecting=
 his work, and breaking=20

his contract for service. Yet, argued the master, "there are plenty of fish=
 in the sea as good as=20

were ever caught. I dare say I can get another clerk, after all, any day, a=
t 15_s._ per week, quite=20

as good as that fellow. When Mr. Thinshanks comes back whining for me to em=
ploy him, he'll find=20

that I won't, that's all. No, it isn't all either. I shall just tell him a =
bit of my mind as well. I'll kick him=20

out of my counting-house, and tell him to go to ----" Well, never mind wher=
e, my readers; it wasn't=20

Botany Bay, nor Woolwich, nor Portsmouth, nor Millbank, nor Pentonville, th=
at the metaphor or=20

expletive assigned as his destination. Perhaps your imagination, reader, wi=
ll spare me all excuse=20

for sullying my pages by mentioning the locality, which some original mind =
has said is not fit to=20

name or write to ears or eyes polite.  In Wednesday morning's _Times_ there=
 appeared an=20

advertisement, which informed the readers of the leading journal that Mr. C=
rapp wanted, as clerk,=20

a single young man, of good education, quick at accounts, who wrote a super=
ior hand, of=20

unquestionable sobriety, strict honesty, and enjoying one or two minor qual=
ities. These must must=20

be vouched by undeniable references. The salary offered by Mr. Crapp was 15=
_s._ per week.=20

Three hundred applicants wrote to J. C. (Mr. Crapp's initials), at the post=
-office adjacent to his=20

place of business, in the course of Wednesday. On Thursday morning the empl=
oyer selected from=20

the lot half a dozen letters, and saw as many young men that evening. On Fr=
iday an applicant who=20

had passed through "the ordeal by reference" whole and unscathed in body an=
d reputation, was=20

given the stool on which Mr. Thinshanks had been long perched with honour. =
 That day the new=20

clerk received a numerous body of commands. He had been called upon to sole=
mnly declare=20

before Mr. Crapp that he wasn't afraid of work; and the truth of such averm=
ent was tested, as far=20

as it could be, in a single day--on the Friday.  Among the numerous directi=
ons Mr. Crapp gave his=20

new clerk were instructions to write to Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid, polite=
ly asking the reason=20

why they had not acknowledged the receipt of the cheque for 50_l._ 4_s._ 1-=
1/2_d._, which had=20

been sent them in due course on the previous Monday afternoon?  This firm c=
arried on business in=20

the neighbourhood of Shoreditch. It did not take long for Mr. Thinshanks's =
successor to write that=20

and a dozen other letters of equal brevity, and it, with the others, was po=
sted by eleven o'clock on=20

Friday morning.  Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid were astonished. They had not =
received any such=20

cheque, although they had expected to receive one for such an amount from M=
r. Crapp. They also=20

knew that the cheque could not have been delivered at, and lost or mislaid =
in, their establishment.=20

The extreme regularity of all their proceedings, the elaborate system of ch=
eck and counter-check=20



which their genius had many years ago devised and set in motion, enabled th=
em to say at once=20

that the error or accident or wrong, of whatever kind it might be, was meas=
urably safe.  But near=20

ten o=E2=80=99clock, the situation became alarming again. Masses of floatin=
g wreckage struck the=20

_Trenton_, as it was lifted by a heavy wave, and carried away the rudder an=
d propeller. Her=20

anchors, unaided, would not keep her from the reef, or from fouling with th=
e other vessels in the=20

harbor.  The _Vandalia_ and the _Calliope_ were drifting toward the wreck o=
f the _Adler_. As the=20

_Vandalia_ endeavored to steam away, the iron prow of the Englishman arose =
high in the air and=20

fell with full force upon the _Vandalia=E2=80=99s_ port-quarter. The _Calli=
ope_ lost her jib-boom, and the=20

heavy timbers of the _Vandalia_ were shivered. Every man near the point of =
the collision was=20

thrown from his feet by the shock. Water was rushing through a great rent i=
n the cabin. It seemed=20

that the _Vandalia_ had received her death blow. The frightened men swarmed=
 from the hatches,=20

but presently returned to their posts.  At this crisis the Englishman essay=
ed a bold man=C5=93uvre.=20

Seeing that to remain where he was would be, in a few more moments, ruin to=
 the _Vandalia_, he=20

resolved to take all risks himself, and letting go all anchors, swung aroun=
d to the wind and=20

endeavored to put to sea. For a moment the vessel seemed stationary. Then t=
he tremendous=20

power of the propeller began to tell, and the vessel moved slowly forward i=
n the teeth of the storm.=20

Volumes of smoke poured from her funnels, and the ship groaned in every tim=
ber. Gradually it=20

became clear that she could escape from the harbor.  This is one of the mos=
t daring feats in the=20

naval annals. It was the one desperate chance to save the _Calliope_ and he=
r crew from certain=20

death. An accident to the machinery at this moment, or a slight change in t=
he direction of the wind=20

as she neared the narrow gate-way of the harbor, would have been fatal. Dow=
n in the fire room,=20

the men  [Illustration: THE CALLIOPE PUTTING TO SEA.]  worked as they never=
 had before. The=20

_Trenton_ lay close to the reef, and the _Calliope_ was compelled to pass b=
etween the two. The=20

flagship=E2=80=99s fires were out, and she could do nothing to save herself=
. Every man felt that a few=20

moments longer would find him a grave in the coral reef. Those on shore wer=
e watching with=20

intensest anxiety.  Just then a strange sound came, borne on the wind; a wi=
ld ringing cry from the=20

four hundred and fifty on board the _Trenton_. The Americans were cheering =
the _Calliope_.=20

Expecting death for themselves, they rejoiced that their friends might yet =
escape, and the heart of=20

every Englishman went out to the brave Americans who gave their parting tri=
bute to the Queen=E2=80=99s=20

ship.  There is something peculiarly touching in this incident. It is far a=
bove the _morituri te=20

salutamus_ of the gladiator in the arena. It was an expression of immortal =
courage; the dying=20

saluting the victor; the doomed saluting the saved; manhood distressed gree=
ting manhood=20

triumphant. The English seamen returned the cry. The _Calliope_ safely reac=
hed the sea. Her=20

commander afterward said: =E2=80=9CThose ringing cheers of the American fla=
gship pierced deep into my=20

heart, and I will ever remember that mighty outburst of fellow-feeling, whi=
ch I felt came from the=20

bottom of the hearts of the gallant admiral and his crew. Every man on boar=
d the _Calliope_ felt as=20

I did; it made us work to win. I can only say, God bless America and her no=
ble sailors.=E2=80=9D  Meanwhile=20

the _Vandalia_, seeing her doom certain, endeavored to reach the beach, but=
 being a much larger=20

vessel than the _Nipsic_, she could not come so near the shore. A blow from=
 a terrific wave in the=20

night had hurled the captain across his cabin and so injured him that he wa=
s unable to control his=20

vessel. His executive officer, Carlin, was in command, but the captain stoo=
d by his side to the last.=20

Carlin=E2=80=99s coolness and nerve were wonderful. He had been on duty thi=
rty consecutive hours, and=20



had not tasted food all that time.  In order to reach the beach, the _Vanda=
lia_ was compelled to=20

execute the same perilous feat that had been performed three hours before b=
y the _Nipsic_.=20

Slipping her anchors, she crowded on all steam and skirted the edge of the =
reef, finally dashing=20

into the soft sand two hundred yards from the shore=20


_
inside their doors. Further than this they did not care to inquire. The los=
s, if there was to be a loss,=20

would not be theirs. As a matter of fairness and good-will as between trade=
smen, Messrs.=20

Clockwork and Co. thought it their duty to inform Mr. Crapp as speedily as =
they could that his=20

cheque had never reached the firm in Shoreditch. A letter was immediately w=
ritten and=20

despatched to Mr. Crapp, apprising him of that untoward fact.  Mr. Crapp sa=
w at a glance, as any=20

fool might have done, that between the non-receipt of his cheque by Messrs.=
 Clockwork and Rigid=20

and the disappearance of Mr. Thinshanks there was a link. The money which o=
ught to have=20

passed from his bankers to the bankers of his correspondents was that link.=
 He had been robbed=20

of 50_l._ 4_s._ 1-1/2_d._ by that villain Thinshanks! Such base, black, vil=
e ingratitude, after the=20

kind manner in which he had treated that vagabond! He deserved to be hung, =
quoth his late=20

master, in token of the remnant of that same loving kindness of which he ha=
d just spoken.  Mr.=20

Crapp engines were stopped and the fires put out; all hands were ordered on=
 deck, and the vessel=20

swung around broadside to the waves.  At first, her position being supposed=
 safe, it was thought=20

the two hundred and forty men on board might well remain until the storm wa=
s over. The men=20

were scattered about the deck and forecastle, clinging to the guns, the mas=
ts, rigging and sides of=20

the ship. Within half an hour her real danger became apparent; she wallowed=
 lower and lower in=20

the yielding sand; more and more frequently the seas dashed over her, flood=
ing the hatchways=20

with water. Her boats were dashed from the davits and torn to pieces. It wa=
s attempted to fire lines=20

to the shore, but all her powder was ruined. The spray and mist arose in su=
ch masses from the=20

sides of the ship, that those on shore could hardly distinguish her positio=
n.  At this moment a brave=20

sailor volunteered to swim through the surf with a line, in the hope that h=
is comrades might be=20

rescued. It was a perilous task, as the water was filled with floating wrec=
kage.=20


_
expression of thanks, which, out of the frame of mind he then enjoyed, it w=
as hard to extract.  He=20

determined--although, as he said, it was a painful duty--to prosecute the v=
illain with the utmost=20

rigour of the law. He put on his hat, and, to speak exactly, he may be desc=
ribed as having rushed=20

to his attorney's office. That a cord to his body, he sprang overboard; an =
immense wave hurled=20

him against the side of the vessel and struck him senseless. He was drowned=
 almost within touch=20

of his comrades. Gradually the men were driven from the gun-deck. By noon i=
t was under water.=20

The heavy billows that swept over the ship lifted the men from their feet a=
