 THE surgical and medico-legal ideas of wounds are quite different, the lat=
ter including the former as well as _
request, according to the opinion of his council. Having received this answ=
er, she returned to the=20

h=C3=B4tel of Orleans, accompanied by the before-mentioned lords.  On the f=
ollowing Monday, the king=20

of France, by the advice of his parliament, resumed in court the county of =
Dreux, Chastel-Thierry,=20

and Mont d=E2=80=99Arcuelles, and all the lands which the king had given to=
 his brother for his life.  On the=20

Wednesday after St Thomas=E2=80=99s day, the duchess of Orleans, accompanie=
d by her youngest=20

son,=E2=80=94the queen of England, her daughter-in-law,=E2=80=94the chancel=
lor of Orleans, and others of her=20

council, with many knights and esquires, who had been of the household of t=
he late duke, all=20

clothed in black, came to the h=C3=B4tel of St Pol to have an audience of t=
he king. She found there the=20

king of Sicily, the dukes of Berry and Bourbon, the chancellor of France, a=
nd several others, who,=20

having demanded an audience for her of the king, instantly obtained it.  Sh=
e was led into the=20

presence by the count d=E2=80=99Alen=C3=A7on, and with many tears, and befo=
re all the princes, again=20

supplicated the king that he would do her justice on those who had traitoro=
usly murdered her lord=20

and husband, the late duke of Orleans. The whole manner of this deed she ca=
used to be declared=20

to the king by her advocate in the parliament; and the chancellor of Orlean=
s was by her side, who=20

repeated to the advocate word for word what she wished to have divulged.  S=
he had explained at=20

length the whole history of the murder: how he had been watched, and the ho=
ur and place where=20

the assassins had fallen on him; and how he had been betrayed by a false me=
ssage from his lord=20

and brother the king, giving him to understand that the king had sent for h=
im,=E2=80=94and ending with=20

declaring that this murder more nearly touched the king than any other pers=
on. The advocate of=20

the duchess concluded by saying, the king was bound to avenge the death of =
his brother, as well=20

in regard to the duchess and her children, from their proximity of blood, a=
s in respect to the=20

offence which had been committed against justice and his royal majesty.  Th=
e chancellor of=20

France, who was seated at the king=E2=80=99s feet, replied, with the advice=
 of the dukes and lords present,=20

that the king, having heard the detail of the murder of his brother, would,=
 as speedily as possible,=20

do strict and equal justice against the offenders. When the chancellor had =
said this, the king=20

himself spoke, and said, =E2=80=98Be it known to all, that the facts thus e=
xposed, relative to the death of our=20

only brother, affect us most sensibly, and we hold the offence as committed=
 against our own=20

proper person.=E2=80=99  Upon this the duchess, her son John, and the queen=
 of England, her daughter-in-

law, cast themselves on their knees before the king, and, with abundance of=
 tears, supplicated him=20

to remember to do good justice on the perpetrators of the murder of his bro=
ther. The king raised=20

them up, and, kissing them, again promised strict justice, and named a day =
for the enforcement of=20

it. After these words they took their leave, and returned to the h=C3=B4tel=
 of Orleans.  On the second=20

day ensuing, the king of France came from his palace to the chamber of parl=
iament, which had=20

been greatly adorned, and seated himself on the royal throne. He then publi=
shed an act, in the=20

presence of the dukes, princes, nobility, clergy, and commonalty of his rea=
lm, by which he=20

ordained, that should he die before the duke of Acquitaine was of lawful ag=
e, notwithstanding this=20

he should govern the kingdom,=E2=80=94and that all things should be conduct=
ed in his name by the three=20

estates of the realm, until he should be arrived at the proper age to take =
the government into his=20

own hands.  Should it happen that his eldest son should die before he came =
of age, he ordained=20

that his second son, the duke of Touraine, should succeed him; and in like =
manner that his third=20

son should succeed the duke of Touraine, on his death; but that until these=
 princes should be of=20

the proper age, the three estates should govern in their name.  These ordin=
ances were very=20



agreeable to the princes of the blood and council, and were confirmed by th=
em. On the third day of=20

January, the duchess of Orleans, for herself and children, did homage for t=
he county of Vertus,=20

and all the other lordships that had been held by her late husband. She too=
k her oaths of fealty to=20

the king himself, and, having taken her leave of him, quitted Paris a few d=
ays after, and returned=20

with her state to Blois.                                  CHAP. XXXVIII.   =
   THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY=20

ASSEMBLES A NUMBER OF HIS DEPENDANTS,         AT LILLE IN FLANDERS, TO A=20

COUNCIL, RESPECTING THE DEATH         OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.=E2=80=94HE GO=
ES TO=20

AMIENS, AND THENCE TO         PARIS.   When the duke of Burgundy was at Lil=
le, he called to=20

him the nobles, clerks, and others of his council, to have their opinion re=
specting the death of the=20

late duke of Orleans,=E2=80=94and he was greatly comforted by the advice th=
ey gave him. He went thence=20

to Ghent to his duchess, and there summoned the three estates of Flanders, =
to whom he caused=20

the counsellor, John de la Sancson, to explain publicly the reasons, articl=
e by article, why he had=20

caused the duke of Orleans to be put to death at Paris; and as he was desir=
ous that the whole=20

should be made as public as possible, he ordered copies to be given of his =
explanation to all who=20

might be desirous of having them. He then demanded, that they would afford =
him their aid, in case=20

any thing disagreeable should happen to him in consequence of what he had d=
one; and the=20

Flemings promised they would assist him willingly.  In like manner did thos=
e of Lille, Douay, and=20

the inhabitants of Artois, after they had heard the reasons for this death,=
 and the duke=E2=80=99s request of=20

assistance against all the world, except the king of France and his childre=
n. The reasons he=20

assigned for causing the duke of Orleans to be put to death were the same, =
or nearly the same, as=20

those of master John Petit, when, by command of the duke of Burgundy, he pu=
blicly harangued at=20

Paris, before the royal council, and which shall, hereafter, be very minute=
ly given.  During this=20

time, the king of Sicily and the duke of Berry sent messengers with letters=
 to the duke of Burgundy=20

at Lille, whither he was returned, to require that he would meet them witho=
ut fail at Amiens, on an=20

appointed day, which they made known to him, in order to confer and consult=
 together on what=20

was to be done respecting the death of the duke of Orleans.  The duke of Bu=
rgundy returned for=20

answer, by the messengers, that he would not fail to meet them; and, in con=
sequence, he=20

requested of the states of Flanders and Artois to lend him a sum of money, =
which was granted to=20

him.  He made grand preparations for his journey, and assembled a very cons=
iderable force.=20

When the day appointed approached, in company with his two brothers, the du=
ke of Brabant and=20

count of Nevers, with many other noblemen and gentry, to the amount of thre=
e thousand,=20

excellently armed, and attended by several of his council, he went from Arr=
as to Corbie, and, on=20

the appointed day, entered Amiens, and lodged at the house of a citizen cal=
led James de=20

Hanghart. He caused to be painted over the door of this house two lances,=
=E2=80=94the one with a sharp=20

pointed head, and the other with a blunt one,=E2=80=94which many of the nob=
les of his company said was=20

meant to signify, that he was prepared for war or peace, accordingly as it =
might be determined on.=20

The weather was exceedingly severe at this season, and the country was cove=
red with snow,=20

insomuch that the king of Sicily and the duke of Berry, accompanied by abou=
t two hundred horse,=20

on leaving Paris, were forced to employ great numbers of peasants with shov=
els to clear the road=20

for them. They arrived at Amiens on the day fixed upon; and the duke of Bur=
gundy, with his two=20

brothers, magnificently attended, went out of the town to meet them,=E2=80=
=94and mutual respects were=20

paid on each side.  The king of Sicily was lodged at the h=C3=B4tel of the =
bishop, and the duke of Berry=20



at St Martin les death in bodies found submersed in water. The following ar=
e the various changes=20

ordinarily seen at different periods of time, as estimated by Devergie, who=
 has especially=20

investigated the subject:  =3DFirst Four or Five Days.=3D=E2=80=94Little ch=
ange: rigor mortis may persist,=20

particularly if the water is cold.  =3DFourth or Fifth Day.=3D=E2=80=94Skin=
 of the ball of the thumb and little=20

finger, also the lateral surface of the fingers, begins to whiten. This whi=
tening gradually extends to=20

the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The skin of the face will app=
ear softened and of a=20

more faded white than the rest of the body.  =3DFifteenth Day.=3D=E2=80=94F=
ace slightly swollen and red; a=20

greenish spot begins to form on the neck and skin of the mid-sternum. The s=
kin of the hands and=20

feet is quite white and wrinkled. The subcutaneous cellular tissue of the t=
horax is reddish and the=20

upper part of the cortical substance of the brain of a greenish tint.  =3DA=
t One Month.=3D=E2=80=94The face is=20

reddish-brown, the eyelids and lips green and swollen, and the neck slightl=
y green. A greenish=20

discoloration is also seen over the upper and middle part of the sternum. T=
he skin is wrinkled. The=20

hair and nails still remain intact. The scrotum and penis are distended by =
gas. The lungs become=20

very emphysematous and overlap the heart.   SAPONIFICATION.  When the bodie=
s were=20

removed from the Cimeti=C3=A8re des Innocents in Paris, in 1786, Fourcray o=
bserved that many of them=20

had been converted into a substance which he termed ADIPOCERE. He gave it t=
his name=20

because it resembles both fat (_adeps_) and wax (_cera_). Under certain cir=
cumstances which will=20

be considered later, it is known to be a late product of the putrefactive p=
rocesses. Adipocere is a=20

substance of a cheese-like consistency, yellow or yellowish-brown in color,=
 and composed chiefly=20

of a mixture of the fatty acids. Chevreul has shown by analysis that it is =
a true ammoniacal soap,=20

but that when formed in water impregnated with lime a calcareous may be sub=
stituted for an=20

ammoniacal base. This may take place either in a body exposed to river-wate=
r or buried in a grave=20

wet by water containing calcium carbonate or sulphate. Saponification can o=
nly take place when=20

animal fat is in contact with nitrogenous matter. Neither fat nor fibrin wh=
en kept separate will=20

saponify. Skin deprived of all its fat will not be transformed into adipoce=
re.  Saponification=20

commences in the fat of the female breast, of the cheeks and other parts of=
 the body where large=20

accumulations of fat are found, such as around the kidneys and in the oment=
um. As fat is=20

distributed extensively throughout the body, nearly all parts may undergo t=
his transformation.=20

Taylor gives the following conditions as favorable to the change:  1. Bodie=
s of young persons,=20

because the fat is abundant and chiefly external.  2. Bodies of corpulent a=
dults.  3. Exposure of=20

bodies to the soil of water-closets.  4. The immersion of bodies in water, =
the change taking place=20

more rapidly in running than in stagnant water.  5. Humid soil, especially =
when bodies are placed=20

in it one upon the other. In this case the lowest of them is first changed.=
  When a body has been=20

completely saponified it may remain in this state for years. In one instanc=
e, after seventeen years=E2=80=99=20

burial many of the organs could still be recognized.  The time required for=
 saponification to take=20

place is sometimes of medico-legal importance. Three years are _usually_ ne=
cessary for bodies=20

buried in the earth. The change occurs more rapidly in water. Cases are rec=
orded where the body=20

of a new-born child was completely saponified in six weeks, and again, the =
change had=20

commenced in a body which had been in the water about four months; but thes=
e are unusual=20

cases.   DATA UPON WHICH OPINION AS TO TIME OF DEATH IS FORMED.  The change=
s=20

which take place in a body before putrefaction sets in may enable a medical=
 jurist to form an=20

opinion as to the probable time which has elapsed since death; yet it must =
be remembered, to=20



pronounce the time which has elapsed can only be done approximately, for ve=
ry many conditions=20

will have to be considered, which will vary in each individual case. The im=
portance of considering=20

the minutest detail is well illustrated by the death of Prince de Cond=C3=
=A9, Duke of Bourbon, who was=20

found dead in his bedroom in the chateau of St. Cyr. When discovered at 8 o=
=E2=80=99clock in the morning,=20

the deceased was found partly undressed, hanging by his cravat to one of th=
e window shutters.=20

The body was cold and the lower extremities rigid. As in asphyxia from hang=
ing the warmth of the=20

body is usually preserved longer than under common circumstances, viz., fro=
m twelve to fifteen=20

hours, before which period rigidity is seldom complete, the medical examine=
r inferred that the=20

deceased must have died very soon after he retired to his bedroom on the pr=
evious night. As this=20

was proven to have been 10 P.M., it followed that only ten hours had elapse=
d=E2=80=94a short time for=20

cooling and rigidity to have taken place. It was thus rendered probable tha=
t the hanging took place=20

soon after deceased reached his bedroom. It was alleged that the duke had b=
een murdered, and=20

that his body had been afterward suspended to create a suspicion of suicide=
. The condition of the=20

body was, among other things, adverse to this opinion. From 10 to 12 o=E2=
=80=99clock it was proved there=20

were numerous attendants moving about near the duke=E2=80=99s apartments. T=
hey would have heard any=20

unusual noise the duke must have made in resisting his assailant. But no no=
ise was heard in the=20

room at that or any other time, and the presumption of this being a homicid=
e was thus strongly=20

rebutted.  =3DCadaveric rigidity=3D, while often it will aid to, is not a r=
eliable guide. When once it is=20

established it may remain two, three, or four days, according to the season=
 of the year and other=20

circumstances, and when it exists there is no rule by which it can be deter=
mined whether a body=20

has been in this state three hours or three days.  =3DPutrefaction=3D, whil=
e appearing on an average,=20

under a mean temperature, in from three to six days, is yet influenced by m=
any circumstances.=20

The heat and moisture of the surroundings, the age, sex, amount of flesh on=
 the body, mode of=20

death, position and coverings of body, all must be considered.  =3DThe temp=
erature=3D of the body=20

aids us, yet the retention of warmth by the abdominal viscera may be met wi=
th in a marked degree=20

twenty hours after death; in one case, personally known to me, the thermome=
ter registered 76=C2=B0 F.=20

seventeen hours after death.  The temperature of the body, its rigidity, an=
d the evidences of=20

putrefaction all furnish data from which we can estimate the _probable_ tim=
e which has elapsed=20

since death. It must be remembered that no one of them furnishes any positi=
ve proof.  Some=20

medical jurists have attempted to give a more definite character to these c=
hanges in the recently=20

dead body by dividing the interval between the stopping of the heart=E2=80=
=99s action and the beginning of=20

putrefaction into three periods. In the first, the warmth, pliability, and =
muscular irritability remain. In=20

the second, these conditions are lost and the body is cold and rigid. In th=
e third, the body is cold=20

and pliant, the muscles are relaxed, and the joints are flexible, the cadav=
eric rigidity having entirely=20

ceased.  There can be no doubt about the existence of these stages, but whe=
n we come to define=20

the precise time at which one begins and the other ends, we find it impossi=
ble. For example, the=20

first stage embraces a period which cannot be more closely defined than by =
stating that the person=20

may have been dead from a few minutes to twenty hours=E2=80=94a statement t=
oo vague to be upheld by=20

a counsel who defends a prisoner.  The changes which take place in these pe=
riods and the=20

average time they last have been given as follows by Devergie:  FIRST PERIO=
D, _Few Minutes to=20

Twenty Hours_.=E2=80=94Characterized by warmth of the body and general or p=
artial relaxation of the=20

voluntary muscles. To what portion of this period the special case belongs =
must be=20


_
left Paris, the duke of Bourbon[115], and his son the count de Clermont, mu=
ch grieved and=20

melancholy at the death of the duke of Orleans, did the same, and returned =
to the duchy of=20

Bourbon.  The king of Sicily and the duke of Berry had brought with them to=
 Amiens some of the=20

members of the royal council, to attempt, if possible, a reconciliation bet=
ween the two parties of=20

Orleans and Burgundy, for the advantage of the king and realm; but their at=
tempts were vain, for=20

duke John=E2=80=99s obstinancy was so great that he would no way consent to=
 ask the king=E2=80=99s pardon, nor=20

require any remission for what had passed. On the contrary, he maintained t=
hat the king and his=20

council should feel themselves much obliged to him for what he had done.  I=
n support of this=20

conduct, he had brought with him three doctors in theology, of high fame an=
d reputation in the=20

university of Paris,=E2=80=94namely, master John Petit, who afterwards argu=
ed it publicly at Paris, and two=20

others. They declared, in the presence of these two princes and the royal c=
ouncil at Amiens, that it=20

was lawful for the duke of Burgundy to act as he had done, in regard to the=
 duke of=20

Orleans,=E2=80=94adding, that if he had not done it, he would have been gre=
atly to blame; and they were=20

ready to maintain these two propositions against all who should say to the =
contrary.  When the two=20

parties had discussed this matter for some days, and when those sent by the=
 king perceived they=20

could not bring it to the conclusion wished for by and the degree of rigidi=
ty in the muscles, the neck=20

and the jaws commonly showing this condition first, the legs last. Warmth o=
f the body rarely=20

remains as long as twenty hours; in general it is sensibly cold in from ten=
 to twelve hours. During=20

this period the muscles are susceptible of contraction under the galvanic c=
urrent, and in the early=20

stage under the stimulus of blows.  SECOND PERIOD, _Ten Hours to Three Days=
_.=E2=80=94The body is=20

perfectly cold throughout and rigidity is well marked. The muscles no longe=
r respond to stimuli.=20

The duration of this period seems long, yet in one instance the body will b=
e found cold and rigid=20

nine hours after death. Again, cooling and rigidity may not come on for thr=
ee or four days.  THIRD=20

PERIOD, _Three to Eight Days_.=E2=80=94The body is perfectly cold. The limb=
s and trunk pliant and free=20

from cadaveric rigidity. The muscles are not capable of contracting. In sum=
mer this period is much=20

shorter; often it will come on before three days.  Putrefaction commences w=
hen a body is kept=20

under the most favorable conditions, in from six to twelve days, as a sligh=
t greenish discoloration=20

of the abdomen which gradually spreads throughout the body. The time at whi=
ch putrefaction=20

shows itself and the rapidity with which it advances is dependent upon so m=
any factors, many of=20

which it is impossible often for the medical examiner to ascertain, that to=
o much reliance must not=20

be placed upon it. Casper estimates the following to be the _average_=20


_
conference, and took their departure to Paris, having first signified to th=
e duke of Burgundy, in the=20

king=E2=80=99s name, that he must not return to Paris until he was so order=
ed.  Duke John, however, plainly=20

told them, he should pay no attention to this order; for that it was his in=
tention to go to Paris as=20

speedily as possible, to lay his charges and defence publicly before the ki=
ng and the Parisians. On=20

the morrow of the departure of the two princes, the duke of Burgundy, with =
his two brothers and=20

those who had accompanied them, returned to the town of Arras, with the exc=
eption of Waleran=20

count de St Pol, who remained for six days after them in Amiens.  When the =
king of Sicily and the=20

duke of Berry, with the lords of the council, were returned to Paris, and h=
ad made their report to=20

the king and princes, relating at length the answers which the duke of Burg=
undy had made, and=20

that he had asserted the king ought to requite him in various ways for havi=
ng caused the death=20

and murder of the duke of Orleans, they were much disgusted and astonished =
at the great=20

presumption and audacity of the duke of Burgundy.  It was talked of differe=
ntly according to the=20

bias of each party. Those of Orleans time given:  TWENTY-FOUR TO SEVENTY-TW=
O HOURS=20

after death a slight green color is visible over the centre of the abdomen.=

 of the abdomen=20

EIGHT TO TEN DAYS after death the discoloration becomes more intense, the f=

presenting a shade of reddish-green. The ramifications of the superficial v=

and limbs become very apparent. Finally the patches congregate. Gases begin=
 to be developed=20

and distend the abdomen and hollow organs and to form under the skin in the=
 subcutaneous and=20

intermuscular tissue. The cornea falls in and becomes concave. The sphincte=

of such extent as to=20

obliterate the features and to destroy the identity of the body. The epider=

he had had a great share in them.  The duke of Burgundy went shortly after =

FOURTH TO SIXTH MONTH after death the thorax and abdomen burst and the sutu=
