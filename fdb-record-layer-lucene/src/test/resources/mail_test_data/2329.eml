great Pralaya. It is nearly the same thing, idea for idea. Has Christianity=
 nothing of the kind? Let=20

the reader open any English _Bible_ and read chapter iii. of the _Second Ep=
istle of Peter_, and he=20

will find there the same ideas.       There shall come in the last days sco=
ffers, ... saying, Where is=20

the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all     things=
 continue as they were from=20

the beginning of the creation.     For this they willingly are ignorant of =
that by the word of God=20

the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water     and in=
 the water: whereby the=20

world that then was, being     overflowed with water, perished. But the hea=
vens and the earth,=20

which are now, by the same word are ... reserved unto fire, ... in     the =
which the heavens shall=20

pass away with a great noise, and the     elements shall melt with fervent =
heat.... Nevertheless we=20

... look     for new heavens and a new earth.   If the interpreters chose t=
o see in this a reference to=20

a creation, a deluge, and a promised coming of Christ, when they will live =
in a New Jerusalem in=20

heaven, that is no fault of Peter. What he meant was the destruction of the=
 Fifth Race and the=20

appearance of a new continent for the Sixth Race.  The Druids understood th=
e meaning of the Sun=20

in Taurus, therefore when all the fires were extinguished on the 1st of Nov=
ember their sacred and=20

inextinguishable fire remained alone to illumine the horizon like those of =
the Magi and the modern=20

Zoroastrian. And like the early Fifth Race and and sound, gave an indescrib=
able charm to his=20

smile.  Meanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were longing to b=
e alone, prepared to=20

depart, when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and ma=
ny persons said at=20

the same moment:  "Ah! 'tis Raoul, who is come home."  Athos, as the name o=
f Raoul was=20

pronounced, looked inquisitively at D'Artagnan, in order to see if any curi=
osity was painted on his=20

face. But D'Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechan=
ically when a fine=20

young man of fifteen years of age, dressed simply, but in perfect taste, en=
tered the room, raising,=20

as he came, his hat, adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers.  Nevert=
heless, D'Artagnan was=20

struck by the appearance of this new personage. It seemed to explain to him=
 the change in Athos;=20

a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this reg=
enerated existence.=20

He remained listening and gazing.  "Here you are, home again, Raoul," said =
the comte.  "Yes, sir,"=20

replied the youth, with deep respect, "and I have performed the commission =
that you gave me."=20

"But what's the matter, Raoul?" said Athos, very anxiously. "You are pale a=
nd agitated."  "Sir,"=20

replied the young man, "it is on account of an accident which has happened =
to our little neighbor."=20

"To Mademoiselle de la Valliere?" asked Athos, quickly.  "What is it?" crie=
d many persons present.=20

"She was walking with her nurse Marceline, in the place where the woodmen c=
ut the wood, when,=20

passing on horseback, I stopped. She saw me also and in=20


_
later Chaldaeans and Greeks, and again like the Christians (who do it to th=
is day without=20

suspecting the real meaning), they greeted the "Morning- Star," the beautif=
ul Venus-Lucifer.(504)=20

Strabo speaks of an island near Britannia where Ceres and Persephone were w=
orshipped with the=20

same rites as in Samothrace, and this was the sacred Ierna, where a perpetu=
al fire was lit. The=20

Druids believed in the rebirth of man, not, as Lucian explains,       That =
the same _Spirit_ shall=20

animate a new body, not here, but in     a different world,   but in a seri=
es of reincarnations in this=20

same world; for as Diodorus says, they declared that the souls of men after=
 a determinate period=20

would pass into other bodies.(505)  These tenets came to the Fifth Race Ary=
ans from their=20

ancestors of the Fourth Race, the Atlanteans. They piously preserved the te=
achings, while their=20

parent Root-Race, becoming with every generation more arrogant, owing to th=
e acquisition of=20

superhuman powers, were gradually approaching their end.      SECTION XXIX.=
 THE TRIAL OF=20

THE SUN INITIATE.   We will begin with the ancient Mysteries--those receive=
d from the=20

Atlanteans by the primitive Aryans--whose mental and intellectual state Pro=
fessor Max Mueller has=20

described with such a masterly hand, yet left so incomplete withal.       H=
e says: We have in it [in=20

the _Rig Veda_] a period of the     intellectual life of man to which there=
 is no parallel in any=20

other part of the world. In the hymns of the _Veda_ we see man     left to =
himself to solve the riddle=20

of this world.... He invokes     the gods around him, he praises, he worshi=
ps them. But still with=20

all these gods ... beneath him, and above him, the early poet     seems ill=
 at rest within himself.=20

There, too, in his own breast,     he has discovered a power that is never =
mute when he prays,=20

never     absent when he fears and trembles. It seems to inspire his prayer=
s     and yet to listen to=20

them; it seems to live in him, and yet to     support him and all had mount=
ed, the poor child fell and=20

was not able to rise again. I fear that she has badly sprained her ankle." =
 "Oh, heavens!" cried=20

Athos. "And her mother, Madame de Saint-Remy, have they yet told her of it?=
"  "No, sir, Madame=20

de Saint-Remy is at Blois with the Duchess of Orleans. I am afraid that wha=
t was first done was=20

unskillful, if not worse than useless. I am come, sir, to ask your advice."=
  "Send directly to Blois,=20

Raoul; or, rather, take horse and ride immediately yourself."  Raoul bowed.=
  "But where is Louise?"=20

asked the comte.  "I have brought her here, sir, and I have deposited her i=
n charge of Charlotte,=20

who, till better advice comes, has bathed the foot in cold well-water."  Th=
e guests now all took=20

leave of Athos, excepting the old Duc de Barbe, who, as an old friend of th=
e family of La Valliere,=20

went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage.=
  "You are right, sir," said=20

Athos. "She will be the sooner with her mother. As for you, Raoul, I am sur=
e it is your fault, some=20

giddiness or folly."  "No, sir, I assure you," muttered Raoul, "it is not."=
  "Oh, no, no, I declare it is=20

not!" cried the young girl, while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his bein=
g perhaps the cause of her=20

disaster.  "Nevertheless, Raoul, you must go to Blois and you must make you=
r excuses and mine=20

to Madame de Saint-Remy."  The youth looked pleased. He again took in his s=
trong arms the little=20

girl, whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder, and=
 placed her gently in=20

the carriage; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first-rate e=
squire, after bowing to=20

Athos and D'Artagnan, he went off close by the door of the carriage, on som=
ebody inside of which=20

his eyes were riveted.     14. The Castle of Bragelonne.   Whilst this scen=
e was going on,=20

D'Artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze. Everything had tur=
ned out so=20

differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder.  Athos=
, who had been=20

observing him and=20


_
mysterious power is "Brahman;" for brahman meant originally force,     will=
, wish, and the=20

propulsive power of creation. But this     impersonal brahman too, as soon =
as it is named, grows=20

into     something strange and divine. It ends by being one of many gods,  =
   one of the great triad,=20

worshipped to the present day. And still     the thought within him has no =
real name; that power=20

which is     nothing but itself, which supports the gods, the heavens, and =
    every living being,=20

floats before his mind, conceived but not     expressed. At last he calls i=
t "Atman," for atman,=20

originally     breath or spirit, comes to mean Self and Self alone, Self, w=
hether     divine or arm and=20

led him into the garden.  "Whilst supper is being prepared," he said, smili=
ng, "you will not, my=20

friend, be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up."  "Tr=
ue, monsieur le comte,"=20

replied D'Artagnan, who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great =
influence which=20

aristocracy had over him.  Athos smiled.  "First and foremost, dear D'Artag=
nan, we have no title=20

such as count here. When I call you 'chevalier,' it is in presenting you to=
 my guests, that they may=20

know who you are. But to you, D'Artagnan, I am, I hope, still dear Athos, y=
our comrade, your=20

friend. Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to=
 me than you were?"=20


_
whether One or All; but always Self, independent and free. "Who     has see=
n the first-born?" says=20

the poet, "when he who had no bones     (_i.e._, form) bore him that had bo=
nes? Where was the=20

life, the     blood, the Self of the world? Who went to ask this from  "The=
n let us be as we used to=20

be; let us be open with each other. You are surprised at what you see here?=
"  "Extremely."  "But=20

above all things, I am a marvel to you?"  "I confess it."  "I am still youn=
g, am I not? Should you not=20

have known me again, in spite of my=20


_
who knew it? (_Rig Veda_, I, 164, 4.) This idea of a divine Self     once e=
xpressed, everything else=20

must acknowledge its supremacy;     _Self_ is the Lord of all things; it is=
 the King of all things; as=20

all the spokes of a wheel are contained in the nave and     circumference, =
all things are contained=20

in this Self; all selves     are contained in  "On the contrary, I do not f=
ind you the same person at=20

all."  "I understand," cried Athos, with a gentle blush. "Everything, D'Art=
agnan, even folly, has its=20

limit."  "Then your means, it appears, are improved; you have a capital hou=
se--your own, I=20

presume? You have a park, and horses, servants."  Athos smiled.  "Yes, I in=
herited this little=20

property when I=20


_
This Self, the highest, the one, and the universal, was symbolised on the p=
lane of mortals by the=20

Sun, its life-giving effulgence being in its turn the emblem of the Soul--k=
illing the terrestrial=20

passions which have ever been an impediment to the re-union of the Unit Sel=
f (the Spirit) with the=20

All-Self. Hence the allegorical mystery, only the broad features of which m=
ay be given here. It was=20

enacted by the "Sons of the Fire-Mist" and of "Light." The second Sun (the =

twenty acres--twenty, comprising kitchen-gardens and a common. I have two h=
orses,--I do not=20

count my servant's bobtailed nag. My sporting dogs consist of two pointers,=
 two harriers and two=20

setters. But then all this extravagance is not for myself," added Athos, la=
ughing.  "Yes, I see, for=20

the young man Raoul," said D'Artagnan.  "You guess aright, my friend; this =
youth is an orphan,=20

deserted by his mother, who left him in the house of a poor country=20


_
as put on his trial, Vishvakarma, the Hierophant, cutting off seven of his =
beams, and replacing=20

them with a crown of brambles, when the "Sun" became Vikarttana, shorn of h=
is beams or rays.=20

After that, the Sun--enacted by a neophyte ready to be initiated--was made =
to descend into Patala,=20

the nether regions, on a trial of Tantalus. Coming out of it triumphant, he=
 emerged from this region=20

of lust and iniquity, to re-become Karmasakshin, witness of the Karma of me=
n,(507) and arose=20

once more triumphant in all the glory of brought him up. It is Raoul who ha=
s worked in me the=20

change you see; I was dried up like a miserable tree, isolated, attached to=
 nothing on earth; it was=20

only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back t=
o life. This child has=20

caused me to recover what I had lost. I had no longer any wish to live for =
myself, I have lived for=20

him. I have corrected the vices that I had; I have assumed the virtues that=
 I had not. Precept=20

something, but example more. I may be mistaken, but I believe that Raoul=20
