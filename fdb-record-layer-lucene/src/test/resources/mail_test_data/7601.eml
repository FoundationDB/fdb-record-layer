dracaena marginata     heaven! In the Phoenician mythology the Elohim are t=
he Seven sons     of Sydik [Melchizedek], identical with the Seven Kabiri, =
who in     Egypt are the Seven sons of Ptah, and the Seven Spirits of Ra in=
     _The Book of the Dead_; ... in America with the seven were seeking ser=
vants."  "But how is it that you know so much of these matters?"  "I know t=
hem because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies; because t=
hey fought against me; because I did them all the harm I could and they ret=
urned it to the best of dracaena marginata     heaven! In the Phoenician my=
thology the Elohim are the Seven sons     of Sydik [Melchizedek], identical=
 with the Seven Kabiri, who in     Egypt are the Seven sons of Ptah, and th=
e Seven Spirits of Ra in     _The Book of the Dead_; ... in America with th=
e seven were seeking servants."  "But how is it that you know so much of th=
ese matters?"  "I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that ti=
me my enemies; because they fought against me; because I did them all the h=
arm I could and they returned it to the best of _
and gross phallic religions. This plea confirms the suspicions entertained =
by some Christian=20

Mystics and many philosophical critics, that:  (_a_) Divine Power as an Abs=
olute Unity had never=20

anything more to do with the Biblical Jehovah and the "Lord God" than with =
any other Sephiroth or=20

Number. The Ain-Suph of the _Kabalah_ of Moses is as independent of any rel=
ation with the=20

created Gods as is Parabrahman Itself.  (_b_) The teachings veiled in the _=
Old Testament_ under=20

allegorical expressions are all copied from the Magical Texts of Babylonia,=
 by Esdras and others,=20

while the earlier Mosaic Text had its source in Egypt.  A few instances kno=
wn to almost all=20

Symbologists of note, and especially to the French Egyptologists, may help =
to prove the=20

statement. Furthermore, no ancient Hebrew Philosopher, Philo no more than t=
he Sadducees,=20

claimed, as do now the ignorant Christians, that the events in the _Bible_ =
should be taken literally.=20

Philo says most explicitly:       The verbal statements are fabulous [in th=
e Book of the Law]: it is=20

in the allegory that we shall find the truth.   Let us give a few instances=
, beginning with the latest=20

narrative, the Hebrew, and thus if possible trace the allegories to their o=
rigin.  1. Whence the=20

Creation in six days, the seventh day as day of rest, the seven Elohim,(362=
) and the division of=20

space into heaven and earth, in the first chapter of _Genesis_?  The divisi=
on of the vault above=20

from the Abyss, or Chaos, below is one of the first acts of creation or rat=
her of evolution, in every=20

cosmogony. Hermes in _Pymander_ speaks of a heaven seen in seven circles wi=
th seven Gods in=20

them. We examine the Assyrian tiles and find the same on them--the seven cr=
eative Gods busy=20

each in his own sphere. The cuneiform legends narrate how Bel prepared the =
seven mansions of=20

the Gods; how heaven was separated from the earth. In the Brahmanical alleg=
ory everything is=20

septenary, from the seven zones, or envelopes, of the Mundane Egg down to t=
he seven=20

continents, islands, seas, etc. The six days of the week and the seventh, t=
he Sabbath, are based=20

primarily on the seven creations of the Hindu Brahma, the seventh being tha=
t of man; and=20

secondarily on the number of generation. It is preeminently and most conspi=
cuously phallic. In the=20

Babylonian system the seventh day, or period, was that in which man and the=
 animals were=20

created.  2. The Elohim make a woman out of Adam's rib.(363) This process i=
s found in the=20

Magical Texts translated by G. Smith.       The seven Spirits bring forth t=
he woman from the loins=20

of the man,   explains Mr. Sayce in his _Hibbert Lectures_.(364)  The myste=
ry of the woman who=20

was made from the man is repeated in every national religion, and in Script=
ures far antedating the=20

Jewish. You find it in the Avestan fragments, in the Egyptian _Book of the =
Dead_, and finally in=20

Brahma, the male, separating from himself, as a female self, Vach, in whom =
he creates Viraj.  3.=20

The two Adams of the first and second chapters in _Genesis_ originated from=
 garbled exoteric=20

accounts coming from the Chaldaeans and the Egyptian Gnostics, revised late=
r from the Persian=20

traditions, most of which are old Aryan allegories. As Adam Kadmon is the s=
eventh creation,(365)=20

so the Adam of dust is the eighth; and in the Puranas one finds an eighth, =
the Anugraha creation,=20

and the Egyptian Gnostics had it. Irenaeus, complaining of the heretics, sa=
ys of the Gnostics:=20

Sometimes they will have him [man] to have been made on the sixth     day, =
and sometimes on the=20

eighth.(366)   The author of _The Hebrew and Other Creations_ writes:      =
 These two creations of=20

man on the sixth day and on the eighth were     those of the Adamic, or fle=
shly man, and of the=20

spiritual man, who     were known to Paul and the Gnostics as the first and=
 second Adam,     the=20

man of earth and the man of Heaven. Irenaeus also says they     insisted th=
at Moses began with=20

the Ogdoad of the Seven Powers and     their mother, Sophia (the old Kefa o=
f Egypt, who is the=20



_Living     Word_ at Ombos).(367)   Sophia is also Aditi with her seven son=
s.  One might go on=20

enumerating and tracing the Jewish "revelations" _ad infinitum_ to their or=
iginal sources, were it=20

not that the task is superfluous, since so much is already done in that dir=
ection by others--and=20

done thoroughly well, as in the case of Gerald Massey, who has sifted the s=
ubject to the very=20

bottom. Hundreds of volumes, treatises, and pamphlets are being written yea=
rly in defence of the=20

"divine-inspiration" claim for the _Bible_; but symbolical and archaeologic=
al research is coming to=20

the rescue of truth and fact--therefore of the Esoteric Doctrine--upsetting=
 every argument based on=20

faith and breaking it as an idol with feet of clay. A curious and learned b=
ook, _The Approaching=20

End of the Age_, by H. Grattan Guinness, professes to solve the mysteries o=
f the _Bible_=20

chronology and to prove thereby God's direct revelation to man. Among other=
 things its author=20

thinks that:       It is impossible to deny that _a septiform chronology wa=
s divinely     appointed_ in=20

the elaborate ritual of Judaism.   This statement is innocently accepted an=
d fervently believed in by=20

thousands and tens of thousands, only because they are ignorant of the Bibl=
es of other nations.=20

Two pages from a small pamphlet, a lecture by Mr. Gerald Massey,(368) so up=
set the arguments=20

and proofs of the enthusiastic Mr. Grattan Guinness, spread over 760 pages =
of small print, as to=20

prevent them from ever raising their heads any more. Mr. Massey treats of t=
he Fall, and says:=20

Here, as before, the genesis does not begin at the beginning.     There was=
 an earlier Fall than=20

that of the Primal Pair. In this     the number of those who failed and fel=
l was seven. We meet with=20

those seven in Egypt--eight with the Mother--where they are called     the =
"Children of Inertness,"=20

who were cast out from Am-Smen, the     Paradise of the Eight; also in a Ba=
bylonian legend of=20

Creation, as     the has wanted to employ me; so you see in what a situatio=
n I am."  "Make your=20

complaints known; that's my advice."  "Listen, Rochefort; let us make a com=
pact. We are friends,=20

are we not?"  "Egad! I bear the traces of our friendship--three slits or sl=
ashes from your sword."=20

"Well, if you should be restored to favor, don't forget me."  "On the honor=
 of a Rochefort; but you=20

must do the like for me."  "There's my hand,--I promise."  "Therefore, when=
ever you find any=20

opportunity of saying something in my behalf----"  "I shall say it, and you=
?"  "I shall do the same."=20

"Apropos, are we to speak of your friends also, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis?=
 or have you forgotten=20

them?"  "Almost."  "What has become of them?"  "I don't know; we separated,=
 as you know. They=20

are alive, that's all that I can say about them; from time to time I hear o=
f them indirectly, but in what=20

part of the world they are, devil take me if I know, No, on my honor, I hav=
e not a friend in the world=20

but you, Rochefort."  "And the illustrious--what's the name of the lad whom=
 I made a sergeant in=20

Piedmont's regiment?"  "Planchet!"  "The illustrious Planchet. What has bec=
ome of him?"  "I=20

shouldn't wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment. He =
married a woman who=20

keeps a confectioner's shop in the Rue des Lombards, for he's a lad who was=
 always fond of=20

sweetmeats; he's now a citizen of Paris. You'll see that that queer fellow =
will be a sheriff before I=20

shall be a captain."  "Come, dear D'Artagnan, look up a little! Courage! It=
 is when one is lowest on=20

the wheel of fortune that the merry-go-round wheels and rewards us. This ev=
ening your destiny=20

begins to change."  "Amen!" exclaimed D'Artagnan, stopping the carriage.  "=
What are you doing?"=20

asked Rochefort.  "We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting =
out of your carriage;=20

we are supposed not to know each other."  "You are right. Adieu."  "Au revo=
ir. Remember your=20

promise."  In five minutes the party entered the courtyard and D'Artagnan l=
ed the prisoner up the=20

great staircase and across the corridor and ante-chamber.  As they stopped =
at the door of the=20



cardinal's study, D'Artagnan was about to be announced when Rochefort slapp=
ed him on his=20

shoulder.  "D'Artagnan, let me confess to you what I've been thinking about=
 during the whole of my=20

drive, as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed=
 our path and looked at=20

you and your four men with fiery eyes."  "Speak out," answered D'Artagnan. =
 "I had only to cry out=20

'Help!' for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces, and then I sho=
uld have been free."=20

"Why didn't you do it?" asked the lieutenant.  "Come, come!" cried Rochefor=
t. "Did we not swear=20

friendship? Ah! had any one but you been there, I don't say----"  D'Artagna=
n bowed. "Is it possible=20

that Rochefort has become a better man than I am?" he said to himself. And =
he caused himself to=20

be announced to the minister.  "Let M. de Rochefort enter," said Mazarin, e=
agerly, on hearing their=20

names pronounced; "and beg M. d'Artagnan to wait; I shall have further need=
 of him."  These=20

words gave great joy to D'Artagnan. As he had said, it had been a long time=
 since any one had=20

needed him; and that demand for his services on the part of Mazarin seemed =
to him an auspicious=20

sign.  Rochefort, rendered suspicious and cautious by these words, entered =
the apartment, where=20

he found Mazarin sitting at the table, dressed in his ordinary garb and as =
one of the prelates of the=20

Church, his costume being similar to that of the abbes in that day, excepti=
ng that his scarf and=20

stockings were violet.  As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance towa=
rd Mazarin, which was=20

answered by one, equally furtive, from the minister.  There was little chan=
ge in the cardinal; still=20

dressed with sedulous care, his hair well arranged and curled, his person p=
erfumed, he looked,=20

owing to his extreme taste in dress, only half his age. But Rochefort, who =
had passed five years in=20

prison, had become old in the lapse of a few years; the dark locks of this =
estimable friend of the=20

defunct Cardinal Richelieu were now white; the deep bronze of his complexio=
n had been=20

succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility. As he gazed at him M=
azarin shook his=20

head slightly, as much as to say, "This is a man who does not appear to me =
fit for much."  After a=20

pause, which appeared an age to Rochefort, Mazarin took from a bundle of pa=
pers a letter, and=20

showing it to the count, he said:  "I find here a letter in which you sue f=
or liberty, Monsieur de=20

Rochefort. You are in prison, then?"  Rochefort trembled in every limb at t=
his question. "But I=20

thought," he said, "that your eminence knew that circumstance better than a=
ny one----"  "I? Oh no!=20

There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile, who were cooped up in th=
e time of Monsieur de=20

Richelieu; I don't even know their names."  "Yes, but in regard to myself, =
my lord, it cannot be so,=20

for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from y=
our eminence."  "You=20

think you were."  "I am certain of it."  "Ah, stay! I fancy I remember it. =
Did you not once refuse to=20

undertake a journey to Brussels for the queen?"  "Ah! ah!" exclaimed Rochef=
ort. "There is the true=20

reason! Idiot that I am, though I have been trying to find it out for five =
years, I never found it out."=20

"But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment. I merely ask you, =
did you not refuse to go=20

to Brussels for the queen, whilst you had consented to go there to do some =
service for the late=20

cardinal?"  "That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels. I wa=
s there at a fearful=20

moment. I was sent there to intercept a correspondence between Chalais and =
the archduke, and=20

even then, when I was discovered I was nearly torn to pieces. How could I, =
then, return to=20

Brussels? I should injure the queen instead of serving her."  "Well, since =
the best motives are=20

liable to misconstruction, the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a=20


_
the _Book of Revelation_; and the Seven Non-Sentient Powers, who     became=
 the Seven Rebel=20

Angels that made war in heaven. The Seven     Kronidae, described as the Se=
ven Watchers, who=20

in the beginning     were formed in the interior of heaven. The heaven, lik=
e a vault, also much to=20

complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal; yes, her majesty =
the queen----"  Rochefort=20

smiled contemptuously.  "Since I was a faithful servant, my lord, to Cardin=
al Richelieu during his=20

life, it stands to reason that now, after his death, I should=20


_
they extended or hollowed out; that which was not visible they     raised, =
and that which had no=20

_exit_ they opened; their work of     creation being exactly identical with=
 that of the Elohim in the=20

_Book of Genesis_. These are the Seven elemental Powers of space,     who w=
ere continued as=20

Seven Timekeepers. It is said of them: "In     watching was their office, b=
ut among the stars of=20

heaven their     watch they kept not," and their failure was the Fall. In t=
he _Book     of Enoch_ the=20

same Seven Watchers in heaven are stars which     transgressed the commandm=
ent of God=20

before their time arrived, for     they came not in their proper season, th=
erefore was he offended=20

with them, and bound them until the period of the consummation of     their=
 crimes, at the end of=20

the _secret_, or great year of the     World, _i.e._, the Period of Precess=
ion, when there was to be=20

restoration and rebeginning. The Seven deposed constellations are     seen =
by Enoch, looking like=20

seven great blazing mountains     overthrown--the seven mountains in _Revel=
ation_, on which the=20

Scarlet Lady sits.(369)   There are seven keys to this, as to every other a=
llegory, whether in the=20

_Bible_ or in pagan religions. While Mr. Massey has hit upon the key in the=
 mysteries of=20

cosmogony, John Bentley in his _Hindu Astronomy_ claims that the Fall of th=
e Angels, or _War in=20

Heaven_, as given by the Hindus, is but a figure of the calculations of tim=
e-periods, and goes on to=20

show that among the Western nations the same war, with like results, took t=
he form of the war of=20

the Titans.  In short, he makes it _astronomical_. So does the author of _T=
he Source of=20

Measures_:       The celestial sphere with the earth, was divided into twel=
ve     compartments=20

[astronomically], and these compartments were     esteemed as _sexed_, the =
_lords_ or=20

_husbands_ being respectively     the planets presiding over them. This bei=
ng the settled scheme,=20

want of proper correction would bring it to pass, after a time,     that er=
ror and confusion would=20

ensue by the compartments coming     under the lordship of the wrong planet=
s. Instead of lawful=20

you well, in defiance of the whole world."  "With regard to myself, Monsieu=
r de Rochefort," replied=20

Mazarin, "I am not, like Monsieur de Richelieu, all-powerful. I am but a mi=
nister, who wants no=20

servants, being myself nothing but a servant of the queen's. Now, the queen=
 is of a sensitive=20

nature. Hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declara=
tion of war, and as she=20

considers you a man of superior talent, and consequently dangerous, she des=
ired me to make=20

sure of you; that is the reason of your being shut up in the Bastile. But y=
our release can be=20

managed. You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and ha=
ving understood=20

them, can act with energy----"  "Such was Cardinal Richelieu's opinion, my =
lord."  "The cardinal,"=20

interrupted Mazarin, "was a great politician and therein shone his vast sup=
eriority over me. I am a=20

straightforward, simple man; that's my great disadvantage. I am of a frankn=
ess of character quite=20

French."  Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile.  "Now to the =
point. I want friends; I want=20

faithful servants. When I say I want, I mean the queen wants them. I do not=
hing without her=20

commands--pray understand that; not like Monsieur de Richelieu, who went on=
 just as he pleased.=20

So I shall never be a great man, as he was, but to compensate for that, I s=
hall be a good man,=20

Monsieur de Rochefort, and I hope to prove it to you."  Rochefort knew well=
 the tones of that soft=20

voice, in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp, like the hissing o=
f young vipers.  "I am=20

disposed to believe your eminence," he replied; "though I have had but litt=
le evidence of that good-

nature of which your eminence speaks. Do not forget that I have been five y=
ears in the Bastile and=20

that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison=
."  "Ah, Monsieur de=20

Rochefort! have I not told you already that I had nothing to do with that? =
The queen--cannot you=20



make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess? But that has=
 passed away as=20

suddenly as it came, and is forgotten."  "I can easily suppose, sir, that h=
er majesty has forgotten it=20


_
wedlock, there would be illegal intercourse, as between the     planets, "_=
sons of Elohim_" and=20

these compartments, "daughters of     H-Adam," or the _earth_-man; and in f=
act the fourth verse of=20

sixth     _Genesis_ will bear _this_ interpretation for the usual one,     =
_viz._, "In the same days, or=20

periods, there were untimely births     in the earth; and also behind that,=
 when the sons of Elohim=20

came     to the daughters of H-Adam, they begat to them the offspring of   =
  harlotry," etc.,=20

astronomically indicating this confusion.(370)   Do any of these learned ex=
planations explain=20

anything except a possible ingenious allegory, and a personification of the=
 celestial bodies, by the=20

ancient Mythologists and Priests? Carried to their last word they would und=
eniably explain much,=20

and would thus furnish one of the right seven keys, fitting a great many of=
 the Biblical puzzles yet=20

opening none naturally and entirely, instead of being scientific and cunnin=
g master- keys. But they=20

yet prove one thing--that neither the septiform chronology nor the septifor=
m theogony and=20

evolution of all things is of divine origin in the _Bible_. For let us see =
the sources at which the=20

_Bible_ sipped its divine inspiration with regard to the sacred number seve=
n. Says Mr. Massey in=20

the same lecture:       The _Book of Genesis_ tells us nothing about the na=
ture of these     Elohim,=20

erroneously rendered "God," who are creators of the Hebrew     beginning, a=
nd who are=20

themselves preextant and seated when the     theatre opens and the curtain =
ascends. It says that=20

in the     beginning the Elohim created the heaven and the earth. In     th=
ousands of books the=20

fetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal, but I who have passed those ye=
ars in the Bastile----"=20

"Ah! mon Dieu! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort! do you absolutely think that =
the Palais Royal is=20

the abode of gayety? No. We have had great annoyances there. As for me, I p=
lay my game=20

squarely, fairly, and above board, as I always do. Let us come to some conc=
lusion. Are you one of=20

us, Monsieur de Rochefort?"  "I am very desirous of being so, my lord, but =
I am totally in the dark=20

about everything. In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and =
jailers, and you have not=20

an idea, my lord, how little is known of what is going on by people of that=
 sort; I am of Monsieur de=20

Bassompierre's party. Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France?"  "=
He is dead, sir; a great=20

loss. His devotion to the queen was boundless; men of loyalty are scarce." =
 "I think so, forsooth,"=20

said Rochefort, "and when you find any of them, you march them off to the B=
astile. However, there=20

are plenty in the world, but you don't look in the right direction for them=
, my lord."  "Indeed! explain=20

to me. Ah! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, how much you must have learned du=
ring your intimacy=20

with the late cardinal! Ah! he was a great man."  "Will your eminence be an=
gry if I read you a=20

lesson?"  "I! never! you know you may say anything to me. I try to be belov=
ed, not feared."  "Well,=20

there is on the wall of my cell, scratched with a nail, a proverb, which sa=
ys, 'Like master, like=20

servant.'"  "Pray, what does that mean?"  "It means that Monsieur de Richel=
ieu was able to find=20

trusty servants, dozens and dozens of them."  "He! the point aimed at by ev=
ery poniard!=20


_
conclusive result.... The Elohim are Seven in number, whether as     nature=
-powers, gods of=20

constellations, or planetary gods, ... as     the Pitris and Patriarchs, Ma=
nus and Fathers of earlier=20

times. The     Gnostics, however, and the Jewish _Kabalah_ in warding off b=
lows which were=20

forever aimed at him!"  "But he did ward them off," said De Rochefort, "and=
 the reason was, that=20

though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends. I have known p=
ersons," he=20

continued--for he thought he might avail=20


_
the Elohim of _Genesis_ by which we are able to identify them with     othe=
