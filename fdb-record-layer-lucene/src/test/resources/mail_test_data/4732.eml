 In any case, whether it is desired to distinguish accidental from suicidal=
 or homicidal wounds, those cases philodendron monstera his daughter on her=
 taking leave of him, they are also false,=E2=80=94for he left Pavia withou=
t seeing or speaking to her, because he could not have done either without =
weeping. The advocate for our adversary utters another falsehood, when he s=
ays, that the lord of Milan case quoted above. Thus the track of the murder=
er may be discovered or the body may have been interfered with and moved or=
 robbed, all indicating homicide.  In any case, whether it is desired to di=
stinguish accidental from suicidal or homicidal wounds, those cases _
excommunication carries no effect against Pietro della Luna, except in case=
 the king should=20

become disobedient, and that he had given his consent to the said excommuni=
cation, which, as=20

has been said, was to have no effect, except in case of renunciation of all=
egiance or disobedience.=20

It is certain that Pietro della Luna was of a temper obstinate enough to do=
 such things, and that he=20

acted thus without consulting any one, and as certain that my lord of Orlea=
ns was unfavourable to=20

this act,=E2=80=94for it was not put in force until after his death.  =E2=
=80=98Weigh, at the same time, my lords, the=20

misconduct of our adversary, and the innocence of the duke of Orleans, who =
may say with the=20

Psalmist, =E2=80=98Os peccatoris et os dolosi super me apertum est, locuti =
sunt adversum me lingua=20

dolosa, et sermonibus odii circumdederunt me.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The third =
charge of our adversary is, that my late=20

lord of Orleans practised different means to cause the death of his prince =
and lord, the king of=20

France: first, as it is said, by sorceries, witchcrafts and superstitions;=
=E2=80=94secondly, by=20

poisons;=E2=80=94thirdly, by fire, water, or other violent injections, whic=
h consequently inculpates my lord=20

of Orleans in the crime of human high treason, in the person of the king ou=
r lord.  =E2=80=98In regard to the=20

first part of the charge relative to poison, supposed to be administered by=
 a monk under the forms=20

of a sword, a buckler, a ring, or a wand,=E2=80=94and that, to accomplish t=
his, my lord of Orleans had sent=20

for this monk, a knight, an esquire and a varlet, to whom, our adversary sa=
ys, he gave large sums=20

of money,=E2=80=94all this I deny as absolute falsehoods, for my said lord =
of Orleans never consented to=20

sorceries or such forbidden deeds.  =E2=80=98Should this monk have done suc=
h sorceries, it was no way=20

through the exhortation of my lord of Orleans, nor ought this to have been =
so lightly alledged=20

against him,=E2=80=94for there was a long trial held of this monk before th=
e ministers of the king, from=20

whom the truth may be known. It was then discovered by the confession of th=
e monk, that my lord=20

had forbidden him to use any magic arts that would any way prove to the pre=
judice of the king=E2=80=99s=20

person; and God knows, if there had been any truth in the charge, it would =
not have been=20

concealed until after my lord=E2=80=99s death.  =E2=80=98By this, the false=
hood of the accusation is evident; and=20

although my foresaid lord may have at times held some conversation with thi=
s monk, let it be=20

remembered that he was then young, not more than eighteen years old, and th=
at princes of that=20

age are frequently deceived by artful talkers, to gain money from them.  =
=E2=80=98With respect to the bone=20

wrapped up in a small linen bag which he wore between his shirt and skin, a=
s our adversary says,=20

until it was torn from him by a knight, whom he hated ever after, and conti=
nued to persecute until=20

he had ruined him in his fortune, and procured his banishment out of the re=
alm,=E2=80=94this is most=20

assuredly false; for the knight was banished the kingdom by sentence of the=
 courts of justice for a=20

very notorious cause, and this odious circumstance was never mentioned but =
by this knight who=20

published it, and who, according to our adversary, was suspected of hatred =
to the duke of Orleans,=20

and consequently not a competent witness to be admitted against the defunct=
.  =E2=80=98Consider, my=20

lords, what falsehoods are contained in the accusations of our adversary, a=
nd that such as read=20

his libel must be deceived. It behoves, therefore, the reverend professors =
of theology to correct it=20

as soon as possible, for they know that such libels ought not to be written=
 nor published; but the=20

most marvellous circumstance of all is, that this libel and these falsehood=
s have been suffered and=20

made public by a theologian in the presence of the king=E2=80=99s majesty. =
 =E2=80=98We are at present in a similar=20

situation to that in which Saint Austin represents the companion of the phy=
sician and astrologer=20

disputing on twin children, the one fat and the other lean. The astrologer =
attributing the difference=20

to the ascendancy of the stars,=E2=80=94the physician declaring, that the f=
at one received the soul first,=20



and, being the strongest, sucked nearly the whole of the food,=E2=80=94whic=
h ought to be believed? The=20

physician, certainly, as St Austin says. We, in like manner, may give great=
er credit to the faculty of=20

medicine in this manner than to the faculty of theology: the professor has =
very foolishly argued his=20

case.  =E2=80=98O, most merciful God! apply a remedy to this, for thou sees=
t theologians affirm that=20

sorcerers may succeed in their incantations; and it is erring against the h=
oly Scriptures to say, that=20

sorcerers are others than liars. And the wise Solomon makes this answer to =
those who asserted=20

similar errors, in the 33d chapter of Ecclesiasticus,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Quod=
 divinatio erroris, et arguta mendacia et=20

somnia maleficiorum vanitas est.=E2=80=99 Thomas Aquinas quotes this author=
ity to prove that sorcerers=20

cannot succeed.  =E2=80=98O, thou university of Paris! please to correct th=
yself; for such absurd sciences=20

are not only forbidden, as the deceased would furnish no evidence unless so=
me letter or paper=20

were found stating the purpose of committing suicide. Little or no evidence=
 would be furnished by=20

the position of the body when found in cases which might otherwise be doubt=
ful. Organic lesions=20

or other facts predisposing to suicide would furnish presumptive evidence a=
gainst the wounds=20

being accidental. Of all these various points the first, as to the nature o=
f the wounds, is by itself the=20

most valuable and conclusive. But this gives us no assistance in clearing u=
p a case where it is=20

doubtful whether a fall from a height or a crush by a vehicle or railway tr=
ain was accidental or=20

suicidal. Some of the other points mentioned may aid us in such a case, and=
 also the fact that=20

such injuries are far more often accidental than suicidal. But in these cas=
es, also, certain=20

circumstances may show that the fall was not the result of accident.  Accid=
ental wounds are=20

generally caused by a fall or a crush, and the fact of their accidental cha=
racter is generally=20

established by the circumstances of the event. Certain accidental wounds pr=
esent characteristics=20

which allow the true nature of the wounds to be determined. But in some cas=
es a suspicion may=20

arise and the question may be asked as to WHETHER THE WOUND WAS ACCIDENTAL =
OR=20

HOMICIDAL. For instance, if a person receives fatal homicidal injuries, and=
 just before or after=20

death the body is thrown from a height or is run over and crushed, it may b=
e hard to determine the=20

murderous element among the many wounds. This is the case if the homicidal =
wounds were=20

contusions or were caused by blunt instruments, but rarely, if ever so, if =
they are incised or=20

punctured wounds or both. But even in the former instance, a close examinat=
ion of the lesions and=20

of the locality of the injury can often clear up the case. Thus in a case m=
entioned by Vibert,[653]=20

as cited by Hofmann after Taylor, a woman was found dead at the foot of som=
e stairs in a cave.=20

She had died of a fracture of the skull and of the spine, produced by the f=
all. But about four or five=20

feet above the level of the top step there was found on the wall the fresh =
marks of an arterial jet of=20

blood. Examination showed a wound in the right temporal region which had op=
ened the temporal=20

artery, and it was therefore thought that the woman was wounded at the top =
of the stairway and=20

then thrown down, which was afterward proved to be true. In another case, r=
eported by M.=20

Tourdes, a man knocked down and killed by an axe, which crushed his skull a=
nd caused the brain=20

to exude, was placed in a road frequented at night by heavy wagons. The hea=
d was placed in the=20

rut, but the coagulated blood and brain formed a puddle which did not appea=
r on the wheels or=20

their track, and no bloody furrow was caused by their passage. The same aut=
hor mentions the=20

case of a woman plainly strangulated by the hands and then thrown into the =
ditch of the=20

fortifications of Paris.  It is especially with regard to fractures of the =
skull that the question often=20

comes up as to the accidental or homicidal nature of the injury, as to whet=
her it is due to a fall or a=20



wound. Sometimes a depressed fracture may show the form of the instrument. =
An extensive=20

comminuted fracture of the skull may indicate greater violence than would b=
e received from a fall=20

from the little height which the circumstances may allow. As to the slighte=
r degrees of fracture, the=20

disposition of the fracture itself often shows less than the form and site =
of the ecchymosis, the=20

lesion of the scalp, and the place and position of the body when found. In =
such cases the traces of=20

a struggle, the existence of other wounds, etc., may be of great importance=
. In distinguishing=20

between homicide and accident, as in distinguishing between the latter and =
suicide, the most=20

obscure and difficult cases are those where the injury has been caused by a=
 fall from a height or=20

by a crush.  This is illustrated by the case of Madame de Tourville, which =
is quoted by Taylor.[654]=20

She was killed in July, 1876, by a fall from a precipice. Her husband, a la=
wyer, was accused of=20

murder committed by pushing her over a precipice in the Stelvio Pass. The p=
lace where her dead=20

body was found was at a considerable depth below, and the injury was chiefl=
y in the head, which=20

had been crushed by the fall. The body showed no evidence of intentional vi=
olence. The prisoner=E2=80=99s=20

guilt was established on the following points: (1) The false and inconsiste=
nt statements made as to=20

the occurrence; (2) the marks of the body having been dragged some distance=
 so that a part of the=20

dress was found, in a bloody condition, some way from the body; (3) there w=
ere marks of blood on=20

the prisoner=E2=80=99s hands and clothing. After a long trial he was convic=
ted, though the sentence was=20

afterward commuted to imprisonment for life. Of course, as we have already =
stated, if a person is=20

responsible for a fall he is also responsible for the results of the fall. =
This applies to many of the=20

contused=20


_
but as containing nothing true, which is confirmed by the workers of magic.=
  =E2=80=98Ovid says, in his=20

book, =E2=80=98De Remedia Amoris,=E2=80=99               =E2=80=98Fallitur =
Hermion=C3=A6 si quis mala pabula terr=C3=A6:               Et=20

magicas artes posse juvare putat.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Master John de Bar, wh=
o was very expert in this accursed art,=20

and who was burnt, with all his books, declared, at his last confession, th=
at the devil never=20

appeared to him, and that his invocations and sorceries never succeeded, al=
though many said the=20

contrary. He added, that he had practised this art to obtain money from per=
sons of high rank. It is=20

therefore most strange to charge the duke of Orleans with such vain and foo=
lish sorceries, as=20

there never was a man who hated them more, or who persecuted such as practi=
sed them with=20

greater rigour.  =E2=80=98Every one knows that my late lord was the princip=
al cause of the trial of John de=20

Bar and of two augustan friars, before the king=E2=80=99s council and clerg=
y summoned for this purpose,=20

and were in consequence executed for their evil deeds.  =E2=80=98With regar=
d to what the advocate for our=20

opponent says, that the late lord of Milan only gave his daughter to the du=
ke of Orleans in the=20

hope of her being queen of France; and that, on her taking leave of him, he=
 should say, =E2=80=98Adieu! my=20

child: I never wish to see thee again but as queen of France.=E2=80=99 This=
 is absolutely false; for my lord=20

of Milan was in treaty with the duke of Gueldres, brother to the king of th=
e Romans, to marry his=20

daughter: ambassadors falls in prize-fights and drunken brawls.  We may sum=
 up the points of=20

evidence which help us to distinguish between an accidental and a homicidal=
 injury much as we=20

did when the question lay between accident and suicide. (1) The evidence fr=
om the nature of the=20

wound is not quite so conclusive as when the question lies between suicide =
and accident. For=20

contusions and contused wounds are far more often homicidal than suicidal, =
and accidental=20

wounds are almost always of this class. If, however, the wounds are incised=
 or punctured, this fact=20

points almost certainly to homicide. (2) As to situation, a homicidal wound=
 may be situated almost=20

anywhere; an accidental wound, except in falls from a height, only on an ex=
posed place. (3) The=20

direction of the wound can seldom help us in the case of contused wounds wh=
ich, practically, are=20

the only ones in question, though it may possibly be incompatible with acci=
dent. (4) As to the=20

number of wounds, homicidal wounds are far more apt to be multiple either i=
n a small area or=20

scattered in such a way that an accident could hardly account for them all.=
 (5) A weapon may give=20

evidence more often here than when suicide is in question, for a weapon may=
 be used to inflict=20

contused wounds which may resemble those received in a fall. The evidence f=
urnished by a=20

weapon or blood, hair, etc., on the weapon, etc., is strongly in favor of m=
urder. (6) The evidence=20

from a struggle is also more important because it is more often found. A=20


_
conclude the match, when Bertrand Gaad, at that time tutor to the count de =
Vertus, was sent by=20

the king and the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, (whose soul may God receive!)=
 to propose the=20

alliance of the duke of Orleans.  =E2=80=98The lord of Milan, preferring th=
e honour of a connexion with=20

France, consented to give his daughter to the duke of Orleans, ceased to tr=
eat with the duke of=20

Gueldres, and recalled the ambassadors he had sent to him. As to the words =
the lord of occur in=20

homicide, and only in homicide, as a rule, so that signs of a struggle are =
strong evidence of=20

murder and against the idea of accident. (7) The examination of the clothes=
 and body of the=20

deceased may give valuable evidence, showing, as it may, signs of a struggl=
e or other marks of an=20

assailant and indicating murder. (8) Examination of the position and attitu=
de of the body and of the=20

spot where it lay and the ground around may furnish more or less proof of=
=20
