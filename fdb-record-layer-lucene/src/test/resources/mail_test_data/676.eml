considered, it must be allowed that the fresh dung found in the morning bor=
e witness to the theft of=20

corn during the past night; thus the elephant had marched many miles after =
feeding. In the "Rifle=20

and Hound in Ceylon," published in 1854, I gave a detailed description of t=
he elephants of that=20

country, which, although neckcloth.  "Do, Joe," entreated Mary; "I'm sure i=

no one could say that you broke through your principles, considerin' the co=

Foolish Mary! she was young and inexperienced, and knew not the danger of t=
empting her=20

husband to drink.  She only knew that hundreds of first-rate,=20


_
Indian species.  Although the elephant is found throughout many countries, =
extending over an=20

enormous area, there are only two species at present in existence,--the Ind=
ian and African; these=20

are totally different in their habits, and are distinguished by peculiariti=
es of form. The most striking=20

difference is in the shape of the head and spine. The head of the Indian sp=
ecies is perfectly=20

distinct; the forehead, when held in the natural position of inaction, is p=
erpendicular; and above the=20

slight convexity at the root of the trunk there is a depression, in shape l=
ike a herald's shield: a=20

bullet in the lower portion of that shield would reach the brain in a direc=
t line. The head of the=20

African elephant is completely convex from the commencement of the trunk to=
 the back of the=20

skull, and the brain is situated much lower than in that of the Indian spec=
ies; the bone is of a=20

denser quality, and the cases for the reception of the tusks are so closely=
 parallel, that there is=20

barely room for a bullet to find a chance of penetrating to the brain; it m=
ust be delivered in the=20

exact centre, and extremely low, in the very root of the trunk; even then i=
t will frequently pass=20

above the brain, as the animal generally carries his head high, and thrown =
slightly back. The teeth=20

of the African elephant differ materially from those of the Indian, by cont=
aining a lesser number of=20

laminae or plates, the surfaces of which, instead of exhibiting straight an=
d parallel lines like those=20

of the Indian, are shaped in slight curves, which increase the power of gri=
nding. The ears of the=20

African species are enormous, and when thrown back they completely cover th=
e shoulders; they=20

are also entirely different in shape from those of the Indian species. When=
 then without any evil=20

doing the same.  But Joe=20

knew his danger.  His father had died a drunkard.  He had listened to earne=
st men while they told=20

of the bitter curse that drinking had been to thousands, that to some exten=
t the tendency to drink=20

was hereditary, and that, however safe some natures might be while moderate=
ly indulging, there=20

were other natures to which moderate drinking was equivalent to getting on =
those rails which,=20

running down a slight incline at first--almost a level-- gradually pass ove=
r a steep descent, where=20

brakes become powerless, and end at last in total destruction.  "I don't re=
quire beer, Molly," said=20

Dashwood with a smile, as he retired into the large closet; "at my time o' =
life a man must be a=20

miserable, half-alive sort o' critter, if he can't git along without Dutch =
courage. The sight o' your=20

face and May's there, is better than a stiff glass o' grog to me any day.  =
It makes me feel stronger=20

e last sentences were=20

uttered, and the creaking of the bedstead indicated that the fireman was co=
mposing his massive=20

limbs to rest, and scarcely had Mrs Dashwood resumed her washing, when his =
regular heavy=20

breathing proclaimed him to be already in the land of Nod.  Quietly but ste=
adily did Mrs Dashwood=20

pursue her work.  Neat little under-garments, and fairy-like little socks, =
