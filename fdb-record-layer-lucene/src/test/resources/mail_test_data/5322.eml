last year lost money on the sales of their cargoes, &, from what we hear of=
 prices in America, and=20

on the Continent, they must lose by the returns. But what will give the dea=
th blow to the prosperity=20

of the Philippines, is the late horrible massacre. All those french and oth=
er foreigners, who were=20

anxious to have established themselves in commerce or on estates in the cou=
ntry, are now=20

frightened off and certainly no one will find himself, confident enough to =
trust to a Government,=20

which could permit such a massacre to take place, immediately under its eye=
s, when it had 5,000=20

men in arms, ready at a minutes notice to disperse the Mob. Thus situated, =
Manilla offers no=20

chance of profit or Speculation; and I confess, however my hopes and wishes=
 may have been=20

disappointed, I turn from them with disgust & horror, better pleased to be =
ordered to live, in some=20

remote corner of Siberia, on black bread & salt, than roll in wealth, amids=
t such an inhuman,=20

illiberal and unchristianlike race of Men.... I must close my letter by inf=
orming you that the Captain=20

General has refused all the applications for indemnification, from those wh=
o have been plundered;=20

so that as yet, neither the punishment due to the assassins has been inflic=
ted, nor redress made=20

to the unfortunate people who were robbed."  By the kindness of James A. Le=
Roy, the Editors=20

have in their hands a copy (furnished by Dr. Pardo de Tavera from the origi=
nal in his possession)=20

of a decree issued by Governor Folgueras (dated at Manila, October 20, 1820=
), addressed "to the=20

natives of the Filipinas Islands, and especially to those of the district o=
f Tondo," in which he=20

rebukes them severely for thus violating the law of nations, under the infl=
uence of "a general=20

frenzy," and "led astray and infuriated by certain malicious persons." He c=
haracterizes their belief=20

that the strangers had poisoned the waters as a foolish and absurd notion, =
which "the mountain=20

Negritos or the Moros of Jol and Mindanao would be climb of two hours previ=
ous, and, thanks to=20

the promise of a "nobbler of rum each," Cato and Ferdinand transported my p=
recious "run" in=20

safety to the stern-sheets; the sun having then sunk in crimson beauty behi=
nd the coast-range,=20

and the breeze having fallen to the faintest whisper, we shoved off, and pu=
lled leisurely over the=20

calm bay to Cardwell, arriving about ten o'clock, to hear the welcome news =
that the 'Daylight'=20

would be ready for us on the following afternoon.   HOW WE EXPLORED HINCHIN=
BROOK=20

ISLAND.  The sun was just showing above the distant sea-line, and the bay w=
as lying motionless=20

as a mirror, with a rosy hue thrown across its placid surface, when I awoke=
 on the following=20

morning, stiff from the clamber of the preceding day.  The short half-hour =
before the rays of the=20

sun have attained an unpleasant fierceness is most enjoyable in Australia, =
particularly in a wild=20

region such as Cardwell, where birds, beasts, and fishes pursue their daily=
 avocations, heedless=20

of the presence of man.  My house was situated at the extreme north end of =
the township, and far=20

apart from the nearest dwelling--so much so, in fact, that it was only by a=
 stretch of the imagination=20

that I could say I was included within the village boundary.  On the side f=
arthest from the=20

settlement lay the virgin bush, whilst outside the garden at the back, all =
was wild and rude as=20

Nature had left it, except a small clearing I had made for the growth of ma=
ize, sweet potatoes, etc.=20

Now this clearing had many enemies, and of many species, ranging from feath=
ered and furred to=20

biped.  The cockatoos came down in such clouds as almost to whiten the grou=
nd, and made short=20

work of the maize; the bandicoots and the township pigs dug up and devoured=
 the sweet potatoes,=20

just as they were becoming large enough for use--commend me to your half-st=
arved pig to find out=20

in a moment where the juiciest and finest esculent lies buried--and the cha=
ttering little opossums=20

stripped the peach-trees of=20


_
strangers whom they have plundered and slain were not only friends and bret=
hren, but the very=20

persons on whom the prosperity of the islands must depend, since they suppl=
ied a market for the=20

produce of the country. He then presents the report which has been made by =
an official whom the=20

governor had specially appointed (October 13) to investigate this idea of t=
he foreigners' crime,=20

which is to the following effect: "As the evidence of guilt [cuerpo de deli=
to, the same as the Latin=20

corpus delicti] in the poisoning which is charged, the Indians have brought=
 to us, among the spoils=20

which they plundered from the houses of the Frenchmen, various animals of d=
ifferent forms, and=20

among them a serpent, of quite the usual size, one of those which they call=
 'house-snakes,' in a=20

dissected state; others, with some little shellfish, preserved in spirits o=
f wine, in a crystal flask; in=20

another, two granos of muriatic baryte; a quantity of Peruvian bark, which =
in my opinion would=20

weigh about an arroba and a half; and a box of sheet-tin about a vara long,=
 one-fourth as wide,=20

and six dedos thick, in which also was found a mass of insects, but already=
 decaying; and finally,=20

in the house of a woman who had been accused of being an agent of the Frenc=
h for the alleged=20

poisoning, a little package of some black powders in China paper [i.e., ric=
e paper]." The official=20

states that these animal specimens have evidently "no other object than to =
enrich cabinets of=20

natural history," and could not in any way have been used for injuring huma=
n beings. The muriatic=20

baryte was for use in analyzing mineral waters, and was, moreover, useful i=
n various diseases.=20

The Peruvian bark was, as all might know, a useful medicine and had often b=
een helpful in=20

checking the cholera itself. The black powders, it was also decided, were a=
lso of medicinal value;=20

and the entire story is characterized as a fiction and delusion. The offici=
al regrets that it was=20

believed by so many persons who should have known better than to accept so =
gross an error; "but=20

it is certain that they did, and, among them, many of the clergy; and with =
this the delusion attained=20

such power that it has caused the very scandalous deeds which all good pers=
ons lament; for it is=20

certain that there is no better way of propagating an error than for person=
s of authority to adopt it.=20

There is no doubt, it appears, that this foolish idea of poisoning had its =
origin in the ignorance of=20

the Indians; but there is as little doubt that malicious persons, imposing =
upon this folly and lack of=20

knowledge in the Indians, incited them to perpetrate the assassinations and=
 robberies of the=20

disastrous days, October 9 and 10." He adds that one of the books brought t=
o him by the Indians,=20

which they had taken from the house of the French naturalist, was filled wi=
th sketches of fishes,=20

mollusks, and birds peculiar to the country, which plainly showed that he w=
as only making=20

zoological observations. In view of all these things, Folgueras calls upon =
the natives to repent of=20

their sin, to surrender to the authorities the instigators of the tumult, t=
o restore to the plundered=20

foreigners what had been stolen from them, and to denounce the authors of t=
he murders, that=20

justice might be done to these evil persons. These exhortations are especia=
lly addressed to the=20

inhabitants of Binondo, "which has been the theatre of the most horrible tr=
agedy, and assisted by=20

the flying-foxes during the night, whilst any that had escaped these noctur=
nal depredators became=20

the spoil of two or three idle boys, who loafed about all day, seeking misc=
hief, and, as always=20

happens, succeeding in finding it, even in this sequestered region. From th=
is it will be seen that my=20

efforts in the direction of husbandry were attended with some difficulty, a=
nd, despite a real liking=20

for the animal world, I had imbibed a holy hatred of that particular sectio=
n of its society which=20

insisted on devouring my substance under my very nose, only retreating to t=
he nearest tree until=20

my back was turned, and then resuming operations with unblushing effrontery=
.  By way of a mild=20



vengeance, I had got into the habit of coming out every morning directly I =
awoke, with my gun, and=20

easing off both barrels amongst the cockatoos, wallabies, or whatever parti=
cular class of robbers=20

happened to be afield at the moment--a practice which served as a safety-va=
lve for my injured=20

feelings, whilst at the same time it provided me with a cockatoo pie, or a =
good bowl of kangaroo-

tail soup.  Once, in my indignation at finding my palings broken down, and =
some sugar-cane, that I=20

had been most carefully rearing, rooted up and destroyed, while the author =
of the mischief, a huge=20

sow, innocent of the restraining ring (I would have hung the ring of the 'D=
evastation's' best bower-

anchor to her snout, had I been allowed to follow out my wishes), stood glo=
ating over the havoc=20

she had caused.  Then, in my wrath, I had hastily loaded a carbine with a h=
andful of salt, and=20

prematurely converted a portion of my enemy's flank into bacon; but even th=
is just act of=20

retribution was not to be accomplished without further loss to myself, for =
on receipt of my hint to=20

move on, her sowship dashed straight ahead, and brought down a whole panel =
of my fence about=20

her ears, owing to which the village cows, which I had often observed throw=
ing longing glances=20

over the paling at my bananas, doubtless apprised of their opportunity by t=
he evil-minded and=20

malicious sow, took a mean advantage of the weakness of my defences, and on=
 the same night=20

devoured everything in the garden that they thought worthy of their attenti=
on.  Though I had now=20

become hardened to the many injuries thus heaped upon me, and had almost di=
scontinued all=20

attempts at cultivation, I still retained the habit of stepping out into th=
e verandah every morning=20

with my gun, but more with an eye to the pot than for any other reason.  Be=
autiful as the scene=20

always was, it struck me that day as being of unusual splendour.  The tall =
gum-trees, with their=20

naked stems, and curious hanging leaves that exasperate the heated travelle=
r by throwing the=20

scantiest of shadows, glistened dew-beaded in the rising sun.  The laughing=
 jackass, perched=20

upon a bare limb, was awaking the forest echoes with his insane fits of lau=
ghter, alternating from a=20

good-humoured chuckle to the frenzied ravings of a despairing maniac. Sudde=
nly ceasing, he=20

would dart down upon some hapless lizard, too early astir for its own safet=
y, and, with his writhing=20

prey in his bill, would fly to some other branch, and after swallowing his =
captive, burst forth into a=20

yell of self-gratulation even-more fiendish than before.  The delicate litt=
le "paddy melon," a small=20

species of kangaroo, turned his gracefully-formed little head, beautiful as=
 a fawn's, and,=20


_
covered itself with blood and ignominy." This decree is published by Dr. Pa=
rdo de Tavera, from the=20

original printed edition, in his Biblioteca filipina, pp. 45-47.  [14] In h=
is scarce third volume of the=20

Informe, Mas says that the governor, either wittingly or unwittingly, did w=
ell in not sending out the=20

soldiers, who were natives, until the fury of the people had spent itself; =
as otherwise all discipline=20

might easily have been lost, and the soldiers have joined with their kindre=
d in the massacre.  [15]=20

Our author gives the name of this periodical incorrectly; it should be El N=
oticioso Filipino--see=20

Retana's Periodismo filipino, appendix ii (pp. 561, 563). It was apparently=
 begun on July 29, 1821;=20

it was issued on Sundays. Its publication ceased before November 1 of that =
year. This information=20

was furnished to hesitatingly for a few seconds, and then, bending forward,=
 bounded into the=20

scrub, the noise caused by the flapping of its tail being audible long afte=
r the little animal itself was=20

lost to sight.  The white cockatoos, alarmed by the outcry of the sentry--f=
or, like the English rooks,=20

they always tell off some of their number to keep a look-out--who with sulp=
hur-coloured crest,=20

erect and outstretched neck, kept up a constant cry of warning, rose from t=
he maize patch, the=20

spotless white of their plumage glancing in the sun, and forming a beautifu=
l contrast to the pale=20

straw-colour of the under portion of their extended pinions.  With discorda=
nt screams they circle=20

about, as if a little undetermined, and then perch upon the topmost branche=
s of the tallest trees,=20

where they screech, flap their wings, and engage in a=20
