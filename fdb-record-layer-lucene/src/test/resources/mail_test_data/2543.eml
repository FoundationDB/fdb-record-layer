URSUS, THE DROLL  INTRODUCTORY  With the possible exception of the deer fam=
ily, the bear=20

is the most widely disseminated big game, known to hunters.  He makes his h=
ome within the Arctic=20

Circle, often living upon the great ice-floe, or dwells within a tropical j=
ungle, and both climates are=20

agreeable to him, while longitudinally he has girdled the world.  Of course=
 bruin varies much,=20

according to the climate in which he lives, and the conditions of his life,=
 but all the way from the=20

poles to the tropics he retains certain characteristics that always proclai=
m him a bear.  He is a=20

plantigrade, walking like a man upon the soles of his feet. There is more t=
ruth than poetry in=20

Kipling's poem, "The Man Who Walks Like a Bear," for some men do walk like =
a bear.  Bruin's=20

four-footed gait is a shuffle and a shamble, rather clumsy and ludicrous, b=
ut it takes him over the=20

ground at a surprising pace. Queer, also, is the fact that the bear combine=
s great dexterity with his=20

seeming clumsiness, as many a hunter has found to his cost.  His tree-climb=
ing accomplishments=20

are likewise remarkable, when we consider his great size and weight.  The g=
rizzlies, and some=20

other large varieties, do not do tree-climbing, except when they are young.=
  A grizzly cub can climb=20

a tree, but his wrists soon become too stiff to permit of their bending abo=
ut the trunk.  Bruin's=20

disposition also varies with the climate he inhabits.  This in turn is beca=
use his diet varies in=20

differing latitudes.  The farther south he ranges, the more of a vegetarian=
 he becomes.=20

Consequently, he is not so ferocious.  The great white polar bear is largel=
y carnivorous, so he is a=20

creature not to be trifled with; while on the other hand, the little Africa=
n sun bear is a rollicking,=20

social, good-natured little chap, weighing many times less than his fierce =
cousin.  Formerly, it has=20

been supposed that the Numidian lion and the Bengal tiger were the largest =
carnivorous animals=20

in existence, but more recent discoveries show that our Alaskan brown bear,=
 found upon the=20

peninsulas of lower Alaska and Kodiak Island, is easily the master of eithe=
r, in size or strength.=20

Some of the splendid skins taken from these, the largest of all the bears, =
measure fourteen feet in=20

length. Alaska also gives us the smallest North American bear, the glacial =
bear.  Californians are=20

wont to tell us that the only true grizzly is that found upon the cover of =
the _Overland Monthly_, but=20

they overlook the fact that the name was given to bears found along the Mis=
souri River by Lewis=20



and Clarke, years before California, with all its wealth, was discovered.  =
In Russia, a fine specimen=20

of the family is found in the Ural Mountains.  His peculiarity is a white c=
ollar about the neck, so his=20

Latin name, _Ursus collaris_, means the bear with a collar.  All through th=
e Himalayas, this=20

restless plantigrade has wandered, and even far down upon the low-lying pla=
ins of India and=20

China; but all the way he shuffles and shambles and is the same droll fello=
w.  The bear's=20

vegetable diet consists of berries, nuts and many kinds of roots.  He will =
not refuse sweet apples=20

and pears when he can find them.  In the tropics he eats nearly all the fru=
its  =E2=80=9CAnd have you seen=20

Selina?=E2=80=9D inquired Lady St. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CNot yet; except mamma,=
 this is our first visit,=E2=80=9D replied the=20

duchess.  =E2=80=9CAh! that is real friendship. She came down to Vauxe the =
other day, but I did not think=20

she was looking well. She frets herself too much about her boys; she does n=
ot know what to do=20

with them. They will not go into the Church, and they have no fortune for t=
he Guards.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

Lady Corisande.  =E2=80=9CAnd Lord=20

Albert Victor to have a sheep-walk in Australia,=E2=80=9D continued Lady St=
. Jerome.  =E2=80=9CThey say that a lord=20

must not go to the bar,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel. =E2=80=9CIt seems to me=
 very unjust.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAlfred Beaufort went the=20

circuit,=E2=80=9D said Lady Corisande, =E2=80=9Cbut I believe they drove hi=
m into Parliament.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou will miss your=20

friend Bertram at Oxford,=E2=80=9D said the duchess, addressing Lothair.  =
=E2=80=9CIndeed,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, rather=20

confused, for he was himself a defaulter in collegiate attendance. =E2=80=
=9CI was just going to write to him=20

to see whether one could not keep half a term.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh! nothi=
ng will prevent his taking his degree,=E2=80=9D=20

said the duchess, =E2=80=9Cbut I fear there must be some delay. There is a =
vacancy for our county=E2=80=94Mr.=20

Sandstone is dead, and they insist upon returning Bertram. I hope he will b=
e of age before the=20

nomination. The duke is much opposed to it; he wishes him to wait; but in t=
hese days it is not so=20

easy for young men to get into Parliament. It is not as it used to be; we c=
annot choose.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThis is=20

an important event,=E2=80=9D said Lothair to Lady Corisande.  =E2=80=9CI th=
ink it is; nor do I believe Bertram is too=20

young for public life. These are not times to be laggard.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CThere is no doubt they are very serious=20

times,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI have every confidence in Bertram=
=E2=80=94in his ability and his principles.=E2=80=9D  The=20

ladies began to talk about the approaching drawing-room and Lady Corisande=
=E2=80=99s presentation, and=20

Lothair thought it right to make his obeisance and withdraw. He met in the =
hall Father Coleman,=20

who was in fact looking after him, and would have induced him to repair to =
the father=E2=80=99s room and=20

hold some interesting conversation, but Lothair was not so congenial as usu=
al. He was even=20

abrupt, and the father, who never pressed any thing, assuming that Lothair =
had some=20

engagement, relinquished with a serene brow, but not without chagrin, what =
he had deemed might=20

have proved a golden opportunity.  And yet Lothair had no engagement, and d=
id not know where=20

to go or what to do with himself. But he wanted to be alone, and of all per=
sons in the world at that=20

moment, he had a sort of instinct that the one he wished least to converse =
with was Father=20

Coleman.  =E2=80=9CShe has every confidence in his principles,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Lothair to himself as he mounted his=20

horse, =E2=80=9Cand his principles were mine six months ago, when I was at =
Brentham. Delicious=20

Brentham! It seems like a dream; but every thing seems like a dream; I hard=
ly know whether life is=20

agony or bliss.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 20 The duke was one of the few gentl=
emen in London who lived in=20

a palace. One of the half-dozen of those stately structures that our capita=
l boasts had fallen to his=20

lot.  An heir-apparent to the throne, in the earlier days of the present dy=
nasty, had resolved to be=20

lodged as became a prince, and had raised, amid gardens which he had divert=
ed from one of the=20

royal parks, an edifice not unworthy of Vicenza in its best days, though on=
 a far more extensive=20



scale than any pile that favored city boasts. Before the palace was finishe=
d, the prince died, and=20

irretrievably in debt. His executors were glad to sell to the trustees of t=
he ancestors of the chief of=20

the house of Brentham the incomplete palace, which ought never to have been=
 commenced. The=20

ancestor of the duke was by no means so strong a man as the duke himself, a=
nd prudent people=20

rather murmured at the exploit. But it was what is called a lucky family=E2=
=80=94that is to say, a family with=20

a charm that always attracted and absorbed heiresses; and perhaps the splen=
dor of CRECY=20

HOUSE=E2=80=94for it always retained its original title=E2=80=94might have =
in some degree contributed to=20

fascinate the taste or imagination of the beautiful women who, generation a=
fter generation,=20

brought their bright castles and their broad manors to swell the state and =
rent-rolls of the family=20

who were so kind to Lothair.  The centre of Crecy House consisted of a hall=
 of vast proportion, and=20

reaching to the roof. Its walls commemorated, in paintings by the most cele=
brated artists of the=20

age, the exploits of the Black Prince; and its coved ceiling, in panels res=
plendent with Venetian=20

gold, contained the forms and portraits of English heroes. A corridor=20


_
eat and leads altogether a lazy, luxurious life.  Since food is plentiful i=
n these warm climates, he=20

does not have to cross the path of man to get it, or be forced to steal, as=
 the bear living in colder=20

climes often does; so he is a good-natured, easy-going contained the most c=
elebrated private=20

collection of pictures in England and opened into a series of sumptuous sal=
oons.  It was a rather=20

early hour when Lothair, the morning after his meeting the duchess at Lady =
St. Jerome=E2=80=99s, called at=20

Crecy House; but it=20


_
let you alone if you do not pick a quarrel with him.  This is much more tru=
e of bears in general,=20

than is usually supposed.  In the tropics, the bear does not have to hibern=
ate to keep the fat that=20

he has gained in the time of plenty upon his ribs.  So his period of sleepi=
ng is very short and in=20

many cases he does to leave his card. He would not delay for a moment payin=
g his respects=20

there, and yet he shrank from thrusting himself immediately into the circle=
. The duke=E2=80=99s brougham=20

was in the court-yard. Lothair was holding his groom=E2=80=99s horse, who h=
ad dismounted, when the hall-

door opened, and his grace and Bertram came forth.=20


_
all; while, on the other hand, the bear of the cold northland sleeps nearly=
 half of the year.=20

Hibernation seems to be a wise provision of nature by means of which the be=
ar conserves his=20

flesh and strength during extreme weather.  When the ground is covered seve=
ral feet deep with=20

snow, it will readily be seen that berry-picking would be difficult, and nu=
ts and roots would be hard=20

to find, as would the ants and grubs under logs and stones, with which the =
bear varies his diet in=20

fine weather.  The chipmunks and mice have also denned up, so there is not =
much for bruin to do=20

but sleep.  There is one weakness that I believe the bear always indulges w=
henever he can, no=20

matter in what clime he be found, and =E2=80=9CHalloa, old fellow!=E2=80=9D=
 exclaimed Bertram, =E2=80=9Conly think of your=20

being here. It seems an age since we met. The duchess was telling us about =
you at breakfast.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CGo in and see them,=E2=80=9D said the duke, =E2=80=9Cthere is a la=
rge party at luncheon; Augusta Montairy is there.=20

Bertram and I are obliged to go to Lincoln=E2=80=99s Inn, something about h=
is election.=E2=80=9D  But Lothair=20

murmured thanks and declined.  =E2=80=9CWhat are you going to do with yours=
elf to-day?=E2=80=9D said the duke.=20

And Lothair hesitating, his grace continued: =E2=80=9CWell, then, come and =
dine with us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf course you=20

will come, old fellow. I have not seen you since you left Oxford at the beg=
inning of the year. And=20

then we can settle about your term.=E2=80=9D And Lothair assenting, they=20


_
sweets, especially honey.  He will dare the sharp bayonets of the most angr=
y swarm of bees or=20

climb the worst tree, if he feels at all certain that there will be honey a=
fter his pains.  In some=20

countries, he damages a great many telephone and telegraph poles and wires =
by climbing the=20

poles in search of that swarm of bees, which he imagines he hears humming, =
inside the pole.  In=20

the temperate zone bears mate in the summer months and the young are born l=
ate in January,=20

during hibernation.  Bear-cubs are very small babies for such large parents=
, weighing much less in=20

proportion to their dams than most other mammals.  They are blind, helpless=
 and almost hairless.=20

As the old bear is very fat when they are born and they do nothing but slee=
p in the dark den, they=20

grow rapidly, so that when they are finally brought forth at the age of per=
haps  It was nine o=E2=80=99clock=20

before they dined. The days were getting very long, and soft, and sweet; th=
e riding-parties lingered=20

amid the pink May and the tender twilight breeze. The Montairys dined to-da=
y at Crecy House, and=20

a charming married daughter without her husband, and Lord and Lady Clanmorn=
e, who were near=20

kin to the duchess, and themselves so good-looking and agreeable that they =
were as good at a=20

dinner-party as a couple of first-rate entr=C3=A9es. There was also Lord Ca=
risbrooke, a young man of=20

distinguished air and appearance; his own master, with a large estate, and =
three years or so older=20

than Lothair.  They dined in the Chinese saloon, which was of moderate dime=
nsions, but bright=20

with fantastic forms and colors, brilliantly lit up. It was the privilege o=
f Lothair to hand the duchess=20

to her seat. He observed that Lord Carisbrooke=20
