TIAN KINGS  In the=20

older conception, history was a record chiefly of battles, of intrigues, of=
 wicked deeds; it was true=20

that the evil that men did lived after them; at least, the even tenor of th=
eir ways was passed over=20

without notice by the chroniclers, and only a salient point, a great battle=
 or a great crime, attracted=20

attention. If little but deeds of violence is recorded about men, still les=

Who in their prayer are careless,    Who make a show [of devotion],    But =

Scripture, and the prophets, and who giveth money, notwithstanding his love=
 _of it_, to relations=20

perform their covenant when they covenant, and the patient in adversity and=

and observeth prayer, and payeth the [appointed] alms, and dreadeth none bu=

among the rightly-guided.     (ix. 18.)   LXIX.  O ye who have believed, ma=
ke not your alms of no=20

effect by reproach and harm, like him who expendeth his wealth to make a va=
in show unto men,=20

and believeth not in God and the Last Day. For his likeness is as the liken=

mediaeval chronicler condescend to bestow upon women. History has been unju=
st to women, and=20

this is preeminently the case in the history of France at the period with w=
hich we are to begin in=20

this chapter. The age of the good King Robert was an age of warfare; the ba=
sic principle of=20

feudalism was military service; and what position could women occupy in a s=
ocial system=20

dependent upon force? The general attitude toward women is hinted at by the=
 very fact that, in the=20

great war epic of Roland, the love story, upon which a modern poet would ha=
ve laid much stress,=20

is entirely subordinated; it is the hero and his marvellous valor that the =
poet keeps before us. The=20

heroine, if she can be so called, the sister of Roland's brother in arms, O=
liver, is not once named=20

by the hero. In the midst of the battle, when Roland proposes to sound his =
horn to summon=20

Charlemagne to his aid, Oliver reproaches him:                      "Par ce=
ste meie barbe!         Se puis=20

vedeir ma gente soror Aide,         Vos ne gerrez jamais entre sa brace."  =
(By my beard! if I live to=20

see my sister, the beautiful Aude, you shall never be her husband!) After t=
his she is mentioned no=20

more until Charlemagne returns to Aix with the sad news of Roland's heroic =
death. Then comes to=20

him _la belle Aude_ to ask where is her betrothed Roland. "Thou askest me f=
or one who is dead,"=20

says Charlemagne; "but I will give thee a better man, my son and heir, Loui=
s." "I=20

And the likeness of those who expend their wealth from a desire of God's be=
ing pleased, and from=20

assurance on their part,[166] is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill, o=
n which a violent rain hath=20

fallen, and it hath produced its fruit twofold: and if a violent rain fall =
not upon it, a gentle rain=20

_falleth_.     (ii. 266, 267.)   LXX.  If ye manifest alms, good will it be=
: but if ye conceal them and=20

give them to the poor, it will be better for you; and it will expiate _some=
_ of your sins.     (ii. 273.)=20

LXXI.  A kind speech and forgiveness are better than alms which hurt[167] f=
olloweth.     (ii. 265.)=20

LXXII.  Revile not what they invoke in preference to God,[168] lest they re=
vile God evilly without=20

knowledge.     (vi. 108.)   LXXIII.  Turn away _evil_ by that which is bett=
er: and lo, he between=20

whom and thyself [was] enmity [shall become] as though he were a warm frien=
d:  But none is=20

endowed with this[169] except those who have been patient, and none is endo=
wed with it except=20

he who is greatly favoured.[170]     (xli. 34, 35.)   LXXIV.  [+]If ye are =
greeted with a greeting, then=20

greet ye with a better greeting, or at least return it: verily God taketh c=
ount of all things.     (iv. 88.)=20

LXXV.  [+]If there be any [debtor] under a difficulty [of paying his debt],=
 let [his creditor] wait until it=20

be easy: but if ye remit it as alms, it will be better for you.     (ii. 28=
0.)[171] replies Aude. "God=20

forbid that I should survive Roland!" She falls fainting at the emperor's f=
eet, and when he lifts her=20

up he finds her dead. Then he calls four countesses, who bear the body into=
 a convent and inter it,=20

with great pomp, near the altar. (II. 3705-3731.) _La belle Aude_ has fulfi=
lled her mission when=20

she dies for love of Roland. If she had been on the battlefield, she might =
have dressed Roland's=20

wounds, since the role of physician and nurse was frequently played by wome=
n. Otherwise there=20

is little use for women in an age of warfare, and so we shall find most of =
the good women passed=20

over in silence, and only those of more masculine traits prominent in the e=
arlier parts of our story.=20

Before we can begin the story of those women whose names have come down to =
us from the=20

France of the year 1000, it is necessary to have some sort of understanding=
 of the social, if not of=20

the political, condition of France, to learn what sort of influences enviro=
ned and moulded the lives=20

of women in those days. Such a survey of society, indeed, will be useful fo=
r the whole period of the=20

Middle Ages, and will serve as a background for the figures of the women we=
 shall have to=20

consider, whether they be saints or sinners.  At the beginning of the reign=
 of the good King Robert,=20

the France over which he ruled was still scarcely consolidated. The power o=
f the kings of France=20

hardly yet extended,=20

_BELIEVERS AND UNBELIEVERS._   LXXVI.  [+]Dispute not with the people of th=

them as deal evilly [with=20

you]; and say [unto them], We believe in that which hath been sent down unt=
o us and [that which]=20

hath been sent down unto you, and our God and your God is one, and to Him a=
re we self-

ies of Orleans on the=20

south, Sens on the east, Saint-Denis on the north, and Chartres on the west=
. Not only were the=20

more powerful barons, counts, and dukes, among whom the land was parcelled =
out, subject to the=20

kings only at their good pleasure, but the very people over whom they direc=
tly ruled were still dimly=20

(xxix. 45.)   LXXVII.  Verily those who have believed,[175] and those who h=
ave become Jews, and=20

the Christians, and the Sabians, whosoever hath believed in God and the Las=
t Day, and hath done=20

that which is right,--they shall have their reward with their Lord, and _th=
ere shall come_ no fear=20

upon them, neither shall they grieve.     (ii. 59.)[176]   LXVIII.  Whoso d=
esireth any other religion=20

than El-Islam, it shall not be accepted of him, and in the world to come he=
 [shall be] of those that=20

perish.     (iii. 79.)   LXXIX.  The likeness of those who have disbelieved=
[177] is as the likeness of=20

him who crieth out to that which heareth not [aught] save a calling and a v=
oice. _They are_ deaf,=20

dumb, blind: therefore they do not understand.     (ii. 166.)   LXXX.  [As =
to] the unbelievers, their=20

works are like a vapour[178] in a plain, which the thirsty imagineth to be =
water, until when he=20

cometh to it he findeth it not aught:[179] (but he findeth God there, and H=
e fully payeth him his=20

account: and God is swift in reckoning:)  Or, races. Even as late as the mi=
ddle of the tenth century=20

we hear of "Goths, Romans, and Salians" as more or less distinct. The fusio=
n of the several races=20

on the soil of France was, however, at that time probably complete in all b=
ut name, if we except=20

the Celts in Brittany; even the latest arrivals in France, the Norsemen, ha=
d ceased to be mere=20

wandering freebooters and were fast developing, like the rest of France, a =
caste of hereditary=20

nobles whose title and power depended upon the tenure of land.  We may roug=
hly divide the=20

society of the period into four classes. In the first we must place the nob=
les and their bands of=20

retainers. In the second we find the churchmen, the greater among whom are =
hardly to be=20

distinguished from the secular nobility, Below these, and a long distance b=
elow, come the=20

inhabitants of the larger towns, the merchants and the better class of arti=
sans. At the bottom,=20

trodden down to the very soil from which they are forced to extract food fo=
r all the rest, and=20

perhaps, if any is left, for themselves,=20


_
them clouds,--darknesses one over another: when [one] putteth forth his han=
d he is not nearly=20

able to see it. And unto whomsoever God giveth not light, he hath no light.=

LXXXI.  Propound unto them as a parable two men, on one of whom[180] We bes=
towed  Since the=20

disruption of the great conglomerate empire of Charlemagne, the power of th=
e nominal kings of=20

France had been gradually restricted. Powerless to protect the kingdom from=
 the attacks of foreign=20

enemies, the king was also powerless to preserve order within it.=20
