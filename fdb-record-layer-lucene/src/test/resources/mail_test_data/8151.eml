Editor Chaseville, Florida August 28, 1936  WILLIAM SHERMAN   In Chaseville=
, Florida, about=20

twelve miles from Jacksonville on the south side of the Saint Johns River l=
ives William Sherman=20

(locally pronounced _Schumann_,) a former slave of Jack Davis, nephew of Pr=
esident Jefferson=20

Davis of the Confederacy. (1)  William Sherman was born on the plantation o=
f Jack Davis, about=20

five miles from Robertsville, South Carolina, at a place called "Black Swam=
p," June 12, 1842,=20

twenty-three years prior to Emancipation. His father who was also named Wil=
liam Sherman, was a=20

free man, having bought his freedom for eighteen hundred dollars from his m=
aster, John Jones,=20

who also lived in the vicinity of the Davis' plantation. William Sherman, s=
enior, bargained with his=20

master to obtain his freedom, however, for he did not have the money to rea=
dily pay him. He hired=20

himself out to some of the wealthy plantation owners and applied what he ea=
rned toward the=20

payment for his freedom. He was a skilled blacksmith and cabinet maker and =
his services were=20

always in demand. After procuring his freedom he bought a tract of land fro=
m his former master=20

and built a home and blacksmith shop on it. As was the custom during slaver=
y, a person who=20

bought his freedom had to have a guardian; Sherman's former master, John Jo=
nes, acted as his=20

guardian. Under this new order of things Sherman was in reality his own mas=
ter. He was not=20

"bossed," had his own hours, earned and kept his money, and was at liberty =
to leave the territory if=20

he desired. However, he remained and married Anna Georgia, the mother of Wi=
lliam Sherman,=20

junior. She was also a slave of Jack Davis. After William Sherman, senior, =
finished his day's work=20

he would go to the Davis plantation to visit his wife and sometimes remain =
for the night. It was his=20

intention to purchase the freedom of his wife Anna Georgia, and their son W=
illiam, but he died=20

before he had sufficient money to do so, and also before the Civil War, whi=
ch he predicted would=20

ensue between the North and South. His son William says that he remembers w=
ell the events that=20

led up to his becomes Anabaptist, Antinomian, Communist. At first he and hi=
s followers sweep the=20

country with a whirlwind of terror and destruction: but again the lords ral=
ly, bring up regular troops.=20

The peasants are brought to bay on their last hill side, behind a rampart f=
ormed of their waggons.=20

Their prophet assures them that the cannon-balls will fall harmless into hi=
s cloak. The cannon-

balls take their usual course: a butchery, then a train of torturings and e=
xecutions follows, the=20

Prince Bishop, among others, adding considerably to the whiteness of the Ch=
urch's robe. Luther is=20

accused of having incited the ferocity of the lords against those, who, it =
is alleged, had only carried=20



his own principles to an extreme. But in the first place Luther never taugh=
t Anabaptism or anything=20

that could logically lead to it; and in the second place, before he denounc=
ed the peasants, he tried=20

to mediate and rebuke the tyranny of the lords. No man deserves more sympat=
hy than a great=20

reformer, who is obliged to turn against the excesses of his own party. He =
becomes the object of=20

fierce hatred on one side, of exulting derision on the other; yet he is no =
traitor, but alone loyal to=20

his conscience and his cause.  The French Revolution was a political moveme=
nt among the=20

middle class in the cities, but among the peasantry in the country it was a=
n agrarian and labour=20

movement, and the dismantling of chateaux, and chasing away of their lords =
which then took place=20

were a renewal of the struggle which had given birth to the Jacquerie, the =
insurrection of Wat=20

Tyler, and the Peasants' War. This time the victory remained with the peasa=
nt, and the lord=20

returned no more.  In England, long after the Tudor period, industrial dist=
urbances took place, and=20

wild communistic fancies welled up from the depths of a suffering world of =
labour, when society=20

was stirred by political and religious revolution. Under the Commonwealth, =
communists went up on=20

the hill side, and began to break ground for a poor man's Utopia; and the g=
reat movement of the=20

Levellers, which had in it an economical as well as a political element, mi=
ght have overturned=20

society, if it had not been quelled by the strong hand of Cromwell. But in =
more recent times, within=20

living memory, within the memory of many here there were labour disturbance=
s in England,=20

compared with which the present industrial war is mild. [Footnote: For the =
following details, see=20

Martineau's "History of the Peace."] In 1816, there were outbreaks among th=
e suffering peasantry=20

which filled the governing classes with fear. In Suffolk nightly fires of i=
ncendiaries blazed in every=20

district, thrashing machines were broken or burnt in open day, mills were a=
ttacked. At Brandon=20

large bodies of workmen assembled to prescribe a maximum price of grain and=
 meat, and to pull=20

down the houses of butchers and bakers. They bore flags with the motto, "Br=
ead or Blood".=20

Insurgents from the Fen Country, a special scene of distress, assembled at =
Littleport, attacked the=20

house of a magistrate in the night, broke open shops, emptied the cellars o=
f public-houses,=20

marched on Ely, and filled the district for two days and nights with drunke=
n rioting and plunder.=20

The soldiery was called in; there was an affray in which blood flowed on bo=
th sides, then a special=20

commission and hangings to close the scene. Distressed colliers=20


_
six feet deep. It took them three days in which to dig it on account of the=
 hardness of the clay;=20

when it was finished he was put sorrowfully away by the white folk who thou=
ght so much of him.=20

William was a boy of nine at that time, and he remembers that his mother wa=
s so grieved that he=20

tried to console her by telling her not to worry "papa's goin' to com' back=
 and bring us some more=20

quails" (he had been accustomed to bringing them quails during his life) bu=
t William sorrowingly=20

said "he never did come back."  Anna Georgia was a cook and general house w=
oman in the Davis'=20

home. She was a half breed, her mother being a Cherokee Indian. Her husband=
, William, was a=20

descendant of the Cheehaw Indians, some of his a forbears being full-bloode=
d Cheehaws. Their=20

Indian blood was fully stopped works, and were with difficulty diverted fro=
m marching to London. In=20

1812, another stain of blood was added to the sanguinary criminal code of t=
hose days by the Act=20

making death the penalty for the destruction of machinery. This was caused =
by the Luddite=20

outrages, which were carried on in the most systematic manner, and on the l=
argest scale in=20

Nottingham and the adjoining counties. Bodies of desperadoes, armed and dis=
guised, went forth=20

under a leader, styled General Ludd, who divided them into bands, and align=
ed to each band its=20

work of destruction. Terror reigned around; the inhabitants were commanded =
to keep in their=20

houses and put out their lights on pain of death. In the silence of night h=
ouses and factories were=20

broken open, machines demolished, unfinished work scattered=20


_
states William junior. The Davis family tree as he knew it was as follows: =
three brothers, Sam,=20

Thomas and Jefferson Davis (President of the Confederacy.) Sam was the elde=
st of the three and=20

had four children, viz: Jack, Robert, Richard and Washington. Thomas had fo=
ur, viz: James,=20

Richard, Rusha and Minna. Jefferson Davis' family was not known to William =
as he lived in=20

Virginia, whereas, the other brothers and their families lived near each ot=
her at "Black Swamp."=20

Jack Davis, the master of William Sherman, was the son of Sam Davis, brothe=
r of Jefferson Davis.=20

Thomas and Sam Davis were comparatively large men, while Jefferson was thin=
 and of medium=20

height, resembling to a great extent the late Henry Flagler of Florida East=
 Coast fame, states=20

William. Many times he would come to visit his brothers at "Black Swamp." H=
e would drive up in a=20

two-wheeled buggy, drawn by a horse. Oft'times he visited his nephew, Jack =
and they would get=20

together in a lengthy conversation. Sometimes he would remain with the Davi=
s family for a few=20

days and then return to Virginia. On these visits William states that he sa=
w him personally. These=20

secrecy of the conspiracy baffled the efforts of justice and the death pena=
lty failed to put the=20

system down. Even the attempts made to relieve distress became new sources =
of discontent and=20

a soup kitchen riot at Glasgow led to a two days conflict between the soldi=
ery and the mob. In=20

1818, a threatening mass of Manchester spinners, on strike came into bloody=
 collision with the=20

military. Then there were rick burnings, farmers patrolling all night long,=
 gibbets erected on=20

Pennenden heath, and bodies swinging on them, bodies of boys, eighteen or n=
ineteen years old.=20

Six labourers of Dorsetshire, the most wretched county in England, were sen=
tenced to seven=20

years' transportation nominally for administering an illegal oath, really f=
or Unionism. Thereupon all=20

the trades made a menacing demonstration, marched to Westminster, thirty th=
ousand strong, with=20

a petition for the release of the labourers. London was in an agony of fear=
, the Duke of Wellington=20

prepared for a great conflict, pouring in troops and bringing up artillery =
from Woolwich. In 1840,=20

again there were formidable movements, and society felt itself on the crust=
 of a=20


_
prior to the Civil War. Jack Davis being a comparatively poor man had only =
eight slaves on his=20

plantation; they were housed in log cabins made of cypress timber notched t=
ogether in such a way=20

as to give it the appearance of having been built regular lumber. It was mu=
ch larger and of=20

different architecture than the slave cabins, however.  The few slaves that=
 he had arose at 4:00=20

o'clock in the morning and prepared themselves for the field. They stopped =
at noon for a light=20

lunch which they always took with them and at sun-down they quit work and w=
ent to their=20

respective cabins. Cotton, corn, potatoes and other commodities were raised=
. There was no=20

regular "overseer" employed. Davis, the master acted in that capacity. He w=
as very kind to them=20

and seldom used the whip. After the outbreak of the Civil War, white men ca=
lled "patarollers" were=20

posted around the various plantations to guard against runaways, and if sla=
ves were caught off=20

their masters, rewards offered for firing mills, workmen were beaten, drive=
n out of the country,=20

burned with vitriol, and, there was reason to fear, murdered. Great masses =
of operatives collected=20

for purposes of intimidation, shopkeepers were pillaged, collisions again t=
ook place between the=20

people and the soldiery. Irish agrarianism meanwhile prevailed, in a far mo=
re deadly form than at=20

present. And these industrial disturbances were connected with political di=
sturbances equally=20

formidable, with Chartism, Socialism, Cato Street conspiracies, Peterloo ma=
ssacres, Bristol riots.=20

Now the present movement even in England, where there is so much suffering =
and so much=20

ignorance, has been marked by a comparative absence of violence, and compar=
ative respect for=20

law. Considering what large bodies of men have been out on strike, how much=
 they have endured=20

in the conflict, and what appeals have been made to their passions, it is w=
onderful how little of=20
