consent that it should be levied,=E2=80=94which conduct gained him universa=

kingdom.                                  [A. D. 1405.]                    =
            CHAP. XXII.      JOHN DUKE OF=20

BURGUNDY, AFTER THE DEATH OF THE DUCHESS         MARGARET, IS RECEIVED BY T=
HE=20

PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FLANDERS         AS THEIR LORD.   At the commencement of=
 this year,=20

the duke of Burgundy, having paid his duty to the king of France at Paris, =
set out for Flanders,=20

attended by his brothers and a large company of the nobles of that country.=
 He was most=20

honourably and kindly received every where by his subjects, who made him ha=
ndsome presents,=20

more especially those of Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, and other great towns.  They=
 took the usual oaths=20

of fidelity to him, promising to serve him faithfully, as they were bound t=
o do. He then forbade all=20

his subjects to pay the tax last imposed at Paris by the king and his counc=
il, as has been=20

mentioned. This conduct greatly increased the hatred the duke of Orleans bo=
re him,=E2=80=94for at that=20

time the public affairs were governed according to his pleasure, insomuch t=
hat a stop was put to=20

the marriages before mentioned, between the children of the king and the du=
ke of Burgundy; and=20

the duke of Orleans was desirous to find out some other match for his nephe=
w, the duke of=20

Acquitaine, which highly displeased the duke of Burgundy when it came to hi=
s knowledge.  The=20

duke instantly sent his ambassadors to the king, the queen, and the great c=
ouncil,=E2=80=94but they had=20

no very agreeable answer to bring back to their master, by reason of which =
they returned as=20

speedily as they could to Flanders. Having heard their account, he consulte=
d his most confidential=20

ministers as to the manner in which he should act. They advised him to set =
out immediately for=20

Paris,=E2=80=94for that, being on the spot, he could pursue his business wi=
th the king and council with=20

more urgency, and greater expectation of success, than by ambassadors. He a=
ssented to this=20

advice, and made his preparations to go thither as speedily as he could.  A=
t this period, pope=20

Benedict XIII.[79], who resided and kept his court in the county of Provenc=
e, imposed a tax of a=20

tenth on his clergy. This tax was intended to hasten the union of our holy =
mother church, and was=20

to be paid at two terms, namely, at Easter, and on the feast of St Remy.=20

CHAP. XXIII.      DUKE WILLIAM COUNT OF HAINAULT PRESIDES AT A COMBAT FOR L=
IFE=20

OR DEATH, IN HIS TOWN OF QUESNOY, IN WHICH ONE OF THE         CHAMPIONS IS=
=20

SLAIN.   A mortal combat was this year fought in the town of Quesnoy, in th=
e presence of duke=20

William count of Hainault, judge of the field, between a gentleman named Bo=
urnecte, of the county=20

of Hainault, appellant, and another gentleman called Sohier Bunaige, of the=
 county of Flanders.=20

The cause of quarrel was, that Bournecte declared and maintained that Sohie=
r had killed and=20

murdered one of his near relations; and in this case, duke William had orde=
red lists to be prepared=20

at his expense, as was usual in such like instances.  The duke had in vain =
attempted several times=20

to reconcile them,=E2=80=94but finding them unwilling to consent, he ordere=
d them to appear before him at=20

a certain time and place, to decide their difference by combat. On the appo=
inted day, the appellant=20

entered the lists, accompanied by some of his nearest kindred, and was soon=
 followed by the=20

defendant.  Proclamation was then made in the duke=E2=80=99s name, by a her=
ald, that no one should dare=20

to give any hindrance to the combatants, under pain of death,=E2=80=94and t=
hen the champions were told=20

to do that there was only one means left of proving its identity. The boy h=
ad a whim during life of=20

permitting his nails to grow, and had not allowed them to be cut for many y=
ears previous to his=20

death. They had completely curled round the tips of his fingers and toes ti=
ll they had thus come to=20



extend along the palmar and plantar surfaces in a strange way. The counsel =
for the prosecution=20

availed himself of the knowledge of this fact, and his proof seemed to be c=
omplete, when a=20

medical man came forward and gave in evidence that it was not an unusual ci=
rcumstance for the=20

nails to grow for several inches after death. This astounding statement so =
nonplussed the judge=20

that the case was allowed to drop as not proven.  In exceptional cases the =
hair may be _green_. I=20

saw a case some years since, for which no cause could be assigned, and only=
 a few days ago I=20

saw another in a man who worked in a brass-foundry. At the Cronin trial a b=
arber, who had=20

counted the victim among his customers, recognized the shape of the head an=
d texture of the hair.=20

Subsequent evidence of medical experts was conclusive as to the identity of=
 hair found clinging to=20

a trunk, the hair cut from the head of the murdered man, and that of a sing=
le hair discovered on a=20

cake of soap. This single strand, being lighter in color in some portions t=
han in others, seemed to=20

indicate that it could not have come from the head of the deceased, whose h=
air was brown. But it=20

was shown that hair placed on soap or other alkaline substances becomes ble=
ached in a manner=20

similar to the color of a single thread. This evidence of vital importance =
linked the hair found in the=20

trunk with that cut from Dr. Cronin=E2=80=99s head, and went far toward pro=
ving that one of the murderers=20

had washed his hands with the soap after the deed had been done.  Reviewing=
 the signs=20

furnished by the osseous system, it will be seen that the study of the skel=
eton alone is beyond=20

contradiction more satisfactory and more important in establishing identity=
 than that of all the other=20

organs. Consequently a correct interpretation of the facts observed and jud=
icious application of the=20

rules deducible therefrom may in the matter of a human skeleton put its ide=
ntity beyond a=20

reasonable doubt. But the expert should remember that as no two cases are j=
ust alike, unexpected=20

questions and unforeseen features may present themselves, giving to each ca=
se merits of its own.=20

At best the medical man=E2=80=99s conclusions will be probabilities, not ce=
rtainties; therefore his=20

expressions of opinion should be the more guarded, as upon it may hang the =
life of an innocent=20

man.   IDENTIFICATION OF MUTILATED REMAINS.  Many of the foregoing remarks =
on the=20

identity of the skeleton apply in cases where mutilated remains or a portio=
n only of the body has=20

been recovered. Circumstances often occur in which bodies may require ident=
ification after having=20

been drowned and partly eaten by fishes or crabs, or after having been part=
ly eaten by buzzards,=20

or torn into fragments by animals, as has happened in the remains of a dead=
 infant partly=20

devoured by a dog, and in the case of a farmer who died in the woods and wa=
s subsequently=20

eaten by his own hogs. After accidents and fires where many persons perish;=
 after a railway=20

disaster where bodies have been mangled, drowned, burnt, and frozen, all in=
 the same accident;=20

or after an explosion from steam or gas or in a mine, or from gunpowder, dy=
namite, or other=20

substance, the human remains are generally in such a state as to defy all a=
ttempts at recognition.=20

To dispose of a dead body in order to avoid detection, criminals will mutil=
ate, disfigure, and chop=20

into fragments the remains, which they afterward place in a trunk, a=20


_
last proclamation, the appellant first left his pavilion, and advanced to m=
eet the defendant. When=20

they had thrown each their lances without effect, they drew their swords, a=
nd fought for a short=20

time; but Bournecte soon overcame his adversary, and made him publicly avow=
 the truth of the=20

charge he had made against him, and for which he called him to the combat. =
The vanquished man=20

was speedily condemned by the duke to be beheaded;=E2=80=94which sentence w=
as instantly executed,=20

and the conqueror led in triumph to his h=C3=B4tel. He was greatly honoured=
 and respected by all the=20

nobility,=E2=80=94and it was reported that the duke of Orleans had been pre=
sent at this combat in=20

disguise.                                   CHAP. XXIV.      THE COUNT DE S=
AINT POL MARCHES AN=20

ARMY BEFORE THE CASTLE OF         MERCQ, WHERE THE ENGLISH FROM CALAIS MEET=
=20

AND DISCOMFIT         HIM.   In the month of May of this year, Waleran de L=
uxembourg, count de=20

Ligny and de St Pol, governor for the king of France in Picardy, assembled =
in that country and in=20

the Boulonois from four to five hundred men at arms, five hundred genoese c=
ross-bows, and about=20

one thousand Flemings on foot, from the country about Gravelines. hiding-pl=
ace. Scarcely a year=20

passes that judiciary medicine is not concerned with cases of the kind. The=
 frequency of such=20

crimes has been attributed by some to the so-called contagion of murder; ot=
hers offer the simple=20

law of the series in explanation; others still believe that imitation is th=
e principal cause. While there=20

is no doubt a grain of truth in each of these, less philosophic minds will =
look upon such a beastly=20

proceeding as a mark of the complete satisfaction sought by the destructive=
 instinct.  Why such=20

things should be is of less concern than the fact that criminal mutilation =
of the dead body is not=20

confined to any age or country. Though more frequent in the last fifteen ye=
ars, it takes up quite a=20

space in the history of human cruelty. The violent passion, wrath, and veng=
eance that caused the=20

prophet Isaiah to be sawn in two at the age of one hundred years by order o=
f Manasses and Agag=20

cut into pieces by Samuel have not materially changed in the days of Jack t=
he Ripper; and we find=20

such crimes in antipodal parts of the world, among varied sociological cond=
itions, no matter=20

whether it be the North American Indian, who scalps and mutilates his enemy=
 and=20

Tournehen, and thence advanced to lay siege to a castle called Mercq, in th=
e possession of the=20

English, who from that place, and other garrisons, had greatly harrassed th=
e Boulonois and the=20

adjacent countries.  The count caused many engines to be erected against th=
is castle, which much=20

annoyed the garrison, who defended themselves courageously. The count saw h=
e could not gain=20

the place by storm without great difficulty and loss of men, and in consequ=
ence lodged his army in=20

the houses of the town that were surrounded by old ditches, which he had re=
paired to secure=20

himself against his enemies, as well severed penis in the mouth, or the civ=
ilized European, who=20

cuts up the body of his victim and serves it in a curry at a feast of assem=
bled friends.[584]  This=20

new point of judiciary medicine has lately been elaborated by European writ=
ers under the title of=20

_D=C3=A9pe=C3=A7age Criminel_, a term which applies to the operation resort=
ed to by an assassin having for=20

its end the getting rid of the body of the victim and to render more diffic=
ult the establishment of its=20
