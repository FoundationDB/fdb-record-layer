philodendron monstera found in many other specimens of the Sanskrit drama, =
which has set itself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The lac=
k of dramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by lyrica=
l beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we might=
 not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than as dram=
as. In The Little Clay the external pomp and decoration of the feudal world=
 became more brilliant than ever. War was a trade practised from motives of=
 vulgar cupidity; but it was adorned with splendour, and had a show of gall=
antry. The presenter in literature of this glittering spectacle is the hist=
orian JEAN FROISSART. Born in 1338, at Valenciennes, of bourgeois parents, =
Froissart, at the age of philodendron monstera found in many other specimen=
s of the Sanskrit drama, which has set itself an ideal different from that =
of our own drama. The lack of dramatic unity and consistency is often compe=
nsated, indeed, by lyrical beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the =
question whether we might not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dr=

ation of the feudal world became more brilliant than ever. War was a trade =
practised from motives of vulgar cupidity; but it was adorned with splendou=
r, and had a show of gallantry. The presenter in literature of this glitter=
ing spectacle is the historian JEAN FROISSART. Born in 1338, at Valencienne=
s, of bourgeois parents, Froissart, at the age of _
_Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low_.                   (_i. 48_)  To =
him, life itself is not dear, but only=20

honor.[18] He values wealth only as it supplies him with the means of servi=
ng others. We may,=20

with some justice, compare him with Antonio in The Merchant of Venice. Ther=
e is some=20

inconsistency, from our point of view, in making such a character the hero =
of a love-drama; and=20

indeed, it is Vasantasena who does most of the love-making.[19]  Vasantasen=
a is a character with=20

neither the girlish charm of Shakuntala[20] nor the mature womanly dignity =
of Sita.[21] She is more=20

admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her love as true as s=
teel; this too, in a social=20

position which makes such constancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a g=
reat character; she=20

does not seem so true to life as her clever maid, Madanika. In making the h=
eroine of his play a=20

courtezan, Shudraka follows a suggestion of the technical works on the dram=
a; he does not=20

thereby cast any imputation of ill on Vasantasena's character. The courteza=
n class in India=20

corresponded roughly to the hetaerae of ancient Greece or the geishas of Ja=
pan; it was possible=20

to be a courtezan and retain one's self-respect. Yet the inherited[22] way =
of life proves distasteful=20

to Vasantasena; her one desire is to escape its limitations and its dangers=
 by becoming a legal=20

wife.[23]  In Maitreya, the Vidushaka, we find an instance of our author's =
masterly skill in giving life=20

to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition. The Vidushaka is a stock chara=
cter who has something=20

in common with a jester; and in Maitreya the essential traits of the charac=
ter--eagerness for good=20

food and other creature comforts, and blundering devotion to his friend--ar=
e retained, to be sure,=20

but clarified and elevated by his quaint humor and his readiness to follow =
Charudatta even in=20

death. The grosser traits of the typical Vidushaka are lacking. Maitreya is=
 neither a glutton nor a=20

fool, but a simple-minded, whole-hearted friend.  The courtier is another c=
haracter suggested by=20

the technical works, and transformed by the genius of Shudraka. He is a man=
 not only of=20

education and social refinement, but also of real nobility of nature. But h=
e is in a false position from=20

the first, this true gentleman at the wretched court of King Palaka; at las=
t he finds the courage to=20

break away, and risks life, and all that makes life attractive, by backing =
Aryaka. Of all the=20

conspirators, it is he who runs the greatest risk. To his protection of Vas=
antasena is added a touch=20

of infinite pathos when we remember that he was himself in love with her.[2=
4] Only when=20

Vasantasena leaves him[25] without a thought, to enter Charudatta's house, =
does he realize how=20

much he loves her; then, indeed, he breaks forth in words of the most passi=
onate jealousy. We=20

need not linger over the other characters, except to observe that each has =
his marked=20

individuality, and that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society =
that seems at first so=20

remote.   But among the prose narratives to which the thirteenth century ga=
ve birth, the _Histoire=20

de Saint Louis_, by JEAN DE JOINVILLE, stands pre-eminent. Joinville, born =
about 1224,=20

possessed of such literary culture as could be gained at the Court of Thiba=
ut IV. of Champagne,=20

became a favoured companion of the chivalric and saintly Louis during his s=
ix years' Crusade from=20

1248 to 1254. The memory of the King remained the most precious possession =
of his follower's=20

elder years. It is probable that soon after 1272 Joinville prepared an auto=
biographic fragment,=20

dealing with that period of his youth which had been his age of adventure. =
When he was nearly=20

eighty, Jeanne of Navarre, wife of Philippe le Bel, invited the old senesch=
al to put on record the=20

holy words and good deeds of Saint Louis. Joinville willingly acceded to th=
e request, and=20

incorporating the fragment of autobiography, in which the writer appeared i=
n close connection with=20

his King, he had probably almost completed his work at the date of Queen Je=
anne's death (April 2,=20



1305); to her son, afterwards Louis X., it was dedicated. His purpose was t=
o recite the pious words=20

and set forth the Christian virtues of the royal Saint in one book of the H=
istory, and to relate his=20

chivalric actions in the other; but Joinville had not the art of constructi=
on, he suffered from the=20

feebleness of old age, and he could not perfectly accomplish his design; in=
 1317 Joinville died.=20

Deriving some of his materials from other memoirs of the King, especially t=
hose by Geoffroy de=20

Beaulieu and Guillaume de Nangis, he drew mainly upon his own recollections=
. Unhappily the=20

most authoritative manuscripts of the _Histoire de Saint Louis_ have been l=
ost; we possess none=20

earlier than the close of the fourteenth century; but by the learning and s=
kill of a modern editor the=20

text has been substantially established.  We must not expect from Joinville=
 precision of chronology=20

or exactitude in the details of military operations. His recollections crow=
d upon him; he does not=20

marshal them by power of intellect, but abandons himself to the delights of=
 memory. He is a frank,=20

amiable, spirited talker, who has much to tell; he succeeds in giving us tw=
o admirable portraits--his=20

own and that of the King; and unconsciously he conveys into his narrative b=
oth the chivalric spirit=20

of his time, and a sense of those prosaic realities which tempered the idea=
ls of chivalry. What his=20

eyes had rested on lives in his memory, with all its picturesque features, =
all its lines and colours,=20

undimmed by time; and his curious eyes had been open to things great and sm=
all. He appears as=20

a brave soldier, but, he confesses, capable of mortal fear; sincerely devou=
t, but not made for=20

martyrdom; zealous for his master's cause, but not naturally a chaser of ra=
inbow dreams; one who=20

enjoys good cheer, who prefers his wine unallayed with water, who loves spl=
endid attire, who=20

thinks longingly of his pleasant chateau, and the children awaiting his ret=
urn; one who will decline=20

future=20


_
This humor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its situations. =
The plays on words can=20

seldom be adequately reproduced in translation, but the situations are inde=
pendent of language.=20

And Shudraka's humor runs the whole gamut, from grim to farcical, from sati=
rical to quaint. Its by=20

remaining in his own fields among his humble dependants. But Joinville felt=
 deeply the attraction of=20

a nature more under the control of high, ideal motives than was his own; he=
 would not himself=20

wash the feet of the poor; he would rather commit thirty mortal sins than b=
e a leper; but a=20


_
Shudraka need not fear a comparison with the greatest of Occidental writers=
 of comedies.  It=20

remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously, it is =
too long. More than this,=20

the main action halts through acts ii. to v., and during these episodic act=
s we almost forget that the=20

main plot concerns the love of Vasantasena and Charudatta. Indeed, we have =
in The Little Clay=20

Cart the material for two plays. The larger part of act i. forms with acts =
vi. to x. a consistent and=20

ingenious are unattainable by himself. And, at the same time, he makes us f=
eel that Louis is not=20

the less a man because he is a saint. Certain human infirmities of temper a=
re his; yet his=20

magnanimity, his sense of justice, his ardent devotion, his charity, his pu=
re self-surrender are=20

made so sensible to us as we read the record of Joinville that we are willi=
ng to subscribe to the=20

sentence of Voltaire: "It is not given to man to carry virtue to a higher p=
oint."  During the fourteenth=20

century the higher spirit=20


_
remainder of act i. might be combined with acts iii. to v. to make a pleasi=
ng comedy of lighter tone.=20

The second act, clever as it is, has little real connection either with the=
 main plot or with the story=20

of the gems. The breadth of treatment which is observable in this declined;=
 the old faith and the=20

old chivalry were suffering a decay; the bourgeoisie grew in power and soug=
ht for instruction; it=20

was an age of prose, in which learning was passing to the laity, or was ada=
pted to their uses. Yet,=20

while the inner life of chivalry failed day=20
