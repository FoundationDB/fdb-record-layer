younger boy had ensconced himself just under the brink of a steep bank at the bottom of which 

was Rolling River, a swift and deep stream. His brother's story was that he had come up facing 

this place, having started a young buck not half a mile away. He thought he heard the buck 

stamping, and blowing, and then saw what he thought was the animal behind a fringe of bushes at 

the top of this steep river bank.  The hunter blazed away, and heard a dreadful scream, a rolling 

and thrashing in the brush, and a splash in the river. He ran forward and found his brother's old 

gun and tippet. There was blood on the bushes. The supposition was that Fred Hatfield had been 

shot and had rolled into the swift-flowing river. 'Lias had given himself up to the authorities and 

there seemed some doubt in the minds of the people of Scarboro as to whether the shooting had 

been an accident.  "If there was no body found," thought Ruth, all the time she was eating the 

supper that Mary brought her, "how do they know Fred Hatfield is really dead? And if he _is_ 

dead, who is the boy who is traveling about the country using Fred Hatfield's name and carrying 

Mr. Hatfield's old wallet? I guess Fred has run away, instead of being killed, and is staying away 

because he hates his brother 'Lias, and wishes him to get into trouble about the shooting. If that's 

so, isn't he just the meanest boy that ever was?"  Long Jerry Todd came in with a huge armful of 

wood for the fire, and Ruth determined to pump him about the accident. The tall man knew all 

about it, and was willing enough to talk.  He sat down beside the fire and answered Ruth's 

questions most cheerfully.  "Ya-as, I knowed old man Hatfield," he said. "He's been dead goin' on 

ten year. That Fred wasn't good to his mother. His half-brothers-- children of Old Man Hatfield's 

fust wife--is nicer to their marm than Fred was. Oh, ya-as! he was shot by 'Lias, all right. I dunno 

as 'Lias meant to do it. Hope not. But they found Fred's body in the river t'other day, and so they 

arrested 'Lias."  But Long Jerry hadn't seen any sign of the boy that had been with Ruth and the 

hermit when they arrived at Snow Camp. Ruth did not like to discuss the mystery with him any 

more; for it _was_ a mystery now, that was sure. Fred Hatfield's body had been found in the river, 

yet a boy was traveling about the country bearing Fred Hatfield's name.  The guide finally unfolded 

himself and rose slowly to his full height, preparatory to going back to the kitchen regions. He was 

nearly seven feet tall, and painfully thin. He grinned down upon Ruth Fielding as she gazed in 

wonder at his proportions.  "I'm some long; ain't I, Miss?" he chuckled. "But I warn't no taller than 

av'rage folks when I was a boy. You hear of some folks gettin' stunted by sickness, or fright, or the 

like. Wal, I reckon _I_ got stretched out longer'n common by fright. Want to hear about it?"  He 

was so jolly and funny that Ruth was glad to hear him talk and she encouraged him to go on. So 

Jerry sat down again and began his story.     CHAPTER X  BEARS--AND OTHER THINGS   "Ye 

see," drawled Jerry, "my marm was alive in them days--bless her heart! Dad was killed on the 

boom down Rolling River when I was a little shaver; but marm hung on till I got growed. Ya-as! I 

hame, no doubt, in a day or twa, as ye say, sir, and glad, glad we'll a' be. It's not that we have any 

doubt--but oh! what will his mammaw say to me?" cried Bauby. After the tremulous momentary 

stand she had made, her tears flowed faster than ever. "There has no such thing happened 

among the Erskines since ever the name was kent in the country-side, and that's maist from the 

beginning, as it's written in Scripture." "It's all a mistake," cried Beaufort. "That it is--that it is," cried 

Bauby, drying her eyes. And then she added with another curtsey, "I hope you'll find everything to 

your satisfaction, sir, till the maister comes hame. Tammas--that's the butler, Tammas Rolls, my 

brother, sir, if ye please--is no' at hame to-night, and you wouldna like a lass aboot to valet ye; 



they're all young but me. But if you would put out your cloes to brush, or anything that wants 

doing, outside your door, it shall a' be weel attended to. I'm real sorry there's no' another man 

aboot the house: but a' that women can do we'll do, and with goodwill." "You are very kind, Mrs 

Rolls," said Beaufort. "I was not thinking of myself--you must not mind me. I shall get on very well. 

I am sorry to be a trouble to you at such a melancholy moment." "Na, na, sir, not melancholy," 

cried Bauby, with her eyes streaming; "sin' ye say, and a'body must allow, that it's just a mistake: 

we manna be put aboot by suchlike trifles. But nae doubt it will be livelier and mair pleesant for 

yoursel', sir, when Mr John and Tammas, they baith come hame. Would you be wanting anything 

more to-night?" "Na, I never let on," Bauby said, when she retired to the ready support of her 

handmaidens outside the door--"no' me; I keepit a stout heart, and I said to him, 'It's of nae 

consequence, sir,' I said,--'I'm nane cast down; it's just a mistake--everybody kens that; and that 

he was to put his things outside his door,' He got nothing that would go against the credit of the 

house out of me."  But in spite of this forlorn confidence in her powers of baffling suspicion, it was 

a wretched night that poor Bauby spent. John was satisfactorily accounted for, and it was known 

where he was; but who could say where Rolls might be? Bauby sat up half through the night alone 

in the great empty kitchen with the solemn-sounding clock and the cat purring loudly by the fire. 

She was as little used to the noises of the night as Lord Rintoul was, and in her agony of watching 

felt the perpetual shock and thrill of the unknown going through and through her. She heard steps 

coming up to the house a hundred times through the night, and stealing stealthily about the doors. 

"Is that you, Tammas?" she said again and again, peering out into the night: but nobody appeared. 

Nor did he appear next day, or the next. After her first panic, Bauby gave out that he was with his 

master--that she had never expected him--in order to secure him from remark. But in her own 

mind horrible doubts arose. He had always been the most irreproachable of men; but what if, in 

the shock of this catastrophe, even Tammas should have taken to ill ways? Drink--that was the 

natural suggestion. Who can fathom the inscrutable attractions it has, so that men yield to it who 

never could have been suspected of such a weakness? Most women 


_
I got clean through growin' and that was long after I voted fust time," and he chuckled and wagged 

his head.  "Wal, mebbe I was sixteen; mebbe seventeen. Boys up here in the woods have to cut 

their own vittles pretty airly. I was doin' a man's labor when I was 'leven. Ya-as, Miss! Had to work 

for me an' marm.  "And marm worked, too. One day I started for Drownville with a big bundle of 

aperns marm had sewed for Mis' Juneberry that kep' store at Drownville. She got two bits a dozen 

for makin' lower classes have the conviction that no man can resist it. Heart-wrung for his master, 

shamed to his soul for the credit of the house, had Rolls, too, after successfully combating 

temptation for all his respectable life, yielded to the demon? Bauby trembled, but kept her terrors 

to herself. She said he might come back at any moment--he was with his maister. Where else was 

it likely at such a time that he should be?  But Rolls was not with his master. He was on the eve of 

a great and momentous 


_
remember. Wal, it was a wilder country then than it is now, and I never see a soul, nor heard the 

sound of an axe in walking four miles. Just at the end o' them four miles," continued Long Jerry, 

his eyes twinkling, "there was a turn in the road. I swung around it--I was travelin' at a good clip--

and come facin' up an old she b'ar which riz up on her hind laigs an' said: 'How-d'-do, Jerry Todd!' 

jest as plain as ever a bear spoke in its e-tar-nal life!  "Why," said Long Jerry, almost choking with 

his own laughter, "by the smile on thet thar b'ar's face and the way she spread her arms wide to 

receive me, it was plain enough how glad she was ter see me."  "I should think you'd have been 

scared to death!" gasped Ruth, looking down at him.  "Wal, I calculate I was some Rintoul, and no 

question in his mind what to do. Before he left Dalrulzian that sad morning, he had shaped all the 

possibilities in his thoughts, and knew what he intended; and his conversation with Mr Monypenny 

gave substance and a certain reasonableness to his resolution. But it was not in his nature by one 

impetuous movement to precipitate affairs. He had never in his life acted hastily, and he had 

occasional tremors of the flesh which chilled his impulse and made him pause. But the interval, 

which was so bitter to his master, although all the lookers-on congratulated themselves it could do 

him no harm, was exactly what Rolls wanted in the extraordinary crisis to which he had come. A 

humble person, quite unheroic in his habits as in his antecedents, it was

days than I be now. Hadn't seen so much of the world. And sure hadn't seen so much o' b'ars," 

cackled Jerry. "Not bein' used to b'ar sassiety I natcherly balked when that ol' she b'ar appeared 

so lovin'. I had pretty nigh walked right into her arms and there wasn't much chance to make any 

particular entered his mind should have been carried out with the enthusiastic impulse of romantic 

youth. But few youths, however romantic, would have entertained such a purpose as that which 

now occupied Rolls. There are many who would risk a great deal to smuggle an illustrious prisoner 

out of his prison. But
