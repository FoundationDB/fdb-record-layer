during his mystic life; Porphyry asserts that Apollonius of Tyana       was thus united four times to 

his deity--a statement which we believe       to be a mistake, since Apollonius was a Nirmanakaya 

(divine       incarnation--not Avatara)--and he (Porphyry) only once, when over       sixty years of 

age. Theophany (or the actual appearance of a God to       man), Theopathy (or "assimilation of 

divine nature"), and       Theopneusty (inspiration, or rather the mysterious power to hear       orally 

the teachings of a God) have never been rightly understood.     99 Karana Sharira is the "causal" 

body and is sometimes said to be the       "personal God." And so it is, in one sense.    100 This 

would be in one sense Self-worship.    101 "The Gods exist," said Epicurus, "but they are not what 

the _hoi       polloi_ [the multitude] suppose them to be. He is not an infidel or       atheist who 

denies the existence of Gods whom the multitude worship,       but he is such who fastens on the 

Gods the opinions of the       multitude."    102 Esoteric, as exoteric, Buddhism rejects the theory 

that Gautama was       an incarnation or Avatara of Vishnu, but teaches the doctrine as       herein 

explained. Every man has in him the materials, if not the       conditions, for theophanic intercourse 

and Theopneusty, the       inspiring "God" being, however, in every case, his own Higher Self, 

or divine prototype.    103 One entirely and not killed me outright. However insignificant I am, I am 

sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death."  "Be easy," said 

D'Artagnan, "he will know all before night."  The little troop recommenced their march, and at the 

end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead.  "My 

dear friends," said D'Artagnan, "give your swords to Monsieur Mouston, who will return them to 

you at the proper time and place, and do not forget you are our prisoners."  It was not long before 

they joined the escort. The king was riding in front, surrounded by troopers, and when he saw 

Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks.  D'Artagnan passed to the head of 

the column, and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos, went straight to Harrison, who 

recognized him as having met him at Cromwell's and received him as politely as a man of his 

breeding and disposition could. It turned out as D'Artagnan had foreseen. The colonel neither had 

nor could have any suspicion.  They halted for the king to dine. This time, however, due 

precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape. In the large room of the hotel a small 

table was placed for him and a large one for the officers.  "Will you dine with me?" asked Harrison 

of D'Artagnan.  "Gad, I should be very happy, but I have my companion, Monsieur du Vallon, and 

the two prisoners, whom I cannot leave. Let us manage it better.

reader ever meditated upon the       suggestive like from yours."  "Good," answered Harrison.  The 

matter was arranged as D'Artagnan had suggested, and when he returned he found the king 

already seated at his little table, where Parry waited on him, Harrison and his officers sitting 

together at another table, and, in a corner, places reserved for himself and his companions.  The 

table at which the Puritan
