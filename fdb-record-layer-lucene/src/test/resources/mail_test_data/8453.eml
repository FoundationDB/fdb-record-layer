generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Founda=
tion was created to=20

provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future g=

more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your e=

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundat=
ion  The Project=20

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational=
 corporation organized=20

under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by=
 the Internal Revenue=20

Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-62=
21541. Contributions to=20

the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the=
 full extent permitted by=20

U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's principal office=
 is in Fairbanks, Alaska,=20

with the mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its volun=
teers and employees=20

are scattered throughout numerous locations. Its business office is located=
 at 809 North 1500 ends=20

a short distance from the ground; by twisting a rope several times around t=
he neck and then tying=20

it (the coils may continue to compress even after death); by tightening the=
 cord with a stick or other=20

firm substance; by tightening the cords or knots by means of the hands or f=
eet or some portion of=20

the lower limbs; by the use of a woollen garter passed twice around the nec=
k and secured in front=20

by two simple knots, strongly tied one to another.  It is difficult to simu=
late suicide; requires great=20

skill and premeditation on the part of a murderer. =E2=80=9CThe attitude of=
 the body, the condition of the=20

dress, the means of strangulation, the presence of marks of violence or of =
blood on the person of=20

the deceased, on his clothes or the furniture of the room, or both, rope or=
 ligature, are=20



circumstances from which, if observed at the time, important medical infere=
nces may be drawn.=E2=80=9D=20

The assassin either does too little or too much. Taylor[795] cites a number=
 of cases of simulation.=20

Strangulation is generally HOMICIDAL. The marks of fingers or of a ligature=
 on the neck suggest=20

homicide. This is true even if the mark is slight; because infants and weak=
ly persons may be=20

strangled by the pressure of the hands on the throat. Even a strong man, su=
ddenly assaulted, may=20

lose his presence of mind and, with that, his power of resistance; with app=
roaching insensibility his=20

strength still further diminishes. This is true even if his assailant is th=
e less powerful. It requires=20

more address to place a ligature on the neck than to strangle with the hand=
.  A victim may be=20

made insensible by drugs or blows and then strangled by a small amount of c=
ompression; or=20

suffocation by gags and strangulation may both be attempted.  The importanc=
e of considering the=20

position and number of the knots in a cord is mentioned under suicidal stra=
ngulation.  In homicide,=20

in addition to the marks on the neck, there is likely to be evidence of a s=
truggle and marks of=20

violence elsewhere on the body. It is important, therefore, to notice any e=
vidence of such a=20

struggle.  The nature of the cord may assist in identifying the assailant. =
 It must be remembered=20

that homicidal strangulation may be committed without disturbing noise even=
 when other persons=20

are near.   =3DSimulation.=3D=E2=80=94False accusations of homicidal strang=
ulation are on  record.=20

Tardieu[796] states that a distinguished young woman (for  some political p=
urpose) was found one=20

evening at the door of her room  apparently in great trouble and unable to =
speak. She first=20

indicated  by gestures and then by writing that she had been assaulted by a=
  man who tried to=20

strangle her with his hand, and also struck her  twice in the breast with a=
 dagger. She was=20

absolutely mute=E2=80=94did not  even attempt to speak=E2=80=94quite contra=
ry to what is always observed in=20

unfinished homicidal strangulation. On examination by Tardieu, no sign  of =
attempt to strangle was=20

found, and the so-called dagger-openings  in her dress and corset did not c=
orrespond in position.=20

She confessed  that she had attempted deception.   The celebrated Roux-Arma=
nd[797] case was=20

another instance of  attempted deception. A servant named Roux was found on=
 the ground  in the=20

cellar of his employer Armand; his hands and legs were tied  and there=20
