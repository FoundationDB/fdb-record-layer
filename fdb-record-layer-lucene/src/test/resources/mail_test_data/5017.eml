 The immediate effect of=20

this mission of the Camellia Buds was a decided improvement in the conditio=
ns of the juniors. Next=20

morning, at lunch-time, a stern-faced contingent mounted guard over the bis=
cuits, and when=20

Bertha and Mabel, plainly bent on piracy, sauntered down the room, they wer=
e told certain=20

unpalatable home truths, and ignominiously put to rout.  "Stop that instant=
er!" commanded=20

Peachy.  "We're here to see fair play!" snarled Jess.  "Be content with you=

Delia.  "Well, really! Who asked you to boss _us_?" retorted Bertha angrily=

don't know what flags you class yourselves under, but I'm sure neither Amer=

be proud to own you--you biscuit-snatchers!"  Peachy's eyes were snapping s=
parks, and the=20

matter might have waxed even warmer had not Rachel reentered the room for a=
 pencil she had=20

dropped. The head prefect pricked up her ears at the sound of the disturban=
ce, whereupon Mabel=20

and Bertha, who knew they would receive short shrift if she demanded an exp=
lanation, made a=20

hasty exit, merely murmuring to Jess and Peachy as they pushed past them:  =
"We'll pay you out=20

for this!"  "Just you wait!"     CHAPTER VI  Among the Olive Groves   Quite=
 by accident as it=20

seemed, the Sorority of the Camellia Buds had turned itself from a society =
instituted for mutual=20

protection and fun into a Crusaders' Union, pledged, like Spenser's Red Cro=
ss Knight, to avenge=20

the wrongs of distressed damsels in the junior forms. The ring of battle ce=
rtainly added a spice of=20

excitement to their secret. It was much more interesting to interfere perso=
nally on behalf of their=20

protegees than to place debatable matters before the prefects. If war were =
involved with another=20

sorority it the legua nautica of 6650 varas, or of 2854 toises (20 in a deg=
ree), was originally used=20

in Mexico and throughout South America; but this legua nautica has been gra=
dually reduced to=20

one-half or one-third, on account of the slowness of travelling across stee=
p mountains, or dry and=20

burning plains. The common people measure only time directly; and then, by =
arbitrary hypotheses,=20

infer from the time the space of ground travelled over. In the course of my=
 geographical=20

researches, I have had frequent opportunities of examining the real value o=
f these leagues, by=20

comparing the itinerary distances between points lying under the same merid=
ian with the=20

difference of latitudes.) Oviedo, who must so often have passed over the va=
lleys of Aragua,=20

asserts that the town of Nueva Valencia del Rey was built in 1555, at the d=
istance of half a league=20

from the lake; and that the proportion between the length of the lake and i=
ts breadth, is as seven to=20

three. At present, the town of Valencia is separated from the lake by level=
 ground of more than two=20

thousand seven hundred toises (which Oviedo would no doubt have estimated a=
s a space of a=20

league and a half); and the length of the basin of the lake is to its bread=
th as 10 to 2.3, or as 7 to=20

1.6. The appearance of the soil between Valencia and Guigue, the little hil=
ls rising abruptly in the=20

plain east of the Cano de Cambury, some of which (el Islote and la Isla de =
la Negra or=20

Caratapona) have even preserved the name of islands, sufficiently prove tha=
t the waters have=20

retired considerably since the time of Oviedo. With respect to the change i=
n the general form of the=20

lake, it appears to me improbable that in the seventeenth century its bread=
th was nearly the half of=20

its length. The situation of the granite mountains of Mariara and of Guigue=
, the slope of the ground=20

which rises more rapidly towards the north and south than towards the east =
and west, are alike=20

repugnant to this supposition.  In treating the long-discussed question of =
the diminution of the=20


_
there undoubtedly was. Bertha and Mabel, too clever to court open ignominy,=
 desisted for the=20

present from biscuit-snatching, but sought other means of retaliation. It w=
as unfortunate for Irene=20

and Lorna that Mabel had been apportioned to them as a roommate. Both she a=
nd Elsie were=20

members of the rival sorority, so there was division in No. 3 dormitory. So=
metimes the opposing=20

factions would not speak to one another at all. Elsie was more stand-off th=
an actively disagreeable=20

and kept herself to her own cubicle, but Mabel was openly annoying. She tra=
nsgressed every rule=20

of dormitory etiquette, dashed for the bathroom instead of waiting her due =
turn, dumped her=20

belongings on to other people's chairs, spread the center table with her pa=
pers, fidgeted during at=20

which the sinking of their level has taken place. Wherever we examine the v=
alleys of rivers, or the=20

basins of lakes, we see the ancient shore at great distances. No doubt seem=
s now to be=20

entertained, that our rivers and lakes have undergone immense diminutions; =
but many geological=20

facts remind us also, that these great changes in the distribution of the w=
aters have preceded all=20

historical times; and that for many thousand years most lakes have attained=
 a permanent=20

equilibrium between the produce of the water flowing in, and that of evapor=
ation and filtration.=20

Whenever we find this equilibrium broken, it will be well rather to examine=
 whether the rupture be=20

not owing to causes merely local, and of very recent date, than to admit an=
 uninterrupted=20


_
Irene and Lorna, as sworn buddies, cemented yet more firmly the bond betwee=
n them, and=20

supported one another on every possible occasion. Irene was really growing =
fond of Lorna.=20

Though the latter might be reserved it was something to find a ready listen=
er and sympathizer. As=20

a rule we can't deliberately choose our soul-friends. Fate just seems to se=
nd them along and we=20

must accept them with all their faults or go without. It certainly does not=
 do to be too particular, or=20

we may soon find ourselves chumless in the world. Irene was rather lovelorn=
 for Peachy, but that=20

bright little American, besides being in an upper dormitory, was before-app=
ropriated by other=20

"heart-to-hearties," and, though she held out the palm of good fellowship, =
was too staunch a=20

character to desert old friends for new.  "She's just sweet to me, but I do=
n't count first," decided=20

Irene. "Well, it's no is conformable to the more circumspect method of mode=
rn science. At a time=20

when the physical history of the world, traced by the genius of some eloque=
nt writers, borrowed all=20

its charms from the fictions of imagination, the phenomenon of which we are=
 treating would have=20

been adduced as a new proof of the contrast these writers sought to establi=
sh between the two=20

continents. To demonstrate that America rose later than Asia and Europe fro=
m the bosom of the=20

waters, the lake of Tacarigua would have been described as one of those int=
erior basins which=20

have not yet become dry by the effects of slow and gradual evaporation. I h=
ave no doubt that, in=20

very remote times, the whole valley, from the foot of the mountains of Cocu=
yza to those of Torito=20

and Nirgua, and from La Sierra de Mariara to the chain of Guigue, of Guacim=
o, and La Palma, was=20

filled with water. Everywhere the form=20
