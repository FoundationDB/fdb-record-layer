that we are indebted to you for this intrusion?--for such we feel justified in calling it, under the 

existing circumstances."  "I did not intend to intrude, sir, nor do I now. In riding through the 

mountains we accidentally stumbled into the fissure passage that leads to this gulch, and as there 

was nothing to hinder us, we came on through."  "True; I should have posted a strong guard in the 

pass. You have a female companion, I perceive; not your wife?"  "Oh, no! nor my sister, either. 

This is Miss Terry--an estimable young lady, who has come to the Black Hills in search of her 

father. Your name is--"  "Redburn--Harry Redburn; and yours, I am told, is Fearless Frank."  "Yes, 

that is the title I sail under. But how do you know aught of me?"  "I was told your name by a 

partner of mine. Now, then, concerning the present matter; what do you propose to do?"  "To do? 

Why, turn back, I suppose; I see nothing else to do."  Redburn leaned on his rifle and considered. 

"Do you belong to that other crowd?"  "No, indeed;" Frank's face flushed, half angrily. "I thank my 

stars I am not quite so low down as that, yet. Do you know them? That's Deadwood Dick, the 

Prince of the Road, and his band of outlaws!"  "What--is it possible? The same gang whom the 

_Pioneer_ is making such a splurge over, every week."  "The same. That fellow clad in black is 

Deadwood Dick, the leader."  "Humph! He in others shirked, he assumed.  Where others lagged, 

he accelerated his pace.  Where others were indifferent to things around them, he observed and 

put away the results for possible use later.  He did not make of himself a pack-horse; what he 

undertook he did from interest in it, and that made it a pleasure to him when to others it was a 

burden.  He instinctively reasoned it out that an unpleasant task is never accomplished by 

stepping aside from it, but that, unerringly, it will return later to be met and done.  Obstacles, to 

Edward Bok, soon became merely difficulties to be overcome, and he trusted to his instinct to 

show him the best way to overcome them.  He soon learned that the hardest kind of work was 

back of every success; that nothing in the world of business just happened, but that everything 

was brought about, and only in one way--by a willingness of spirit and a determination to carry 

through.  He soon exploded for himself the misleading and comfortable theory of luck; the only 

lucky people, he found, were those who worked hard.  To them, luck came in the shape of what 

they had earned.  There were exceptions here and there, as there are to every rule; but the 

majority of these, he soon found, were more in the seeming than in the reality.  Generally 

speaking--and of course to this rule there are likewise exceptions, or as the Frenchman said, "All 

generalizations are false, including this one"--a man got in this world about what he worked for. 

And that became, for

"That is so. I had not thought of it before. But no significance is attached thereto."  "Perhaps not. 

Have you the least idea what brought them here?"  "The road-agents? I reckon I do. The military 

has been chasing them for the last two days. Probably they have come here for protection." 

"Maybe so; or for plunder. Give me your decision, and I will go and see what they want."  "There is

present writing) Bok was a pronounced baseball "fan," and there was, too, a baseball team among 

the Scribner young men of which he was a part.  This team played, each Saturday afternoon, a 

team from another publishing house, and for two seasons it was unbeatable.  Not only was this 

baseball aggregation close to the hearts of the

Redburn shook his head, decidedly.  "You cannot go back!" he said, using positiveness in his 

argument; "that is, not for awhile. You'd have all Deadwood down on us in a jiffy. I'll give you work 

in the shaft, at three dollars a day. You can accept that offer, or submit to confinement until I see fit 

to set you at liberty."  "And my companion, here--?"  "I will place under the charge of Miss Anita for 

the present, where she will receive hospitable treatment."  Fearless Frank started as though he 

had been struck a violent blow; his face grew very white; his eyes dilated; he trembled in every 

joint.  "_Anita!_" he gasped--"_Anita!_"  "I believe that is what I said!" Redburn could not 

understand the youth's agitation. He knew that the sister of Ned Harris had a secret; was this 

Fearless Frank in any way connected with it, and if so, how? "Do you know her?"  "Her other name 

is--"  member of the firm played on it and the senior member was a spectator. Frank N. Doubleday 

played on first base; William D. Moffat, later of Moffat, Yard & Company, and now editor of _The 

Mentor_, was behind the bat; Bok pitched; Ernest Dressel North, the present authority on rare 

editions of books, was in the field, as were also Ray Safford, now a director in the Scribner 

corporation, and Owen W. Brewer, at present a prominent figure in Chicago's book world.  It was a 

happy group, all closely banded together in their business interests and in their human relations as 

well.  With Scribner's Magazine now in the periodical field, Bok would be asked on his trips to the 

publishing houses to have an eye open for advertisements for that periodical as well.  Hence his 

education in the solicitation of advertisements became general, and gave him a sympathetic 

understanding of the problems of the

"I--I--I did, once!" was the slow reply. "Where is she; I want to see her?"  Redburn took a moment 

to consider.  Would it be best to permit a meeting between the two until he should be able to learn 

something more definite concerning the secret? If Ned Harris were here would he sanction such a 

meeting? No! something told the young miner that he would not; something warned him that it 

could result in no good to allow the scarlet youth an interview with sad, sweet-faced Anita.  "You 

cannot see her!" he at last said, decidedly. "There is a reason why you two should never meet 

again, and if which was to stand him in good stead when, in his later experience, he was called 

upon to view the business problems of a magazine from the editor's position.  His knowledge of 

the manufacture of the two magazines in his charge was likewise educative, as was the 

fascinating study of typography which always had, and has today, a wonderful attraction for him.  It 

was, however, in connection with the advertising of the general books of the house, and in his 

relations with their authors, that Bok found his greatest interest.  It was for him to find the best 

manner in which to introduce to the
