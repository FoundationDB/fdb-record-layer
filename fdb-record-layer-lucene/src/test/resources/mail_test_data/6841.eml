y than to _
right of kings out of Germany and the kaiser on to the Chautauqua circuit, =
reciting his wrongs and=20

his reminiscences!  Henry, you may remember, delivered the Roosevelt valedi=
ctory at the Chicago=20

Republican convention in 1912, when he kidded the standpat crowd out of eve=
ry Republican state=20

in the union but two at the election. Possibly you don't like that word kid=
. But it's in the dictionary,=20

and there's no other word to describe Henry's talent. He is always jamming =
the allegro into the=20

adagio. And that night in the encircling gloom on the boat as we started on=
 our martial adventures=20

he began kidding the ocean. His idea was that he would get Wichita to vote =
bonds for one that=20

would bring tide water to Main Street. He didn't want a big ocean--just a k=
ind of an oceanette with=20

a seating capacity of five thousand square miles was his idea, and when he =
had done with his=20

phantasie, the doleful dumps that rose at the psychical aroma of the hypoth=
etical fried chicken and=20

mashed potatoes of our dream, had vanished.  And so we fell to talking abou=
t our towns. It seems=20

that we had each had the same experience. Henry declared that, from the day=
 it was known he=20

was going to Europe for the Red Cross, the town had set him apart; he was s=
omewhat like the=20

doomed man in a hanging and people were always treating him with distinguis=
hed consideration.=20

He had a notion that Henry Lassen, the town boomer, had the memorial servic=
es all worked out--

who would sing "How Sleep the Brave," who would play Chopin's funeral march=
 on the pipe organ,=20

who would deliver the eulogy and just what leading advertiser they would se=
nd around to the=20

Eagle, his hated contemporary, to get the Murdocks to print the eulogy in f=
ull and on the first page!=20

Henry employs an alliterative head writer on the Beacon, and we wondered wh=
ether he had=20

decided to use "Wichita Weeps," or "State Stands Sorrowing." If he used the=
 latter, it would make=20

two lines and that would require a deck head. We could not decide, so we be=
gan talking of serious=20

things.  How quickly time has rolled the film since those early autumn days=
 when the man who=20

went to France was a hero in his town's eyes. Processions and parades and p=
ageants=20

interminable have passed down America's main streets, all headed for France=
. And what proud=20

pageants they were! Walking at the head of the line were the little limping=
 handful of veterans of=20

the Civil War. After them came the middle-aged huskies of the Spanish War, =
and then, so very=20

young, so boyish and so very solemn, came the soldiers for the great war--t=
he properties of plants.=20

If our Alfonsia oleifera belong to the genus Elais (as Brown, with great re=
ason believes), it follows,=20

that in the same genus the oil is found in the sarcocarp and in the perispe=
rm.) What the coniferae=20

are to the temperate zone, the terebinthaceae and the guttiferae are to the=
 torrid. In the forests of=20

those burning climates, (where there is neither pine, thuya, taxodium, nor =
even a podocarpus,)=20

resins, balsams, and aromatic gums, are furnished by the maronobea, the ici=
ca, and the amyris.=20

The collecting of these gummy and resinous substances is a trade in the vil=
lage of Javita. The=20

most celebrated resin bears the name of mani; and of this we saw masses of =
several hundred-

weight, resembling colophony and mastic. The tree called mani by the Paragi=
nis, which M.=20

Bonpland believes to be the Moronobaea coccinea, furnishes but a small quan=
tity of the substance=20

employed in the trade with Angostura. The greatest part comes from the mara=
ro or caragna, which=20

is an amyris. It is remarkable enough, that the name mani, which Aublet hea=
rd among the Galibis*=20

of Cayenne, was again heard by us at Javita, three hundred leagues distant =
from French Guiana.=20

(* The Galibis or Caribis (the r has been changed into l, as often happens)=
 are of the great stock of=20

the Carib nations. The products useful in commerce and in domestic life hav=
e received the same=20

denomination in every part of America which this warlike and commercial peo=
ple have overrun.)=20



The moronobaea or symphonia of Javita yields a yellow resin; the caragna, a=
 resin strongly=20

odoriferous, and white as snow; the latter becomes yellow where it is adher=
ent to the internal part=20

of old bark.  We went every day to see how our canoe advanced on the portag=
es. Twenty-three=20

Indians were employed in dragging it by land, placing branches of trees to =
serve as rollers. In this=20

manner a small boat proceeds in a day or a day and a half, from the waters =
of the Tuamini to=20

those of the Cano Pimichin, which flow into the Rio Negro. Our canoe being =
very large, and having=20

to pass the cataracts a second time, it was necessary to avoid with particu=
lar care any friction on=20

the bottom; consequently the passage occupied more than four days. It is on=
ly since 1795 that a=20

road has been traced through the forest. By substituting a canal for this p=
ortage, as I proposed to=20

the ministry of king Charles IV, the communication between the Rio Negro an=
d Angostura,=20

between the Spanish Orinoco and the Portuguese possessions on the Amazon, w=
ould be=20

singularly facilitated.  In this forest we at=20


_
volunteers, the National Guard, the soldiers of the new army; half accoutre=
d, clad in nondescript=20

uniforms, but proud and incorrigibly young. There had been banquets the wee=
k before, and=20

speeches and flag rituals in public, but the night before, there had been t=
ears and good-byes=20

across the land. And all this in a few weeks; indeed it began during the lo=
ng days in which we two=20

sailed through the gulf stream, we two whose departure from our towns had s=
eemed such a bold=20

and hazardous adventure. When one man leaves a town upon an unusual enterpr=
ise, it may look=20

foolhardy; but when a hundred leave upon the same adventure, it seems commo=
nplace. The=20

danger in some way seems to be divided by the numbers. Yet in truth, number=
s often multiply the=20

danger. There was little danger for Henry and me on the good ship Espagne w=
ith Red Cross=20

stenographers and nurses and ambulance drivers and Y. M. C. A. workers. No =
particular=20

advantage would come to the German arms by torpedoing us. But as the Espagn=
e, carrying her=20

peaceful passengers, all hurrying to Europe on merciful errands, passed dow=
n the river and into=20

the harbour that the pretended fossil caoutchouc, called dapicho by the Ind=
ians. The old chief=20

Javita led us to the brink of a rivulet which runs into the Tuamini; and sh=
owed us that, after digging=20

two or three feet deep, in a marshy soil, this substance was found between =
the roots of two trees=20

known by the name of the jacio and the curvana. The first is the hevea of A=
ublet, or siphonia of the=20

modern botanists, known to furnish the caoutchouc of commerce in Cayenne an=
d Grand Para; the=20

second has pinnate leaves, and its juice is milky, but very thin, and almos=
t destitute of viscosity.=20

The dapicho appears to be the result of an extravasation of the sap from th=
e roots. This=20

extravasation takes place more especially when the trees have attained a gr=
eat age, and the=20

interior of the trunk begins to decay. The bark and alburnum crack; and thu=
s is effected naturally,=20

what the art of man performs for the purpose of collecting the milky juices=
 of the hevea, the=20

castilloa, and the caoutchouc fig-tree. Aublet relates, that the Galibis an=
d the Garipons of Cayenne=20

begin by making a deep incision at the foot of the trunk, so as to penetrat=
e into=20


_
we had seen a great grey German monster passenger boat, an interned leviath=
an of the sea in her=20

dock. We had been told of how cunningly the Germans had scuttled her; how t=
hey had carefully=20

relaid electric wires so that every strand had to be retraced to and from i=
ts source, how they had=20

turned the course of water pipes, all over the ship, how they had drawn bol=
ts and with blow-pipes=20

had rotted nuts and rods far in the dark places of the ship's interior, how=
 they had scientifically=20

disarranged her boilers so that they would not make steam, and as we saw th=
e German boat=20

looming up, deck upon deck, a floating citadel, with her bristling guns, we=
 thought what a prize she=20

would be when she put out to sea loaded to the guards with those handsome b=
oys whom we had=20

been seeing hustling about the country as they went to their training camps=
. Even to consider=20

these things gave us a feeling of panic, and the recollection of the big bo=
at in the dock began to=20

bring the war to us, more vividly than it had come before. And they join wi=
th this horizontal notch=20

others both perpendicular and oblique, reaching from the top of the trunk n=
early to the roots. All=20

these incisions conduct the milky juice towards one point, where the vase o=
f clay is placed, in=20

which the caoutchouc is to be deposited. We saw the Indians of Carichana op=
erate nearly in the=20

same manner.  If, as I suppose, the accumulation and overflowing of the mil=
k in the jacio and the=20

curvana be a pathological phenomenon, it must sometimes take place at the e=
xtremity of the=20

longest roots, for we found masses of dapicho two feet in diameter and four=
 inches thick, eight feet=20

distant from the trunks. Sometimes the Indians dig in vain at the foot of d=
ead trees; at other times=20

the dapicho is found beneath the hevea or jacio still green. The substance =
is white, corky, fragile,=20

and resembles by its laminated structure and undulating edge, the Boletus i=
gnarius. The dapicho=20

perhaps takes a long time to form; it is probably a juice thickened by a pa=
rticular disposition of the=20


_
thus:  As we leaned over the rail that first night talking of many things, =
in the blackness, without a=20

glimmer from any porthole, with the decks as dark as Egypt, the ship shot a=
head at twenty knots=20

an hour. In peace times it would be regarded as a crazy man's deed, to go w=
hizzing along at full=20

speed without lights. Henry had taken two long puffs on his cigar when out =
from the murk behind=20

us came a hand that tapped his shoulder, and then a voice spoke:  "You'll h=
ave to put out that=20

cigar, sir. A submarine could see that five miles on a night like this!"  S=
o Henry doused his light,=20

and the war came right home to us.  The next day was uniform day on the boa=
t, and the war came=20

a bit nearer to us than ever. Scores of good people who had come on the boa=
t in civilian clothes,=20

donned their uniforms that second day; mostly Red Cross or Y. M. C. A. or A=
merican ambulance=20

or Field Service uniforms. We did not don our uniforms, though Henry from t=
he contact of light; it is=20

caoutchouc in a particular state, I may almost say an etiolated caoutchouc.=
 The humidity of the soil=20

seems to account for the undulating form of the edges of the dapicho, and i=
ts division into layers.  I=20

often observed in Peru, that on pouring slowly the milky juice of the hevea=
, or the sap of the=20

carica, into a large quantity of water, the coagulum forms undulating outli=
nes. The dapicho is=20

certainly not peculiar to the forest that extends from Javita to Pimichin, =
although that is the only=20

spot where it has hitherto been found. I have no doubt, that on digging in =
French Guiana beneath=20

the roots and the old trunks of the hevea, those enormous masses of corky c=
aoutchouc,* which I=20

have just described, would from time to time be found. (* Thus, at five or =
six inches depth,=20

between the roots of the Hymenea courbaril, masses of the resin anime (erro=
neously called copal)=20

are discovered, and are sometimes=20


_
we should at least have a dress rehearsal. The only regular uniforms on boa=
rd were worn by a=20

little handful of French soldiers, straggling home from a French political =
mission to America, and=20

these French soldiers were the only passengers on the boat who had errands =
to France seems to=20

throw some light on the origin of those large masses of amber which are pic=
ked up from time to=20

time on the coast of Prussia.) As it is observed in Europe, that at the fal=
l of the leaf the sap is=20

conveyed towards the root, it would be curious to examine whether, within=
