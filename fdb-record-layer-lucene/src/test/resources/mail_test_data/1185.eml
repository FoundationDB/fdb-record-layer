or the primitive Wisdom-Religion, as Buddha from a different point of view =
had before based His--

finds itself in the middle-ground between the too exuberantly veiled metaph=
ysics of the orthodox=20

Brahmans and those of Gautama, which, stripped in their exoteric garb of ev=
ery soul-vivifying=20

hope, transcendental aspiration and symbol, appear in their cold wisdom lik=
e crystalline icicles, the=20

skeletons of the primeval truths of Esoteric Philosophy.  Was Shankarachary=
a Gautama the=20

Buddha, then, under a new personal form? It may perhaps only puzzle the rea=
der the more if he=20

be told that there was the "astral" Gautama inside the outward Shankara, wh=
ose higher principle,=20

or Atman, was, nevertheless, his own divine prototype--the "Son of Light," =
indeed--the heavenly,=20

mind-born son of Aditi.  This fact is again based on that mysterious transf=
erence of the divine ex-=20

personality merged in the impersonal Individuality--now in its full trinita=
rian form of the Monad as=20

Atma-Buddhi-Manas--to a new body, whether visible or subjective. In the fir=
st case it is a=20

Manushya-Buddha; in the second it is a Nirmanakaya. The Buddha is in Nirvan=
a, it is said, though=20

this once mortal vehicle--the subtle body--of Gautama is still present amon=
g the Initiates; nor will it=20

leave the realm of conscious Being so long as suffering mankind needs its d=
ivine help--not to the=20

end of this Root Race, at any rate. From time to time He, the "astral" Gaut=
ama, associates=20

Himself, in some most mysterious--to us quite incomprehensible--manner, wit=
h Avataras and great=20

saints, and works through them. And several such are named.  Thus it is ave=
rred that Gautama=20

Buddha was reincarnated in Shankaracharya--that, as is said in _Esoteric Bu=
ddhism_:=20

Shankaracharya simply _was_ Buddha in all respects in a new     body.(664) =
  While the=20

expression in its mystic sense is true, the way of putting it may be mislea=
ding until explained.=20

Shankara was a Buddha, most assuredly, but he never was a reincarnation of =
the Buddha, though=20

Gautama's "Astral" Ego--or rather his Bodhisattva--may have been associated=
 in some mysterious=20

way with Shankaracharya. Yes, it was perhaps the Ego, Gautama, under a new =
and better=20

adapted casket--that of a Brahman of Southern India. But the Atman, the Hig=
her Self that=20

overshadowed both, was distinct from the Higher Self of the translated Budd=
ha, which was now in=20

Its own sphere in Kosmos.  Shankara was an Avatara in the full sense of the=
 term. According to=20

Sayanacharya, the great commentator on the _Vedas_, he is to be held as an =
Avatara, or direct=20

incarnation of Shiva--the Logos, the Seventh Principle in Nature--Himself. =
In the Secret Doctrine=20

Shri Shankaracharya is regarded as the abode--for the thirty-two years of h=
is mortal life--of a=20

Flame, the highest of the manifested Spiritual Beings, one of the Primordia=
l Seven Rays.  And now=20

what is meant by a "Bodhisattva"? Buddhists of the Mahayana mystic system t=
each that each=20

BUDDHA manifests Himself (hypostatically or otherwise) simultaneously in th=
ree worlds of Being,=20

namely, in the world of Kama (concupiscence or desire--the sensuous univers=
e or our earth) in the=20

shape of a man; in the world of Rupa (form, yet supersensuous) as a Bodhisa=
ttva; and in the=20

highest Spiritual World (that of purely incorporeal existences) as a Dhyani=
-Buddha. The latter=20

prevails eternally in space and time, _i.e._, from one Maha-Kalpa to the ot=
her--the synthetic=20

culmination of the three being Adi-Buddha,(665) the Wisdom-Principle, which=
 is Absolute, and=20

therefore out of space and time. Their inter- relation is the following: Th=
e Dhyani-Buddha, when=20

the world needs a human Buddha, "creates" through the power of Dhyana (medi=
tation, omnipotent=20

devotion), a mind-born son--a Bodhisattva--whose mission it is after the ph=
ysical death of his=20

human, or Manushya-Buddha, to continue his work on earth till the appearanc=
e of the subsequent=20



Buddha. The Esoteric meaning of this teaching is clear. In the case of a si=
mple mortal, the=20

principles in him are only the more or less bright reflections of the seven=
 cosmic, and the seven=20

celestial Principles, the Hierarchy of supersensual Beings. In the case of =
a Buddha, they are=20

almost the principles _in esse_ themselves. The Bodhisattva replaces in him=
 the Karana Sharira,=20

the Ego principle, and the rest correspondingly; and it is in this way that=
 Esoteric Philosophy=20

explains the meaning of the sentence that "by virtue of Dhyana [or abstract=
 meditation] the=20

Dhyani-Buddha [the Buddha's Spirit or Monad] creates a Bodhisattva," or the=
 astrally clothed Ego=20

within the Manushya-Buddha. Thus, while the Buddha merges back into Nirvana=
 whence it=20

proceeded, the Bodhisattva remains behind to continue the Buddha's work upo=
n earth. It is then=20

this Bodhisattva that may have afforded the lower principles in the apparit=
ional body of=20

Shankaracharya, the Avatara.  Now to say that Buddha, after having reached =
Nirvana, returned=20

thence to reincarnate in a new body, would be uttering a heresy from the Br=
ahmanical, as well as=20

from the Buddhistic standpoint. Even in the Mahayana exoteric School in the=
 teaching as to the=20

three "Buddhic" bodies,(666) it is said of the Dharmakaya--the ideal formle=
ss Being--that once it is=20

taken, the Buddha in it abandons the world of sensuous perceptions for ever=
, and has not, nor can=20

he have, any more connection with it. To say, as the Esoteric or Mystic Sch=
ool teaches, that=20

though Buddha is in Nirvana he has left behind him the Nirmanakaya (the Bod=
hisattva) to work=20

after him, is quite orthodox and in accordance with both the Esoteric Mahay=
ana and the Prasanga=20

Madhyamika Schools, the latter an anti-esoteric and most rationalistic syst=
em. For in the _Kala=20

Chakra_ Commentary it is shown that there is: (1) Adi-Buddha, eternal and c=
onditionless; then (2)=20

come Sambhogakaya-Buddhas, or Dhyani-Buddhas, existing from (aeonic) eterni=
ty and never=20

disappearing--the _Causal_ Buddhas so to say; and (3) the Manushya-Bodhisat=
tvas. The relation=20

between them is determined by the definition given. Adi-Buddha is Vajradhar=
a, and the Dhyani-

Buddhas are Vajrasattva; yet though these two are different Beings on their=
 respective planes,=20

They are identical in fact, one acting through the other, as a Dhyani throu=
gh a human Buddha.=20

One is "Endless Intelligence;" the other only "Supreme Intelligence." It is=
 said of Phra Bodhisattva-

-who was subsequently on earth Buddha Gautama:       Having fulfilled all t=
he conditions for the=20

immediate attainment     of perfect Buddhaship, the Holy One preferred, fro=
m unlimited     charity=20

towards living beings, _once more_ to reincarnate for the     benefit of ma=
n.   The Nirvana of the=20

Buddhists is only the threshold of Paranirvana, according to the Esoteric T=
eaching: while with the=20

Brahmans, it is the _summum bonum_, that final state from which there is no=
 more return--not till=20

the next Maha-Kalpa, at all events. And even this last view will be opposed=
 by some too orthodox=20

and dogmatic Philosophers who will not accept the Esoteric Doctrine. With t=
hem Nirvana is=20

absolute nothingness, in which there is nothing and no one: only an uncondi=
tioned All. To=20

understand the full characteristics of that Abstract Principle one must sen=
se it intuitionally and=20

comprehend fully the "one permanent condition in the Universe," which the H=
indus define so truly=20

as       The state of perfect unconsciousness--bare Chidakasham (field of  =
   consciousness) in=20

fact,   however paradoxical it may seem to the profane reader.(667)  Shanka=
racharya was reputed=20

to be an Avatara, an assertion the writer implicitly believes in, but which=
 other people are, of=20

course, at liberty to reject. And as such he took the body of a southern In=
dian, newly-born=20

Brahman baby; that body, for reasons as important as they are mysterious to=
 us, is said to have=20

been animated by Gautama's astral personal remains. This divine Non-Ego cho=
se as its own=20



Upadhi (physical basis), the ethereal, human Ego of a great Sage in this wo=
rld of forms, as the=20

fittest vehicle for Spirit to descend into.  Said Shankaracharya:       Par=
abrahman is Karta=20

[Purusha], as there is no other     Adhishtatha,(668) and Parabrahman is Pr=
akriti, there being no=20

other substance.(669)   Now what is true of the Macrocosmical from the shor=
e; there he bore the=20

fainting man, and laying him down upon the grass, unfastened the buttons of=
 his collar and=20

unhooked his doublet. A moment later the gray-headed man was beside him. Ol=
ivain managed in=20

his turn to land, after crossing himself repeatedly; and the people in the =
ferryboat guided=20

themselves as well as they were able toward the bank, with the aid of a pol=
e which chanced to be=20

in the boat.  Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied=
 the young=20

gentleman, the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man=
, who opened his=20

eyes, at first entirely bewildered, but who soon fixed his gaze upon the pe=
rson who had saved him.=20

"Ah, sir," he exclaimed, "it was you! Without you I was a dead man--thrice =
dead."  "But one=20

recovers, sir, as you perceive," replied Raoul, "and we have but had a litt=
le bath."  "Oh! sir, what=20

gratitude I feel!" exclaimed the man with gray hair.  "Ah, there you are, m=
y good D'Arminges; I=20

have given you a great fright, have I not? but it is your own fault. You we=
re my tutor, why did you=20

not teach me to swim?"  "Oh, monsieur le comte," replied the old man, "had =
any misfortune=20

happened to you, I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal ag=
ain."  "But how did=20

the accident happen?" asked Raoul.  "Oh, sir, in the most natural way possi=
ble," replied he to=20

whom they had given the title of count. "We were about a third of the way a=
cross the river when=20

the cord of the ferryboat broke. Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the b=
oatmen, my horse=20

sprang into the water. I cannot swim, and dared not throw myself into the r=
iver. Instead of aiding=20

the movements of my horse, I paralyzed them; and I was just going to drown =
myself with the best=20

grace in the world, when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the wat=
er; therefore, sir, if you=20

will agree, henceforward we are friends until death."  "Sir," replied Raoul=
, bowing, "I am entirely at=20

your service, I assure you."  "I am called the Count de Guiche," continued =
the young man; "my=20

father is the Marechal de Grammont; and now that you know who I am, do me t=
he honor to inform=20

me who you are."  "I am the Viscount de Bragelonne," answered Raoul, blushi=
ng at being unable=20

to name his father, as the Count de Guiche had done.  "Viscount, your count=
enance, your=20

goodness and your courage incline me toward you; my gratitude is already du=
e. Shake hands--I=20

crave your friendship."  "Sir," said Raoul, returning the count's pressure =
of the hand, "I like you=20

already, from my heart; pray regard me as a devoted friend, I beseech you."=
  "And now, where are=20

you going, viscount?" inquired De Guiche.  "To join the army, under the pri=
nce, count."  "And I,=20

too!" exclaimed the young man, in a transport of joy. "Oh, so much the bett=
er, we will fire the first=20

shot together."  "It is well; be friends," said the tutor; "young as you bo=
th are, you were perhaps=20

born under the same star and were destined to meet. And now," continued he,=
 "you must change=20

your clothes; your servants, to whom I gave directions the moment they had =
left the ferryboat,=20

ought to be already at the inn. Linen and wine are both being warmed; come.=
"  The young men=20

had no objection to this proposition; on the contrary, they thought it very=
 timely.  They mounted=20

again at once, whilst looks of admiration passed between them. They were in=
deed two elegant=20

horsemen, with figures slight and upright, noble faces, bright and proud lo=
oks, loyal and intelligent=20

smiles.  De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age, but he was =
scarcely taller than=20

Raoul, who was only fifteen.     30. Skirmishing.   The halt at Noyon was b=
ut brief, every one there=20



being wrapped in profound sleep. Raoul had desired to be awakened should Gr=
imaud arrive, but=20

Grimaud did not arrive. Doubtless, too, the horses on their part appreciate=
d the eight hours of=20

repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them. The Count de Guich=
e was awakened=20

at five o'clock in the morning by Raoul, who came to wish him good-day. The=
y breakfasted in=20

haste, and at six o'clock had already gone ten miles.  The young count's co=
nversation was most=20

interesting to Raoul, therefore he listened much, whilst the count talked w=
ell and long. Brought up=20

in Paris, where Raoul had been but once; at the court, which Raoul had neve=
r seen; his follies as=20

page; two duels, which he had already found the means of fighting, in spite=
 of the edicts against=20

them and, more especially, in spite of his tutor's vigilance--these things =
excited the greatest=20

curiosity in Raoul. Raoul had only been at M. Scarron's house; he named to =
Guiche the people=20

whom he had seen there. Guiche knew everybody--Madame de Neuillan, Mademois=
elle=20

d'Aubigne, Mademoiselle de Scudery, Mademoiselle Paulet, Madame de Chevreus=
e. He criticised=20

everybody humorously. Raoul trembled, lest he should laugh among the rest a=
t Madame de=20

Chevreuse, for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy, but either in=
stinctively, or from=20

affection for the duchess, he said everything in her favor. His praises inc=
reased Raoul's friendship=20

twofold. Then came the question of gallantry and love affairs. Under this h=
ead, also, Bragelonne=20

had much more to hear than to tell. He listened attentively and fancied tha=
t he discovered through=20

three or four rather frivolous adventures, that the count, like himself, ha=
d a secret to hide in the=20

depths of his heart.  De Guiche, as we have said before, had been educated =
at the court, and the=20

intrigues of this court were not unknown to him. It was the same court of w=
hich Raoul had so often=20

heard the Comte de la Fere speak, except that its aspect had much changed s=
ince the period=20

when Athos had himself been part of it; therefore everything which the Coun=
t de Guiche related=20

was new to his traveling companion. The young count, witty and caustic, pas=
sed all the world in=20

review; the queen herself was not spared, and Cardinal Mazarin came in for =
his share of ridicule.=20

The day passed away as rapidly as an hour. The count's tutor, a man of the =
world and a bon=20

vivant, up to his eyes in learning, as his pupil described him, often recal=
led the profound erudition,=20

the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul; but as regarded grace, deli=
cacy, and nobility of=20

external appearance, no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte=
 de la Fere.  The=20

horses, which were more kindly used than on the previous day, stopped at Ar=
ras at four o'clock in=20

the evening. They were approaching the scene of war; and as bands of Spania=
rds sometimes took=20

advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood =
of Arras, they=20

determined to remain in the town until the morrow. The French army held all=
 between Pont-a-Marc=20

as far as Valenciennes, falling back upon Douai. The prince was said to be =
in person at Bethune.=20

The enemy's army extended from Cassel to Courtray; and as there was no spec=
ies of violence or=20

pillage it did not commit, the poor people on the frontier quitted their is=
olated dwellings and fled for=20

refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them. Arras was e=
ncumbered with fugitives.=20

An approaching battle was much spoken of, the prince having manoeuvred, unt=
il that movement,=20

only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him.  The youn=
g men congratulated=20

themselves on having arrived so opportunely. The evening was employed in di=
scussing the war;=20

the grooms polished their arms; the young men loaded the pistols in case of=
 a skirmish, and they=20

awoke in despair, having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to par=
ticipate in the battle. In=20

the morning it was rumored that Prince de Conde had evacuated Bethune and f=
allen back on=20



Carvin, leaving, however, a strong garrison in the former city.  But as the=
re was nothing positively=20

certain in this report, the young warriors decided to continue their way to=
ward Bethune, free on the=20

road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary.  The count's=
 tutor was well=20

acquainted with the country; he consequently proposed to take a crossroad, =
which lay between=20

that of Lens and that of Bethune. They obtained information at Ablain, and =
a statement of their=20

route was left for Grimaud. About seven o'clock in the morning they set out=
. De Guiche, who was=20

young and impulsive, said to Raoul, "Here we are, three masters and three=
=20


_
plane. It is therefore nearer the truth to say--when once we accept such a =
possibility--that the=20

"astral" Gautama, or the Nirmanakaya, was the Upadhi of Shankaracharya's sp=
irit, rather than that=20

the latter was a reincarnation of the former.  When a Shankaracharya has to=
 be born, naturally=20

every one of the principles in the manifested mortal man must be the purest=
 and finest that exist=20

on earth. Consequently those principles that were once attached to Gautama,=
 who was the direct=20

great predecessor of Shankara, were naturally attracted to him, the economy=
 of Nature forbidding=20

the re-evolution of similar principles from the crude state. But it must be=
 remembered that the=20

higher ethereal principles are not, like the lower more material ones, visi=
ble sometimes to man (as=20

astral bodies), and they have to be regarded in the light of separate or in=
dependent Powers or=20

Gods, rather than as material objects. Hence the right way of representing =
the truth would be to=20

say that the various principles, the Bodhisattva, of Gautama Buddha, which =
did not go to Nirvana,=20

re-united to form the middle principles of Shankaracharya, the earthly Enti=
ty.(670)  It is yours=20

seems to be tough enough."  "I have never seen him put to the test," replie=
d Raoul, "but he is a=20

Breton, which promises something."  "Yes, yes," resumed De Guiche; "I am su=
re he can fire a=20

musket when required. On my side I have two sure men, who have been in acti=
on with my father.=20

We therefore represent six fighting men; if we should meet a little troop o=
f enemies, equal or even=20

superior in number to our own, shall we charge them, Raoul?"  "Certainly, s=
ir," replied the=20

viscount.  "Holloa! young people--stop there!" said the tutor, joining in t=
he conversation. "Zounds!=20

how you manoeuvre my instructions, count! You seem to forget the orders I r=
eceived to conduct=20

you safe and sound to his highness the prince! Once with the army you may b=
e killed at your good=20

pleasure; but until that time, I warn you that in my capacity of general of=
 the army I shall order a=20

retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across." De Guiche a=
nd Raoul glanced at=20

each other, smiling.  They arrived at Ablain without accident. There they i=
nquired and learned that=20

the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cam=
bria and La Venthie.=20


_
esoterically and understand the subtle differences between the various plan=
es of existence to be=20

able to comprehend correctly the above. Put more clearly, Gautama, the huma=
n Buddha, who=20

had, exoterically, Amitabha for his Bodhisattva and Avalokiteshvara for his=
 Dhyani-Buddha--the=20

triad emanating directly from Adi-Buddha--assimilated these by his "Dhyana"=
 (meditation) and thus=20

become a Buddha ("enlightened"). In another manner this is the case with al=
l men; everyone of us=20

has his Bodhisattva--the middle principle, if we hold for a moment to the t=
rinitarian division of the=20

septenary group--and his Dhyani-Buddha, or Chohan, the "Father of the Son."=
 Our connecting link=20

with the higher Hierarchy of Celestial Beings lies here in a nutshell, only=
 we are too sinful to=20

assimilate them.  Six centuries after the translation of the human Buddha (=
Gautama) another=20

Reformer, as noble and as loving, though less place for Grimaud, they took =
a crossroad which=20

conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the L=
ys. The country was=20

beautiful, intersected by valleys as green as the emerald. Here and there t=
hey passed little copses=20

crossing the path which they were following. In anticipation of some ambusc=
ade in each of these=20

little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band, thu=
s forming the advance=20

guard. Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army, whil=
st Olivain, with his=20

rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch, protected the rear.  They =
had observed for some=20

time before them, on the horizon, a rather thick wood; and when they had ar=
rived at a distance of=20

a hundred steps from it, Monsieur d'Arminges took his usual precautions and=
 sent on in advance=20

the count's two grooms. The servants had just disappeared under the trees, =
followed by the=20
