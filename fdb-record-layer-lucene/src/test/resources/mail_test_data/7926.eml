Bynes rented 14 acres of land from Arthur Harven and began farming.  In 186=
8 he left South=20

Carolina and came to Florida. He settled in Enterprise (now Benson Springs)=
, Velusia County=20

where he worked for J.C. Hayes, a farmer, for one year, after which he home=
steaded. He next=20

became a carpenter and, as he says most of the smaller is too wet for grain=
 and good only for=20

pasture. The larger island is full of minerals and coal, of which the small=
er island is almost=20

destitute. These are the most salient features of the scene of English hist=
ory, and, with a=20

temperate climate, the chief physical determinants of English destiny.  Wha=

are the special attributes of an island? In the first place,=20

master of none." He married shortly after coming to Florida and is the fath=
er of three sons--"as my=20

wife told me," he adds with a twinkle in his eyes. His wife is now dead. He=
 was prevailed upon=20

while very ill to enter the Titusville Poor Farm where he has been for almo=
st two years. (2)   Della=20

Bess Hilyard ("Aunt Bess")  Della Bess Hilyard, or "Aunt Bess" as she is be=

race. Migration by land under the pressure of hunger or of a stronger tribe=
, or from the mere habit=20

of wandering, calls for no special effort of courage or intelligence on the=
 part of the nomad.=20

Migration by sea does: to go forth on a strange element at all, courage is =
required; but we can=20

hardly realize the amount of courage required to go voluntarily out of sigh=
t of land. The first=20

attempts at=20

Hart, slaves of Gus Hiwards. Both her parents were cotton pickers and as a =
little girl Della often=20

went with her parents into the fields. One day she stated that the Yankees =
came through South=20

Carolina with Knapsacks on their shoulders. It wasn't until later that she =
learned the reason.=20

When asked if she received any educational training, "Aunt Bess" replied in=
 the negative, but=20

stated that the slaves on the Hiwards plantation were permitted to pick up =
what education they=20

could without fear of being molested. No one bothered, however, to teach th=
em anything.  In=20

regards to religion, "Aunt Bess" said that the slaves were not told about h=
eaven; they were told to=20

honor their masters and mistresses and of the damnation which awaited them =
for disobedience.=20

After slavery the Hart family moved to Georgia where Della grew into womanh=
ood and at an early=20

age married Caleb Bess by whom she had two children. After the death of Bes=
s, about fifteen=20

years ago, "Aunt Bess" moved to Fort Pierce, Florida. While there she marri=
ed Lonny Hilyard who=20

brought her to Titusville where she now resides, a relic of bygone days. (3=

which make up the English nation, the Celtic had only to pass a channel whi=
ch you can see=20

across, which perhaps in the time of the earliest migration did not exist. =
But the Teutons, who are=20

the dominant race and have supplied the basis of the English character and =
institutions, had to=20

pass a wider sea. From Scandinavia, especially, England received, under the=
 form of freebooters,=20

who afterwards became conquerors and settlers, the very core and sinews of =
her maritime=20

population, the progenitors of the Blakes and Nelsons. The Northman, like t=
he Phoenician, had a=20

country too narrow for him, and timber for ship-building at hand. But the l=
and of the Phoenician=20

was a lovely land, which bound him to itself; and wherever he moved his hea=
rt still turned to the=20

pleasant abodes of Lebanon and the sunlit quays of Tyre. Thus he became a m=
erchant, and the=20

father of all who have made the estranging sea a highway and a bond between=
 nations, more than=20

atoning by the service thus rendered to humanity, for his craft, his treach=
