Priscilla Proctor, called Peachy for short. Oh, yes, I knew all about you beforehand, although you 

happen to be the newest girl. Dad wrote me a whole page--wonderful for him!--and said he'd 

stayed at your house in London, and I was to tack myself on to you and show you round, and see 

you didn't fret and all the rest of it. Are you wanting a crony, temporary or otherwise? Then here I 

am at your service. Link an arm and we'll parade the place. I guess by the time we've finished 

there's not much you won't know about the Villa Camellia."  "Have you been here long?" asked 

Irene, accepting the proffered arm with alacrity, and submitting to be led away by her cicerone. 

"Just a year. Cried myself to a puddle when I first came, but I like it now. I didn't realize who you 

were when you first arrived, or I'd have given you a tip or two straight away. Thank goodness 

you're fairly in favor with Rachel at any rate. Any one who starts by offending her has a bad term. I 

don't envy Mabel Hughes. That girl will get a few eye-openers before she's much older, and serve 

her right. She rooms with you? Well, I'm sorry for you. I wish there was a spare bed in our 

dormitory, but we're full up to overflowing. Now then, I've brought you out by the side door to show 

you what we consider the best view of the garden. Ah, I thought it would make your eyes pop out! 

It's _some_ view, isn't it?"  The garden of the Villa Camellia was certainly one of the greatest 

assets of the school, and to Irene, who had been transported straight from the desolation of a 

London suburb in January, it seemed like a vision of a different world. The long terrace, with its 

marble balustrade, edged a high cliff that overtopped the sea, while at present the setting sun was 

lighting up the white houses of the distant outline of Naples, and was touching the purple slopes of 

Vesuvius with gold. Pillars and archways formed a pergola, from which hung roses and festoons of 

the trumpetflower; from the groves near at hand came the sweet strong scent of orange blossoms, 

and the little favorites of an English spring, forget-me-nots, pink daisies, and pansies, lifted 

contented heads from the border below. In the basin of the great marble fountain white arum lilies 

were blooming, geraniums trailed from tall vases, and palms, bamboos, and other exotics backed 

the row of lemon trees at the end of the paved walk. Here and there marble benches were 

arranged round tables in specially constructed arbors.  "These are our summer classrooms," 

explained Peachy. "When it's blazingly hot we do lessons here early in the mornings, and it's 

ripping. No, we don't use them at this time of the year, because the marble is cold to sit upon, and 

the garden is damp really, although it looks so jolly. You should see it in a sirocco wind! You 

wouldn't want to have classes outside then, you bet! It's luck you're in the Transition form. If you'd 

been one of Miss Rodger's elect eleven, or one of Miss Brewster's lambs, I'd have had to chum 

with you by stealth. I'd have managed it somehow, of course, to please Dad, but it isn't done here 

openly. School etiquette is like the law of the Medes and Persians. We keep to our own forms. 

Hello! There's Sheila Yonge. Sheila! If you can find any Camellia Buds that aren't playing tennis 

bring them along right here for a little powwow with Irene."  "Is she a 'buddy' yet?" whispered 

Sheila.  "Of course not! She's only been here a few hours. What a dear old silly you are. Hunt up 

some of that crew all the same, and I'm yours forever. Don't you understand the situation? Well, 

Irene's folks entertained Dad in London and were just lovely to him--nursed him when he was sick 

and took him round the shows when he got well. He's been bursting with gratitude ever since, and 

he wrote and told me Irene was coming here and I must pay her out--no, pay her back--pour coals 



of fire on her head--Great Scott, I'm getting my similes mixed! I mean give her a right down good 

time as far as I can, and make her think the Villa Camellia is a dandy place. Twiggez-vous, 

cherie?"  "I twig!" laughed Sheila. "I'll beat up all I can muster," and she ran lightly away along the 

terrace.  "A decent girl, though a little hard of comprehension," Peachy nodded after her. "Doesn't 

she look adorable in that blue tam-o'-shanter?"  "She's awfully pretty!" agreed Irene readily. 

"She'd be the beauty of the school if she'd any idea how to use her advantages," sighed Peachy. 

"Give me her complexion and that classical nose and--well, I guess I'd blaze out into a cinema star 

before I'd done with life. I hope she won't be all day raking a few girls together. She's not what 

you'd call quick. I've misjudged her. Here she comes with half a the results here are even more 

striking. The pot of jam, for instance, only falls down in, I think, .0025 per cent. of cases, the 

canary bursts into song in only .00175 per cent., and so on."  "It is astonishing," I admitted. "I must 

certainly obtain a copy of your book. Perhaps----"  "I never published it," he interrupted. "As a 

matter of fact I became converted."  "Converted?" I exclaimed in amazement. "In the face of all 

your statistics?"  "Yes," he said meditatively. "I remember the occasion well. It happened a few 

months ago, in early Spring. I had just completed the last chapter of my book, and I laid down my 

pen with a sigh. There before me lay all the statistics I had so laboriously collected, neatly 

tabulated and arranged with the proper explanatory notes and diagrams. It was finished after all 

these years! I can assure you it was an emotional moment. I don't know if you have ever brought a 

great work to a successful conclusion; if so, you can understand my feelings."  "I can imagine 

them," I said.  "Well, I opened the French windows and stepped out into the garden to calm 

myself. It was a lovely March day, I remember, sunny and fresh, and I paced up and down the 

garden till my emotions subsided and I gradually recovered my self-control. Then I went indoors 

again."  The train slowed down and he began to gather his things together. "While I was gone," he 

said sadly, "the wind blew my manuscript and the best part of my notes into the fire."  "How 

excessively unfortunate!" I murmured sympathetically. "And this converted you to the 'cussedness' 

theory?"  "Yes," said he, as he stepped down to the platform. "It was the only book I ever wrote, 

and it was burned practically to a cinder. It works out you see, at exactly 100 per cent...."         * 

*       *       *       *  THE EPIDEMIC.  (A French contemporary, commenting upon the fact that the 

sudden appearance of cold weather in London is accompanied by an equally sudden 

disappearance of cats, demonstrates the cause of this coincidence.)    What boots it, Sir, to boggle 

at     The truth? So be it said   Quite candidly, our Thomas-cat,     McCorquodale, is dead.    When 

winds from East and North conspire     To freeze the very breath,   To you it means the mere 

desire   To skate or sit too near the fire,     To him 'twas sudden death.    The cat that leaves the 

hearth and strays     Abroad is over-bold;   McCorquodale would go his ways,   Despite the frost. 

To use a phrase   Belittled in these careless days,     He caught his death of cold.    'Twas not from 

native lack of fur     That his demise was such.   We did not see the end occur,   But, though it be 

to cast a slur   Upon humanity, infer   (And you will catch our meaning, Sir)     He had a coat too 

much.         *       *       *       *       *    And now, when Northern winds are bluff     And veering to the 

East,   And Beauty shuns their rude rebuff   By hiding hands (and powder-puff)   Inside her 

Russian sable muff,   We tell ourselves, "Why, sure enough   There goes, disguised as better stuff,

Learned Clerks.)  Looking about among the very best _cliches_ (my own and others)--

"supersubtle analysis," "intimate psychology," "masterly handling," "incomparable artistry"--I found 

nothing that it didn't seem a sort of impertinence to apply to JOSEPH CONRAD's _Chance_, 

which METHUEN has just had the good luck to publish. For the whole thing is much nearer 

wizardry than workmanship. I put the book down with a gasp, so close had I been to realities as 

conjured up by one to whom realism is a servant and not a master. I had come to know, in that 

piecemeal way in which one actually gets to know one's fellows--waiting for later experience to 

confirm or modify earlier impressions--the hapless, tragic _Flora_; her father, _de Barral_, the 

pseudo-financier, fraudulent through unimaginative stupidity rather than criminal intent; the kindly-

cruel pair of _Fynes_; that perfect, chivalrous knight of the sea, _Captain Anthony_, _Flora's_ 

fiery-patient lover; his splendidly staunch second officer, _Powell_, and the analytic _Marlow_, 

also a sailor-man, who acts in the capacity of ultra-modern chorus to this tragedy of chance. The

brought candy? Well, you _are_ a sport! Let's squat under the mimosa tree and hand it round." 

The little group of Peachy's favorite friends who settled themselves under the yellow mimosa bush 

to suck taffy and watch the flaming sunset were all afterwards intimately bound up with Irene's 

school career. Each was such a distinct personality that she sorted them out fairly accurately on 

that first evening, and decided the particular order in which they would rank in her affections. 

There was Jess Cameron, issues can hang upon such trivial happenings, not merely in the outer 

realm of fact but on the inner stage of character. And, this being his theme, perhaps Mr. CONRAD 

ought to have been more scrupulously careful to use no such strained coincidence as _Powell's_ 

detection of _de Barral's_ attempt at revenge on his fancied enemy, _Anthony_. But this is indeed 

a slight defect in a work of brilliantly sustained imagination and superb craftsmanship. I wonder if 

the author's magic has so seduced my judgment 


_
when she spoke, and was a trifle matter-of-fact and practical, but was evidently the dependable 

anchor of the rest of the scatter-brained crew, the one who made the most sensible suggestions, 

and to whom--though they teased her a little and called her "Grannie"--they all turned in the end 

for help and advice. Jess was slightly out of her element in a southern setting. Her appropriate 

background was moorland and _Captain Anthony_ and _de Barral_ are deliberately suggested in 

fainter outline just because _Marlow_ has in fact not known them personally, but only through the 

reports of others. I am prepared to believe the author of _Typhoon_ subtle enough for that, or for 

anything else, and I have this only grudge against him, that he intrigued me to the point of 

feverishly "skipping," out of sheer excitement to know if and how

loch, and driving clouds and a breeze with fine mist in it, that would make you want to wrap a plaid 

round your shoulders and turn to the luxury of a peat fire. Quite unconsciously she suggested all 

these things. Peachy once described her as a living incarnation of one of Scott's novels, for she 

was steeped in old traditions and legends and superstitions, and could tell tales in the gloaming 

that sent eerie shivers down the spines of her listeners, or would recite ballads with a swing that 

took one back to the days of wandering minstrels. She was not a girl deplorable misunderstanding 

between _Flora_ and her quixotic _Captain Anthony_ was to be cleared up, just like any ordinary 

decent library-subscriber, instead of the case-hardened critical fellow I naturally take myself to be.

friend who has often persuaded me that this world is rather a place for smiles than for gloom; and 

the other is a new book of stories which have life in them, which make their effect with a seemingly 

artless certainty and
