pellerless jet-type plane several years ago. Long before that, automobiles =
were driven by rocket engines, and special rockets for making meteorologica=

long rest!"  The bird was an albatross, largest of all sea birds. Ted had l=
earned a great deal about=20

them from the old sailors, who called them gonies. They followed ships for =
thousands of miles,=20

sleeping on the sea, or soaring miles on end, with their long, narrow wings=
 spread wide.  This one,=20

beyond a doubt, had been following their task force, but had been frightene=
d away by the big=20

guns.  "What'll I do with you?" he demanded of the bird.  His answer was a =
snap on the ankle from=20

its powerful jaws.  "I should kill and eat you," he exclaimed. "You're wors=
e than a Jap! But I won't--

not yet. Men don't eat gonies unless they have to. It's supposed to bring b=
ad luck. I'll tie you up,=20

that's what I'll do. Then we'll try our luck together. If I'm rescued, you =
go free. If not, you get=20

eaten."  The gony winked as if he really understood. Then for good measure,=
 he nipped at Ted's=20

ankle once more.  "You'll be some company," Ted said, as after binding the =
bird's feet, he=20

fastened a wide strap taken from his parachute about its wings and body.  L=
ate in the afternoon he=20

caught a fairly large fish. After pressing water from its meat, he drank a =
little. "Not impossible," was=20

his verdict. He ate some of the meat, then offered a bite to his gony, who,=
 to his surprise,=20

swallowed it.  "You must be a young fellow," he said. "Friendly and green, =
like myself." He=20

laughed, and felt better.  Just as the sun was sinking in the west he saw a=
 dark smudge that soon=20

obscured the sun. "A ship!" He became greatly excited. Another smudge, and =
yet another. "The=20

task force!" he exclaimed, standing up and nearly overturning his raft. "If=
 only it would come this=20

way!"                                    CHAPTER XV                        =
     THE SECRET BOOK   On the island=20

of mysteries Jack watched with increasing astonishment as the jet plane soa=
red away. It climbed=20

up until it looked to be the size of a star, let out a scream, then faded w=
ith the speed of sound into=20

the blue sky.  "Some plane!" he exclaimed, straining his eyes for one last =
glimpse of it. A plane like=20

that could change the whole science of aviation. Yes, it's a military secre=
t, but whose secret?=20

That's the question. He was about to begin his homeward journey when a book=
, lying on the rocks,=20

caught his attention.  _Murder at Midnight_, he read on the cover. "So that=
's what they read!"=20

Picking up the book, he flipped it open, then a whistle escaped his lips. T=
wo thirds of the pages of=20

the original book had been replaced by pages on which clippings had been pa=
sted. "A scrapbook!=20

How strange!" He stood staring at it.  A moment later he nearly dropped it =
in his excitement. "It's=20

all about that mysterious plane! What a find!" he whispered.  Sitting down =
upon a flat rock, he=20

began to read. There a bright and sharp line of demarcation, with redness o=
f adjacent surface, we=20

are justified in concluding that the burns were inflicted ante mortem or, a=
t farthest, within a few=20

moments of death. If, on the contrary, the red line is absent and the blist=
ers contain a thin watery=20

fluid, with a yellowish and dry condition of their base after removal of th=
e cuticle, the presumption=20

is that the burning occurred post mortem.  Where _a number of burns_ are fo=
und upon a body, the=20

question whether they were produced simultaneously may be raised. This can =
be answered by=20

examination as to their condition. If some show signs of recent infliction,=
 while others are in=20

conditions of suppuration or other changes which only occur after an interv=
al, a difference of time=20

in production would be probable. But if all present mainly the same conditi=
ons, the probability of=20

their occurring at the same time may be concluded (Plates I. and II.).  =3D=
The Condition of the=20

Blood.=3D=E2=80=94Special examination of the blood of persons dying from th=
e effect of burns has been=20

made by competent observers. While it is not at present possible to define =
an exact and constant=20

condition, specially characteristic, some features of interest have been re=
cently recorded.  The=20

color of the blood has been variously reported; in some cases as being of a=
 dark color and in=20



others of a bright arterial hue. Death by asphyxia or suffocation, by the d=
eprivation of oxygen, and=20

by the products of combustion, would be accompanied by a dark or venous hue=
 of the blood. An=20

atmosphere containing an excess of carbon monoxide, resulting from combusti=
on, would cause=20

death by apn=C5=93a with an arterial hue to the blood.[722] But other influ=
ences must be considered.=20

According to Schjerning,[723] it is difficult to deduce positive conclusion=
s from the condition of the=20

blood. The changes induced by the spleen and kidneys, as well as the varyin=
g intensity of the=20

degree of heat to which the body may be subjected, tend to render positive =
and constant=20

conclusions from this source difficult.  Falk[724] refers to the bright red=
 color of the blood found in=20

some cases, and explains this condition in part by the influence of chemica=
l changes in the tissues=20

surrounding the vessels.  Wertheim[725] describes certain conditions observ=
ed by him and=20

mentions an increase in the number of the leucocytes, together with the pre=
sence of h=C3=A6moglobin=20

and melanin.  Hoppe Seyler meets with similar results and arrives at the sa=
me conclusions in his=20

observations.  Ponfik,[726] on the contrary, is doubtful of the constant pr=
esence of some of these=20

conditions and also of their diagnostic value.  Seliger[727] confirms the c=
onclusions of Wertheim,=20

in that he describes the presence of crystalline bodies and of dark discolo=
rations=20


_
English, French, German, and Italian. Many he could not read at all, but th=
e articles in English=20

were more than enough to satisfy his curiosity. Much that he read about equ=
alizers, reflecting=20

blades, direpeller blades, slip streams, and burbles he understood only in =
part. At last he came to=20

an article which gave him the desired information. This article read in par=
t:  "Rocket propulsion, of=20

course, is not a new thing; the basic idea is centuries old. As applied to =
aerial warfare it was=20

employed on a crude basis even in World War I. The Italians made public an =
 Some spectroscopic=20

analyses have disclosed the presence of bands additional to those of normal=
 blood. The lack of=20

uniformity of conditions described and of conclusions reached leaves the su=
bject in a position of=20

uncertainty. Examination of the blood of those dying from burns has not bee=
n so extensively and=20

minutely followed as to enable us to decide questions which may arise in an=
y case.=20
