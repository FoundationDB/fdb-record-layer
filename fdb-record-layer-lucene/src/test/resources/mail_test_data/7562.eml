dracaena marginata occupied by the Minnesota Thresher Co., about eighteen years ago, there have been no conflagrations within the prison grounds.

electric lights so that the inmates can see to work during the winter months. As they are employed 

from seven in the morning until six in the evening the year around, lights are often necessitated. 

THE PRISON FIRE DEPARTMENT   It is not generally known, but, nevertheless, the prison 

maintains a well organized fire department. This brigade is not a large one, but as a first aid in 

case of necessity it is equipped to do efficient respect like it. These may be larded with Bacon 

upon the Breast, or else strew'd with Salt and Crumbs of Bread, while they are roasting. Besides 

the Sauce used for Woodcocks and Snipes, the aforesaid _Suffolk_ Gentleman has the following 

which is Gravey with a little minced Anchovy, a Rocambole, some Lemon-Juice, and a little White-

wine boiled together; and when it is strain'd, pour it in a Saucer, and serve it with the Fowls. 

These Birds are in plenty

There are eight prisoners on the day shift and the same on the night crew. The fire alarm system 

of the prison is as nearly perfect as human ingenuity can devise. There are two hose carts, and 

frequent experimental runs are made in order to keep the department to a high state of efficiency. 

At these runs the men go to the fire house, take out the hose carts and make as quick time as 

possible to the nearest hydrant where the supposed fire exists, the hose is attached and all 

preparations made as if a real fire were under way.  Occasionally a general night alarm is sent in, 

and when this occurs all the guards residing at the prison must respond promptly. The warden and 

deputy warden also respond to a general night alarm. Since the big fire of twenty-five years ago, 

and that which consumed the _September_ till the end of _March,_ and then they all leave us at 

one time, except only such as have been lamed by the Sportsmen, and disabled for Flight; and 

then they will breed in _England,_ as there are Instances enough. About _Tunbridge,_ it is 

frequent to find them in Summer; and I have known the same in _Leicestershire._ I think if one 

could take Woodcocks here in Hay-Nets, as they do in _France,_ and pinion them or disable a 

Wing, and then turn them loose again, we might raise a Breed of them that would stay with us; but 

I have experienced that they will not feed if they are confined in Cages or Aviaries, for they must 

have liberty to run in search of their Food, which they find for the most part in moist places, near 

Springs; for I have often taken both the Woodcock and the Snipe with
