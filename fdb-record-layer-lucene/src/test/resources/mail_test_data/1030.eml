lost, the mother of her who was saved had rushed to meet her child as she l=
anded from the ford;=20

but instead of clasping her to her heart, as we had expected, she gave her =
a maternal welcome by=20

beating her most unmercifully with her fists, bestowing such lusty blows up=
on her back that we=20

could distinctly hear them at a distance of fifty yards; this punishment, w=
e were given to=20

understand, served her perfectly right, for having been foolish enough to v=
enture near the rapids.=20

The melancholy death-howl was now raised by all the women in the village, w=
hile the men=20

explored the river in search of the missing body. On the following morning =
the sheik appeared at=20

my tent, with a number of Arabs who had been unsuccessful, and he begged me=
, if possible, to=20

suggest some means for the discovery of the girl, as her remains should be =
properly interred.  I=20

proposed that they should procure a log of heavy wood, as near as possible =
the size of the girl,=20

and that this should be thrown into the rapids, in the exact spot where she=
 had disappeared; this,=20

being nearly the same weight, would be equally acted upon by the stream, an=
d would form a guide=20

which they should follow until it should lead them to some deep eddy, or wh=
irlpool formed by a=20

backwater; should the pilot log remain in such a spot, they would most prob=
ably find the body in=20

the same place. The men immediately procured a log, and set off with the sh=
eik himself to carry=20

out the experiment. In the afternoon, we heard a terrible howling and cryin=
g, and a crowd of men=20

and women returned to the village, some of whom paid us a visit; they had f=
ound the body. The=20

log had guided them about two miles distant, and had remained stationary in=
 a backwater near=20

where I had shot the bull hippopotamus; in this still pool, close to the ba=
nk, they almost=20

immediately discovered the girl floating slightly beneath the surface. No c=
rocodile had injured the=20

body, but the fish had destroyed a portion of the face; it was already so f=
ar advanced in=20

decomposition, that it was necessary to bury it upon the margin of the rive=
r, at the spot where it=20

was discovered. The people came to thank me for having originated the idea,=
 and the very=20

agreeable sheik spent the evening with us with a number of his people; this=
 was his greatest=20

delight, and we had become thoroughly accustomed to his daily visits. At su=
ch times we sat upon=20

an angarep, while he sat upon a mat stretched upon the ground, with a numbe=
r of his men, who=20

formed a half-circle around him; he then invariably requested that we would=
 tell him stories about=20

England. Of these he never tired, and with the assistance of Mahomet we est=
ablished a regular=20

entertainment; the great amusement of the Arabs being the mistakes that the=
y readily perceived=20

were made by Mahomet as interpreter. We knew sufficient Arabic to check and=
 to explain his=20

errors.  The death of the girl gave rise to a conversation upon drowning: t=
his turned upon the=20

subject of the girl herself and ended in a discussion upon the value of wom=
en; the  Fancy an=20

ardent lover (and what respect have you for a lover who is not ardent)--the=
 type you would like=20

your daughter to marry--virile, ambitious, chivalrous--a man who means to w=
ork hard and love=20

hard. Fancy putting before these lovers--eager and expectant of the joys be=
fore them--the=20

Lambeth picture of marriage. Do you expect to gain their confidence?  They =
ask for bread; you=20

give them a stone.                          ALLEGIANCE OF THE YOUNG.  Autho=
rity, and I include under=20

authority the Churches, will never gain the allegiance of the young unless =
their attitude is more=20

frank, more courageous, and more in accordance with realities.  And to tell=
 you the truth, I am not=20

sure that too much prudent self-restraint suits love and its purport. Roman=
ce and deliberate self-

control do not, to my mind, rhyme very well together. A touch of madness to=
 begin with does no=20

harm. Heaven knows life sobers it soon enough. If you don't start life with=
 a head of steam you=20



won't get far.  Sex love has, apart from parenthood, a purport of its own. =
It is something to prize=20

and to cherish for its own sake. It is an essential part of health and happ=
iness in marriage. And=20

now, if you will allow me, I will carry this argument a step further.  If s=
exual union is a gift of God it=20

is worth learning how to use it. Within its own sphere it should be cultiva=
ted so as to bring physical=20

satisfaction to both, not merely to one. The attainment of mutual and recip=
rocal joy in their=20

relations constitutes a firm bond between two people and makes for durabili=
ty of their marriage tie.=20

Reciprocity in sex love is the physical counterpart of sympathy. More marri=
ages fail from=20

inadequate and clumsy sex love than from too much sex love.                =
        PASSION A=20

WORTHY POSSESSION.  The lack of proper understanding is in no small measure=
 responsible=20

for the unfulfilment of (connubial) happiness, and every degree of disconte=
nt and unhappiness=20

may from this cause occur, leading to rupture of the marriage bond itself. =
How often do medical=20

men have to deal with these difficulties, and how fortunate if such difficu=
lties are disclosed early=20

enough in married life to be rectified. Otherwise how tragic may be their c=
onsequences, and many=20

a case in the Divorce Court has thus had its origin.  To the foregoing cont=
entions it might be=20

objected you are encouraging passion. My reply would be, passion is a worth=
y possession; most=20

men, who are any good, are capable of passion.  You all enjoy ardent and pa=
ssionate love in art=20

and literature. Why not give it a place in real life?  Why some people look=
 askance at passion is=20

because they are confusing it with sensuality. Sex love without passion is =
a poor, lifeless thing.=20

Sensuality, on the other hand, is on a level with gluttony--a physical exce=
ss--detached from=20

sentiment, chivalry, or tenderness.  It is just as important to give sex lo=
ve its place as to avoid its=20

over emphasis. Its real and effective restraints are those imposed by a lov=
ing and sympathetic=20

companionship, by=20


_
a lament on the part of the sheik that a nice young girl had been drowned i=
nstead of a useless old=20

woman. The sheik laid down the law with great force, "that a woman was of n=
o use when she=20

ceased to be young, unless she was a good strong person who could grind cor=
n, and carry water=20

from the river;" in this assertion he was seconded, and supported unanimous=
ly by the crowd of=20

Arabs present.  Now it was always a common practice among the Arab women, w=
hen they called=20

upon my wife, to request her to show her hands; they would then feel the so=
ft palms and exclaim=20

in astonishment, "Ah! she has never ground corn!" that being the duty of a =
wife unless she is rich=20

enough to possess slaves. Sheik Achmet requested me to give him some accoun=
t of our domestic=20

arrangements in England; I did this as briefly as possible, explaining how =
ladies received our=20

devoted attentions, extolling their beauty and virtue, and in fact giving h=
im an idea that England=20

was paradise, and that the ladies were angels. I described the variety of c=
olours; that instead of all=20

being dark, some were exceedingly fair; that others had red hair; that we h=
ad many bright black=20

eyes, and some irresistible dark blue; and at the close of my descriptions =
I believe the sheik and=20

his party felt disposed to emigrate immediately to the chilly shores of Gre=
at Britain; they asked,=20

"How far off is the exacting claims of career and that civic sense which pr=
ompts men to do social=20

service.  Now that the revision of the Prayer Book is receiving considerati=
on, I should like to=20

suggest, with great respect, that an addition be made to the objects of mar=
riage in the Marriage=20

Service, in these terms: "The complete realisation of the love of this man =
and this woman, the one=20

for the other."                               BIRTH CONTROL.  And now, if y=
ou will permit me, I will pass on=20

to consider the all-important question of Birth Control.  First, I will put=
 forward with confidence the=20

view that birth control is here to stay. It is an established fact, and for=
 good or evil has to be=20

accepted. Although the extent of its application can be and is being modifi=
ed, no denunciations will=20

abolish it.  Despite the influence and condemnations of the Church, it has =
been practised in=20

France for well over half a century, and in Belgium and other Catholic coun=
tries is extending. And=20

if the Roman Catholic Church, with its compact organisation, its power of a=
uthority, and its=20

discipline, cannot check this procedure, is it likely that Protestant Churc=
hes will be able to do so?--

for Protestant religions depend for their strength on the conviction and es=
teem they establish in the=20

heads and hearts of their people.  The reasons which lead parents to limit =
their=20


_
sigh, "that must be a very charming country; how could you possibly come aw=
ay from all your=20

beautiful wives? True, you have brought one with you: she is, of course, th=
e youngest and most=20

lovely; perhaps those you have left at home are the OLD ONES!" I was oblige=
d to explain, that we=20

are contented with one wife, and that even were people disposed to marry tw=
o, or more, they=20

would be punished with imprisonment. This announcement was received with a =
general=20

expression of indignation; the sheik and his party, who a few minutes ago w=
ere disposed to=20

emigrate, and settle upon our shores, would now at the most have ventured u=
pon a return ticket.=20

After some murmurs of disapprobation, there was a decided expression of dis=
belief in my last=20

statement. "Why," said the sheik, "the fact is simply IMPOSSIBLE! How CAN a=
 man be contented=20

with one wife? It is ridiculous, absurd! What is he to do when she becomes =
old? When she is=20

young, if very lovely, perhaps, he might be satisfied with her, but even th=
e young must some day=20

grow old, and selfish, but more often honourable and cogent. The desire to =
marry and to rear=20

children well equipped for life's struggle, limited incomes, the cost of li=
ving, burdensome taxation,=20

are forcible motives; and, further, amongst the educated classes there is t=
he desire of women to=20

take a part in life and their husband's careers, which is incompatible with=
 oft-recurring=20

pregnancies. Absence of birth control means late marriages, and these carry=
 with them irregular=20

unions and all the baneful consequences.  It is idle to decry illicit inter=
course and interpose=20

obstacles to marriage at one and the same time.  But, say many whose opinio=
ns are entitled to our=20

respect: "Yes--birth control may be necessary, but the only birth control w=
hich is justifiable is=20

voluntary abstention from connubial relations." Such abstention would be ei=
ther ineffective or, if=20

effective, impracticable and harmful to health and happiness.  To limit the=
 size of a family to, say,=20

four children during a child-bearing period of 20-25 years, would be to=20


_
fade like the woman; therefore, as he remains the same for many years, but =
she changes in a few=20

years, Nature has arranged that the man shall have young wives to replace t=
he old; does not the=20

Prophet allow it? Had not our forefathers many wives? and shall we have but=
 one? Look at=20

yourself. Your wife is young, and" (here the sheik indulged in compliments)=
, "but in ten years she=20

will not be the same as now; will you not then let her have a nice house co=
uple an amount of=20

abstention which for long periods would almost be equivalent to celibacy, a=
nd when one=20

remembers that owing to economic reasons the abstention would have to be mo=
st strict during the=20

earlier years of married life when desires are strongest, I maintain a dema=
nd is being made which=20

for the mass of people it is impossible to meet; that the endeavours to mee=
t it would impose a=20

strain hostile to health and happiness and carry with=20
