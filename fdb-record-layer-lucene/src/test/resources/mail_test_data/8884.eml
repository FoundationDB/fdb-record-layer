_Sansthanaka._ [_Enters and looks about, then hastily gets out in terror, a=
nd falls on the courtier's=20

neck._] Oh, oh, oh! You're a dead man! There's a witch, or a thief, that's =
sitting and living in my=20

bullock-cart. If it's a witch, we 'll both be robbed. If it's a thief, we '=
ll both be eaten alive.=20

_Courtier._ Don't be frightened. How could a witch travel in a bullock-cart=
? I hope that the heat of=20

the midday sun has not blinded you, so that you became the victim of an hal=
lucination when you=20

saw the shadow of Sthavaraka with the smock on it.  _Sansthanaka._ Sthavara=
ka, my little shon,=20

my shlave, are you alive?  _Sthavaraka._ Yes, sir.  _Sansthanaka._ But shir=
, there's a woman=20

sitting and living in the bullock-cart. Look and shee!  _Courtier._ A woman=
?      Then let us bow our=20

heads at once and go,       Like steers whose eyes the falling raindrops da=
ze;     In public spots my=20

dignity I show;       On high-born dames I hesitate to gaze.               =
      15  _Vasantasena._ [_In=20

amazement. Aside._] Oh, oh! It is that thorn in my eye, the king's brother-=
in-law. Alas! the=20

sensibility she built up a character of unalterable reason and good sense. =
Her letters are not=20

creations of genius, unless practical wisdom and integrity of purpose be fo=
rms of genius. She does=20

not gossip delightfully; at times she may seem a little hard or dry; but he=
r reason is really guided=20

by human kindness. "Her style," wrote a high authority, Dollinger, "is clea=
r, terse, refined, often=20

sententious; her business letters are patterns of simplicity and pregnant b=
revity. They might be=20

characterised as womanly yet manly, so well do they combine the warmth and =
depth of womanly=20

feeling with the strength and lucidity of a masculine mind." The foundation=
 of Saint-Cyr, for the=20

education of girls wellborn but poor, was the object of her constant solici=
tude; there she put out her=20

talents as a teacher and guide of youth to the best interest; there she fou=
nd play for her best=20

affections: "C'est le lieu," she said, "de delices pour moi."  The friend o=
f Madame de Sevigne, the=20

truest woman whom La Rochefoucauld had ever known, MADAME DE LA FAYETTE was=

author of two historical=20

woman! My coming hither proves as fruitless as the sowing of a handful of s=
eeds on salty soil.=20

What shall I do now?  _Sansthanaka._ Thish old shervant is afraid and he wo=
n't look into the cart.=20

Will you look into the cart, shir?  _Courtier._ I see no harm in that. Yes,=
 I will do it.  P. 198.12]=20

_Sansthanaka._ Are those things jackals that I shee flying into the air, an=
d are those things crows=20

that walk on all fours? While the witch is chewing him with her eyes, and l=
ooking at him with her=20

teeth, I 'll make my eshcape.  _Courtier._ [_Perceives Vasantasena. Sadly t=
o himself._] Is it=20

possible? The gazelle follows the tiger. Alas!      Her mate is lovely as t=
he autumn moon,     Who=20

waits for her upon the sandy dune;     And yet the swan will leave him? and=
 will go     To dance=20

attendance on a common crow?                        16  [_Aside to Vasantas=
ena._] Ah, Vasantasena!=20

This is neither right, nor worthy of you.      Your pride rejected him befo=
re,       Yet now for gold,=20

and for your mother's will  _Vasantasena._ No! [_She shakes her head._]  _C=
ourtier._ Your nature=20

knows your pride no more;               You honor him, a common woman still=
.               17  Did I not=20

tell[79] you to "serve the man you love, and him you hate"?  _Vasantasena._=
 I made a mistake in=20

the cart, and thus I came hither. I throw myself upon your protection.  _Co=
urtier._ Do not fear.=20

Come, I must deceive him. [_He returns to Sansthanaka._] Jackass, there is =
indeed a witch who=20

makes her home in the cart.  _Sansthanaka._ But shir, if a witch is living =
there, why are n't you=20

robbed? And if it 's a thief, why are n't you eaten alive?  _Courtier._ Why=
 try to determine that? But=20

if we should go back on foot through the gardens until we came to the city,=
 to Ujjayini, what harm=20

would that do?  _Sansthanaka._ And if we did, what then?  [121.7. S.  _Cour=
tier._ Then we should=20

have some exercise, and should avoid tiring the bullocks.  _Sansthanaka._ A=
ll right. Sthavaraka,=20

my shlave, drive on. But no! Shtop, shtop! I go on foot before gods and Bra=
hmans? Not much! I 'll=20

go in my cart, sho that people shall shee me a long way off, and shay "Ther=
e he goes, our=20

mashter, the king's brother-in-law."  _Courtier._ [_Aside._] It is hard to =
convert poison into=20

medicine. So be it, then. [_Aloud._] Jackass, this is Vasantasena, come to =
visit you.=20

_Vasantasena._ Heaven forbid!  _Sansthanaka._ [_Gleefully._] Oh, oh! To vis=
it me, an arishtocrat,=20

a man, a regular Vasudeva?  _Courtier._ Yes.  _Sansthanaka._ This is an unh=
eard-of piece of=20

luck. That other time I made her angry, sho now I 'll fall at her feet and =
beg her pardon.=20

_Courtier._ Capital!  _Sansthanaka._ I 'll fall at her feet myshelf. [_He a=
pproaches Vasantasena._]=20

Little mother, mamma dear, lishten to my prayer.      I fold my hands and f=
all before thy feet--=20

Thine eyes are large, thy teeth are clean and neat,       Thy finger-nails =
are ten--forgive thy shlave=20

What, love-tormented, he offended, shweet.                   18  _Vasantase=
na._ [_Angrily._] Leave=20

me! Your her friend the Duchess of Orleans, and of two--perhaps three--roma=
nces, the latest of=20

which, in the order of chronology, is the masterpiece of seventeenth-centur=
y fiction. Marie de la=20

Vergne, born in 1634, a pupil of Menage, married at twenty-one to M. de la =
Fayette, became the=20

trusted companion of the bright and gracious Henrietta of England. It is no=
t that part of Madame's=20

life, when she acted as intermediary between Louis XIV. and her brother, Ch=
arles II., that is=20

recorded by her friend: it is the history of her heart. Nothing is more tou=
ching in its simplicity than=20

the narrative of Madame's last moments; it serves as the best possible comm=
ent on the pathetic=20

Funeral Oration of Bossuet. We have no grounds for asserting that the marri=
ed life of Madame de=20

la Fayette was unhappy, except through the inadequacy of a husband whose be=
st qualities seem=20

to have been of a negative kind. During the fifteen years which preceded th=
e death of La=20

Rochefoucauld her friendship for him was the centre of her existence. She s=
eemed to bear about=20



with her some secret grief; something remained veiled from other friends th=
an he, and they named=20

her _le Brouillard_. She outlived her friend by thirteen years, and during =
ten was widowed. In 1693=20

she died.  Her earliest novel, _La Princesse de Montpensier_ (1662), a tale=
 of the days of the=20

Valois and of St. Bartholomew, is remarkable for its truthful pictures of t=
he manners of the court, its=20

rendering of natural and unexaggerated feeling, and for the fact that it tr=
eats of married life,=20

occupying itself with such themes as have been dealt with in many of its mo=
dern successors. The=20

_Zayde_, of eight years later, was written in collaboration with Segrais. I=
t is in _La Princesse de=20

Cleves_ (1678) that the genius and the heart of Madame de la Fayette find a=
 perfect expression.=20

The Princess, married to a husband who loves her devotedly, and whom she ho=
nours, but whose=20

feelings she cannot return, is tempted by the brilliant Duc de Nemours and =
by the weakness of her=20

own passion, to infidelity. She resolves to confide her struggle to her hus=
band, and seek in him a=20

protector against herself. The hard confession is made, but a grievous and =
inevitable change has=20

passed over their lives. Believing himself deceived, M. de Cleves is seized=
 by a fever and dies, not=20

without the consolation of learning his error. Nemours renews his vows and =
entreaties; the=20

Princess refuses his hand, and atones for her error in cloistered seclusion=
. The tale has lost none=20

of its beauty and pathos after a lapse of two centuries. Does it reveal the=
 hidden grief of the=20

writer's life? And was her friend, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, delivered f=
rom his gout and more=20

than a score of years, transformed by Madame de la Fayette into the foiled =
lover of her tale?=20

CHAPTER V BOILEAU AND LA FONTAINE   The great name in criticism of the seco=
nd half of the=20

seventeenth century is that of Boileau. But one of whom Boileau spoke harsh=
ly, a soldier, a man of=20

the world, the friend of Ninon de l'Enclos, a=20


_
spurns him with her foot._]  _Sansthanaka._ [_Wrathfully._]      Thish head=
 that mother and that=20

mamma kissed,     That never bent to worship god, I wist,     Upon thish he=
ad she dared to plant=20

her feet,     Like jackals on the carrion they meet.                       =
19  Sthavaraka, you shlave, where=20

did you pick her up?  _Sthavaraka._ Master, the highway was blocked by vill=
agers' wagons. So I=20

stopped my cart near Charudatta's orchard, and got out. And while I was hel=
ping a villager with his=20

wagon, I suppose she mistook this cart for another, and climbed in.  P. 201=
.14]  _Sansthanaka._=20

Oho! she mishtook my cart for another? and did n't come to shee me? Get out=
 of my cart, get out!=20

You 're going to visit your poor merchant's shon, are you? Those are my bul=
locks you 're driving.=20

Get out, get out, you shlave! Get out, get out!  _Vasantasena._ Truly, you =
honor me when you say=20

that I came to see Charudatta. Now what must be, must be.  _Sansthanaka._  =
    These hands of=20

mine, ten-finger-naily,       These hands sho lotush-leafy,     Are itching=
-anxious, girl, to dally=20

With you; and in a jiffy     I 'll drag Your Shweetness by the hair       F=
rom the cart wherein you ride,=20

As did Jatayu Bali's fair,       The monkey Bali's bride.                  =
                 20  _Courtier._      So=20

virtuous ladies may not be     Insulted thus despitefully;     Nor garden c=
reepers may not be=20

Robbed of their leaves so cruelly.                           21  Stand up, =
man. I will help her to alight.=20

Come, Vasantasena! [_Vasantasena alights and stands apart._]  (1613-1703), =
among his various=20

writings, aided the cause of criticism by the intuition which he had of wha=
t is excellent, by a=20

fineness of judgment as far removed from mere licence as from the pedantry =
of rules. Fallen into=20

disfavour with the King, Saint-Evremond was received into the literary soci=
ety of London. His=20

criticism is that of a fastidious taste, of balance and moderation, guided =
by tradition, yet open to=20

new views if they approved themselves to his culture and good sense. Had hi=
s studies been more=20

serious, had his feelings been more generous and ardent, had his moral sens=
e been less shallow,=20

he might have made important contributions to literature. As it was, to be =
a man of the world was=20

his trade, to be a writer was only an admirable foible.  NICOLAS BOILEAU, n=
amed DESPREAUX,=20

from a field (pre) of his father's property at Crosne, was born in Paris, 1=
636, son of the registrar of=20

the Grand Chambre du Palais. His choice of a profession lay between the Chu=
rch and that with=20

which his father was connected--the law; but though he made some study of t=
heology, and was=20

called to the bar, his inclination for literature could not be resisted. Hi=
s whole life, indeed, was that=20

of a man of letters--upright, honourable, serious, dignified, simple; gener=
ous to the friends whose=20

genius he could justly applaud; merciless to books and authors condemned by=
 his reason, his=20

good sense, his excellent judgment. He was allied by an ardent admiration t=
o Racine, and less=20

intimately to Moliere, La Fontaine, and Chapelle; Jansenist through his rel=
igious sympathies, and=20

closely=20
