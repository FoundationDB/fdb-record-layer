open, it was not to resume her seat.  She stood absently staring at the key=
s--for these strange=20

pictures followed her; and indeed that one half-unconscious trial of '_I am=
 asleep, do not waken=20

me_' had been quite enough for her in her present mood.                    =
              *CHAPTER IV.*=20

*'AMONG THE UNTRODDEN WAYS.'*   Yes; it soon became clear that Meenie Dougl=
as, in view=20



of this forthcoming departure, had resolved to forego something of the too =
obvious reserve she=20

had recently imposed on herself--if, indeed, that maidenly shrinking and sh=
yness had not been=20

rather a matter of instinct than of will.  When Ronald came home on the fol=
lowing evening she was=20

seated with Maggie in the old familiar way at a table plentifully littered =
with books, patterns, and=20

knitting; and when she shook hands with him, her timidly uplifted eyes had =
much of the old=20

friendliness in them, and her smile of welcome was pleasant to see.  It was=
 he who was diffident=20

and very respectful.  For if her mother had enjoined her to be a little mor=
e distant in manner=20

towards this one or the other of those around her--well, that was quite int=
elligible; that was quite=20

right; and he could not complain; but on the other hand, if the girl hersel=
f, in this very small=20

domestic circle, seemed rather anxious to put aside those barriers which we=
re necessary out of=20

doors, he would not presume on her good-nature.  And yet--and yet--he could=
 not help thawing a=20

little; for she was very kind, and even merry withal; and her eyes were lik=
e the eyes of the Meenie=20

of old.  'I am sure Maggie will be glad to get away from Inver-Mudal,' she =
was saying, 'for she will=20

not find anywhere a schoolmistress as hard as I have been.  But maybe she w=
ill not have to go to=20

school at all, if she has to keep house for you?'  'But she'll no have to k=
eep house for me,' Ronald=20

said at once.  'If she goes to Glasgow, she'll be much better with my broth=
er's family, for that will=20

be a home for her.'  'And where will you go, Ronald?' she said.  'Oh, into =
a lodging--I can fend for=20

myself.'  At this she looked grave--nay, she did not care to conceal her di=
sapproval.  For had she=20

not been instructing Maggie in the mysteries of housekeeping in a town--as =
far as these were=20

known to herself: and had not the little girl showed great courage; and dec=
lared there was nothing=20

she would not attempt rather than be separated from her brother Ronald?  'I=
t would never do,' said=20

he, 'to leave the lass alone in the house all day in a big town.  It's very=
 well here, where she has=20

neighbours and people to look after her from time to time; but among strang=
ers----'  Then he=20

looked at the table.  'But where's the tea ye said ye would ask Miss Dougla=
s in to?'  'We were so=20

busy with the Glasgow housekeeping,' Meenie said, laughing, 'that we forgot=
 all about it.'  'I'll go=20

and get it ready now,' the little Maggie said, and she went from the room, =
leaving these two alone.=20

He was a little embarrassed; and she was also.  There had been no _amantium=
 irae_ of any kind;=20

but all the same the _integratio amoris_ was just a trifle difficult; for s=
he on her side was anxious to=20

have their old relations re-established during the brief period that would =
elapse ere he left the=20

neighbourhood, and yet she was hesitating and uncertain; while he on his si=
de maintained a=20

strictly respectful reserve.  He 'knew his place;' his respect towards her =
was part of his own self-

respect; and if it did not occur to him that it was rather hard upon Meenie=
 that all the advances=20

towards a complete rehabilitation of their friendship=20

because he was completely ignorant of a good deal else that had happened of=
 late.  Of course,=20

which she had recently met and parted from him when by chance they passed e=
