managed the transition relatively well, as size has tended to bring with it industrial diversity; 

smaller industrial centers have fared far worse. The Soviet regime created new industrial centers 

such as Tomsk and Novosibirsk, but Siberia and the Russian Far Eastern regions remain largely 

unindustrialised, having traditionally served as a raw materials and energy base. Owing to the 

boundless faith of Soviet planners in the benefits of scale, one massive enterprise, or a small 

group of related enterprises, often formed the basis for the entire local economy of a substantial 

city or region. This factor, compounded by the absence of unemployment benefits, makes the 

closure of bankrupt enterprises a politically difficult decision."  The politically incorrect truth is that 

Russia's old power-structure is largely intact, having altered only its ideological label. It is as 

avaricious, nefarious and obstructive as ever. Nor does the Russian state sport any checks and 

balances. Its institutions are suspect, its executive untouchable, its law enforcement agencies 

delinquent.  Russians still hanker after "men of iron" and seek tradition rather than innovation, 

prefer unity to pluralism, and appreciate authority more than individualism. Russia - a ramshackle 

amalgamation of competing turfs - is still ill-suited for capitalism or for liberal democracy, though 

far less than it was only ten years ago.  Conspicuous consumption of imported products by vulgar 

parvenus is no substitute to true modernity and a functioning economy. Russia is frequently 

praised by expats with vested interests and by international financial institutions, the long arms of 

its newfound ally, the United States.  But, in truth, "modern", "stable", Russia is merely a glittering 

veneer beneath which lurk, festering, the old ills of authoritarianism, lawlessness, oligarchy, 

aggression, ignorance, superstition, and repression mingled with extremes of poverty and disease. 

Here is one safe prediction: none of these will diminish next year.  Russia Straddles the Euro-

Russia's Israeli Oil Bond  Russia's Idled Spies  Russia in 2003  Russian President Vladimir Putin 

warned on Tuesday, in an interview he granted to TF1, a French television channel, that unilateral 

American-British military action against Iraq would be a "grave mistake" and an "unreasonable use 

of force". Russia might veto it in the Security Council, he averred.  In a joint declaration with 

France and Germany, issued the same day, he called to enhance the number of arms inspectors 

in Iraq as an alternative to war.  Only weeks ago Russia was written off, not least by myself, as a 

satellite of the United States. This newfound assertiveness has confounded analysts and experts 

everywhere. Yet, appearances aside, it does not signal a fundamental shift in Russian policy or 

worldview.  Russia could not resist the temptation of playing once more the Leninist game of 

"inter-imperialist contradictions". It has long the long-expected succour was at last at hand.  A 

party was sent to overtake the little Port Royal ship to bring back the colonists.  No sooner were 

they landed than Poutraincourt broached a hogshead of wine, and Port Royal became a scene of 

mirth {21} and festivity. When Champlain and Poutraincourt went off to make further exploration, 

Lescarbot was left in charge of the colony.  He set briskly to work to show the people how they 

should become prosperous. He ordered crops of wheat, rye, and barley to be sown in the rich 

meadows and gardens to be planted.  Some he cheered, others he shamed into industry, never 

sparing himself, so that by and by it was not wonderful that everybody loved the merry, witty, 

bustling Lescarbot. Not a day passed but he set going some new and useful work.  Until now the 



people had ground their corn with hand-mills, as their fathers and grandfathers had done for 

hundreds of years; Lescarbot showed them how to make a water-mill.  He also taught them how to 

make fire-bricks and a furnace, and how to turn the sap of the trees into tar and turpentine.  No 

wonder the Indians, astonished to see so many novel industries growing up before their eyes, 

cried out, "How many things these Normans know!"  When the explorers returned to Port Royal, 

rather dispirited, Lescarbot arranged a masquerade to welcome them back, and all the ensuing 

winter, which was extremely mild, was given up to content and good cheer.  Then it was that 

Champlain started his famous "Order of a Good Time," of which many stories have come down to 

us.  The members of this order were the fifteen leading men of Port Royal.  They met in 

Poutraincourt's great hall, where the great log fire roared merrily.  For a single day each of the 

members was saluted by the rest as Grand Master and wore round his neck the splendid collar of 

office, while he busied himself {22} with the duty of providing dinner and entertainment.  One and 

all declared the fish and game were better than in Paris, and plenty of wine there was to toast the 

King and one another in turn.  At the right hand of the Grand Master sat the guest of honour, the 

wrinkled sagamore, Membertou, nearly one hundred years old, his eyes gleaming with 

amusement as toast, song, and tale followed one another.  On the floor squatted other Indians 

who joined in the gay revels.  As a final item on the programme, the pipe of peace, with its huge 

lobster-like bowl, went round, and all smoked it in turn until the tobacco in its fiery oven was 

exhausted.  Then, and not till then, the long winter evening was over.  [Illustration: 'The Order of a 

Good Time' 1606]  What jolly times those were!  If only they could have lasted!  Port Royal might 

have become a great city and Acadia a populous province. But bad tidings for Port Royal came 

from France.  The next ship that sailed into the harbour brought word that De Monts' charter had 

been revoked by the King, and his friends would support his scheme with no more money.  So 

there appeared nothing to do but to bid good-bye to Port Royal and their Indian friends, who 

watched them depart with sadness, promising to look after the fort and its belongings until the 

white men should return from over the wide sea.  Champlain had already in his heart

economic, if not geopolitical, goals. Its convenient geographic sprawl - part Europe, part Asia - 

allows it to pose as both a continental power and a global one with interests akin to those of the 

United States. Hence the verve with which it delved into the war against terrorism, recasting 

internal oppression and meddling abroad as its elements.  As Vladimir Lukin, deputy speaker of 

the Duma observed recently, Britain having swerved too far towards America - Russia may yet 

become an intermediary between a bitterly disenchanted USA and an irked Europe and between 

the rich, industrialized West and developing countries in Asia. Publicly, the USA has only mildly 

disagreed with Russia's reluctance to countenance a military far inland on the St. Lawrence; but 

as for Poutraincourt, he swore to deal a blow at his enemies in France and come back to take 

deep root in the fertile Acadian soil.  While, therefore, Champlain {23} was with his followers 

founding Quebec, and De Monts, discouraged, had lost all interest in Acadia, Poutraincourt busied 

himself to such purpose that three years later (1610), in spite of all the baffling obstacles he met 

with, he set out again for his promised land with a fresh shipload of settlers.  At this time King 

Henry the Fourth was surrounded by members of the Society of Jesus (called Jesuits), who had 

made themselves already very powerful in the politics of Europe.  The King ordered Poutraincourt 

to take out a Jesuit

France and Germany with vitriol for saying, essentially, the same things.  The United States knows 

that Russia will not jeopardize the relevance of the Security Council - one of the few remaining 

hallmarks of past Soviet grandeur - by vetoing an American-sponsored resolution. But Russia 

cannot be seen to be abandoning a traditional ally and a major customer (Iraq) and newfound 

friends (France and Germany) too expediently.  Nor can Putin risk further antagonizing Moscow 

hardliners who already regard his perceived "Gorbachev-like" obsequiousness and far reaching 

concessions to Poutraincourt, distrusting the Jesuits, evaded the priest who had been chosen to 

accompany him at Bordeaux, and took out one of his own choosing instead, Father La Flche. 

What was their joy when they landed in midsummer to find everything at Port Royal just as they 

had left it!  One may be sure the Indians gave their pale-face friends a cordial greeting.  Old 

Membertou, still alive, embraced Poutraincourt and declared that now he was ready to be baptized 

a Christian.  The christening duly took place, and the ancient sagamore was renamed Henri, after 

the King, and his chief
