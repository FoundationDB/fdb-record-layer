heard?" asked Red Rex while they tarried in Derrydown. "I understand that i=
t is not far, and that=20

there is great game to be had in those still coverts."  "Nay; in these days=
 we do not hunt in my=20

Kingdom," replied King Victor. "Since hearing the tale of the Bear's Daught=
er it has been no=20

pleasure for any of us to kill or hurt any dumb creature."  "Ah!" cried Red=
 Rex. "I had forgot that=20

story! Hans wounded a poor friendly bear who had done him no harm. That was=
 cowardly, indeed!=20

True, Cousin. Neither do I wish to hunt any more. It was that tale which yo=
u punctuated by your=20

noisy arrival in Kisington, do you remember? I picked out that story for my=
self; and it has done a=20

service to the wild creatures of my Kingdom, who will henceforth be safe fr=
om me and mine. But,=20

indeed, though we do not hunt, I would fain see this Ancient Wood, where th=
e Old Gnome lived in=20

his hollow tree."  "We will go this very day," answered King Victor. And go=
 they did. Sure enough,=20

in a clearing they found the house which David had built for his little wif=
e, snug and clean and=20

empty. Close by in the thick woods the three boys discovered a giant tree-s=
tump, papered with=20

moss and hung with cobweb hammocks, which they felt sure had been the house=
 of the Hermit=20

Gnome in the days before he became a Fairy.  "I must bring my little daught=
er Hope to see this=20

place," declared the Red King. "She would love it best of all. What good ti=
mes she would have with=20

me here in the forest! I would tell her the story of David, and learn mysel=
f to be a woodsman."  "It=20

is more amusing than war," declared King Victor. "With books in the city an=
d woodcraft in the wild,=20

who would be a soldier? Look, now! I will give to your little Princess Hope=
 as a gift this tiny=20

cottage, where David and his wife and little daughter lived so happily. Whe=
n she comes to visit our=20

Kingdom,--often, as I hope,--you can play at being a woodsman; which is a g=
ood game. But you=20

must promise to let me be your guest for at least one night of each visit. =
For I, too, love these=20

woods and this little house which has been my secret retreat for many years=
. Will you accept my=20

gift for your little daughter, Cousin?"  "Gladly do I accept!" cried Red Re=
x. And they shook hands=20

gayly.  Still further they penetrated across the meadow to the woods once c=
alled the Great Fear.=20

Red Rex was anxious to know more of that once dangerous neighborhood. But s=
ince peace had=20

become the fashion in the Kingdom, the wicked Gnomes, who had tried as long=
 as possible to=20

prick war-poison into the hearts of men, found their occupation gone. When =
the good King's peace=20

plans reached their ears the Gnomes groaned in despair. They held a council=
, and decided=20

unanimously to curl up forthwith in the long sleep and let the world alone.=
  There was now no sign=20

of them, save where here and there a gnarled arm or burly bended knee seeme=
d to push up from=20

the ground. But these were so covered with mould and moss that it was impos=
sible to tell them=20

from the fallen tree-trunks or mounds of earth. Harold and Robert and Richa=
rd did not disturb=20

these mossy mysteries. In times of peace it is better to let sleeping Gnome=
s lie. Only the makers=20

of ammunition and warships and newspaper individuals of this singular race =
have for each other's=20

sufferings; and it is quite a mistake, therefore, to suppose that absentee =
landlords, who are for the=20

most part Irish, live away from their properties because they are so suscep=
tible to the sight of=20

distress that they cannot bear to look upon their own tenantry. To an Engli=
shman nothing is more=20

consoling than to feel that the Irish question is essentially an Irish ques=
tion, and that Englishmen=20

have nothing at all to do with it--that the tenant-right question is one be=
tween Irish landlords and=20

Irish tenants--that the religious question is one between Irish Catholics a=
nd Irish Protestants--and=20

that the reason that no Englishman can understand them is, because they are=
 Irish, and inverted=20

brains would be necessary to their comprehension. These considerations impr=
essed themselves=20



forcibly upon my notice at a meeting of the National League, which I attend=
ed in Dublin, the object=20

of which was to secure the national independence of Ireland, and to free it=
 from the tyranny of=20

British rule. One of the speakers made out so strong a case for England, th=
at I could only account=20

for it by the fact that he was an Irishman arguing the case of his own coun=
try. "How," he asked, "is=20

the English Parliament to know our grievances, when out of 105 members that=
 we send up to it,=20

there are not two who are honest? Why is not the O'Donoghue in the chair to=
-day? he is the only=20

real patriot, and we can't trust him. Why are the Irish Protestants not tru=
e to themselves and the=20

cause? Why, in fact, is there not a single man of the smallest position and=
 influence either on the=20

platform or in the body of the house, except myself, who am a magistrate of=
 the county of Cork,=20

and therefore unable to advocate those violent measures by which alone our =
liberties are to be=20

gained? Is it because we have got them already? No; but because Irishmen do=
 not care a farthing=20

about them. Shame on them for their apathy," &c. It was pleasant to listen =
to this Irish patriot=20

inveighing against his countrymen, and finally making England responsible f=
or Irishmen being=20

what they are. Bless them! my heart warmed towards them as I saw them at Qu=
eenstown trooping=20

on board an emigrant-ship, looking ruddy and prosperous, bound on the usefu=
l errand of=20

propagating Fenianism, of exhibiting themselves as choice specimens of an o=
ppressed nationality,=20

and of devoting their brilliant political instincts, their indefatigable in=
dustry, and their judicial=20

calmness, to the service of that country which is at present in danger of s=
uffering from a=20

determination of blood to the head in the person of Andy Johnson. If anythi=
ng can trim that=20

somewhat crank craft "United States," let us hope that it will be by taking=
 in Irishmen at the rate of=20

one thousand per week to serve as ballast; for most certainly the best mean=
s of increasing the=20

sailing qualities of the leaky old tub, "British Constitution," will be by =
inducing the ballast aforesaid=20

to throw itself overboard. I was pitching and rolling abominably between Ki=
ngston and Holyhead as=20

I drew this appropriate nautical parallel, and was not in a mood to relish =
the following=20

announcement, which appeared in the pages of a fashionable=20


_
would be eager to see those busy-bodies awake and at their malicious work a=
gain, causing=20

peaceful places to become a Great Fear.  When the happy fortnight ended, th=
e Red King went=20

back to his Kingdom and his little Princess Hope, taking with him the beaut=
iful Lady Anyse.  Then=20

began a time of peace in that hitherto restless land; a time of peace and p=
rosperity and happiness,=20

of neighborliness and the exchange of friendly doings. King Victor went to =
visit the erstwhile War-

Lord, and in that time taught the Red King many useful arts of peace. And w=
ho, think you, went=20

with King Victor on that visit? Who but the good Librarian and organ, that =
happened to be the first=20

journal I bought in England:--  "We are in a position to state that a marri=
age is arranged between=20

Lord Frank Vanecourt, M.P., second son of the late Duke of Dunderhead, and =
Lady Ursula=20

Newlyte, eldest daughter of the late Earl of Broadhem."  How I envied "our =
position," and what a=20

very different one mine was! However, the notice served its purpose, for it=
 prepared me for what I=20

should have to encounter in London--the sort of running fire of congratulat=
ion I must expect to=20

undergo all along Piccadilly, down St James's Street, and along Pall Mall. =
Should I simper a coy=20

admission, or storm=20
