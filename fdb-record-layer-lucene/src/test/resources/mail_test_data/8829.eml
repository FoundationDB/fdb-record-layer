persons.  Such is the bare outline of a career that has the essential characteristics of struggle and 

achievement, of intimate contact with eminent men and women, and, most interesting of all, is not 

a fulfilled career, but a life still in the making.  The significance of _The Americanization of Edward 

Bok_ is threefold and is clearly indicated by the author's own conception of the three periods that 

should constitute a well-rounded life..  These he characterizes as education, achievement, and 

service for others. Conceived in this ideal spirit, the autobiography has a message for every 

American schoolboy or schoolgirl who is looking forward to the years of achievement and who 

should be made to understand that there is a finer duty beyond.  It has an equally important 

message for those of us who in the turmoil of a busy world are struggling to achieve, in many 

instances with no vision beyond the desire to provide as best we can for the welfare of ourselves 

and our families.  Lastly, it has an inspiring, constructive message for those who are now in a 

position to render altruistic service and thus contribute their share toward making the world in 

general and America in particular a better place in which to live.  Because of the recognized value 

of Edward Bok's life-story, the present abridged edition, which is re-named _A Dutch Boy Fifty 

Years After_, has been undertaken.  The chapters here brought together, with the approval of Mr. 

Bok, tell the story of the Dutch boy in the American school, his earnest efforts to help his parents,
