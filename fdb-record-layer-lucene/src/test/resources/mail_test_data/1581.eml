must have known them; and (_b_), that logical inference alone is amply suff=
icient to justify anyone=20

in regarding Plato's writings as allegories and "dark sayings," veiling tru=
ths which he had no right=20

to divulge.  This established, how comes it that one of the best Greek scho=
lars in England, Prof.=20

Jowett, the modern translator of Plato's works, seeks to demonstrate that n=
one of the Dialogues--

including even the _Timaeus_--have any element of Oriental Mysticism about =
them? Those who=20

can discern the true spirit of Plato's Philosophy will hardly be convinced =
by the arguments which=20

the Master of Balliol College lays before his readers. "Obscure and repulsi=
ve" to him, the=20

_Timaeus_ may certainly be; but it is as certain that this obscurity does n=
ot arise, as the Professor=20

tells his public, "in the infancy of physical science," but rather in its d=
ays of secresy; not "out of the=20

confusion of theological, mathematical, and physiological notions," or "out=
 of the desire to=20

conceive the whole of Nature without any adequate knowledge of the parts."(=
4) For Mathematics=20

and Geometry were the backbone of Occult cosmogony, hence of "Theology," an=
d the=20

physiological notions of the ancient Sages are being daily verified by Scie=
nce in our age; at least,=20

to those who know how to read and understand ancient Esoteric works. The "k=
nowledge of the=20

parts" avails us little, if this knowledge only leads us the more to ignora=
nce of the Whole, or the=20

"nature and reason of the Universal," as Plato called Deity, and causes us =
to blunder most=20

egregiously because of our boasted inductive methods. Plato may have been "=
incapable of=20

induction, or generalization in the modern sense";(5) he may have been igno=
rant also, of the=20

circulation of the blood, which, we are told, "was absolutely unknown to hi=
m,"(6) but then, there is=20

naught to disprove that he knew what blood _is_--and this is more than any =
modern Physiologist=20

or Biologist can claim nowadays.  Though a wider and far more generous marg=
in for knowledge is=20

allowed the "physical philosopher" by Prof. Jowett than by nearly any other=
 modern commentator=20

and critic, nevertheless, his criticism so considerably outweighs his lauda=
tion, that it may be as=20

well to quote his own words, to show clearly his bias. Thus he says:       =
To bring sense under the=20

control of reason; to find some way     through the labyrinth or chaos of a=
ppearances, either the=20

highway     of mathematics, or more devious paths suggested by the analogy =
of     man with the=20

world and of the world with man; to see that all     things have a cause an=
d are tending towards an=20

end--this is the     spirit of the ancient physical philosopher.(7) But we =
neither     appreciate the=20

conditions of knowledge to which he was subjected,     nor have the ideas w=
hich fastened upon his=20

imagination the same     hold upon us. For he is hovering between matter an=
d mind; he is     under=20

the dominion of abstractions; his impressions are taken     almost at rando=
m from the outside of=20

nature; he sees the light,     but not the objects which are revealed by th=
e light; and he brings=20

into juxtaposition things which to us appear wide as the poles     asunder,=
 because he finds=20

nothing between them.   The last proposition but one must evidently be dist=
asteful to the modern=20

"physical philosopher," who sees the "objects" before him, but fails to see=
 the light of the Universal=20

Mind, which reveals them, _i.e._, who proceeds in a diametrically opposite =
way. Therefore the=20

learned Professor comes to the conclusion that the ancient Philosopher, who=
m he now judges=20

from Plato's _Timaeus_,  Melbourne,[798] near the spine. In any event the r=
ope should be =E2=80=9Cfreely=20

elastic.=E2=80=9D G. M. Hammond[799] thinks that the object in judicial han=
ging  should be strangulation,=20

and that the criminal should be pulled up and  left to hang thirty minutes;=
 the rope should be soft=20

and flexible so  as to closely fit the neck; a weight should be attached to=
 the feet of  persons under=20

150 pounds. Larimore[800] also advocates strangulation  instead of attempti=
ng dislocation of the=20



vertebr=C3=A6. Porter[801] suggests  that for dislocation the noose be draw=
n tightly around the neck at=20

the  last moment, the knot being either at one side or, still better, in  f=
ront. Dislocation may be still=20

further assured if a hollow wooden or  leaden ball be placed over the knot =
close to the neck, thus=20

forming a  fulcrum to throw the spinal column out of the perpendicular line=
 at the  point of pressure.=20

Hanging is a common mode of suicide, especially in insane asylums and priso=
ns. It is sometimes=20

accidental, and rarely homicidal. It is said to have been attempted for ero=
tic purposes.  The=20

compression of the neck acts in line with the axis of the body; while in st=
rangulation it acts=20

perpendicularly to that axis.  The final cause of death will depend on: 1. =
The suddenness and=20

completeness of interference with the access of air; asphyxia. 2. Pressure =
on the large veins of the=20

neck, preventing the return of blood from the head, causing congestion of b=
rain and coma. 3.=20

Pressure on the large arteries of the neck, preventing access of blood to t=
he brain; causing=20

an=C3=A6mia of the brain and syncope. 4. Injury to spinal cord or pneumogas=
tric nerves or all of them;=20

causing paralysis. A combination of numbers 1 and 2 is usually found in sui=
cidal hanging; and=20

probably all of them in homicidal and judicial hanging. The more protected =
the air-passages are=20

from pressure the greater part will coma or syncope have in the cause of de=
ath.  Mackenzie,[802]=20

as the result of examination of 130 suicidal hangings, says that 119 died o=
f asphyxia, 8 of=20

asphyxia and apoplexy, 2 of syncope, and 1 of apoplexy alone. Coutagne[803]=
 thinks =C5=93dema of=20

the lungs, =E2=80=9C=C5=93dema carmin=C3=A9,=E2=80=9D has an important part=
 in causing death.  The following conditions=20

tend to produce asphyxia: a tight ligature, or a loose ligature above the h=
yoid bone. To produce=20

coma, a loose ligature pressing against the hyoid bone or larynx, especiall=
y a cretified larynx. To=20

both asphyxia and congestion of brain, a ligature just beneath the lower ja=
w, or around lower part=20

of neck.  Hofmann[804] states that when the ligature is placed between the =
larynx and hyoid bone,=20

the base of the tongue is pushed upward against the posterior wall of the p=
harynx, completely=20

stopping respiration and causing asphyxia. Taylor[805] states that if the r=
ope presses on or above=20

the larynx, the air-passages are _not_ so completely closed as when pressur=
e is below the larynx.=20

In the latter case death would be immediate; in the former a slight amount =
of respiration might=20

continue. The instantaneous loss of consciousness is due, not to asphyxia a=
lone, but to=20

compression of the large vessels, especially the carotids, against the tran=
sverse processes of the=20

vertebr=C3=A6, causing rupture of the middle and inner coats, and at the sa=
me time compression of the=20

jugular veins and pneumogastric nerves. Immediate unconsciousness will almo=
st certainly follow=20

compression of the pneumogastrics. He also believes that the loss of consci=
ousness and of power=20

of self-help occur at the moment that the noose is tightened around the nec=
k. There is no record of=20

any one who attempted suicide by=20


_
even irrational way. For:       He passes abruptly from persons to ideas an=
d numbers, and _from=20

ideas and numbers to persons_,(8) he confuses subject and object,     _firs=
t_ and _final_ causes,=20

and in dreaming of geometrical     figures(9) is lost in a flux of sense. A=
nd now an effort of mind=20

is required on our parts _in order to understand his double     language_, =
or to apprehend _the=20

twilight character of the     knowledge_ and the genius of ancient philosop=
hers which, under=20

such conditions [?], seems by a divine power in many instances to     have =
anticipated the=20

truth.(10)   Whether "such conditions" imply those of ignorance and mental =
stolidity in "the genius=20

of ancient philosophers" or something else, we do not recover himself, alth=
ough no doubt some=20

would have done so if the speedy unconsciousness had not prevented. Hofmann=
 mentions the=20

case of a man who was found hanging, and with a loaded revolver in his hand=
, apparently having=20

intended to shoot as well as hang himself, but lost consciousness before he=
 had time to discharge=20

the revolver. According to him the causes of death are three: occlusion of =
the air-passages,=20

interruption of passage of blood to brain, and compression of pneumogastric=
 nerves.  Von=20

Buhl[806] experimented on cadavers and concluded that in hanging, the epigl=
ottis and arytenoids=20

are pressed over the glottis, and the tongue and the =C5=93sophagus against=
 the vertebr=C3=A6, causing=20

death by apn=C5=93a. When the trachea was isolated=20
