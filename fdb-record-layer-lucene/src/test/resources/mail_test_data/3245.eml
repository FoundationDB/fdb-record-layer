when she hesitated.  "Is it right?" he asked when she had _
always been together, and had been leaders of the class that had been gradu=
ated from the local=20

high school the month before.  To-night they had been discussing for the hu=
ndredth time their=20

plans for the coming year. Carl (was going to college in the autumn,--that =
was a settled thing),--

and Lee longed to go as he had never longed for anything before in his life=
. There was nothing to=20

prevent his going but the lack of funds. His mother was to spend the winter=
 with a married=20

daughter, ten years his senior. He had a scholarship in the college and a c=
hance to pay his way in=20

part by working in the college library. But that would take all his spare t=
ime, and he was sure that=20

he would still lack about one hundred dollars of having enough to carry him=
 through the first year.=20

Both boys dearly loved Lake Wanna-Wasso, on the shore of which they lived. =
It was, indeed, one=20

of the most beautiful of all the sheets of water which a half-century ago k=
new the dip of the=20

Indian's paddle and the ripple of his birch-bark canoe. There may be other =
waters as clear and=20

sweet as those of northern Michigan, but the native and the enthusiastic su=
mmer visitor find it hard=20

to believe.  Both silly. It's scandalous! It ought to be stopped!"  Now Pri=
am had resolved that=20

evening to make a serious, gallant attempt to convince his wife of his own =
identity. He was=20

approaching the critical point. This speech of hers intimidated him, rather=
 complicated his=20

difficulties, but he determined to proceed bravely.  "Have you put sugar in=
 this?" he asked.  "Yes,"=20

she said. "But you've forgotten to stir it. I'll stir it for you."  A charm=
ing wifely attention! It=20

enheartened him.  "I say, Alice," he said, as she stirred, "you remember wh=
en first I told you I=20

could paint?"  "Yes," she said.  "Well, at first you thought I was daft. Yo=
u thought my mind was=20

wandering, didn't you?"  "No," she said, "I only thought you'd got a bee in=
 your bonnet." She=20

smiled demurely.  "Well, I hadn't, had I?"  "Seeing the money you've made, =
I should just say you=20

hadn't," she handsomely admitted. "Where we should be without it I don't kn=
ow."  "You were=20

wrong, weren't you? And I was right?"  "Of course," she beamed.  "And do yo=
u remember that time=20

I told you I was really Priam Farll?"  She nodded, reluctantly.  "You thoug=
ht I was absolutely mad.=20

Oh, you needn't deny it! I could see well=20


_
people at Forest Lodge during the summer, when the Chicago fishermen, heade=
d by the wealthy=20

Camerons, were there for three months.  Lee was in Mr. Cameron's special em=
ploy, and from him=20

had learned the art of bait-casting. At the close of the  "I thought you we=
ren't quite well," she said=20

frankly.  "But I was, my child. Now I've got to tell you again that I am Pr=
iam Farll. Honestly I wish I=20

wasn't, but I am. The deuce of it is that that fellow that came here this m=
orning has found it out,=20
