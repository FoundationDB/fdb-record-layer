Bible. "It is in vain," added he, "to say there is danger in it. The best s=
laves of the State are those=20

who can and do read the Scriptures. Again, who is it that teaches your slav=
es to read? It is=20

generally done by the children of the owners. Who would tolerate an indictm=
ent against his son or=20

daughter   And while I yet spoke _the men were_ within.    They did not app=
ear to wish to intrude;=20

They did not attempt to frighten me now;   They did not push by me; they we=
re not rude;--   But=20

_somehow_ they enter'd--I know not how.    'It's no use trying to 'ide 'im,=
 my dear,'   Said one, in a=20

really=20


_
look to me as rather cowardly."[2] This attorney was almost of the opinion =
of many others who=20

believed that the argument that to Christianize and educate the colored peo=
ple of a slave=20

commonwealth had a tendency to elevate them above their masters and to dest=
roy the "legitimate=20

distinctions" of the community, could be admitted only where the people the=
mselves were=20

degraded.  [Footnote 1: DeBow, _The Industrial Resources of the Southern an=
d Western States_,=20

vol. ii., p. 269.]  [Footnote 2: DeBow, _The Industrial Resources of the So=
uthern and Western=20

States_, vol. ii., p. 279.]  After these laws had been passed, American sla=
very extended not as that=20

of the ancients, only to the body, but also to the mind. Education was ther=
eafter regarded as=20

positively inconsistent with the institution. The precaution taken to preve=
nt the dissemination of=20

information was declared indispensable to the system. The situation in many=
 parts of the South=20

was just as Berry portrayed it in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1832. =
He said: "We have as far=20

as possible closed every avenue by which light may enter their [the slaves'=
] minds. If we could=20

extinguish the capacity to see the light, our work would be completed; they=
 would then be on a=20

level with the beasts of the field and we should be safe! I am not certain =
that we would not do it, if=20

we could find out the process, and   'In course we knows that the gen'leman=
's 'ere;   And till he=20

turns up we shall 'ave to stay.'    'The gentleman's here? but no one has c=
ome;   And no one=20

_can_ come--it is much too late.   Mr. Vane is out--he will soon be home;  =
 But I really must ask=20

you not to wait.'    The man laid a finger against his nose;   With a horri=
ble slyness look'd at me:=20

'We understands all that 'ere, I suppose;   But you'd _better_ come to term=
s,' said he.    I stared at=20

the man with my vacant eyes,   That dreamily question'd him how he dared?  =
 And suddenly saw,=20

with extreme surprise,   It was a policeman at whom I stared.       The fiv=
e of us stood in the=20

pleasant hall;   And four were policemen, and one was I;   And Harry had ne=
ver come home at all;=20

And the clock struck one with a gasping sigh.    My heart grew cold, and my=
 courage ran down;   I=20

pinch'd my finger--I tried _not_ to scream--   I felt like a creature about=
 to drown,   And I cried=20

aloud 'It MUST be a dream!'   I angrily spoke,--and I spoke out loud;   I _=
knew_ 'twas a dream and=20

nothing in it;   I spurn'd the dream with a gesture proud,   And ORDERED my=
self to wake that=20

minute.    Of course, I just fell asleep where I sat,   And this is a dream=
--yes I know it is--   But O it=20

is stranger than dreaming, that   Harry has not waken'd me with a kiss!    =
I looked at the men, who=20

are searching round,   And=20


_
necessity."[1]  [Footnote 1: Coffin, _Slave Insurrections_, p. 23; and Good=
ell, _Slave Code_, p.=20

323.]  It had then come to pass that in the South, where once were found a =
considerable number=20

of intelligent Negroes, they had become exceedingly scarce or disappeared f=
rom certain sections=20

altogether. On plantations of hundreds of slaves it was common to discover =
that not one of them=20

had the mere rudiments of education. In some large districts it was conside=
red almost a=20

phenomenon to find a Negro who could read the Bible or sign his name.[1]  [=
Footnote 1:_Ibid._,=20

pp. 323-324.]  The reactionary tendency was in no sense confined to the Sou=
thern States. Laws=20

were passed in the North to prevent the migration of Negroes to that sectio=
n. Their education at=20

certain places was discouraged. In fact, in the proportion that the conditi=
ons in the South made it=20

necessary for free blacks to flee from oppression, the people of the North =
grew less tolerant on=20

account of the large number of those who crowded the towns and cities of th=
e free States near the=20

border. The antislavery societies at one time found it necessary to devote =
their time to the=20

amelioration of the economic condition of the refugees   Examining ceiling =
and walls and ground,--=20

--I am surely going out of my mind!    I said to myself in a coaxing way-- =
  'I am wide awake, and=20

he _has_ come back;   Harry is acting a sort of a play:   He has dress'd hi=
mself up, and so has=20

Jack.'    A glance or a signal dispers'd the men:   Two went upstairs, and =
another below;   The=20

leader sat down in the hall; and then--   What am _I_ to do? Where am _I_ t=
o go?    I rush'd to the=20

door, and I flung it wide--   A frighten'd creature can anything dare--   A=
nd I saw the darkness that=20

lay outside,   And I heard the silence--and nothing was there.    'Harry! H=
arry! Harry!' was all my=20

cry,   As I stood alone at the open door;   And the night heard me--and so =
did the sky,   And the=20

wind and the earth--and nothing more.    I turn'd from the door with a sad =
surprise:   I could call for=20

my love and call in vain;   And I met that horrid policeman's eyes,   Keenl=
y and quietly watching my=20

pain.    He suddenly called for his men to come;   So they made their appea=
rance one by one,=20

And he said, 'The gen'leman's _not_ been 'ome,   And she 'asn't a notion wh=
at he's done.    And=20

he _won't_ come now, you may swear to that;   I rayther think he'll=20


_
direct their attention to mere education.[1] Not a few northerners, dreadin=
g an influx of free=20

Negroes, drove them even from communities to which they had learned to, rep=
air for education.=20

[Footnote 1: _Proceedings of the American Convention_.]  The best example o=
f this intolerance=20

was the opposition   I rayther suspect we've been rayther flat,   And the g=
en'leman's given us the=20

slip!'    With a regular march they trod the ground,   Suddenly left me alo=
ne in the hall;   In the=20

dreadful silence that settled round,   Again I _knew_ I was dreaming it all=
?       A voice that can=20

banish my sleep I know;=20


_
by Prudence Crandall, a well-educated young Quaker lady, who had establishe=
d a boarding-

school at Canterbury, Connecticut. Trouble arose when Sarah Harris, a color=
ed girl, asked=20

admission to this institution.[1] For many reasons Miss Crandall hesitated =
to admit her but finally=20

yielded. Only a few days   I know a voice that could wake me if dead;   A l=
oud cheery voice, but it=20

might speak low,   And 'May, little May,' it whispering said.    I stand li=
ke a statue of silence. Hush!=20

I listen not with my ears, but my soul;   And I feel the sudden accustom'd =
blush,   As again the=20

whisper reaches its=20


_
white girls called on Miss Crandall to offer their objections to sending th=
eir children to school with a=20

"nigger."[2] Miss Crandall stood firm, the white girls withdrew, and the te=
acher advertised for=20

young women of color. The determination to continue the school on this basi=
s incited the=20

townsmen to hold an indignation meeting. They passed resolutions to protest=
 through a committee=20

of local officials against the establishment of a school of this kind in th=
at community. At this=20

meeting Andrew T. Judson denounced the policy of Miss Crandall, while the R=
ev. Samuel J. May=20

ably defended it. Judson was not only opposed to the establishment of such =
a school in=20

Canterbury but in any    I open the window. 'Mid blossom and bough   Of clu=
stering laurel and=20

Daphne white,   I am showering kisses on Harry's brow,   And dropping the f=
irst tears I've shed to-

night.    His face is as white as the Daphne-bud;   He is hiding down on th=
e hidden sward;   He is=20

wan and haggard, and splashed with mud;   He is crouching frighten'd--my ki=
