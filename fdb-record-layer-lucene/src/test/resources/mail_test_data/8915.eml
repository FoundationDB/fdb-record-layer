beginning of the repast was too long delayed.  To prevent her climbing, she=
 was secured by a=20

slight chain. This she soon managed to break, and once having performed the=
 operation, she did=20

not fail to attempt it again. To do this, she would first draw herself back=
 as far as she could get,=20

and then suddenly dart forward, in the hope of snapping it by the jerk; and=
 though she was thus=20

sent reeling on the floor, she would again pick herself up, panting as if h=
er little heart would break,=20

shake out her disarranged coat, and try once more. When observed, however, =
she would sit=20

quietly down, cock her head cunningly on one side, follow the chain with he=
r eye along its whole=20

length to its fastening on the floor, walk leisurely to that point, hesitat=
ing a moment, and then make=20

another plunge. All this time she would eye her master sharply, and if he m=
oved, she would fall=20

down on the floor at once, and pretend to be asleep.  She was a very neat a=
nd cleanly creature,=20

everlastingly brushing her clothes, and bathing regularly in a bath of snow=
 provided for her in the=20

cabin. This last operation was her great delight. She would throw up the wh=
ite flakes with her=20

diminutive nose, rolling about and burying herself in them, wipe her face w=
ith her soft paws, and=20

then mount to the side of the tub, looking round her knowingly, and barking=
 the prettiest bark that=20

ever was heard. This was her way of enforcing admiration; and being now sat=
isfied with her=20

performance, she would give a goodly number of shakes to her sparkling coat=
, then, happy and=20

refreshed, crawl into her airy bed in the bull's-eye, and go to sleep.   Th=

human beings. Though most species are savage when irritated, some of them o=
ccasionally exhibit=20

good humour and kindness.  A story is told of a man in Russia, who on an ex=
pedition in search of=20

honey, climbed into a high tree. The trunk was hollow, and he discovered a =
large cone within. He=20

was descending to obtain it, when he stuck fast. Unable to extricate himsel=
f, and too far from=20

home to make his voice heard, he remained in that uncomfortable position fo=
r two days, sustaining=20

his life by eating the honey. He had become silent from despair, when, look=
ing up, what was his=20

horror to see a huge bear above him, tempted by the same object which had l=
ed him into his=20

dangerous predicament, and about to descend into the interior of the tree! =
 Bears--very wisely--

when getting into hollows of rocks or trees, go tail-end first, that they m=
ay be in a position to move=20

out again when necessary. No sooner, in spite of his dismay, did the tail o=
f the bear reach him,=20

than the man caught hold of it. The animal, astonished at finding some big =
creature below him,=20

when he only expected to meet with a family of bees, against whose stings h=
is thick hide was=20

impervious, quickly scrambled out again, dragging up the man, who probably =
shouted right lustily.=20

Be that as it may, the bear waddled off at a quick rate, and the honey-seek=
er made his way=20

homeward, to relate his adventure, and relieve the anxiety of his family.  =
 The brown bear, which=20

lives in Siberia, may be considered among the most good-natured of his trib=
e. Mr. Atkinson, who=20

travelled in that country, tells us that some peasants--a father and mother=
--had one day lost two of=20

their children, between four and six years of age. It was soon evident that=
 their young ones had=20

wandered away to a distance from their home, and as soon as this discovery =
was made they set=20

off in search of them.  Having proceeded some way through the wilds, they c=
aught sight in the=20

distance of a large animal, which, as they got nearer, they discovered to b=
e a brown bear; and=20

what was their horror to see within its clutches their lost young ones! The=
ir sensations of dismay=20

were exchanged for astonishment, when they saw the children running about, =
laughing, round the=20

bear, sometimes taking it by the paws, and sometimes pulling it by the tail=
. The monster, evidently=20

amused with their behaviour, treated them in the most affectionate manner. =
One of the children=20

now produced some fruit, with which it fed its shaggy playfellow, while the=
 other climbed up on its=20

back, and sat there, fearlessly urging its strange steed to move on. The pa=
rents gave way to cries=20

of terror at seeing the apparent danger to which their offspring were expos=
ed. The little boy,=20

however, having slipped off the bear's back, the animal, hearing the sound =
of other voices, left the=20

children, and retreated quietly into the forest.     SOME ANIMAL FRIENDS IN=
 AFRICA  By Bayard=20

Taylor   Years ago I spent a winter in Africa. I had intended to go up the =
Nile only as far as Nubia,=20

visiting the great temples and tombs of Thebes on the way; but when I had d=
one all this, and=20

passed beyond the cataracts at the southern boundary of Egypt, I found the =
journey so agreeable,=20

so full of interest, and attended with so much less danger than I had suppo=
sed, that I determined=20

to go on for a month or two longer, and penetrate as far as possible into t=
he interior. Everything=20

was favorable to my plan.  When I reached Khartoum, the Austrian consul inv=
ited me to his house;=20

and there I spent three or four weeks, in that strange town, making acquain=
tance with the Egyptian=20

officers, the chiefs of the desert tribes and the former kings of the diffe=
rent countries of Ethiopia.=20

When I left my boat, on arriving, and walked through the narrow streets of =
Khartoum, between=20

mud walls, very few of which were even whitewashed, I thought it a miserabl=
e place, and began to=20
