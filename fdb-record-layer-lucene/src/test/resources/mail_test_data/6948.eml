"But why not give it to me?" asked Jeremiah, in great excitement. "I could make everything right--

everything--everything...." His voice trailed off into a whimper.  "Why don't I give it to you?" said 

Captain Ablewhite, very calmly. "Because I am beginning to lose my opinion of you. Let me tell 

you, though: you may justify it yet if you are not thoroughly white-livered."  "I will, I will!" exclaimed 

Jeremiah. "Only give me the tip--give me the tip!"  "Not if I know it. This little affair I will keep to 

myself, and I'll sweep the market. You've let too many good things slip by this week. Come, now, 

confess: if you had stuck to your 'system,' how much would you have won? Don't put me off. 

You've gone all through it, and you know the figures to the fraction of a shilling."  Jeremiah struck 

his forehead with his hand. "I should have won seven thousand pounds."  "Exactly. And you did 

not win it because you weren't game, and because you allowed

up for store distribution.  BRAN.--Quoted at $15@12 25 per ton;  has the courage of his opinions? 

Before midnight I'm going to try you; I'm going to see whether you're worth trying to save (because 

you are in a frightful hole, you know, and there's no telling what will happen to you if you continue 

to show the white feather), or whether I shall let you go to the dogs. It depends upon me, old chap. 

Oppose me, show ingratitude, try to prove that you're cleverer than I am, and the odds are that 

you will have seven years--not

made fortunes. But that's neither here nor there. Things are as they are, aren't they?"  "Yes, they 

are," sighed Jeremiah.  "Shall I go on?"  "Yes."  "Well, then. You brought down two thousand
