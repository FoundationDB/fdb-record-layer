inquired Sophy.  "I'll tell=20

Benoni looked mortified and distressed. "You told me to sell the things for=

had earned as much to-day as you and she have, my boy."  Benoni looked grat=
efully at his father,=20

but the cloud did not pass from the brow of Sophy. What hopes she had built=
 on that basket of=20

work! How she had counted on the proceeds of its sale, not only to supply p=
resent need, but to=20

buy materials for future labors! She had probably over-estimated the value =
of her little store as=20

much as Benoni had done the contrary, and now all that it had been sold for=
 would be consumed=20

in two or three meals, and nothing be left with which she might start afres=
