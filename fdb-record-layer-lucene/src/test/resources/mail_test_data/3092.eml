 at Newport. In the year 1828 a separate school for colored children was es=

to the problems which at times confronted the benevolent people of Pennsylv=
ania. Great as had=20

been the reaction, the Negroes of New Jersey never entirely lost the privil=
ege of attending school=20

with white students. The New Jersey Constitution of 1844 provided that the =
funds for the support=20

of the public schools should be applied for the equal benefit of all the pe=
ople of that State.[1]=20

Considered then entitled to the benefits of this fund, colored pupils were =
early admitted into the=20

public schools without any social distinction.[2] This does not mean that t=
here were no colored=20

schools in that commonwealth. Negroes in a few settlements like that of Spr=
ingtown had their own=20

schools.[3] Separate schools were declared illegal by an act of the General=
 Assembly in 1881.=20

[Footnote 1: Thorpe, _Federal and State Constitutions_, vol. v., p. 2604.] =
 [Footnote 2: _Southern=20

Workman_, vol. xxxvii., p. 390.]  [Footnote 3: _Special Report of the U.S. =
Com. of Ed_., 1871, p.=20

400.]  Certain communities of New York provided separate schools for colore=
d pupils rather than=20

admit them to those open to white children. On recommendation of the superi=
ntendent of schools=20

in 1823 the State adopted the policy of organizing schools exclusively for =
colored people.[1] In=20

places where they already existed, the State could aid the establishment as=
 did the New York=20

Common Council in 1824, when it appropriated a portion of its fund to the s=
upport of the African=20

Free Schools.[2] In 1841 the New York legislature authorized any district, =
with the approbation of=20

the school commissioners, to establish a separate school for the colored ch=
ildren in their locality.=20

The superintendent's report for 1847 shows that schools for Negroes had bee=
n established in=20

fifteen counties in the State, reporting an enrollment of 5000 pupils. For =
the maintenance of these=20

schools the sum of $17,000 had been annually expended. Colored pupils were =
enumerated by the=20

trustees in their annual reports, drew public money for the district in whi=
ch they resided, and were=20

equally entitled with white children to the benefit of the school fund. In =
the rural districts colored=20

children were generally admitted to the common schools. Wherever race preju=
dice, however, was=20

sufficiently violent to exclude them from the village school, the trustees =
were empowered to use=20

the Negroes' share of the public money to provide for their education elsew=
here. At the same time=20

indigent Negroes were to be exempted from the payment of the "rate bill" wh=
ich fell as a charge=20

upon the other citizens of the district.[3]  [Footnote 1: Randall, _Hist. o=
f Common School System of=20

New York_, p. 24.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 48.]  [Footnote 3: Randall, _H=
ist. of Common School=20

System of New York_, p. 248.]  Some trouble had arisen from making special =
appropriations for=20

incorporated villages. Such appropriations, the superintendent had observed=
, excited prejudice=20

and parsimony; for the trustees of some villages had learned to expend only=
 the special=20

appropriations for the education of the colored pupils, and to use the publ=
ic money in establishing=20

and maintaining schools for the white children. He believed that it was wro=
ng to argue that=20

Negroes were any more a burden to incorporated villages than to cities or r=
ural districts, and that=20

they were, therefore, entitled to every allowance of money to educate them.=
[1]  [Footnote 1:=20

Randall, _Hist. of Common School System of New York_, p. 249.]  In New York=
 City much had=20

already been done to enlighten the Negroes through the schools of the Manum=
ission Society. But=20

as the increasing population of color necessitated additional facilities, t=
he Manumission Society=20

obtained from the fund of call aloud that the object of this appeal may be =
received by our loyal=20

subjects as a sacred decree. May the filial ardour spread itself from Mosco=
w to the extremities of=20

our dominions; and a force will then assemble around the monarch that may d=
efy the thousand=20

legions of our treacherous invader. The ills which he has prepared for us w=
ill then fall upon his=20



own head, and Europe, delivered from slavery, may then celebrate the name o=
f--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAlexander!=E2=80=9D=20

The words sprang from the lips of Feodor Petrovitch, the youngest there, wh=
o spoke aloud the=20

thought that thrilled in every heart, and knew not that he spoke until he c=
aught the reproving looks=20

of some of those around him. In the meantime Count Rostopchine calmly compl=
eted the sentence=20

as it had been written--=E2=80=9CEurope, delivered from slavery, may then c=
elebrate the name of RUSSIA.=E2=80=9D=20

Scarcely had he concluded, when the Czar himself stood amongst them, and wi=
th a few eloquent=20

words wound up to its highest pitch the enthusiasm of the audience. Amidst =
the tears and=20

acclamations which followed, the venerable chief of the merchants[20] stood=
 up in his place and=20

subscribed his name for the gift of fifty thousand roubles--two-thirds of h=
is fortune. Others gave in=20

similar proportion; and Petrovitch was surpassed by none in self-sacrificin=
g liberality. Feodor,=20

under his directions, wrote his name upon the list of subscribers. When he =
had done so, he turned=20

to his grandfather--=E2=80=9CD=C3=A4dushka, I think you must give the Czar =
something more even yet.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEven=20

sons and grandsons?=E2=80=9D said the old man, with a smile that had in it =
a little sadness and a great deal=20

of resignation; =E2=80=9Cwell, I shall not refuse.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_Even=
 me?_=E2=80=9D said Feodor, nestling close to him and=20

putting his arm caressingly about his neck. But Petrovitch did not answer. =
 =E2=80=9CThe people were=20

willing,=E2=80=9D even beyond their power, so that three days afterwards th=
e Czar published a ukase, not to=20

ask for gifts, but to limit their amount. =E2=80=9CThe nobles literally gav=
e him Russia,=E2=80=9D wrote the Sardinian=20

ambassador to his sovereign. =E2=80=9CThey melted into tears; in short, sir=
e, there never was anything like=20

it. The merchants have given him ten million roubles, and lent him fifty or=
 sixty million.=E2=80=9D  But the=20

mass of the people--peasants, mujiks, serfs, who tilled the soil--what part=
 had they in this splendid=20

outburst of loyal and patriotic enthusiasm? Napoleon expected that these =
=E2=80=9Coppressed and=20

degraded slaves=E2=80=9D would hail him as a deliverer--would rise everywhe=
re in revolt, and massacre=20

their tyrants. Very different was the fact. When the time came for the serf=
s voted by the nobles to=20

be levied from their estates, and when the vast crown lands had also to con=
tribute their proportion=20

of recruits, there was weeping and wailing in the izbas of every village fr=
om the Neva to the=20

steppes of Tartary. But it was not, as in other days, the conscript who mou=
rned his hard lot, and=20

his mother, his sister, his betrothed who made sore lamentation over a sepa=
ration probably life-

long. It was the one _not_ chosen who mingled his tears with those of his f=
riends and parents,=20

because he might not go and shed his blood for the Czar and holy Russia. Gl=
ad was the young=20

recruit as he donned his simple uniform--a gray caftan, with loose trousers=
 and a crimson sash;=20

and proudly did he wear on the front of his gray cap the imperial badge, =
=E2=80=9Ca brazen cross=20

surmounting a crown over the letter _A_.=E2=80=9D First and highest the cro=
ss, symbol of the Christian faith;=20

beneath that, the imperial crown of Russia; again beneath that--Alexander. =
 But although putting=20

himself, as he was wont to do, in the lowest place, and when possible out o=
f sight altogether, the=20

strong personal love with which Alexander had=20


_
Society partial support of its system. The next step was to unite the Afric=
an Free Schools with=20

those of the Public School Society to reduce the number of organizations pa=
rticipating in the=20

support of Negro education. Despite the argument of some that the two syste=
ms should be kept=20

separate, the property and schools of the Manumission Society were transfer=
red to the New York=20

Public School Society in 1834.[2] Thereafter the schools did not do as well=
 as they had done=20

before. The administrative part of the work almost ceased, the schools lost=
 in efficiency, and the=20

former attendance of 1400 startlingly dropped. An investigation made in 183=
5 showed that many=20

Negroes, intimidated by frequent race riots incident to the reactionary mov=
ement, had left the city,=20

while others kept their children at home for safety. It seemed, too, that t=
hey looked upon the new=20

system as an innovation, did not like the action of the Public School Socie=
ty in reducing their=20

schools of advanced grade to that of the primary, and bore it grievously th=
at so many of the old=20

teachers in whom they had confidence, had been dropped. To bring order out =
of chaos the=20

investigating committee advised the assimilation of the separate schools to=
 the white. Thereupon=20

the society undertook to remake the colored schools, organizing them into a=
 system which offered=20

instruction in primary, intermediate, and grammar departments. The task of =
reconstruction,=20

however, was not completed until 1853, when the property of the colored sch=
ools was transferred=20

to the Board of Education of New York.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Special Report of =
the U.S. Com. of Ed_.,=20

1871, p. 366.]  [Footnote 2: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed_., 1871=
, p. 366.]  The second=20

transfer marked an epoch in the development of Negro education in New York.=
 The Board of=20

Education proceeded immediately to perfect the system begun at the time of =
the first change. The=20

new directors reclassified the lower grades, opened other grammar schools, =
and established a=20

normal school according to the recommendation of the investigating committe=
e of 1835.=20

Supervision being more rigid thereafter, the schools made some progress, bu=
t failed to accomplish=20

what was expected of them. They were carelessly intrusted for supervision t=
o the care of ward=20

officers, some of whom partly neglected this duty, while in that hour of a =
nation=E2=80=99s conflict and=20

agony, than the traditional religious veneration of the Russian for his cou=
ntry and his Czar. Well=20

was it for Russia, and for Europe also, that the Czar God had given her was=
 Alexander Paulovitch.=20

It was not only that he had been, since the beginning of his reign, =E2=80=
=9Cperfectly just as emperor,=20

singularly generous as man;=E2=80=9D[21] not only that he was richly endowe=
d with all those brilliant and=20

fascinating qualities which take the eye and win the suffrage of the multit=
ude. The secret of his=20

influence lay deeper. God had given him a gift more precious still. He had =
touched his heart with=20

=E2=80=9Cthe enthusiasm of humanity.=E2=80=9D This autocrat of fifty millio=
ns =E2=80=9Cloved his brother whom he had seen,=E2=80=9D=20

n.=E2=80=9D The hand that toiled so=20

hard to bring back the perishing mujik from his death-like swoon was well u=
sed to deeds of=20

beneficence. Of these a hundred stories might be told: at that time they _w=
ere_ told, not only in=20

the salons of St. Petersburg, but beside the stove in the izbas of many a c=
ountry village.=20

Everywhere the mujiks said, =E2=80=9COur lord the Czar loves us.=E2=80=9D A=
nd everywhere, as long as the world=20

lasts, love will win love.     CHAPTER IX.  CLEMENCE.    =E2=80=9CVive, viv=
e le Roi!   A bas la=20

R=C3=A9publique!=E2=80=9D--_Vend=C3=A9an War-Song._   It is the fair and pl=
easant land of France--a land of corn-

fields and orchards and sunny garden-plots, where quiet villages nestle in =
shady nooks, and old=20

ch=C3=A2teaux stand proudly amidst their sheltering woods. You feel everywh=
ere that this land has been=20

for many a century tilled and cared for by the hand of man; that generation=
 after generation sleeps=20



in peace beneath the shadow of its gray old churches. Long ages of toil and=
 civilization have left=20

their impress here, and the present is the heir of a glorious and venerable=
 past.  Yet, perhaps no=20

country has ever suffered more. War after war has swept over it; cruel oppr=
ession made the=20

Revolution a terrible necessity; and, again, the excesses of the Revolution=
 made men forget the=20

crimes of the despotism that engendered it. And in the days of which we wri=
te there brooded over=20

all the portentous shadow of another despotism--almost crushing enough to r=
ecall the worst days=20

of Louis, falsely called the Magnificent, and of his thrice-accursed succes=
sor.=20


_
It was unfortunate, too, that some of these schools were situated in parts =
of the city where the=20

people were not interested in the uplift of the despised race, and in a few=
 cases in wards which=20

were almost proslavery. Better results followed after the colored schools w=
ere brought under the=20

direct supervision of the Board of Education.  Before the close of the Civi=
l War the sentiment of the=20

people of the State of New York had changed sufficiently to permit colored =
children to attend the=20

regular public schools in several communities. This, however, was not gener=
al. It was, therefore,=20

provided in the revised code of that State in 1864 that the board of educat=
ion of any city or=20

incorporated village might establish separate schools for children and yout=
h of African descent=20

provided such schools be supported in the same manner as those maintained f=
or white children.=20

The last vestige of caste in the public schools of New York was not extermi=
nated until 1900, in the=20

administration of Theodore Roosevelt as Governor of New York. The legislatu=
re then passed an=20

act providing that no one should be denied admittance to any public school =
on account of race,=20

hidden in the hollow of His hand, so quietly did it slumber throughout all-=
-escaping not indeed=20

occasional suffering, but anything like general ruin.  One such nook--a lit=
tle pastoral village not a=20

hundred miles from Paris--had in its immediate neighbourhood a spot yet mor=
e secluded, where a=20

noble family of the =E2=80=9Cold _r=C3=A9gime_=E2=80=9D who otherwise might=
 have wandered homeless exiles from their=20

native land, found a welcome refuge. The simple four-roomed cottage, with t=
he vine trained over=20

its tiny porch, would have been an unpretending dwelling for the village sm=
ith or carpenter. Yet few=20

could have looked on it attentively, even from the outside, and none could =
have entered it, without=20

feeling sure that its inmates inherited the traditions of centuries of refi=
nement and cultivation.  The=20

morning sun of one of the earliest days of 1812 was streaming into the litt=
le porch. The weather=20

was mild and beautiful--unusually so for the season. One person was enjoyin=
g it thoroughly--a lad=20

of about seventeen, who reclined in the porch, intent upon a book, while th=
e sunshine streamed=20

brightly over him, and the breeze gently lifted his soft brown hair. The ex=
pression=20
