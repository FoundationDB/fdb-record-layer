void the remaining of the thirteenth century being the period of their grea=

and obvious jests sufficed to raise a laugh among folk disposed to good hum=
our; by degrees=20

something of art and skill was attained. The misfortunes of husbands suppli=
ed an inexhaustible=20

store of merriment; if woman and the love of woman were idealised in the ro=
mances, the fabliaux=20

took their revenge, and exhibited her as the pretty traitress of a shameles=
s comedy. If religion was=20

honoured in the age of faith, the bourgeois spirit found matter of mirth in=
 the adventures of=20

dissolute priests and self-indulgent monks. Not a few of the fabliaux are c=
ynically gross--ribald but=20

not voluptuous. To literary distinction they made small pretence. It suffic=
ed if the tale ran easily in=20

the current speech, thrown into rhyming octosyllables; but brevity, frankne=
ss, natural movement=20

are no slight or common merits in mediaeval poetry, and something of the so=
cial life of the time is=20

mirrored in these humorous narratives.  To regard them as a satire of class=
 against class, inspired=20

by indignation, is to misconceive their true character; they are rather min=
iature comedies or=20

caricatures, in which every class in turn provides material for mirth. It m=
ay, however, be said that=20

with the writers of the fabliaux to hold woman in scorn is almost an articl=
e of faith. Among these=20

writers a few persons of secular rank or dignified churchmen occasionally a=
ppeared; but what we=20

may call the professional rhymers and reciters were the humbler jongleurs a=
ddressing a bourgeois=20

audience--degraded clerics, unfrocked monks, wandering students, who led a =
bohemian life of=20

gaiety alternating with misery. In the early part of the fourteenth century=
 these errant jongleurs=20

ceased to be esteemed; the great lord attached a minstrel to his household,=
 and poetry grew more=20

dignified, more elaborate in its forms, more edifying in its intention, and=
 in its dignity grew too often=20

dull. Still for a time fabliaux were written; but the age of the jongleurs =
was over. _Virelais_,=20

_rondeaux_, _ballades_, _chants royaux_ were the newer fashion; and the old=
 versified tale of=20

mirth and ribaldry was by the middle of the century a thing of the past.   =
IV THE ROMANCE OF=20

THE ROSE  The most extraordinary production in verse of the thirteenth cent=
ury is undoubtedly=20

_Le Roman de la Rose_. It is indeed no single achievement, but two very rem=
arkable poems,=20

written at two different periods, by two authors whose characters and gifts=
 were not only alien, but=20

opposed--two poems which reflect two different conditions of society. Of it=
s twenty-two thousand=20

octosyllabic lines, upwards of four thousand are the work of GUILLAUME DE L=
ORRIS; the=20

remainder is the work of a later writer, JEAN DE MEUN.  Lorris is a little =
town situated between=20

Orleans and Montargis. Here, about the year 1200, the earlier poet was born=
. He was a scholar, at=20

least as far as knowledge of Latin extends, and learned above all in the lo=
re of love. He died=20

young, probably before 1230, and during the five years that preceded his de=
ath the first part of _Le=20

Roman de la Rose_ was composed. Its subject is an allegorised tale of love,=
 his own or imagined,=20

transferred to the realm of dreams. The writer would fain win the heart of =
his beloved, and at the=20

same time he would instruct all amorous spirits in the art of love. He is t=
wenty years of age, in the=20

May-morn of youth. He has beheld his beautiful lady, and been charmed by he=
r fairness, her=20

grace, her courtesy; she has received him with gentleness, but when he decl=
ares his love she=20

grows alarmed. He gains at last the kiss which tells of her affection; but =
her parents intervening,=20

throw obstacles between the lovers. Such, divested of ornament, allegory, a=
nd personification, is=20

rose in the garden of=20

delight is to win the maiden; her fears, her virgin modesty and pride, her =
kindness, her pity, are the=20

company of friends or foes by whom the rose is surrounded; and to harmonise=
 the real and the=20

ideal, all the incidents are placed in the setting of a dream. Wandering on=
e spring morning by the=20

river-banks, the dreamer finds himself outside the walls of a fair orchard,=
 owned by Deduit=20

(Pleasure), of which the portress is Oiseuse (Idleness); on the walls are p=
ainted figures of Hatred,=20

Envy, Sadness, Old Age, Poverty, and other evil powers; but unterrified by =
these, he enters, and=20

finds a company of dancers on the turf, among whom is Beauty, led by the go=
d of Love.=20

Surrounded by a thorny hedge is the rosebud on which all his desire now cen=
tres. He is wounded=20

by the arrows of Love, does homage to the god, and learns his commandments =
and the evils and=20

the gains of love. Invited by Bel-Accueil, the son of Courtoisie, to approa=
ch the rose, he is driven=20

back by Danger and his companions, the guardians of the blossom. Raison des=
cends from a=20

ns; at length the lover is=20

kiss. But Jealousy raises an unscalable wall around the rose; the serviceab=

Lorris ever complete his poem, or did he die while it was still but half co=
mposed? We may=20

conjecture that it wanted little to reach some denouement--perhaps the fulf=
ilment of the lover's=20

hopes; and it is not impossible that a lost fragment actually brought the l=
ove-tale to its issue. But=20
