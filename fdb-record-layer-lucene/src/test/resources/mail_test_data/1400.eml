dracaena marginata foreign intonation; she only felt that sometime in the dim and happy past she had heard this man speak. But even this vague sense of puzzlement she dismissed very quickly from her you.  But when the trial comes on you will see that it cannot be proved against me, Elspie--so keep your mind easy."  With this rather unsatisfactory assurance, Elspie was fain to dracaena marginata foreign intonation; she only felt that sometime in the dim and happy past she had heard this man speak.

carefully closed the door behind her. There was not a sound inside the house: everything was 

silent around her: neither footfall nor whisperings reached her straining ears. She felt about her 

with her hands, she crouched down on her knees: anon she discovered the head of the stairs. 

Then suddenly she drew back, like a frightened hare conscious of danger. All the blood rushed 

back to her heart, making it beat so violently that she once more felt sick and faint. A sound--

gentle as a breath--had broken that absolute and dead silence which up to now had given her 

confidence. She felt suddenly that she was no longer alone in the darkness--that somewhere close 

by there was some one--friend or foe--who was lying in watch for her--that somewhere in the 

darkness something moved and breathed.  The crackling of the paper inside her kerchief served to 

remind her that her dear milor was on the watch and that the blessed message had spoken of a 

friendly hand which would be stretched out to her and which she was enjoined to take with 

confidence. Reassured she crept on again, and anon a softly murmured: "Hush--sh!--sh!--" 

reached her ear. It seemed to come from down below--not very far--and Yvonne, having once 

more located the head of the stairs with her hands, began slowly to creep downstairs--softly as a 

mouse--step by step--but every time that a board creaked she paused, terrified, listening for 

Louise Adet's heavy footstep, for a sound that would mean the near approach of danger.  "Hush--

sh--sh" came again as a gentle murmur from below and the something that moved and breathed 

in the darkness seemed to draw nearer to Yvonne.  A few more seconds of soul-racking 

suspense, a few more steps down the creaking stairs and she felt a strong hand laid upon it?"  "It 

is difficult to say, Elspie dear.  I, too, have heard the rumour that has come to your ears, and I 

have seen--but it is useless talking of our mere conjectures.  I will go at once and ferret out all 

about it if possible.  My first business will be to see Annette and get from her all that she knows. 

Where is Duncan?"  "In the wheat-field.  They have begun to shear to-day, and, as the crop is 

heavy, they will be glad of your help."  Dan went to the field, after visiting Annette Pierre, and lent 

good assistance to the shearers, but, like Elspie, he found that he had not courage to say anything 

to Duncan that would indicate his suspicion.  He longed to put the question straight to him, but 

could not prevail on himself to do so.  Next morning, however, he and Elspie were both saved the 

necessity of doing such violence to their feelings, by the arrival of two men from Fort Garry.  They 

were members of a sort of police force that the Company had enrolled, and had come to arrest 

Duncan McKay junior, on the charge of murder!  There was not much of law in the colony at that 

time, but it was felt that something had to be done in the way of governing a settlement which was 

rapidly increasing, and in which Lynch and mob law would certainly be applied if regularly 

constituted authority did not step in.  As the murder of Perrin had created great indignation among 

the half-breeds, and the feeling about it was increasing, the Company resolved to clear the matter 

up by having the supposed murderer tried.  Duncan was accordingly lodged in one of the bastions 

of Fort Garry, where, when visited by the Governor, he firmly denied his guilt.  The arrest of his 

younger son on such a charge fell very heavily on poor Duncan McKay senior--more heavily

a muffled voice whisper in English:  "All is well! Trust me! Follow me!"  She did not recognise the 

voice, even though there was something vaguely familiar in its intonation. Yvonne did not pause to 

conjecture: she had been made happy by the very sound of the language which stood to her for 

every word of love she had ever heard: it restored her courage and her confidence in their fullest 

measure.  Obeying the whispered command, Yvonne was expected.  It touched not only his 

feelings but his pride; for was he not a lineal descendant of that Fergus McKay who had been a 

chief in one of the Western Isles of Scotland--he could not tell which, but no matter--at that 

celebrated period of Scottish history when the great Norse king, Harold Fairhair, had made a 

descent on the Scottish coast and received one of the few thorough thrashings that darkened his 

otherwise successful career?

mysterious guide who had hold of her hand. The stairs were steep and winding--at a turn she 

perceived a feeble light at their foot down below. Up against this feeble light the form of her guide 

was silhouetted in a broad, dark mass. Yvonne could see nothing of him beyond the square 

outline of his shoulders and that of his sugar-loaf hat. Her mind now was thrilled with excitement 

and her fingers closed almost convulsively round his hand. He led her across Louise Adet's back 

kitchen. It was from here that the feeble light came--from a small oil lamp which stood on the 

centre table. It helped to guide Yvonne and her mysterious friend to the bottom of the stairs, then 

across the kitchen to the front door, where again complete darkness reigned. But soon Yvonne--

who was following blindly whithersoever she was led--heard the click of a latch and the grating of a 

door upon its hinges: a cold current of air caught her straight in the face. She could see nothing, 

for it seemed to be as dark out of doors as in: but she had the sensation of that open door, of a 

threshold to cross, of freedom and happiness beckoning to her straight out of the gloom. Within 

the "O!  Tuncan, Tuncan, my boy!" cried the old man, shoving his hands deeper into his breeches 

pockets, and apostrophising his imprisoned son as he walked up and down in the privacy of his 

own bedroom.  "O that wan o' the name should come to such disgrace!  An' it's denyin' it you will 

be, whether you are guilty or innocent.  O Tuncan, Tuncan! you wass ever notorious for tellin' lies--

an' a troublesome boy all round--whatever."  But when the old man went to Fort Garry and visited 

his son, he stifled his pathetic feelings, and appeared before him with all the offended dignity of an 

injured member of the great clan McKay.  "Are you guilty, Tuncan?" he asked, sternly.  "No, I'm 

innocent," answered the youthful Highlander, with a brow quite as stern and a manner as dignified 

as the old one.  "You will hev to prove that--whatever."  "No--they will hev to prove me guilty," 

retorted the son.  "I wish I could believe ye, Tuncan."  "It iss not of much consequence whether ye 

believe me or not, father. You are not to be my chudge--whatever."  "That is goot luck for you, 

Tuncan, for if I wass your chudge I would be bound to condemn you--you wass always so fond o'

second or two she would be out of this terrible place, its squalid and dank walls would be behind 

her. On ahead in that thrice welcome obscurity her dear milor and his powerful friend were 

beckoning to her to come boldly on--their protecting arms were already stretched out for her; it 

seemed to her excited fancy as if the cold night-wind brought to her ears the echo of their 

endearing words.  She filled her lungs with the keen winter air: hope, happiness, excitement 

thrilled her every nerve.  "A short walk, my lady," whispered the guide, still speaking in English; 

"you are  "It iss true what you say, father.  It iss a chip o' the old block that I am--more's the peety." 

At this point the door of the prison opened, and Elspie was ushered in.  "You here, father!" she 

exclaimed in evident surprise.  "I had hoped to see Duncan alone."  "It iss alone with him you'll 

soon be," replied the Highlander, putting on his hat.  "Goot tay, Tuncan, my boy, an' see that you'll 

be tellin' the truth, if ye can, when ye come to be tried."  To this the youth made no reply.  "O 

Duncan!" said the girl, when her father had retired, "how came they to invent such lies 


_
"No, no, I am not cold," she whispered in reply. "I am conscious of nothing save that I am free." 

"And you are not afraid?"  "Indeed, indeed I am not afraid," she murmured fervently. "May God 

reward you, sir, for what you do."  Again there had been that certain something--vaguely familiar--

in the way the man spoke which for the moment piqued Yvonne's curiosity. She did not, of a  The 

tender way in which this was said, and the gentle touch on his arm, almost overcame the stubborn 

man, but he steeled himself against such influences.  "What can I say, Elspie?" he replied.  "How 

can I tell what iss the reason that people tell lies?"  "But it _is_ lies, isn't it, Duncan?" asked the 

poor girl, almost entreatingly.  "You say that it iss lies--whatever, an' I
