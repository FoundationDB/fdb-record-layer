taking a handful of=20

every colour that it comprised, which was kneaded with various waters; and =
He completely formed=20

it, and breathed into it the soul: so it became an animated sentient being.=
_[192] And He taught=20

Adam the names of all things, _infusing the knowledge of them into his hear=
t_. Then He showed=20

them (_namely, the things_) to the angels, and said, Declare unto me cannot=
 reasonably object, or=20

you will pay me so much." We can well imagine that the impulse of youth wou=
ld suggest surrender=20

of almost any worldly wealth to have "freedom in her love." The romances ar=
e full of incidents akin=20

to this, where the authority of either father or guardian was exerted in va=
in; and the romances,=20

however fantastic in some respects, are but the reflections of actual condi=
tions.  The unmarried=20

woman, whether princess or=20


_
ye say truth _in your assertion that I will not create any more knowing tha=
n ye, and that ye are=20

more worthy of the vicegerency_. They replied, [_We extol_] Thy perfection!=
 We have no=20

knowledge excepting what Thou hast taught us; for Thou art the Knowing, the=
 Wise.--_God_ said,=20

O Adam, tell them their names. And when he had told them their names, _God_=
 said, Did I not say=20

unto you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and know wha=
t ye reveal _of your=20

words, saying, Wilt thou place in it_, etc., and what ye did conceal _of yo=
ur words, saying, He will=20

not create any more generous towards Him than we, nor any more knowing_?   =
  (ii. 28-31.)   We=20

created you; _that is, your father Adam_: then we formed you; _we formed hi=
m, and you in him_:=20

then We said unto the angels, Prostrate yourselves unto Adam, _by way of sa=
lutation_;=20

whereupon they prostrated themselves, except Iblees, _the father of the jin=

 If she did not choose=20

to marry, or if her face or her fortune could not tempt anyone to ask her i=
n marriage, she might=20

enter a monastery. Indeed, a father unwilling or unable to provide a suitab=
le dower for her might=20

force her to become a nun. The eldest son must be provided for first. If th=
e patrimony were small=20

and the family large, younger sons had to fend for themselves, and daughter=
s had to take what=20

they could get. The convent was the cheapest and the safest place in which =
to establish them.=20

Yet in the age of feudalism there were certain safeguards for women, whethe=

altogether of feudal origin or merely survivals of homely, common-sense cus=

examples, we find in the _Assises de Jerusalem_ most stringent provisions f=
or the punishment of=20

seduction or crimes of violence against women. The statute provides that th=

able to do so and is approved by the parents, shall=20
