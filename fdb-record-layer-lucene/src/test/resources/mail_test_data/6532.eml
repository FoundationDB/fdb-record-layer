I'm Sarah Ann--then I know I'm in for a scolding. Oh yes, Miss Primrose, London is not what we 

thought it."  "Never mind," said Primrose sweetly; "you'll always be Poppy to us, dear, and I know 

the tares were not poppies, so don't you fret--the poppy is a sweet flower, and Poppy is a sweet 

name for a girl. Why we four are all called after flowers, and we must just be very friendly, and

"You're real kind, Miss Primrose," said Poppy. "Yes, it's a great ease to me to know as you three 

are in the house. I won't be so lonesome-like now, and I won't be dreaming  "And the way the
