While this siege was going forward, sir Clugnet de Brabant, admiral of France, put to sea with 

twenty-two ships full of men at arms, to oppose the english fleet, which was also at sea in great 

force. The two fleets met, and had a sharp skirmish, in which many were killed and wounded on 

both sides; but nothing more was done, and they separated. The French, however, lost one of 

their ships, in which were Lionnet de Braquemont, Agieux de St Martin, and several more, 

attached to the duke of Orleans, who were carried by the English to Bordeaux.  The other 

Frenchmen, namely, sir Clugnet de Brabant, sir William de Villanes, governor of difference could 

be perceived between the impressions. The forms of the spirals remained the same, not only in 

general character, but in minute and measurable details, as in the distances from the centre of the 

spiral and in the direction at which each new ridge took its rise. Sir William Herschel has made 

great use of digit-marks for the purposes of legal attestation among natives of India.[595] The 

extraordinary persistence of the papillary ridges on the inner surface of the hands throughout life 

has been a theme of discussion by the Royal Society,[596] and Mr. Galton has devised a method 

of indexing finger-marks.[597]  The

returned to Le Bourg, and related to the duke what had passed at sea.  The duke of Orleans, 

having remained in vain about three months at this siege, considered the strength of the place and 

the great mortality in his army, and held a council with his officers, when it was resolved that he 

should march his men at arms back to Paris.  The people of France, and some of the nobility, 

murmured much against him for this retreat, because there had been a very heavy tax 

investigations of justice. In a criminal affair in France, where eight individuals were implicated, 

comparative experiments upon the identity of the foot, made with a view to determine to which of 

the individuals ought to be attributed the bloody footprints found near a wardrobe, it was shown 

that a degree of recognition could be established on reproducing the footprints with defibrinated 

blood. From the eight imprints of the left foot of each individual,
