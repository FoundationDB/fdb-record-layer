an models. The _Petit Jehan de Saintre_ is _
to eat in the house or not?  _Actress._ There's everything, sir.  _Director=
._ Well, what?  _Actress._=20

For instance--there's rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled milk, rice; a=
nd, all together, it makes=20

you a dish fit for heaven. May the gods always be thus gracious to you!  _D=
irector._ All that in our=20

house? or are you joking?  _Actress._ [_Aside._] Yes, I will have my joke. =
[_Aloud._] It's in the=20

market-place, sir.  _Director._ [_Angrily._] You wretched woman, thus shall=
 your own hope be cut=20

off! And death shall find you out! For my expectations, like a scaffolding,=
 have been raised so high,=20

only to fall again.  _Actress._ Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a =
joke.  _Director._ But what=20

do these unusual preparations mean? One girl is preparing cosmetics, anothe=
r is weaving=20

garlands, and the very ground is adorned with sacrificial flowers of five d=
ifferent colors.  _Actress._=20

This is a fast day, sir.  _Director._ What fast?  _Actress._ The fast for a=
 handsome husband.=20

_Director._ In this world, mistress, or the next?  _Actress._ In the next w=
orld, sir.  _Director._=20

[_Wrathfully._] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing my food to get =
herself a husband in the=20

next world.  _Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that =
you may be my husband=20

in my next birth, too.  _Director._ But who suggested this fast he yet is a=
 passionate lover of life;=20

and shadowing beauty and youth and love and life, he is constantly aware of=
 the imminent and=20

inexorable tyranny of death. The ideas which he expresses are few and simpl=
e--ideas common to=20

all men; but they take a special colour from his own feelings and experienc=
es, and he renders=20

them with a poignancy which is his own, with a melancholy gaiety and a desp=
erate imaginative=20

sincerity. His figure is so interesting in itself--that of the _enfant perd=
u_ of genius--and so typical of=20

a class, that the temptation to create a Villon legend is great; but to mag=
nify his proportions to=20

those of the highest poets is to do him wrong. His passionate intensity wit=
hin a limited range is=20

unsurpassed; but Villon wanted sanity, and he wanted breadth.  In his direc=
t inspiration from life,=20

co-operating with an admirable skill and science in literary form, Villon s=
tands alone. For others--

Georges Chastelain, Meschinot, Molinet, Cretin--poetry was a cumbrous form =
of rhetoric,=20

regulated by the rules of those arts of poetry which during the fifteenth c=
entury appeared at not=20

infrequent intervals. The _grands rhetoriqueurs_ with their complicated mea=
sures, their pedantic=20

diction, their effete allegory, their points and puerilities, testify to th=
e exhaustion of the Middle=20

Ages, and to the need of new creative forces for the=20


_
_Actress._ Your own dear friend Jurnavriddha.  _Director._ [_Angrily._] Ah,=
 Jurnavriddha, son of a=20

slave-wench! When, oh, when shall I see King Palaka angry with you? Then yo=
u will be parted, as=20

surely as the scented hair of some young bride.  P. 8.10]  _Actress._ Don't=
 be angry, sir. It is only=20

that I may have you in the next world that I celebrate this fast. [_She fal=
ls at his feet._]  _Director._=20

Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this fast.  _Actress=
._ Some Brahman of our=20

own sort whom we must literature.  There is life, however, in the work of o=
ne remarkable prose-

writer of the time--ANTOINE DE LA SALLE. His residence in Rome (1422) had m=
ade him=20

acquainted with the tales of the Italian _novellieri_; he was a friend of t=
he learned and witty=20

Poggio; Rene of Anjou entrusted to him the education of his son; when advan=
ced in years he=20

became the author certainly of one masterpiece, probably of three. If he wa=

_Quinze Joies de Mariage_, he knew how to mask a rare power of cynical obse=
rvation under a=20
