*       *       *       *       *  THE PREMIER'S POWER.  _Brief Fragment of a current Historical 

Romance._      [It is whispered that the PRIME MINISTER has of late taken too much     into his 

own hands the conduct of the foreign affairs of the     she had last supped with Louis d'Orleans, 

and who had drawn up the treaty of reconciliation between the houses of Burgundy and Orleans. 

Isabeau might have interceded in his behalf, and did make some move to do so; but a promise 

that her son should share in the confiscated wealth of Montaigu was enough to purchase her 

consent to the latter's death.  Isabeau was at this time busying herself less and less about affairs 

of state; since she had leagued herself in secret 


_
The PRIME MINISTER stood upon the rug, with his back to the fire, and regarded his assembled 

colleagues with an imperious and angry scowl. There was a profound and significant silence for 

several minutes. At length it broke. He was addressing them once more.  "You understand the 

official relationship that exists between us. You are my creatures. I am your Master. What I 

originate, you accept. I act, you endorse. Do I," he continued, his voice rising she had no cares but 

those attendant upon providing pleasures and amusements for herself. Her son, the dauphin, 

following in Isabeau's footsteps, was scandalizing all Paris by his orgies. At last, the people of 

Paris rose in one of their occasional sincere but futile attempts to reform the manners of a corrupt 

court. We shall not deal with the horrors of this outburst, one of the many little wavelets of popular 

indignation presaging, but presaging

treble, "do I make myself sufficiently clear?"  A sickly smile of abject acquiescence overspread the 

features of the now trembling Ministers. Their Chief noted it with a gloomy glare. Then with a 

furious gesture, he suddenly kicked a waste-paper basket into the air. "You may go!" he growled. 

They did not wait for a second permission. Swiftly, but obsequiously, they glided out of the room, 

and with traces of terror stamped on their blanched countenances, silently sought the little 

neighbouring Railway Station, and took the next train to London.         * * *  That night the Premier 

sat up late. But his work, when he began it, did not take him long. Yet it was not unimportant, for 

the departing mail-bag carried a set of sealed orders for the Admiral in Command of the British 

Squadron in East African Waters, another Ultimatum to the Government of Portugal, a threatening 

communication to the Porte, and disturbing despatches, threatening to the peace of Europe, to the 

Governments of Russia, France, and Germany respectively. He laughed long and loud when he 

thought of their contents. Then he went to bed.         * * *  Later on, his work bore fruit; and people 

then said that the Cabinet of the day must have been a strange one!         *       *       *       *       *

180,000 mummified Cats has just been landed at Liverpool, to be used as Manure."--_Daily 

Paper._         *       *       *       *       *  ROBERT'S COMPANIONS.  I'm a beginning for to think as 

we're rayther a rum lot in this werry strawnery world of ours. I've jest bin a collectin from sum of my 

brother Waiters sum of their little great tidal wave that was to envelop and bear down the just and 

the unjust alike some four hundred years later. The butchers and bakers and honest workingmen, 

led chiefly by a surgeon, Jean de Troyes, came by thousands to reform the morals of the dauphin. 

This miserable debauchee, as well as the rest of the court, trembled before them, and willingly 

conceded anything that could be asked. Even the poor mad king, whom the people loved and did 

not blame, had the white hood, emblem of the commune, placed upon his head, and smiled 

pitifully at his rough but well-meaning subjects. Forthwith, Isabeau equipped her head with a white 

hood, and so did all the court, the judges, and even the learned doctors of the University. But 

Isabeau's white hood was not wide enough to cover the scandalous horns of her headdress. 

Rising to the point of fury upon hearing that the dauphin, probably at the instigation of his mother, 

had been in communication with the Orleanist forces to induce them to march upon Paris, the 

Cabochiens, as the communists called themselves, in May, 1413, invaded the palace itself and 

arrested Louis de Baviere, the queen's brother, and as many as fifteen of the ladies of her suite 

probably such as had made themselves peculiarly conspicuous and offensive by the extravagance 

and the indecency of their costumes. Isabeau wept, and pleaded vainly for a respite for her 

brother, then on the eve of his marriage; the stern moralists from the markets of Paris were 

inexorable and Louis went to jail unmarried, while Isabeau went to bed sick with childish fury.  For 

a moment turning our attention from the queen, let us advert to the political conditions in France. 

From the time of the

offen Louis d' Orleans there had been civil war, with rare and brief intervals of peace, between the 

partisans of Burgundy and those of Orleans, now led by Bernard d'Armagnac, whose daughter 

Charles d'Orleans had married after the early death of his first wife, Isabelle de France. While

paid for it, praps jest a leetle bit more. So one day I wentured to arsk him how it was as he was 

allers as sollem as a Churchwarden at a Charity Sermon, or a Clown in summer time, and he told 

me as it was all causd by the suckemstances of his hurly life, which he had never been abel to 

shake off hisself, pore Fellar! tho' they was none of 'em his own fault, which they was as follers.

years after seems to have been either Frydays or Fust of Aprils, sumtimes one, sumtimes war in 

itself would have caused misery and ruin enough, its horrors were enhanced by the crafty policy of 

Henry IV. of England, who, when he was not able to intervene in person, responded to the 

solicitations of first one party and then the other, and thus caused Armagnacs and Bourguignons 

to exhaust themselves in fruitless strife. It was the craft of Henry IV. and the folly of France that 

prepared the way for Agincourt, that crushing victory of the great Henry V., who in the presence of 

the overwhelming French army proclaimed, in Shakespeare's paraphrase of his words: 

"We are enow         To do our country loss; and if to live,         The fewer men, the greater share of 

honor.         God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more!"  The event justified King Harry's 

boastful confidence: the chivalry of France found

unlucky number, and he seemed to have been treeted as if it had bin his own fault, which in 

course it wasn't, not by no means, no more than it was his fault the having the Skarlet Fever on 

one Crismus Day, which he the hour of France's distress, the indolent Isabeau could hardly be 

prevailed upon to take any action in behalf of her son, the dauphin, Louis de Guienne who, in fact, 

lived but a little over two months after Agincourt, and was succeeded by Jean de Touraine. In two 

years more (1417) Jean de Touraine was dead,

prepperashuns customary on such himportant occasions had been dun away with as useless,

Stranger!" So long, too, as his oldest brother d'Armagnac; the new dauphin, Charles, was a boy of 

but fourteen years.  This Charles, one of the most uncomfortably cold and contemptible 

personages in history, had been reared by the queen and the Armagnac party with sentiments of 

the bitterest hatred against the Burgundians. Determined to win complete control of Charles, 

Bernard d'Armagnac sought to discredit Isabeau with her son and with the king. There was no
