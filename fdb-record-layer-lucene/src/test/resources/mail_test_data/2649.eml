d indignation against those whom he regarded as his ill-users, or cries aga=
inst the injuries of fortune, or laments his _
struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a woman. Char=
udatta's friend,=20

Maitreya, enters with the gems which Vasantasena had left to buy Charudatta=
's son a toy cart of=20

gold. These gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and Sa=
nsthanaka. In view of=20

Charudatta's poverty, this seems to establish the motive for the crime, and=
 Charudatta is=20

condemned to death.  ACT X., entitled _The End_. Sixth day.--Two headsmen a=
re conducting=20

Charudatta to the place of execution. Charudatta takes his last leave of hi=
s son and his friend=20

Maitreya. But Sansthanaka's servant escapes from confinement and betrays th=
e truth; yet he is=20

not believed, owing to the cunning displayed by his master. The headsmen ar=
e preparing to=20

execute Charudatta, when Vasantasena herself appears upon the scene, accomp=
anied by the=20

Buddhist monk. Her appearance puts a summary end to the proceedings. Then n=
ews is brought=20

that Aryaka has killed and supplanted the former king, that he wishes to re=
ward Charudatta, and=20

that he has by royal edict freed Vasantasena from the necessity of living a=
s a courtezan.=20

Sansthanaka is brought before Charudatta for sentence, but is pardoned by t=
he man whom he had=20

so grievously injured. The play ends with the usual Epilogue.  FOOTNOTES:  =

he deplores the corruption of high and low, the cupidity in Church and Stat=
e, and, above all,=20

applies his wit to expose the vices and infirmities of women. The earliest =
Poetic in French--_L'art=20



de dictier et de fere chancons, balades, virelais, et rondeaulx_ (1392)--is=
 the work of Eustache=20

Deschamps, in which the poet, by no means himself a master of harmonies, in=
sists on the prime=20

importance of harmony in verse.  The exhaustion of the mediaeval sources of=
 inspiration is still=20

more apparent in the fifteenth-century successors of Deschamps. But already=
 something of the=20

reviving influence of Italian culture makes itself felt. CHRISTINE DE PISAN=
, Italian by her=20

parentage and place of birth (_c_. 1363), was left a widow with three young=
 children at the age of=20

twenty-five. Her sorrow, uttered in verse, is a genuine lyric cry; but when=
 in her poverty she=20

practised authorship as a trade, while she wins our respect as a mother, th=
e poetess is too often at=20

once facile and pedantic. Christine was zealous in maintaining the honour o=
f her sex against the=20

injuries of Jean de Meun; in her prose _Cite des Dames_ she celebrates the =
virtues and heroism=20

of women, with examples from ancient and modern times; in the _Livre des Tr=
ois Vertus_ she=20

instructs women in their duties. When advanced in years, and sheltered in t=
he cloister, she sang=20

her swan-song in honour of Joan of Arc. Admirable in every relation of life=
, a patriot and a scholar,=20

she only needed one thing--genius--to be a poet of distinction.  A legend r=
elates that the=20

Dauphiness, Margaret of Scotland, kissed the lips of a sleeper who was the =
ugliest man in France,=20

because from that "precious mouth" had issued so many "good words and virtu=
ous sayings." The=20

sleeper was Christine's poetical successor, ALAIN CHARTIER. His fame was gr=
eat, and as a=20

writer of prose he must be remembered with honour, both for his patriotic a=
rdour, and for the=20

harmonious eloquence (modelled on classical examples) in which that ardour =
found expression.=20

His first work, the _Livre des Quatre Dames_, is in verse: four ladies lame=
nt their husbands slain,=20

captured, lost, or fugitive and dishonoured, at Agincourt. Many of his othe=
r poems were composed=20

as a distraction from the public troubles of the time; the title of one, wi=
dely celebrated in its own=20

day, _La Belle Dame sans Mercy_, has obtained a new meaning of romance thro=
ugh its=20

appropriation by Keats. In 1422 he wrote his prose _Quadrilogue Invectif_, =
in which suffering=20

France implores the nobles, the clergy, the people to show some pity for he=
r miserable state. If=20

Froissart had not discerned the evils of the feudal system, they were paten=
t to the eyes of Alain=20

Chartier. His _Livre de l'Esperance_, where the oratorical prose is intersp=
ersed with lyric verse,=20

spares neither the clergy nor the frivolous and dissolute gentry, who forge=
t their duty to their=20

country in wanton self-indulgence; yet his last word, written at the moment=
 when Joan of Arc was=20

leaving the pastures for battle, is one of hope. His _Curial_ (_The Courtie=
r_) is a satire on the=20

vices of the court by one who had acquaintance with its corruption. The lar=
ge, harmonious phrase=20

of Alain Chartier was new to French prose, and is hardly heard again until =
the seventeenth=20

century.  The last grace and refinements of chivalric society blossom in th=
e poetry of CHARLES=20

D'ORLEANS, "la grace exquise des choses freles." He was born in 1391, son o=
f Louis, Duke of=20

Orleans, and an Italian mother, Valentine of Milan. Married at fifteen to t=
he widow of Richard II. of=20

England, he lost his father by assassination, his mother by the stroke of g=
rief, his wife in childbirth.=20

of this tedious work, which of=20

Agincourt he passed to England, where he remained a prisoner, closely guard=
ed, for twenty-five=20

years. It seems as if events should have made him a tragic poet; but for Ch=
arles d'Orleans poetry=20

was the brightness or the consolation of his exile. His elder years at the =
little court of Blois were a=20

season of delicate gaiety, when he enjoyed the recreations of age, and smil=
ed at the passions of=20

youth. He died in 1465. Neither depth of reflection nor masculine power of =
feeling finds expression=20

in his verse; he does not contribute new ideas to poetry, nor invent new fo=
rms, but he rendered the=20

old material and made the accepted moulds of verse charming by a gracious p=
ersonality and an=20

exquisite sense of art. Ballade, rondeau, chanson, each is manipulated with=
 the skill of a goldsmith=20

setting his gems. He sings of the beauty of woman, the lighter joys of love=
, the pleasure of=20

springtide, the song of the birds, the gliding of a stream or a cloud; or, =
as an elder man, he mocks=20

with amiable irony the fatiguing ardours of young hearts. When St. Valentin=
e's day comes round,=20

his good physician "Nonchaloir" advises him to abstain from choosing a mist=
ress, and=20

recommends an easy pillow. The influence of Charles d'Orleans on French poe=
try was slight; it=20

was not until 1734 that his forgotten poems=20


_
the interest of the audience! Let me then most reverently salute the honora=
ble gentlemen, and=20

announce our intention to produce a drama called "The Little Clay Cart." It=
s author was a man=20

Who vied with elephants in lordly grace;       Whose eyes were those of the=
 chakora bird     That=20

feeds on moonbeams; glorious his face       As the full moon; his person, a=
ll have heard,     Was=20

altogether lovely. First in worth       Among the twice-born was this poet,=
 known     As Shudraka far=20

over all the earth,       His virtue's depth unfathomed and alone.         =
          3  [1.14. S.  And again:=20

The Samaveda, the Rigveda too,     The science mathematical, he knew;     T=
he arts wherein fair=20

courtezans excel,     And all the lore of elephants as well.     Through Sh=
iva's grace, his eye was=20

never dim;     He saw his son a king in place of him.     The difficult hor=
se-sacrifice he tried=20

Successfully; entered the fiery tide,     One hundred years and ten days ol=
d, and died.                4=20

And yet again:      Eager for battle; sloth's determined foe;       Of scho=
lars chief, who to the Veda=20

cling;     Rich in the riches that ascetics know;     Glad, gainst the foem=
an's elephant to show=20

His valor;--such was Shudraka, the king.                   5  And in this w=
ork of his,      Within the town,=20

Avanti named,     Dwells one called Charudatta, famed     No less for youth=
 than poverty;     A=20

merchant's son and Brahman, he.      His virtues have the power to move    =
 Vasantasena's inmost=20

love;     Fair as the springtime's radiancy,     And yet a courtezan is she=
.                                  6=20

So here king Shudraka the tale imparts     Of love's pure festival in these=
 two hearts,     Of  In the=20

close of the mediaeval period, when old things were passing away and new th=
ings were as yet=20

unborn, the minds of men inclined to fill the void with mockery and satire.=
 Martin Lefranc (_c_.=20

1410-61) in his _Champion des Dames_--a poem of twenty-four thousand lines,=
 in which there is=20

much spirit and vigour of versification--balances one against another the c=
ensure and the praise of=20

women. Coquillard, with his railleries assuming legal forms and phrases, la=
ughs at love and lovers,=20

or at the _Droits Nouveaux_ of a happy time when licence had become the gen=
eral law. Henri=20

Baude, a realist in his keen observation, satirises with direct, incisive f=
orce, the manners and=20

morals of his age. Martial d'Auvergne (_c_. 1433-1508), chronicling events =
in his _Vigiles de=20

Charles VII._, a poem written according to the scheme of the liturgical Vig=
ils, is eloquent in his=20

expression of the wrongs of the poor, and in his condemnation of the abuses=
 of power and station.=20

If the _Amant rendu Cordelier_ be his, he too appears among those who jest =
at the follies and=20

extravagance of love. His prose _Arrets d'Amour_ are discussions and decisi=
ons of the imaginary=20

court which determines questions of gallantry.  Amid such mockery of life a=
nd love, the horror of=20

death was ever present to the mind of a generation from which hope and fait=
h seemed to fail; it=20

was the time of the _Danse Macabre_; the skeleton became a grim humourist s=
atirising human=20

existence, and verses written for the dance of women were ascribed in the m=
anuscript which=20

preserves them to Martial d'Auvergne.  Passion and the idea of death mingle=
 with a power at once=20

realistic and romantic in the poetry of FRANCOIS VILLON. He was born in pov=
erty, an obscure=20

child=20


_
A rascal's nature, and the course of fate.                   7  [_He walks =
about and looks around him._]=20

Why, this music-room of ours is empty. I wonder where the actors have gone.=
 [_Reflecting._] Ah, I=20

understand.  P. 4.7]      Empty his house, to whom no child was born;      =
 Thrice empty his, who=20

lacks true friends and sure;     To fools, the world is empty and forlorn; =
      But all that is, is empty=20

to the poor.                     8  I have finished the concert. And I've b=
een practising so of his early=20

protector, Villon; obtained as a poor scholar his bachelor's degree in 1449=
, and three years later=20

became a _maitre es arts_; but already he was a master of arts less credita=
ble than those of the=20

University. In 1455 Villon--or should we call him Monterbier, Montcorbier, =
Corbueil, Desloges,=20

Mouton (aliases convenient for vagabondage)?--quarrelled with a priest, and=
 killed his adversary;=20

he was condemned to death, and cheered his spirits with the piteous ballade=
 for those about to=20

swing=20


_
the pupils of my eyes are dancing, and I'm so hungry that my eyes are crack=
ling like a lotus-seed,=20

dried up by the fiercest rays of the summer sun. I'll just call my wife and=
 ask whether there is=20

anything for breakfast or not.  Hello! here I am--but no! Both the particul=
ar occasion and the=20

general custom demand that I speak Prakrit. [_Speaking in Prakrit._] Confou=
nd it! I've been=20

practising so long and I'm so hungry that my limbs are as weak as dried-up =
lotus-stalks. Suppose I=20

go home and see whether my good wife has got anything ready or not. [_He wa=
lks about and=20

looks around him._] Here I am at home. I'll just go in. [_He enters and loo=
ks about._] Merciful=20

heavens! Why in the world is everything in our house turned upside down? A =
long stream of rice-

water is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black where the iron =
kettle has been rubbed=20

clean, is as lovely as a girl with the beauty-marks of black cosmetic on he=
r face. It smells so good=20

that my hunger seems to blaze up and hurts me more than ever. Has some hidd=
en treasure come=20

to light? or am I hungry enough to think the whole world is made of rice? T=
here surely isn't any=20

breakfast in our house, and I'm starved to death. But everything seems tops=
yturvy here. One girl is=20

preparing cosmetics, the crows; but the capital punishment was commuted to =
banishment. Next=20

winter, stung by the infidelity and insults of a woman to whom he had aband=
oned himself, he fled,=20

perhaps to Angers, bidding his friends a jesting farewell in the bequests o=
f his _Petit Testament_.=20

Betrayed by one who claimed him as an associate in robbery, Villon is lost =
to view for three years;=20

and when we rediscover him in 1461, it is as a prisoner, whose six months' =
fare has been bread=20

and water in his cell at Meun-sur-Loire. The entry of Louis XI., recently c=
onsecrated king, freed the=20

unhappy captive. Before the year closed he had composed his capital work, t=
he _Grand=20

Testament_, and proved himself the most original poet of his century. And t=
hen Villon disappears;=20

whether he died soon after, whether he lived for half a score of years, we =
do not know.  While he=20

handles with masterly ease certain of the fifteenth-century forms of verse-=
-in particular the ballade-

-Villon is a modern in his abandonment of the traditional machinery of the =
imagination, its=20

convention of allegories and abstractions, and those half-realised moralisi=
ngs which were=20

repeated from writer to writer; he is modern in the intensity of a personal=
 quality which is=20

impressed upon his work, in the complexity of=20
