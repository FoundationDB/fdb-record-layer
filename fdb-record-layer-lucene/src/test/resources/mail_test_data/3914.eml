gle other plate can be found=20

worthy to compete with the _Great Fair of Florence_. He has done as well, p=
erhaps, but never=20

better."  At this time his production was, all of it, full of life and spir=
it, vivacious and fluent, the very=20

joy of workmanship. He frequently began and finished a plate in a day, and =
his long apprenticeship=20

to his tools had made him completely their master. In many of the prints ar=
e found traces of dry=20

point, and those who looked on while he worked have testified that when a b=
lank space on his=20

plate displeased him he was wont to take up his instrument and engrave a fi=
gure, a bit of drapery,=20

or some trees in the empty spaces, directly upon the copper, improvising fr=
om his ready fancy.=20

For recreation he commonly turned to some other form of his craft. He tried=
 painting, and some of=20

his admirers would like to prove that he was a genius in this sort, but it =
is fairly settled that when=20

once he became entangled in the medium of color he was lost, producing the =
heaviest and most=20

unpleasing effects, and that he produced no finished work in this kind. He =
contributed to the=20

technical outfit of the etcher a new varnish, the hard varnish of the lute-=
makers which up to that=20

time had not been used in etching, and which, substituted for  It was on Fe=

Washington=E2=80=99s birthday--that the Mexican advance made its appearance=
, rolling before it clouds of=20

dust. It had suffered dreadfully on the road from San Luis from cold and wa=
nt of supplies; but,=20

allowing for these sources of loss, the army led by Santa Anna cannot have =
numbered less than=20

twenty thousand men, including four thousand cavalry and twenty pieces of a=
rtillery; and the=20

sufferings of the march made the soldiers all the more eager for the battle=
. Disappointed in not=20

finding Taylor at Agua Nueva, as he had expected, Santa Anna proclaimed tha=
t he had fled, and=20

ordered the cavalry in pursuit. The Mexicans had already had one experience=
 of Taylor=E2=80=99s flights--a=20

second was at hand. When the lancers reached the Angostura, they found the =
pass guarded by=20

Washington=E2=80=99s battery of eight pieces, and very properly halted. The=
 correspondence, since so=20

famous, between the two generals then took place; and on receipt of Taylor=
=E2=80=99s laconic letter Santa=20

Anna commenced the attack.  The advantage of position was all on the side o=
f the United States=20

army. The pass itself was so narrow that Washington=E2=80=99s battery could=
 guard it against almost any=20

force; impassable gullies and ravines flanked it on the west, and on the ea=
st the mountains=20

gradually rose to a height of some two thousand feet. The only spot on whic=

d delicacy, and also=20

made it possible for him to keep several plates going at once, as he deligh=
ted to do, turning from=20

one to another as his mood prompted him.  This Florentine period was one of=
 countless=20

satisfactions for him. More fortunate than many artists, he won his fame in=
 time to enjoy it. His=20

productions were so highly regarded during his lifetime that good proofs we=
re eagerly sought, and=20

to use Baldinucci's expression, were "_enfermees sous sept clefs_." He was =
known all over=20

Europe, and about his neck he wore a battle could be fought was a plateau o=
n the east of the=20

pass, which stretched from the precipitous mountain-slope nearly to the roa=
d, terminating on that=20

side in several ridges and ravines. This plateau gained, the pass might hav=
e been turned; and=20

accordingly Santa Anna=E2=80=99s first thought was to master it. A strong b=
ody of light infantry was=20

despatched, in the afternoon of the 22d, to climb the mountain-side which c=
ommanded the=20

plateau; but the moment the man=C5=93uvre was perceived a party of Taylor=
=E2=80=99s riflemen ascended the=20

opposite ridge to keep them in check. The Mexicans opened fire, and the Ken=

great. When Cosimo died and the pensions of the artists were discontinued, =
Callot was quite past=20

the need of princely favors, and could and thus, as each body strove to ove=

ridges were soon covered with smoke. Foiled in his object, Santa Anna await=

commence operations in earnest; and Taylor, fearing an attack on Saltillo, =

defences of that point during the night.  At two o=E2=80=99clock in the mor=
