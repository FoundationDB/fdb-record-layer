to your endeavours. Nevertheless, be not discouraged, but try, ever keep tr=
ying;(854) twenty=20

failures are not irremediable if followed by as many undaunted struggles up=
ward. Is it not so that=20

mountains are climbed? And know further, that if Karma relentlessly records=
 in the Esotericist's=20

account, bad deeds that in the ignorant would be overlooked, yet, equally t=
rue is it that each of his=20

good deeds is, by reason of his association with the Higher Self, a hundred=
fold intensified as a=20

potentiality for good.  Finally, keep ever in mind the consciousness that t=
hough you see no Master=20

by your bedside, nor hear one audible whisper in the silence of the still n=
ight, yet the Holy Power is=20

about you, the Holy Light is shining into your hour of spiritual need and a=
spirations, and it will be=20

no fault of the MASTERS, or of their humble mouthpiece and servant, if thro=
ugh perversity or=20

moral feebleness some of you cut yourselves off from these higher potencies=
, and step upon the=20

declivity that leads to Avitchi.     Appendix. Notes on Papers I., II. and =
III.    Page 436.   Students in=20

the west have little or no idea of the forces that lie latent in Sound, the=
 Akashic vibrations that may=20

be set up by those who understand how to pronounce certain words. The Om, o=
r the "_Om mani=20

padme hum_" are in spiritual affinity with cosmic forces, but without a kno=
wledge of the natural=20

arrangement, or of the order in which the syllables stand, very little can =
be achieved. "Om" is, of=20

course, Aum, that may be pronounced as two, three or seven syllables, setti=
ng up different=20

vibrations.  Now, letters, as vocal sounds, cannot fail to correspond with =
musical notes, and=20

therefore with numbers and colours; hence also with Forces and Tattvas. He =
who remembers that=20

the Universe is built up from the Tattvas will readily understand something=
 of the power that may=20

be exercised by vocal sounds. Every letter in the alphabet, whether divided=
 into three, four, or=20

seven septenaries, or forty-nine letters, has its own colour, or shade of c=
olour. He who has learnt=20

the colours of the alphabetical letters, and the corresponding numbers of t=
he seven, and the forty-

nine colours and shades on the scale of planes and forces, and knows their =
respective order in the=20

seven planes, will easily master the art of bringing them into affinity or =
interplay. But here a=20

difficulty arises. The Senzar and Sanskrit alphabets, and other Occult tong=
ues, besides other=20

potencies, have a number, colour, and distinct syllable for every letter, a=
nd so had also the old=20

Mosaic Hebrew. But how many students know any of these tongues? When the ti=
me comes,=20

therefore, it must suffice to teach the students the numbers and colours at=
tached to the Latin=20

letters only (N.B. as pronounced in Latin, not in Anglo-Saxon, Scotch, or I=
rish). This, however,=20

would be at present premature.  The colour and number of not only the plane=
ts but also the=20

zodiacal constellations corresponding to every letter of the alphabet, are =
necessary to make any=20

special syllable, and even letter, _operative_.(855) Therefore if a student=
 would make Buddhi=20

operative, for instance, he would have to intone the first words of the Man=
tra on the note _mi_. But=20

he would have still further to accentuate the _mi_, and produce mentally th=
e yellow colour=20

corresponding to this sound and note, on every letter M in "_Om mani padme =
hum_"; this, not=20

because the note bears the same name in the vernacular, Sanskrit, or even t=
he Senzar, for it does=20

not--but because the letter M follows the first letter, and is in this sacr=
ed formula also the seventh=20

and the fourth. As Buddhi it is second; as Buddhi-Manas it is the second an=
d third combined.  H.=20

P. B.    Page 439.(856)   The Pythagorean Four, or Tetraktys, was the symbo=
l of the Kosmos, as=20

containing within itself, the point, the line, the superficies, the solid; =
in other words, the essentials=20

of all forms. Its mystical representation is the point within the triangle.=
 The Decad or perfect=20

number is contained in the Four; thus, 1+2+3+4=3D10.    Page 477.   The dif=
ficult passage: "Bear in=20



mind ... a mystery below truly,"(857) may become a little more clear to the=
 student if slightly=20

amplified. The "primordial Triangle" is the Second Logos, which reflects it=
self as a Triangle in the=20

Third Logos, or Heavenly Man, and then disappears. The Third Logos, contain=
ing the "potency of=20

formative creation," develops the Tetraktys from the Triangle, and so becom=
es the Seven, the=20

Creative Force, making a Decad with the primordial Triangle which originate=
d it. When this=20

heavenly Triangle and Tetraktys are reflected in the Universe of Matter, as=
 the astral paradigmatic=20

man, they are  "Peste!" said Porthos, "it would be a pity; animals which co=
st me a hundred pistoles=20

each."  "I will pay you two hundred for them," said Mazarin.  "Yes, but whe=
n once they are=20

hamstrung, our necks will be strung next."  "If one of them comes to my sid=
e," asked Porthos,=20

"must I kill him?"  "Yes, by a blow of your fist, if you can; we will not f=
ire but at the last extremity."=20

"I can do it," said Porthos.  "Come and open, then!" cried D'Artagnan to th=
e man with the scythe,=20

taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the=
 handle. And as the man=20

approached, D'Artagnan, in order to have more freedom for his actions, lean=
ed half out of the=20

door; his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant, which were lighted u=
p by a lantern. Without=20

doubt he recognized D'Artagnan, for he became deadly pale; doubtless the mu=
sketeer knew him,=20

for his hair stood up on his head.  "Monsieur d'Artagnan!" he cried, fallin=
g back a step; "it is=20

Monsieur d'Artagnan! let him pass."  D'Artagnan was perhaps about to reply,=
 when a blow, similar=20

to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox, was heard. The noise was =
caused by Porthos, who=20

had just knocked down his man.  D'Artagnan turned around and saw the unfort=
unate man upon his=20

back about four paces off.  "'Sdeath!" cried he to the coachman. "Spur your=
 horses! whip! get on!"=20

The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses; the noble a=
nimals bounded=20

forward; then cries of men who were knocked down were heard; then a double =
concussion was=20

felt, and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body. =
There was a moment's=20

silence, then the carriage cleared the gate.  "To Cours la Reine!" cried D'=
Artagnan to the=20

coachman; then turning to Mazarin he said, "Now, my lord, you can say five =
paters and five aves,=20

in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance. You are safe--you are free."  Maz=
arin replied only by a=20

groan; he could not believe in such a miracle. Five minutes later the carri=
age stopped, having=20

reached Cours la Reine.  "Is my lord pleased with his escort?" asked D'Arta=
gnan.  "Enchanted,=20

monsieur," said Mazarin, venturing his head out of one of the windows; "and=
 now do as much for=20

the queen."  "It will not be so difficult," replied D'Artagnan, springing t=
o the ground. "Monsieur du=20

Vallon, I commend his eminence to your care."  "Be quite at ease," said Por=
thos, holding out his=20

hand, which D'Artagnan took and shook in his.  "Oh!" cried Porthos, as if i=
n pain.  D'Artagnan=20

looked with surprise at his friend.  "What is the matter, then?" he asked. =
 "I think I have sprained=20

my wrist,' said Porthos.  "The devil! why, you strike like a blind or a dea=
f man."  "It was necessary;=20

my man was going to fire a pistol at me; but you--how did you get rid of yo=
urs?"  "Oh, mine,"=20

replied D'Artagnan, "was not a man."  "What was it then?"  "It was an appar=
ition."  "And----"  "I=20

charmed it away."  Without further explanation D'Artagnan took the pistols =
which were upon the=20

front seat, placed them in his belt, wrapped himself in his cloak, and not =
wishing to enter by the=20

same gate as that through which they had left, he took his way toward the R=
ichelieu gate.     52.=20

The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur.   Instead of returning, then, by th=
e Saint Honore gate,=20

D'Artagnan, who had time before him, walked around and re-entered by the Po=
rte Richelieu. He=20

was approached to be examined, and when it was discovered by his plumed hat=
 and his laced=20



coat, that he was an officer of the musketeers, he was surrounded, with the=
 intention of making=20

him cry, "Down with Mazarin!" The demonstration did not fail to make him un=
easy at first; but when=20

he discovered what it meant, he shouted it in such a voice that even the mo=
st exacting were=20

satisfied. He walked down the Rue Richelieu, meditating how he should carry=
 off the queen in her=20

turn, for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to b=
e thought of, when he=20

perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to Madame=
 de Guemenee.  He=20

was struck by a sudden idea.  "Ah, pardieu!" he exclaimed; "that would be f=
air play."  And=20

approaching the carriage, he examined the arms on the panels and the livery=
 of the coachman on=20

his box. This scrutiny was so much the more easy, the coachman being sound =
asleep.  "It is, in=20

truth, monsieur le coadjuteur's carriage," said D'Artagnan; "upon my honor =
I begin to think that=20

Heaven favors us."  He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the =
silk cord which was=20

attached to the coachman's little finger.  "To the Palais Royal," he called=
 out.  The coachman=20

awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired, never=20


_
formative potency, is thrown below the Quaternary, with its apex pointing d=
ownwards: the Monad=20

of this astral paradigmatic man is itself a Triangle, bearing to the Quater=
nary and Triangle the=20

relation borne by the primordial Triangle to the Heavenly Man. Hence the ph=
rase, "the upper=20

Triangle ... is shifted in the man of clay below _the seven_." Here again t=
he Point tracing the=20

Triangle, the Monad becoming the Ternary, with the Quaternary and the lower=
 creative triangle,=20

make up the Decad, the perfect number. "As above, so below."  The student w=
ill do well to relate=20

the knowledge here acquired to that given on p. 477. Here the upper Triangl=
e is given as Violet,=20

Indigo, Blue, associating Violet as the paradigm of all forms with Indigo a=
s Mahat, and blue as the=20

Atmic Aura. In the Quaternary, Yellow, as substance, is associated with Yel=
low-Orange, Life, and=20

Red-Orange, the creative potency. Green is the plane between.  The next sta=
ge is not explained.=20

Green passes upwards to Violet, Indigo, Blue, the Triangle opening out to r=
eceive it, and so=20

forming the square, Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green. This leaves the Red-Orange=
, Yellow-Orange, and=20

Yellow, and these, having thus lost their fourth member, can only form a tr=
iangle. This triangle=20

revolves, to point downwards for the descent into matter, and "mirrored on =
the plane of gross=20

nature, it is reversed."  In the perfect man the Red will be absorbed by th=
e Green; Yellow porter at=20

the palace was about to close the gates, but seeing such a handsome equipag=
e he fancied that it=20

was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to st=
op beneath the porch.=20

It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehi=
cle; he fancied=20

monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back, and without dropping the reins h=
e sprang from his box=20

to open the door. D'Artagnan, in his turn, sprang to the ground, and just a=
t the moment when the=20

coachman, alarmed at not seeing his master, fell back a step, he seized him=
 by his collar with the=20

left, whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his br=
east.  "Pronounce one=20

single word," muttered D'Artagnan, "and you are a dead man."  The coachman =
perceived at once,=20

by the expression of the man who thus addressed him, that he had fallen int=
o a trap, and he=20

remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring.  Two m=
usketeers were=20

pacing the court, to whom D'Artagnan called by their names.  "Monsieur de B=
elliere," said he to=20

one of them, "do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this wort=
hy man, mount upon the=20

box and drive to the door of the private stair, and wait for me there; it i=
s an affair of importance on=20

the service of the king."  The musketeer, who knew that his lieutenant was =
incapable of jesting=20

with regard to the service, obeyed without a word, although he thought the =
order=20

become one with Indigo; Yellow-Orange will be absorbed in Blue; Violet will=
 remain outside the=20

True Man, though connected with him. Or, to translate the colours: Kama wil=
l be absorbed in the=20

Lower Manas; Buddhi will become one with Manas; Prana will be absorbed in t=
he Auric Egg; the=20

physical body remains, connected but outside the real life.  A. B.    Page =
481.   To the five senses=20

at present the property of mankind two more on this globe are to be added. =
The sixth sense is the=20

psychic sense of colour. The seventh is that of spiritual sound. In the sec=
ond instruction, the=20

corrected rates of vibration for the seven primary colours and their modula=
tions are given. said:=20

"Monsieur du Verger, help me to place this man in a place of safety."  The =
musketeer, thinking that=20

his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise, bowed, and drawin=
g his sword, signified=20

that he was ready. D'Artagnan mounted the staircase, followed by his prison=
er, who in his turn=20

was followed by the soldier, and entered Mazarin's ante-room. Bernouin was =
waiting there,=20

impatient for news of his master.  "Well, sir?" he said.  "Everything goes =
on capitally, my dear=20

Monsieur Bernouin, but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe p=
lace."  "Where, then,=20

sir?"  "Where you like, provided that the place which you shall choose has =

were barred and which looked very much like a prison.  "And now, my good fr=
iend," said=20

D'Artagnan to him, "I must invite you to deprive yourself, for my sake, of =
