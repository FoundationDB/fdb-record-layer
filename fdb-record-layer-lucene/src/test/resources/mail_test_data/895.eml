 sinful, and a=20

perseverance in schism; for our adversary and his followers, swollen up wit=
h pride, will not bend=20

nor incline to peace, but will acquire greater obstinacy from the hopes thy=
 conduct will have given=20

them, that we shall be deprived of any power over thy subjects and kingdom.=
 Thus those who=20

were dejected and in despair will, from our oppressions, regain strength an=
d courage.  =E2=80=98Truly, most=20

dear son, we to whom God has intrusted the care of his people, cannot longe=
r suffer such things=20

as may be injurious to the divine Majesty, and may cause the peril of souls=
, and tend to keep alive=20

the schism in the holy church, and to invalidate my election and reputation=
.  =E2=80=98We grieve much at=20

thy deception, and at the wicked counsels thou hast received,=E2=80=94and w=
e exhort and entreat of thee,=20

in the name of our blessed Saviour, that thou wouldst not listen to such wi=
cked men, who seek=20

their own profit from the losses of the church, and from the quarrels they =
may excite in thy family.=20

=E2=80=98With regard to our proceedings, thou hast had full knowledge of th=
em, from what we have written=20

to thee on the subject. Consider, therefore, coolly with thy council, the p=
urity of our intentions:=20

have the goodness to revoke and annul all edicts that may be injurious to u=
s and to the church,=20

and use thy endeavours to bring thine and all other slight injury to be fol=
lowed by unexpected and=20

untoward results, not to be looked for in the average individual. In such c=
ases the evidence of the=20

abnormal condition furnished by the medical witness may diminish the respon=
sibility and mitigate=20

the punishment.  Furthermore, the responsibility of the assailant may not b=
e altogether removed,=20

for the question naturally arises, Was death accelerated by the wound? This=
 depends upon the=20

circumstances in each case upon which the medical witness must base his opi=
nion. Maliciously=20

accelerating the death of another is regarded as criminal on the principle =
that that which=20

accelerates causes. The following cases are quoted from Taylor[631] to illu=
strate the above=20

distinctions. In Reg. _v._ Timms (Oxford Lent Ass., 1870) the deceased had =
been struck on the=20

head by the accused with a hatchet, from which injury he had partly recover=
ed under treatment in=20

twelve days. But six weeks later he was seized with inflammation of the bra=
in, with convulsions,=20

and died. At the autopsy disease of the kidneys was found, and death was re=
ferred to this and the=20

inflammation of the brain due to the blows. The prisoner was convicted afte=

charged the jury that it was manslaughter if they believed that the blows c=

death of the deceased.  In the following cases there was no connection betw=
