the same words as literature is made of; what more natural than to conclude=
 that literature=20

therefore may deal with any subject we talk of? We resent the suggestion th=
at art should be=20

narrower than life itself. Yet if we admit any difference at all between ar=
t and life, between=20

literature and our average conversations, between books which give informat=
ion and books which=20

give delight, and if art is the record of that aspect of life we delight in=
 not for the moment but=20

permanently, then art is indeed narrower than life itself; outside of it wi=

however likable, of our daily round, which we forget gladly, so many other =
pleasant and trivial=20

things supplant them; and outside of it also will remain very the arbitrary=
 rule of a woman, and of a=20

woman who had not the shadow of a constitutional right to rule. But though =
discontent was general=20

among the nobles, they yet lacked energy and direction, while the commons t=
ook but little interest=20

in a mere squabble among their rulers. Perhaps the general opinion was some=
what like that of the=20

University of Paris, to which Louis had appealed, namely, that the power wa=
s in the hands best=20

fitted to wield it. Undoubtedly, the Parliament of Paris was of this opinio=
n; for when Louis=20

presented a long petition reciting his grievances and protesting against th=
e usurpation of Madame=20

de Beaujeu, who held in unlawful subjection the person of the king, who int=
ended to keep the said=20
