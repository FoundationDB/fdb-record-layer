for ladies as it is for gentlemen, being all indoor work, and any one can do it. My brother, although 

he worked two days longer than I did, only made $91.50. I am getting up a collection of curiosities,

stones, ores, shells, wood, leaves of trees, plants, etc. Anything small will do. What I want to get is

description in the State of Tennessee, but I have not visited them.  Though not immediately 

connected with this subject, I take the liberty to subjoin an account of a remarkable cave or grotto, 

in a bluff of limestone, on the south bank of the
