"  A friendly hand-shake between the favor me with a letter from Carlyle." =
 At the mention of the name Carlyle his eyes lifted, and he asked: "Carlyle=
, did you say, sir, Carlyle?"  "Yes," said the boy, "Thomas Carlyle."  "Ye-=
es," Emerson answered slowly.  "To be sure, Carlyle.  Yes, he was here this=
 morning.  _
away on business. Make yourself at home and see that Anita is properly prot=
ected; I will return in a=20

week at the furthest;--perhaps in a day or two."  He took down his rifle an=
d belt from the wall,=20

buckled on the latter, and half an hour later left the "pocket." That was a=
 day of days to Harry=20

Redburn. He rambled about the picturesque little valley, romped on the luxu=
riant morning.  "These=20

letters, you mean?" he said, as the boy pointed to some letters on his desk=
 unopened.  "Oh, yes!=20

They must have come in a later mail. Well, if it will make you feel any bet=
ter I'll go through them,=20

and you can go through my books if you like.  I'll trust you," he added lau=
ghingly, as Wendell=20

Phillips's advice occurred to him.  "You like books, you say?" he=20


_
night he sat in the cabin door and listened to the cries of the night birds=
 and the incessant hooting=20

of the mountain owls (which by the way, are very abundant throughout the Bl=
ack Hills.)  All efforts=20

to engage Anita in conversation proved fruitless.  On the following day bot=
h were considerably=20

astonished to perceive that there was a stranger in their Paradise;--a bow-=
legged, hump-backed,=20

grisly little old fellow, who walked with a staff. He approached the cabin,=
 and Redburn went out to=20

find who he was.  "Gude-mornin'!" nodded General Nix, (for it was he) with =
a grin. "I jes' kim over=20

inter this deestrict ter prospect fer gold. Don' seem ter recognize yer unk=
le, eh? boy; I'm Nix=20

Walsingham Nix, Esquire, geological surveyor an' mine-locater. I've located=

perdict frum ther geological formation o' this nest an' a dream I hed last =
night, thet thar's sum uv=20

 "Humph! no gold here," replied=20

Redburn, who had already learned from "Well, then, you must come into my li=
brary here at any=20

time you are in Boston, and spend a morning reading anything I have that yo=
u like. Young men do=20

that, you know, and I like to have them.  What's the use of good friends if=
 you don't share them?=20

There's where the pleasure comes in."  He asked the boy then about his news=
paper work, how=20

much it paid him, and whether he felt it helped him in an educational way. =
 The boy told him he=20

thought it did; that it furnished good lessons in the study of human nature=
.  "Yes," he said, "I, can=20

believe that, so long as it is good journalism."  As he let the boy out of =
his house, at the end of that=20

first, meeting, he said to him:  "And you're going from me now to see Emers=
on?  I don't know," he=20

added reflectively, "whether you will see him at his best.  Still, you may.=
 And even if you do not, to=20

have seen him, even as you may see him, is better, in a way, than not to ha=
ve seen him at all."=20

Edward did not know what Phillips Brooks meant.  But he was, sadly, to find=
 out the next day.   A=20

boy was pretty sure of a welcome from Louisa Alcott, and his greeting from =
her was=20

ow did you get into the=20

valley?"  "Through ther pass," and the General chuckled approvingly. "See'd=
 a feller kim down ther=20

canyon, yesterday, so I nosed about ter find whar he kim from, that's how I=
 got here;  "Why, you=20

good boy," she said, "to come all the way to Concord to see us," quite for =
all the world as if she=20

were the one favored.  "Now take your coat off, and come right in by the fi=
re.  Do tell me all about=20

your visit."  Before that cozy fire they chatted.  It was pleasant to the=
=20


_
this place."  "Indeed!" Redburn was puzzled how to act under the circumstan=
ces. Just then there=20

came a piercing scream from the direction of the cabin.  What could it mean=
? Was Nix an enemy,=20

and was some one else of his gang attacking Anita?  Certainly she _was_ in =
trouble!     CHAPTER=20

V.  SITTING BULL--THE FAIR CAPTIVE.   Fearless Frank stepped back aghast, a=
s he saw the=20

inhuman chief of the Sioux--the cruel, grim-faced warrior, Sitting Bull; sh=
runk back, and laid his=20

hand upon the butt of a revolver.  "Ha!" he articulated, "is that you, chie=
f? You, and at such work=20

as this?" there was stern reproach in the youth's tone, and certain it is t=
hat the Sioux warrior heard=20

the words spoken.  "My friend, Scarlet Boy, is keen with the tongue," he sa=
id, frowning. "Let him=20

put shackles upon it, before it leaps over the bounds of reason."  "I see n=
o reason why I should not=20

speak in behalf of yon suffering girl!" retorted the youth, fearlessly, "on=
 whom you have been=20

inflicting one of the most inhuman tortures Indian cunning could conceive. =
For shame, chief, that=20

you should ever assent to such an act--lower yourself to the grade of a dog=
 by such a dastard=20

deed. For shame, I say!"  Instantly the form of the great warrior straighte=
ned up like an arrow, and=20

his painted hand flew toward the pistols in his belt.  But the succeeding s=
econd he seemed to=20

change his intention; his hand went out toward the youth in greeting:  "The=
 Scarlet Boy is right," he=20

said, with as much graveness as a red-skin can conceive. "Sitting Bull list=
ens to his words as he=20

would to those of a brother. Scarlet Boy is no stranger in the land of the =
Sioux; he is the friend of=20

the great chief and his warriors. Once when the storm-gods were at war over=
 the pine forests and=20

picture there with that sweet-faced woman with those kindly eyes!  After a =
while she said: "Now I=20

shall put on my coat and hat, and we shall walk over to Emerson's house.  I=
 am almost afraid to=20

promise that you will see him.  He sees scarcely any one now.  He is feeble=
, and--"  She did not=20

finish the sentence.  "But we'll walk over there, at any rate."  She spoke =
mostly of her father as the=20

two walked along, and it was easy to see that his condition was now the one=
 thought of her life.=20

Presently they reached Emerson's house, and Miss Emerson welcomed them at t=
he door.  After a=20

brief chat Miss Alcott told of the boy's hope. Miss Emerson shook her head.=
  "Father sees no one=20

now," she said, "and I fear it might not be a pleasure if you did see him."=
  Then Edward told her=20

what Phillips Brooks had said.  "Well," she said, "I'll see."  She had scar=
cely left the room when=20

Miss Alcott rose and followed her, saying to the boy: "You shall see Mr. Em=
erson if it is at all=20

possible."  In a few minutes Miss Alcott returned, her eyes moistened, and =
simply said: "Come."=20

The boy followed her through two rooms, and at the threshold of the third, =
Miss Emerson stood,=20

also with moistened eyes.  "Father," she said simply, and there, at his des=
k, sat Emerson--the man=20

whose words had already won Edward Bok's boyish interest, and who was desti=
ned to impress=20

himself upon his life more deeply than any other writer.  Slowly, at the da=
ughter's spoken word,=20

Emerson rose with a wonderful quiet dignity, extended his hand, and as the =
boy's hand rested in=20

his, looked him full in the eyes.  No light of welcome came from those sad =
yet tender eyes.  The=20

boy closed upon the hand in his with a loving pressure, and for a single mo=
ment the eyelids rose,=20

a different look came into=20


_
the Hills; when the Great Spirit was sending fiery messengers down in vivid=
 streaks from the skies,=20

the Big Chief cast a thunderbolt in playfulness at the feet of Sitting Bull=
. The shock of the hand of=20

the Great Spirit did not escape me; for hours I lay like one slain in battl=
e. My warriors were in=20

consternation; they ran hither and thither in affright, calling on the Mani=
tou to preserve their chief.=20

You came, Scarlet Boy, in the midst of all the panic;--came, and Edward fel=
t a slight, perceptible=20

response of the hand.  But that was all!  Quietly he motioned the boy to a =
chair beside the desk.=20

Edward sat down and was about to say something, when, instead of seating hi=
mself, Emerson=20

walked away to the window and stood there softly whistling and looking out =
as if there were no one=20

in the room.  Edward's eyes had followed Emerson's every footstep, when the=
 boy was aroused by=20

hearing a suppressed sob, and as he looked around he=20


_
a stripling, you applied simple remedies that restored Sitting Bull to the =
arms of his warriors.[A]=20

"From that hour Sitting Bull was your friend--is your friend, now, and will=
 be as long as the red-men=20

exist as a tribe."  "Thank you, chief;" and Fearless Frank grasped the Indi=
an's hand and wrung it=20

warmly. "I believe you mean all you say. But I am surprised to find you eng=
aged at such work as=20

this. I have been told Emerson.  Slowly she walked out of the room.  The bo=
y looked at Miss=20

Alcott, and she put her finger to her mouth, indicating silence.  He was no=
nplussed.  Edward=20

looked toward Emerson standing in that window, and wondered what it all mea=
nt.  Presently=20

Emerson left the window and, crossing the room, came to his desk, bowing to=
 the boy as he=20

passed, and seated himself, not speaking a word and ignoring the presence o=
f=20


_
Sitting Bull made war only on warriors--not on women."  An ugly frown darke=
ned the savage's=20

face--a frown wherein was depicted a number of slumbering passions.  "The p=
ale-face girl is the=20

last survivor of a train that the warriors of Sitting Bull attacked in Red =
Canyon. Sitting Bull lost=20

many warriors; yon pale squaw shot down full a half-score before persons in=
 the room.  Suddenly=20

the boy heard Miss Alcott say: "Have you read this new book by Ruskin yet?"=
  Slowly the great=20

master of thought lifted his eyes from his desk, turned toward the speaker,=
 rose with stately=20

courtesy from his chair, and, bowing to Miss Alcott, said with great delibe=
ration: "Did you speak to=20

me, madam?"  The boy was dumfounded!=20


_
be captured; she belongs to the warriors of Sitting Bull, and not to the gr=
eat chief himself."  "Yet=20

you have the power to free her--to yield her up to me. Consider, chief; are=
 you not enough my=20

friend that you can afford to give me the pale-face girl? Surely, she has b=
een tortured sufficiently=20

to satisfy your braves' thirst for vengeance."  Sitting Bull was silent.  k=
now her!  Suddenly the=20

whole sad truth flashed upon the boy.  Tears sprang into Miss Alcott's eyes=
, and she walked to the=20

other side of the room.  The boy did not know what to say or do, so he sat =
silent.  With a deliberate=20

movement Emerson resumed his seat, and slowly his eyes roamed over the boy =
sitting at the side=20

of the desk.  He felt he should say something.  "I=20
