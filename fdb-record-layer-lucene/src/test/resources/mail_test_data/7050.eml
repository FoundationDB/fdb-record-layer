the Faky that I was a doctor, and that I had the best medicines at the serv=

advice gratis. In a short time I had many applicants, to whom I served out =
a quantity of Holloway's=20

pills. These are most useful to an explorer, as, possessing unmistakeable p=
urgative properties,=20

they create an undeniable effect upon the patient, which satisfies him of t=

extremely convenient, as they may be carried by the pound in a tin box, and=
 served out in=20

infinitesimal doses from one to ten at a time, according to the age of the =
patients. I had a large=20

medicine chest, with all necessary drugs, but I was sorely troubled by the =
Arab women, many of=20

whom were barren, who insisted upon my supplying them with some medicine th=
at would remove=20

this stigma and render them fruitful. It was in vain to deny them; I theref=
ore gave them usually a=20

you?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh, Mr. Phoebus, you will help me!=E2=80=9D said Lo=
thair; and then he went up to him and told him=20

every thing. All difficulties, of course, vanished before the presence of M=
r. Phoebus, whom the=20

officers of the port evidently looked upon as a being beyond criticism and =
control.  =E2=80=9CAnd now,=E2=80=9D said=20
