If Raoul had been jealous of Count Godensky, _
self-complacent smile, the loud voice, the jovial chuckle of Ben, it was di=
fficult to associate with=20

him any idea of sickness or of death. But Bell saw that his news had sadden=
ed his young=20

companion, and as his light cart rapidly wheeled round a corner of the road=
, he as rapidly turned=20

the current of conversation.  "You've chosen a pleasant time of the year fo=
r your visit to the=20

country, Norah. How long are you likely to stay with your uncle?"  "I don't=
 know; I can't say,--I=20

suppose till I get another place," answered the girl.  "Ah, you've tired of=
 London, after a village life;=20

I always thought that you would. Noise, bustle, and bother! Talk of the cla=
ck of my mill-wheel,--

why, in London there are thousands of wheels perpetually going, and streams=
 of people=20

perpetually flowing; there's something always on the grind. I like you the =
better for getting away as=20

fast as you possibly can from London."  "I'd have stopped there if I could,=
" said the young servant=20

in a scarcely audible voice.  "Then why did you give warning?" asked the mi=
ller.  "I did not give=20

warning," replied poor Norah, blushing and hanging down her head; "my mistr=
ess gave warning to=20

me."  "There's simple truth, anyways," said the miller, a grim smile rising=
 to his lips. "You are just=20

like your sailor uncle: Franks is his name, and frank's his nature. I don't=
 believe he ever told an=20

untruth in his life."  Norah turned her head, and gazed sadly on the meadow=
s and groves, clad in=20

spring's fresh green, by which she was rapidly passing; but her thoughts di=
d not follow her eyes.=20

The miller's remark had awakened a train of painful reflections.  "Oh, that=
 it had indeed been so=20

with me!" thought poor Norah; "that I had always kept my lips pure from fal=
sehood; I would not=20

then be returning to be a burden upon my kind and generous uncle. I, whose =
character stood so=20

high, sent away in disgrace! I, whose word was at once believed! I feel as =
if I could not bear to tell=20

uncle all,--to let him know of the direct falsehood, and the deceit carried=
 on for months, my=20

mistress's trust so abused by his niece! Uncle will think that all his care=
 and kindness have been=20

thrown away upon Norah; that I am still the foolish, deceitful, bad girl th=
at I was when he first came=20

to Colme, and tried to teach me to be honest and truthful, and straightforw=
ard, as a Christian=20

should be. It seems as if I could endure anything rather than the loss of h=
is good opinion, and that=20

of dear Aunt Persis! And yet,"--thus Norah pursued her reflections, to whic=
h the miller now left her,=20

his mind being occupied in reckoning up the amount of his savings deposited=
 in the county bank of=20

B----,--"and yet, the safest, the best course for me now, must be to be per=
fectly frank and open.=20

Alas! I cannot recall the past, but I can draw from bitter experience a les=
son for the future. I will=20

confess everything to my uncle, conceal nothing, make no excuses; and oh, m=
ay the God of truth=20

help me from this time forward indeed to _take heed to my ways, that I offe=
nd not with my=20

tongue_!"  I will not dwell on the kindly welcome given to Norah Peele by P=
ersis and Ned Franks.=20

She was received as a daughter, no questions asked, no painful inquiries ma=
de as to the cause of=20

her leaving her place. "Leave the lass to tell her own story when and how s=
he likes," the one-

armed sailor had said to his wife. So the baby now happily sleeping, was sh=
own and admired;=20

topics of general interest were alone spoken of at the evening meal which f=
ollowed Franks's day of=20

toil; the state of the almshouses in Wild Rose Hollow, the progress made in=
 their repair, the=20

accident to the clerk's wife, the sudden and serious illness of Stone the c=
arpenter, the good report=20

of improvement in the health of the vicar,--all these were made subjects of=
 conversation,=20

everything being avoided which might possibly embarrass the guest. All was =
done to make her=20

feel at her ease. Norah, it was said, would be so useful in helping to nurs=
e the baby; Norah would=20

look after the flowers, now that her uncle was too busy all day to have tim=
e to work in his garden.=20



How delighted old Sarah Mason would be to have Norah to read the Bible to h=
er again!  The poor=20

girl felt grateful for the kindness and consideration thus shown her, and t=
hankful that such a home=20

was left to her still; but a burden was weighing on her mind, and even whil=
e conversation was=20

going on, in which she appeared to join, a smothered sigh, or a sudden mois=
tening of her eyes,=20

showed that her thoughts were wandering to something painful. When the tea-=
things had been=20

cleared away by the active Persis, assisted by Norah, when cups and saucers=
 had been washed=20

and replaced on the shelf, and the outer door closed for the night (it neve=
r was bolted or barred),=20

Norah sat down on a little wooden stool at the feet of her aunt, and recoun=
ted, with simple=20

truthfulness, all the circumstances that had led to her hasty dismissal fro=
m the service of Mrs.=20

Lowndes. I shall give you the story, not in Norah's words, but my own, begi=
nning it by a short=20

account of her early days in Colme.     XIV.  Norah's Story.   Norah and he=
r brother were the only=20

children of the half-sister of Ned Franks, Bessy Peele, a woman who, in eve=
ry important respect,=20

had been an utter contrast to her brother. While Ned's maxim was to do ever=
ything in clear=20

daylight, Bessy was one who, if possible, always took an underground way. H=
e considered the=20

straight road always the shortest; she wound and doubled like a fox. He was=
 convinced that=20

honesty is the best policy; she looked upon cunning as wisdom. One of the e=
arliest lessons=20

learned by Mrs. Peele's unfortunate children was that the great thing in li=
fe is to pick up money by=20

any _safe_ means; by "safe" being meant whatever would not lead to the pris=
on or the gallows.=20

There was no harm, she said, in telling a lie,--at least a _white_ lie, tha=
t hurt no one, and helped=20

one's self on in the world. What need was there to be so very particular ab=
out a little slip of the=20

tongue? She was sure, for her part, that God would not notice such trifles =
as these.  It is said that=20

some Chinese parents are actually so inhuman as to blind their children, th=
at the poor, wretched=20

creatures may earn more money by begging. Mrs. Peele, a fond though a fooli=
sh parent, would=20

have been horrified at the idea of inflicting such an injury upon her child=
ren, while actually doing=20

them a wrong yet more cruel. For was it not such to _blind their conscience=
s_, to make them=20

unable to distinguish the wrong from the right, at the risk of their walkin=
g, through the darkness of=20

their souls, into everlasting destruction? And this all for the sake of pal=
try gain, miserable profits of=20

sin, more dearly bought than the alms given to the poor blinded Chinese beg=
gars!  The mischief=20

done to the characters of Bessy Peele's children was very serious as regard=
ed her son, and had=20

Norah long remained under the roof of her mother, the principles of the you=
ng girl might, like his,=20

have been utterly ruined. Happily Norah went early into service, and became=
 the attendant of an=20

aged Christian lady, who gave her every opportunity of hearing the gospel f=
aithfully preached, and=20

made her read to her the Bible and other religious books. Under her roof  A=
s we stood listening,=20

there came a knock at the front door. It was Raoul's knock. I was sure of t=
hat.  If only Ivor had=20

arrived a quarter of an hour earlier, at the time appointed, I should have =
hurried him away before=20

this, so that I might write to Raoul; but now I could not think what to do =
for the best--what to do,=20

that things might not be made far worse instead of better between Raoul and=
 me. I had suffered so=20

much that my power of quick decision, on which I'd so often prided myself v=
aingloriously, seemed=20

gone.  "It is Raoul," I said. "What shall I do?"  "Let him in, of course, a=
nd introduce me. Don't act=20

as if you were afraid. Say that I came to see you on important business con=
cerning a friend of=20

yours in England, and had to call after the theatre because I'm leaving Par=
is by the first train in the=20

morning."  "No use."  "Why not? When a man loves a woman, he trusts her."  =
"No man of Latin=20



blood, I think. And Raoul's already angry. He has the right to be--or would=
 have, if Godensky had=20

been telling him the truth. And I refused to let him come here. I said I wa=
s going straight to bed, I=20

was so tired. He's knocking again. Hide yourself, and I'll let him in. Oh, =
_why_ do you stand there,=20

looking at me like that? Go into that room," and I pointed, then pushed him=
 towards the door. "You=20

can get through the window and out of the garden--softly--while Raoul and I=
 are talking."  "If you=20

insist," said Ivor. "But you're wrong. The best thing--"  "Go--go, I tell y=
ou. Don't argue. I know best,"=20

I cut him short, in a sharp whisper, pushing him again.  This time he made =
no more objections, but=20

went into the adjoining room, my boudoir. The key was in the door; I turned=
 it in the lock, snatched=20

it out, and dropped it into a bowl of flowers on a table close by. That don=
e, I flew out of the=20

drawing-room into the little entrance hall, and opened the front door. Ther=
e stood Raoul, his face=20

dead white, and very stern in the light of the hall lamp. I had never seen =
him like that before.  "I=20

know why you're here," I began quickly, before he could speak. "Count Goden=
sky told me what he=20

said to you. I--hoped you would come."  "Is this why you wished to know wha=
t I would do if you=20

deceived me?" he asked, with the bitterest reproach in eyes and voice.  "No=
. For I hadn't deceived=20

you," I answered. "I haven't deceived you now. If you loved me, you'd belie=
ve me, Raoul."  I put=20

out my hand and took his. He gave mine no pressure, but he let me draw him =
into the house.  "For=20

God's sake, give me back my faith in you, if you can," he said. "It's death=
 to lose it. I came here=20

wanting to die."  "After you'd killed me, as you said?"  "Perhaps. I couldn=
't keep away. I had to=20

come. If you have any explanation, for the love of Heaven, tell me what it =
is."  "You know me, and=20

you know Godensky--yet you need an explanation of anything evil said of me =
by him?" In this way=20

I hoped to disarm Raoul; but he had been half-mad, I think, and was scarcel=
y sane now, such a=20

power had jealousy over his better self.  "Don't play with me!" he exclaime=
d. "I can't bear it. You=20

sent me away. Yet you had an appointment with Godensky. You took him into y=
our carriage; and=20

now--"  "Marianne was in the carriage. If I could have had you with me, I s=
hould have packed her=20

off by herself, alone, that I--might be alone with you. Oh, Raoul, it isn't=
 _possible_ you believe that=20

I could lie to you for Godensky's sake--a man like that! If I'd cared for h=
im, why shouldn't I have=20

accepted him instead of you? Could I have changed so quickly, do you think?=
"  "I don't think; I'm=20

not able to think. I can only feel," he answered.  "Then--feel sure that I =
love you--no man but you--

now and always."  "Oh, Maxine!" he stammered. "Am I a fool, or wise, to let=
 myself believe you?"=20

"You are wise," I answered, as firmly as if I deserved the full faith I was=
 claiming from him as my=20

right. "If you wouldn't believe, without my insisting, without my explainin=
g and defending myself, I'd=20

tell you nothing. But you _do_ believe, just because you love me--I see it =
in your face, and thank=20

God for it. So I'll tell you this. Count Godensky hates me, because I could=
n't and wouldn't love him,=20

and he hates you because he thinks I love you. He--" I paused for a second.=
 A wild thought had=20

flashed like the light of a beacon in my brain. If I could say something no=
w which, when the blow=20

fell--if it did fall--might come back to Raoul's mind and convince him inst=
antly that it was=20

Godensky, not I, who had stolen the treaty and broken him! If I could make =
him believe the whole=20

thing a monstrous plot of Godensky's to revenge himself on a woman who'd re=
fused him, by=20

cleverly implicating her in her lover's ruin, by throwing guilt upon her wh=
ile she was, in reality,=20

innocent! If I could suggest that to Raoul now, while his ears were open, I=
 might hold his love=20

against the world, no matter what happened afterward.  It was a mad idea an=
d a wicked one,=20

perhaps; but I was at my wits' end and desperate. Though not guilty of this=
 one crime which I=20



would shift upon his shoulders if I could, as a means of escaping from the =
trap he'd helped to set,=20

Godensky was capable of it, and guilty of others, I was sure, which had nev=
er been brought home=20

to him. I believed that he, too, was a spy, just as I was; and far worse, b=
ecause if he were one he=20

betrayed his own country, while I never had done that, never would.  All th=
ese thoughts rushed=20

through my head in a second; and I think that Raoul could hardly have notic=
ed the pause before I=20

began to speak again.  "He--Godensky--would do anything to part you and me,=
" I said. "There's no=20

plot too sly and vile for him to conceive and carry out against me--and you=
. No lie too base for him=20

to tell you--or others--about me. He sent me a letter at the theatre--soon =
after you'd left me the first=20

time. In it, he said that I must give him a few minutes after the play, unl=
ess I wanted some dreadful=20

harm to come to _you_--something concerning your career. That frightened me=
, though I might=20

have guessed it was only a trick. Indeed, I did guess, but I couldn't be su=
re, so I saw him. I didn't=20

want you to know--I tell you that frankly, Raoul. Because I'd told you not =
to come home with me, I=20

hoped you wouldn't find out that I meant to let Count Godensky drive part o=
f the way back with me=20

and Marianne. I ran the risk, and--the very thing happened which I ought to=
 have known would=20

happen. As for what he had to tell me, it was nothing; only vague hints of =
trouble from which he, as=20

one of an inner circle, might save you, if I--would be grateful enough."  "=
The scoundrel!" broke out=20

Raoul, convinced now, his eyes blazing. "I'll--"  He stopped suddenly. But =
I knew what had been=20

on his lips to say. He meant to send a challenge to Count Godensky. I must =
prevent him from=20

doing that.  "No, Raoul," I said, as if he had finished his sentence, "you =
musn't fight. For my sake,=20

you mustn't. Don't you see, it's just what he'd like best? It would be a wa=
y of doing me the most=20

dreadful injury. Think of the scandal. Oh, you _will_ think of it, when you=
're cooler. For you, I would=20

not fear much, for I know what a swordsman you are, and what a shot--far su=
perior to Godensky,=20

and with right on your side. But I would fear=20


_
religious impressions; her young and tender heart turned towards Him of who=
se love and=20

compassion she heard so much. But, alas! the poison-seeds sown in childhood=
 had left their evil=20

roots in the soil. Norah would one hour be listening in church with tearful=
 eyes to the account of=20

Peter's sin and repentance, and the next hour be falling, _without repentan=
ce_, into a similar sin of=20

untruth! She was fearfully inconsistent,--not because she was insincere, bu=
t because she had=20

actually no clear line drawn in her mind as to where innocence ended and gu=
ilt began. Norah had=20

been led to fancy that little sins were no sins,--"white lies" no falsehood=
,--picking _not_ to be=20

classed with stealing. She wished to please a merciful God and go to heaven=
, but she felt not that=20

"I promise," he answered. "Oh, my darling, what wouldn't I promise you, to =
atone for my brutal=20

injustice to an angel? How thankful I am that I came to you to-night! I mea=
nt not to come. I was=20

afraid of myself, and what I might do. But at last I couldn't hold out agai=
nst the something that=20

seemed forcing me here in spite of all resistance. Do you forgive me?"  "As=
 a reward for your=20

promise," I said, smiling at him through tears that would come because I wa=
s worn out, and=20

because I knew that it was I who needed his forgiveness, not he mine. "Now =
are you happy=20

again?" I asked.  "Yes, I'm happy," he said. "Though on the way to this hou=
se I didn't dream that it=20

would be possible for me to know happiness any more in this world. And even=
 at your gate--" He=20

stopped=20


_
sin, if unforgiven, must end in death; that the _least_ can be washed out i=
n nothing less precious=20

than the blood of the Saviour, and that for every idle, untruthful _word_ t=
he sinner must give=20

account at the judgment.  The return to England of her maimed uncle, the sa=
ilor, at this time=20

proved a great blessing to Norah. She met with one whose standard of right =
was the Bible=20

standard,--one who spake the truth as a man who serves the God of Truth sho=
uld speak, and who=20

trampled on deceit as he would have set his heel on a venomous serpent. Nor=
ah's eyes were=20

opened to see that religious profession is but a mask if it do not influenc=
e the conduct; that to have=20

prayer on the lips at one moment and untruth at another is fearful mockery =
before God! Norah=20

Peele asked the help of the Holy Spirit to enable her to walk in the path o=
f holiness, which she now=20

found to be so much more narrow than she had before believed it to be. She =
became watchful=20

over herself,--she set a guard over her tongue; the little bark, with heave=
n's wind swelling its sails,=20

did "sheer off" from the treacherous iceberg of falsehood.  Mrs. Peele died=
 rather suddenly after a=20

few days' illness, and closed her worse than useless life with little consc=
iousness of sin, and no=20

sincere repentance. She had been a good mother, she said; God was merciful;=
 she was going to a=20

better world. The habit of a life continued to the end; and, having constan=
tly tried to deceive=20

others, poor Bessy deceived herself at the last. She had built her house on=
 the sand; there was no=20

solid foundation for her hope; she had heard the word, and done it not; wha=
t could she plead,=20

where would she stand, in the last awful day?  Very different was it with N=
orah's aged mistress,=20

when, about a year afterwards, she gently sank to rest, in humble trust tha=
t He whom she had=20

loved and served would receive her unto himself. By that holy, happy death-=
bed Norah learned a=20

lesson which she never could forget. She nursed her lady night and day, and=
, when her gentle=20

spirit was released from earthly suffering, the young servant mourned for h=
er loss with grief most=20

sincere.  Norah would then have gone home to her uncle, Ned Franks, had not=
 Mr. Lowndes, the=20

younger brother of her late mistress, at once offered to take her into the =
service of his wife. He=20

knew well, he said, changed. I waited an instant, but seeing that he didn't=
 mean to go on, I could=20

not resist questioning him. I had to know what had happened at my gate.  "E=
ven at the gate--

what?" I asked.  "Nothing. I'm sorry I spoke. I want to show you how comple=
tely I trust you now, by=20

not speaking of that."  But this reticence of his only made me more anxious=
 to hear what he had=20

been going to say. I was afraid that I could guess. But I must have it from=
 his lips, and be able to=20

explain away the mystery which, when it recurred to him in the future, migh=
t make him doubt me,=20

even though in this moment of exaltation he did not doubt.  "Yes, speak of =
it," I said. "All the more=20

because it is nothing. For it _can_ be nothing."  "I want to punish myself =
for asking an explanation=20

about Godensky, by not allowing you to explain this other thing," insisted =
poor, loyal, repentant=20

Raoul. "Then--at the time--it made all the rest seem worse, a thousand time=
s worse. But I saw=20

through black spectacles. Now I see through rose-coloured ones."  "I'd rath=
er you saw through=20

your own dear eyes, without any spectacles. You must tell me what you're th=
inking of, dear. For=20

my own sake, if not yours."  "Well--if you will know. But, remember, darlin=
g, I'm going to put it out=20

of my mind. I'll ask you no questions, I'll only--tell you the thing itself=
. As I said, I didn't come here=20

directly after seeing Godensky get into your carriage. I wandered about lik=
e a madman--and I=20

thought of the Seine."  "Oh--you must indeed have been mad!"  "I was. But t=
hat something saved=20

me--the something that drove me to find you. I walked here, by roundabout w=
ays, but always=20

coming nearer and nearer, as if being drawn into a whirlpool. At last, I wa=
s in this street, on the=20



side opposite your house. I hadn't made up my mind yet, that I would try to=
 see you. I didn't know=20

what I would do. I stood still, and tried to think. It was very black, in t=
he angle between two garden=20

walls where the big plane tree sprouts up, you know. Nobody who didn't expe=
ct to find a man=20

would have noticed me in the darkness. I hadn't been there for two minutes =
when a man turned=20

the corner, walking very fast. As he passed the street lamp just before rea=
ching the garden wall, I=20

saw him plainly--not his face, but his figure, and he was young and well dr=

of such a servant as Norah, a really high-principled girl, who would be fou=
nd honest in word as=20

well as in deed.  In entering the service of Mrs. Lowndes, Norah had made a=
 great rise in life.=20

Instead of being the general servant of a clergyman's widow, whose narrow l=
ife-income barely=20

supplied her need, Norah became the trusted attendant of the only child of =
wealthy parents, and=20

earned wages which nearly doubled what she had received before. The place w=
as one which=20

offered many other advantages. Mrs. Lowndes was strict, indeed, almost to s=
everity, but never=20

intentionally unjust. She was extremely anxious that her Selina should be k=
ept from all knowledge=20

of evil. The little girl was seldom allowed to mix with other children, les=
t she should learn any harm=20

from example. Mrs. Lowndes often Englishman. He went straight to your gate =
and rang. A moment=20

later someone, I couldn't see who, opened the gate and let him in. Involunt=
arily I took a step=20

forward, with the idea of following--of pushing my way in to see who he was=
 and who had opened=20

the gate. But I wasn't quite mad enough to act like a cad. The gate shut. O=
h, Maxine, there were=20

evil and cruel thoughts in my mind, I confess it to you--but how they made =
me suffer! I stood as if I=20

were turned to stone, and I only wished that I might be, for a stone knows =
no pain. Just then a=20

motor cab going slowly along the street stopped in front of your gate. Ther=
e were two women in it.=20

I could see them by the light of the street lamp, though not as plainly as =
I'd seen the man, and they=20

appeared to be arguing very excitedly about=20


_
habit of speaking the truth, that to her to utter a lie would be an _imposs=
ible_ thing. The lady would=20

not suffer any one to be near her darling in whose scrupulous truthfulness =
she could not place=20

perfect trust. Truth, she would say, is the very foundation on which a char=
acter must rest. She=20

would never overlook or forgive in a servant the smallest attempt to deceiv=
e.  Norah had passed=20

several pleasant months in London, in the service of Mrs. Lowndes, with the=
 consciousness that=20

she was faithfully performing her duty and giving satisfaction to her mistr=
ess, when an incident=20

occurred, which showed her more clearly than ever the importance of having =
a character for=20

truthfulness and honesty.  "Why, there's your bell and my bell a-ringing to=
gether, and rung so loud,=20

too! What can missus want us both for at once?" exclaimed Martha, the house=
maid, to Norah, who=20

was helping her, as usual, to make the bed in the little girl's room. Marth=
a's manner was been in=20

some way concerned with you, or your affairs, because they were tremendousl=
y interested in the=20

house. They both looked out, and one pointed several times. Even if I'd int=
ended to go in, I=20

wouldn't have gone while they were there. But the very fact that they _were=
_ there roused me out=20

of the kind of lethargy of misery I'd fallen into. I wondered who they were=
, and if they meant you=20

harm or good. When they had driven away I made up my mind that I would see =
you if I could. I=20

tried the gate, and found it unlocked. I walked in, and--there were lights =
in these windows. I knew=20

you couldn't have gone to bed yet, though you'd said you were so tired. The=
re was death in my=20

heart then, for you and for me, Maxine, for--the gate hadn't opened again, =
and--"  "I know what=20

you thought!" I broke in, my heart beating so now that my voice shook a lit=
tle, though I struggled to=20

seem calm. "You said to yourself, 'It was Maxine who let the man in. He is =
with her=20


_
"We'd better go and answer the bells directly," said Norah. "I hope and tru=
st that nothing's the=20

matter with dear little missy!"  The two maids entered the dining-room toge=
ther. Mr. Lowndes was=20

seated in his large red arm-chair, with his feet on the fender, and his spe=
ctacles on his nose,=20

apparently engaged in studying the _Times_. Mrs. Lowndes, a large, tall, an=
d rather formidable-

looking lady, dressed find them together.'"  "Yes," Raoul admitted. "But I =
didn't try the handle of the=20

door, as I had of the gate. I rang. I couldn't bring myself to take you una=
wares."  "Do you think still=20

that I let a man in, and hid him when I heard you ring?" I asked. (For an i=
nstant I was inclined to=20

tell the story Ivor had advised me to tell; but I saw how excited Raoul was=
; I saw how, in painting=20

the picture for me,=20
