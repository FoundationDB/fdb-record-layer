of the delinquents, but instead of effecting the capture of the offender, f=
ell flat on her face. Her=20

companion endeavoured to pick her up, but rolled over; and while the sympat=
hetic woman=20

maundered, in her intoxication, words of consolation to the disfigured paup=
er, a policeman came=20

up, and, observing their condition, took them both to the station-house.  N=
ext morning, on being=20

brought before the magistrate, they told an artful tale, which that worthy =
functionary accepted as=20

true, about having met an old friend, who treated them to a half-quartern o=
f gin (they were sure it=20

was no more), and it overcame them. They were discharged with an admonition=
, and toddled off to=20

the house, at the gate of which they parted,--the one to find her home, lik=
e an independent=20

woman; the other to sneak into her ward, and bear the gibes of her associat=
es as best she might.=20

It was some time before these women could meet again. When they did so, amo=
ng other things,=20

they talked about the fortune. Goody the pauper would have liked to have sa=
id nothing about the=20

matter, but her companion was not to be put off in that way. She had a prin=
ciple which led her to=20

argue that what people said in their cups might be regarded as their most s=
incere belief, and that=20

the words uttered in drunkenness had a truth not always attaching to the wo=
rds of soberness. She=20

persisted in her inquiries, and the result was that the pauper Goody took h=
er friend into=20

confidence.  "Why, you see here," she said, "nobody knows what may turn up.=
 I have been a lone=20

woman these many years. I have got a son, leastways I believe I have, and s=
ome day _he_ may=20

turn up, you see. I love that boy, and I have screwed and contrived for him=
; and in case any thing=20

should happen to me, why I should like to have a little money by me; so I s=
aved and put my money=20

in a savings-bank. But, then, one day I told the doctor about my money, and=
 he told me not to let it=20

be there. I asked if so be he would be so kind as to look after it for me, =
which he said yes, he=20

would do so. So I gave the money to him, and he lays it out, and gets me th=
e best interest for my=20

money, and I place that interest along with the money, which makes the mone=
y bigger, do you=20

see, every year. I have done this for many years, and now I have no doubt I=
 have got hard upon a=20

thousand pounds."  "Lor! You don't say so?"  "Yes, 'pon my honour, I have."=
  "Well, I wish I had=20

got a hundred pounds, that's all I know."  "A hundred is not much," said Go=
ody, whose ideas were=20

prone to expand on financial theories.  In this way the couple chatted, unt=
il Goody's friend became=20

almost as wise as Goody herself upon the matter of the investment, and the =
doctor's fiduciary=20

relationship became equally well known to two females as it had previously =
been known to one.=20

Now, it is said that women cannot keep a secret. I believe this doctrine is=
 not to be accepted or=20

taken as a rule without exceptions. But it is certain that Goody's friend p=
rattled and tattled long and=20

pertinaciously, although in solemn confidence, to a variety of people. At l=
ast the fact or fiction of=20

the pauper's fortune became known to Mr. Doe, a popular baker, and chairman=
 of the board of=20

guardians of the union which had the honour of maintaining out of its publi=
c funds the wealthy=20

pauper.  Mr. Doe was a man of independent mind. How he won his way, as he f=
requently had=20

occasion to say, to the distinction of a member of the vestry and chairman =
of the board of=20

guardians, was by his own talents (sometimes he said genius), and his untir=
ing energy, and his=20

uncompromising honesty. He was not the man to overlook any abuse; he was th=
e last man in the=20

world to permit a fraud to go unnoticed or unpunished. When he heard of the=
 case of this female=20

pauper with a fortune, he determined to sift it to the last. He told the st=
ory as he received it to his=20

colleagues or subordinate members of the board of guardians; and a sub-comm=
ittee was=20

appointed to investigate the matter. The clerk to the board was directed to=
 write to the doctor=20



demanding from him an explanation. Upon that the board dropped the subject =
for a fortnight, in=20

order that, as Mr. Doe said, every body might have ample opportunity for th=
eir proper defence=20

against the grave charges he had to make against them.  The doctor still he=
ld his situation of=20

medical adviser and attendant to the workhouse.  The female pauper was unfo=
rtunately ill, and at=20

the time when this outcry arose she was an inmate of the infirmary or sick-=
ward. The doctor was=20

then in attendance upon her.  When the surgeon received the letter, he was =
of course naturally=20

amazed. Long-continued success and concealment had led him to confidently b=
elieve it was=20

unknown to any body but himself that he held the money. How the secret had =
leaked out he could=20

not tell or guess. A conversation, which he found no difficulty in obtainin=
g, with the patient did not=20

help the solution of the mystery; for she, like an old sinner that she was,=
 denied having mentioned=20

the thing to a living soul. She affected to be as much in the dark as he wa=
s as to the mode in=20

which the intelligence had reached the board. She did not affect to be, but=
 really was, terribly=20

alarmed by the discovery. The doctor heightened that alarm by telling her s=
he would be=20

prosecuted and punished; no doubt sent to the treadmill; or, it might be, t=
ransported for fraud upon=20

the board of guardians. He told her that the only course for her to adopt w=
as one of entire secrecy.=20

She must deny every thing; she must declare she had never said that she had=
 money; utterly deny=20

that he had received any from her for any purpose; and if she did so, he wo=
uld back her statement=20

up by declaring that he had none of her money in his control. The poor delu=
ded wretch saw that=20

she was placing herself entirely in the hands of her doctor, and that he mi=
ght turn round upon her;=20

or at least she thought so. But still, as between the treadmill and transpo=
rtation, she hesitated to=20

run the risk of the doctor's possible fraud upon her.  The meeting of the b=
oard took place. The=20

doctor, in reply to the letter sent him, wrote a short pithy answer, declar=
ing the statement touching=20

him and the female pauper and patient to be a flimsy fabrication, which he =
thought it beneath him=20

to answer in detail. He gave his unqualified denial, and should do no more.=
 As for entering on a=20

defence against such accusations, why, his character was before the world, =
and he left the=20

guardians to judge the mere probability of such a statement as that which h=
ad been made by=20

somebody to his discredit. If the guardians felt inclined for any further i=
nformation, perhaps he=20

might be disposed to give it; but his present opinion was, that he should n=
ot.  The female pauper=20

on being brought up before the guardians for examination,--or, to speak mor=
e correctly, a=20

deputation of the board, or its committee, waited at her bedside,--she stou=
tly denied every thing.=20

She declared most solemnly that she had no money, and away with the growing=
 current. The=20

simple folk have abandoned them. Some have made their way to the levees, ho=
ping for a passing=20

steamer. Others, dwelling above the crevasse, have little to fear from curr=
ents; and as the water=20

rises around them, they take to hastily constructed rafts, transferring the=
ir few household effects=20

thereto, and dwelling for days in a floating camp, sheltered from the rain =
by a wagon-sheet or old=20

quilts stretched over a low ridge-pole. Mooring the rafts to trees, they le=
ad, to others a romantic, to=20

themselves a precarious existence.  [Illustration: NOT SO ROMANTIC AS IT LO=
OKS.]  A whole=20

village deserted by its people wears a singularly melancholy aspect. Let th=
e reader row with a=20

press correspondent through the little town of Bayou Sara La, as it appeare=
d during the recent=20

overflow. The town lies on rolling ground, dotted here and there with low h=
ills or drifts of sand and=20

alluvial deposits, left thereby the floods of ages ago.  =E2=80=9CEven over=
 the center of the roadway back=20

from the front street, which is just behind the levee, it is unusual to fin=
d less than four feet of water,=20



while in many places a nine-foot oar can not be made to touch bottom. In so=
me of what, in times of=20

low water, are beautiful residence streets, the boat as it went gliding on =
the shining moonlight flood=20

would pass so close under the spreading branches of the great live oaks, wh=
ich interlock their=20

boughs over the roadway, that her occupants would be compelled to bend down=
 almost level with=20

the gunwales to avoid being swept off the thwarts. The freaks of the curren=
ts wandering through=20

the flooded streets seem wholly unaccountable. Sometimes they would run par=
allel with, and at=20

others directly at right angles to the streets. Often progress would be blo=
cked by long sections of=20

wooden-plank sidewalks, gates, doors and cisterns that had formed barriers =
across the street,=20

while at every turning the boatman would be compelled to dodge huge floatin=
g masses of drift in=20

which out-houses, timbers, sections of roofs and other heavy wreckage inext=
ricably commingling=20

were slowly floating on the lazy current.  =E2=80=9CThe air was soft and ba=
lmy as that of a midsummer=20

night, and the mellow light of the young moon that was already hanging low =
over the great sand=20

hills to the westward, spread a soft pale light of deep blue on the bright =
spangled sky. There were=20

faint night breezes waving the topmost branches of the great shade trees, b=
ut they did not touch=20

the rippleless, shining flood which gleamed in long narrow paths. The white=
 moonbeams that, like=20

ribbons of burnished silver, but slept inky and motionless under the black =
shadows of the trees,=20

and the rounded outlines of each great shade tree was sharply reflected in =
the mirror-like surface=20

of the water and bordered by a dainty rim of silver. Houses with snow-white=
 walls were faithfully=20

mirrored in that motionless, glittering flood. While to the eastward of eac=
h lay a long, deep=20

shadow--a starless night--huge shapeless masses of wreckage drifting past b=
lack opaque=20

shadows that grew longer and more intense as the young moon sank so low tha=
t her lower horizon=20

was dipping behind a great hoary-crested sand hill in the west. The scene w=
as exquisitely=20

beautiful, but at the same time weird and uncanny. Not a human voice was he=
ard, but near at=20

hand between the lower whispering of the softly dipping oars came the ever =
varying chorus of the=20

frogs mingling with the low musical murmuring of the mighty river and the d=
eep sullen roar of the=20

crevasse on the far off southern shore. There the sides of the skiff would =
brush the perfumed=20

shrubbery of a submerged lawn; there could be seen the tree-tops of a splen=
did orchard just rising=20

out of the flood, their lower limbs swaying and bending with the current. I=
n all this scene of=20

beautiful ruins there was a sense of utter loneliness that was strangely op=
pressive. Of those who a=20

week ago filled this bright and hustling little town to overflowing, only s=
ix families remain. The=20

others have all fled to the adjoining hills, leaving their houses to their =
fate till the water shall have=20

subsided.=E2=80=9D  Such villages as are not deserted have little to do wit=
h the world beyond. The post-

offices are often exhausted, in addition to the fact that the nearest point=
s not blockaded are miles=20

away; so that the telegraph only brings  [Illustration: TELEGRAPHING UNDER =
DIFFICULTIES.]=20

news from beyond, or tells the world how fares the little hamlet. The opera=
tor may be driven to the=20

upper story, or to the roof, there to dispute possession with stray turtles=
 or snakes, or to listen to=20

the hoarse remonstrance of some old bullfrog whose nocturnal rest is broken=
 by the clicking of the=20

key. All around is a dreary waste of water, on which the gleam of the moon =
appears like a ghostly=20

foot-path, and the dark shadows of the naked-limbed trees menace like gaunt=
 spectres. From his=20

elevated position the operator may see the flash of the search-light of a s=
teamer miles away, as=20

the vessel flits along the stream, collecting refugees from the shores; and=
 ever and anon the deep=20

harsh bray of the fog-horn breaks the stillness. Save for these distant tok=
ens of life there is=20



=E2=80=9CDeath and silence! death and silence!      Death and silence all a=
round!=E2=80=9D  At the great crevasse=20

itself the spectacle is exciting. The fight is not abandoned. Desperate eff=
orts are made to secure=20

the ends from further washing. That once done, there is hope of closing the=
 gap. At the extremity=20

of the break a floating pile-driver is fiercely hammering heavy timbers int=
o the spongy soil. There a=20

tiny, fussing tug is engaged in trying to float a mat of brushwood against =
the broken bank, while a=20

score of anxious men are watching an opportunity to peg it down. Others end=
eavor to weave pliant=20

branches among the driven piles to afford a better hold for the guano sacks=
 of earth that are being=20

thrown into the break. From these moist earth is often washed out by the po=
werful current as=20

though it were melting sugar; while now and then some timber, undermined by=
 the steadily=20

deepening current, leaps upward as though endowed with a life of its own, a=
nd dashes away on=20

the foaming stream. After hours of the fierce contest, the ends are at last=
 secured. The pigmy has=20

stopped the giant. The work progresses more easily, now that the workers ar=
e sure of their=20

ground. The stubborn creatures contest every inch of space. The roar of the=
 battle goes up=20

incessantly. One fights for life, the other for liberty--such liberty as th=
e tyrant asks of his subjects;=20

such liberty as the wolf asks of the sheep, or the hawk of the doves; such =
liberty as the strong has=20

always demanded of the weak and defenseless.  By and by the voice of the st=
ruggling monster=20

grows weaker. The persistent creatures that swarm about him assault him wit=
h renewed vigor and=20

pertinacity. The roar of the conflict dies away by degrees. Step by step th=
e two bands of men=20

approach each other. Only a narrow channel=20


_
inquirer, if she had such money, would she be there, in that wretched infir=
mary, on their bed, in=20

unsavoury pauperism, and taking the noxious workhouse physic? One member of=
 the deputation=20

was convinced that the chairman had led them on a wild-goose chase: that th=
e woman had no=20

such fortune as had been represented; that the whole affair was a bag of mo=
onshine. Another had=20

no opinion at all; he said, in frankness, that he did not know what to make=
 of the matter; and a=20

third had a notion directly contrary to the first, and thought the ratepaye=
rs had been swindled for a=20

long while; that the chairman of the board was quite right, and that the ma=
tter ought to be further=20

looked into.  It unfortunately happened between the date of this inquiry of=
 the baker and the=20

deputation that the pauper died. Poor creature! she expired under the treat=
ment of her friend and=20

conspirator against the ratepayers,--the Workhouse Doctor. That death was a=
 godsend to him, for=20

it practically stopped all further investigation.  The chairman of the boar=
d of guardians, Mr. Doe, at=20

the meeting when the report of the committee was brought up, expressed hims=
elf dissatisfied; he=20

said he thought he smelt a rat; he had his suspicions that the doctor had g=
ot the woman's money;=20

he was sure, almost certain, that the ratepayers had been robbed. He would =
like to have the whole=20

thing out, and at once. He did not like that evasive letter of their surgeo=
n's; he should like that=20

gentleman brought before them at once, and be asked to explain. If he came,=
 and did explain, well=20

and good; Mr. Doe would not object to apologise when he had been convinced =
that he had been in=20

the wrong. Until he was so convinced, he should hold his own opinion, and v=
indicate it. The upshot=20

of the whole investigation of this worthy, and energetic, and prosperous, a=
nd dignified tradesman=20

was, that the surgeon was sent for by a special messenger, and that he atte=
nded their=20

deliberations at the board meeting I have last referred to. He manifested a=
 lofty spirit of mock=20

dignity. He protested against the outrage to which he had been subjected by=
 their suspicions and=20

by their demand, and by having him arraigned before them like a criminal at=
 a public tribunal. He=20

did not know that he was doing at all right in noticing these charges; but =
concluded by laying his=20

hand melodramatically upon his heart, offering many objurgations, and ultim=
ately, in the most=20

familiar way, offering to prove--as he did prove, to the satisfaction of th=
e majority, and the=20

dissatisfaction of the minority, of the board--that the tattle of the chair=
man's informant was a tissue=20

of falsehood, or the wild imaginings of a lunatic.  The moments there remai=
ns but a tiny,=20

remonstrant, murmuring trickle of water. Another stroke and it is finished.=
 The pigmy has=20

conquered the giant. The ant has chained the elephant.  But what, in the me=
antime, has been the=20

fate of the district along the levee front? Here the water does not rise sl=
owly and stealthily as in the=20

regions far inland, where the force of the current is lost. The planters an=
d all their available forces,=20

it may be, have been busily fighting the rising floods, but have been final=
ly vanquished=20

momentarily by wind and wave. Hoping to hold the levee, few, perhaps, have =
removed their=20

families, goods, or chattels, or livestock. Then when the break comes, the =
raging flood rushes in=20

over the fields and woods, demolishing out-houses, shaking cottages, drowni=
ng stock, hurling=20

masses of drift against dwellings that might otherwise stand--seeming as th=
ough a living genius of=20

destruction.  Here a family, carrying only a few changes of clothes, and a =
purse but too scantily=20

filled, hurry wildly toward the river front, in hope that a passing steamer=
 may pick them up; there a=20

planter who has saved his family is hurrying a drove of cattle to the levee=
, vaguely wondering, in=20

the mean time, how he shall feed them if the flood lasts long; here a negro=
 family, chattering=20

noisily like frightened crows, trudges through water and mire knee-deep or =
waist-deep, bearing on=20



their heads bundles of dirty bedding, or old clothes--one or two lugging sa=
cks of meal and flitches=20

of bacon, with a blind confidence that they  [Illustration: RESCUING PEOPLE=
 IN INLAND=20

DISTRICTS.]  have made sufficient provision for every emergency. There a fo=
rlorn squatter is=20

punting a rude raft with his few belongings slowly athwart the restless flo=
od. Yonder a band of=20

negroes, unaware of the break in time to reach the river, have congregated =
in an old gin house,=20

and swarm upon its roof, yelling and gesticulating wildly in their terror, =
for aid, which they fear will=20

never reach them; and, as the water rises higher, roofs, barns, hen-coops, =
and carcasses go=20

floating past or lodge against their frail support, increasing their peril =
every moment. Some moan=20

and cry; others pray vigorously, confessing their misdeeds with voluble fre=
edom; occasionally=20

there is some old crone who terrifies her auditors with the assertion that =
=E2=80=9Cde Lord is sendin=E2=80=99=20

another =E2=80=99varsal flood on men for deir wickedness,=E2=80=9D at which=
 the wicked groan and cry, and the=20

pious clap their hands and shout, trusting to shortly see the salvation of =
the Lord. In the distance=20

appear a few figures perched in trees, seeming like enormous crows; over yo=

unfortunate has shinned up a telegraph pole,=20

resolution, passed by a majority of the board, expressing confidence in the=
ir medical officer,=20

embodying an opinion that he had been unjustly aspersed, and requesting him=
 to continue to=20

bestow upon the paupers of the union under the control of that board of gua=
rdians his eminent=20

services and truly Christian-like mercies.     THE MISSING WILL.   Mr. Fran=
klin was a solicitor in=20

good practice at the West End of London, having offices at ---- Chambers, R=
egent Street, and a=20

private residence near Fulham. He was a man of somewhat peculiar habits, al=
though very shrewd,=20

able in his profession, and generous towards his friends--who were not a fe=
w. His domestic life=20

had been far from comfortable. He had been separated from his wife, through=
 incompatibility of=20

temper; and that lady, with one of her children, lived in a distant part of=
 the metropolis, upon a=20

liberal allowance from his purse.  This description will cover the life and=
 pursuits of Mr. water,=20

threatening constantly to return the trembling refugee to the flood beneath=
. The last unfortunates=20

have straggled to the levee. The rest must wait for relief. Here and there =
a few cattle stand lowing=20

in water half over their sides; a restless, snorting horse plunges impatien=
tly about. A floating tree-

trunk strikes them from their hillock, to swim aimlessly about till other d=
rifting masses ride them=20

down. A hen-coop floats past, on which a hungry chanticleer is perched, occ=
asionally challenging=20

the flood, and in the meantime, with sidelong glance eyeing the confusion a=
nd in undertones=20

discussing the case with his half-starved, feathered harem.  It is a motley=
 throng that huddles=20

along the levee. That narrow strip of earth, but eight feet wide at best, i=
s  [Illustration: CAMPS ON=20

avily at their feet; or=20

sometimes, as the wind blows stronger, they leap clear over=20


_
a series of about fifteen years. All this while, and probably much earlier =
than the beginning of this=20

epoch, he saved a considerable portion of his earnings, and invested it wit=
h that success a=20

prudent lawyer was able to command. He was not, it is true, what is called =
a speculative or=20

"enterprising" man. He was rather a plodding or hard-working man. He had a =
notion that lawyers=20

ought not to engage in risks, lest they should be tempted, in the frenzy of=
 greed, or to cover some=20

unusual loss, to use the money which clients might by necessity or choice l=
eave in their hands. He=20

never made "lumps of money," but grew rich by slow degrees, as the accumula=
ted instalments of=20

his frugality were piled on each other, and as the usufruct thereof, year b=
y year, swelled the total=20

of his husbanded gains.  At the head of his staff or firm was a managing cl=
erk; and at the top of his=20

rather small establishment in the country was a housekeeper. In both these =
persons Mr. Franklin=20

had the utmost confidence. That comfortable feeling, I suppose, grew out of=
 long experience; but it=20

was not one I found it possible to share on my first introduction to these =
worthy persons. The clerk=20

exhibited all the salient features of his calling. He was cunning, reticent=
, and conceited. I dare say=20

he was faithful to his master. Fidelity is a peculiar merit of the attorney=
's clerk. I have known many=20

in my time, but never knew one treacherous to his master; and never heard, =
on reliable authority,=20

of one who betrayed a client's secret. I have often had occasion to know th=
at bribes have been=20

offered to the wretched copyist, whose earnings have probably not averaged =
a pound per week;=20

and to office-lads, whose wages were but a few shillings--bribes equal to a=
t least a quarter's=20

honest income--but not a secret could be extracted in this mode. I have oft=
en mused on this=20

phenomenon, but never could fully understand the exact relation between the=
 cause and the=20

effect. The reader is perhaps a better psychologist than I am, and can expl=
ain it. I leave clayey,=20

slippery dykes are planters, once well-to-do, with families of culture and =
refinement; others of a=20

middle class, and occasional specimens of a type denominated by the =E2=80=
=9Cman and brother=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=9Cpo=E2=80=99=20

white trash=E2=80=9D are to be seen among the throng. The =E2=80=9Cman and =
brother=E2=80=9D is usually in the majority in=20

the lowland districts, and adds greatly to the picturesqueness of the levee=
s in time of flood. Some=20

rear their tiny excuses for tents along the bank, and spend the time in une=
asily watching the turbid=20

water. Occasionally some Dinah or Chloe, who has been on the levee for a we=
ek, goes through=20

the motion of washing clothes in the surging stream, gaining thereby the ap=
proval of conscience=20

over a duty performed, whether the garments be improved or not. Here there =
is little concern,=20

these being wandering roustabouts who had nothing to lose; there some grizz=
led Uncle Tom=20

bemoans the loss of his two scrawny mules, and the few pigs and fowls, and =
his favorite cow,=20

which represent the savings of years from his toil in his little patch of c=
orn and cotton; and he feels=20

even sorer over his losses than the rich planter who has lost a hundred tim=
es as much. So the little=20

bands assemble, mingle and disperse, comparing notes, and all waiting in pa=
inful anxiety for some=20

steamer to pick them up before the sodden levee shall dissolve beneath thei=
r feet and leave them=20

struggling in the stream. At length the government relief boat appears, and=
 gathers the throngs by=20

hundreds, to transport them to higher lands. Beyond the levee, skiffs and f=
lat-boats move about=20

the submerged region, picking up the people who have taken refuge on the ho=
usetops, among the=20

trees, or on piles of drift. None on the levee fear being passed in the nig=
ht, for the powerful search-

light illuminates every straggling group.  [Illustration: WAITING FOR A STE=
AMER.]  On reaching a=20

place of safety from the waters, scores of the refugees are almost penniles=
s, and the question of=20

food is a pressing one. The liberal contributions of scores of generous sou=

_
head--merely vouching for it as a fact. As I have said, there was this fait=
hful clerk at the head of=20

the staff in Mr. Franklin's office.  The housekeeper who presided over the =
domestic economy of=20

the lawyer's dwelling was a very ordinary sort of person. She was somewhere=
 about forty-eight or=20

fifty years of age. She was rather tall, and somewhat bulky in form. Her fe=
atures were a little=20

harsh, her voice was not one that could be described as musical, and her ma=
nners were not of=20

that order denominated ladylike. She also was a faithful servant--or at lea=
st she very often told me=20

so, and I have no evidence to the contrary. She declared to me, soon after =
my introduction to her,=20

that she had never robbed the good man (that is, her then late master) of a=
 penny. She had=20

always laid out his money to the best advantage, never got a commission fro=
m the tradesmen who=20

supplied butter, cheese, eggs, or other comestibles; and, in fact, never pl=
undered him after the=20

manner of her sisterhood. She was in fact--I take it for granted, and ask t=
he reader to assume--a=20

model housekeeper.  This is a censorious and scandalmongering age. I cannot=
, I fear, rely upon it=20

that my pages may not fall short time. The government must again come to th=
e front, and issue=20

rations, or a money equivalent, sufficient to maintain the destitute till t=
he falling of the waters=20

allows them to resume labor upon their lands. After that, the crop-lien sys=
tem in vogue in the=20

South enables the people to get credit of their merchants until the cotton-=
picking or corn-gathering.=20

[Illustration: THE SEARCH-LIGHT.]  When the waters subside, and the people =
return, it is often=20

difficult to find old landmarks. In one place huge trenches may be washed o=
ut; but away from the=20

immediate vicinity of the crevasse the land is covered with mud, varying fr=
om a few inches to four=20

or five feet in thickness--sufficient guarantee of amazing fertility, when =
the ground becomes dry=20

enough to work. In the numerous little depressions in the surface are stagn=
ant pools that linger for=20

a month or two. The larger ones, if not before filled, are converted into p=
onds or marshes, which=20

only thorough draining will destroy. The air is tainted by the hundreds of =
carcasses that are=20

entangled in the heaps of drift. The hot dank soil, steaming under the summ=
er sun, brings disease=20

in the wake of the flood.  Louisiana, from its=20


_
persons always ready to suspect and say ill of their neighbours. Let me, th=
erefore, at once clearly=20

and emphatically state, that no relationship whatever subsisted between Mr.=
 Franklin and this lady=20

but the ostensible one of master and servant. On this head there ought to b=
e no doubt.  Mr.=20

Franklin one day, after a short illness, died.  The fact of his death was a=
lmost immediately=20

communicated to his relatives and friends, who mingled Arkansas borders far=
e little better. All=20

along the course of the stream the land is dotted with lakes and pools and =
marshy lands, created=20

by former overflows. Along the lower portion of the river bayous or sloughs=
 open from either bank,=20

and meander lazily toward the gulf. As showing the character of the country=
 may be mentioned the=20

Little and St. Francis Rivers, which flow southward from southeast Missouri=
, nearly parallel to the=20
