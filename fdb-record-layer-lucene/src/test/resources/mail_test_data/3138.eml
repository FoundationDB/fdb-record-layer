dracaena marginata to ask him to let me do that and was already prepared. So I came off with flying colors and probably got more credit for readiness than I deserved.  I quote from the "History" at page 285:  "In describing his first official visit to Serve it hot, but it is properly a side-board Dish, and the Carver ought always to take the Services, of the Pasty, from the Corners where the Fat is, to do honour to the Master and his Park.    To roast a _Hog's_ Harslet. From the dracaena marginata to ask him to let me do that and was already prepared.

can wear a shirt for a whole week."  Jeremiah Mason told of a professional conference between 

himself, when quite a young man, and Mr. Parsons before he became Chief Justice. Among the 

elements in the case was a conveyance of parish land by a clergyman, and its nature and effect 

were under discussion. Mr. Mason suggested that it might be held to be a covenant to stand 

seized. Mr. Parsons turned to him quickly and said: "Mason, I like that; that is a good idea of 

yours; in the relation between a clergyman and his parish there is some analogy to that between a 

man and his wife." Mr. Mason, in telling the story, said: "I didn't know, or had forgotten, that a 

consideration of blood or marriage was necessary to support a covenant to stand seized, but I said 

nothing, and as soon as I got home I took down my books and began to study the subject, and 

found the blood spurting out between the very lines of the page."  It is grateful to recall the 

remaining member of the Triumvirate, Professor Emery Washburn, for he was an enthusiast, an 

indomitable and joyous worker at the age of sixty-three. I do not say that Parker and Parsons were 

not enthusiasts in their own way. They must have been so to accomplish what they did, but neither 

Parker nor Parsons manifested and imparted the contagious enthusiasm about their daily work 

which carried Washburn and the class with him along the arid path of the law of real estate. He 

and chop it pretty small; then take a Pound of Raisins of the Sun, and stone them; then shred 

them, and mix them together: add to them a large spoonfull of Flour, and six Eggs beaten, a little 

_Lisbon_ Sugar, some Salt, and some Cloves, and Mace, beaten. Then mix these well together, 

and make two Puddings of them, tied up in Cloths well flour'd; boil them six Hours, and serve them 

with Sugar and Butter in Cups. This will cut very firm, and not taste at all greasy. And if you save 

one cold, cut it in Slices, and lay it upon a Grid-Iron, under Beef while it is roasting, and it eats very 

well with Beef Gravey hot.    To make a _Venison_ Pasty. From the same.  Take six Pounds of 

Cambridge potted Butter, and rub it into a peck of Flour, but do not rub in your Butter too small; 

and then make it into a Paste, with Water: then butter your Pan well, and when your Paste is roll'd 

out thick, lay it in the Pan, preserving only enough for the Lid. The _Cambridge_ Butter is 

mention'd, because it is a little Salt; or else, if you use fresh Butter, there should be some Salt put 

into the Crust. When that is prepar'd, take a side of Venison, and take off the Skin, as close as can 

be, and take the Bones out quite free from the Flesh; then cut this through length-ways, and cut it 

cross again, to make four Pieces of it; then strew these Pieces with Pepper and Salt, well mix'd, at 

discretion: and after having laid a little of the Pepper and Salt at the bottom of the Pasty, with 

some pieces of Butter; then lay in your

Worcester and Governor of the Commonwealth, and was the author of valuable law books, with 

which the profession is familiar. I had a piece of good luck with him in my first and only Moot Court 

case. As I stood up to open the case, Professor Washburn, sitting as judge, said: "Mr. Adams, 

instead of reading the printed case, suppose you just state the facts in your own that at each 

Corner the Fat may be placed; then lay some Butter over it, in pieces, and close your Pasty. When 

it is ready for the Oven, pour in about a Quart of Water, and let it bake from five a Clock in the 

Morning till one in the Afternoon, in a hot Oven. And at the same time put the Skin and the Bones 

broken, with Water enough to cover them, and some Pepper and Salt into a glaz'd earthen Pan, 

into the same Oven; and when you draw the Pasty, pour off as
