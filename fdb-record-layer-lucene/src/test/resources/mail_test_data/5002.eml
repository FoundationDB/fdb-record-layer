performers occasionally moved from city to city, exhibiting a Mystery, but =
they did not hold=20

together when the occasion had passed. Professional comedians were brought =
from Italy to Lyons=20

in 1548, for the entertainment of Henri II. and Catherine de Medicis. From =
that date companies of=20

French actors appear to become numerous. New species of the drama--tragedy,=
 comedy,=20

pastoral--replace the mediaeval forms; but much of the genius of French cla=
ssical comedy is a=20

development from the Morality, the _sottie_, and the farce. To present thes=
e newer forms the=20

service of trained actors was required. During the last quarter of the sixt=
eenth century the amateur=20

performers of the ancient drama finally disappear.  [Footnote 3: This corpo=
ration, known as the=20

_Royaume de la Basoche_ (_basilica_), was probably as old as the fourteenth=
 century.]     BOOK=20

THE SECOND _THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY_     CHAPTER I RENAISSANCE AND=20

REFORMATION   The literature of the sixteenth century is dominated by two c=
hief influences--that=20

of the Renaissance and that of the Reformation. When French armies under Ch=
arles VIII. and=20

Louis XII. made a descent on Italy, they found everywhere a recognition of =
the importance of art,=20

an enthusiasm for beauty, a feeling for the aesthetic as well as the schola=
rly aspects of antiquity, a=20

new joy in life, an universal curiosity, a new confidence in human reason. =
To Latin culture a Greek=20

culture had been added; and side by side with the mediaeval master of the u=
nderstanding,=20

Aristotle, the master of the imaginative reason, Plato, was held in honour.=
 Before the first quarter=20

of the sixteenth century closed, France had received a great gift from Ital=
y, which profoundly=20

modified, but by no means effaced, the characteristics of her national geni=
us. The Reformation=20

was a recovery of Christian antiquity and of Hebraism, and for a time the r=
eligious movement=20

made common cause with the Renaissance; but the grave morals, the oppositio=
n of grace to=20

nature, and the dogmatic spirit of theology after a time alienated the Refo=
rming party from the=20

mere humanism of literature and art. An interest in general ideas and a cap=
acity for dealing with=20

them were fostered by the study of antiquity both classical and Christian, =
by the meeting of various=20

tendencies, and by the conflict of rival creeds. To embody general ideas in=
 art under a presiding=20

feeling for beauty, to harmonise thought and form, was the great work of th=
e seventeenth century;=20

but before this could be effected it was necessary that France should enjoy=
 tranquillity after the=20

strife of the civil wars.  Learning had received the distinction of court p=
atronage when Louis XII.=20



appointed the great scholar Bude his secretary. Around Francis I., although=
 he was himself rather=20

a lover of the splendour and ornament of the Renaissance than of its finer =
spirit, men of learning=20

and poets gathered. On the suggestion of GUILLAUME BUDE he endowed professo=
rships of=20

Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, to which were added those of medicine, mathematic=
s, and philosophy=20

(1530-40), and in this projected foundation of the College de France an imp=
ortant step was made=20

towards the secularisation of learned studies. The King's sister, MARGUERIT=
E OF NAVARRE=20

(1492-1549), perhaps the most accomplished woman of her time, represents mo=
re admirably than=20

Francis the genius of the age. She studied Latin, Italian, Spanish, German,=
 Hebrew, and, when=20

forty, occupied herself with Greek. Her heart was ardent as well as her int=
ellect; she was gay and=20

mundane, and at the same time she was serious (with even a strain of mystic=
al emotion) in her=20

concern for religion. Although not in communion with the Reformers, she sym=
pathised with them,=20

and extended a generous protection to those who incurred danger through the=
ir liberal opinions.=20

Her poems, _Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses_ (1547), show the m=
ediaeval=20

influences forming a junction with those of the Renaissance. Some are relig=
ious, but side by side=20

with her four dramatic Mysteries and her eloquent _Triomphe de l'Agneau_ ap=
pears the _Histoire=20

des Satyres et Nymphes de Diane_, imitated from the Italian of Sannazaro. A=
mong her latest=20

poems, which remained in manuscript until 1896, are a pastoral dramatic pie=
ce expressing her=20

grief for the death of her brother Francis I.; a second dramatic poem, _Com=
edie jouee au Mont de=20

Marsan_, in which love (human or divine) triumphs over the spirit of the wo=
rld, over superstitious=20

asceticism, and over the wiser temper of religious moderation. _Les Prisons=
_ tells in allegory of=20

her servitude to passion, to worldly ambition, and to the desire for human =
knowledge, until at last=20

the divine love brought her deliverance. The union of the mundane and the m=
oral spirit is=20

singularly shown in Marguerite's collection of prose tales, written in imit=
ation of Boccaccio, the=20

_Heptameron des Nouvelles_ (1558).  These tales were not an indiscretion of=
 youth; probably=20

Marguerite composed them a few years before her death; perhaps their licenc=
e and wanton mirth=20

were meant to enliven the melancholy hours of her beloved brother; certainl=
y the writer is=20

ingenious in extracting edifying lessons from narratives which do not promi=
se edification. They are=20

not so gross as other writings of the time, and this is Marguerite's true d=
efence; to laugh at the=20

immoralities of monks and priests was a tradition in literature which neith=
er the spirit of the=20

Renaissance nor that of the Reformation condemned. A company of ladies and =

 telling these tales, and=20

the pious widow Dame Oisille gives excellent assistance in showing how they=
 tend to a moral=20

purpose. The series, designed to equal in number the tales of the Decameron=
, is incomplete.=20

Possibly Marguerite was aided by some one or more of the authors of whom sh=
e was the=20

patroness and protector; but no sufficient evidence exists for the ascripti=
on of the _Heptameron_=20

to Bonaventure des Periers.  Among the poets whom Marguerite received with =
favour at her court=20

was CLEMENT MAROT, the versifier, as characterised by Boileau, of "elegant =
badinage." His=20

ingenuities of versification and pedantry of diction; or else they carried =
on something of the more=20

be remembered less for his verse than for his prose work, _Illustrations de=

and a mass of crude erudition. Clement Marot, born at Cahors in 1495 or 149=
