He held a numerous council at Douay on this subject, with many of the noble=
s of his countries,=20

when it was unanimously resolved, that he should personally wait on the kin=

expedition against Calais should be renewed the ensuing spring. He went, in=
 consequence, to=20

Paris, nobly attended. He made strong remonstrances to the king, the duke o=
f Berry, his uncle,=20

and others of the king=E2=80=99s council, and heavy complaints for their ha=
ving allowed him to establish=20

identity that it seems almost superfluous to mention them, except for the p=
urpose of deciding=20

whether the wounds were made during life or after death. In the matter of g=
unshot wounds on=20

persons who took part in the late Civil War, many of whom unfortunately bel=
ong to the vagrant=20

class and are often found dead, their wounds sometimes afford excellent mea=

In many instances the multiple character of these wounds is almost incredib=

ordering him to disband it, when on the point of marching to Calais.  The k=
ing, however, and his=20

ministers, gently appeased his wrath, by informing him of many particulars =
which had made it=20

proper that such measures as he complained of should have been taken, both =
from necessity and=20

convenience. He was apparently satisfied with their reasons; and he was giv=

within a short time the king would permit him to accomplish his object of b=

CHAP. XXX.      THE PRELATES AND CLERGY OF FRANCE ARE SUMMONED TO ATTEND=20

THE         KING AT PARIS, ON THE SUBJECT OF AN UNION OF THE CHURCH.   At t=
his period,=20

all the archbishops, bishops, and the principal clergy of France and Dauphi=
ny, were summoned to=20

Paris by order of the king, to confer with his great council on the means o=
f establishing an=20

universal union of the church. When all, or the greater part, were arrived,=
 as the health of the king=20

was very indifferent, a grand procession was made, and a solemn mass to the=
 Holy Ghost was=20

celebrated in the royal chapel of the palace, by the archbishop of Rheims. =
 On the morrow, the=20

conference was held at the palace, when the duke of Acquitaine, dauphin of =
Vienne, represented=20

the king. He was attended by the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Bourbon, and =
many of the nobles.=20

A learned Cordelier, doctor in theology in the university of Paris, opened =
the business, and=20

explained the reasons of this assembly. He eloquently stated from facts the=
 sufferings of the=20

church, from the great perversity and who was literally wounded from the cr=
own of his head to the=20

sole of his foot, the scars being fifty-two in number.  WOUNDS MADE DURING =
LIFE might show=20

the suggillation peculiar to bruises or traces of inflammation. Besides, th=
e gaping nature of the lips=20

of the wound, the fact of hemorrhage having taken place and the coagulation=
 of the blood, the=20

infiltration of blood into the cellular tissue, etc., are surgical facts th=
at would leave but little doubt=20

as to the infliction of the wounds during life.  The _cause of death_ is of=
ten a difficult matter to=20

determine, as it may have been accidental, suicidal, or the result of homic=
ide. The causes relating=20

thereto are, moreover, so many and varied that space and time compel a refe=
rence to other=20

headings of this work. In forming an opinion as to _the probable date of de=
ath_ the extent of=20

putrefaction is the chief guide. If death is quite recent, we may be guided=
 by the post-mortem=20

rigidity or the extent to which the body has cooled. The march of putrefact=
ive decomposition=20

would, of course, be regulated by circumstances. It takes place very rapidl=
y in persons who have=20

succumbed to excessive fatigue or to any disassimilative excesses or derang=
ement resulting in=20

ante-mortem change of the tissues, such as those occurring in virulent or i=
nfectious diseases. The=20

body of an infant decays more rapidly that that of an adult. The course of =
putrefactive phenomena=20

is also influenced by the seasons, the extent of the exposure to air, and t=
o other mesological=20

causes. There is a manifest difference in the special putrefactive change a=
ccordingly as a body is=20

buried in the earth, submerged in a fluid,=20


_
it was absolutely necessary to provide a speedy remedy, otherwise the churc=
h would be ruined.=20

On the day after the feast of St Eloy, the king, having recovered his healt=
h, attended this=20

conference, accompanied by the noble persons before mentioned, and was seat=
ed on his royal=20

throne. He promised to execute whatever this assembly and the court of parl=
iament should resolve=20

on; and shortly afterward, a proclamation was made throughout the realm, th=
at neither of the=20

contending popes should dispose of any benefices or dignities in the church=
 which might become=20

vacant; and likewise that the sums of money usually paid into the apostolic=
al chamber should be=20

discontinued to both the rival popes. It was also cesspool, or buried in a =
dung-heap.  In certain=20

cases, especially where the body has been much mutilated, it may be desirab=
le to know whether=20

there was _one or several murderers_. While no definite rule can be laid do=
wn on this point, we=20

are justified in supposing that there were two or more assassins when the b=
ody of the victim=20

shows both gunshot and knife wounds, or that two persons were concerned in =
the dismemberment=20

and mutilation of a body which shows the simultaneous presence of parts ski=
lfully cut, while others=20

show evident awkwardness.  Where there is _more than one mortal wound_ on t=
he same dead=20

body, a question of medico-legal significance may arise. This occurred in t=
he Burton murder case=20

at=20


_
sovereign, or legal patrons, as had been formerly done, before the reservat=
ions and constitutions=20

made by pope Clement VI. of the name.                                   CHA=
P. XXXI.      THE LIEGEOIS=20

EJECT THEIR BISHOP, JOHN OF BAVARIA, FOR         REFUSING TO BE CONSECRATED=

A CHURCHMAN, ACCORDING TO         HIS PROMISE.   This same year, John of Ba=
varia,=20

surnamed =E2=80=98sans piti=C3=A9,=E2=80=99 bishop of Liege, and brother ge=
rman to duke William, count of Hainault, was=20

he had promised and sworn to them. discussion of the following abstract que=
stion: =E2=80=9CWhether it is=20

possible for an individual, with suicidal intent, and in quick succession, =
to inflict a perforating shot=20

of the head and another of the chest implicating the heart. Or, reversing t=
he proposition, is it=20

incredible that a person bent on self-destruction can, with his own hand, s=
hoot himself in the heart=20

and in the head?=E2=80=9D  After consideration of the case referred to and =
reversal of the previous decision=20

of the coroner, the supposed suicide proved to be a homicide. Yet if the ab=

possibilities is alone regarded,=20
