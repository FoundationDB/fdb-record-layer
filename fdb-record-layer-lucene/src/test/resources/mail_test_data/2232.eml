zealous governor actually died in 1760, before he had effected his project;=
 but his death was not=20

regarded as natural." When the English appeared before Manila, Aranda's los=
s was regretted,=20

when it was too late. The English demolished the aforesaid churches and the=
ir towers, for their=20

own safety.--Eds.  [127] That is, elevated so as to fire over the top of a =
parapet.--Eds.  [128] This=20

place was afterward occupied (1824?) by "a statue of Carlos IV, in bronze, =
a true work of art, cast=20

in Manila. It was erected in recognition of his having ordered the conveyan=
ce [to the islands] of=20

vaccine virus, transmitted from arm to arm, for which purpose exclusively h=
e arranged for the=20

departure of a ship from Mjico, which reached Manila on April 15, 1805." (M=
ontero y Vidal,=20

Archipilago filipino, p. 301.) The same writer says (Hist. de Filipinas, ii=
, p. 388): "The benefits=20

produced by vaccination among the natives, always so harassed by that pest =
[of smallpox], were=20

evident," and Folgueras made strenuous efforts to secure its propagation th=
roughout the country.=20

He also gave orders that the dead and punish them.  Rewards were offered fo=

that would lead to a knowledge of the real fate of the shipwrecked crew, an=
d an exaggerated=20

estimate of our strength, and the capability of our firearms, was given by =
our interpreter, on her=20

own account, and was perfectly intelligible to us from the signs and gestic=
ulations she made, and=20

the scorn with which she pointed to the rude weapons of her country-men; fo=
r the intrepid little girl=20

had marched fearlessly up to the group of warriors.  After delivering her s=
peech, Lizzie withdrew to=20

us, and we waited, rather anxiously, the turn that affairs would take; for =
a peaceful solution would=20

be far preferable to a fight, in which, though we must ultimately be the vi=
ctors, yet success would=20

only be achieved at considerable loss of life, probably on both sides.  Whi=
lst matters rested thus,=20

and the blacks were holding an animated discussion, one of the troopers esp=
ied a solitary dingo=20

on the rocks overlooking the "bora ground," and distant from us about fifty=
 yards. Lizzie at once=20

said--  "Suppose you shoot 'em that fellow dingo, plenty that frighten blac=
k fellow."  "By Jove,=20

Lizzie, what a good idea!" we said.  "Who's the best shot;=20

[129] And yet the ignorant natives ascribed the pest of cholera, which caus=
ed such ravages in=20

Manila in 1820, to the poisoning of their wells by foreigners. A French phy=
sician, Dr. Charles L.=20

Benoit, who arrived at Manila at that time, and spent four years there, sta=
tes, in his Observacins=20

 fire," said Abiram, "it=20

will astonish them much more if they see it done by a black; and let Lizzie=
 warn them of what is=20

going to take place."  "You believe you shoot 'em that fellow dingo?" asked=
 Dunmore of Ferdinand.=20

"Your (yes), marmy, mine believe."  "Plenty big glass of rum, suppose you s=
hoot 'em bony (dead),"=20

added Abiram.  The trooper's eyes glistened, and he licked his lips as if t=
he spirit were already=20

won.  Meanwhile Lizzie had told her countrymen to watch the dog, and they w=
