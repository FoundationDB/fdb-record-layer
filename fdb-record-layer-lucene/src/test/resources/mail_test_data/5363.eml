 Scriptures, like the=20

bud in the sheath: _He was wounded for our transgressions; the Lord hath la=

of us all_."[F]  "Still, there's ever so much in the Old Testament that doe=

Christians at all," said the carpenter; "and though I don't pretend to have=
 the Bible at my finger-

ends, as you have, I can show you that in a moment. We have no concern what=
ever with all those=20

endless sacrifices of bullocks and lambs, which the Jews were perpetually m=
aking; you might cut=20

out of the Bible every chapter about them, and we should never miss them at=
 all."  Franks's=20

expressive face showed surprise at the utter ignorance betrayed by such a r=
emark. "Why, the very=20

_keystone_ of Gospel truth rests on the doctrine taught by those very sacri=
fices!" he exclaimed,=20

bending forward in his eager earnestness. "There were two mighty lessons ta=
ught by those=20

sacrifices, which were ordained by God himself; these lessons were, that _w=
ithout shedding of=20

blood there is no remission_,[G] and that justice would accept of one life =
as given _instead_ of=20

another. No Israelite, no, not even the holy Moses, could be forgiven and a=
ccepted without a=20

_sacrifice_ for sin, the sprinkled blood of atonement; no Christian, not ev=

forgiven and accepted, without a sacrifice for sin; and ours, in One  "A ne=

nswered, looking=20

very much worried--so much worried that I thought he must care even more ab=
out Ivor than I had=20

fancied.  "Of course it's the most awful rot," said Lord Bob, "but he's acc=
used of murder."  "It's in=20

the evening papers: not a word had got into the morning ones," Uncle Eric w=
ent on. "We've only=20

just seen the news since we came here to wait for you; otherwise I should h=

something for him. As it is, of course I must, as a friend of his, stop in =
Paris and do what I can to=20

help him through. But that needn't keep the rest of you from going on to-da=
y as you planned."=20

"What an awful thing!" exclaimed Aunt Lil. "I will stay too, if the girls d=
on't mind. Poor fellow! It may=20

be some comfort to him to feel that he has friends on the spot, standing by=
 him. I've got thousands=20

of engagements--we all have--but I shall telegraph to everybody. What about=
 you, Lord Bob?"  "I'll=20

stand by, with you, Lady Mountstuart," said he, his nice though not very cl=
ever face more anxious-

looking than I had ever seen it, his blue, wide-apart eyes watching me rath=
