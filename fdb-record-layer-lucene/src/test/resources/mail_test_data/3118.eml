dracaena marginata rule--cheapness and dirt--expense and cleanliness. Bless you! you innocent child, you had better give up the notion of the cheap lodgings, and stay on when he does. I don't see what's got into him. Somebody has bewitched him."  The Captain stared at her. Here were signs of a new kind of microbe, and dracaena marginata rule--cheapness and dirt--expense and cleanliness. Bless you! you innocent child, you had better give up the notion of the cheap lodgings, and stay on when he does. I don't see what's got into him. Somebody has bewitched him."  The Captain stared at her. Here were signs of a new kind of microbe, and _
eaten, but I like wiping it if the cloths are clean. Poppy, I have come to you about a most delicious 

and important scheme."  "Lor, Miss Jasmine," said Poppy, her fingers trembling violently, and the 

large dish which she was washing nearly slipping out of them. "Lor, miss, you do startle me. I was 

in the dumps, and you are for all the world like the sun coming out. Why, deary me, the back 

scullery ain't by no means such a bad sort of place when you're in it, Miss Jasmine."  "It is very 

damp and gloomy, all the same," answered Jasmine. "I do hope you will be quick, Poppy, in 

washing up those uninteresting dinner-plates. at once to the Elder's room. The physician entered 

unannounced, stopped short on the threshold, and stared at the two men who were in the midst of 

a heated discussion.  Elizabeth met the doctor as he came down the stair.  "Miss Fox, will you be 

kind enough to tell me if your father has had bad news, or sudden grief?"  "Not that I know of, 

Doctor. Harold had just told him that he must start for Australia to-morrow when Father nearly 

fainted. That is all that happened."  "Then, I see no occasion for this. There is nothing organically 

wrong so far as I can discover. But I shall take his blood pressure to-morrow just to be 


_
making up such a lovely plan. We want to take you out with us to-morrow; we are going to spend 

five shillings, quite lots of money, you know, and we are going to have dinner out, and perhaps tea 

out; and we are going a good long way. Can you come with us to-morrow, Poppy?"  "Hold me," 

said Poppy, suddenly stretching out her hand, "the scullery is damp and close, and my head a-

going round. Let's get out into the back yard, Miss Jasmine. Now I can breathe. Oh, didn't I say 

that London was dazzling, and isn't it you three that has got the hearts of gold. Say it all over again 

to me, please, Miss Jasmine. What is it we're all a-going to do to-morrow?"  "Oh, what a silly, 

Poppy, you are," said Jasmine; "why even I do not get as excited as you do. We are going out, 

and you are coming with us, and we are going to spend five shillings."  Poppy's cheeks flushed a 

vivid crimson, her eyes sparkled, and her small feet began involuntarily to dance.  "I has set my 

heart on something beauteous," she said, "and, oh, dear, Miss Jasmine, you will do it, won't you? 

You won't let none of them biting disappointments with which the air is choke full, as full as it is of 

smuts, come in the way. If you three darling ladies spend a crown piece, and take me abroad, we'll 

be on pleasure bent, and on pleasure alone. Say so, do, Miss Jasmine."  "Why, Poppy, of course 

we are going for pleasure; what do you mean?"  "Only that we won't be going Cathedraling and 

Towering. I don't say nothing ag'in them places, but when I wants real pleasure, and a crown piece 

spent on me, I don't go in for no Cathedraling."  Jasmine laughed. "I tell you what," she said, "you 

shall choose the pleasure yourself, Poppy. It's your treat, and you shall choose. Now, do say what 

hour you will be ready to start to-morrow, for we want to go early, and have a real long day." 

"Let's think," said Poppy. "To-morrow is, yes, to-morrow is Thursday. Cold joint to-morrow, and a 

salad made with stale lettuce which we gets cheap; potatoes boiled plain and not mashed, and a 

apple dumpling to follow. The ladies is very particular that their pastry should be light. Miss 

Slowcum says she can't sleep a bit at night if her pastry is heavy. She called me Sarah Martha 

Ann the last time I made it, and she looked most vinegary. Yes, Miss Jasmine, the dinner's plain 

to-morrow, and I'll get up with the daybreak, and do my cleaning. I don't see why Aunt Flint 

shouldn't let me go with you, miss."  Mrs. Flint, when properly attacked, proved herself quite 

vulnerable. She was anxious to please the Mainwarings who she hoped would take up their abode 

with her, for naughty Primrose had by no means divulged her real plans. Accordingly, Poppy was 

allowed to get her dinner beforehand, and a very happy little quartet left the Mansion soon after 

eleven o'clock.  They had gone some little distance from Penelope Mansion, and found 

themselves anything out of the ordinary happens. Keep him perfectly quiet. Good night."  Harold 

called Elizabeth from the head of the stair.  "Excuse me, Mr. McGowan. I shall send my brother 

right down."  "Please, don't do that. Your father will need you both. I shall be going."  "I'm so 

sorry!" she exclaimed, offering her hand. "You will come again, very soon, won't you?"  "I shall call 

in the morning to inquire about your father."  "Thank you. Good night."  "Good night."  Mr. 

McGowan took his hat from the hall-tree and left the house. As he walked very slowly through the 

avenue of trees a strange passage from the Bible kept tantalizing his attention. "Behold, a 

shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.... Then there was no breath in them.... 

Then from the four winds the breath came into them, and they lived."  Half provoked for allowing 

these words to arouse suspicion, he tried to cast them out. But the effect of them remained. He 

had witnessed the coming together of the dry bones of a past. Were the four winds from the four 

corners of the earth to give them life? Had he unwittingly helped to furnish the dry bones with 



breath?  He had gone but a short distance when he heard footsteps behind him.     CHAPTER IV 

"One minute, Mr. McGowan," called Harold Fox. "Come with me, please."  He drew the minister 

aside into the path that led into the lower gardens. Once in the deeper shadows, Harold stopped. 

"What have you to do with this man Phillips?" he demanded.  "What's that? Why, Mr. Fox----"  "I'd 

no sooner got Dad to his room than he began to mumble that you were to blame for his condition," 

cut in the lawyer. "He connected you in no favorable way with some woman in Australia. This man 

Phillips was involved, too, from what I could gather. I was questioning him when the doctor arrived, 

and after he was gone I could get nothing more out of him. I hate to go to Australia with him like 

this, and I have every reason to surmise that I won't need to go if you tell me all you know."  "I'm 

very sorry for your father's condition, but I see no way to help you. I don't see why he should 

connect me with his condition. How long ago did all this happen to your client?"  "About twenty-five 

years ago."  "Then it's ridiculous to associate me with any such trouble. I was not more than born, 

if, indeed, that. In what way does it all affect your father, anyway?"  "That I don't know. It's a 

mystery to me."  "I should gladly give you aid if it were possible."  "I'm only asking that you tell me 

all you know."  "All an infant in arms would know would be of little value, I fear."  "But you must 

know something by hearsay. Father would not take this turn out of a clear sky. There must be a 

little moisture where there are so many clouds."  "But, Mr. Fox, I've told you----"  "See here, Mr. 

McGowan," broke in Harold impatiently, "don't think me thickheaded. I've been 


_
Poppy divulged her plans.  "I has got to choose," she said, "and as I stated distinct to Miss 

Jasmine yesterday, I don't go in for the glooms of the Tower, nor the solemns of the Cathedral. I'd 

like to walk from end to end of Oxford Street first, and then I'd like to take a penny boat on the 

river."  "A penny boat!" exclaimed the three sisters in a breath, "that does sound delightful, and so 

cheap. Where did you hear of penny boats, Poppy?"  Poppy's face became radiant.  "It was the 

last charwoman at the Mansion," she answered. "She said that if you wanted a pleasure, and a 

pleasure cheap, there was nothing in all the world like a penny boat. You sit in it, and there you 

are, as snug as snug; plenty of room and plenty of company, and plenty of sights. Mrs. Jones said 

that if there was a pleasure to rest a tired charwoman it was to be found in a penny boat."  "Well, 

we are not charwomen, but we may as well have a little rest and fun while we can," answered 

Jasmine. "I think yours is a lovely treat, dear Poppy, and we will try and get into the penny boat as 

fast as possible."  "I don't know how we are to reach the boats," said Primrose. "I begin to know 

my way a little about Oxford Street, but how are we to find the river?"  Poppy, however, had made 

good use of her acquaintance with Mrs. Jones the charwoman. She knew the name as well as the 

color of the omnibus which would safely convey them near to the pier at Westminster. She also 

knew, being instructed by Mrs. Jones, that a policeman was the right person to give her 

information as to where this special omnibus was to be found. She was by no means shy in 

making her desires known to one of these useful and worthy members of society, and in a short 

time the four found themselves bowling away in the direction of Westminster, and then, without 

any insurmountable difficulty, secured comfortable seats on one of the river steamers.  The day 

was perfect, neither too hot nor too cold, and the summer breezes fanned the young cheeks 

pleasantly, and raised the youthful spirits to an exhilarating height. Poppy forgot her troubles in 

Penelope Mansion, her difficulties with regard to the name of Sarah. She forgot the gloom of the 

back scullery, and the discontented frown quite vanished from her brow. London was again 

dazzling in her eyes, and her own future was replete with hope.  Primrose also ceased to worry 

over the anxieties and cares of the future; she ceased to reflect on the plan which was so soon to 

be carried into execution. Her serene face looked sweet and careless as in the happy days of her 

mother's lifetime. She leaned back in her seat, gazed at the beauties of the river, and gave herself 

up to the happiness of the hour.  The two younger girls, being never over anxious and being 

always more or less full of hope, were to-day only more hopeful and bright than usual. Many 

people turned to look at the pretty sisters, and to laugh at Poppy's innocent expressions of rapture. 

They landed at Battersea, and wandered about the pretty park, and had refreshments in a quaint 

restaurant, where they really managed to satisfy their hunger at a very moderate charge.  That 

evening they returned to the Mansion, having kept within the limits of the prescribed five shillings, 

and each of them declaring that she had never known a happier day.  "But now," said Primrose, 

addressing her two sisters solemnly, "we must remember that after to-night we have done with 

pleasure. To-morrow we must seriously set about forming our plans."     CHAPTER XX.  GETTING 

LOST.   Primrose's scheme had, of course, been considered most wild and most foolish by all her 

friends at Rosebury but even they were not prepared for her crowning act of folly. She, Jasmine 

and Daisy had a consultation together. This consultation was really nothing but a matter of form, 

for Primrose, quiet as she appeared could lead her two sisters as she willed--her slightest word 

was law to them, and the most outrageous plan proposed by her would have been delightful in 



their eyes. Her suggestion to them was as follows:  "We will go to London," she said--"we will try to 

be independent, and to earn our own living, and in order to do so really, and to prevent ourselves 

being tempted by Mrs. Ellsworthy's riches, or by Miss Martineau's advice, we will not give our 

address. We will stay for a short time at Penelope Mansion, and then we will go away. We will find 

those nice, clean, cheap lodgings, where we can hang up our muslin curtains, and keep things 

lovely and fresh, even though we are in London, and we will stay there without troubling our 

friends about us until we have succeeded. The moment we have succeeded in earning enough to 

live on we will write home."  Jasmine, and of course little Daisy, approved of this idea--Jasmine 

said it was both romantic and strong--Daisy said she only wanted to be with her own Primrose and 

her own Jasmine, and if the Pink might always stay with her too she would be quite happy. 

Accordingly, when the girls' week of pleasure had quite come to an end, Primrose reminded her 

sisters that it was time for them to begin to get lost.  "We are not really lost here," she said. "Mrs. 

Ellsworthy thinks nothing of coming to town, and she could come to us at the Mansion any 

moment; and now that we have met that friend of hers, that Mr. Noel, she may be sending him to 

see about us--so you see it is more important than ever that we should find a place where we can 

really commence our work."  "I don't dislike Mr. Noel at all," said Jasmine. "It is a great pity he is 

related to our darling Mrs. Ellsworthy, for we might have had the comfort of his advice without 

being considered dependent. Oh, Primrose! is it possible that we are too independent--I can't help 

it, Primrose; I do feel lonely. I must cry just for a minute. I'd rather do a page of the 'Analogy' to-

night than not cry for a minute."  "My darling," said Primrose, putting her arms round Jasmine, "I 

am sure that girls like us cannot be too independent, but I won't go on with it if it really breaks your 

heart, Jasmine."  "Oh, but it doesn't really," said Jasmine; "I think it's a noble plan; I wouldn't give 

in for the world. I have had my cry now, and I'm better--but, Rose, how are we to look out for these 

nice, clean, cheap lodgings if we aren't to consult any one?"  "We can consult people, and find out 

the locality we want, but we need never tell the people we consult what number in the street we 

really choose. Oh, there are lots of ways of finding out what we really want to know."  "I'll talk to 

Mrs. Dredge to-night," said Jasmine. "I think Mrs. Dredge is very practical and kind, and I don't 

know why Miss Slowcum should dislike her so much. I'll get her all by myself this evening, and talk 

to her."  Accordingly that evening, after the inmates of Penelope Mansion had, as Mrs. Flint styled 

it, "tea'd," Jasmine sat down on a footstool at Mrs. Dredge's feet, and laid herself out to be 

bewitching. No one could be more charming than this little maiden when she chose, and she had 

tact enough to adapt herself on most occasions to her company.  "I'm sure you have lots of 

experience, Mrs. Dredge," she began; "you look as if you had--your face tells me that you have 

gone through many episodes"--(Jasmine was rather proud of this expression; she began to 

consider that her style was forming).  "Episodes, my dear, and experiences?" answered Mrs. 

Dredge. "Well, well, I'm not to say over young, and years bring knowledge; but if you mean, Miss 

Jasmine, that I'm up to the acquirements of the present day, that I'm not, and I never will be,--no, 

thank Heaven! that I never will be."  "Do you mean with regard to education?" remarked Jasmine. 

"Is it's round. Father knows something, and he knows you know something. In some way it 

involves him. His trouble to-night was purely mental."  "Suppose I am connected with all this 

mystery in some way, how on earth can a man call on a child's empty memory----"  "You're 

stalling, Mr. McGowan. Don't try that alibi stuff with me. It simply won't go."  "You refuse to accept 



my statement of ignorance concerning this man?"  "I most certainly do. You and Dad are passing 

the buck. I thought from all reports that you would stand up to any proposition like a man, no 

matter how unpleasant."  "There is nothing for me to stand up to, Mr. Fox."  "You absolutely refuse 

to tell me what you know?"  "I absolutely refuse, for I know absolutely nothing."  Harold Fox 

studied the set features of the minister in the dim light of the moon. He then cordially extended his 

hand.  "Pardon me, sir. I believe you. But there's something damned crooked somewhere, and I 

intend to ferret it out. If Dad's in it----Well, I hope to the Lord he isn't. You'd better watch your p's 

and q's pretty close, for Dad mentioned the fact that Mr. Means has it in for you, and the two of 

them can make it hell for you. I'm sorry to say that, but it's God's truth. I wouldn't trust Means with 

a pet skunk. I never have liked the fellow. I've said too much. Good night, and good luck."  Harold 

abruptly left, and Mr. McGowan walked slowly and heavily from the garden into the road that led 

toward the sea.                     *       *       *       *       *  Following that night, things began to happen 

with lightning-like rapidity. A spirit of distrust and suspicion sprang up among the members of the 

little church over night. The congregations dwindled down, till within a month they were not one-

half their original size. But in spite of the friction that was grinding at the religious machinery, Mr. 

McGowan went on steadily about his work. He visited the Inn more frequently, and won no little 

renown among the members of the club. But here he also had his enemies, and they were 

becoming bolder in proportion as the church grew more hostile toward its minister. Sim Hicks, the 

keeper of the Inn, began an open fight against Mr. McGowan's intrusions, declaring he would 

make good a former threat to oust the "Psalm-singer" from the village.  One evening Mr. 

McGowan returned to his study deeply perplexed. What was the meaning in the unjust 

persecution? Not that he complained; his difficulty was rather his inability to get at the bottom of it 

all. He stood before his window gazing absently out into the gathering dusk, when Captain Pott 

quietly opened the door and entered.  "Can I come in, Mack?"  "I'd love to have you. I need 

company."  "Anything special wrong? I've been noticing you're getting awful thin of late. Ain't 

Eadie's cooking agreeing with you?"  "I'm afraid that food cooked to the queen's taste wouldn't 

agree with me these days."  "Ain't in love, be you? I've heard tell how it affects people like that." 

The young man turned toward his friend. The wry smile with which he tried to divert the seaman 

did not hide the hurt expression in his eyes. The Captain caught the expression.  "Thought likely," 

he observed, pulling at his moustache. "But that ain't no reason for you losing sleep and flesh 

over, unless she ain't in love with you."  "There's no reason why she should be."  "Tush, tush, son. 

Don't ever try to hurry 'em. Let her take all the time she wants. Women are funny that way." 

"Cap'n," said the minister in tense earnestness, "there is something vitally wrong in this town, and I 

can't seem to find out what it is."  "I know," nodded the Captain.  "Then I wish you would enlighten 

me."  "I cal'late I can't do that, Mack. All I can see is that there's something like mutiny brewing 

aboard your salvation sloop, and mutiny is a mighty funny thing. You can't put your finger on it and 

say, 'Lo, here, or lo, there,' according to scripture. Ain't that right?"  "You have certainly stated the 

situation much better than I could hope to."  "I was only hoping you wouldn't see it."  "I don't see it, 

and that's my whole trouble. I can only see the results. I can't say that this one or that one is to 

blame, for the thing seems to be in the very air."  "I know just how you feel, Mack. That's where a 

skipper is hog-tied against taking any action. You just sort of feel that there's something devilish 

afoot, but you don't know enough what it is to be ready to meet it. Puts me in mind of a song I 



heard once aboard one of my ships. One of the new mates sang it, and called it the microbe song. 

I ain't got any idea where he picked it up, but it went like this:      "'Johnnie, don't you see 'em on 

my head and chin,     All them powerful microbes, both outside and in?     Johnnie, up and smite 

'em, counting every one,     With the strength that cometh with the pork and bun.      "'Johnnie, 

don't you feel 'em, how they work within,     Striving, crowding, pulling, kicking just like sin? 

Johnnie, don't you tremble, never be downcast,     Gird ye for the battle, we'll kill 'em while it lasts. 

"'Johnnie, don't you hear 'em, how they speak ye fair:     "All of us are shipmates, not a bunk is 

bare!"     Johnnie, answer boldly: "While we breathe we smite!"     And peace shall follow battle, 

day shall end in night.'"  Mr. McGowan laughed heartily as the Captain brought his song to an 

unmusical close.  "That song ain't got much music in it, leastwise not as I sung it, but it's got a 

heap of truth. Fact is, Mack, I'm as chuck full of them damn microbes as you be, and I ain't able to 

smite 'em. They are right in here,"--he tapped his head,--"and though I ain't able to say for sure, 

yet I've got a purty good idea that they're outside, too, and making a heap of trouble in this here 

burg.  "Now, take those pirates down to the Inn," continued the seaman. "There's something 

brewing down there, and it smells like hell-fire to me that's doing the boiling. Sim Hicks and his 

gang are whooping it up a mite too lively for comfort. That's microbe army number one. Then, 

there's Harry Beaver. He says they won't board you after your month is up."  "May army number 

two quickly advance! I shall gladly and willingly surrender."  "Hey? What's that? Where in the 

name of the ship's cook would you go, I'd like to know?"  "Right here."  "Right where? You board 

with me?"  "Why not?"  The old seaman's face slowly lighted up with appreciation as he fully 

grasped the meaning of Mr. McGowan's words, and then suddenly clouded.  "No, Mack. There 

ain't no sense in that," he declared, shaking his head emphatically. "I can keep soul and body 

together, but what I get on with would kill you. There's worse things in the world than Eadie's 

biscuits. No, I ain't going to listen to any such out-and-out murder as my cooking would commit." 

"Don't you think we could hire some one to come in and get our meals?" asked the minister.  "I'm 

'feared that ain't possible. And even if it was it would cause more talk about town. There's enough 

gossip aboard the old salvation craft to sink her now, beam-fust."  "Why should it cause talk for 

some one to take care of the house for us, and get our meals?"  "Why should any of this gab be 

floating round at all? There ain't no sense in it, but that don't stop it. Mack,"--the Captain leaned 

eagerly toward his young friend,--"don't tell me nothing you don't want to, but what happened up to 

Jim Fox's house that night you ate there the last time? Things ain't been going smooth since then. 

I hear he acted mighty queer. Was you to blame for it in any way?"  "Did Harold Fox talk to you 

before he left?"  "No. Harold ain't the gossiping kind."  "Some one has evidently been 


_
education of the present day wrong?--is that why you're so thankful you are not up to it?"  "My 

dear Miss Jasmine," answered Mrs. Dredge, with great solemnity, "the education of the present 

day is to the heart hardening, and to the mind demoralizing. No, no; none of it for me. Miss 

Slowcum, now! Miss Jasmine, between you and me I don't admire Miss Slowcum."  "Oh, she's 

very kind," answered Jasmine; "but look here, Mrs. Dredge, what I want to consult you about has 

nothing at all to say  "Ain't denying that, Mack. There's plenty of 'em in this burg that's ready to 

talk, and I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind, not to get some of the gab. The doctor told more 

than he ought, I guess."  "It might pay him to take a few lessons in keeping his mouth closed," 

impatiently commented Mr. McGowan.  "I know, Mack. I reckon he was pumped pretty hard." 

"That doesn't excuse him for----"  "There, Mack, don't get mad. I was asking you for your own 

good. There's something mighty 


_
education, and it has a great deal to say to experience. It's a great secret, Mrs. Dredge, but we 

want to find cheap lodgings."  "Oh, my dear! and don't you want to abide at the Mansion--all things 

considered, it's a respectable and safe quarter--you are all three young and attractive, my dears, 

and you have the advantage of being guarded here by women who have years on their shoulders. 

Yes, my dear Miss Jasmine, with the exception of your three selves and the maid Sarah, there is 

no one in Penelope Mansion who will ever see fifty again. Don't talk to me of Miss Slowcum being 

younger than that--I know better."  "Dear Mrs. Dredge, it is a secret, but we are really not going to 

stay here long, and we want, if possible, to find very cheap lodgings."  "Very cheap, love; and you 

think I can guide you? Well, well, I have had, as you wisely say, my experiences. About what 

figure would you be inclined to tell me just what took place that we'd be able to do something 

before that gang of rough-necks down to the Inn get the bits in their teeth."  "I don't see what the 

men at the Inn have to do with all this."  "They ain't got much to do with it, except to use it for a 

lever to pry you loose from the fellers who do like you. There's real trouble of some sort being 

hatched down there, but I ain't sure just what it's like. Maybe there ain't no use my worrying you 

with these suspicions, but watch them skunks at the Inn, and don't give 'em the inside of the track. 

Cal'late you'd best go over to supper, and see if Harry's going to shut off the rations."  Three days 

after this conversation Mr. McGowan's month was up, and the hammer of Mr. Beaver's authority 

came down. Captain Pott stood in his door, watching the pantomime as Mr. Beaver pumped, 

backed, stuttered, and blinked out the minister's dismissal from 


_
"I don't know," answered Jasmine. "Our house in the country was twelve pounds a year--I don't 

think we ought to pay as much as that, for of course we should not want a whole house, only two 

rooms. A nice, large, airy bedroom, and a cheerful sitting-room. We should not mind how plain the 

furniture was, if only it was very, very clean. You know the kind of place, with snow-white boards--

the sort of boards you could eat off--and little plain beds with dimity frills round them, and very 

white muslin blinds to the windows--we have got our own white muslin curtains; Hannah washed 

them for us, and they are as white as snow. Oh! the place we want might be very humble, and 

very inexpensive. Do tell us if you know of any rooms that would suit Captain had an extra griddle 

on the stove when Mr. McGowan returned. Without question or comment he indicated a chair, and 

the minister smiled like a schoolboy as he drew it up before the place at the Captain's table which 

he was to occupy from now on.  "Best eat 'em while they're sizzling hot," invited the Captain, 

dumping a turnerful of cakes on the empty plate.  When the men had divided the last flapjack, the 

minister announced that he was going for a stroll along the beach.  He was no sooner out of sight 

than over came Mrs. Beaver, carrying a large tin filled with biscuits. Captain Pott took them to the 

pantry, and returned with the empty pan.  "Thanks, Eadie. Mr. McGowan will sure appreciate 

them."  "Oh, Josiah! I hope he won't 


_
While Jasmine was speaking Mrs. Dredge kept on gazing at her, her round face growing long, and 

her full blue eyes becoming extended to their largest size.  "My dear child," she said, "wherever 

were you brought up? Don't you know that the kind of lodgings you want are just the hardest of all 

to get? Yes, my dear, I have experience in London apartments, and about them, and with regard 

to them, there is one  "Cal'late he won't blame you," said the seaman sympathetically.  "Why are 

things so upset in town against him?"  "I ain't able to answer that, Eadie. It does seem that the old 

ark is going through quite a squall, don't it?"  "Has Harry said anything to you?"  "Not yet, he ain't, 

and if I sight him fust he ain't going to say anything. I ain't got time for him to get his pumps 

working on me."  "You mark my word,
