to take possession of Mr. _

t very well for a boy of=20

your age, but you shouldn't have taken it from Mrs. Jones without her permi=
ssion."  "Aw, she never=20

used it."  "Nevertheless, it was her property. The rifle, Jack."  The boy s=
eemed on the verge of=20

defying the Cub leader. Then, he thought through the matter, and with a ges=
ture of contempt,=20

extended the weapon.  "It ain't loaded," the boy muttered. "You got nothing=
 to worry about."  Mr.=20

Hatfield checked the rifle for himself, finding that Jack had spoken the tr=
uth. Evidently he had used=20

his last shot on the rabbit.  "What d'you aim to do? Turn me over to the co=
ps again?"  "That=20

depends on what you tell us, Jack. From the start, we've tried to give you =
the benefit of every=20

doubt. Your remarks about the tin box, however, were disturbing."  "I didn'=
t take the money!"  "No=20

one has accused you, Jack. It's clear though, that you know plenty about th=
e matter."  "I read=20

about it in the paper."  "I think you know more than the facts you have rea=
d, Jack. Why don't you=20

come clean?"  "You turned me in!"  "We're law abiding citizens, Jack," Mr. =
Hatfield argued. "What=20

else could we do?"  "I help only my friends."  "We are your friends," the C=
ub leader insisted. "At=20

least we want to be. Sit down, Jack, and let's talk this over."  Mr. Hatfie=
ld brushed off a hollow log=20

which had fallen near the fence, and made room for Jack. The other boys gat=
hered around close=20

enough so the Institute lad could not hope to make a break for freedom.  "J=
ack, can't you realize=20

that we're trying to help, not make things hard for you," Mr. Hatfield atte=
mpted to reason with him.=20

"You must return to Mrs. Jones' home."  "I was going there anyhow," the boy=
 muttered, his gaze=20

on the ground.  "You weren't running away again?"  "'Course not," Jack said=
 irritably. "I wouldn't go=20

away and take her rifle. I'm not a thief. She's been good to me in her way-=
-better than anyone=20

e to go to Black Hawk for=20

Christmas purchases. Jake was sure he could get through on horseback, and b=
ring home our=20

things in saddle-bags; but grandfather told him the roads would be oblitera=
ted, and a newcomer in=20

the country would be lost ten times over. Anyway, he would never allow one =
of his horses to be=20

put to such a strain.  We decided to have a country Christmas, without any =
help from town. I had=20

wanted to get some picture-books for Yulka and Antonia; even Yulka was able=
 to read a little now.=20

Grandmother took me into the ice-cold storeroom, where she had some bolts o=
f gingham and=20

sheeting. She cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a=
 book. We bound it=20

between pasteboards, which I covered with brilliant calico, representing sc=
enes from a circus. For=20

two days I sat at the dining-room table, pasting this book full of pictures=
 for Yulka. We had files of=20

those good old family magazines which used to publish colored lithographs o=
f popular paintings,=20

and I was allowed to use some of these. I took "Napoleon Announcing the Div=
orce to Josephine"=20

for my frontispiece. On the white pages I grouped Sunday-School cards and a=
dvertising cards=20

which I had brought from my "old country." Fuchs got out the old candle-mou=
lds and made tallow=20

candles. Grandmother hunted up her fancy cake-cutters and baked gingerbread=
 men and=20

roosters, which we decorated with burnt sugar and red cinnamon drops.  On t=
he day before=20

Christmas, Jake packed the things we were sending to the Shimerdas in his s=
addle-bags and set=20

off on grandfather's gray gelding. When he mounted his horse at the door, I=
 saw that he had a=20

hatchet slung to his belt, and he gave grandmother a meaning look which tol=
d me he was planning=20

a surprise for me. That afternoon I watched long and eagerly from the sitti=
ng-room window. At last=20

I saw a dark spot moving on the west hill, beside the half-buried cornfield=
, where the sky was=20

taking on a coppery flush from the sun that did not quite break through. I=

_
stuff if you'd just give it a chance to come out. Now about the money box--=
"  "I don't know anything=20

about it."  "But you hinted--"  "I was just blowing," Jack said, avoiding M=
r. Hatfield's direct gaze.=20

"All I know is what I read in the newspaper."  The Cubs were disgusted. But=
 Jack, they knew, did=20

not abide by their standards of honor and fair play.  "Let me go now," Jack=
 muttered, getting up=20

from the log. "You got no right to keep me."  "Do we have your word that yo=
u'll return to Mrs.=20

Jones' house?" the Cub leader asked.  "I told you I would, didn't I?"  "I'l=
l accept your word, Jack.=20

And here's the rifle. When you return it to Mrs. Jones, why not ask her if =
you may borrow it now=20

and then? She'd likely give her consent and you wouldn't feel low and sneak=
ing about it.=20

Furthermore, in season you probably could help out by bringing in game for =
the table."  "Maybe=20

she would let me take it," Jack said. "Sure, I'll ask her next time. I prom=
ise."  Mr. Hatfield smiled=20

and reached out to shake the boy's hand.  "Good luck, Jack," he said. "You'=
ll do all right. I'm=20

confident of it. I--"  An odd expression came over the Cub leader's face. W=
ithout finishing what he=20

had started to say, he stooped down to examine one end of the hollow log.  =
The Cubs then saw=20

what had attracted their leader's attention. A bit of water-soaked cloth pr=
otruded from the end of=20

the log.  "What's this?" Mr. Hatfield murmured.  As the boys watched in ama=
zement, he removed a=20

wadded-up garment. The Cub leader shook it out, revealing a woman's black d=
ress trimmed in=20

diamond-shaped jet buttons.  "Why, that must be the costume stolen from Mrs=
. Jones' place!"=20

exclaimed Brad as Mr. Hatfield spread the garment over the log.  "Sure, the=
 same one maybe that=20

was worn by the thief who made off with the money box!" added Dan, becoming=
 highly excited.=20

Mr. Hatfield carefully examined the diamond-shaped buttons.  "Aren't they t=
he same as the one=20

police found in your desk?" cap and ran out to meet Jake. When I got to the=
 pond I could see that=20

he was bringing in a little cedar tree across his pommel. He used to help m=
y father cut Christmas=20

trees for me in Virginia, and he had not forgotten how much I liked them.  =
By the time we had=20

placed the cold, fresh-smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting-room=
, it was already Christmas=20

Eve. After supper we all gathered there, and even grandfather, reading his =
paper by the table,=20

looked up with friendly interest now and then. The cedar was about five fee=
t high and very=20

shapely. We hung it with the gingerbread animals, strings of popcorn, and b=
its of candle which=20

Fuchs had fitted into pasteboard sockets. Its real splendors, however, came=
 from the most unlikely=20

place in the world--from Otto's cowboy trunk. I had never seen anything in =
that trunk but old boots=20

and spurs and pistols, and a fascinating mixture of yellow leather thongs, =
cartridges, and=20

shoemaker's wax. From under the lining he now produced a collection of bril=
liantly colored paper=20

figures, several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone. They had been=
 sent to him year after=20

year, by his old mother in Austria. There was a bleeding heart, in tufts of=
 paper lace; there were=20

the three kings, gorgeously appareled, and the ox and the ass and the sheph=
erds; there was the=20

Baby in the manger, and a group of angels, singing; there were camels and l=
eopards, held by the=20

black slaves of the three kings. Our tree became the talking tree of the fa=
iry tale; legends and=20

stories nestled like birds in its branches. Grandmother said it reminded he=
r of the Tree of=20

Knowledge. We put sheets of cotton wool under it for a snow-field, and Jake=
's pocket-mirror for a=20

frozen lake.  I can see them now, exactly as they looked, working about the=
 table in the lamplight:=20

ow, unfinished; Otto=20

with his half-ear and the savage scar that made=20

demanded.  "They certainly look the same," the Cub leader admitted. "I wond=
er how this dress=20

came to be in the log?"  "Someone must have stuffed it in here just to be r=
id of it," Brad ventured.=20

His gaze fastened upon Jack Phillips. The boy leaned on his rifle, staring =
at the dress with a fixed,=20

almost frozen expression.  Observing the odd look I remember them, what unp=
rotected faces they=20

were; their very roughness and violence made them defenseless. These boys h=
ad no practiced=20

manner behind which they could retreat and hold people at a distance. They =
had only their hard=20

fists to batter at the world with. Otto was already one of those drifting, =
case-hardened laborers who=20

never marry or=20


_
what he knew of the matter.  "Jack," said Mr. Hatfield, without mincing wor=
ds, "have you ever seen=20

this dress before?"  "Have I seen it?" the boy echoed indignantly.  "That's=
 what I asked, Jack."=20

"No, I never saw the dress before!" the boy answered sullenly. "What's more=
 I didn't put it in this=20

old log! I had nothing to do with stealing their own. Yet he was so fond of=
 children!     XII   ON=20

Christmas morning, when I got down to the kitchen, the men were just coming=
 in from their=20

morning chores--the horses and pigs always had their breakfast before we di=

shouted "Merry Christmas"! to me, and winked at each other when they saw th=

eld said. "Frankly,=20

it's something of a shock."  "Well, blame me! I always get accused of every=
thing whether I did it or=20

not!"  "No one has accused you of anything, Jack. We only want to get at th=
e truth of the matter. I=20

have a deep-seated feeling that you might help us, if only you would."  Jac=
k remained silent.  Mr.=20

Hatfield examined the dress and then wrapped it into a tight roll.  "Jack, =
we'll walk along with you=20

to Mrs. Jones' place," he said. "I think this is the dress that disappeared=
 from her shed. I want to=20

find out for certain."  "I didn't Grandfather came down, wearing a white sh=
irt and his Sunday coat.=20

Morning prayers were longer than usual. He read the chapters from St. Matth=
ew about the birth of=20

Christ, and as we listened it all seemed like something that had happened l=
ately, and near at=20

hand. In his prayer he thanked the Lord for the first Christmas, and for al=
l that it had meant to the=20

world ever since. He gave thanks for our food and comfort, and prayed for t=
he poor and destitute=20

th us. Grandfather's=20

prayers were often very interesting. He had the gift of simple and moving=

_
If you go back and tell the widow, she'll think I stole it! She'll send me =
back to the Institute!"  "Not if=20

you tell a straight story, Jack," Mr. Hatfield reassured him. "Come along, =
boys. We're wasting=20

valuable time."  Jack did not openly defy Mr. Hatfield or the Cubs, but he =
made it evident by=20

glances he directed at them that he resented their interference.  As the gr=
oup approached the old=20

farmhouse, Mrs. Jones saw the boys from afar. talked so little, his words h=
ad a peculiar force; they=20

were not worn dull from constant use. His prayers reflected what he was thi=
nking about at the=20

time, and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and =
his views about things.=20

After we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased the =
Shimerdas had been=20

with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with =
him to cut the=20

"Well, I see you caught the rascal!" she commented grimly.  "We found him,"=
 Mr. Hatfield=20

corrected. "Jack wasn't running away though. He said he intended to come ba=
ck."  "Jack, why do=20

you do it?" the widow asked, taking the rifle from him. "Haven't I been goo=

boy responded, his eyes on the ground.  "I'll fix you some victuals. You mu=
st be hungry."  "I've had=20

enough to eat. I'm sorry about taking so much from the refrigerator."  The =
tight lines around Mrs.=20
