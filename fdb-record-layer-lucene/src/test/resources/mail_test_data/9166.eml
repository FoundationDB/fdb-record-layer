drinking, as their beaks for an instant kiss the stream. These unfortunate =
little birds get no rest, the=20

large fish and the crocodiles grab at them when they attempt to drink, whil=
e the falcons and hawks=20

pursue them at all times and in every direction. Nothing is fat, as nothing=
 can obtain rest, the=20

innumerable birds and beasts of prey give no peace to the weaker kinds; the=
 fattest alderman of=20

the city of London would become a skeleton, if hunted for two hours daily b=
y a hyaena.  "October=20

23.--This evening I took a walk, accompanied by my wife, and Bacheet with a=
 spare gun, to try for=20

a shot at guinea-fowl. We were strolling along the margin of the river, whe=
n we heard a great=20

shrieking of women on the opposite side, in the spot from which the people =
of Sofi fetch their=20

water. About a dozen women had been filling their water-skins, when suddenl=
y they were attacked=20

by a large crocodile, who attempted to seize a woman, but she, springing ba=
ck, avoided it, and the=20

animal swallowed her girba (water-skin), that, being full of water and of a=
 brown exterior,=20

resembled the body of a woman. The women rushed out of the river, when the =
crocodile made a=20

second dash at them, and seized another water-skin that a woman had dropped=
 in her flight. They=20

believe this to be the same monster that took a woman a few months ago. Few=
 creatures are so=20

sly and wary as the crocodile. I watch them continually as they attack the =
dense flocks of small=20

birds that throng the bushes at the water's edge. These birds are perfectly=
 aware of the danger,=20

and they fly from the attack, if possible. The crocodile then quietly and i=
nnocently lies upon the=20

surface, as though it had appeared quite by an accident; it thus attracts t=
he attention of the birds,=20

and it slowly sails away to a considerable distance, exposed to their view.=
 The birds, thus beguiled=20

by the deceiver, believe that the danger is removed, and they again flock t=
o the bush, and once=20

more dip their thirsty beaks into the stream. Thus absorbed in slaking thei=
r thirst, they do not=20

observe that their enemy is no longer on the surface. A sudden splash, foll=
owed by a huge pair of=20

jaws beneath the bush that engulfs some dozens of victims, is the signal un=
expectedly given of the=20

crocodile's return, who has thus slyly dived, and hastened under cover of w=
ater to his victims. I=20

have seen the crocodiles repeat this manoeuvre constantly; they deceive by =
a feigned retreat, and=20

then attack from below.  "In like manner the crocodile perceives, while it =
is floating on the surface=20

in mid-stream, or from the opposite side of the river, a woman filling her =
girba, or an animal=20

drinking, &c. &c. Sinking immediately, it swims perhaps a hundred yards nea=
rer, and again=20

appearing for an instant upon the surface, it assures itself of the positio=
n of its prey by a stealthy=20

look; once more it sinks, and reaches the exact spot above which the person=
 or animal may be.=20

Seeing distinctly through the water, it generally makes its fatal rush from=
 beneath--sometimes=20

seizing with its jaws, and at other times striking the object into the wate=
r with its tail, after which it=20

is seized and carried off.  "The crocodile does not attempt to swallow a la=
rge prey at once, but=20

generally carries it away and keeps it for a considerable time in its jaws =
in some deep hole=20

beneath a rock, or the root of a tree, where it eats it at leisure. The ton=
gue of the crocodile is so=20

unlike that of any other creature that it can hardly be called by the same =
name; no portion=20

throughout the entire length is detached from the flesh of the lower jaw--i=
t is more like a thickened=20

membrane from the gullet to about half way along the length of jaw.  "Octob=
er 4.--Having burnt off=20

a large surface of high grass, I discovered a quantity of gourds and wild c=
ucumbers--the latter are=20

bright crimson, covered with long fleshy prickles, with black horny tips; t=
hese are eaten by the=20

baboons, but not by the Arabs. The gourds are only serviceable for cups and=
 ladles manufactured=20

from their shells.  "I find a good pair of Highland shooting shoes of great=
 value; the soles were=20



exceedingly thick, and they have resisted, until now, the intensely hard an=
