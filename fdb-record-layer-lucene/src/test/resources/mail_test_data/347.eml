 Besides these points, the condition of the edges of the wound, whether swo=
llen and ecchymotic, smooth and straight or dentated and irregular, and whe=
ther inverted or everted and gaping, are matters of importance. The presenc=
e or absence of coagula and clots, the staining of the dracaena marginata o=
ccubuissemus tunc placeret tibi. Nunc igitur surge et precede et alloquens =
satisfac servis tuis: juro enim tibi per dominum, quod si non exieris, ne u=
nus quidem remansurus sit tecum nocte hac; et pejus erit hoc tibi, quam omn=
ia mala, qu=C3=A6 venerunt super te ab adolescentia tua Besides these point=
s, the condition of the edges of the wound, whether swollen and ecchymotic,=
 smooth and straight or dentated and irregular, and whether inverted or eve=
rted and gaping, are matters of importance. The presence or absence of coag=
ula and clots, the staining of the _
king. He collected ten thousand fighting men, whom he marched toward Jerusa=
lem, to put his=20

father to death and take possession of the town.  =E2=80=98King David recei=
ved intelligence of what was=20

intended, and in consequence fled from the city of Jerusalem, with some of =
his faithful friends, to a=20

town beyond Jordan, whither he summoned his adherents. A battle was shortly=
 proposed in the=20

forest of Lendeue, whither Absalon came with a large force of men at arms, =
leading them as their=20

prince. His constable and other knights advised him to remain within the fo=
rest, for it was strongly=20

situated. This he did; but as he was one of the most expert knights in the =
world, he would himself=20

form his army into three battalions: the first was put under the command of=
 Joab, his constable;=20

the second was given to Bisay, brother to Joab; and the third was commanded=
 by Eschey, son to=20

Jeth. When the battle took place, it was very violence which, if present, w=
ould remove the idea of=20

spontaneity.  Fractures of the extremities are not dangerous _per se_, unle=
ss they are compound=20

or occur in old, debilitated, or diseased persons, and they are more severe=
 the nearer they are to a=20

joint. The healing of fractures is more rapid in the young than in the old =
and in the upper than in=20

the lower extremity. It is not proven that adiposity of itself impedes unio=
n.  The question may be=20

asked, how long before examination a given bone was fractured. As a rule, w=
e can only say as to=20

whether the injured person has lived a long or short period since the injur=
y, as the process of=20

repair varies according to age and constitution. No changes occur until eig=
hteen to twenty-four=20

hours, when lymph is exuded. According to Villerm=C3=A9 the callus is carti=
laginous anywhere between=20

the sixteenth and twenty-fifth days, it becomes ossified between three week=
s and three=20


_
to flight.  =E2=80=98It happened, as Absalon was flying on his mule after t=
he defeat of his party, that he=20

passed under an oak, whose spreading branches caught hold of his hair, and =
thus suspended=20

him, while his mule galloped from under him. Absalon had that day taken off=
 his helmet from his=20

head, the more readily to escape,=E2=80=94and his hair was extremely thick =
and long, reaching to his=20

girdle, and got twisted among the branches, so that he seemed to hang there=
 miraculously, as a=20

punishment for the disloyal treason he had formed against his father and so=
vereign.  =E2=80=98Absalon was=20

seen in this situation by one of the men at arms of Joab, constable to king=
 David,=E2=80=94and he=20

hastened to tell Joab of it, who replied, =E2=80=98When thou sawest him, wh=
y didst thou not kill him? and I=20

would bone.  The question may also be asked: Has a bone ever been fractured=
? The existence=20

and situation of a fracture can often be recognized long after the accident=
, by the callus or slight=20

unevenness due to projection of the edges or ends of the fragments. Where t=
he bone lies deeply=20

covered by soft parts, it is difficult and often impossible to tell, long a=
fter union has taken place,=20

whether or where a fracture has occurred.  The answering of this question m=
ay sometimes be of=20

importance in identifying the dead, especially in the case of skeletons. In=
 the latter instance by=20

sawing the bone longitudinally we can tell by the thickness, irregularity, =
or structure of the bone=20

tissue whether a fracture existed, and if it were recent or old at the time=
 of death.=20


_
have given thee ten golden besants, and a handsome girdle.=E2=80=99 The man=
 answered,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98If thou=20

wouldst have given me ten thousand besants, I should not have dared to have=
 touched him, or=20

done him the least evil; for I was present when the king commanded thee, an=
d all his men at arms,=20

saying, =E2=80=98Save me my child Absalon! Oh, save him from being slain!=
=E2=80=99=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Joab said, =E2=80=98that the=20

commands of the king were contrary to his honour and safety; and that so lo=
ng as Absalon should=20

live, the king would be always in peril, and we shall not have peace in the=
 kingdom. Lead me=20

where Absalon is.=E2=80=99 And the man led him to where Absalon was hanging=
 by his hair. Joab, on=20

seeing him, thrust his lance thrice into his body, near to the place of his=
 heart, and then had him=20

thrown into a ditch and covered with stones; for according to the laws of G=
od, all fractures. They=20

are less common in the old and where the bones are brittle, when fracture o=
ccurs more readily.=20

They are seldom fatal _per se_, unless between the vertebr=C3=A6 or when co=
mpound. They may=20

occur from disease in the affected joint or even spontaneously. The diagnos=
is of a dislocation is=20

easy until it has been reduced, and then it may leave no trace except pain =
in and limitation of the=20

motion of a joint besides swelling and ecchymosis. These effects are transi=
ent, and after they have=20

disappeared it may be impossible to say whether a dislocation has existed o=
n a living body,=20

unless, as sometimes occurs, especially in the shoulder joint, there may be=
 a temporary or=20

permanent paralysis of a nerve and muscular atrophy. After death, the exist=
ence of an old=20

dislocation may often be recognized on dissection by scar tissue in=20

against their fathers and sovereigns were to be put to death and covered wi=
th stones.  =E2=80=98When=20

David heard of the death of his son, he went into an upper chamber, and wep=
t bitterly, uttering=20

these words: =E2=80=98Fili mi Absalon, fili mi quis mihi tribuat ut ego mor=
iar pro te Absalon fili mi[120].=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98It=20

was told to Joab and the other captains, that David was inconsolable for th=
e loss of Absalon,=20

which made them very indignant; and Joab went to David, and said,=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=98Confudisti hodie vultus=20

omnium servorum tuorum qui salvam fecerunt animam tuam. Diligis odientes te=
, et odio habes=20

diligentes te, et ostendisti hodie quia non curas de ducibus tuis, et de ab=
out the capsule.=20

EXAMINATION AND DESCRIPTION.  The examination of wounds or injuries in a ca=
se which is or=20

may become the subject of a medico-legal investigation should be made with =
particular care and=20

exactness.  As the examination of the wounded person is to give most, and i=
n some cases all, the=20

information to the medical expert on which he is to base his testimony, it =
should be made with=20

reference to all the possibilities of the case.  The particular variety of =
wound as described in the=20

foregoing section should be noted, and any peculiarities as to its situatio=
n, shape, extent, length,=20

breadth, depth, direction, and the parts=20
