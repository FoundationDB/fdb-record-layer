ttlers in Acadia, which,=20

you remember, was more or less in the hands of Biencourt, son of Poutrainco=
urt.  Besides=20

Biencourt there lived in Acadia at this time the two La Tours, father and s=
on.  Claude de la Tour,=20

the father, was a brave and courtly Huguenot.  He occupied a trading post o=
n the borders of what=20

is now Maine; while Charles, his son, held a strong little fort called St. =
Louis, near {52} Cape=20

Sable.  When Biencourt died he bequeathed his title and all his interests i=
n Acadia to young=20

Charles, because he had been his friend and companion from boyhood.  You ha=
ve seen that soon=20

after this a war broke out between France and England--the war in which Adm=
iral Kirke captured=20

the French fleet and summoned Quebec to surrender.  On board one of the cap=
tured ships of the=20

French fleet was the hope of Acadia, in the person of Claude de la Tour.  H=
e had gone home to=20

France, and was now bringing out men and arms and provisions to make Port R=
oyal strong=20

enough to resist the new English pretensions to this fair region.  While th=
e valiant Champlain saw=20

himself shut up starving in Quebec, Claude de la Tour was buffeting the wav=
es on the way to=20

England as Kirke's prisoner of war.  De la Tour, being a Protestant of nobl=
e birth and of charming=20

manners, was well received in London, and made much of.  The very best peop=
le were anxious to=20

make his acquaintance.  He, on his side, found the English most agreeable, =
and ended by courting=20

Rejoice, therefore, at the good fortune that has befallen us, and fly the p=

George from yonder staff."  But Charles, far from showing joy, seemed thund=

[Illustration: De la Tour refuses to yield his Allegiance.  1630]  After th=
is, what could the=20

disappointed father do but return crestfallen to his ship?  After writing h=
is son a letter urging him to=20

obedience, Sir Claude bethought him of the effect of cannon and muskets as =
arguments.  He=20

would bring the ungrateful youth to reason by force.  Thrice he landed his =
soldiers and sailors and=20

tried to storm Fort St. Louis; but in vain.  His men were repulsed, and soo=
n became disgusted with=20

the whole enterprise.  Eventually they all repaired to Port Royal and took =
