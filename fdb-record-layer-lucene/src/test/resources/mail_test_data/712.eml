America an' England. Hit was 'bout our li'l war--what _dey_ stahted an' _we=

old veteran of many battles unwrapped the small piece of black tobacco in t=

decided on conservation, and slowly wrapped it up again.  "Nex' comes order=

second voyage, Uncle=20

Dave seemed in deep thought, and finally said:  "Well, Ah tell you 'bout de=

East India Company, shutting the gates of Eastern commerce on mankind, or a=

Union, limiting the number of bricks to be carried in a hod. All attempts t=
o restrain or cripple=20

production in the interest of a privileged set of producers; all trade rule=
s preventing work from=20

being done in the best, cheapest and most expeditious way; all interference=
 with a man's free use=20

of his strength and skill on pretence that he is beating his mates, or on a=
ny other pretence, all=20

exclusions of people from lawful callings for which they are qualified; all=
 apprenticeships not=20

honestly intended for the instruction of the apprentice, are unjust and con=
trary to the manifest=20

interests of the community, including the misguided monopolists themselves.=
 All alike will, in the=20

end, be resisted and put down. In feudal times the lord of the manor used t=
o compel all the people=20

to use his ferry, sell on his fair ground, and grind their corn at his mill=
. By long and costly effort=20

humanity has broken the yoke of old Privilege, and it is not likely to bow =
its neck to the yoke of the=20

new.  Those who in England demanded the suffrage for the working man, who u=
rged, in the name=20

of public safety, as well as in that of justice, that he should be brought =
within the pale of the=20

constitution, have no reason to be ashamed of the result. Instead of voting=
 for anarchy and public=20

pillage, the working man has voted for economy, administrative reform, army=
 reform, justice to=20

Ireland, public education. But no body of men ever found political power in=
 their hands without=20

being tempted to make a selfish use of it. Feudal legislatures, as we have =
seen, passed laws=20

compelling workmen to give more work, or work that was worth more, for the =
same wages.=20

Working men's legislatures are now disposed to pass laws compelling employe=
rs, that is, the=20

community, to give the same wages for less work. Some day, perhaps, the bak=
ers will get power=20

into their hands and make laws compelling us to give the same price for a s=
maller loaf. What=20

would the Rochdale pioneers, or the owners of any other co- operative store=
, with a staff of=20

servants say if a law were passed compelling them to give the same wages fo=
r less service? This=20

is not right, and it cannot stand. Demagogues who want your votes will tell=
 you that it can stand,=20

but those who are not in that line must pay you the best homage in their po=
wer by speaking the=20

truth. And if I may venture to offer advice never let the cause of labour b=
e mixed up with the game=20

of politicians. Before you allow a man to lead you in trade questions be su=
re that he has no eye to=20

your votes. We have a pleasing variety of political rogues but perhaps, the=
re is hardly a greater=20

rogue among them than the working man's friend.  Perhaps you will say as mu=
ch or more work is=20

done with the short hours. There is reason to hope that it in some cases it=
 may be so. But then the=20

employer will see his own interest, free contract will produce the desired =
result, there will be no=20

need of compulsory law.  I sympathize heartily with the general object of t=
he nine hours=20

movement, of the early closing movement, and all movements of that kind. Le=
isure well spent is a=20

condition of civilization, and now we want all to be civilized, not only a =
few. But I do not believe it=20

possible to regulate the hours of work by law with any approach to reason o=
r justice. One kind of=20

work is more exhausting than another, one is carried on in a hot room, anot=
her in a cool room, one=20

amidst noise wearing to the nerves, another in stillness. Time is not a com=
mon measure of them=20

all. The difficulty is increased if you attempt to make one rule for all na=
tions disregarding=20



differences of race and climate. Besides how in the name of justice, can we=
 say that the man with=20

a wife and children to support, shall not work more if he pleases than the =
unmarried man who=20

chooses to be content with less pay and to have more time for enjoyment? Me=
dical science=20

pronounces, we are told, that it is not good for a man to work more than ei=
ght hours. But=20

supposing this to be true and true of all kinds of work, this as has been s=
aid before is an imperfect=20

world and it is to be feared that we cannot guarantee any man against havin=
g more to do than his=20

doctor would recommend. The small tradesman, whose case receives no conside=
ration because=20

he forms no union, often perhaps generally has more than is good for him of=
 anxiety, struggling=20

and care as well as longer business hours, than=20

. Pressure on the=20

weary brain is, at least, as painful as pressure on the weary muscle; many =
a suicide proves it; yet=20

brains must be pressed or the wheels of industry and society would stand st=
ill. Let us all, I repeat,=20

get as much leisure as we fairly and honestly can; but with all due respect=
 for those who hold the=20

opposite opinion, I believe that the leisure must be obtained by free arran=
gement in each ease, as=20

it has already in the case of early closing, not by general law.  I cannot =
help regarding industrial=20

war in this new world, rather as an importation than as a native growth. Th=
e spirit of it is brought=20

over by British workmen, who have been fighting the master class in their f=
ormer home. In old=20

England, the land of class distinctions, the masters are a class, economica=
lly as well as socially,=20

and they are closely allied with a political class, which till lately engro=
ssed power and made laws in=20

the interest of the employer. Seldom does a man in England rise from the ra=
nks, and when he=20

does, his position in an aristocratic society is equivocal, and he never fe=
els perfectly at home.=20

Caste runs from the peerage all down the social scale. The bulk of the land=
 has been engrossed=20

by wealthy families, and the comfort and dignity of freehold proprietorship=
 are rarely attainable by=20

any but the rich. Everything down to the railway carriages, is regulated by=
 aristocracy; street cars=20

cannot run because they would interfere=20


_
Judging from the appearance of this feeble old man, one would hardly think =
that he was once a=20

rollicking scrapper, with ready fists like rawhide mallets. Old Dave dutifu=
lly gives full credit to the=20

law of heredity.  "M' daddy was six feet six, an' weighed 248 pounds," he s=
aid proudly. "Nevah=20

done a hahd day's wuk in 'is life."  When pressed for an explanation of thi=
s seeming phenomenon,=20

the old man sniffed disdainfully.  "Does stock breeders wit a $10,000-stall=
ion put 'im on de plow?...=20

Dey called my daddy de $10,000 niggah."  Uncle Dave sat, stroking his cane =
for a few minutes,=20

then smiled faintly. "My drained because a park is in the way. The labourer=
 has to bear a heavy=20

load of taxation, laid on by the class wars of former days. In this new wor=
ld of ours, the heel taps=20

of old-world flunkeyism are sometimes poured upon us, no doubt; as, on the =
other hand, we feel=20

the reaction from the old-world servility in a rudeness of self assertion o=
n the part of the=20

democracy which is sometimes rather discomposing, and which we should be gl=
ad to see=20

exchanged for the courtesy of settled self- respect. But on the whole, clas=
s distinctions are very=20

faint. Half, perhaps two-thirds, of the rich men you meet here have=20


_

 an' muscle."  While there=20

have been many instances of atrocious cruelty to slaves, Uncle Dave believe=
s that other cases=20

have been unduly magnified. He says that he was never whipped by his master=
, but remembers=20

numerous chastisements at the hands of Miss Jessie, his young owner, daught=
er of Pierre=20

Pinckney.  "De young missus used to beat me a right smaht," he recalled wit=
h an amused smile. "I=20

the rest. Everything is=20

hold. Everything is=20

arranged for the convenience of the masses. Political power is completely i=
n the hands of the=20

people. There are no fiscal legacies of an oligarchic past. If I were one o=
f our emigration agents, I=20

should not dwell so much on wages, which in fact are being rapidly equalize=

' upset her toys.=20

When she come back, she be hoppin' mad, an staht beatin' me.  "'Jessie,' he=

Buddy, beatin' him dat way.'  "'I don't care,' she say, 'I'll beat him to d=

"I'd roll on de flo' an' holler loud, an' preten' she hurt me pow'ful bad. =
By'm by, when she git ovah=20

old man's eyes twinkled. "Dat be w'at I'se atter all de time," he explained=
.  The perils of a life at=20

sea are not as great as fiction writers sometimes indicate, according to th=
is old position, the=20

enlarged share of all the benefits which the community affords. I should sh=
ow that we have made=20

a step here at all events towards being a community indeed. In such a land =
I can see that there=20

may still be need of occasional combinations among the working men to make =
better bargains with=20

their employers, but I can see no need for the perpetual arraying of class =
against class or for a=20

standing apparatus of industrial war.  There is one more point which must b=
e touched with=20

tenderness but which cannot be honestly passed over in silence. It could no=
where be mentioned=20

less invidiously than under the roof of an institution which is at once an =
effort to create high tastes=20

in working men and a proof that such tastes can be created. The period of t=
ransition from high to=20

low wages and from incessant toil to comparative leisure must be one of per=
il to masses whom no=20
