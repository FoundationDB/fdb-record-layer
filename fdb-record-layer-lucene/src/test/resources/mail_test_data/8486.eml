5. The Deputy Warden shall be minute in the inspection of every person     =
  when coming on duty,=20

especially armed guards, and of their arms, and       shall report to the W=
arden the name of any=20

person who may come on       duty under the influence of intoxicants, or wi=
thout being in an=20

appropriate uniform, or whose uniform is not in good condition; and       a=
ll who are unworthy or=20

inefficient from any cause.    6. He may grant leave of absence to any offi=
cer, guard, or employee=20

for       a period of one day, but no longer, without consulting the Warden=
,       except on emergent=20

occasions, and then only in the absence of the       Warden. The Deputy War=
den shall enforce=20

obedience to the rules and       regulations, and to all orders given by th=
e Warden, and shall=20

maintain, generally, the police and discipline of the prison with       the=
 strictest exactness. For that=20

purpose he shall frequently,       during the day, but at irregular interva=
ls and without notice, visit=20

the shops, towers, yards, guardposts, hospital, kitchen, cells and       al=
l other apartments of the=20

prison, and the different places where       work is being done, and take e=
very precaution for the=20

security of       the place and its inmates. And he shall see that the offi=
cers and       guards are=20

vigilant and attentive to their duty, and that they keep       the inmates =
in their charge diligently=20

employed during the hours of       labor.    7. He shall not permit any boo=
k, pamphlet or newspaper=20

to be read by,       or be in possession of, any subordinate officer, guard=
, foreman, or=20

employee, while on duty in or about the prison. Nor shall he permit       t=
he use of liquor or smoking=20

on the premises by any such officer,       instructor, guard, or employee, =
while on duty.    8. When=20

an inmate is received the Deputy Warden shall see that he is       bathed, =
shaved and has his hair=20

cut, clothed in the suit of a second       grade inmate, and duly presented=
 to the Physician for=20

examination,       after which he shall measure him according to the Bertil=
lon system,       and also=20

carefully examine into his past history and character,       reporting same=
 on blanks furnished for=20

that purpose, after which he       shall assign him to work under the direc=
tion of the Warden. He=20

shall, at short intervals, but irregularly examine the gates, locks,       =
doors, levers and gratings in=20

and about the prison, and see that       they are in a good and safe condit=
ion.    9. He shall=20

exercise due vigilance to see that there is no unnecessary       waste or l=
oss of the property of the=20

prison, and that there is the       strictest economy in the consumption an=
d the use of supplies. Also=20

that thorough neatness, cleanliness and good order are maintained       thr=
oughout all the buildings=20

and the grounds.   10. He shall make himself acquainted with the social hab=
its and conduct       of=20

every subordinate officer, guard or employee of the prison, and       parti=
cularly whether, when off=20

duty, such officer, guard or employee       is a frequenter of saloons or o=
ther houses of similar=20

resort, or       associates with idle or loose characters, and report his i=
nformation       to the=20

Warden.   11. He shall see that no material is allowed to be placed near th=
e       enclosing walls,=20

and that nothing is accessible to inmates which       might facilitate esca=
pe. He shall especially see=20

that all ladders       are properly secured.   12. As all business must fir=
st be directed through the=20

office of the       institution, he shall have a vigilant eye over every pe=
rson who may       have=20

business with the prison, yards and workshops. And also see       that noth=
ing which has not been=20

authorized by inspection in the       office is carried in or out for inmat=
es or others; and that no=20

communication is held by such person with any inmate, except by       autho=
rity granted, and in the=20

presence of an officer.   13. He shall, every night, before relieving the o=
fficers and guards from=20

duty, verify, by actual count of inmates to be made by subordinates,       =
the written daily count=20

report furnished him from the office.   14. As the prison reformatory law a=
ffords to inmates the=20



privilege of       earning diminution of imprisonment from maximum sentence=
, affects       their=20

grade standing, and in consequence their chances for parole,       it will =
be incumbent upon all=20

authorities of the prison to give the       strictest attention to the cond=
uct of each, that no injustice=20

be       done to any inmate or to the state. And especially it shall be the=
       duty of the Deputy=20

Warden to satisfy himself as to the behavior of       each inmate, and his =
industry, alacrity and zeal=20

in the execution of       his work, so that he may be able to advise with t=
he Warden as to the=20

merits and proper standing of each. For this purpose he shall, when       m=
aking his rounds,=20

frequently communicate with officers, guards and       employees.   15. All=
 breaches of discipline,=20

or other offenses by an inmate, must be       immediately reported in writi=
ng by the officer in charge=20

to the       Deputy Warden, who shall, at the earliest opportunity, make fu=
ll       inquiry into the facts.=20

And if he cannot easily excuse or correct       the offender without the in=
fliction of a penalty, he will=20

make a       full report to the Warden, at the earliest practical moment, a=
nd       inflict such=20

punishment as may be necessary under his direction.   16. The Deputy Warden=
 shall select from=20

the trusty inmates a sufficient       number to compose a well regulated fi=
re department and assign=20

them       to their respective duties and stations in conjunction and in   =
    harmony with the Chief=20

Engineer. Frequent tests of the fire       apparatus shall be made and freq=
uent false alarms given=20

and runs       made to test the efficiency of the department.   17. He shal=
l take careful invoice of all=20

personal property brought in by       prisoners, and deposit it with the Ch=
ief Clerk for safe keeping.=20

It       shall also be his duty to store and preserve in as good condition =
as       possible the clothing=20

worn by a prisoner when requested to do so by       said prisoner.   18. Th=
e Deputy Warden will=20

assign inmates to the several employments and       make details of inmates=
 to act as runners,=20

messengers, or       distributors of material in shops or elsewhere, and wi=
ll decide how       far such=20

inmates may converse with other and shut at pleasure, for the conveniency o=
f taking away the=20

Dung, which should be done every Day. When all this is very secure, and mad=
e as directed, put=20

up your Boar, and take care that he is so placed, as never to see or even h=
ear any Hogs; for if he=20

does, he will pine away, and lose more good Flesh in one Day than he gets i=
n a Fortnight: He=20

must then be fed with as many Pease as he will eat, and as much skim'd Milk=
, or flet Milk, as is=20

necessary for him. This method must be used with him till he declines his M=
eat, or will eat very=20

little of it, and then the Pease must be left off, and he must be fed with =
Paste made of Barley Meal,=20

made into Balls as big as large Hen-Eggs, and still the Skim-Milk continued=
, till you find him=20

decline that likewise, at which time he will be fit to kill for Brawn; the =
Directions for making of=20

which, with the Pickle for it, see in the Month of _December_. During the t=
ime he is thus feeding,=20

great care must be taken that he has always Meat before him, for neglect in=
 this will spoil the=20

whole Design.  This is the way of feeding a Boar for Brawn, but I cannot he=
lp thinking 'tis a little=20

barbarous, and especially as the Creature is by some People put in so close=
 a Pen, that as I hear,=20

it cannot lie down all the while 'tis feeding; and at last, considering the=
 expence of Food, Brawn is=20

but an insipid kind of Meat: however, as some are lovers of it, it is neces=
sary to prescribe the=20

method which should be used in the preparing it.  In this Month we have ple=
nty of Artichokes and it=20

is a good Season to put them up for Winter use, to be used simply, or to be=
 put in Sauces, or in=20

compound Dishes; they are easily dried or pickled, to be kept, and if they =
are not gather'd as soon=20

as they are in their perfection, they will lose the goodness of their Heart=
s, or the Bottoms, as some=20

call them. In a plentiful Year of them I have had a great number dried for =
Winter use, in the=20



following manner.    Concerning the gathering, and ordering Artichokes for =
drying.  In the gathering=20

of Artichokes, observe, that the Leaves of what is call'd the Artichoke be =
pointing inwards, and lie=20

close at the Top, for then the Bottom will be large and full; but if you fi=
nd many of the Leaves of the=20

Artichoke spread from the Top, then the Choke, or bristly part is shot so m=
uch, that it has drawn=20

out much of the Heart of the Artichoke; and as the Flower comes forward, th=
e more that grows, the=20

thinner will be the Bottom, which is the best part of it.  When you cut the=
 Artichoke, cut it with a=20

long Stalk, that when you use it you may clear it well of its Strings, whic=
h will else spoil the=20

goodness of the Bottom, wherein the Strings will remain; to do this, lay th=
e Artichoke upon a=20

Table, and hold it down hard with one Hand, while with the other Hand you p=
ull the Stalk hard up=20

and down, till it quits the Artichoke, and will then pull away the Strings =
along with it; this being=20

done, lay the Artichokes in Water for an Hour, and then put them into a Ket=
tle of cold Water to boil,=20

till they are tender enough to separate the Leaves and the Chokes from them=
. When this is done,=20

lay the Hearts, or Bottoms upon a Cullender, or some other thing, to drain =
conveniently; then dry=20

them upon a Wire Sieve, or Gridiron, in a gentle Oven, by degrees, till the=
y are as hard as Wood.=20

These will keep good twelve Months if they are laid by in a dry Place.  Whe=
n we want to use these=20

for boiling, frying, or to accompany other Meats, we must put them into war=
m Water, often=20

repeating it to them for eight and forty Hours, by which means they will co=
me to themselves, and=20

be as good when they come to be scalded as if they were fresh gather'd. But=
 they may also be=20

preserv'd after the following manner.    Second Way to preserve Artichokes.=
  Having chosen your=20

Artichokes according to the above Directions, cut the Bottoms, with a sharp=
 Knife, clear of their=20

Leaves and their Chokes, flinging them immediately into cold Water, to prev=
ent their turning black.=20

When they have lain in the Water for seven or eight Minutes, wash them and =
drain them a little,=20

and then fling them into Wheat or Barley Flower, so that they be all over c=
over'd with it; after=20

which, lay them upon Wire Sieves, or Pieces of Wicker-work to dry in an Ove=
n gently, till they are=20

quite dry and hard: these must be kept in a dry Place, and when they are to=
 be used, steep them=20

in Water four and twenty Hours, and boil them till they are tender, they wi=
ll eat as well as if they=20

were fresh cut.  The Artichoke may likewise be pickled in the following man=
ner.    To preserve=20

Artichokes by Pickling.  Gather and prepare your Artichokes as before, and =
put them into cold=20

Water to boil, with a moderate quantity of Salt; then take them off the Fir=
e, and let the Water stand=20

in the Kettle for a quarter of an hour, till the Salt is settled to the bot=
tom; then pour off your Water=20

clear into an Earthen glazed Vesel where you design to put your Artichokes,=
 and clearing them=20

from the Leaves and Choaks, wash them well in two or three Waters, and put =
them in the Brine or=20

Pickle they were boiled in, when both are quite cold; upon which pour as mu=
ch Oil as will cover it=20

half an Inch thick, or where Oil is wanting, melted Butter will serve: be s=
ure you put so much as will=20

keep the Air from the Artichokes. Some will add some Vinegar to the Water, =
but that is at pleasure;=20

when this is done, cover the top of the Earthen Pot close with Paper, and l=
ay a Board over it to=20

keep it from any Air, or else cover the Pot with a wet Bladder, and tie it =
down close. They will keep=20

good a Year, and when we want to use them, lay them to steep in cold Water =
to take out the Salt;=20

you may shift the Water three or four times, they will be the better for it=
, and then use them in=20

Pyes, or other compound Dishes.  In _Holland_ I have often eaten the small =
Suckers of Artichokes=20

fry'd, which have made an agreeable Dish. The Receipt for preparing them is=
 the following.    To=20

fry small Suckers of Artichokes, or small Artichokes.  Gather the young Hea=
ds of Artichokes, and=20



boil them with Salt and Water till they are tender; these Artichokes should=
 be no bigger than=20

middling Apples; split these in four or six Parts each, flower them well, a=
nd fry them crisp in Hogs-

lard, and eat them with Butter, Pepper, and a little Verjuice or Orange-Jui=
ce.  It is a common=20

practice in _France_ to eat the small Heads of Artichokes raw, with Vinegar=
, Pepper, and Salt; the=20

Method is to pull off the single Leaves, and dip=20
