remember, sir," rejoined=20

Yvonne quietly. "I in my turn entreat you to have no fears for me."  Even w=
hile she said this, the=20

man pushed the door open.   III  Yvonne had meant to be brave. Above all sh=
e had meant to be=20

obedient. But even so, she could not help recoiling at sight of the place w=
here she had just been=20

told she must wait patiently and silently for an hour, or even two.  The ro=
om into which her guide=20

now gently urged her forward was large and low, only dimly lighted by an oi=
l-lamp which hung from=20

the ceiling and emitted a thin stream of black smoke and evil smell. Such a=
ir as there was, was=20

foul and reeked of the fumes of alcohol and charcoal, of the smoking lamp a=
nd of rancid grease.=20

The walls had no doubt been whitewashed once, now they were of a dull greyi=
sh tint, with here=20

and there hideous stains of red or the marks of a set of greasy fingers. Th=
e plaster was hanging in=20

strips and lumps from the ceiling; it had fallen away in patches from the w=
alls where it displayed=20

the skeleton laths beneath. There were two doors in the half-breeds decided=
 him.  "If all the half-

breeds in Rud River wass to go as mad as buffalo-bulls wi' their tails cut =
off, I would go," said=20

Duncan junior, with quiet decision of tone and manner, as he lighted his pi=
pe.  "Ay, it iss that same=20

you would do if you wass to be hanged to-morrow for doin' it, Tuncan," retu=
rned the old man=20

testily, as he fired cloudlets in rapid succession from his compressed lips=
.  Duncan junior was=20

equally firm in replying to his sister's remonstrances later in the day.  "=
You know, dear Duncan,"=20

she said, "that, although I believe you to be quite innocent, most of the h=
alf-breeds are of the=20

opposite opinion, and some of them are very revengeful, especially when the=
y think they have=20

been deceived or unjustly treated."  "I do not fear the half-breeds," repli=
ed the youth gruffly.  "Of=20

course you don't, Duncan, but you know that, though most of them are good, =
trusty men, some are=20

mean fellows, who would not hesitate to shoot you in the smoke and confusio=
n of the hunt.  Do=20

give up the idea, for my sake, dear."  "I would do much for your sake, Elsp=
ie, but not this, for it iss=20
