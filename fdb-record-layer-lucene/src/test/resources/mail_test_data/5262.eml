nificant value?  There=20

was a slow, blurred, awkward-seeming interruption. Its content was not comp=
rehensible to Telzey=20

at all, but in some unmistakable manner it was defined as Tick-Tock's thoug=
ht.  A pause as the=20

circle of speakers stopped to consider whatever TT had thrown into the deba=
te.  Then another=20

impression ... one that sent a shock of fear through Telzey as it rose heav=
ily into her awareness.=20

Its sheer intensity momentarily displaced the tape-reading symbolism. A sav=
age voice seemed to=20

rumble:  "Toss the tender small-bite to me"--malevolent crimson eyes fixed =
on Telzey from=20

somewhere not far away--"and let's be done here!"  Startled, stammering pro=
test from Tick-Tock,=20

accompanied by gusts of laughter from the circle. Great sense of humor thes=
e characters had,=20

Telzey thought bitterly. That crimson-eyed thing wasn't joking at all!  Mor=
e laughter as the circle=20

caught her thought. Then a kind of majority opinion found sudden expression=
:  "Small-bite _is_=20

learning! No harm to wait--We'll find out quickly--Let's...."  The tape end=
ed; the voices faded; the=20

colors went blank. In whatever jumbled-up form she'd been getting the impre=
ssions at that point--

Telzey couldn't have begun to describe it--the whole thing suddenly stopped=

day the cardinal, with his secretary and his chaplain, arrived. Monsignore =
Catesby received his=20

eminence at the station and knelt and kissed his hand as he stepped from th=
e carriage. The=20

monsignore had wonderfully manoeuvred that the whole of the household shoul=
d have been=20

marshalled to receive this prince of the Church, and perhaps have performed=
 the same ceremony:=20

no religious recognition, he assured them, in the least degree involved, on=
ly an act of not unusual=20

respect to a foreign prince; but considering that the bishop of the diocese=
 and his suite were that=20

day expected, to say nothing of the Presbyterian guardian, probably arrivin=
g by the same train,=20

Lothair would not be persuaded to sanction any ceremony whatever. Lady St. =
Jerome and Miss=20

Arundel, however, did their best to compensate for this omission with rever=
ences which a posture-

master might have envied, and certainly would not have surpassed. They seem=
ed to sink into the=20

earth, and then slowly and supernaturally to emerge. The bishop had been at=
 college with the=20

cardinal and intimate with him, though they now met for the first time sinc=
e his secession=E2=80=94a not=20

uninteresting rencounter. The bishop was high-church, and would not himself=
 have made a bad=20

cardinal,=20


_
Tick-Tock stood beside the terrace, looking at her. An air of hazy unrealit=
y still hung about the=20

garden.  She might have flipped! She didn't think so; but it certainly seem=
ed possible! Otherwise ...=20

Telzey made an attempt to sort over what had happened.  Something _had_ bee=
n in the garden!=20

Something had been inside her mind. Something that was at home on Jontarou.=
  There'd been a=20

feeling of perhaps fifty or sixty of these ... well, beings. Alarming being=
s! Reckless, wild, hard ...=20

and that red-eyed nightmare! Telzey shuddered.  They'd contacted Tick-Tock =
first, during the=20

night. TT understood them better than she could. Why? Telzey found no immed=
iate answer.  Then=20

Tick-Tock had tricked her into letting her mind be invaded by these beings.=
 There must have been=20

a very definite reason for that.  She looked over at Tick-Tock. TT looked b=
ack. Nothing stirred in=20

Telzey's thoughts. Between _them_ there was still no direct communication. =
 Then how had the=20

beings been able to get through to her?  Telzey wrinkled her nose. Assuming=
 this was real, it=20

seemed clear that the game of symbols she'd made up between herself and TT =
had provided the=20

opening. Her whole experience just now had been in the form of symbols, tra=
nslating whatever=20

occurred into something she could consciously grasp.  "Kitten-talk" was how=
 the beings referred to=20

the use of symbols; they seemed contemptuous of it. Never mind, Telzey told=
 herself; they'd=20

agreed she was learning.  The air over the grass appeared to flicker. Again=
 she had the=20

impression of reading words off a quickly moving, not quite visible tape.  =
"You're being taught and=20

you're learning," was what she seemed to read. "The question was whether yo=
u were capable of=20

partial understanding as your friend insisted. Since you were, everything e=
lse that can be done will=20

be accomplished very quickly."  A pause, then with a world. He was fond of =
society, and justified=20

his taste in this respect by the flattering belief that by his presence he =
was extending the power of=20

the Church; certainly favoring an ambition which could not be described as =
being moderate. The=20

bishop had no abstract prejudice against gentlemen who wore red hats, and u=
nder ordinary=20

circumstances would have welcomed his brother churchman with unaffected cor=
diality, not to say=20

sympathy; but in the present instance, however gracious his mien and honeye=
d his expressions,=20

he only looked upon the cardinal as a dangerous rival, intent upon clutchin=
g from his fold the most=20

precious of his flock, and he had long looked to this occasion as the one w=
hich might decide the=20

spiritual welfare and career of Lothair. The odds were not to be despised. =
There were two=20

monsignores in the room besides the cardinal, but the bishop was a man of c=
ontrivance and=20

resolution, not easily disheartened or defeated. Nor was he without allies.=
 He did not count much=20

on the university don, who was to arrive on the morrow in the shape of the =
head of an Oxford=20

house, though he was a don of magnitude. This eminent personage had already=
 let Lothair slip=20

from his influence. But the bishop had a subtle counsellor in his chaplain,=
 who wore as good a=20

cassock as any monsignore, and he brought with him also a trusty archdeacon=
 in a purple coat,=20

whose countenance was quite entitled to a place in the Acta Sanctorum.  It =
was amusing to=20

observe the elaborate courtesy and more than Christian kindness which the r=
ival prelates and their=20

official followers extended to each other. But under all this unction on bo=
th sides were unceasing=20

observation, and a vigilance that never flagged; and on both sides there wa=
s an uneasy but=20

irresistible conviction that they were on the eve of one of the decisive ba=
ttles of the social world.=20

Lord Culloden=20


_
small-bite! Odd and with incomprehensibilities, but well-formed--"  One of =
the beings, and a fairly=20

friendly one--at least not unfriendly. Telzey framed a tentative mental que=
stion. "Who are you?"=20

"You'll know very soon." The flickering ended; she realized she and the que=
stion had been=20

dismissed for the moment. She looked over at Tick-Tock again.  "Can't _you_=
 talk to me now,=20

TT?" she asked silently.  A feeling of hesitation.  "Kitten-talk!" was the =
impression that formed itself=20

with length appeared with his daughters, Ladies Flora and Grizell. They wer=
e quite as tall as Mr.=20

Putney Giles had reported, but very pretty, with radiant complexions, sunny=
 blue eyes, and flaxen=20

looks. Their dimples and white shoulders and small feet and hands were much=
 admired. Mr. Giles=20

also returned with Apollonia, and, at length, also appeared the rival of Lo=
rd Carisbrooke, his grace=20

of Brecon.  Lothair had passed a happy morning, for he had contrived, witho=
ut difficulty, to be the=20

companion=20
