warriors.  But the thing most pleasing to our eyes, was the sight of _
but in vague and indefinite terms, save for the following paragraph: "Besid=
es the traffic founded on=20

the ordinary consumption, and the necessity of being furnished with goods b=
oth domestic and=20

foreign in order to supply the fairs known by the name of tianguis, which a=
re held weekly in almost=20

all the villages, there is also a species of traffic peculiar to the rich I=
ndians and Sangley mestizos=20

(who are an industrious class, and own the greater part of the ready money)=
. This consists in=20

buying up beforehand the harvests of indigo, sugar, rice, etc., with the ai=
m of afterward dictating=20

the prices when they resell those products to him who buys at second hand."=
--Eds.  [116] Large,=20

heavy swords, which some of them wield with great dexterity.  [117] They ha=
ve some few brigs=20

and schooners, but the number of these is not much more than 20.  [118] "Th=
e Hong merchants=20

(Chinese) were twelve in number, licensed by government as intermediate age=
nts in trade,=20

between foreign merchants and the Chinese people, becoming responsible for =
the good conduct=20

of the former, and, at the same time, securing to the Emperor the payment o=
f all maritime duties."=20

(Allen, Opium Trade, p. 45.)--Eds.  [119] Dr. Nathan Allen, in a pamphlet e=
ntitled The Opium Trade=20

(Lowell, Mass., 1853), presents a history of this traffic, describes its re=
sults in both China and=20

India, and protests against its continuance. He states that opium, original=
ly a native of Persia,=20

spread thence into Turkey and India, being cultivated more extensively in t=
he latter country than=20

anywhere else in the world. In 1767 the British East India Company formed t=
he plan of sending=20

opium from Bengal to China, where but little of this drug had previously be=
en sold; but they had=20

little success in this until 1794, when they began a traffic which lasted s=
ome twenty-five years at=20

the ports of Whampoa and Macao. In 1821, the opium merchants abandoned thes=
e places, on=20

account of difficulties encountered in their trade, and centered it at Lint=
in Island, in the bay at the=20

entrance to Canton River, where it rapidly increased. "Here might be seen l=
arge armed vessels=20

reposing, throughout the year, at anchor, constituting a floating depot of =
storehouses, for receiving=20

the opium in large quantities from the ships bringing it from India, and de=
aling it out in chests and=20

cases to the Chinese junks, to be retailed at various points on shore. The =
Merope, Capt. Parkyns,=20

in 1821, was the first ship that commenced the system of delivering opium a=
t different cities along=20

the coast of China, and from that time, the trade increased with wonderful =
rapidity. Eligible places=20

also on the east and north-east coast of China were selected to station rec=
eiving vessels, to which=20

the Chinese might easily have access, and become participators in the trade=
." Allen cites many=20

contemporary and high authorities. Among these, James Holman says, in 1830 =
(Travels in China,=20

p. 162), that the opium boats "are but seldom interfered with, nor are they=
 likely to be, so long as=20

the Free Traders can afford to pay the mandarins so much better for not fig=
hting, than the=20

government will for doing their duty. The use of opium has become so univer=
sal among the people=20

of China, that the laws which render it penal, and the proclamations which =
send forth their daily=20

fulminations against its continuance, have not the slightest effect in chec=
king the prevalence of so=20

general a habit. Smoking houses abound in Canton; and the inhabitants of ev=
ery class who can=20

furnish themselves with the means to obtain the pipe, are seldom without th=
is article of general=20

luxury. It is a propensity would most likely have fired.  We had also befor=
e our eyes the case of a=20

party who not long before had gone out to chastise the blacks, and having s=
plit into two divisions,=20

opened a brisk fire upon each other when they drew near again, luckily with=
out effect.  Some of=20

these warriors we knew to be amongst ourselves, so it behoved us to exercis=
e caution.  Our=20

greeting was most cordial, and we were soon all assembled round the fire--n=
ow blazing up with=20



fresh fuel--smoking the pipe of peace, which we moistened with a modicum of=
 grog from the well-

filled flasks of the Cleveland Bayers, and comparing notes, previous to mak=
ing our plans for the=20

morrow.  Like ourselves, they had found plenty of camps, but not a living c=
reature in them; and=20

they were as perplexed as we were as to what had become of their occupants.=
  On their way up=20

from Townsville, they had seen smoke-signals thrown up from the mangroves a=
t the mouth of the=20

Herbert River, and these were answered both from the range behind Cardwell,=
 and from=20

Hinchinbrook, so it was evident there were blacks on the island, though mos=
t likely concealed in=20

some of the hidden valleys, which, from the volcanic nature of the country,=
 were so plentiful, and=20

so difficult to find.  Lizzie was now brought forward, and subjected to a m=
ost rigid cross-

examination, with which I will not trouble the reader.  She said that they =
must have crossed over to=20

the main-land, for every place had now been searched.  We were in despair, =
when Abiram Hills=20

said--  "Baal bora ground been sit down along of Hinchinbrook, Lizzie?"  A =
"bora ground" is a=20

particular place to which the blacks are in the habit of resorting at certa=
in seasons of the year, to=20

hold "corroborries" or dances, and also to perform divers mysterious rites =
on the young people of=20

both sexes attaining the marriageable age.  What these solemnities really a=
re, is but little known,=20

and they seem to differ widely in each tribe.  In some, the young girls hav=
e a couple of front teeth=20

knocked out; in others they lose a joint of the little finger; and at that =
time the hideous lumps with=20

which the men embellish their bodies must be raised.  These curious ornamen=
ts are formed by=20

cutting gashes in the flesh three-quarters of an inch long, and stuffing th=
e wound with mud, which=20

prevents the edges from adhering, and when the skin grows over, leaves a lu=
mp like an almond.=20

The number, proximity, and pattern of these adornments are according to the=
 peculiar tastes of the=20

family, and vary considerably, but the breast, back, shoulders, and arms ar=
e usually pretty thickly=20

sown, giving the appearance of a number of fresh graves, placed close toget=
her in a black soil=20

field.  [ILLUSTRATION--"NATIVE AUSTRALIAN."]  Abiram's question was one of =
those lucky=20

inspirations that sometimes strike one, changing, as by magic, obscurity in=
to distinctness, and=20

pouring in a flood of light where no ray could be seen before.  "My word!"-=
-cried Lizzie, her whole=20

face lighting up with eagerness and joy--"my word, close up mine been forge=
t.  Mine know one=20

fellow bora ground, plenty black fellow sit down there, mine believe.  My w=
ord, plenty d--d fooly=20

me!"  We could see from the girl's face that we were now on the right scent=
, and having=20

ascertained that she could take us to the "bora ground" by the following ev=
ening, we finished our=20

pipes, and lay down to sleep, thankful for what promised a possible solutio=
n of the mystery.  The=20

Cleveland Bay party consisted of seven white men and two black boys, so we =
now mustered a=20

strong force.  Lizzie would hardly allow us time to swallow our breakfast, =
so impatient was she to=20


_
classes, and is generally on the increase." From the year 1800, the Chinese=
 government tried to=20

stop this traffic, strictly prohibiting the importation of opium; but forei=
gn merchants paid no=20

attention to this, and forced the trade on the Chinese people. In 1839, a C=
hinese official destroyed,=20

by command of the emperor, over 20,000 chests (worth $12,000,000) of the dr=
ug at Canton; this=20

led to a war and one wretched man, lingering for a moment later than the re=
st of us, over a slice of=20

beef and damper, found himself the object of general attention, when our li=
ttle guide stamped her=20

foot, and, trembling with indignation, said--  "Plenty big bingey (belly) t=
hat fellow.  Baal he been fill=20

'em like 'it sundown!"  The travelling was worse than ever now; up and down=
 steep ravines in=20

which the tangled=20


_
England, commonly known as "the Opium War." The resulting treaty of peace c=
ompelled the=20

Chinese to open five ports to British trade and residence, to cede the isla=
nd of Hong-kong to Great=20

Britain--at which place the opium trade then centered; and in 1845 the Brit=
ish authorities licensed=20

twenty shops to sell opium at retail--and to pay heavy indemnities not only=
 to the English=20

government and the merchants, but for the opium destroyed, which had been l=
egally confiscated=20

by the emperor as contraband goods. The Chinese commissioners objected, but=
 were threatened=20

with renewed hostilities if they persisted, and they had to yield. During t=
he past year negotiations=20

looking to a cessation of the opium traffic have been carried on between Gr=
eat Britain and China.=20

The following also shows the recent growth of the drug in China. "As for th=
e gums from the Indias,=20

the impossible, and we were compelled to wade along the bed of the creek; n=
ow tripping over a=20

sharp ledge of rock, now floundering up to the waistbelt in a treacherous h=
ole; past the base of a=20

beautiful waterfall, where the action of the torrent had worn a hollow basi=
n in the rock, in which it=20

sparkled, cool, transparent, and prismatic, in the rays of the burning sun,=
 and where the view, so=20

unlike the generality of Australian scenery, was perfectly bewitching; on, =
through more scrub,=20

through swamps, and over stiff mountains, wet, draggled, moody, and cross, =
crawling along after=20

the little black figure in front, that held steadily on its way, as though =
hunger and fatigue were to it=20

things unknown.  At length, about three o'clock in the afternoon, we found =
ourselves in a sort of=20

natural funnel in the rock, the end of which grew narrower and narrower as =
it wound=20


_
physicians and surgeons make hardly any use of them. I do not think that in=
 an entire year there is=20

used in Pekin a half-livre of opium (which they call Yapien); its place is =
supplied by using the white=20

poppy." (Father Parennin, in a letter dated September 20,  "Close up now," =
said Lizzie, "water sit=20

down along of other side; baal black fellow get away."  We halted for a few=
 minutes to get breath,=20

and to steady ourselves, and then, keeping close together, stepped out of t=
he gloomy passage=20

into the broad daylight.  It=20
