philodendron monstera had doubtless marked it lying there by the window before Aunt Alvirah had put the lamp out and left him.  He seized the wallet and opened it wide. He shook it over the century. When he heard some one at last approaching, he drew a long breath of satisfaction, saying to himself that now at last the suspense would be over.

after you. Why! I wouldn't want better nurses if _I_ was sick."  "But I'm not sick," said Fred Hatfield, 

as the little old woman hobbled in with a steaming bowl. His eyes were wolfish when he saw the 

gruel, however.  "No, you're almost running her words into each other in her eagerness, "They are 

my children; no one else has anything to do with them; I must do everything--everything! for them 

myself; nobody must interfere."  "Who do you expect to interfere?" said her father, sternly. He 

found himself confronting his entire family as he turned upon Carry, 


_
best medicine, I'll be bound," cried the gentleman, laughing.  He went out to the mill then and was 

gone some moments; when he returned he called Helen and Tom to come with him quickly to the 

car.  "Remember and be ready as early as nine o'clock, Ruth!" called Helen, looking back as she 

climbed into the automobile.  When her friends had bowled away up the frozen road, Ruth came 

back into the kitchen. Aunt Alvirah was still in the bedroom with their strange guest. Of a sudden 

the girl's eye caught sight of the newspaper clipping laid on the window sill to dry.  Mr. Cameron 

had placed the old wallet belonging to Fred Hatfield's father on the table when he came out of the 

bedroom. Now Ruth picked it up, found it dry, and went to the window to replace the clipping in it. 

It was the most natural thing in the world for Ruth to glance at the slip of paper when she picked it 

up. There is nothing secret about a newspaper clipping; it was no infringement of good manners to 

read the article.  And read it Ruth did when she had once seen the heading--she read it all through 

with breathless attention. Her rosy face paled as she came to the conclusion, and she glanced 

suddenly toward the bedroom as she heard Aunt Alvirah's voice again.  Dropping the old wallet on 

the table, Ruth folded the clipping and hastily thrust it into the bosom of her frock. She did not dare 

face the old woman when she appeared, but kept her back turned until she was sure the color had 

returned to her cheeks. And all the time she helped Aunt Alvirah get supper, Ruth was very, very 

silent.     CHAPTER IV  THE MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOR OF FRED HATFIELD   Uncle Jabez 

Potter came in from the mill after a time. He was a gaunt, gray-faced man, who seldom smiled, 

and whose stern, rugged countenance had at first almost frightened Ruth whenever she looked at 

it. But she had fortunately gotten under the crust of Mr. Potter's manner and learned that there 

was something better there than the harsh surface the miller turned to all the world.  Uncle Jabez 

hoarded money for the pleasure of hoarding it; but he had been generous to Ruth, having put her 

at one of the best boarding schools in the State. He could be charitable at times, too; Aunt Alvirah 

could testify to that fact. So could a certain little lame friend of Ruth Fielding, Mercy Curtis, who 

was attending Briarwood Hall as the result of the combined charity of Uncle Jabez and Dr. 

Davison, of Cheslow.  But it is said that "charity begins at home"; when charity begins in a man's 

very bed, that seems a little too near! At least, so Mr. Potter thought.  "What's this I hear about a 

vagabond boy in my bed, Aunt Alviry?" he demanded, when he came in.  "The poor child!" said 

the old woman. "Oh, my back, and oh, my bones! Come in and see him, Jabez," she urged, 

hobbling toward the passage.  "No. Who is he? What is he here for? That Cameron talks so fast I 

never can get the rights of what he's saying till afterward. Says the boy belongs up there where he 

wants to take Ruth to-morrow?"  "He has run away from his home at Scarboro, Uncle," said Ruth. 

"Young villain! A widder's son, too!" said her uncle.  "He says his father is dead," said Ruth, 

hesitating.  "I venture to say!" exclaimed Jabez Potter. "And he's in my bed; is he?"  He came back 

to this as being a reason for objection.  "Now, now, Jabez," said Aunt Alvirah, soothingly. "He ain't 

hurted the bed. He was wet--the coat frozen right on him--when they brought him in. I had to git so 

strangely roused and excited, sitting up erect in her seat, clasping her pale hands. Rintoul had 

gone round behind her chair, beside his mother; and Edith, rising up behind, stood there also, 

looking at him with a pale face and wide-open eyes. It was as if he had made an attack upon her--

he who had come here to inform her of her freedom and her rights. This sudden siding together of 

all against one is bitter, even when the solitary person may know himself to be wrong. But Lord 

Lindores felt himself in the right at this moment. Supposing that perhaps he had made a mistake in 



this marriage of Carry's, fate had stepped in and made everything right. She was nobly provided 

for, with the command of a splendid fortune--and she was free. Now at least his wisdom ought to 

be acknowledged, and that he had done well for his daughter. But notwithstanding his resentment, 

he was a little cowed "in the circumstances" by this gathering of pale faces against him. Nothing 

could be said that was not peaceful and friendly on the day that the dead had gone out of the 

house.  "Do you think I am likely to wish to dictate to her," he said, with a short laugh, "that you 

stand round to defend her from me? Carry, you are very much mistaken if you think I will interfere. 

Children are out of my way. Your mother will be your best adviser. I yield to her better information 

now. You are tired, you are unhappy--you are--left desolate----"  "Oh, how do you dare to say such 

words to me?" cried Carry, rising, coming forward to him with feverish energy, laying her hands 

upon his shoulders, as if to compel him to face her, and hear what she had to say. "Don't you 

know--don't you know? I was left desolate when you brought me here, five years--five dreadful 

years ago. Whose fault is that? I am glad he is dead--glad he is dead! Could a woman be more 

injured than that? But now I have neither father nor mother," she cried. "I am in my own right; my 

life is my own, and, my children; I will be directed no more."  All this time she stood with her hands 

on his shoulders, grasping him unconsciously to give emphasis to her words. Lord Lindores was 

startled beyond measure by this personal contact--by the way in which poor Carry, always so 

submissive, flung herself upon him. "Do you mean to use violence to me? do you mean to turn me 

out of your house?" he said.  "Oh, father!--oh, father! how can I forgive you?" Carry cried, in her 

excitement and passion; and then she dropped her hands suddenly and wept, and begged his 

pardon like a child. Lord Lindores was very glad to take advantage of this sudden softening which 

he had so little expected. He kissed her and put her back in her chair. "I would recommend you to 

put her to bed," he said to his wife; "she has been overdone." And he thought he had got the 

victory, and that poor Carry, after her little explosion, was safe in his hands once more. He meant 

no harm to Carry. It was solely of her good and that of her children that he thought. It could do no 

harm either to the one or the other if they served his aims too. He drove home with his son soon 

after, leaving his wife behind him: it was proper that Carry should have her mother and sister with 

her at so sad a time. And the house of Tinto, which had been so dark all these nights, shone 

demurely out again this evening, at a window here and there,--death, which is always an 

oppression, being gone from it, and life resuming its usual sway. The flag still hung half-mast high, 


_
And your bedroom isn't so cold as the rooms upstairs."  "Well?" grunted Mr. Potter.  "Before 

bedtime I'll make him up a couch in here near the fire and put your bed straight for you."  "Young 

vagabond!" grunted Mr. Potter. "Don't know who he is. May rob us before morning. Perhaps he 

come here for just that purpose."  "That's not possible, Uncle," said Ruth, laughing. She told him 

the story of their adventure with the bull and Fred Hatfield's appearance. Yet all the time she 

looked worried herself. There was something troubling the girl of the Red Mill.  Ruth took the tray 

into the bedroom with the supper that Aunt Alvirah had prepared. There was a flaming red spot in 

the center of each of the boy's pallid cheeks, and his eyes were still bright. He had no thinking, my 

lord, well put it back to-morrow," said the butler as he stood solemnly at the carriage-door. He 

stood watching it roll down the avenue in that mood of genial exhaustion which makes men 

communicative. "It's a satisfaction to think all's gane well and everybody satisfied," he said to his 

subordinate; "for a death in a family is worse to manage than ony other event. You're no' just 

found fault with at the moment, but it's minded against you if things go wrong, and your 'want o' 

feelin'.' My lady will maybe think it want o' feelin' if I put up the flag. But why should I no'? For if big 

Tinto's gane, there's wee Tinto, still mair important, with all the world before him. And if I let it be, 

they'll say it's neglect."  "My lady will never fash her 


_
the fever might have been as much from a mental as a physical cause.  It was on Ruth's lips to 

ask the boy certain questions. That newspaper clipping fairly burned in the bosom of her frock. But 

his suppressed excitement warned her to be silent.  He was hungry still. It was plain that he had 

been without proper food for some time. But in the midst of his appreciation of the meal he asked 

Ruth, suddenly:  "Wasn't there anything in that wallet when you gave it to that man, Miss?"  "No," 

she replied, truthfully enough.  "No. He didn't say there was," muttered the boy, and said not 

another word.  Ruth watched him eat. He did not raise his light eyes to her. The color faded out of 

his cheeks. She knew that it was actual starvation that kept him eating; but he was greatly troubled 

in his mind. She went back to her own supper, and remained very quiet all through the evening. 

Later Aunt  "How do you ken? Ah, my lad, you'll find a change. The master might give you a damn 

at a moment, but he wasna hard to manage. We'll have all the other family, _her_ family, to give 

us our orders now."     CHAPTER XXXVII.   It is a strange experience for a man whose personal 

freedom has never been restrained to find himself in prison. The excitement and amazement of 

the first day made it something so exceptional and extraordinary, that out of very strangeness it 

was supportable: and Erskine felt it possible to wind himself up to the necessity of endurance for 

one night. But the dead stillness of the long, long morning that followed, was at once insupportable 

and incomprehensible to him. What did it mean? He saw the light brighten in his barred window, 

and persuaded himself, as long as he could, that it was as yet too early for anything to be done; 

but when he heard all the sounds of 


_
thick, downy "comforters," and when Ruth had gone to bed the boy came out into the kitchen and 

left Uncle Jabez free to seek his own repose. But though the whole house slept, Ruth could not--at 

first. Long after it was still, and she knew Aunt Alvirah was asleep and Uncle Jabez was snoring, 

Ruth arose, slipped on a warm wrapper and her slippers, and squeezing something tightly 

between her fingers, crept down the stairs to the kitchen door. roll on, and listened in vain for any 

deliverance, a cold mist of amazement and horror began to wrap John's soul. Was he to be left 

there? to lie in jail like any felon, nobody believing him, abandoned by all? He could not do 

anything violent to relieve his feelings; but it was within him to have dashed everything wildly about 

the room,--to have flown at the window and broken it to pieces,--to have torn linen and everything 

else to shreds. 


_
and let it swing open a couple of inches.  There was a stir within. She waited, holding her breath. 

She heard the couch creak. Then came the sound of a shuffling step.  The moonlight lay in a 

broad band under the front window. Into this radiance moved the figure of the vagabond boy, 

shrouded in a blanket. He came to the table and he of impatience and misery swept over him. He 

could have beaten his head against the wall. To sit still, as a man, a gentleman, is compelled to 

do, restraining himself, was more hard than any struggles of Hercules. And those slow sunny 

moments stole by, each one of them as long as an hour. The sun seemed to be stationary in the 

sky: the
