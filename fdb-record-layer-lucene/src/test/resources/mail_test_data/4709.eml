I never realized anything could long--how long it is: and all that has happened, and what we both have suffered----"  "Do you mean that you have gone over all that already?" John asked, amazed.

brushed away the snow and banked it up in a wall all about the platform, which served them for a 

camp. Then they scraped the fire out from the rock, threw on more branches (for the green ones 

would burn now that the fire was so hot) and crowded in between the blaze and the rock.  "This is 

just scrumptious!" declared Heavy. "We sha'n't freeze now."  "Not if we can keep the fire going," 

said Helen.  Being warm, they all tried to be cheerful thereafter. They told stories, they sang their 

school songs, and played guessing games.  Meanwhile, the wind shrieked through the forest 

above their Dunearn, or taken any apparent interest in his fate; but the profuse explanations and 

excuses of his friend had the usual effect in directing his mind towards this dereliction from evident 

duty. Beaufort overflowed in confused apologies. "I did go to Dunearn, but I was too late; and I did

fire, which was low, and poked it vigorously. He had nearly succeeded in making an end of it

very, very hungry, they always chew their boots. I can't spare my boots," quoth Jennie Stone, 

trying to joke to the bitter end.  The wind wheezed above them, the darkness fell with the snow. 

Beyond the glow of the pile of coals on the rocky ledge, the curtain of snow looked gray--then

hurriedly, "In short, Erskine, I have been to Tinto." There was a tremulous sound in his voice which
