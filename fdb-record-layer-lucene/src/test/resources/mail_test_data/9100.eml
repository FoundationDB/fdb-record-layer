you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain=
 a refund from the=20

person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8. =
 1.B.  "Project=20

Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be used on or associated=
 in any way with an=20

electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreem=
ent.  There are a few=20

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even=
 without complying=20

with the full terms of this agreement.  See paragraph 1.C below.  There are=
 a lot of things you can=20

do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of th=
is agreement and help=20

paragraph 1.E below.=20

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" o=
r PGLAF), owns a=20

compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic =
works.  Nearly all the=20

individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United S=
tates.  If an individual=20

work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in th=
e United States, we do=20

not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, di=
splaying or creating=20

derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gut=
enberg are removed.=20

Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission o=
f promoting free=20

access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in =
compliance with the=20

terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associate=
d with the work.=20

You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work=
 in the same format=20

with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it witho=
ut charge with others.=20

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern wha=
t you can do with this=20

work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change. =
 If you are outside the=20

United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of t=

downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating deri=
vative works based on=20

this work or any other Project Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no =
representations=20

concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the Unit=
ed States.  1.E.  Unless=20

you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:  1.E.1.  The followin=

nts of decorum, and=20

which may enable the beginner to avoid many a pitfall:  When two players =
=E2=80=9Cdrive off=E2=80=9D from the tee=20

they should always wait until the couple in front of them have made their s=
econd shot and walked=20

off from it. Thus confusion is averted and the proper distance maintained. =
It is a simple rule, but=20

one often broken.  Three players should always let a pair of players pass t=
hem. Not only should=20

they grant the desired position, but they should offer to do so before the =
question, =E2=80=9CMay we pass?=E2=80=9D=20

can be asked. The pair in question should (in case such permission is not v=
olunteered) ask politely=20

to be allowed to move forward. The yell of =E2=80=9CFore!=E2=80=9D is all t=
he strict rules of the game demand, but=20

the rules of breeding should come first.  A single player must give way to =
all larger parties. This is=20

but fair, since golf is, preeminently, a match; and those actively engaged =
in the contest should=20

have the right of way over a man who is merely practising. The =E2=80=9Csin=
gle player=E2=80=9D must recognize and=20

yield with good grace. If he desires unobstructed practise, let him choose =
some time when the=20

links are vacant.  [Sidenote: ON THE PUTTING GREEN]  Never drive on the =E2=
=80=9Cputting green=E2=80=9D when=20

other players are there =E2=80=9Cputting out.=E2=80=9D Players should not n=
eglect to get off the green the moment=20

 of safety, or a club-house corner where=20

waiting for others to =E2=80=9Cdrive off,=E2=80=9D never speak, cough, or i=
n any way distract the attention of the=20

player who is addressing the ball. Inconsiderate or ill-bred people in this=
 way spoil hundreds of=20

good drives and thousands of good tempers every year.  When a man and a wom=
an are playing=20

golf, the latter should always be allowed to precede on the first drive off=
 from the first tee.  A man,=20

playing against a woman, should not allow himself to get too far ahead of h=
er. Do not leave her to=20

plod on alone. This same rule applies when playing with another man. Do not=
 go after the ball after=20

a drive until your opponent drives. Then walk together in pursuit. Never go=
 ahead of your partner.=20

[Sidenote: AVOID HASTE IN GOLF]  Use no undue haste in golf. Never run!  If=
 you are not=20

employing a caddie, always offer to carry the clubs of the woman with whom =
you are playing. In=20

the same circumstances offer to make the tee from which she is to drive off=
. It is optional with her=20

whether or not to accept your offer.  When you have no caddie allow players=
 who have caddies to=20

pass you. They will go faster than you and should have the right of way.  N=
ever make unfavorable=20

ncreased in popularity=20

that it is almost a national pastime. And with its growing favor has sprung=
 up a noxious and=20

flourishing crop of bad manners. There seems to be something about the spee=
