tails.  The esoteric version=20

of the mystery given in the secret volumes may be told very briefly. The Bu=
ddhists have always=20

stoutly denied that their Buddha was, as alleged by the Brahmans, an Avatar=
a of Vishnu in the=20

same sense as a man is an incarnation of his Karmic ancestor. They deny it =
partly, perhaps,=20

because the  "Why?" asked Porthos.  "Because it is a grievous thing for me =
to meet again those=20

two men who caused the failure of our enterprise."  "And yet," said Porthos=
, "neither of them had=20

any advantage over us. I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fig=
ht, sword in hand."  "Yes,"=20

said D'Artagnan; "but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose?"  "O=
h!" said Porthos,=20

"you can't think that, D'Artagnan!"  D'Artagnan did not believe Athos to be=
 capable of a deception,=20

but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous.  "We must go," sai=

mysterious Principle in=20

Nature called "Maha Vishnu," which is not the God of that name, but a princ=
iple which contains=20

Bija, the seed of Avatarism or, in other words, is the potency and cause of=
 such divine=20

incarnations. All the World-Saviours, the Bodhisattvas and the Avataras, ar=
e the trees of salvation=20

grown out from the one seed, the Bija or "Maha Vishnu." Whether it be calle=
d Adi-Buddha=20

(Primeval Wisdom) or Maha Vishnu, it is all the same. Understood esoterical=
ly, Vishnu is both=20

Saguna and Nirguna (with and without attributes). In the first were afraid.=
 We who have faced fifty=20

foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place Royale."  "Yes, yes, b=
ut they took part with=20

the princes without apprising us of it. Athos and Aramis have played a game=
 with me which alarms=20

me. We discovered yesterday the truth; what is the use of going to-day to l=
earn something else?"=20

"You really have some distrust, then?" said Porthos.  "Of Aramis, yes, sinc=
e he has become an=20

abbe. You can't imagine, my dear fellow, the sort of man he is. He sees us =
on the road which=20

leads him to a bishopric, and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of hi=
s way."  "Ah, as regards=20

Aramis, that=20

ination of the totality of=20

spiritual wisdom in the Universe--Nirvana,(647) in short--and has as worshi=
ppers all philosophical=20

minds. In this esoteric sense the Lord BUDDHA _was_ an incarnation of Maha =
Vishnu.  This is=20

from the philosophical and purely spiritual standpoint. From the plane of i=
llusion, however, as one=20

would say, or from the terrestrial standpoint, those initiated _know_ that =
He was a direct=20

incarnation of one of the primeval "Seven Sons of Light" who are to be foun=

 us."  "Nonsense! He had=20

post himself behind us with his carbine."  "Planchet is a Frondeur," answer=
