 8. On this principle of arrangement the disagreeable force of the winds wi=
ll be shut out from dwellings and lines of houses. For if the streets run f=
ull in the face of the winds, their constant blasts rushing in from the ope=
n country, and then confined by narrow alleys, will sweep through them with=
 great violence. one kind, the pump may be used for the clarification of be=
er, oils, treacle, quicksilver, and such like, and for the preservation of =
fruit, meat, milk, etcetera, and with another mixture they propose to venti=
late mines and tunnels; water gardens; kill insects on trees and flowers; s=
often water for domestic uses, _
of treatment, will here be more quickly cured by the mildness that comes fr=
om the shutting out of=20

the winds. The diseases which are hard to cure in neighbourhoods such as th=
ose to which I have=20

referred above are catarrh, hoarseness, coughs, pleurisy, consumption, spit=
ting of blood, and all=20

others that are cured not by lowering the system but by building it up. The=
y are hard to cure, first,=20

because they are originally due to chills; secondly, because the patient's =
system being already=20

exhausted by disease, the air there, which is in constant agitation owing t=
o winds and therefore=20

deteriorated, takes all the sap of life out of their diseased bodies and le=
aves them more meagre=20

every day. On the other hand, a mild, thick air, without draughts and not c=
onstantly blowing back=20

and forth, builds up their frames by its unwavering steadiness, and so Jim =
to carry out a plan=20

which we have long cherished--to lodge together, with Martha Reading as our=
 landlady.  In truth,=20

anticipating some such good fortune as has been sent to us, we had some tim=
e ago devoted part=20

of our savings to the purpose of rescuing poor Martha from that miserable n=
eedlework which has=20

been slowly killing her so long.  We have taken and furnished a small house=
, Martha is already=20

installed as the owner, and we go there to-night for the first time, as lod=
gers."  "You don't say so!"=20

exclaimed Joe, laughing; "why, Bob, you and your friend act with as much pr=
omptitude as if you=20

had been regularly trained in the Fire-Brigade."  "We received much of our =
training _from_ it, if not=20

_in_ it," returned the strapping young man with the plain but pleasant coun=
tenance.  "Don't you=20

remember, Joe, how perseveringly we followed you in=20


_
diseases.  4. Some have held that there are only four winds: Solanus from d=
ue east; Auster from=20

the south; Favonius from due west; Septentrio from the north. But more care=
ful investigators tell us=20

that there are eight. Chief among such was Andronicus of Cyrrhus who in pro=
of built the marble=20

octagonal tower in Athens. On the several sides of the octagon he executed =
reliefs representing=20

the several winds, each facing the point from which it blows; and on top of=
 the tower he set a=20

conical shaped piece of marble and on this a bronze Triton with a rod outst=
retched in its right=20

hand. It was so contrived as to go round with the wind, always stopping to =
face the breeze and=20

holding its rod as a pointer directly over the representation of the wind t=
hat was blowing.  5. Thus=20

Eurus is placed to the southeast between Solanus and Auster: Africus to the=
 southwest between=20

Auster and Favonius; Caurus, or, as many call it, Corus, between Favonius a=
nd Septentrio; and=20

Aquilo between Septentrio and Solanus. Such, then, appears to have been his=
 device, including=20

the numbers and names of the wind and indicating the directions from which =
particular winds blow.=20

These facts being thus determined, to find the directions and quarters of t=
he winds your method of=20

procedure should be as follows.  6. In the middle of the city place a marbl=
e amussium, laying it=20

true by the level, or else let the spot be made so true by means of rule an=
d level that no amussium=20

is necessary. In the very centre of that spot set up a bronze gnomon or "sh=
adow tracker" (in Greek=20

[Greek: skiatheras]). At about the fifth hour in the morning, take the end =
of the shadow cast by this=20

gnomon, and mark it with a point. Then, opening your compasses to this poin=
t which marks the=20

length of the gnomon's shadow, describe a circle from the centre. In the af=
ternoon watch the=20

shadow of your gnomon as it lengthens, and when it once more touches the ci=
rcumference of this=20

circle and the shadow in the afternoon is equal in length to that of the mo=
rning, mark it with a point.=20

[Illustration: THE TOWER OF THE WINDS AT ATHENS]  7. From these two points =
describe _I_=20

was the Bloater and _he_ was Little Jim?"  "Remember it!  I should think I =
do," replied Joe.  "How=20

glad my Mary will be when she hears what you have done."  "But that's not a=
ll my news,"=20

continued the Bloater, (if we may presume to use the old name).  "Last, but=
 not least, Fred has=20

asked me to be his groom's-man.  He wrote me a very pathetic letter about i=
t, but omitted to=20

mention the day--not to be wondered at in the circumstances.  Poor Fred, hi=
s letter reminded me=20

of the blotted copies which I used to write with such trouble and sorrow at=
 the training school to=20

which my patron sent me."  "There's reason for the blotted letter besides t=
he excitement of his=20

approaching marriage," said Joe.  "He hurt his hand the last fire he attend=
ed, and it's in a sling just=20

now, so he must have taken it out, for temporary duty when he wrote to you.=
  The truth is that Fred=20

is too reckless for a fireman.  He's scarcely cool enough.  But I can infor=
m you as to the day; it is=20

Thursday next.  See that you are up to time, Bob."  "No fear of me being la=
te," replied the Bloater.=20

"By the way, have you heard of that new method of putting out fires that so=
mebody has invented?"=20

"I did hear of some nonsensical plan," replied Joe, with a slight expressio=
n of contempt, "but I don't=20

think it worth while to pay attention to things o' this sort.  There's noth=
in' can beat good cold water."=20

"I'm not so sure of that, Joe," replied his friend gravely.  "I have been r=
eading an account of it in=20

the _Insurance Guardian_, and it seems to me that there is something worth =
attending to in the=20

new plan.  It looks as if there was life in it, for a company is to be got =
up called the `Fire and Water=20

Company.'"  "But what _is_ this new plan?" asked Joe, sending forth a viole=
nt puff from his pipe,=20

as if to indicate that it would all end in smoke.  "Well, I'm not sure that=
 I've got a correct notion of it=20

myself, but my impression is that carbonic acid gas is the foundation-princ=
iple of it. Fire cannot=20



exist in the presence of this gas--wherever it goes extinction of fire is i=
nstantaneous, which is more=20

than you can say for=20


_
and through their intersection and the centre let a line be drawn to the ci=
rcumference of the circle=20

to give us the quarters of south and north. Then, using a sixteenth part of=
 the entire circumference=20

of the circle as a diameter, describe a circle with its centre on the line =
that into steam as fast as=20

you can pour it on, and after getting rid of it in this way, blaze up as fu=
rious as ever.  What this=20

company proposes to do is to saturate water with this carbonic acid gas mix=
ed with nitrogen, and=20

then pour that prepared water on fires.  Of course,=20


_
south, at the point where it crosses the circumference, and put points to t=
he right and left on the=20

circumference on the south side, repeating the process on the north side. F=
rom the four points=20

thus obtained draw lines intersecting the centre from one side of the circu=
mference to the other.=20

Thus we shall have an eighth part of the circumference set out for Auster a=
nd another for=20

Septentrio. The rest of the entire circumference is then to be divided into=
 three equal parts on each=20

side, and thus we have designed a figure equally apportioned among the eigh=
t winds. Then let the=20

directions of your streets and alleys be laid down on the lines of division=
 between the quarters=20

much water were required, such a plan would never succeed, but a very small=
 quantity is said to=20

be sufficient.  It seems that some testing experiments of a very satisfacto=
ry kind have been made=20

recently--so you see, Joe, it is time to be looking out for a new professio=
n!"  "H'm.  I'll stick to the=20

old brigade, at all events till the new company beats us from the field.  P=
erhaps when that happens=20

they'll enrol some of us to work the--what d'ye call 'em?--soda-water engin=
es.  They'll have=20

engines of course, I suppose?"  "Of course," replied the Bloater; "moreover=
, they mean to turn=20

their prepared water to good account when there are no fires to put out.  I=
t is said that the=20
