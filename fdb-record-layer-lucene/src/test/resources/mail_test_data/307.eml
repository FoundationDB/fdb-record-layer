Before the people had got to sleep it was almost dracaena marginata in the Bronx Zoo, in New York, with his wings spread out, measured a little short of ten feet from tip to tip. Measure ten feet out on the ground and then imagine a bird with that wing stretch.  This same condor in the the fortress.  The Governor of Louisburg was M. Duchambon.  On the fateful night a ball was given in the town, which the Governor, his officers, and soldiers attended.  Before the people had got to sleep it was almost _
loosened by the blast, Tom, one day, taking his electric rifle with him, went up the mountain under 

which the big bore ran.  He located, by computation, the spot beneath which the end of the tunnel 

then was, and began collecting samples of the outcropping ledge. He wanted to analyze these 

pieces of stone later. Koku was with him, and, giving the giant a bag of stones to carry, Tom 

walked on rather idly.  It was a wild and desolate region in which he found himself on the side of 

the mountain. Beyond him stretched towering and snow-clad peaks, and high in the air were small 

specks, which he knew to be condors, watching with their eager eyes for their offal food.  As Tom 

and Koku made their way along the mountain trail they came unexpectedly upon an Indian 

workman who was gathering herbs and bark, an industry by which many of the natives added to 

their scanty livelihood. The woman was familiar with the appearance of the white men, and 

nodded in friendly fashion.  Tom passed on, thinking of many things, when he was suddenly 

startled by a scream from the woman. It was a scream of such terror and agony that, for the 

moment, Tom was stunned into inactivity. Then, as he turned, he saw a great condor sweeping 

down out of the air, the wind fairly whistling through the big, outstretched wings.  "Jove!" 

ejaculated Tom. "Can the bird be going to attack the woman?"  But this was not the object of after 

night they tried to wear out the garrison, but Mascarene had now, by his patience and good spirits, 

brought all to his way of thinking.  Try as they would, the French could make no impression on the 

sturdy ramparts of Annapolis.  Duvivier sickened of the siege, and during October returned to 

Louisburg.  No sooner had he gone than the French Acadians were filled with fear.  They had 

supposed that all Acadia would have been won for King Louis, and, realising their mistake, they 

{171} hastened to send deputies to Mascarene declaring that they had refused to take any part in 

the expedition.  At the same time they wrote to the defeated French commander to say, "We live 

under a mild and tranquil government, and we have good reason to be faithful to it.  We hope, 

therefore, that you will not separate us from it, and that you will grant us the favour not to plunge 

us into utter misery."  Soon I will have to tell you how these same Acadians, because of their 

continued treachery to the English Government, had to be transported from this land of their birth 

or adoption.  A great deal has been written about the poor Acadians to excite our sympathy for 

them at the fate which shortly awaited them.  You will see that they brought it upon themselves, or 

rather that their leaders and ill-advisers brought it upon them.  Perfectly happy and contented were 

they under English rule, but base priests

with its fierce talons, at a point some paces distant from where the woman stood, and in the 

intervals between her screams Tom heard her cry, in her native tongue:  "My baby! My baby! The 

beast-bird will carry off my baby!"  Then Tom understood. The woman herb-gatherer had brought 

her infant with her on her quest, and had laid it down on a bed of soft grass while she worked. And 

it was this infant, wrapped as Tom afterward saw in a piece of deer-skin, at which the condor was 

aiming.  "Master shoot!" cried Koku, pointing to the down-sweeping bird.  "You bet I'll shoot!" cried 

Tom.  Throwing his electric rifle to his shoulder, Tom pressed the switch trigger. The unseen but 

powerful force shot straight at the condor.  The outstretched wings fell limp, the great body 

seemed to shrivel up, and, with a crash, the bird fell into the underbrush, breaking the twigs and 

branches with its weight.  The electric rifle, a full account of which was given in the volume entitled 

"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle," had done its work well.  With a scream, in which was mingled a 

cry of thanks, the woman threw herself on the sleeping child. The condor had fallen dead not three 

paces from it.  Tom Swift had shot just in time.     Chapter XVIII  The Indian Strike   Snatching up 

in her arms the now awakened child, the woman gazed for a moment into its face, which she 

covered with kisses. Then the herb-gatherer looked over to the dead, limp body of the great 

condor, and from thence to Tom.  In another moment the woman had rushed forward, and knelt at 

the feet of the young inventor. Holding the baby in one arm, in her other hand the woman seized 

Tom's and kissed it fervently, at the same time pouring forth a torrent of impassioned language, of 

which Tom could only make out a word now and then. But he gathered that the woman was 

thanking him for having saved the child.  "Oh, that's all right," Tom said, them tried hard to instil 

into their minds the idea of a grievance and stirred up treachery and disaffection in their hearts. 

Bitterest and most unscrupulous of these agitators was a priest named Le Loutre.  Although an 

able man, he was a terrible coward, and shrank from no crime, no falsehood, to gain his ends.  Of 

Le Loutre and the results of his policy we will speak hereafter.  The English prisoners taken at 

Canso spent many weeks shut up in Louisburg.  They did not wholly idle away their time, but, 

examining all they saw with such care and to such purpose, they were able on {172} regaining 

their freedom to describe with accuracy the plan and condition of this great fortress.  Once a 

French officer had said that Louisburg was so strong that it might be held against any assault by 

an army of women.  Yet these English prisoners thought they saw how Louisburg might be taken, 

and their hopes were eagerly seized upon and shared by the Governor of Massachusetts. 

Governor William Shirley was a lawyer by profession, full of energy and enterprise, and once he 

had set his mind to do a thing, difficulties seemed to fade away.  He now set his mind to the 

capture of Louisburg.  He believed that unless the English had control of the whole coast from 

Cape Sable to the mouth of the St. Lawrence, the safety, nay, the very existence of New England 

was in constant jeopardy.  Shirley listened eagerly to what the returned prisoners had to tell him. 

They had observed the discontent and the bad discipline of the Louisburg garrison, which 

consisted of 1300 men. Their plan of the fort showed him that it was built on a point of land jutting 

out into the Atlantic, while all behind it on the land side was treacherous marsh.  From 30 to 36 

feet high were the walls on the other side of a ditch 80 feet wide.  One hundred and sixty-four guns 

were mounted on the walls, besides many mortars and cohorns.

hand-kissing. "It was an easy shot."  An Indian came bursting through the bushes, evidently the 

woman's husband by the manner in which she greeted him, and Tom recognized the newcomer 

as one of the tunnel workers.  There was some quick conversation between the husband and wife, 

in which the latter made all sorts of motions, including in their scope Tom, his rifle, the dead 

condor and the now smiling baby.  The man took off his hat and approached Tom, genuflecting as 

he might have done in church.  "She say you save baby from condor," the man said in his halting 

English. "She t'ank you--me, I t'ank you. Bird see babe in deer skin--t'ink um dead animal. Maybe 

so bird carry baby off, drop um on sharp stone, baby smile no more. You have our lives, senor! 

We do anyt'ing we can for you."  "Thanks," said Tom, easily. "I'm glad I mounted with thirty-two 

heavy cannon.  The ramparts were, however, seen to be defective in more than one place, and, 

besides this, if the French ships which came over sea with provisions and reinforcements could 

{173} be intercepted, Shirley felt there was a fair chance of success.  He wrote instantly to London 

asking King George to help him with ships, but without waiting for a reply a little fleet was raised 

and a land force of 4000 men hastily got together.  It was not a very imposing army in appearance, 

as you may imagine.  It was chiefly composed of artisans, farmers, fishermen, and labourers, 

commanded by a merchant named William Pepperell. Although without any military experience, 

Pepperell had courage and good judgment, and was anxious to distinguish himself.  On the 24th 

March 1745 the ships left Boston, and 


_
supposed condors only went for things dead, but I reckon, as you say, it mistook the baby in the 

deer skin for a dead animal. And I guess it might have carried your little one off, or at least lifted it 

up, and then it might have dropped it far enough to have killed it. It sure is a big bird," and Tom 

strolled over to look at what he had bagged.  The condor Here they remained three weeks, waiting 

for the ice to melt in the bays and harbours.  It was at Canso that Pepperell and his brave New 

Englanders were joined by the English commodore, Warren, whom King George had sent to help 

him in the capture of Louisburg.  Instantly Pepperell and his army set off, while Warren cruised 

about with a fleet of ten ships to
