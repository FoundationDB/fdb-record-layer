"The native told me that my friend's seaplane, all gassed and ready, lay hi=
dden in a tiny bay=20

among the mango trees. I went there. I could fly, not too well, but enough =
to keep going. I climbed=20

in, started the motor, then flew away from all that terror." She shuddered.=
  "I headed for America.=20

Of course," she laughed, a sort of choking laugh, "I knew I couldn't make i=
t, not all the way, but I=20

did want to be nearer home if I had to die. You know--"  "Yes," Jack whispe=
red. He knew. Every=20

homesick American boy in all this vast Pacific knew.  "I kept going," she c=
ontinued. "I don't know=20

how many hours I flew. Then my gas ran low. The sun was bright. I dropped d=
own low to discover=20

a dark speck on a broad sea. It was a large native canoe. I landed close to=
 them. It was my only=20

chance."  "They took me in and brought me here. There had been missionaries=
 on the island, but=20

they were gone. They liked me, those natives, because I could roast a pig j=
ust right and make fine=20

cakes," she laughed.  "Because the Japs might come at any time, the natives=
 painted me up, dyed=20

my hair, and made me the daughter of the chief. And now," she drew in a lon=
g breath, "here I am."=20

"Yes, and look!" Jack pointed. "There's your lucky star. It's on the side o=
f Ted's plane. It's going to=20

bring luck to you after all."  He had spoken the truth. The star that had s=
hone through the fog was=20

the white star on a blue circle that identifies American planes.  Their boa=
tmen gave a few more=20

lusty strokes, and they were alongside.  And there, sitting on the fuselage=
 grinning at them, was=20

Ted.  "I start out to rescue you." He laughed. "And now look! You come to r=
escue me and my=20

plane!"  "Is your plane badly damaged?" Jack asked anxiously.  "Not so far =
as I can see." Ted slid=20

down into the canoe. "She's got a few slugs in her. Her tail needs a bit of=
 trimming. Three or four=20

hours' work should put her in shape."  "Then why didn't you taxi in?" Jack =
asked.  "Taxi? Move?=20

Make a noise? Say!" Ted laughed hoarsely. "If you'd been attacked by a flyi=
ng freak as I was, you=20

wouldn't even dare to breathe!"  "The jet plane got you," Stew put in. "Tha=
t's what I thought."  "The=20

what plane?" Ted stared.  "The jet plane," Jack grinned. "It's pushed about=
 by a jet of hot kerosene=20

blown up into gas and mixed with air. We know all about it."  "Have you bee=
n flying it?" Ted=20

questioned. "Perhaps that was you flying it today! Well, if it was, I think=
 I got your pal."  "You're not=20

serious?" said Jack.  "Sure, I am. At least about that fellow falling out o=
f the thing," Ted grinned. "I=20

got in a burst of fire back there in a cloud. Then when they came down to s=
hoot me on the water,=20

this Jerry tumbled out. I sort of figured he'd been hit and had gone crazy,=
 or something."  "That's=20

good news!" Stew exclaimed. "There were two Germans and three Japs. Now the=
re's only one=20

German. We should be able to handle them. They--"  "Jap--Jappie!" a grizzle=
d giant among the=20

boatmen broke in excitedly. "You think Jappie on our island?"  "Sure, there=
 are!" Stew insisted.=20

"Three Japs."  "What you think, Mary Brown?" The old man turned to the girl=
. "Jappie on our=20

island? Maybe this boy he lie. What you think?"  "He isn't lying," Mary sai=
d in a steady voice.=20

"Three Japs came on that plane last time."  "Why you not tell me? I go kill=
 them!" There was an=20

angry and puzzled look on the aged native's face.  "That's just it." Mary s=
miled soothingly at the=20

old man. "You would have tried to kill them. They would have killed you. Th=
ey have machine guns.=20

You must not die, for you are my father."  "By-um-by I kill 'em." The old m=
an settled back in his=20

place. "They not kill me. You see."  By this time Ted was looking from one =
speaker to another and=20

then back at Jack.  "What's all this?" he asked in a low tone.  "Well, firs=
t of all," Jack put a hand on=20

Mary's shoulder, "let me introduce Nurse Mary Brown. She's a native of the =
South Sea Islands=20

from Ohio."  "Kentucky," the girl corrected.  That called for a lot of expl=
aining. Jack was only half=20

through when Mary exclaimed:  "Those beasts must have winged you!" She poin=
ted to a splotch of=20



blood on Ted's sleeve.  "Only a flesh wound, really nothing." He tried to t=
oss it off. "I didn't even=20

feel it at the time. I've sort of got it fixed up."  "That may be," said Ma=
ry, moving toward him. "But=20

where I come from wounds don't stay 'sort of fixed up.' That's too dangerou=
s."  Producing a small=20

first-aid kit from beneath her native dress, she went to work.  "I'm going =
to get this war paint off as=20

soon as I can," she confided to Ted as she worked. From the tone of her voi=
ce Jack guessed that=20

Ted had made a hit.  "You look swell just as you are," movement is impossib=
le. The adjustment=20

and fastening of these straps can be performed very rapidly, in practiced h=
ands taking not more=20

than forty seconds.  The electrodes used have varied slightly in different =
cases. In the case of=20

Kemmler they each consisted of a bell-shaped rubber cup about four inches i=
n diameter, with a=20

wooden handle through which passed the wires into the bell to end in a meta=
llic disk about three=20

inches in diameter, faced with sponge. The upper electrode was so arranged =
as to rest firmly on=20

the top of the head, where it was held closely by means of a spiral spring:=
 it was attached to the=20

horizontal arm of the head-rest, a sliding arrangement shaped like a figure=
 4. The lower electrode=20

was in this case attached to the lower part of the back of the chair, and p=
rojected forward at a level=20

with the hollow of the sacrum. There was also connected with it a sliding a=
rrangement, and a spiral=20

spring which in connection with a broad strap around the prisoner=E2=80=99s=
 lower abdomen rendered=20

contact secure.  In the later executions these electrodes have been somewha=
t modified and=20

differently applied. The head-electrode is now so formed as to cover the fo=
rehead and temples,=20

and can be easily fastened in this position without a spring. The lower ele=
ctrodes have been=20

applied to the leg in each case, sometimes apparently to the calf and somet=
imes more to the outer=20

side, where they are securely strapped. They are made of such a shape as to=
 cover a=20

considerable portion of the surface in this region. It is not a matter of i=
mportance to which leg the=20

indifferent electrode is attached, but they have actually been applied in m=
ost cases to the right leg,=20

though in some they were attached to the left. They are thoroughly moistene=
d, usually with a=20

solution of salt and water, and a drip may be arranged so as to keep them w=
et during the passage=20

of the current or other means employed to this effect.  The electromotive p=
ressure, as shown by=20

readings of the voltmeter by Professor Laudy, in the cases of Slocum, Smile=
r, Hood, Jugigo, and=20

Loppy, varied from 1,458 to 1,716 volts. The ammeter showed a variation of =
from two to seven=20

amperes.  The alternating current in the case of McElvaine made roughly 150=
 periods per second.=20

, 50.     In the case of McElvaine, the first=20

contact of fifty seconds was made through the hands, the second contact of =
thirty-six seconds=20

from the head to the leg. The hands were immersed in cells containing tepid=
 salt water, connected=20

respectively with the opposite poles of the dynamo. Kennelly states that in=
 this case, with the=20

hands immersed and the electromotive force at 1,600 volts, the current bega=
n at 2.0 amperes, and=20

in fifty seconds had increased to 3.1 amperes, indicating a resistance betw=
een the electrodes of=20

from 800 ohms at the beginning to 516 ohms at the end. In the second applic=
ation from the=20

forehead to the leg with an electromotive force of 1,500 volts, the current=
 amounted to 7.0=20



amperes during the thirty-six seconds contact, indicating a resistance prac=
tically steady at 214=20

ohms.  Alternating currents of from 1,600 to 1,700 volts and upward may be =
considered fatal=20

currents, and as capable of producing death when contact is perfect. Dr. Ma=
cDonald goes so far=20

as to say: No human being could survive the passage through his body of an =
alternating current of=20

more than 1,500 volts for a period of even twenty seconds, contact being pe=
rfect.=E2=80=9D  The physical=20

_
seeing you all whitened up and dressed in a nurse's uniform."  "You'll see =
me that way all right,"=20

was her reply. "I've got my uniform safely hidden away beneath a palm."  "H=
uh!" Jack thought.=20

"One more perfectly good mystery all shot to pieces!"  For all this, he rea=
lized that life at the battle=20

front had not lost its interest. Mystery and adventure still lay before him=
.  Many questions remained=20

to be answered. How had it happened that two men who seemed to be British l=
eft the island in the=20

jet plane, and five--two Germans and three Japs--came back? Were those firs=
t two men Germans=20

posing as Britishers? Could they be renegade Britishers, traitors to their =
country? Or were they=20

loyal to their country, and had the jet plane been stolen from them?  One m=
ore thing Jack wanted=20

to know. Who had manufactured that plane? In the scrapbook there had been a=
rticles in four=20

languages, so it could easily have come from any of these lands. Of one thi=
ng he was certain.=20

Give him a chance at it and he would fly that plane, first thing. And did h=
e want to try it? Oh man!=20

Did he!  "Suppose it's a German plane of a design unknown to the Allies, wh=
at a scoop it would be=20

if I could drop it down on the deck of the old _Black Bee_," he thought. "E=
ven if it were an=20

American-built plane, I would be performing a great service if I snatched i=
t from the enemy before=20

they had used it as a model." Yes, he must have that plane!  But first, he =
thought with a start,=20

we've got to get Ted and his plane ashore before this mist clears and that =
jet plane fellow is out=20

after us.  "How about getting this plane over to the island?" he demanded. =
 "All right. We got=20

canoes. We pull 'em. No fly 'em," said the Chief. "You fly 'em pretty soon.=
"  "He got the idea," Ted=20

agreed. "Let's go."  Lines were attached to the plane; then with a low chan=
t the natives were into a=20

condition of violent contraction which continues so long as the current las=
ts, and on cessation of=20

the current is replaced by a condition of extreme muscular relaxation. All =
_consciousness_ is=20

apparently lost immediately on the application of the current. This probabl=
y has never returned in=20

any case, but on the removal of the body from the circuit of the current th=
e relaxation of the=20

muscles causes movement, and sometimes, as in the case of Kemmler, slight s=
pasmodic=20

movements of the chest have occurred. The pupils in this case were dilated.=
 The condition of=20

contraction and rigidity is renewed at each new application of the current,=
 to cease immediately=20

when the current is removed.  In Kemmler chest movements and possibly heart=
-beat occurred=20

after the first contact, the former perhaps half a minute after the cessati=
on of the current.  In=20

Slocum there were chest movements and radial pulsation after the first cont=
act. In Smiler no=20

movement of the chest, but radial pulsation after the third contact. In Jug=
igo a slight fluttering of=20

the radial pulse when final contact was broken, which rapidly ceased. In Ho=
od no movement or=20

pulse-beat.  In some of the patients superficial burns have been caused by =
imperfect contact of=20

the electrodes, either on the head or at the position of the lower electrod=
e. In Kemmler=E2=80=99s case the=20

cerebral cortex was somewhat affected under the head-electrode.  The practi=
cal effect of the=20

application of the current to the criminal fastened in the death-chair, as =
seen by the bystander, is=20

that immediately on its reaching him the whole body is straightened and ren=
dered rigid in=20

extension, the extremities tend to straighten out, and the face may grow re=
d and turgid. There is=20
