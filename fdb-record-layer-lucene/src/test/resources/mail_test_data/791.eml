pieces of dry wood that had been left on the bank by the retiring river. I made two splints, one with 

a crutch to fit beneath the arm; this I carried to about three inches beyond the foot, and cut a V-

shaped notch to secure the bandage; the other was a common short splint about eighteen inches 

long. My wife quickly made about sixty yards of bandages, while Barrak, the maid, prepared thick 

gum water, from gum arabic, that the mimosas produced in unlimited quantity. and was being 

taken to a fair to be sold. My step-brothers and nephews appeared on the scene, and began to bid 

for me, and I stood trembling there, wondering which of them I was to belong to. My brother 

Boldizsar pulled open my mouth, examined my teeth, and then said, 'He is not worth anything, we 

could only get five florins for his skin.' As he was speaking, up came a man with a scythe. He 

poked me in the ribs (it hurts me still), and exclaimed, 'The horse is mine,

arm, and keeping it upon the outside of the thigh, with the leg perfectly straight, I lashed the foot 

and ankle securely to the V-shaped notch: I then strapped the upper portion of the splint with 

bandages passed around the patient's chest, until he was swathed from beneath the arms to the 

hips, thus securing the splint to his body. The thigh, and entire leg from the fork to the ankle, I 

carefully secured to the long splint with three rows of bandages, the first plain, and the last two 

layers were soaked in thick gum-water. When these became dry and hard, they formed a case like 

an armour of paste-board: previous to bandaging the limb in splints, I had bathed it for some hours 

with cold applications.  On the following morning I expected to find my patient in great pain; but, on 

the contrary, he complained very little. His pulse was good, and there was very little swelling or 

heat. I gave him some cooling medicine; and the only anxiety that he expressed was the wish to 

get well immediately, so as to continue the expedition.  The Arabs thought that I could mend the 

leg of a man as though it were the broken stock of a gun, that would be serviceable immediately 

when looked at him, and was horrified to see it was Death himself. 'But I will not give the halter 

with the horse,' said my owner. 'It does not matter,' answered the man with the scythe, 'I can get 

one from the shop round the corner; wait a minute, I'll be back directly.' And then I awoke. Oh, it 

was dreadful!"  His red hair stood on end, and beads of perspiration rolled down his face, which 

Anna wiped with a handkerchief.  "Nonsense," she said, "you must not believe in dreams; they do 

not come from Heaven, but from indigestion."  "No, no," said the sick man, "I'm going, I feel it. My 

time will be up when they bring the halter. Don't waste words trying to console me, but bring me 

pen and paper, I want to send a telegram to the boy; he must come home at once. I'll wait for his 

arrival, yes, I'll wait till then."  They brought a table to his bed, and he wrote the following words: 

"Come at once, uncle is dying and wants to give you something.--Mother."  "Send the servant with 

this at once."  He was very restless while the man was away, and asked three times if he had 

returned. At length he came back, but with bad news; the telegraph office was closed for the night.

liquors, they are very little subject to inflammation, and they recover quickly from wounds that 

would be serious to Europeans. I attended to Jali for four days. He was a very grateful, but unruly 

patient, as he had never been accustomed to remain quiet. At the end of that time we arranged an 

angarep comfortably upon a camel, upon which he was transported to Geera, in company with a 

long string of camels, heavily laden with dried meat and squares of hide for shields, with large 

bundles of hippopotamus skin for whip making, together with the various spoils of The master is 

not really so bad, it is half imagination; but he is so nervous we must not excite him, so go in and 

tell him the telegram is sent."  He was quieter after that, and began to reckon at what time the boy 

would arrive, and decided he might be there by the afternoon of the second day.  He slept quietly 

all night, and got up the next morning very pale and weak, but went about putting things straight 

and turning out drawers.  "It is unnecessary to send the telegram," thought Anna to herself. "He 

seems nearly himself again, and will be all right in a day
