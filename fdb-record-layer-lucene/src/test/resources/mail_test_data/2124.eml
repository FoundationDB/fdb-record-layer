philodendron monstera seventeen, (their hands still firmly clasped together=

gale had not entirely=20

passed away, though its violence had temporarily abated. I advanced with de=
ep interest by the=20

peaked group of rocks, and passed the wreck of a brig lying high and dry on=
 the sand just before=20

me. The whole of the shore between the Heads, was strewed with her contents=
. I never witnessed=20

so total a wreck in so short a space of time. The violence of the surf had =
completely beaten her=20

sides out, leaving stem and stern hanging together as by a thread, while he=
r ribs and broken=20

fect it. I could moralize=20

any day on a single bit of plank on a shore--each fragment seems to tell it=

train of thoughts and feelings in the mind; but "grim desolation" was here =
visibly before me.=20

Though I was early astir, I found that the prospect of booty had been suffi=
ciently powerful already=20

to draw out not only the inhabitants of Torwich, but great numbers of the n=
eighbouring peasantry.=20

But where was the ship, about whose fate we had been so greatly country of =
the world, and even=20

the doting priest you talk of boasts of two hundred millions of subjects.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf he were at Avignon=20

again, I should not care for his boasts,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CI=
 do not grudge him his spiritual subjects; I=20

am content to leave his superstition to Time. Time is no longer slow; his s=
cythe mows quickly in=20

this age. But when his debasing creeds are palmed off on man by the authori=
ty of our glorious=20

capitol, and the slavery of the human mind is schemed and carried on in the=
 forum, then, if there=20

be real Roman blood left=E2=80=94and I thank my Creator there is much=E2=80=
=94it is time for it to mount and=20

move,=E2=80=9D and she rose and walked up and down the room.  =E2=80=9CYou =
have had news from Rome?=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI have had news from Rome,=E2=80=9D she replied, speakin=
g slowly in a deep voice; and there=20

was a pause.  Then Lothair said: =E2=80=9CWhen you have alluded to these ma=
tters before, you never=20

spoke of them in a sanguine spirit.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have seen the caus=

cause of truth, of justice, of national honor. I have sat at the feet of th=

Republic; men who, for virtue, and=20


_
evening? This was manifestly not her; but I distinctly saw a large, black h=
ull lying under the=20

western cliffs, half a mile distant, towards which the people were rapidly =
moving. She had come=20

ashore a little after high water, during the night. I picked my way through=
 the wreck strewn around-

-to a small group of persons standing near me; five of them were strangers,=
 the crew of the brig. I=20

learnt that my surmises were right concerning the ship in the distance, and=
 that the brig which was=20

laden with crockery came ashore about the same period.  I left these poor f=
ellows endeavouring to=20

rescue their little articles of property, and took a route apart from the c=
ourse of the crowd towards=20

the other ship. I had not gone far, when I almost stumbled over the dead bo=
dy of a young female,=20

lying with her face uppermost, half buried in the sand--    Her very tresse=
s clung   All tangled by=20

the storm.  The bodies of a gentleman of foreign aspect, and that of a warl=
ike skill and valor, and=20

every quality that exalts man, were never surpassed in the olden time=E2=80=
=94no, not by the Catos and=20

the Scipios; and I have seen the blood of my own race poured, like a rich v=
intage, on the victorious=20

Roman soil; my father fell, who, in stature and in mien, was a god; and, si=
nce then, my beautiful=20

brothers, with shapes to enshrine in temples; and I have smiled amid the sl=
aughter of my race, for=20

I believed that Rome was free; and yet all this vanished. How, then, when w=
e talked, could I be=20

sanguine?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd yet you are sanguine now?=E2=80=9D said Lo=
thair, with a scrutinizing glance; and he rose=20

and joined her, leaning slightly on the mantel-piece.  =E2=80=9CThere was o=
nly one event that could secure=20

the success of our efforts,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cand that event=
 was so improbable, that I had long=20

rejected it from calculation. It has happened, and Rome calls upon me to ac=
