world amounts to no less than 224,000, according to one Mohammadan traditio=
n, or to 124,000=20

according to another; among whom 313 were apostles, sent with special commi=
ssions to reclaim=20

mankind from infidelity and superstition; and six of them brought new laws =
or dispensations, which=20

successively abrogated the preceding: these were Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses=
, Jesus, and=20

Mohammad. All the prophets in general the Mohammadans believe to have been =
free from great=20

sins and errors of consequence, and professors of one and the same religion=
, that is, El-Islam,=20

notwithstanding the different laws and institutions which they observed. In=
 this great number of=20

prophets, they not only reckon divers patriarchs and persons named in Scrip=
ture but not recorded=20

to have been prophets (wherein the Jewish and Christian writers have someti=
mes led the way), as=20

Adam, Seth, Lot, Ishmael, Nun, Joshua, &c., and introduce some of them unde=
r different names,=20

as Enoch, Heber, and Jethro, who are called in the Kur-an, Idrees, Hood, an=
d Sho'eyb; but several=20

others whose very names do not appear in Scripture (though they endeavour t=
o find some persons=20

there to fix them on), as Salih, El-Khidr, Dhu-l-Kifl.  As to the Scripture=
s, the Mohammadans are=20

taught by the Kur-an that God, in divers ages of the world, gave revelation=
s of His will in writing to=20

several prophets, the whole and every word of which it is absolutely necess=
ary for a good Muslim=20

to believe. The number of these sacred books was, according to them, 104; o=
f which ten were=20

given to Adam, fifty to Seth, thirty to Idrees or Enoch, ten to Abraham; an=
d the other four, being=20

the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospel, and the Kur-an, were successively d=
elivered to Moses,=20

David, Jesus, and Mohammad; which last being the _seal_ of the prophets, th=
ose revelations are=20

now closed and no more are to be expected. All these divine books, except t=
he four last, they=20

agree to be now entirely lost and their contents unknown; though the Sabian=
s have several books=20

which they attribute to some of the antediluvian prophets. And of those fou=
r, the Pentateuch,=20

Psalms, and Gospel, they say, have undergone so many alterations and corrup=
tions, that though=20

there may possibly be some part of the true word of God therein, yet no cre=
dit is to be given to the=20

present copies in the hands of the Jews and Christians.--S.  [191] 'El-Jann=
' is here used as a=20

name of Iblees, the father of the jinn. It also signifies the jinn themselv=
es.  [192] According to a=20

tradition of the Prophet, the height of Adam was equal to that of a tall pa=
lm-tree.  [193] The=20

Mohammadans say, that when they were cast down from Paradise [which is in t=
he seventh=20

heaven], Adam fell on the isle of Ceylon, or Sarandeeb, and Eve near Juddah=
 (the port of Mekkeh)=20

in Arabia; and that, after a separation of two hundred years, Adam was, on =
his repentance,=20

conducted by the angel Gabriel to a mountain near Mekkeh, where he found an=
d knew his wife,=20

the mountain being thence named 'Arafat; and that he afterwards retired wit=
h her to Ceylon.--S.=20

[194] The prayer is inserted by the commentary from Kur. vii. 22.  [195] Th=
is word has various=20

significations in the Kur-an; sometimes, as in this passage, it signifies _=
divine revelation_, or=20

_scripture_ in general; sometimes the _verses_ of the _Kur-an_ in particula=
r; and at other times,=20

_visible miracles_. But the sense is easily distinguished by the context.--=
S.  [196] Called in Arabic=20

Habeel and Kabeel.  [197] The occasion of their making this offering is thu=
s related, according to=20

the common tradition in the East. Each of them being born with a twin-siste=
r, when they were=20

grown up, Adam by God's direction ordered Cain to marry Abel's twin-sister,=
 and Abel to marry=20

Cain's; (for it being the common opinion that marriages ought not to be had=
 in the nearest degrees=20

of consanguinity, since they must necessarily marry their sisters, it seeme=
d reasonable to suppose=20



they ought to take those of the remoter degree;) but this Cain refusing to =
agree to, because his=20

own sister was the handsomest, Adam ordered them to make their offerings to=
 God, thereby=20

referring the dispute to His determination. The commentators say Cain's off=
ering was a sheaf of=20

the very worst of his corn; but Abel's a fat lamb of the best of his flock.=
--S.  [198] Or, as the original=20

literally signifies, boiled over [or boiled], which is consonant to what th=
e Rabbins say, that the=20

waters of the deluge were boiling hot.--This oven was, as some say, at El-K=
oofeh, in a spot=20

whereon a mosque now stands; or, as others rather think, in a certain place=
 in India, or else at=20

'Eyn-el-Wardeh in Mesopotamia. Some pretend that it was the same oven which=
 Eve made use of=20

to bake her bread in, being of a form different from those we use, having t=
he mouth in the upper=20

part, and that it descended from patriarch to patriarch till it came to Noa=
h. It is remarkable that=20

Mohammad, in all probability, borrowed this circumstance from the Persian M=
agi, who also fancied=20

that the first waters of the deluge gushed out of the oven of a certain old=
 woman named Zala=20

Cufa.--But the word "tennoor," which is here translated "oven," also signif=
ying "the superficies of=20

the earth," or "a place whence waters spring forth," or "where they are col=
lected," some suppose it=20

means no more in this passage than the spot or fissure whence the first eru=
ption of waters broke=20

forth.--S.  [199] It is a custom of many Muslims to pronounce these words, =
'In the name of God be=20

its course and its mooring,' on embarking for any Chaplain, "who lived prob=
ably about the end of=20

the twelfth century"), and two very obscure allusions to courts and trials =
in the poems of the=20

troubadours. The chief sources for our knowledge of the Courts of Love are =
writers long=20

subsequent to the events, notably Jean de Nostredame, who, in 1575, publish=
ed a book entitled=20

_Les Vies des plus celebres et anciens poetes provensaux_. But the traditio=
n is so well=20

established, and above all so intimately associated with Queen Eleanor, tha=
t we shall give a little=20

sketch of the courts and their doings.  The _tensons_ of the troubadours we=
re poetic disputes on=20

points of love and on lovers' conduct. If, says Jean de Nostredame, the dis=
putants "could not=20

come to an agreement they referred the matter for decision to the illustrio=
us lady presidents who=20

held open and plenary court at the Castle of Signe, and other places, and t=
hese gave judgments=20

which were called the judgments of Love." If a lady treated her troubadour =
lover unfairly, or if a=20

lover were guilty of any dereliction or crime in love, or if, for the guida=
nce of future generations of=20

lovers, a decision on a mere point of gallantry were sought, all such cases=
 came before the Courts=20

of Love, which had a regular code of laws, thirty-one in number, upon which=
 decisions were=20

based. The court, composed of a jury of the most beautiful, accomplished, a=
nd celebrated ladies=20

of the neighborhood, and presided over by some lady of special distinction,=
 heard the pleas on=20

both sides, and gave judgment, which depended upon a unanimous vote of the =
jury. There were=20

several of these courts, the most famous being those of Queen Eleanor of En=
gland, of her=20

daughter, Marie de Champagne, of the Viscountess of Narbonne, and of the Co=
untess of=20

Flanders. The code under which these fantastic tribunals are said to have g=
iven their judgment is a=20

very curious document. The statutes of love are hardly so rigorous as might=
 be expected; some of=20

them are merely proverbial bits of wisdom, with here and there a hint very =
far from romantic:  IV.=20

Love never stands still; it always increases--or diminishes.  X. Love is al=
ways an exile where=20

avarice holds his dwelling.  Some seem so distinctly suggestive of a smirk =
beneath all this affected=20

seriousness that one can hardly take them seriously.  XV. Every lover is ac=
customed to grow pale=20

at the sight of his lady-love.  XVI. At the sudden and unexpected sight of =
his lady-love the heart of=20



the true lover invariably palpitates.  XX. A real lover is always the prey =
of anxiety and malaise.=20

XXIII. A person who is the prey of love eats little and sleeps little.  Thi=
s last is, of course, a rule not=20

only venerable, but universal. One recalls Chaucer's Squire, "as fresshe as=
 is the moneth of May,"=20

who "coude songes make, and wel endite;... so hote he loved that by nighter=
tale he slep no more=20

than doth the nightingale." Others of the troubadour statutes are frankly s=
uggestive of that moral=20

laxity, not to say obliquity of vision, of which we have spoken before.  I.=
 Marriage cannot be=20

pleaded as an excuse for refusing to love.  XI. It is not becoming to love =
those ladies who love only=20

with a view to marriage.  XXVI. Love can deny nothing to love.  With this l=
ittle group of laws in=20

mind one can but reflect that, pushed to their logical conclusion, they are=
 suggestive of moral=20

laxity. We are not, however, left to guessing. According to Andrew the Chap=
lain, the court of the=20

Countess of Champagne was asked, on April 29, 1174, to decide this question=
: "Can real love=20

exist between married people?" The countess and her court decided "that lov=
e cannot exercise its=20

powers on married people," the following reason being given in proof of the=
 assertion: "Lovers=20

grant everything, mutually and gratuitously, without being constrained by a=
ny motive of necessity.=20

Married people, on the contrary, are compelled as a duty to submit to one a=
nother's wishes, and=20

not to refuse anything to one another. For this reason it is evident that l=
ove cannot exercise its=20

powers on married people. Let this decision, which we have arrived at with =
great deliberation, and=20

after taking counsel of a large number of ladies, be held henceforward as a=
 confirmed and=20

irrefragable truth."  Quite in line with this judgment is one reported from=
 the court of Queen=20

Eleanor. A gentleman, the complainant in the suit, was deeply in love with =
a lady who loved=20

another. Taking compassion on him, however, she promised that, if ever she =
should lose her first=20

lover, the complainant should be received as his successor. The lady shortl=
y after married her=20

lover. Thereupon the complainant, citing the decision of the Countess of Ch=
ampagne, demanded=20

her love. The lady refused, denying that she had lost the love of her lover=
 by marrying him.=20

Wherefore the complainant humbly sued for judgment, we presume it might be =
called a writ=20

_mandamus amare_. The honorable court handed down a decision for the compla=
inant, declaring=20

that the solemn decree of the court of the Countess of Champagne was of for=
ce in the present=20

case, and issuing the writ _mandamus amare_ as prayed for: "We order that t=
he lady grant to her=20

imploring lover, now the complainant before this court, the favors which he=
 so earnestly entreats,=20

and which she so faithfully has promised."  One other decision of the gay Q=
ueen Eleanor is so=20

righteous that we cannot forbear repeating it. A gentleman brought suit bec=
ause a lady of whom=20

he was enamored had accepted numerous handsome gifts from him and yet persi=
stently denied=20

him her love. We are not altogether sure whether the gentleman was not real=
ly bringing suit to=20

recover his presents; but Queen Eleanor gave judgment: "A lady who is deter=
mined to be inflexible=20

must either refuse to receive any gifts which are sent with the object of w=
inning her love, or she=20

must make compensation for them, or she must be content to be classed as a =
courtesan."  In all=20

this world of love and song were the women merely objects of the troubadour=
's song, or merely=20

patronesses of the troubadour? Were there no poetesses? The names of fourte=
en ladies who may=20

be called troubadours by reason of their own works are all of whom we have =
record, and even of=20

these fourteen not one was really a professional troubadour; in most cases =
it is but one song, or=20

even one part of a _tenson_, which gives the lady a right to be named among=
 the poets. We find=20

Clara D'Anduse, the beautiful love of the troubadour Uc de St. Cyr, remembe=
red for but one song;=20



and but little more remains of the work of Countess Beatrice de Die, who lo=
ved Rambaut=20

d'Orange, and who tells of how this troubadour loved her, and grew cold to =
her, and finally was=20

faithless, forsaking her for another; but she and her sister troubadours ar=
e shadowy figures: the=20

time had not come for woman to take a permanent place in literature.  In ou=
r attempt to present=20

the literary and artistic side of Eleanor's life, and to tell something of =
the brilliant society of=20

Provence in which she played no small part, we have neglected the facts of =
her career in England.=20

As Queen Eleanor of England, however, we shall not have much to say of her.=
 Even now she=20

does not play a very prominent part in history, and the development of her =
character is quite in line=20

with the moral training one would acquire in the Courts of Love. It does se=
em as if there were such=20

a thing as reaping the whirlwind.  Eleanor was eleven years older than her =
new husband. She had=20

despised Louis because he was too austere, too cold, too plain in mind and =
in morals. Her new=20

husband soon gave her ample cause to develop a new passion jealousy. She le=
arned to hate him=20

for vices the very opposite of Louis's colorless virtue. She herself had be=
en notoriously a coquette,=20

and not an innocent one. She felt the eleven years of difference between he=
rself and Henry. The=20

gossips said she could hardly expect to retain Henry's affection, she who w=
as so much older, and=20

who had been, it was rumored, the mistress of Henry's own father. Despite t=
he gallant principles=20

she had professed in her own Court of Love, despite the latitude to which s=
he had thought herself=20

entitled, she became furiously jealous of Henry. There was, indeed, much re=
ason for jealousy.=20

Young, hot-blooded, passionate, as greedy of pleasure as of power, Henry lo=
st no time in giving=20

her numerous rivals. No means were too vile or too violent when Henry wishe=
d to gratify his=20

passions. It is said that he even dishonored the young Princess Alice of Fr=
ance, betrothed to his=20

son Richard, and for that reason would never allow Richard to marry her. Th=
ere we're fierce=20

quarrels between Eleanor and Henry, and tradition has ascribed to her the m=
urder of Fair=20

Rosamond Clifford, whom she is said to have pursued into the labyrinth of W=
oodstock and=20

stabbed with her own hand.  Finding it impossible to avenge herself in any =
other way, Eleanor=20

stirred up her sons against their father. They were all turbulent enough, a=
nd needed little=20

encouragement. The eldest living son, Henry, injudiciously crowned king by =
his father's desire,=20

persuaded himself that he must be king in deed, and was spurred on by his m=
other and by her=20

friend, the restless troubadour Bertrand de Born. Raymond of Toulouse, who =
had been sought by=20

them as an ally, revealed the plot of the queen and her sons to Henry. Youn=
g Henry and his=20

brothers fled to France, where they were received by Louis with royal honor=
s. Eleanor was=20

imprisoned in her own duchy, and in prison she remained during Henry's life=
time. The=20

troubadours, devoted to their duchess, sang dolorous songs upon her captivi=
ty, and voiced their=20

hatred of her jailer, Henry, in burning _sirventes_. But Henry went on rele=
ntlessly in the=20

intermittent struggle with his sons,=20


_

d into three stories, of=20

which the lower was designed for the beasts, the middle one for the men and=
 women, and the=20

upper for the birds; and the men were separated from the women by the body =
of Adam, which=20

Noah had taken into the ark. This last is a tradition of the Eastern Christ=
ians.--S.  [200] The=20

original of this passage is considered the most sublime in the Kur-an.  [20=
1] The Mohammadans=20

say that Noah went into the ark on the tenth of Rejeb, and came out of it o=
n the tenth of=20

Moharram; which therefore became a fast: so that the whole time of Noah's b=
eing in the ark=20

according to them was six months.--S. (B.)  [202] 'Ad was an ancient and po=

preserving them from all=20

dangers abroad, the third providing food for their sustenance, and the four=

Generally supposed to be the same person as Heber.--S.  [204] Thamood was a=
nother tribe of the=20

ancient Arabs who fell into idolatry. They dwelt first in the country of th=
e 'Adites, but their numbers=20

increasing, they removed to the territory of Hejr.--S.  [205] This extraord=
inary camel frighting the=20

other cattle from their pasture, a certain rich woman, named 'Oneyzeh Umm-G=
hanim, having four=20

daughters, dressed them out, and offered one Kudar his choice of them, if h=
e would kill the camel.=20

Whereupon he chose one, and with the assistance of eight other men hamstrun=
g and killed the=20

dam, and pursuing the young one which fled to the mountain, killed that als=
o, and divided his flesh=20

among them. Others tell the story somewhat differently, adding Sadakah Bint=
-El-Mukhtar as a=20

joint-conspiratress with 'Oneyzeh, and pretending that the young one was no=
t killed.'--S. (A.F., B.)=20

[206] Defying the vengeance with which they were threatened; because they t=
rusted in their strong=20

dwellings hewn in the rocks, saying that the tribe of 'Ad perished only bec=
ause their houses=20

rebellious subjects in check. Not till he died, cursing Richard and John, w=
ho had again been in=20

revolt against him, was the queen released.  Hardly had Richard been crowne=
d before he=20

departed for the Crusade, leaving Eleanor as regent. Even against her own s=
on the old queen=20

intrigued; yet it was partly her indignant intervention which later helped =
to release Richard from the=20

German prison where the emperor, instigated by Philip Augustus, would have =
kept him. The son=20

whom she loved best, John, loved and trusted her no more than did Richard. =
In the struggle=20

between Philip Augustus, championing Arthur of Brittany, and John, Eleanor =
seems to have kept=20

faith with her son, and to have given him shrewd if cruel counsel. We hear =
of her but once or twice=20

more in active affairs. In 1200 she was sent by John into Spain to bring ba=
ck his niece, Blanche de=20

Castille, who was betrothed to Prince Louis of France by one of the terms o=
f a treaty just=20

concluded between John and Philip Augustus. On her return, when passing thr=
ough Bordeaux, a=20

mob set upon and killed one of her party, the detested Mercader, captain of=
 Richard's Brabancon=20

mercenaries. Eleanor, old, and sick with fatigue and fright at this scene o=
f horror, could proceed no=20

further, and stayed in the abbey of Fontevrault, sending Blanche on with th=
e Archbishop of=20

Bordeaux. She rallied from this illness, however, and two years later had a=
 narrow escape from=20

being captured by her grandson, Arthur. She was besieged, and very hard pre=
ssed, in the=20

Chateau de Mirebeau, when Arthur and his followers were surprised and captu=
red by John. This=20

episode of a grand-mother besieged by her own grandson is quite in line wit=
h the traditions of the=20

family. "It is the fate of our family that none should love the other," sai=
d Geoffrey Plantagenet.  In=20



the midst of the triumph of Philip Augustus over her miserable son John, ol=
d Queen Eleanor died,=20

in the convent of Beaulieu, in 1204. The miseries of her declining years ma=
ke us more charitable=20

toward her; but it is impossible to respect a character such as that of Eng=
land's troubadour queen.=20

One sometimes finds her praised for a splendid virtue, that of impulsive ge=
nerosity; but there was=20

no=20


_
with sufficient strength.--S.  [207] Like violent and repeated claps of thu=
nder; which some say was=20

no other than the voice of the angel Gabriel, which rent their hearts. It i=
s said that after they had=20

killed the camel, Salih told them that on the morrow their faces should bec=
ome yellow, the next=20

day red, and the she was merely lavish in spending for her own pleasure. In=
 keeping with what a=20

great historian has said of her son Richard Coeur de Lion, one may say that=
 she was a bad wife,--

to two husbands,--a bad mother, and a bad queen. There was in her nature no=
ne of the=20

tenderness which alone can ensure domestic love, nor=20
