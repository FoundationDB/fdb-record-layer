afterwards.           We've had quite a good hockey season. The Coll.          played "Hawthornden" 

last week, and when the          whistle went for "time" the score was 4-2 in our          favor! An 

immense triumph for us, because we've          never had the luck to beat them before, and we 

were          feeling desperate about it. They were so cock-sure          of winning too! Do you get any 

hockey at Fossato?          Or is it all tennis?           We'd a rather decent gymnastic display a while 

ago.          Mona and Beatrice are very keen on gym practice and          they did some really neat 

balance-walking on the          bars, also side vaulting. The juniors gave country          dances in 

costume, and of course that sort of thing          is always clapped by parents. We're working hard 

now for the concert. Ailsa and I have to sing a          duet and we're both terrified. Hope we shan't 

break          down and spoil the show!           I'm enjoying this year at Brackenfield most 

immensely. It's lovely being a prefect. I was          fearfully scared when first the Empress sent for 

me          and told me I was to be a school officer, but I've          got on swimmingly, thanks largely 

to Ailsa, I          think. Of course we're still inseparable. We always          have been contest 

between animals of so different an organization presents a very striking spectacle. The Indians, 

provided with harpoons and long slender reeds, surround the pool closely; and some climb up the 

trees, the branches of which extend horizontally over the surface of the water. By their wild cries, 

and the length of their reeds, they prevent the horses from running away and reaching the bank of 

the pool. The eels, stunned by the noise, defend themselves by the repeated discharge of their 

electric batteries. For a long interval they seem likely to prove victorious. Several horses sink 

beneath the violence of the invisible strokes which they receive from all sides, in organs the most 

essential to life; and stunned by the force and frequency of the shocks, they disappear under the 

water. Others, panting, with mane erect, and haggard eyes expressing anguish and dismay, raise 

themselves, and endeavour to flee from the storm by which they are overtaken. They are driven 

back by the Indians into the middle of the water; but a small number succeed in eluding the active 

vigilance of the fishermen. These regain the shore, stumbling at every step, and stretch 

themselves on the sand, exhausted with fatigue, and with limbs benumbed by the electric shocks 

of the gymnoti.  In less than five minutes two of our horses were drowned.

when I smuggled the mice into No. 5 to scare Mona          out of the dormitory and leave room for 

Ailsa.           I go nearly every week to The Tamarisks. It cheers          Auntie up to see me. She's 

rather lonely since          Elaine was married. By the by you asked me what had          become of 

Miss Norton's being five feet long, and pressing itself against the belly of the horses, makes a 

discharge along the whole extent of its electric organ. It attacks at once the heart, the intestines, 

and the caeliac fold of the abdominal nerves. It is natural that the effect felt by the horses should 

be more powerful than that produced upon
