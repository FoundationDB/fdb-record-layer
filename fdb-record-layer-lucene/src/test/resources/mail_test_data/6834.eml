dramas which had lost the sense of reverence and even of common propriety. =
They had=20

scandalised serious Protestants; the Catholics declined to defend what was =
indefensible; the=20

humanists and lovers of classical art in Renaissance days thought scorn of =
the rude mediaeval=20

drama. Though it died by violence, its existence could hardly have been pro=
longed for many years.=20

But in the days of its popularity the performance of a mystery set a whole =
city in motion;=20

carpenters, painters, costumiers, machinists were busy in preparation; prie=
sts, scholars, citizens=20

rehearsed their parts; country folk crowded to every hostelry and place of =
lodging. On the day=20

preceding the first morning of performance the personages, duly attired--Ch=
ristians, Jews,=20

Saracens, kings, knights, apostles, priests--defiled through the streets on=
 their way to the=20

cathedral to mass. The vast stage hard by the church presented, with primit=
ive properties, from=20

right to left, the succession of places--lake, mountain, manger, prison, ba=
nquet-chamber--in which=20

the action should be imagined; and from one station to another the actors p=
assed as the play=20

proceeded. At one end of the stage rose heaven, where God sat throned; at t=
he other, hell-mouth=20

gaped, and the demons entered or emerged. Music aided the action; the drama=
 was tragedy,=20

comedy, opera, pantomime in one. The actors were amateurs from every class =
of society--clergy,=20

scholars, tradesmen, mechanics, occasionally members of the _noblesse_. In =
Paris the=20

Confraternity of the Passion had almost an exclusive right to present these=
 sacred plays; in the=20

provinces associations were formed to carry out the costly and elaborate pe=
rformance. To the=20

_Confreres de la Passion_--bourgeois folk and artisans--belonged the first =
theatre, and it was they=20

who first presented plays at regular intervals. From the Hospital of the Tr=
inity, originally a shelter=20

for pilgrims, they migrated in 1539 to the Hotel de Flandres, and thence in=
 1548 to the Hotel de=20

hands of professional actors; but it was not until 1676 that the Confrerie =
ceased to exist.  Comedy,=20

unlike the serious drama, suffered no breach of continuity during its long =
history. The jongleurs of=20

the Middle Ages were the immediate descendants of the Roman mimes and histr=
ions; their=20

declamations, accompanied by gestures, at least tended towards the dramatic=
 form. Classical=20

comedy was never wholly forgotten in the schools; the liturgical drama and =
the sacred pieces=20

developed from it had an indirect influence as encouraging dramatic feeling=
, and providing models=20

which could be applied to other uses. The earliest surviving _jeux_ are of =
Arras, the work of ADAM=20
