which the cleric gave,  "that he very shortly after repented, judging himse=
lf guilty of inadvertence;=20

and as he saw--which will be later perceived--that the captivity of the neg=
roes was quite as unjust=20

as that of the Indians, the remedy he had counselled, that negroes should b=
e brought so that the=20

Indians might be freed, was no better, even though he believed they had bee=
n rightfully procured;=20

although he was not positive that his ignorance in this matter and his good=
 intention would=20

exculpate him before the divine justice."  As has been noted, the transfer =
of his monopoly by the=20

Governor of Bressa to Genoese merchants, instead of increasing the exportat=
ion of negroes to=20

America, resulted in almost stopping the nefarious trade, hence no consider=
able amount of=20

mischief is traceable to the adoption of Las Casas's suggestion, which was =
only one of many=20

enumerated in his scheme. Had the project as he framed it been accepted in =
its entirety and=20

loyally carried out, no increased injustice would have been done to the neg=
roes, for it was the=20

frightful mortality amongst the cruelly driven Indians that rapidly reduced=
 the numbers of labourers=20

and made gaps which could only be filled by the importation of others from =
elsewhere.  Under a=20

more humane system, the Indians might still have laboured, but not in exces=
s of their powers; their=20

lives would not have been sacrificed or rendered unendurable, while the col=
onists would have=20

become rich less rapidly; there would have been no shortage of workmen and =
little need for the=20

importation of Africans at a high price, even though one negro did the work=
 of four Indians,=20

according to the popular estimate.  While many admirable suggestions of Las=
 Casas were=20

rejected, this blamable one concerning the permission to import negroes was=
 accepted, and thus=20

by a singular irony of fate, this good man, whose whole life was a self-sac=
rificing apostolate in=20

favour of freedom, actually came to be aspersed as a promoter of slavery.  =
The controversy on=20

this passage in the life of Las Casas has been touched upon here because it=
 furnished at one time=20

material for much discussion, (34) but the light of historical research has=
 long since dispersed the=20

artificial clouds which misrepresentation caused to gather about the fame o=
f the Protector of the=20

Indians, and there now neither is, nor can be, any doubt concerning the sen=
timents and intentions=20

of one whose noble figure is too clearly defined on the horizon of history =
ever again to be blurred=20

or obscured.  Another part of the plan for colonisation on the moral basis =
of benefiting the Indians=20

as well as the Spaniards, was the foundation of fortified places at interva=
ls along the coast of the=20

territory to be granted.  In each of these settlements, some thirty men sho=
uld be stationed with a=20

provision of various articles, such as the Indians prized, for trading purp=
oses; also several=20

missionary priests, whose occupation would be teaching and converting the I=
ndians.  It was=20

maintained that by kind treatment the Indians could be attracted to the Spa=
niards and thus, little by=20

little, become civilised, profitable, and voluntary subjects of the King.  =
Unfortunately for the=20

prosperous development of these benevolent projects, the mischievous Bishop=
 of Burgos and his=20

brother, who, since the latter part of Cardinal Ximenez's regency, had been=
 excluded from active=20

participation in Indian affairs, began once more to exercise an influence, =
partly, perhaps because=20

long experience had equipped them with a practical knowledge of details whi=
ch the Grand=20

Chancellor found useful, and partly, so Las Casas hints, because they had s=
ucceeded, by=20

spending important sums of money, in recovering their former offices. At fi=
rst the Bishop's=20

opposition was mild enough, and he contented himself with pointing out that=
 he had never been=20

able to induce emigrants to go to the Indies and that Las Casas's scheme wa=
s unworkable.  Las=20

Casas, however, affirmed that he could easily find three thousand workmen a=
s soon as he was=20



authorised to assure them of the King's conditions, and that the Bishop had=
 not succeeded in=20

finding men because he had treated the islands as a penal colony, whereas n=
ow, on the contrary,=20

the severest punishment, after the death penalty, with which a colonist in =
the Indies could be=20

threatened, was that of being shipped back to Spain.  The King had left Val=
ladolid(35) on his way=20

to take formal possession of the kingdom of Aragon and these negotiations w=
ere being carried on=20

at Aranda de Duero, where a halt had been made. Las Casas fell ill and the =
court moved on=20

without him, but it is indicative of the favour he had already acquired wit=
h the King that frequently=20

the monarch exclaimed: "Oh, I wonder how Micer Bartolome is getting on!"  M=
icer was the title the=20

Flemings gave to ecclesiastics, and Charles V., who was the reverse of demo=
nstrative, commonly=20

used this familiar appellation in speaking of Las Casas. Before the court r=
eached Zaragoza, the=20

invalid was on his legs again and had rejoined the others, being received w=
ith great joy by the=20

Grand Chancellor, (36) who was almost as enthusiastic as Las Casas himself =
in pushing forward=20

the Indian reforms. Delay, however, was again caused at Zaragoza, where the=
 King and court=20

were established, by the illness of the ever-contrary Bishop of Burgos; whi=
le waiting there to=20

resume business, a letter was sent to Las Casas from Seville by his friend =
Fray Reginaldo,=20

containing a full account of the ruthless cruelties of one of the captains =
of Pedro Arias, named=20

Espinosa, which cost the lives of forty thousand Indians. This ghastly chro=
nicle, which was=20

supplied by a Franciscan, Fray Francisco Roman, who wrote as an eye-witness=
 of the atrocities,=20

was immediately laid before the Chancellor by Las Casas; the former was muc=
h impressed by the=20

report and directed Las Casas to go to the Bishop on his behalf and read hi=
m the letter.  The=20

Bishop took the news coolly enough and merely observed that he had long sin=
ce advised the=20

recall of Pedro Arias.(37)  With the recovery of the Bishop, everything see=
med ready for the=20

resumption of business, when fate dealt Las Casas one of the hardest blows =
he had had to=20

sustain. The Grand Chancellor, who owned to feeling indisposed on a Friday,=
 became worse on=20

Saturday, so that he had to keep his room; his illness persisted on Sunday =
with signs of fever and,=20

as Las Casas tersely puts it, "they buried him on Wednesday."  With the dea=
th of the Fleming died=20

all hope of any immediate action in behalf of the Indians; in the absence o=
f any other as familiar=20

_
himself once more omnipotent, or as Las Casas puts it, "he seemed to rise t=
o the heavens while=20

the cleric [himself] sank to the depths." The Chancellor's successor, named=
 by the King pro=20

tempore, was the Dean of Bisancio, a heavy, phlegmatic man who slept peacef=
ully all through the=20

sessions of the Council and only had sufficient perception to commend Las C=
asas for the zeal with=20

which he pestered him day and night, remarking on one occasion with a dull =
smile:=20

Commendamus in Domino, domine Bartholomeo, vestram diligentiam.  Two such i=
ll-assorted=20

characters as this bovine dean and the fiery Las Casas only succeeded in to=
rmenting one another=20

to no purpose, though, as the latter observes, in this case "it did not kil=
l the Dean for all that."  The=20

India Council, over which the Bishop of Burgos presided, was composed at th=
at time of Hernando=20

de la Vega, Grand Commander of Castile, Don Garcia de Padilla, the licentia=
te Zapata, Pedro=20

Martyr de Angleria, and Francisco de los Cobos who was then just rising int=

Casas was excluded, and though he was as busy as ever in laying petitions a=

the Council, he had no friends or protectors inside and consequently obtain=

too alien to his=20

sanguine temperament, else he might, with some show of reason, have abandon=
ed all hope of=20
