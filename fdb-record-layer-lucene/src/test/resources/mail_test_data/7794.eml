frauds are daily committed, particularly by the Chinese and Chinese Mestizo=
s, and for these there=20

is no resource; complaint is unavailing, for the trouble of obtaining redre=
ss is greater than the=20

injury, and it is a matter of common conversation--how so and so has been c=
heated in his=20

contracts. They appear to mistake indolence for compassion, and allow thems=
elves to be robbed=20

with impunity, rather than pursue the offender, or, should they do so, the =
magistrate to whom they=20

apply is but too apt, if the affair is intricate, to mistake procrastinatio=
n for deliberation, and thus the=20

culprit escapes unpunished. The losses of private merchants and the individ=
uals in this way,=20

would, if enumerated, exceed belief. Another and a most serious drawback to=
 the commercial=20

prosperity of the Phillippines, has been the negligence or ignorance, or bo=
th which have prevented=20

the establishment of bonded warehouses, or a system of drawback duties on r=
e-exportations. A=20

glance at their position, and the consideration of the monsoons, will convi=
nce any one, that this=20

was of all things that for which ample provision should have been made; and=
 it would be no=20

exaggeration to say, that this commerce would in a few years have increased=
 tenfold with China=20

alone, had this plan been adopted. The enormous duties and vexatious spirit=
 of the Chinese=20

government, together with, what must doubtless be often the case, the fleec=
ing combinations of=20

the Hong merchants; [118] would long ago have driven every vessel from thei=
r ports, could=20

another have been found near enough to insure a supply of goods, which, fro=
m the enterprising=20

spirit of the Chinese, could not have failed. Manila is this port. From Amo=
y and Nankin, the=20

granaries and workshops of the eastern provinces, the most fertile and comm=
ercial part of the=20

empire, it is but a short run to Manila; and thus, when the Chinese could f=
reely trade in their=20

favourite article, opium, [119] and find too an assortment of European and =
Malay goods, while the=20

European could complete his investment of funds with the valuable produce o=
f China, [120]=20

without the expense of the measurement duties, and while the Malay could tr=
ade with both, an=20

emporium might have risen, inferior only perhaps to Batavia or Calcutta.  A=
n attempt was made in=20

1817, by a Spanish merchant, to commence something of this sort. He purchas=
ed a quantity of=20

Turkey opium from an American, with an understanding that it was to be resh=
ipped, on payment of=20

a small additional duty. It was so, but a quantity of the opium was plunder=
ed from the custom-

house godowns, and the proprietor was told "that the king was not responsib=
le for losses."  It=20

would be foreign to the object of a cursory sketch like the present to ente=
r farther into the details of=20

this subject. Enough has been said to bear out an assertion, which those wh=
o are acquainted with=20

the trade will not think exaggerated, that had this system been fairly and =
equitably established,=20

one half of the trade to China would before this have centered at Manila; a=
nd it is only at Manila=20

that the advantages of such a transit could have been unknown or neglected =
in the 19th century. I=20

proceed to make some observations on the capital and its inhabitants. [121]=
      PART II  MANILA=20

Manila, [122] the capital of the "kingdom of the Phillippines," [123] in la=
t. 14 26' N. and long. 121 3'=20

East of Greenwich, is situated on the eastern side of an extensive bay in t=
he western coast of the=20

island Luzon, or Luconia, as it is sometimes called. It is a captain genera=
l-ship (not a viceroyalty),=20

and archbishopric, and the seat of the Audiencia, or Supreme Tribunal.  The=
 city forms nearly a=20

sector of a circle, of which the center is a point formed by the coast and =
the influence of a small=20

but rapid river, the Passig, which flowing to the westward, and passing to =
the north of the city,=20

discharges the waters of an extensive lake about 30 miles distant from the =
town. This river is=20

navigable for vessels of 250 tons for a small distance from its entrance, w=
hich is formed by two=20



fine moles, built by the municipality of the city. On the southern of these=
 is a small semicircular=20

battery for four guns, and on the other a light-house. The southern or oute=
r mole is much out of=20

repair.  The constant and rapid current of the river forms a bar at its ent=
rance, over which there is=20

10, and at times 11 feet water at spring tides, in a narrow channel close t=
o the battery.  The city is=20

well fortified on the sea and land faces, but on that towards the river ver=
y indifferently, being only=20

defended by a long curtain leaping red streams of lava dashed forth for the=
 plains below. The=20

mountain hurled after them showers of stones. Volumes of black dust flew af=
ter, making thick,=20

stifling darkness which could be felt. Banks of ashes lay upon the roofs of=
 houses, or muffled the=20

city streets. A tornado hurried by, bearing stones, dust, roofs, trees, hou=
ses, and men.  In Java the=20

fierce Papandayang burst open. From the seven great fissures the lava in it=
s basin plunged out=20

and reached for miles from the mountain=E2=80=99s base. On the site of the =
island of Merak, which was=20

swallowed up by the sea, the next day fourteen volcanic mountains sprang up=
, forming a chain=20

from St. Nicholas Point, Java, to Hoga Point, in Sumatra.  In Batavia and A=
njer were three=20

thousand five hundred European residents; eight hundred of these never saw =
the light again. An=20

overwhelming avalanche of rock, mud, and lava, poured upon their quarter in=
 Anjer; then the sea=20

leaped upon those struggling in the ruins and swept away all. Not so much a=
s a trace of them was=20

left. Two thousand inhabitants perished, besides a large number of fugitive=
s from other quarters.=20

Bantam was submerged, and one thousand five hundred people drowned. Waves d=
ashed=20

completely over the island of Serang, and not a single inhabitant escaped. =
The storms of rock and=20

lava numbered their victims at Cheribon, and at several noted pleasure reso=
rts.  The great temple=20

of Boro-Buddor was ruined, its dome being beaten in by the showers of rock.=
 This is a most=20

deplorable architectural loss. It was the largest Buddhist Temple in the ea=
st, and had no equal in=20

the world. Erected eleven hundred years ago, it stood on an eminence in a c=
ircular valley. It had a=20

great central dome one hundred and forty-five feet high, surrounded by seve=
nty smaller domes.=20

On the platforms beneath were four hundred and fifty chapels, cut in openwo=
rk out of granite, and=20

each having a statue of Buddha. The walls of the temple contained a complet=
e picture-history of=20

Buddha, there being four thousand beautifully chased bas-reliefs. Not a sto=
ne was left uncarved.=20

The great chapel under the central dome was reached by a series of four gra=
nd staircases of five=20

hundred feet each. No other structure is comparable to it. A few may be eve=
n more splendid; but it=20

was decidedly _sui generis_.  The list of calamities grew rapidly. The town=
 of Tamarang was=20

devoured by the lava. Red-hot stones fired many houses. Eighteen hundred pe=
ople perished. The=20

island of Onius was terribly shaken and then plunged into the sea. The isla=
nd of Midah was=20

swallowed up. No one escaped. The lighthouses on Sunda Strait were wrecked.=
 The town of=20

Tjeringen was destroyed with ten thousand people. Nine hundred people peris=
hed at Waronge.=20

Three hundred corpses were dug from the ruins of Talatoa. The river Jacatan=
a was blocked with=20

lava and ashes, and leaving its bed poured through Batavia.  The island of =
Merak, a fortified place=20

three miles from Krakatoa, was a valuable Government stone quarry, six or s=
even years in use.=20

Thousands of native workmen were assembled there, with engineers and overse=
ers. Their huts=20

were on hills one hundred and fifty feet above the sea. The end of the seas=
on was at hand. The=20

1st of September would see them returning to their Java homes. The island t=
rembled, paused--

sank slowly--the sea plunged over it. Two natives and an European bookkeepe=
r escaped.  A=20

steamer put out from the port of Telok Betong. Two inches of lava lay upon =
her deck. Pumice=20



stone lay ten feet deep on the sea around her. When but a short distance ou=
t =E2=80=9Cwe saw a gigantic=20

wave of prodigious height suddenly advancing upon us at great speed from th=
e  [Illustration:=20

CONVULSION ON THE COAST OF SUMATRA.]  direction of the open sea. Immediatel=
y the=20

captain brought his vessel round so as to meet the wave stern foremost. Aft=
er a moment of most=20

piquant anxiety, we found ourselves lifted up with terrific speed; our vess=
el bounded upward, and=20

then we felt ourselves plunged into the abyss. But the wave had passed us a=
nd we were out of all=20

danger. Like a high mountain the gigantic wave sped furiously towards the s=
hore, while=20

immediately after three other great waves followed it. The waters rushed in=
 and destroyed the=20

town, sweeping away first the light house, which fell in like a pack of car=
ds, then all the buildings=20

beyond. In a few moments all was over, and where once Telok Betong stood th=
ere was nothing=20

but water.=E2=80=9D  Livid with terror, the captain steamed rapidly to warn=
 the town of Anjer. There was no=20

longer an Anjer, a Dutch fort, a garrison. A single sailor, who had=20


_
diminutive size are rather playthings than bastions. The curtain is narrow,=
 and confined on the=20

inside, and unfit for guns of calibre; the buildings within the city overlo=
oking, and even joining the=20

wall in some places. On the other side of the river, within 200 yards of th=
is curtain, are a number of=20

stone houses, along the whole length of its bank; and the bases of these be=
ing walls of eight and=20

ten feet thick of solid masonry, would afford an immediate cover for an ene=
my, who might breach=20

the curtain in ten minutes at so short a distance, and with perfect safety,=
 the fire from some of=20

these taking the whole of the works on the N. Eastern side in reverse. Inde=
ed its only defence on=20

this side is the river, [124] the current of which is always rapid.  Over i=
t is a neat but narrow stone=20

bridge of ten arches, which joins the city at its northern angle to the sub=
urbs. On the city side of=20

the bridge is a square tower, with an archway pierced through it, and with =
embrasures on the top.=20

This is intended as a "tte de pont;" but it is too small for any effective =
purpose, and, like the=20

bastions on this face, resembles a military plaything; and this defect is t=
he more striking, as the=20

fortifications, from this angle on the land and sea faces, are remarkably h=
andsome and well=20

proportioned.  At the north-western point of the city, which joins the mole=
, is the citadel of=20

Santiago, a clumsy old-fashioned fortification, separated from the rest of =
the city by a narrow ditch=20

with a stone bridge, but joined by the curtains of the bastions. It is inca=
pable of any respectable=20

defence, except from a semicircular bastion, which forms the point, and com=
mands the moles and=20

entrance to the river. It is now used as a state prison and magazine. The c=
onvicts employed in the=20

public works are also lodged in it. This was the refuge of the unfortunate =
foreigners  Krakatoa,=20

which had opened this fearful carnival of death, sank slowly into the sea. =
Of the island, twenty-five=20

miles long and seventeen wide, a small portion of the terribly shattered co=
ne remained in sight.=20

New islets were made; vast shoals created. Sailors discovered new islands a=
nd landed, only to=20

find themselves on vast floating pumice rafts, miles from land. New charts =
had to be made. For a=20

time the seas were hardly navigable.  Such is the story. The damage to prop=
erty was millions of=20

dollars. The loss of life will never be definitely known. First estimates p=
laced it at 80,000.=20

Conservative judges pronounced it in all probability between 50,000 and 60,=
000.  The explosions=20

were heard as far away southward as Australia; to the westward as far as So=
uthern India; to the=20

eastward, they are said to have been heard in the Caribbean Sea. Even if we=
 reject the latter, we=20

may take the others, and obtain some idea by imagining volcanoes at St. Lou=
is to be heard at New=20

York and San Francisco, at Mexico and in Hudson=E2=80=99s Bay.  The great s=
ea wave rushed from=20

Krakatoa to the Mauritius in eight hours. It rolled around the coasts of th=
e Australian continent,=20

dashing into the southern harbors, sweeping through the narrow Bass Straits=
. It rose and fell upon=20

Hawaiian coasts in a perplexing manner. It surged against South America; ag=
ainst East Africa; it=20

rounded Cape Horn and made itself known on the coasts of France, upon our A=
tlantic shore. It=20

encircled the world--the greatest sea wave ever known.  The volcanic, micro=
scopic dust remained=20

long in the air, and occasioned the singular redness of the sky at morn and=
 eve that prevailed=20

throughout the world for the next two years. Apart from this suspended dust=
, the volcano threw out=20

as much matter as the Mississippi bears to the gulf in two hundred and fift=
y years.  The=20

atmospheric wave of low=20


_
on the 9th of October 1820; and to the honour of the commandant (Col. Don A=
. Parreno), and his=20

lady be it recorded, they found there another home.  The length of the city=
 within the walls is 1,300=20

yards Spanish, from N. W. to S. E.; its width 744, and circumference 4,166.=
 The side towards the=20

river, it has already been remarked, is, from the want of bastions, and fro=
m the encumbered state=20

of the approaches to it, in a very defective state. The sea and land faces =
are exactly the reverse of=20

this, being remarkably clear and strong.  The land face has a double ditch,=
 and an esplanade of=20

five or six hundred yards in breadth, which towards the river is marshy and=
 swampy, and utterly=20

unfit for military operations. Towards the sea, and for some miles along th=
e coast, is an=20

epaulement, [125] thrown up when in expectation of an attack from the Engli=
sh in 1804. On this=20

esplanade formerly stood a church, from the tower of which the English unde=
r Sir W. Draper fired=20

into the heart of the city: [126] it is now razed. There is also a small ba=
ttery called Charles the=20

Fourth's, on an elevated spot in the marshy ground; it is about 350 yards f=
rom the fortifications and=20

is mostly used as an exercising battery. Another redoubt of stone stands at=
 the southern point of=20

the outer ditch, and flanks the sea shore to a considerable distance to the=
 southward: it also=20

serves to cover the head of the outer ditch, which is not carried round the=
 sea face, apparently for=20

want of room, as its crest would nearly approach high water mark in this pa=
rt.  There are six gates=20

to the city, two on each face: those on the land side have neat stone bridg=
es over the outer ditch,=20

which are not mined, and, being of solid masonry, would be found cumbersome=
 in case of an=20

attack. The inner ones, and those on the sea side, are of wood or stone pil=
lars with drawbridges.=20

The ditches are wide and deep, but much encumbered with mud and weeds, from=
 which last the=20

fortifications also have suffered. The bastions on the sea and land sides a=
re in many places=20

without embrasures, the guns being "en barbette." [127] The shore is not ve=
ry flat, and will=20

perhaps allow a frigate to lay within gunshot of the ramparts.  Within the =
walls of the city is the=20

cathedral, the inside of which is very handsome, though the exterior is des=
titute of all symmetry,=20

and seems to have been intended as a contrast to the majestic architecture =
of the interior.  The=20

governor's palace resembles a decent barn or warehouse, both externally and=
 oceanic wave. On=20

the day when Krakatoa sank into the sea, the barometric oscillation was not=
iced all over the world.=20

From the time at which it reached Berlin, it is found to have travelled eig=
ht hundred and seventy-

five miles an hour. Thirty-six hours later the barometric oscillations were=
 repeated, but less=20

pronounced. Thirty-seven hours afterward there came a third, and still fain=
ter series. It appears,=20

then, that the atmospheric wave, set in motion by this stupendous outbreak,=
 was powerful enough=20

to thrice encircle the world.  It has been but a short time since geologist=
s believed the magnitude=20

of the subterranean forces to be greatly decreased; but in view of a centur=
y of great eruptions=20

closed by such an appalling convulsion, it must be said that the fiery forc=
es are at least as active=20

and powerful as ever.     CHAPTER XXIII.  EARTHQUAKES.      =E2=80=9CDiseas=
ed Nature oftentimes=20

breaks forth      In strange eruptions: and the teeming earth      Is with =
a kind of colic pinched and=20

vexed      By the imprisoning of unruly wind      Within her womb; which fo=
r enlargement striving,=20

Shakes the old beldam earth, and topples down      Steeples and moss-grown =
towers.=E2=80=9D   Such is=20

the theory of earthquakes as laid down by =E2=80=9CWild Will Shakespeare.=
=E2=80=9D Whether it be an expression of=20

the popular belief of the day, or a personal opinion, is not easy to determ=
ine. If the latter, he had,=20

as we shall see by and by, many predecessors in the same belief. His metaph=
or, though more=20

elegantly expressed, cannot compare with the Indian=E2=80=99s for terseness=
 and force: =E2=80=9CGround heap=20



sick--heap belly ache--no good!=E2=80=9D  We have already seen that the for=
ces producing earthquakes=20

and volcanic action are conceded to be practically identical. The latter se=
ldom occurs without the=20

former; but the former are frequent in districts far removed from any known=
 vent of subterranean=20

heat. So the expression of Shakespeare is not so far wrong as might be, so =
far as our present=20

knowledge goes.  In the Hindoo cosmogony successive ages of the world are s=
eparated by=20

periods of chaos; and no wilder image of unreined destruction has fancy eve=
r dreamed. The earth=20

is to be eternal. There is one eternal, invisible spirit, Brahm, from whom =
springs Brahma, who=20

creates a race of gods. These frame the earth into orderly condition, and r=
ule it for four hundred=20

thousand years. At the end of that time, the land and sea and sky meet in g=
igantic ruin; the gods=20

are no more, save only Vishnu, the preserver. The sea covers all things=20


_
the basement being used as a prison.  The Cabildo, or Town House, is a hand=
some building, and=20

the only one in the country which has any pretensions to symmetry, of which=
 the architects of the=20

Phillippines take every opportunity of shewing a sovereign contempt:--so mu=
ch so, that it is rare to=20

find even the doors and windows, or the angles of a room, correctly placed =
and laid out! These=20

three buildings form three sides of a small square, the only one in the cit=
y, of about 100 eternal=20

tempest.  Eternal is not strictly correct, however. This reign of destructi=
on lasts four hundred=20

thousand years, during which time Vishnu sleeps on the coils of the great s=
even-headed serpent=20

of eternity, which floats upon the gloomy sea. The long night over, Vishnu =
wakes and remodels the=20

earth, and peace and light resume their sway. Seven such cycles pass; all t=
hings are annihilated,=20

and Brahm sets about a new creation which goes the same round.  The eastern=
 wise=20


_
being occupied by private houses. In the centre is a handsome pedestal of r=
eddish marble, on=20

which no statue has yet been placed. [128]  The streets of the city are nar=
row and dirty; and the=20

middle being a hollow, in rainy weather forms a continued puddle. They are =
paved at the sides=20

with granite from China, the stone in the immediate neighbourhood of Manila=
 being too soft. The=20

pavement is not in good repair, and in some streets only occupies one side;=
 the other, which is=20

generally occupied by a large house, or the wall of a convent, being heaped=
 up with dirt, rendered=20

solid by long accumulation, and forming a hill against the wall, the recept=
acle of.... This is not=20

confined to bye-lanes, but is most common in the great square (Plaza Consti=
tucional) in front of=20

the cathedral! [129]  The city and suburbs are well lighted, and the Europe=
an quarters of the last=20

are cleaner than the city.  The convents, which occupy nearly one third by =
this to express the=20

persistence and order in the universe, even in periods of the most inexplic=
able disaster; and to=20

picture for the ignorant the absolute eternity of God.  The thing was too g=
ood to let drop; and=20

others added to it by asserting the earth was upborne by an elephant who st=
ood on the back of a=20

tortoise. The tortoise rested on a fish; the fish on water; the water on ai=
r; the air on light; the light=20

on darkness; the darkness on the Lord only knows what. When these animals w=
ere somewhat=20

wearied, they changed their position, and the earth trembled.  Greece had a=
 somewhat better=20

myth of the giant Atlas, who bore the world on his shoulders; but the old f=
ellow=E2=80=99s gait was not of=20

the steadiest. Rome, not much given to manufacturing her myths _de novo_, i=
mported the Grecian=20

fable. We have to-day appropriated the old fellow=E2=80=99s title for a geo=
graphy supposed to contain the=20

whole earth. The figure is lost on most.  But the=20


_
city! are more distinguished for their size and massy architecture, than fo=
r their beauty. The church=20

and convent of St. Augustine, and that of the Jesuits (now fast falling to =
decay), are, however, neat=20

and well built. That of San Domingo is the most extensive.  The hospital of=
 St. John of God, a=20

military order of Knights Hospitallers, is extensive, but for popular ideas=
 of the proper conduct of a=20

steady old porter in a responsible position; and the mythmakers dragged in =
a new scapegoat in=20

the person of the Titan Typhon, or Enceladus, supposed to be entombed in Mt=
. =C3=86tna, as we have=20

elsewhere noticed.  Inhabitants of parts of Farther India and of some Malay=
an islands believe that=20

far down in the bowels of the earth=20


_
entertained. [130] There is also a university (St. Thomas), two colleges fo=
r the instruction of=20

Indians and mestizos, and three convents of nuns, who receive girls to educ=
ate. There are also=20

two schools for girls, both endowed by the piety of single individuals; the=
