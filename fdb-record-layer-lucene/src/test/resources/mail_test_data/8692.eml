as not destined to be left to _
consequence...."  He took up the last paper; his hand was still quite stead=
y.  "Read the letter," said=20

Carrier.  "It is addressed in the English fashion to Lady Anthony Dewhurst,=
" continued Chauvelin=20

slowly, "the Kernogan woman, you know, citizen. It says:       "'Keep up yo=
ur courage. Your friends=20

are inside the city and on the      watch. Try the door of your prison ever=
y evening at one hour=20

before      midnight. Once you will find it yield. Slip out and creep      =
noiselessly down the stairs. At=20

the bottom a friendly hand will be      stretched out to you. Take it with =
confidence--it will lead you=20

to      safety and to freedom. Courage and secrecy.'"  Lalouet had been loo=
king over his shoulder=20

while he read: now he pointed to the bottom of the letter.  "And there is t=
he device," he said, "we=20

have heard so much about of late--a five-petalled flower drawn in red ink .=
.. the Scarlet Pimpernel,=20

I presume."  "Aye! the Scarlet Pimpernel," murmured Chauvelin, "as you say!=
 Braggadocio on his=20

part or accident, his letters are certainly in our hands now and will prove=
--must prove, the tool=20

whereby we can be even with him once and for all."  "And you, citizen Chauv=
elin," interposed=20

Carrier with a sneer, "are mighty lucky to have me to help you this time. I=
 am not going to be=20

fooled, as Candeille and you were fooled last September, as you were fooled=
 in Calais and lives=20

often depended on their persistent and successful begging.  The Company and=
 the private=20

storekeepers were always more or less willing to risk their goods by advanc=
ing them on credit.=20

Before the summer was over, most of these people had got their supplies and=
 were off to the=20

fishing grounds, regardless of the future, with large quantities of tea and=
 tobacco, and happy as=20

kings are said to be--but never are, if history be true!  Among these, of c=
ourse, was La Certe.  That=20

typical idler had made the most of his misfortunes.  Everybody had heard wh=
at the Sioux had done=20

to him, and everybody had pitied him.  Pity opens the heart, and that opens=
 the hand; and, when=20

the poor man entered a store with the polite manner of a French Canadian an=
d the humble aspect=20

of a ruined man, he scarcely required to beg.  One man lent him a tent.  An=
other lent him a canoe.=20

From the Company's store at Fort Garry he received a fair outfit of nearly =
all that he could require.=20

Further down the Settlement there was a private store-keeper with a jovial =
countenance.  "O it was=20

a sad, sad sight!" he said to this man on entering the store--"so very sad =
to see my tent in ashes,=20

and nothing left--nothing-- absolutely!"  The jovial man was moved.  He gav=
e La Certe what he=20

asked for--even pressed things on him, and also bestowed on him a considera=
ble "gratuity."  Still=20

further down the=20


_
capture of those English adventurers."  "And that capture should not be dif=
ficult," added Lalouet=20

with a complacent laugh. "Your famous adventurer's luck hath deserted him t=
his time: an all-

powerful proconsul is pitted against him and the loss of his papers hath de=
stroyed the anonymity=20

on which he reckons."  Chauvelin paid no heed to the fatuous remarks.  How =
little did this flippant=20

young braggart and this coarse-grained bully understand the subtle workings=
 of that same=20

adventurer's brain! He himself--one of the most astute men of the day--foun=
d it difficult. Even now-

-the losing of those letters in the open streets of Nantes--it was part of =
a plan. Chauvelin could=20

have staked his head on that--a part of a plan for the liberation of Lady A=
nthony Dewhurst--but=20

what plan?--what plan?  He took up the letter which his colleague had throw=
n down: he fingered it,=20

handled it, letting the paper crackle through his fingers, as if he expecte=
d it to yield up the secret=20

which it contained. The time had come--of that he felt no doubt--when he co=
uld at last be even=20

with his enemy. He had endured more bitter humiliation at the hands of this=
 elusive Pimpernel than=20

he would have thought himself capable of bearing a couple of years ago. But=
 the time had or shop,=20

of another friend.  This man was saturnine of countenance, but moderately l=
iberal of heart.  La=20

Certe approached him with an air so pitiful that the saturnine man melted l=
ike snow in the sunshine=20

or wax under heat.  "I have heard of your loss," he said, "and I will give =
you credit _this_ time, La=20

Certe, though you _are_ so bad at paying your debts.  But I won't give you =
much."  "I do not want=20

much," returned the afflicted man in tones of deep humility--"only a little=
--a very little."  By asking=20

much more than he required, La Certe obtained as much as he wanted from the=
 saturnine man,=20

and thus he finally started for Lake Winnipeg with a canoe laden, almost to=
 sinking, with the good=20

things of this life.  The fineness of that summer brought forth the fruits =
of the earth in great=20

luxuriance, and it really seemed as if at last the Scotch settlers were goi=
ng to reap some reward=20

for all their prolonged perseverance and industry.  The long rest, the good=
 feeding, the sunshine of=20

nature, and the starlight of Elspie's eyes had a powerful effect on Dan Dav=
idson's health, so that,=20

by the time autumn arrived and the prospects of a splendid harvest became m=
ore certain every=20

day, he had recovered much of his usual strength of body and vigour of=20


_
his every faculty on the alert, if Fate helped him and his own nerves stood=
 the strain. Above all if=20

this blundering, self-satisfied Carrier could be reckoned on!...  There lay=
 the one great source of=20

trouble! He--Chauvelin--had no power: he was disgraced--a failure--a nonent=
ity to be sneered at.=20

He might protest, entreat, wring his hands, weep tears of blood and not one=
 man would stir a  Little=20

Bill also felt the genial influences around him, and, to the intense joy of=
 Archie, became visibly=20

fatter and stronger, while his large blue eyes lost some of that wistfully =
solemn appearance with=20

which they had been wont to gaze inquiringly into people's faces.  One afte=
rnoon Billie, having=20

walked to the summer house in the Prairie Cottage garden, along with Archie=
, was left=20
