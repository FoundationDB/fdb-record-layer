The sphere of irrational animals, having no feeling save that of self-preservation and gratification of the senses: also of intensely selfish human beings, waking or sleeping. This philodendron monstera underworld or antipodes: Myalba. The sphere of irrational animals, having no feeling save that of self-preservation and gratification of the senses: also of intensely selfish human beings, waking or sleeping. This _
from ABSOLUTENESS, and is the first something in the Universe. Its correspondence is the 

Hierarchy of non-substantial primordial Beings, in a place which is no place (for us), a state which 

is no state. This Hierarchy contains the primordial plane, all that was, is, and will be, from the 

beginning to the end of the Mahamanvantara; all is there. This statement should not, however, be 

taken to imply Kismet: the latter is contrary to all the teachings of Occultism.  Here are the 

Hierarchies of the Dhyani Buddhas. Their state is that of Parasamadhi, of the Dharmakaya; a state 

where no progress is possible. The entities there may be said to be crystallized in purity, in 

homogeneity.  6. _Vitala._ Here are the Hierarchies of the celestial Buddhas, or Bodhisattvas, who 

are said to emanate from the seven Dhyani Buddhas. It is related on earth to Samadhi, to the 

Buddhic consciousness in man. No Adept, save one, can be higher than this and live; if he passes 

into the Atmic or Dharmakaya state (Alaya) he can return to earth no more. These two states are 

purely hyper-metaphysical.  5. _Sutala._ A differential state corresponding on earth with the 

Higher Manas, and therefore with Shabda (Sound), the Logos, our Higher Ego; and also to the 

Manushi Buddha state, like that of Gautama, on earth. This is the third stage of Samadhi (which is 

septenary). Here belong the Hierarchies of the Kumaras--the Agnishvattas, etc.  4. _Karatala_ 

corresponds with Sparsha (touch) and to the Hierarchies of ethereal, semi-objective Dhyan 

Chohans of  "What!" exclaimed Porthos "without supper? Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little?" 

"Yes, but I?" said Mordaunt.  "Well, you," said Porthos, "what then?"  "I cannot wait."  "Oh! as to 

you, that is not my concern, and I shall sup either with or without your permission."  The young 

man's eyes kindled in secret, but he restrained himself.  "Monsieur," said D'Artagnan, "you must 

excuse famished travelers. Besides, our supper can't delay you much. We will hasten on to the 

inn; you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor. We will take a bite and shall be there as 

soon as you are."  "Just as you please, gentlemen, provided we set sail," he said.  "The name of 

your ship?" inquired D'Artagnan.  "The Standard."  "Very well; in half an hour we shall be on 

board."  And the friends, spurring on their horses, rode to the hotel, the "Arms of England."  "What 

do you say of that young man?" asked D'Artagnan, as they hurried along.  "I say that he doesn't 

suit me at all," said Porthos, "and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramis's advice."  "By no 

means, my dear Porthos; that man is a messenger of General Cromwell; it would insure for us a 

poor reception, I imagine, should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his 

confidant."  "Nevertheless," said Porthos, "I have always noticed that Aramis gives good advice." 

"Listen," returned D'Artagnan, "when our embassy is finished----"  "Well?"  "If it brings us back to 

France----"  "Well?"  "Well, we shall see."  At that moment the two friends reached the 


_
Manas, or the pure ray of Manas, that is the Lower Manas before it is mixed with Kama (as in the 

young child). They are called Sparsha Devas, the Devas endowed with touch. These Hierarchies 

of Devas are progressive: the first have one sense; the second two; and so on to seven: each 

containing all the senses potentially, but not yet developed. Sparsha would be where they supped 

with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port.  There they found a brig ready to set 

sail, upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently.  "It is 

singular," said D'Artagnan, whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard, "it is astonishing how 

that young man resembles some one I must have

3. _Rasatala_, or Rupatala: corresponds to the Hierarchies of Rupa or Sight Devas, possessed of 

three senses, sight, hearing, and touch. These are the Kama-Manasic entities, and the higher 

Elementals. With the Rosicrucians they were the Sylphs and Undines. It  A few minutes later they 

were on board, but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men, and it 

was eight o'clock before they raised anchor.  The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all 

sail to be spread.  Porthos, completely

with an artificial state of consciousness, such as that produced by hypnotism and drugs (morphia, 

etc.).  2. _Mahatala._ Corresponds to the Hierarchies of Rasa or Taste Devas, and includes a 

state of consciousness embracing the lower five senses and emanations of life and being. It 

corresponds to Kama and Prana in man, and to Salamanders and Gnomes in nature.  1. _Patala._ 

Corresponds to the Hierarchies of of seventy leagues on horseback, retired to his cabin and went 

to sleep.  D'Artagnan, overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt, walked with him upon the deck 

and invented a hundred stories to make him talk.  Mousqueton was seasick.     55. The 

Scotchman.   And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably, not toward London, 

where D'Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going, but to Durham,
