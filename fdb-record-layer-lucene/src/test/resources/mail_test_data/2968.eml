 still, this is little reward for=20

your wise doings, my boy. Ask something more."  "Then, Sire, I beg this," s=
aid Harold, with shining=20

eyes. "Let Robert and Richard go with me as assistant pages. That will be a=
 merry vacation for us=20

all; no better boon could I ask!"  The King laughed merrily. "A boy's wish!=
" he said, "but it shall be=20

granted. Now, come hither, Harold." With these words King Victor threw over=
 the boy's shoulders a=20

heavy gold chain with a cross hanging from it. "'Blessed are the peacemaker=
s,'" quoted King=20

Victor. "Wear this, Harold, a token from your grateful country. And with it=
 goes the gift of a hundred=20

books, which you shall choose for yourself, to be the beginning of a librar=

was beginning to bore him.=20

"I suppose I can't help your publishing what you like, only you will do you=
rself more harm than me.=20

Let me know when society has 'precipitated' you out of it, and I will come =

efore, _Ding dong!=20

Ding dong!_ A holiday for the school children of Kisington, Harold's friend=
s. Therefore,--_Ding=20

dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!_  Harold went home to his mother with the glad =
news. And proud=20

enough she was of her lad when she heard why all the bells were ringing, an=
d saw his golden=20

cross.   XXII: THE BOOKS CONQUER  Thus began the wonderful fortnight of vac=
ation that Harold=20

and Robert and Richard never forgot in all their lives.  For a happy week t=
he War-Lord tarried in=20

Kisington. He spent much of his time studying at the library, reading many =
books, but especially=20

such tales as Harold thought the little Princess Hope would enjoy. Many of =
these he heard Harold=20

read aloud; sometimes in the cozy alcoves of the library, where they could =
disturb no one;=20

sometimes in the sumptuous apartments of the palace which King Victor had p=
ut at the disposal of=20

Red Rex; oftenest and best of all in the little thatched cottage of Harold'=
s mother, where the Red=20

King came to feel perfectly at home. For one of the first things Harold did=
 in his vacation time was=20

to invite the War-Lord to dinner.  "We shall have for dessert one of my mot=
her's famous apple=20

pies," promised Harold with a twinkle. The Red King blushed; but he accepte=
d the invitation in a=20

truly kingly spirit.  There was now plenty to eat and drink in Harold's hom=
e, and a nice little maid to=20

help his mother and make the days pleasanter. It was a very merry party tha=
t gathered around the=20

table in the kitchen that night. Richard and Robert were there; for the Red=
 King had taken a fancy=20

to them, and they all talked together like old friends. The Red King had ma=
ny thrilling adventures=20

to tell them of his roving life. And Red Rex was learning many new and nove=
l things of them all the=20

while. For this was the first time he had ever eaten in a thatched cottage,=
 or in the company of=20

simple strangers.  When the great pie was brought in, all steaming and spic=
y, Harold and the War-

Lord exchanged a peculiar glance.  "Your Majesty has tasted my pie before,"=
 said Harold's mother=20

innocently. "I sent a piece with Harold's luncheon one day, and he tells me=
 you approved of it.=20

That is why we have it to-day for dessert."  "Ah! I approve of it, indeed! =
I shall never forget your=20

pie, dear little Mother!" cried the Red King with a laugh. "It is worth adv=
enturing much to obtain=20

even a bite of pies like yours."  "They taste best of all at midnight," sai=
d Harold mischievously.=20

"That I cannot believe," said Red Rex, frowning at him. "I never ate pie so=
 delicious before this=20

day!"  "Do you think one piece of pie hot is worth five pies cold, Your tha=
t I should be most likely to=20

hear the truth by applying to the Honourable Spiffington."  The same reason=
s which have=20

compelled me to maintain a certain reserve in relating my conversation with=
 this gentleman=20

prevent me fully describing the steps which I am at present taking to arran=
ge Lady Broadhem's=20

affairs, and which will occupy me during the Easter recess. Now, thank good=
ness, I think I see my=20

way to preventing the grand crash which she feared, but I decline to state =
the amount of my own=20

fortune which will be sacrificed in the operation. The great inconvenience =
of the whole proceeding=20

is the secrecy which it necessarily involves. Grandon is under the impressi=
on that I am gambling=20

on the Stock Exchange, and is miserable in consequence, because he fancies =
I add to that sin the=20

more serious one of denying it. Lady Ursula, whom I have avoided seeing alo=
ne, but who knows=20

that I am constantly plotting in secret with her mother, is no doubt beginn=
ing to think that I am=20

wicked as well as mad, and is evidently divided between the secret obligati=
on of keeping the=20

secret of my insanity, and her dread lest in some way or other her mother s=
hould be the victim of=20

it. Lady Bridget is unmistakably afraid of me. The other day when I went in=
to the drawing-room and=20



found her alone, she turned as pale as a sheet, jumped up, and stammered ou=
t something about=20

going to find mamma, and rushed out of the room. Did I not believe in Ursul=
a as in my own=20

existence, I could almost fancy she had betrayed me. Then there is Broadhem=
. He is utterly=20

puzzled. He knows that I am come to pull the family out of the mess, and pu=
t his own cherished=20

little person into a financially sound condition; and he is equally well as=
sured that I would not make=20

this sacrifice without feeling certain of marrying his sister. But, in the =
first place, that any man=20

should sacrifice anything, either for his sister or any other woman, is a m=
ystery to Broadhem; and,=20

in the second, I strongly suspect that Ursula has said something which make=
s him very doubtful=20

whether she is engaged to me or not. Poor girl! I feel for her. Was ever a =
daughter and sister=20

before placed in the embarrassing position of leaving her own mother and br=
other in the delusion=20

that she was engaged to be married to a man who had never breathed to her t=
he subject of his=20

love, much less of matrimony? Then Spiffy and Lady Broadhem's lawyer both l=
ook upon the=20

marriage as settled: how else can they account for the trouble I am taking,=
 and the liberality I am=20

displaying? There is something mysterious, moreover, in the terms upon whic=
h I am in the house.=20

Lady Broadhem is beginning to think it unnatural that I should not care to =
see more of Ursula; and=20

whenever she is not quite absorbed with considering her own affairs, is mak=
ing=20


_
"Yes, indeed!" cried the Red King, turning still redder. "Especially if eat=
en in such pleasant=20

company."  "So thought not the wicked old woman who stole my pies," said Ha=
rold's mother. "I=20

wonder if she will ever dare to claim that beautiful shawl which she left b=
ehind her?"  "I dare say=20

not," frowned the Red King. "And inasmuch as the Lord Mayor declares that s=
he must have been=20

a native of my Kingdom, intruding within your walls, I hereby make over to =
you that shawl which=20

she has forfeited by her wicked deed. Wear it henceforth without a qualm, M=
other."  She wore it to=20

church the very next Sunday, and all the ladies envied her this last piece =
of good luck which=20

seemed to follow the coming of the Red King.  Red Rex was eager to visit ev=
ery corner of=20

Kisington about which he had heard in the Chronicles. Since this was vacati=
on time, Harold and=20

Robert and Richard were overjoyed to be his guides. They visited the Old Cu=
riosity Shop where=20

the Lion Passant had lived dumbly for years before the coming of the Patent=
 Medicine Man. The=20

store was still kept by a wheezy old fellow with a cough; though he was not=
 the same who had=20

spilled the Elixir over the Lion Passant. Of him the War-Lord bought so man=
y curiosities that he=20

and his little old wife became quite rich, and never had to worry about the=
 future any more.  They=20

visited the ruined old arrangement known among mammas by the expression, "b=
ringing the young=20

people together"--as if any young people who really cared to be together, c=
ould not bring=20

themselves together without mamma or anybody else interfering. Fortunately =
Lady Broadhem is=20

so much more taken up with her own speculations than with either her daught=
er's happiness or=20

mine, that I am always able to give the conversation a City turn when she b=
roaches the delicate=20

subject of Ursula. How Ursula manages on these occasions I cannot conceive,=
 but I do my best to=20

prevent Lady Broadhem talking about me to her, as I always say mysteriously=
, that if she does, "it=20

will spoil everything"--an alarming phrase, which produces an immediate eff=
ect. Still it is quite clear=20

that this kind of thing can't continue long. If I can only keep matters goi=
ng for a few days more,=20

they will all be out of town for Easter, and that will give me time to brea=
the. As it is, it is impossible=20

to shut my eyes to the fact, that my best friend is beginning to doubt me--=
that the girl I love dreads=20

me--and that the rest of the family, and those sufficiently connected with =
it to observe my=20

proceedings, either pity, laugh at, or despise me. This, however, by no mea=
ns prevents their using=20

their utmost endeavours to ruin me. That is the present state of matters. T=
he situation cannot=20

remain unchanged during=20


_
road to Hushby, where Arthur had found the magic glass, made by his uncle t=
he Amateur=20

Magician. It was now all in ruins, inhabited only by bats and owls and rats=
. But the Red King=20

prowled about the crumbling chambers with the greatest delight, and took ho=
me a paper of=20

pebbles as a souvenir for the little Princess Hope, who made "collections."=
  They visited the=20

famous bakehouse of the Rafe-Margot Company, where a kind of pastry called =
"Kingspies" was=20

still made after the old recipe, which had first been used in the oven of t=
he premises. For this was=20

the site of the little red house that had stood on the acre of land under t=
he red-apple tree. All these=20

had disappeared; and the Kingspies, which the Red King tasted eagerly, were=
 not as good as the=20

home-made variety of which Harold's mother had inherited the secret. For th=
ere is something dear=20

reader? Do you wish me well out of it?     PART IV.  THE WORLD.       PICCA=
DILLY, _May_.  The=20

great difficulty which I find in this record of my eventful existence is, t=
hat I have too much to say.=20

The sensations of my life will not distribute themselves properly. It is qu=
ite impossible for me to=20

cram all that I think, say, and do every month into the limited space at my=
 disposal. Thus I am=20

positively overwhelmed with the brilliant dialogues, the elevating reflecti=
ons, and the thrilling=20

incidents, all of which I desire to relate. No one who has not tried this s=
ort of thing can imagine the=20

chronological, to say nothing of the crinological, difficulties in which I =
find myself. For instance, the=20

incidents which occupied the whole of my last chapter took place in twenty-=
four hours, and yet=20
