welfare state, exportable natural endowments, a low tax burden and a pressing need for 

unhindered inflows of foreign investment.  Russia's only hope of steady economic growth is the 

expansion of its energy behemoths abroad. Last year it has become a net foreign direct investor. It 

has a vested interest in globalization and world order which coincide with America's. China, for 

instance, is as much Russia's potential adversary as it is the United State's.  Russia welcomed the 

demise of the Taliban and is content with regime changes in Iraq and North Korea - all American 

exploits. It can - and does - contribute to America's global priorities. Collaboration between the two 

countries' intelligence services has never been closer. Hence also the thaw in Russia's relations 

with its erstwhile foe, Israel.  Russia's population is hungry and abrasively materialistic. Its robber 

barons are more American in spirit than any British or French entrepreneur. Russia's business 

ethos is reminiscent of 19th century frontier America, not of 20th century staid Germany.  Russia is 

driven by kaleidoscopically shifting coalitions within a narrow elite, not by its masses - and the elite 

wants money, a lot of it and now. In Russia's unbreakable cycle,  money yields power which leads 

to more money. The country is a functioning democracy but elections there do not revolve around 

the economy. Most taxes are evaded by most taxpayers and half the gross national product is 

anyhow underground. Ordinary people crave law and order - or, at least a semblance thereof. 

Hence Putin's rock idol popularity. He caters to the needs of the elite by cozying up to the West 

and, in particular, to America - even as he provides the lower classes with a sense of direction and 

security they lacked since 1985. But Putin is a serendipitous president. He enjoys the aftereffects 

of a sharply devalued, export-enhancing, imports-depressing ruble and the vertiginous tripling of 

oil blood-red cross of St. George floating from the mast-head.  The captain of the war-ship turned 

out to be Samuel Argall, a young and daring English mariner, who had joined his fortunes to those 

of Virginia.  While he was cruising with sixty men off the coast of Maine on the lookout for codfish, 

some friendly Indians boarded the ship and told him that French intruders were hard by, building a 

fort.  By no means a kind, indulgent young man was Argall, and his eyes kindled angrily.  {27} 

"Oho!" he exclaimed, with an oath, "how dare these rascals venture into King James, my master's 

territory!"  Whereupon, stimulated by hopes of plunder, he unmuzzled his fourteen cannon and 

assaulted and sacked the yet defenceless French settlement, killing several, including one of the 

priests, and making prisoners of the rest.  This done, he destroyed every trace of the colony. 

Fifteen Frenchmen, including La Saussaye, he turned adrift in an open boat, while the others he 

took back with him to Virginia.  Those whom Argall abandoned to their fate would surely have 

perished had it not been for friendly Indians, who gave them food and helped them on their way 

north.  There they eventually met a trading vessel and were carried back to France.  As to the 

prisoners, on landing at Jamestown they were treated as pirates by the English settlers there. 

Although afterwards released, the Virginian governor, Sir Thomas Dale, was so incensed at 

hearing from one of them about Port Royal, that he bade Argall return, with three armed ships, and 

sweep every Frenchman out of Acadia.  Argall carried out his instructions only too well; he set fire 

to the fort and settlement of Port Royal, and in a few hours the entire place, the gallant 

Poutraincourt's hope and pride, was a mass of smoking ruins.  Luckily for themselves, most of the 

French happened to be away in the forest at the time, and so saved their lives.  Some took 

permanent refuge with the Indians, and

Russia's main foreign exchange generator.  The last years of Yeltsin have been so traumatic that 

the bickering cogs and wheels of Russia's establishment united behind the only vote-getter they 

could lay their hands on: Putin, an obscure politician and former KGB officer. To a large extent, he 

proved to be an agreeable puppet, concerned mostly with self-preservation and the imaginary 

projection of illusory power.  Putin's great asset is his pragmatism and realistic assessment of the 

shambles that Russia has become and of his own limitations. He has turned himself into a kind of 

benevolent and enlightened arbiter among feuding interests - and as the merciless and diligent 

executioner of the decisions of the inner cabals of power.  Hitherto he kept everyone satisfied. But 

Iraq is his first real test. Everyone demands commitments backed by actions. Both the Europeans 

and the Americans want him to put his vote at the Security Council where his mouth is. The armed 

services want him to oppose war in Iraq. The intelligence services are divided. The Moslem 

population inside Russia - and surrounding it on all sides - is restive and virulently anti-American. 

The oil industry is terrified of America' domination of the world's second largest proven reserves - 

but also craves to do business in the United States. Intellectuals and Russian diplomats worry 

about America's apparent disregard for the world order spawned by these was young Biencourt. 

Others found their way to the colony which, as we shall now narrate, Champlain had by {28} this 

time formed far away at Quebec.  But it was all over with Port Royal, at least for the present.  With 

a heavy heart Poutraincourt sailed away to France, and soon afterwards in battle laid down his life 

for his sovereign.  So ends the first chapter in the story of that part of Canada then called Acadia. 

We will return to it again, for the adventurous young Biencourt is still there roaming in the woods 

with a handful of faithful followers, ready to found Port Royal anew.  In the meantime what was 

happening to Champlain, who a few years before had sailed a thousand miles up the mighty St. 

Lawrence to found a colony?  It is high time that we should now turn to his adventures.     {29} 

CHAPTER III  OF THE DOINGS OF GALLANT CHAMPLAIN  When the Sieur de Monts 

abandoned Acadia, thinking, as indeed it seemed, an evil spell had been cast upon it, he turned 

his attention to Quebec and the river St. Lawrence.  Here, far inland, was a fair region which 

promised wealth and glory, and over this region he appointed Champlain his lieutenant.  Of the 

two ships which De Monts fitted out one was for the fur trade, of which King Henry, ere his heart 

was pierced by the dagger of Ravaillac, gave him a monopoly for one year; the other was to carry 

colonists to found a new French settlement.  You have seen

of World War II. The average Russian regards the Iraqi stalemate as an internal American affair. 

"It is not our war", is a common refrain, growing commoner.  Putin has played it admirably nimbly. 

Whether he ultimately succeeds in this impossible act of balancing had, from this cause or that, 

come to destruction; but with such a wise and strong head as Samuel de Champlain, one now was 

expected to bear better and more lasting fruit.  Truly, whatever their faults, the founders of New 

France were very determined men,
