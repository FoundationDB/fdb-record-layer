State some service." When Vice-Chancellor Emery passed away, I became the only survivor of 

the little company.  Professor Joel Parker, as I knew him, was a courteous gentleman of the old 

school, sixty-nine years of age, _tenax propositi_ public-spirited, courageous and combative, who 

had established a high reputation as a jurist by his opinions as Chief Justice of New Hampshire for 

fifteen years. As a conservative Whig he had supported the Compromises of 1850, but presided 

over a meeting of the citizens of Cambridge, held June 2, 1856, to from 'em, when they are ripe, 

and they both quit the Stone freely. Take these and peel them, and divide them; then put them in a 

little Water and their weight of fine Sugar, made into a Syrup, over a gentle Fire: put them in when 

the Liquor is only warm, and when they are cover'd with the Syrup, stew them gently, if you would 

preserve them in their Shape; and put them, with the Syrup, into Glasses as soon as they are 

clear, or else mash them into the Syrup, and let them boil till they become like a Paste; keeping all 

stirring while they are over

speech on that occasion showed the mettle of the man. "For myself, personally, I am perhaps 

known to most of you as a peaceful citizen, reasonably conservative, devotedly attached to the 

Constitution, and much too far advanced in life for gasconade; but, under present circumstances, I 

may be pardoned for saying that some of my father's blood was shed on Bunker Hill, at the 

commencement of one revolution, and that there is a little more of the same sort left, if it shall 

prove necessary, for the beginning of another." The Professor had a true instinct. The attack on 

Senator Sumner was the first act of civil war; the John Brown raid the second; the firing on Fort 

Sumpter the third.  Professor Parker, when Chief Justice of New Hampshire, had a memorable 

struggle with Judge Story, who held the United States Circuit Court, over a question under the 

Bankrupt Law. The facts are stated on pages 245 and 246 of the History of the Law School. In my 

time it was thought that Professor Parker did not like Story, or Story's rather showy law books. He 

probably would have agreed with the following remarks on page 12 of the History: "Story was the 

kindly master who, in his lectures, smoothed the rough places and was profuse with Pan. This 

Marmalade is good to be serv'd in Glasses as a Sweet-meat in a Desert, or to be put into Coffins 

for Tarts, or to be brought upon the Table in Saucers among the other Sweet-meats in a Desert. 

To stew _Cucumbers._ From the _Devil-_Tavern, _Fleet-street._  Take a dozen large green 

Cucumbers, that are not too full of Seed; pare them, and slice them; then take two large Onions, 

and shred them indifferently small. Put these in a Sauce-Pan, and set them over the Fire to stew, 

with as much Salt as you think convenient; stir them now and then, till they are tender, and then 

pour them into a Cullender to drain from the Water, and are as dry as possible you can make 

them; then flour them, and put some Pepper to them. After this, burn some Butter in a Frying-Pan; 

and when it is very hot, put in your Cucumbers, and stir them continually till they are brown; then 

put to them about a Gill of Claret; and when that is well mix'd with them, serve them hot, under 

roast Mutton or Lamb; or else, serve them on a Plate, upon Sippits fry'd and dip'd in Mutton or 

Beef Gravey.    To Farce _Cucumbers._ From the same.  Take large Cucumbers and pare them, 

then scoop out all the Seeds, first cutting off one End, then prepare 


_
may suppose his lectures, like his books, to have been learned, fluent, often original and profound, 

sometimes, however, dodging a difficulty rather than trying to overcome it." I have heard it said 

that Story stands higher as a writer of opinions than as a legal author.  There was in my day a 

student named Stevenson who was assigned to argue one side of a Hearts of some Cabbage-

Lettuce stew'd tender in Salt and Water, drain them well, and chop them small, and cut some 

Onion very fine, shred a little Parsley that has been boil'd tender, and a Mushroom pickled; and 

add a little All-Spice finely powder'd, and some Pepper, a little Salt, and some Fat of Bacon chopt 

small. Mix these well together, with the Yolk of 


_
Stevenson, who knew and well understood the Professor, in the course of his argument read a few 

sentences from one of Story's books and then, pausing and looking at the Judge, said: "May it 

please your Honor. There follows this passage about half a page of Latin. I have not or two, 

according to your Quantity, and stuff the Cucumbers full of it. Then tie the Ends, that were cut off 

close, with Packthread, and stew them in Water and Salt till they are tender; then drain them and 

flour them, and fry them brown in Hogs-Lard very hot, and let them

it looks as though it were on our side."  Professor Parker, during the War for the Union was _pro_ 

the administration _saepe_; _pro lege, pro republica semper_. He had, of course, profound 

reverence for the writ of habeas corpus. A student once stated a strong case of treasonable 

conduct and asked him if he would not suspend the writ in such a case. "No, sir," said the 

Professor, "I would not suspend the writ of habeas corpus, but I would suspend the corpus." 

Professor Theophilus Parsons was a son of the great Chief Justice of Massachusetts of the same 

name. He was sixty-six years of age when I knew him, a man of the world who had touched life at 

many points, a voluminous writer of law books and an instructive and entertaining Threads that 

hold them together, and lay them in your Dish, and pour the following Sauce over them: _viz._ 

Take Gravey well season'd, and as much Claret; boil these together, with some Lemon-Peel, and 

All-Spice; and thicken this Sauce with burnt Butter. These are good to be serv'd with Mutton 

Cutlets, as well as alone.    To make a _Shropshire_ Pye.  Take a couple of Rabbits, and cut them 

in pieces; season them well with Pepper and Salt; then cut some pieces of fat Pork, and season 

them in like manner. Lay these into your Crust, with some pieces of Butter, upon the bottom Crust, 

and close your Pye. Then pour in half a Pint of Water, and red Wine mixt, and bake it. Some will 

grate the best part of a Nutmeg upon the Meat, before they

class. I used to have among my books a small volume of sublimated Swedenborgian doctrine 

written by him. It was difficult to associate it with the genial and jovial man you saw in the lecture 

room. I have tried to assimilate this message from the New Jerusalem, but have failed, no doubt 

because of some invincible ignorance and innate incapacity of my serv'd hot.    To make a 

_Shropshire_ Pye, another way. From Lady _H._  Take Rabbits and Pork, cut and season'd as 

above; then make a Farce of the Rabbits Livers parboil'd, and shred small; some fat Bacon shred 

small, some sweet Marjoram powder'd, some Pepper and Salt, and made into a Paste, with the 

Yolks of Eggs beaten; and then make this into Balls,
