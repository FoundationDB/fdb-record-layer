THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS DECLARES AGAINST THE POPE DELLA         LUNA, IN TH=
E=20

PRESENCE OF THE KING OF FRANCE.=E2=80=94KING LOUIS         OF SICILY LEAVES=
 PARIS.=E2=80=94OF=20

THE BORGNE DE LA HEUSE.   At the beginning of this year, the university of =
Paris declared=20

against pope Benedict, in the manner following, by master Jean Courteheuse,=
 a native of=20

Normandy. The assembly was held in the great hall of the palace, in the pre=
sence of the kings of=20

France and Sicily, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, Bar and Brabant,=E2=80=94t=
he counts de Mortaign[123],=20

de Nevers, de St Pol, de Tancarville[124],=E2=80=94the rector of the univer=
sity, with deputies from that=20

body,=E2=80=94the earl of Warwick from England, ambassadors from Scotland a=
nd Wales, and a great=20

multitude of clergy and people of Paris.  Master Jean Courteheuse took his =
text from the 7th=20

Psalm: =E2=80=98Convertetur dolor in caput ejus, et in verticem ipsius iniq=
uitas ejus descendet.=E2=80=99 Which is,=20

For his travail shall come upon his own head, and his wickedness shall fall=
 on his own pate.  He=20

divided his speech into six conclusions. First, That Pietro della Luna was =
obstinately schismatic,=20

not to say an heretic, a disturber of the peace and union of the church.  S=
econdly, That the said=20

Pietro ought not to bear the name of Benedict, pope, cardinal, or any other=
 title of dignity,=E2=80=94and=20

that he ought not to be obeyed as pastor of the church, under penalty of su=
ffering the sentences=20



pronounced against those who favour schismatics.  Thirdly, That the provisi=
ons, sentences and=20

declarations of the bull, and the pains and penalties therein threatened, a=
re of no value.  Fourthly,=20

That the contents of the said bull and letter are wicked, seditious, full o=
f deceit, and tending to=20

disturb the king=E2=80=99s peace.  Fifthly, That no one whatever may pay th=
e smallest attention to them,=20

without being guilty of the crime of favouring schismatics.  Sixthly, That =
such as may favour or=20

support their contents may be lawfully proceeded against in the courts of j=
ustice.  After master=20

Jean Courteheuse had made all his conclusions, he offered certain requests =
on the part of the=20

university of Paris to the king of France. The first was, That great dilige=
nce should be used in=20

searching after copies of Pietro della Luna=E2=80=99s letter, and that all =
who might conceal them should be=20

punished according to their deserts; that many of his supporters existed wi=
thin the kingdom, whom=20

the university would denounce in due time and place.  The second request wa=
s, That=20

henceforward neither the king nor any of his realm would receive letters fr=
om Pietro della Luna.=20

The third, That the king would command his daughter the university to preac=
h the true doctrine=20

throughout the kingdom.  The fourth, That the bishop of St Flour, who had b=
een sent ambassador=20

to the aforesaid Pietro, should be arrested and imprisoned, together with m=
aster Pierre de=20

Courselles, Sansien le Leu, the dean of St Germain d=E2=80=99Auxerre, and p=
unished according to their=20

demerits,=E2=80=94and that the bull should be torn to pieces, as injurious =
and offensive to the royal=20

majesty.  The university declared, that it would proceed to greater objects=
 touching the faith, and=20

demonstrate and explain these things before those whom it might concern in =
proper time and=20

place.  The king instantly assented to the requests made by the university;=
 and then the bull was=20

torn in pieces by the rector of the university, in the presence of the whol=
e assembly. The dean of=20

St Germain d=E2=80=99Auxerre, being there, was arrested, and put into confi=
nement.  Shortly after, the=20

abbot of Saint Denis, master Jean de Sains, formerly secretary to the king,=
 and many others of=20

name, were imprisoned at the Louvre.  Such diligence was used that the king=
=E2=80=99s officers overtook=20

the messenger who had brought the bull at Lyons, and brought him back a pri=
soner to Paris, with=20

the aforesaid Sansien le Leu, who had been taken in the church of Clervaulx=
; for the king and all=20

the princes were very indignant against the pope della Luna.  This pope, he=
aring how he had=20

excited the anger of the king of France, of the princes, and of the univers=
ity of Paris, began to be=20

much alarmed, and, in consequence, embarked at Porto Venere, attended by fo=
ur cardinals only,=20

and went first to Arragon, and thence to Perpignan.  About this time, king =
Louis of Sicily took leave=20

of the king of France, and left Paris for Provence, to oppose some who were=
 favourable to his=20

adversary king Ladislaus. The queen of France was still at Melun, whither t=
he king went, and after=20

some days stay returned to Paris, where the ambassadors from Scotland were =
waiting for him.=20

When they had received a large sum of money from the king to carry on the w=
ar against the=20

English, they took leave and returned home.  The king of France also grante=
d to the ambassadors=20

from Wales, for the same object, three hundred men at arms and two hundred =
cross-bows, to be=20

maintained at his expense for one whole year. They were to be commanded by =
the borgne de la=20

Heuse, a knight of great renown, and a native of Normandy, to whom the king=
 ordered vessels and=20

money to be delivered, that he might embark for Wales.                     =

=94THE KING OF=20

HUNGARY WRITES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF         PARIS.   On the 5th day of July=
, the duke of=20



Burgundy left Paris, attended by his two brothers, to the great vexation of=
 many princes, governors=20

of the realm. The object of his journey was to celebrate in Arras the birth=
-day of the bishop of that=20

city, whose name was Martin Por=C3=A9e, of the order of Preachers, and also=
 his confessor. He went=20

thence to Ghent to visit his duchess.  He made great preparations to march =
to the assistance of=20

his brother-in-law John of Bavaria, bishop of Liege, whom the Liegeois had =
deprived of his=20

bishoprick, and banished their country. He had taken refuge with many gentl=
emen of his party in=20

the town of Maestricht, wherein he was besieged by his enemies under the co=
mmand of the lord=20

de Pieruels and his son, whom the Liegeois had elected bishop in his stead.=
  On the other hand,=20

duke William count of Hainault, brother to John of Bavaria, the count de Co=
nversent[125], lord of=20

Anghien, and many other great lords of the country, assembled a large body =
of men at arms, who,=20

when joined by the lords de Croy and de Hely with their men, sent by the du=
ke of Burgundy,=20

amounted to a very considerable force.  They marched toward the country of =
Liege, to make war=20

upon it, for the cause before mentioned, and first burnt a house and farm b=
elonging to a church of=20

the order of Cistercians. They then advanced to Fosse and Florennes[126], w=
here they committed=20

much destruction by fire and sword, as well as throughout the whole country=
 on the banks of the=20

Sambre. They took several forts by storm, and put to death all found therei=
n; nor were the lives of=20

any spared, of whatever sex or rank, in those parts.  On this expedition so=
me new knights were=20

made, among whom were Pierre de Luxembourg count de Conversent, Engilbert d=
=E2=80=99Anghien, and=20

many more. When duke William had despoiled the country, suspecting the Lieg=
eois would march=20

against him to offer battle, and knowing they were in superior numbers, he =
retreated homeward,=20

burning every house or village he passed; and his men were loaded with the =
booty they had made.=20

When he was returned home, he raised another army in conjunction with the d=
uke of Burgundy,=20

with the intent of marching again toward Liege and offering battle to the L=
iegeois.  At this time, a=20

severe war was carrying on between the Spaniards and the Saracens of the ki=
ngdom of Granada.=20

The king of Spain[127], magnificently attended by his Spaniards, and sir Ro=
binet de Braquemont,=20

a knight from Normandy, embarked on board twenty-four gallies, well provide=
d with men at arms=20

and stores, to combat the Saracens, who were at sea with twenty-two gallies=
. These last were=20

defeated, and all on board put to death.  At this period also the king of H=
ungary wrote to the=20

university of Paris a letter, the contents of which were as follows. It was=
 addressed, =E2=80=98To the=20

learned, sage and prudent men, the rector and university of Paris, our love=
 and affection.=E2=80=99 Then=20

follows the letter. =E2=80=98Noble personages, and very renowned in science=
 throughout the world, we have=20

with pleasure received your epistle, full of sense and eloquence, which no =
doubt will be very=20

agreeable to our Lord and the Holy Spirit, and most profitable to all true =
Christians; for such is the=20

abomination at present existing in the church of God, that every sincere an=
d pious Christian=20

should offer up his prayers to God that out of his grace he would provide a=
 remedy, by which this=20

abomination, namely, the schism and division that has existed in the church=
 for thirty years may be=20

destroyed, and put to a final end by the re-union of the whole church.  =E2=
=80=98Should not this union be=20

speedily effected, it is to be feared, that from this double division three=
 others may spring up; and it=20

is on this account, and some others, we have sent our orator to that most C=
hristian prince the king=20

of France our lord, in order that the object of our legation to him may not=
 be frustrated by=20

unbelievers and others. We have requested of him by our ambassadors to send=
 us some one of=20

his noble race to aid and counsel us in our affairs, which we hope he will =
comply with, knowing=20



that, if he grants us this favour, we shall be alway ready, as heretofore, =
to serve him.=E2=80=94Given at=20

Rome, the 11th day of June, in the 22d year of our reign.=E2=80=99         =
                          CHAP. XLIII.=20

HOW ALL THE PRELATES AND CLERGY OF FRANCE WERE SUMMONED TO=20

PARIS.=E2=80=94THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN AND OF THE DUCHESS OF         ORLEA=
NS.   In=20

these days, the prelates and clergy, or their procurators, were summoned fr=
om the greater part of=20

France and Dauphiny to attend the king and his council, to give their opini=
ons respecting an union=20

of the church, and other matters touching the person of the king and his re=
alm.  They attended in=20

great numbers, and on the vigil of the feast of St Laurence assembled at ei=
ght o=E2=80=99clock in the=20

morning in the great hall of the palace. The chancellor of France presided =
for the king, who was=20

indisposed. When the mass of the Holy Ghost had been solemnly celebrated by=
 the archbishop of=20

Toulouse, a very renowned doctor in theology, of the order of Friars Preach=
ers, harangued notably=20

in the presence of the dukes of Orleans, of Berry, and many great lords, th=
e rector, the university,=20

and a large body of clergy.  He chose for his text, =E2=80=98Qu=C3=A6 pacis=
 sunt sectemur, et qu=C3=A6 =C3=A6dificationis=20

sunt invicem custodiamus,=E2=80=99 Rom. iv. c. That is to say, St Paul tell=
s the Romans, in the 4th chapter=20

of his epistle to them, to follow the things of peace, and be careful of wh=
at may bring edification.=20

The doctor harangued much respecting the union of the church, and uttered m=
any invectives=20

against Pietro della Luna, who, he said, from first to last, had opposed th=
is so-much-to-be-desired=20

union, and that he was a schismatic-heretic, obstinate in his wickedness.  =
He proved this by six=20

arguments; and after declaring that the king of France had formerly been ne=
uter, but had since=20

withdrawn himself from his obedience, on account of the letter and bull lat=
ely issued, which was=20

full of falsehoods and deceit, and highly offensive to the royal majesty, h=
e said that it was on this=20

account the assembly was held, that it might be notified to the members of =
it, for them to consider=20

the business, and on the means of obtaining a solid peace and re-union of t=
he church.  While=20

these things were passing, master Sausien and the messenger from Pietro del=
la Luna, who had=20

brought the letter and bull of excommunication to the king, both of them Ar=
ragonians, with mitres=20

on their heads, and having surcoats emblazoned with the arms of Pietro dell=
a Luna reversed, were=20

carried most disgracefully in a dung cart from the Louvre to the court of t=
he palace; and shortly=20

after, near the marble table, at the end of the steps, were set on a pillor=
y. They were thus=20

exhibited, for a very long time, to all who wished to see them, having labe=
ls on the mitres, on=20

which was written, =E2=80=98Disloyal traitors to the church and king.=E2=80=
=99  They were then carried back in the=20

aforesaid cart to the Louvre; and on the morrow the assembly met again at t=
he palace, when the=20

chancellor of France presided instead of the king.  A celebrated doctor in =
theology, called master=20

Ursin Talvande, a native of Normandy, harangued the assembly in the name of=
 the university of=20

Paris, and took his text from the hundredth Psalm, =E2=80=98Fiat pax in vir=
tute tua.=E2=80=99 He addressed himself to=20

the throne, and to the princes of the blood and other nobles there present,=
 exhorting them to=20

attempt every possible means to restore peace and union to be claimed that =
death would not have=20

occurred if the foot had been amputated, or, if the foot were amputated and=
 death followed, it may=20

be claimed that amputation was unnecessary and was the cause of death. The =
surgeon should,=20

therefore, be able to give the best reasons for every step of treatment.  A=
gain, it may be claimed=20

that DEATH was not a necessary result of the wound and WAS AVOIDABLE BUT FO=
R=20

IMPRUDENCE OR NEGLECT on the part of the wounded person. A man after being =
wounded=20

may refuse to receive medical assistance, or, after receiving it, may disob=
ey instructions or refuse=20



to submit to an operation proposed. Thus with a compound depressed fracture=
 of the skull the=20

patient may either refuse to see a surgeon, or he may refuse to submit to a=
n operation proposed,=20

or he may with or without operation disobey the instructions as to diet and=
 quiet, and eat or drink=20

heavily and refuse to go to bed. Such a case we can readily imagine might d=
ie of meningitis, etc.=20

If the symptoms of a wound are unfavorable from the start, or if the wound =
of itself is likely to prove=20

mortal, the responsibility of the assailant is unmitigated by imprudence or=
 neglect of medical=20

assistance by the wounded person. This is not allowed as mitigatory, as a s=
ane man is a free=20

agent and is not obliged to call in or submit to medical treatment. Moreove=
r, a medical witness in=20

many cases could not swear that an operation or other plan of treatment wou=
ld certainly save life.=20

Thus an amputation of the leg for wound of the foot causing tetanus is by n=
o means a certain=20

means of cure. But we can readily imagine a case where the refusal to submi=
t to the treatment=20

proposed might be an important element in causing death. Thus in a compound=
 depressed=20

fracture of the skull with compression, the medical witnesses would agree t=
hat the operation would=20

in all probability save life. This fact would probably be only mitigatory i=
n diminishing the penalty,=20

and, as stated above, would not secure acquittal. But it is none the less i=
mportant for the medical=20

witness to bear these facts in mind and bring out the facts and conclusions=
 clearly in his testimony.=20

DEATH FOLLOWING SLIGHT PERSONAL INJURIES.=E2=80=94Here again the claim migh=
t apparently=20

be justified that death was not necessarily due to the trifling injury. And=
 in reality there is commonly=20

some unhealthy state of the body to explain such an unexpected result. When=
 the disease=20

accounting for this unhealthy state of the body is in some other part than =
the injury, an=20

examination with ordinary care will explain the case. But if the disease an=
d injury are located in the=20

same part, especially in the head, the case is more perplexing, but may be =
cleared up by careful=20

and thorough examination. Also the usual results of such an injury should b=
e considered, and=20

whether the disease would be a usual result of the injury, or whether the s=
um total of the=20

pathological conditions found would be accounted for by the violence. It sh=
ould be remembered=20

that the presence of chronic disease is no excuse. Thus Taylor[633] cites t=
he case of Reg. _v._=20

Hapley (Lewes Aut. Ass., 1860), where a boy with chronic disease of the bra=
in suffered from no=20

unusual symptom until he received a severe flogging, which was followed by =
death in less than=20

three hours. The same author mentions also the following case to show that =
fatal results may=20

follow very slight and trivial blows. Annan[634] tells of a healthy four-ye=
ar-old girl who received a=20

slight blow from the shaft of a wheelbarrow on the skin about three inches =
below the knee. There=20

was even no external mark of violence, and the injury was thought to be so =
slight as not to require=20

treatment. There was pain, however, which increased on the following day, m=
arked constitutional=20

symptoms appeared, and the child died on the fourth day. Even to the punish=
ment inflicted by=20

schoolmasters death has been imputed.  When DEATH occurs FROM WOUNDS AFTER =
LONG=20

PERIODS the injury may be admitted, but it may be claimed that death was no=
t necessarily due to=20

the wound. Medically speaking, death is just as much the result of the inju=
ry as if it occurred on the=20

spot. Of course, death must be clearly traceable to the usual and probable =
results of the injury,=20

and not be dependent on any other cause. An examination of the wounded part=
 and of the whole=20

body will enable the medical witness to determine the cause of death and wh=
ether it is clearly=20

traceable to the injury. A doubt on this point may lead to acquittal. Certa=
in forms of wounds or=20

wounds in certain localities are especially liable to end fatally after a l=
ong delay, but as the direct=20



result of the wound. These are wounds of the head and of the spine. As to t=
he first class, the=20

injured person may apparently recover and be doing well, when he may sudden=
ly die from a=20

cerebral abscess, for instance. This is the result of the injury, but remai=
ns a longer or shorter time=20

latent. In wounds of the spine the patient is generally paralyzed below the=
 point of fracture, but is=20

apparently in good health. In a longer or shorter time he may die of a pneu=
monia, cystitis, or=20

bedsores, which are the known and regular consequences of the injury or inj=
ured condition. Astley=20

Cooper cites the case of a man who was injured on the head and died two yea=
rs later from the=20

effects of the injury, as was clearly made out by the continuance of brain =
symptoms during the=20

entire period. An interval of eleven years occurred in another head injury =
between the injury and=20

the fatal result. The first result of the injury was concussion of the brai=
n, and the case is mentioned=20

by Hoffbauer.[635] This long interval is unusual. There is a rule in Englis=
h law by which the=20

assailant cannot be indicted for murder if the victim of the assault lives =
a year and a day.=20

Practically this makes little difference, as nearly all cases would die wit=
hin that time; but the=20

principle is wrong as looked at from the medical standpoint. The protracted=
 cases concern, as=20

above stated, mostly injuries of the head, spine, and chest, among which th=
ere are some cases,=20

like the examples cited, where, according to English law, justice would fai=
l to be done.   III. WAS A=20

WOUND THE CAUSE OF DEATH SECONDARILY?  A wound is secondarily the cause of =
death=20

when the victim, having recovered from the first ill effects, dies from som=
e wound disease or=20

accident or from a surgical operation rendered necessary in the proper trea=
tment of the wound.=20

There may be much difficulty in establishing the proof of death from a woun=
d by means of=20

secondary causes, for, 1st, the secondary cause must be in the natural cour=
se of things; and, 2d,=20

there must be no other accidental circumstances to occasion the secondary c=
ause.  The=20

secondary cause may be partly due to the constitution of the deceased from =
habits of dissipation,=20

which fact would serve as an expiatory circumstance in the case. Among the =
secondary causes of=20

death may be mentioned septic=C3=A6mia, py=C3=A6mia, erysipelas, tetanus, g=
angrene, that is, wound=20

diseases, also the wound accident=E2=80=94as we may call delirium tremens, =
and surgical operations=20

rendered necessary to the treatment of the case. We may add, besides the re=
gular wound=20

diseases, inflammation in and about the wound, septic in character, perhaps=
 not justifying the title=20

of septic=C3=A6mia, but which, with its accompanying fever, may be the =E2=
=80=9Clast straw=E2=80=9D in a case which=20

might otherwise recover. Some of these secondary causes will now be conside=
red more at length.=20

SEPTIC=C3=86MIA is a general febrile disease due to the absorption into the=
 system from a wound of=20

the products of bacteria or due to the introduction into the blood and tiss=
ues of the bacteria=20

themselves. Depending on the two sources of origin, we have two forms of se=
ptic=C3=A6mia: 1. Septic=20

intoxication or sapremia, due to the absorption of a chemical poison, ptoma=
=C3=AFnes, and often readily=20

influenced and cured by the removal of the source of these ptoma=C3=AFnes i=
n decomposing blood-

clots, secretions, etc. 2. Septic infection comes on less rapidly but is mo=
re serious than the former=20

is, if properly and quickly treated, because the source of the trouble cann=
ot be removed, but is in=20

the blood and the tissues. The latter form is the more common one in wounds=
, though the former=20

may occur in abdominal wounds, especially when a blood-clot is present. The=
 first form begins=20

acutely, the second form more gradually. The infection in septic=C3=A6mia t=
akes place through a wound=20

and may be due to the weapon which caused the wound, the unclean condition =
of the parts=20

wounded, or to the subsequent treatment or want of treatment. It may even t=
ake place through the=20



intestinal mucous membrane as in cases of tyrotoxicon poisoning. It is most=
 likely to occur during=20

the first four or five days before the surfaces of the wound granulate, and=
 it consists in the=20

introduction of bacteria, especially staphylococci and streptococci. The di=
sease is characterized by=20

severe constitutional symptoms, acute continuous fever, inflammation of cer=
tain viscera and of the=20

wound, and nervous disorders. A pronounced chill ushering in the fever is g=
enerally absent.=20

Prostration is especially marked, the patient finally passing into a typhoi=
d condition indifferent to=20

surroundings. Anorexia and headache are usually present; diarrh=C5=93a is c=
ommon, vomiting is not.=20

The skin is pale and dusky, but not commonly icteric; at first it is hot an=
d dry, later moist and finally=20

cold and clammy. The spleen is often enlarged. The pulse becomes weak and r=
apid and delirium=20

is followed by coma. The prognosis is grave. Antiseptic treatment generally=
 prevents and often=20

cures the disease, as is the case with many other of the wound diseases; he=
nce the failure to=20

employ it may be alleged by the defence in mitigation of the responsibility=
 of the assailant for the=20

fatal result.  PY=C3=86MIA is closely allied to septic=C3=A6mia. It is due =
to the setting free of bacterial emboli=20

or septic emboli from a broken-down, septic thrombus in the neighborhood of=
 the wound, and the=20

circulation of these emboli in the blood until they are arrested and form t=
he characteristic=20

metastatic abscesses, especially in the lungs, joints, abdominal viscera, a=
nd parotid gland. Almost=20

always the source of infection is an infected wound. Granulation does not p=
revent the occurrence=20

of py=C3=A6mia, which, as a rule, commences at a later stage than septic=C3=
=A6mia. It is most important,=20

however, for our purpose to remember that there is such a thing as spontane=
ous py=C3=A6mia. An=20

injury not causing a wound may here be the exciting cause, but the resultin=
g py=C3=A6mia is an=20

unexpected consequence. A bruise of a bone, for instance, by allowing bacte=
ria, which in certain=20

conditions may be circulating in the blood, to find an exit from the vessel=
s into the bruised part,=20

may develop an acute osteo-myelitis, which may be a starting-point of a py=
=C3=A6mia. It is but proper to=20

state, however, that spontaneous py=C3=A6mia is a rare occurrence. In fact,=
 it is so rare that if py=C3=A6mia=20

occurs and we find ever so trifling an infected wound, we can safely attrib=
ute the py=C3=A6mia to the=20

wound and not to a spontaneous origin.  Py=C3=A6mia begins, as a rule, in t=
he second week of the=20

healing process or even later. It usually begins with a chill, which may be=
 frequently repeated. The=20

fever is very irregular and exacerbations occur with each metastatic absces=
s. The skin is icteric,=20

the icterus being hematogenous. The pulse is rapid and becomes weaker. Infe=
ctive endocarditis=20

may develop, which increases the danger of metastatic abscesses, which may =
then occur in the=20

brain. Otherwise the mind is clear and unaffected until the final delirium =
and coma. The disease=20

may become chronic, but usually lasts a week or ten days. The prognosis is =
very grave.=20

ERYSIPELAS is a still more frequent complication of medico-legal wounds, an=
d though not so=20

fatal as the two preceding, it is probably more often the secondary cause o=
f death on account of its=20

far greater frequence. It too is an acute infective inflammation due to the=
 presence of a micro-

organism, _streptococcus erysipelatis_. This occurs mostly in the lymphatic=
s of the skin, and=20

effects an entrance through some wound or abrasion of the skin or mucous me=
mbrane, which may=20

be almost microscopic in size. Probably there is no such thing as true _spo=
ntaneous erysipelas_,=20

though the wound may be often overlooked and only visible on the closest ex=
amination. If a wound=20

has been inflicted, the size and severity of it cannot be alleged as a reas=
on why it was not the=20

starting-point of an erysipelas. The erysipelas must be clearly traced to t=
he injury. That is, it must=20

occur before recovery from the wound or not later than a week after it has =
healed, for the=20



incubation is probably not longer than this. It is difficult to connect an =
erysipelas with a wound if it=20

occurs some time after it has healed or if it occurs at a different place a=
nd not about the wound.=20

Wounds of certain regions, as, for instance, scalp wounds, are especially l=
iable to develop=20

erysipelas, but this is probably owing to the imperfect antiseptic treatmen=
t or delay in applying it.=20

Certain individuals are more prone to it than others; thus it has been stat=
ed that blondes and those=20

suffering from Bright=E2=80=99s disease are more susceptible, though how tr=
ue this is it is hard to say. It is=20

also probably more prevalent at certain times of the year, particularly in =
the spring. A wound after it=20

has scabbed over or has begun to granulate, that is, after the first four o=
r five days, is very much=20

less apt to serve as the avenue for infection. Erysipelas usually begins wi=
th a chill, or a convulsion=20

in children. Nausea and vomiting are the rule. The fever is remittent and r=
anges from 102=C2=B0 to 104=C2=B0=20

F., and the temperature may be subnormal when the inflammation is subsiding=
. Prostration is=20

marked and the pulse more or less weak. There may be delirium while the fev=
er is high. Locally=20

there is rarely anything characteristic until twenty-four hours or so after=
 the chill. Then we have a=20

reddish blush with some tension, burning and itching of the skin. At first =
the redness is most=20

marked about the wound, later at the edge of the advancing, serpentine marg=
in. It spreads widely=20

and rapidly, and after three or four days the part first attacked begins to=
 improve. Desquamation=20

follows. The duration may be a week or ten days or as long as a month. The =
inflammation may be=20

much more severe, involving the subcutaneous connective tissue in _phlegmon=
ous erysipelas_.=20

FACIAL ERYSIPELAS is a common variety and was once regarded as idiopathic, =
but a wound on=20

the skin or mucous membrane is probably always present. The prognosis of er=
ysipelas is usually=20

favorable. Since the use of antiseptics it is far less common than formerly=
, though still the most=20

common of the infective wound diseases.  If a man wounded in an assault is =
taken to a hospital=20

where erysipelas prevails, the question of responsibility arises, for, medi=
cally speaking, he is=20

subjected to great and avoidable risks.  TETANUS is an infective bacterial =
disease affecting chiefly=20

the central nervous system and almost always, if not always, originating fr=
om a wound. Tetanus,=20

like erysipelas, is probably always traumatic and never strictly idiopathic=
. The wound may be so=20

slight as to escape notice. When it follows such injuries as simple fractur=
e internal infection=20

probably occurs, though such cases are extremely rare. It is said that the =
weather influences the=20

development of tetanus, and that it is more common in the tropics. There ar=
e also certain=20


_
end to the dangerous schism,=E2=80=94proving to them the wickedness of Piet=
ro della Luna, that he was=20

an incorrigible heretic, and ought not to be styled pope Benedict, nor enjo=
y the dignity of cardinal=20

or any other,=E2=80=94and that they were not bound to obey him, and indeed =
could not without incurring=20

the penalties due to favourers of heresy and schismatics.  He brought forwa=
rd many examples of=20

former popes, which were favourable to his arguments, and the determination=
 of the last council,=20

when it had been resolved, that if Pietro della Luna and his adversary did =
not establish peace=20

within the church before Ascension-day, as they had promised, the kingdom o=
f France in general,=20

and the inhabitants of Dauphiny would withdraw themselves from his obedienc=
e; for such had=20

been the conclusion of the prelates who had attended this council, as was a=
pparent from their=20

letters to the university of Paris,=E2=80=94in consequence of which the afo=
resaid obedience had been=20

withdrawn by order of the king of France, until one properly-elected head o=
f the church should be=20

chosen. The doctor then proposed the means for granting dispensations and c=
ollations to=20

benefices in the interim, as well for Dauphiny as for France, and also othe=
r measures proper to be=20

taken during this neutrality.  It was at length concluded, that no one shou=
ld obey either of the=20

popes after a certain day, under pain of suffering the before mentioned pen=
alties, and without=20

incurring the indignation of the king. The doctor insisted, that the bull o=
f excommunication, and=20

some letters which had been brought from Toulouse, should be publicly destr=
oyed, which was=20

done.  The prelates and clergy were then ordered to proclaim their neutrali=
ty throughout their=20

dioceses and parishes, and different documents were given them by the unive=
rsity to teach them=20

how they were to govern themselves respecting the several points of this ne=
utrality. When this had=20

been done, every one retired to his home.  On the morrow, the two Arragonia=
ns were again=20

carried through Paris, and pilloried, in the same manner as before. The que=
en, who had remained=20

some time at Melun, returned to Paris with her son the dauphin. He was moun=
ted on a white horse=20

led by four footmen, and followed the car of the queen. The dukes of Berry,=
 of Brittany and=20

Bourbon, the counts de Mortaign, de Clermont, de Vend=C3=B4me, and a numero=
us train of nobles, as=20

well churchmen as seculars, and esquires followed the dauphin. Great rejoic=
ings were made on=20

their return by the Parisians, and carols were sung in many of the streets.=
  The queen, the=20

dauphin, and the lord Louis of Bavaria her brother, took up their lodgings =
in the castle of the=20

Louvre. On the morrow, the duchess-dowager of Orleans came likewise to Pari=
s with her=20

daughter-in-law Isabella, eldest daughter to the king of France, accompanie=
d by many noble=20

persons, knights and others, dressed in mourning. All the before-mentioned =
princes went out of=20

Paris to meet them, and conducted them to the queen and the duke of Acquita=
ine, to request of=20

them justice and reparation for the melancholy death of the late duke of Or=
leans, and also=20

permission to make a reply to charges which John duke of Burgundy had publi=
cly brought against=20

her late lord and husband the deceased duke of Orleans,=E2=80=94which last =
request she at length=20

obtained.                                   CHAP. XLIV.      THE DUCHESS-DO=
WAGER OF ORLEANS AND=20

HER SON CAUSE A PUBLIC         ANSWER TO BE MADE, AT PARIS, TO THE CHARGES =
OF=20

THE DUKE         OF BURGUNDY AGAINST THE LATE DUKE OF ORLEANS, AND=20

CHALLENGE THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR HIS MURDER.   Eight days after, the duke=
 of=20

Orleans, attended by about three hundred men at arms, came to Paris. He was=
 met by the duke of=20

Berry and other great lords, his relations, without the gate of St Antoine,=
 and went to wait on the=20

queen and the duke of Acquitaine, his cousin-german, at the castle of the L=
ouvre.  Having strongly=20



recommended his cause to them, he took leave and hastened to visit the duch=
ess his mother, and=20

his wife. They were incessant in their petitions to the king and council to=
 do them justice on John=20

duke of Burgundy and his accomplices for the murder of the duke of Orleans,=
 and obtained leave=20

to make any reply they might please against the duke of Burgundy.  In conse=
quence, the duke of=20

Acquitaine, as representative of his father, and the queen, both dressed in=
 royal robes, went, by=20

command of the king, to the great hall of the Louvre, where were present th=
e dukes of Berry, of=20

Brittany, of Bourbon, the counts d=E2=80=99Alen=C3=A7on, de Clermont, de Mo=
rtaign, de Vend=C3=B4me, and many=20

more lords of the council; with numbers of knights, the rector of the unive=
rsity of Paris, and great=20

crowds of common people. The duchess-dowager, attended by her son the duke =
of Orleans,=20

master Pierre l=E2=80=99Orfevre, his chancellor, master Pierre Cousinet, ad=
vocate in parliament, and by a=20

large train of friends and familiars, entered the hall. She then caused to =
be read aloud by the abbot=20

of Saint Fiacre, of the order of St Benedict, the contents of a book, writt=
en in French, which she=20

gave to him publicly, and which were confirmed by quotations from the writi=
ngs of the prophets, in=20

both the Old and New Testaments, as well as from those of philosophers and =
historians. The=20

contents of the book were as follows.  =E2=80=98Most Christian king, most n=
oble and sovereign prince, and=20

fountain of justice, to thee do I address my speech; for thou art competent=
 to display justice to all=20

thy subjects of the realm of France, inasmuch as not only the neighbouring,=
 but even the most=20

distant nations may take example from the conscientiousness of thy judgment=
s, which flow from=20

thee and thy council, as from the fountains of justice and truth. I address=
 myself to thee in the=20

names of my highly honoured and most noble lady the duchess of Orleans and =
of my lords her=20

children, who in their deplorable state present to thee their complaints wi=
th lamentations and tears,=20

seeing that after God there can be no relief but in thy pity and compassion=
.  =E2=80=98That what I have to=20

say may not have the smallest appearance of fallacy, but may be perfectly c=
lear, I shall divide my=20

discourse into three parts, or principal divisions. In the first, I shall s=
how, to the utmost of my=20

ability, that kings, as sovereigns, are bounden to do justice to all their =
subjects, and to maintain=20

peace within their realms.  =E2=80=98Secondly, That our adversary, John duk=
e of Burgundy, and his=20

abettors, have, by counsel and otherwise, been instrumental in unjustly and=
 disgracefully=20

murdering the late duke of Orleans, whose soul may God receive!  =E2=80=98T=
hirdly, That my aforesaid=20

lord, the late duke of Orleans, has been wickedly and unjustly accused of s=
everal crimes of high=20

treason of which he has been no way guilty, as shall appear hereafter.  =E2=
=80=98It is, beside, my intention=20

to divide these three points into six other divisions: thus, therefore, my =
discourse will consist of=20

eighteen divisions.  =E2=80=98In regard to the first point, it appears very=
 clear to me, that the king is=20

singularly obliged to do justice in this case, and especially for six reaso=
ns. The first of which=20

constrains him to do justice from the consideration of his power and dignit=
y, which not only binds=20

him to do it of his own will, but as matter of right from his title of offi=
ce; for kings are so called on=20

account of doing justice, and not for anything else.  =E2=80=98The second r=
eason is founded on his paternal=20

love,=E2=80=94for, as the common proverb says, =E2=80=98Nature cannot belie=
 herself:=E2=80=99 the king, therefore, as=20

sovereign and brother, is bound from reason and justice to support his righ=
t.  =E2=80=98Thirdly, From the=20

melancholy state of my lady of Orleans, now reduced to widowhood and despai=
r, who with her=20

disconsolate young children, and many knights, are overwhelmed with grief b=
y the cruel death of=20

her lord and husband.  =E2=80=98The fourth reason is, The enormity of the c=
rime, which can scarcely have=20

its parallel found; for all who have heard of this scandalous deed have tho=
ught it abominable, and=20



have declared, that if the king did not provide a remedy for it, he could n=
ot be considered as=20

sovereign of his kingdom when he is thus forced to humiliate himself before=
 his subjects.  =E2=80=98Fifthly,=20

If this crime be not punished, innumerable evils will ensue,=E2=80=94such a=
s the destruction of cities and=20

towns, murders, and rebellion of subjects.  =E2=80=98Sixthly, The wickednes=
s of our enemy, who by force of=20

arms seeks to maintain his crime, and who pleads his cause with a drawn swo=
rd in his hand. And=20

in these six reasons consist the grounds of our proceedings.  =E2=80=98With=
 respect to my second point, I=20

will demonstrate by six reasons, that our adverse party has so greatly sinn=
ed that it is impossible=20

for any reparation to make amends.  =E2=80=98My first reason is, That our o=
pponent had no authority=20

whatever for murdering so great and so noble a person as the late duke of O=
rleans.  =E2=80=98Secondly,=20

That he followed no forms of law or justice in putting my late lord to such=
 a death; and even=20

supposing that he had any authority over him, which was not the case, it wa=
s illegal to put him to=20

death without hearing what he might have to say in his own defence; and see=
ing that he had not=20

any authority, his crime will appear so much the deeper.  =E2=80=98Thirdly,=
 From the alliances formed=20

between these two dukes, I do not mean those of blood, but the engagements =
mutually entered=20

into, to avoid the inconveniences that might arise from their quarrels, by =
which they were bounden=20

not to annoy or attack each other without having sent a previous challenge.=
 In confirmation of this,=20

they had several times sworn to the same on the holy Scriptures, and on the=
 cross of our Lord,=20

giving to each other letters signed with their seals.  =E2=80=98Fourthly, T=
he death of my said lord of Orleans=20

was so sudden that no true Christian can say it was not damnable to those w=
ho committed the=20

crime, as well as to those who had commanded it.  =E2=80=98Fifthly, I shall=
 demonstrate clearly, that our=20

opponent did not cause the late duke of Orleans to be murdered for any good=
 purpose, nor for the=20

public welfare, but solely through ambition and covetousness, from a lust o=
f power, and in order to=20

make his dependants rich, and from the great hatred that had been long fost=
ered at his heart.=20

=E2=80=98Sixthly, That the death of the late duke of Orleans was not suffic=
ient for our adversary, but that he=20

has exerted himself to the utmost to blast and scandalize his memory by def=
amatory libels, and by=20

supporting traitors and murderers. This regards the second part of my disco=
urse.  =E2=80=98In respect to my=20

third point, I shall produce six arguments, in opposition to the six false =
accusations brought by our=20

adversary against the late duke of Orleans, and which shall clearly prove t=
he innocence of the=20

defunct. Such will be my third division.  =E2=80=98I have thus shown you my=
 three divisions. The first=20

regards justice,=E2=80=94the second declares the malice of our adversaries,=
=E2=80=94and the third exonerates the=20

late duke of Orleans from the false charges brought against him. Before I p=
roceed further, I must=20

here solemnly declare, that I intend not to say any thing but the exact tru=
th, or to advance more=20

than has been enjoined me by my foresaid lady of Orleans, and my lords her =
children.  =E2=80=98It is true,=20

indeed, that the defender of our adversary has very unadvisedly called my l=
ate lord of Orleans=20

criminal, although he has no way proven it; nevertheless I shall not use th=
is expression in=20

speaking of our adversary, though I repute all murderers criminal, and him =
in particular, not from=20

any suspicion, but from the confession made by himself; and as wisdom conqu=
ers malice,=20

according to the holy Scriptures, it will be sufficient for me to name the =
adverse party, the party of=20

Burgundy; for it will be better that I first demonstrate the crimes, and th=
en show the duke of=20

Burgundy guilty of them, than to follow his example, and call him criminal =
without any proof or=20

verification. I shall now, having divided my subject into three divisions, =
enter on my first point,=20

which treats of the justice of the king, and quote the words of the prophet=
 which say, =E2=80=98Justitia et=20



judicium pr=C3=A6paratio sedis tu=C3=A6.=E2=80=99 These words are in the lx=
xviiith Psalm, and declare to the king that=20

his throne is founded on justice and judgment. I shall quote in regard to m=
y second division, which=20

relates to the malice of our adversary, the very words his defender made us=
e of, namely, =E2=80=98Radix=20

omnium malorum cupiditas, quam quidem appetentes erraverunt a fide.=E2=80=
=99 These words are taken=20

from the first epistle of St Paul to Timothy, in the last chapter, and whic=
h mean, That covetousness=20

is the root of all evil, and causes a defalcation from the faith.  =E2=80=
=98In regard to my third division,=20

respecting the innocence of the late duke of Orleans, I shall use the words=
 of the Psalmist in the=20

seventh Psalm, =E2=80=98Judica me secundum justitiam tuam et secundum innoc=
entiam meam super me;=E2=80=99=20

that is to say, Do me right according to thy justice, and judge me accordin=
g to my innocence.  =E2=80=98I=20

shall now return to my first point, and repeat the words of the Psalmist, =
=E2=80=98Justitia et judicium=20

pr=C3=A6paratio sedis tua.=E2=80=99 This expression I may address personall=
y to the king our lord, in saying,=20

=E2=80=98Justice and judgment are the foundations of thy royal throne;=E2=
=80=99 for royalty without justice is=20

undeserving of the name, and should be called a robbery according to St Aus=
tin, in the 10th=20

chapter of his 9th book, =E2=80=98De Civitate Dei:=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98Regna,=
 inquit, remota a justitia, quid sint nisi magna=20

latrocinia.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98It appears, therefore, that the king is boun=
d to do justice to all his subjects, and to=20

preserve to every one his right, and that for the six reasons touched upon =
at the beginning of my=20

speech,=E2=80=94my first reason being founded on the regard due to the roya=
l dignity, which dignity has=20

been instituted principally in order to do justice, the king being truly, i=
n respect to his subjects,=20

what a shepherd is to his flock, as Aristotle says in his 8th chapter of et=
hics, or in the 5th of his=20

politics, on the government of cities; and it is also declared, in his book=
 on the ruling of princes,=20

that they are bounden to preserve justice.  =E2=80=98=E2=80=98Justitia inqu=
it regnantis utilior est subditis quam=20

fertilitas ipsius;=E2=80=99 which means, That the justice of the governing =
powers is more advantageous to=20

the subject than fertility or riches. The Psalmist, on this matter, says, =
=E2=80=98Honor inquit regis judicium=20

diligit;=E2=80=99 that is, The honour of the king loves justice and judgmen=
t. The justice here spoken of is=20

nothing else than to preserve to every one his right, which is also declare=
d by the emperor=20

Justinian, in the first book of his Constitutions.  =E2=80=98=E2=80=98Justi=
tia est constans voluntas unicuique jus suum=20

tribuens,=E2=80=99 meaning, That justice is firm and stable, giving to ever=
y one his due; and it should be=20

considered that justice is not to be administered according to pleasure, bu=
t as the written laws=20

prescribe. Weigh well, therefore, how much you are bounden to do justice.  =
=E2=80=98To you, then, my lady=20

of Orleans and her children address themselves, requiring from you justice,=
 which is the brightest=20

jewel in your crown. Recollect the numerous examples of kings, your predece=
ssors, who so much=20

loved justice, and particularly that bright instance of a king, who seeing =
that his son had deserved,=20

by the laws of that time, to lose both his eyes, ordered one of his eyes to=
 be put out, and had at=20

the same time one of his own destroyed, that the law might not be violated =
nor infringed.  =E2=80=98Valerius=20

also mentions, in his 6th book, a king called Cambyses, who commanded a fal=
se judge to be=20

flayed, and his skin to be placed on the judge=E2=80=99s seat, and then ord=
ered the son of the late judge to=20

sit on the skin of his father, telling him, =E2=80=98When thou judgest any =
cause, let what I have done to thy=20

father be an example to thee; and let his skin, forming thy seat, always ke=
ep thee in=20

remembrance.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98O, king of France! thou rememberest what Da=
vid said, when king Saul unjustly=20

persecuted him, =E2=80=98Dominus inquit retribuet unicuique secundum justit=
iam tuam;=E2=80=99 that is to say, The=20

Lord God will repay every one according to his justice. These words are wri=
tten in the second=20

chapter of the first book of Kings.  =E2=80=98Thou oughtest, therefore, lik=
e a true follower of our lord, to do in=20



like manner according to thy power, and aid and support such as have been u=
njustly wounded and=20

persecuted. Thou canst not have forgotten, how Andronicus, a cruel murderer=
, was condemned to=20

death on the spot where he had slain the high priest, as it is written in t=
he book of Machabees.  =E2=80=98O,=20

king of France! take example from king Darius, who caused those that had fa=
lsely accused the=20

prophet Daniel to be thrown into the lion=E2=80=99s den to be devoured. Rec=
ollect the justice that was=20

executed on the two elders who, from false charges, had accused and condemn=
ed Susanna.=20

These examples are written in the sixth and fourteenth chapters of the book=
 of Daniel the prophet,=20

and ought to stimulate thee to do justice as king and sovereign,=E2=80=94fo=
r it is in doing thus that thy=20

subjects will be obedient to thee, and in such wise art thou bound to do th=
em justice, and which=20

will cause them to be highly criminal when disobedient to thee.  =E2=80=98S=
ome indeed have doubted=20

whether the subject may not withdraw his allegiance from the sovereign on a=
 refusal of justice and=20

equity. May it please thee, therefore, sire, to consider this well, for tho=
u wilt not have any thing to=20

fear in doing justice, as I shall hereafter demonstrate; and in conclusion =
of this my first reason, I=20

shall quote the words of the third chapter of Job: =E2=80=98Cum justitia in=
dutus sum, et vestivi me=20

vestimento et diademate in coronatione mea;=E2=80=99 that is to say, I am c=
lothed with justice, and have=20

invested myself with it, as the robe and diadem of my coronation.  =E2=80=
=98Consequently, most noble=20

prince, I say that fraternal love ought greatly to urge thee to do justice;=
 for I do not believe that=20

greater love ever existed between two brothers than what you both felt. Be =
then the true friend to=20

thy brother in justice and judgment; for it will be the greatest disgrace t=
o thee and to the crown of=20

France, throughout the world, if justice and reparation be not made for the=
 infamous and cruel=20

murder of thy brother. It is now time for thee to show thy brotherly affect=
ion; and be not like to=20

those friends spoken of by the wise man, in the 8th chapter of Ecclesiastic=
us, as follows: =E2=80=98Est=20

amicus socius mens=C3=A6 et non permanebit in die necessitatis.=E2=80=99 Th=
at is, There are friends who are=20

companions at table, and in prosperity, but who are no longer such in the d=
ay of adversity.  =E2=80=98At this=20

moment, necessity and affection united call upon thee to prove thyself such=
 a friend that the world=20

may not call thee a faint hearted friend, of whom Aristotle speaks, in his =
9th chapter of ethics: =E2=80=98Qui,=20

inquit, fingit se esse amicum, et non est; pejor est eo qui facit falsam mo=
netam.=E2=80=99 A faint friend is=20

worse than a coiner of base money. Should some tell thee, that our opponent=
 is of thy blood, and=20

thy relation, thou oughtest, nevertheless, to abominate his crime, and do s=
trict justice between two=20

friends, according to what Aristotle says, in his second book of ethics: =
=E2=80=98Duobus existentibus=20

amicis, sanctum est pr=C3=A6honorare virtutem.=E2=80=99=E2=80=94That is, It=
 is praiseworthy to give the preference to=20

virtue between two friends.  =E2=80=98Thou rememberest the strong love that=
 subsisted between thee and=20

thy brother; not that I wish to obtain any favour by that remembrance, but =
solely to exhort thee to=20

justice and truth. Alas! it would be of little value the being son or broth=
er to a king, if such a cruel=20

murder were passed over without tetanus is much more common than elsewhere =
and where it=20

may be said to be almost endemic. Punctured wounds are most likely to be fo=
llowed by tetanus,=20

for they offer the best opportunity for the development of the bacteria, wh=
ich are ana=C3=ABrobic.=20

Wounds in dirty parts of the body, like the hands and feet, are more apt to=
 be followed by tetanus=20

than those elsewhere. Tetanus usually appears about the end of the first we=
ek after a wound has=20

been received, but it may not appear for a longer period, even three or fou=
r weeks, so that the=20

wound may have been some time healed. To connect tetanus with a particular =
wound, note (1) if=20

there were any symptoms of it before the wound or injury, (2) whether any o=
ther cause intervened=20



after the wound or injury which would be likely to produce it, and (3) whet=
her the deceased ever=20

rallied from the effects of the injury. Tetanus comes on suddenly without w=
arning. The injured=20

person first notices that he cannot fully open the mouth, he has lock-jaw, =
and the back of the neck=20

is stiff. The muscles of the abdomen and back are next involved so that the=
 back is arched in the=20

position known as _opisthotonos_, and the abdomen presents a board-like har=
dness. The muscles=20

of the fauces, pharynx, and diaphragm may next become involved, causing dif=
ficulty in swallowing=20

and breathing. The thighs may or may not be involved, but the arms and legs=
 almost never. Owing=20

to the spasm of the abdominal muscles, micturition and defecation are diffi=
cult and respiration is=20

hindered. The muscles are in the condition of tonic spasm which permits the=
 patient no rest, the=20

face bears the =E2=80=9Crisus sardonicus,=E2=80=9D and the suffering is ext=
reme. If the patient lives more than two or=20

three days the tonic spasm partly gives way to increased reflex irritabilit=
y, in which a noise, jar, or=20

draught of air may give rise to clonic and tonic spasms in the muscles affe=
cted. The patient may=20

die at such times from tonic spasm of the respiratory muscles, or he may di=
e of prostration from=20

want of food and sleep, worn out by the suffering and muscular spasm. The m=
ind is usually clear=20

to the last. Fever is not characteristic of the disease. Tetanus may be rap=
idly fatal; in two or three=20

days, or it may be or become more chronic. The _prognosis_ of acute tetanus=
 is almost invariably=20

fatal; that of chronic tetanus is grave, but a certain proportion of cases =
recover.=20

_Diagnosis._=E2=80=94This is easy. It differs from a true neuritis in the p=
eripheral nerves in that no matter=20

where the wound is situated the first symptom is in the muscles of the jaw =
and the back of the=20

neck, and not at the site of the injury and distally from this point. _Tris=
mus_ is applied to a milder=20

form of the disease in which only the face and neck muscles are involved an=
d =E2=80=9Clock-jaw=E2=80=9D is a=20

prominent symptom. Some cases of _tetany_ may be mistaken for so-called spo=
ntaneous tetanus.=20

Tetany may follow child-bed, fevers, mental shocks, exposure to cold and we=
t, extirpation of=20

goitre, intestinal irritation, etc. It consists of painful tonic spasms of =
the muscles of the arms and=20

feet. The attacks last one-half to two hours or more, and may be preceded b=
y a dragging pain.=20

They may be brought on by pressure on the nerve leading to the muscles affe=
cted. Striking the=20

facial nerve often causes contraction of the face muscles. There is no tris=
mus but there may be=20

opisthotonos. The patient seems well between the attacks and most cases rec=
over without=20

treatment.  DELIRIUM TREMENS may occur as a secondary consequence of injuri=
es, or=20

necessary surgical operations in the case of those who are habitually intem=
perate. Those who=20

habitually use opium, tobacco, cannabis indica, or even tea or coffee to ex=
cess are said to be=20

subject to it. It may, therefore, be justly alleged that death is avoidable=
 in very many cases, but for=20

an abnormal and unhealthy state of the body. The disease is characterized b=
y delirium, a peculiar=20

tremor of the muscles, insomnia, and anorexia. Pneumonia may complicate the=
 case. The patients=20

die in fatal cases from exhaustion due to insomnia, lack of nourishment, an=
d their constant activity=20

of body and mind. The prognosis is usually favorable, taking all cases toge=
ther, but in delirium=20

tremens secondary to surgical injuries or operations the prognosis is serio=
us.  DEATH FROM=20

SURGICAL OPERATIONS performed for the treatment of wounds. The operation is=
 a part of the=20

treatment, and if it is done with ordinary care and skill the accused is re=
sponsible for the result.=20

The necessity and mode of operation must be left to the operator=E2=80=99s =
judgment. As the defence may=20

turn on the necessity for and the skilful performance of the operation, it =
is well to wait for the=20

advice and assistance of others if practicable, for death is not unusual fr=
om severe operations.=20



The patient may die on the operating-table after losing little blood, from =
fear, pain, or shock. Or he=20

may die from secondary hemorrhage or any of the secondary causes of death f=
rom wounds=20

enumerated above. The evidence of the necessity of the operation must, ther=
efore, be presented=20

by the operator. If an operation is necessary and not performed, the defenc=
e might allege that=20

death was due to the neglect of the surgeon. Another question for the medic=
al witnesses to=20

determine is whether the operation was rendered necessary because of improp=
er previous=20

treatment, for if it was the responsibility of the assailant may be influen=
ced. The meaning of the=20

term =E2=80=9Cnecessity=E2=80=9D is here a matter of importance. Unless an =
operation is necessary to the=20

preservation of life, if death occurs there is some doubt whether the assai=
lant is responsible. But,=20

medically speaking, we would not hesitate to urge an operation on a wounded=
 man in order to=20

preserve function, or even to save deformity as well as to save life. In th=
e case of operations done=20

under a mistaken opinion, neither necessary to save life nor, as the result=
 proves, to save function=20

or guard against deformity, if death follows the assailant may be relieved =
from responsibility. Thus=20

an aneurism following an injury might be mistaken for an abscess and opened=
 with skill but with a=20

fatal result. It is also for the medical experts to determine whether an op=
eration was unnecessary=20

or unskilfully performed, for if it were and death resulted from it, the re=
sponsibility of the prisoner is=20

affected unless the original wound would be likely to be fatal without oper=
ation. According to Lord=20

Hale, if death results from an unskilful operation and not from the wound, =
the prisoner is not=20

responsible. But yet death may occur as the result of the most skilful oper=
ation necessary to the=20

treatment of a wound, and not be dependent at all on the wound itself. If t=
he operation is skilfully=20

performed, and yet the patient dies from secondary causes, such as those ab=
ove enumerated or=20

any others, the prisoner is still responsible, and the medical testimony is=
 concerned with the=20

performance of the operation and the secondary causes of death. The relativ=
e skill of the operator=20

or surgeon is probably not a question for the jury in criminal cases, on th=
e ground that the man=20

who inflicts the injury must take all the consequences, good or bad. In a c=
ivil suit, for instance an=20

action for malpractice, the case is otherwise, and all the medical facts an=
d opinions are submitted=20

to the jury. The law regards three circumstances in death after surgical op=
erations: (1) The=20

necessity of the operation, (2) the competence of the operator, and (3) whe=
ther the wound would=20

be fatal without operation.  _Death_ may occur _from an=C3=A6sthetics_ used=
 in an operation without=20

any recognizable contributing disease of the patient, or carelessness or la=
ck of skill in the=20

administration of the an=C3=A6sthetic. Of course, the question of absence o=
f contributing disease on the=20

part of the patient and of its proper administration must be satisfactorily=
 answered in cases of=20

death from the an=C3=A6sthetic in an operation rendered necessary in the tr=
eatment of a wound. Death=20

from an an=C3=A6sthetic may occur before, during, or after an operation its=
elf. Medically speaking, the=20

necessity of the use of an an=C3=A6sthetic in operations cannot be question=
ed, and in emergencies=20

where an operation becomes necessary, and not a matter of choice, its use, =
with special care, is=20

justifiable even with existing organic disease, which usually contraindicat=
es it. As death may be=20

alleged to be due to the use of a particular an=C3=A6sthetic, it is always =
best in operating on account of=20

an injury which may require a medico-legal investigation, to use that an=C3=
=A6sthetic which is most=20

generally used and indorsed in the particular section of country in questio=
n. Of course, it is not=20

lawful to operate against the will of a person who preserves consciousness =
and will. It may be=20

added in this connection that if a medical man be guilty of misconduct, ari=
sing either from gross=20



ignorance or criminal inattention, whereby the patient dies, he is guilty o=
f manslaughter, according=20

to Lord Ellenborough. Omissions or errors in judgment, to which all are lia=
ble, are not criminal.   IV.=20

WAS THE WOUND MADE BY THE INSTRUMENT DESCRIBED?  It is not often necessary =
to=20

prove that a weapon was used, though it may affect the punishment. For the =
use of a weapon=20

implies malice and intention and a greater desire to do injury. The prisone=
r may swear that no=20

weapon was used when the nature of the wound clearly proves that one was us=
ed. The=20

explanation of the prisoner of the origin of the wound may thus be discredi=
ted. We cannot often=20

swear that a particular weapon was used, but only that the wound was made b=
y one similar to it in=20

shape and size. Thus Schw=C3=B6rer tells of the case of a man stabbed in th=
e face by another. The=20

medical witness testified that the wound was caused by a knife shown at the=
 trial which had a=20

whole blade, but a year later the point of the knife which had really cause=
d the wound was=20

discharged from an abscess in the cheek at the site of the wound. The surge=
on thus made a too=20

definite statement in regard to the knife shown.  It is often very difficul=
t to answer the above=20

question. We base our opinion chiefly on two sources: 1st, and most importa=
nt, by an examination=20

of the wound, and, 2d, by an examination of the instrument said to have bee=
n used. Certain=20

particulars of the wound may furnish indications as to the weight, form, an=
d sharpness of the=20

instrument used. There are certain wounds which must have been made by an i=
nstrument,=20

namely, incised and punctured wounds. The above question is determined more=
 or less by what=20

has been said in a former section on wounds, but we will now consider what =
special features of=20

these and other classes of wounds indicate the nature, shape, size, etc., o=
f the weapon used.=20

=3DIncised wounds=3D must be made by a cutting instrument. We would here ex=
clude those contused=20

wounds of the scalp and eyebrows which closely resemble incised wounds, but=
 we have already=20

seen that we can diagnose between these wounds and incised wounds by carefu=
l inspection. But=20

the locality should put us on our guard, so that in case of wounds of these=
 two regions we should=20

be especially careful in making the examination.  In the case of incised wo=
unds we cannot often=20

tell the shape or size of the weapon, but we are able to tell certain chara=
cteristics about it. _The=20

sharpness_ of the instrument may be inferred from the clean and regular edg=
es. The depth of the=20

wound may also indicate the sharpness of the weapon. A long =E2=80=9Ctail=
=E2=80=9D in the wound indicates that the=20

weapon was sharp as well as that this was the part of the wound last made. =
If the edges of the=20

wound are rough, we may infer that the edges of the weapon were rough and i=
rregular. Wounds=20

caused by bits of china or glass or fragments of bottles, besides having ro=
ugh and lacerated=20

edges, are characterized by an irregular or angular course in the skin.  So=
me cutting weapons, like=20

an axe, act as much by means of their weight as by their cutting edges. Wou=
nds caused by such=20

weapons we can often distinguish by the following signs: The edges are not =
as smooth as is the=20

case with a cutting instrument, and they may be more or less lacerated and =
show signs of=20

contusion. The wound is often deep in comparison with its length, and the e=
nds of the wound=20

abrupt instead of slanting up from the bottom to the surface. The section o=
f resisting organs and=20

the impression of the edge of the weapon on the bone are further signs of t=
he use of such a=20

weapon.  The form and direction of a wound may possibly give some indicatio=
n of the form of the=20

instrument=E2=80=94for instance, whether it be straight or curved like a pr=
uning-knife, as in the case cited=20

by Vibert[636] of a wound of the neck which suddenly became deeper toward i=
ts extremity and=20

changed its direction; the whole being explained on the supposition that it=
 was made by a pruning-



knife.  But it is in =3Dpunctured wounds=3D especially that we are enabled =
most often and most=20

accurately to determine the kind of a weapon used. Here from the form of th=
e wound we may=20

judge of the form and size of the weapon. In speaking of punctured wounds i=
n a former section we=20

divided them into four groups, reference to which may here be made. In the =
first group, or those=20

caused by cylindrical or conical weapons, when the weapon is very fine it m=
ay leave no track at=20

all; if a little larger, we may infer from a linear bloody track that the w=
eapon was needle-like in=20

shape. The length of the instrument or the depth to which it penetrated may=
 be found, as a rule,=20

only by dissection. If the weapon were larger and conical, we have seen tha=
t the wounds would be=20

linear with two angles, the length of the wound being parallel to the direc=
tion of the fibres in the=20

skin.  Here we may judge of the form of the weapon from the following circu=
mstances: From a=20

comparison of the depth with the size of the opening, we know that it was a=
 punctured wound. The=20

edges and angles are not smooth and even enough for a stab-wound with a kni=
fe, for the edges=20

are torn and not cut, and a stab-wound would be the only form of wound with=
 which we would be=20

likely to confuse it. Furthermore, the direction of the long axis of the wo=
und parallel to that of the=20

skin fibres in the region in which it occurs and the very slight retraction=
 of the edges distinguish it=20

from a stab-wound. By these signs we can almost always distinguish such wou=
nds from stab-

wounds, and thus tell the form of the weapon used. As to the size of weapon=
 used, these wounds=20

if of any size are generally smaller than the weapon, for the skin is put o=
n the stretch by the=20

weapon and yields to a certain extent. The actual wound, therefore, is smal=
ler in circumference=20

than the weapon. The size of the wound is smaller than that part of the wea=
pon occupying the=20

wound when the weapon was arrested; it may be very much smaller than the we=
apon at its largest=20

point. Small wounds of this kind are generally larger than the instrument p=
roducing them.  The=20

second group of punctured wounds, or _stab-wounds_, are by far the most com=
mon and,=20

therefore, the most important variety of punctured wounds. If the _stab-wou=
nd_ is _perpendicular_=20

to the surface the _form_ of the wound may represent pretty closely that of=
 the weapon at the=20

point where the latter was arrested, whether it has a single or double cutt=
ing edge. But even here=20

there are exceptions. Frequently a weapon with a broad back and only one cu=
tting edge may=20

produce a wound resembling that of an instrument with two cutting edges, th=
e second angle=20

tearing as in the former class. Here on close examination we can sometimes =
distinguish the=20

difference between the two angles, and judge correctly of the shape of the =
weapon. In fact,=20

wounds made by common pocket-knives are regularly slit-like and not wedge-s=
haped, as the=20

wound is caused only by the cutting edge of the knife. Again, if the single=
 cutting edge is blunt, in=20

rare cases the wound is produced in the same manner as those of the first g=
roup, or conical and=20

cylindrical instruments. We would be led to suppose that the wound was prod=
uced by such an=20

instrument, as both angles are torn, unless the direction of the wound migh=
t not follow that of the=20

fibres of the skin, in which case we would be left in doubt. Stab-wounds ar=
e sometimes angular=20

from the knife being withdrawn in a slightly different direction from that =
in which it was introduced=20

or from an unequal retraction of the skin (see Fig. 9). If the _stab-wound_=
 is _obliquely directed_,=20

we can still judge of the general _shape_ of the weapon, with exception of =
the cases above=20

mentioned. The dimensions and size of the weapon are here much harder to de=
termine. The=20

_dimensions_ of a stab-wound in the skin may be the same as those of the we=
apon, or of that part=20

of the weapon which is arrested in the wound, but often they are not so. To=
 measure the size of a=20



wound exactly so as to get at the exact size of the instrument, we should p=
lace the region of the=20

wound in the same position, etc., that it was when the wound was inflicted,=
 and this we cannot=20

often do. As the skin was tense or relaxed at the time the wound was inflic=
ted, so the wound in the=20

skin appears smaller or larger, just as with a sheet of rubber under simila=
r conditions. If the=20

instrument is very blunt, the wound in the skin may be smaller than the wea=
pon whether the skin=20

near the wound is tense or not. Thus Hofmann saw the wound from a blunt bay=
onet one=20

centimetre shorter than the weapon.  The wound of the skin may be shorter a=
nd broader than the=20

weapon used on account of retraction of the edges of the wound, and this is=
 especially marked=20

when the wound lies transversely to the direction of the skin fibres. On th=
e other hand, the length=20

of the external wound is more often greater than that of the weapon, becaus=
e the wound is=20

elongated by making pressure toward the cutting edge on withdrawal of the w=
eapon, and an=20

oblique wound measures longer than the weapon. If the blow is from above do=
wnward and the=20

cutting edge of the weapon is uppermost, the length of the wound is not so =
likely to be increased=20

much beyond the measurement of the weapon as when the cutting edge is direc=
ted downward.=20

There is but one condition in which a stab-wound is at all likely to corres=
pond in dimensions with=20

that of the weapon, and that is when the wound is perpendicular to the surf=
ace. Even here the=20

wound may be lengthened on withdrawal of the weapon, and we have to allow f=
or retraction of the=20

edges and try to put the parts in the same condition of tension or laxity a=
s at the time of wounding.=20

Even in the most favorable case, therefore, we cannot with certainty tell t=
he exact size of the=20

weapon. If a stab-wound be directed obliquely to the surface, then the leng=
th of the wound is=20

greater than that of the weapon, unless this increase be exactly counterbal=
anced by the lateral=20

retraction of the wound. The size of the weapon in such oblique wounds is f=
urther obscured by the=20

changes of size due to withdrawal of the weapon, retraction of the edges, a=
nd the condition of the=20

tension of the skin at the time the wound was inflicted.  [Illustration: FI=
G. 9.=E2=80=94Angular Stab-

Wounds of the Anterior Chest Wall caused by a Strong Pocket-Knife.]  Dupuyt=
ren remarks that=20

stab-wounds are smaller than the weapon owing to the elasticity of the skin=
, but a lateral motion of=20

the weapon may cause considerable enlargement of the wound. If a stab-wound=
 has traversed a=20

part of the body, the wound of exit is smaller than that of entrance.  The =
_depth_ of a punctured=20

wound may be any part of the length of the weapon, or it may even be=20


_
reparation made for it,=E2=80=94more especially as he who caused his death =
ought to have loved him as a=20

brother; for in the holy Scriptures nephews and cousins-german are called b=
rothers, as appears=20

from the book of Genesis, where Abraham says to his nephew Lot, =E2=80=98Ne=
 sit jurgium inter te et me,=20

fratres enim sumus.=E2=80=99 Let there be no strife between thee and me, fo=
r we are brothers.  =E2=80=98Saint=20

James is also called the brother of our Lord, when they were only cousins-g=
erman. Thou mayest=20

repeat to our adversary the words which God said to Cain, after he had murd=
ered his brother, =E2=80=98Vox=20

sanguinis fratris tui clamat ad me de terra.=E2=80=99 The voice of thy brot=
her=E2=80=99s blood cries to me from the=20

earth; and certainly in our case the earth and blood do cry.  =E2=80=98Ther=
e cannot be a man of common=20

feelings who has not compassion for such a death as that of my late lord of=
 Orleans; and it must=20

not be wondered at if I compare our adversary to Cain, for in them I see ma=
ny features of=20

resemblance. Cain, moved by envy, slew his brother, because the Lord had ac=
cepted of his=20

brother=E2=80=99s offerings, and had not received his sacrifice, because he=
 was practising in his heart how=20

he could kill his brother. In like manner, the duke of Burgundy, because my=
 lord of Orleans was=20

the more agreeable to the king, in his heart meditated his death, and in th=
e end had him=20

treacherously and infamously murdered, as shall be fully proven. As Cain, i=
nstigated by=20

covetousness, committed his crime, so our adversary, urged on by similar pa=
ssions, did the act we=20

complain of, as shall be demonstrated from his conduct previous to and afte=
r the death of the late=20

duke of Orleans. I find, likewise, that the word _Cain_, by interpretation,=
 signifies, =E2=80=98acquired=E2=80=99 or=20

=E2=80=98acquisition.=E2=80=99 By the same name our adverse party may be ca=
lled, for vengeance is acquired by the=20

king in body and goods; but let justice take its course, and events will ha=
ppen according to the=20

good pleasure of God. It therefore seems very reasonable that I compare the=
 duke of Burgundy to=20

Cain.  =E2=80=98Sire, remember, I pray thee, the words addressed to Cain, n=
amely, =E2=80=98Vox sanguinis:=E2=80=99 The=20

voice of thy brother=E2=80=99s blood. It is the voice of the lady of Orlean=
s, and of her children, crying to=20

thee, and demanding justice. Alas! my lord king, to whom wouldst thou wish =
to do justice, if thou=20

refusest to do it for the love of thy own brother? If thou be not a friend =
to thy blood, to whom=20

wouldst thou be a friend, seeing we ask no more than justice? O, most noble=
 prince, consider that=20

thy brother has been torn from thee for ever! Thou wilt never again see him=
, for the duke of=20

Burgundy has cruelly caused him to be put to death.  =E2=80=98Recollect he =
was thy brother, and thou wilt=20

find how greatly he is to be compassioned. He, like thee, was equally fond =
of the queen and thy=20

children, and, from his natural good sense, honoured all the royal blood of=
 France; and few could=20

be found more eloquent than he was when addressing nobles, clergy or laymen=
.  =E2=80=98Our Lord had=20

given him what king Solomon had demanded, prudence and wisdom; for every on=
e knows, that he=20

was adorned with an excellent understanding,=E2=80=94and of him may be said=
 as of David, in the chapter=20

of the Acts of the Apostles,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Sapiebat sicut angelus Domini=
.=E2=80=99 He was endowed with wisdom like=20

to an angel of God.  =E2=80=98Were I to speak of the beauty of his person, =
I could only say, that he was thy=20

image and resemblance, with this good quality that he was perfectly courteo=
us to all, and never=20

caused any one to be beaten, or put to death, nor did he ever procure the d=
eath of any one. He=20

possessed, however, the power of so doing, even to his enemies, who were no=
toriously defaming=20

him, and attributing to him evils which he never thought of: he could, more=
 especially, have had=20

our adversary put to death several times, had he so pleased,=E2=80=94for no=
 great power is requisite to=20

have any one treacherously murdered.  =E2=80=98But, in good truth, such tho=
ughts were not in his heart; for=20

the property of royal blood is to have such compassion and mercy a depressi=
on of the surface by=20



the force of the blow, or the pressure of the handle of the weapon or the h=
and holding it. We have=20

already seen that this may occur in a marked degree in penetrating wounds o=
f the abdomen=20

involving one of the movable viscera, also in wounds of the thorax, partly =
from depression of the=20

surface and partly from an expansion of the thorax when opened at the autop=
sy, thus increasing=20

the measured depth of the wound. Punctured wounds of the third class made b=
y instruments with=20

ridges or edges, like foils, files, etc., present more or less the shape of=
 the weapon if the edges are=20

cutting, but not always so if the direction of the wound be oblique or the =
parts unevenly stretched.=20

If the edges are not cutting they cause wounds more or less like the first =
class of punctured=20

wounds, but we can often distinguish them from the latter by little tears i=
n the edges. The entrance=20

and exit wounds may not be alike.  Wounds made by bits of _glass and earthe=
nware_ have=20

irregular and uneven edges. Taylor[637] relates a case, Reg. _v._ Ankers (W=
arwick Lent Ass.,=20

1845), where the wound was attributed to a fall on some broken crockery, bu=
t the wound was=20

cleanly incised and the prisoner was convicted. As it may be alleged in def=
ence that a given=20

wound was caused by a fall on broken crockery or other substances capable o=
f producing a=20

punctured wound, it is important to notice whether the edges are lacerated =
and irregular or smooth=20

and clean. The author quoted above cites another case which occurred to Wat=
son, where the=20

prisoner alleged that a deep, clean-cut wound of the genitals of a woman wh=
ich had caused her=20

death was due to a fall on some broken glass. The character of the wound di=
sproved this defence.=20

Another feature of such wounds, especially if they be deep in comparison to=
 their length, is that=20

they are very apt to contain small particles of the glass or earthenware wh=
ich caused them. In fact,=20

in all wounds it is well to search for any small fragments which will throw=
 light upon the weapon=20

used.  Wounds caused by _scissors_ are often of characteristic shape. If th=
e scissors were open=20

we find two symmetrical, punctured diverging wounds, presenting more or les=
s clearly the form of=20

the blades of the scissors. If the blades have been approximated there is a=
 triangular interval=20

between the punctures, the apex of which is truncated if any skin remains b=
etween the punctures.=20

_Lacerated wounds_ may not indicate the weapon used as clearly as punctured=
 wounds, but the=20

agent which produced them is often indicated by the appearance of the wound=
. They are generally=20

accidental. But where they occur, as they not infrequently do, on the bodie=
s of new-born children,=20

they may give rise to the charge of infanticide. In some cases the weapon w=
hich caused the=20

wound fits the wound produced, and thus important evidence may be furnished=
 the prosecution.=20

Taylor[638] cites the case of Montgomery (Omagh Sum. Ass., 1873), where a b=
ill-hook which fitted=20

the injuries on the skull of the deceased was found buried in a spot to whi=
ch the prisoner was seen=20

to go. These facts connected the prisoner with the weapon and the weapon wi=
th the murder. In=20

other cases the wounds may be so lacerated or contused that the indications=
 of the weapon are=20

obscured.  =3DContusions and Contused Wounds.=3D=E2=80=94The shape of a con=
tusing body is sometimes=20

reproduced by the contusion and the ecchymosis. Thus we are enabled to dist=
inguish the marks of=20

a whip, the fingers, the fist, etc. This is best seen when the ecchymosis i=
s fresh, for soon the=20

edges extend and the outline is less clearly marked. Plaques parchemin=C3=
=A9es, which we have=20

already described as the marks of contused erosions, may show the form of f=
inger-nails, etc.=20

Contused wounds like simple contusions may show the shape of the weapon.  I=
f the contusing=20

body has a large area, the whole of this area cannot often strike the body =
at once, so that the=20

outline of the contusion does not represent that of the weapon. But in=20


_
cannot suffer any cruelty, murder or treason whatever; and of this blood my=
 late lord of Orleans=20

had a large share, for he was the son of a king and queen.  =E2=80=98O, kin=
g Charles! if thou wert now=20

alive, what wouldst thou say? What tears could appease thee? What would hav=
e hindered thee=20

from doing justice for so base a murder? Alas! how hast thou loved, and to =
what honour hast thou=20

diligently trained the tree that has brought forth the fruit which has put =
to death thy very dear son?=20

Alas! king Charles, thou mayest now say with Jacob, =E2=80=98Fera pessima d=
evoravit filium meum.=E2=80=99 The=20

worst of beasts has devoured my son.  =E2=80=98Our adversary has made a mis=
erable return to thee, oh=20

Charles! for all the great riches thou hast heaped on his father. This is t=
he gratitude for the=20

expedition to Flanders, wherein thou and thy kingdom were in such peril out=
 of love to him. In=20

truth, all the magnificent gifts thou madest the father are already forgott=
en. Sire, look down, and=20

hear the lady of Orleans, crying in the words of the Psalmist, =E2=80=98Dom=
ine deduc me in justitia tua=20

propter inimicos meos.=E2=80=99 Lord, lead me to thy judgment on account of=
 mine enemies.  =E2=80=98This=20

concludes my second argument. My third is founded on pity, considering the =
desolate state of the=20

supplicants, namely, the widowed lady of Orleans, in despair, with her inno=
cent contusions present=20

greater difficulties than the preceding classes of wounds. We must generall=
y be content if we can=20

determine whether the wound was caused by a weapon, including the fist, or =
by a fall, and we are=20

often unable to say even this. A fall is often alleged by the defence as th=
e cause of the injury, but=20

of course if the prisoner was responsible for the fall he is responsible fo=
r the results of the fall. If=20

there are contusions or contused wounds on _several parts_ of the head, or =
if the wounds are on=20

the _vertex_ of the head, it is presumptive of the use of weapons. We canno=
t often swear that=20

each and every wound on the head was due to the use of a weapon. On the oth=
er hand, the=20

presence of grass, sand, gravel, etc., in a wound is presumptive of a fall =
and of the origin of the=20

wound in this manner. In case of a fall from a height the wound or wounds m=
ight be in almost any=20

part of the body, on the vertex or elsewhere. Such a fall may be the result=
 of accident, suicide, or=20

murder. It is not unusual for female complainants to ascribe their wounds t=
o a fall to exculpate the=20

prisoner, especially if this happens to be her husband. We should remember =
that in the scalp or=20

over the eyebrows a contused wound caused by a blunt instrument may resembl=
e an incised=20

wound. As already stated, however, if the wound=20


_
now become orphans, having no other father to look to but thee. It becomes =
thee, therefore, to=20

incline thyself diligently to do them justice, as they have no other refuge=
 but in thee, who art their=20

lord and sovereign; and they are beside thy very near relations, as thou we=
ll knowest.  =E2=80=98Let pity=20

move thy breast; for as Saint James the apostle says, =E2=80=98Religio mund=
a et immaculata est visitare=20

pupillos et viduas in tribulatione eorum.=E2=80=99 To visit orphans and wid=
ows in their distress is the duty of=20

a pure and undefiled religion. It is melancholy that so great a lady should=
 suffer thus undeservedly;=20

and she may be compared to her whom Valerius speaks of in the sixth book. A=
 widow had a son=20

who had been unjustly slain: she went to the emperor Octavian to demand jus=
tice, and said, =E2=80=98Sire,=20

do me justice for the cruel death of my son.=E2=80=99 The emperor had alrea=
dy mounted his horse, to=20

perform a long journey, but replied, =E2=80=98Woman, wait until I be return=
ed, when I will do thee justice.=E2=80=99=20

The woman answered instantly, =E2=80=98Alas! my lord, thou knowest not if e=
ver thou shalt return, and I=20

wish not justice to be delayed.=E2=80=99 The emperor said, =E2=80=98Should =
I not return, my successor will see thee=20

righted;=E2=80=99 but the widow replied, =E2=80=98Sire, thou knowest not if=
 thy successor would wish to see me=20

righted: he may, perhaps, have something to prevent it like to thee; and su=
pposing that he should=20

do me justice, what honour would it be to thee, or what merit canst thou cl=
aim for it from the gods?=20

Thou art bound to do me justice: wherefore then seekest thou to throw the b=
urden on others?=E2=80=99=20

=E2=80=98The emperor, observing the firmness of the woman and the reasonabl=
eness of her arguments,=20

dismounted, and, without more delay, did her ample justice. It was for this=
 meritorious conduct,=20

that when the emperor died, five years after, in the pagan faith, he was br=
ought to life again by the=20

prayers of St Gregory, then pope, and baptised, as the histories relate.  =
=E2=80=98The example of this=20

emperor, O king of France! thou oughtest to follow in regard to the discons=
olate widow of the late=20

duke of Orleans, who is now a supplicant to thee, and has formerly demanded=
, and now again=20

demands justice, for the inhuman and barbarous murder of her lord and husba=
nd, who was thy=20

brother. Delays, or reference to thy successors, will have no avail; for th=
ou, as king, art singularly=20

obliged to correct opinion, and the use of a sharp instrument may be dispro=
ved. If the wound is not=20

recent there is great difficulty in judging of the cause. It is well to cau=
tion against accepting the=20

interested statements of others in regard to the use of a weapon, unless th=
e character of the=20

wound bears them out very strongly. There may be a bad motive for imputing =
the use of a certain=20

weapon to the assailant. It is far better to rely solely upon the evidence =
furnished by the wound in=20

such cases.  It would be useful if we could lay down some general rules to =
discriminate between=20

wounds caused by the blow of a weapon and those caused by falls, but this w=
e are unable to do=20

so as to cover all cases. Each case must be judged by itself.  If the quest=
ion is asked _which of=20

two weapons_ caused certain contusions or contused wounds, we are still les=
s likely to be able to=20

answer it. In such a case we must make an accurate examination of the form =
of the wound and=20

compare it closely with that of the weapon. In such cases also the second s=
ource of information on=20

which we base our opinion as to the relation of a weapon to the wound may b=
e of use, namely, the=20

examination of the weapon. The presence of blood, hair, cotton or woollen f=
ibres on one of two=20

weapons indicates that this was the weapon used. The presence of blood is p=
articularly to be=20

looked for, and in those parts of the weapon from which it could be washed =
off least easily. We=20

should further note the condition of the point and edge of the weapon, and =
if the edge is broken or=20

nicked at all, whether this condition is old or recent. The sharpness of th=
e edge should further be=20

noted, and if the edge is sharp note whether it has recently been sharpened=
. All these points have=20



a certain bearing on the case. Also the location, shape, depth, etc., of th=
e wound should be=20

carefully noted to see if an accidental fall would be likely to account for=
 it. For these features of the=20

wound may be such that no fall could cause it.  We see, therefore, that in =
incised and punctured=20

wounds the use of a weapon may not be hard to make out, but that in general=
 the question=20

whether a particular instrument caused the wound is often difficult or impo=
ssible to answer. Often=20

the best we can do is to say that the wound could have been produced by the=
 weapon.   V. WAS A=20

WOUND SELF-INFLICTED OR WAS=20


_
this, considering the rank of the supplicants, the duchess of Orleans and h=
er children.  =E2=80=98This lady is=20

like to the widow of whom St Jerome speaks, in his second book against Jovi=
nian, wherein he=20

relates, that the daughter of Cato, after the death of her husband, was in =
the deepest sorrow,=20

uttering nothing but groans and lamentations. Her relations and neighbours =
asked her how long=20

this grief was to last,=E2=80=94when she replied, that her life and her sor=
row would end together. Such,=20

without doubt, is the state of my lady the duchess,=E2=80=94for she can hav=
e no remedy for her loss but=20

by means of the justice she is soliciting. In truth, she does not require a=
ny hostile measures,=E2=80=94for=20

were that the case, she and her children, with their allies, are so much mo=
re powerful than the=20

duke of Burgundy that they are well able to avenge themselves.  =E2=80=98Th=
is act of justice thou canst not=20

refuse, nor can the adverse party raise any objections to it, considering t=
he persons who demand=20

it. O, sovereign king! act in such wise that the words the Psalmist spoke o=
f the Lord may be=20

applied to thee: =E2=80=98Justus Dominus et justitias dilexit, =C3=A6quitat=
em vidit vultus ejus.=E2=80=99 Our Lord is=20

judgment, and loves justice: equity is the light of his countenance.=E2=80=
=94This concludes my third=20

argument.  =E2=80=98My  In other words, was it _suicidal_ or _homicidal_? S=
peaking of suicide in general,=20

its most common cause is alcoholism. It is not infrequent in youth. Lutaud[=
639] states that in fifteen=20

years, presumably in France, there were 1,065 cases of suicide between the =
ages of ten and=20

fifteen years. This seems to be only explicable on the ground of heredity o=
r of cerebral affections.=20

Among 27,737 cases of suicide, observed in France, the same author gives th=
e following=20

commonest causes in the order of greatest frequence: Drowning, strangulatio=
n, pistol-wounds,=20

incised and punctured wounds, poison. The age, sex, and social conditions i=
nfluence the choice of=20

means. Thus among males drowning is preferred by the young, pistol-wounds b=
y the adult, and=20

hanging by the aged, while among females asphyxia is the favorite method, a=
s there is no pain=20

and no disfigurement.  While many pathologists consider suicide an act of m=
ental alienation, and=20

though such may be the case in a large number or even in a majority of case=
s, yet in a=20

considerable number it is a voluntary and rationally planned act. The quest=
ion, Is it suicide or=20

homicide? may be put in all cases of death by cutting instruments, and in m=
any from other kinds of=20

wounds. It is often, if not generally, impossible=20


_
abominably cruel, the like was never seen; and all men of understanding mus=
t feel compassion for=20

it. This, if duly considered, should incline thee the more to do justice, f=
rom the usages of the=20

ancient kings, who, through compassion, bewailed even the death of an enemy=
: how much the=20

more then does it become thee to bewail the death of thy brother, and to ex=
ert thy courage to=20

punish the authors of it? Should it not be so, great disgrace will attach t=
o thee and to many others.=20

=E2=80=98We read, that C=C3=A6sar seeing the head of his enemy Pompey wept,=
 and said, that such a man=20

ought not to have died. He was also very much grieved at the death of Cato,=
 though his enemy,=20

and did all in his power to aid and console his children. O, most courteous=
 king of France! thou=20

oughtest likewise to give consolation for the death of thy brother, who was=
 thy dear and loyal=20

friend. Weigh well the manner of his death, which was piteously to answer i=
t with absolute=20

certainty. It is hardly suitable for the medical witness to try to reconstr=
uct the scene of the crime=20

from the medical facts, for he should abstain from everything not medical a=
nd should distinguish=20

that which is positively proven from that which is merely probable.  Suicid=
es often leave a letter or=20

some such indication to show that the wound was self-inflicted. If such is =
not the case, the=20

question as to the cause of the wound may or may not be medical. If the que=
stion is a medical=20

one, there are certain points to notice as to the wound, such as its _natur=
e_, _situation_,=20

_direction_, and the _number_ and _extent_ of the wounds, from which we are=
 to form an opinion.=20

There are also other circumstances which furnish evidence and thus assist u=
s in answering the=20

question. This evidence is furnished by the weapon, the signs of struggle, =
the examination of the=20

clothes and body of the=20


_
speak, what would it not say? It would certainly address thee in words simi=
lar to these:  =E2=80=98Oh, my=20

lord and brother, see how through thee I have received my death,=E2=80=94fo=
r it was on account of the=20

great affection that subsisted between us! Look at my wounds, five of which=
 are mortal. See my=20

body beat to the ground, and covered with mud! behold my arm cut off, and m=
y brains scattered=20

about! See if any pains were equal to my sufferings. It was not, alas! suff=
icient for mine enemy to=20

take away my life so cruelly, and without cause; but he suddenly surprised =
me when coming from=20

the residence of the queen to thee, which has put me in danger of damnation=
; and even after my=20

death, he has attempted to blast my reputation by his false and defamatory =
libel.  =E2=80=98My sovereign=20

king, attend to these words as if thy brother had spoken them; for such the=
y would have been,=20

could he have addressed thee. Be then more active to do justice; and having=
 heard the petition of=20

my lady of Orleans, act so that thou mayest verify what is said in the seco=
nd chapter of the first=20

book of Kings: =E2=80=98Dominus retribuet unicuique secundum justitiam suam=
.=E2=80=99 Our Lord will render to all=20

according to his justice. And this concludes my fourth argument.  =E2=80=98=
My fifth is grounded on the great=20

evils and mischiefs that might ensue if justice be not done on such crimes,=
=E2=80=94for every one will in=20

future take the law into his own hand, and be judge and party. Treasons and=
 murders will be the=20

consequence, by which the kingdom may be ruined, as I shall demonstrate; fo=
r, according to the=20

doctors, the surest way to preserve peace in a country is to do equal justi=
ce to all. St Cyprian=20

declares this, in his book on the twelve errors, saying, =E2=80=98Justitia =
regis, pax populorum, tutamen=20

pueris, munimentum gentis, terr=C3=A6 f=C5=93cunditas, solatium pauperum, h=
ereditas filiorum, et sibimet=20

spes futur=C3=A6 beatitudinis.=E2=80=99 The justice of a king is peace to t=
he people, the defender of orphans, the=20

safety of the subject, the fertility of the earth, the comfort of the poor,=
 the inheritance of sons, and=20

to himself a hope of future happiness. It is an everlasting glory. And on t=
his occasion the Psalmist=20

says, =E2=80=98Justitia et pax osculat=C3=A6 sunt.=E2=80=99 Righteousness a=
nd peace have kissed each other.  =E2=80=98Should it=20

be urged, that if due punishment be inflicted on this crime, greater any or=
ganic lesions, etc.,=20

predisposing to suicide.  The =3Dnature=3D of the wound bears upon the ques=
tion of the homicidal or=20

suicidal origin in the following way: Most suicidal wounds are incised or p=
unctured wounds.=20

_Incised wounds of the throat_ are generally presumptive of suicide, but a =
homicidal wound may=20

be inflicted here to conceal the source of infliction of the wound. Such a =
wound if homicidal would=20

imply malice, on account of the attempt at deception and concealment, and w=
ould convict the=20

assailant of murder. Unless the deceased was asleep or drunk or was otherwi=
se incapable of=20

resistance, such a homicidal wound can often be distinguished from a simila=
r suicidal wound by=20

the form and direction of the wound, by its irregularity, and by other woun=
ds on the hands or=20

person of the deceased. Taylor[640] mentions a case in which the peculiar f=
orm of the wound, like=20

that made by butchers in killing sheep, led to the suspicion that homicide =
had been committed by a=20

butcher, who was subsequently arrested, tried, and convicted of murder. The=
 _regularity_ of the=20

wound has been taken to indicate suicide rather than homicide. That it does=
 so is not questioned,=20

but it is more or less fallacious if resistance is impossible, in which cas=
e a murderer may easily=20

make a regular, clean, incised wound here. _Contused wounds_ are seldom sui=
cidal, for they are=20

not sufficiently speedily or certainly fatal. They are also more painful an=
d disfiguring. Contused=20

wounds usually indicate murder or accident, though there are not wanting ca=
ses of suicide by such=20

weapons as a hatchet or a hammer. There is more difficulty in the case of a=
 contused wound from=20

a fall instead of from a weapon; for here we have to decide whether the fal=
l was accidental,=20



suicidal, or homicidal. The nature of the wound is of little assistance in =
the case of insane or=20

delirious patients, who may commit suicide in the most unusual and curious =
manner.  Taylor[641]=20

relates the case of a delirious patient in Guy=E2=80=99s Hospital, in 1850,=
 who tore away the whole of the=20

abdominal muscles from the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall. If th=
e case had not occurred=20

in the hospital or where there were witnesses of the deed, the nature of th=
e wound would have=20

indicated homicide except for the delirium. The following case, quoted by=
=20


_
Burgundy. To this, which has more of appearance than reality, it may be ans=
wered, That the duke=20

of Burgundy is as nothing compared with the power of the monarch; for what =
power or force can=20

he have but what thou givest him or sufferest him to enjoy?  =E2=80=98Justi=
ce and truth, however they may=20

be delayed, always in the end, through Divine mercy, are the mistresses, an=
d there is no security=20

like working for them. Who are the knights or esquires that very unusual na=
ture and situation,=20

which might have been taken for a homicidal wound with intent to conceal as=
 far as the situation of=20

the wound was concerned. The wound was accidental and occurred in the follo=
wing way. A girl=20

fifteen years old jumped on to her uncle=E2=80=99s knee while he was holdin=
g a stick between his legs=20

which she did not notice. The Stick passed up her anus, but she withdrew it=
 and went on playing,=20

though she complained of pain.=20
