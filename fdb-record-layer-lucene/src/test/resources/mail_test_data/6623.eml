revealed gradually and with great caution, the public mind not being prepar=
ed for them. However=20

much the Agnostics of our age may find themselves in the mental attitude de=
manded by Modern=20

Science, people are always apt to cling to their old hobbies so long as the=
 remembrance of them=20

lasts. They are like the Emperor Julian--called the Apostate, because he lo=
ved truth too well to=20

accept aught else--who, though in his last Theophany he beheld his beloved =
Gods as pale, worn-

out, and hardly discernible shadows, nevertheless clung to them. Let, then,=
 the world cling to its=20

Gods, to whatever plane or realm they may belong. The true Occultist would =
be guilty of high=20

treason to mankind, were he to break for ever the old deities before he cou=
ld replace them with=20

entirely obliterated. When last heard from the lapse of memory still remain=
ed.[937]  The statement=20

that death from submersion results from true asphyxia or from asphyxia in a=
 more or less modified=20

form rests on the authority of a large number of facts. Indeed, recent inve=
stigators make the=20

proportion so much greater than formerly as to warrant the statement that a=
sphyxia is the generic=20

cause of death by drowning. Dr. S. Coull Mackenzie[938] reports 305 cases o=
f drowning, in which=20

297, or 93.37 per cent, died from asphyxiation; 1, or .32 per cent, from sy=
ncope; 1, or .32 per cent,=20

from apoplexy and asphyxia; and in 6, or 1.96 per cent, the mode of death c=
ould not be=20

determined because of advanced putrefaction.  As the post-mortem signs of d=
rowning are=20


_
unadulterated truth--and this he cannot do as yet. Nevertheless, the reader=
 may be allowed to=20

learn at least the alphabet of that truth. He may be shown, at any rate, wh=
at the Gods and=20

Goddesses of the Pagans, denounced as demons by the Church, are not, if he =
cannot learn the=20

whole and final truth as to what they are. Let him assure himself that the =
Hermetic "Tres Matres,"=20

and the "Three Mothers" of the _Sepher Jetzirah_ are one and the same thing=
; that they are no=20

Demon-Goddesses, but Light, Heat, and Electricity, and then, perchance, the=
 learned classes will=20

spurn them no longer. After this, the Rosicrucian Illuminati may find follo=
wers even in the Royal=20

Academies, which will be more prepared, perhaps, than they are now, to admi=
t the grand truths of=20

archaic Natural Philosophy, especially when their learned members shall hav=
e assured=20

themselves that, in the dialect of Hermes, the "Three Mothers" stand as sym=
bols for the whole of=20

the forces or agencies which have a place assigned to them in the modern sy=
stem of the=20

"correlation of forces."(121) Even the polytheism of the "superstitious" Br=
ahman and idolater=20

shows its _raison d'etre_, since the three Shaktis of the three great Gods,=
 Brahma, Vishnu, and=20

Shiva, are identical with the "Three Mothers" of the monotheistic Jew.  The=
 whole of the ancient=20

religious and mystical literature is symbolical. The _Books of Hermes_, the=
 _Zohar_, the _Ya-

Yakav_, the Egyptian _Book __ of the Dead_, the _Vedas_, the _Upanishads_, =
and the _Bible_,=20

are as full of symbolism as are the Nabathean revelations of the Chaldaic Q=
u-tamy; it is a number=20

of circumstances, it is difficult to deal with the subject unless certain f=
undamental points be kept in=20

mind. These relate more particularly to the external signs and to the diffe=
rent lesions that follow=20

the mode of death, although they are not constant. Surgeon-Major E. G. Russ=
ell[939] illustrates=20

how widely the post-mortem appearances may vary in cases of drowning, even =
when the outward=20

circumstances of the period of death are identical and the bodies have been=
 subjected to precisely=20

similar conditions as regards duration of immersion, subsequent exposure to=
 air, and times of=20

necropsy. He relates that five persons were drowned while proceeding to a s=
hip in the Hooghley=20

River. Three died the same death; and at the same time the bodies were reco=
vered together after=20

the same period of immersion, and were examined together; thus from beginni=
ng to end they had=20

been under exactly similar conditions, yet there were very marked differenc=
es in the state of=20

preservation of the bodies and in the post-mortem appearances. After five h=
ours=E2=80=99 exposure in air at=20

88=C2=B0 F., one body, in which the tissues were extremely fatty, showed be=
ginning decomposition; in=20

the other two there were no signs. Decomposition in the scalp, face, and ne=
ck indicative of=20

drowning had begun under water, although in ordinary cases it first invades=
 the abdomen,=20

genitals, breasts, etc. Rigor mortis present in one case was absent in the =
other. The penis was=20

semi-erect in one case, flaccid in the other, retracted and shrunken in the=
 third. Emission of semen=20

and expulsion of f=C3=A6ces were also noted.=20


_
versions of the one primeval Record of prehistoric knowledge and revelation=
.  The first four=20

chapters of _Genesis_ contain the synopsis of all the rest of the _Pentateu=
ch_, being only the=20

various versions of the same thing in different allegorical and symbolical =
applications. Having=20

discovered that the Pyramid of Cheops with all its measurements is to be fo=
und contained in its=20

minutest details in the structure of Solomon's Temple; and having ascertain=
ed that the biblical=20

names Shem, Ham and Japhet are determinative       of pyramid measures, in =
connection with the=20

600-year period of     Noah and the 500-year period of Shem, Ham and Japhet=
; ... the term=20

"Sons of Elohim" and "Daughters" of H-Adam, [are] for one thing     astrono=
mical terms,(122)   the=20

author of the very curious work already mentioned--a book very little known=
 in Europe, we regret=20

to say--seems to see nothing in his discovery beyond the presence of Mathem=
atics and Metrology=20

in the _Bible_. He also arrives at most unexpected and extraordinary conclu=
sions, such as are=20

very little absent in all three, which may have been owing to the high temp=
erature. Water was=20

inspired into the lungs in two cases. The larynx, trachea, and bronchi had =
regular congestion and=20

scarlet ecchymoses in one case characteristic of asphyxia, and there was mu=
ddy water in the=20

stomach.  The first question likely to arise when a drowned body has been f=
ound is the one of=20

identity. All the circumstances in which the body was observed before its r=
emoval to the place=20

where it lies for examination should therefore be minutely detailed, and al=
l lethal injuries and the=20

like should be noted with care, since the smallest accessories often lead t=
o identification. The=20

locality in which a drowned body is found may be a fact of considerable imp=
ortance that may help=20

to complete the chain of evidence in which the matter of crime or of accide=
nt turns upon the=20

question of identity. It must be remembered that bodies often drift many mi=
les away from the spot=20

where the drowning occurred, owing to tides or currents. Such a circumstanc=
e I noted a few years=20

ago at Brownsville,=20


_
because the Jewish biblical names are all astronomical, therefore the Scrip=
tures of all the other=20

nations can be "only this and nothing more." But this is a great mistake of=
 the erudite and=20

wonderfully acute author of _The Source of Measures_, if he really thinks s=
o. The "Key to the=20

Hebrew- Egyptian Mystery" unlocks but a certain portion of the hieratic wri=
tings of these two=20

nations, and leaves those of other peoples untouched. His idea is that the =
_Kabalah_ "is only that=20

sublime Science upon which Masonry is based"; in fact he regards Masonry as=
 the substance of=20

the _Kabalah_, and the latter as the "rational basis of the Hebrew text of =
Holy Writ." About this we=20

will not argue with the author. But why should all those who may have found=
 in the _Kabalah_=20

something beyond "the sublime Science" upon which Masonry is alleged to hav=
e been built, be=20

held up to public contempt?  In its exclusiveness and one-sidedness such a =
conclusion is=20

cadavers going down the Rio Grande. Time and putrefactive changes are also =
elements that enter=20

into the matter of recognizing the drowned cadaver. To resolve this questio=
n with desirable=20

precision, the reader is referred to more detailed instruction in the chapt=
er on Identity.=20

TREATMENT OF THE APPARENTLY DROWNED.  Help to the drowned does not properly=
 come=20

within the province of judiciary medicine, being rather a humane question t=
hat belongs to public=20

hygiene. Systematic writers, however, treat the subject at considerable len=
gth, and the statistics of=20

institutions for helping the drowned give such marvellous results that it w=
ould manifestly not be out=20

of place to cite briefly some of the means employed for restoring life to p=
ersons taken from the=20

water asphyxiated and apparently dead.  The prime object in resuscitating t=
he drowned is the=20

introduction of air into the pulmonary vesicles, which is best accomplished=
 by artificial=20


_
future misconceptions and is absolutely wrong. In its uncharitable criticis=
m it throws a slur upon=20

the "Divine Science" itself.  The _Kabalah_ is indeed "of the essence of Ma=
sonry," but it is=20

dependent on Metrology only in one of its aspects, the less Esoteric, as ev=
en Plato made no=20

secret that the Deity was ever geometrising. For the uninitiated, however l=
earned and endowed=20

with genius they may be, the _Kabalah_, which the nervous system with a vie=
w to reanimate=20

sensibility and develop the reflex movements that contribute to the re-esta=
blishment of the=20

respiratory function.  The exigencies of drowning also call for special mea=
ns to restore the animal=20

heat and the circulation, as well as the precaution of removing mucus and f=
luids from the=20

obstructed air-passages.  As the knowledge of securing patency of the air-p=
