and to make her as little like other children as possible.  Now with Charlotta's companionship she 

and Bianca spent the greater part of each day outdoors, sometimes accompanied by Miss Pringle, 

who as an Englishwoman was an indefatigable walker. But now and then the two girls were alone. 

This was scarcely a satisfactory arrangement since Coblenz was filled with soldiers and Sonya 

was by no means content. She could only insist that the two girls be extremely careful and never 

go any distance by themselves, and also that Charlotta remember that as Bianca was not well, 

they must never undertake any excursion which would demand too much of Bianca's strength.  At 

first Sonya was surprised by Charlotta's consideration of the younger girl, it having been 

reasonable to presume from their brief acquaintance that Charlotta was selfish and self-willed. Yet 

she seemed really devoted to Bianca and more than willing to sacrifice her own wishes for her 

friend.  It was one afternoon in the latter part of March soon after luncheon that Miss Pringle, 

Charlotta and Bianca started out together for an afternoon walk. The day was the warmest day of 

the early spring and they decided to walk away from the city toward a woods which was probably

which Sonya had presented to her some time before, while Charlotta wore the sable coat which 

was too handsome for her present position and needs. But Miss Pringle was attired in her usual 

shabby black dress and the everlasting black feather boa.  The two girls talked continuously so 

that Miss Pringle rarely paid any especial attention to what they were saying. She was extremely 

fond of the Countess Charlotta, but the young girl's enthusiasms sometimes tired her. Moreover,

This afternoon Bianca and Charlotta walked arm in arm along a road leading toward the woods 

beyond, Miss Pringle walking sedately about a foot behind her two charges.  The road was hard 

and dry as there was a high March wind, although not at present a cold one.  "Are you sure you
