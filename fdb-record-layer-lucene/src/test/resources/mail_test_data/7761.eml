has a surplus of twenty or thirty thousand ducats, it should be reported to have one or two hundred 

thousand.  Such sums should never, on account of any other necessity, be lacking here, for they 

would be useful for many things and by the credit they would give, the greatest wants could be 

met. I shall report, as Your Highness ordered, the number and names of the friars now sailing, as 

soon as we are all united, God willing, at San Lucar.  Up to now I think we have forty-three.  I am 

in hopes of more going from this province, from which we have seven or eight.  But all those who 

are going, do not want to separate from those who come from Castile or to go to any other part of 

the Indies except where the latter do: the men from here are very virtuous and religious people. 

The number I have said we have here would have been greater, had not some six or eight of 

those whom we brought from Castile stayed behind.  I think that some were afraid and others were 

detained by reasonable obstacles: the latter, we hope will follow us when the causes are removed. 

I beg Your Highness to order the Provincial, who is now appointed to this province and who was 

formerly Prior of San Pablo in Valladolid, a true servant of God,  A fearful gust of wind howled 

round the house, and drowned his voice, and then he heard two tremendous claps, as if rocks had 

been hurled from heaven.  He started up and went to the window, where the melancholy grey 

dawn was showing, in order to call the slaves.  Soon they came trooping out, and the steward 

called out as soon as he saw him:  "The storm has blown down the masts at the great gate!" 

"Impossible!"  cried Paaker.  "Yes, indeed!"  answered the servant.  "They have been sawn 

through close to the ground.  The matmaker no doubt did it, whose collar-bone was broken.  He 

has escaped in this fearful night."  "Let out the dogs," cried the Mohar.  "All who have legs run 

after the blackguard!  Freedom, and five handfuls of gold for the man who brings him back."  The 

guests at the House of Seti had already gone to rest, when Ameni was informed of the arrival of 

the sorceress, and he at once went into the hall, where Ani was waiting to see her; the Regent 

roused himself from a deep reverie when he heard the high-priest's steps.  "Is she come?"  he 

asked hastily; when Ameni answered in the affirmative Ani went on meanwhile carefully 

disentangling the disordered curls of his wig, and arranging his broad,

for God's honour and for the salvation of the Indians, to be induced to continually send monks to 

those parts, as I firmly believe he will amply comply.  This house of San Pablo in Seville being very 

necessary for the religious Your Highness will be sending to the Indies, and having great 

expenses on account of the poverty and want of this city, where everything costs a third more than 

in Valladolid--which is frightful--I humbly beseech Your Highness always to remember it by gifts 

"The witch may exercise some influence over me; will you not give me your blessing to preserve 

me from her spells?  It is true, I have on me this Houss'-eye, and this Isis-charm, but one never 

knows."  "My presence will be your safe-guard," said Ameni.  "But-no, of course you wish to speak 

with her alone.  You shall be conducted to a room, which is protected against all witchcraft by 

sacred texts.  My brother," he continued to one of the serving-priests, "let the witch be taken
