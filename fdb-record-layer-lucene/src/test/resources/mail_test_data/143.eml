There was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm, just below =
the elbow, several minor=20

nips in his left leg above the knee, and a ragged "grab" in the chin. These=
 numerous bites,=20

however, were followed by no serious ill effects.  The next day, Tom told m=

"Mathaw!" in shrill tones of varied joy. As one of the gentlewomen passed n=

modestly--  "How much, please?"  She dropped a flake of paper on to his tab=

her course, and said warningly:  "You pay at the desk."  When he hit on the=
 desk, which was=20
