that the names of former       inmates of the Minnesota State Prison with s=

has been such an       arbitrary demand from the general public, that we ha=

 in the same manner as before, and it will become of a yellow Colour; and, =

the author, Mr. W. C. Heilbron, truly states, the first two months of incar=
