but without much noise. He was the quietest man in Paris. He was so quiet t=
hat he had to have a=20

muffler cut-out on his own great heart to keep it from drowning his voice! =
There is a soft lisp in his=20

speech which might fool strangers who do not know about the steel of his ne=
rves and the=20

keenness of his eye. He sat in a roomy office with a clean desk, toyed with=
 a paper knife and=20

made quick, sure, accurate decisions in a low hesitant voice that never bac=
ked track nor=20

weakened before a disagreeable situation. He is the man who more than anyon=
e else has laid out=20

the spending of the major part of the first one hundred millions gathered i=
n America by the Red=20

Cross drive last summer. He held his rank as Major in the United States arm=
y, and wore his=20

uniform as though it were his skin, clean, unwrinkled and handsome, with th=
at gorgeous quality of=20

unconscious pride that is, after all, the West Pointer's real grace.  As we=
 sat in that noble room,=20

looking out across the Place de la Concorde, past the Obelisk to the House =
of Deputies beyond=20

the Seine, it was evident that Henry was thinking hard. The spectacle of Ma=
jor Murphy's young=20

men in their habiliments of service, Red Cross military uniforms that made =
them look like lilies of=20

the valley and bright and morning stars, gave us both something to think ab=
out. The recollection of=20

those $17.93 uniforms of ours in the rooms at the Ritz was disquieting. We =
had service hats; these=20

young gods wore brown caps with leather visors and enameled Red Crosses abo=
ve the leather.=20

We had cotton khaki tunics unadorned, and of a vintage ten years old. They =
had khaki worsted of=20

a cut to conform to the newest general order. They had Sam Browne belts of =
high potency, and we=20

had no substitute even for that insignia of power. They had shiny leather p=
uttees. We had tapes.=20

They had brown shoes--we had not given a fleeting thought to shoes. We migh=
t as well have had=20

congress gaiters! So when the conversation with Major Murphy turned to a po=
int where he said=20

that he expected us to go with him to the French front immediately he took =
a look at our Sunday=20

best Emporia and Wichita civilian clothes and asked casually, "Have you gen=
tlemen uniforms?"=20

For me right there the cock crowed three times. Henry heard it also, and an=
swered slowly, "Well,=20

no--not exactly."  "Mr. Hoppen," said the Major, "take these gentlemen down=
 the street and show=20

them where to get uniforms!" Which Mr. Hoppen went and did. Now Mr. Hoppen =
is related to the=20

Morgans--the J. Pierpont Morgans--and he has small notion of Emporia and Wi=
chita. So he took=20

us to a tailorshop after his own heart. We chose a modest outfit, with no f=
rills. We the doubt. It may=20

also be observed that the various Indian nations, who frequent this labyrin=
th of rivers, give them=20

names entirely different; and that these names are disguised and lengthened=
 by terminations that=20

signify water, great water, and current. How often have I been perplexed by=
 the necessity of=20

settling the synonyms of rivers, when I have sent for the most intelligent =
natives, to interrogate=20

them, through an interpreter, respecting the number of tributary streams, t=
he sources of the rivers,=20

and the portages. Three or four languages being spoken in the same mission,=
 it is difficult to make=20

the witnesses agree. Our maps are loaded with names arbitrarily shortened o=
r perverted. To=20

examine how far they may be accurate, we must be guided by the geographical=
 situation of the=20

confluent rivers, I might almost say by a certain etymological tact. The Ri=
o Uaupe, or Uapes of the=20

Portuguese maps, is the Guapue of the Spanish maps, and the Ucayari of the =
natives. The Anava=20

of the old geographers is the Anauahu of Arrowsmith, and the Uanauhau or Gu=
anauhu of the=20

Indians. The desire of leaving no void in the maps, in order to give them a=
n appearance of=20

accuracy, has caused rivers to be created, to which names have been applied=
 that have not been=20

recognized as synonymous. It is only lately that travellers in America, in =
Persia, and in the Indies,=20



have felt the importance of being correct in the denomination of places. Wh=
en we read the travels=20

of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is difficult indeed to recognise in the lake of M=
recabo, the laguna of=20

Maracaybo, and in the Marquis Paraco the name of Pizarro, the destroyer of =
the empire of the=20

Incas.  The great tributary streams of the Amazon are designated by the mis=
sionaries by different=20

names in their upper and lower course. The Iza is called, higher up, Putuma=
yo, the Jupura=20

towards its source bears the name of Caqueta. The researches made in the mi=
ssions of the=20

Andaquies on the real origin of the Rio Negro have been the more fruitless =
because the Indian=20

name of the river was unknown. I heard it called Guainia at Javita, Maroa, =
and San Carlos.=20

Southey, in his history of Brazil, says expressly that the Rio Negro, in th=
e lower part of its course,=20

is called Guiani, or Curana, by the natives; in the upper part, Ueneya. It =
is the word Gueneya,=20

instead of Guainia; for the Indians of those countries say indifferently Gu=
aranacua or Ouaranacua,=20

Guarapo or Uarapo.  The sources of the Rio Negro have long been an object o=
f contention among=20

geographers. The interest we feel in this question is not merely that which=
 attaches to the origin of=20

all great rivers, but is connected with a crowd of=20


_
one tunic each, and one American army cap each. The tunic was to conform to=
 the recent Army=20

regulation for Red Cross tunics, and the trousers were to match; Henry look=
ed at me and received=20

a distress signal, but he ignored it and said nonchalantly, "When can we ha=
ve them?" The tailor=20

told us to call for a fitting in two weeks, but we were going to the front =
before that. That made no=20

difference; and then Henry came to the real point. "How much," he asked, "w=
ill these be?" The=20

tailor answered in francs and we quickly divided the sum into dollars. It m=
ade $100. "For both?"=20

asked Henry hopefully. "For each," answered the tailor firmly. There stood =
Mr. Hoppen, of=20

Morgans. There also stood Wichita and Emporia. Henry's eyes did not bat; Mr=
. Hoppen wore a=20

shimmering Sam Browne belt. Looking casually at it Henry asked:  "Shall we =
require one of=20

those?"  "Gentlemen are all wearing them, sir," answered the tailor.  "How =
much?" queried Henry.=20

"Well, you gentlemen are a trifle thick, sir, and we'll have to have them s=
pecially made, but I=20

presume we may safely say $14 supposed bifurcations of the Caqueta, the com=
munications=20

between the Rio Negro and the Orinoco, and the local fable of El Dorado, fo=
rmerly called Enim, or=20

the empire of the Grand Paytiti. When we study with care the ancient maps o=
f these countries, and=20

the history of their geographical errors, we see how by degrees the fable o=
f El Dorado has been=20

transported towards the west with the sources of the Orinoco. It was at fir=
st fixed on the eastern=20

declivity of the Andes, to the south-west of the Rio Negro. The valiant Phi=
lip de Urre sought for the=20

great city of Manoa by traversing the Guaviare. Even now the Indians of San=
 Jose de Maravitanos=20

relate that, on sailing to the north-east for fifteen days, on the Guape or=
 Uaupe, you reach a=20

famous laguna de oro, surrounded by mountains, and so large that the opposi=
te shore cannot be=20

discerned. A ferocious nation, the Guanes, do not permit the collecting of =
the gold of a sandy plain=20

that surrounds the lake. Father Acunha places the lake Manoa, or Yenefiti, =
between the Jupura=20

and the Rio Negro. Some Manoa Indians brought=20


_
sir!"  Henry did not even look at me, but lifted the wormwood to his lips a=
nd quaffed it. "Make two,"=20

he answered.  The world should not be unsafe for democracy if Wichita and E=
mporia could help it!=20

We went to a show that night with the feeling of guilt and shame one has wh=
o has betrayed his=20

family. That $114 with ten more to come for brown shoes, flickered in the s=
pot light and babbled=20

on the lips of the singers. They danced it in the ballet. Each of us was th=
inking with guilty horror of=20

how he would break the news of that uniform bargain to his wife. So we went=
 home tired that first=20

night, several slips of beaten gold. This nation, the name of which is stil=
l known on the banks of=20

the Urarira, between Lamalongo and Moreira, dwelt on the Yurubesh. La Conda=
mine is right in=20

saying that this Mesopotamia, between the Caqueta, the Rio Negro, the Yurub=
esh, and the=20

Iquiare, was the first scene of El Dorado. But where shall we find the name=
s of Yurubesh and=20

Iquiare, given by the Fathers Acunha and Fritz? I think I recognise them in=
 the rivers Urubaxi and=20

Iguari,* on some manuscript Portuguese maps which I possess. (* It may be w=
ritten Urubaji. The j=20
