CHAPTER VII  WHEREIN WE CONSIDER THE WOMAN PROPOSITION   It is curious how the 

human heart throws out homeseeking tendrils. As we crossed the Italian frontier and came back 

into France, keen longing for the Ritz--even the Ritz with its gloomy grandeur came to me, and 

Henry confessed that he was glad to get back to a country where a man could get a good 

refreshing bowl of onion soup! After dinner, our first evening at the Ritz, we were looking over the 

theatrical offerings advertised upon the wall by the elevator at the hotel, when whom should we 

meet but "Auntie," the patrician relative of the Gilded Youth. She recognized us in our civilian 

clothes, and it fell to me to make the fool blunder of complicating our formal greetings with gaiety. 

Auntie's troubled face would have caught Henry's quick sensitive eyes. But Auntie's voice brushed 

aside the levity of the opening.  "Haven't you heard--haven't you heard?" she asked. And we knew 

instinctively that something had happened to the Gilded Youth. And when one is in aviation 

something happening always is serious. It was Henry's kind voice that conveyed our sympathy to 

her. And she told us of the accident. Two mornings before, while making his first flight alone, from 

the training camp near Paris, something went wrong with his engine while he was but a thousand 

feet in the air--and over Neuilly. He had to glide down, and being over a town he could not make a 

landing. They took him from the wreck of his plane, to the hospital near by--fortunately an 

American Red Cross Hospital, where the people recognized him and sent for his aunt. All day and 

all night he had lain unconscious, and at noon had opened his eyes for a minute to find his aunt 

beside him. "I brought with me," said Auntie, in a tone so significantly casual that it arrested our 

attention before she added, "that capable young nurse, the first assistant--" As she spoke she 

caught Henry's eyes and held him from looking at me.  "You mean the one--" said Henry in a tone 

quite as casual as Auntie's while giving eye for eye.  "Yes, your pretty mid-western girl. She is with 

him now." Then Auntie lost Henry's eyes as tears brimmed into her own. "It has been twenty-six 

hours since we arrived at Neuilly. I shall return in an hour, and--"  "I wish," cried Henry, "I wish 

there was something we could do!"  Auntie caught our embarrassed desire to be of service yet not 

to assume. Her strong fine face lighted with something kind enough for a smile, as she answered: 

"Couldn't you go out and see him? I think no one else in Paris would be more welcome than you 

two!"  That puzzled us. She saw us looking our question at each other, and went on: "Life means 

more to him now than it ever has meant." She really smiled as she quoted: "'It means intensely 

and it means good!'" Auntie's tired eyes gathered us in again. "When you left Landrecourt last 

month he told me much about the voyage over here on the Espagne." The tired eyes left us to 

follow the crippled elevator boy who went pegging down the corridor as she continued: "about his 

days in Paris before he went back to his ambulance unit; about his meeting you that night near 

Douaumont,--at the first aid post and--and I know," she paused a second, pulled herself together 

and continued gently. "We must face things as they are. The boy's hours in this earth are short. He 

has other friends here, of course--old friends, but you--" again she stopped. "You will appreciate 

why when you see him."  So we gave up the poor travesty upon life that we should have seen 

behind the footlights for a glimpse into one of life's real dramas.  It was nearly midnight before we 

came to Neuilly and stood awkwardly beside the white cot in the little white room where the Gilded 

Youth was lying. How the gilding had fallen off! All white and broken he lay, a crushed wreck of a 

man, with the cluttering contrivances of science swathing him, binding him, encasing him, holding 

him miserably together while the tide of life ran out. But when he wakened he could smile. There 



was real gilding in that smile, the gilding of youth, but he only flashed his eyes upon us for a 

fleeting second in turning his smile to her--to the Eager Soul, to her who had brought some new 

incandescence into his life. Then we knew why his aunt had said that we should see him. He 

would have us who had witnessed the planting of the seed, know how it had flowered. His smile 

told us that also. He could lift no hand to us, and could speak but faintly. Yet his greeting held 

something princely in it--fine and sweet and brave. Then he did a curious thing. He began 

whistling very softly under his breath and between his teeth a queer little tune, that reminded one 

oddly of the theme of Tschaicovski's Symphony Pathetique--the first movement. As he whistled he 

turned from Henry and me and looked at the Eager Soul, who smiled back intelligently, and when 

she smiled he stopped. We could not understand their signals. But whatever it was so far as it 

pretended to a show of courage, we knew that it was a gorgeous bluff. In the fleeting glance that 

he gave us, he told us the truth; and we knew that he was pretending to the others that he did not 

know. We made some cheerful nothings in our talk, and would have gone but he held us. The 

Eager Soul looked at her watch, gave him some medicine, which we took to be a heart stimulant; 

for he revived under it, and said to me:  "Remember--that night at Douaumont?"  "Where you 

whistled the 'Meditation from Thais,' in the moonlight?"  "Yes," he murmured, "and we--watched--

the trucks--come out of the mist--full of life--and go into the mist,--toward death."  "Wonderful--

wasn't it!" sighed one of us.  "Symbolic," he whispered. And our eyes followed his to the vivid face 

of the Eager Soul, in the halo of her nurse's cap. She was exceedingly glorious, and animate and 

beautiful. And he was passing into the mist, out toward death. He saw that he had got the figure to 

me, and smiled. Then suddenly something came into his face from afar, and he seemed to know 

that his frail craft had mounted the out-going tide. Slowly, very slowly life began to fade from his 

face. Further and further from shore the tide was bearing him. We seemed to be on the pier. The 

Eager Soul even leaned forward and put out a pretty hand, and waved at him. He signalled back 

with a twitch of his lips that was meant for a smile. And then we at the pier lost the last gleam of 

life and saw only the broken bark, wearily riding the racing tide.  And then we turned from the pier 

and went our several ways back into the midst of life. We were going home, and getting ready to 

go home is a joyous proceeding. And there was another significance to our packing to leave Paris. 

It meant something more than a homeward journey; it meant that for the first time since we left 

Wichita and Emporia in midsummer we were turning our backs on war. It took a tug to make the 

turn. From all over the earth the war draws men to it like an insatiable whirlpool. And as we came 

nearer and nearer to war we had felt it swallow men into its vortex--men, customs, institutions, 

civilizations, indeed the age and epoch wherein we lived, we had felt moving into chaos--into 

nothing, to be reborn some day into we know not what, in the cataclysm out there on the front. We 

had seen it. But seeing it had revealed nothing. For many nights we had heard the distant roar of 

the hungry guns ever clamouring for more food, for the blood of youth, for the dreams of age, for 

the hopes of a race, for the creed of an era. And we left them still ravening, mad and unsated. And 

we were going away as dazed as we were when we came. But as we packed our things in Paris, 

the thrall of it still gripped us and the consciousness that we were leaving the war was as strong in 

our hearts as the joy we felt at turning homeward. But we got aboard the train and rode during the 

long lovely morning down the wide rich valley of the Seine, past Rouen, through Normandy with its 

steep hills which seem reflected in the sharp peaked roofs of its chateaux, and through musty 



mediaeval towns, in which it was hard to realize that modern industry was hiving. The hum of 

industry seemed badly out of key in a town with a cathedral whose architectural roots are a 

thousand years old, and whose streets have not yet been veined with sewers, and whose walls 

are gay with the facades of the fifteenth century. The whole face of the landscape, town and 

country side, seemed to us like the back drop of the first act in a comic opera, and we were forever 

listening for "The Chimes of Normandy!" Instead we heard the noon whistle. It was tremendously 

incongruous. How American humour cracks into sardonic ribaldry at the spectacle. The French are 

the least bit unhappy about this American humour. They don't entirely see it. Once outside of a 

poor French village near the war zone, that had been bombed from the German lines, bombed 

from the German airships and ravaged by fire and sword, some American soldiers, looking at the 

desolation and the ruin of the place, so grotesque in its gaping death, so hopeless in its pitiful 

finality, painted on a large white board, and nailed on a sign post just at the edge of the town this 

slogan:  "Watch Commercy Grow! Boost for the Old Town!"  But in that flash of humour the 

tragedy of Commercy stood revealed clearer than in a flood of tears!  We came at the end of the 

morning "to a port in France." From there we were to take the boat for England. And it seemed to 

us that the whole place was bent on the same errand. English soldiers going home on leave 

jammed the streets. They filled the hotels; they crowded into the shops. And the whole town was 

made over for them. "French Spoken Here" was the facetious sign someone had stuck on a 

postcard shop near the grey old church on the main thoroughfare. It is curious how the English put 

their trade mark upon the places they occupy. These French ports filled with British soldiers look 

more English than England. The English demand their own cooking, their own merchandise, their 

own tobacco, their own beer--which is stale, flat and unprofitable enough these days--and they 

demand their native speech. When he gets in sight of his native land the British Tommy quits 

saying "Donny mo-i, de tabac! Ma'mselle!" But bellows forth both loud and long, "I say, Lizz, 

gimme some makin's! and look alive, please!" So when we went to bed in our boat in a French 

port, and slept through a submarine zone, and waked up in an English port, there was no vast 

difference in the places. Today Southampton and Dover are much like Calais and Havre; for there 

the English do most congregate. But back of the French ports it is all France, and back of the 

English ports is England, and worlds lie between them. England, as one rides through it who lives 

beyond the seas, and uses the English tongue, always must seem like the unfolding of an old, old 

dream. England gives her step-children the impression that they have seen it all before! And they 

have; in Mother Goose, in Dickens, in Shakespeare, in Thackeray, in Trollope, in the songs of 

British poets, in the landscapes of British artists! At every turn of the road, in every face at the 

window, in every hedgerow and rural village is the everlasting reminder that we who speak the 

English tongue are bound with indissoluble links of our foster memories from the books and the 

arts, to ways of thinking and living and growing in grace that we call English. It is more than a 

blood or breed, more  When travellers judge only by their own sensations they differ from each 

other respecting the abundance of the mosquitos as they do respecting the progressive increase 

or diminution of the temperature. The state of our organs, the motion of the air, its degree of 

humidity or dryness, its electric intensity, a thousand circumstances contribute at once to make us 

suffer more or less from the heat and the insects. My fellow travellers were unanimously of opinion 

that Esmeralda was more tormented by mosquitos than the banks of the Cassiquiare, and even 



more than the two missions of the Great Cataracts; whilst I, less sensible than they of the high 

temperature of the air, thought that the irritation produced by the insects was somewhat less at 

Esmeralda than at the entrance of the Upper Orinoco. On hearing the complaints that are made of 

these tormenting insects in hot countries it is difficult to believe that their absence, or rather their 

sudden disappearance, could become a subject of inquietude; yet such is the fact. The inhabitants 

of Esmeralda related to us, that in the year 1795, an hour before sunset, when the mosquitos 

usually form a very thick cloud, the air was observed to be suddenly free from them. During the 

space of twenty minutes, not one insect was perceived, although the sky was cloudless, and no 

wind announced rain. It is necessary to have lived in those countries to comprehend the degree of 

surprise which the sudden disappearance of the insects must have produced. The inhabitants 

congratulated each other, and inquired whether this state of happiness, this relief from pain 

(feicidad y alivio), could be of any duration. But soon, instead of enjoying the present, they yielded 

to chimerical fears, and imagined that the order of nature was perverted. Some old Indians, the 

sages of the place, asserted that the disappearance of the insects must be the precursor of a 

great earthquake. Warm discussions arose; the least noise amid the foliage of the trees was 

listened to with an attentive ear; and when the air was again filled with mosquitos they were almost 

hailed with pleasure. We could not guess what modification of the atmosphere had caused this 

phenomenon, which must not be confounded with the periodical replacing of one species of 

insects by another.  After four hours' navigation down the Orinoco we arrived at the point of the 

bifurcation. Our resting place was on the same beach of the Cassiquiare, where a few days 

previously our great dog had, as we believe, been carried off by the jaguars. All the endeavours of 

the Indians to discover any traces of the animal were fruitless. The cries of the jaguars were heard 

during the whole night.* (* This frequency of large jaguars is somewhat remarkable in a country 

destitute of cattle. The tigers of the Upper Orinoco are far less bountifully supplied with prey than 

those of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres and the Llanos of Caracas, which are covered with herds of 

cattle. More than four thousand jaguars are killed annually in the Spanish colonies, several of 

them equalling the mean size of the royal tiger of Asia. Two thousand skins of jaguars were 

formerly exported annually from Buenos Ayres alone.) These animals are very frequent in the 

tracts situated between the Cerro Maraguaca, the Unturan, and the banks of the Pamoni. There 

also is found that black species of tiger* of which I saw some fine skins at Esmeralda. (* Gmelin, in 

his Synonyma, seems to confound this animal, under the name of Felis discolor, with the great 

American lion (Felis concolor) which is very different from the puma of the Andes of Quito.) This 

animal is celebrated for its strength and ferocity; it appears to be still larger than the common 

jaguar. The black spots are scarcely visible on the dark-brown ground of its skin. The Indians 

assert, that these tigers are very rare, that they never mingle with the common jaguars, and that 

they form another race. I believe that Prince Maximilian of Neuwied, who has enriched American 

zoology by so many important observations, acquired the same information farther to the south, in 

the hot part of Brazil. Albino varieties of the jaguar have been seen in Paraguay: for the spots of 

these animals, which may be called the beautiful panthers of America, are sometimes so pale as 

to be scarcely distinguishable on a very white ground. In the black jaguars, on the contrary, it is 

the colour of the ground which renders the spots indistinct. It requires to reside long in those 

countries, and to accompany the Indians of Esmeralda in the perilous chase of the tiger, to decide 



with certainty upon the varieties and the species. In all the mammiferae, and particularly in the 

numerous family of the apes, we ought, I believe, to fix our attention less on the transition from 

one colour to another in individuals, than on their habit of separating themselves, and forming 

distinct bands.  We left our resting place before sunrise on the 24th of May. In a rocky cove, which 

had been the dwelling of some Durimundi Indians, the aromatic odour of the plants was so 

powerful, that although sleeping in the open air, and the irritability of our nervous system being 

allayed by the habits of a life of fatigue, we were nevertheless incommoded by it. We could not 

ascertain the flowers which diffused this perfume. The forest was impenetrable; but M. Bonpland 

believed that large clumps of pancratium and other liliaceous plants were concealed in the 

neighbouring marshes. Descending the Orinoco by favour of the current, we passed first the 

mouth of the Rio Cunucunumo, and then the Guanami and the Puriname. The two banks of the 

principal river are entirely desert; lofty mountains rise on the north, and on the south a vast plain 

extends far as the eye can reach beyond the sources of the Atacavi, which lower down takes the 

name of the Atabapo. There is something gloomy and desolate in this aspect of a river, on which 

not even a fisherman's canoe is seen. Some independent tribes, the Abirianos and the 

Maquiritares, dwell in the mountainous country; but in the neighbouring savannahs,* bounded by 

the Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Negro, there is now scarcely any trace of a 

human habitation. (* They form a quadrilateral plot of a thousand square leagues, the opposite 

sides of which have contrary slopes, the Cassiquiare flowing towards the south, the Atabapo 

towards the north, the Orinoco towards the north-west, and the Rio Negro towards the south-east.) 

I say now; for here, as in other parts of Guiana, rude figures representing the sun, the moon, and 

different animals, traced on the hardest rocks of granite, attest the anterior existence of a people, 

very different from those who became known to us on the banks of the Orinoco. According to the 

accounts of the natives, and of the most intelligent missionaries, these symbolic signs resemble 

perfectly the characters we saw a hundred leagues more to the north, near Caycara, opposite the 

mouth of the Rio Apure. (See Chapter 2.18 above.)  In advancing from the plains of the 

Cassiquiare and the Conorichite, one hundred and forty leagues further eastward, between the 

sources of the Rio Blanco and the Rio Essequibo, we also meet with rocks and symbolical figures. 

I have lately verified this curious fact, which is recorded in the journal of the traveller Hortsman, 

who went up the Rupunuvini, one of the tributary streams of the Essequibo. Where this river, full of 

small cascades, winds between the mountains of Macarana, he found, before he reached lake 

Amucu, rocks covered with figures, or (as he says in Portuguese) with varias letras. We must not 

take this word letters in its real signification. We were also shewn, near the rock Culimacari, on the 

banks of the Cassiquiare, and at the port of Caycara in the Lower Orinoco, traces which were 

believed to be regular characters. They were however only misshapen figures, representing the 

heavenly bodies, together with tigers, crocodiles, boas, and instruments used for making the flour 

of cassava. It was impossible to recognize in these painted rocks* (the name by which the natives 

denote those masses loaded with figures) any symmetrical arrangement, or characters with 

regular spaces. (* In Tamanac tepumereme. (Tepu, a stone, rock; as in Mexican, tetl, a stone, and 

tepetl, a mountain; in Turco-Tatarian, tepe.) The Spanish Americans also call the rock covered 

with sculptured figures, piedras pintadas; those for instance, which are found on the summit of the 

Paramo of Guanacas, in New Grenada, and which recall to mind the tepumereme of the Orinoco, 



the Cassiquiare, and the Rupunuvini.) The traces discovered in the mountains of Uruana, by the 

missionary Fray Ramon Bueno, approach nearer to alphabetical writing; but are nevertheless very 

doubtful.  Whatever may be the meaning of these figures, and with whatever view they were 

traced upon granite, they merit the examination of those who direct their attention to the 

philosophic history of our species. In travelling from the coast of Caracas towards the equator, we 

are at first led to believe that monuments of this kind are peculiar to the mountain-chain of 

Encaramada; they are found at the port of Sedeno, near Caycara,* (* In the Mountains of the 

Tyrant, Cerros del Tirano.) at San Rafael del Capuchino, opposite Cabruta, and in almost every 

place where the granitic rock pierces the soil, in the savannah which extends from the Cerro 

Curiquima towards the banks of the Caura. The nations of the Tamanac race, the ancient 

inhabitants of those countries, have a local mythology, and traditions connected with these 

sculptured rocks. Amalivaca, the father of the Tamanacs, that is, the creator of the human race 

(for every nation regards itself as the root of all other nations), arrived in a bark, at the time of the 

great inundation, which is called the age of water,* when the billows of the ocean broke against 

the mountains of Encaramada in the interior of the land. (* The Atonatiuh of the Mexicans, the 

fourth age, the fourth regeneration of the world.) All mankind, or, to speak more correctly, all the 

Tamanacs, were drowned, with the exception of one man and one woman, who saved themselves 

on a mountain near the banks of the Asiveru, called Cuchivero by the Spaniards. This mountain is 

the Ararat of the Aramean or Semitic nations, and the Tlaloc or Colhuacan of the Mexicans. 

Amalivaca, sailing in his bark, engraved the figures of the moon and the sun on the Painted Rock 

(Tepumereme) of Encaramada. Some blocks of granite piled upon one another, and forming a 

kind of cavern, are still called the house or dwelling of the great forefather of the Tamanacs. The 

natives show also a large stone near this cavern, in the plains of Maita, which they say was an 

instrument of music, the drum of Amalivaca. We must here observe, that this heroic personage 

had a brother, Vochi, who helped him to give the surface of the earth its present form. The 

Tamanacs relate that the two brothers, in their system of perfectibility, sought, at first, to arrange 

the Orinoco in such a manner, that the current of the water could always be followed either going 

down or going up the river. They hoped by this means to spare men trouble in navigating rivers; 

but, however great the power of these regenerators of the world, they could never contrive to give 

a double slope to the Orinoco, and were compelled to relinquish this singular plan. Amalivaca had 

daughters, who had a decided taste for travelling. The tradition 


_
inheritance that comes from this English soil; it is the realization in life of a philosophy, the 

dramatization of a human creed. It may be understood, but not defined, yet it is as palpable and 

substantial in this earth as any material fact. Germany knows what this English philosophy means; 

and for half a century Germany has been preparing to combat it. Napoleon knew it, and believed 

in it, when he declared three-fourths of every fact is its spiritual value. France has it, new Russia is 

struggling for it. American life has it as an ancient inheritance, and as we Americans rode through 

the green meadows of England up from the coast to London, for ever reviewing familiar scenes 

and faces and aspects of life that we had never seen before, we realized how much closer than 

blood or geography or politics men grow who hold the same creed. So Henry, feeling that 

restraints no longer were necessary when we were as near home as England, began fussing with 

an Englishman about something a speaker had said in parliament the day before. We may love 

the French, like the ladies, God bless 'em! But we quarrel only with the English.  When we came to 

London we saw, even as we whirled through the grey old streets, surface differences between 

London and the other capitals of the Allies, so striking that they were marked contrasts. These 

differences marked the different reactions of personal loss upon the different nations. France 

expresses her loss in mourning; she relieves her emotions in visible grief. Italy does this also; but 

her losses have been smaller than the French losses and Italy's sorrow is less in evidence than is 

the woe of France. But England's master passion in this war is pride. "In proud and loving 

memory" is a phrase that one sees a hundred times every day in the obituary notices of those who 

have died for England. Ambassador Page tells this: He was asking a British matron about her 

family, severally, and when he inquired about the son, she replied, "Haven't you heard of the new 

honour that has come to us through him?" And to her friend's negative she returned: "He has been 

called upon to die for England!" Now that seems rather French in its dramatics than British. Yet it 

reflects exactly the British attitude. The women wear no mourning. They do not go about in bright 

colours by any means. Bright colours in the war distinguish the men. But the women do wear dark 

blues, lavenders and purples, dark wine colours and neutral tints of various hues. The shop 

windows of London are bright. There is a faint re-echo of the time when Great Britain said, 

"Business as usual." The busy life, the shopping crowds, the street throngs, and the heavy 

doubtless with a figurative meaning, that he broke their legs, to render them sedentary, and force 

them to people the land of the Tamanacs. After having regulated everything in America, on that 

side of the great water, Amalivaca again embarked, and returned to the other shore, to the same 

place from whence he came. Since the natives have seen the missionaries arrive, they imagine 

that Europe is this other shore; and one of them inquired with great simplicity of Father Gili, 

whether he had there seen the great Amalivaca, the father of the Tamanacs, who had covered the 

rocks with symbolic figures.  These notions of a great convulsion of nature; of two human beings 

saved on the summit of a mountain, and casting behind them the fruits of the mauritia palm-tree, 

to repeople the earth; of that national divinity, Amalivaca, who arrived by water from a distant land, 

who prescribed laws to nature, and forced the nations to renounce their migrations; these various 

features of a very ancient system of belief, are well worthy of attention. What the Tamanacs, and 

the tribes whose languages are analogous to the Tamanac tongue, now relate to us, they have no 

doubt learned from other people, who inhabited before them the same regions. The name of 

Amalivaca is spread over a region of more than five thousand square leagues; he is found 



designated as the father of mankind, or our great grandfather, as far as to the Caribbee nations, 

whose idiom approaches the Tamanac only in the same degree as the German approaches the 

Greek, the Persian, and the Sanscrit. Amalivaca is not originally the Great Spirit, the Aged of 

Heaven, the invisible being, whose worship springs from that of the powers of nature, when 

nations rise insensibly to the consciousness of the unity of these powers; he is rather a personage 

of the heroic times, a man, who, coming from afar, lived in the land of the Tamanacs and the 

Caribs, sculptured symbolic figures upon the rocks, and disappeared by going back to the country 

he had previously inhabited beyond the ocean. The anthropomorphism of the divinity has two 

sources diametrically opposite; and this opposition seems to arise less from the various degrees of 

intellectual culture, than from the different dispositions of nations, some of which are more inclined 

to mysticism, and others more governed by the senses, and by external impressions. Sometimes 

man makes the divinities descend upon earth, charging them with the care of ruling nations, and 

giving them laws, as in the fables of the East; sometimes, as among the Greeks and other nations 

of the West, they are the first monarchs, priest-kings, who are stripped of what is human in 


_
London, prove that London still is a great city--the greatest city in the world: and even the war, 

black and dread and horrible as it is, cannot overcome London, entirely. Something of the fact that 

she is the world's metropolis, more permanent than the war, somewhat apart from the war, and 

indeed above it, still lingers in the London consciousness, however remotely.  One must not 

imagine that London is unchanged. It is greatly changed, for the men are gone. One sees fewer 

men in London out of uniform than in Paris. And the Londoners one does see, all appear to be 

hurrying about war work. But it is the women constantly in evidence who have changed the face of 

London. Women keep the shops, conduct the busses, run the street cars, drive the trucks, sit on 

the seats of the horse-drays, deliver freight, manage railway trains, sweep the national divinities. 

Amalivaca was a stranger, like Manco-Capac, Bochica, and Quetzalcohuatl; those extraordinary 

men, who, in the alpine or civilized part of America, on the tablelands of Peru, New Grenada, and 

Anahuac, organized civil society, regulated the order of sacrifices, and founded religious 

congregations. The Mexican Quetzalcohuatl, whose descendants Montezuma* (* The second king 

of this name, of the race of Acamapitzin, properly called Montezuma-Ilhuicamina.) thought he 

recognized in the companions of Cortez, displays an additional resemblance to Amalivaca, the 

mythologic personage of savage America or the plains of the torrid zone. When advanced in age, 

the high-priest of Tula left the country of Anahuac, which he had filled with his miracles, to return 

to an unknown region, called Tlalpallan. When the monk Bernard de

at the railway stations, sell tickets, usher at the theaters, superintend factories, make munitions, lift 

great burdens before forges, plough, reap, and stack grain and grass on farms, herd sheep in 

waste places, hew wood and draw water, and do all of the world's work that man has ever done. 

Now, of course, women are doing these things elsewhere in the world. But London and England 

are man's domain. It seems natural to see the French women, and even the Italian women at 

work. Man is more or less the leisure class on the continent. But London is a man's town if on 

earth arrived in Mexico, the same questions were put to him, as those which were addressed to 

Father Gili two hundred years later, in the forests of the Orinoco; he was asked whether he came 

from the other shore (del otro lado), from the countries to which Quetzalcohuatl had retired.  The 

region of sculptured rocks, or of painted stones, extends far beyond the Lower Orinoco, beyond 

the country (latitude 7 degrees 5 minutes to 7 degrees 40 minutes, longitude 68 degrees 50 

minutes to 69 degrees 45 minutes) to which belongs what may be called the local fables of the 

Tamanacs. We

are not all dead--"they're just away." And they come back on leave. But life is not normal. War is 

abnormal, and there is an ever-urging desire of life to assume its normal function. So all over 

Europe we heard whispers about the moral break-down among the women of England. In England 

we were asked about the dreadful things that were happening in France. The things that were 

happening in France were not essentially evil things. One could imagine that if God thinks war is 

necessary for the solution of the world's terrible problems, He will have no trouble forgiving these 

lapses that follow in the wake of war in France. And in England, similarly we found that the moral 

break-down was not a moral break-down at all. The abnormal relation of the sexes arising out of 

war produced somewhat the same results that one found in France, but in different ways. In 

France too many strange men are billeted in the houses of the people. In England, too many 

homes are without men at all. And sheer social lonesomeness produces in humanity about the 

same conditions that arise when people are thrown in too close contact. There is a sort of social 

balance of nature, wherein normally desirable results are found. The girl working in the munition 

factories, working at top speed eight hours a day, filled with a big emotional desire to do her full 

duty to her country every second of the day, finds it easy in her eight hours of rest to fall in love 

with a soldier who is going out to offer his life for the between the Cassiquiare and the Atabapo 

(latitude 2 degrees 5 minutes to 3 degrees 20 minutes; longitude 69 to 70 degrees); and between 

the sources of the Essequibo and the Rio Branco (latitude 3 degrees 50 minutes; longitude 62 

degrees 32 minutes). I do not assert that these figures prove the knowledge of the use of iron, or 

that they denote a very advanced degree of culture; but even on the supposition that, instead of 

being symbolical, they are the fruits of the idleness of hunting nations, we must still admit an 

anterior race of men, very different from those who now inhabit the banks of the Orinoco and the 

Rupunuri. The more a country is destitute of remembrances of generations that are extinct, the 

more important it becomes to follow the least traces of what appears to be monumental. The 

eastern plains of North America display only those extraordinary circumvallations that remind us of 

the fortified camps (the pretended cities of vast extent) of the ancient and modern nomad tribes of 

Asia. In the oriental plains of South America, the force of vegetation, the heat of the climate, and 

the too lavish gifts of nature, have opposed obstacles still more powerful to the progress of human 

civilization. Between the Orinoco and the Amazon I heard no mention of any wall of earth, vestige 

of a dyke, or sepulchral tumulus; the rocks alone show us (and this through a great extent of 

country), rude sketches which the hand of man has traced in times unknown, and which are 

connected with religious traditions.  Before I quitted the wildest part of the Upper Orinoco, I 

thought it

so gladly. She is not a light woman. She is moved by deep and beautiful emotions. And if a 

marriage before he goes out to fight is inconvenient or impossible--the war made it so, and God 

will understand. Of course the idle woman, the vain woman, the foolish woman in these times in 

England finds ample excuse for her folly and vast opportunity to indulge her folly in considered in 

their connection with each other. All I could relate of our navigation from Esmeralda to the mouth 

of the Atabapo would be merely an enumeration of rivers and uninhabited places. From the 24th to 

the 27th of May, we slept but twice on land; our first resting-place was at the confluence of the Rio 

Jao, and our second below the mission of Santa Barbara,
