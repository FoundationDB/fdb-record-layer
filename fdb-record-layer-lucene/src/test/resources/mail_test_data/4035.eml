dracaena marginata Warren. In him were united not only the will and the ability to establish such a publication as this, but also the learning and insight which enabled him to forecast in a general the lyric note, imaginative fire, colour, melody, these were gifts that compensated the poet's poverty, his conjugal miseries, his lost eye, his faithless friends, his swarming dracaena marginata Warren. In him were united not only the will and the ability to establish such a publication as this, but also the learning and insight which enabled him to forecast in a general the lyric note, imaginative fire, colour, melody, these were gifts that compensated the poet's poverty, his conjugal miseries, his lost eye, his faithless friends, his swarming _
the two hemispheres. It is a part of the responsibility resting upon the molders and leaders of the 

thought and life of our time, and upon our Universities in particular, to see to it that these new 

forces, mighty for good or for evil, are directed aright._  _The fruitfulness of those scions of 

Western civilization which the Japanese have grafted upon their own stock is to-day the 

admiration of the world. In our wonder, let us not forget that that stock is the growth of centuries, 

and that it is rooted in a soil of racial character informed by ethical ideals which we are wont to 

regard, with arrogant self-complacency, as exclusively proper to Christianity, but which were, in 

fact, inculcated twenty-four centuries ago through precept and example by Gotama the 

Enlightened, or, as the Hindus called him, Gotama the Buddha. It has often been said that India 

has never influenced the development of humanity as a whole. Be that as it may, it now seems no 

less probable than strange that she is yet destined to do so, on the one hand, indirectly, through 

the influence of Indian Buddhism upon Japan, and, on the other, directly, by the diffusion in the 

West of a knowledge of her sacred writings, especially those of Vedantism and Buddhism. To 

judge the East aright, we must know not only what she is, but also how she has become what she 

is; know, in short, some of the principal phases of her spiritual history as they are reflected in her 

ancient literature, especially that of India. To interpret to the West the thought of the East, to bring 

her best and noblest achievements to bear upon our life_,--_that is to-day the problem of Oriental 

philology._  _The Harvard Oriental Series embodies an attempt to present to Western scholars, in 

trustworthy texts and translations, some of the greatest works of the Hindu literature and 

philosophy and religion, together with certain instruments, such as the Vedic Concordance or the 

History of the Beast-fable, for their Canterbury discourse of Chaucer's parson. The moral 

experience of a man of the world is summed up in the prose treatise on "The Four Ages of Man," 

by Philippe de Novare, chancellor of Cyprus. With this edifying work may be grouped the so-called 

_Chastiements_, counsels on education and conduct, designed for readers in general or for some 

special class--women, children, persons of knightly or of humble rank; studies of the virtues of 

chivalry, the rules of courtesy and of manners.[1] Other writings, the _Etats du Monde_, present a 

view of the various classes of society from a standpoint ethical, religious, or satirical, with warnings 

and exhortations, which commonly conclude with a vision of the last judgment and the pains of 

hell. With such a scene of terror closes the interesting _Poeme Moral_ of Etienne de Fougeres, in 

which the life of St. Moses, the converted robber, serves as an example to monks, and that of the 

converted Thais to ladies who are proud of their beauty. Its temper of moderation contrasts with 

the bitter satire in the _Bible_ by Guiot de Provins, and with many shorter satirical pieces directed 

against clerical vices or the infirmities of woman. The _Besant de Dieu_, by Guillaume le Clerc, a 

Norman poet (1227), preaches in verse, with eloquence and imaginative power, the love of God 

and contempt of the world from the texts of two Scripture parables--that of the Talents and that of 

the Bridegroom; Guillaume anticipates the approaching end of the world, foreshown by wars, 

pestilence, and famine, condemns in the spirit of Christian charity the persecution of the 

Albigenses, and mourns over the shame that has befallen the Holy Sepulchre.  [Footnote 1: Two 

works of the fourteenth century, interesting in the history of manners and ideas, may here be 

mentioned--the _Livre du Chevalier de la Tour-Landry_ (1372), composed for the instruction of the 

writer's daughters, and the _Menagier de Paris_, a treatise on domestic economy, 


_
account of the volumes completed or in progress may be found at the end of this book. Dr. Ryder, 

passing by for the present the more momentous themes of religion and philosophy, has in this 

volume attempted to show what the Indian genius, in its strength and in its weakness, could do in 

the field of literature pure and simple. The timeliness of the Series as a whole is an eloquent 

tribute to the discernment of my loved and unforgotten pupil and friend, his young wife.]  Among 

the preacher poets of the thirteenth century the most interesting personally is the minstrel 

RUTEBEUF, who towards the close of his gay though ragged life turned to serious thoughts, and 

expressed his penitent feelings with penetrating power. Rutebeuf, indeed--the Villon of his age--

deployed his vivid and ardent powers in many directions, as a writer of song and satire, of 

allegory, of fabliaux, of drama. On each and all he
