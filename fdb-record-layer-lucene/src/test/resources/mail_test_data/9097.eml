hunter. Bad man in tunnel--no spirit!  "Men go. Spirit no take um--bad man take um."  "Where are 

they now?" asked Tom. "Jove, if I could find them the secret would be solved!"  The woman 

looked fearfully around the hut and then whispered:  "You come--me show!"  "Bless my 

toothbrush!" cried Mr. Damon. "What is going to happen, Tom Swift?"  "I don't know," was the 

answer, "but something sure is in the wind. I guess I shot better than I knew when I killed that 

condor."     Chapter XX  Despair   Calling to a girl of about thirteen years to look after her baby, 

Masni slipped along up a rough mountain trail, motioning to Tom, Mr. Damon and Koku to follow. 

Or rather, the woman gave the sign to Tom, ignoring the others, who, naturally, would not be left 

behind. Masni seemed to have eyes for no one but the young inventor, and the manner in which 

she looked at him showed the deep gratitude she felt toward him for having saved her baby from 

the great condor.  "Come," she said, in her strange Indian tongue, which Tom could interpret well 

enough for himself now.  "But where are we going, Masni?" he asked. "This isn't the way to the 

tunnel."  "Me know. Not go to tunnel now," was her answer. "Me show you men."  "But which men 

do you mean, Masni?" inquired Tom. "The lost men, or the bad ones, who are making trouble for 

us?  Which men do you mean?"  Masni only shook her head, and murmured: "Me show." 

Probably Tom's attempt to talk her language was not sufficiently clear to her.  "My man--he good 

man," she said, coming to a pause on the rough trail after a climb which was not easy.  "Yes, I 

know he is," Tom said. "But he went on a strike with the others, Masni. He no work. He go on a 

'hit,' as Serato calls it," and Tom laughed.  "My man he good man--but he 'fraid," said the wife. "He 

want to tell you of bad mans, but he 'fraid. You save my baby, I no 'fraid. I tell."  "Oh, I see," said 

Tom. "Your husband would have given away the secret, only he's afraid of the bad men. He likes 

me, too?"  "Sure!" Masni exclaimed. "He want tell, but 'fraid. He go 'way, I tell."  Tom was not quite 

sure what it all meant, but it seemed that after his slaying of the condor both parents were so filled 

with gratitude that they wanted to reveal some secret about the tunnel, only Masni's husband was 

afraid. She, however, had been braver.  "Something is going to happen," said Tom Swift. "I feel it 

in my bones!"  "Bless my porous plaster!" cried Mr. Damon. "I hope it isn't anything serious." 

"We'll see," Tom went on.  They resumed their journey up the mountain trail. It wound in and out in 

a region none of them had before visited.  Though it could not be far from the tunnel, it was almost 

a strange country to Tom.  Suddenly Masni stopped in a narrow gorge where the walls of rock 

rose high on either hand. She seemed looking for something. Her sharp, black eyes scanned the 

cliff and then with an exclamation of satisfaction she approached a certain place. With a quick 

motion she pulled aside a mass of tangled vines, and disclosed a path leading down through a V 

shaped crack in the cliff.  "Mans down there," she said. "You go look."  For a moment Tom 

hesitated. Was this a trap? If he and his friends entered this narrow and dark opening might not 

the Indian woman roll down some rock back of them, cutting off forever the way of escape?  Tom 

turned and looked at Masni. Then he was ashamed of his suspicion, for the honest black face, 

smiling at him, showed no trace of guile.  "You go--you see for the French.  He knew exactly what 

they were aiming at, and he spoke very plainly to the chief of the Cayugas.  "Brethren," said he, 

"this is an affair of the greatest importance to you.  Nothing less than all your lands and your best 

hunting-places are concerned.  You are to be shut off entirely from us and the rest of your 

brethren, the Pennsylvanians and the Virginians, who can always supply you with goods at a 

much lower rate than the French ever did or ever could do. Under our protection you are, and ever 



will be, safer and better treated than under the French, who are your implacable enemies.  The 

writing on this piece of lead is sufficient of itself to convince you of their villainous designs."  The 

Governor of New York afterwards sent the plate to England, where it attracted great attention, for it 

showed quite clearly what the designs of the French were.  By this time English statesmen began 

to consider whether the step they had taken in giving back Cape Breton to France so hastily was 

not a mistake.  But something to offset it might still be done. Although Louisburg was no longer 

theirs, yet they had the power to retrieve much of the prestige and many of the advantages they 

had lost.  Governor Shirley dinned constantly into their ears the value of settling an English 

population in Nova Scotia to counter-balance the French Acadians who were planted there.  So at 

last King George was induced to issue a proclamation offering to all officers and private men 

retired from the Army or Navy, and to many others, a free passage to Nova Scotia, besides 

supporting {184} them for a year after landing and giving them arms, ammunition, and a grant of 

land to build a dwelling.  Parliament having voted 40,000, in the summer of 1749 more than 2500 

settlers, with their families, arrived at Chebucto, now rechristened in honour of the Earl of Halifax. 

The commander of the expedition and the chief of the new colony was Colonel Edward Cornwallis, 

a man both able and lovable.  Owing to his care, a beautiful city gradually arose on the shore of 

the splendid harbour, afterwards to be crowned by the famous citadel of Halifax.  Soon after 

Cornwallis's arrival he issued a proclamation in French and English to the Acadians calling upon 

them to assist the new settlers.  He did not fail to remind them that while they had so long enjoyed 

possession of their lands and the free exercise of their religion, they had been secretly aiding King 

George's enemies.  But His Majesty would forgive and forget all this if they were at once to take 

the oath of allegiance and act in future as British subjects.  Some 13,000 Frenchmen were at this 

time settled in the ten villages of Acadia.  To the northward the French had built a fort of five 

bastions which they called Beausjour, and another one much similar at Baie Verte.  Their idea was 

to keep up communication with Louisburg until they could strike a blow against the English and get 

back Acadia again into their own hands.  It was at Fort Beausjour that the priestly traitor Le Loutre 

continued to create dissatisfaction and sow the seeds of revolt amongst the thrifty, ignorant {185} 

Acadians, who otherwise would have been happy and contented.  Their minds filled with Le 

Loutre's threats and promises, they refused to take the oath of allegiance, and even to supply the 

English settlers with labour, timber, or provisions, though good prices for these were offered. 

Cornwallis warned them.  "You will allow yourselves," he said, 


_
"Come on!" cried Tom. "I believe we're on the track of the mystery!"  He led the way, followed by 

Mr. Damon, while Koku came next and then Masni. It could be no trap since she entered it herself. 

The path widened, but not much. There was only room for one to walk at a time. The trail twisted 

and turned, and Tom was wondering how far it led, when, from behind him, came the cry of the 

woman:  "Watch now--no fall down."  Tom halted around a sharp turn, and stood transfixed at the 

sight which met his gaze. He found himself looking out through a crack in the face of a sheer stone 

cliff that went straight down for a hundred feet or more to a green-carpeted valley.  Tom was 

standing in a narrow cleft of rock--the same rock through which they had made their way. And at 

the foot of the cliff was a little encampment of Indians. There were a dozen huts, and wandering 

about them, or sitting in the shade, were a score or more of Indians.  "There men from tunnel," 

said Masni, and, as he looked, wondering, Tom saw some of the workers he knew. One 

especially, was a laborer who walked with a peculiar limp.  "The missing men!" gasped the young 

inventor.  "Bless my almanac!" cried Mr. Damon. "Where?"  "Here," answered Tom. "If you 

squeeze past me you can see them."  Mr. Damon did so.  "How did they get here?" asked the odd 

man, as he looked down in the little valley where the missing ones were sequestered.  "That's 

what we've got to find out," Tom said. "At any rate here they are, and they seem to be enjoying life 

while we've been worrying as to what had become of them. How did they get here, Masni?"  "Me 

show you. Come."  "Wait until I take another look," said Tom.  "Be careful they don't see you," 

cautioned Mr. Damon.  "They can't very well. The cleft is screened by bushes."  Tom looked down 

once more on the group of men who had so mysteriously disappeared. The little valley stretched 

out away from the face of the cliff, through which, by means of the crack, or cleft in it, Tom and the 

others had come. Tom looked down the wall of rock. It was as smooth as the side of a building, 

and offered no means of getting down or up. Doubtless there was an easier entrance to the valley 

on the other side. It was like looking down into some vast hall through an upper window or from a 

balcony.  "And those men have been in hiding, or been hidden here, ever since they disappeared 

from the tunnel," said Mr. Damon.  "It doesn't look as though they were detained by force," Tom 

remarked. "I think they are being paid to stay away. How did they get here, Masni?"  "Me show 

you. Come!"  They went back along the trail that led through the split in the rock, until they had 

come to the place where the natural curtain of vines concealed the entrance. Tom took particular 

notice of this place so he would know it again.  Then Masni led them over the mountain, and this 

time Tom saw that they were approaching the tunnel. He recognized some places where he had 

taken samples of rock from the outcropping to test the strength of his explosive.  Reaching a 

certain wild and desolate place, Masni made a signal of caution. She seemed to be listening 

intently.  Then, as if satisfied there was no danger, she parted some bushes and glided in, 

motioning the others to follow.  "Now I wonder what's up," Tom mused.  He and the others were 

soon informed.  Masni stopped in front of a pile of brush. With a few vigorous motions of her arms 

she swept it aside and revealed a smooth slab of rock. In the centre was what seemed to be a 

block of metal Masni placed her foot on this and pressed heavily.  And those watching saw a 

strange thing.  The slab of rock tilted to one side, as if on a pivot, revealing a square opening 

which seemed to lead through solid stone. And at the far end of the opening Tom Swift saw a 

glimmer of light.  Stooping down, he looked through the hole thus strangely opened and what he 

saw caused him to cry out in wonder.  "It's the tunnel!" he cried. "I can look right down into the 



tunnel. It's the incandescent lights I see. I can look right at the ledge of rock where I kept watch 

that day, and where I saw--where I saw the face of Waddington!" he cried.  "It wasn't a dream after 

all. This is a shaft connecting with the tunnel. We didn't discover it because this rock fits right in 

the opening in the roof. It must have been there all the while, and some blast brought it to light. Is 

this how the men got out, or were taken out of the tunnel, Masni?" Tom asked.  "This how," said 

the Indian woman. "See, here rope!"  She pawed aside a mound of earth, and disclosed a rope 

buried there, a rope knotted at intervals. This, let down through the hole in the roof of the tunnel, 

provided a means of escape, and in such a manner that the disappearance of the men was most 

mysterious.  "I see how it is!" cried Tom. "Some one interested, Waddington probably, who knew 

about this old secret shaft going down into the earth, used it as soon as our blasting was opened 

that far. They got the men out this way, and hid them in the secret valley."  "But what for?" cried 

Mr. Damon.  "To cripple us! To cause the strike by making our other workers afraid of some evil 

spirit! The men were taken away secretly, and, doubtless, have been kept in idleness ever since--

paid to stay away so the mystery would be all the deeper. Our rivals finding they couldn't stop us 

in any other way have taken our laborers away from us."  "Bless my meal ticket! It does look like 

that!" cried Mr. Damon.  "Of course that's the secret!" cried Tom. "Blakeson & Grinder, or some of 

their tools--probably the bearded man or Waddington--found out about this shaft which led down 

into our tunnel. They induced the first ten men to quit, and when Tim went to get the fuse the rope 

was let down, and the men climbed up here, one after the other. Those Indians can climb like cats. 

Once the ten were out the shaft was closed with the rock, and the ten men taken off to the valley 

to be secreted there.  "The same was done with the next fifteen, and, I suppose, if the strike hadn't 

come, more of our workers would have been induced to leave in this way. They're probably being 

better paid than when earning their wages; and their relatives must know where they are, and also 

be given a bonus to keep still. No wonder they didn't make a fuss.  "And no wonder we couldn't 

find any opening in the tunnel roof. This rock must fit in as smoothly as a secret drawer in the kind 

of old desk where missing wills are found in stories."  "You say you saw Waddington, or the 

bearded man?" asked Mr. Damon.  "At the time," replied Tom, "I thought it was a dream. Now I 

know it wasn't. He must have opened the shaft just as I awakened from a doze. He saw me and 

closed it again. He may have been getting ready then to take off more of our men, so as to scare 

the others. Well, we've found out the trick."  "And what are you going to do next?" asked Mr. 

Damon.  "Get those missing men back. That will break the hoodoo, and the others will come back 

to work. Then we'll get on the trail of Waddington, or Blakeson & Grinder, and put a stop to this 

business. We know their secret now."  "You mean to get the men out of the secret valley, Tom?" 

"Yes. There must be some other way into it than down the rock where we were. How about it, 

Masni?" and he inquired as to the valley. The Indian woman gave Tom to understand that there 

was another entrance.  "Well, close up this shaft now before some one sees us at it--the bearded 

man, for example," Tom suggested. He took another look down into the tunnel, which was now 

deserted on account of the strike, and then Masni pressed on the mechanism that worked the 

stone. She showed Tom how to do it.  "Just a counter-balanced rock operating on the same 

principle as does a window," Tom explained, after a brief examination. "Probably some of the old 

Indian tribes made this shaft for ceremonial purposes. They never dreamed we would drive a 

tunnel along at the bottom of it. The shaft probably opened into a cave, and one of our blasts 



made it part of the tunnel. Well, this is part of the secret, anyhow. Much obliged to you, Masni!" 

The Indian woman had indeed revealed valuable information.  They covered the secret rock with 

brush, as it had been, hid the rope and came away. But Tom knew how to find the place again. 

Events moved rapidly from then on. The Titus brothers were more than astonished when Tom told 

them what he had learned.  Masni had told him how to get into the secret valley by a round about, 

but easy trail, and thither Tom, the contractors, Mr. Damon and some of the white tunnel workers 

went the next day.  The sequestered men, taken completely by surprise, tried to bolt when they 

saw that they were discovered, and then, shamefacedly enough, admitted their part in the trick. 

They would not, however, reveal who had helped them escape from the tunnel. Threats and 

promises of rewards were alike unavailing, but Tom and his employers knew well enough who it 

was. The tunnel workers seemed rather tired of living in comparative luxury and idleness, and 

agreed to come back to their labors.  They packed up their few belongings, mostly cooking pots 

and pans, and marched out of the valley to the village at Rimac.  And so the strike was broken. 

The reappearance of the missing men, in better health and spirits than when they went away, 

acted like magic. The other men, who had missed their wages, crowded back into the shaft, and 

the sounds of picks and shovels were heard again in the tunnel.  Whether the missing ones told 

the real story, or whether they made up some tale to account for their absence, Tom and his 

friends could not learn. Nor did the bearded man (if he it were who had helped in the plot), nor any 

representative of Blakeson & Grinder appear. The work on the tunnel was resumed as if nothing 

had happened. But Tom arranged a bright light so it would reflect on the spot in the roof where the 

moving rock was, so that if the evil face of the bearded man, or of Waddington, appeared there 

again, it would quickly be seen. A search of the neighborhood, and diligent inquiries, failed to 

disclose the presence of any of the plotters.  And then, as if Fate was not making it hard enough 

for the tunnel contractors, they encountered more trouble. It was after Tom had set off a big blast 

that Tim Sullivan, after inspecting what had happened, came out to ask.  "I soy, Mr. Swift, why 

didn't yez use more powder?"  "More powder!" cried Tom. "Why, this is the most I have ever set 

off."  "Then somethin's wrong, sor. Fer there's only a little rock down. Come an' see fer yersilf." 

Tom hastened in. As the foreman had said, the effect of the blast was small indeed. Only a little 

rock had been shaled off. Tom picked up some of this and took it outside for examination.  "Why, 

it's harder than the hardest flint we've found yet," he said. "The powder didn't make any impression 

on it at all. I'll have to use terrific charges."  This was done, but with little better effect. The 

explosive, powerful as it was, ate only a little way into the rock. Blast after blast had the same poor 

effect.  "This won't do," said Job Titus, despairingly, one day.  "We aren't making any progress at 

all. There's a half mile of this rock, according to my calculations, and at this rate we'll be six 

months getting through it. By that time our limit will be up, and we'll be forced to give up the 

contract What can we do, Tom Swift?"     Chapter XXI  A New Explosive   The young inventor was 

idly handling some pieces of the very hard rock that had cropped out in the tunnel cut. Tom had 

tested it, he had pulverized it (as well as he was able), he had examined it under the microscope, 

and he had taken great slabs of it and set off under it, or on top of it, charges of explosive of 

various power to note the effect. But the results had not been at all what he had hoped for. 

"What's to be done, Tom?" repeated the contractor.  "Well, Mr. Titus," was the answer, "the only 

thing I see to do is to make a new explosive."  "Can you do it, Tom?"  The reply was characteristic. 



"I can try."  And in the days that followed, Tom began work on a new line. He had brought from 

Shopton with him much of the needful apparatus, and he found he could obtain in Lima what he 

lacked.  A message to his father brought the reply that the new ingredients Tom needed would be 

shipped.  "The kind of explosive we need to rend that very hard rock," the young inventor 

explained to the Titus brothers, "is one that works slowly."  "I thought all explosions had to be as 

quick as a flash," said Walter.  "Well, in a sense, they do. Yet we have quick burning and slow-

burning powders, the same as we have fuses. A quick-burning explosive is all right in soft rock, or 

in soil with rock and earth mingled. But in rock that is harder than flint if you use a quick explosive, 

only the outer surface of the rock will be scaled off.  "If you take a hammer and bring it down with 

all your force on a hard rock you may chip off a lot of little pieces, or you may crack the rock, but 

you won't, under ordinary circumstances, pulverize it as we want to do in the tunnel.  "On the other 

hand, if you take a smaller hammer, and keep tapping the rock with comparatively gentle blows, 

you will set up a series of vibrations, that, in time, will cause the hard rock to break up into any 

number of small pieces.  "Now that is the kind of explosive I want--one that will deal a succession 

of constant blows at the hard rock instead of one great big blast."  "Can you make it, Tom?"  "Well, 

I don't know. I'll do the best I can."  From then on Tom was busy with his experiments.  Work on 

the tunnel did not cease while he was searching for a new explosive. There was plenty of the old 

explosive left and charges of this were set off as fast as holes could be drilled to receive it. But 

comparatively little was accomplished. Sometimes more rock would be loosed than at others, and 

the native laborers, now seemingly perfectly contented, would be kept busy. Again, when a heavy 

blast would be set off hardly a dozen dump cars could be filled.  But the work must go on. Already 

the time limit was getting perilously close, and the contractors did not doubt that their rivals were 

only waiting for a chance to step in and take their places.  Nothing more had been seen or heard 

of the bearded man, Waddington, or Blakeson & Grinder. But that the rival firm had not given up 

was evidenced by the efforts made in New York to cripple, financially, the firm in which Tom was 

interested. In fact, at one time the Titus brothers were so tied up that they could not get money 

enough to pay their men. But Tom cabled his father, who was quite wealthy, and Mr. Swift loaned 

the contractors enough to proceed with until they could dispose of some securities.  It might be 

mentioned that Tom was to get a large sum if the tunnel were completed on time, so it was to his 

interest and his father's, to bring this about if he could.  Tom kept on with his powder experiments. 

Mr. Damon helped him, for that gentleman had succeeded in putting the affairs of the wholesale 

drug business on a firm foundation, and there was no more trouble about getting the supplies of 

cinchona bark to market. The natives seemed to have taken kindly to the eccentric man, or 

perhaps it was the reputation of Tom Swift and his electric rifle that induced them to work hard.  It 

must not be supposed that Professor Bumper was idle all this while.  He came and went at odd 

times, accompanied by his little retinue of Indians, a guide and a native cook. He would come back 

to the tunnel camp, where he made his headquarters, travel stained, worn and weary, with 

disappointment showing on his face.  "No luck," he would report. "The hidden city of Pelone is still 

lost."  Then he would retire to his tent, to pour over his note-books, and make a new translation of 

the inscription on the golden plates. In a day or so, refreshed and rested, he would prepare for 

another start.  "I'll find it this time, surely!" he would exclaim, as he marched off up the mountain 

trail. "I have heard of a new valley, never before visited by a white man, in which there are some 



old ruins. I'm sure they must be those of Pelone."  But in a week or so he would come back, worn 

out and discouraged again.  "The ruins were only those of a native village," he would say. "No 

trace of an ancient civilization there."  The professor took little or no interest in the tunnel, though 

he expressed the hope that Tom and his friends would be successful. But industrial pursuits had 

no charm for the scientist. He only lived to find the hidden city which was to make him famous.  He 

heard the story of the queer shaft leading down into the bore under the mountain, and, for a time, 

hoped that might be some clue to the lost Pelone. But, after an examination, he decided it was but 

the shaft to some ancient mine which had not panned out, and so had been abandoned after 

having been fitted with a balanced rocky door, perhaps for some heathen religious rite.  There 

seemed to be no further trouble among the Indian tunnel workers. Those who had disappeared--

who had, seemingly, gone willingly up the knotted rope to hide themselves in the valley--kept on 

with their work. If they told their fellows why and where they had gone, the others gave no sign. 

The evil spirits of the tunnel had been exorcised, and there was now peace, save for the blasts 

that were set off every so often.  Tom tried combination after combination, testing them inside and 

outside the tunnel, always seeking for an explosive that would give a slow, rending effect instead 

of a quick blow, the power of which was soon lost. And at last he announced:  "I think I have it!" 

"Have you? Good!" cried Job Titus.  "Yes," Tom went on, "I've got a mixture here that seems to 

give just the effect I want. I tried it on some small pieces of rock, and now I want to test it on some 

large chunks.  Have you brought any down lately?"  "Yes, we have some big slabs in there." 

Some large pieces of the hard rock, which had been brought down in a recent blast, were taken 

outside the tunnel, and in them one afternoon Tom placed, in holes drilled to receive it, some of 

his new explosive. The rocks were set some distance away from the tunnel camp, and Tom 

attached the electric wires that were to detonate the charge.  "Well, I guess we're ready," 

announced the young inventor, as he looked about him.  The tunnel workers had been allowed to 

go for the day, and in a log shack, where they would be safe from flying pieces of rock, were Tom, 

Mr. Damon and the two Titus brothers.  Tom held the electric switch in his hand, and was about to 

press it.  "This explosive works differently from any other," he explained. "When the charge is fired 

there is not instantly a detonation and a bursting. The powder burns slowly and generates an 

immense amount of gas. It is this gas, accumulating in the cracks and crevices of the rock, that I 

hope will burst and disintegrate it. Of course, an explosion eventually follows, as you will see. Here 

she goes!"  Tom pressed the switch and, as he did so, there was a cry of alarm from Mr. Damon. 

"Bless my safety match, Tom!" cried the old man. "Look!  Koku!"  For, as the charge was fired, the 

giant emerged from the woods and calmly took a seat on the rock that was about to be broken up 

into fragments by Tom's new explosive.     Chapter XXII  The Fight   "Get off there, Koku!"  "Stand 

up!"  "Run!"  "Get out of the way! That's going up!"  Thus cried Tom and his friends to the big, 

good-natured, but somewhat stupid, giant who had sat down in the dangerous spot. Koku looked 

toward the hut, in front of which the young inventor and the others stood, waving their hands to 

him and shouting.  "Get up! Get up!" cried Tom, frantically. The powder is going off, Koku!"  "Can't 

you stop it?" asked Job Titus.  "No!" answered Tom. "The electric current has already ignited the 

charge. Only that it's slow-burning it would have been fired long ago. Get up, Koku!"  But the giant 

did by people who find it to their interest to lead you astray.  It is only out of pity for your situation 

and your inexperience in the ways of government that we condescend to reason with you. 



Otherwise the question would not be reasoning, but commanding and being obeyed."  He was 

very patient with them.  He told them that they had been for more than thirty-four years the 

subjects of the King of Great Britain.  "Show now that you are grateful for his favours and ready to 

serve your King when your services are required.  Manage to let me have here in ten days fifty of 

your people to assist the poor to build their houses to shelter them from the bad weather.  They 

shall be paid in ready money and fed on the King's provisions."  Shortly thereafter Le Loutre 

descended from craft to the crime of bloodshed.  He aroused the native Indians of the province, 

known as the Micmacs, against the English newcomers.  He sent them out stealthily to slay and to 

destroy.  Twenty Englishmen were surprised and captured at Canso while gathering hay.  Eight 

Indians, pretending to barter furs, went on board two English ships and tried to surprise them. 

Several of the sailors were killed.  A saw-mill had been built near Halifax.  Six {186} unsuspecting 

men went out unarmed to hew some timber.  Four were killed and scalped, one was captured, and 

one escaped.  So frequent became the Indian attacks that the men of Halifax formed themselves 

into a militia, and a sentry paced the streets every night.  Cornwallis offered 100 for the head of Le 

Loutre.  Ten guineas were offered for an Indian, living or dead, or for his scalp.  It now became 

necessary also to build a fort to counterbalance the Fort Beausjour of the French.  The latter was 

erected on the western bank of a little stream called the Missiquash which the French claimed as 

the boundary between Canada and Acadia.  Opposite, at Chignecto, Colonel Lawrence was sent 

with 400 men to build the English fort.  Le Loutre and his Acadians did their best to prevent the 

English landing and building the fort which became known as Fort Lawrence.  The commander of 

this post was named Captain Howe, a man of charming manners who spoke French fluently. 

Howe reasoned with the stubborn Acadians, many of whom saw the good sense of his remarks, 

and in a short time the captain became extremely popular. All this Le Loutre saw with misgivings. 

He felt that Howe was obtaining an influence amongst the Acadians, and so marked him down for 

destruction.  One bright autumn day a Frenchman in the dress of an officer advanced to the 

opposite side of the stream waving a white handkerchief.  Howe, ever polite, advanced to meet 

him.  As he did so, some Indians who were in ambuscade pointed their guns at him and shot him 

dead.  La Corne, the French commandant, was filled {187} with shame and horror at this 

treacherous murder.  He would like to have got rid of Le Loutre, but the priest was too strong for 

him. His influence at Quebec was great, as it was amongst the Acadian people, who dreaded his 

fierce anger.  Notwithstanding all this, there were a number of Acadians who at last consented to 

take the oath of allegiance to King George.  When the French Governor at Quebec heard of their 

doing so, he issued a proclamation that all the Acadians must swear loyalty to France and be 

enrolled in the Canadian militia, or suffer the penalty of fire and sword.  By way of rejoinder, the 

English Governor of Nova Scotia proclaimed that if any Acadian, taking the oath of allegiance to 

King George, should afterwards be found fighting amongst the French soldiers, he would be shot. 

Thus were the poor Acadians between two fires.  A considerable number of them removed their 

settlements to the Canadian side of the boundary.  Some travelled even as far as Quebec.  But 

the majority who remained continued to cause great anxiety to the English authorities in Nova 

Scotia.  In 1754 the French planned an invasion of Nova Scotia, and Halifax was filled with alarm. 

For they knew that in the absence of the English fleet, Cape Breton could send a force in a few 

hours to overrun the country.  As for provisions, were not the Acadians there to furnish them to the 



French invaders?  In forty-eight hours 15,000 armed Acadians could be summoned to Fort 

Beausjour.  The outlying English forts would be destroyed and {188} Halifax starved into 

surrender.  When this had been captured, New England would be the next victim.  So reasoned 

Lawrence and Governor Shirley of Massachusetts.  Taking counsel together, they resolved to 

strike a blow instantly before troops from France or Quebec could arrive. They would seize Fort 

Beausjour and drive the French out of the isthmus.  Two thousand men were raised and the 

command given to an English officer, Colonel Monckton.  On the 1st June 1755 the English war-

party arrived in Chignecto Bay.  No longer was the gallant La Corne commandant at Fort 

Beausjour; another, dishonest and incompetent, ruled the French stronghold.  His name was 

Vergor.  Vergor thought little of patriotism, but only of his purse and how much money he could 

make by defrauding his King. When he saw the English ships approach, Vergor issued a 

proclamation to the Acadians round about to hasten to his defence.  Fifteen hundred responded, 

and three hundred of these he took into the fort. The others he ordered to retire into the woods 

and stealthily harass the enemy.  While the New Englanders prepared to launch their force, the 

French spent the time trying to strengthen their bastions.  The strong, simple Acadians, 

accustomed to hard labour, were set to work.  Over them stood Le Loutre in his shirt-sleeves with 

a pipe in his mouth, encouraging them to toil.  But in spite of his zeal and his promises, so huddled 

and exposed was their condition inside the fort, that many Acadians deserted.  {189}  Duly the 

bombardment began.  When it was at its height, and Vergor was hourly expecting help from 

Louisburg, a letter arrived to say that assistance could not come from that quarter.  An English 

squadron was cruising in front of Louisburg harbour, and so prevented the French frigates from 

putting out to sea.  When this disquieting news leaked out at Beausjour, more Acadians became 

disheartened, and in spite of the threats launched against them, deserted by dozens.  The 

bombardment continued.  Next morning at breakfast a shell from an English mortar crashed 

through the ceiling of a casemate, killing three French officers and an English captain who had 

been taken prisoner.  Vergor saw that he had begun to strengthen his fort too late.  There was 

now no hope--the guns of the English were too near.  He despatched a flag of truce and 

surrendered Fort Beausjour.  Having got Fort Beausjour, henceforward to be known as Fort 

Cumberland, into his hands, the victorious Monckton sent summonses to the other French 

stronghold at Baie Verte to surrender.  Seeing the situation hopeless, the French commandant 

complied, and the campaign was over.  Immediate danger to English settlers in Nova Scotia was 

happily removed for ever.  And now we come to a tragedy--the most pathetic passage in Canada's 

history.  It is known as the expulsion of the Acadians.  You have seen the dilemma in which the 

English found themselves.  They could not trust the Acadians, nor could they {190} spare an army 

large enough to render treachery harmless.  On the other hand, they could not treat all those 

thousands of people as rebels, for the great majority of them had not fought against them at 

Beausjour and elsewhere, but had remained quiet in their villages.  The long patience of the 

English was now almost worn out.  Yet once again Governor Lawrence urged them to take the 

oath.  Once again they stubbornly refused.  What else could be done?  Nothing.  So the decree of 

exile went forth.  Ignorant of the trades and callings by which they could earn a livelihood in those 

countries, the Acadians could not be sent to France or England.  Colonists they were, and the 

sons of colonists, suited only for a colonial life.  On banishment they would be distributed in 



batches amongst the English colonies along the Atlantic coast.  It was a terrible thing to do, and 

many hearts, even among the rude soldiers, beat warmly for the fate of the unhappy Acadians. 

Those who had taken the oath were safe in their homesteads.  A number escaped into the woods. 

As for the rest, the military officers were given their instructions.  At Beausjour 400 men were 

seized. Without warning the people, Colonel Winslow marched rapidly to Grandpr.  He summoned 

the men of the village to meet him in the chapel, and there he read them the decree of 

banishment.  In vain they tried to escape; the doors were shut and guarded by English soldiers. 

The people of village after village were seized, until 6000 souls had been gathered {191} together. 

Many of the Acadians never believed that the threat would be carried out.  For a long time they 

had to wait for transports to bear them away.  Many had to be placed on the ships by force.  Old 

and young, men, women, and children, were marched to the beach.  Sometimes members of the 

same family became separated from each other, never to meet again.  But the soldiers did their 

best to perform their painful duty as humanely as they could.  No unnecessary harshness was 

permitted.  From Minas, Chignecto, and Annapolis ship after ship carried away their weeping 

burdens to Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North and South 

Carolina, and Georgia.  One of the vessels, hailing from Annapolis, was captured by its cargo of 

exiles, who overpowered the crew and made themselves masters of the ship.  This they sailed up 

the river St. John, where they ran it ashore and escaped to Quebec.  A few decided to struggle 

southwards, however, until they reached Louisiana, where some of their descendants are to this 

day.  Others, after months and even years, returned again to Acadia, where, when Quebec and 

the French flag had fallen, they were no longer a danger to the Government.  Such of the 

Acadians who reached Quebec were treated very coldly and almost died of famine.  It is said that 

they were reduced to four ounces of bread per day, and sought in the gutters of Quebec to 

appease their hunger. Many were forced to eat boiled leather during the greater part of the winter. 

As if this were not enough, smallpox broke out amongst them, and {192} many entire families were 

destroyed.  Such, alas! was the fate of men "whose attachment to their mother-country was only 

equalled by her indifference."  The expulsion of the Acadians may seem to us a cruel act, but it 

was forced upon the English by the hardest necessity--the necessity of self-protection.     {193} 

CHAPTER XIII  TERRIBLE FIGHTS OVER THE BORDER  The Marquis de Jonquire was 

released at last from his English prison and sailed away to succeed Galissonire as Governor of 

Canada.  Jonquire's term of office is looked back upon with shame by the people of Canada, but is 

it strange that the servants of King Louis the Fifteenth in any quarter of the world where the French 

flag yet flew should be animated by low motives and a desire for gain?  See what an example their 

monarch set them!  Jonquire was an able man, but he was mercenary, and thought only of lining 

his own pockets and those of his creatures with the profits of the Canadian fur trade. With him 

went Francis Bigot to fill the important office of Intendant.  Bigot's is one of the most infamous 

names in French Canadian annals.  He was a lawyer, ambitious, intelligent, and fond of luxury and 

display.  Yet with all his intelligence he fell easily a prey to the wiles of a certain Madame Pan, who 

turned the King's service to her private advantage.  Servants, lackeys, upstarts were, by her 

influence, placed in responsible positions.  If they happened to be ignorant and dishonest, it was 

no bar to their promotion. Taxes were multiplied and the {194} poor people of Canada were made 

to suffer.  Bigot and his official band of robbers held office to the last moment of French dominion 



in Canada, but Jonquire died in the midst of his peculations and money-making schemes.  In 1752 

his successor, the Marquis Duquesne, appeared on the scene. Before setting out from France, the 

new Governor had been ordered to arrest the pretensions of the English to the Ohio and western 

region and drive them from the territory.  No English were to be allowed to carry on trade there. 

Duquesne began by sending out 300 Canadian Militia to build a French fort on Lake Erie, the 

command of which was afterwards given to Legardeur de St. Pierre.  A second fort was built 

twenty miles away.  In the meantime the English colonists continued to cast their eyes lovingly on 

this great and fertile region to the west.  Almost every month exploring parties went out, and 

returned full of enthusiastic reports of its commercial advantages.  By and by a body was formed 

called the Ohio Company, including amongst its members many of the leading men of Virginia.  To 

this Company King George granted 500,000 acres, on condition that 100 families should be 

settled on the territory within seven years and that a fort should be built.  Seeing this, the 

Pennsylvanians became jealous of Virginia and formed plans to secure the Ohio region for 

themselves.  Each told different and conflicting stories to the Indians.  The Virginians tried to stir 

up suspicion against the Pennsylvanians, {195} and the Pennsylvanians retorted by creating 

distrust of the Virginians.  The result of all this was that the tribes, who up to now had been faithful 

to England, began to look suspiciously upon the actions and the policy of both these colonies.  All 

this, of course, was playing into the hands of the French.  An English fort or two was built, but in 

spite of the efforts of the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, very little was done 

for several years to assert English sovereignty. The qualities the Indians admire are vigour and 

courage.  When the tribes saw the bold and daring efforts of Canada to Frenchify the western 

country, they were naturally led to range themselves on the Canadian side.  All that happened 

during the next few years, of the battles and skirmishes, the forts that were taken, and the 

massacres that were carried out, does not properly belong to Canadian history.  It must, however, 

be mentioned that it was at this time, when Governor Duquesne in his citadel at Quebec was 

rejoicing at the prospect of bringing the western region under French rule, that we first hear of a 

young Virginian whose name was destined to be world famous.  The name of this youth was 

George Washington.  He was only twenty-one years of age when Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia 

sent him to expostulate with a party of French Canadians who had just captured an English trading 

fort.  Getting no satisfaction from the Commandant there, young Washington went on to Fort Le 

Breuf, where, as we have seen, Legardeur de St. Pierre was in charge.  {196} St. Pierre received 

Washington courteously, but could not give him any satisfaction.  The French were there, and 

there they meant to stay, in spite of all the English protests.  It was now plain that there was 

serious trouble looming ahead.  All these proceedings being reported to England, at last, after 

many delays, King George's ministers decided to send a large force to America to drive the 

French back across the Canadian border.  The command of this force was given to General 

Braddock, a stern and peppery old soldier, wholly ignorant of Indian warfare.  Before Braddock 

could cross the Atlantic with his regiments, English and French were at each other's throats in 

earnest.  The French had built Fort Duquesne, and Colonel Washington, with a force of regulars 

and backwoodsmen, was sent to capture it.  A bloody battle was fought, in which Washington was 

defeated; and now the Indians were more than ever on the French side. But the schemes and 

labour of the last three years had undermined Governor Duquesne's health, and a new Viceroy 



appeared in Quebec. This was the Marquis de Vaudreuil, a native of Canada, whose father had 

formerly also been Governor.  Vaudreuil entered with spirit upon the duties of his office.  He 

needed all his faculties, for stirring times were in prospect. General Braddock and his Englishmen 

were in the north awaiting soldiers who were crossing the Atlantic.  The French were also resolved 

to maintain what their Canadian advance guard had won. Field-Marshal Baron Dieskau was 

appointed to command six regiments of French {197} soldiers who left their native shores in a 

squadron of fourteen battleships, four frigates, and many transports.  You must remember that 

during all this time there had been no war. If you had asked any of the French courtiers or 

ambassadors they would have told you that perfect peace existed between the two nations.  But 

that was only a diplomatic fiction.  At all events, whatever was happening in Europe between Old 

France and Old England, on the other side of the great ocean New France and New England were 

engaged in a life-and-death conflict.  It was not strange that the hand of both mother-countries was 

extended to help them.  Only if England could have looked into the future five-and-twenty years 

and seen her ungrateful American children tearing down her noble old flag with taunts and insults, 

perhaps she might not have given her help or spilt her blood so freely to protect America from the 

French.  After all, it may be as well that nations do not know all the evils that are to happen.  Their 

course is to do their duty manfully and honestly for the present; posterity can take care of itself. 

Moreover, the separation of America from England was no real evil, because that separation was 

to build the foundation of Canada's greatness in the British Empire and loyalty to the British crown 

and flag.  On the arrival of General Braddock the various colonial Governors held a consultation. 

They decided that the three forts, Duquesne, Niagara, and Crown Point, at the head of Lake 

Champlain, should be captured.  We have already seen that another {198} French fort, Beausjour, 

was doomed to destruction.  It was while Beausjour was being surrounded by Monckton and his 

New Englanders that the other expeditions were setting out for their destinations.  Braddock 

decided to take Fort Duquesne himself.  Governor Shirley led the expedition against Niagara, and 

Colonel William Johnson was ordered to take Crown Point.  Braddock took 1000 English veterans 

and 1200 Virginian Militia into the heart of the wilderness.  The commander of Fort Duquesne was 

Contrecoeur.  When he was told the size of Braddock's army he saw little hope of standing a 

siege, but he might intercept the English soldiers in the woods.  It was a splendid opportunity for 

the kind of warfare Indians loved.  Two hundred Frenchmen and 500 redskins were sent to lie in 

ambush on the trail which Braddock would take with drums beating and fifes playing.  On a 

beautiful July day the scarlet-coated regiments of Braddock moved on unconscious to their doom. 

Every moment they looked to see the great walls of the Fort Duquesne burst upon their gaze. 

Through the forest they came to the river, the Monongahela, and forded it.  Hardly had they 

crossed, when a strange apparition sprang into the middle of the wide woodland path.  He wore 

war-paint and flaming feathers, but in spite of this dress he was really a French officer.  He flung 

his right arm into the air as a signal, and instantly the forest rang with savage yells.  A shower of 

bullets, fired by unseen hands, fell upon the advancing English.  Astonished and taken at such a 

disadvantage, they yet did not hesitate to return the fire.  The intrepid French leader who had 

given the {199} signal so openly, paid for that act with his life; but it was not easy to fight, however 

valiantly, against a hidden foe.  Braddock and his officers thought it cowardly to fight behind trees; 

they charged hither and thither in pursuit 


_
greeting to Tom and the others, who dared not approach closer to warn him, for the explosion 

would occur any second now.  Then Mr. Damon had an inspiration.  "Call him to come to you, 

Tom!" shouted the odd man. "He always comes to you in a hurry, you know. Call him!"  Tom acted 

on the suggestion at once.  "Here, Koku!" he cried. "Come here, I want you! Kelos!"  This last was 

a word in the giant's own language, meaning "hurry." And Koku knew when Tom used that word 

that there was need of haste. So, though he had sat down, evidently to take his ease after a long 

tramp through the woods, Koku sprang up to obey his master's bidding.  And, as he did so, 

something happened. The first spark from the fuse, ignited by the electric current, had reached the 

slow-burning powder. There was a crackle of flame, and a dull rumble. Koku sprang up from the 

big stone as though shot. What he saw and heard must have alarmed him, for he gave a mighty 

jump and started to run, at the same time shouting:  "Me come, Master!"  "You'd better!" cried the 

young inventor.  Koku got away only just in time, for when he was half way between the group of 

his friends and the big rock, the utmost force of the explosion was felt. It was not so very loud, but 

the power of it made the earth tremble.  The rock seemed to heave itself into the air, and when it 

settled back it was seen to be broken up into many pieces.  Koku looked back over his shoulder 

and gave another tremendous leap, which carried him out of the way of the flying fragments, some 

of which rattled on the roof of the log hut.  "There!" cried Tom. "I guess something happened that 

time!  The rock is broken up finer than any like it we tried to shatter before. I think I've got the 

mixture just right!"  "Bless my handkerchief!" cried Mr. Damon. "Think of what might have 

happened to Koku if he had been sitting there."  "Well," said Tom, "he might not have been killed, 

for he would probably have been tossed well out of the way at the first slow explosion, but 

afterward--well, he might have been pretty well shaken up. He got away just in time."  The giant 

looked thoughtfully back toward the place of the experimental blast.  "Master, him do that?" he 

asked.  "I did," Tom replied. "But I didn't think you'd walk out of the woods, just at the wrong time, 

and sit down on that rock."  "Um," murmured the giant. "Koku--he--he--Oh, by golly!" he yelled. 

And then, as if realizing what he had escaped, and being incapable of expressing it, the giant with 

a yell ran into the tunnel and stayed there for some time.  The experiment was pronounced a great 

success and, now that Tom had discovered the right kind of explosive to rend the very hard rock, 

he proceeded to have it made in sufficiently large quantities to be used in the tunnel.  "We'll have 

to hustle," said Job Titus. "We haven't much of our contract time left, and I have reason to believe 

the Peruvian government will not give any extension. It is to their interest to have us fail, for they 

will profit by all the work we have done, even if they have to pay our rivals a higher price than we 

contracted for. It is our firm that will pocket the loss."  "Well, we'll try not to have that happen," said 

Tom, with a smile.  "If you're going to use bigger charges of this new explosive, Tom, won't more 

rock be brought down?" asked Walter Titus.  "That's what I hope."  "Then we'll need more laborers 

to bring it out of the tunnel."  "Yes, we could use more I guess. The faster the blasted rock is 

removed, the quicker I can put in new charges."  "I'll get more men," decided the contractor. 

"There won't be any trouble now that the hoodoo of the missing workers is solved. I'll tell Serato to 

scare up all his dusky brethren he can find, and we'll offer a bonus for good work."  The Indian 

foreman readily agreed to get more laborers.  "And get some big ones, Serato," urged Job Titus. 

"Get some fellows like Koku," for the giant did the work of three men in the tunnel, not because he 

was obliged to, but because his enormous strength must find an outlet in action.  "Um want mans 



like him?" asked the Indian, nodding toward the giant. He and Koku were not on good terms, for 

once, when Koku was a hurry, he had picked up the Indian (no mean sized man himself) and had 

calmly set him to one side.  Serato never forgave that.  "Sure, get all the giants you can," Tom 

said. "But I guess there aren't any in Peru."  Where Serato found his man, no one knew, and the 

foreman would not tell; but a day or so later he appeared at the tunnel camp with an Indian so 

large in size that he made the others look like pygmies, and many of them were above the 

average in height, too.  "Say, he's a whopper all right!" exclaimed Tom. "But he isn't as big or as 

strong as Koku."  "He comes pretty near it," said Job Titus. "With a dozen like him we'd finish the 

tunnel on time, thanks to your explosive."  Lamos, the Indian giant, was not quite as large as 

Koku.  That is, he was not as tall, but he was broader of shoulder.  And as to the strength of the 

two, well, it was destined to be tried out in a startling fashion.  In about a week Tom was ready 

with his first charges of the new explosive. The extra Indians were on hand, including Lamos, and 

great hopes of fast progress were held by the contractors.  The charge was fired and a great mass 

of broken rock brought down inside the tunnel.  "That's tearing it up!" cried Job Titus, when the 

fumes had blown away, the secret shaft having been opened to facilitate this. "A few more shots 

like that and we'll be through the strata of hard rock."  The Indians, Koku and Lamos doing their 

share of the work, were rushed in to clear away the debris, so another charge might be fired as 

soon as possible. This would be in a day or so. The contract time was getting uncomfortably close. 

Blast after blast was set off, and good progress was made.  But instead of half a mile of the extra 

hard rock the contractors found it would be nearer three quarters.  "It's going to be touch and go, 

whether or not we finish on time," said Mr. Job Titus one afternoon, when a clearance had been 

made and the men had filed out to give the drillers a chance to make holes for a new blast.  Tom 

was about to make a remark when Tim Sullivan came running out of the tunnel, his face showing 

fright and wonder.  "What's up now, I wonder," said Mr. Titus. "More men missing?"  "Quick! Come 

quick!" cried the Irishman. "Thim two giants is fightin' in there, an' they'll tear th' tunnel apart if we 

don't stop 'em. It's an awful fight! Awful!"     Chapter XXIII  A Great Blast   Hardly comprehending 

what the Irish foreman had said, Tom Swift, the Titus brothers and Mr. Damon followed Tim 

Sullivan back into the tunnel. They had not gone far before they heard the murmur of many voices, 

and mingled with that were roarings like those of wild beasts.  "That's thim!" cried Tim. "They're 

chawin' each other up!"  "Koku and that Indian giant fighting!" cried Tom. "What's it all about?" 

"Don't ask me!" shouted Tim. "They've been on bad terms iver since they met." This was true 

enough, for one giant was jealous of the other's power, and they were continually trying feats of 

strength against one another. Probably this had culminated in a fight, Tom concluded.  "And it will 

be some fight!" mused the young inventor.  Hurrying on, Tom and his companions came upon a 

strange and not altogether pleasant sight. In an open place in the tunnel, where the lights were 

brightest, and in front of the rocky wall which offered a bar to further progress and which was soon 

to be blasted away, struggled the two giants.  With their arms locked about one another, they 

swayed this way and that--a struggle between two Titans. Of nearly the same height and bigness, 

it was a wrestling match such as had never been seen before. Had it been merely a friendly 

became at length huddled together in a panic, shooting, if they shot at all, blindly and without aim. 

In vain did the General's aide-de-camp, Washington, urge him to scatter his men singly under 

cover.  Braddock, on horseback, galloped fearlessly in every direction ordering the ranks to 



advance.  Not until four horses had been shot dead beneath him did he order a retreat.  The 

command had scarcely passed his lips ere a bullet pierced his body, and he fell, to rise no more. 

His last words were, "We shall know better how to deal with them another time."  The retreat soon 

became a disgraceful flight.  Arms, baggage, and artillery were abandoned.  Yelling Indians 

pursued them, only stopping in order to scalp the helpless wounded.  Had it not been for the hope 

of plunder, very few of the British forces would have escaped death or captivity.  Cannons, stores, 

arms, and papers fell into the hands of the victorious French.  Upwards of sixty British officers had 

been killed, and of all Braddock's army less than half took refuge in the English Fort Cumberland. 

Tidings of Braddock's defeat were carried by the swiftest couriers to Canada, and there caused 

much rejoicing.  The Marquis de Vaudreuil sent the good news off at once to his King, but his letter 

never reached its destination.  The ship that bore it, _Le {200} Pierre Alexandre_, was overhauled 

by an English man-of-war in August, and the captain threw overboard the bag of Canadian letters. 

Not till nearly two months after the battle had been fought did the news of the victory reach France 

by way of England.  But it was otherwise on the American side of the border.  It put an end at once 

to Shirley's expedition against Niagara.  For a time it was thought that the attack on Crown Point 

would also be given up.  It might have been had it been entrusted to another man than Sir William 

Johnson.  Johnson was a settler on the Upper Hudson River.  He had married Mollie Brant, sister 

of the celebrated Chief Brant of the Mohawks, who had acquired great influence with the Iroquois 

tribes in his locality, and it was on his account that the Mohawks refrained from joining the French. 

Johnson was not a skilled soldier, but he was wise and daring.  Braddock's papers, which had 

fallen into the hands of Governor Vaudreuil at Quebec, convinced him that Crown Point would be 

attacked.  Baron Dieskau was sent with 3500 men, half of them Canadian farmers, to go to the 

defence of Crown Point.  Johnson had behind him some 5000 men, raw Militia from 

Massachusetts and Connecticut.  Before attacking Crown Point, Johnson deemed it prudent to 

build another fort on the Hudson, known as Fort Edward; from this fort he marched to the foot of a 

large lake, to which he gave the name of his sovereign, and there built Fort George.  He was still 

engaged in building it when the French general marched upon Fort Edward.  A scout brought 

{201} Johnson the news, and immediately he despatched 1000 men to oppose his defence. 

Dieskau, remembering the success of the manoeuvres against the hapless Braddock, thought to 

repeat them here.  He arranged to keep his own men out of sight amongst the trees and bushes 

until the enemy should pass by.  Had this plan been carried out it is probable that none of the 

English forces would have escaped alive.  But the redskins set up their war-whoops a little too 

soon, and the English, seeing that they were about to fall into an ambuscade, beat an instant 

retreat upon Fort Edward.  Dieskau now made a hasty resolve to bring the whole strength of his 

forces to bear upon Fort George.  Johnson had made this fort of great strength, protecting it by 

forming trees into a sort of breastwork, from behind which his cannons and musketry could be 

used with fatal effect, but Dieskau was not to be turned aside.  He ordered his troops to fling 

themselves on the fort.  Legardeur de St. Pierre was killed.  Dieskau led forth the French veterans 

unsupported, leaving the Canadians and Indians scattered behind the trees.  These, you will 

remember, were precisely the tactics which had led to Braddock's defeat.  The soldiers advanced 

gallantly, and, like the English before Fort Duquesne, were mowed down like grass.  Dieskau's 

body was pierced by three bullets.  A Canadian who attempted to drag him from under the walls of 



the fort was shot dead, falling across his General's legs. None now came to his assistance.  The 

French were beaten back and Fort George was saved.  The New England troops left their 

defences. General Dieskau, while leaning {202} against a tree, suffering from the wounds he had 

received, was fired at and again wounded by a renegade French Canadian, who some years 

before had deserted. Dieskau reproached him for firing on a wounded man, but the fellow 

answered that it was better to kill the devil than be killed by him. The French commander was 

carried to Johnson's own tent and treated kindly.  The Iroquois wanted to torture him to death, but 

Johnson sternly refused.  For this victory Johnson was made a Baronet and presented with a 

purse of 5000.  He had begun his career as a private in the army, and had risen to distinction from 

sheer force of character.  As for Dieskau, he never recovered from his wounds, and although he 

was carried back to France, it was only as a bedridden invalid, to die.  The French still held the 

positions at Niagara and Crown Point. Three out of the four English expeditions had failed to 

achieve their purpose, the French remained undisputed masters of the Ohio valley, and their 

victory over Braddock enabled them to attack the undefended frontiers of Virginia and 

Pennsylvania.  During the winter of 1755-6 French war-parties from Fort Duquesne repeatedly 

attacked the settlements of the English, behaving very cruelly, and killing or carrying away as 

prisoners more than 1000 souls.  In spite of these temporary successes of the French, Vaudreuil 

and the Indians were not happy.  All this fighting had drawn the farmers away from the soil, and 

the harvest was very scanty.  The necessaries of life became very dear, but, worse than all, 

dishonesty and corruption were eating out {203} the very heart of Canada.  The Intendant Bigot 

was at the height of his infamy; he descended to every trick of rascality to achieve his ends.  Trade 

had almost ceased, the supply of beef given out, and the people were reduced to eat horseflesh. 

As the famine increased the Governor ordered flour to be given to the people; crowds attended at 

the bakers' shops struggling to be served.  At first they were given one pound apiece, afterwards 

only half a pound.  Owing to the scarcity of money, the promises to pay, written on cards, were 

made to pass as currency.  Bigot began to issue what were called ordinances; he issued these 

notes recklessly.  Money was sent from time to time from France, but it was not enough to fill the 

need.  The value of the paper money went down and down, and when England finally acquired 

Canada it was found that 41,000,000 livres of ordinances were in circulation.  Bigot got up a 

Company to import commodities from France and to buy up all the grain in the country districts. 

The poor people had to deal with this Company and to pay their charges. The supplies for the 

King's service had to be bought from the Company in Quebec.  The citizens could procure bread 

only through the Company's stores, which in the two leading cities were known as "La Friponne" 

or "The Cheat."  It was in this way that gigantic frauds were committed which paralysed the colony 

only to enrich a few individuals.  Canada was costing France 15,000,000 francs a year, and 

France had already spent upon her 80,000,000 francs, but, distressed as she herself was, she did 

not grudge these sums to her colony.  {204}  In the spring of 1756 the people welcomed with joy 

the arrival of a fresh fleet bearing 1000 soldiers, a

to look upon. But it needed only a glance into the faces of either giant to show that it was a 

struggle in deadly earnest.  Back and forth they reeled over the rocky floor of the tunnel, bones 

and sinews cracking. One sought to throw the other, and first, as Koku would gain a slight 

advantage, his friends would call encouragement, while, when Lamos seemed about to triumph, 

the Indians favoring him would let out a yell of triumph.  For a few minutes Tom and his friends 

watched, fascinated.  Then they saw Koku slip, while Lamos bent him farther toward the earth. 

The Indian giant raised his big fist, and Tom saw in it a rock, which the big man was about to bring 

down on Koku's head.  "Look out, Koku!" yelled Tom.  Tom's giant slid to one side only just in time, 

for the blow descended, catching him on his muscular and a large sum of money.  Almost as great 

a boon King Louis bestowed upon Canada when he sent her the new Commander-in-Chief of the 

Canadian army, the Marquis de Montcalm.  This hero was forty-six years old, a splendid soldier, of 

high character, culture, and determination.  Could Canada be saved to the flag of the lilies?  If so, 

surely it was the virtuous Montcalm who could achieve this great task.     {205}  CHAPTER XIV 

HOW THE GALLANT WOLFE TOOK QUEBEC  If we were to tell the story of Canada faithfully for 

the next few years, it would be only of further battles, sieges, skirmishes, and massacres between 

the French and English colonists, aided by savage Indian warriors.  Never before had Canada 

boasted so many French soldiers as were now arrayed under the command of Montcalm.  He fell 

upon Oswego and destroyed 


_
And then Koku gathered himself for a mighty effort. His face flamed with rage at the unfair trick. 

"Bless my bath sponge!" cried Mr. Damon. "This is awful!"  "They must stop!" said Job Titus. "We 

can't have them fighting like this. It is bad for the others. If it were in fun it would be all right, but 

they are in deadly earnest.  They must stop!"  "Koku, stop!" called Tom. "You must not fight any 

more!"  "No fight more!" gasped the giant, through his clenched teeth. "This end fight!"  With a 

mighty effort he broke the hold of Lamos' arms.  Then stooping suddenly he seized his rival about 

the middle, and with a tremendous heave, in which his muscles stood out in great bunches while 

his very bones seemed to crack, Koku raised Lamos high in the air. Up over his head he raised 

that mass of muscle, bone and flesh, squirming sent the English Earl of Loudoun, no match for the 

French commander, and afraid to strike an overwhelming blow.  Loudoun at last sailed away for 

Halifax with his army, thinking to make another attack by and by on Louisburg, still in French 

hands.  A terrible mistake this of Loudoun's, and just the opportunity Montcalm looked for.  The 

French had built a strong fortress at Ticonderoga, and now that the danger of Loudoun's army was 

removed, 6000 of their troops moved swiftly out of the fortress and attacked Fort William Henry. 

Undaunted by the great force brought against him, the commander, Colonel Munro, answered 

Montcalm's summons to surrender by saying that he would {206} defend his post to the death. 

The French planted their guns and the siege commenced.  Day and night the wooden ramparts of 

Fort William Henry were 


_
wriggling, trying in vain to save itself.  Up and up Koku raised Lamos as the murmur of those 

watching grew to a shout of amazement and terror. Never had the like been seen in that land for 

generations. Up and up one giant raised the other. Then calling out something in his native tongue 

Koku hurled the other from him, clear across the tunnel and up against the opposite rocky wall. 

The murmuring died to frightened whispers as Lamos fell in a shapeless heap on the floor.  "Ah!" 

breathed Koku, stretching himself, and extending his brawny arms. "Fight all over, Master."  "Yes, 

so it seems, Koku," said Tom, solemnly, "but you have killed him. Shame on you!" and he spoke 

bitterly.  Job Titus had hurried over to the fallen giant.  "He isn't dead," he called, "but I guess he 

won't wrestle or fight any more. He's badly crippled."  "And him no more try to blow up tunnel, 

either," said Koku in his hoarse voice. "Me fix: him! No more him take powder, and make tunnel all 

bust."  "What do you mean, Koku?" asked Tom. "Is that why you fought him? Did he try to wreck 

the tunnel?"  "So him done, Master. But Koku see--Koku stop. Then um fight."  "Be jabbers an' I 

wouldn't wonder but what he was right!" cried Tim Sullivan, excitedly. "I did see that beggar." and 

he pointed to Lamos, who was slowly crawling away, "at the chist where I kape balls.  Munro, 

brave Scotsman that he was, hoped vainly that the English garrison at Fort Edward would come to 

his rescue, but their commander was afraid to send them over.  He knew that there were nearly 

2000 bloodthirsty redskins roaming at large in the woods. They dreaded the tomahawk and 

scalping-knife more than the sword and musket.  Well did they know what their fate would be if 

they fell into the hands, wounded or prisoners, of those relentless savages.  So at last one 

sweltering August day Munro realised that no hope remained.  He could hold out no longer.  His 

fort was nearly a mass of ruins, and reluctantly he hoisted the white flag asking Montcalm for 

terms of capitulation.  The French commander allowed the brave Munro and his soldiers to march 

out with the honours of war, pledging himself to protect them from his savage followers.  Alas! 

Montcalm had reckoned without his host.  He might as well have tried to fetter the summer breeze 

that blew across Lake George as to balk his redskin allies of their destined prey.  They thirsted for 

the blood of the English.  They could not understand the French code of honour.  Of terms of 

capitulation they knew nothing.  The soldiers of the garrison, with their wives and children, with a 

French escort, filed slowly through the woods on their way to a refuge at Fort Edward. 


_
but I thought nothin' of it at th' time. What did he try t' do, Koku?"  Then the giant explained in his 

own language, Tom Swift translating, for Koku spoke English but indifferently well.  "Koku says," 

rendered Tom, "that he saw Lamos trying to put a big charge of powder up in the place where the 

balanced rock fits in the secret opening of the tunnel roof.  The charge was all ready to fire, and if 

the giant had set it off he Indians, sending up a terrible war-yell, darted {207} upon them.  One of 

the most dreadful massacres in history now took place.  The soldiers could do nothing to defend 

themselves, because they had given up their muskets to the French.  They were scalped by 

dozens and hundreds.  Helpless women were brained by hatchets and little children were dashed 

to death against the trunks of trees.  At the risk of their lives, Montcalm
