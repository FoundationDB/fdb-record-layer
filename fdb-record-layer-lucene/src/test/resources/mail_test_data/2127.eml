Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the 

Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of 

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, 

middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and 

donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 

with the assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring 

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 

2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and 

permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the 

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see 

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.  Information 

about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state 

of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Foundation's 

EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at 

http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 

are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The 

Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its 

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is 

located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email 

business@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the 

Foundation's web site and official page degree of its declivity, the _perpendicular height_ cannot 

be less than seventy-five feet. The circumference of the base, including the feet of three parapets, 

measured one thousand one hundred and fourteen feet. One of these parapets extends from the 

base to the summit, and can be ascended, though with difficulty, on horseback. The other two, 

after rising thirty or forty feet, terminate in a kind of triangular platform. Its top is level, and at the 

time I visited it, was so completely covered with weeds, bushes, and trees of most luxuriant 

growth, that I could not examine it as well as I wished. Its diameter, I judged, must be one hundred 

and fifty feet. On its sides and summit, are many large trees of the same description, and of equal 

dimensions with those around it. One beach-tree, near the top, measured ten feet nine inches in 

circumference. The earth on one side of the tree, was three and a half feet lower than on the 

opposite side. This fact will give a good idea of the degree of the mound's declivity. An oak, which 

was lying down on one of the parapets, measured at the distance of six feet from the butt, without 

the bark, twelve feet four inches in circumference. At a short distance to the southeast is another 

mound, in ascending which I took thirty steps. Its top is encircled by a breastwork three feet high, 

intersected through the middle with another elevation of a similar kind. A little farther is another 

mound, which I had not time to examine.  On these great works of art, the Indians gazed with as 

much curiosity as any white man. I inquired of the oldest chief, if the natives had any tradition 

respecting them; to which he answered in the negative. I then requested each to say what he 

supposed was their origin. Neither could tell: though all agreed in saying; "they were never put up 

by our people." It seems probable they were erected by another race, who once inhabited the 

country. That such a race existed, is now generally admitted. Who they were, and what were the 



causes of their

gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary 

Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread 

public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain 

and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the 

widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are 

particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed 

to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the 

United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much 

paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit 

donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND 

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org 

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation 

requirements, we know of no prohibition extermination, no circumstances have yet explained. But 

this is no reason why we should not, as in a hundred other instances, infer the existence of the 

cause from its effects, without any previous knowledge of its history.  In regard to the objects 

which these mounds were designed to answer, it is obvious they were not always the same. Some 

were intended as receptacles for the dead. These are small, and are distinguished by containing 

human bones. Some may have been designed as sites for public buildings, whether of a civil or 

religious kind; and others no doubt were constructed for the purposes of war. Of this last 

description, is the Etowee mound. In proof of its suitableness for such a purpose, I need only 

mention that the Cherokees in their late war with the Creeks, secured its summit by pickets, and 

occupied it as a place of protection for hundreds of their women and children. Gladly would I have 

spent a day in examining it more minutely; but my companions, unable to appreciate my motives, 

grew impatient, and I was obliged to withdraw, and leave a more perfect observation and 

description to some one else.   _Alluvial Formation._  I will now call your attention to the last 

geological division which came under my observation. It is the alluvial tract, extending

journey to New Orleans, and lies about six hundred miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. Its course at 

the place I crossed it, is a little south of west. It divides the waters of the Tennessee from those 

which proceed directly to the gulf. Travellers always observe it. They often mentioned it to me as 

the southern boundary of the _stony
