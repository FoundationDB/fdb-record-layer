sounding address, isn't it, Miss Primrose?"  Primrose smiled again--a smile=
, however, which made=20

poor little Poppy feel rather down-hearted, and then she continued her walk=
.  "It is very difficult to=20

know what to do," she said to herself--"it makes one feel quite old and car=
eworn. If only that=20

brother who was lost long ago was now living, how nice it would be for us g=
irls. I wonder if he is=20

. Twenty years=20

d why her hair was=20

grey before her time. What a pity my brother has not lived--he certainly wo=
uld not wish us girls to=20

be parted."  Primrose walked on a little farther, then she retraced her ste=
ps and went home. She=20

found Jasmine and Daisy in a state of the greatest excitement. Mrs. Ellswor=
thy had called, and=20

had been nicer and sweeter and more charming than ever--she had brought Dai=
sy a doll of the=20

most perfect description, and had presented the flower-loving Jasmine with =
a great bouquet of=20

exotics, which looked almost out of place in the humble little cottage.  "A=
nd there is a long letter for=20

you, Primrose," continued Jasmine; "and she says she hopes you will read it=
 very quickly, and that=20

she may come down to-morrow morning to talk it over with you. She says ther=

letter, and that it is a delightful plan--I wonder what it can be? Will you=
 read the letter now,=20

Primrose?--shall I break the seal and read it aloud to you?"  "No," answere=
d Primrose, almost=20

shortly for her--"Mrs. Ellsworthy's letter can keep," and then she slipped =
the thick white envelope=20

into her pocket.  "Why sister darling, how pale you public domain works in =

"A little," said Primrose--"I had no dinner--I should like a cup of tea."  =
Jasmine flew out of the room=20

to get it for her, and Daisy nestled up to her elder sister's side.  "Primr=

Hannah had removed all traces of the evening meal before Primrose would eve=

thick letter which was addressed to her. She did so at last, at the earnest=

apathetic voice.  This was what Mrs. Ellsworthy had written:   "MY DEAR PRI=
