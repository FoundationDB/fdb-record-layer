MONTGOMERY  Paul had an errand farther uptown, and, on leaving Tiffany's wa=
lked up as far as=20

Twenty-third street. Feeling rather tired, he got on board a University pla=
ce car to return. They had=20

accomplished, perhaps, half the distance, when, to his surprise, George Bar=
ry entered the car.=20

"How do you happen to be here, at this time, Barry?" he asked. "I thought y=
ou were attending to=20

business."  "I closed up for a couple of hours, having an errand at home. W=
here have you been?"=20

"To Tiffany's."  "What, the jewelers?"  "Yes."  "To buy a diamond ring, I s=
uppose," said Barry,=20

jocosely.  "No--not to buy, but to sell one."  "You are joking," said his c=
ompanion, incredulously.=20

"No, I am not. The ring belongs to my mother. I am trying to raise money en=
ough on it to buy you=20

out."  "I didn't know your mother was rich enough to indulge in such expens=
ive jewelry."  "She isn't,=20

and that's the reason I am trying to sell it."  "I mean, I didn't think she=
 was ever rich enough."  "I'll=20

explain it," said Paul. "The ring was found some time since in Central Park=
. As no owner has ever=20

appeared, though we advertised it, we consider that it belongs to us."  "Ho=
w much is it worth?"=20

"Mr. Tiffany offered two hundred and fifty dollars for it."  Barry uttered =
an exclamation of surprise.=20

"Well, that is what I call luck. Of course, you accepted it."  "I intend to=
 do so; but I must bring some=20

gentleman who will guarantee that I am all right and have the right to sell=
 it."  "Can you do that?"  "I=20

them off, and leave their country without population for a hundred years?  =
But at the time of which=20

I write neither my partner nor I cared much for speculations of that kind, =
