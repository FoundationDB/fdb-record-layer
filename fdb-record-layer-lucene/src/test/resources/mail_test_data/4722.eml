in a haystack."  "Oh, if you will only go!" exclaimed Norah, eagerly, "I'll=
 pay the expense so gladly,=20

as soon as I get my quarter's wages!"  "No, no, lass," said the school-mast=
er, laughing; "I've=20

enough shot in my locker to manage without your little store. Only"--Ned gl=
anced at his wife; he=20

knew that Persis had been looking forward with the pleasure of a child to h=
is holiday-time; for him=20

to go to London would spoil a pleasant plan which the Frankses had talked o=
ver for months. They=20

were to have gone on that very afternoon on a short pleasure-trip to the se=
a-side; for Franks=20

longed, as he owned, "to smell salt water again," which he had not done sin=
ce he had left the=20

profession of a sailor.  "What do you say, sweetheart?" asked Franks of his=
 wife. "I leave the=20

decision to you."  Persis stooped down and kissed her baby, probably to get=
 a moment for=20

thought, and then raising her head, said, with a smile which cost her some =
effort,--  "I think that=20

you'd better be off to London."  Franks glanced at the clock, Nancy Sands's=
 cuckoo-clock, which=20

hung in his little parlor. "I might be off by the tremble.  "Do you know wh=
at this is, Miss Forrest?" I=20

asked.  "No," she said. "It was yours, or Ivor's. Of course I didn't look."=
  And then there came the=20

rap, rap, of the call-boy at the door. The fifteen minutes were over. But I=
 had the treaty. And I had=20

to pay its price.     CHAPTER XIX   MAXINE PLAYS THE LAST HAND OF THE GAME =
 When the=20

play was over, I let Raoul drive home with me to supper. If Godensky knew, =
as he may have=20

known--since he seemed to know all my movements--perhaps he thought that I =
was seeing Raoul=20

for the last time, and sending him away from me for ever. But, though the g=
ame was not in my=20

hands yet, the treaty was; and I had made up my mind to defy Godensky.  I h=
ad almost promised=20

that, if he held his hand, I would give Raoul up; and never have I broken m=
y word. But if I wrote a=20

letter to Godensky in the morning, saying I had changed my mind, that he co=
uld do his worst=20

against Raoul du Laurier and against me, for nothing should part us two exc=
ept death? Then he=20

would have fair warning that I did not intend to do the thing to which he h=
ad nearly forced me; and=20

I would fight him, when he tried to take revenge. But meanwhile, before he =
got that letter, I would--

I must--find=20


_
sail," he cried. "I'll get my kit ready in no time. If I'm early in town I =
may see the lawyers to-day. I=20

must stay over Sunday in London, but if I've a prosperous cruise, I hope to=
 be back upon=20

Monday."  Persis was too busy helping her husband, and putting up his dinne=
r of cold meat, to=20

have time to think of her own disappointment, till Ned Franks, quick and pr=
ompt in everything, had=20

started off for the station at almost a running pace, with his little bundl=
e fastened to a stick hanging=20

over his shoulder. Norah had at once returned to the vicarage, full of hope=
 for her friend, having=20

perfect confidence that whatever business her uncle undertook he would do, =
and do well. Persis=20

gave a little sigh as her husband disappeared in the distance, and with him=
 all her prospect of a=20

holiday-trip; yet she was glad that she had made the sacrifice of her own i=
nclination; and, taking up=20

her baby from the cradle in which she had placed him, at a slow pace she pr=
oceeded along the=20

dusty road towards the cottage of her neighbor.     XXVII.  Nancy's Return.=
   With very mingled=20

feelings had Nancy Sands returned to her home. It was in the twilight that =
she entered her native=20

village. "I do not care," she said, "to have the gossips staring at me, or =
stopping me to talk."  John=20

Sands would have hired a conveyance for his wife, as the walk from the town=
 was a long one for=20

an invalid just discharged from an hospital; but his wife, in her short, de=
termined way, declined his=20

proposal to get one.  "I've two feet if I've only one arm," she said, almos=
t sharply. "If I've walked=20

that road once, I've walked it a hundred times; the fresh air will do me go=
od."  Mrs. Sands set out=20

briskly at her husband's side; but before they had gone a mile she felt tha=
t she was no longer what=20

she had once been,--that the sufferings and confinement which she had under=
gone had greatly=20

told on her strength. Her pace very sensibly slackened.  "My dear, would yo=
u take my arm?"=20

suggested the clerk, timidly, for he was still afraid of a rebuff from his =
hot-tempered wife.  But this=20

time there was no rebuff; Nancy thankfully took the proffered arm, and lean=
ed on it as she had=20

never done since the first week after her marriage. Whether it were that th=
ese old days were=20

brought back to her mind, or whether the very necessity for _leaning_ made =
her realize the=20

position of a wife in regard to her husband, who should be, according to Sc=
ripture, her "head" and=20

her "lord," we need not decide; but never had Nancy Sands felt her wilful, =
wayward heart so drawn=20

towards her spouse as on that homeward at the Foreign Office.  It was too s=
oon to dare to be=20

happy, yet; for it was on the cards that, even when I had saved Raoul from =
the consequences of=20

my political treachery, Godensky might still be able to ruin me with him. Y=
et, the relief I felt after=20

the all but hopeless anguish in which I had been drowning for the last few =
days gave to my spirit a=20

wild exhilaration that night. I encouraged Raoul with hints that I had news=
 of the necklace, and=20

said that, if he would let me come to him in his office as soon as it was o=
pen in the morning, I=20

might be able to surprise him pleasantly. Of course, he answered that it wo=
uld give him the=20

greatest joy to see me there, or anywhere; and we parted with an appointmen=
t for nine o'clock=20

next day.  When he had gone, I wrote a note--a very short note--to Count Go=
densky. I wanted to=20

have it ready; but I did not mean to send it till the treaty was in the saf=
e whence I had taken it.=20

Then, the letter should go at once, by messenger; and it would still be ver=
y early in the day, I=20

hoped.  Usually, I have my cup of chocolate in bed at nine; but on the morn=
ing which followed I=20

was dressed and ready to go out at half past eight. I think that I had not =
slept at all, but that didn't=20

matter. I felt strong and fresh, and my heart was full of courage. I was le=
aving nothing to chance. I=20

had a plan, and knew how I meant to play the last hand in the game. It migh=
t go against me. But I=20

held a high trump. Again, as before, Raoul received me alone.  "Dearest," h=
e exclaimed, "I know=20



your news must be good, for you look so bright and beautiful. Tell me--tell=
 me!"  I laughed,=20

teasingly, though Heaven knew I was in no mood for teasing.  "You're too im=
patient," I said. "To=20

punish you for asking about the wretched diamonds before you enquired how I=
 slept, and whether=20

I dreamed of you, I shall make you pay a penalty."  "Any penalty you will,"=
 he answered, laughing=20

too, and entering into the joke--for he was happy and hopeful now, seeing t=
hat I could joke.  "Let=20

me sit down and write at your desk, on a bit of your paper," I said.  He ga=
ve me pen and ink. I=20

scribbled off a few words, and folded the note into an envelope.  "Now, thi=
s is very precious," I=20

went on. "It tells you all you want to know. But--I'm going to post it."  "=
No, no!" he protested. "I can't=20

wait for the post."  "Oh, I wouldn't trust my treasure to the post office, =
not even if it were insured.=20

Open that wonderful safe you gave me a peep into the other day, and I'll pu=
t this valuable=20

document in among the others, not more valuable to the country than this=20


_
John Sands, his spirit was full of tenderness towards the wife of his youth=
.  Very few words were=20

spoken by either of the two as they slowly proceeded on their way. Nancy wa=
s too weary for much=20

conversation, and so perhaps was her husband; but as they passed the carpen=
ter's shop, she=20

observed,--  "So poor Stone is ill and not likely to live? He and I were th=
e two strongest people in=20

the parish."  Very much tired was Nancy when she re-entered her home. She w=
earily sank on a=20

chair; exhausted nature craved the support of a stimulant. An intense desir=
e arose for a glass of=20

spirits or a tumbler of ale; but she had taken the pledge, and neither she =
nor her husband liked to=20

mention what was in the minds of both.  John Sands went to the cupboard and=
 brought out of it the=20

supper which he had provided for his wife, and himself arranged it on the t=
able. There were little=20

luxuries, in which the poor there, and you must shut up the safe without lo=
oking for it, till I've gone.=20

Then, you must count ten, and after that--you may search. Remember, you sai=
d you'd submit to=20

any penalty, so no excuses, no complaints."  Raoul laughed. "You shall have=
 your way, fantastic=20

though it be, for you are a sorceress, and have bewitched me."  He unlocked=
 the door of the safe=20

and stood waiting for me to gratify my whim. But I gaily motioned him behin=
d me. "If you stand=20

there you can see where I put it, and that won't! be fair play. Turn your b=
ack."  He obeyed. "You=20

see how I trust you!" he said. "There lie my country's secrets."  "They're =
safe from me," I said=20

pertly. (And so indeed they were--now.) "They're too uninteresting to amuse=
 me in the least."  As I=20

spoke I found and abstracted the dummy treaty and slipped the real one into=
 its place. Then I laid=20

the envelope with the note I had written where he=20


_
of indulging during her absence. Pickled salmon,--Nancy had a weakness for =
pickled salmon,--

Bath chop, fresh butter, and white rolls. Nancy noticed the consideration s=
hown for her tastes, and=20

drew her chair to the table, well disposed to do justice to the dainties be=
fore her. Sands filled her=20

plate, and then shyly--for he was afraid of hurting his wife by showing tha=
t he remembered that=20

she had no longer a right hand--he cut up the viands into small pieces, and=
 quietly pushed the=20

plate to its place, avoiding looking at Nancy as he did so. "It must pain h=
er, poor dear, to be so=20

helpless, though I'm sure it's a pleasure to me to help her," thought the i=
ndulgent husband.  Nancy=20

had scarcely begun her meal when she stopped short, and fixed her eyes upon=
 a tumbler of water=20

at the right hand of the clerk, where she never before had missed at supper=
 the pint of beer.=20

"Where's your beer, John?" she asked, abruptly.  "Well, my dear, I  "Now yo=
u can close the safe," I=20

said.  He shut the door, and I almost breathed aloud the words that burst f=
rom my heart, "Thank=20

Heaven!"  "I must leave you," I told him. And I was kind for a moment, capr=
icious no longer,=20

because, though the treaty had been restored, I was going to open the cage =
of Godensky's=20

vengeance, and--I was afraid of him.  "I may come to you as soon as I'm fre=
e?" Raoul asked.=20

"Yes. Come and tell me what you think of the news, and--what you think of m=
e," I said. And while I=20

spoke, smiling, I prayed within that he might continue to think of me all t=
hings good--far better than=20

I deserved, yet not better than I would try to deserve in the future, if I =
were permitted to spend that=20

future with him.  The next thing I did was to send my letter to Count Goden=
sky. This was a flinging=20

down of the glove, and I knew it well. But I was ready to fight now.  Then,=
 I had to keep my=20

promise to Miss Forrest. But I had thought=20


_
nervously.  "You do want it; it does you good; _you_ have not taken the ple=
dge."  "No, but"--there=20

was a look of perplexity on John Sands's sallow face; he did not know how t=
o finish his sentence.=20

"The truth is, you can't trust me even to _see_ it," observed Nancy, gloomi=
ly.  "I thought that I=20

should not like to be different from you, my dear," said Sands, in a deprec=
atory tone. He would=20

have made any other sacrifice of his own comfort, as he made this, for the =
sake of rescuing his=20

wife from her fearful way in which, I hoped, that promise--fulfilled as I m=
eant to fulfil it--might help=20

rather than injure me. I had not lain awake all night for nothing.  I went =
to the office of the Chief of=20

Police, who is a gentleman and a patron of the theatre--when he can spare t=
ime from his work. I=20

had met him, and had reason to know that he admired my acting.  His first w=
ords were of=20

congratulation upon my success in the new play; and he was as cordial, as c=
omplimentary, as if=20

he had never heard of that scene at the Elysee=20


_
"Different,--you can't help being different," murmured Nancy, "you who neve=
r in all your born days=20

took one drop too much. It's hard for you to be kept from your beer. But pe=
rhaps you're right,=20

John," she added, looking her husband full in the face; "at least just at t=
he first. I suspect that if I=20

everything--so far as his subordinate could report.  "Are you surprised to =
see me, Monsieur?" I=20

asked.  "A great delight is always more or less of a surprise in this work-=
a-day world," he gallantly=20

replied.  "But you can guess what has brought me?"  "Would that I could thi=
nk it was only to give=20

me=20
