As some one has well said:      On mountain-tops no lotuses are grown;       The horse's yoke no 

ass will ever bear;     Rice never springs from seeds of barley sown;       A courtezan is not an 

honest fair.                         17  Accursed Charudatta, you shall not live! [_He takes a few steps._]

ridiculous.  _Sharvilaka._ Ridiculous? how so?  _Madanika._ Because these jewels although we 

know little about His nature or His operations; and why should we disbelieve in Christianity, which 

happens to be part of the system of things under which we are born? But why, also, should we pay 

such a compliment to opinions different from our own as to burn a heretic because he prefers the

What for?  _Madanika._ [_Whispers._] That's why.  _Sharvilaka._ [_Sheepishly._] Confound it! 

The sun was hot one summer day;     I sought the shadow, there to stay:     Poor fool! the kindly 

branch to pay,     I stole its sheltering leaves away.                          18  _Vasantasena._ How sorry 

he seems. Surely, he did this thing in ignorance.  _Sharvilaka._ What is to be done now, 

Madanika?  _Madanika._ Your own wit should tell you that.  _Sharvilaka._ No. For you must 

remember,      Nature herself gives women wit;     Men learn from books a little bit.    intellect, 

when they pass beyond a narrow bound, he pays a homage to the force of will; his admiration for 

the heroic men of Plutarch is ardent. An Epicurean by temperament, he is a Stoic through his 

imagination; but for us and for himself, who are no heroes, the appropriate form of Stoical virtue is 

moderation within our sphere, and a wise indifference, or at most a disinterested curiosity, in 

matters which lie beyond that sphere. Let us resign ourselves to life, such as it is; let us resign 

ourselves to death; and let the resignation be cheerful or even gay. To spend ourselves in 

attempted reforms of the world, of society, of governments, is vain. The world
