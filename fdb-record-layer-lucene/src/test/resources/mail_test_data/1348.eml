morning. That doesn't worry us a bit as long as they don't come any closer.=
 I'm willing always to=20

share up on the shelling.  This order has just been issued. It speaks for i=
tself:--       All ranks are=20

warned that bombs and grenades must not be used for     fishing and killing=
 game.   I went over=20

another farm to-day. It is one of the well-ventilated kind, punched full of=
 holes. In the kitchen,=20

stables and outhouses there was a most wonderful collection of junk: ammuni=
tion, British and=20

French bandoliers, old sheepskin coats abandoned by the British troops from=
 last winter, smashed=20

rifles, bayonets, meat tins, parts of broken equipment, sandbags, stacks of=
 rotten potatoes and=20

three dead cows. The fruit trees are laden with fruit, and vines are growin=
g up the houses with=20

their bunches of green grapes.  In the garden several lonely graves are pil=
ed high with old boots,=20

straw, American agricultural implements, rotting sacks and rubbish of every=
 description, pieces of=20

shells, barrels, and in one room the rusty remains of a perambulator and se=
wing machine; rats are=20

the only inhabitants now. In the garret (the staircase leading up to it gon=
e long ago) I found a=20

British rifle, bayonet fixed, ten rounds in the magazine, and the bolt part=
ly drawn out. Evidently the=20

owner was in the act of reloading his chamber when something happened. The =
graves were dated=20

second and or insect state, about the middle of July. All those chrysalids =
that I exposed to the sun,=20

died; and all those that were kept cool under earth, produced an insect: he=
nce I infer, that the heat=20

of the sun will kill the chrysalids. If, then, the ground be ploughed about=
 the first of July, many of=20

those insects might be destroyed, and the destruction of the productions of=
 the next year=20

prevented; for the _pupa_ is never more than a few inches under ground.  Th=
e phalaena=20

devastator is never seen during the day; it conceals itself in the crevices=
 of buildings, and beneath=20

the bark of trees. About sun-down it leaves its hiding-place, is constantly=
 on the wing, and very=20

troublesome about the candles in houses. It flies very rapidly, and is not =
easily taken.  Such is the=20

description of this formidable enemy to vegetation. No efficacious method h=
as yet been taken to=20

prevent its ravages, but the one who could accomplish it, would do the caus=
e of agriculture an=20

essential service.     ART. XIV. _Description of a New Genus of North Ameri=
can Fresh water Fish,=20

Exoglossum, by_ C. S. RAFINESQUE, ESQ.   Mr. Lesueur has published, in the =
5th Number of=20

the Journal of the Academy of Sciences of Philadelphia, for September, 1817=
, the description of a=20

new fish, which he calls _Cyprinus maxillingua_: he considers it as a very =
singular and anomalous=20

species, owing to the peculiar=20


_
months of this year. The poor wooden crosses were made of pieces of ration =
cases and the=20

names written with an indelible pencil. The wretchedness of this farm, whic=
h was flourishing only a=20

short time ago, is very pathetic.  We have adopted an old Belgian mother ca=
t with her family of=20

three kittens in the dugout. Now we find that three more little wild kitten=
s are living in the bricks=20

which we have piled around the windows to protect is external, and situated=
 as an appendage to=20

the former. It was discovered in Pipe-creek, Maryland, in June, 1816, by sa=
id author, who=20

confesses that he does not consider it as properly belonging to the genus _=
Cyprinus_, and=20

presumes that when other species shall be discovered, possessing the same c=
haracter, they will=20

constitute a separate genus. Although this principle and presumption is cor=
rect, it was wrong to=20

delay the formation=20


_
shells. They are all encouraged to live with us in the cellars. I like cats=
, and they will help to keep=20

the rats down. Although some of the rats are nearly the size of cats.  It h=
as been raining again and=20

the trenches are filling up with slush. We carry a big trench stick, a thic=
k sapling about four feet=20

long with a ferrule made from a cartridge of a genus, because only a specie=
s was then known,=20

since so many genera are composed of single species. However, Mr. Lesueur's=
 expectation was=20

verified even before he wrote it, since in May, 1817, I had discovered in t=
he Fishkill, State of New-

York, another, species, evidently congenerous with the _Cyprinus maxillingu=
a_, having the same=20

structure of the mouth, &c.=20


_
ourselves in walking; our feet are beginning to get wet and cold as a regul=
ar thing now, and we are=20

revetting our trenches firm and solid for the winter. Eleven P.M. A mine un=
der the Boche line has=20

just been exploded. The fighting has just started for the crater.  I took a=
 German Uhlan helmet=20

from a gentleman who had no further use a separate genus for those two spec=
ies, having no=20

doubt that many more will hereafter be added to it by accurate observers, a=
nd I give to it the name=20

of _Exoglossum_, meaning _outside tongue_. It will belong to the same natur=
al order and family of=20

rophy.                    -----------------
