philodendron monstera over with banners and mottoes, the pies passed along =

ng before the hungry King. And not one of the pies was real! Gradually the =
King's smile faded.  There was a wonderful big pie fashioned like a ship,--=

ur to me all of a sudden: thus, while my mind was, as it were, trifling wit=
h the _
otherwise you might have done."  "Perhaps I shall," said the War-Lord whims=
ically. "Perhaps I=20

shall appreciate it all the more."  "Now, what means Your Majesty by that?"=
 cried Harold,=20

wondering very much at these strange words. "It was such a fine pie! A larg=
e, fat, juicy, rich, crisp,=20

crusty pie,--just such a one as the King enjoyed in the story."  "Yes, I kn=
ow!" said Red Rex. "Go on=20

with the story, right speedily, with no more details of that tantalizing, v=
anished pie!" And he licked=20

his lips and shifted his seat as he sat upon his hillock.  Obediently Harol=
d opened the book which=20

his chum Richard had handed to him just inside the city gate, and began to =
read the toothsome=20

tale of _The King's Pie_.    XVI: THE KING'S PIE  There was great excitemen=
t in Kisington; for the=20

King was coming with his new young bride, and the town was preparing to giv=
e them a famous=20

welcome.  Hugh, the Lord Mayor, was at his wits' end with all that must be =
done. As he sat in the=20

Town Hall holding his aching head, while a mob of decorators and artists an=
d musicians,=20

costumers, jewelers, and florists clamored about him, there came to him a m=
essenger from=20

Cedric, his son. Cedric was one of the King's favorite friends, and he knew=
 His Majesty's taste=20

well. So he had sent to the Lord Mayor a hint as to how the King might best=
 be pleased. Being a=20

man of few words, this is how his message ran:--  "His Majesty is exceeding=
ly fond of pie."  Long=20

pondered the Lord Mayor over this mysterious message, reading it backward a=
nd forward, upside=20

down and crisscross, and mixed up like an anagram. But he could make nothin=
g of it except what=20

it straightforwardly said: that the King was exceedingly fond of pie.  Now,=
 in those days pie meant=20

but one thing--a pasty; that is, meat of some sort baked in a dish covered =
with dough. At that time=20

there was no such thing known as a pie made of fruit or mincemeat. Pie was =
not even a dainty.=20

Pie was vulgar, ordinary victuals, and the Lord Mayor was shocked at his so=
n's even mentioning=20

pie in connection with the King.  "Pie, indeed!" he shuddered. "A pretty di=
sh to set before a King on=20

his wedding journey! How can pie be introduced into my grand pageant? The K=
ing can get pie=20

anywhere, in any hut or hovel along his way. What has Kisington to do with =
pie?"  The Lord Mayor=20

snorted scornfully, and was about to dismiss his son's hint from his mind, =
when he had an idea! A=20

Pie! A great, glorified, poetic, symbolic Pie such as could be carried in p=
rocession decorated with=20

flowers! That was a happy thought. The Lord Mayor dismissed every one else =
and sent for all the=20

master cooks of the city.  It was decided to accept Cedric's hint for what =
it was worth, and make=20

Pie the feature of the day. There should be a grand pageant of soldiers and=
 maskers and music.=20

And, following the other guilds, last of all should come the cooks, with th=
eir ideas of Pie presented=20

as attractively as might be, for the edification of the King. Moreover, the=
 Lord Mayor said, in=20

dismissing the white-capped company:--  "To whichever of you best pleases H=
is Majesty with the=20

pie, I will give this reward: a team of white oxen, a hundred sacks of whit=
e flour, and a hundred=20

pieces of white silver."  "Hurrah!" shouted the cooks, waving their white c=
aps. Then away they=20

hurried to put on their thinking-caps instead and plan for the building of =
the King's Pie.  Now,=20

among the cooks of Kisington there were two brothers, Roger and Rafe. Roger=
, the elder, had one=20

of the hugest kitchens and shops in Kisington. But Rafe, the younger, had o=
nly a little old house on=20

an acre of land under a little red-apple tree, with a little red cow who ga=
ve a little rich cream every=20

day. Rafe was very poor, and no richer for having a brother well-to-do like=
 Roger. For the thrifty=20

cook had little to do with Rafe, whose ways were not his ways.  Rafe cooked=
 in his little kitchen for=20

the poor folk of the town, charging small prices such as they could pay. In=
deed, often as not he=20

gave away what he had cooked for himself to some one who seemed hungrier. T=
his is a poor way=20



to make profit of gold, but an excellent way to make profit of affection. A=
nd Rafe was rich in the=20

love of the whole town.  Roger was among the cooks whom the Lord Mayor summ=
oned to consult=20

about the King's Pie. But Rafe knew nothing at all of it, until one afterno=
on he was surprised by a=20

visit from his brother, who had not darkened his door for many a day.  "Wel=
l, Brother," said Roger,=20

briefly, "I suppose you are not busy, as I am. Will you work for me for a d=
ay or two? In fact, I need=20

you."  "You need me!" said Rafe, in surprise. "How can that be, Brother?"  =
"I have a great task at=20

hand," said the master-cook; "a task that needs extra help. You must come. =
Your own work can=20

wait well enough, I judge."  Rafe hesitated. "I must cook for my poor peopl=
e first," he said.  Roger=20

sneered. "Your poor people, indeed! I am cooking for the King! Will you hes=
itate now?"  "Cooking=20

for the King!" cried Rafe. "Ah, but he is not so hungry as my neighbors wil=
l be to-morrow without=20

their rabbit-pies."  "Rabbit-pies! It is a pie for the King that I am makin=
g!" shouted Roger, in high=20

dudgeon,--"such a pie as you and your louts never dreamed of. Now what say =
you? Will you=20

come?"  "I must do my own small cooking first," said Rafe firmly.  "Very we=
ll then," growled Roger.=20

"Cook for your beggars first; but come to me to-morrow. Every cook in town =
but you is engaged. I=20

must have your help."  "I will come," said Rafe simply, and Roger bade him =
a surly good-bye=20

without thanks or promises.  The next morning, when his own simple tasks we=
re done, Rafe hied=20

him to his brother's kitchen, and there he found great doings. Roger was su=
perintending the=20

preparations for baking an enormous pie. A group of masons had just finishe=
d building the huge=20

oven out of doors, and about a score of smiths were struggling with the pie=
-dish, which they had=20

forged of iron. It was a circular dish six feet across and three feet deep;=
 and it looked more like a=20

swimming-tank than anything else.  Rafe stared in amazement. "Is that to ho=
ld your pie, Brother?"=20

he asked.  "Yes!" growled Roger. "Now get to work with the other men, for t=
he crust must be=20

baked this morning."  Three assistant cooks in caps and aprons were busy si=
fting buckets of flour,=20

measuring out handfuls of salt and butter. Others were practicing with long=
 rolling-pins made for=20

the occasion, so big that a man had to roll at each end. On the ground lay =
a great round piece of=20

tin, six feet across, pierced full of holes.  "What is that?" whispered Raf=
e to one of his fellow cooks.=20

"That is to be the lid of the pie," answered the cook. "See, they are lifti=
ng it onto the dish now. It=20

will have a strong hinge, and it will be covered with crust."  "And what is=
 to fill this marvelous pie?"=20

asked Rafe, wondering still more. "Tender capon? Rabbits? Venison? Peacocks=
? What is suitable=20

for a King? I do not know."  "Ah, there you show your lack of imagination!"=
 cried the cook. "Master=20

is a great man. This is a poetic pie. It is to be filled with flowers, and =
on the flowers will be sitting=20

ten beautiful little children, pink and sweet as cherubs, dressed all in wr=
eaths of flowers. And when=20

the pie reaches the King, the top will be opened, and they will all begin t=
o sing a song in honor of=20

Their Majesties. Is it not a pretty thought?"  "Well, if the King be not to=
o hungry," said the practical=20

Rafe, doubtfully.  "Nonsense!" cried the cook testily. "Would you make out =
our King to be a=20

cannibal?"  "Nay," said Rafe; "that is why I doubt. However, I am here but =
to assist in this colossal=20

plan. Hand me yon bag of salt."  All day long at Roger's kitchen the cooks =
worked over the King's=20

Pie. At noon came a band of ten mothers, each with a rosy, smiling baby. Th=
ey placed the children=20

in the great shell to see how they would look. Every one cried: "Charming! =
Superb! But ah! we=20

must not tell any one, for Roger has paid us well, and the other cooks must=
 not know how he is to=20

win the prize to-morrow!"  Weary and unthanked, with his meager day's wage,=
--a little bag of flour=20

and a pat of butter, sugar, and a handful of salt,--Rafe went home, musing =
sadly. "A team of white=20



oxen; a hundred sacks of white flour; a hundred pieces of white silver,--wh=
at a prize! If only I could=20

earn these, I should be rich, indeed, and able to help my poor neighbors. B=
ut Roger will win the=20

prize," he thought.  He spread on the table his frugal supper. He had empti=
ed his larder that=20

morning for a sick woman. He had but a few apples and a bowl of cream. It w=
as the first food he=20

had eaten that day, for his brother had forgotten to bid him to his table. =
 As he was taking a bite=20

from one of the rosy-checked apples, there came a tap at the door.  "Enter!=
" cried Rafe hospitably.=20

The hinges creaked, and there tottered in a little, bent, old woman in a lo=
ng black cloak, leaning on=20

a staff.  "Good evening, Son," she said, in a cracked voice. "Are you a man=
 of charity, or will you=20

turn away a poor old soul who has had nothing to eat for many hours?"  Rafe=
 rose and led her to=20

the table. "Sit down, Mother," he said kindly. "Sit and share my poor suppe=
r: a few apples from my=20

little tree, a sup of the cream which my good little red cow gives me,--tha=
t is all; but you are=20

welcome."  "Thanks, Son," said the old woman, and without further words she=
 began to eat. When=20

she had finished she sat for a few moments looking into the empty bowl. The=
n she said:--  "Son,=20

why do you not bake a pie for the King?"  "I!" cried Rafe, astonished. "How=
 can I make a pie? You=20

see all I have in my cupboard. is the first consideration?"  "To tell you t=
he truth--but of course I=20

never breathed it to Ursula--I attach a good deal of importance to colour."=
  "Ah, I see; you classify=20

us somewhat in this way: first, if you can get it, rich, orthodox, and whit=
e; second, rich, heterdox,=20

and white; third, rich, orthodox, and black. Now, in my opinion, to attach =
any importance whatever=20

to colour is wicked. My objections to Mr Chundango do not apply to his skin=
, which is as good as=20

any other, but to his heart, which I am afraid is black. I prefer a pure he=
art in a dark skin to a black=20

heart in a white one," and I looked significantly at her ladyship. "Supposi=
ng that out of friendship=20

for Grandon I should do the absurd thing of withdrawing my pretensions, wha=
t would happen?"  "I=20

should insist upon Ursula's marrying Mr Chundango. I tell you in confidence=
, Lord Frank, that=20

pecuniary reasons, which I will explain more fully at another time, render =
it absolutely necessary=20

that she should marry a man with means within the next six months. The cred=
it of our whole family=20

is at stake; but it is impossible for me to enter into details now." At thi=
s moment the luncheon was=20

announced. I followed Lady Broadhem mechanically towards the dining-room, b=
ut instead of=20

entering it went up-stairs like one in a dream, and ordered my servant to m=
ake arrangements for=20

my immediate departure. I pulled an arm-chair near my bedroom fire, and gaz=
ed hopelessly into it.=20

People call me odd. I wonder really whether the conflicts of which my brain=
 is the occasional arena=20

are fiercer than those of others. I wonder whether other people's thoughts =
are as like clouds as=20

mine are--sometimes, when it is stormy, grouping themselves in wild fantast=
ic forms; sometimes=20

chasing each other through vacancy, for no apparent purpose; sometimes melt=
ing away in=20

"intense inane;" and again consolidating themselves, black and lowering, ti=
ll they burst in a=20

passionate explosion. What are they doing now? and I tried in vain to stop =
the mental=20

kaleidoscope which shifted itself so rapidly that I could not catch one com=
bination of thought=20

before it was succeeded by another; but always the same prominent figures d=
odging madly about=20

the chambers of my brain--Chundango, Ursula, Lady Broadhem, and Grandon; La=
dy Broadhem,=20

Chundango, Grandon, and Ursula--backwards and forwards, forwards and backwa=
rds, like some=20

horrid word that I had to spell in a game of letters, and could never bring=
 right. Love, friendship,=20

hate, pity, admiration, treachery--more words to spell, ever combining wron=
gly, and never letting=20

me rest, till I thought something must crack under the strain. Then mocking=
ly came a voice ringing=20



in my ears--Peace, peace, peace--and I fancied myself lulled to rest in her=
 arms, and I heard the=20

cooing of doves mingle with the soft murmur of her voice as she leant wistf=
ully over me, and I=20

revelled in that most fatal of all nightmares--the nightmare of those who, =
perishing of hunger and=20

thirst, die of imaginary banquets. "Sweet illusion," I said, "dear to me as=
 reality, brood over my=20

troubled spirit, deaden its pain, heal its wounds, and weave around my bein=
g this delicious spell=20

for ever." Then suddenly, as though my brain had been a magazine into which=
 a spark had fallen,=20

it blazed up; my hair bristled, and drops stood upon my forehead, for a gre=
at fear had fallen upon=20

me. It had invaded me with the force of an overwhelming torrent, carrying a=
ll before it. It said,=20

"Whence is the calm that soothes you? Infatuated dreamer, think you it is t=
he subsiding of the=20

storm, and not rather the lull that precedes it? Beware of the sleep of the=
 frozen, from which there=20

is no waking." What was this? was my mind regaining its balance, or was it =
going to lose it for=20

ever? Most horrid doubt! the very thought was so much in the scale on the w=
rong side. Oh for=20

something to lean upon--some strong stay of common-sense to support me! I y=
earned for the=20

practical--some fact on which to build. "I have got it," I exclaimed sudden=
ly. "There must be some=20

osseous matter behind my dura mater!" I shall never forget the consolation =
which this notion gave=20

me: it relieved me from any further psychological responsibility, so to spe=
ak; I gave up mental=20

analysis. I attributed the keen susceptibility of my aesthetic nature to th=
is cause, and accepted it=20

as I would the gout, without a murmur. Still I needed repose and solitude, =
so I determined to go to=20

Flityville and arrange my ideas, no longer alarmed at the confusion in whic=
h they were, but with=20

the steadfast purpose of disentangling them quietly, as I would an interest=
ing knot. Hitherto I had=20

been tearing at it madly and making it worse; now I had got the end of the =
skein--"osseous=20

matter"--and would soon unravel it. So I descended calmly to the drawing-ro=
om.  I found it empty,=20

but it occurred to me I had left my letter to Lady Ursula in the recess, an=
d in the agitation attending=20

my interview with Lady Broadhem, had forgotten to go back for it. I pushed =
back the _portiere_,=20

and saw seated at the writing-table Lady Ursula herself. She looked pale an=
d nervous, while I felt=20

overwhelmed with confusion and embarrassment. This was the more trying, as =
many years have=20

elapsed since I have experienced any such sensations.  "Oh, you don't happe=
n to have seen a=20

letter lying about anywhere, do you, Lady Ursula?" said I. "It ought to be =
under your hand, for I left=20

it exactly on that spot."  "No," she said; "I found mamma writing here when=
 I came, and she took a=20

packet of letters away with her; perhaps she put yours among them by mistak=
e. She will be back=20

from her drive almost immediately."  "I hope so," said I. "I should be sorr=
y to leave without seeing=20

her."  "To leave, Lord Frank! I thought you were going to stay till Monday.=
" She looked up rather=20

appealingly, I thought, as if my presence would have been a satisfaction to=
 her under the=20

circumstances; and I saw, as I returned her steady earnest gaze, that she l=
ittle guessed the=20

purport of the missing letter.  At that moment my head began to swim, and t=
he figures to dance=20

about in my brain again. Chundango and Grandon seemed locked in a death-str=
uggle, and Ursula,=20

with dishevelled hair, trying to separate them, while Lady Broadhem, in the=
 background, was=20

clapping her hands and urging them on. I seemed spinning round the group wi=
th such rapidity that=20

I was obliged to steady myself with one hand against the back of Lady Ursul=
a's chair.  "What's the=20

matter? what's the matter, Lord Frank?" she exclaimed.  "Osseous matter, os=
seous matter," I=20

murmured mechanically, and it sounded so like an echo of her words that I a=
m sure she thought=20

me going mad. Should I throw myself at her feet and tell her all? If she wo=
uld only trample upon=20



me and my feelings together, it would be a luxury compared to the agony of =
self-control I was=20

inflicting upon myself. If I could only pour myself out in a torrent of pas=
sionate expression, and=20

wind up with a paroxysm of tears, she was welcome to treat me as a raving l=
unatic, but I should be=20

much less likely to become one. But how, knowing what I did, could I face G=
randon afterwards?=20

Before that fatal conversation with Lady Broadhem, I should have had the sa=
tisfaction of hearing=20

my fate from Lady Ursula herself, and I know that she would have treated me=
 so tenderly that=20

rejection would have been a thousand times preferable to this. She would ha=
ve known then the=20

intensity of my affection, she would have heard from my own lips the burnin=
g words with which I=20

would have pleaded my cause, and, whatever might have been the result, woul=
d have pitied and=20

felt for me. Now, if I say nothing, and Lady Broadhem tells her when I am g=
one that she considers=20

us engaged, what will Ursula think of me? Again, if Lady Broadhem thinks I =
am really going to do=20

what my conscience urges, and sacrifice myself for Grandon, then, poor girl=
, she will be sacrificed=20

to Chundango.  Nothing but misery will come out of that double event: if I =
do what is right, it will=20

bring misery; if I do what is wrong, it will bring misery too,--that is one=
 consolation--it makes the=20

straight and narrow path easier. The only difficulty is, I can't find it--a=
nd standing here with my=20

hand on her chair, my head swimming, and Lady Ursula looking anxiously up a=
t me, I am not likely=20

to find it.  "Lord Frank, do let me ring the bell and send for a glass of w=
ater," she said at last.=20

"Thanks, no; the fact is, that letter I have lost causes me the greatest an=
xiety, and when I thought=20

what the consequences might be of its going astray I felt a little faint fo=
r a moment."  "Dear me,"=20

said Lady Ursula, kindly, "I will make mamma look for it at once, and I am =
sure if it is a matter in=20

which my sympathy could be of any use, you will appreciate my motive in off=
ering it; but I do think=20

in this world people might be of so much more use to each other than they a=
re, if they would only=20

trust one another, and believe in the sincerity of friendship. Although you=
 did try to shock me last=20

night," she said, with a smile, "I have heard so much of you from Lord Gran=
don, and know how=20

kind and good you are, although he says you are too enthusiastic and too fo=
nd of paradoxes, but I=20

assure you I consider you quite an old friend. You remember, years ago, whe=
n I was a little girl,=20

how you used to gallop about with me on my pony in the park at Broadhem? Yo=
u won't think me=20

inquisitive, I am sure, in saying this, but there are moments sometimes whe=
n it is a relief to find a=20

listener to the history of one's troubles."  "But when, by a curious fatali=
ty, that listener is the cause=20

of them all, these=20


_
butter, a handful of sugar and salt."  "It is enough," said the stranger. "=
Son, I will show you a=20

secret. You have been kind to me. Now I will tell you that which until this=
 day no man has known.=20

You shall make the King a pie, indeed!"  "But, Mother," interrupted Rafe, s=
miling, "you do not know=20

what manner of pies are being made. There will be many, though I have seen =
but one--a giant pie,=20

a glorious pie, all golden crust and flowers and pink little babies who sin=
g!"  "Humph!" grunted the=20

old woman. "A pie for a pasteboard King. Why not cook a pie to tempt a hung=
ry man?"  "The King=20

is, indeed, a man," mused Rafe. "But how shall I make a pie without viands =
of any sort?" (As I=20

have said, to speak of a pie in those days meant always a dish of meat or g=
ame or poultry.)  "I will=20

tell you," said the old woman. "Have you not a tree of red apples? Yes, lus=
cious apples of a goodly=20

flavor, for I have tasted them." She leaned forward, whispering earnestly: =
"Make your pie of them,=20

my Son!"  "Apples! A pie of apples!" cried Rafe. "Who ever heard of such a =
thing!" (And at this=20

time, indeed, no one had.)  "Nay, you need not laugh so scornfully," said t=
he old crone. "You shall=20

see! I will help you."  At her command Rafe fetched out the bag of flour, a=
nd the butter, salt, and=20

sugar. Then he went to gather a basket of apples, while the old woman mende=
d the fire and mixed=20

the dough. Wonderingly he watched her pare the apples, core and slice them,=
 and cover all with a=20

blanket of crust laid softly over, but not tucked in at the edges as for an=
 ordinary pasty. Soon the=20

pie was baked, all flaky and brown. When it came smoking hot from the oven,=
 the old woman=20

slipped a knife under the blanket of crust and lifted it aside.  "See," she=
 said, "the apples are=20

steamed and soft. Now I will mash them with a knife and mix the butter and =
sugar generously=20

therein. This one must ever do, Son, last of all. This is the crown of my s=
ecret, the only recipe for a=20

perfect pie."  Rafe watched her curiously, by no means convinced. Then, fro=
m a pouch=20

somewhere concealed in her robe, she drew out a strange round nut, such as =
Rafe had never=20

seen before.  "This is the final blessing," she said. "See, I will grate a =
little of this magic nut into the=20

pie." Forthwith it was done, and a whiff of spicy fragrance reached Rafe's =
nose, and, more than=20

anything, gave him confidence in this strange new pie.  "It smells worthy,"=
 said Rafe hungrily.=20

Without a word the stranger drew from under a cover a little pie baked in a=
 tiny tin, an exact copy=20

of the other. "Eat," she said: "eat and judge if my secret be worth keeping=
."  Rafe sunk his teeth=20

into the warm, crisp crust and ate eagerly. His eyes sparkled, but he spoke=
 no word till the last=20

crumb was gone.  "Oh!" he said, "it is a magic pie! Never such have I met b=
efore! Never, in all my=20

life!"  The old woman nodded. "A magic pie," she said. "And still better wh=
en you serve it with the=20

yellow cream of your little red cow."  "It is a pie for a King!" said Rafe.=
 "But shall I be allowed in the=20

procession, Mother?"  "All the cooks in Kisington who choose may march with=
 that guild," said the=20

old woman. "Bear your pie proudly in your own hands, wearing your cap and a=
pron. I will send=20

some one to walk beside you and carry the jug of cream. She shall be here t=
o-morrow when you=20

milk the little red cow. Treat her kindly for my sake."  "Mother, how can I=
 ever thank you--" began=20

Rafe. But, with a quickness which seemed impossible to her years, the old w=
oman had slipped out=20

of the door and was gone.  The next morning bright and early Rafe went out =
to milk his cow. And=20

there beside the cow stood a young maid, the fairest he had ever seen.  "Go=
od morning, Rafe,"=20

said the maid, dropping a curtsy. "I am Meg, and I have come to help you ca=
rry the King's Pie."=20

She smiled so sweetly that Rafe's heart danced a jig. She was dressed in a =
neat little gown of blue=20

with a white apron, and had set a dainty cook's cap on her flaxen curls. An=
d she wore red=20

stockings and shoes, with silver say. Is it not enough to love a woman to d=
istraction, and be=20



obliged by every principle of honour to conceal it from her, without her pr=
essing upon you her=20

sympathy, and inviting your confidence? and the very tenderness which had p=
rompted her speech=20

rose up against her in judgment in my mind. So ready with her friendship, t=
oo! Should I tell her=20

bitterly that she was the only being in the whole world whose friendship co=
uld aggravate my=20

misery? Should I congratulate her upon the ingenuity she had displayed in t=
hus torturing me? or=20

should I revenge myself by giving her the confidence she asked, and request=
ing her to advise me=20

how to act under the circumstances? Then I looked at the gentle earnest fac=
e, and my heart=20

melted. My troubles! Do I not know too well what hers are? Perhaps it would=
 be a relief to her to=20

hear, that if worse comes to worst, she can always escape Chundango by fall=
ing back upon me. If=20

she is driven to begging me to offer myself up on her shrine, what a very w=
illing sacrifice she=20

would find me! As she knows that I must have overheard what passed between =
her and=20

Chundango this morning, shall I make a counter-proposition of mutual confid=
ence, and allude=20

delicately to that most painful episode! If she is generous enough to forge=
t her own troubles and=20

think of me, why should not I forget mine and think of her? The idea of thi=
s contradiction in terms=20

struck me as so exquisitely ludicrous, that I laughed aloud.  "Ha! ha! ha! =
Lady Ursula, if you only=20

knew what a comic aspect that last kind speech of yours has given to the wh=
ole affair. Don't think=20

me ungrateful or rude, but--ha! ha! ha!" Here I went off again. "When once =
my sense of humour is=20

really touched, I always seem to see the point of a joke to quite a painful=
 degree. Upon two=20

occasions I have suffered from fits after punning, and riddles always make =
me hysterical; but I=20

assure you, you unconsciously made a joke just now when you asked me to tel=
l you exactly what I=20

felt, which I shall remember as long as I live, for it will certainly be th=
e death of me--ha! ha! ha!"=20

But Lady Ursula had risen from her chair and rung the bell before I had fin=
ished my speech, and I=20

was still laughing when the servant came into the room, followed by Lady Br=
oadhem and Lady=20

Bridget.  "Dear me," said Lady Broadhem, with her most winning smile, "how =
very merry you are!--

at least Lord Frank is. You seem a little pale, dear," turning to Ursula; "=
what is the matter?"  "Oh,=20

nothing, mamma. Lord Frank has been looking for a letter in the recess. You=
 don't happen to have=20

put it up with yours, do you?"  "No, my dear, I think not," said Lady Broad=
hem, looking through a=20

bundle. "Who was it to, Lord Frank, if you will pardon my curiosity? I shal=
l find it more easily if you=20

will give me the address."  "Nobody in particular," said I, "so it does not=
 matter; you can keep it=20

and read it. It is a riddle; that is what has been amusing us so much. Lady=
 Ursula has been=20

making such absurd attempts to guess it. Good-bye, Lady Broadhem. Here is t=
he servant come to=20

say that my fly is at the door."  "Good gracious! Why, where are you going?=
" said she, evidently=20

imagining that her daughter and I had had some thrilling episode, and that =
I was going away in a=20

huff, so I determined to mystify her still more.  "Oh, only to Flityville t=
o get everything ready; you=20

know what a state the place is in. Now," and I looked tenderly into the ama=
zed face of Lady=20

Ursula, "I shall indeed have an object in putting it in order, and I shall =
expect you and Lady Ursula=20

to come some day soon and suggest the improvements. I have only one request=
 to make before=20

leaving, and I do so, Lady Ursula, in the presence of your mother and siste=
r; and that is, that until I=20

see you again, the subject of our conversation just now may never be allude=
d to between=20

yourselves. Trust in me, Lady Broadhem," I said, taking her hand affectiona=
tely, "and promise me=20

you will not ask Lady Ursula what I have just told her; if you do," I whisp=
ered, "you will spoil all,"=20

and I looked=20


_
her apron she drew a little blue jug. "See, I have brought this to hold the=
 cream," she said, "and it=20

is full of red strawberries for your breakfast. Milk the little red cow, Ra=
fe, and then we can eat and=20

be gone as soon as I have skimmed the cream of yesterday."  In a happy daze=
 Rafe did as she=20

bade. Merrily they breakfasted together on a wheaten loaf and milk and berr=
ies which the maid=20

had brought, as if she knew how hungry Rafe would be. Then Meg skimmed the =
cream for the=20

blue jug, and they were ready to start. Rafe, in his white cap and apron, b=
ore the precious pie,=20

while Meg walked along at his side. A merry, handsome couple they were.  Wh=
en they came to=20

the market-place they found a great crowd assembled. "Ho, Rafe! Rafe!" peop=
le shouted to him,=20

for every one knew and loved him. "Come here! Come with us!"  But Rafe answ=
ered: "Nay. I am=20

going to walk in the procession with the  "I do," said Lady Broadhem.  "And=
 now, Lady Ursula," I=20

said, crossing over to her and taking her hand, "once more good-bye, and"--=
I went on in so low a=20

tone that it was impossible for Lady Broadhem to overhear it, but it made h=
er feel sure that all was=20

arranged between us--"you have got the most terrible secret of my life. I k=
now I can trust you. You=20

have seen me"--and I formed the word with my lips rather than uttered it wi=
th my breath--"MAD!=20

Hush!" for Lady Ursula gave a quick exclamation, and almost fainted with al=
arm; "I am myself=20

again now. Remember my happiness is in your keeping"--this out loud for Lad=
y Broadhem's=20

benefit. "I am going to say good-bye to Lady Dickiefield, and you shall hea=
r from me when I can=20

receive you at Flityville."  I am endowed with a somewhat remarkable facult=
y, which I have not=20

been in the habit of alluding to, partly because my friends think me=20


_
other cooks. I have a pie for the King."  "A pie! A pie!" they cried good-n=
aturedly. "Look at Rafe's=20

pasty! Of what is it made, Rafe? Grasshoppers or mice?" For they knew how p=
oor he was. But=20

Rafe only smiled and pushed his way to where the cooks were gathered. They,=
 too, greeted him=20

with jests. But he insisted that he must march with them. So they gave him =
place at the very end of=20

the line, with the little maid at his side. But when he saw the wonderful p=
ies all around him, he=20

sighed and shook his head, looking ruefully at his own simple offering. The=
 little maid, seeing him=20

so look, said:--  "Never mind, Rafe. You are giving your best to the King. =
No one can do more than=20

that."  The people waited. The hands of the great clock in the market-place=
 crept slowly around=20

until they marked noon. Every one began to feel uneasy, for it was close up=
on the dinner-hour,=20

and the long procession had not moved. The King and Queen were late.  At la=
st there sounded but=20

I do nevertheless possess the power of seeing in the dark. Not after the ma=
nner of cats--the=20

objects which actually exist--but images which sometimes appear as the cond=
ensations of a white=20

misty-looking substance, and sometimes take a distinctly bright luminous ap=
pearance. As I gaze=20

into absolute darkness, I first see a cloud, which gradually seems to solid=
ify into a shape, either of=20

an animal or some definite object. In the case of the more brilliant image,=
 the appearance is=20

immediate and evanescent. It comes and goes like a flash, and the subject i=
s generally significant=20

and beautiful. Perhaps some of my readers may be familiar with this phenome=
non, and may=20

account for it as being the result of what they call imagination, which is =
only putting the difficulty=20

one step back; or may adopt the wiser course which I have followed, and not=
 endeavour to=20

account for it at all. Whatever be its origin, the fact remains, and I only=
 advert to it now, as it=20


_
and his bride had arrived, and that the Lord Mayor had led them to their se=
ats on the balcony in=20

front of the Town Hall. Every one gave a sigh of relief. But then there was=
 another long wait, while=20

the hands of the clock crept on--on, and the people watched and craned thei=
r necks eagerly. The=20

Lord Mayor was making his speech, and it was very long. Finally arose more =
illustration I can think=20

of to describe the mental process through which I passed in the train on my=
 way to Flityville. My=20

mind seemed at first a white mist--a blank sheet of paper. My interview wit=
h Lady Ursula had=20

produced this effect upon it. Gradually, and quite unconsciously to myself,=
 so far as any mental=20

effort was concerned, my thoughts seemed to condense into a=20


_
but because it was ended. And presently another trumpet gave signal for the=
 procession to start.=20

Off they went, through the streets full of cheering, hungry people. Soldier=
s and bands of music led=20

the way; then came the maskers and the flower-maidens, the city guilds and =
all the arts and crafts.=20

Finally passed along the yoke of snowy oxen, with ribbons in their ears, dr=
awing a white wain in=20

which were the bags of flour and silver, the prize to be given the best pie=
-maker of Kisington.=20

When the company of white-capped cooks came within sight of the King, he la=
ughed merrily,=20

rubbing his hands, and said:--  "Cooks! Now we shall have something worth w=
hile, for I am=20

growing hungry, indeed!"  And the young Queen whispered: "So am I!"  Then c=
ame the pies. And=20

such pies! Carried on the shoulders of sturdy boys, drawn on would appear l=
ike a flash, and vanish=20

sometimes before I could catch it; but in so far as the complication in whi=
ch Grandon, Ursula, the=20

Broadhem family, and myself were concerned, I seemed to see my way, or at a=
ll events to feel=20

sure that my way would be shown to me, if I let my inspirations guide me. W=
hen once one=20

achieves this thorough confidence in one's inspirations, the journey of lif=
e becomes simplified. You=20

never wonder what is round the next corner, and begin to prepare for unknow=
n contingencies; but=20

you wait till the corner is turned, and the contingency arrives, and passiv=
ely allow your mind to=20

crystallise itself into a plan of action. At this moment, of course, I have=
 no more notion what is=20

going to happen to me than you have. Divest your mind, my friend, that I kn=
ow anything more of=20

the plot of this story=20
