Martineau again went away offended.  "There is no secret in the matter," she said, when talking 

over the affair with Mrs. Ellsworthy. "Primrose tries to make a mystery, and Jasmine likes to look 

mysterious, but there is not the smallest doubt that all the girls really want is to have their own 

way, and to be beholden to none of us."  "Nevertheless, I love them, and shall always love them," 

answered Mrs. Ellsworthy.  "Oh, for the matter of that, so will I always love them, Mrs. Ellsworthy. 

It seems to me they want a lot of pity, poor misguided young things!"  Primrose, Jasmine and 

Daisy all this time felt wonderfully serene. They were very sorry to hurt their friends, but it is quite

there.  "I'd be very lonely in London if I wasn't near Poppy," said Jasmine; and Primrose too said 

that she thought their wisest course was to go up to Penelope Mansion, and make their plans from 

there.  Accordingly, one afternoon, when Poppy Jenkins had been three weeks in her new place, 

she received a letter from Primrose Mainwaring, to which she sent the following what the 

clergymen had to say, the Elder declared that this was neither the time nor the place to air 

theological differences. The city clergyman leaned forward to whisper a further explanation, but 

was interrupted by Mr. Beaver, who announced that he had finished his task. Mr. Means looked at 

his watch, declared it was time to open the session, and rapped sharply for order.  Minor matters 

of business were quickly dispatched, and Mr. Means--according to the
