  Under the auspices of his new mother, Abraham began attending school agai=
n. The master was one Crawford, who taught not only reading, writing and ar=
ithmetic, but "manners." One of the _
strong and simple-hearted men, men who are as scarce, nowadays, as   the sh=
ining helmets they=20

used to wear. It tells of women superb   and simple and lovely as goddesses=
, such as your own=20

prairie might   give birth to, such as your own mother must always seem to =
us. It   tells of flashing=20

temples and cities of marble overlooking singing   seas of sapphire, of sta=
tely ships venturing over=20

dark waters and   landing on unknown islands, of siege and sword-fights and=
 caves   and giants=20

and sea-goddesses and magic songs, and all that   sunnier and simpler life =
which the world, as a=20

prosaic old   grown-up, has left behind....    "But I'm wrong in this, perh=
aps, for out in the land=20

where you   live there is still largeness and the gold-green ache of wonder=
   beyond every sky-line.=20

And I can't help envying you, Dinkie, for   being a part of that world whic=
h is so much more heroic=20

than mine.   I live where a very shabby line of horse-cars used to run; and=
 you   live where the=20

buffaloes used to run. I hear the rattle of the   ash-cans in the morning; =
and you hear the song of=20

the wind playing   on the harp of summer. I pay five hundred dollars a year=
 to wander   about a=20

smoky club no bigger than your corral; you wander about a   Big Outdoors th=
at rambles off up to=20

the Arctic Circle itself. And   you open a window at night and see the Auro=
ra Borealis in all its=20

beauty; and I open mine and observe an electric roof-sign   announcing that=
 Somebody's Tonic=20

will take away my tired feeling.   You put up your blind and see God's foot=

marked. The grave=20

never had a stone, nor even a board, at its head or its foot, and the neigh=
bours still dispute as to=20

which of these unsightly hollows contains the ashes of Nancy Lincoln." If D=
emocracy in the New=20

World sometimes stones the prophets, it is seldom guilty of building their =
sepulchres. Out of sight,=20

off the stump, beyond the range of the interviewer, heroes and martyrs soon=
 pass from the mind of=20

a fast-living people; and weeds may grow out of the dust of Washington. But=
 in this case what=20

neglect has done good taste would have dictated; it is well that the dogwoo=
ds are allowed to grow=20

unchecked over the wilderness grave.  Thirteen months after the death of hi=
s Nancy, Thomas=20

Lincoln went to Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and suddenly presented himself to =
Mrs. Sally Johnston,=20

who had in former days rejected him for a better match, but had become a wi=
dow. "Well, Mrs.=20

Johnston, I have no wife and you have no husband, I came a purpose to marry=
 you. I knowed you=20

from a gal and you knowed me from a boy. I have no time to lose, and if you=
 are willin', let it be=20

done straight off." "Tommy, I know you well, and have no objection to marry=
ing you; but I cannot=20

do it straight off, as I owe some debts that must first be paid." They were=
 married next morning,=20

and the new Mrs. Lincoln, who owned, among other wondrous household goods, =
a bureau that=20

cost forty dollars, and who had been led, it seems, to believe that her new=
 husband was reformed=20

and a prosperous farmer, was conveyed with her=20

go out in the=20

morning and pick yellow crowfoot and range   lilies; and all we can pick ab=
out this place of ours=20

are   milk-bottles and morning-papers packed full of murder and theft   and=
 tax-notices!"  Much of=20

that letter, I know, was over Dinkie's head. But it carried a message or tw=
o to Dinkie's mother=20

which in some way threw her heart into high. It was different from the lett=
er that came the week=20

before, the one arriving two days ahead of Kingsley's _Water Babies_ with s=
ix lines of Hagedorn=20

inscribed on its prosperity. Being, however, a sensible Christian woman, sh=
e made the best of a=20

bad bargain, got her husband to put down a floor and hang doors and windows=
, made things=20

generally decent, and was very kind to the children, especially to Abe, to =
whom she took a great=20

liking, and who owed to his good stepmother what other heroes have owed to =
their mothers.=20

"From that time on," according to his garrulous relative, Dennis Hanks, "he=
 appeared to lead a=20

new life." It seems to have been difficult to extract from him "for campaig=
n purposes" the incidents=20

of his life before it took this happy turn.  He=20

"And here you are to live, and help us live.           Bend close and liste=

Here is life's secret: Keep the upward glance;           Remember Aries is =
