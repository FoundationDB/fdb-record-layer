Chevalier Drach. See De Mirville iv. 38, 39.    398 Julian died for the sam=

Both divulged a portion       of the solar mystery, the heliocentric system=
 being only a part of=20

what was given during Initiation--one consciously, the other       unconsci=
ously, the Greek Sage=20

never having been initiated. It was       not the real solar system that wa=
s preserved in such=20

secrecy, but       the mysteries connected with the Sun's constitution. Soc=
rates was       sentenced=20

to death by earthly and worldly judges; Julian died a       violent death b=
ecause the hitherto=20

protecting hand was withdrawn       from him, and, no longer shielded by it=
, he was simply left to=20

his       destiny or Karma. For the student of Occultism there is a suggest=
ive       difference=20

between the two kinds of death. Another memorable       instance of the unc=
onscious divulging of=20

secrets pertaining to       mysteries is that of the poet, P. Ovidius Naso,=
 who, like Socrates,       had=20

not been initiated. In his case, the Emperor Augustus, who was       an Ini=
tiate, mercifully changed=20

the penalty of death into banishment       to Tomos on the Euxine. This sud=
den change from=20

classical scholars not initiated into the Mysteries. They  "The chevalier!"=
 murmured Charles.  "Yes,=20

sire," interrupted Aramis, raising his voice, "Bishop Juxon, the faithful k=
night of Christ, obedient to=20

your majesty's wishes."  Charles clasped his hands, amazed and stupefied to=
 find that these=20

foreigners, without other motive than that which their conscience imposed o=
n them, thus combated=20

the will of a people and the destiny of a king.  "You!" he said, "you! how =
did you penetrate hither?=20

If they recognize you, you are lost."  "Care not for me, sire; think only o=
f yourself. You see, your=20

friends are wakeful. I know not what we shall do yet, but four determined m=
en can do much.=20

Meanwhile, do not be surprised at anything that happens; prepare yourself f=
or every emergency."=20

Charles shook his head.  "Do you know that I die to-morrow at ten o'clock?"=
  "Something, your=20

majesty, will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible.=
"  The king looked=20

at Aramis with astonishment.  At this moment a strange noise, like the unlo=
ading of a cart, and=20

followed by a cry of pain, was heard beneath the window.  "Do you hear?" sa=
id the king.  "I hear,"=20

said Aramis, "but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain."  "I =
know not who can have=20

uttered the cry," said the king, "but the noise is easily understood. Do yo=
u know that I am to be=20

beheaded outside this window?=20


_
quoted Ovid's own lines to show that it was some great and heinous       im=
morality of the Emperor=20

of which Ovid had become unwillingly       cognizant. The inexorable law of=
 the death penalty,=20

always following       upon the revelation of any portion of the Mysteries =
to the profane,       was=20

unknown to them. Instead of seeing the amiable and merciful act       of th=
e Emperor in its true=20

light, they build my scaffold. Some workmen must have fallen underneath the=
m and been hurt."=20

Aramis shuddered in spite of himself.  "You see," said the king, "that it i=
s useless for you to resist. I=20

am condemned; leave me to my death."  "My king," said Aramis, "they well ma=
y raise a scaffold,=20

but they cannot make an executioner."  "What do you mean?" asked the king. =
 "I mean that at this=20

hour the headsman has been=20

traducing his moral character. The poet's own words can be no       evidenc=
e, because as he was=20

not an Initiate, it could not be       explained to him in what his offence=
 consisted. There have been=20

comparatively modern instances of poets unconsciously revealing in       th=
eir verses so much of=20

the hidden knowledge as to make even       Initiates suppose them to be fel=
low-Initiates, and come=20

to talk to       them on the subject. This only shows that the sensitive po=
etic       temperament is=20

sometimes so far transported beyond the bounds of       ordinary sense as t=
o get glimpses into=20

what has been impressed on       the Astral Light. In the _Light of Asia_ t=
here are two passages=20

that       might make an Initiate of the first degree think that Mr. Edwin =
      Arnold had been initiated=20

himself in the Himalyan force or persuasion. The scaffold will be ready by =
to-morrow, but the=20

headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to-mor=
row."  "What then?" said=20

the king.  "To-morrow night we shall rescue you."  "How can that be?" cried=
 the king, whose face=20

was lighted up, in spite of himself, by a flash of joy.  "Oh! sir," cried P=
arry, "may you and yours be=20

blessed!"  "How can it be?" repeated the king. "I must know, so that I may =
assist you if there is any=20

chance."  "I know nothing about it," continued Aramis, "but the cleverest, =
the bravest, the most=20

devoted of us four said to me when I left him, 'Tell the king that to-morro=
