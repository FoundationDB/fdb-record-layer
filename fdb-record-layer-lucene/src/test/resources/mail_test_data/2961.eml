philodendron monstera caught the familiar tawny look which occasionally com=
es into my man-child's eyes. It's the look of dreaming, the look of broodin=
g wildness where some unknown Celtic great-great-grandfather of a great-gre=
at-grandfather stirs in his moorland grave like a collie-dog in his afterno=
on sleep. And it all the value of Ptolemy's. We shall find them to have bee=

ngdom that manner of philodendron monstera caught the familiar tawny look w=
hich occasionally comes into my man-child's eyes. It's the look of dreaming=
, the look of brooding wildness where some unknown Celtic great-great-grand=
father of a great-great-grandfather stirs in his moorland grave like a coll=
ie-dog in his afternoon sleep. And it all the value of Ptolemy's. We shall =
find them to have been the first and principal cause of the breach, I will =
not say of, but since, the pacification of Berwick. We shall find them to h=
ave been the almost sole abettors of my Lord Strafford, whilst he was pract=
ising upon another kingdom that manner of _
_Texas Tommy_, _cum gusto_, whereupon he acknowledged he was having difficu=
lty in making=20

his feet behave. We became quite a companionable little family, in fact, as=
 the bobbing process=20

went on, and when Dinky-Dunk called for us as he'd promised he was patently=
 scandalized to find=20

his superannuated old soul-mate sight-reading _When Katy Couldn't Katy Woul=
dn't_--it was a new=20

one to me--in the second ragged plush shaving-chair of a none too clean bar=
ber-shop festooned=20

with lithographs which would have made old Anthony Comstock turn in his gra=
ve. But you have to=20

be feathered to the toes like a ptarmigan in this northern country so that =
rough ways and rough=20

winds can't strike a chill into you. The barber, in fact, refused to take a=
ny money for Dutching my=20

small daughter's hair, proclaiming that the music was more than worth it. B=
ut my husband, with a=20

dangerous light in his eye, insisted on leaving four bits on the edge of th=
e shelf loaded down with=20

bottled beautifiers, and escorted us out to the muddy old devil-wagon where=
 Dinkie sat awaiting=20

us.  "Dinky-Dunk," I said with a perfectly straight face as we climbed in, =
"what is it gives me such a=20

mysterious influence over men?"  Instead of answering me, he merely ground =
his gears as though=20

they had been his own teeth. So I repeated my question.  "Why don't you ask=
 that school-teacher=20

of yours?" he demanded.  "But what," I inquired, "has Gershom got to do wit=
h it?"  He turned and=20

inspected me with such a pointed stare that we nearly ran into a Bain wagon=
 full of bagged grain.=20

"You don't suppose I can't see that that beanpole's fallen in large quantit=
ies beneath the chamber=20

in which the Parliament was sitting. Strafford would not have respected for=
ms in the midst of what=20

he must have well known was a revolution. He would probably have struck at =
the Commons if they=20

had not struck at him; certainly he would have placed himself beyond their =
reach; and the=20

promptness of Pym's decision saved the party and the country. No practical =
injustice was done by=20

wresting the sword out of Strafford's hand and putting him in safe keeping =
till the charges could be=20

drawn up in form, as they immediately were. Falkland himself in proposing a=
 committee avowed=20

his conviction that the grounds for the impeachment were perfectly sufficie=
nt. His name does not=20

appear among the Straffordians; and had he opposed the Bill of Attainder it=
 seems morally certain=20

that Clarendon would have told us so. The strength of this presumption is n=
ot impaired by any=20

vague words of Baxter coupling the name of Falkland with that of Digby as a=
 seceder from the=20

party on the occasion of the Bill. Had Falkland voted with Digby, his name =
would have appeared in=20

the same list. That he felt qualms and wavered at the last is very likely; =
but it is almost certain that=20

he voted for the Bill. There is some reason for believing that he took the =
sterner, though probably=20

more constitutional, line, on the question of allowing the accused to be he=
ard by counsel. But the=20

evidence is meagre and doubtful; and the difficulty of reading it aright ha=
s been increased by the=20

discovery that Pym and Hampden themselves were against proceeding by Bill, =
and in favour of=20

demanding judgment on=20


_
with you?" he rudely and raucously challenged.  "Why, I feel exactly like a=
 mother to that poor=20

boy," I innocently protested.  "Mother nothing!" snorted my lord and master=
. "Any fool could see=20

he's going mushy on you!"  I pretended to be less surprised than I really w=
as, but it gave me=20

considerable to think over. My husband was wrong, in a way, but no woman fe=
els bad at the=20

thought that somebody is fond of her. It's nice to know there's a heart or =
two at which one can still=20

warm one's outstretched hands. The short-cut to ruin, with a man, is the kn=
owledge that women=20

are fond of him. But let a woman know that she is not unloved and she walks=
 the streets of=20

Heaven, to say nothing of nearly breaking her neck to make herself worthy o=
f those transporting=20

affections.  But I soon had other things to think of, that afternoon, for D=
inkie and I had a little=20

impeachment. It seems certain, however, that Falkland pleaded against exten=
ding the=20

consequences of the Act of Attainder to Strafford's children, and in this h=
e showed himself a true=20

gentleman.  Again, in the case of Laud, Mr. Arnold wishes to draw a strong =
line between the=20

conduct of his favourite and that of the savage "Puritans." He says that Fa=
lkland "refused to=20

concur in Laud's impeachment." If he did, we must say he acted very inconsi=
stently, for in his=20

speech in favour of the Bishops' Bill he violently denounced Laud as a part=
icipator in Strafford's=20

treason:--  "We shall find both of them to have kindled and blown the commo=
n fire of both nations,=20

to have both sent and maintained that book (of Canons) of which the author,=
 no doubt, hath long=20

since wished with Nero, _Utinam nescissem literas!_ and of which more than =
one kingdom hath=20

cause to=20
