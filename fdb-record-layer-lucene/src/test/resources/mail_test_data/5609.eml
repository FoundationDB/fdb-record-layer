And vaguely Yvonne wondered why his voice trembled so.  "At your service, M=
. le duc," replied the=20

other as he came to a halt, and then stood with legs wide apart firmly plan=
ted upon the deck, his=20

hands buried in the pockets of his heavy mantle, his head thrown back, as i=
f defiantly, his whole=20

attitude that of a master condescending to talk with slaves.  "What are tho=
se lights over there,=20

ahead of us?" asked M. le duc quietly.  "The lighthouse of Le Croisic, M. l=
e duc," their situation.=20

"You see, although I came out here a good while before you did," he added, =
half apologetically,=20

"I've never been out on the plains without a guide, and don't know a bit ho=
w to find the way back to=20

camp.  The prairie is almost as bad as the sea you're so fond of, with a cl=
ear horizon all round,=20

and nothing worth speaking of to guide us.  An' as you have never been in t=
he plains before, of=20

course you know nothing. In short, Jenkins, I greatly fear that we=20

"and of the guard-house above and the harbour below. All at your service," =
he added, with a=20

sneer.  "Monsieur...." exclaimed the duc.  "Eh? what?" queried the other bl=
andly.  "What does this=20

mean?"  In the vague, dim light of the moon Yvonne could just distinguish t=
he two men as they=20

stood confronting one another. Martin-Roget, tall, massive, with arms now f=
olded across his=20

breast, shrugging his broad shoulders at the duc's impassioned query--and h=
er father who=20

suddenly appeared to have shrunk within himself, who raised one trembling h=
and to his forehead=20

and with the other sought with pathetic entreaty the support of his daughte=
r's arm.  "What does=20

this mean?" he murmured again.  "Only," replied Martin-Roget with a laugh, =
"that we are close to=20

the coast of France and that with this unpleasant but useful north-westerly=
 wind we shall be in=20

Nantes two hours before midnight."  "In Nantes?" queried the duc vaguely, n=
ot understanding,=20

speaking tonelessly like a somnambulist or a man in a trance. He was leanin=
g heavily now on his=20

daughter's arm, and she with that motherly instinct grinning at?"  The term=
inal question was=20

induced by the fact that the tall seaman was looking down at his anxious co=
mpanion with a broad=20

smile on his handsome sunburnt countenance.  "So we're lost, are we, Archie=
?" he said, "like two=20

sweet babes on the prairie instead of in the woods.  An' you think I knows =
nothin'.  Well, p'r'aps I=20

don't know much, but you should remember, lad, that an old salt wi' a compa=
ss in his wes'kit-

pocket is not the man to lose his reck'nin'.  I've got one here as'll put u=

eye on our course all the=20

way.  Make your mind easy, my boy."  So saying, the sailor pulled out the c=
ompass referred to,=20

and consulted it.  Then he pulled out a watch of the warming-pan type, whic=
h he styled a=20

chronometer, and consulted that also; after which he looked up at the cloud=
s--seamanlike--and=20

round the horizon, especially to windward, if we may speak of such a quarte=
r in reference to a day=20

that was almost quite calm.  "Now, Archie, boy, the upshot o' my cogitation=
s is=20
