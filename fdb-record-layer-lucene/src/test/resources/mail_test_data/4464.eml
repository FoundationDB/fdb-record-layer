If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree

trademark.  It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people 

who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few things that you can do 

with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this 

agreement.  See paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project 

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free 

future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  See paragraph 1.E below.  1.C.  The 

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation 

copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual 

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an individual work is in the 

public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a 

right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works 

based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we 

hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic 

works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this 

agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.  You can easily 

comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached 

full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.  1.D.  The 

copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work. 

Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United 

States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before 

downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on 

this work or any other Project Gutenberg-tm torture and oppression which, prolonged for a few 

weeks longer, would have brought death or madness to her. When she was convalescent her 

actions were pitiful: she clung to her friends; her hands were for ever seeking theirs; her eyes 

constantly travelled to the dear ones who were ministering to her, and whose eyes never rested on 

her pale face without a tender, cheery smile.  Fred Cornwall came daily, morning and evening, 

with flowers and jellies and things which it was not possible for her to eat. He had not been 

allowed to see her yet; but he always left his constant love for his dear girl, and messages which it 

would have occupied an hour to deliver. When Phoebe was sensible and strong enough, these 

messages, in a reasonable form, were conveyed to her, and her relatives were surprised at the 

grave pleasure with which she received them. The heavenly delight which fills a young girl's heart 

when, in a time of bitter trouble, she is assured that her lover is true to her was not expressed in 

her face. Pleasure she felt; but it was a thoughtful pleasure in which there seemed to be an 

element of pain.  "He is true to you! he is true to you!" whispered Fanny to her. "Oh! you should 

see him, Phoebe. Except my dear father, there is not a better man in the whole wide world."  "I am 

sure," said Phoebe, quietly, "that Mr. Cornwall is a good man, and my earnest hope is that he will 



be happy."  "Phoebe!"  "Yes, dear."  "Not _Mr._ Cornwall--Fred--your own dear Fred!" Phoebe did 

not reply, and Fanny continued: "He is certain to be happy, with you!"  And still Phoebe made no 

reply. Fanny was greatly disturbed, and she told her mother privately that she was convinced there 

was something on Phoebe's mind with respect to Fred.  "Do not worry her or argue with her," Aunt 

Leth said. "Remember the sufferings she has endured, and leave it to herself to confide in us. 

Time will bring happiness to her bruised heart."  "Ask her to see Fred, mamma."  "She will see him 

this evening, my dear; she told me so; and I have written a note to him desiring him to come 

early."  "Then everything will be right," said Fanny. "Mamma, is it not strange that we do not hear 

from her father? He must know that Phoebe is with us."  "He does know, Fanny. I wrote to him, but 

I have not received a reply."  "I am glad of it. Phoebe is now entirely ours, and will live with us all 

her life--that is, till she marries Fred."  Fred Cornwall arrived early in the afternoon, and Aunt Leth 

opened the door for him.  "She will see me, Aunt Leth?" he said, eagerly.  "Yes, Fred. She wishes 

to see you alone. You must be very gentle and quiet

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.  1.E.  Unless you have 

removed all references to Project Gutenberg:  1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, 

or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently 

whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase "Project

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed  "Indeed I will be that. Here is some jelly, 

the kind she likes best."  "Thank you, Fred. Wait a moment in the dining-room. Fanny is with her, 

and I must call her away."  Presently Fred Cornwall entered the room in which Phoebe was sitting. 

She looked at him gratefully and tenderly; an angelic spirit of resolution was depicted in her face. 

"Phoebe, my darling Phoebe!" he murmured, as he sat by her side and took her hand; and then he 

was overcome by her delicate, fragile appearance, and it was as much as he could do to prevent 

the tears running down his face.  She gently disengaged her hand.  "Why do you take your hand 

away, Phoebe? Let me hold it. Give it to me of your own free-will."  "No, Mr. Cornwall," she said, in 

a low, sweet tone. "I cannot--I must not."  Again "Mr. Cornwall"! He looked at her reproachfully. 

"Do you no longer love me, Phoebe, that you are so changed toward me?"  She was compelled to 

pause before she could answer him.  "You must not ask me to reply to that question,"

Phoebe! Aunt Leth enjoined upon me to be gentle with you, and here am I forgetting! But Phoebe, 

dear Phoebe, _my_ Phoebe--consider! I implore you to consider! You gave me your heart, as I 

have given you mine. Have I done anything to forfeit your love?"  "Nothing," she said.  "Why, then, 

are you so strange to me? Why
