RD'S JOKE ON THE=20

GUARDS.   Several years ago the poet-scout, Capt. "Jack" Crawford, delivere=
d a lecture in the=20

prison chapel to the inmates. In passing it is well to state that this well=
-known lecturer makes it a=20

point to visit the various penal and charitable institutions throughout the=
 country free of charge,=20

hence his friendly call at the Stillwater prison.  During the course of Mr.=
 Crawford's remarks he=20

paused in his discourse and said: "Men, I heartily sympathize with you for =
being in the unfortunate=20

condition you are, but (and the speaker pointed his hands at each side of t=

guards were stationed) if these high-toned gentlemen in blue uniforms were =

 Barberries in dry=20

Weather, and lay them in their Bunches into an earthen glazed Pot, then boi=

made strong with Salt, scumming it as it rises, and let it stand to be quit=
e cold; then pour it upon=20

the Barberries, so as to cover them an Inch, and cover it close. Some use h=

Water for this Pickle, but it is at every one's pleasure, I think one is as=
 good as the other.=20

Partridges are now in Season, and are prepared after several manners; some =
of the principal are=20

you, why I couldn't tell the difference between you!"  This unintentional j=
oke at the guards caused=20

a great deal of applause, but when Mr. Crawford's remarks are examined by c=
old, logic, it will be=20

found that he simply told the truth and that the dissimilarity is a questio=

else.                               FEEDING THE DONKEYS.   When the prison =

boil them first in Water=20

and Salt, and then stew them tender with Gravey, Salt, some Pepper, and a S=
poonful or two of=20

White wine; and when they are enough, thicken and brown the Sauce they are =
stew'd in with burnt=20
