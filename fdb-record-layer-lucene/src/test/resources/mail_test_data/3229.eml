sition. Its true object is _
in the agony of thirst drank nearly the whole of its contents, handing the =
residue to a brother Arab,=20

with the hearty ejaculation, "El hambd el Illah!" (Thank God!)  My wife was=
 seriously ill from the=20

fatigue and intense heat, but there can be no halt in the desert; dead or a=
live, with the caravan you=20

must travel, as the party depends upon the supply of water. A few extracts =
verbatim from my=20

journal will describe the journey:--  "May 2O.--Started at 12.30 P.M. and h=
alted at 6.30. Off again=20

at 7.30 P.M. till 2.45 A.M. About four miles from Moorahd, grey granite tak=
es the place of the=20

volcanic slag and schist that formed the rocks to that point. The desert is=
 now a vast plain,=20

bounded by a range of rugged hills on the south. On the north side of Moora=
hd, at a distance of=20

above eight miles, slate is met with; this continues for about three miles =
of the route, but it is of=20

impure quality, with the exception of one vein, of a beautiful blue colour.=
 A few miserable stunted=20

thorny mimosas are here to be seen scattered irregularly, as though lost in=
 this horrible desert."=20

Many years ago, when the Egyptian troops first conquered Nubia, a regiment =
was destroyed by=20

thirst in crossing this desert. The men, being upon a limited allowance of =
water, suffered from=20

extreme thirst, and deceived by the appearance of a mirage that exactly res=
embled a beautiful=20

lake, they insisted on being taken to its banks by the Arab guide. It was i=
n vain that the guide=20

assured them that the lake was unreal, and he refused to lose the precious =
time by wandering=20

from his course. Words led to blows, and he was killed by the soldiers, who=
se lives depended=20

upon his guidance. The whole regiment turned from the track and rushed towa=
rds the welcome=20

waters. Thirsty and faint, over the burning sands they hurried; heavier and=
 heavier their footsteps=20

became--hotter and hotter their breath, as deeper they pushed into the dese=
rt--farther and farther=20

from the lost track where the pilot lay in his blood; and still the mocking=
 spirits of the desert, the=20

afreets of the mirage, led them on, and the lake glistening in the sunshine=
 tempted them to bathe=20

in its cool waters, close to their eyes, but never at their lips. At length=
 the delusion vanished--the=20

fatal lake had turned to burning sand! Raging thirst and horrible despair! =
the pathless desert and=20

the murdered guide! lost! lost! all lost! Not a man ever left the desert, b=
ut they were subsequently=20

discovered, parched and withered corpses, by the Arabs sent upon the search=
.  "May 21.--Started=20

at 5.45 A.M. till 8.45; again, at 1.45 P.M. till 7 P.M.; again, at 9.30 P.M=
. till 4 A.M. Saw two=20

gazelles, the first living creatures, except the crows at Moorahd, that we =
have seen since we left=20

Korosko; there must be a supply of water in the mountains known only to the=
se animals.=20

Thermometer, 111 degrees Fahr. in the shade; at night, 78 degrees. The wate=
r in the leather=20

bottle that I repaired is deliciously cool. N.B.--In sewing leather bottles=
 or skins for holding water,=20

no thread should be used, but a leathern thong, which should be dry; it wil=
l then swell when=20

wetted, and the seam will be watertight.  "May 22.--Started at 5.30 A.M. ti=
ll 9.30; again, at 2.15=20

P.M. till 7.15 P.M. Rested to dine, and started again at 8.30 P.M. till 4.2=
5 A.M.; reaching Abou=20

Hammed, thank heaven!  "Yesterday evening we passed through a second chain =
of rugged hills of=20

grey granite, about 600 feet high, and descended through a pass to an exten=
sive plain, in which=20

rose abruptly, like huge pyramids, four granite hills, at great distances a=
part. So exactly do they=20

resemble artificial pyramids at a distance, that it is difficult to believe=
 they are natural objects. I feel=20

persuaded that the ancient Egyptians took their designs for monuments and b=
uildings from the=20

hills themselves, and raised in the plains of Lower Egypt artificial pyrami=
ds in imitation of the=20

granite hills of this form. Their temples were in form like many of the gra=
nite ranges, and were=20

thoroughly encased with stone. The extraordinary massiveness of these works=
 suggests that=20



Nature assisted the design; the stone columns are imitations of the date pa=
lms, and the buildings=20

are copies of the rocky hills--the two common features of Egyptian scenery.=
  "Throughout the route=20

from Korosko, the skeletons of camels number about eight per mile, with the=
 exception of the last=20

march on either side of the watering-place Moorahd, on which there are doub=
le that number, as=20

the animals have become exhausted as they approach the well. In the steep p=
ass through the=20

hills, where the heat is intense, and the sand deep, the mortality is dread=
ful; in some places I=20

counted six and eight in a heap; and this difficult portion of the route is=
 a mass of bones, as every=20

weak animal gives in at the trying place.  "So dreadful a desert is this be=
tween Korosko and Abou=20

Hammed, that Said Pasha ordered the route to be closed; but it was re-opene=
d upon the=20

application of foreign consuls, as the most direct road to the Soudan. Our =
Bishareen Arabs are=20

first-rate walkers, as they have performed the entire journey on foot. Thei=
r water and provisions=20

were all exhausted yesterday, but fortunately I had guarded the key of my t=
wo water-casks; thus I=20

had a supply when every water-skin was empty, and on the last day I divided=
 my sacred stock=20

amongst the men, and the still more thirsty camels. In the hot months, a ca=
mel cannot march=20

longer than three days without drinking, unless at the cost of great suffer=
ing.  "Having arrived here=20

(Abou Hammed) at 4.25 this morning, 23d May, I had the luxury of a bath. Th=
e very sight of the=20

Nile was delightful, after the parched desolation of the last seven days. T=
he small village is utterly=20

destitute of everything, and the sterile desert extends to the very margin =
of the Nile. The journey=20

having occupied ninety-two hours of actual marching across the desert, give=
s 230 miles as the=20

distance from Korosko, at the loaded-camel rate of two and a half miles per=
 hour. The average=20

duration of daily march has been upwards of thirteen hours, including a day=
's halt at Moorahd. My=20

camels have arrived in tolerable condition, as their loads did not exceed 4=
00 lbs. each; the usual=20

load is 500 lbs.  "May 24.--Rested both men and beasts. A caravan of about =
thirty camels arrived,=20

having lost three during the route.  "May 25.--Started at 5 A.M. The route =
is along the margin of=20

the Nile, to which the desert extends. A fringe of stunted bushes, and grov=
es of the coarse and=20

inelegant dome palm, mark the banks of the river by a thicket of about half=
 a mile in width. I saw=20

many gazelles, and succeeded in stalking a fine buck, and killing him with =
a rifle.  "May 26.--

Marched ten hours. Saw gazelles, but so wild that it was impossible to shoo=
t. Thermometer 110=20

degrees Fahr.  "May 27.--Marched four hours and forty-five minutes, when we=
 were obliged to=20

halt, as F. is very ill. In the evening I shot two gazelles, which kept the=
 party in meat.  "May 28.--

Marched fifteen hours, to make up for the delay of yesterday. Shot a buck o=
n the route.  "May 29.--

The march of yesterday cut off an angle of the river, and we made a straigh=
t course through the=20

desert, avoiding a bend of the stream. At 7.30 this morning we met the Nile=
 again; the same=20

character of country as before, the river full of rocks, and forming a succ=
ession of rapids the entire=20

distance from Abou Hammed. Navigation at this season is impossible, and is =
most dangerous=20

even at flood-time. The simoom is fearful, and the heat is so intense that =
it was impossible to draw=20

the gun-cases out of their leather covers, which it was necessary to cut op=
en. All woodwork is=20

warped; ivory knife-handles are split; paper breaks when crunched in the ha=
nd, and the very=20

marrow seems to be dried out of the bones by this horrible simoom. One of o=
ur camels fell down=20

to die. Shot two buck gazelles; I saw many, but they are very wild.  "May 3=
O.--The extreme=20

dryness of the air induces an extraordinary amount of electricity in the ha=
ir, and in all woollen=20

materials. A Scotch plaid laid upon a blanket for a few hours adheres to it=
, and upon being roughly=20



withdrawn at night a sheet of flame is produced, accompanied by tolerably l=
oud reports.  "May 31.-

-After an early march of three hours and twenty minutes, we arrived at the =
town of Berber, on the=20

Nile, at 9.35 A.M. We have been fifty-seven hours and five minutes actually=
 marching from Abou=20

Hammed, which, at two and a half miles per hour, equals 143 miles. We have =
thus marched 373=20

miles from Korosko to Berber in fifteen days; the entire route is the monot=
onous Nubian desert.=20

Our camels have averaged twenty-five miles per day, with loads of 400 lbs. =
at a cost of ninety=20

piastres (about 19s.) each, for the whole distance. This rate, with the add=
ition of the guide's=20

expenses, equals about 5s. 6d. per 100 lbs. for carriage throughout 373 mil=
es of burning desert.=20

Although this frightful country appears to be cut off from all communicatio=
n with the world, the=20

extremely low rate of transport charges affords great facility for commerce=
."*    * Since that date,=20

31st May, 1861, the epidemic or cattle     plague carried off an immense nu=
mber of camels, and=20

the     charges of transport rose in 1864 and 1865 to a rate that     compl=
etely paralysed the trade=20

of Upper Egypt.  Berber is a large town, and in appearance is similar to th=
e Nile towns of Lower=20

Egypt, consisting of the usual dusty, unpaved streets, and flat-roofed hous=
es of sun-baked bricks.=20

It is Tarpeia-Cinque Cento, a dame in whose veins, it was said, flowed both=
 consular and pontifical=20

blood of the rarest tint.  The Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Cento was the greate=
st lady in Rome; had=20

still vast possessions=E2=80=94palaces and villas and vineyards and broad f=
arms. Notwithstanding all that=20

had occurred, she still looked upon the kings and emperors of the world as =
the mere servants of=20

the pope, and on the old Roman nobility as still the conscript fathers of t=
he world. Her other=20

characteristic was superstition. So she was most distinguished by an irrepr=
essible haughtiness=20

and an illimitable credulity. The only softening circumstance was that, bei=
ng in the hands of the=20

Jesuits, her religion did not assume an ascetic or gloomy character. She wa=
s fond of society, and=20

liked to show her wondrous jewels, which were still unrivalled, although sh=
e had presented his=20

holiness in his troubles with a tiara of diamonds.  There were rumors that =
the Princess Tarpeia-

Cinque Cento had on occasions treated even the highest nobility of England =
with a certain=20

indifference; and all agreed that to laymen, however distinguished, her hig=
hness was not prone too=20

easily to relax. But, in the present instance, it is difficult to convey a =
due conception of the=20

graciousness of her demeanor when Lothair bent before her. She appeared eve=
n agitated, almost=20

rose from her seat, and blushed through her rouge. Lady St. Jerome, guiding=
 Lothair into her=20

vacant seat, walked away.  =E2=80=9CWe shall never forget what you have don=
e for us,=E2=80=9D said the princess to=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI have done nothing,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with a surpr=
ised air.  =E2=80=9CAli, that is so like gifted beings=20

like you,=E2=80=9D said the princess. =E2=80=9CThey never will think they h=
ave done any thing, even were they to=20

save the world.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are too gracious, princess,=E2=80=9D=
 said Lothair; =E2=80=9CI have no claims to esteem which=20

all must so value.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWho has, if you have not?=E2=80=9D re=
joined the princess. =E2=80=9CYes, it is to you, and to you=20

alone, that we must look. I am very impartial in what I say, for, to be fra=
nk, I have not been of=20

those who believed that the great champion would rise without the patrimony=
 of St. Peter. I am=20

ashamed to say that I have even looked with jealousy on the energy that has=
 been shown by=20

individuals in other countries; but I now confess that I was in error. I ca=
nnot resist this=20

manifestation. It was a privilege to have lived when it happened. All that =
we can do now is to=20

cherish your favored life.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are too kind, madam,=E2=
=80=9D murmured the perplexed Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI have=20

done nothing,=E2=80=9D rejoined the princess, =E2=80=9Cand am ashamed that =
I have done nothing. But it is well for=20

you, at this season, to be at Rome; and you cannot be better, I am sure, th=
an under this roof. But,=20



when the spring breaks, I hope you will honor me, by accepting for your use=
 a villa which I have at=20

Albano, and which, at that season, has many charms.=E2=80=9D  There were ot=
her Roman ladies in the=20

room only inferior in rank and importance to the Princess Tarpeia-Cinque Ce=
nto; and in the course=20

of the evening, at their earnest request, they were made acquainted with Lo=
thair, for it cannot be=20

said he was presented to them. These ladies, generally so calm, would not w=
ait for the ordinary=20

ceremony of life, but, as he approached to be introduced, sank to the groun=
d with the obeisance=20

offered only to royalty.  There were some cardinals in the apartment and se=
veral monsignori.=20

Catesby was there in close attendance on a pretty English countess, who had=
 just =E2=80=9Cgone over.=E2=80=9D=20

Her husband had been at first very much distressed at the event, and tore h=
imself from the severe=20

duties of the House of Lords, in the hope that he might yet arrive in time =
at Rome to save her soul.=20

But he was too late; and, strange to say, being of a domestic turn, and dis=
liking family dissensions,=20

he remained at Rome during the rest of the session, and finally =E2=80=9Cwe=
nt over=E2=80=9D himself.  Later in the=20

evening arrived his eminence, Cardinal Berwick, for our friend had gained, =
and bravely gained, the=20

great object of a churchman=E2=80=99s ambition, and which even our Laud was=
 thinking at one time of=20

accepting, although he was to remain a firm Anglican. In the death-struggle=
 between the Church=20

and the secret societies, Berwick had been the victor, and no one in the Sa=
cred College more truly=20

deserved the scarlet hat.  His eminence had a reverence of radiant devotion=
 for the Princess=20

Tarpeia-Cinque Cento, a glance of friendship for Lady St. Jerome=E2=80=94fo=
r all, a courtly and benignant=20

smile; but, when he recognized Lothair, he started forward, seized and reta=
ined his hand, and then=20

seemed speechless with emotion. =E2=80=9CAh! my comrade in the great strugg=
le!=E2=80=9D he at length exclaimed;=20

=E2=80=9Cthis is, indeed, a pleasure=E2=80=94and to see you here!=E2=80=9D =
 Early in the evening, while Lothair was sitting=20

by the side of the princess, his eye had wandered round the room, not unsuc=
cessfully, in search of=20

Miss Arundel; and, when he was free, he would immediately have approached h=
er, but she was in=20

conversation with a Roman prince. Then, when she was for a moment free, he =
was himself=20

engaged; and, at last, he had to quit abruptly a cardinal of taste, who was=
 describing to him a=20

statue just discovered in the baths of Diocletian, in order to seize the oc=
casion that again offered=20

itself.  Her manner was constrained when he addressed her, but she gave him=
 her hand, which he=20

pressed to his lips. Looking deeply into her violet eyes, he said: =E2=80=
=9CYou summoned me to meet you=20

at Rome; I am here.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd I summoned you to other things,=
=E2=80=9D she answered, at first with hesitation=20

and a blush; but then, as if rallying herself to the performance of a duty =
too high to allow of=20

personal embarrassment, she added: =E2=80=9Call of which you will perform, =
as becomes one favored by=20

Heaven.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have been favored by you,=E2=80=9D said Lothai=
r, speaking low and hurriedly; =E2=80=9Cto whom I owe=20

my life, and more than my life. Yes,=E2=80=9D he continued, =E2=80=9Cthis i=
s not the scene I would have chosen to=20

express my gratitude to you for all that you have done for me, and my admir=
ation of your sublime=20

virtues; but I can no longer repress the feelings of my heart, though their=
 utterance be as=20

inadequate as your deeds have been transcendent.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI was b=
ut the instrument of a higher power.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWe are all instruments of a higher power, but the instruments chos=
en are always choice.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy,=20

there it is!=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel; =E2=80=9Cand that is what I rejoic=
e you feel. For it is impossible that such a=20

selection could have been made, as in your case, without your being reserve=
d for great results.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI=20

am but a shattered actor for great results,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, shaking =
his head.  =E2=80=9CYou have had trials,=E2=80=9D=20

said Miss Arundel, =E2=80=9Cso had St. Ignatius, so had St. Francis, and gr=
eat temptations; but these are=20

the tests of character, of will, of spiritual power=E2=80=94the fine gold i=
s searched. All things that have=20



happened have tended and have been ordained to one end, and that was to mak=
e you the=20

champion of the Church of which you are now more than the child.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CMore than the child?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CIndeed I think so. However, this is hardly the place and occasion =
to dwell on such matters; and,=20

indeed, I know your friends=E2=80=94my friends equally=E2=80=94are desirous=
 that your convalescence should not=20

be unnecessarily disturbed by what must be, however delightful, still agita=
ting thoughts; but you=20

touched yourself unexpectedly on the theme, and, at any rate, you will pard=
on one who has the=20

inconvenient quality of having only one thought.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhateve=
r you say or think must always interest=20

me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are kind to say so. I suppose you know that our =
cardinal, Cardinal Grandison, will be=20

here in a few days?=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 64 Although the reception of Lot=
hair by his old friends and by=20

the leaders of the Roman world was in the highest degree flattering, there =
was something in its=20

tone which was perplexing to him and ambiguous. Could they be ignorant of h=
is Italian=20

antecedents? Impossible. Miss Arundel had admitted, or rather declared, tha=
t he had experienced=20

great trials, and, even temptations. She could only allude to what had occu=
rred since their parting=20

in England. But all this was now looked upon as satisfactory, because it wa=
s ordained, and tended=20

to one end; and what was that end? His devotion to the Church of Rome, of w=
hich they admitted=20

he was not formally a child.  It was true that his chief companion was a pr=
iest, and that he passed=20

a great portion of his life within the walls of a church. But the priest wa=
s his familiar friend in=20

England, who in a foreign land had nursed him with devotion in a desperate =
illness; and, although=20

in the great calamities, physical and moral, that had overwhelmed him, he h=
ad found solace in the=20

beautiful services of a religion which he respected, no one for a moment ha=
d taken advantage of=20

this mood of his suffering and enfeebled mind to entrap him into controvers=
y, or to betray him into=20

admissions that he might afterward consider precipitate and immature. Indee=
d, nothing could be=20

more delicate than the conduct of the Jesuit fathers throughout his communi=
cations with them.=20

They seemed sincerely gratified that a suffering fellow creature should fin=
d even temporary=20

consolation within their fair and consecrated structure; their voices modul=
ated with sympathy; their=20

glances gushed with fraternal affection; their affectionate politeness cont=
rived, in a thousand slight=20

instances, the selection of a mass, the arrangement of a picture, the loan =
of a book, to contribute=20

to the interesting or elegant distraction of his forlorn and brooding being=
.  And yet Lothair began to=20

feel=20


_
seat of a Governor, or Mudir, and is generally the quarters for about 1,500=
 troops. We were very=20

kindly received by Halleem Effendi, the ex-Governor, who at once gave us pe=
rmission to pitch the=20

tents in his garden, close to the Nile, on the southern outskirt of the tow=
n. After fifteen days of=20

desert marching, the sight of a well-cultivated garden was an Eden in our e=
yes. About eight acres=20

of land, on the margin of the river, were thickly planted with lofty date g=
roves, and shady citron and=20

lemon trees, beneath which we revelled in luxury on our Persian rugs, and e=
njoyed complete rest=20

after the fatigue of our long journey. Countless birds were chirping and si=
nging in the trees above=20

us; innumerable ring-doves were cooing in the shady palms; and the proporti=
onately as his health=20

improved. He sometimes thought that he should like to make an effort and ge=
t about a little in the=20

world, but he was very weak, and without any of the resources to which he h=
ad been accustomed=20

throughout life. He had no servants of his own, no carriages, no man of bus=
iness, no banker; and=20

when at last he tried to bring himself to write to Mr. Putney Giles=E2=80=
=94a painful task=E2=80=94Monsignore=20

Catesby offered to undertake his whole correspondence for him, and announce=
d that his medical=20

attendants had declared that he must under no circumstances whatever attemp=
t at present to write=20

a letter. Hitherto he had been without money, which was lavishly supplied f=
or his physicians and=20

other wants; and he would have been without clothes if=20


_
sudden change from the dead sterility of the desert to the scene of verdure=
 and of life, produced=20

an extraordinary effect upon the spirits. What caused this curious transiti=
on? Why should this=20

charming oasis, teeming with vegetation and with life, be found in the yell=
ow, sandy desert? . . .=20

Water had worked this change; the spirit of the Nile, more potent than any =
genii of the Arabian=20

fables, had transformed the desert into a fruitful garden. Halleem Effendi,=
 the former Governor,=20

had, many years ago, planted this garden, irrigated by numerous water-wheel=
s; and we now=20

enjoyed the fruits, and thanked Heaven for its greatest blessings in that b=
urning land, shade and=20

cool water.  The tents were soon arranged, the camels were paid for and dis=
charged, and in the=20

cool of the evening we were visited by the Governor and suite.  The firman =
having been officially=20

presented by the dragoman upon our arrival in the morning, the Governor had=
 called with much=20

civility to inquire into our projects and to offer assistance. We were shor=
tly seated on carpets=20

outside the tent, and after pipes and coffee, and the usual preliminary com=
pliments, my dragoman=20

explained, that the main object of our journey was to search for the source=
s of the Nile, or, as he=20

described it, "the head of the river."  Both the Governor and Halleem Effen=
di, with many officers=20

who had accompanied them, were Turks; but, in spite of the gravity and soli=
dity for which the Turk=20

is renowned, their faces relaxed into a variety of expressions at this (to =
them) absurd=20

announcement. "The head of the Nile!" they exclaimed, "impossible!" "Do the=
y know where it is?"=20

inquired the Governor, of the dragoman; and upon an explanation being given=
, that, as we did not=20

know where it was, we had proposed to discover it, the Turks merely shook t=
heir heads, sipped=20

their coffee, and took extra whiffs at their long pipes, until at length th=
e white- haired old Halleem=20

Effendi spoke. He gave good and parental advice, as follows:--  "Don't go u=
pon so absurd an=20

errand; nobody knows anything about the Nile, neither will any one discover=
 its source. We do not=20

even know the source of the Atbara; how should we know the source of the gr=
eat Nile. A great=20

portion of the Atbara flows through the Pasha of Egypt's dominions; the fir=
man in your possession=20

with his signature, will insure you respect, so long as you remain within h=
is territory; but if you=20

cross his frontier, you will be in the hands of savages. The White Nile is =
the country of the=20

negroes; wild, ferocious races who have neither knowledge of God nor respec=
t for the Pasha, and=20

you must travel with a powerful armed force; the climate is deadly; how cou=
ld you penetrate such=20

a region to search for what is useless even should you attain it? But how w=
ould it be possible for a=20

lady, young and delicate, to endure what would kill the strongest man? Trav=
el along the Atbara=20

river into the Taka country, there is much to be seen that is unexplored; b=
ut give up the mad=20

scheme of the Nile source."  There was some sense in old Halleem Effendi's =
advice; it was the=20

cool and cautious wisdom of old age, but as I was not so elderly, I took it=
 "cum grano salis." He=20

was a charming old gentleman, the perfect beau ideal of the true old style =
of Turk, but few=20

specimens of which remain; all that he had said was spoken in sincerity, an=
d I resolved to collect=20

as much information as possible from the grey-headed authorities before I s=
hould commence the=20

expedition. I was deeply impressed with one fact, that until I could dispen=
se with an interpreter it=20

would be impossible to succeed, therefore I determined to learn Arabic as s=
peedily as possible.  A=20

week's rest in the garden of Halleem Effendi prepared us for the journey. I=
 resolved to explore the=20

Atbara river and the Abyssinian affluents, prior to commencing the White Ni=
le voyage. The=20

Governor promised me two Turkish soldiers as attendants, and I arranged to =
send my heavy=20

baggage by boat to Khartoum, and secure the advantage of travelling light; =
a comfort that no one=20



can appreciate who has not felt the daily delay in loading a long string of=
 camels. Both my wife and=20

I had suffered from a short attack of fever brought on by the prostrating e=
ffect of most fashionable=20

tailor in Rome, a German, had not been in frequent attendance on him under =
the direction of=20

Monsignore Catesby, who, in fact, had organized his wardrobe as he did ever=
y thing else.=20

Somehow or other Lothair never seemed alone. When he woke in the morning th=
e monsignore=20

was frequently kneeling before an oratory in his room, and if by any chance=
 Lothair was wanting at=20

Lady St. Jerome=E2=80=99s reception, Father Coleman, who was now on a visit=
 to the family, would look in=20

and pass the evening with him, as men who keep a gaming-table find it discr=
eet occasionally to=20

change the dealer. It is a huge and even stupendous pile=E2=80=94that Palaz=
zo Agostini, and yet Lothair=20

never tried to thread his way through its vestibules and galleries, or atte=
mpt a reconnaissance of=20

its endless chambers, without some monsignore or other gliding up quite pro=
pos and relieving him=20

from the dulness of solitary existence during the rest of his promenade.  L=
othair was relieved by=20

hearing that his former guardian, Cardinal Grandison, was daily expected at=
 Rome; and he=20

revolved in his mind whether he should not speak to his eminence generally =
on the system of his=20

life, which he felt now required some modification. In the interval, howeve=
r, no change did occur.=20

Lothair attended every day the services of the church, and every evening th=
e receptions of Lady=20

St. Jerome; and between the discharge of these two duties he took a drive w=
ith a=20

priest=E2=80=94sometimes with more than one, but always most agreeable men=
=E2=80=94generally in the environs=20

of the city, or visited a convent, or a villa, some beautiful gardens, or a=
 gallery of works of art.  It=20

was at Lady St. Jerome=E2=80=99s that Lothair met his former guardian. The =
cardinal had only arrived in the=20

morning. His manner to Lothair was affectionate. He retained Lothair=E2=80=
=99s hand and pressed it with=20

his pale, thin fingers; his attenuated countenance blazed for a moment with=
 a divine light.  =E2=80=9CI have=20

long wished to see you, sir,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand much wish =
to talk with you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI can hear nothing=20

from you nor of you but what must be most pleasing to me,=E2=80=9D said the=
 cardinal.  =E2=80=9CI wish I could=20

believe that,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  The cardinal caressed him; put his ar=
m round Lothair=E2=80=99s neck and said,=20

=E2=80=9CThere is no time like the present. Let us walk together in this ga=
llery,=E2=80=9D and they withdrew naturally=20

from the immediate scene.  =E2=80=9CYou know all that has happened, I dare =
say,=E2=80=9D said Lothair with=20

embarrassment and with a sigh, =E2=80=9Csince we parted in England, sir.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CIt has=20

been a most striking and merciful dispensation.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen I n=
eed not dwell upon it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand=20

naturally it would be most painful. What I wish particularly to speak to yo=
u about is my position=20

under this roof. What I owe to those who dwell under it no language can des=
cribe, and no efforts=20

on my part, and they shall be unceasing, can repay. But I think the time ha=
s come when I ought no=20

longer to trespass on their affectionate devotion, though, when I allude to=
 the topic, they seem to=20

misinterpret the motives which influence me, and to be pained rather than r=
elieved by my=20

suggestions. I cannot bear being looked upon as ungrateful, when in fact I =
am devoted to them. I=20

think, sir, you might help me in putting all this right.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CIf it be necessary,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal; =E2=80=9Cbut I=20

apprehend you misconceive them. When I last left Rome you were very ill, bu=
t Lady St. Jerome=20

and others have written to me almost daily about you, during my absence, so=
 that I am familiar=20

with all that has occurred, and quite cognizant of their feelings. Rest ass=
ured that, toward yourself,=20

they are exactly what they ought to be and what you would desire.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CWell, I am glad,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=20

=E2=80=9Cthat you are acquainted with every thing that has happened, for yo=
u can put them right if it be=20

necessary; but I sometimes cannot help fancying that they are under some fa=
lse impression both=20



as to my conduct and my convictions.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot in the slightes=
t,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, =E2=80=9Ctrust me, my dear=20

friend, for that. They know everything and appreciate everything; and, grea=
t as, no doubt, have=20

been your sufferings, feel that every thing has been ordained for the best;=
 that the hand of the=20

Almighty has been visible throughout all=20


_
simoom, which at this season (June) was at its height. The Nile was slowly =
rising, although it was=20

still low; occasionally it fell about eighteen inches in one night, but aga=
in rose; this proved that,=20

although the rains had commenced, they were not constant, as the steady and=
 rapid increase of=20

the river had not taken place. The authorities assured me that the Blue Nil=
e was now rising at=20

Khartoum, which accounted for the increase of the river at Berber.  The gar=
den of Halleem Effendi=20

was attended by a number of fine powerful slaves from the White Nile, whose=
 stout frames and=20

glossy skins were undeniable witnesses of their master's care. A charmingly=
 pretty slave girl paid=20

us daily visits, with presents of fruit from her kind master and numerous m=
istresses, who, with the=20

usual Turkish compliments as a preliminary message, requested permission to=
 visit the English=20

lady.  In the cool hour of evening a bevy of ladies approached through the =
dark groves of citron=20

trees, so gaily dressed in silks of the brightest dyes of yellow, blue, and=
 scarlet, that no bouquet of=20

flowers could have been more gaudy. They were attended by numerous slaves, =
and the head=20

servant politely requested me to withdraw during the interview. Thus turned=
 out of my tent, I was=20

compelled to patience and solitude beneath a neighbouring date palm.  The r=
esult of the interview=20

with my wife was most satisfactory; the usual womanish questions had been r=
eplied to, and hosts=20

of compliments exchanged. We were then rich in all kinds of European trifle=
s that excited their=20

curiosity, and a few little presents established so great an amount of conf=
idence that they gave the=20

individual history of each member of the family from childhood, that would =
have filled a column of=20

the Times with births, deaths, and marriages.  Some of these ladies were ve=
ry young and pretty,=20

and of course exercised a certain influence over their husbands; thus, on t=
he following morning,=20

we were inundated with visitors, as the male members of the family came to =
thank us for the=20

manner in which their ladies had been received; and fruit, flowers, and the=
 general produce of the=20

garden were more clearly built upon a rock than at this moment; that this g=
reat manifestation will=20

revive, and even restore, the faith of Christendom; and that you yourself m=
ust be looked upon as=20

one of the most favored of men.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEverybody says that,=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair, rather peevishly.  =E2=80=9CAnd=20

everybody feels it,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal.  =E2=80=9CWell, to revert t=
o lesser points,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9CI do not say I=20

want to return to England, for I dread returning to England, and do not kno=
w whether I shall ever=20

go back there; and at any rate I doubt not my health at present is unequal =
to the effort; but I should=20

like some change in my mode of life. I will not say it is too much controll=
ed, for nothing seems ever=20

done without first consulting me; but, somehow or other, we are always in t=
he same groove. I wish=20

to see more of the world; I wish to see Rome, and the people of Rome. I wis=
h to see and do many=20

things which, if I mention, it would seem to hurt the feelings of others, a=
nd my own are=20

misconceived, but, if mentioned by you, all would probably be different.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI understand you, my=20

dear young friend, my child, I will still say,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =
=E2=80=9CNothing can be more reasonable=20

than what you suggest. No doubt our friends may be a little too anxious abo=
ut you, but they are=20

the best people in the world. You appear to me to be quite well enough now =
to make more=20

exertion than hitherto they have thought you capable of. They see you every=
 day, and cannot=20

judge so well of you as I who have been absent. I will charge myself to eff=
ect all your wishes. And=20

we will begin by my taking you out to-morrow and your driving with me about=
 the city. I will show=20

you Rome and the Roman people.=E2=80=9D  Accordingly, on the morrow, Cardin=
al Grandison and his late=20

pupil visited together Rome and the Romans. And first of all Lothair was pr=
esented to the cardinal-

prefect of the Propaganda, who presides over the ecclesiastical affairs of =
every country in which=20



the Roman Church has a mission, and that includes every land between the Ar=
ctic and the=20

Southern Pole. This glimpse of the organized correspondence with both the A=
mericas, all Asia, all=20

Africa, all Australia, and many=20


_
However pleasant, there were drawbacks to our garden of Eden; there was dus=
t in our Paradise;=20

not the dust that we see in Europe upon unwatered roads, that simply fills =
the eyes, but sudden=20

clouds raised by whirlwinds in the desert which fairly choked the ears and =
nostrils when thus=20

attacked. June is the countries, carried on by a countless staff of clerks =
in one of the most=20

capacious buildings in the world, was calculated to impress the visitor wit=
h a due idea of the=20

extensive authority of the Roman Pontiff. This institution, greater, accord=
ing to the cardinal, than=20

any which existed in ancient Rome, was to=20
