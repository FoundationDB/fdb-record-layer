philodendron monstera must be coming for Number 13. They were together, perhaps. What if, in spite of all, Ivor should tell Di how he loved her, and they should be engaged? At that thought, I tried to bring on a heart attack, and die; for at least it would chill their happiness if, philodendron monstera must be coming for Number 13. They were together, perhaps.

the machine shop, whence came the throbbing of a gasolene engine--the same sound they had 

heard when on their second visit to the camp.  Jack asked Will's uncle if on any occasion he and 

Stephen had not landed near the camp, for Jack had in mind the occasion when the meat was 

stolen from the tree by the bear.  "Oh, was that your meat?" asked Mr. Swaim with a laugh, when 

Jack had explained. "We always wondered whom we had robbed. Stephen and I were out for a 

flight that night, and we had to descend because of an accident to the motor. We came down near 

the tree where the meat was, and surprised a bear at work getting it. Bruin scrambled down and 

ran away, and we concluded to take some of the meat, as we were short. Then we started the 

machine off again, and came here. I hope we didn't put you to any inconvenience."  "Oh, no," 

replied Jack. "It only puzzled us some, that was all. But have you an arrow in hobnails, on the 

soles of your boots?"  Mr. Swaim lifted his foot and showed the arrow.  "That explains  "I would 

rather rest here for awhile, since you think Lord Mountstuart is sure not to come," said I. "These 

pillows are so comfortable. Then perhaps, by and by, I shall feel able to go back to the den, and 

watch the dancing. I should like to keep up, if I can, for I know I shan't sleep, and the night will 

seem so long."  "Very well," said Di, speaking kindly, though I knew she would have liked to shake 

me. "I'm afraid I shall have to run away now, for my partner will think me so rude. What about 

supper?"  "Oh, I don't want any. And I shall have gone upstairs before that," I interrupted. "Go 

now, I don't need you any more."  "Ring, and send for me if you feel badly again."  "Yes--yes."  By 

this time she was at the door, and there she turned with a remorseful look in her eyes, as if she 

had been unkind and was sorry. "Even if you don't send, I shall come back by and by, when I can, 

to see how you are," she said. Then she was gone, and I nestled deeper into the sofa cushions, 

with the feeling that my head

CONCLUSION.   "Well," remarked Mr. Swaim, when the aeroplane had been put back in the shed, 

"I'd like to have you boys come to dinner with me. We don't have anything very elaborate in camp-

---"  "We don't care for elaborate things," interrupted Jack. "We're camping on our own hook, and I 

was just thinking we had better begin to think of going back, or Budge and Long Gun may get the 

pillows like a stone.  "She was afraid of missing Number 13 with Ivor," I said to myself. "Well--she's 

welcome to it now. I don't think she'll enjoy it much--or let him. Oh, I hope they'll quarrel. I don't 

think I'd mind anything, if only I was sure they'd never be nearer to each other. I wish Di would 

marry Lord Robert. Perhaps then Ivor would turn to me. Oh, my God, how I hate her--and all 

beautiful girls, who spoil the lives of women like me."  A
