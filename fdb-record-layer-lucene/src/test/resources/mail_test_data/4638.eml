CHAPTER I  THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM--WHAT IT REALLY IS   THE Federal Rese=
rve=20

System is the visible hand of the Invisible Empire picking the pockets of t=
he producers of real=20

wealth. It is the most leviathan parasite engrafted upon--and grafting on--=
production in the world's=20

history. It is an industrial vampire sucking industry's life blood down its=
 bottomless maw. Its greed=20

is fathomless, its rule is ruthless and its lust for power is insatiate.  I=
t is openly and avowedly run=20

and managed in the interest of a so-called "superior class." It has a cynic=
al contempt for the=20

public--whom it ruthlessly plunders. It believes--and practices the belief-=
-that it was instituted for=20

the promotion and protection of superior privileges; that wealth is produce=
d for its exploitation; that=20

production of values exists for its parasitical plunder; that Shylockery is=
 a virtue and that the fruits=20

of industry belong not to its producers but to its despoilers.  Property-ow=
ners, property-earners=20

and property-producers are but its puppets whom it plunders at will. By mon=
opolizing and juggling=20

money--the mere symbol of wealth--it destroys the value of real wealth. It =
has but one interest in=20

the public whom it hypocritically professes to serve and that interest is e=
xpressed in the query=20

"How much will the people stand?"  There is nothing with which to compare i=
t for it stands alone in=20

the world's history as the most gigantic plunderbund ever conceived in pred=
acity's womb.=20

Czardom at its height and Kaiserdom at its zenith never held a tithe of the=
 real power held by the=20

Federal Reserve System. It is the perfected fruit and flower of financial h=
igh-bindery, industrial=20

plunderbund and applied Shylockery. Under the cloak and mantle of the law i=
t reaches forth=20

remained renewed their defiances. Toward morning, favored by a thick fog, t=
hey broke through=20

and escaped. Many of the surviving Pequots put themselves under the protect=
ion of Canonicus=20

and other Narraganset chiefs. Sassacus, the head sachem, fled to the Mohawk=
s; but they were=20

instigated by their allies, the Narragansets, to put him to death. His scal=
p was sent to Boston, and=20

many heads and hands of Pequot warriors were also brought in by the neighbo=
ring tribes. The=20

adult male prisoners who remained in the hands of the colonists were sent t=
o the West Indies to=20

be sold into slavery; the women and children experienced a similar fate at =
home. It was reckoned=20

that between eight and nine hundred of the Pequots had been killed or taken=
. Such of the=20

survivors as had escaped, forbidden any longer to call themselves Pequots, =
were distributed=20

between the Narragansets and Mohegans, and subjected to an annual tribute. =
A like tribute was=20

imposed, also, on the inhabitants of Block Island. The colonists regarded t=
heir success as ample=20

proof of Divine approbation, and justified all they had done to these =E2=
=80=9Cbloody heathen=E2=80=9D by abundant=20

quotations from the Old Testament. Having referred to =E2=80=9Cthe wars of =
David,=E2=80=9D Underhill adds, =E2=80=9CWe=20

had sufficient light from the word of God for our proceedings=E2=80=9D; and=
 Mason, after some exulting=20

quotations from the Psalms, concludes: =E2=80=9CThus the Lord was pleased t=
o smite our enemies in the=20

hinder parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance!=E2=80=9D The In=
dian allies admired the courage of=20



the colonists, but they thought their method of war =E2=80=9Ctoo furious, a=
nd to slay too many.=E2=80=9D=20

SYNOPSIS OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS, CHIEFLY MILITARY, BETWEEN THE CONQUEST=20

OF THE PEQUOTS, 1637, AND THE DEFEAT OF KING PHILIP, 1676  1638. Settlement=
 of=20

Rhode Island. Establishment of the Colony of New Haven. Swedes and Finns se=
ttle in Delaware.=20

1639. Adoption of the Connecticut Constitution.  1642. War between Charles =
I. and Parliament.=20

Indecisive Battle of Edgehill.  1643. The Colonies of New England form a co=
nfederacy.  1644.=20

Battle of Marston Moor, in which the English Royalists are defeated. Roger =
Williams obtains a=20

patent from Parliament for the United Government of the Rhode Island Settle=
ments.  1645. Defeat=20

of the English Royalists at the Battle of Naseby.  1649. Execution of Charl=
es I.  1653. Cromwell is=20

f New Netherlands,=20

dispossesses the Swedish settlers at the mouth of the Delaware.  1660. Rest=
oration of the Stuarts=20

in England.=20


_
filcheries which are simply stupendous.  That is briefly what the much tout=
ed and saccharinely=20

adulated Federal Reserve System really is. Abraham Lincoln, the greatest hu=
man intellect which=20

ever functioned on this planet, prophetically drew its portrait in these wo=
rds: "It (the Civil War) has=20

been indeed a trying hour for the Republic; but I see in the near future a =
crisis approaching that=20

unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a res=
ult of the war,=20

corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places wi=
ll follow and the=20

money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working up=
on the prejudices of=20

the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic =
is destroyed. I feel at=20

this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before even=
 in the midst of the=20

war. God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless."  That is the true =
portrait, drawn by a=20

master hand, of the Federal Reserve System.  In subsequent chapters you wil=
l see the birth of the=20

monster, its ruthless methods of plunder, its machinery of despoilment, its=
 monopoly of 1662. The=20

Connecticut and New Haven Colonies receive a charter from Charles II.  1664=
. Charles II. grants=20

the region between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers to his brother James=
, Duke of York. The=20

English occupy New Amsterdam and take possession of the province of New Net=
herland. The=20

Colony of New Jersey is established.  1665. The union of the Connecticut an=
d New Haven=20

Colonies is completed.  1668. Father Marquette founds the Mission of Sault =
Ste. Marie.  1670.=20

Incorporation of the Hudson Bay Company.  1673. The Dutch occupy New York a=
nd New Jersey.=20

1674. New York and New Jersey are restored to the English.  1675. King Phil=
ip=E2=80=99s War.     IV  THE=20

DEFEAT OF KING PHILIP, 1676   Except in the destruction of the Pequots, the=
 native tribes of=20

New England had, in 1673, undergone no very material diminution. The Pocano=
kets, or=20

Wampanoags, though somewhat curtailed in their limits, still occupied the e=
astern shore of=20

Narragansett Bay. The Narragansets still possessed the western shore. There=
 were several=20

scattered tribes in various parts of Connecticut; though, with the exceptio=
n of some small=20

reservations, they had already ceded all=20


_
of pillage.  And in looking it over don't overlook the fact that you, you y=
ourself--whatever may be=20

your part in American industry--are laying tribute on the Federal Reserve a=
ltar of Mammon. You=20

can't escape its net of pillage. Amid its mounds of gold, currency and secu=
rities--the hugest ever=20

massed together on this planet--your contribution is the Mohegan chief, was=
 now an old man. The=20

Pawtucket, or Penacook, confederacy continued to occupy the falls of the Me=
rrimac and the heads=20

of the Piscataqua. Their old sachem, Passaconaway, regarded the colonists w=
ith awe and=20

veneration. In the interior of Massachusetts and along the Connecticut were=
 several other less=20

noted tribes. The Indians of=20
