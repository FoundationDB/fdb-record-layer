rly retreat. "It's all=20

Italians _may_ look dignified, but we can't stalk about as if we were perpe=
tually carrying water-

pots on our heads."  "American girls have more energy than that. I'm just r=
eady to fly to bits,"=20

declared Delia, prancing down the passage like a playful kitten.  "I give e=
verybody five minutes to=20

get on their costumes," decreed Jess. "Peachy must stay outside in the pass=
age and wait. I'll=20

tinkle my Swiss goat-bell when you're all to come in."  Peachy, pulling a l=
ong face of protest, took=20

her stand obediently in the corridor, while her three roommates entered dor=
mitory 13. Their fancy=20

dresses were lying ready on their beds, and they whisked into them with the=
 utmost haste.=20

"There! Is my cap on straight? Jess, you look fine! I guess we shan't keep =
the crowd waiting. We'd=20

earn a valley, form but a little furrow in the midst of a vast level. The t=
wo basins, placed at the=20

extremities of South America, are savannahs or steppes, pasturage without t=
rees; the intermediate=20

basin, which receives the equatorial rains during the whole year, is almost=
 entirely one vast forest,=20

through which no other roads are known save the rivers. The strong vegetati=
on which conceals the=20

soil, renders also the uniformity of its level less perceptible; and the pl=
ains of Caracas and La Plata=20

bear no other name. The three basins we have just described are called, in =
the language of the=20

colonists, the Llanos of Varinas and of Caracas, the bosques or selvas (for=
ests) of the Amazon,=20

and the Pampas of Buenos Ayres. The trees not only for the most part cover =
the plains of the=20

Amazon, from the Cordillera de Chiquitos, as far as that of Parime; they al=
so crown these two=20

had laid everything in preparation for their feast, and, to protect their d=
