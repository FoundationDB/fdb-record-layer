  "I know nothing about it," said Priam doggedly.  "I suppose you'll not de=
ny, sir, that your name is Henry Leek," said Henry, jumping up to stand by =
Matthew.  "I deny everything," said Priam doggedly. How could he explain? I=
f he had not been able to convince Alice that he was _
above them.  "Come on, boys! I can see a streak of light. It's like climbin=
g up an old chimney.=20

Quib's almost on him."  All that time, while they were groping through that=
 cave, Julius Davis was=20

looking around the pasture-lot after them.  He would have been glad of a sm=
all glimpse of Quib,=20

but all he had found as yet was Mr. Hamburger, who was standing under an ol=
d butternut-tree and=20

looking down at a round, hollow place in the ground.  He was smoking very h=
ard.  "Hab you seen=20

my dog?" asked Julius.  "Hold shtill, poy! Joost you vait. Hi! Dere goes do=
se vootshuck!"  "Dat's=20

so. He's coming right up out ob de hole, and dar ain't no dog to foller him=
!"  Away went the=20

woodchuck, and Julius gave him up for lost; but Mr. Hamburger smoked harder=
 than ever and=20

looked down at the hole.  "Hark! Hear dem? It is de tog. Pless mein eyes, i=
f dey didn't chase dose=20

vootshuck right oonder mein pasture-lot!"  Julius could hear Quib bark now,=
 away down there in=20

the ground, and he could not stand still on any one side of that hollow. So=
 he danced up and down=20

on every side of it.  One minute,--two, three minutes,--it was a dreadfully=
 long time, --and then it=20

was the voice of Abe Selover mixed with a long yelp from Quib.  "Come on, b=
oys! I've shoved him=20

through. I'm going right up after him. Nothing to pull away but some sods."=
  "Dat's de tog!"=20

exclaimed Mr. Hamburger. "Keep shtill, black poy! De rest of dose vootshuck=
s is coming. Keep=20

shtill."  Nothing but some sods to pull away, to make that hole large enoug=
h, and then Abe=20

Selover's curly head popped out, and the rest of him followed, grimy and di=
rty, but in a great fever=20

of excitement and fun.  After him climbed the other boys, one by one.  "Mr.=
 Hamburger, did you=20

see where that woodchuck went to?"  "De vootshuck? I don't know him. But de=
 black poy haf run=20

after de tog, ant he vas run so fast as nefer you saw. Vare you leetle voot=
shucks coom from, eh?=20

You climb oonder mein pasture?"  "No use, Abe," said Mart Penniman. "We've =
missed that=20

woodchuck this time."  "We've found the cave, though," said Pete Corry. "It=
's through that he got=20

away from us so many times."  "I dell you vat," said Mr. Hamburger; "de nex=
' time you leetle=20

vootshucks vant to chase dat oder vootshuck, you put a pag ofer dese hole. =
Den you shace him=20

round among de rocks, and you will catch de tog ant de vootshuck into de sa=
me pag."  "That's=20

what we'll do," said Abe Selover. "But not to-day, boys. He was the finest =
woodchuck I ever saw,=20

but we've missed him this time."    THE FAITHFUL LITTLE LIZARD  By Lieutena=
nt-Colonel W. Hill=20

James    On the diggings near the Avoca River the lizard's future master ha=
d, as was the digger's=20

custom, come out of his hole, or shaft, at eleven o'clock for a short half-=
hour's rest between=20

breakfast and the midday meal. He threw himself down in a half-sitting post=
ure, and was dreamily=20

smoking his pipe when from beneath a neighboring rock, popped out a little =
lizard who eyed the=20

stranger with inquisitive interest, as quickly retiring, to return again in=
 a few minutes.  This was=20

repeated several times, the lizard's keen eyes always fixed on bigamist did=
 not throw her into a=20

swoon. She at once, in her own mind, began to make excuses for him. She sai=
d to herself, as she=20

inspected the real Mrs. Henry Leek, that the real Mrs. Henry Leek had certa=
inly the temperament=20

which manufactures bigamists. She understood how a person may slide into bi=
gamy. And after=20

thirty years!... She never thought of bigamy as a crime, nor did it occur t=
o her to run out and drown=20

herself for shame because she was not properly married to Priam!  No, it ha=
s to be said in favour=20

of Alice that she invariably took things as they were.  "I think you'd bett=
er all come in and sit down=20

quietly," she said.  "Eh! It's very kind of you," said the mother of the cu=
rates, limply.  The last thing=20

that the curates wanted to do was to sit down quietly. But they had to sit =
down. Alice made them=20

sit side by side on the sofa. The heavy, elder brother, who had not spoken =
a word, sat on a chair=20



between the sideboard and the door. Their mother sat on a chair near the ta=
ble. Priam fell into his=20

easy-chair between the fireplace and the sideboard. As for Alice, she remai=
ned standing; she=20

showed no nervousness except in her handling of the toasting-fork.  It was =
a great situation. But=20

unfortunately ordinary people are so unaccustomed to the great situation, t=
hat, when it chances to=20

come, they feel themselves incapable of living up to it. A person gazing in=
 at the window, and=20

unacquainted with the facts, might have guessed that the affair was simply =
a tea party at which the=20

guests had arrived a little too soon and where no one was startlingly profi=
cient in the art of small-

talk.  Still, the curates were apparently bent on doing their best.  "Now, =
mother!" one of them urged=20

her.  The mother, as if a spring had been touched in her, began: "He marrie=
d me just thirty years=20

ago, ma'am; and four months after my eldest was born--that's John there"--(=
pointing to the corner=20

near the door)--"he just walked out of the house and left me. I'm sorry to =
have to say it. Yes, sorry I=20

am! But there it is. And never a word had I ever given him! And eight month=
s after that my twins=20

were born. That's Harry and Matthew"--(pointing to the sofa)--"Harry I call=
ed after his father=20

because I thought he was like him, and just to show I bore no ill-feeling, =
and hoping he'd come=20

back! And there I was with these little children! And not a word of explana=
tion did I ever have. I=20

heard of Harry five years later--when Johnnie was nearly five--but he was o=
n the Continent and I=20

couldn't go traipsing about with three babies. Besides, if I _had_ gone!...=
 Sorry I am to say it,=20

ma'am; but many's the time he's beaten me, yes, with his hands and his fist=
s! He's knocked me=20

about above a bit. And I never gave him a word back. He was my husband, for=
 better for worse,=20

and I forgave him and I still do. Forgive and forget, that's what I say. We=
 only heard of him through=20

Matthew being second curate at St. Paul's, and in charge of the mission hal=
l. It was your milkman=20

that happened to tell Matthew that he had a customer same name as himself. =
And you know how=20

one thing leads to another. So we're here!"  "I=20


_
Presently the digger's foot was approached, and evidently approved of for i=
ts warmth. After a=20

retreat to the rock a farther advance was made, this time to the knee of th=
e stranger, to whose=20

face the two brilliant little eyes were still enquiringly directed. Before =
the half-hour's rest was over=20

the left arm of the smoker had been mounted, his neck rounded, and the righ=
t arm descended, the=20

venturesome journey ended by the lizard squatting contentedly on the back o=
f his new-found=20

friend's right hand. Confidence had thus been established between the two, =
but not to the extent of=20

capture, for on the gold-seeker attempting to place his left hand over his =
new acquaintance, he=20

scuttled away to his rock with almost absolutely certain I never married he=
r. I never married any=20

one; except, of course, you, Alice!"  "Then how do you explain this, sir?" =
exclaimed Matthew, the=20

younger twin, jumping up and taking a blue paper from his pocket. "Be so go=
od as to pass this to=20

father," he said, handing the paper to Alice.  Alice inspected the document=
. It was a certificate of=20

the marriage of Henry Leek, valet, and Sarah Featherstone, spinster, at a r=
egistry office in=20

Paddington. Priam also inspected it. This was one of Leek's escapades! No r=
evelations as to the=20

past of Henry Leek would have surprised him. There was nothing to be done e=
xcept to give a=20

truthful denial of identity and to persist in that denial. Useless to say s=
oothingly to=20
