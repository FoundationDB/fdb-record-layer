philodendron monstera derived from the English shire. No court records of this year survive. The next year 1637, New Norfolk itself was divided into Lower Norfolk and Upper Norfolk counties.  Also in 1637, Warrosquyoake County lost its Indian name, becoming Isle of Wight. By Act of Assembly passed in January 1639/40, philodendron monstera derived from the English shire. No court records of this year survive. The next year 1637, New Norfolk itself was divided into Lower Norfolk and Upper Norfolk counties.  Also in 1637, Warrosquyoake County lost its Indian name, becoming Isle of Wight. By Act of Assembly passed in January 1639/40, _
papers, often including copies of wills, were kept. The name derived from a Latin word meaning to 

fortify or strengthen, since the deeds strengthened the validity of ownership claimed by the holder 

of the land. The other function of the monthly court in Virginia different from the English Shire 

Court was the power to probate wills. In England probate of wills was in the prerogative courts of 

Canterbury and York. Probably since there was no diocesan see in Virginia, Virginia being in the 

diocese of London, the monthly court offered the most feasible place of probate.  It has been 

noted that there was a limit to the powers of this court and that cases which it could not hear went 

before the General Court. This court was composed of the Governor and his Council of State. It 

met semi-annually, 15 April and 15 October, each term lasting at least eighteen days. The 

Governor presided at these sessions. The presence of five members was necessary for the 

transaction of business. The _Minutes of the Council and General Court_ are extant for the years 

1622-1632 and abstracts for the years 1670-1676. They were published in one volume by the 

Virginia State Library in 1924 and are helpful in acquiring a general picture of life in the colony in 

the seventeenth century.  The General Assembly was also a judicial body with power to render 

decisions. At its afternoon session the 22nd day of September 1674, a cause came before the 

Council and General Court which had originated in Accomack County. The Court made no 

decision but ordered it "referred to the Assembly by reason it very much concern the country." 

From that one would infer that causes involving general principles were deemed proper for 

discussion and decision by the Burgesses who represented the entire colony, since all would be 

affected by the decision.  The Court of Admiralty, the last dispenser of justice in the colony, seems 

to have been established about 1697 under the governorship of Sir Edmund Andros. Previously 

such matters as would come within the province of this court had been handled by other judicial en 

useampia kysymyksi tekemn.  "Mitp min jousella?" mutisi hn itsekseen, sovitellen sit vakan plle 

selkns, "mutta pojan thden. Vaan onpahan muutenkin akka mies aseetonna."  Nyt hiihti hn hivutteli 

verkalleen keskelle suota taakkoineen. Siin laski hn alas vakan, lukonreik pohjoista kohti knnettyn. 

Sitte hiihti hn aluksi hiljemmin ja tuutilaulua laulaen, yhdeksn kertaa ympri mytpivn, niinkuin 

vakankehkin sampaasta kvi, ja aina listen vauhtia ja isontaen ladun kehyst. Kaikki muistamansa 

univirret veteli.  Sen tehtyn lhti hn taakseen katsomatta kiidttmn Suonper kohti. Puolimatkalla laski 

jnnitetyn jousensa vasemmalle olalleen ja ampui taakseen. Sitte lhti taaskin hyv vauhtia eteenpin. 

Ei ollutkaan hn ensi kertaa kesll suksilla kymss. Oli varta vasten tehnyt pystynokkaiset kessukset, 

jotka eivt mttisiin tarttuneet.  Hike pyyhki mies, kun tuli Suonpern pihaan. Sinne oli jo poikakin 

ehtinyt hevosen kanssa.  Is hyppsi rattaille, knsi hevosen pn kotoa kohti ja alkoi ajaa. Pojan 

kysymyksiin vakasta ja matkasuunnan muutoksesta vastasi hn:  "Ei puhuta niist ennenkuin 

kotona."  Kodissa, eukkonsa ja lastensa suureksi kummastukseksi ja mielihyviksi, is, 

Korvenkasken isnt, itse kertoikin kaikki. Siit ne tiedetnkin.  Ja siihen se silloin rutto loppui.         * 

*       *       *       *  Mutta ensi talvena kun oli niin kova pakkanen; ett vesi ilmaan heittess tuli 

rakeina alas ja nurkat paukkuivat kuin mrsrit sodan aikana, lhtivt Korvenkasken miehet suolle 

menemn, is itse ruunalla ajaen, halkoja reess, ja pojat edell suksilla.  Siell aukaisi hn, Korven 

Pekka, vakan.  Siin nkivt he nyt jtyneen lnttin lukonrein edess jotakin punaista kuin verta kuuran 

alla. Piirakat ja liha olivat kuin hyytynytt kalanlient ja samoin kuin leipkin kaikki veritpli tynn. 

Sanovat sit homeeksi jokuset. Mit hometta! Ja sanokoot, verihomeeksi kun sanovat, vertaus oli, 

kyll se nhtiin, kun miehiss katsottiin.  "Kuollut on oikein", sanoi is, "mutta lujalle on ottanut, paljo on

were later. The instances of piracy were not numerous enough to justify the maintenance of a 

Court of Admiralty in Virginia. No records of this court survive.  It may seem we have wandered far 

from the formation of counties, but since the accessibility of justice for all was a prime 

consideration in their creation, it would appear well to examine the means by which the average 

citizen could have his grievances heard and decided. The importance of the county monthly court 

in his life cannot be overestimated. While on business at court, he had opportunity to see his 

friends, play cards, gamble, race horses, fight, drink, "swap" horses and other livestock, attend the 

muster of county militia to which he belonged, and see the newest articles imported from England. 

The county court and his parish church services were his  Hn sulki taaskin vakan.  Nyt tekivt he 

kelpo nuotion suolle, laskivat sen keskelle vakan ja sytyttivt rovion tuleen. Kun tuli oli sammunut, 

kokosivat he lapiolla tuhan skkiin ja mttsivt sen rekeen, ajoivat sitte semmoiselle joelle, joka 

pohjoisiin pin juoksee, tuurasivat jhn avannon ja pudistivat tuhan sinne. Vielp kirveell hakkasivat 

skinkin pieneksi ja heittivt rievut perss.  Eik sen koommin ole punaista lintua nhty, eik semmoista 

ruttoa ollut. Mutta puheentapana vielkin sanotaan: "punainen kuin rutto".  Mies se oli Korven
