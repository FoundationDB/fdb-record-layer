markable Electrical=20

Discovery.   The London Times of recent date states that a new electrical c=
ontrivance has been=20

perfected by Mr. A. St. George, the inventor of the telephone which bears h=
is name. This=20

invention, which is really supplemental to the telephone, will enable every=
 description of=20

conversation carried on through the instrument to be not only recorded but =
reproduced at any=20

future time. Briefly stated, Mr. St. George's invention may be thus describ=
ed: A circular plate of=20

glass is coated with collodion and made sensitive as a photographic plate. =
This is placed in a dark=20

box, in which is a slit to admit a ray of light. In front of the glass is a=
 telephone diaphragm, which,=20

by its vibrations, opens and closes a small shutter through which a beam of=
 light is constantly=20

passing and imprinting a dark line on the glass. Vibrations of the shutter =
cause the dark line to=20

vary in thickness according to the tones of the voice. The glass plate is r=
evolved by clock work,=20

and the conversation as it leaves the telephone is recorded on the sensitiv=
e plate, the imprinted=20

words spoken being fixed as is done in photography. The plate can be brough=
t forward afterwards,=20

and when replaced in the machine and connected with a distant telephone, wi=
ll, when set in=20

motion, give back the original conversation.         *       *       *     =
  *       *  On October 15, 1881, a=20

gentleman in Newburgh, N. Y., inclosed a spider in a small paper box. He ca=
refully guarded and=20

watched it, and affirms that for 204 days it partook of no food or water. I=
t showed no emaciation,=20

and appeared as active and strong as at first until within a very few days =
of its death on May 7,=20

1882. Tamerlane learned patience from a spider; perhaps Tanner was taught b=
y them how to fast.=20

The Hour, from which we take this item, also has the following: Another spi=
der story is sent from=20

California by the Rev. Dr. McCook, of honey-ant fame. He found a small coco=
on of eggs and=20

young spiders, which had no less than five other kinds of insects living in=
 and about it. These=20

intruders consisted of small red ants, a diminutive beetle, and a series fo=
rmed by a minute chalcid,=20

parasitic on a larger chalcid, which was parasitic on an ichneumon, which w=
as parasitic on the=20

spider. All were seeking to devour the eggs and spiderlings, yet the whole =
cocoonful, victims=20

included, seemed to be living on most amicable terms.         *       *    =
   *       *       *  Various=20

methods for hastening the conversion of cider into vinegar have been recomm=
ended. A French=20

method is as follows: Scald three barrels or casks with hot water, rinse th=
oroughly and empty.=20

Then scald with boiling vinegar, rolling the barrels and allowing them to s=
tand on their sides two or=20

three days until they become thoroughly saturated with the vinegar. The bar=
rels are then filled=20

about one-third full with strong pure cider vinegar and two gallons of cide=
r added. Every eighth day=20

thereafter two gallons of cider are added until the barrels are two-thirds =
full. The whole is allowed=20

to stand fourteen days longer, when it will be found to be good vinegar, an=
d one-half of it may be=20

drawn and the process of filling with cider be begun again. In summer the b=
arrels are allowed to=20

stand exposed to the sun and in cold weather kept where the temperature is =
80 degrees.         *=20



*       *       *       *  A Party of the United States Geological Survey h=
ave found it practicable to ride=20

to the highest peak of Mount Shasta, and suggest the establishment there of=
 a third elevated=20

station for weather observations, similar to those on Pike's Peak and Mount=
 Washington.         *=20

*       *       *       *  A herring produces from 30,000 to 50,000 eggs, a=
nd the eggs are so small in=20

size that 20,000 can be put when subjected to the action of solvents, cause=
s a movement in=20

caloric as well as in the electric fluid, and that the phenomena of Galvani=
sm, the unlimited=20

evolution of heat by friction, the extrication of gaseous matter without th=
e production of cold, might=20

all be explained by supposing a combination between the fluids of heat and =
electricity. We find=20

scarcely any two kinds of ponderable matter which do not exercise more or l=
ess affinity towards=20

each other. Moreover, imponderable particles are supposed highly attractive=
 of ponderable ones.=20

Why then should we not infer the existence of similar affinities between im=
ponderable particles=20

reciprocally? That a peculiar combination between heat and light exists in =
the solar beams, is=20

evident from their not imparting warmth to a lens through which they may pa=
ss, as do those of our=20

culinary fires.  Under this view of the case, the action of the poles in Ga=
lvanic decomposition is=20

one of complex affinity. The particles of compounds are attracted to the di=
fferent wires agreeably=20

to their susceptibilities to the positive and negative attraction, and the =
caloric leaving the electric=20

fluid with which it had been combined, unites with them at the moment that =
their electric state is=20

neutralized.  As an exciting fluid, I have usually employed a solution of o=
ne part sulphuric acid, and=20

two parts muriate of soda with seventy of water; but, to my surprise, I hav=
e produced nearly a=20

white heat by an alkaline solution barely sensible to the taste.  For the d=
isplay of the heat effects,=20

the addition of manganese, red lead, or the nitrates, is advantageous.  The=
 rationale is obvious.=20

The oxygen of these substances prevents the liberation of the gaseous hydro=
gen, which would=20

carry off the caloric. Adding to diluted muriatic acid, while acting on zin=
c, enough red lead to=20

prevent effervescence, the temperature rose from 70 to 110 Fahrenheit.  The=
 power of the=20

calorimotor is much increased by having the communication between the diffe=
rent sheets formed=20

by very large strips or masses of metal. Observing this, I rendered the she=
ets of copper shorter by=20

half an inch, for a distance of four inches of their edges, where the commu=
nication was to be made=20

between the zinc sheets; and, vice versa, the zinc was made in the same way=
 shorter than the=20

copper sheets where these were to communicate with each other. The edges of=
 the shortened=20

sheets being defended by strips of wood, tin was cast on the intermediate p=
rotruding edges of the=20

longer ones, so as to embrace a portion of each equal to about one quarter =
of an inch by four=20

inches. On one side, the tin was made to run completely across, connecting =
at the same time ten=20

copper and ten zinc sheets. On the other side there was an interstice of ab=
ove a quarter of an inch=20

left between the stratum of tin embracing the copper, and that embracing th=
e zinc plates. On each=20

of the approaching terminations of the connecting tin strata was soldered a=
 kind of forceps, formed=20

of a bent piece of sheet brass, furnished with a screw for pressing the jaw=
s together. The distance=20

between the different forceps was about two inches. The advantage of a very=
 close contact was=20

made very evident by the action of the screws; the relaxation or increase o=
f pressure on the=20

connecting wire by turning them being productive of a correspondent change =
in the intensity of=20

ignition.  It now remains to state, that by means of iron ignited in this a=
pparatus, a fixed alkali may=20

be decomposed extemporaneously.[81] If a connecting iron wire, while in com=
bustion, be touched=20

by the hydrate of potash, the evolution of potassium is demonstrated by a r=
ose-coloured flame.=20



The alkali may be applied to the wire in small pieces in a flat hook of she=
et iron. But the best mode=20

of application is by means of a tray made by doubling a slip of sheet iron =
at the ends, and leaving=20

a receptacle in the centre, in which the potash may be placed covered with =
filings. This tray being=20

substituted for the connecting wire, as soon as the immersion of the appara=
tus causes the metal to=20

burn, the rose-coloured flame appears, and if the residuum left in the shee=
t iron be afterward=20

thrown into water, an effervescence sometimes ensues.  I have ascertained t=
hat an iron heated to=20

combustion, by a blacksmith's forge fire, will cause the decomposition of t=
he hydrate of potash.=20

The dimensions of the Calorimotor may be much reduced without proportionabl=
y diminishing the=20

effect. I have one of sixty plates within a cubic foot, which burns=20
