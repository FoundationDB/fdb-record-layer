the moonlight, hitting a tree at least a rod at the lynx's right. Then the =
two went inside, enlivened the fire, and dressed as hastily as possible.  "=
Consumption is bad, ver' bad for Canadians," said Jacques, a half-hour late=
r, picking his words with care.  Ray grinned, but made no reply. London had=
 at last staggered.  Priam nodded.  "Well, well!" The doctor gave vent to h=
is feelings. The truth was that this particular hazard of life in London pl=
eased him, flattered him, made him feel important in the world, and caused =
him to forget his fatigue and his wrongs.  He saw that the puce dressing-go=
wn contained a man who was at the end of his tether, and with that good nat=

, he offered to attend to the preliminary _
of the rainbow. They certainly tempted to rest in that climate and at that =
season, but would have=20

seemed suffocating in a warmer region.  That evening Ray said:  "See here, =
Jacques, you have=20

double windows, with no way of opening them that I can find, and your firep=
lace is closed to make=20

a better draft for this stove. I'm used to fresh air at night. If I leave t=
he end door ajar, you won't be=20

afraid of burglars, will you?"  The Canadian shrugged his shoulders at this=
 exhibition of his guest's=20

eccentricity, but his hospitality was more than equal to the strain.  _"Non=
, non!"_ he replied.=20

"Nobody rob. We nevaire lock doors here," and his white teeth flashed.  Ray=
 laughed softly as he=20

thrust a billet of wood between the door and its frame. "But why do you say=
 'br-r-r!' under your=20

breath?" he asked.  "Co-old before morning, ver' cold!"  "I know, but we'll=
 be snug in bed, and=20

won't feel it. You Canadians wouldn't have so much consumption if you breat=
hed purer air when=20

you slept."  _"Oui!"_ was the polite reply; and nothing more was said.  Lon=
g before dawn Ray=20

sprang from bed, closed the door and stirred up the fire. The moon, althoug=
h low in the west, was=20

still brilliant when they made their way to where a stream trickled down to=
 Cedar Lake, and within=20

a half-hour got their first deer, a fine three-year-old buck.  They secured=
 some smaller game=20

during the morning, and in the afternoon took the deer home, and skinned an=
d dressed it. Most of=20

the carcass was hung up in the milk-room, but Jacques carried a hind quarte=
r in and suspended it=20

beside the closed fireplace, later cutting off steaks for supper and breakf=
ast.  They passed a merry=20

evening, each telling stories of his experiences, which were so different i=
n quality that they=20

possessed all the charm of novelty to the respective listeners. Again Ray s=
et the door ajar, after=20

they had undressed, and in a few moments both were asleep.  Several hours p=
assed. Had either=20

young man been awake, he might have heard soft footfalls about the door. A =
squatty, heavily built=20

animal, with huge feet, bob tail, and pointed ears adorned with tufts of ha=
ir, had traced the=20

slaughtered deer to the farmhouse by means of drops of blood, and now was s=
earching eagerly=20

for the meat.  He sought the milk-room again and again, and even sprang to =
the window-ledge, but=20

could not get inside. Then he came back and sniffed at the partly open door=
 of the living-room.=20

The human smell was there, and he hesitated. But so, too, was the odor of f=
resh venison, and his=20

mouth watered.  A round head was thrust inside the door. The moon, peering =
above the hemlocks=20

to the southeastward, cast its rays through a window directly upon the fres=
h meat.  The temptation=20

was greater than the intruder was able to withstand. Inch by inch he crowde=
d past the swaying=20

door, and silently crept toward the venison. The two men were breathing ver=
y loudly, but neither=20

stirred; and at last he gathered supreme courage, and leaped upon the meat.=
  It fell with a crash=20

against the stove, and the two were awakened simultaneously. As Jacques spr=
ang from the bed,=20

the animal backed, dragging the quarter of venison toward the door. He coll=
ided with it, knocking=20

the billet of wood outside, and the latch fell into place with a clash.  Fi=
nding himself a prisoner, the=20

creature advanced, spitting and growling, straight at Jacques, who, crying,=
 _"Loup cervier! loup=20

cervier!"_ retreated to the bed.  But the pursuit did not end there. Seeing=
 that the beast was about=20

to leap upon the bed, the Canadian hastily climbed one of the posts, not a =
second too soon, and=20

ensconced himself on the edge of the canopy top, with his back pressed agai=
nst the timbers of the=20

loft floor above.  Ray had been too much amazed to interfere at first, but =
now the time seemed ripe=20

to reopen the door and drive the lynx out. He made a rush, but the angry cr=
eature turned and=20

dashed at his legs so viciously that in a couple of seconds he, too, found =
himself perched=20

precariously on the canopy of his own bed, with "prick-ears" spitting and s=
narling on the coverlet.=20



"Can that beast climb up here, like a cat?" he asked, with no little anxiet=
y in his tones.  _"Oui,"_=20

was the reply, "he can; but immortal soul, they had been treating him as a =
breakfast-in-the-slot=20

machine: they put a breakfast in the slot, pushed a button of his waistcoat=
, and drew out=20

banknotes. For this, he had neither partner, nor assistant, nor carriage, n=
or holiday: his wife and=20

daughters could not afford him these luxuries. He was able, conscientious, =
chronically tired, bald=20

and fifty. He was also, strange as it may seem, shy; though indeed he had g=
rown used to it, as a=20

man gets used to a hollow tooth or an eel to skinning. No qualities of the =
young girl's heart about=20

the heart of Dr. Cashmore! He really did know human nature, and he never dr=
eamt of anything=20

more paradisaical than a Sunday Pullman escapade to Brighton.  Priam Farll =
opened the door=20

which divided these two hesitating men, and they saw each other by the ligh=
t of the gas lamp (for=20

the hall was in darkness).  "This Mr. Farll's?" asked Dr. Cashmore, with th=
e unintentional asperity=20

of shyness.  As for Priam, the revelation of his name by Leek shocked him a=
lmost into a sweat.=20

Surely the number of the house should have sufficed.  "Yes," he admitted, h=
alf shy and half vexed.=20

"Are you the doctor?"  "Yes."  Dr. Cashmore stepped into the obscurity of t=
he hall.  "How's the=20

invalid going on?"  "I can scarcely tell you," said Priam. "He's in bed, ve=
ry quiet."  "That's right,"=20

said the doctor. "When he came to my surgery this morning I advised him to =
go to bed."  Then=20

followed a brief awkward pause, during which Priam Farll coughed and the do=
ctor rubbed his=20

hands and hummed a fragment of melody.  "By Jove!" the thought flashed thro=
ugh the mind of=20

Farll. "This chap's shy, I do believe!"  And through the mind of the doctor=
, "Here's another of 'em,=20

all nerves!"  They both instantly, from sheer good-natured condescension th=
e one to the other,=20

became at ease. It was as if a spring had been loosed. Priam shut the door =
and shut out the ray of=20

the street lamp.  "I'm afraid there's no light here," said he.  "I'll strik=
e a match," said the doctor.=20

"Thanks very much," said Priam.  The flare of a wax vesta illumined the spl=
endours of the puce=20

dressing-gown. But Dr. Cashmore did not blench. He could flatter himself th=
at in the matter of=20

dressing-gowns he had nothing to learn.  "By the way, what's wrong with him=
, do you think?"=20

Priam Farll inquired in his most boyish voice.  "Don't know. Chill! He had =
a loud cardiac murmur.=20

Might be anything. That's why I said I'd call anyhow to-night. Couldn't com=
e any sooner. Been on=20

my feet since six o'clock this morning. You know what it is--G.P.'s day."  =
He smiled grimly in his=20

fatigue.  "It's very good of you to come," said Priam Farll with warm, viva=
cious sympathy. He had=20

an astonishing gift for imaginatively putting himself in the place of other=
 people.  "Not at all!" the=20

doctor muttered. He was quite touched. To hide the fact that he was touched=
 he struck a second=20

match. "Shall we go upstairs?"  In the bedroom a candle was burning on a du=
sty and empty=20

dressing-table. Dr. Cashmore moved it to the vicinity of the bed, which was=
 like an oasis of decent=20

arrangement in the desert of comfortless chamber; then he stooped to examin=
e the sick valet.=20

"He's shivering!" exclaimed the doctor softly.  Henry Leek's skin was indee=
d bluish, though,=20

besides blankets, there was a considerable apparatus of rugs on the bed, an=
d the night was warm.=20

His ageing face (for he was the third man of fifty in that room) had an anx=
ious look. But he made=20

no movement, uttered no word, at sight of the doctor; just stared, dully. H=
is own difficult breathing=20

alone seemed to interest him.  "Any women up?"  The doctor turned suddenly =
and fiercely on=20

Priam Farll, who started.  "There's only ourselves in the house," he replie=
d.  A person less=20

experienced than Dr. Cashmore in the secret strangenesses of genteel life i=
n London might have=20

been astonished by this information. But Dr. Cashmore no more blenched now =
than he had=20



blenched at the puce garment.  "Well, hurry up and get some hot water," sai=
d he, in a tone=20

dictatorial and savage. "Quick, now! And brandy! And more blankets! Now don=
't stand there,=20

please! Here! I'll go with you to the kitchen. Show me!" He snatched up the=
 candle, and the=20

expression of=20


_
climb mooch."  In a few moments the lynx went back to the venison, and bega=
n eating it=20

voraciously, only stopping to snarl when the young men spoke or moved. The =
fire was very low,=20

the room had been well aired, and the two were thinly clad. Before long the=
ir teeth were chattering.=20

"Eef Ah can get heem away from door, Ah'll roon an' get goon an' feex heem!=
" Jacques said, with=20

marked ill-will underlying his quaint English. He clambered about the creak=
ing canopy frame,=20

which threatened to collapse at any moment, till he reached the side wall. =
Along this were=20

suspended loops of onions. A big one hurtled through the air and hit the in=
truder in the side. He=20

whirled about and dashed for the bed.  Babette, the family cat, had been co=
ncealed beneath this=20

bed during the preceding scrimmage. She now thrust out her head just in tim=
e to be seen by the=20

lynx, and the liveliest sort of chase about the room ensued.  When hard pre=
ssed, she somehow=20

reached a shelf close beside Ray, climbed recklessly over him, her claws st=
abbing him in a dozen=20

places, and hid behind him. The lynx was thoroughly aroused, and although c=
lumsier and heavier,=20

set out sturdily to follow.  Ray's hand fell on the shelf, and clutched a f=
lat-iron, of which there were=20

a half-dozen in a row. Leaning forward, he struck the oncomer a hard blow o=
ver the head. Prick-

ears fell to the floor, and rolled, writhing, struggling and half-stunned, =
under the bed.  "Now,=20

Jacques, now!" Ray yelled. His host jumped, and was outside the door in an =
instant. Ray grasped=20

another flat-iron and waited. The sound of struggling see you're no good in=
 a crisis."  "It's all up=20

with me, doctor," came a faint whisper from the bed.  "So it is, my boy!" s=
aid the doctor under his=20

breath as he tumbled downstairs in the wake of Priam Farll. "Unless I get s=
omething hot into you!"=20

_Master and Servant_   "Will there have to be an inquest?" Priam Farll aske=
d at 6 a.m.  He had=20

collapsed in the hard chair on the ground-floor. The indispensable Henry Le=
ek was lost to him for=20

ever. He could not imagine what would happen to his existence in the future=
. He could not=20

conceive himself without Leek. And, still worse, the immediate prospect of =
unknown horrors of=20

publicity in connection with the death of Leek overwhelmed him.  "No!" said=
 the doctor, cheerfully.=20

"Oh no! I was present. Acute double pneumonia! Sometimes happens like that!=
 I can give a=20

certificate. But of course you will have to go to the registrar's and regis=
ter the death."  Even without=20

an inquest, he saw that the affair would be unthinkably distressing. He fel=
t that it would kill him,=20

and he put his hand to his face.  "Where are Mr. Farll's relatives to be fo=
und?" the doctor asked.=20

"Mr. Farll's relatives?" Priam Farll repeated without comprehending.  Then =
he understood. Dr.=20

Cashmore thought that Henry Leek's name was Farll! And all the sensitive ti=
midity in Priam Farll's=20

character seized swiftly at the mad chance of escape from any kind of publi=
c appearance as Priam=20

Farll. Why should he not let it be supposed that he, and not Henry Leek, ha=
d expired suddenly in=20

Selwood Terrace at 5 a.m. He would be free, utterly free!  "Yes," said the=
=20


_
In five minutes he heard a plaintive voice calling outside:  "Where you put=
 dem goons?"  "In the=20

milk-room."  _"Oui,_ but where? Ah'm freezing!"  "I--I don't remember."  Ja=
cques, saying many=20

things in a _patois_ he had never learned in the provincial school, went ba=
ck to the milk-room. The=20

lynx ventured to show his head, and a flat-iron dented the floor close besi=
de it. Then the animal=20

circled the room, dodged another missile, and hid in a dark corner.  Priam'=
s mind ran rapidly over=20

the catalogue of his family. He could think of no one nearer than a certain=
 Duncan Farll, a second=20

cousin.  "I don't think he had any," he replied in a voice that trembled wi=
th excitement at the=20

capricious rashness of what he was doing. "Perhaps there were distant cousi=
ns. But Mr. Farll=20

never talked of them."  Which was true.  He could scarcely articulate the w=
ords 'Mr Farll.' But when=20

they were out of his mouth he felt=20


_
Ray could hear Jacques tossing things about in the obscurity of the milk-ro=
om, but plainly finding=20

no guns, and as plainly getting colder every minute.  Something must be don=
e at once. He=20

clutched a flat-iron in each hand, screwed his courage to the sticking poin=
t, and dropped to the=20

floor.  As he flung the door wide open, he heard the rasping of the lynx's =
claws on the  The doctor=20

gazed at Priam's hands, the rough, coarsened hands of a painter who is alwa=
ys messing in oils=20

and dust.  "Pardon me," said the doctor. "I presume you are his valet--or--=
"  "Yes," said Priam=20

Farll.  That set the seal.  "What was your master's full name?" the doctor =
demanded.  And Priam=20

Farll shivered.  "Priam Farll," said he weakly.  "Not _the_--?" loudly=20
