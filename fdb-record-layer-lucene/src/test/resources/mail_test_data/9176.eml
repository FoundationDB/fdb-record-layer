has a much smaller proportion, only eighteen out of thirty-one. The third book has but one, the 

fourth two; while the fifth has fifteen, eight of which (cxxxviii.-cxlv.) occur almost at the close. The 

intention is obvious--to throw the Davidic psalms as much as possible together in the first two 

books. for conduct unwarrantable towards myself, and certainly not to be justified by any possible 

advantage which I might be supposed to derive from it. I consented to see you now, because I feel 

sure that when you know from my own lips that I wish you at once to deny the rumour you have 

been the means of

these may have formed an earlier collection, to which were afterwards added the remaining three, 

with a considerable body of alleged psalms of David, which had subsequently come to light, 

placed side by side at the end, so as to round off the whole.  Be that as it may, one thing is clear 

from the arrangement of the Psalter, namely, that the superscriptions which give the authors' 

names are at least as old as the collection itself; for they have guided the order of the collection in 

the grouping not only of Davidic psalms, but also of those attributed to the sons of Korah (xlii.-xlix.) 

and to Asaph  "May I ask," I said, with much contrition in my tone, "what explanation you gave 

Lady Broadhem on the subject?"  "If you mean," said Lady Ursula, "whether I accounted to 

mamma for your conduct as I do to myself--in other words, whether I betrayed your secret--I have 

carefully refrained from discussing the subject with her. Fortunately, after dinner at the 

Whitechapels' last night, Broadhem told me that he had seen you, and that you were coming here 

to-day, so I assured mamma that she would hear from you the true state of the case; though, of 

course, I felt myself bound to let her understand that, owing to

The question of the reliableness of these superscriptions is hotly debated. The balance of modern 

opinion is decidedly against their genuineness. As in greater matters, so here "the higher criticism" 

comes to the consideration of their claims with a prejudice against them, and on very arbitrary 

grounds determines for itself, quite irrespective of these ancient voices, the date and authorship of 

the psalms. The extreme form of this tendency is to be found in the masterly work of Ewald, who 

has devoted all his vast power of criticism (and eked it out with all his equally great power of 

confident assertion) to the book, and has come to the conclusion that we by you."  "And what did 

Lady Broadhem say?" I asked.  "She said that had it not been for a meeting she was obliged to 

attend this morning, she would have waited to see you to-day; but that she was sure I laboured 

under some strange delusion, and that a few words of explanation from you would smooth 

everything."  "Will you allow me to tell you what those few words are?" said I. "Lady Broadhem 

little imagines the real state of the case, because she knows what you do not know, that I am 

engaged in clearing off her own pecuniary liabilities, and making arrangements by which the old-

standing claims on the Broadhem estates may be met. You may never have heard how
