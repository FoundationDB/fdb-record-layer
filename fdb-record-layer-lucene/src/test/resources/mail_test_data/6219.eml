dracaena marginata "a dearth of woman's nursing and a lack of woman's tears=
." No one knew who the dead man was. He wore his identification tag about h=
im. No one cared except that it should be registered. If he was an officer =
he went to one part of the little graveyard just outside the fence; if he w=
as a private he went the Jupura itself, before it receives that tributary s=
tream.  The Rio Conorichite, or Itinivini, formerly facilitated the trade i=
n slaves carried on by the Portuguese in the Spanish territory. The slave-t=
raders went up by the Cassiquiare and the Cano Mee to Conorichite; and then=
ce dragged their canoes by dracaena marginata "a dearth of woman's nursing =
and a lack of woman's tears." No one knew who the dead man was. He wore his=
 identification tag about him. No one cared except that it should be regist=
ered. If he was an officer he went to one part of the little graveyard just=
 outside the fence; if he was a private he went the Jupura itself, before i=
t receives that tributary stream.  The Rio Conorichite, or Itinivini, forme=
rly facilitated the trade in slaves carried on by the Portuguese in the Spa=
nish territory. The slave-traders went up by the Cassiquiare and the Cano M=
ee to Conorichite; and thence dragged their canoes by _
a first aid dugout just back of the hill from whose top one could see the b=
attle. The first aid post=20

was a cave tunnelled a few yards into the hillside covered with railroad ir=
on and sandbags. In the=20

dugout was a little operating room where the wounded were bandaged before s=
tarting them down=20

the hill in the ambulance to the hospital, and three doctors and half a doz=
en stretcher bearers were=20

standing inside out of the misty rain.  As we had been climbing the hill in=
 the ambulance, the roar=20

of the big guns grew louder and louder. We believed it was French cannon. B=
ut when we got out=20

of the car we heard an angry whistle and a roar which told us that German s=
hells were coming in=20

near us. As we stood before the dugout shivering in the mist we saw beyond =
us, over the hill, the=20

glare of the French trench rockets lighting up the clouds above us weirdly,=
 and spreading a sickly=20

glow over the white muddy road before us. On the road skirting the very doo=
r of the dugout passed=20

a line of motor trucks and carts--the revitalment train. The mist walled us=
 in. Every few seconds=20

out of the mist came a huge grey truck or a lumbering two-wheeled cart; and=
 then, creaking=20

heavily past the dugout door, plunged into the mist again. Never did the pr=
ocession stop. At=20

regular intervals the German shells crashed into the woods farther up the h=
ill beyond us. But the=20

silent procession before us--looming out of the mist, passing us, and fadin=
g into the mist, kept=20

constantly moving. In the ghostly light of the misty moonshine, the process=
ion seemed to be=20

spectral--like a line of passing souls. A doctor came out of the dugout and=
 started up the hill. He,=20

too, was swallowed in the mist. Ahead of us up the road were noises that to=
ld us the Germans=20

were landing bombs there, not half a mile--perhaps not much more than a qua=
rter of a mile away.=20

The stretcher bearers told us that the Germans were shelling a cross-road. =
They shelled it every=20

night at midnight to smash the revitalment train. The shells were landing r=
ight in the counsels of=20

the monks; and those Indians who were not entirely satisfied with respect t=
o the consequences of=20

the dance, and the impotency of the evil spirit, were brought to the festiv=
ity. The oldest and most=20

timid of the Indians, however, imbued all the rest with a superstitious dre=
ad; all resolved to flee al=20

monte, and the missionary adjourned his project of turning into derision th=
e demon of the natives.=20

What extravagant ideas may sometimes enter the imagination of an idle monk,=
 who passes his life=20

in the forests, far from everything that can recall human civilization to h=
is mind. The violence with=20

which the attempt was made to execute in public at Tomo the mysterious danc=
e of the devils is the=20

more strange, as all the books written by the missionaries relate the effor=
ts they have used to=20

prevent the funereal dances, the dances of the sacred trumpet, and that anc=
ient dance of=20

serpents, the Queti, in which these wily animals are represented as issuing=
 from the forests, and=20

coming to drink with the men in order to deceive them, and carry off the wo=
men.  After two hours'=20

navigation from the mouth of the Tomo we arrived at the little mission of S=
an Miguel de Davipe,=20

founded in 1775, not by monks, but by a lieutenant of militia, Don Francisc=
o Bobadilla. The=20

missionary of the place, Father Morillo, with whom we spent some hours, rec=
eived us with great=20

hospitality. He even offered us Madeira wine, but, as an object of luxury, =
we should have preferred=20

wheaten bread. The want of bread becomes more sensibly felt in length of ti=
me than that of a=20

strong liquor. The Portuguese of the Amazon carry small quantities of Madei=
ra wine, from time to=20

time, to the Rio Negro; and the word madera, signifying wood in the Castili=
an language, the=20

monks, who are not much versed in the study of geography, had a scruple of =
celebrating mass=20

with Madeira wine, which they took for a fermented liquor extracted from th=
e trunk of some tree,=20

like palm-wine; and requested the guardian of the missions to decide, wheth=
er the=20


_
passing. The doctor who left us returned in a few minutes in an ambulance--=
wounded. Another=20

ambulance came up with four or five wounded. A shell had crashed in and wip=
ed out a truck load=20

of men. But the procession under the misty moon never stopped--never even h=
esitated. No driver=20

spoke. No teams or trucks cluttered up the road. As fast as a bomb shattere=
d the road out there=20

behind the mist, or made debris of a truck, the engineers hurried up, clear=
ed the way, removed the=20

debris and the ceaseless procession in the ghostly moonlight moved on. Anot=
her ambulance=20

brought in two more wounded.  After one o'clock the bombing stopped. Some o=
ther madera were=20

wine from grapes, or the juice of a tree. At the beginning of the conquest,=
 the question was=20

agitated, whether it were allowable for the priests, in celebrating mass, t=
o use any fermented liquor=20

analogous to grape-wine. The question, as might have been foreseen, was dec=
ided in the=20

negative.  At Davipe we bought some provisions, among which were fowls and =
a pig. This=20

purchase greatly interested our Indians, who had been a long while deprived=
 of meat. They=20

pressed us to depart, in order to reach the island of Dapa, where the pig w=
as to be killed and=20

roasted during the night. We had scarcely time to examine in the convent=20


_
taking its turn. Five men were buried that night in the little cemetery the=
re by the dugout. We stood=20

or sat about for a while! no one had much to say. The grey mist thickened a=
nd enveloped us. And=20

we became as very shadows ourselves. Somewhere in the mist up the hill, nea=
r where the=20

rocket's red glare flushed on the dim horizon, a man began whistling the in=
termezzo from "Thais."=20

It fitted the unreality of the scene, and soon two of us were whistling tog=
ether. He heard me and=20

paused. Then we walked toward one another whistling and met. It was the Gil=
ded Youth from the=20

ship--the Gilded Youth whose many millions had made him shimmer. He was not=
 shimmering=20

there on the sloppy hillside. He was a field service man, and we went back =
to his machine and sat=20

on it and talked music--music that seemed to be the only reality there in t=
he midst of death, and=20

the spirit that was moving men in the moonlight to forget death for somethi=
ng more real than=20

death. And so it came about that the crescendo of our talk ran thus:  And c=
ourage--that thing=20

which the Germans thought was their special gift from Heaven, bred of milit=
ary discipline, rising=20

out of German kultur--we know now is the commonest heritage of men. It is t=
he divine fire burning=20

in the souls of us that proves the case for democracy. For at base and unde=
rneath we are all=20

equals. In crises the rich man, the poor man, the thief, the harlot, the pr=
eacher, the teacher, the=20

labourer, the ignorant, the wise, all go to death for something that defies=
 death, something=20

immortal in the human heart. Those truck-drivers, those mule whackers, thos=
e common soldiers,=20

that doctor, these college men on the ambulances are brothers the great sto=
res of mani resin, and=20

cordage of the chiquichiqui palm, which deserves to be more known in Europe=
. This cordage is=20

extremely light; it floats upon the water, and is more durable in the navig=
ation of rivers than ropes=20

of hemp. It must be preserved at sea by being often wetted, and little expo=
sed to the heat of the=20

tropical sun. Don Antonio Santos, celebrated in the country for his journey=
 in search of lake=20

Parima, taught the Indians of the Spanish Rio Negro to make use of the peti=
oles of the=20

chiquichiqui, a palm-tree with pinnate leaves, of which we saw neither the =
flowers nor the fruit.=20

This officer is the only white man who ever came from Angostura to Grand Pa=
ra, passing by land=20

from the sources of the Rio Carony to those of the Rio Branco. He had studi=
ed the mode of=20

fabricating ropes from the chiquichiqui in the Portuguese colonies; and, on=
 his return from the=20

Amazon, he introduced this branch of industry into the missions of Guiana. =
It were to be wished=20

that extensive rope-walks could be established on the banks of the Rio Negr=
o and the=20

Cassiquiare, in order to make these cables an article of trade with Europe.=
 A small quantity is=20

already exported from Angostura to the West Indies; and it costs from fifty=
 to sixty per cent less=20

than cordage of hemp. Young palm-trees only being employed, they must be pl=
anted and carefully=20

cultivated.  A little above the mission of Davipe, the Rio Negro receives a=
 branch of the=20

Cassiquiare, the existence of which is a very remarkable phenomenon in the =
history of the=20

branchings of rivers. This branch issues from the Cassiquiare, north of Vas=
iva, bearing the name=20

of the Itinivini; and, after flowing for the=20


_
is the hope of the race, for it bespeaks a wider and deeper kinship of men.=
  So then we knew that=20

under the gilding of the Gilded Youth was fine gold. He was called for a wo=
unded man. As he=20

cranked up his car he asked rather too casually, "Have you seen our friend =
from the boat--the=20

pretty nurse?" We started to answer; the stretcher bearer called again and =
in an instant he went=20

buzzing away and we returned to the hospital.  We slept that night in a hos=
pital bed. The week=20

before three thousand men had passed through that hospital--some upon the l=
ong journey, so we=20

rose early the next morning. For some way to Henry and me there seemed a cu=
rious disquietude=20

about those hospital beds.  In the early morning just after dawn we saw the=
m taking out the dead=20

from the hospital. The stretcher bearers moved as quickly as they could wit=
h their burden through=20

the yard. A dozen soldiers and orderlies were in the hospital compound, but=
 no one turned a head=20

toward the bearers and their burden. There through a flat and almost uninha=
bited country, it falls=20

into the Rio Negro under the name of the Rio Conorichite. It appeared to me=
 to be more than one=20

hundred and twenty toises broad near its mouth. Although the current of the=
 Conorichite is very=20

rapid, this natural canal abridges by three days the passage from Davipe to=
 Esmeralda. We=20

cannot be surprised at a double communication between the Cassiquiare and t=
he Rio Negro when=20

we recollect that so many of the rivers of America form, as it were, deltas=
 at their confluence with=20

other rivers. Thus the Rio Branco and the Rio Jupura enter by a great numbe=
r of branches into the=20

Rio Negro and the Amazon. At the confluence of the Jupura there is a much m=
ore extraordinary=20

phenomenon. Before this river joins the Amazon, the latter, which is the pr=
incipal recipient, sends=20

off three branches called Uaranapu, Manhama, and Avateparana, to the Jupura=
, which is but a=20

tributary stream. The Portuguese astronomer, Ribeiro, has proved this impor=
tant fact.=20
