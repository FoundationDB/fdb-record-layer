654 About fifty years before the birth of Copernicus, de Cusa wrote as     =
  follows: "Though the=20

world may not be absolutely infinite, no one       can represent it to hims=
elf as finite, since human=20

reason is       incapable of assigning to it any term.... For in the same w=
ay that       our earth cannot=20

be in the centre of the Universe, as thought, no       more could the spher=
e of the fixed stars be in=20

it.... Thus this       world is like a vast machine, having its centre [Dei=
ty] everywhere,       and its=20

circumference nowhere [_machina mundi, quasi habens ubique       centrum, e=
t nullibi=20

circumferentiam_].... Hence, the earth not being       in the centre, canno=
t therefore be motionless=20

... and though it is       far smaller than the sun, one must not conclude =
for all that, that       she is=20

worse [_vilior_--more vile].... One cannot see whether its       inhabitant=

 all four of you, but I am more=20

likely to kill the first than the second, the second than the third, and th=
e third than the last. I claim,=20

then, the right to choose my opponent. If you refuse this right you may kil=

D'Artagnan said nothing, but their silence seemed to imply consent.  "Well,=
 then," said Mordaunt,=20

"I choose for my adversary the man who, not thinking himself worthy to be c=

Fere, calls himself Athos."  Athos sprang up, but after an instant of motio=
nless silence he said, to=20

the astonishment of his friends, "Monsieur Mordaunt, a duel between us is i=
mpossible. Submit this=20

honour to somebody else." And he sat down.  "Ah!" said Mordaunt, with a sne=
