experience; yet he was right in taking the great figure of Roland for the o=
uter clothing or language=20

of his emotions, since heroic sentiments had already connected themselves w=
ith Charlemagne=E2=80=99s=20

peer, as they had not yet with William of Normandy, nor with his immediate =
predecessors. In=20

English history there have been efficient and picturesque rulers in plenty,=
 yet the poets were right=20

who have retold their national epics in this time Charles was very eager to=
 propitiate the empire, in=20

furtherance of those schemes of monarchy that now began to assume definite =
shape in his=20

imagination. The Archduke Maximilian, though somewhat more than three years=
 younger than=20

Marie, and though poor, was nevertheless the son of the emperor, and might =
be considered useful=20

to Burgundy. The negotiations were conducted quietly; Charles did not, it a=
ppears, wish to=20


_
the story of Arthur rather than in the biographies of Alfred or Edward I or=
 Cromwell; for the=20

Arthurian legend as the race has chosen to remember it is of richer fabric =
emotionally and of a=20

simpler structure than any nearer and more actual history could well be. Th=
eodore Roosevelt, for=20

all we know, may have been a greater man than Cromwell, and circumstances m=
ight change, and=20

therefore did not wish to commit himself to this match beyond the power of =
recall.  For the present,=20

however, the noble lovers, who had never met, were both rather young; there=
 was no need to=20

hurry matters, since Charles himself was still in the prime of life. The di=
sastrous campaign of the=20

great duke in Switzerland=20


_
seem more significant, but if the poet wishes to say things about the stren=
uous life, he had better=20

say them now through the image of Cromwell, about whom our emotions are mor=
e classified;=20

better still if he says them through the image of King Arthur, who much mor=
e than Cromwell has=20

become a precise symbol in the imagination. Arthur was to have been the her=
o of Milton=E2=80=99s epic=E2=80=94at=20

least, Milton considered him for a possible hero but discarded him in favor=
, not of Cromwell or=20

Hampden, but of Adam; and again the choice was wise, since Adam is still an=
 image more=20

universally understood than any of Milton=E2=80=99s contemporaries, and we =
know what we are expected to=20

feel when we hear his story.  To say then that in writing, even when our pu=
rpose is art and not=20

satire, we should express ourselves in terms of the life about us, is to la=
y down a formula which=20

has been contradicted in practise by the influential writers of the world. =
To find a language already=20

wide-spread and therefore intelligible, the artist will always draw to some=
 extent on the past, even=20

though he does so unconsciously, and how far friendly and unfriendly, and b=
y a great romancer=20

who loved all chivalry and who yet could not withhold his admiration from t=
he intrepid Swiss=20

freemen who bore down the power of Burgundy at Granson, at Morat, and at Na=
ncy. Yet, whether=20

we consider Charles a great ruler and leader or a mere military ruffian, no=
 one can look without=20

pity upon that snow-covered battlefield of Nancy, where a generous foe and =
the heartbroken=20

servants of "the pride of chivalry" must look in vain for two days for the =
body of Charles; none=20

could surely tell how he had fallen; and when they found his frozen body th=
e dogs had eaten half=20

of one cheek, and the wounds on the head rendered it almost unrecognizable.=
  Mademoiselle de=20

Bourgogne, as she was now to be known in earnest, was far away in Ghent whe=
n the fatal news of=20

her father's death was brought. Before it could reach her it had reached th=
e crafty old king. For=20

Louis it was the sweetest news he could have heard; his greatest foe was pr=
ovidentially removed,=20

and as his adversary in Burgundy there was now but a girl scarcely grown, a=
 girl whose selfish=20

advisers=20


_
back into the past will depend on what it is he wants to express. In _Henry=
 Esmond_, Thackeray=20

used the age of Marlborough to express a flavor of romance that could not b=
e said in life of a later=20

date. But when he had satire for his purpose, as in _Vanity Fair_, he chose=
 a period comparatively=20

modern. It is but fair to observe, however, that Thackeray follows this pri=
nciple with very uncertain=20

skill. The period he chose for his great satire was somewhat more remote th=
an for _Pendennis_ or=20

_The Newcomes_, where his purpose was less how to bribe or to ruin, as suit=
ed his interest. Well=20

may we believe that when the news of Charles's death reached that French co=
urt where so many=20

of the nobles had felt him to be their only help against the anti-feudal po=
licy of Louis, "not one ate=20

half he could at dinner," as the shrewd Comines says; now that the pillar o=
f independent baronage=20

was gone, who could tell what the king might do?  Marie de Bourgogne was al=
most a prisoner=20

among her too devoted subjects, the burghers of Ghent. She and her counsell=
ors realized from the=20

first=20
