philodendron monstera expected to spend the day.  All went well until the d=

 at the _
he would ever return to them or not, was a matter of conjecture.  All the f=
amily mourned his loss,=20

especially the baby, who cried half a day for "Bar-Bar," as he called the b=
ear.  One cold December=20

evening when the farmer was bedding down the horse, he imagined he heard a =
deep, steady=20

breathing under the barn floor, and after listening for some time, was sure=
 of it.  no light or=20

thoughtless remark could fall from those lips. He wondered to what Church s=
he belonged?=20

Protestant or papal? Her husband, being an American, was probably a Protest=
ant, but he was a=20

gentleman of the South, and with nothing puritanical about him. She was a E=
uropean, and=20

probably of a Latin race. In all likelihood she was a Roman Catholic.  It w=
as Wednesday=20


_
that some neighbor's dog had gone under the barn to sleep, so he went and l=
ifted up a trap-door=20

that led to the cellar, which was not deep.  He whistled for the dog to com=
e out, but no dog=20

appeared.  He could still hear the breathing and was much mystified by it, =
so he got a lantern and=20

went under the barn to settle his doubts.  To his great astonishment he fou=
nd Black Bruin curled=20

up in one corner, nearly covered with old hay that he had scraped together =
for the purpose.  He=20

was very sleepy, and only grunted when the man touched him with his foot an=
d spoke to him.  As=20

he seemed well content with the winter quarters that he had selected, the m=
an left him and went=20

back to his chores.  Not until the middle of March did he again appear, alt=
hough different members=20

of the family often went to the trap-door and called for him to come out.  =
He seemed to be obeying=20

a strongly rooted habit in the bear nature, and he doubtless knew what was =
best for a sturdy cub=20

like himself.  One warm March morning the mistress thought she heard some o=
ne in the back=20

room, and supposing that a neighbor had come in, opened the door.  The intr=
uder was no stranger=20

to the family, for there was Black Bruin, standing on his hind legs, lickin=
g off the sticky to dine with=20

Lord and Lady Montairy.  Lothair sighed. He was so absorbed by his new feel=
ings that he shrunk=20

from society with a certain degree of aversion. He felt it quite out of his=
 power to fulfil his=20

engagement. He sent an excuse. It was Lothair=E2=80=99s first excuse. In sh=
ort, he =E2=80=9Cthrew over=E2=80=9D the=20

Montairys, to whom he was so much attached, whom he so much admired, and wh=
ose society he=20

had hitherto so highly prized.  To =E2=80=9Cthrow over=E2=80=9D a host is t=
he most heinous of social crimes. It ought=20

never to be pardoned. It disjoints a party, often defeats the combinations =
which might affect the=20

results of a season, and generally renders the society incoherent and unsat=
isfactory. If the outrage=20

could ever be condoned, it might be in the instance of a young man very ine=
xperienced, the victim=20

of some unexpected condition of nervous feelings over which the defaulter h=
as really no control.  It=20

was evening, and the restless Lothair walked forth without a purpose, and i=
n a direction which he=20

rarely visited. =E2=80=9CIt is a wonderful place,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=
=9Cthis London; a nation, not a city; with a population=20

greater than some kingdoms, and districts as different as if they were unde=
r different governments=20

and spoke different languages. And what do I know of it?=20


_
maple-syrup pail.  He had remembered his old delight in syrup.  Perhaps he =
had even got a whiff=20

of the sweet on the spring air, and his nose had told him what was going on=
.  The bear's scent is=20

very keen, and this and his acute hearing make up for his poor eyesight.  B=
lack Bruin, on his=20

reappearance, was at once taken back into the family's affection, and pette=
d and spoiled, all of=20

which seemed to suit him admirably.  For a week or two, however, he would e=
at very little, and=20

appeared to come to his appetite gradually.  At first the good people thoug=
ht he was sick, but an=20

old woodsman explained to them that the bear was always fastidious after hi=
bernation.  In the wild=20

state he will eat only buds and grasses, and perhaps a very few roots.  He =
is wise, after the way of=20

the wild beasts, and knows that his digestive organs are not in condition t=
o do hard work; but when=20

the right hour comes, he will have a meal that will make up for much fastin=
g.  The roguishness and=20

capacity for mischief that Black Bruin had shown during his first year of c=
ubhood, increased=20

tenfold, as he grew older and stronger.  Tree-climbing, which he had learne=
d late in the summer of=20

his first year, became a passion with him.  He climbed the elms and the map=
les along the road=20

and the fruit trees in the orchard.  In the barn, too, he clambered about o=
n the scaffolds and pried=20

into all the corners with his inquisitive nose.  A neighbor's boy often cam=
e to the farmhouse to=20

romp and wrestle with the bear-cub.  Nothing pleased him in a park, two or =
three squares, and half=20

a dozen streets!=E2=80=9D  So he walked on and soon crossed Oxford Street, =
like the Rhine a natural=20

boundary, and then got into Portland Place, and then found himself in the N=
ew Road, and then he=20

hailed a cruising Hansom, which he had previously observed was well horsed.=
  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98Tis the gondola of=20

London,=E2=80=9D said Lothair as he sprang in.  =E2=80=9CDrive on till I te=
ll you to stop.=E2=80=9D  And the Hansom drove on,=20

through, endless boulevards, some bustling, some dingy, some tawdry and fla=
ring, some=20

melancholy and mean; rows of garden gods, planted on the walls of yards ful=
l of vases and=20

divinities of concrete, huge railway halls, monster hotels, dissenting chap=
els in the form of Gothic=20

churches, quaint ancient almshouses that were once built in the fields, and=
 tea-gardens and=20

stingo-houses and knackers=E2=80=99 yards. They were in a district far beyo=
nd the experience of Lothair,=20

which indeed had been exhausted when he had passed Eustonia, and from that =
he had been long=20

separated. The way was broad but ill-lit, with houses of irregular size but=
 generally of low=20

elevation, and sometimes detached in smoke-dried gardens. The road was beco=
ming a bridge=20

which crossed a canal, with barges and wharves and timber-yards, when their=
 progress was=20

arrested by a crowd. It seemed a sort of procession; there was a banner, an=
d the lamp-light fell=20

upon a religious emblem. Lothair was interested, and desired the driver not=
 to endeavor to=20

advance. The procession was crossing the road and entering a building.=20


_
was quite an expert wrestler, once he learned how to floor his adversary.  =
Whenever two or three=20

boys came into the farmyard, if Black Bruin was anywhere about, he would sh=
uffle up to them and=20

rearing upon his hind legs, invite them, in the plainest language, "to come=
 on."  His master also=20

taught him to hold a broom in his arms in imitation of a =E2=80=9CI believe=
 it is a meeting about one of their=20

schools. They always have banners.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think I will get ou=
t,=E2=80=9D said Lothair to his driver. =E2=80=9CThis, I=20

suppose, will pay your fare.=E2=80=9D  The man stared with delight at the s=
overeign in his astonished palm,=20

and in gratitude suggested that he should remain and wait for the gentleman=
, but the restless=20

Lothair=20


_
performed by their shaggy friend, the children would shout with delight, at=
 which the cub would loll=20

out his tongue and seem greatly pleased.  He appeared to understand clearly=
 that they thought=20

him the smartest bear in the world.  His old trick of hunting for hens' nes=
ts now recurred to him,=20

and he returned to it with renewed zest.  In fact, Black Bruin seemed not t=
o forget any of his many=20

forms of  =E2=80=9CSir, sir,=E2=80=9D said the man, leaning down his head a=
s low as possible from his elevated seat,=20

and speaking in a hushed voice, =E2=80=9Cyou are a real gentleman. Do you k=
now what all this is?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes,=20

yes; some meeting about a Roman Catholic school.=E2=80=9D  The man shook hi=
s head. =E2=80=9CYou are a real=20

gentleman, and I will tell you the truth. They meet about the schools of th=
e order of St.=20

Joseph=E2=80=94over the left=E2=80=94it is a=20


_
as well.  He not only hunted hens' nests outside, but frequently broke into=
 the hen-house, just like=20

any other chicken thief, and ate eggs freely.  He always skulked into a cor=
ner when caught and=20

seemed to expect the thrashing that he got for such thieving.  He followed =
the farm-hands into the=20

hay-field, as he had done the year before, to look for bumblebees' nests, b=
ut he was not content=20

with lawful plunder.  One day the haymakers  =E2=80=9CA Fenian meeting?=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy, ay, and you cannot enter=20

that place without a ticket. Just you try! However, if a gentleman like you=
 wants to go, you shall=20

have my ticket,=E2=80=9D said the cab-driver; =E2=80=9Cand here it is. And =
may I drive to-morrows as true a=20

gentleman as I have driven to-day!=E2=80=9D  So saying, he took a packet fr=
om his breast-pocket, and=20

opening it offered to Lothair a green slip of paper, which was willingly ac=
cepted. =E2=80=9CI should like=20
