philodendron monstera easily have touched it with my rifle, but just at thi=

 quickly turned its head half round towards me; in the same instant I took =
the temple shot, and, by the flash of the rifle, I saw that it fell. Jumpin=
g forward past the huge body, I fired the left-hand barrel at an elephant t=
hat had advanced from the herd; it fell immediately! Now came the moment fo=
r a grand rush, as they stumbled in confusion over the last with the feelin=
gs of helpfulness, sympathy, and intimate friendship as to form a union of =
body, mind and spirit. It further should be associated with the love of and=
 desire for children.  This complex is best secured by the institution of m=

 intimate friendship, and above all, in that unique bond between mother and=

I took a steady shot behind the ear with the little Fletcher rifle. This ha=
ppened to be one of those=20

fortunate shots that consoles you for many misses, and the saucy old hippo =
turned upon his back=20

and rolled about in tremendous struggles, lashing the still and deep pool i=
nto waves, until he at=20

length disappeared. We knew that he was settled; thus my people started off=
 towards the village,=20

and in a marvellousiy short time a frantic crowd of Arabs arrived with came=
ls, ropes, axes, knives,=20

and everything necessary for an onslaught upon the hippo, who, up to this t=
ime, had not appeared=20

upon the surface. In about an hour and a half from the time he received the=
 bullet, we discovered=20

his carcase floating about two hundred yards lower down the river. Several =
heads of large=20

crocodiles appeared and vanished suddenly within a few feet of the floating=
 carcase, therefore the=20

Arabs considered it prudent to wait until the stream should strand the body=
 upon the pebbly=20

shallows about half a mile below the pool. Upon arrival at that point, ther=
e was a general rush, and=20

the excited crowd secured the hippo by many ropes, and hauled it to the sho=
re. It was a very fine=20

bull, as the skin without the head measured twelve feet three inches. I had=
 two haunches kept for=20

the sheik, and a large quantity of fat, which is highly and deservedly priz=
ed by the relationships is=20

part of a larger question, viz., the ever-widening gap between the formal t=
eaching of the Church=20

and the actual belief of the present generation, including many who by bapt=
ism and early training=20

belong to her fold.  This gap between authority and actuality of belief imp=
oses a strain on=20

intellectual integrity and weakens the foundations of a real allegiance. Fo=
r those of us who are of=20

mature years the gap is bridged by the tender associations of our childhood=
 and the memory of=20

parents, for whom no such gap existed, and whose faith and character have l=
eft indelible=20

impressions on our lives. But for the youth of to-day no such bridge exists=
. The War has caused a=20

hiatus and thought has broken with tradition. Thus, youth is no longer will=
ing to accept forms and=20

formulae only on account of their age. So it has set out on a voyage of inq=
uiry, and finding some=20

things which are doubtful and others which are insufficient, is searching f=
or forms of expression=20

more in harmony with the realities of life and knowledge. Although becoming=
 estranged in thought=20

from the Church, it is possessed of deep religious feeling and, firm on the=
 rock foundation of faith,=20

is trying to build a superstructure more in accord with the progress of rev=
elation, not only in=20

religion, but in science, and the needs of the world in which it moves and =
has=20

animal. Those portions secured, with a reserve of meat for ourselves, the u=
sual disgusting scene=20

of violence commenced, the crowd falling upon the carcase like maddened hya=
enas.    * Hasinth is=20

the Arabic for hippopotamus.  "In the evening I resolved to watch the dhurr=
a fields for elephants.=20

At about 9 P.M. I arrived in the plantations, with three men carrying spare=
 guns, among whom was=20

Bacheet, who had at length an opportunity for which he had long yearned. I =
entrusted to him the=20

'Baby,' which he promised to put into my hands the very moment that I shoul=
d fire my second=20

barrel. I carried my own Ceylon No. 10, made by Beattie. We had not been ha=
lf an hour in the=20

dhurra fields before we met a couple of Arab watchers, who informed us that=
 a herd of elephants=20

was already in the plantation; we accordingly followed our guides. In about=
 a quarter of an hour we=20

distinctly heard the cracking of the dhurra stems, as the elephants browsed=
, and trampled them=20

beneath their feet.  "Taking the proper position of the wind, I led our par=
ty cautiously in the=20

direction of the sound, and in about five minutes I came in view of the sla=
te-coloured and dusky=20

forms of the herd. The moon was bright, and I counted nine elephants; they =
had trampled a space=20

of about fifty yards square into a barren level, and they were now slowly m=
oving forward, feeding=20

as they went. One elephant, unfortunately, was separated from the herd, and=
 was about forty=20

yards in the rear; this fellow I was afraid would render our approach diffi=
cult. Cautioning my men,=20

especially Bacheet, to keep close to me with the spare rifles, I crept alon=
g the alleys formed by the=20

tall rows of dhurra, and after carefully stalking against the wind, I felt =
sure that it would be=20

necessary to kill the single elephant before I should be able to attack the=
 herd. Accordingly, I crept=20

nearer and nearer, well concealed in the favourable crop of high and shelte=
ring stems, until I was=20

within fifteen yards of the hindmost       Far be it, that I should write t=
hee sin or blame,     Or think=20

thee unbefitting holiest place,     Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets, =
    Whose bed is undefiled=20

and chaste pronounced,     Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.=
     Here Love his=20

golden shafts employs, here lights     His constant lamp, and waves his pur=
ple wings,     Reigns=20

here and revels; not in the bought smile     Of harlots, loveless, joyless,=
 unendeared,     Casual=20

fruition; nor in court-amours,     Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight=
 ball,     Or serenate,=20

which the starved lover sings     To his proud fair, best quitted with disd=
ain.     These, lulled by=20

nightingales, embracing slept,     And on their naked limbs the flowery roo=
f     Showered roses,=20

which the morn repaired.                                          _Paradise=
 Lost,_=20

Book IV.                           LOVE--MARRIAGE--BIRTH CONTROL   May I ma=
ke certain preliminary=20

observations? Painters and poets depict Love to us in golden hues and arous=
e in us happy and=20

sympathetic, and, I trust, reminiscent response, helping us to realise that=
 life without the love of=20

man and woman would be like the world without sunshine.  Though, therefore,=
 the social student=20

in his approach to the subject is not helped by the beauties of colour and =
song, it behoves him to=20

avoid undue solemnity, and still more an air of portentous foreboding.  In =
each age customs have=20

been deplored as heralds of evil, but the evils have seldom materialised.  =
One of the difficulties of=20

this subject is that those who are called upon to give counsel are apt to f=
orget the strength of the=20

forces to be dealt with, for it is during youth especially that sex attract=
ions are so powerful, and,=20

may I add, so delightful. Middle-aged people may be divided into three clas=
ses.  Those who are=20

still young.  Those who have forgotten they were young.  Those who were nev=
er young.  And it is=20

_
As I had never shot one of the African species, I was determined to follow =
the Ceylon plan, and=20

get as near as possible; therefore I continued to creep from row to row of =
dhurra, until I at length=20

stood at the very tail of the elephant in the next row. I could address thi=
s audience.  I will confine=20

my attention to the sexual relationships between unrelated adult people in =
youth and prime.  It is=20

common ground that sex love between such people should be the physical expr=
ession of a lasting=20

affection, and be so=20
