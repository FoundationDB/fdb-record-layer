poor Ben, and I can't help thinking of the lines,--      "'Who speaks not n=
eeded truth lest he offend,=20

Hath spared himself--but sacrificed his friend.'  I hope that my visit to S=
tone to-morrow may not be=20

as utterly profitless as I fear that the three last have been."     XIX.  T=
he Test.   While Persis and=20

Ned Franks are conversing together in their little parlor, we will turn for=
 a short time to Norah,=20

whom we shall find in their little garden, with a full glow of the setting =
sun around her, as she is=20

stooping over a flower-bed busily engaged in weeding.  Even in the bright s=
eason of spring, even=20

in the cheerful home of the Frankses, since her return from London, the tim=
e had passed wearily=20

and anxiously to Norah. She shrank from notice, she dreaded questions, and,=
 though nothing was=20

said to make her feel that it was so, she knew that her maintenance must be=
 a burden on the=20

slender income of her uncle. The accommodation in the school-house was smal=
l. Persis, at some=20

inconvenience, had given up her only store-closet to serve as a sleeping-ro=
om for Norah; and if=20

the good housewife cheerily laughed over her own little difficulties in fin=
ding a place where she=20

might stow away jams and bacon, and Franks declared that the closer people =
were packed=20

together, the less danger there was of their chafing one another, Norah fel=
t that the little domestic=20

circle had been complete without her, and that her pale, sad face could not=
 add to the=20

cheerfulness of a married pair. Even the food of which the orphan guest was=
 so kindly pressed to=20

partake freely must make a sensible difference in the household expenses of=
 those who had so=20

little to spare. Norah longed for the means of earning her own bread; but e=
mployment in needle-

work, even had she been clever at sewing, could scarcely be procured in the=
 retired neighborhood=20

of Colme. The young girl would gladly have gone again into service; but to =
whom could she apply=20

for a character? How often, with bitter regret for the past, did Norah ask =
herself that question? Her=20

only resource was prayer. She entreated him whose mercy, as she trusted and=
 believed, had=20

forgiven her sin, to open for her some door of usefulness, to give her some=
 means of honestly=20

earning a livelihood. Norah was ready to take the lowest place, the hardest=
 work, the smallest=20

wages, if she might but struggle back to a position in which she could agai=
n maintain herself by=20

her labor.  As Norah rose from her stooping posture, she saw Mrs. Curtis, t=
he vicar's wife,=20

approaching towards her. The lady, who was the general counsellor and frien=
d of the villagers of=20

Colme, had always shown kindness to Norah, and to be spoken to by her would=
, in former times,=20

have called up a beaming smile in the face of the girl; but Norah now met t=
he vicar's wife with a=20

feeling of shame and fear.  "Good-evening to you, Norah Peele; I am glad to=
 find you alone, for I=20

wish a little quiet talk with you," said Mrs. Curtis. "Let us go to yon arb=
or at the end of the garden,=20

where we shall be undisturbed."  Norah followed the lady along the narrow g=
ravel path which=20

Franks had bordered with box. The poor girl dreaded the interview before he=
r, but silently prayed,=20

as she walked along, that she might be enabled to answer truthfully whateve=
r painful questions=20

might be asked her.  When the arbor was reached, Mrs. Curtis seated herself=
 on the rustic bench,=20

which was the handiwork of the one-armed sailor. No one could approach the =
spot unseen; the=20

lady had chosen it in order that the conversation between herself and Norah=
 might not be=20

interrupted or overheard.  "Norah," said Mrs. Curtis, "my housemaid is abou=
t to leave me to be=20

married to Rob Gates, the nephew of the miller. I am therefore looking out =
for a trustworthy girl to=20

take her place. Knowing both you and your family for so long as I have done=
, it is natural that my=20

thoughts should turn towards you."  The girl's heart throbbed fast with a n=
ewly awakened hope=20



which she yet scarcely dared to indulge.  "But," continued the lady, (what =
a terrible word was that=20

We drove on for some minutes in silence. I was sure now that Lisa had been =
playing with me, that=20

all along she had had some special destination in her mind, and that she ha=
d her own reasons for=20

wanting to bring me to it. But what use to ask more questions? She did not =
mean me to find out=20

until she was ready for me to know.  She had told the man to go quickly, an=
d he obeyed. He=20

rushed us round corners and through street after street which I had never s=
een before--quiet=20

streets, where there were no cabs, and no gay people coming home from theat=
res and dinners. At=20

last we turned into a particularly dull little street, and stopped.  "Is th=
is the Rue d'Hollande?" Lisa=20

enquired of the driver, jumping quickly up and putting her head out of the =
window.  "_Mais oui,=20

Mademoiselle_," I heard the man answer.  "Then stop where you are, please, =
until I give you new=20

orders."  "I should have thought this was the sort of street where nothing =
could possibly happen,"=20

said I.  "Wait a little, and maybe you'll find out you're mistaken. If noth=
ing does, and we aren't=20

amused, we can go on somewhere else."  She had not finished speaking when a=
 handsome=20

electric carriage spun almost noiselessly round the corner. It slowed down =
before a gate set in a=20

high wall, almost covered with creepers, and though the street was dimly li=
ghted and we had=20

stopped at a little distance, I could see that the house behind the wall, t=
hough not large, was very=20

quaint and pretty, an unusual sort of house for Paris, it seemed to me.  Sc=
arcely had the electric=20

carriage come to a halt when the chauffeur, in neat, dark livery, jumped do=
wn to open the door;=20

and quickly a tall, slim woman sprang out, followed by another, elderly and=
 stout, who looked like a=20

lady's maid.  I could not see the face of either, but the light of the lamp=
 on our side of the way=20

shone on the hair of the slim young woman in black, who got down first. It =
was gorgeous hair, the=20

colour of burnished copper. I had heard a man say once that only two women =
in the world had hair=20

of that exact shade: Jane Hading and Maxine de Renzie.  My heart gave a gre=
at bound, and I=20

guessed in an instant why Lisa had brought me here, though how she could ha=
ve learned where=20

to find the house, I didn't know.  "Oh, Lisa!" I reproached her. "How _coul=
d_ you?"  "It really _was_=20

an inspiration. I'm sure of that now," she said quietly, though I could tel=
l by her tone that she was=20

trying to hide excitement. "You never saw that woman before, except once on=
 the stage, yet you=20

know who she is. You jumped as if she had fired a shot at you."  "I know by=
 the hair," I answered.=20

"I might have foreseen this would be the kind of thing you would think of--=
it's like you."  "You ought=20

to be grateful to me for thinking of it," said Lisa. "It's entirely for you=
r sake; and it's quite true, it was=20

an inspiration to come here. This afternoon in the train I read an intervie=
w in 'Femina' with Maxine=20

de Renzie, about the new play she's produced to-night. There was a picture =
of her, and a=20

description of her house in the Rue d'Hollande."  "Now you have satisfied y=
our curiosity. You've=20

seen her back, and her maid's back, and the garden wall," I said, more shar=
ply than I often speak=20

to Lisa. "I shall tell the driver to take us to the hotel at once. I know w=
hy you want to wait here, but=20

you shan't--I won't. I'm going away as quickly as I can."  She caught my dr=
ess as I would have=20

leaned out to speak to the driver. Her manner had suddenly changed, and she=
 was all softness=20

and sweetness, and persuasiveness.  "Di, dearest girl, _don't_ be cross wit=
h me; please don't=20

misunderstand," she implored. "I love you, you know, even if you sometimes =
think I don't; I want=20

you to be happy--oh, wait a moment, and listen. I've been so miserable all =
day, knowing you were=20

miserable; and I've felt horribly guilty for fear, after all, I'd said too =
much. Of course if you'd=20

guessed where I meant to come, you wouldn't have stirred out of the hotel, =
and it was better for=20



you to see for yourself. Unless Ivor Dundas came here with a motor-cab, as =
we did, he could=20

hardly have arrived yet, so if he does come, we shall know. If he _doesn't_=
=20


_
cannot offer you a situation without a clear knowledge of the cause of your=
 leaving your last one.=20

The information which has reached me may or may not be correct. Many innoce=
nt persons are=20

hardly judged; some are the victims of a slander. A mistress may be injudic=
ious, or she may be=20

unjust to her servants."  "Oh, no, Mrs. Lowndes was not unjust, at least no=
t in sending me away,"=20

said Norah, the large tears gathering in her downcast eyes. "She was kind a=
nd generous, and=20

good to me, till--till"--a smothered sob closed the sentence.  "Norah, you =
must feel that no idle=20

curiosity leads me to question you thus. I would give no needless pain. But=
 will you tell me, as a=20

friend who has your best interests much at heart, the simple truth regardin=
g the circumstances=20

which led to your leaving London? I cannot know how to serve you, I cannot =
know how to advise,=20

without that full information which can shall know, too. Think how happy yo=
u'll feel if he _doesn't!_=20

I'll apologise to you then, frankly and freely; and I suppose you would not=
 mind apologising to him,=20

if necessary?"  "He may be in the house now," I said, more to myself than t=
o Lisa.  "If he is, he'll=20

come out and meet her when he hears the gate open. There, it's open now. Th=
e maid's unlocked=20

it. No, there's nobody in the garden."  "I can't stop here and watch for hi=
m, like a spy," I said.  "Not=20

like a spy, but like a girl who thinks she may have done a man an injustice=
. It's for _his_ sake I ask=20

you to stay. And if you won't, I must stay alone. If you insist on going aw=
ay, I'll get out and stand in=20

the street, either until Ivor Dundas has come, or until I'm sure he isn't c=
oming. But how much=20

better to wait and see for yourself."  "You know I can't go off and leave y=
ou standing here," I=20

answered. "And I can't leave you sitting=20


_
"Have I not suffered enough yet?" was the silent thought of poor Norah. "Mu=
st I tell to her, whose=20

good opinion I prize so much, that which will make me lose that good opinio=
n forever, and prevent=20

her from thinking of taking such a deceitful girl into her service?" And th=
en came the strong=20

temptation to soften and gloss over her own fault, to lay the chief blame u=
pon Milly, or to avoid=20

alone. I might meet--" I would not finish my sentence, but Lisa must nave g=
uessed the name on=20

my lips.  "The only thing to do, then, is for us to stop where we are, toge=
ther," said Lisa, "for stop I=20

must and shall, in justice to myself, to Ivor Dundas and to you. You couldn=
't force me away, even if=20

you wanted to use force."  "Which you know is out of the question," I said,=
 desperately.=20
