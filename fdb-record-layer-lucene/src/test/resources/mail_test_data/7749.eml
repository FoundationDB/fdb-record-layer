affably at her visitor, who was exclaiming:  "My dear girl, I'm so glad to =

 on Fanny's handsome=20

features, on her rich lips, pearl earrings, her eyes with their curious col=
or, grey green, that were so=20

sparkling and alive. And Ethel thought to herself in dismay: "How much more=
 attractive she is!=20

Was my first feeling about her all wrong, or is it that I'm getting used to=
 these New Yorkers? I=20

thought she was just hard--all brass! She isn't! She's--she's dangerous! Wh=
