"  And then we knew what=20

the Young Doctor was doing there in the garden among the adoring flowers. H=
e was writing those=20

verses. And, we in our forties, after such things have passed, were sitting=
 in a commonplace room=20

in a comfortable hotel, five hundred miles from the battle and twenty years=
 from the primrose path,=20

trying to imagine it all. And like Stephen Blackpool in Dickens' "Hard Time=
s" about all we could=20

make of it was that it was a mess! They were both so remote, the love affai=
r that had followed us=20

over Europe, and the war which we had followed so wearily. The love affair =
was of course a look=20

backward, for us, to days "when lutes were touched and songs were sung"; bu=
t the war and all its=20

significance stretched ahead. It portended change. For change always follow=
s war.  Yet life, in=20

spite of the current of war twisting so many things askew, does proceed in =
England calmly, and in=20

something like order. As we looked back upon our London experience it seeme=
d to Henry and me=20

that we were hurrying from luncheons to teas and teas to dinners and from d=
inners to the second=20

act of good shows all the time. For in London we had no Red Cross duties. W=
e were on our way=20

home, and people were kind to us, and best of all we could speak the langua=
ge--after a fashion--

and understand in a general way what was going on. We had dined at two Amer=
ican embassies=20

on the continent and had worn our tail coats. Of course Red Cross uniforms =
were proper evening=20

regalia at any social function. But someway a flannel shirt and a four-in-h=
and tie--even a khaki=20

coloured tie, did not seem to Henry and me de rigueur. We weren't raised th=
at way and we=20

couldn't come to it. So we wore our tails. We noticed in France and Italy t=
hat other men wore=20

dinner coats, and we bemoaned our stupidity in bringing our tails and leavi=
ng our dinner coats in=20

New York. We fancied in our blindness that on the continent no one noticed =
the difference. But in=20

England, there doubt disappeared. Whenever we went to an English dinner, in=
 our tails, some=20

English ladyship through a lorgnette or a spyglass of some kind gave us the=
 once-over with the=20

rough blade of her social disapproval and we felt like prize boobs suddenly=
 kidnapped from a tacky=20

party and dropped into a grand ball. But we couldn't help it. How should we=
 have known, without=20

our wives to pack our trunks for us in New York, that tails had atrophied i=
n European society and=20

from all humidity under the influence of a uniform temperature, the preserv=
ation of these articles=20

would be no less perfect if their origin dated from a period far more remot=
e. A tradition circulates=20

among the Guahibos, that the warlike Atures, pursued by the Caribs, escaped=
 to the rocks that=20

rise in the middle of the Great Cataracts; and there that nation, heretofor=
e so numerous, became=20

gradually extinct, as well as its language. The last families of the Atures=
 still existed in 1767, in the=20

time of the missionary Gili. At the period of our voyage an old parrot was =
shown at Maypures, of=20

which the inhabitants said, and the fact is worthy of observation, that the=
y did not understand what=20

it said, because it spoke the language of the Atures.  We opened, to the gr=
eat concern of our=20

guides, several mapires, for the purpose of examining attentively the form =
of the skulls. They were=20

all marked by the characteristics of the American race, with the exception =
of two or three, which=20

approached indubitably to the Caucasian. In the middle of the Cataracts, in=
 the most inaccessible=20

spots, cases are found strengthened with iron bands, and filled with Europe=
an tools, vestiges of=20

clothes, and glass trinkets. These articles, which have given rise to the m=
ost absurd reports of=20

treasures hidden by the Jesuits, probably belonged to Portuguese traders wh=
o had penetrated into=20

these savage countries. May we suppose that the skulls of European race, wh=
ich we saw mingled=20

with the skeletons of the natives, and preserved with the same care, were t=
he remains of some=20



Portuguese travellers who had died of sickness, or had been killed in battl=
e? The aversion evinced=20

by the natives for whatever is not of their own race renders this hypothesi=
s little probable. Perhaps=20

fugitive mestizos of the missions of the Meta and Apure may have come and s=
ettled near the=20

Cataracts, marrying women of the tribe of the Atures. Such mixed marriages =
sometimes take=20

place in this zone, though they are more rare than in Canada, and in the wh=
ole of North America,=20

where hunters of European origin unite themselves with savages, assume thei=
r habits, and=20

sometimes acquire great political influence.  We took several skulls, the s=
keleton of a child of six=20

or seven years old, and two of full-grown men of the nation of the Atures, =
from the cavern of=20

Ataruipe. All these bones, partly painted red, partly varnished with odorif=
erous resins, were placed=20

in the baskets (mapires or canastos) which we have just=20


_
and dinner coats had taken their place.  But other things have disappeared =
from Great Britain=20

since war began, and Henry was doomed to walk the island vainly looking for=
 the famed foods of=20

old England. All through Italy and France, where onion soup and various pas=
tes were served to=20

us, Henry ate them, but in a fond hope that when we got to England he would=
 have some of the=20

"superior comestibles" which a true lover of Dickens had a right to expect.=
 The French were given=20

to ragouts and Latin translations of Mulligan stews, and braised veal smoth=
ered in onions and=20

carrots and a lot of staple and fancy green groceries, and these messed dis=
hes irritated Henry. He=20

is the kind of an old-fashioned man who likes to take his food straight. If=
 he eats onions, he=20

demands that they shall be called onions, or if they serve him carrots, he =
must know specifically=20

that he is eating carrots, and he wants his potatoes, mashed, baked, boiled=
, or fried and no=20

nonsense about it. Similarly he wants his veal served by itself, and when t=
hey bring him a smoking=20

brown casserole of browned vegetables, browned gravy and browned meat, he p=
okes his fork into=20

it, load of a mule; and as we knew the superstitious feelings of the Indian=
s in reference to the=20

remains of the dead after burial, we carefully enveloped the canastos in ma=
ts recently woven.=20

Unfortunately for us, the penetration of the Indians, and the extreme quick=
ness of their sense of=20

smelling, rendered all our precautions useless. Wherever we stopped, in the=
 missions of the=20

Caribbees, amid the Llanos, between Angostura and Nueva Barcelona, the nati=
ves assembled=20

round our mules to admire the monkeys which we had purchased at the Orinoco=
. These good=20

people had scarcely touched our baggage, when they announced the approachin=
g death of the=20

beast of burden that carried the dead. In vain we told them that they were =
deceived in their=20

conjectures; and that the baskets contained the bones of crocodiles and man=
atees; they persisted=20

in repeating that they smelt the resin that surrounded the skeletons, and t=
hat they were their old=20

relations. We were obliged to request that the monks would interpose their =
authority, to overcome=20

the aversion of the natives, and procure for us a change of mules.  One of =
the skulls, which we=20

took from the cavern of=20


_
"another cat mess," pushes it aside and asks for eatable food! So all over =
the continent he was=20

bragging about what he was going to do to "the roast beef of old England," =
and was getting ready=20

for Yorkshire pudding with it. It was sweet to hear Henry's honest bark at =
spaghetti and fish-

salads, bay deep-mouthed welcome to Sam Weller's "'am and weal pie," appear=
ed in the fine work=20

published by my old master, Blumenbach, on the varieties of the human speci=
es. The skeletons of=20

the Indians were lost on the coast of Africa, together with a considerable =
part of our collections, in=20

a shipwreck, in which perished our friend and fellow-traveller, Fray Juan G=
onzales, the young=20

monk of the order of Saint Francis.=20
