only approaching.  =E2=80=9CAfter midnight the continued flashing of the li=
ghtning was awfully grand, and a gale blew fiercely from the north and nort=
heast, _
meditated and carried out.  One thing the barber stipulated. Appearances mu=
st be somehow=20

saved, and (clever dog he was) he suggested to me how that could be done. T=
here were two=20

points in the political programme of the candidate which, John Shufflebotha=
m and his friends=20

contended a gentleman worthy of a vote ought to be prepared to support--one=
 was universal=20

suffrage, the other was vote by ballot. The barber said his men must be tol=
d that the candidate=20

would meet them at least half-way. If this were arranged, and he were paid =
100_l._, he would=20

recommend his friends to vote with him for the Liberal. I agreed, not that =
the candidate should=20

make these professions, but that somebody on his behalf should give that ex=
planation to=20

Shufflebotham and his immediate tail or circle.  I went back to the committ=
ee-room, and explained=20

to the attorney and agent how I proposed to act. They laughed outright as l=
ong as they could=20

afford time to laugh, which was not much; for minutes were precious, as my =
scheme required an=20

hour and a half, or perhaps two hours, for the working out. I went back to =
the barber, and arranged=20

that he should jump into a cab and run over the town, which was not large, =
and call his friends=20

together at the Pig and Whistle in Backstairs Street, to receive a communic=
ation from the Liberal=20

candidate.  I looked at my watch. It was then half-past twelve. The poll cl=
osed at four. There was a=20

train from the town of W---- to the town of B----, which started at 12:45. =
It would not take long to=20

cover that distance in a carriage drawn by the iron horse. There was a trai=
n returning from B---- to=20

W---- at 2 p.m. precisely. That would do. I also arranged that an orator wh=
o had been employed for=20

the purpose of addressing the political intellect of the free and independe=
nt electors of W----,=20

should attend the Pig and Whistle on behalf of our candidate, and make one =
of his smooth,=20

flowing, rapid, ornate addresses.  This gentleman could talk against time. =
He was to spout until he=20

had "the office" to shut up his limpid stream of talk.  The orator did his =
business first rate. From=20

what I recollect of that speech, I wonder that he deserted his title of bar=
rister-at-law, turned aside=20

from the ambition of wearing M.P. after his own name at some future date, a=
nd settled down, as=20

he did, into the secretary of some association having its location eastward=
 of the Royal Exchange.=20

Our hired barrister-at-law addressed the Shufflebotham circle as honest, no=
ble fellows, whose=20

adherence to principle was one of the most refreshing examples of political=
 determination he had=20

ever met in his life. He praised Shufflebotham as a man who had won an infl=
uence over his fellow-

men, which a tyrant might envy, but could never command, through a stern an=
d inflexible course=20

of honest industry spread over an ample term of existence. Shufflebotham he=
re turned a little red=20

in the face; some people thought him modest, and took that crimson to be a =
blush. No doubt it was=20

a blush, but whether of honesty or of shame I need not stay to point out.  =
After the orator had been=20

speaking for some time, my man returned, and I received an intimation of th=
at fact. The orator also=20

got a nod and a very slight wink from me, when he stated that he had been r=
equested to make an=20

explanation to them, but he felt somewhat exhausted by what he had already =
done, and he=20

therefore asked their permission to leave that explanation to be made by hi=
s friend Mr. Yellowly,=20

who sat by his side; and then, after a peroration, in which he talked a goo=
d deal about the moon,=20

and the stars, and the four winds of heaven, and the British Lion, and the =
flag that braved a=20

thousand years, and honest industry, he sat down amid such applause as I ha=
ve only heard at the=20

Pig and Whistle and in very large assemblies.  Mr. Yellowly, the attorney, =
rose, and said that he=20

regretted he had not the eloquence of his learned friend; also that, as he =
was a plain man of=20

business, he would address himself to the explanation he had to offer in ve=
ry few words. The fact=20



he was intrusted to announce, he hoped he might do in confidence; it was, t=
hat although our=20

candidate could not go so far as universal suffrage, that most honourable a=
nd enlightened=20

gentleman would go a long way in that direction, much longer than he even t=
hought it prudent to=20

express upon the hustings his intentions to go, lest he should excite the p=
rejudices of the middle=20

classes, and secure, by an indiscreet frankness, the return of their Tory a=
ntagonist. In reply to an=20

inquiry, Mr. Yellowly said he could not exactly tell how far the candidate =
would go in the extension=20

of the franchise, but no doubt he would go as far as they desired--say to t=
he admission within the=20

pale of the British constitution of the 2_l._ 10_s._ householders. As for t=
he ballot--that most=20

important political principle--the Liberal candidate would vote for such a =
shield being drawn over=20

the poor but honest elector.  Shufflebotham played his part well--the rasca=
l! He affected to be a=20

little doubtful unless the explanation was made in public. Mr. Yellowly str=
ongly appealed to the=20

common sense of his auditors not to peril the election just at this moment =
(when the Tories were=20

four ahead of the Liberals) by so indiscreet a demand. lives are definitely=
 reported to be lost, and=20

the moderate estimate of the numerous cases in which whole crews have been =
lost swells this=20

number to nearly five hundred; and if to this is added the loss of life on =
land, and the loss in the=20

earlier history of the cyclone, the grand total amounts to at least six hun=
dred lives.=E2=80=9D  Had the famed=20

Shah Jehan ever visited the West Indies, it is probable that he might have =
pronounced many of its=20

lovely islets fit rivals for that beautiful creation of his fancy, which bo=
re above the gateway:      =E2=80=9CIf=20

there be Paradise upon the earth,      This it is, this it is, this it is.=
=E2=80=9D  Among the loveliest groups are=20

the beautiful Virgin Isles, and loveliest of these is the famed island of S=
t. Thomas. A lofty mountain=20

girdles the island, leaving an opening between two hills into a wide oval h=
arbor, while the pretty=20

little town lies around the inner side of the port, sloping up the mountain=
 behind, the queen of a=20

vast natural amphitheater. Such a fine harbor has rendered St. Thomas almos=
t the mistress of=20

West Indian commerce; and one would not suspect, in looking at the sunny sl=
opes and green-clad=20

ranges around the azure harbor, that in this region is the birthplace of th=
e Storm King. Yet, not a=20

spot on earth has been more frequently visited by great cyclones.  One of t=
he most notable of its=20

visitations during this century occurred August 2, 1837. The barometer fell=
 rapidly during the=20

forenoon, and by noon the storm began. In a short time it increased to a tr=
emendous gale. At=20

about three o=E2=80=99clock, the wind suddenly ceased. In a few moments it =
blew from the other direction,=20

roaring and rolling black clouds before it, raising up immense sea-waves, c=
overing the island with=20

intense gloom. Six hours it blew, ever increasing. Tiles and slates whizzed=
 through the air, to be=20

shattered on the rocks or driven into timbers: great trees were whirled abo=
ut, often dashing away=20

houses that seemed about to weather the storm, while the terrible roar of t=
he wind was such that=20

even the crash of the thunder could hardly be distinguished. One authority =
tells us that the great=20

guns at the fort were blown through the air and tossed about the beach like=
 chaff! This must be=20

taken with allowance. It is more probable that the great guns on the beach =
were washed up from=20

the wrecks of some old pirate vessels or ships of war.  About 10 P.M. there=
 was a slight cessation=20

of the storm, and the people were congratulating themselves that the worst =
was over, when there=20

came a violent earthquake, which laid in ruins almost everything that was l=
eft. The wreck took fire=20

in two or three places: at once the hurricane began with renewed vigor: and=
 ere the wretched=20

people had fully comprehended the magnitude of the calamity, the whole ruin=
ed town was a sea of=20

flame. Buffeted by the wind, blinded by the smoke and the pelting spray whi=
rled up from the raging=20



sea, the people ran for the slopes of the hills: the light of the funeral p=
yre of their hopes and labors=20

rendering the gloom more horrible, and seeming to rival the gleams of Tarta=
rus.  Day broke at last.=20

The storm was gone. The earthquake staggered the miserable folk no longer. =
The warm and=20

brilliant sun of the West Indies smiled upon the scene. =E2=80=9CThe whole =
country round was strewn with=20

large trees, uprooted or snapped off, and all plantations were destroyed. I=
n the town the fire was=20

dying out, and it was only here and there that the ruins were still smoking=
. The hurricane had=20

swept away nearly all the wooden houses; those which had been lightly place=
d upon beams, just=20

above the soil, being carried off as they stood, while the larger ones, whi=
ch had resisted the=20

hurricane, were overturned in an instant by the earthquake. The whole town =
was strewn with=20

wrecks that told of the violence of the catastrophe. The port, so gay and a=
nimated the day before,=20

was dreary and deserted, a few masts here and there emerging from the water=
: while all along the=20

shore, and even upon the slope of the hills, were scattered wreckage and co=
rpses of sailors.=E2=80=9D=20

While we have noticed only the destruction wrought at  [Illustration: CYCLO=
NE, FIRE AND=20

EARTHQUAKE AT ST. THOMAS.]  St. Thomas, this storm was general throughout t=
he Antilles. In=20

the Bahamas, it was less violent, they lying on the outskirts of the storm.=
 Millions of dollars worth=20

of property--merchandise, vegetation, houses, and vessels--were destroyed, =
and thousands of=20

lives lost.  Thirty years later, St. Thomas again suffered from the combine=
d forces of storm and=20

earthquake; and the damage was greater, because the earthquake, with its se=
a-wave, came a few=20

days after the storm, as the work of restoration was well under way, and so=
 involved a second=20

prostration of the resources of the people. Moreover, the town had grown co=
nsiderably in thirty=20

years, and there was much more valuable property to damage. Fifteen large s=
teamers and many=20

smaller vessels were driven on the shore by the storm: while the sea-wave, =
a few days later, found=20

the port again filled with vessels of different nations. It overleaped the =
sentinel hills at the entrance=20

of the bay, and swept with tremendous force upon the city, drowning with it=
s terrible roar, the=20

despairing cry of the sailors; then suddenly retired with the=20


_
Shufflebotham was a little too particular and suspicious. He thought the ge=
ntleman, Mr. Yellowly,=20

was right. Shufflebotham said he did not want to be a dictator. He was sati=
sfied, if the others were.=20

I, at that moment, suggested that they had better not be long making up the=
ir minds, for it was now=20

a quarter past three o'clock, and the poll closed at four. It was then spee=
dily settled that=20

Shufflebotham and his men should, as a body, go up and vote for the Liberal=
 candidate.  Our chief=20

agent here dark abyss. The batteries of heavy guns at the entrance of the h=
arbor were swept=20

away. A few injured vessels wallowed on the waves, but most had been swallo=
wed up and left no=20

trace behind.  While there is always deep sympathy for those who suffer suc=
h calamities, yet it=20

must remain of the type bestowed upon sufferers in Arctic expeditions. The =
character of the=20

climate is well known, and the whole matter resolves itself into a question=
 of the risk one is willing=20

to run. There is no blind chance in=20


_
to have a band of music. He secretly determined to grace the final _coup_ b=
y a demonstration in=20

which three bands were to play their part. He also privately determined to =
bring Jem Smash, and=20

all his fighting men, and all the other hired ruffians, to guard our new co=
ntingent, in case the=20

enemy, suspecting a cyclone frequents only certain regions, and its habit a=
nd power is=20

understood. While we pity the sufferers, we can not assert that the scourge=
 is mysterious or=20

unaccountable, any more than we find mystery in the fact of eternal snow in=
 the Polar world.=20

 a short delay arose=20

am by himself, and to=20

let him have a taste of my quality and smartness, or perhaps I should rathe=
r say, whet his appetite=20

for that taste.  The barber led me outside to the yard of the Pig and Whist=
le, and addressing me,=20

inquired, "I suppose you have got the money all right?"  "Oh, yes," I repli=
ed.  "Will you give it us,=20

then?"  "No," I said; "I cannot do that until you and your men THE SAILORS.=
