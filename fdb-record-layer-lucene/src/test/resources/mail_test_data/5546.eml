ffly and began to=20

pull on his torn sweater, while the two Chinese watched him with fascinated=
 eyes.  "Why did you=20

bring me here?" he demanded. "Are you _crazy_, or what _is_ the matter with=
 you?"  The two=20

Chinese blinked at him vacantly; either they did not understand English or =
pretended not to.=20

Suddenly one of them got down on his knees and began a queer song-like jabb=
ering in which his=20

companion joined.  Teeny-bits did not wait to listen, but began to move tow=
ard the door; he=20

expected the men to jump in front of him and bar the way, but neither of th=
em stirred until he was=20

actually stepping out of the room. Teeny-bits ran stiffly down a dimly ligh=
ted flight of steps, then=20

down another flight and out into a dark alleyway. Behind him he could hear =
the soft of some,=20

tals being divisible=20

longitudinally. Some of them are five inches long, and half an inch diamete=
