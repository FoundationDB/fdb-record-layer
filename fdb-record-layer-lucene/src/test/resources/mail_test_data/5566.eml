dracaena marginata     CHAPTER III  THE COURSE OF THE SUN THROUGH THE TWELV=
E SIGNS   1. The sun, after entering the sign Aries and passing through one=
 eighth of it, determines the vernal equinox. On reaching the tail of Tauru=
s and the constellation of the Pleiades, from which the front half of Tauru=
s projects, he advances into a space greater than half the firmament, movin=

of the Pleiades, and, getting higher above the earth, settled this vital qu=
estion for himself? This had not interested us in the least till then; perh=

UGH THE TWELVE SIGNS   1. The sun, after entering the sign Aries and passin=
g through one eighth of it, determines the vernal equinox. On reaching the =
tail of Taurus and the constellation of the Pleiades, from which the front =
half of Taurus projects, he advances into a space greater than half the fir=
mament, moving toward the north. From Taurus he enters Gemini at the time o=
f the rising of the Pleiades, and, getting higher above the earth, settled =
this vital question for himself? This had not interested us in the least ti=
ll then; perhaps we had not even admitted the idea that a man who went out =
in all weathers in goloshes and slept under curtains could be in love.  "'H=
e is a good deal over forty and she is thirty,' the headmaster's wife went =
on, developing her idea. 'I believe she would marry him.'  "All sorts of th=
ings are done in the provinces through boredom, all sorts of unnecessary an=
d nonsensical things! And _
against her in the west, she is completely relieved by her still greater di=
stance from his rays, and=20

so, on the fourteenth day, she is at the full, and her entire disc emits it=
s light. On the succeeding=20

days, up to the end of the month, she wanes daily as she turns in her cours=
e, being recalled by the=20

sun until she comes under his disc and rays, thus completing the count of t=
he days of the month.=20

3. But Aristarchus of Samos, a mathematician of great powers, has left a di=
fferent explanation in=20

his teaching on this subject, as I shall now set forth. It is no secret tha=
t the moon has no light of=20

her own, but is, as it were, a mirror, receiving brightness from the influe=
nce of the sun. Of all the=20

seven stars, the moon traverses the shortest orbit, and her course is neare=
st to the earth. Hence=20

in every month, on the day before she gets past the sun, she is under his d=
isc and rays, and is=20

consequently hidden and invisible. When she is thus in conjunction with the=
 sun, she is called the=20

new moon. On the next day, reckoned as her second, she gets past the sun an=
d shows the thin=20

edge of her sphere. Three days away from the sun, she waxes and grows brigh=
ter. Removing=20

further every day till she reaches the seventh, when her distance from the =
sun at his setting is=20

about one half the extent of the firmament, one half of her is luminous: th=
at is, the half which faces=20

toward the sun is lighted up by him.  4. On the fourteenth day, being diame=
trically across the=20

whole extent of the firmament from the sun, she is at her full and rises wh=
en the sun is setting.=20

For, as she takes her place over against him and distant the whole extent o=
f the firmament, she=20

thus receives the light from the sun throughout her entire orb. On the seve=
nteenth got married."=20

Ivan Ivanovitch glanced quickly into the barn, and said:  "You are joking!"=
  "Yes, strange as it=20

seems, he almost got married. A new teacher of history and geography, Milha=
il Savvitch=20

Kovalenko, a Little Russian, was appointed. He came, not alone, but with hi=
s sister Varinka. He=20

was a tall, dark young man with huge hands, and one could see from his face=
 that he had a bass=20

voice, and, in fact, he had a voice that seemed to come out of a barrel--'b=
oom, boom, boom!' And=20

she was not so young, about thirty, but she, too, was tall, well-made, with=
 black eyebrows and red=20

cheeks--in fact, she was a regular sugar-plum, and so sprightly, so noisy; =
she was always singing=20

Little Russian songs and laughing. For the least thing she would go off int=
o a ringing laugh--'Ha-

ha-ha!' We made our first thorough acquaintance with the Kovalenkos at the =
headmaster's name-

day party. Among the glum and intensely bored teachers who came even to the=
 name-day party=20

as a duty we suddenly saw a new Aphrodite risen from the waves; she walked =
with her arms=20

akimbo, laughed, sang, danced.... She sang with feeling 'The Winds do Blow,=
' then another song,=20

and another, and she fascinated us all--all, even Byelikov. He sat down by =
her and said with a=20

honeyed smile:  "'The Little Russian reminds one of the ancient Greek in it=
s softness and=20

agreeable resonance.'  "That flattered her, and she began telling him with =
feeling and earnestness=20

that they had a farm in the Gadyatchsky district, and that her mamma lived =
at the farm, and that=20

they had such pears, such melons, such _kabaks_! The Little Russians call p=
umpkins _kabaks_=20

(i.e., pothouses), while their pothouses they call _shinki_, and they make =
a beetroot soup with=20

tomatoes and aubergines in it,=20


_
inclining to the west. On the twenty-second day, after sunrise, the moon is=
 about mid-heaven;=20

hence, the side exposed to the sun is bright and the rest dark. Continuing =
thus her daily course,=20

she passes under the rays of the sun on about the twenty-eighth day, and so=
 completes the=20

account of the month.  I will next explain how the sun, passing through a d=
ifferent sign each=20

month, causes the days and hours nice--awfully nice!'  "We listened and lis=
tened, and suddenly=20

the same idea dawned upon us all:  "'It would be a good thing to make a mat=
ch of it,' the=20

headmaster's wife said to me softly.  "We all for some reason recalled the =
fact that our friend=20

Byelikov was not married, and it now seemed to us strange that we had hithe=
rto failed to observe,=20

and had in fact completely lost sight of, a detail so important=20
