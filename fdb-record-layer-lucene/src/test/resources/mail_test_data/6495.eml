dracaena marginata whom the prior attachment of her heart had been contract=

I think this letter will help me to the solution of the whole mystery of th=
e case."  Again it appeared=20

to me that I must extricate the merchant and his wife from momentary diffic=
ulty by some action on=20

my part.  "I shall," I said, "keep this letter until next Monday, when, if =
you safe quarters. It is time to=20

act. =E2=80=9CNow, in the pitchy darkness of the night, with bowed head, an=
d faltering steps battling against=20

the storm, the old man leads a white horse along the edge of the cliff. To =
the tip of the horse=E2=80=99s tail=20

a lantern is tied, and the light sways with the=20


_
strictness, I must say I think I ought to read it at once, and, if I afterw=
ards see fit, hand it over to=20

the prisoner's attorney."  "I don't," said Mr. Green. "You must give it up =
to me."  His wife also=20

vehemently claimed it.  "With all respect to you, sir, and to you, madam, I=
 shall take the=20

responsibility of detaining it."  The husband, who all this while had been =
a prey to intensely painful=20

emotion, then desired his wife to leave us alone, saying that he would mana=
ge me; and, after=20

considerable hesitation, she did so. As she left the room I masthead light =
of a vessel rocked by the=20

motion of the sea. A whisper has gone through the village of a chance of so=
mething happening=20

during the night, and most of the men and many of the women are on the aler=
t, lurking in the=20

caves beneath the cliff, or sheltered behind jutting pieces of rock.  =E2=
=80=9CThe vessel makes in steadily=20

for the land; the captain grows uneasy, and fears running into danger; he w=
ill put the vessel round,=20

and try and battle his way out to sea.  =E2=80=9CThe look-out man reports a=
 dim light ahead. What kind?=20

and whither away? He can=20


_
countenance, the external signs of a mind racked with the agony of crime.  =
When she had left, I=20

took a chair, and Mr. Green did the same.  "This letter, sir," I said, "may=
 be an ordinary one,=20

containing nothing that can affect the unfortunate prisoner's case; and if =
so I shall be perfectly=20

prepared to hand it over to you at once; but I shall now ask, Yes, she must=
 be a vessel standing=20

on in the same course as that which they are on.  [Illustration: ON A LEE S=
HORE.]  It is all safe,=20

then; the captain will stand in a little longer; when suddenly, in the lull=
 of the storm, a hoarse=20

murmur is heard--surely the sound of the sea beating upon rocks! Yes! look!=
 a white gleam upon=20

the water! Breakers=20


_
if you please, as a matter of courtesy, to permit me to read it."  "A lette=
r of my wife's, sir!"  "Yes, a=20

letter of your wife's; and I can promise you no secrecy about its contents =
until I know what they=20

are. If these contents be not essential to the interests of the prisoner, a=
nd do rings through the=20

ship, =E2=80=98Down, down with the helm--round her to!=E2=80=99 Too late, t=
oo late! A crash, a shudder from stem to=20

stern of the stout ship, the shriek of many voices in their agony, green se=
as sweeping over the=20

vessel, and soon broken timbers, bales of cargo, and lifeless bodies=20


_
whatever be the secret this letter embodies, no living soul will get the le=
ast idea of that secret from=20

me. If, on the other hand, it will furnish a material link in the evidence =
of that unfortunate girl's=20

innocence, no considerations, no regard to the position, circumstances, or =
happiness of you, will=20

induce me to abstain from using it in a way to secure her liberation."  "I =
think you should let me=20

read it first," said the husband, in terror.  "You must allow me to reverse=
 the order of perusal. _I_=20

must read it first."  Mr. Green rose and paced the room. I sat musing, and =
torn still further to pieces=20

with each insweep of the mighty seas as they roll it to and fro among the r=
ocks. Fearful and crafty=20

the smile that darkened the face of the willing murderer who was leading th=
e horse with the false=20

light as he heard the crash of the vessel and the shrieks of the drowning c=
rew! Fearful the smile=20

that darkened the faces of the men and women waiting on the beach as they c=
ame out from their=20

places, ready to struggle and fight among themselves for any spoil that mig=
ht come ashore! A=20

homeward-bound ship from the Indies! Great good fortune--rich spoil!=20


_
last he turned, and said,  "I know I can rely upon your judgment sir." He s=
at down beside me. I=20

read the letter in tones loud enough for him to hear, but let no sentence o=
r word of it pass through=20

the keyhole of that drawing-room door.  We drew our chairs closer together =
as I read the letter. It=20

was addressed to the merchant's wife, in the dragged high upon the beach ou=
t of the way of the=20

surf. But, see! a sailor clinging to a bit of broken mast! With his last co=
nscious effort he gains a=20

footing on the shore, staggers forward, and falls. Is he alive? Not now! Wh=
y did that fearful old=20

woman kneel upon his chest and cover his mouth with her cloak? Dead men tel=
l no tales--claim no=20
