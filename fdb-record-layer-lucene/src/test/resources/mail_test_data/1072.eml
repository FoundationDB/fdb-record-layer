the authorities again asking for the document, for they had devised a new plan to overreach the 

Bishop.  They offered the Canon the keys of the church if he would accept them as curate, 

abandoning his character as Vicar-General of the Bishop, promising him a generous salary and 

other advantages if he would agree.  The Canon did not agree but reported the situation faithfully 

to Las Casas, who thus learned that his spiritual subjects were in open rebellion against his 

authority.  The Audiencia had ended by agreeing to send an auditor to Ciudad Real to see that the 

New Laws were executed, and a gentleman of Santiago de Nicaragua wrote the news of this 

decision to the Council saying, "The Bishop is returning to this country to complete the destruction 

of this unhappy city, bringing with him an auditor to still further tax the country.  We don't know 

how it is that your lordships do not remedy such great evils."  An open council was held on 

December 15, 1545, which was attended by all the householders of the town, and upon opening 

the sitting, the secretary called attention to the fact that the Bishop had been exercising his 

episcopal authority without having shown the required papal bulls or royal cedulas to the Council; 

moreover he had introduced novel doctrines, reserving certain cases for absolution, concerning 

which, the Emperor's final decision had not yet been received in reply to the petition addressed to 

His Majesty; as it was evident to them all that the Bishop's ideas, if acceded to by the colonists 

would result in the total ruin of them all and a general rebellion of the Indians, it was incumbent 

upon them to notify the Bishop that he must follow the example of other bishops in the colonies, 

abandoning his novelties until the return of the procurator, who had been sent to Spain to present 

the colonists' appeal on these matters, when the Emperor's decision would be made known; any 

disturbances which might arise from the present unsettled state of feeling must be laid to the 

Bishop's charge.  These sentiments encountered general approval, and it was unanimously 

decided that should Las Casas refuse to acquiesce in them, they would refuse to receive him as 

their lawful bishop and would suppress his tithes. This last decision was published and a fine of 

one hundred castellanos imposed on any one violating it.  Fray Tomas de la Torre learned of 

these decisions and sent from Cinacatlan, where he then was, to warn a lay brother, Fray Pedro 

Martin, and a servant of the Bishop who were in Cuidad Real, and to advise them to put the 

Bishop's books and household goods in a place of safety, for he feared that in the excitement, 

popular resentment might burst all bounds and everything belonging to Las Casas might be 

destroyed.  His warning was not unwarranted, for the two men were obliged to fortify themselves 

as best they could in the sacristy of the church, where they were attacked at midnight by a body of 

men, who were determined to expel them from the town.  After besieging them in vain for some 

time, the attacking party left, intending to return by daylight, but the besieged took advantage of 

their absence to escape and managed to reach Cinacatlan barefoot, where their account of the 

state of things in the town greatly increased the anxiety of the friars.  While these turbulent events 

were happening, Las Casas had arrived at the Dominican monastery at Copanabastla on his way 

to Ciudad Real, where it was his intention to celebrate Christmas in his cathedral; he took the 

precaution of sending a trusty messenger ahead, who brought back a full account of the decisions 

of the Council and the preparations for resisting the Bishop's entrance.  On his way back to 

Copanabastla this messenger passed by Cinacatlan and told the friars of the Bishop's 

whereabouts, so they also wrote him full information of all that had happened and the kind of 

reception awaiting him in the city.  The citizens of Ciudad Real were also kept informed of the 



Bishop's approach and, with unswerving resolution, began to take their measures to stop his 

advance unless he accepted their conditions; pickets were established at different points of the 

road to give warning of his approach.  Singular indeed was the activity displayed in arming as 

large a force of men as could be mustered, to oppose this aged monk who, like his apostolic 

forebears, came alone, on foot, with a staff in his hand and neither purse nor scrip. Although there 

were not wanting those among the friars who Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help

get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the

per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as 

we release over 100 new text files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+ We 

are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002 If they reach just 1-2% of the 

world's population then the total will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

to follow their advice, saying: "If I do not go to Ciudad Real, I banish myself voluntarily from my 

own church and it may be said of me, with reason, the wicked fleeth, when no man pursueth.  How 

do we know that they want to kill me and that the sentinels are placed for this express purpose?  I 

do not doubt the truth of what the fathers at Cinacatlan say, but there are our Lord's words to his 

disciples when they sought to deter him from returning to Judea, because they [the Jews] had 

sought to kill him the day before.  The day has twelve hours, in each one of which, or in each 

minute or in each instant, the minds of men may change.  If I do not enter into my church, of whom 

may I complain to the King and the Pope for putting me out of it?"  The Bishop's serenity was as 

perfect as his resolution was unchangeable, and, gathering his scapular in his hand, he rose from 

his chair and set out on his journey, amidst the tears and remonstrances of the friars. Upon 

reaching the first post of sentinels he found the men off their guard, as a report had spread that he 

had abandoned his intention to advance.  The Indians, when they recognised him, completely 

forgot the orders they had received from their Spanish masters, and in mingled joy at seeing their 

beloved Bishop again and distress at being there under such duty, they threw themselves at his 

feet, weeping, protesting, and imploring his forgiveness for their compulsory part in opposing 

him.(63) Knowing that the poor creatures would pay dearly for their neglect of orders, Las Casas 

had them bound, as though he had surprised and captured them.  That night Ciudad Real was 

shaken by a terrible earthquake which drove the frightened people into the public square.  Talking 

amongst themselves, some declared that this upheaval heralded the Bishop's approach and was 

the beginning of the destruction he would bring upon their town.      CHAPTER XIX. -

MEXICAN SYNOD   At dawn Las Casas entered the city unnoticed and reached his cathedral, 

from whence he sent Father Nicola Galiano, one of the clergy, to notify the Council of his arrival 

and that he was awaiting them.  The Bishop's arrival, did in reality, cause a greater disturbance 

than the earthquake. The members of the Council debated as to what was now to be done; the 

Bishop was in the city and in his cathedral, despite their efforts to exclude him.  Finally it was 

decided to go in a body to the church, where they seated themselves as though for a sermon. 

When the Bishop entered from the sacristy to speak to them, no one rose or showed any of the 

customary marks of respect.   The notary immediately read the "requirement" it had been their 

intention to present before Las Casas was admitted to the city, omitting however the passages 

which denied his authority.  Las Casas replied to this with great benevolence, efforts to identify, 

transcribe and proofread public domain works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any 

medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other things, Defects may take the form of

ready even to shed his blood for them, he had no intention of interfering with their properties 

except in so far as was necessary to prevent sin against God and their neighbour: he exhorted 

them to consider matters calmly and not to allow themselves to be carried away by irreflection. His 

manner, as well as the sense of this speech, were surprisingly conciliatory, but one of the council, 

less impressed by the persuasive eloquence of the Bishop, observed from his place that as Las

important body as the council, composed of the most illustrious gentlemen of the colony, to come 

to meet him, instead of going himself to them.  The Bishop, with much dignity, answered; "Look
