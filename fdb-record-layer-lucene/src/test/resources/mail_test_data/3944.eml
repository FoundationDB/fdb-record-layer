of scurvy. For the first he was put upon short rations; for the second, san=
d baths on shore were=20

prescribed. Under this treatment poor "Jeff" lost all his buoyancy of spiri=
ts and his habitual=20

friskiness, and became sad and dejected, but bore his troubles with patienc=
e. He took to the sand=20

baths at once,  "I see," she observed. "And you've never said a word?"  "No=
t a word."  "If I were=20

you I should still keep perfectly silent about it," she almost whispered pe=
rsuasively. "It'll be just as=20

well. If I were you, I shouldn't worry myself. I can quite understand how i=
t happened, and I'm glad=20

you've told me.=20


_
disgruntled grunts when lifted out of them.  The last time I saw "Jeff," in=
 1862, he was buried up to=20

his ears in the cool sands of the Roanoke Island shore, with eyes upturned =
and looking like a very=20

sad pig, but I fear none the wiser for his offenses against the rights of a=
 well-regulated digestion.=20

THE IMPUDENT GUINEA-PIG  By Charles F. Lummis  No other creature is so abso=
lutely graceful=20

as a rattlesnake, and none more gentle in intention. It is only against imp=
osition that he protests.=20

Our forefathers had learned a not unworthy lesson from their contact with n=
ature in the New World=20

when they put upon the first flag of the colonies a rattlesnake, with the L=
atin legend, _Nemo me=20

impune lacessit_--"No one wounds me with impunity." The flag of independenc=
e, however, only=20

half told the real meaning of its these last two or three days. I thought i=
t was about my money=20

business, but I see it wasn't. At least that may have brought it on, like. =
Now the best thing you can=20

do is to forget it."  She did not believe him! She simply discredited the w=
hole story; and, told in=20

Werter Road, like that, the story did sound fantastic; it did come very nea=
r to passing belief. She=20

had always noticed a certain queerness in her husband. His sudden gaieties =
about a tint in the sky=20

or the gesture of a horse in the street, for example, were most uncanny. An=
d he had peculiar=20

absences of mind that she could never account for. She was sure that he mus=
t have been a very=20

bad valet. However, she did not marry him for a valet, but for a husband; a=
nd she was satisfied=20

with her bargain. What if he did suffer under a delusion? The exposure of t=
hat=20


_
device, to my notion, much more expressive: a rattlesnake rampant, with the=
 Spanish motto, _Ni=20

huyes ni persigues_--"Thou needst not flee, but thou must not pursue." Or, =
in other words, "I=20

impose upon no one; no one must impose upon me." That is the real meaning o=
f the rattlesnake,=20

as any one can testify who knows him well.  I chanced one day to enter the =
market in Los Angeles,=20

and was surprised to find in one of the stalls a large collection of rattle=
snakes, mostly brought in=20

from the Mojave desert. It was the first time I had ever suspicions concern=
ing his mentality.=20

Besides, it was a harmless delusion. And it explained things. It explained,=
 among other things, why=20

he had gone to stay at the Grand Babylon Hotel. That must have been the inc=
eption of the=20

delusion. She was glad to know the worst.  She adored him more than ever.  =
There was a silence.=20

"No," she repeated, in the most matter-of-fact tone, "I should say nothing,=
 in your place. I should=20

forget it."  "You would?" He drummed on the table.  "I should! And whatever=
 you do, don't worry."=20

Her accents were=20


_
city market; and as they went at the very reasonable figure of fifty cents =
apiece, I promptly=20

purchased a pair. The dealer, with a noose of cord, lassoed the two I indic=
ated, and after some=20

maneuvering got them stowed in two large cigar boxes, which he tied up tigh=
tly. Reaching home=20

coaxing accents of a nurse with a child--or with a lunatic.  He perceived n=
ow with the utmost=20

clearness that she did not believe a word of what he had said, and that in =
her magnificent and=20

calm sagacity she was only trying to humour him. He had expected to disturb=
 her soul to its=20


_
roomy cage with wire-screen in front and a sliding door on top, and transfe=
rred them to it without=20

much difficulty. One was a strong, handsome fellow five feet long and with =
fifteen rattles; the other=20

was about three feet in length and had an ordinary "string."  The dealer to=
ld me they had eaten=20

nothing in six months; and fancying it must be about lunch-time with them, =
I went down-town, as=20

soon as they were comfortably settled in the new quarters, to get them food=
. A rattler, you know,=20

will touch no dead meat, so I the night discussing the situation. And lo!--=
"I should forget it,"=20

indulgently! And a mild continuance of darning!  He had to think, and think=
 hard.   _Tears_=20

"Henry," she called out the next morning, as he disappeared up the stairs. =
"What _are_ you doing=20

up there?"  She had behaved exactly as if nothing had happened; and she was=
 one of those=20

women whose prudent policy it is to let their men alone even to the furthes=
t limit of patience; but=20

she had nerves, too, and they were being affected. For three days Henry had=
