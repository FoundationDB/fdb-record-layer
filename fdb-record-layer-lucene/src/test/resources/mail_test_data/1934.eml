philodendron monstera are preserved in the struggle with the elements, and amid so many sufferings and dangers. When the waters retire, and the rivers return again into their beds, the savannah is overspread with a beautiful scented grass; and the animals of Europe and Upper philodendron monstera are preserved in the struggle with the elements, and amid so many sufferings and dangers. When the waters retire, and the rivers return again into their beds, the savannah is overspread with a beautiful scented grass; and the animals of Europe and Upper _
which had been temporarily cleared of some of its furniture. The Tarantella dancers, who were 

accustomed to give their small exhibition to visitors, brought their own orchestra with them, a thin 

youth who played the violin, a stout individual who plucked the mandolin, and an enthusiast who 

twanged the guitar. The performers were charmingly dressed in the old native costumes of the 

country, the men in soft white shirts, green sleeveless velvet coats, red plush knickers, silk 

stockings and shoes with scarlet bows, while the girls wore gay skirts, striped sashes, lace fichus, 

and aprons, and gold beads round their shapely throats. They danced several sprightly measures, 

waving tambourines and rattling castanets, or twining silk scarves together, while the musicians 

fiddled and strummed their hardest; then six of them stood fisheries; and when fish are wanting, 

feeds on seaweed. The ass and the horse, originally natives of the cold and barren plains of Upper 

Asia, follow man to the New World, return to the wild state, and lead a restless and weary life in 

the burning climates of the tropics. Pressed alternately by excess of drought and of humidity, they 

sometimes seek a pool in the midst of a bare and dusty plain, to quench their thirst; and at other 

times flee from water, and the overflowing rivers, as menaced by an enemy that threatens them on 

all sides. Tormented during the day by gadflies and mosquitos, the horses, mules, and cows find 

themselves attacked at night by enormous bats, which fasten on their backs, and cause wounds 

that become dangerous, because they are filled with acaridae and other hurtful insects. In the time

"Romeo" sang an impassioned love song, with his hand on his heart, while "Juliette" plucked at 

her apron and appeared doubtful of the truth of his protestations. Then the "funny man" had his 

innings. He sat in a chair with a shoe in his hand and tried to smack the head of a humorist who 

knelt in front but always managed neatly to avoid his blows, the whole being punctuated by 

vigorous exclamations in Italian, and order to imbibe its cooling juice, and draw it forth as from a 

vegetable fountain. (* The asses are particularly adroit in extracting the moisture contained in the 

Cactus melocatus. They push aside the thorns with their hoofs; but sometimes lame themselves in 

performing this feat.) During the great inundations these same animals lead an amphibious life, 

surrounded by crocodiles, water-serpents, and manatees. Yet,
