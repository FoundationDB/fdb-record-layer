he so drew his chair by her side, he actually took her lean and withered ha=

me all about it, Goody. In what way have you wronged me? In what deceived m=
e? In what respect=20

acted as a poor woman should not?"  "Well, doctor," she stammered, in reply=
 to this kind and=20

confidential inquiry, "indeed I have a fortune."  The doctor started.  "Pra=
y don't expose me. I shall=20

die if I am found out. Kill me, doctor, if you won't forgive me."  "A fortu=
ne! and you for so long have=20

been living on charity; obtaining relief and medical attendance from the un=

Throughout all the lowland districts are hundreds of farms and valuable pla=
ntations, the soil being=20

built up by  [Illustration: STRUGGLE TO HOLD THE LEVEE.]  ages of alluvial =
deposits. Most of=20

the towns are built on high ground; there being a few notable exceptions. A=
 general flood in this=20

valley means that millions of acres of land are submerged, and such crops a=
s are in the fields are=20

destroyed. More frequently, the land is flooded just at planting time, and =
the land remains wet too=20

long to allow certain crops to be planted in season. Thus, the water in the=
 flooded districts may=20

abate in time to allow a fair cotton crop; while the chance for corn is los=
t. Fences and small=20

outbuildings are floated away, and often large numbers of stock are drowned=
; but, after, all, the=20

 bread and his family's=20

bread by the sufferance of a Christian usurer, who had obtained judgments a=
gainst him on bills of=20

exchange, and who extracted, as the price of what he called forbearance, en=
ormous interest and=20

costs for a disreputable attorney, who (let me say in confidence) I have re=
ason to know divided=20

them with his client. The bitter poverty of the man was his strong temptati=
on.  "Could I manage to=20

get this woman's property into my hands?" he asked himself.  "No!" was the =
answer of his=20

conscience.  "It would be an enormous blessing to me if I could get a littl=
e money just now, and=20

pay off that infernal Tompkins, who threatens and harasses my life destruct=
ion. Further, the=20

retiring water leaves numerous pools and marshes that are rank breeders of =
malaria, adding vastly=20

to the unhealthiness of the country.  In many places there are marshy or ti=
mbered tracts adjacent=20

to the river that are not available for cultivation. In these districts the=
 levees are often erected at=20

the border of the cultivable land, so that the river has a large area of wa=
ste land over which to=20

spread the surplus water without doing any injury. Such areas really aid to=
 reduce the high-water=20

level. In some cases, a second or third levee is built some hundreds of yar=
ds to the rear, to serve=20

as a sort of reserve, in case the river break through the first.  Doubtless=
 the reader has pictured to=20

g till the moment I=20

rbs my sleep. If I could=20

get the use of the money, I would repay it. To wrong this wretched pauper w=
ould be a crime I am=20

incapable of; but to use the money of the old sinner for a while, and make =
it up again, would do=20

nobody any harm. I will try if I can get it."  Such was the train of though=
t, interrogation, and reply,=20

and of resolution, which passed through the mind of the doctor, with more r=
apidity than it has=20

passed under the eye of the reader.  "My good woman, as you say, you have a=
cted very=20

wrongfully, not alone towards me; but you have, in that respect, something =
like a stream in a=20

mountain gorge; an immense torrent of water rushing at race-horse speed, up=
rooting trees, tearing=20

away huge boulders, sweeping away houses in an instant, without a moment=E2=

drowning young and old by scores. If such be his idea, he will find it nece=
ssary to remodel it; or,=20

rather, to cast it away entirely. Let him follow a guide to the scene of da=
nger. A great levee, the=20

protection of thousands of acres of rich lands, and perhaps millions of dol=
lars worth of property, is=20

announced unsafe. Sometimes it is decided to abandon the river line, weaken=

distances, and erect a new levee some hundreds of yards to the rear.  But i=
