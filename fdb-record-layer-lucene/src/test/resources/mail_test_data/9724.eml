on the eastern side of the island. With these natural advantages, and those=
 are not few that still remain to be enumerated, the commerce of this count=

incident is the continual subterranean roaring heard for a considerable per=
iod over twenty-three hundred square miles of Northern Venezuela, a number =
of years ago, during a violent outpour of lava from the volcano of St. Vinc=

his would raise the question as to why the same noise was not audible at po=
ints nearer to St. Vincent? Another suggestion is that the source from whic=
h the lava of St. Vincent was derived lay beneath Northern Venezuela; and a=
 fact brought in support of this is, that the great earthquake of Caracas w=
as immediately followed by action at St. Vincent. Similarly, the great erup=
tion of Cotopaxi, in 1744, was attended by subterranean rumbling at Honda, =
four hundred and thirty-six miles away, and eighteen thousand and one hundr=

opayan, with countless valleys and ravines.  The cone of Cotopaxi is the sm=
oothest and most symmetrical in the world; perhaps because its eruptions ar=

"And mony jobs that day begun,                 Will end in houghmagandie." =
[56]   Thus they unsettle=20

and disturb the course of their labours by calling off their attention from=
 their domestic cares; and=20

by continually offering occasions of dissipation destroy what little spirit=
 of economy or foresight=20

may exist amongst so rude and ignorant a people. Nor is this all; they are =
subject to numerous=20

other vexations and impositions under the title of church-services; such ar=
e, in some towns, five or=20

six men attendant daily in rotation to bring the sick to the church to conf=
ess, or to carry the "Padre"=20

with the host to their houses, and many others; all of which, though in the=
mselves trifles, are more=20

harassing, from their unsettling tendency, than pecuniary imposts. An encou=
ragement to celibacy=20

and its consequent evils is also to be found in the (to them) heavy expense=
s attendant on all the=20

domestic offices of religion, as matrimony, baptism, &c., as well as in the=
 increase of the poll-tax=20

on married persons, for the whole of which the husband is responsible. The =
ecclesiastical=20

expenses of a marriage between the poorer classes are about five dollars: t=
he others, as=20

christenings, buryings, &c., in proportion. These appear trifles; but if to=
 these are added the=20

confessions, bulas, [i.e., of the Crusade] and other exactions, it will be =
seen that these constitute=20

no trifling part of the oppressive and ill managed system which has so much=
 contributed to debase=20

their real character.  I say nothing here of the natural effect of the Roma=
n Catholic religion on an=20

ignorant people, who imagine, that verbal confession and pecuniary atonemen=
ts (rarely to the=20

injured person) are a salvo for crimes of all magnitudes: that such is the =
case, is notorious to every=20

one who has visited Catholic countries.  Let us for a moment retrace this p=
icture. To whom after=20

this is it attributable that the Indian is often a vicious and degraded bei=
ng, particularly in the=20

neighborhood of Manila?  If he sees all around him thieving and enjoying th=
eir plunder with=20

impunity, what wonder is it that he should thieve also? If his tribunals of=
 all descriptions afford him=20

no redress, or place that redress beyond his reach, what resource has he bu=
t private revenge?=20

[57] If he cannot enjoy the fruits of his labour in peace, why should he wo=
rk? If he is ignorant, why=20

has he not been instructed? There exist scarcely any schools to teach him h=
is duties: the few that=20

do exist teach him Latin! prayers! theology! jurisprudence! and some little=
 reading and writing; [58]=20

but he is only taught to read the lives of the saints, and the legends of t=
he church, whose gloomy,=20

fanatical doctrines and sanguinary histories have not a little contributed =
to make him at times=20

revengeful and intolerant. Does he prevaricate and flatter? It is because h=
e dare not speak the=20

truth, and because a long system of oppression has broken his spirit.  Does=
 he endeavour to=20

advance himself a few steps in civilization? his attempts are treated with =
ridicule and contempt;=20

[59] hence he becomes apathetic, careless of advancement, and often insensi=
ble to reproach. The=20

best epithets he hears from Spaniards (often as ignorant as himself) are "I=
ndio!" The God of=20

nature made him so. "Bruto!" He has been and is brutalized by his masters. =
"Barbaro!" He is often=20

so by force, example, or even by precept. "Ignorante!" He has no means of l=
earning; the will is not=20

wanting. In a word, the spirit of the followers of Cortes and Pizarro, appe=
ars to have left its last=20

vestiges here, and perhaps the Indian has been saved from its persecutions =
only by the weakness=20

of the Spaniard.  Such are some of the causes which have marked the charact=
er of the Indian,=20

which is not naturally bad, with some of its prominent blemishes. I am far =
from holding up the=20

Indian of the Phillippines as a faultless being; he is not so; the Indian o=
f Manila [60] has all the=20

vices attributed to him; but I assert, that the Phillippine islander owes t=
he greater part of his vices=20

to example, to oppression, and above all to misgovernment; and that his cha=
racter has traits,=20



which under a different system, would have produced a widely different resu=
lt.  To sum up his=20

character:--He is brave, tolerably faithful, extremely sensible to kind tre=
atment, and feelingly alive=20

to injustice or contempt; proud of ancestry, which some of them carry to a =
remote epoch; fond of=20

dress and show, hunting, riding, and other field exercises; but prone to ga=
mbling and dissipation.=20

He is active, industrious, and remarkably ingenious. He possesses an acute =
ear, and a good taste=20

for music and painting, but little inclination for abstruse studies. He has=
 from nature excellent=20

talents, but these are useless for want of instruction. The little he has r=
eceived, has rendered him=20

fanatical in religious opinions; and long contempt and hopeless misery has =
mingled with his=20

character a degree of apathy, which nothing but an entire change of system =
and long=20

perseverance will efface from it. [61]  The Mestizos are the next class of =
men who inhabit these=20

islands: under this name are not only included the descendants of Spaniards=
 by Indian women=20

and their progeny, but also those of the Chinese, who are in general whiter=
 than either parent, and=20

carefully distinguish themselves from the Indians. The Mestizos are, as the=
 name denotes, a=20

mixed class, and, with the creoles of the country, like those of all coloni=
es, when uncorrected by=20

an European education, inherit the vices of both progenitors, with but few =
of the virtues of either.=20

Their character has but few marked traits; the principal ones are their van=
ity, industry, and trading=20

ingenuity: as to the rest, money is their god; to obtain it they take all s=
hapes, promise and betray,=20

submit to everything, trample and are trampled on; all is alike to them, if=
 they get money; and this,=20

when obtained, they dissipate in lawsuits, firing cannon, fireworks, illumi=
nations, processions on=20

feast days and rejoicings, in gifts to the churches, or in gambling. This a=
nomaly of actions is the=20

business of their lives. Too proud to consider themselves as Indians, and n=
ot sufficiently pure in=20

blood to be acknowledged as Spaniards, they affect the manners of the last,=
 with the dress of the=20

first, and despising, are despised by both. [62] They however, cautiously m=
ark on all occasions the=20

lines which separate them from the Indians, and have their own processions,=
 ceremonies, inferior=20

officers of justice, &c., &c. The Indian repays them with a keen contempt, =
not unmixed with hatred.=20

And these feuds, while they contribute to the safety of a government too im=
becile and corrupt to=20

unite the good wishes of all classes, have not unfrequently given rise to a=
ffrays which have=20

polluted even the churches and their altars with blood.  Such are the three=
 great classes of men=20

which may be considered as natives of the Phillippine Islands. The Creole [=
63] Spaniards, or those=20

whose blood is but little mingled with the Indian ancestry, pass as Spaniar=
ds. Many of them are=20

respectable merchants and men of large property; while others, from causes =
which will be seen=20

hereafter, are sunk in all the vices of the Indian and Mestizo.  The govern=
ment of the Phillippine=20

Islands is composed of a governor, who has the title of Captain General, wi=
th very extensive=20

powers; a Teniente Rey, or Lieutenant Governor; the Audiencia or Supreme Co=
urt, who are also=20

the Council. This tribunal is composed of three judges, the chief of whom h=
as the title of Regent,=20

and two Fiscals or Attorney Generals, the one on the part of the king, the =
other on that of the=20

natives, and this last has the specious title of "Defensor de los Indios." =
The financial affairs are=20

under the direction of an Intendant, who may be called a financial governor=
. He has the entire=20

control and administration of all matters relative to the revenue, the civi=
l and military auditors and=20

accountants being under him. Commercial affairs are decided by the Consulad=
o, or chamber of=20

commerce, composed of all the principal, and, in Manila, some of the inferi=
or merchants. From this=20

is an appeal to a tribunal "de Alzada" [i.e., of appeal] composed of one ju=
dge and two merchants,=20



and from this to the Audiencia, without whose approbation no sentence is va=
lid.  The civic=20

administration is confided to the Ayuntamiento (Courts of Aldermen or Munic=
ipality). This body,=20

composed of the two Alcaldes, twelve Regidors (or Aldermen) and a Syndic, e=
njoy very extensive=20

privileges, approaching those of Houses of Assembly; their powers, however,=
 appear more=20

confined to remonstrances and protests, representations against what they c=
onceive arbitrary or=20

erroneous in government, or recommendations of measures suggested either by=
 themselves or=20

others. They have, in general, well answered the object of their institutio=
n as a barrier against the=20

encroachments of government, and as a permanent body for reference in cases=
 where local=20

knowledge was necessary, which last deficiency they well supply.  The civil=
 power and police are=20

lodged in the hands of a Corregidor and two Alcaldes: the decision of these=
 is final in cases of civil=20

suits, where the value in question is small, 100 dollars being about the ma=
ximum. [64] Their=20

criminal jurisdiction extends only to slight fines and corporal punishments=
, and imprisonment=20

preparatory to trial. The police is confided to the care of the Corregidor,=
 who has more extensive=20

powers, and also the inspection and control of the prisons.  To him are als=
o subject the Indian=20

Captains and Officers of towns, who are annually elected by the natives. Th=
ese settle small=20

differences, answer for disturbances in their villages, execute police orde=
rs, impose small=20

contributions of money or labour for local objects, such as repairs of road=
s, &c. &c. They also have=20

the power of inflicting slight punishments on the refractory. To them is al=
so confided the collection=20

of the capitation or poll-tax, which is done by dividing the population of =
the town or village into=20

tens, each of which has a Cabea (or head), who is exempt from tribute himse=
lf, but answerable for=20

the amount of the ten under him. This tax is then paid to the Alcalde or Co=
rregidor, and from him=20

to the treasury. The Mestizos and Chinese have also their captains and head=
s, who are equally=20

answerable for the poll-tax.  The different districts and islands, which ar=
e called provinces, and are=20

29 in number, are governed by Alcaldes. The more troublesome ones, or those=
 requiring a military=20

form of government, by military officers, who are also Corregidors. Samboan=
gan on the south west=20

coast of Mindanao, and the Marianas, have governors named from Manila, and =
these are=20

continued from three to five years in office.  These Alcaldeships are a fer=
tile source of abuses and=20

oppression: their pay is mean to the last degree, not exceeding 350 dollars=
 per annum, and a=20

trifling per centage on the poll-tax. They are in general held by Spaniards=
 of the lower classes,=20

who finding no possible resource in Manila, solicit an Alcadeship. This is =
easily obtained, on giving=20

the securities required by government for admission to these offices, which=
 consist in two sureties=20

[65] to an amount proportionable to the value of the taxes of the province,=
 which all pass through=20

the Alcalde's hands.  Of the nature and amount of these abuses an idea will=
 be better formed from=20

the following abridged quotations, which are translated from the work of Co=
myn before quoted (p.=20

16). [66]  "It is indeed common enough to see the barber or lacquey of a go=
vernor, or a common=20

sailor, transformed at once into the Alcalde in chief of a populous provinc=
e, without any other=20

guide or council than his own boisterous passions.  "Without examining the =
inconvenience which=20

may arise from their ignorance, it is yet more lamentable to observe the co=
nsequences of their=20

rapacious avarice, which government tacitly allows them to indulge, under t=
he specious title of=20

permissions to trade (indultos).  ----"and these are such that it may be as=
serted, that the evil which=20

the Indian feels most severely is derived from the very source which was or=
iginally intended for his=20

assistance and protection, that is, from the Alcaldes of the provinces, who=
, generally speaking, are=20



the determined enemies and the real oppressors of their industry.  "It is a=
 well known fact, that far=20

from promoting the felicity of the provinces to which he is appointed, the =
Alcalde is exclusively=20

occupied with advancing his private fortune, without being very scrupulous =
as to the means he=20

employs to do so: hardly is he in office than he declares himself the princ=
ipal consumer, buyer,=20

and exporter of every production of the province. In all his enterprises he=
 requires the forced=20

assistance of his subjects, and if he condescends to pay them, it is at lea=
st only at the price paid=20

for the royal works. These miserable beings carry their produce and manufac=
tures to him, who=20

directly or indirectly has fixed an arbitrary price for them. To offer that=
 price is to prohibit any other=20

from being offered--to insinuate is to command--the Indian dares not hesita=
te--he must please the=20

Alcalde, or submit to his persecution: and thus, free from all rivalry in h=
is trade, being the only=20

Spaniard in the province, the Alcalde gives the law without fear or even ri=
sk, that a denunciation of=20

his tyranny should reach the seat of government.  "To enable us to form a m=
ore correct idea of=20

these iniquitous proceedings, let us lift a little of the veil with which t=
hey are covered, and examine=20

a little their method of collecting the 'tributo' (poll-tax).  "The governm=
ent, desirous of conciliating=20

the interests of the natives with that of the revenue, has in many instance=
s commuted the payment=20

of the poll-tax into a contribution in produce or manufactures: a year of s=
carcity arrives, and this=20

contribution, being then of much higher value than the amount of the tax, a=
nd consequently the=20

payment in produce a loss, and even occasioning a serious want in their fam=
ilies, they implore the=20

Alcalde to make a representation to government that they may be allowed to =
pay the tribute for=20

that year in money. This is exactly one of those opportunities, when, found=
ing his profits on the=20

misery of his people, the Alcalde can in the most unjust manner abuse the p=
ower confided to him.=20

He pays no attention to their representations. He is the zealous collector =
of the royal revenues;--he=20

issues proclamations and edicts, and these are followed by his armed satell=
ites, who seize on the=20

harvests, exacting inexorably the tribute, until nothing more is to be obta=
ined. Having thus made=20

himself master of the miserable subsistence of his subjects, he changes his=
 tone on a sudden--he=20

is the humble suppliant to government in behalf of the unfortunate Indians,=
 whose wants he=20

describes in the most pathetic terms, urging the impossibility of their pay=
ing the tribute in produce--

no difficulty is experienced in procuring permission for it to be paid in m=
oney--to save appearance,=20

a small portion of it is collected in cash, and the whole amount paid by hi=
m into the treasury, while=20

he resells at an enormous profit, the whole of the produce (generally rice)=
 which has been before=20

collected!" Comyn, p. 134 to 138.  This extract, though long, is introduced=
 as an evidence from a=20

Spaniard (not of the lower order, or a disappointed adventurer, but a man o=
f high respectability), of=20

the shameless abuses which are daily practiced in this unfortunate country,=
 and of which the=20

Indian is invariably the victim: and it is far from being an overcharged on=
e. Hundreds of other=20

instances might be cited, [67] but this one will perhaps suffice to exonera=
te the writer of these=20

remarks from suspicion of exaggeration, in pointing out some of the most pr=
ominent of them.=20

While treating of the government of the Phillippines, we must not forget th=
e ministers of their=20

religion, and the share which they have in preserving these islands as domi=
nions to the crown of=20

Spain. This influence dates from the earliest epoch of their discovery. The=
 followers of Cortes and=20

Pizarro, with their successors, were employed in enriching themselves in th=
e new world; and the=20

spirit of conquest and discovery having found wherewith to satiate the brut=
al avarice by which it=20

was directed, abandoned these islands to the pious efforts of the missionar=
ies by whom, rather=20



than by force of arms, they were in a great measure subdued; and even in th=
e present day, they=20

still preserve so great an influence, that the Phillippines may be almost s=
aid to exist under a=20

theocracy approaching to that of the Jesuits in Paraguay.  The ecclesiastic=
al administration is=20

composed of an Archbishop (of Manila), who has three suffragans, Ylocos, Ca=
marines, and Zebu;=20

the first two on Luzon, the last on the island of the same name. The revenu=
e of the Archbishop is=20

4000, and that of the bishops 3000 dollars annually. The regular Spanish cl=
ergy of all orders are=20

about 250, the major part of which are distributed in various convents in t=
he different islands,=20

though their principal seats are in that of Luzon; and many of them, from a=
ge or infirmity, are=20

confined to their convents in Manila.  The degree of respect in which "the =
Padre" is held by the=20

Indian, is truly astonishing. It approaches to adoration, and must be seen =
to be credited. In the=20

most distant provinces, with no other safeguard than the respect with which=
 he has inspired the=20

Indians, he exercises the most unlimited authority, and administers the who=
le of the civil and=20

ecclesiastical government, not only of a parish, but often of a whole provi=
nce. His word is law--his=20

advice is taken on all subjects. No order from the Alcalde, or even the gov=
ernment [68] is executed=20

without his counsel and approbation, rendered too in many cases the more in=
dispensable from his=20

being the only person who understands Spanish in the village. [69] To their=
 high honour be it=20

spoken, the conduct of these reverend fathers in general fully justifies an=
d entitles them to this=20

confidence. The "Padre" is the only bar to the oppressions of the Alcalde: =
he protects, advises,=20

comforts, remonstrates, and pleads for his flock; and not unfrequently has =
he been seen, though=20

bending beneath the weight of years and infirmity, to leave his province, a=
nd undertake a long and=20

often perilous voyage to Manila, to stand forward as the advocate of his In=
dians; and these=20

gratefully repay this kind regard for their happiness by every means in the=
ir power.  Their=20

hospitality is equally praiseworthy. The stranger who is travelling through=
 the country, no matter=20

what be his nation or his religion, [70] finds at every town the gates of t=
he convent open to him,=20

and nothing is spared that can contribute to his comfort and entertainment.=
 They too are the=20

architects and mechanists: many of them are the physicians and schoolmaster=
s of the country,=20

and the little that has been done towards the amelioration of the condition=
 of the Indian, has=20

generally been done by the Spanish clergy.  It is painful, however, to rema=
rk, that much that might=20

have been done, has been left undone. The exclusive spirit of the Roman chu=
rch, which confines=20

its knowledge to its priests, is but too visible even here: they appear to =
be more anxious to make=20

Christians, than citizens, and by neglecting this last part of their duty, =
have but very indifferently=20

fulfilled the first,--the too common error of proselytists of all denominat=
ions, which has probably its=20

source in that vanity of human nature, which is as insatiable beneath the c=
owl as under any garb it=20

has yet assumed.  Some of them too have furnished a striking but melancholy=
 proof of the=20

eloquent moral,               "It is not good for man to be alone."   Let u=
s draw a veil over these=20

infirmities. He who has lived amidst the busy hum of crowds, amidst the wil=
d whirl of human=20

passions and interests, can have but little conception of the state of that=
 mind, which perhaps=20

feeling alive to the blessings of social intercourse, is cut off for years =
from civilized men; and thus=20

buried mentally, is constrained to seek all its resources within itself. [7=
1] That heart is one of=20

powerful fibre which does not sometimes show itself to be human....  There =
are instances indeed=20

of some of them forgetting in a great measure their language! and of others=
 who have become=20

almost idiots while yet in the vigour of life! [72]  The next and lowest or=
der of ecclesiastics are the=20



Indian clergy (clerigos); they are in number from 800 to 1000, and though f=
rom the want of=20

Spaniards, the administration of many large districts and towns is confided=
 to them, they are as a=20

body far from being worthy of such an important charge. The majority of the=
m are ignorant to the=20

last degree, proud, debauched, and indolent: in a word, they unite the vice=
s of the priesthood to=20

those of the Indian, and form a class of men who may almost be said to be d=
istinguished by their=20

vices only.  This arises from various causes, of which the principal appear=
s to be that of their being=20

entirely excluded from the higher ecclesiastical situations. This alone, by=
 depriving them of the=20

most powerful stimulus to correct conduct, together with the very confined =
education they receive,=20

and the impassable line drawn between them and the Spanish clergy, whom the=
y are never=20

allowed to approach, and who treat them with much contempt, are sufficient =
to account, in a great=20

measure, for their apparent demerit. The fact, however, is such, whatever b=
e its cause; and=20

seldom a week passes, or at most a month, but some of them are brought befo=
re the=20

ecclesiastical tribunals, under accusations but little creditable to their =
cloth.  Their ordinary resort=20

at Manila is the cockpit or the gaming table, where they shew an avidity an=
d keenness which are=20

disgraceful and shameless to the last degree. Yet to the guidance of beings=
 like these is the=20

unfortunate Indian in a great measure abandoned, even in his last moments: =
for from the very=20

great proportion of these to the Spanish priests, and from the recluse live=
s of the latter, nearly=20

nine-tenths of all the clerical duties are performed by the Indian clerigos=
, such as I have described=20

them. The few who do form an exception, are men whose conduct is highly cre=
ditable to=20

themselves, and more striking from its unfrequent occurrence.  A keen and d=
eadly jealousy=20

subsists between these and the Spanish ecclesiastics, or rather a hatred on=
 the one side, and a=20

contempt on the other. The Indian clergy accuse these last of a neglect of =
their ecclesiastical=20

duties, of vast accumulations of property in lands, &c., which, say they, "=
belong to us the Indians."=20

The Spaniards in return treat them with silent contempt, continuing to enjo=
y the best benefices,=20

and living at their ease in the convents. From what has been said, it will =
be easily seen, "that much=20

may be said on both sides;" but these recriminations have the bad effect of=
 debasing both parties=20

in the eyes of the natives, and are the germs of a discord which may one da=
y involve these=20

countries in all the horrors of religious dissentions. [73]  Such are the c=
ivil and ecclesiastical=20

government of the Phillippines. We turn now to the Revenue and Expenditure,=
 Military=20

establishments, &c.  Until very lately these rich islands have been a const=
ant burden to the crown=20

of Spain, money having been annually sent from Mexico to supply their expen=
ses. The=20

establishment of the monopoly of tobacco has principally contributed to sup=
ply this deficiency. It=20

was established by an active and intelligent governor (Vasco) about 1745 [s=
c., 1785] and still=20

continues to be the principal revenue of the country; and large sums have b=
een from time to time=20

sent home to Spain, as a balance against those received from Mexico. The sa=
les of this article=20

amount more or less to a million of dollars per annum. The extensive establ=
ishment which is kept=20

up to prevent smuggling, and the expenses of purchase and manufacture, redu=
ce its net produce=20

to 500,000 dollars per annum. The plant is cultivated in the districts of G=
apan in Pampanga, in a=20

part of the province of Cagayan, and in the island Marinduque to the south =
of Luzon. It is delivered=20

in by the cultivators at fixed prices, and sent to Manila, where it is manu=
factured in a large range of=20

buildings dedicated to that purpose, and retailed to the public at about 18=
 to 19 1/2 dollars per=20

arroba of 25 lbs. (Spanish), the prices varying a little according to the h=
arvests.  The=20



administration, inspection, and manufacture of this article, employ several=
 thousand persons of=20

both sexes (the manufacturing process being almost wholly carried on by wom=
en). This is not only=20

the most productive, but the best conducted branch of the revenue; while it=
 is at the same time the=20

least vexatious in its operations, though not exempt from those objections =
which are common to all=20

government monopolies.  Another of these monopolies is that of Coco wine, a=
s it is called (vino de=20

Coco y nipa). This is a weak spirit produced from the juice of the Toddy tr=
ee (Borassus gomutus),=20

[74] and from the nipa (Cocos nypa): of this, large quantities are used by =
the natives. The expense=20

of collection is about 80,000 dollars, the net revenue to government varyin=
g from 2 to 300,000.=20

The poll-tax (tributo) is the other great branch of the revenue; the manner=
 of collecting it is=20

described in p. 29. Its amount to each individual is, with some exceptions =
and variations in=20

different provinces, 14 rials, or 1 3/4 dollars for every married Indian, f=
rom the age of 24 to 60. The=20

Mestizos pay 24 rials or 3 dollars, and the Chinese 6 dollars each: this la=
st branch is generally=20

farmed. The amount of Indian and Mestizo tribute may be stated in round num=
bers at 800,000=20

dollars: the expense of collecting it diminishes it to about 640,000. The e=
xemptions from it are=20

disbanded soldiers, who pay less than others, men above 60 years of age, an=
d the cultivators of=20

tobacco, or makers of wine for the royal monopolies.  The collection of thi=
s tax is always attended=20

with much trouble, and it is detested by the Indians to the last degree. Th=
e exaction of it from the=20

newly converted tribes, [75] and the extensive frauds which, as already det=
ailed, are practised by=20

means of it, render it the most oppressive of all impositions. The natives =
consider it (perhaps with=20

some justice), as giving money to no purpose; and infallibly evade it by ev=
ery means in their=20

power.  The customs produce from 1 to 300,000 dollars per annum. The remain=
ing part of the=20

revenue is derived from various minor sources: such are the cockpits, which=
 are farmed, and=20

produce a net revenue of 25 to 40,000 dollars;--the Chinese poll-tax, 30,00=
0 dollars;--"Bulas," [76]=20

(the sale of which is farmed, and produces from 10 to 12,000 dollars);--car=
ds, powder (a=20

monopoly), stamps, and other articles of minor importance; amongst which wa=
s formerly the=20

monopoly of betel nut, which is now abolished.  The expenses of administrat=
ion are as follows.=20

The civil and ecclesiastical officers of government, 250,000 dollars. The m=
ilitary, including all=20

classes, about 600,000; and the marine, about 550,000.  The excess of reven=
ue over the=20

expenditure is stated by Comyn to have been in 1809 about 450,000 dollars, =
but in this is included=20

250,000 received from Mexico.  In 1817, by an account published by order of=
 the Ayuntamiento of=20

Manila, the amount of the revenue was--                                   R=
eceipts=20

Dollars              Poll Tax                                 638,976      =
       Rentas (monopolies, farms, &c.)=20

810,784                                                    =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D                 Total                              1,449,760=
=20

[77]   of which a surplus would remain when all the expenses were liquidate=
d. In preceding years,=20

some surplus has been remitted to Spain.  The military establishment consis=
ts of three regiments=20

of infantry, one of dragoons, a squadron of hussars, and a battalion of art=
illery, in all about 4500=20

regulars. The militia are numerous, but only one regiment is under arms: th=
e total of men may be=20

estimated at 5000, but on an emergency, large bodies of irregulars can be c=
alled into activity. In=20

1804, the governor, Don J. M. de Anguilar, [i.e., Aguilar] is said to have =
had upwards of 20,000=20

men under arms, being in expectation of an attack from the English.  These =
troops (which are all=20

natives) are in general badly disciplined and officered, mostly by country-=
born officers, without the=20

advantage of an European education, ignorant of their military duties to th=
e last degree, many of=20



them (more especially in the Mestizo regiments) connected with the soldiers=
 by relationship, or at=20

least by the tie of mutual indulgence, the soldier performing every menial =
office for the officer, who=20

in return winks at the excesses of the soldier. This is carried to such an =
extent, that, not to mention=20

such trifles as a garden wall or gate, a bathing house, or a stable, or at =
times a little smuggling;=20

there are instances on record, where the commanding officer of a regiment h=
as built himself a=20

country house! the whole of the masonry and carpentry being performed by so=
ldiers of his=20

regiment! Another is of a captain collecting his debts by means of a piquet=
 of infantry; taking=20

possession of his debtor's house until payment was made!  It will be easily=
 conceived, that where=20

these things are permitted, the soldiers are made subservient to other purp=
oses; accordingly they=20

have been employed to punish the paramours of their officers' wives--to eje=
ct a troublesome=20

tenant--or at times to take vengeance for affronts, in cases where it might=
 not be safe for the=20

injured person to do so. [78]  These remarks apply more particularly to the=
 Mestizo officers. The=20

Spaniards, and some of the creoles, who are but very few in number, form a =
respectable class of=20

military men, of whom some few may be cited as models of spirit and discipl=
ine: but they are not=20

sufficiently numerous for their example to influence the despicable beings =
with whom they are=20

unavoidably associated; and the wealth and influence being generally on the=
 side of the native-

born officers, these abuses are permitted, and the complaints of others dis=
regarded.  It is but just,=20

however, to remark, that their pay is excessively mean; it is a bare, and m=
iserable subsistence;=20

and due weight should be given to this circumstance in extenuation. A capta=
in of regulars has not=20

more than 80 dollars per month! and so on in proportion, and when we reflec=
t, that from the low=20

value of the circulating medium, a dollar will barely command more than a r=
upee in any part of=20

India, much must be allowed for men so situated.  Hence, though the men, ar=
ms, and=20

accoutrements are not bad, the troops are, from abuses, embezzlement, and n=
eglect, miserably=20

deficient in a military point of view, and but poorly calculated to answer =
any efficient purpose. To=20

this description, the regiment of artillery and Pampango militia are except=
ions: the style of=20

equipment and discipline of the first are a high testimony of the activity =
and military talents of their=20

colonel. The queen's regiment is by far the most respectable of the infantr=
y.  Their cavalry are=20

badly mounted, the horses being very small, and by no means good. The men t=
oo are clumsily=20

equipped, with swords manufactured apparently in the 14th century, being st=
raight,=20

disproportionably long, and furnished with a steel poignet or basket, above=
 which is a cross,=20

resembling the rapiers of that time.  Their marine is still more miserably =
deficient in the requisite=20

qualities for essential service, and suffers more from the mal-administrati=
on of its various=20

branches. All work done in the royal arsenal is computed to cost at least 4=
0 per cent. more than=20

that by individuals! The marine consists of a flotilla of 40 or 50 gun-boat=
s, and as many feluccas,=20

[79] of which about one half, or fewer, may be in constant activity; with w=
hat effect has been=20

already remarked.  Like the army, the navy is almost entirely officered by =
creoles and Mestizos,=20

whose pay is but a subsistence, and consequently no prospect is offered to =
young men of family=20

and enterprise who may have other resources.  The arsenal at Cavite, about =
10 miles from Manila,=20

is well provided with officers and workmen, but has no docks. Vessels, howe=
ver, may heave down=20

with great safety; and the work, though expensive, is remarkably well execu=
ted.  The agriculture of=20

this very fertile country is yet in its infancy. Oppressed with so many ene=
mies to his advancement,=20

and placed in a climate where the slightest exertion insures subsistence, t=
he Indian has, like the=20



majority of his Malay brethren, been content with supplying his actual want=
s, without seeking for=20

luxuries. Hence, and from the expulsion of the Jesuits, they have made no a=
dvances beyond the=20

common attainments of the surrounding islanders.  This spirited and indefat=
igable order of men,=20

who, both by precept and example, encouraged agriculture, not only as the s=
ource of national=20

greatness, but as preparatory to, and inseparable from, conversion to Chris=
tianity, which they well=20

knew did not consist alone in ceremonies, but in fulfilling the duties of c=
itizens and men, and who,=20

whatever were their political sins, certainly possessed more than any other=
 the talent of converting=20

men from savage to civilized life, have left in the Phillippines some strik=
ing monuments of their=20

wide-spreading and well-directed influence. Extensive convents (the ground =
stories of which were=20

magazines), in the centre of fertile districts formerly in the highest stat=
e of cultivation, but now=20

more than half abandoned,--tunnels,--canals,--reservoirs and dams, by which=
 extensive tracts=20

were irrigated for the purposes of cultivation, attest the spirit with whic=
h they encouraged this=20

science; and if their expulsion was a political necessity, it certainly app=
ears to have been in this=20

country a moral evil.  The restraints imposed on commerce were another insu=
perable bar to their=20

prosperity, as depriving them of a market for their produce. Since foreigne=
rs have been allowed=20

free intercourse with them, their agriculture has in some degree improved b=
y the increased=20

demand of produce; but under the present system, but little can be expected=
 from it. [80]  The soil=20

is in general a rich red mould, with a great proportion of iron, and in som=
e districts volcanic=20

matters; it is easily worked and very productive: that in the immediate vic=
inity of Manila, and for=20

four or five miles round it, extending to that distance from the coast of t=
he Bay, is an alluvial soil,=20

formed by the confluence of the numerous rivers with the ocean; it is stiff=
, and in all respects very=20

inferior to the other. In some parts are extensive tracts, the reservoirs o=
f the attitude expressive of=20

frightful agony. Her legs are drawn up and her hands clinched. With one han=
d she had drawn her=20

veil about her head, to screen herself from the ashes and smoke. The form a=
nd texture of her=20

dress are clearly seen; and through its rents the fair young skin appears l=
ike polished marble.=20

Close by lay a young woman of high rank; young, richly dressed and beautifu=
l. One upraised arm=20

and her clenched hands tell plainer than words her agony and despair. A man=
--tall, stalwart, in=20

coarse dress and nail-studded sandals, lay at hand. Upon his back, with str=
aightened limbs and=20

extended arms, he had resolved, since unable to escape, to die like a man. =
His powerful features=20

are clearly shown, and a portion of his moustache adheres to the plaster ca=
st.  Such are sights=20

from which the veil of time has at last been lifted. How many perished in t=
hat fearful outbreak we=20

shall never know. Seven hundred skeletons have been found in one-third of t=
he city of Pompeii.=20

Perhaps two thousand perished there. But of the scores who fled from the ci=
ty, from suburban=20

villas, from villages along the mountain, and who were overtaken by the fie=
ry storm ere they=20

reached a place of safety, who shall tell? Who may declare the fate of the =
lady who appealed to=20

the Roman admiral Pliny for relief? Such questions each may determine for h=
imself. History will=20

preserve an eternal silence.  Such are the facts concerning the first great=
 historic eruption of=20

Vesuvius. That volcanic phenomena were known to the ancients we have alread=
y seen; but the=20

character of Vesuvius seems to have been unsuspected. The Greeks knew of th=
e mountain top as=20

a depressed plain, covered with groves and wild vines. Spartacus and his gl=
adiators, with their=20

thousands of followers, had their fortified camp there. Strabo called it a =
volcanic mountain, but=20

Pliny the elder did not include it in his list of volcanoes. The fertile, r=
ounded slopes were covered=20



with well-tilled fields.  But the neighboring regions were active, though V=
esuvius was not.=20

Pithecusa, the modern Ischia, was often and terribly shaken, and various at=
tempts to settle upon it=20

were in consequence abandoned. Poisonous gases poured forth, even when ther=
e was no active=20

eruption.  Still nearer Vesuvius lay the noted lake Avernus, which in Roman=
 mythology was the=20

gateway of hell. It was said to exhale noxious vapors so powerful that bird=
s could not cross it. At=20

the present day it is only a pretty lake, without any unusual properties. I=
t appears to cover an=20

extinct crater.  In the year 63 a great earthquake was felt in the Vesuvian=
 region. Hundreds of lives=20

were lost, and great damage was done in many cities; and numerous lighter s=
hocks occurred=20

during the next sixteen years. No one seems to have apprehended any danger =
from the mountain.=20

How long it had remained dormant is unknown. But Pompeii and Herculaneum ar=
e both built upon=20

lava beds. That Pompeii itself was a very old city is clearly established. =
In general outline it is=20

elliptical, nearly two miles in circuit, the entire area being one hundred =
and sixty acres. Characters=20

upon many of the foundation stones would seem to indicate a period earlier =
than the Etruscan=20

occupation; while other portions, especially the towers, are certainly of l=
ater date. It is quite fair to=20

suppose that Vesuvius, from these facts, had lain quiet for a thousand year=
s or more.  One effect=20

of this first eruption of Vesuvius was to break down the western wall of th=
e crater and destroy the=20

entire side of the mountain next the sea, leaving as the only remains of th=
e ancient crater a little=20

ridge on the south flank, and that portion, which under the name of Somma, =
still encircles the=20

present cone.  From the time of its first eruption, the restlessness of Ves=
uvius has been well=20

observed. The next action occurred in the year 203. In the meantime the sid=
es of the crater had=20

become overgrown with brushwood and forest trees, and the basin itself was =
a favorite haunt of=20

wild boars. In the year 472 the mountain broke forth with more violence tha=
n at either of the former=20

periods. The roaring was simply indescribable. The clouds of ashes spread o=
ver the entire=20

adjacent region. Houses toppled down miles away. Scores of people were suff=
ocated. The ashes=20

fell in showers at Constantinople and Tripoli.  Other eruptions followed in=
 512, 685, and 993. No=20

stream of molten lava issued at any of these. But in 1036, a great eruption=
 took place, during=20

which, we are told, the lava poured forth from fissures in the sides, as we=
ll as from the top, and ran=20

in a broad and deep stream into the sea. Thirteen years later another simil=
ar outbreak occurred;=20

then ninety years passed without any disturbance.  Of these eruptions, litt=
le beyond the bare fact=20

is known. But from the time of the last one referred to, 1139, scientific m=
en have carefully watched=20

each outbreak. In 1198, the neighboring crater of Solfatara Lake was in eru=
ption; in 1302, Ischia,=20

dormant over fourteen hundred years, exhibited wonderful activity. For more=
 than a year=20

earthquakes shook the island, and at length there burst forth a lava stream=
 from the southeast=20

side of the mountain, flowing two miles, to the sea. Many houses were destr=
oyed during the two=20

months=E2=80=99 eruption; and not a few of the inhabitants abandoned the is=
land. But Vesuvius was quiet=20

till 1306. Again it broke forth in 1500. During this time =C3=86tna was in =
a state of unwonted activity.=20

The eruption of 1538 broke forth at the foot of the mountain, and was marke=
d by some peculiar=20

features. The plain between Avernus, Monte Barbaro, and the sea, was first =
raised a little, and=20

many cracks made in it, from some of which water issued. The sea retreated =
about two hundred=20

paces, leaving many fish on the sands at the disposal of the people of Pozz=
uoli, a little watering=20

place on the Bay of Bai=C3=A6. On the evening of September 29, numerous sho=
cks of earthquake=20

occurred, and about two o=E2=80=99clock in the night an immense fissure ope=
ned near the lake and=20



extended toward the town. Smoke, fire, stones, and mud made of ashes, were =
vomited furiously,=20

the whole process being attended by a terrible roaring, as of continual lou=
dest thunder. Stones=20

and masses of pumice larger than an ox were thrown out. The gulf in the tow=
n widened, and not a=20

few houses were broken to pieces, or swallowed up in the chasm.  The large =
stones were thrown=20

about as high as a crossbow would carry, and then fell, sometimes into the =
lake, sometimes into=20

the chasm again; but mostly upon either side of it. The mud was ash-colored=
, very liquid at first but=20

rapidly thickening; and within thirty-six hours the site of Pozzuoli was co=
vered by a volcanic cone.=20

A contemporary chronicler, present at the time, says this cone was one thou=
sand paces in height;=20

by which he probably meant slant height. The cone at present is four hundre=
d and forty feet above=20

the Bay of Naples. Two days later it again began to cast forth stones and a=
shes; and again on the=20

seventh day. Several persons who had ascended the hill were killed in this =
sudden outbreak by=20

falling stones, or smothered by the sulphurous vapors. This =E2=80=9CMonte =
Nuovo=E2=80=9D or New Mountain, is a=20

mile and a half in circumference at the base, and four hundred and twenty-o=
ne feet deep. It is=20

apparent, then, that its bottom is nineteen feet above the sea level. The L=
ucrine Lake was almost=20

filled up. Only a shallow pool remains.  Falconi writes that from Naples th=
e flames were seen,=20

bursting forth in the night, between the hot-baths and Tripergola. The next=
 morning might be seen=20

the poor people flying in terror, begrimed with the black and muddy shower,=
 which continued=20

throughout the day. Flying from death, death was painted in their countenan=
ces. Some bore their=20

children in their arms; some carried sacks full of goods; some led donkeys =
loaded with valuables,=20

or such as were unable to walk.  The few eruptions after 1039 had been feeb=
le. We find the=20

mountain coming to be regarded as extinct as a volcanic crater. Nearly five=
 centuries passed.=20

Bracini, who visited it in 1631, writes that =E2=80=9Cthe crater was about =
five miles in circumference, and=20

above a thousand feet deep; its sides were covered with brushwood, and at t=
he bottom was a=20

plain on which cattle grazed. In the woody parts wild boars frequently harb=
ored. In one part of the=20

plain, covered with ashes, were three small pools; one filled with hot and =
bitter water, another=20

salter than the sea, and a third hot but tasteless.=E2=80=9D Such was the g=
eneral character of the crater in=20

A. D., 78, save that it was not so deep.  In December, 1631, with a sudden,=
 tremendous roar, the=20

mountain flamed into action. This outbreak has never been surpassed in fury=
 and destructiveness=20

by any eruption of Vesuvius, unless we except the one which destroyed Pompe=
ii. The fatalities=20

between the two eruptions had been few, the most of the mischief being dama=
ge to property. One=20

of the eruptions failed to throw out any marked amount of matter of any sor=
t.  But in 1631 the=20

woods and pastures, vines, and fields within the crater, were annihilated. =
Explosion followed=20

explosion in swift succession. The great crater was filled with molten rock=
. Stream after stream=20

poured swiftly forth, till seven rivers of fire were desolating the land. C=
rops were fired by the cinder=20

showers. Millions of tons of ashes were scattered over the land. The mounta=
in slope was dotted=20

with ruined villages. Resina, a populous little town on the site of Hercula=
neum was completely=20

destroyed. Storms of wind and rain swept the mountain, and the huge rivers =
of mud buried=20

whatever had escaped the lava and ashes. The crater itself was shattered an=
d nearly destroyed.=20

Hundreds of cattle were destroyed by the fiery storm. Not less than eightee=
n hundred people=20

perished in this great convulsion. Thirty-five years later another outbreak=
 occurred; and since then=20

the mountain has been in constant activity.  The next unusual activity of e=
special note occurred in=20

1737. Breislak has estimated the outflow of lava at  [Illustration: VESUVIU=
S IN 1737.]  10,237,096=20



cubic meters; enough to cover a square mile twelve and a half feet in depth=
. Immense quantities of=20

white ashes were thrown out, and the entire mountain was filled with rents =
and fissures, from=20

which poured volumes of noxious vapors that suffocated man and beast. The q=
uantity of ashes=20

thrown out doubtless exceeded the volume of lava. In 1766 occurred another =
unusual convulsion,=20

the mountain continuing vigorously active from March till December, vomitin=
g lava streams and=20

huge volcanic =E2=80=9Cbombs.=E2=80=9D These last are masses of lava enclos=
ing a bubble of gas, which is set free=20

by the breaking of the bomb as it falls. In 1779 the lava streams for a tim=
e threatened Naples itself.=20

Sir William Hamilton, long time English ambassador in Italy, has left a car=
eful record of the=20

eruption of 1793-94. Passing by such features as, common to all its eruptio=
ns, we have noted=20

elsewhere, we may note the more striking particulars: Millions of heated st=
ones were thrown high=20

in the air, and fell in beautiful curves about the cone. It might be likene=
d to the bursting stars of our=20

pyrotechnic displays. Nearly half Vesuvius was covered with fire. =E2=80=9C=
Huge masses of white smoke=20

were vomited forth by the disturbed mountain, and formed themselves at a he=
ight of many=20

thousands of feet above the crater into a huge, ever-moving canopy, through=
 which, from time to=20

time, were hurled pitch-black jets of volcanic dust, and dense vapors, mixe=
d with cascades of red-

hot rocks and scori=C3=A6. The rain from the cloud canopy was scalding hot.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAs the lava rushed forth=20

from its imprisonment it streamed a liquid, white and brilliantly pure rive=
r, which burned for itself a=20

smooth channel through a great arched chasm in the side of the mountain. It=
 flowed with the=20

clearness of honey in regular channels, cut finer than art can imitate and =
glowing with all the=20

splendor of the sun.=E2=80=9D Various were the effects of stones thrown in.=
 =E2=80=9CLight bodies of five, ten or=20

fifteen pounds weight, made no impression; but bodies of sixty, seventy and=
 eighty pounds were=20

seen to form a kind of bed on the surface of the lava and float away with i=
t. A stone of three=20

hundred weight that had been thrown out by the crater, lay near the source =
of the current of lava. I=20

raised it up on one end and then let it fall in upon the liquid lava, when =
it gradually sank beneath=20

the surface and disappeared. If I wished to describe the manner in which it=
 acted upon the lava, I=20

should say that it was like a loaf of bread thrown into a bowl of very thic=
k honey, which gradually=20

involves itself in the heavy liquid and then slowly sinks to the bottom.=E2=
=80=9D  As it flowed down the=20

mountain the brilliant whiteness disappeared. Then it began to wrinkle, whe=
re flowing slowly, like=20

the cream on a pan of milk when poured off. Crusts formed, which were speed=
ily cracked to=20

pieces, as the current underneath pressed on. On such crusts a person may c=
ross the stream, if=20

not particular as to singeing his boots. Being cooled when near the bottom,=
 yet forced on by the=20

pressure behind, the whole mass =E2=80=9Cresembled nothing so much as a hea=
p of unconnected cinders=20

from an iron foundry, rolling slowly along and falling with a rattling nois=
e over one another.=E2=80=9D  This=20

eruption continued from February, 1793, to July, 1794. Rocks were hurled tw=
o thousand feet into=20

the air. The lava flowed from fifteen different sources, and pouring in one=
 stream from twelve to=20

forty feet thick, flowed three hundred and eighty feet into the sea, requir=
ing but six hours from the=20

time of the outbreak to reach the shore. The sea boiled for one hundred yar=
ds around. The town of=20

Torre del Greco was destroyed, and a number of persons were killed. The nat=
ives insisted, when=20

the paroxysm was over, on rebuilding on the old site. The Neapolitans have =
a jest concerning their=20

own exemption from the calamities which Torre has endured: =E2=80=9CNaples =
sins and Torre is punished.=E2=80=9D=20

The lava of this discharge is estimated at about twenty-one million cubic m=
etres.  Several=20

eruptions of Vesuvius have occurred during the present century. Of these, t=
he most notable are=20



those of 1822 and 1872. They have given us exact information upon a point w=
here formerly there=20

was only conjecture, viz: the height which the material thrown out may reac=
h.  In 1822, the ashes=20

for twelve days fell in a continuous shower. The lava which had boiled up a=
nd hardened till the=20

appearance of a depressed crater was lost was blown away. An immense abyss =
was formed,=20

three-fourths of a mile in length and two thousand feet deep. The entire to=
p of the cone was then=20

blown away. Masses of lava weighing many tons were hurled two or three mile=
s. Darkness=20

prevailed in broad day, as far away as Amalfi, where the ashes fell to the =
depth of several inches.=20

The dense column of ashes and vapor was thrown ten thousand feet above the =
level of the sea. In=20

no known eruption has the electrical display been so brilliant and continuo=
us. The roll of thunder=20

could be clearly distinguished from the rumble of the volcano.  In recent y=
ears an observatory has=20

been erected on the mountain, and all its phenomena carefully noted. During=
 the eruption of 1872=20

instantaneous photography was pressed into service. A comparison of the who=
le view with the=20

height of the mountain, showed that the vapors and fragments were thrown tw=
enty thousand feet=20

into the air--nearly four miles. This outburst began on April 24, and reach=
ed its climax in two days.=20

The entire mountain filled with fissures and cracks--in the words of Prof. =
Palmieri, =E2=80=9Csweated fire.=E2=80=9D=20

Enormous volumes of steam poured from the crater, with such a prodigious ro=
ar, that the terrified=20

Neapolitans rushed from their houses, and spent the night in the open air. =
The lava floods rushed=20

down the mountain side; and one of them destroyed two villages, besides man=
y country houses=20

adjacent. The whole region for several days quivered with shocks of earthqu=
ake.  Such have been=20

the more important eruptions of Vesuvius. Its position, by an ancient and p=
opulous city, has made=20

it the most celebrated of volcanoes. There seems no doubt that it is suppli=
ed from the same=20

source which feeds the others in the neighborhood, as well as Mt. =C3=86tna=
. When Vesuvius is quiet,=20

=C3=86tna is active, and vice versa. Close observation has established a we=
ll-defined daily periodicity:=20

so that the most favorable period for visiting the crater may always be kno=
wn beforehand.  In fine,=20

about sixty eruptions of Vesuvius are on record. Of these, twenty-three wer=
e during the last=20

century, and twenty-five during this. The activity of the entire region see=
ms on the increase.=20

CHAPTER XXII.  OTHER GREAT ERUPTIONS.      =E2=80=9CHast thou observed the =
ancient tract,      That=20

was trodden by wicked mortals,      Who were arrested on a sudden,      Who=
se foundation is a=20

molten flood?      Who said to God, Depart from us,      What can Shaddai d=
o to us?      Though he=20

had filled their houses with wealth.      (Far from me be the counsel of th=
e wicked!)      The=20

righteous beheld and rejoiced,      The innocent laughed them to scorn,    =
  Surely their substance=20

was carried away,      And their riches devoured by fire.=E2=80=9D   Such i=
s Dr. Henderson=E2=80=99s translation of=20

Job XXII, 15-20. By many the passage has been supposed to refer to the dest=
ruction of the cities=20

of the plain, and used to support the theory that a volcanic eruption was t=
he means of their=20

overthrow. If the theory were true, the catastrophe is the earliest histori=
c eruption. A brief=20

statement of the reasons for the belief may interest the reader.  The entir=
e Dead Sea valley is=20

depressed far below the level of the sea. From the Dead Sea to the head of =
the Red Sea is a well-

marked trough, supposed to indicate that the Jordan once emptied into the R=
ed Sea. The adjacent=20

Sinaitic peninsula is a volcanic region, which may have been in eruption wh=
en the Israelites=20

passed it. Dr. Robinson reports water marks left high on the cliffs, far to=
 the south of the Dead=20

Sea. Fragments of lava have been picked up among the salt-crusts and bitumi=
nous deposits on=20

the shores.  In short, the region is one in which, at some time, volcanic a=
ction occurred. It lies=20



between two great volcanic  [Illustration: DESTRUCTION OF SODOM.]  centers:=
 Sinai, and the=20

volcanic region of Arabia and Syria. The question really is, whether any di=
sturbance occurred=20

there at so late a period as the destruction of Sodom.  The idea advanced b=
y several thoughtful=20

men is, that in the bituminous plain occupied by the cities, fissures opene=
d and flames and cinders=20

issuing, rained upon the inflammable surface, speedily destroying the citie=
s, which sunk with the=20

earth till the sea covered them. Such cases, minus the bitumen, have severa=
l times occurred. And,=20

again, the sea might have existed before, and merely have been extended by =
the convulsion.=20

Such is the substance of the theory.  Cases in support of it are not wantin=
g. The city of Euphemia,=20

in Calabria, was so swallowed up in 1638. Kircher, who was near at the time=
, tells how he and his=20

companions, unable to keep their feet, during the violent earthquake, lay u=
pon the ground till the=20

paroxysms were somewhat abated. Rising and looking for Euphemia, only a fri=
ghtful black cloud=20

was seen. It slowly cleared away revealing a loathsome and putrid lake. No =
trace of the city or its=20

inhabitants was ever found.  In the island of Trinidad is a vast lake of pi=
tch, of which the Indian=20

legend tells the origin. The words are Kingsley=E2=80=99s:      =E2=80=9COn=
ce that dark and loathly pitch-lake=20

Was a garden, bright and fair,      And the Chaymas, from the mainland,    =
    Built their palm=20

ajoupas there.       There they throve, and there they fattened.        Hal=
e and happy, safe and=20

strong,      Passed the livelong days in feasting,        Passed the nights=
 in dance and song.       Till=20

they cruel grew, and wanton,        Till they killed the colibris,      The=
n outspoke the Great good=20

Spirit,        Who can see through all the trees.=E2=80=9D  The spirit proc=
eeded to remind the Chaymas of all=20

the good things he had provided for them; how he had allowed them unlimited=
 use of all things=20

which could be of any possible good to them; how he had even been patient w=
ith their=20

thanklessness. Only the colibris or humming-birds, useless to the Chaymas, =
he had reserved for=20

himself, that he might have pleasure in their beauty and happiness. The sto=
ry continues:      =E2=80=9CBut=20

the Chaymas=E2=80=99 ears were deafened;        Blind their eyes, and could=
 not see,      How a blissful=20

Indian=E2=80=99s spirit        Lived in every colibri.       Lived, forgett=
ing pain and sorrow,        Ever fair and=20

ever new,      Whirring round the dear old woodland,        Feeding on the =
honeydew.       Then one=20

evening roared the earthquake,        Monkeys howled, and parrots screamed,=
      And the=20

Guaraons, at morning        Gathered here, as men who dreamed.       Sunk w=
ere gardens, sunk=20

ajoupas,        Hut and hammock, man and hound,      And above the Chayma v=
illage,        Boiled=20

with pitch the cursed ground.=E2=80=9D  The salient points of the evidence =
being presented, the reader may=20

draw his own conclusions. Perhaps the cities were fired in the manner sugge=
sted--perhaps=20

lightning ignited the bitumen. But it is generally supposed that their site=
 lies beneath the sea.  After=20

the account given of Vesuvius, the reader will no doubt be surprised to lea=
rn that this noted=20

mountain can not rank as more than a respectable fourth-rate volcano. It wi=
ll require but a brief=20

comparison with others to show that such is the case.  By far the largest v=
olcano in Europe, and=20

next to Vesuvius, the most noted, is Mt. Etna, in the island of Sicily. It =
was well known to the=20

ancients, and appears to have been in eruption from the most remote histori=
c times. Diodorus=20

Siculus records that a violent eruption caused an adjacent district to be d=
eserted by its inhabitants=20

before the Trojan war. Thucydides tells of three eruptions between the colo=
nization of Sicily by the=20

Greeks and the Peloponnesian war--431 B. C.  Notwithstanding the great anti=
quity of the records=20

of this mountain, but little detail is known of its earlier eruptions. The =
first of which any extended=20

account exists is the great outbreak of 1669. The convulsion began with a t=
remendous=20



earthquake. Many villages and towns in the adjacent districts were leveled =
to the earth. In the plain=20

of St. Lio, a fissure six feet wide and twelve miles long and of unknown de=
pth opened from north to=20

south with a terrific, crashing noise, and extended nearly to the top of th=
e mountain. Flashes of=20

intense light poured from it. Five other parallel fissures afterwards opene=
d, one after the other,=20

emitting smoke, and the most horrid bellowings, which were heard to the dis=
tance of forty miles.=20

This explains the manner in which dykes or banks of lava are thrown up amid=
 other rocks. The=20

light emitted by these fissures would indicate that they were, to a certain=
 height, filled with glowing=20

lava.  The lava, during this eruption, having overwhelmed and destroyed fou=
rteen towns, some of=20

them containing three or four thousand inhabitants, at length arrived at th=
e walls of Catania, a=20

populous city, situated ten miles from the volcano. These walls had been ra=
ised sixty feet high,=20

towards the mountain, in order to protect the city, in case of an eruption.=
 But the burning flood=20

accumulated against the wall, so as to fill all the space around and below =
that part, and finally=20

poured over it in a fiery cataract, destroying every thing in that vicinity=
.  From Catania the lava=20

continued its course until it reached the sea, a distance of fifteen miles =
from its source, in a current=20

about eighteen hundred feet broad, and forty feet deep. While moving on, it=
s surface was, in=20

general, a mass of solid rock, or cooled lava, and it advanced by the protr=
usion of the melted=20

matter, through this hardened crust.  As an illustration of the intense hea=
t of volcanic matter, the=20

Canon Recupero relates that in 1766 he ascended a small hill composed of an=
cient volcanic=20

matter, in order to observe the slow and gradual manner in which a current =
of liquid fire advanced=20

from =C3=86tna. This current was two and a half miles broad; and, while he =
stood observing it, two=20

small threads of lava, issuing from a crevice, detached themselves from the=
 main stream, and=20

approached rapidly towards the eminence where he and his guide were standin=
g. They had only=20

just time to escape, when they saw the hill on which they stood a few minut=
es before, and which=20

was fifty feet high, entirely surrounded, and, in about fifteen minutes, en=
tirely melted down into the=20

burning mass, so as to be incorporated with, and move on along with it.  Ac=
cording to Hitchcock,=20

77,000 persons perished during the eruption of 1769, and eighty-four square=
 miles were covered=20

with lava.  The slowness with which lava cools may be inferred that ten yea=
rs later, workmen=20

endeavoring to sink a shaft through the bed were forced to abandon the work=
 when near the=20

bottom, by reason of the heat.  While this was =C3=86tna=E2=80=99s greatest=
 outbreak, several of terrible=20

destructiveness have occurred since. In 1693 an eruption was accompanied by=
 earthquake=20

shocks, which in three days did more damage than the lava. Catania was almo=
st destroyed; great=20

sea-waves rolled in upon the  [Illustration: DESTRUCTION OF CATANIA.]  wrec=
k; the vessels in=20

the harbor were dashed against each other or upon the beach: the ringing of=
 the bells and the roar=20

of the mountain and sea was mingled with the cries of thousands of unfortun=
ates struggling in the=20

ruins. Not less than 16,000 people perished in Catania alone.  In 1755 occu=
rred an eruption which=20

is memorable for the great flood which attended it. Immense quantities of s=
now and ice,=20

accumulated about the summit, were melted by the intense heat, and the wate=
rs rushed down in a=20

column thirty feet deep and one and three-quarters miles wide, into the pla=
in below. The lower=20

portion of the valley was filled with the debris. Those who were not buried=
 in the rubbish were=20

swept out to sea. The total loss of life is not exactly known, but amounted=
 to many thousands.=20

Second in volume to the eruption of 1669, but very slightly destructive, is=
 the eruption of 1852-53.=20

It began August 20, 1852, and continued nine months. =E2=80=9CThe united wi=
dth of the lava streams was=20



two miles, with a depth of from eight to sixteen feet, piled up in some pla=
ces to one hundred feet. It=20

reached to near Zarafana,--almost six miles, descending thirty-five hundred=
 feet in sixteen days.=20

The Val del Bove, from the upper part of which it proceeded, looked like a =
sea of fire. Explosions=20

as of artillery were frequently heard, and the scori=C3=A6 were sent up to =
great heights.=E2=80=9D The intense=20

heat set fire to the trees in the vicinity.  In January, 1865, a considerab=
le eruption took place from=20

an immense fissure on the northeastern slope of the mountain. Seven active =
craters developed=20

along the fissure, sending out a lava stream one and one-half miles wide.  =
Three other eruptions=20

have taken place from =C3=86tna since 1853; but, save some damage to proper=
ty, these have been=20

comparatively unimportant, save from a geological standpoint. One began in =
1874 from a fissure=20

on the north side, but suddenly ceased. Prof. Silvestri, after examining th=
e locality, asserted that=20

the next eruption would take place from this same fissure. Five years later=
 his assertion was=20

verified, large streams of lava being sent out, with heavy showers of ashes=
 and sand. Large areas=20

of forest were destroyed, and the stream drew alarmingly near some populous=
 villages, but=20

stopped not far from a small river. The area of the lava bed was about seve=
n hundred and fifty=20

acres, the volume being about twenty-three and a half million tons.  =C3=86=
tna=E2=80=99s last eruption was in=20

May, 1886; a few houses were destroyed, but no lives were lost. =C3=86tna a=
nd the adjacent Lipari=20

Islands exhibited unusual activity during the entire seventeenth century, h=
aving a total of fourteen=20

eruptions; as many as are recorded in all their previous history. The next =
century witnessed fifteen=20

outbursts from =C3=86tna, and during the present one there have been eleven=
.  It will be noticed that=20

both Vesuvius and =C3=86tna seem to have reached their maximum activity at =
the close of the last=20

century. The same is true of the volcanoes of Iceland. This island, which i=
s as large as Ireland, is=20

built up entirely of volcanic matter. It doubtless began with a single, gre=
at submarine volcano; but=20

to-day it has at least thirteen active vents. It presents us with the most =
tremendous outpour of=20

matter in the history of the world. For seven hundred years there has not b=
een an interval of forty,=20

and seldom of more than twenty, without eruptions and earthquakes in some p=
ortion of the island.=20

Single eruptions of Mt. Hecla have lasted six years. Often during violent e=
arthquakes, old=20

mountains have disappeared; new ones have been raised up; rivers turned fro=
m their courses, or=20

dried up altogether. The old Norseman who discovered the island might much =
more appropriately=20

have named it Fireland. Doubtless had his ancestors known the island they w=
ould have chosen it=20

as the home of the terrible fire giants.  But Iceland is the realm of both =
frost and fire; and there is=20

no more romantic or painful chapter in history than the story of this hardy=
 and spirited race to=20

maintain their foothold in the face of such terrible odds. Those who hold t=
hat a nation=E2=80=99s progress=20

and stamina are in proportion to its material advantages, would have to mak=
e an exception in=20

favor of blood. The plucky Norsemen have held their own in this region for =
nine centuries; nor is=20

there any deterioration. No nation can to-day show a better intellectual or=
 moral condition than=20

these poor but hardy islanders. Yet there is not a region of the world that=
 has been more=20

frequently or terribly scourged than this semibarren island.  The best know=
n volcano in Iceland is=20

Mt. Hecla, which ranks with =C3=86tna and Vesuvius in fame. It is not the h=
ighest nor most remarkable=20

of Icelandic volcanoes; but the frequency of its eruptions, together with t=
he fact that it may be=20

easily reached, have brought it to the front. It is five thousand feet high=
, and lies but thirty-five=20

miles from the sea. The larger portion of the material thrown out by it con=
sists of slag, cinders,=20

pumice, and ashes, the slope of its cone being about 35 degrees. It has not=
hing answering to the=20



customary crater; the eruptions break from fissures in its sides; and, in c=
onsequence, it may emit=20

several streams or showers at once.  Hecla has been in eruption about thirt=
y times since its=20

character was first known, and has at times made fearful havoc. Its last gr=
eat outbreak was in=20

1878.  Hecla has adjutants in this volcanic field that are more savage and =
relentless than the=20

generalissimo. One of the most destructive outbursts of recent times occurr=
ed in the Vatna district=20

in 1875. In this region, about sixty  [Illustration: MT. HECLA.]  miles by =
one hundred and fifteen, is=20

a very nest of volcanoes. The convulsion lasted several months, the entire =
region being active;=20

and great numbers of people perished. So great was the destruction of prope=
rty, crops, and flocks=20

that the people, reduced to starvation, were compelled to appeal to Britain=
 and Denmark for=20

assistance. This has happened more than once in Iceland=E2=80=99s history. =
 But far up in the impenetrable=20

deserts of the interior is a mountain which has seldom shown any activity; =
but when in full blast, its=20

power is unsurpassed by any volcano on the globe. This is the fearful Skapt=
ar Jokul, or Skaptar=20

mountain. A single instance of its power will suffice.  One of the most stu=
pendous outbreaks=20

recorded in history is that of Skaptar Jokul in 1783. In the quantity of la=
va ejected, it is hardly=20

surpassed by any single eruption; and few disturbances of the sort have sur=
passed it in fatality.=20

Immense volumes of ashes were hurled into the air, spreading over the whole=
 island in dense=20

clouds. Streams were poisoned by the minerals and alkalies thrown out. Imme=
nse numbers of=20

sheep and cattle perished. Thousands of acres of pasture lands were ruined.=
 Where the grass=20

was not killed, it often was rendered poisonous, like the water, by the min=
eral dust falling upon it.=20

The hills were dotted with the decaying carcasses. The air was filled with =
horrible stench. The=20

ashes fell in such volumes into the ocean that the fish deserted the coast.=
 The flying clouds of dust=20

spread to Europe. The appalling horror of the scene can hardly be imagined.=
 Death stalked abroad=20

in his most repulsive form.  =E2=80=9CThe river Skapta, a considerable stre=
am, was for a time completely=20

dried by a torrent of liquid fire. This river was about two hundred feet br=
oad, and its banks from=20

four to six hundred above the level of the water. This defile was entirely =
filled for a considerable=20

distance by the lava, which crossed the river by the dam thus formed, and o=
verflowed the country=20

beyond, where it filled a lake of considerable extent, and great depth.  =
=E2=80=9CThis eruption commenced=20

on the 11th of June. On the 18th of the same month, a still greater quantit=
y of lava rushed from the=20

mouth of the volcano, and flowed with amazing rapidity, sometimes over the =
first stream, but=20

generally in a new course. The melted matter having crossed some of the tri=
butary streams of the=20

Skapta, completely dammed up their waters and caused great destruction of p=
roperty and lives by=20

their overflow. The lava, after flowing for several days, was precipitated =
down a tremendous=20

cataract, called Stapafoss, where it filled a profound abyss, which that gr=
eat water-fall had been=20

excavating for ages, and thence the fiery flood continued its course.  =E2=
=80=9COn the 3rd of August, a new=20

eruption poured forth fresh floods of lava, which, taking a different direc=
tion from the others, filled=20

the bed of another river, by which a large lake was formed, and much proper=
ty and many lives=20

destroyed.  =E2=80=9CThe effect of this dreadful calamity may in some measu=
re be imagined when it is=20

known that, although Iceland did not at that time contain more than fifty t=
housand inhabitants,=20

there perished nine thousand human beings by this single eruption, making n=
early one in five of=20

the whole population. Part of them were destroyed by the burning lava itsel=
f; some by drowning,=20

other by noxious vapors which the lava emitted, and others in consequence o=
f the famine, caused=20

by the showers of ashes, which covered a great proportion of the island and=
 destroyed most of the=20



vegetation. The fish, also, on which the inhabitants depended, in a great m=
easure, for food,=20

entirely deserted the coast.=E2=80=9D  The quantity of lava which Skaptar J=
okul emitted during this eruption=20

was almost beyond belief. The two principal branches were respectively fort=
y and fifty miles long.=20

The branch which crossed the Skapta was from twelve to fifteen miles wide; =
the width of the other=20

was seven miles. The usual depth was one hundred=20


_
which first yield an amazing supply of fish, [81] and then a good crop of r=
ice or pasture for the=20

buffaloes.  The frequent rains, and the numerous rivers and streams with wh=
ich the country is=20

every-where intersected, adds to its extraordinary fertility: it is seldom,=
 if ever, afflicted with=20

droughts, but is at times devastated by locusts (perhaps once in 10 or 15 y=
ears), and these make=20

dreadful havoc amongst the canes. Their attacks, however, are partial, and =
generally take place=20

after the rice is harvested, in December, disappearing before the rains. In=
 1818, nearly the whole=20

of the canes were destroyed by them, and the Ayuntamiento of Manila expende=
d from 60 to=20

80,000 dollars in purchasing large quantities of them, which were thrown in=
to the sea. [82]  The=20

buffalo is universally used in all field labours, for which, however, he is=
 but poorly calculated: the=20

slowness of his pace, and his great suffering from heat, which obliges the =
labourer to bathe him=20

frequently, occasion a very considerable loss of frequent; and where the st=
reams dashed across=20

gorges or narrow valleys the depth was six or seven hundred. It would be qu=
ite safe to estimate=20

the average depth at one hundred and fifty feet. These two principal stream=
s were, then, sufficient=20

to cover one thousand square miles to a depth of one hundred and fifty feet=
. Contrast with this the=20

twenty million cubic meters estimated to have been poured forth in one of t=
he great Vesuvian=20

eruptions. This last would cover one square mile to a depth of twenty-five =
feet. Vesuvius sinks to=20

an insignificance that is pitiable; its great outbreak produced but one-six=
 thousandths as much as=20

the single eruption of Skaptar Jokul! Such calculations may give us a compa=
rative estimate of the=20

two; but no figures can give us any conception of the force required to ele=
vate such a stream of=20

melted rock through the crust of the earth. And if we compare the resultant=
 fatality, it is clear that=20

this great convulsion, in a very sparsely settled island, destroyed more li=
ves than all the=20


_
which is scarcely compensated by his great strength and little expense in k=
eeping. Indeed, the=20

bullock should perhaps be on all occasions substituted for him, excepting o=
nly in the cultivation of=20

rice fields. In a few districts, this is the case; but it is with reluctanc=
e that the native uses him in=20

preference to the buffalo.  Their breed of horses is small, but very hardy:=
 they are never used for=20

agricultural purposes, though but few of the peasants are without one for r=
iding, and many of them=20

have two or three. In the province of Pampanga (the finest tribe of Indians=
 in the Phillippines), they=20

risk considerable sums on races! of which they are very fond.  Their plough=
 is of Chinese origin: it=20

has but one handle, and no coulter or mould-board, the upper part of the sh=
are, which is flat, and=20

turned to one side, performing this part of the work. The common harrow is =
composed of five or six=20

pieces of the stems of the thorny bamboos, which at the lower part are almo=
st solid; these are=20

united by a long peg of the same, passing through all the pieces: to these =
the hard branches of=20

thorns are left appending, and being cut off at a short distance from the s=
tem, form the teeth of the=20

instrument, which, rude as it is, performs its work well, and usefully, and=
 is seldom out of order.=20

For cleaning and finally pulverizing the ground, they have another harrow o=
f Chinese origin, (or an=20

invention of the Jesuits?) It is of wrought iron, and for simplicity and ut=
ility it is, I think, unequalled.=20

By means of it they can extirpate the Lallang grass (Andropogon caricosum),=
 called by them=20

Cogon, [83] and which no other instrument will perform so well, that I am a=
cquainted with.  A hoe,=20

like that of the West Indies, answers the purposes of a spade; and (with th=
e basket) of a shovel. A=20

large knife (the Malay Parang), called "Bolo," completes the list of their =
agricultural instruments.=20

Machinery they cannot be said to possess, except a rude mill of two cylinde=
rs for cane, and=20

another for grinding their rice, can be called such. The greater part of th=
e rice is beaten from the=20

husk in wooden mortars, and by hand.  The rainy season commences with the S=
. W. monsoon,=20

and ends in October. The rice (the aquatic sorts) is planted by hand in Jul=
y and August, and=20

reaped in December. The upland rice, of which they have two varieties, is p=
lanted earlier, and=20

comes sooner to maturity. The cane is planted in the manner called "en cano=
n" by the French, that=20

is, the plant piece is stuck diagonally into the ground; and thus, from the=
 roots being often on the=20

surface, the plant suffers frequently from drought, and they have seldom tw=
o crops from a piece of=20

cane: their sugar, though clumsily manufactured, is of excellent grain, and=
 highly esteemed by the=20

refiners of Europe.  The indigo plant is very fine; and though, as in all c=
ountries, a precarious crop,=20

yet it is far from being so much so as in India: it has been manufactured e=
qual to Guatemala, but=20

in the present day is of a very inferior quality: this arises from various =
causes, of which the=20

principal are ignorance in the manufacture of it, a want of capital, and sp=
irit of enterprise. They=20

have no tanks of masonry, the whole process being carried on in two wooden =
vats of a very=20

moderate size, from which the fecula is taken once a week. It is needless t=
o remark, that the=20

quality of the indigo is materially injured by this alone: it is also subje=
ct to many adulterations in the=20

hands of the Mestizos, before being brought to market.  The coffee plant wa=
s almost entirely=20

unknown about 40 years ago, a few plants only existing in the gardens about=
 Manila. It was=20

gradually transported from thence to the towns in the neighbourhood of the =
lake, where it has=20

been since multiplied to an amazing degree by an extraordinary method. A sp=
ecies of civet cat=20

with which the woods abound, swallows the berries, [84] and these passing t=
hrough the animal=20

entire, take root, and thus the forests are filled with wild plants. This f=
act may be depended upon,=20

and the major part of all the coffee exported from Manila is produced from =
the wild plants, and is=20



equal or superior in in its densely populated neighborhood.  This eruption =
of Skaptar was=20

preceded by several outbreaks in the sea; some of them close to the shore; =
some many miles=20

from land. Such phenomena have become tolerably familiar. Livy informs us t=
hat a disturbance of=20

this kind near Sicily, occurring with similar phenomena at the time of Hann=
ibal=E2=80=99s death, so terrified=20

the Romans as to induce them to proclaim a day of supplication to the gods =
to avert their=20

displeasure. Santorin in the Grecian Archipelago is a similar production. A=
nd in 1831 an island=20

was thrown up to the southwest of Sicily, where previous soundings had show=
n a depth of six=20

hundred feet. It was preceded by a violent spouting of steam and water. The=
 sea around was filled=20

with floating pumice and dead fish. The crater reached a height of two hund=
red feet, being three=20

miles in circumference. Its circular basin was full of boiling, dingy, red =
water. It continued active=20

three weeks, and then slowly sank, leaving a dangerous reef eleven feet bel=
ow the surface; while=20

a single black volcanic rock projected from the sea near the center of the =
reef. It is known as=20

Graham=E2=80=99s Island. Thus we see that volcanic action is not confined t=
o the land, and that the areas=20

affected are continually shifting.  Jorullo, in Mexico, affords an example =
of the way in which new=20

volcanoes are constantly being formed. In the parallel of the City of Mexic=
o exist five volcanoes,=20

extending in a line across the country as if thrown up along some immense f=
issure or=20

subterranean fault, extending from sea to sea. Of these Popocatepetl is per=
haps the largest, and=20

Jorullo the most recent.  There formerly existed in Mexico an extensive pla=
in of remarkable fertility,=20

covered with fields of cane, cotton and indigo, and watered by irrigation f=
rom the reservoirs in the=20

basaltic mountains that bounded it. This region, the _Malpays_, had no volc=
ano within eighty=20

miles, and lay twenty-six hundred feet above the sea. In June, 1759, alarmi=
ng rumblings were=20

heard in the earth, which were succeeded by severe earthquakes. These pheno=
mena lasted=20

several weeks, to the great consternation of the inhabitants. In September =
it seemed that quiet=20

was restored, when suddenly, on the night of the 28th, a fearful subterrane=
an noise was again=20

heard; fissures opened, and hot stones were thrown out. Part of the plain r=
ose up like  [Illustration:=20

JORULLO.]  an immense bubble to the height of sixteen hundred feet. Imagine=
 the astonishment=20

of the natives when morning showed them a mountain where the night before w=
as a level plain! It=20

almost seemed as though some magic had transported them to another land. Sm=
oke and ashes=20

spouted forth; five smaller cones were thrown up, the least of which was th=
ree hundred feet in=20

height. The plain was dotted with thousands of small conical mounds, called=
 by the natives=20

_hornitos_, or ovens. Each emitted vapor for a time; but at length all the =
upheavals, save Jorullo,=20

ceased action, though the plain remained so hot as to be uninhabitable for =
many years. Jorullo=20

continued to throw out lava several months, and has been in more moderate a=
ction ever since.  In=20

some respects the terrible outbreak of Skaptar Jokul has been several times=
 exceeded. While=20

almost alone in the immense quantity of lava thrown out, we have seen that =
great streams of lava=20

are not accompanied by the most violent explosions. In the number of lives =
destroyed, Skaptar=20

has also been exceeded; but if Iceland had been as densely populated as Ire=
land, which it equals=20

in area, the convulsion might have destroyed half a million or more.  One o=
f the best examples of=20

the force of steam on a smaller scale is seen in the eruptions of volcanoes=
, is to be found in the=20

geysers of Iceland. These lie in a strip of ground one hundred yards wide a=
nd about a quarter of a=20

mile in length. The ground is dotted with numerous dark apertures and conic=
al mounds, from=20

which clouds of steam ascend continually. Of these the Little Geyser is no =
longer active, being=20



merely a pool of still, hot water. The Great Geyser is periodically active,=
 and the Strokr, or Churn,=20

may be excited at any time by throwing a=20


_
1795 or 96, made an attempt to force its cultivation in the province of Bul=
acan, but forgot, as one=20

of their own officers naivement observes, "Que no habia compradores ni cons=
umidores"--that=20

there were neither consumers or customers for it! It of course fell to the =
ground, and in the next=20

passage of the same work, the Indian is partly blamed for it!  The cultivat=
ion of cotton is as yet but=20

very partial. It is of the herbaceous species, of a very fine quality, almo=
st equalling the Bourbon,=20

but excessively adherent to the grain: so much so indeed, that none of the =
attempts to separate it=20

from the seed by machinery have hitherto succeeded; the grains passing thro=
ugh the rollers, and=20

staining the cotton. It is cleared by the natives by means of a hand-mill, =
very clumsy in its=20

construction, and performing so little work, that the cleaning costs six do=
llars per pekul.  The=20

principal part of the cotton comes from the province of Ylocos, where large=
 quantities of stuffs are=20

manufactured. The brown cotton, for which a prize was offered in 1818 by th=
e Society of Arts,=20

grows in great quantities, and is manufactured into durable cloths and blan=
kets. The prices of=20

agricultural labour vary from 1 rial [85] per day near Manila to 3/4 and 1/=
2 rial in the provinces--a=20

plough with two buffaloes and a man, 2 1/2 rials. The workmen, like day lab=
ourers in all countries,=20

are often "looking for sunset;" but when allowed task work, are willing and=
 industrious. A plough=20

will go over rather more than a loan [86] of ground in a day--about a quini=
on in three months.  Of=20

the produce of any given cultivation, it is difficult to speak with any deg=
ree of correctness:=20

calculations of this kind are difficult to make amongst a people labouring =
each for himself, and all=20

for the wants of the day: for, unaccustomed to generalize, each gives his o=
wn as the average, and=20

hence the discrepancy which every person must have remarked who has had occ=
asion to make=20

inquiries of this description in half civilized countries, where a main poi=
nt, the value of the=20

labourer's time, and of that of his animals, is invariably left out, as is =
also the difference of work for=20

himself and for a master. The tables given at the conclusion of Comyn's wor=
k are, as far as=20

regards the vicinity of the capital, very erroneous. They are also very def=
icient in many points. [87]=20

The following is a much nearer approximation.  A quinion of land requires f=
our ploughings and=20

three harrowings, say six ploughings in all.                               =
                                  Ds. Rs.  Now=20

l, buffaloes, &c. for the=20

wear of which no estimate is made.  The 150 pilones of sugar, each weighing=
 about 150 lbs.=20

gross, will produce the refiner who has purchased them about 100 piculs of =
sugar, of which=20

 never do any damage, the quantity of water=20

thrown out being of no consequence. The water holds in solution a vast quan=
tity of silicious matter,=20

which is deposited around the mouth of the geyser, forming sometimes a sauc=
er-shaped basin,=20

sometimes a nippleshaped mound. From the rate at which the deposits are mad=
e, it is estimated=20

that the Great Geyser is about ten hundred and sixty years old.  One of the=
 most tremendous=20

outbursts of which we have any authentic account occurred in the island of =
Sumbawa. It is one of=20

the Molucca islands; and the mountain from which the outbreak occurred is c=
alled Tomboro.=20



[Illustration: GEYSER.]  =E2=80=9CThis eruption commenced on the 5th of Apr=
il, 1815, but was most terrific=20

on the 11th and 12th of that month; nor did it cease entirely until some ti=
me in the following July.=20

The explosion so much resembled the firing of heavy cannon at a distance th=
at the people of=20

many vessels at sea supposed there was a great naval engagement within hear=
ing, but could not=20

imagine what nations were engaged.  =E2=80=9CThe commanders of some ships, =
and several English forts,=20

gave orders to prepare for battle, though they were several hundred miles d=
istant from the=20

mountain. At Sumatra these tremendous explosions were distinctly heard, tho=
ugh not nearer than=20

nine hundred and seventy miles from Tomboro. They were also heard at Ternat=
e, in the opposite=20

direction from Sumatra, at the distance of seven hundred and twenty miles f=
rom the mountain.=20

=E2=80=9CSo immense in quantity was the fall of ashes, that at Bima, forty =
miles from the mountain, the roof=20

of the English resident=E2=80=99s house was crushed by the weight, and many=
 other houses in the same=20

town were rendered uninhabitable from the same cause. At Java, three hundre=
d miles distant, the=20

air was so full of ashes that from this cause, at mid-day, it is said, the =
darkness was so profound=20

that nothing like it had ever before been experienced during the most storm=
y night.  =E2=80=9CAlong the=20

coast of Sumbawa the sea was covered with floating lava, intermixed with tr=
ees and timber, so=20

that it was difficult for vessels to sail through the mass. Some captains, =
though at a long distance=20

at sea, mistook this mass for land, and sent out their boats in order to as=
certain the safety of their=20

situations. The sea, on this and the neighboring coast, rose suddenly to th=
e height of twelve feet,=20

in the form of immense waves, and, as they retired, swept away trees, timbe=
r, and houses with=20

their inhabitants. All the vessels lying near the shore were torn from thei=
r anchoring and cast upon=20

the land. Violent whirlwinds carried into the air, men, horses, cattle, tre=
es, and whatever else was=20

in the vicinity of the mountain. Large trees were torn up by the roots and =
carried into the sea. But=20

the most calamitous part of the account still remains; for such were the tr=
emendous effects of the=20

burning lava--the overflowing of the sea, the fall of houses, and the viole=
nce of the whirlwind, that,=20

out of twelve thousand inhabitants on this island, only twenty-six individu=
als escaped with their=20

lives, all the rest being destroyed in one way or another.  =E2=80=9CThe wh=
ole island was completely=20

covered with ashes, or other volcanic matter. In some places the bottom of =
the sea was so=20

elevated as to make shoals where there was deep water before; and in others=
, the land sunk down=20

and was overflown by the sea. Adding those who were killed on other islands=
, the total death roll=20

was over twenty thousand.=E2=80=9D  This entire region is one of wonderful =
activity. Mount Api, in the island=20

of Banda, in the same group, has had twelve violent eruptions in two hundre=
d and thirty-four=20

years; and, indeed, it is hardly ever really quiet. The volcano of Abo, in =

are far from what this statement appears to give, from various reasons, of =
which the chief are, the=20

heavy capital sunk in buildings, interest on advances, &c. and from a want =
of knowledge, the=20

enormous waste of labour in the process. A glance at this may give an idea =
of what trade is at=20

these antipodes of burying a large number of villages in cinders, covering =
extensive areas of forest=20

and plain, and destroying many thousands of people. This same volcano burst=
 forth suddenly in=20

March, 1856, vomiting torrents of mud, streams of lava, and clouds of ashes=
 and scoria, doing=20

almost as much mischief as on the former occasion. In the island of Timor, =
a gigantic volcano,=20

long known as the Peak, began a violent eruption in 1638. When the convulsi=
on was over the=20

mountain had disappeared; partly blown away, partly sunken, and the site is=
 to this day covered by=20

a great lake.=20


_
I have termed the process "refining;" it should rather be called claying an=
d sorting--and it is as=20

clumsily managed as the ingenuity of man could well devise. The trade is pr=
incipally in the hands=20

of three or four capitalists; advances are made by these to brokers, the pr=
ovincial merchants, who=20

annually bring their produce to the capital in small vessels, [89] and to t=
he masters of coasting=20

traders, in which the sugar merchants have shares. These are made to a larg=
e amount, 80 to=20

100,000 dollars; and as the interest of this must at least run for six mont=
hs at 9 per cent. it forms a=20

heavy item. Losses and defaulters form another, say 1/2 per cent. in all 5 =
per cent.  The pilones=20

are delivered from November to May and June, and are received into extensiv=
e warehouses,=20

which are provided with large court-yards and terraced roofs. Here the uppe=
r part of the pilone is=20

cut off, and a quantity of manufactured sugar being pressed down on the top=
 of it, a thin layer of=20

the river mud is put on it; this is watered from time to time and changed o=
nce or twice, the pilone=20

standing on a small foot, with the small hole at its apex left open, throug=
h which the molasses=20

slowly drains, leaving the upper and broader part of the pilone of a fine w=
hite, gradually decreasing=20

in goodness to the bottom, where it is little more than molasses--the pilon=
e is then cut in two; the=20

darker part is put by as second quality (or reboiled), and the whiter porti=
on as firsts, of the sugar,=20

the care taken in the process, the kind of mud used, &c. About two piculs o=
f sugar from three=20

pilones is a fair average, when these are of a good size. That from the pro=
vince of Pampanga is by=20

far the best; it is produced from a small red cane [90] about four feet hig=
h, and of the thickness of=20

a good walking stick.  The sugar being thus clayed, is now to be mixed, pou=
nded, and dried. The=20

last process is performed by laying it on small mats in the sun, on the ter=
races and pavements of=20

the court-yards. On the slightest appearance of rain, it must be hurried un=
der cover, and brought=20

out again when this is past. So that in a manufacture of any size, when fro=
m 3 to 400 Chinese are=20

employed at 4 1/2 dollars per month, fully 1/3d of their labour is expended=
 on this operation alone.=20

The management of the rest requires no comment.  The cost of production of =
any of the other=20

articles cannot be estimated to any degree of correctness, from the very sm=
all scale on which they=20

are cultivated, and the limited knowledge of the writer of these remarks. T=
hose of Comyn are=20

erroneous.  The Indians are the principal and almost the only cultivators o=
f the soil, very few=20

Mestizos or Chinese [91] being engaged in it. The few Spaniards and other E=
uropeans who have=20

attempted it, have been obliged to abandon their attempts to form plantatio=
ns. These failures, or=20

rather determination to abandon their speculations (even when in a promisin=
g state), have arisen=20

from various causes; but the general one may be stated to be the very littl=
e security for life and=20

property, in a country such as has been described. This is with the major p=
art an insuperable=20

objection; for from the moment they are established, and known to possess m=
oney for the=20

payment of their workmen, they must be in expectation of an attack, and pre=
pared to defend=20

themselves; nor can they lie down at night free from the apprehension of se=
eing their=20

establishments in flames before morning! either from robbers, or from malic=
e of any individual who=20

may think himself aggrieved:--the impossibility of obtaining justice so gen=
erally experienced by the=20

Indians, and the many chances of escaping punishment, being strong induceme=
nts to the ill-

disposed to adopt these modes of revenge. To this it may be added, that eve=
n were the foreigner=20

to kill the most determined robber in the country, the circumstance of havi=
ng done so in defence of=20

his life and property, would by no means exonerate him from a fleecing by t=
he inferior officers of=20

justice, and from a long and tiresome process of depositions, declarations,=
 &c. during which his=20



affairs must be entirely neglected. [92]  In addition to this he must lay h=
is account with another=20

obstacle, and this none of the smallest--the chance of bad faith on the par=
t of those with whom he=20

is connected; a chance which by no means will diminish in proportion to his=
 success; for, let no=20

foreigner deceive himself on this head in Manila; if he cannot flatter as l=
ow, or bribe as high as his=20

adversary, his cause is lost by some means or other.  The Phillippines also=
 produce cacao of an=20

excellent quality, though not sufficient for their consumption, a large qua=
ntity being imported from=20

New Spain.  which possesses about fifty craters, half of them still active.=
 The heat and vapors=20

poured out, combined with the power of the sun, combine to make this one of=
 the most noted=20

tempest regions in the world. Nowhere else are such terrific thunder-storms=
 so common; and more=20

than twenty water spouts are sometimes seen at one time.  One of the most r=
emarkable eruptions=20

of modern times is that of Papandayang, in this island, which occurred in 1=
772. The mountain=20

burst forth suddenly, with a tremendous roaring. Cinders and ashes were alm=
ost insignificant.=20

Immense boulders were hurled about the neighboring regions. The mountain wa=
s veiled in a cloud=20

of glowing vapor. A tract of land seventeen miles long and seven miles wide=
, with over forty=20

villages, was swallowed up. Several thousand people perished. When the clou=
d finally vanished it=20

was found that four thousand feet of the upper portion of the mountain had =
been blown away. The=20

broad, ragged mass remaining was of little more than one-half the original =
height. Two other=20

mountains in the island were in action at the same time; while several inte=
rvening active cones=20

remained quiet. Mt. Guntur, in the same island, has had a number of violent=
 eruptions. The last,=20

occurring in 1800, sent forth in addition to lava streams, a torrent of whi=
te, acid, sulphurous mud,=20

which swept a populous and fertile valley, engulfing hundreds of men and an=
imals in its course.=20

We shall notice by and by a still more remarkable Javanese convulsion.  Tim=
e would fail were=20

details to be given of the numerous volcanoes of Sumatra and Celebes and th=
e adjacent islands,=20

or of the eruptions and boiling springs of New Zealand, or the towering con=
es of New Guinea, or of=20

the peaks of the Canary, Cape Verde and Azores. Let us notice briefly a few=
 of the more noted=20

volcanoes of America.  Our own land is free, for the most part, from such d=
isturbances; the only=20

recorded outbreaks being those of Rainier and St. Helens, in 1842. But in p=
rehistoric times it had=20

numerous volcanic areas. The Raton peaks in New Mexico once sent out lava s=
treams that spread=20

over the country between the Upper Arkansas and Canadian rivers; and St. He=
lens, Hood,=20

Edgecombe, Baker, Rainier, Fair Weather and Shasta, are cones well known to=
 the western=20

tourist. These, except Hood and Shasta, are still active.  But better known=
 examples of great=20

internal heat are found in the hot springs of different portions of the cou=
ntry; though these merely=20

show the existence of subterranean heat, and afford no conception of its po=
wer or violence. Quite=20

as famous is the famous geyser basin of the Yellowstone. Here is a region s=
urpassing greatly the=20

geyser district of Iceland, both in area, and in the number and power of th=
e geysers. The whole=20

region is pierced with fumaroles, around which sulphur and other minerals c=
rystalize in beautiful=20

forms; and steam jets break through the soil in countless places. Certain o=
f the geysers are=20

exceedingly periodic; and others, like the Strokr of Iceland, may be incite=
d to action at almost any=20

time by casting in earth or stones. The more powerful of these =E2=80=9Ctoy=
 volcanoes=E2=80=9D send water to a=20

height of four hundred feet.  In the southern portion of the continent and =
in South America we find=20

a region of remarkable activity. Central America has had several violent co=
nvulsions at a=20

comparatively recent period. The volcano of Las Virgines, in Lower Californ=
ia, had a great eruption=20



in 1746; but the country being sparsely peopled, little harm was done, and =
the fact of the eruption=20

was made known by the light and clouds seen from vessels at sea, and the as=
hes and cinders that=20

fell in the adjacent regions of Mexico.  If eruptions be measured by the vi=
olence of explosions,=20

[Illustration: THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.]  then the famous outburst of Cosequin=
a must rank=20

among the greatest, if not itself the greatest, that is known to history. T=
he narrative of its eruption,=20

as related by an eye-witness, seems almost beyond belief; but the facts are=
 too well authenticated.=20

The extent of the destruction of life, though certainly reaching many hundr=
eds, was never definitely=20

known. The personal narration serves to show the fearful impressions made u=
pon those who=20

experience such awful convulsions:  =E2=80=9CThe wonder to me is how any ma=
n could live through such a=20

burst as Cosequina=E2=80=99s in San Salvador. =E2=80=99Twas the 21st of Jan=
uary, 1835--as fine a morning as ever=20

was seen on earth. The Bay of Fonseca was smooth as silk; never a cloud in =
the sky. The lazy=20

folks of Playa Grande and Nagascolo were lying in the hammocks beside the d=
oors, smoking and=20

dozing, and not a soul had a notion of ill from any side on that sunny morn=
ing, which was to be the=20


_
quantities, the utmost the Phillippine Company have been able to procure be=
ing about 60,000 lbs.=20

in favourable years.  To these may be added the Abaca (Musa textilis), a sp=
ecies of plantain, from=20

which the beautiful fibres are procured known by that name. This is becomin=
g a very considerable=20

article of exportation, both raw, and manufactured into cordage. The native=
s also consume large=20

quantities of it in cordage, and as shirting cloth, into which a large port=
ion of the interior and finer=20

fibres are manufactured. Some of it is equal to the coarser sort of China g=
rass cloth. [93]  In Gogo,=20

[94] a gigantic climbing plant, whose trunk attains the size of a man's bod=
y, is another remarkable=20

production of these islands. Its branches being cut out into lengths, are c=
oarsely pounded and=20

dried in the sun: they are used as soap by all classes of people, the sapon=
aceous fluid which is=20

extracted from them being remarkably cleansing, and the fibres answering th=
e purpose of a brush.=20

It is also used in large quantities in washing the earth of rivers and stre=
ams, to separate the gold=20

from them. It is not cultivated, but exists in great abundance in the fores=
ts, in which are also the=20

sapan-wood (called Sibacao), the sandal, ebony, and vanilla. They abound in=
 gums and resins,=20

large portions of which are washed down by the torrents; but these are for =
the most part useless,=20

either from the ignorance of the natives, or from the impossibility of vent=
uring far in the interior.=20

Their timber is excellent, and in a country so covered with forests, of cou=
rse plentiful; but the want=20

of roads and other conveniences of transport, renders it, in Manila, rather=
 an expensive article.=20

The principal timber woods are, the "Mulave" [i.e., Molave], a compact, hea=
vy, yellowish wood,=20

and almost incorruptible, perhaps from the very great portion of tannin it =
contains. Tindalo, [95] a=20

hard wood, much resembling the iron-wood of the Brasils, and like it used f=
or screws, &c., &c.=20

when great hardness is required. "Betis," an excellent timber tree, which g=
rows to a very great=20

size, and for its durability is generally used for the main beams of church=
es, convents, and other=20

large buildings. The "Narra," of which there are two kinds, the white and r=
ed: this last is almost=20

equal to mahogany in polish and durability. Banaba, a red wood resembling c=
edar; and many=20

others of equal goodness. Of these the Banaba and Mulave are most used in s=
hipbuilding, the first=20

for planking, and the last for the framework. For masts, the Manga-chapuy a=
nd Palo-maria are=20

generally used: the last is equal or superior to pine, both in strength and=
 lightness.  Their forests=20

are not infested with those ferocious animals which are the terror of those=
 of other Asiatic=20

countries. The and smoked and dozed like worthless cusses, as they are; and=
 most of =E2=80=99em, no=20

doubt, had full in sight the big mountain on t=E2=80=99other side the gulf.=
 They=E2=80=99d nigh forgot to call it a=20

volcano. Not for a thousand years, as the Indians told, had smoke or mischi=
ef come from that hill;=20

they=E2=80=99d ha=E2=80=99 laughed silly any one as had talked danger from =
Cosequina.  =E2=80=9CAt ten o=E2=80=99clock that=20

morning that mountain burst out again, and in a fury such as never yet was =
known in the upper=20

world--no, nor ever will be again, as _I_ believe, till the last day. Sudde=
nly it burst out--not=20

muttering beforehand, nor smoking--but crash! all on the moment, as if to r=
emind men what evil=20

power was yet left in nature to destroy them. At ten o=E2=80=99clock that d=
ay the voice of the mountain was=20

heard after one thousand years=E2=80=99 silence--in such a thunderous roar =
was it heard that beast and=20

bird fell dead with the sound alone, and great cliffs pitched headlong into=
 the sea! There=E2=80=99s=20

thousands still alive to witness. For a while the streets of Playa Grande a=
nd Nagascolo must have=20

seemed like streets of the dead; for every soul was stunned. Folks were lyi=
ng in their hammocks=20

or on the floor, motionless and senseless as corpses. The sky was still bri=
ght and blue, but on the=20

mountain side was a cloud like ink, which rolled down like a cap to the foo=
t. Naught afterwards=20



seemed so horrible as the sudden heaping of that jet black mound in the pla=
ce of the sunny, green=20

hill.  =E2=80=9CBut it didn=E2=80=99t long offend any man=E2=80=99s sight--=
over heaven and sea the cloud opened and spread.=20

Lightning and thunders burst from the heart of the ocean, and sheets of fla=
me glared luridly the=20

sides of Cosequina. The darkness spread so quick, that at Leon, two hundred=
 miles away, they=20

were lighting the church candles within an hour after the outbreak. But can=
dles, nor torches, nor=20

houses aflame couldn=E2=80=99t disperse that darkness. For three days no so=
ul in Leon saw another=E2=80=99s face,=20

nor ventured out but to the howling churches, to grovel there. Night dragge=
d after night, but no day=20

shone over the land. A lighted torch could not be seen at arm=E2=80=99s len=
gth! The ashes fell softly and=20

silently, till buildings crushed down headlong with the weight. Tigers were=
 in the churches, and=20

panthers entered house doors in search of companionship and protection. Hun=
dreds committed=20

suicide in their madness, and hundreds more became simple for life. Men=E2=
=80=99s faces were blistered=20

by the hot winds; the paint fell from the statues; the crash of falling, an=
d the faint light of burning=20

houses doubled the horror of darkness. Such a time as that was never seen o=
n earth since the=20

plague of Egypt, I guess!  =E2=80=9CBut of course the most awful work was a=
round the Gulf of Fonseca.=20

The water rose in waves twenty feet high, dashed over the Estero, and swept=
=20


_
and rhinoceros are unknown: the wild buffalo and hog are the only ones of w=
hich the native has=20

any dread. These attain an enormous size, but are not mischievous, unless p=
rovoked. The dried=20

flesh and hides of these animals, as well as of deer and wild cattle, which=
 are in immense=20

numbers, form a considerable article of trade amongst the natives, the "tap=
pa" or dried flesh being=20

used for food, and the hides for exportation.  Their serpents, however, att=
ain an enormous size:=20

the largest are those of the Boa species (Constrictor), and will devour a h=
orse or a cow at a meal.=20

[96] Of this genus there is one variety very beautifully marked, which freq=
uents the houses, and is=20

called by the Spaniards (Culebra casera), the house snake, [97] and by the =
Indians "Sawa." These=20

are often seen from 10 to 12 feet in length, but are very harmless. Few hou=
ses are without one or=20

more of them in the cellars, stables, &c. but they are seldom disturbed, as=
 they are said to devour=20

rats and other noxious animals; though, when these fail them, they attack f=
owls, or even goats.=20

They form a favourite article of food with the Chinese, who keep them in ja=
rs to fatten, and the=20

Indians may be often seen carrying them through the streets for sale.  Of o=
ther varieties they have=20

great numbers; some of which, as the "dahun palay," or leaf of rice, of a d=
eep green and yellow,=20

which frequents the rice fields, and the "mandadalag," or whip-snake, are e=
xcessively venomous:=20

accidents from these animals are not, however, very frequent; from whence i=
t may be concluded,=20

that the superstition of the natives has greatly exaggerated the number of =
venomous ones: and=20

this may be the more readily inferred, not only from their excessively supe=
rstitious character, and=20

the common custom of all nations in this particular; but also from the thou=
sand ridiculous fables=20

told by them of the cameleon, which is very common in the woods, and perfec=
tly harmless. The=20

Indian name for it is "Ynyano."  Of minerals they have an inexhaustible sup=
ply: gold is found in=20

almost all the streams, and even in the sands of the shores of the Bay afte=
r blowing weather: no=20

mines of it have as yet been wrought, though they are known to exist. The q=
uantity obtained by the=20

rude efforts of the natives merely washing the off the towns of Playa Grand=
e and Nagascolo, slick=20

as a prairie fire. Scarce a soul escaped for twenty miles about. The cattle=
 crushed over the=20

barrancas in search of water, and were destroyed in herds of thousands at a=
 time; for none could=20

see, nor hear, nor breathe. Rivers were dried by the heat, and choked with =
ashes; forests burned=20

up; the very grass withered throughout the whole length and breadth of Nica=
ragua, and hasn=E2=80=99t=20

sprung since. _Sacate_ (=E2=80=98a broad flag-like blade=E2=80=99) alone es=
caped, and the country which was once=20

the grazing land of Central America was ruined till eternity, for that busi=
ness.  =E2=80=9CDuring this time of=20

death, as they still call it, at Balize, one thousand miles away, the comma=
ndant called out the=20

garrison, and kept them under arms twenty-four hours, thinking all the navi=
es in the universe were=20

at action in the offing. There =E2=80=99twas too dark to see fifty yards oc=
eanwards. The roar of Cosequina=20

was heard miles around, spreading fear and perplexity. Four thousand miles =
in radius the ashes=20

fell; they lay on the roofs at San Francisco, California.  =E2=80=9CWell, t=
he mountain=E2=80=99s behaved like a decent=20

sort of powder-cask ever since. The fuse has always been burning and spitti=
ng; but you see=20

there=E2=80=99s a big consumption of power in such a burst, and I guess the=
 old machine wants to=20

recuperate awhile.=E2=80=9D  Those familiar with the terrific effects produ=
ced on the gunners by the=20

discharge of heavy artillery, can understand that the atmospheric concussio=
n produced by=20

tremendous volcanic explosions might kill large numbers of birds and small =
animals in the vicinity.=20

As to the distance to which ashes may be carried, a late eruption in Icelan=
d was announced by a=20

Professor in Germany long before any vessel brought the news. The atmospher=
e was unusually=20



full of dust which, on examining with a microscope, he pronounced to be pul=
verized Iceland lava.=20

The detonations of Cosequina were heard over the peninsula of Yucatan, alon=
g the shores of=20

Jamaica, eight hundred miles distant, and as far as Bogota in South America=
--nearly ten thousand=20

feet above the sea. Ashes fell on vessels twelve hundred miles westward at =
sea. Fortunately the=20

eruption was soon over.  Another unusual outbreak occurred in Central Ameri=
ca from the volcano=20

of Leon in 1867, beginning=20


_
certainly does not fall short of 4 to 500,000 dollars worth annually, as gr=
eat quantities are=20

expended in gilding for the churches, &c. &c.  Silver is also found, but in=
 small quantities. Virgin=20

copper is another produce of their mountains: pieces of it are frequently m=
et with in the torrents,=20

and on the shores of some of the islands (Masbate, Burias, and violent expl=
osions, which shook=20

the earth for a great distance. Immense quantities of black sand were then =
thrown out, and a=20

column of vapor and fire, filled with meteor-like specks, was hurled to a h=
eight of three thousand=20

feet. Closer observation showed the =E2=80=9Cspecks=E2=80=9D to be rocks fo=
ur or five feet in diameter, and=20

weighing thousands of pounds. The showers=20


_
rude ornaments, and even with utensils made from it.  Of iron they have who=
le mountains in the=20

very vicinity of Manila! (provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan), some of the o=
res yielding 75 per=20

cent. of metal, and of an excellent quality, this having been ascertained b=
y some Biscayan iron-

masters sent out for that purpose. It contains great numbers of magnets. Th=
ere are some=20

miserable establishments for working and smelting these ores, but on a very=
 small scale; they=20

have only produced cast iron articles, and those of an inferior quality. Th=
ey have no forging=20

machinery. [98]  Cinnabar, lead, and tin are supposed to exist; but of thes=
e last there is no=20

certainty.  Sulphur is found in the neighbourhood of the volcanoes in consi=
derable quantities, and=20

is an article of export to Bengal and other places: the principal part of i=
t is collected on the island of=20

Leyt, which is next to Samar on the south side of the strait of St. Bernard=
ino. It is collected on the=20

edges of numerous small of sand lasted three days, covering the earth for f=
ifty miles around. The=20

forest for leagues was scarred by the swift-falling showers of sand and sto=
nes; and for half a mile=20

around the cone the trees were leveled to the ground.  Central America cont=
ains twenty-nine=20

volcanoes, eighteen of which are active. Twenty cones are in sight from the=
 town of Leon. One=20

cone, Izalco, suddenly manifested signs of activity, but no eruption took p=
lace. But the sudden=20

heating rapidly melted the snow on the mountain, and the torrents of water =
inundated the town of=20

Guatemala, destroying thousands of dollars worth of property, besides many =
lives. The mountain=20

has since been known as =E2=80=9CAgua,=E2=80=9D or water.  South America is=
 noted for the frequency and extreme=20

violence of its earthquakes; of which more hereafter. Though possessing a g=
reater number of very=20

lofty volcanic cones than any other region, the direct effect of its erupti=
ons have not been so=20

disastrous as the results of many eruptions elsewhere.=20
