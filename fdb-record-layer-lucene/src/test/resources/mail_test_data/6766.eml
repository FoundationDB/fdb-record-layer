sentenced to the death penalty, as though they had been living under the pr=
otection of the holy=20

Christian Inquisition. Here is one case during the reign of Ramses III., qu=
oted by De Mirville from=20

Chabas.       The first page begins with these words: "From the place where=
 I am     to the people=20

of my country." There is reason to suppose, as one     will see, that the p=
erson who wrote this, in=20

the first personal     pronoun, is a magistrate making a report, and attest=
ing it before     men, after=20

an accustomed formula, for here is the main part of     this accusation: "T=
his Hai, a bad man, was=20

an overseer [or perhaps     keeper] of sheep: he said: 'Can I have a book t=
hat will give me     great=20

power?'... And a book was given him with the formulae of     Ramses-Meri-Am=
en, the great God,=20

his royal master; and he     succeeded in getting a divine power enabling h=
im to fascinate men.=20

He also succeeded in building a place and in finding a very _deep     place=
_, and produced men of=20

Menh [magical homunculi?] and ...     love-writings ... stealing them from =
the Khen [the occult=20

library     of the palace] by the hand of the stonemason Atirma, ... by    =
 forcing one of the=20

supervisors to go aside, and acting magically     on the others. Then he so=
ught to read futurity by=20

them and     succeeded. All the horrors and abominations he had conceived i=
n     his heart, he did=20

them really, he practised them all, and other     great crimes as well, suc=
h as _the horror_ [?] of all=20

the Gods and     Goddesses. Likewise let the prescriptions _great_ [_severe=
?_]     _unto death_ be=20

done unto him, such as the divine words order to     be done to him." The a=
ccusation does not stop=20

there, it specifies     the crimes. The first line speaks of a hand paralys=
ed by means of     the _men=20

of Menh_, to whom it is simply said, "_Let such an effect     be produced_,=
" and it is produced.=20

Then come the _great     abominations_, such as deserve death.... The judge=
s who had=20

examined him (the culprit) reported saying, "Let him die according     to t=
he order of Pharaoh, and=20

according to what is written in the     lines of the divine language."   M.=
 Chabas remarks:=20

Documents of this kind abound, but the task of analysing them all     canno=
t be attempted with the=20

limited means we possess.(467)   Then there is an inscription taken in the =
temple of Khous, the=20

God who had power over the elementaries, at Thebes. It was presented by M. =
Prisse d'Avenne to=20

the Imperial--now National--Library of Paris, and was translated first by M=
r. S. Birch. There is in it a=20

whole romance of Magic. It dates from the day of Ramses XII.(468) of the tw=
entieth dynasty; it is=20

from the rendering of M. de Rouge as quoted by De Mirville, that we now tra=
nslate it.       This=20

monument tells us that one of the Ramses of the twentieth     dynasty, whil=
e collecting at Naharain=20

the tributes paid to Egypt     by the Asiatic nations, fell in love with a =
daughter of the chief     of=20

Bakhten, one of his tributaries, married her and, bringing her     to Egypt=
 with him, raised her to the=20

dignity of Queen, under the     royal name of Ranefrou. Soon afterwards the=
 chief of Bakhten=20

dispatched a messenger to Ramses, praying the assistance of     Egyptian sc=
ience for Bent-Rosh,=20

a young sister of the queen,     attacked with illness in all her limbs.   =
   The messenger asked=20

expressly that a "wise-man" [an Initiate--Reh-     Het] should be sent. The=
 king gave orders that all=20

the     hierogrammatists of the palace and the guardians of the secret     =
books of the Khen should=20

be sent for, and choosing from among them     the royal scribe Thoth-em-Heb=
i, an intelligent man,=20

well versed in     writing, charged him to examine the sickness.      Arriv=
ed at Bakhten, Thoth-em-

Hebi found that Bent-Rosh was     possessed by a Khou (Em-seh-'eru ker h'ou=
), but declared=20

himself     too weak to engage in a struggle with him.(469)      Eleven yea=
rs elapsed, and the=20

young girl's state did not improve.     The chief of Bakhten again sent his=
 messenger, and on his=20

formal     demand Khons-peiri-Seklerem-Zam, one of the divine forms of     =
Chons--God the Son in=20



the Theban Trinity--was dispatched to     Bakhten....      The God [incarna=
te] having saluted=20

(_besa_) the patient, she felt     immediately relieved, and the Khou who w=
as in her manifested=20

forthwith his intention of obeying the orders of the God. "O great     God,=
 who forcest the phantom=20

to vanish," said the Khou, "I am thy     slave and I will return whence I c=
ame!"(470)   Evidently=20

Khons-peiri-Seklerem-Zam was a real Hierophant of the class named the "Sons=
 of God," since he=20

is said to be one of the forms of the God Khons; which means either that he=
 was considered as an=20

incarnation of that God--an Avatara--or that he was a full Initiate. The sa=
me text shows that the=20

temple to which he belonged was one of those to which a School of Magic was=
 attached. There=20

was a Khen in it, or that portion of the temple which was inaccessible to a=
ll but the highest priest,=20

the library or depository of secret works, to the study and care of which s=
pecial priests were=20

appointed (those whom all the Pharaohs consulted in cases of great importan=
ce), and wherein=20

they communicated with the Gods and obtained advice from them. Does not Luc=
ian tell his=20

readers in his description of the temple of Hierapolis, of "Gods who manife=
st their presence=20

independently?"(471) And further on that he once travelled with a priest fr=
om Memphis, who told=20

him he had passed twenty-three years in the subterranean crypts of his temp=
le, receiving=20

instructions on Magic from the Goddess Isis herself. Again we read that it =
was by Mercury himself=20

that the great Sesostris (Ramses II.) was instructed in the Sacred Sciences=
. On which Jablonsky=20

Bracieux de Pierrefonds? Well-a-day! how he has shrunk since he gave up the=
 name of Porthos!"=20

"This cannot be Monsieur Porthos," observed Planchet replying, as it were, =
to his master's=20

thoughts. "Monsieur Porthos was six feet high; this man is scarcely five." =
 "Nevertheless," said=20

D'Artagnan, "the people are bowing very low to this person."  As he spoke, =
he rode toward the tall=20

horse--to the man of importance and his valets. As he approached he seemed =
to recognize the=20

features of this individual.  "Jesu!" cried Planchet, "can it be?"  At this=
 exclamation the man on=20

horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air, and the two travelers could s=
ee, displayed in all their=20

brilliancy, the large eyes, the vermilion visage, and the eloquent smile of=
--Mousqueton.  It was=20

indeed Mousqueton--Mousqueton, as fat as a pig, rolling about with rude hea=
lth, puffed out with=20

good living, who, recognizing D'Artagnan and acting very differently from t=
he hypocrite Bazin,=20

slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off, so that =
the homage of the=20

assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun, which eclipsed the former l=
uminary.  "Monsieur=20

d'Artagnan! Monsieur d'Artagnan!" cried Mousqueton, his fat cheeks swelling=
 out and his whole=20

frame perspiring with joy; "Monsieur d'Artagnan! oh! what joy for my lord a=
nd master, Du Vallon de=20

Bracieux de Pierrefonds!"  "Thou good Mousqueton! where is thy master?"  "Y=
ou stand upon his=20

property!"  "But how handsome thou art--how fat! thou hast prospered and gr=
own stout!" and=20

D'Artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune h=
ad produced on the=20

once famished one.  "Hey, yes, thank God, I am pretty well," said Mousqueto=
n.  "But hast thou=20

nothing to say to thy friend Planchet?"  "How, my friend Planchet? Planchet=
--art thou there?" cried=20

Mousqueton, with open arms and eyes full of tears.  "My very self," replied=
 Planchet; "but I wanted=20

first to see if thou wert grown proud."  "Proud toward an old friend? never=
, Planchet! thou wouldst=20

not have thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well."  "So far so well," a=
nswered Planchet,=20

alighting, and extending his arms to Mousqueton, the two servants embraced =
with an emotion=20

which touched those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet wa=
s a great lord in=20

disguise, so highly did they estimate the position of Mousqueton.  "And now=
, sir," resumed=20



Mousqueton, when he had rid himself of Planchet, who had in vain tried to c=
lasp his hands behind=20

his friend's fat back, "now, sir, allow me to leave you, for I could not pe=
rmit my master to hear of=20

your arrival from any but myself; he would never forgive me for not having =
preceded you."  "This=20

dear friend," said D'Artagnan, carefully avoiding to utter either the forme=
r name borne by Porthos=20

or his new one, "then he has not forgotten me?"  "Forgotten--he!" cried Mou=
squeton; "there's not a=20

day, sir, that we don't expect to hear that you were made marshal either in=
stead of Monsieur de=20

Gassion, or of Monsieur de Bassompierre."  On D'Artagnan's lips there playe=
d one of those rare=20

and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul--t=
he last trace of=20

youth and happiness that had survived life's disillusions.  "And you--fello=
ws," resumed=20

Mousqueton, "stay near Monsieur le Comte d'Artagnan and pay him every atten=
tion in your power=20

whilst I go to prepare my lord for his visit."  And mounting his horse Mous=
queton rode off down the=20

avenue on the grass at a hand gallop.  "Ah, there! there's something promis=
ing," said D'Artagnan.=20

"No mysteries, no cloak to hide one's self in, no cunning policy here; peop=
le laugh outright, they=20

weep for joy here. I see nothing but faces a yard broad; in short, it seems=
 to me that nature herself=20

wears a holiday garb, and that the trees, instead of leaves and flowers, ar=
e covered with red and=20

green ribbons as on gala days."  "As for me," said Planchet, "I seem to sme=
ll, from this place,=20

even, a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat, and to see the scullion=
s in a row by the=20

hedge, hailing our approach. Ah! sir, what a cook must Monsieur Pierrefonds=
 have, when he was=20

so fond of eating and drinking, even whilst he was only called Monsieur Por=
thos!"  "Say no more!"=20

cried D'Artagnan. "If the reality corresponds with appearances I am lost; f=
or a man so well off will=20

never change his happy condition, and I shall fail with him, as I have alre=
ady done with Aramis."=20

11. Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness.   D'Artagnan passed thro=
ugh the iron gate=20

and arrived in front of the chateau. He alighted as he saw a species of gia=
nt on the steps. Let us=20

do justice to D'Artagnan. Independently of every selfish wish, his heart pa=
lpitated with joy when he=20

saw that tall form and martial demeanor, which recalled to him a good and b=
rave man.  He ran to=20

Porthos and threw himself into his arms; the whole body of servants, arrang=
ed in a semi-circle at a=20

respectful distance, looked on with humble curiosity. Mousqueton, at the he=
ad of them, wiped his=20

eyes. Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend.  "Ah! how delightful to=
 see you again, dear=20

friend!" he cried, in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a =
bass, "you've not then=20

forgotten me?"  "Forget you! oh! dear Du Vallon, does one forget the happie=
st days of flowery=20

youth, one's dearest friends, the dangers we have dared together? On the co=
ntrary, there is not an=20

hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory."  "Yes, yes,=
" said Porthos, trying=20

to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone. =
"Yes, we did some fine=20

things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel.=
"  And he heaved a=20

sigh.  "Under any circumstances," he resumed, "you are welcome, my dear fri=
end;=20


_
(Ammon)--whence he thinks our "Amen" is derived--was a real evocation to th=
e light.(472)  In the=20

Papyrus Anastasi, which teems with various formulae for the evocation of Go=
ds, and with=20

exorcisms against Khous and the elementary demons, the seventh paragraph sh=
ows plainly the=20

difference made between the real Gods, the Planetary Angels, and those shel=
ls of mortals which=20

are left behind in Kama-loka, as though to tempt mankind and to puzzle it t=
he more hopelessly in=20

its vain search after the truth, outside the Occult Sciences and the veil o=
f Initiation. This seventh=20

verse says with regard to such divine evocations on my plain, which is a su=
perb tract of land, or=20

pursue the deer in my woods, which are magnificent. I have four harriers wh=
ich are considered the=20

swiftest in the county, and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twent=
y leagues around."=20

And Porthos heaved another sigh.  "But, first," interposed D'Artagnan, "you=
 must present me to=20

Madame du Vallon."  A third sigh from Porthos.  "I lost Madame du Vallon tw=
o years ago," he said,=20

"and you find me still in affliction on that account. That was the reason w=
hy I left my Chateau du=20

Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux. Poor Madame du Vallon=
! her=20


_
One must invoke that divine and great name(473) only in cases of     absolu=
te necessity, and=20

when one feels absolutely pure and     irreproachable.   Not so in the form=
ula of black Magic.=20

Reuvens, speaking of the two rituals of Magic of the Anastasi collection, r=
emarks that they=20

Undeniably form the most instructive commentary upon the _Egyptian     myst=
eries_ attributed to=20

Jamblichus, and the best pendant to that     classical work, for understand=
ing the thaumaturgy of=20

the     philosophical sects, thaumaturgy based on ancient Egyptian     reli=
gion. According to=20

Jamblichus, thaumaturgy was exercised by     the ministry of secondary geni=
i.(474)   Reuvens=20

closes with a remark which is very suggestive and is very important to the =
Occultists who defend=20

the antiquity and genuineness of their documents, for he says:       All th=
at he [Jamblichus] gives=20

out as theology we find as history     in our papyri.   But then how deny t=
he authenticity, the=20

credibility, and, beyond all, the trustworthiness of those classical writer=
s, who all wrote about=20

Magic and its Mysteries in a most worshipful spirit of admiration and rever=
ence? Listen to=20

Pindarus, who exclaims:       Happy he who descends into the grave thus ini=
tiated, for he knows=20

the end of his herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes." =
 "So you are free now, and=20

rich?"  "Alas!" groaned Porthos, "I am a widower and have forty thousand fr=
ancs a year. Let us go=20

to breakfast."  "I shall be happy to do so; the morning air has made me hun=
gry."  "Yes," said=20

Porthos; "my air is excellent."  They went into the chateau; there was noth=
ing but gilding, high and=20

low; the cornices were gilt, the mouldings were gilt, the legs and arms of =
the chairs were gilt. A=20

table, ready set out, awaited them.  "You see," said Porthos, "this is my u=
sual style."  "Devil take=20

me!" answered D'Artagnan, "I wish you joy of it. The king has nothing like =
it."  "No," answered=20

Porthos, "I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal, Monsieu=
r de Mazarin. Taste this=20

cutlet, my dear D'Artagnan; 'tis off one of my sheep."  "You have very tend=
er mutton and I wish=20

you joy of it." said D'Artagnan.  "Yes, the sheep are fed in my meadows, wh=
ich are excellent=20

pasture."  "Give me another cutlet."  "No, try this hare, which I had kille=
d yesterday in one of my=20

warrens."  "Zounds! what a flavor!" cried D'Artagnan; "ah! they are fed on =
thyme only, your hares."=20

"And how do you like my wine?" asked Porthos; "it is pleasant, isn't it?"  =
"Capital!"  "It is nothing,=20


_
Or to Cicero:       Initiation not only teaches us to feel happy in this li=
fe, but     also to die with better=20

hope.(477)   Plato, Pausanias, Strabo, Diodorus and dozens of others bring =
their evidence as to=20

the great boon of Initiation; all the great as  "Really?"  "Yes, a small de=
clivity to the south, yonder=20

on my hill, gives me twenty hogsheads."  "Quite a vineyard, hey?"  Porthos =
sighed for the fifth=20

time--D'Artagnan had counted his sighs. He became curious to solve the prob=
lem.  "Well now," he=20

said, "it=20


_
partially-initiated Adepts, share the enthusiasm of Cicero.       Does not =
Plutarch, thinking of what=20

he had learned in his     initiation, console himself for the loss of his w=
ife? Had he not     obtained=20

the certitude at the Mysteries of Bacchus that "the soul     [spirit] remai=
ns incorruptible, and that=20

there is a hereafter"?...     Aristophanes went even farther: "All those wh=
o participated in the=20

Mysteries," he says, "led an innocent, you; you are ill, perhaps? That heal=
th, which----"  "Excellent,=20

my dear friend; better than ever. I could kill an ox with a blow of my fist=
."  "Well, then, family affairs,=20

perhaps?"  "Family! I have, happily, only myself in the world to care for."=
  "But what makes you=20

sigh?"  "My dear fellow," replied Porthos, "to be candid with you, I am not=
 happy."  "You are not=20

happy, Porthos? You who have chateau, meadows, mountains, woods--you who ha=
