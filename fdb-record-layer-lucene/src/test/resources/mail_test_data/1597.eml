dracaena marginata to-morrow. But I could not refuse speaking to him, Mr. L=
eyton was so anxious about it."  "I wish you success," said Persis.  "Your =
wishes are stronger than your hopes, I take it. Bell is a thoroughly selfis=

left the door open, and the electricity switched on. They might change thei=

pes, I take it. Bell is a thoroughly selfish man, except as regards love fo=

ressed the _
close-fisted miller," said the curate; "yet, in our necessity, she thinks t=
hat a strong personal appeal=20

ought to be made. The almshouses of Wild Rose Hollow can be seen from the m=
ill; the object for=20

which we plead is directly before the eyes of this Bell."  Franks smiled an=
d shook his head: "Had=20

mere pity been enough to draw him out, the money would have been forthcomin=
g long ere this,=20

sir," said he. "Bat Bell has seen those cottages gradually falling to piece=
s year after year, and has=20

talked with the old folks in them; yet I've good reason to know that not so=
 much as a wisp of straw=20

for thatching has ever come from the mill. Pity isn't a cable strong enough=
 to move a nature like=20

that of Bat Bell."  The young minister looked perplexed, and passed his han=
d across his forehead.=20

"But, sir," continued Franks, "we know that the shortest road to every man'=
s heart is through=20

Heaven, and it's not for us to give up any work for God as hopeless. No dou=
bt the lady is right;=20

there had better be a personal appeal."  A light flush suffused the counten=
ance of the clergyman.=20

He avoided looking at Franks, and played uneasily with the light cane which=
 he held as he said,=20

speaking with evident effort, "I came to consult you about it. I am a compa=
rative stranger here; the=20

parishioners scarcely yet know me, and--and it's a new thing to me to ask f=
or money. I thought that=20

if you were to speak instead of me, Mr. Franks, the appeal would have bette=
r chance of being=20

successful."  Full before the mind of Claudius Leyton was his late encounte=
r with Nancy Sands,=20

and perhaps it was also remembered by the sailor, as he simply replied, "I =
can but try, sir."  An=20

expression of relief passed over the face of the youthful clergyman. His th=
anks were brief; but=20

when he almost instantly rose to take leave, he held out his hand to the sc=
hool-master, and his fair=20

small fingers closed on Ned's strong sunburnt hand with a kindly pressure, =
which told more than=20

his words. When the door had closed behind Mr. Leyton, Ned Franks thought, =
with a smile, "That=20

poor, shy young minister will sleep more soundly to-night from knowing that=
 he is not to be the one=20

to board the Enemy.  "I do not know what you came to find, but you have mad=
e me suffer horribly,"=20

said Maxine. "You have been very cruel to a woman who has done nothing to d=
eserve such=20

humiliation. All pleasure I might have taken in my diamonds is gone now. I =
shall never have a=20

peaceful moment--never be able to wear them joyfully. I shall have the thou=
ght in my mind that=20

people who look at me will be saying: 'Every woman has her price. There is =
the price of Maxine de=20

Renzie.'"  "You need have no such thought, Mademoiselle," the man protested=
. "We shall never=20

speak to anyone except those who will receive our report, of what we have h=
eard and seen in this=20

room."  "Won't you search further?" asked Maxine. "Since you seemed to expe=
ct something else--"=20

"You would not have had time to conceal more than one thing, Mademoiselle,"=
 said the policeman,=20

with a smile that was faintly grim. "Besides, this case was what you did no=
t wish us to find. You=20

are a great actress, but you could not control the dew which sprang out on =
your forehead, or the=20

beating of your heart when I touched the sofa, so I knew: I had been watchi=
ng you for that. There=20

has been an error, and I can only apologise."  "I don't blame you, but thos=
e who sent you," said=20

Maxine, letting me lead her to a chair, into which she sank, limply. "I am =
thankful you do not tell=20

me these diamonds are contraband in some way. I was not sure but it would e=
nd in that."  "Not at=20

all, Mademoiselle. I wish you joy of them. It is you who will adorn the jew=
els, not they you. Again I=20

apologise for myself and my companions. We have but done our duty."  "I hav=
e an enemy, who=20

must have contrived this plot against me," exclaimed Maxine, as if on a sud=
den thought. "It is said=20

that 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.' But what of a man who has be=
en scorned--by a=20

woman? He knew I wanted all my strength for to-night--the night of the new =
play--and he will be=20



hoping that this has broken me. But I will not be broken. If you would aton=
e, Messieurs, for your=20

part in this scene, you will go to the theatre this evening and encourage m=
e by your applause."  All=20

three bowed. The Commissary of Police,=20


_
beggar, even for the holiest cause."  On hearing the outer door close, Pers=
is returned to her=20

husband, and the babe, who had again fallen asleep, was gently replaced in =
his cradle.  "Persis,"=20

said the school-master, gayly, "I'm to go and try to draw money from the mi=
ller. I believe I might as=20

well try to draw money from the millstone. I doubt whether Bell would put d=
own half-a-crown to-

day, to murmured compliments. It was all very French, and after what had pa=
ssed, gave me the=20

sensation that I was in a dream.     CHAPTER VI   IVOR HEARS THE STORY  The=
y were gone.=20

They had closed the door behind them. I looked at Maxine, but she did not s=
peak. With her finger=20

to her lips she got up, trembling still; and walking to the door, she opene=
d it suddenly to look out.=20

Nobody was there.  "They=20
