them are unskilled. They aren't able to do half the work of the old men, an=

despair."  "You think some one here is causing dissensions and desertions a=
mong your men?"=20

"I'm sure of it! I've tried to ferret out who it is, but the foolish and st=
ubborn admiral's head.  He was=20

driven from England, to die at last, broken in heart, rank, and fortune, on=
 a West Indian island.  But=20

what further rejoicings in Canada!  What gratitude, what repeated Te Deums =
for the narrow=20

escape the colony had had from almost certain destruction!  General Hill ha=
d caused to be printed=20

beforehand, and took with him, a bundle of proclamations, calling upon the =
French=20


_
such he must be, keeps his identity well hidden."  Tom thought for a moment=
. Then he said:  "Mr.=20

Titus, with your permission, I'll see if I can find out about this for you.=
"  "Find out what, Tom?"=20

"What is causing the men to leave. I don't believe it's the scare about the=
 ten missing ones."  "Nor=20

do I. That's past and gone. But how are you going to get at the bottom of i=
t?"  "By keeping watch.=20

I've got nothing to do now for the next week. We've just set off a big blas=
t, and I've got the powder=20

for the following one all ready. The men will be busy for some time getting=
 out the broken rock.=20

Now what I propose to do is documents had been washed ashore, and were now =
distributed=20

amongst the people amidst derisive laughter.  So grateful did the Quebec fo=
lk feel to Heaven for=20

having preserved them from such peril, that they built a memorial in Our La=
dy of Victories, as the=20

church in the lower town of Quebec was called.  De Vaudreuil appealed to th=
e people to help him=20

in making yet stronger the fortifications of Quebec, and he did not appeal =
in vain.  Fifty thousand=20

cus poured into the Treasury for this purpose.  {163}  While Quebec and Can=
ada were thus saved,=20

by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Great Britain obtained cession of Acadia,=
=20


_
them until I can learn something.  "I can understand the language pretty we=
ll now, though I can't=20

speak much of it. I'll go in the tunnel every day and find out what's going=
 on."  "But you'll be=20

known, and if one of our men, or one who we suppose is one, turns out to be=
 a spy, he'll be very=20

cautious while you're in there."  "He won't know me," Tom said. "This is ho=
w I'll work it.  I'll go off=20

with Professor Bumper the next time he starts on one of his weekly expediti=
ons into the woods.=20

But I won't go far until I turn around and come back. I'll adopt some sort =
of disguise, and I'll apply=20

to you for work. You can tell Tim to put me on. You might let him into the =
secret, but no one else."=20

A few days later Tom was seen departing with Professor Bumper into the inte=
rior, presumably to=20

help look for the lost city. Mr. Damon was away from camp on business conne=
cted with the drug=20

concern, and Koku, to his delight, had been given charge of a stationary ho=
isting engine outside=20

the tunnel, so he would not come in contact with Tom. It was not thought wi=
se to take the giant into=20

the secret.  Then one day, shortly after Professor Bumper and Tom had disap=
peared into the=20

forest, a ragged and unkempt white man applied at the tunnel camp for work.=
 There was just the=20

barest wink as he accosted Mr. Titus, who winked in turn, and then the new =
man was handed over=20

to Tim Sullivan, as a sort of helper.  And so Tom Swift began his watch.   =
  Chapter XVII  The=20

Condor   Left to himself, with only the rather silent gang of Peruvian Indi=
ans as company, Tom=20

Swift looked about him.  There was not much active work to be done, only to=
 see that the Indians=20

filled the dump cars evenly full, so none of the broken rock would spill ov=
er the side and litter the=20

tramway. Then, too, he had to keep the Indians up to the mark working, for =
these men were no=20

different from any other, and they were just as inclined to "loaf on the jo=
b" when the eye of the=20

"boss" was turned away.  They did not talk much, murmuring among themselves=
 now and then,=20

and little of what they said was intelligible to Tom.  But he knew enough o=
f the language to give=20

them orders, the main one of which was:  "Hurry up!"  Now, having seen to i=
t that the gang of=20

which he was in temporary charge was busily engaged, Tom had a chance to lo=
ok about him. The=20

tunnel was not new to him. Much of his time in the past month had been spen=
t in its black depths,=20

illuminated, more or less, by the string of incandescent lights.  "What I w=
ant to find," mused Tom,=20

as he walked to and fro, "is the place where those Indians disappeared. For=
 I'm positive they got=20

away through some hole in this tunnel.  They never came out the main entran=
ce."  Tom held to=20

this view in spite of the fact that nearly every one else believed the cont=
rary--that the men had left=20

by the tunnel mouth, near which Tom happened to be alone at the time.  Now,=
 left to himself, with=20

merely nominal duties, and so disguised that none of the workmen would know=
 him for the trim=20

young inventor who oversaw the preparing of the blast charges, Tom Swift wa=
lked to and fro,=20

looking for some carefully hidden passage or shaft by means of which the me=
n had got away.=20

"For it must be well hidden to have escaped observation so long," Tom decid=
ed.  "And it must be a=20

natural shaft, or hole, for we are boring into native rock, and it isn't li=
kely that these Indians ever=20

tried to make a tunnel here.  There must be some natural fissure communicat=
ing with the outside=20

of the mountain, in a place where no one would see the men coming out."  Bu=
t though Tom=20

believed this it was another matter to demonstrate his belief. In the inter=
vals of seeing that the=20

natives properly loaded the dump cars, and removed as much of the debris as=
 possible, Tom=20

looked carefully along the walls and roof of the tunnel thus far excavated.=
  There were cracks and=20

fissures, it countries bordering Hudson Bay.  Forced to give up so much, ye=
t the French retained=20

Cape Breton, with the right to fortify it.  King Louis made great efforts t=
o get Nova Scotia back into=20



his power, but in vain.  Foiled in this, he well knew the value of Cape Bre=
ton, and here it was=20

resolved to erect a great fortress to dominate the whole seaboard of Nova S=
cotia and New=20

England.  In a very few years Cape Breton became the centre of intriguing g=
overnors and priests,=20

always in touch with the French population in Acadia to teach them to be di=
scontented and=20

dangerous to the English rulers.  Vaudreuil did not cease to govern Canada =
till his death in 1725.=20

He always clung to the hope of regaining Acadia; he always prevented the Ab=
enakis from making=20

peace with the colonists of New England, and encouraged them to attack the =
outlying settlements.=20

Vaudreuil still dreamed, as Frontenac had done before him, of France ruling=
 the whole of the great=20

north and west of the continent, and it was hard to see how that prize coul=
d be wrested from her.=20

As the eighteenth century wore on, the chain of great inland lakes were as =
French as those two=20

great rivers, the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi.  Little by little Frenc=
h priests and fur-traders=20

pushed their way through the wilderness, making peace with new tribes and f=
ounding forts at the=20

heads or junctions of important rivers.  Before Vaudreuil died, he saw all =
New France prospering=20

and in peace.  {164}  Profit was even wrested from calamity.  Once a great =
ship, _La Seine_,=20

bearing clothes and merchandise to Quebec and Montreal, had been captured a=
nd carried a prize=20

to England.  The loss had caused much distress in Canada, because up to thi=
s date the people=20

had not grown flax and hemp, and had spun no wool, and their clothing, ther=
efore, came across to=20

them from France.  In this emergency the Canadians, particularly the women,=
 were obliged to=20

show their ingenuity, and soon they began to weave coverings, blankets, and=
 even small carpets.=20

They found the fibre of a nettle would make good cloth, and the bark of the=
 white wood cotton-tree=20

was pressed into service.  Slowly but surely the industry grew, until there=
 were twenty-five different=20

branches of trade producing druggets, cloths, and linens.  The nuns commenc=
ed to make bunting=20

for their own dress, black serge for the priests, and blue serge for their =
pupils.  At first there were=20

no horses in Quebec or Montreal.  But at the beginning of the eighteenth ce=
ntury hundreds of=20

these animals were being bred, and to possess and train them became a passi=
on amongst the=20

young men.  The result was that many who had before been very skilful in th=
e use of snowshoes=20

soon grew lazy and drove about in sleighs.  This came to the notice of the =
Governor, who told=20

them that Canada could not afford to have her young men unaccustomed to sno=
w-shoes.  It was=20

by means of snow-shoes that they were able, even when a blizzard was blowin=
g, to move silently=20

and swiftly in time of war.  He issued a decree which forbade any {165} hab=
itant to own more than=20

two mares and one colt.  After a certain day any colonist possessing more w=
ould be visited by an=20

official ordered to kill the extra horses, and the order was carried out.  =
The population of Canada=20

had now grown to 50,000 souls.  As to life in the colony, we get an excelle=
nt picture from the=20

writings of Father Charlevoix, who visited Canada in 1720, and spent some t=
ime in making=20

personal observations.  He tells us that the country about Montreal was who=
lly unsettled by=20

Europeans excepting several fortified posts and block-houses, such as Front=
enac, Niagara,=20

Detroit, Michilimackinac, and other trading stations in the west. "In Quebe=
c," he wrote, "one finds=20

nothing but what is select and calculated to form an agreeable society.  A =
Governor-General, with=20

his staff, a high-born officer and his troops, an=20


_
superficial ones, as Tom ascertained by poking a long pole up into them.  "=
No getting out that=20

way," he said, as he met with failure after failure.  Once, while thus enga=
ged, he saw Serato, the=20

Indian foreman looking narrowly at him, and Serato said something in his ow=
n language which=20

Tom could not understand. But just then along came Tim Sullivan, who, grasp=
ing the situation,=20

exclaimed:  "Thot's all roight, now, Serri, me lad!" for thus he contracted=
 the Indian's name. "Thot's=20

a new helper I have, a broth of a bye, an' yez kin kape yer hands off him. =
He's takin' orders from=20

me!"  "Um!" grunted the Indian. "Wha for he fish in tunnel roof?" for Tom's=
 pole was one like those=20

the Indians used when, on off days, they emulated Izaak Walton.  "Fishin' s=
uperior council and=20

inferior court, a Commissary of Marines and other officers, and a Superinte=
ndent of Waters and=20

Forests, whose jurisdiction is certainly the largest in the world; merchant=
s in easy circumstances,=20

or at least living as if they were, a Bishop, a seminary, and three convent=
s.  "Other circles=20

elsewhere are as brilliant as those surrounding the Governor and Intendant.=
  On the whole, it=20

seems to me there are for all classes the means of passing the time agreeab=
ly.  Every one=20

contributes to his utmost, people amuse themselves with games and excursion=
s, using caleches in=20

summer, sledges and skates in winter. There is a great deal of hunting, for=
 many gentle folks have=20

no other resources for living in comfort.  The news from {166}=20
