  =E2=80=98The sixth reason is grounded on what is said in the sixth chapte=
r of the second book of the Misfortunes of great Men: =E2=80=98Res est vald=
e meritoria occidere tyrannum.=E2=80=99 To this I answer, That it must appl=
y only in cases where no other remedy can be had; and the conduct of our op=
ponent has been illegal and wicked.  =E2=80=98The seventh and two following=
 reasons are founded on the civil inflicted by a cutting instrument, the ex=
istence of a struggle may be indicated by incisions on the palm of the hand=
 or fingers or on the dorsum (see Fig 12). Such wounds would not be self-in=
flicted and would indicate a struggle with the murderer. Or if contusions o=
r ecchymoses indicating the form of the foot, fist, fingers, or finger-nail=
s are found on the face, neck, chest, forearm, or hand of the deceased, thi=
s again philodendron monstera many deeds which my lord of Orleans never tho=
ught of.  =E2=80=98The sixth reason is grounded on what is said in the sixt=
h chapter of the second book of the Misfortunes of great Men: =E2=80=98Res =
est valde meritoria occidere tyrannum.=E2=80=99 To this I answer, That it m=
ust apply only in cases where no other remedy can be had; and the conduct o=
f our opponent has been illegal and wicked.  =E2=80=98The seventh and two f=
ollowing reasons are founded on the civil inflicted by a cutting instrument=
, the existence of a struggle may be indicated by incisions on the palm of =
the hand or fingers or on the dorsum (see Fig 12). Such wounds would not be=
 self-inflicted and would indicate a struggle with the murderer. Or if cont=
usions or ecchymoses indicating the form of the foot, fist, fingers, or fin=
ger-nails are found on the face, neck, chest, forearm, or hand of the decea=
sed, this again _
him. For although his advocate styles him dean of the peers, it does not fo=
llow that he had any=20

authority over the defunct; for if so, he would have authority over the who=
le kingdom, and be equal=20

to the king. What though he be a peer? he has no power but over his own lan=
ds; and in so much=20

as he attributes to himself the power of another over the realm, he appropr=
iates to himself kingly=20

domination.  =E2=80=98His advocate has indeed alledged twelve reasons to pr=
ove that his lord might lawfully=20

put to death the duke of Orleans without orders from any one whatever. The =
three first are=20

founded on the declarations of three doctors in theology, and three others =
on the writings of three=20

moral philosophers,=E2=80=94three on the civil and sets it, as it were. The=
 murderer, therefore, cannot=20

imitate this grip, and an unsuccessful attempt to do so would indicate murd=
er. It should be borne in=20

mind that the weapon in the hand of the deceased may have been for the purp=
oses of defence;=20

therefore it is necessary to note whether the wounds on the body correspond=
 to those which could=20

be made by the weapon. Indeed, this fact is most important to note in all c=
ases of suspected=20

suicide where the weapon is found. If the weapon is not in the hand of the =
deceased, note=20

carefully where it lies. If death is due to a suicidal or accidental wound =
which is immediately or=20

very rapidly fatal, the weapon is generally found near the body. If so, it =
is well to note=20


_
drawn from the holy Scriptures.  =E2=80=98With regard to the first, taken f=
rom the writings of St Thomas=20

Aquinas, who says,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Quando aliquis aliquod dominium sibi pe=
r violentiam suscipit nolentibus=20

subditis, vel sine consensu communitatis et non est recursus ad superiorem =
per quem de tali=20

invasore judicium posset fieri, tunc qui ad liberationem patri=C3=A6 talem =
tyrannum occidit laudatur et=20

pr=C3=A6mium accipit.=E2=80=99 To this I reply, that it is no way applicabl=
e to the case; for my lord of Orleans=20

never intruded on any other=E2=80=99s domination by violence, nor did he at=
tempt to usurp the power and=20

authority of the king. I say, he never even thought of such a thing, as wil=
l more amply be shown in=20

the third part of my defence of him.  =E2=80=98I am therefore right in sayi=
ng, that Saint Thomas speaks of=20

him who may be proved a tyrant,=E2=80=94but my lord of Orleans was not one.=
 On this subject St Austin=20

proposes a question, whether it be lawful for a pilgrim to kill a robber, w=
ho is on the watch on the=20

highway? and from his conclusion it is apparent, that he does not think it =
lawful for any man to put=20

another to death without sentence of the law, as Henry de Gand afterward de=
termined.  =E2=80=98I shall=20

add, that supposing my lord of Orleans was such a person as our opponent de=
scribes him, but=20

which I deny, he had a safe resort to the king, when he was in good health =
and cheerful with the=20

queen and the princes of his blood,=E2=80=94none of whom would have hesitat=
ed to have personally=20

exposed himself in bringing to punishment the duke of Orleans, had he been =
proven guilty of=20

usurping the king=E2=80=99s authority. Most certainly, my late lord had too=
 good an understanding to=20

imagine he whether it has apparently fallen or been thrown or placed there.=
 If the relation of the=20

body and the weapon has been disturbed by moving either, the position of th=
e weapon as found=20

by the medical witness is of little value. In cases of suicide the weapon _=
may_ possibly be found at=20

some distance or even concealed, though this is exceptional. Thus Taylor[64=
6] states that the=20

razor in one instance was found shut at the side of the deceased, who had c=
ommitted suicide by=20

cutting his throat. In another instance the razor was found in the pocket o=
f the deceased, bloody=20

and closed. As a rule, the weapon is found lying at the side of a suicide i=
f it is not grasped in the=20

hand. If the weapon is far from the body and the wound was quickly fatal, e=
specially if the weapon=20

is hid or cannot be found, it is strongly presumptive of murder. If the wea=
pon is found near the=20

body it is well to note whether the edge is sharp or blunt, straight or ben=
t, or notched, as these=20

points may assist us in forming a judgment as to suicide or murder.  A weap=
on belonging to the=20

victim may be substituted by the murderer for the one really used, and the =
former may be placed=20

by the side of the body. Therefore the weapon found should correspond to th=
e wounds as to=20

length, depth, sharpness, etc., to be compatible with suicide.  Generally a=
 suicide foiled in the=20

attempt to take his life uses the same weapon over again if he persists in =
the attempt. But he may=20

not do so; on the contrary, if the first attempt was made with a knife, the=
 second may be made with=20

a pistol, etc. Several wounds by the same or different weapons cannot there=
fore be an absolute=20


_
and the king assured of successors.  =E2=80=98The second reason is founded =
on the authority of St Peter,=20

who says, =E2=80=98Subditi, estote regi quasi pr=C3=A6cellenti sive ducibus=
 tanquam ab eo missis ad vindictam=20

malefactorum, laudem vero bonorum quia h=C3=A6c est voluntas Dei.=E2=80=99 =
These words appear to me of no=20

weight in the  =3DThe presence of blood, hair, and other substances on the =
weapon=3D used, or=20

probably used, is a matter of some importance. Blood is not necessarily fou=
nd on the weapon=20

used to inflict a mortal wound, especially in the case of blunt instruments=
. In stab-wounds, too, the=20

vessels may be compressed by the=20


_
case; for it would seem that the Apostle would not that any duke should hav=
e dominion over a=20

whole kingdom, but solely in his own country: otherwise it would follow tha=
t Brittany, Berry, and the=20

other duchies within the realm, should obey the duke of Burgundy.=E2=80=94T=
he advocate has, therefore,=20

wrongfully perverted the holy Scripture to his purpose.  =E2=80=98His third=
 reason is drawn from what=20

Sabellicus says, in the fifteenth chapter of his third book, =E2=80=98Tyran=
no licet adulari quem licet=20

occidere.=E2=80=99 That is to say, It is lawful to flatter and deceive a ty=
rant who may legally be put to death;=20

but Sabellicus here speaks of such as have been proven and known for tyrant=
s.  =E2=80=98The fourth=20

reason is founded on what Aristotle says, in his book on the government of =
cities, That it is lawful,=20

and even praiseworthy, to slay a tyrant. But Aristotle alludes to a public =
tyrant; and such was not=20

my lord of Orleans, as I have before shown.  =E2=80=98The fifth reason is g=
rounded on the praise Tully, in=20

his book =E2=80=98de Officiis,=E2=80=99 gives to those who killed C=C3=A6sa=
r. To this I reply, that although Tully was a=20

man of great ability, he here speaks as an ill-wisher to C=C3=A6sar; for he=
 was always of the party, and=20

supported the cause of Pompey the rival as it were on withdrawal by the ela=
sticity of the skin and=20

by the clothing, except for a thin yellowish film. Thus it is that the firs=
t stab-wound shows no blood=20

on the outside of the clothes but only on the inside, but the outside of th=
e second is usually bloody=20

but may be but little so. To make sure whether or not there is blood on a k=
nife or other weapon it is=20

necessary to examine all the depressions on the instrument, as the blade it=
self may have been=20

washed, and only those traces of blood remain which are less accessible to =
cleaning by washing.=20

Blood coagulated on a blade indicates, as a rule, blood from a living anima=
l, but it may not do so.=20

Furthermore, it may be hard to distinguish between a thin layer or spots of=
 dried blood not=20

coagulated or coagulated and dried blood in a similar form.  If blood is no=
t found on a weapon, hair=20

and other substances which can be identified may be. This is especially the=
 case with blunt=20

weapons, on which, as we have seen, blood usually fails. A fragment of the =
weapon may break off=20

in the wound, as in stab-wounds, and may be identified as belonging to one =
in the murderer=E2=80=99s=20

possession.  =3DThe signs of a struggle=3D furnish important evidence, as t=
hey are not=20
