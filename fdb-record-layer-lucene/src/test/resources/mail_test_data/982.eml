philodendron monstera of various classes according to climate, so that the =
very nations born therein naturally differ in mental and physical conformat=
ion and qualities, we cannot hesitate to make our houses suitable in plan t=
o the peculiarities of nations and races, since we have the expert guidance=
 of nature herself ready to our hand.  I have now set forth the peculiar ch=
aracteristics of his wife at night.  Another characteristic is his fanatica=
l faith in the infallibility of science, and, above all, of everything writ=

object of life, and knows nothing of the doubts and disappointments that tu=
rn the hair of talent grey. He has a slavish reverence for authorities and =
a complete lack of philodendron monstera of various classes according to cl=

 suitable in plan to the peculiarities of nations and races, since we have =

rth the peculiar characteristics of his wife at night.  Another characteris=
tic is his fanatical faith in the infallibility of science, and, above all,=
 of everything written by the Germans. He believes in himself, in his prepa=
rations; knows the object of life, and knows nothing of the doubts and disa=
ppointments that turn the hair of talent grey. He has a slavish reverence f=
or authorities and a complete lack of _
change of temperature, and rendered torpid and motionless. It is therefore =
no wonder that man's=20

intelligence is made keener by warm air and duller by cold.  10. But althou=
gh southern nations=20

have the keenest wits, and are infinitely clever in forming schemes, yet th=
e moment it comes to=20

displaying valour, they succumb because all manliness of spirit is sucked o=
ut of them by the sun.=20

On the other hand, men born in cold countries are indeed readier to meet th=
e shock of arms with=20

great courage and without timidity, but their wits are so slow that they wi=
ll rush to the charge=20

inconsiderately and times overhear Nikolay's free use of our terminology, h=
e might perhaps=20

imagine that he was a learned man disguised as a soldier. And, by the way, =
the rumours of the=20

erudition of the University porters are greatly exaggerated. It is true tha=
t Nikolay knows more than=20

a hundred Latin words, knows how to put the skeleton together, sometimes pr=
epares the=20

apparatus and amuses the students by some long, learned quotation, but the =
by no means=20

complicated theory of the circulation of the blood, for instance, is as muc=
h a mystery to him now as=20

it was twenty years ago.  At the table in my study, bending low over=20


_
own devices. Such being nature's arrangement of the universe, and all these=
 nations being=20

allotted temperaments which are lacking in due moderation, the truly perfec=
t territory, situated=20

under the middle of the heaven, and having on each side the entire extent o=
f the world and its=20

countries, is that which is occupied by the Roman people.  11. In fact, the=
 races of Italy are the=20

most perfectly constituted in both respects--in bodily form and in mental a=
ctivity to correspond to=20

their valour. Exactly as the planet Jupiter is itself temperate, its course=
 lying midway between=20

Mars, which is very hot, and Saturn, which is very cold, so Italy, lying be=
tween the north and the=20

south, is a combination of what is found on each side, and her preeminence =
is well regulated and=20

indisputable. And so by her wisdom she breaks the courageous onsets of the =
barbarians, and by=20

her strength of hand thwarts the devices of the southerners. Hence, it was =
the divine intelligence=20

that set the city of the Roman people in a peerless and temperate country, =
in order that it might=20

acquire the right to command the whole world.  12. Now if it is a fact sits=
 Pyotr Ignatyevitch, my=20

demonstrator, a modest and industrious but by no means clever man of five-a=
nd-thirty, already=20

bald and corpulent; he works from morning to night, reads a lot, remembers =
well everything he has=20

read--and in that way he is not a man, but pure gold; in all else he is a c=
arthorse or, in other words,=20

a learned dullard. The carthorse characteristics that show his lack of tale=
nt are these: his outlook=20

is narrow and sharply limited by his specialty; outside his special branch =
he is simple as a child.=20

"Fancy! what a misfortune! They say Skobelev is dead."  Nikolay crosses him=
self, but Pyotr=20

Ignatyevitch turns to me and asks:  "What Skobelev is that?"  Another time-=
-somewhat earlier--I=20

told him that Professor Perov was dead. Good Pyotr Ignatyevitch asked:  "Wh=
at did he lecture=20

on?"  I believe if Patti had sung in his very ear, if a horde of Chinese ha=
d invaded Russia, if there=20

had been an earthquake, he would not have stirred a limb, but screwing up h=
is eye, would have=20

gone on calmly looking through his microscope. What is he to Hecuba or Hecu=
ba to him, in fact? I=20

would give a good deal to see how this=20
