[101] Perhaps much of this may be traced to the avaricious spirit of the ea=
rly adventurers, and to=20

the cruelties of the Buccaneers; and thus what might have been only a local=
, became from habit a=20

national principle; though "soy Cristiano viejo" [i.e., "I am an old-time C=
hristian"], was always the=20

surest passport amongst an intolerant people, with whom "filosofo" is yet a=
n epithet of reproach.=20

[102] Something of this is more or less visible in the colonial policy of a=
lmost all countries; but that=20

those have been the most flourishing who have acted on the broad and libera=
l principle of "Ubi=20

dives, ibi patria" [i.e., "where got-up volume, entitled "The Thanatophidia=
 of India"--and on looking=20

over the concise directions given by him for immediate use in the event of =
such an accident, I do=20

not see that we could possibly have done more than we did, considering the =
limited material we=20

had at our command. Perhaps, had it been a white man, with a strong constit=
ution, he would have=20

pulled through; for the settled conviction that he was doomed, doubtless ac=
celerated the death of=20

the black boy; but the action of the poison is so rapid, that most cases te=
rminate fatally.  Two=20

instances I know of, in which the patient recovered.  The first was an Iris=

_
but correct estimate, not only of the bulk of colonial adventurers, but of =
mankind in general), will=20

scarcely be questioned. The Havannah is a splendid example. In 1780, strang=
ers were rigorously=20

prohibited, or at least loaded with restrictions; an enormous smuggling tra=
de was carried on, and=20

the island did not pay its own expenses. In 1820, when the prohibitory syst=
em had been long=20

annihilated, and strangers allowed free intercourse and establishment, its =
trade had increased a=20

hundred-fold; and not only did it suffice for its own, much more expensive =
establishments; but,=20

both directly and indirectly, contributed large sums to the mother country,=
 though at the first epoch,=20

the profits on colonial capital were at least 30 per cent. more than at the=
 last.  [103] "We have=20

been told, that we must not sit under the shade of our own vines and olives=
! that we must not=20

pluck the fruits from the trees which our fathers have planted!--and why--l=
est the merchants of=20

Cadiz should be deprived of their profits in supplying us with wine and oil=
."--From a Chilian=20

manifesto, published soon after the declaration of independence.  [104] A v=
aluable study of "The=20

Spanish colonial system" is furnished by the chapter under that heading in =
Wilhelm Roscher's=20

Kolonien, Kolonial-politik und Auswanderung (Leipzig, 1885), an English tra=
nslation of which is=20

published by Prof. E. G. Bourne (New York, 1904), with some additional anno=
tations. See also=20

"The colonial kingdom of Spain," in Helmolt's History of the World (New Yor=
k, 1902), which is=20

praised by Bourne as an excellent and scholarly study by Konrad Hbler; but =
unfortunately the=20

American edition of that work does not name the author of the above section=
. Bourne also treats=20

this subject in a chapter of his Spain in America (New York, 1904), pp. 220=
-242, and at pp. 355,=20

356, gives a helpful list of authorities thereon.--Eds.  [105] "Ecclesiasti=
cal foundations and obras=20

extreme of the Peninsula to the other, and even to the farthest boundaries =

walked at once to the fence, put his hand on a post, and severed the wounde=
d member with his=20

sickle.  Irishman-like, he forgot to move the sound fingers out of the way,=
 and two of them shared=20

the fate of their injured companion.  Paddy walked into the nearest townshi=
p, had his wounds=20

dressed, and felt no inconvenience from the venom.  Under the soubriquet of=
 "Three-fingered=20

Tim," this individual may frequently be met with at Sydney, and, for a glas=
s of grog, will be=20

delighted to recount the whole affair, with the richest of Milesian brogues=
.  The second case was=20

that of a woman.  She was going from the hut to the fireplace, when she tro=
d on a snake, which bit=20

her just below the joint of the little toe; for, like Coleridge's Christabe=
l--    "Her blue-veined feet=20

unsandall'd were."  She was in a terrible position; her husband, and the ot=
her man for whom she=20

acted as hut-keeper, had both gone out with their flocks some hours previou=
sly, and there was=20

nobody about but a poor half-witted lad, who hung about the place doing odd=
 jobs.  She was a=20

resolute woman, and made up her mind how to act, in far less time than it t=
akes me to set it down=20

on paper. Coo-ehing for the lad, she went into the hut, and came out again =
with a sharp tomahawk=20

and an axe.  "Take this," she said, handing the latter to the boy, "and str=
ike hard on the back of it=20

when I tell you."  Thus speaking, she placed her foot on a log of wood, adj=
usted the keen edge of=20

the tomahawk so that when struck it would sever the toe and the portion of =
the foot containing the=20

bite, and, holding the handle of the tomahawk steady as a rock, with firm d=
etermination gave the=20

words--  "Now, Jim, strike!"  It needed three blows from the back of the ax=
e to complete the=20

operation, for the poor lad grew frightened at the sight of the blood; but =
the undaunted woman=20

encouraged him, nerved him to a fresh trial, and guided the tomahawk as coo=
lly as if she were=20



cutting up a piece of beef, until the shocking task was completed.  With Ji=
m's assistance, she then=20

bound up the foot to arrest the bleeding, and, accompanied by him, rode=20

greatest grandeur, the acts of Christian piety are seen in various foundati=
ons. These include not=20

only hermitages, confraternities, memorials, charitable foundations, and ch=
aplaincies,--which by=20

themselves alone made a total of enormous wealth--but more pretentious esta=
blishments, as=20

convents, cathedrals, parish churches, and colleges; and any person will be=
 surprised at those=20

which were supported by some towns which in their present condition are red=
uced in population=20

and poor. Larruga in his memoirs states that Toledo had 25 parish churches =
and its cathedral, 39=20

convents, 14 hospitals, and four colleges, in all, 83 foundations. Salamanc=
a had more; Cuenca=20

had 31, Avila 31, Almagro 17, and so with the other cities of Castilla." Am=
ong these pious gifts=20

were "the exchanges of Barcelona, Sevilla, and Valencia, the colleges of Sa=
lamanca, that of Santa=20

Cruz of Valladolid," and many cathedrals and convents. (Arias y Miranda, Ex=
amen crtico-histrico,=20

p. 139.)--Eds.  [106] At one of them (I believe that of Santa Clara), the s=
culls of the seven founders=20

are placed on the table at which the trustees recovered.  In these instance=
s the reader will see that=20

the measures taken were both prompt, and such as would require more nerve t=
han is possessed=20

by the ordinary run of mortals.  In the above cases, also, the bitten part =
was capable of being=20

removed; but for a bite on the wrist, had such an extreme measure as immedi=
ate dismemberment=20

been performed, the cure would have been as fatal as the disease.  Poor Dun=
more was terribly cut=20

up at the premature death of his follower; Lizzie, having smothered her hea=
d with fluffy feathers=20

from some cockatoos that had been roasted for supper, employed herself in c=
hanting a most weird=20

kind of dirge over the body, to which she beat a species of accompaniment o=
n the bottom of a pint=20

pot; while Ferdinand, by Dunmore's directions, had set to work to strip a s=
heet of bark off a tea-

tree, to act as a rude coffin.  A great difficulty now presented itself, fo=
r we had no tools whatever,=20

and how could we dig a grave?  In such hard ground, knives would make no im=
pression, and the=20

body must be buried deeply, or it would be rooted up by the dingoes, whose =
howl we could plainly=20
