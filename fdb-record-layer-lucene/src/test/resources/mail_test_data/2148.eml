that the people interested may organize as they decide to improve their res=
pective rivers. When so=20

improved, it will become practicable to more effectually drain the district=
 by lateral works.  Illinois=20

being so generally level, and much of our black soil resting on clay, here =
is to be the favorite field=20

for the ditcher and tile-maker. Invention has an inviting field, and alread=
y foreshadows rich results.=20

Your association, though a private one, touches the public interest very br=
oadly. You reveal and=20

make possible new sources of wealth, which promises to agriculture a new er=
a of development.=20

You may do much to settle true principles and proper public policy, so that=
 this great drainage=20

enterprise may move along harmoniously. The law-maker and the tile-maker ar=
e necessary factors=20

in this grand march of improvement.  Other valuable papers were read which =
we shall take=20

occasion to publish at some future time.     BETTER MANAGEMENT NEEDED.   A =
little=20

forethought on a farm is a good thing. It saves time, money, and much of th=
e vexation that is liable=20

to come without it. Like the watchman on a ship a good farmer must always b=
e looking ahead. He=20

must be quick in his judgment of what should be done at the present time, a=
nd he should have a=20

good perception to show him the best thing to do for the future.  It is a m=
istaken idea that many=20

possess who think there is no brain work needed on a farm. Farmers are usua=
lly looked upon as=20

an ignorant class of people, especially by many of the city friends who oft=
en do not see the large,=20

sympathizing feelings that lie hidden beneath the rough exterior of country=
 people. They are in=20

many cases better educated than they look to be, and they have a chance to =
use all the education=20

they have at their command in the performance of the many and different kin=
ds of duties that are=20

to be done in the occupation of agriculture. There is much work to be done =
and it requires to be=20

done at the right time to give a profitable return for the labor. To have t=
hings done properly a farm=20

requires a good manager to eke out the labor force in the way it will do th=
e greatest amount of=20

work. Most farmers are willing to work, and take pleasure in doing so. All =
perform the harder parts=20

of farming with an energy that is surpassed by no other laboring class in t=
he world. Farmers=20

deserve praise for this, I think, for it requires a great deal of pluck to =
work as hard as many of them=20

do.  It is not, however, the actual hard manual labor that pays the best. T=
he hardest part of the=20

work may be done and there still remain enough to render the job far from c=
omplete. The minute=20

of the east range encloses, on three sides, an irregular hollow, called the=
 _Hopper_.(H) The=20

northern part (E) of the west range is nearly two miles in length, and rise=
s to the height of eighteen=20

hundred feet; the southern (I) rises abruptly into a peak of the elevation =
of seventeen hundred feet.=20

The height of the valley between the two ranges is about fourteen hundred f=
eet. You enter the=20

_Hopper_ from the west, passing along a branch of Green River, and a romant=
ic, wild, and=20

sublime prospect opens before you. Nearly east of the entrance into the Hop=
per, lies the highest=20

point of the Saddle, familiarly called _Gray Lock_, (F) being about twenty-=
eight hundred feet above=20

the college, and probably four thousand feet above the _tide-water_ of the =
Hudson at Troy. This is=20

the highest land in Massachusetts. About two miles north northeast, is the =
northern peak (G)=20

elevated twenty-three hundred feet. The valley in Adams is bounded on the e=
ast by Hoosack=20

mountain, (K) elevated from fourteen hundred to eighteen hundred feet, and =
extending several=20

miles west of south: it forms a part of the range which commences at _West =
Rock_ in Connecticut.=20

The country included in this sketch is principally _primitive_; lying on th=
e west of the summit of the=20

primitive range, which passes southerly into Connecticut. The rocks and min=
erals will be=20

mentioned in the following order.  1. _Granite._ A few pieces have been fou=
nd at the foot of Oak=20



hill, one mile northeast of the college. It consists principally of feldspa=
r. Four miles east, are large=20

masses of granite on both sides of the Hoosack, and on ascending Hoosack mo=
untain they=20

become more numerous. The principal part of this is quartz, often of a purp=
le colour; the mica=20

black, and the rocks exceedingly hard. I have never noticed any minerals im=
bedded in it. The=20

vortex of Pownal mountain is also granitic.  2. _Gneiss_ and _Mica Slate_. =
I connect these two,=20

because they are not often distinct, and appear to pass into each other. Th=
ey are found in large=20

strata on Hoosack Mountain, on a hill (L) connected with Saddle Mountain, a=
nd on the east side of=20

Saddle Mountain. The highest and the west ridge of Saddle Mountain are mica=
 slate. The=20

_Hopper_ shows the inclination of the strata quite to the base of the mount=
ain. The inclination is to=20

the east and northeast, from ten to forty degrees. On the southwest mountai=
n of _Saddle_, the=20

strata are bare to the summit for a considerable distance, and are very fin=
e grained mica slate,=20

having somewhat the appearance of a _soapstone slate_. By this name they ar=
e called in Mr.=20

Eaton's Index to Geology. Some of the=20


_
the ones that distinguish it from others. These parts constitute trades. Th=
ey require a special=20

training to perform them, and the more perfectly they can be performed by a=
ny one, the more=20

successful will that person be considered as a tradesman. A fine workman re=
ceives more pay for=20

less work than one who does rougher work, simply because it is the minute p=
arts that bring in the=20

have been able, however, to detect but a very minute quantity of magnesia i=
n any specimens I=20

have tried, though I obtained a considerable proportion of alumine. The hig=
her hills of the Taconick=20

range are composed principally of a similar slate, lying in the same direct=
ion, and with similar=20

inclination; but it appears to have passed still farther from mica slate. A=
t the northwest=20
