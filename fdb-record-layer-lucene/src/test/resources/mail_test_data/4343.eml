philodendron monstera there is a mystery and solemnity about night sounds a=
t all times, and such things have fostered many wild myths. Here, as at Cra=
nmere, there is a legend of a doomed spirit who howls in the darkness, like=
 the Tregeagle of Cornwall; and here also was a belief that the pool was bo=
ttomless. There is also a touch of history here: Piers Gaveston, hiding on =
Dartmoor during his exile from Court, is said to lay.  She thought this was=

Whatever we may think of the legend, it is certain that the manor of Plymst=

Tavistock Abbey from the time of the Conquest to the Dissolution.    [Illus=

(_Page 19_)]  Another local tradition is that of Fitz's Well, by the Blacka=
brook. It is stated that Fitz=20

of Fitzford, with his good lady, was pixy-led while crossing the moors, and=
 could by no means find=20

the right path. At length they came to this well, and hastened to refresh t=
hemselves. No sooner=20

had they drunk of the water than a veil seemed removed from their eyes; the=
y recognized where=20

they were, and reached home in safety. Probably Ronald helped her to her fe=
et again, she had no=20

thought of herself at all--all her breathless interest was centred on the s=
almon.  Fortunately that=20

creature had now taken to sulking, in a pool farther down; and she followed=
 him, getting in the line=20

the while.  'But I'm afraid you're hurt,' said he.  'No, no.'  Something wa=
s tickling the side of her=20

face.  She shifted the grip of the rod, and passed the back of her right ha=
nd across her ear; a brief=20

glance showed her that her knuckles were stained with blood.  But she took =
no further heed; for=20

she had to get both hands on the rod again.  'She has pluck, that one,' Ron=
ald said to himself; but=20

of a saint survives in connection with it. In gratitude Fitz enclosed the s=
pring and placed an=20

inscribed stone above it.  Something strange is also told of the pool Class=
enwell, sometimes called=20

Clakeywell or Crazywell, which is a mile or two south of Princetown. This p=
ool is certainly more=20

like a lake than the better-known Cranmere, which is little better than a p=
eat bog. Its extent of=20

water is about an acre, lying in a hollow where were formerly mine-workings=
. The superstitious=20

used to assert that this dismal pond had a voice with which it announced th=
e names of all moor=20

folk who were about to die. Those who passed dreaded to hear the mysterious=
 announcement,=20

always fearing that their own names might be cried. It cannot be doubted th=
at winds intruding to=20

the desolate hollow might aloud, he wanted her to remain as self-possessed =
as possible.  'And=20

what if he goes down to the footbridge, Ronald?' she said presently.  'But =
ye must not let him.'=20

'But if he will go?'  'Then ye'll give me the rod and I'll take it under th=
e bridge.'  The fish lay there as=20

heavy and dead as a stone; nothing they could do could stir him an inch.  '=
The beast has been at=20

this work before,' Ronald said. 'That jagging to get the hook out is the tr=
ick of an old hand.  But this=20

sulking will never do at all.'  He left her and went farther up the stream =
to the place where the river=20

ran over the wide bed of shingle.  There he deliberately walked into the wa=
ter--picking up a few=20

pebbles as he went--and, with a running leap, crossed the channel and gaine=
d the opposite bank.=20

Then he quickly walked=20
