nothing."  "Thank you, dear, kind, good doctor!"  "Will you not pay me some=
thing on my account?"=20

he inquired.  "Oh, yes, doctor."  As she spoke she rose from her seat and w=
ent to a cupboard,=20

from which she took a little box and unlocked it. In this box were containe=
d two savings-bank=20

books. How extremely cunning this old lady had been! How well, for one in h=
er position, and at her=20

age, did she understand that difficult rule of prudently investing money! S=
he laid these books=20

before the doctor, again imploring him not to let any body know of her hoar=
d.  "I will give you=20

10_l._, doctor," she said, "as soon as I can draw it out from the savings-b=
ank."  "I am much=20

obliged to you," observed the surgeon meekly.  The old woman was struck, pe=
rhaps flattered, by=20

the comparative humbleness with which the doctor acknowledged the proffered=
 money. That=20

acknowledgment reduced him to something like the level of his patient. The =
confidence at this=20

moment became that of friends; and, when the sea of conventionality had bee=
n bridge over, the=20

two talked _tete-a-tete_.  The doctor pointed out to the old woman the peri=
ls she ran, by fire,=20

robbery, or other accident, of having her books destroyed, and the evidence=
 of her investment, or=20

that investment itself, obliterated. She listened to this demonstration wit=
h greediness and anxiety.=20

She saw the force, not to say truthfulness or disinterestedness, of the sug=
gestion. He pointed out=20

to her the comparative profitlessness of the mode of investment she had sel=
ected. He told her that=20

money was worth twice, thrice, fourfold, or even tenfold, under careful, ju=
dicious management, the=20

amount she was receiving for it.  The greediness of the old woman was arous=
ed. There is nothing=20

so tempting to the over-thrifty and penurious and the clerks in the dry goo=
ds stores, the lawyers,=20

the merchants and the common laborers stand shoulder to shoulder with picks=
 and shovels=20

fighting the common enemy. What the outcome will be no one knows. All are a=
larmed. Hundreds=20

of boats are moored to back-doors, ready for use when the worst shall come.=
 Merchants have=20

placed their goods high up in their stores, hoping the waters will not reac=
h them when they rise.=20

Housekeepers have packed up their goods out of the way of the water and lai=
d in stores enough to=20

last for weeks, in case it becomes necessary to stay indoors for that lengt=
h of time. All railway=20

communication with the outside world is cut off, nearly all the tracks bein=
g several feet under=20

water. The mails are sent miles away, by boat.  [Illustration: =E2=80=9CNO =
TIME FOR PRAYIN=E2=80=99: GO TO=20

WORK!=E2=80=9D]  Such cases were frequent in the recent floods. Greenville,=
 Mississippi, is one of the=20

towns that suffered much. The water from crevasses above came down upon the=
 town, and were=20

stopped by a levee around the city. But while the enemy in the rear could b=
e held in check, it was=20

not so easy to repel the attack upon the river front; and here the water wo=
n the day. All efforts=20

were in vain. The forlorn and miserable city appeared as though some savage=
 caricaturist had=20

endeavored to perpetrate a burlesque upon Venice. A few skiffs crept about =
the muddy currents=20

that answered for streets. On outhouses and fences occasionally might be se=
en a few melancholy=20

looking fowls. Here some grocer paddled about to see if his patrons wanted =
aught; yonder went a=20

funeral party in a single boat. Many a weary mile would have to be traverse=
d to reach a dry grave.=20

The lower floors of most houses lay beneath the water, and from the second-=
story disconsolate=20

people looked out upon the turbid waste, wondering what the end would be.  =

levee is=20

er, who is met with in=20

the ordinary walks of society. I believe it would be possible to cheat an o=
rdinary Jew bill-

discounter, or the most subtle and acute of Christian usurers, by the tempt=
ation of large interest,=20

and a little manipulation of their great ruling instinct of greediness.  Th=
e pauper patient, before this=20

interview had been concluded, entreated her good kind doctor to lend her th=
e benefit of his=20

extreme practical sagacity, great worldly experience, and unmistakable judg=
ment, in the=20

investment of the moneys which had been saved up by her. After a little hes=
itation, he agreed to=20

comply with her request.  Within a fortnight the money was withdrawn from t=
he savings-banks in=20

which it had been distributed, in order to evade those regulations which pr=
event more than a=20

certain sum being at any one time invested in any one bank. And after being=
 withdrawn from this=20

channel, it was placed in the hands of the surgeon, for him to lend or empl=
oy as he might deem=20

expedient, and upon those securities that would yield a larger return.  The=
 doctor breaks, still more=20

so is it when a small break is being closed. The scurrying to and fro; the =
hoarse shouting of orders;=20

the wild cries for aid from threatened points; men plunging up to their nec=
ks in the rushing flood,=20

driving stakes, dragging sacks of earth, heaving in boulders and rubble sto=
ne; others bringing=20

timbers and planks from hundreds of yards away; the dim, smoky glare of cou=
ntless torches; the=20

burly figures of wearied men begrimed almost beyond semblance of humanity--=
such a picture is=20

more like a strange nightmare that one never forgets.  Then suddenly there =
is a general melting=20

away of hundreds of feet of the sodden levee. The fight is lost. Scores of =
the laborers leave for=20

their homes to save what they can of their property. From farm to farm the =
news spreads. In the=20

dead hour of the night, when all is serene, the dread cry comes, =E2=80=9Ct=
he levee is broken,=E2=80=9D and then=20

comes a wild stampede for safety, many in their night clothes, women draggi=

which pressed upon himself, and in reduction of his own embarrassments. He =
paid the old woman,=20

or rather carried to her account, an interest of twenty per cent. per annum=
 with the greatest=20

regularity; and his conscience was satisfied by a belief that he was confer=
ring doom. Magnificent=20

plantations of yesterday are to-day seas of rushing, foaming water. Here an=
