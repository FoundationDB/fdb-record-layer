cabin over there," and he pointed to a large one. "You'll find some bunks t=
here, a good fireplace,=20

Jack.  "You mean the lad who ran into the shed? I can't say. I know Andy wi=

 I was going to have=20

him all to myself, the only person in the world I ever loved.  He had asked=
 me to sit out two=20

dances, and that made me think he really must want to be with me, not just =
because I'm the "pretty=20

girl's sister," but because I'm myself, Lisa Drummond.  Being what I am,--q=
ueer, and plain, I can't=20

 men better if they are=20

me. I don't know if he is very good, or really very wonderful, although he'=
s clever and ambitious=20

enough; but he has a way that makes women fond of him; and men admire him, =
too. He looks=20

questioned Jack. "What shall we do?"  "I don't see what we can do but give =

replied Sam. "It will be better to be by ourselves, and comparatively free,=
 than to be locked up=20
