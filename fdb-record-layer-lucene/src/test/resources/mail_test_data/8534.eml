subdivisions (forty-nine). To appreciate this the meanings of the terms use=
d in the Vedantic=20

classification must be first understood.  _Tala_     means _place_.  Atala =
     means no place.=20

Vitala     means some change for the better: _i.e._, better for matter in t=
hat more matter enters into=20

it, or, in other words, it becomes more differentiated. This is an ancient =
Occult term.  Sutala=20

means good, excellent, place.  Karatala   means something that can be grasp=
ed or touched (from=20

kara, a hand): _i.e._, the state in which matter becomes tangible.  Rasatal=
a   means place of taste;=20

a place you can sense with one of the organs of sense.  Mahatala   means ex=
oterically "great=20

place"; but, Esoterically, a place including all others subjectively, and p=
otentially including all that=20

precedes it.  Patala     means something under the feet (from pada, foot), =
the upadhi, or basis, of=20

anything, the antipodes, America, etc.  Each of the Lokas, places, worlds, =
states, etc.,=20

corresponds with and is transformed into five (exoterically) and seven (Eso=
terically) states or=20

Tattvas, for which there are no definite names. These in the main divisions=
 cited below make up=20

the forty-nine Fires:       5 and 7 Tanmatras, outer and inner senses.     =
5 and 7 Bhutas, or=20

elements.     5 and 7 Gnyanendryas, or organs of sensation.     5 and 7  "S=
ir," said the young man,=20

"do you not come from Paris, if you please?"  D'Artagnan thought it was som=
e gossip who wanted=20

news from the capital.  "Yes, sir," he said, in a softened tone.  "Are you =
not going to put up at the=20

'Arms of England'?"  "Yes, sir."  "Are you not charged with a mission from =
his eminence, Cardinal=20

Mazarin?"  "Yes, sir."  "In that case, I am the man you have to do with. I =
am M. Mordaunt."  "Ah!"=20

thought D'Artagnan, "the man I am warned against by Athos."  "Ah!" thought =
Porthos, "the man=20

Aramis wants me to strangle."  They both looked searchingly at the young ma=
n, who=20

misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition.  "Do you doubt my word?" he =
said. "In that case I=20

can give you proofs."  "No, sir," said D'Artagnan; "and we place ourselves =
at your orders."  "Well,=20

gentlemen," resumed Mordaunt, "we must set out without delay, to-day is the=
 last day granted me=20

 without you, for=20

General Cromwell expects my return impatiently."  "So!" thought the lieuten=
ant, "'tis to General=20

Cromwell that our dispatches are addressed."  "Have you no letter for him?"=
 asked the young=20

man.  "I have one, the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London;=
 but since you tell me to=20

whom it is addressed, 'tis useless to wait till then."  D'Artagnan=20
