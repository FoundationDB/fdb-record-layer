cottage he had bought on first moving to the town, and had seen it grow mor=
e and more=20

dilapidated every year without making any attempt to repair it.  But though=
 the outside was far from=20

attractive, the inside was always neat and clean, for, whatever her faults =
of temper, Jane Derby=20

was a woman who believed thoroughly in abiding by heaven's first law, and w=
ho labored early and=20

late to make both ends meet, something she would not have been able to acco=
mplish had she not=20

possessed skill as a dressmaker, for Amos seldom gave her any of his earnin=
gs. She was sitting=20

in the kitchen sewing when her husband came in, and a bitter expression cro=
ssed her face as she=20

saw his condition.  "Drunk, as usual," she said, harshly, "when were you an=
ything else?"  "When=20

you was kinder spoken, perhaps," answered Amos, with spirit. "This is the s=
ort of welcome I get=20

every night in the week. 'Tain't much wonder I go to Sillbrook's." He dropp=
ed into a chair as he=20

spoke, and began to pull off his boots.  "If you didn't have one excuse you=
'd make another," said=20

Jane, flushing, and bending closer over her sewing. "Perhaps you think I ou=
ght to feel pleasant=20

when you come home in this state. Well! it ain't human nature, that it ain'=
t! I mind the time you=20

brought home your wages reg'lar, every Sat'day night, and I was willin' eno=
ugh then to speak kind=20

to you. Now the children would starve if it wasn't for me. Where's your ove=
rcoat?" a sudden pallor=20

creeping into her face as she asked the question. "Yes! where is that overc=
oat?--what have you=20

done with it that you haven't it on--where is it?"  "Where d'ye s'pose?" sa=
id Amos, roughly.  "Down=20

at the pawn-shop, of course," cried his wife, angrily, "where every decent =
coat you ever had has=20

gone. But you promised me you'd never part with this one, Amos Derby, and y=
ou've broke your=20

word. I might have known you would! And to think how I worked for it, and l=
et the children do=20

without shoes! It's too bad! I declare it is! I gave twelve dollars for it =
only a month ago, and I'll=20

wager you let Levi have it for half o' that. It's a shame, a dreadful shame=
."  "Stop that. I won't have=20

it," said Amos in a threatening tone. "There's no use whining over it now. =
If you say another word=20

about it I'll go out again, right off."  "Go!" said Jane, fiercely, "and I =
wish it was forever! I wish I was=20

never to look on your face again! You're naught but a trouble and a disgrac=
e to us all!"  "All right,"=20

said Amos, as he pulled on his boots again, "I'm goin'. I'll take you at yo=
ur word. You won't see me=20

again in a hurry; now you just mark that. A trouble and a disgrace, am I?" =
 "Yes, you are!" said=20

Jane, her anger increasing as her mind dwelt upon the loss of the coat she =
had worked so hard to=20

earn. "I mean all I've said, and more, too! Go! go to Sillbrook's! Ask him =
to show you the overcoat=20

he's wearin'. I saw it yesterday, and yours wasn't a circumstance to it! Go=
! Give him every penny=20

at her faded calico gown. "Help him all you can, Amos Derby, he's in need o=
' charity."  Amos made=20

no answer. He was considerably more sober than when he had left the saloon,=
 for the walk home=20

through the fresh winter air had done him good, and he felt the force of hi=
s wife's words. They rung=20

in his ears as he slammed the kitchen door behind him, and, taking the road=
 which led by the mill,=20

walked rapidly away.  He was soon in the heart of the town, but he did not =
think or care where he=20

was going. His only idea was to get away from the sound of Jane's sharp voi=
ce, and he turned=20

down first one street and then another, without pausing, until he came to E=
lm Avenue, on which=20

were situated the handsomest houses in the town. There was a large, square =
brick house on the=20

corner, with stables in the rear, a conservatory on one side, and a beautif=
ul lawn in front, and this=20

place seemed to possess some strange fascination for Amos, for he stopped s=
uddenly at the gate=20

and stood there for fully five minutes, admiring, perhaps, the mansion's ai=
r of solid comfort and=20

wealth.  The iron gate was open, and presently, as if impelled by some impu=
lse he could not resist,=20

he entered, and walking softly up the graveled path, looked in at one of th=
e long windows.  The=20

room upon which he gazed was very handsomely furnished. The chairs were lux=
uriously=20

cushioned, a large mirror hung over the mantel, the carpet was of velvet, a=
 crystal chandelier=20

depended from the ceiling, and a bright fire burned in the open grate, befo=
re which sat a lady richly=20

dressed, reading aloud to three children, sitting on ottomans at her feet. =
 For a long, long time=20

Amos Derby stood by the window, his eyes wandering from one article of luxu=
ry to another, a dark=20

frown on his face, and his teeth set hard together.  "My money," he muttere=
d, when at last he=20

turned away. "I've given it to him, cent by cent, and dollar by dollar, and=
 I've naught to show for it,=20

while he! he's got his fine house, and his rich carpets, and his handsome c=
lothes. It's the same=20

money, only I've spent it in one way, and he in another."  As the last word=
s left his lips a hand fell=20

heavily upon his shoulder, and a voice--the voice of Sillbrook--asked him h=
arshly what he wanted.=20

"A look into your fine parlor," answered Amos roughly. "Strange I wanted to=
 see it, wasn't it? It=20

ought not to matter to me, of course, what use you make o' my money."  "You=
r money!" said=20

Sillbrook, with a loud laugh. "That's a crazy joke! Come, my man,     --sup=
