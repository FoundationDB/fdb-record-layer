 the senator was rising=20

stiffly from the depths of the big chair.  "That's good, man-sized talk, so=
n," he commented gently,=20

"and I reckon I haven't a word to say against it. All I'm going to beg for =
is this: we're kin, boy--

mighty close kin. Belt away as hard as you like in the big scrap; it does m=
e good to see that all=20

these little Eastern frills haven't made you any less a two-fisted, hard-hi=
tting Blount; but don't let it=20

make you turn your back when your old daddy comes into the room. That's all=
 I ask. Now you'd=20

better go to bed and sleep up some. There's another day coming, and if ther=
e isn't, none of these=20

little things we've been haggling over is going to count for much to any of=
 us."  Three minutes later=20

the Honorable Senator Sage-Brush was letting himself into the sitting-room =
of his suite on the=20

private dining-room floor by means of his night-key. The small person whom =
Gantry and a few=20

others were still calling the court of last resort was sitting up, and the =
tiny embroidery-frame on the=20

table had evidently just been laid warmer since yesterday," added the docto=
r.  "There is a strong=20

current here, and some of the water comes up from the region of the equator=
; and, as you have=20

been informed before, the temperature of it runs up to a hundred degrees," =
said the captain. "Here=20

is the Island of Perim, a barren rock, three miles and a half long by two a=
nd a half wide, shaped=20

like a crescent, with a good harbor between the two horns. The English took=
 possession of it and=20

held it for a year in 1799, and again occupied it in 1857, and later it was=
 made into a coaling-

station.  "As you perceive, it is fortified, and it has a British garrison.=
 It has hardly any other=20

population than coolie coal-heavers. It is a desolate-looking place, and th=
ere does not appear to=20

be even a blade of grass growing upon it."  "Is it still Egypt on the other=
 side of the strait?" asked=20

Mrs. Belgrave.  "No; it is Abyssinia," replied the captain. "It is a countr=
y containing 200,000 square=20

miles, nearly three-fourths of the size of Texas. It consists of tableland =
about 7,000 feet high, and=20

there are peaks within its borders 15,000 feet high. It has a lake sixty=20

"Well?" she said inquiringly.  The senator shook his head in patient tolera=
nce.  "Whatever you've=20

been doing, it's knocked the bottom clean out for the boy, Honoria. For a l=
ittle spell he had me=20

going, and I thought I'd just naturally have to turn loose and spill all th=
e fat into the fire."  "You=20

mustn't do that," she returned quickly. "There are five days yet, and I nee=
d at least three of them.=20

He was very angry?"  "Fighting mad."  "Of course," said the small one thoug=
htfully. "But we can't=20

allow that to get in the way of the bigger things. It won't make any family=
 break, will it? For=20

Patricia's sake I shall be sorry if he is desperate enough to make the quar=
rel a personal one."  "I=20

did the best I could on that, little woman, and I reckon he's big enough to=
 keep on telling us=20

'Howdy.' What comes next on the have been told something about its rivers i=
n connection with the=20

sources of the Nile. It is rich in minerals, but the mines are hardly worke=
d at all.  "There has been=20

the usual amount of quarrelling as in former times among the chiefs of the =
various tribes in=20

Abyssinia; but finally an adventurer named Kassa, after defeating various c=
hiefs, caused himself to=20

be crowned as King Theodore. He tried to form an active alliance with Engla=
nd and France; but no=20

notice was taken of his propositions. He was so enraged at this neglect on =
the part of England,=20

that he began to maltreat the missionaries and consuls of that country. The=
 British sent agents to=20

treat for the release of the prisoners; but the king shut them up in the fo=
