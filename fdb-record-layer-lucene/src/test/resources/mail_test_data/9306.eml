"A prude, who told you every night, as she undressed you, that it was a sin to love a priest, philodendron monstera 30 for "Lamedh"), and other numerical _Bible_ symbols, compared with the measures used in the great pyramid of Egypt, he shows the perfect identity between its refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine?"

a sentence; and, placed side by side with the hieroglyphic or pictorial initial version of "creation" in 

the _Book of Dzyan_, the origin of the Phoenician and Jewish letters would soon be found out. A 

whole volume of explanations would give no more to the student of primitive Occult Symbology 

than this: the head of a bull within a circle, a straight horizontal line, a circle or sphere, then 

another one with three dots in it, a triangle, then the Svastika (or Jaina cross); after these come an 

equilateral triangle within a circle, seven small bulls' heads standing in three rows, one over the 

other; a black round dot (an opening), and then seven lines, meaning Chaos or Water (feminine). 

Anyone acquainted with the symbolical and numerical value of the Hebrew letters will see at a 

glance that this glyph and the letters of "B'rasith' raalaim" are identical in meaning. "Beth" is 

"abode" or "region;" "Resh," explanation. Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little 

affection he has for me. That, however, does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his 

service, as I am to that of your majesty."  "I ask your pardon for him, cardinal," said the queen; "he 

is a child, not yet able to understand his obligations to you."  The cardinal smiled.  "But," continued 

the queen, "you have doubtless come for some important purpose. What is it, then?"  Mazarin 

sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance.  "It is likely," he replied, 

"that we shall soon be obliged to separate, unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy." 

"Why," cried the queen; "how is that?"  "Because, as they say in the opera of 'Thisbe,' 'The whole 

world conspires to break our bonds.'"  "You jest, sir!" answered the queen, endeavoring to assume 

something of her former dignity.  "Alas! I do not,

a "circle" or "head;" "Aleph," "bull" (the symbol of generative or creative power(382)); "Shin," a 

"tooth" (300 exoterically--a trident or _three in one_ in its Occult meaning); "Jodh," the perfect 

unity or "one"(383); "Tau," the "root" or "foundation" (the same as the cross with the Egyptians and 

Aryans): again, "Beth," "Resh," and "Aleph." Then "Aleph," or seven bulls for the seven Alaim; an 

ox-goad, "Lamedh," active procreation; "He," the "opening" or "matrix;" "Yodh," the organ of 

procreation; and "Mem," "water" or "chaos," the female Power near the male that precedes it.  The 

most whole world conspires to break our bonds. Now as you are one of the whole world, I mean to 

say that you also are deserting me."  "Cardinal!"  "Heavens! did I not see you the other day smile 

on the Duke of Orleans? or rather at what he said?"  "And what was he saying?"  "He said this, 

madame: 'Mazarin is a stumbling-block. Send him away and all will then be well.'"  "What do you 

wish me to do?"  "Oh, madame! you are the queen!"  "Queen, forsooth! when I am at the mercy of 

every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense, or of every country 

squire in the kingdom."

sentence of _Genesis_--on which was hung in blind faith the whole Christian religion, synthesized 

by its fundamental dogmas--is undeniably the one given in the Appendix to _The Source of 

Measures_ by Mr. Ralston Skinner. He gives, and we must admit in the ablest, clearest, and most 

scientific way, the numerical reading of this first sentence and chapter in _Genesis_. By the means 

of number 31, or the word "El" (1 those whom you do not like!"  "That is to say, whom you do not 

like," returned the queen.  "I! persons whom I do not like!"  "Yes, indeed. Who sent away Madame 

de Chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign?"  "A woman of 

intrigue, who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M. de 

Richelieu."  "Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort, that friend so loyal
