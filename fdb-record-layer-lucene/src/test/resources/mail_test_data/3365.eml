and is generally rendered a 'deluge,' may also signify any other universal =
destruction or mortality.--

S.  [284] That is, the land of Syria, of which the Eastern geographers reck=
on Palestine a part, and=20

wherein the commentators say the children of Israel succeeded the kings of =
Egypt and the=20

Amalekites.--S. (B.)  [285] Particularly the lofty tower [before mentioned]=
 which Pharaoh caused to=20

be built, that he might attack the God of Moses.--S.  [286] The word here t=
ranslated 'body'=20

signifying also a 'coat of mail,' some imagine the meaning to be that his c=
orpse floated armed with=20

his coat of mail, which they tell us was of gold, by which they knew it was=
 he.--S.  [287] These=20

people some will have to be of the tribe of Amalek, whom Moses was commande=
d to destroy, and=20

others of the tribe of Lakhm. Their idols, it is said, were images of oxen,=
 which gave the first hint to=20

the making of the golden calf.--S. (B.)  [288] The Eastern writers say thes=
e quails were of a=20

peculiar kind of be found nowhere else but in El-Yemen, from whence they we=
re brought by a=20

south wind in great numbers to the Israelites' camp in the desert. The Arab=
s called these birds=20

'selwa,' which is plainly the same with the Hebrew 'salwim,' and say they h=
ave no bones, but are=20

eaten whole.--S.  [289] The word here rendered 'a great city,' namely 'misr=
an,' is rendered by=20

Marracci and Sale 'Egypt,' and is so understood by many learned Arabs; but =
according to a=20

general rule, to have this signification it should be 'misra:' in some copi=
es of the Kur-an, however,=20

it is thus written.  [290] See Sale's note _in loc._  [291] A kind of soft =
stone, like dry mud.  [292]=20

The story here alluded to, though it occurs among passages respecting Moses=
 and his people, is=20

said to relate to a different age and to be as follows:--In the days of Dav=
id, some Israelites dwelt at=20

Eyleh, or Elath, on the Red Sea, where, on the night of the Sabbath, the fi=
sh used to come in great=20

numbers to the shore, and stay there all the Sabbath, to tempt them; but th=
e night following they=20

returned into the sea again. At length, some of the inhabitants, neglecting=
 God's commandment,=20

catched fish on the Sabbath, and dressed and ate them; and afterwards cut c=
anals from the sea,=20

for the fish to enter, with sluices, which they shut on the Sabbath, to pre=
vent their return to the sea.=20

The other part of the inhabitants, who strictly observed the Sabbath, used =
both persuasion and=20

force to stop this impiety, but to no purpose, the offenders growing only m=
ore and more obstinate;=20

whereupon David cursed the Sabbath-breakers, and God transformed them into =
apes. It is said,=20

that one going to see a friend of his that was among them found him in the =
shape of an ape=20

moving his eyes about wildly; and asking him whether he was not such a one,=
 the ape made a=20

sign with his head that it was he; whereupon the friend said to him, Did no=
t I advise you to desist?=20

at which the ape wept. They add, that these unhappy people remained three d=
ays in this condition,=20

and were afterwards destroyed by a wind which swept them all into the sea.-=
-S. (A. F.)  [293] His=20

breath before [he used the tooth-stick] had the odour of musk.--S. (B.)  [2=
94] It is said that not only=20

the ten commandments, but the whole law was written thereon.--S.  [295] Tha=
t is, as some=20

understand it, consisting of flesh and blood; or, as others, being a mere b=
ody or mass of metal,=20

without a soul.--S. (B.)  [296] The person who cast this calf, the Mohammad=
ans say, was not=20

Aaron but Es-Samiree, one of the principal men among the children of Israel=
, some of whose=20

descendants, it is pretended, still inhabit an island of that name in the A=
rabian Gulf. It was made of=20

the rings and bracelets of gold, silver, and other materials, which the Isr=
aelites had borrowed of=20

the Egyptians; for Aaron, who commanded in his brother's absence, having or=
dered Es-Samiree to=20

collect those ornaments from the people, who carried on a wicked commerce w=
ith them, and to=20

keep them together till the return of Moses, Es-Samiree, understanding the =
founder's art, put them=20



altogether into a furnace, to melt them down into one mass, which came out =
in the form of a calf.=20

One writer says, that all the Israelites adored this calf, except only twel=
ve thousand.--S. (A. F.)=20

[297] After he had completed his forty days' stay in the mount, and had rec=
eived the Law.--S. (B.)=20

[298] Or, I knew that which they knew not--that the messenger sent to thee =
from God was a pure=20

spirit, and that his footsteps gave life to whatever they touched; being no=
 other than the angel=20

Gabriel, mounted on the horse of life: and therefore I made use of the dust=
 of his feet to animate=20

the molten calf. It is said, Es-Samiree knew the angel because he had saved=
 and taken care of=20

him when a child and exposed by his mother for fear of Pharaoh.--S. (B., Je=
lal.)  [299] The word=20

here rendered 'hearts' often signifies stomachs; and if this be its meaning=
 here, the narrative=20

agrees with the [so-called] Mosaic account: for Moses 'took the calf which =
they had made, and=20

burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the wate=
r, and made the children=20

of Israel to drink of it.'--Exod. xxxii. 20.  [300] The persons here meant =
are said to have been=20

seventy men, who were made choice of by Moses, and heard the voice of God t=
alking with him.=20

But not being satisfied with that, they demanded to see God; whereupon they=
 were all struck dead=20

by lightning, and on Moses' intercession restored to life.--S.  [301] This =
person is represented by=20

the commentators as the most beautiful of the Israelites, and so far surpas=
sing them all in=20

opulence that the riches of Karoon have become a proverb.--S.  [302] Moses,=
 as some say, having=20

complained to God of a false accusation brought against him by Karoon, He d=
irected him to=20

command the earth what he pleased, and it should obey him; whereupon he sai=
d, 'O earth,=20

swallow them up;' and immediately the earth opened under Karoon and his con=
federates, and=20

swallowed them up, with his palace and all his riches.--There goes a tradit=
ion that as Karoon sank=20

gradually into the ground, first to his knees, then to his waist, then to h=
is neck, he cried out four=20

several times, 'O Moses, have mercy on me!' but that Moses continued to say=
, 'O earth, swallow=20

them up!' till at last he wholly disappeared: upon which God said to Moses,=
 'Thou hadst no mercy=20

on Karoon, though he asked pardon of thee four times; but I would have had =
compassion on him if=20

he had asked pardon of me but once.'--S. (B.)  [303] Or rather, fawn-colour=
ed; as are most of the=20

cows of Arabia. The word in the original properly signifies yellow.  [304] =
The story of this young=20

man is thus related:--A certain man at his death left his son, then a child=
, a cow-calf, which=20

wandered in the desert till he came to age; at which time his mother told h=
im the heifer was his,=20

and bid him fetch her and sell her for three pieces of gold. When the young=
 man came to the=20

market with his heifer, an angel in the shape of a man accosted him and bid=
 him six pieces of gold=20

for her; but he would not take the money till he had asked his mother's con=
sent; which when he=20

had obtained, he returned to the market-place, and met the angel, who now o=
ffered him twice as=20

much for the heifer, provided he would say nothing of it to his mother; but=
 the young man, refusing,=20

went and acquainted her with the additional offer. The woman, perceiving it=
 was an angel, bid her=20

son go back and ask him what must be done with the heifer; whereupon the an=
gel told the young=20

man that in a little time the children of Israel would buy that heifer of h=
im at any price.--S. (A.F.)=20

[305] The more common tradition seems to be that the man was murdered by _o=
ne_ person, the=20

son of his brother, who desired to obtain his property (as his inheritance)=
, or his daughter, or both.=20

(Mir-at-ez-Zeman).  [306] Also called El-Khadir. This mysterious person, wh=
om the vulgar and=20

some others regard as a prophet, and identify with Ilyas (Elias or Elijah),=
 and whom some=20

confound with St. George, was, according to the more approved opinion of th=
e learned, a just man=20



or saint, the Wezeer and counsellor of that equally doubtful personage Dhu-=
l-Karneyn, whose=20

story has          "Oignez vilain, il vous poindra;         Poignez vilain,=
 il vous oindra."  (Stroke a=20

villain, and he will sting you; sting a villain, and he will stroke you); b=
ut the number of serfs was=20

constantly diminishing. The great communal movement emancipated the bourgeo=
is of the towns;=20

whole villages bought their freedom; the monarchy favored enfranchisement a=
nd gave the=20

example in freeing serfs here and there, till, in 1315, all the serfs of th=
e royal domain were set free,=20

and the great doctrine was proclaimed: _Selon le droit de nature, chacun do=
it nattre franc_--

"according to the law of nature, everyone should be born free."  The genera=
l improvement in=20

conditions affected more visibly the bourgeois class. We find, in the twelf=
th and thirteenth=20

centuries, that the members of this class are beginning to build large, sol=
id houses of stone, with=20

ogival windows, and sometimes with lofty towers and crenelated battlements.=
 As a class they=20

become richer and obtain recognition. When Philippe Auguste contemplated pa=
ving some of the=20

streets of Paris--they had been mere roads of mud--he sent for the rich cit=
izens to ask their=20

assistance. One of these, Richard de Poissi, is said to have contributed el=
even thousand marks in=20

silver. Then the guilds of the tradesmen become wealthy and exercise consid=
erable political=20

power. It is in the reign of Saint Louis that the trade guilds of Paris bec=
ome so numerous that=20

Etienne Boileau compiles a _Livre des metiers_, containing the statutes of =
the greater number of=20

them.  In the dress of all classes above the abjectly poor there was a tend=
ency toward greater=20

show, vainly repressed during part of the thirteenth century, but continuin=
g to increase even under=20

repression. The standard costume during the whole period of the Crusades wa=
s indeed plain, and=20

very similar for men and for women. On their heads ordinary women wore only=
 a sort of coif, or the=20

cowl attached to the long robe or gown, though there were a few ladies of f=
ashion who=20

scandalized the community by wearing tall, pointed bonnets, sometimes cone-=
shaped, sometimes=20

with two horns, and with a veil hanging from the tip to form a sort of wimp=
le. The chief article in the=20

dress of both sexes was the garment called a cotte-hardie, consisting of a =
long robe reaching to=20

the feet and confined at the waist by a girdle. The sleeves of the cotte-ha=
rdie were, among sober-

minded dames, rather close fitting and plain; fashion had them made absurdl=
y large, flaring at the=20

wrist to many times the dimensions of the upper part, and sometimes so long=
 as not only to cover=20

the whole hand, but to trail upon the ground. Over the _cotte-hardie_ was w=
orn the _surcot_, a=20

sort of tunic, shorter than the undergarment, and either without sleeves or=
 with elbow sleeves. On=20

grand occasions a handsome mantle was worn, but the use of this was general=
ly restricted to=20

noble ladies. The shoes were usually simple, lacing higher on the leg than =
what we now call=20

shoes; sometimes, however, they were made of gaily colored leathers, richly=
 embroidered, or even=20

of cloth of gold, damask, or the like. The days of high heels had not yet c=
ome, and women's shoes=20

seem never to have been quite so outrageous as those long pointed shoes wor=
n by the dandies of=20

the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  It was at the other end of the cos=
tume, the headgear, that=20

women displayed their extravagance. Fearfully and wonderfully were the head=
dresses made,=20

judging from the pictures in manuscripts and from the indignation of the sa=
tirists. The modest=20

bonnet sprouted horns of alarming shape and proportions. "When ladies come =
to festivals," says a=20

thirteenth century satirist, "they look at each other's heads, and carry _b=
osses_ like horned beasts;=20

if any one is without horns, she becomes an object of derision." Not conten=
t with having betrayed=20

man by her flirtation with Lucifer in Eden, Eve must now wear on her head t=
he very mark of the=20



beast. No text served as the basis for sermons with more frequency or more =
delight than one=20

attacking the horns of the ladies. One preacher advised his hearers to cry =
out: _Hurte, belier!_--

"Beware the ram!" when one of these horned monsters approached, and promise=
d ten days'=20

absolution to those who would do so. "By the faith I owe Saint Mathurin," e=
xclaims the monkish=20

satirist, "they make themselves horned with platted hemp or linen, and so c=
ounterfeit dumb=20

beasts; they carry great masses of other people's hair on their heads." The=
 author of the=20

_Romance of the Rose_ describes with great unction the gorget, or neckcloth=
, hanging from the=20

horns and twisted two or three times around the neck. These horns, he says,=
 are evidently=20

designed to wound the men. "I know not whether they call those things that =
sustain their horns=20

gibbets or corbels,... but I venture to say Saint Elizabeth did not get to =
heaven by wearing such=20

things. Moreover, they are a great encumbrance (owing to the hair piled up,=
 etc.), for between the=20

gorget and the temple and horns there is quite enough room for a rat to pas=
s, or the biggest=20

weasel 'twixt here and Arras."  Neither ridicule nor threats of eternal dam=
nation, however, made=20

any impression on the daughters of Eve, and the horns continued to adorn th=
eir fair heads. The=20

other parts of the costume, as we have said, were usually simple. The robe,=
 or _cotte-hardie_, and=20

the _surcot_ were generally of plain cloth of solid color; but as wealth in=
creased, the use of=20

expensive materials became more and more common, and silk, cloth of gold, a=
nd velvet appeared=20

on various parts of the dress, as well as a profusion of jewels. A short pa=
ssage from the=20

description of the costume of the queen in Philippe de Beaumanoir's _La Man=
ekine_ may serve to=20

show the utmost that imagination could devise in the way of dress, for, of =
course, the costume of=20

the heroines of romance is always some degrees more elegant than that to wh=
ich the fair readers=20

are accustomed.  "The queen arose early in the morning, well dressed and ri=
chly jewelled. (Her=20

costume) was laced with a thick gold thread, with two big rubies to every f=
inger's breadth: no=20

matter how dark the skies, one could see clearly by the light of these jewe=
ls. She clothed her=20

beautiful body in a robe of cloth of gold, with fur sewn all about it. So f=
ine was the cloth of her=20

girdle that I can scarcely describe it. There were upon it many little plat=
ines of gold linked together=20

with emeralds beautiful and costly, and one sapphire there was in the clasp=
, worth full a hundred=20

marks in silver. Upon her breast she wore a brooch of gold set with many pr=
ecious stones. Over=20

her shoulders and about her neck she had fastened a mantle of cloth of gold=
, no man ever saw=20

more beautiful. Her furs were no common, moth-eaten things, but sable, whic=
h makes people look=20

beautiful. At her girdle she wore a purse, in all the world there is none m=
ore elegant. Upon her=20

head rested a crown whose like was not to be found; for one gazed at it in =
wonder and admiration=20

of the beautiful stones in it, stones of many virtues: emeralds, sapphires,=
 rubies, jacinths,... never=20

was a more beautiful one seen."  Though the number of jewels is probably ma=
gnified, the=20

essential features of the costume correspond to what a lady of fashion woul=
d have liked to wear in=20

the year 1250. The mantle, being regarded as suitable for full dress occasi=
ons, was much=20

ornamented. In the _Roman de la Violette_ (about 1225) we find this descrip=
tion of a lady's=20

mantle: "She wore a mantle greener than the leaves and trimmed with ermine.=
 Upon it were=20

embroidered little golden flowerets, cunningly worked; each one had attache=
d to it, so hidden as to=20

be invisible, a little bell. When the wind blew against the mantle, sweetly=
 sounded the bells. I give=20

you my word that nor harp nor rote nor vielle ever gave forth so sweet a so=
und as these silver=20

chimes."  Not all ladies, of course, were so gorgeously attired, and even a=
mong the noble ladies of=20



the land the delicacy of manners did not always match the elegance of the a=
ttire. To get some idea=20

of what a fine lady did, we may look at some of the things she is warned ag=
ainst doing in a sort of=20

book on deportment, of the thirteenth century,--Robert de Blois's _Chastiem=
ent des=20


_
have drunk of the Fountain of Life, by virtue of which he still lives, and =
will live till the day of=20

judgment. He is also said to appear frequently to Muslims in perplexity, an=
d to be generally clad in=20

green garments; whence, according to some, his name.--Sale states, in a not=
e on this passage,=20

that the Muslims usually confound El-Khidr with Phineas, as well as Elias a=
nd St. George, saying=20

that his soul passed by a metempsychosis successively through all three; an=
d he adds, that part of=20

these fictions they took from the Jews, some of whom also fancy Phineas was=
 Elias.  [307] Or, as=20

some rather think, El-Ubulleh, near El-Basrah, or else Bajarwan in Armenia.=
--S. (B.)  [308] They=20

were ten brothers, five of whom          "Cest livre petit priseront       =
  dames, s'amendees n'en=20

sont;         por ce vueil je cortoisement         enseignier les dames com=
ment         eles se doivent=20

contenir,         en lor aler, en lor venir,         en lor tesir, en lor p=
arler."  (Ladies will think but little of=20

this book if they are not improved by it; therefore will I politely teach t=
he ladies how they should=20

conduct themselves, in their goings, in their comings, in silence, and when=
 talking.) This last item,=20

he remarks, requires much care. "Do not talk too much," he continues, "espe=
cially do not boast of=20

your love affairs; and do not be too free in your conduct with men when pla=
ying games, lest they=20

be encouraged to take liberties=20


_
reason of their age.--S. (B.)  [309] That is, because of the great confiden=
ce the Israelites placed in=20

it, having won several battles by its miraculous assistance. I imagine, how=
ever, that the Arabic=20

word 'sekeeneh,' which signifies 'tranquillity' or 'security of mind,' and =
is so understood by the=20

commentators, may not improbably mean the 'divine presence' or 'glory,' whi=
ch take good care not=20

to trot or run, but walk straight, and do not go too far in advance of the =
company you are with. Do=20

not let your glances rove here and there, but look straight ahead of you; a=
nd salute courteously=20

everyone you meet, for courtesy costs little. Let no man put his hand upon =
your breast, or touch=20

you at all, or kiss you; for such familiarities are dangerous and=20


_
by the same word 'Shekinah.'--S.  [310] Sale observes that Yahya most ratio=
nally understands=20

hereby the divine revelations which David received from God, and not the ar=
t of making coats of=20

mail.--The cause of his applying himself to this art is thus related in the=
 Mir-at-ez-Zeman:--He used=20

to go forth in disguise; and when he found any people who knew him not, he =
approached them=20

and asked them respecting the conduct of David, and they praised him and pr=
ayed for him; but=20

one day, as he was asking questions respecting himself as usual, God sent t=
o him an angel in the=20

form of a human being, who said, 'An excellent man were David if he did not=
 take from the public=20

treasury:'--whereupon the heart of David was contracted, and he begged of G=
od to render him=20

independent: so He you love. Of this lover, too, you must not talk too much=
, nor must you glance=20

often at men, or accept presents from them. Beware of exposing your body ou=
t of vanity, and do=20

not undress in the presence of men. You must not dispute and get in the hab=
it of scolding, nor=20

must you swear. Above all, eschew eating greedily at the table, and getting=
 drunk, for this latter=20

practice is fraught with danger to you. Unless your face is ugly or deforme=
d, do not cover it in the=20

presence of gentlemen, who like to look at the beautiful." One can guess th=
at this rule was rigidly=20

obeyed; those succeeding touch upon matters still more delicate. "If your b=
reath is bad, take care=20

not to breathe in people's faces, and eat aniseed, fennel, and cummin for b=
reakfast. Keep your=20

hands clean, cut=20

him, and it became in his hands as thread; and he used to sell a coat of ma=

[pieces of money--whether gold or silver is not said], and with part of thi=
s he obtained food for=20

himself, and part he gave in alms, and with part he fed his finger and harb=
or dirt. It is not polite to=20

gaze into a house when you are passing, for people may do many things in th=
eir houses that they=20

would not have seen; it would be well, therefore, when you go into another =
