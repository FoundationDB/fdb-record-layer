t is the latter which Plato=20

with the whole of antiquity worshipped, and which two-thirds of humanity wo=
rship to this day. "The=20

whole question is to know how to discern between the two."  Protestant Chri=
stians fail to find any=20

mention of angels in the Pentateuch, we may therefore leave them aside. The=
 Roman Catholics=20

and the Kabalists find such mention; the former, because they have accepted=
 Jewish angelology,=20

without suspecting that the "tsabaean Hosts" were colonists and settlers on=
 Judaean territory from=20

the lands of the Gentiles; the latter, because they accepted the bulk of th=

keeping the kernel for themselves and leaving the husks to the unwary.  Cor=

out and proves the meaning of the word _tsaba_ in the first verse of Chapte=

he does so correctly, guided, as he probably was, by learned Kabalists. The=
 Protestants are=20

certainly wrong in their contention, for angels _are_ mentioned in the Pent=
ateuch under the word=20

_tsaba_, which means "hosts" of angels. In the Vulgate the word is translat=
ed _ornatus_, meaning=20

arose and dressed=20

himself. It was plain, by a paleness still greater than usual, and by those=
 traces which loss of sleep=20

leaves on the face, that he must have passed almost the whole of the night =
without sleeping.=20

Contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided, there was this morning=
 in his personal=20

appearance something tardy and irresolute.  He was occupied with the prepar=
ations for Raoul's=20

departure and was seeking to gain time. In the first place he himself furbi=
shed a sword, which he=20

drew from its perfumed leather sheath; he examined it to see if its hilt wa=
s well guarded and if the=20

blade was firmly attached to the hilt. Then he placed at the bottom of the =
valise belonging to the=20

young man a small bag of louis, called Olivain, the lackey who had followed=
 him from Blois, and=20

made him pack the valise under his own eyes, watchful to see that everythin=
g should be put in=20

which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign.  At le=

_savants_ among the materialists, who failed to find "angels" mentioned by =
Moses, have thus=20

committed a serious error. For the verse reads:       Thus the heaven and t=

and all the host of     them,   the "host" meaning "the army of stars and a=
ngels"; the last two words=20

being, it seems, convertible terms in Church phraseology. A Lapide is cited=
 as an authority for this;=20
