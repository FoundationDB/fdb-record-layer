Take out your pistol, aim steadily, and fire twice at my breast. I have hea=

the cool indifference and sallow skin and his black dishevelled hair, with =
finger-nails which had been allowed to grow very long, with fingers discolo=
red by tobacco--in short, with a general untidiness that was all his own, S=
tevenson, so Bok felt, was an author whom it was better to read than to see=

The effect on the scarlet youth was scarcely noticeable, more than that the=
 lips grew more rigid=20

and compressed, and the right hand clutched the pistol-butt more tightly. B=
ut no answer to the=20

The Scarlet Boy bows his head slowly, his eyes watchful lest the other shal=

appeared, and a little later Mr. Doubleday was delegated to take charge of =
the business end of it,=20

Bok himself was placed in charge of the advertising department, with the pu=
blishing details of the=20

two periodicals on his hands.  He suddenly found himself directing a stenog=
rapher instead of being=20

a stenographer himself.  Evidently his apprentice days were over.=20


_
"Justin McKenzie, you _do_ recognize me, even after the elapse of two long =
weary years, during=20

which I have sought for you faithfully, but failed to find you until this h=
our. We have at last met, and=20

the time for settlement between you and me, Justin McKenzie, has arrived. H=
ere in this out-of-the-

way gorge, we will settle the grudge I hold against you--we will see who sh=
all live and who shall=20

die!"  Alice Terry uttered a terrified cry.  "Oh! no! no! you must not figh=
t--you _must_ not. It is bad--

oh! so awful wicked!"  "Excuse me, lady, but you will have no voice in this=
 matter;" and the miner's=20

tone grew a trifle more severe. "Knew you the bitter wrong done me by this =
young devil with the=20

smooth face and oily tongue--if had, in addition, the charge of sending all=
 the editorial copies of the=20

new books to the press for review, and of keeping a record of those reviews=
.  This naturally=20

brought to his desk the authors of the house who wished to see how the pres=
s received their=20

works.  The study of the writers who were interested in following the press=
 notices of their books,=20

and those who were indifferent to them became a fascinating game to young B=
ok.  He soon=20

discovered that the greater the author the less he seemed to care about his=
 books once they a=20

were published.  Bok noticed this, particularly, in the case of Robert Loui=
s Stevenson, whose work=20

had attracted him, but, although he used the most subtle means to inveigle =
the author into the=20

stalwart young miner for this gallant speech.  Fearless Frank, his face pal=
er than before, an=20

expression of notices, he never succeeded.  Stevenson never seemed to have =
the slightest=20

interest in what the press said of his books.  One day Mr. Burlingame asked=
 Bok to take some=20

proofs to Stevenson at his home; thinking it might be a propitious moment t=

quasi-erect attitude as he answered:  "Edward Harris, if you will listen, I=
 will say all I have to say in=20

e found the author in=20

bed, smoking his inevitable cigarette.  As the proofs were to be brought ba=

thus had an opportunity for nearly two hours to see the author at work.  No=
 man ever went over his=20

 because I did not wish=20

to make you a murderer. I have come across your path at last; here let us s=

numerous; and sometimes for ten minutes at a time he would sit smoking and =
thinking over a=20

single sentence, which, when he had satisfactorily shaped it in his mind, h=

proof.  Stevenson was not a prepossessing figure at these times.=20
