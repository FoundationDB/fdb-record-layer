 "Aja" (Purusha), "the unborn," or in a second he was on his feet again.  "=
Nothing broken?" asked De Guiche.  "Faith, no, thank Heaven!" replied Raoul=
; "but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murd=
ering?"  "I fear we arrived too late. They have killed them, I think, and t=
aken flight, carrying off their _
adherents of the Western Master, the proof of this lies in the very fact th=
at none of them can now=20

produce the promised "miracles." They have to choose: either it is they who=
 have blundered, or it=20

is their Master who must stand arraigned for an empty promise, an uncalled-=
for boast.(672) Why=20

such a difference in the destiny of the two? For the Occultist this enigma =
of the unequal favour of=20

Karma or Providence is unriddled by the Secret Doctrine.  It is "not lawful=
" to speak of such things=20

publicly, as St. Paul tells us. One more explanation only may be given in r=
eference to this subject.=20

It was said a few pages back that an Adept who thus sacrifices himself to l=
ive, giving up full=20

Nirvana, though he can never lose the knowledge acquired by him in previous=
 existences, yet can=20

never rise higher in such borrowed bodies. Why? Because he becomes simply t=
he vehicle of a=20

"Son of Light" from a still higher sphere, Who being Arupa, has no personal=
 astral body of His own=20

fit for this world. Such "Sons of Light," or Dhyani- Buddhas, are the Dharm=
akayas of preceding=20

Manvantaras, who have closed their cycles of incarnations in the ordinary s=
ense and who, being=20

thus Karmaless, have long ago dropped their individual Rupas, and have beco=
me identified with=20

the first Principle. Hence the necessity of a sacrificial Nirmanakaya, read=
y to suffer for discovered=20

two. De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man; and th=
e Spaniard, who had=20

advanced to meet Raoul, aimed in his turn, and Raoul felt a pain in the lef=
t arm, similar to that of a=20

blow from a whip. He let off his fire at but four paces. Struck in the brea=
st and extending his arms,=20

the Spaniard fell back on the crupper, and the terrified horse, turning aro=
und, carried him off.=20

Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him, and reme=
mbering the=20

recommendation of Athos, he, with the rapidity of lightning, made his horse=
 rear as the shot was=20

fired. His horse bounded to one side, losing its footing, and fell, entangl=
ing Raoul's leg under its=20

body. The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle, in orde=
r to strike Raoul on=20

the head with the butt. In the position in which Raoul lay, unfortunately, =
he could neither draw his=20

sword from the scabbard, nor his pistols from their holsters. The butt end =
of the musket hovered=20

over his head, and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes=
, when with one bound=20

Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat. "Yield!" he =
cried, "or you are a dead=20

man!" The musket fell from the soldier's hands, who yielded on the instant.=

ion and rebirth, since=20

there are no rebirths for him in the ordinary sense. The Higher Self, or Di=
vine Monad, is not in=20

such a case attached to the lower Ego; its connection is only temporary, an=
d in most cases it acts=20

through decrees of Karma. This is a real, genuine sacrifice, the explanatio=
n of which pertains to=20

the highest Initiation of Gnana (Occult Knowledge). It is closely linked, b=
y a direct evolution of=20

Spirit and involution of Matter, with the primeval and great Sacrifice at t=
he foundation of the=20

manifested Worlds, the gradual smothering and death of the spiritual in the=
 material. The seed "is=20

not quickened except it die."(673) Hence in the Purusha Sukta of the _Rig V=
eda_,(674) the=20

mother- fount and source of all subsequent religions, it is stated allegori=
cally that "the thousand-

headed Purusha" was slaughtered at the attempted to escape, he leaped from =
his horse and=20

approached Raoul.  "Faith, sir," said Raoul, smiling, although his pallor b=
etrayed the excitement=20

consequent on a first affair, "you are in a great hurry to pay your debts a=
nd have not been long=20

under any obligation to me. Without your aid," continued he, repeating the =
count's words "I should=20

have been a dead man--thrice dead."  "My antagonist took flight," replied D=
e Guiche "and left me=20

at liberty to come to your assistance. But are you seriously wounded? I see=
 you are covered with=20

blood!"  "I believe," said Raoul, "that I have got something like a scratch=
 on the arm. If you will help=20

me to drag myself from under my horse I hope nothing need prevent us contin=
uing our journey."=20

Monsieur d'Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting =
to raise the=20

struggling horse. At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stir=
rup and his leg=20
