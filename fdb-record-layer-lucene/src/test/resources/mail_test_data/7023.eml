his knees._] No, no! Don't, don't! You wouldn't 'ang the holdest servant in=
 the Deanery.  THE=20

DEAN.  Blore!  BLORE.  I did it! I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and =
I wanted this=20

gentleman's 'orse out of the way. And while you was mixing the dose with th=
e best ecclesiastical=20

intentions, I hintroduced a foreign element.  THE DEAN.  [_Pulling BLORE up=
 by his coat collar._]=20

Viper!  BLORE.  Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean.  SIR TRISTRAM=
.  The Dean?=20

BLORE.  The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes,=
 and I thought a=20

gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a certainty.  SIR TRISTRAM.  J=
edd!  GEORGIANA.=20

Augustin!  THE DEAN.  I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unwo=
rthy creature to back=20

Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund.  SIR TRISTRAM.  [_Shaking BLO=
RE._] And didn't=20

you do it?  BLORE.  No.  THE DEAN.  Why not? In the name of that tottering =
Spire, why not?=20

BLORE.  Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put=
 your cheerful little=20

offering on to Bonny Betsy.  [_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._  THE DEAN.  Oh!=
 [_To=20

BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act of disobedience=
. You are unworthy of=20

the Deanery. Leave it for some ordinary household.  BLORE.  If I leave the =
Deanery, I shall give=20

my reasons, and then what'll folks think of you and me in our old age?  THE=
 DEAN.  You wouldn't=20

spread this tale in St. Marvells?  BLORE.  Not if sober, sir--but suppose g=
rief drove me to my from=20

Ireland. He had been the companion of Louis Belgrave from their earliest ch=
ildhood; and as they=20

grew older they became the most consummate cronies. Felix almost worshipped=
 his friend, and=20

the friendship was mutual. He was a fair scholar, having attended the acade=
my at Von Blonk Park,=20

where they lived. He could speak the English language as well as a college =
professor; but he was=20

very much given to speaking with the Irish brogue, in honor of his mother h=
e insisted, and dragged=20

into his speech all the dialects known in the Green Isle, and perhaps suppl=
emented them with=20

some inventions of his own. That great American humorist might have said of=
 Felix just what he=20

did of the kangaroo.  Captain Scott had been a wild boy, in fact, a decided=
ly bad boy. He had been=20

picked up with his foster-father in the Bahamas. His only guardian bound hi=
m over to Captain=20

Royal Ringgold, the commander of the Guardian-Mother, who had thoroughly an=
d entirely=20

reformed his life and character. He was a natural-born sailor, and his abil=
ities were of a high order=20

in that direction. When the ship's company of the Maud was organized, Louis=
 had brought his=20

influence to bear in favor of electing him to the command, for which he was=
 vastly better qualified=20

than any other member of the "Big Four."  Squire Moses Scarburn, another of=
 the all-over-the-

world excursionists, was the trustee of Louis's million and a half. He was =
a jolly fat man, rising fifty=20

years old. He was a lawyer by profession, and had sat=20


_
THE DEAN.  I must save you from intemperance at any cost. Remain in my serv=
ice--a sad, sober=20

and, above all, a silent man!  [_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out =
through the=20

window._  SALOME.  Papa!  THE DEAN.  To your rooms! I am distracted!  SALOM=
E.  Major=20

Tarver and Mr. Darbey!----  THE DEAN.  If you have sufficiently merged all =
sense of moral=20

rectitude as to declare that I am not at home, do so.  SHEBA.  No, no. Papa=
; we have accidentally=20

discovered that you, our parent, have stooped to deception, if not to crime=
.  THE DEAN.=20

[_Staggering back._] Oh!  SHEBA.  We are still young--the sooner, therefore=
, we are removed=20

from any unfortunate influence the better.  SALOME.  We have an opportunity=
 of beginning life=20

afresh.  SHEBA.  These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us.  THE DEA=
N.  Then I _am_=20

at home. Where are they?  [_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHE=
BA. Directly they=20

have disappeared, NOAH the bench, and Louis had always been an immense favo=
rite with him.=20

He had taken Felix into his house as an orphan; and his housekeeper, Mrs. S=
arah Blossom, had=20

cared for him in his childhood, looked after his morals and the buttons on =
his shirts and trousers,=20

till she became very fond of him.  Just before the Guardian-Mother sailed o=
n her cruise from New=20

York, a couple of professional gentlemen, thrown overboard by the upsetting=
 of a sailing-yacht,=20

were rescued from a watery grave by the people on board of the steamer, lar=
gely by the exertions=20

of Louis. One of them was Dr. Philip Hawkes, one of the most noted medical =
men of the great city.=20

He was almost the counterpart of the trustee physically, weighing two hundr=
ed and twenty-six=20

pounds and three-quarters, while the lawyer fell a quarter of a pound short=
 of these figures. They=20

were continually bantering each other about this difference.  The doctor ca=
lled Uncle Moses, as=20

the=20


_
window, with HANNAH clinging to him._  NOAH.  [_Glaring round the room._] I=
s this 'ere the=20

Deanery?  [_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._  HANNAH.  Noahry, Noah=
, come=20

back!  NOAH.  Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my fa=
ce was unofficially=20

held downwards in the mud. The villain has been traced back to the Deanery.=
  SIR TRISTRAM.=20

Go away!  HANNAH.  Come away!  NOAH.  The man was a unknown lover of my noo=
ly made=20

wife!  GEORGIANA.  You mustn't bring your domestic affairs here; this is a =
subject for your own=20

fireside of an evening.  [_THE DEAN appears outside the window with SALOME,=
 SHEBA,=20

TARVER and DARBEY._  THE DEAN.  [_Outside._] Come in, Major Tarver--come in=
, Mr. Darbey!=20

NOAH.  That's his voice!  _THE DEAN enters, followed by SALOME, TARVER, SHE=
BA and=20

DARBEY._  NOAH.  [_Confronting THE DEAN._] "Brother Avoirdupois;" and the l=
awyer retorted by=20

christening the surgeon "Brother Adipose Tissue." The conductor of the part=
y in Egypt had called=20

them both "cupids;" and this term became very popular for the time. The oth=
er gentleman who had=20

been saved from an untimely grave in the bay was a learned Frenchman. Both =
of them were in=20

feeble health from overwork; and they accepted invitations to join the part=
y, the one as the medical=20

officer of the ship, and the other as the instructor in the languages as we=
ll as in the sciences=20

generally, for which he was abundantly competent.  Louis Belgrave, in passi=
ng through the=20

incidents of the story, had made the acquaintance of Mr. Lowell Woolridge, =
a Fifth Avenue=20

millionaire and magnate. He had formerly been a well-known sportsman; but h=
e had abandoned=20

the race-course, though he kept up=20


_
HANNAH.  No, no, Noahry!  GEORGIANA.  You're speaking to Dr. Jedd, the Dean=
 of St. Marvells.=20

NOAH.  I'm speaking to the man I took last night--the culprit as 'as allyna=
ted the affections of my=20

wife.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Wait--one moment! [_Going out at the window._  [_SALO=
ME and TARVER=20

go into the Library and sit at the writing-table. DARBEY sits in an arm-cha=
ir with SHEBA on the=20

arm._  THE DEAN.  [_Mildly._] Do not let us chide a man who is conscientiou=
s even in error.=20

[_Looking at HANNAH._] I think I see Hannah Evans, once an excellent cook u=
nder He was the=20

owner of a large sailing schooner; and through this craft Louis and his mot=
her became acquainted=20

with the yachtsman's family, consisting of his wife, a son, and a daughter.=
 The latter was a very=20

beautiful young lady of sixteen, whose face captivated everybody who came i=
nto her presence;=20

and Louis's mother had deemed it her duty to warn her son against the fasci=
nation of the maiden=20

before he had found his million.  A slight illness had threatened the young=
 lady with possible=20

consequences, and the physicians had advised her father to take=20
