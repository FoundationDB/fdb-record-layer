philodendron monstera of our expenses does not reduce them, but my wife refuses to learn by experience, and regularly every morning discusses our officer son, and tells me that bread, thank God, is cheaper, while sugar is a halfpenny dearer--with a tone and an air as though philodendron monstera of our expenses does not reduce them, but my wife refuses to learn by experience, and regularly every morning discusses our officer son, and tells me that bread, thank God, is cheaper, while sugar is a halfpenny dearer--with a tone and an air as though _
us be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man." With that he made for the city of Rhodes, and 

went straight to the gymnasium. There he fell to discussing philosophical subjects, and presents 

were bestowed upon him, so that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those 

who accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life. When his companions wished 

to return to their country, and asked him what message he wished them to carry home, he bade 

them say this: that children ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that could 

swim with them even out of a shipwreck.  2. These are indeed the true supports of life, and neither 

Fortune's adverse gale, nor political revolution, nor ravages of war can do them any harm. 

Developing the same idea, Theophrastus, urging men to acquire learning rather than to put their 

trust in money, states the case thus: "The man of learning is the only person in the world who is 

neither a stranger when in a foreign land, nor friendless when he has lost his intimates and 

relatives; on the contrary, he is a citizen of every country, and can fearlessly look down upon the 

troublesome accidents of fortune. But he who thinks himself entrenched in defences not of 

learning but of luck, moves in slippery mechanically move it closer and read it without any interest-

-in that way not long ago I mechanically read through in one night a whole novel, with the strange 

title "The Song the Lark was Singing"; or to occupy my attention I force myself to count to a 

thousand; or I imagine the face of one of my colleagues and begin trying to remember in what year 

and under what circumstances he entered the service. I like listening to sounds. Two rooms away 

from me my daughter Liza says something rapidly in her sleep, or my wife crosses the drawing-

room with a candle and invariably drops the matchbox; or a warped cupboard creaks; or the 

burner of the lamp suddenly begins to hum--and all these sounds, for some reason, excite me.  To 

lie awake at night means to be at every moment conscious of being abnormal, and so I look 

forward with impatience to the morning and the day when I have a right to be awake. Many 

wearisome hours pass before the cock crows in the yard. He is my first bringer of good tidings. As 

soon as he crows I know that within an hour the porter will wake up below, and, coughing angrily, 

will go upstairs to fetch something. And then a pale light will begin gradually glimmering at the 

windows, voices will sound in the street....  The day begins for me with the 


_
unsteadily and insecurely."  3. And Epicurus, in much the same way, says that the wise owe little 

to fortune; all that is greatest and essential is under the direction of the thinking power of the mind 

and the understanding. Many other philosophers have said the same thing. Likewise the poets 

who wrote the ancient comedies in Greek have expressed the same sentiments in their verses on 

the stage: for example, Eucrates, Chionides, Aristophanes, and with them Alexis in particular, who 

says that the Athenians ought to be praised for the me in her petticoat, before she has done her 

hair, but after she has washed, smelling of flower-scented eau-de-Cologne, looking as though she 

had come in by chance. Every time she says exactly the same thing: "Excuse me, I have just 

come in for a minute.... Have you had a bad night again?"  Then she puts out the lamp, sits down 

near the table, and begins talking. I am no prophet, but I know what she will talk about. Every 

morning it is exactly the same thing. Usually, after anxious inquiries concerning my health, she 

suddenly mentions our 


_
maintenance of parents by their children, the laws of the Athenians require this only in the case of 

those who have educated their children in the arts. All the gifts which fortune bestows she can 

easily take away; but education, when combined with intelligence, never fails, but abides steadily 

on to the very end of life.  4. Hence, I am very much obliged and infinitely grateful to my parents 

for their approval of this serving at Warsaw. After the twentieth of each month we send him fifty 

roubles, and that serves as the chief topic of our conversation.  "Of course it is difficult for us," my 

wife would sigh, "but until he is completely on his own feet it is our duty to help him. The boy is 

among strangers, his pay is small.... However, if you like, next month we won't send him fifty, but 

forty. What do you think?"  Daily experience
