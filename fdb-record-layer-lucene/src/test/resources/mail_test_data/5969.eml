M. le duc de Kernogan literally threw these words in Martin-Roget's face, the moment the latter had entered the room, and Frederick had discreetly closed the with a lot of 'em, but that was at fifty yards off, an' they tell me that you a'most ram the muzzle against the brutes' sides when chasin' buffalo.

M. le duc de Kernogan literally threw these words in Martin-Roget's face, the moment the latter had entered the room, and Frederick had discreetly closed the with a lot of 'em, but that was at fifty yards off, an' they tell me that you a'most ram the muzzle against the brutes' sides when chasin' buffalo.

of the awful massacres and wholesale executions of her own friends and kindred, that she should 

have eloped--like some flirtatious wench--and outraged her father in this monstrous fashion, by a 

clandestine marriage with a man of alien race and of a heretical religion! M. de Kernogan could not 

realise it. It passed the bounds of possibility. The very flames in the hearth seemed to dance and 

to mock the bare suggestion of such an atrocious transgression.  To this gloomy numbing of the 

senses had succeeded the inevitable morbid restlessness: the pacing up and down the narrow 

room, the furtive glances at the clock, the frequent orders to Frederick to go out and see if M. 

Martin-Roget was not yet home. For Frederick had come back after his first errand with the 

astounding news that M. Martin-Roget had left his lodgings the previous day at about four o'clock, 

and had not been seen or heard of since. In fact his landlady was very anxious about him and was 

sorely tempted to see the town-crier on the subject.  Four times did Frederick have to go from 

Laura Place to the Bear Inn in Union Street, where M. Martin-Roget lodged, and three times he 

returned with the news that nothing had been heard of Mounzeer yet. The fourth time--it was then 

close on midday--he came back running--thankful to bring discovered, so that the hunt had to be 

postponed to the following day.  A small clump of bushes afforded wood enough for camp-fires. 

The carts were ranged in a circle with the trains outward.  Sentries were posted; the horses were 

secured; the kettles put on; pipes lighted; and noise, laughter, song and story, mingled with the 

shrill voices of children, were heard far on into the night.  Among the children, if we may venture 

so to class them, were Archie and Billie Sinclair--though we suspect that Archie would have 

claimed, and with some reason, to be classed with the men.  They belonged to the camp-fire, 

which formed a centre to the party composed of Dan and Peter, Fergus, Dechamp, and Fred 

Jenkins the sailor.  The latter, who it was thought had come out to the country by way of a skylark 

rather than as a settler, had followed the hunters, bent, he said, on firing a broadside into a 

buffalo.  He had brought with him a blunderbuss, which he averred had been used by his great-

grandfather at the battle of Culloden.  It was a formidable old weapon, capable of swallowing, at 

one gulp, several of the bullets which fitted the trading guns of the country.  Its powers of 

scattering ordinary shot in large quantity had proved to be very effective, and had done such 

execution among flocks of

Place to the Bear Inn. M. Martin-Roget had come home. He appeared very tired and in rare ill-

humour: but Frederick had delivered the message from M. le duc, whereupon M. Martin-Roget had 

become most affable and promised that he would come round immediately. In fact he was even 

then treading hard on Frederick's heels.   III  "My daughter has gone! She left the ball 

clandestinely last night, and was the Indians and half-breeds, although at first inclined to laugh at 

it, were ultimately filled with respect.  "I doubt its capacity for sending ball straight, however," 

remarked Dan to Jenkins, who was carefully cleaning out the piece, "especially if charged with 

more than one ball."  "No fear of it," returned the sailor, with a confident air.  "Of course it scattered
