Plato's life. Nor must we forget that in all his numerous citations from th=
e Platonic writings he=20

never attributes any passage found in the extant dialogues to any one but P=
lato. And lastly, we=20

may remark that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the P=
oliticus, which are=20

wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly attributed to P=
lato, on the ground of (2)=20

length, (3) excellence, and (4) accordance with the general spirit of his w=
ritings. Indeed the greater=20

part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be su=
mmed up under two=20

heads only: (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of tradition--a kind of evid=
ence, which though in=20

many cases sufficient, is of inferior value.  Proceeding upon these princip=
les we appear to arrive at=20

the conclusion that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever=
 been ascribed to Plato,=20

are undoubtedly genuine. There is another portion of them, including the Ep=
istles, the Epinomis,=20

the dialogues rejected by the ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De=
 justo, De virtute,=20

Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and extern=
al evidence, we are=20

able with distinctive about the personality of this man: his method of doin=
g things and his way of=20

saying things.  Bok observed everything Colonel Roosevelt did and read ever=
ything he wrote.  The=20

editor now sought an opportunity to know personally the man whom he admired=
.  It came at a=20

dinner at the University Club, and Colonel Roosevelt suggested that they me=
et there the following=20

day for a "talk-fest."  For three hours the two talked together.  The fact =
that Colonel Roosevelt was=20

of Dutch ancestry interested Bok; that Bok was actually of Dutch birth made=
 a strong appeal to the=20

Colonel.  With his tremendous breadth of interests, Roosevelt, Bok found, h=
ad followed him quite=20

closely in his work, and was familiar with "its high points," as he called =
them.  "We must work for=20

the same ends," said the Colonel, "you in your way, I in mine.  But our lin=
es are bound to cross.=20

You and I can each become good Americans by giving our best to make America=
 better.  With the=20

Dutch stock there is in both of us, there's no limit to what we can do.  Le=
t's go to it."  Naturally that=20

talk left the two firm friends.  Bok felt somehow that he had been given a =
new draft of=20

Americanism; the word took on a new meaning for him; it stood for something=
 different, something=20

deeper and finer than=20


_
still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that =
they are genuine or=20

spurious. They may have been written in youth, or possibly like the works o=
f some painters, may=20

be partly or wholly the compositions of pupils; or they may have been the w=
ritings of some=20

contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato, =
or of some Platonist=20

in the next generation who aspired to imitate his master. Not that on groun=
ds either of language or=20

philosophy we should lightly reject them. Some difference of style, or infe=
riority of execution, or=20

inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive of their spurio=
us character. For who=20

always does justice to himself, or who writes with equal care at all times?=
 Certainly not Plato, who=20

exhibits the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of se=
ntences, and in the use=20

of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his later ones, say the=
 Protagoras or Phaedrus=20

with the Laws. Or who can be expected to think in the same manner during a =
period of authorship=20

Roosevelt deepened the feeling and stirred Bok's deepest ambitions. "Go to =
it, you Dutchman,"=20

Roosevelt would say, and Bok would go to it. A talk with Roosevelt always l=
eft him feeling as if=20

mountains were the easiest things in the world to move.  One of Theodore Ro=
osevelt's arguments=20

which made a deep impression upon Bok was that no man had a right to devote=
 his entire life to=20

the making of money.  "You are in a peculiar position," said the man of Oys=
ter Bay one day to Bok;=20

"you are in that happy position where you can make money and do good at the=
 same time.  A man=20

wields a tremendous power for good or for evil who is welcomed into a milli=
on homes and read=20

with confidence.  That's fine, and is all right so far as it goes, and in y=
our case it goes very far.=20

Still, there remains more for you to do. The public has built up for you a =
personality: now give that=20

personality to whatever interests you in contact with your immediate fellow=
-men: something in your=20

neighborhood, your city, or your State. With one hand work and write to you=
r national audience: let=20

no=20


_
of great intellectual activity, as well as of political and literary transi=
tion? Certainly not Plato, whose=20

earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide an interval o=
f philosophical=20

speculation as that which separates his later writings from sway you.  Hew =
close to the line.  But,=20

with the other hand, swing into the life immediately around you.  Think it =
over."  Bok did think it=20

over.  He was now realizing the dream of his life for which he had worked: =
his means were=20

sufficient to give his mother every=20


_
The dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which a=
ppear to have the=20

next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings, are the Lesser Hippi=
as, the Menexenus or=20

Funeral Oration, the First Alcibiades. Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the=
 Funeral Oration are=20

cited by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetori=
c. Neither of them are=20

expressly attributed to Plato, she chose to live; to make it possible for h=
er to spend the winters in=20

the United States and the summers in the Netherlands, and thus to keep in t=
ouch with her family=20

and friends in both countries.  He had for years toiled unceasingly to reac=
h this point: he felt he=20

had now achieved at least one goal.  He had now turned instinctively to the=
 making of a home for=20

himself. After an engagement of four years he had=20


_
citation of both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant=
 dialogues. From the=20

mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps infer tha=
t he was unacquainted=20

with a second dialogue bearing the same name. Moreover, the mere existence =
of a Greater and=20

Lesser Hippias, and of a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain ext=
ent throw a doubt upon=20

both of them. Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias d=
oes not appear to=20

contain anything beyond the 1896, to Mary Louise Curtis, the only child of =
Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus H.=20

K. Curtis; two sons had been born to them; he had built and was occupying a=
 house at Merion,=20

Pennsylvania, a suburb six miles from the Philadelphia City Hall.  When she=
 was in this country his=20

mother lived with him, and also his brother, and, with a strong belief in l=
ife insurance, he had seen=20

to it that his family was provided for in case of personal incapacity or of=
 his demise.  In other=20

words, he felt that he had put his own house=20


_
of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent. The motive or leading thought =
of the dialogue may be=20

detected in Xen. Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which=
 is taken from Xenophon=20

in an undoubted dialogue of Plato. On the other hand, the upholders of the =
genuineness of the=20

dialogue will find in the Hippias a true Socratic spirit; every man's duty:=
 to be, first of all, a careful=20

and adequate provider for his family.  He was now at the point where he cou=
ld begin to work for=20

another goal, the goal that he felt so few American men saw: the point in h=
is life where he could=20

retire from the call of duty and follow the call of inclination.  At the ag=
e of forty he tried to look=20
