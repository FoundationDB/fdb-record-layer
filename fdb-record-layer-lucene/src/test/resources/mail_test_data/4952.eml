seen from the deck of the vessels. After the business of outwitting the ene=
my on board of the=20

Fatime, which was an episode in the voyage forced upon the commander and hi=
s confidants, the=20

steamers would pass through the Suez Canal, and proceed by the Red Sea to t=
he Indian Ocean.=20

A written list of about a dozen subjects had been given out to the students=
 on the wing, as Dr.=20

Hawkes called the class of five who profited systematically by the instruct=
ions of Professor Giroud,=20

though all on both steamers were more or less engaged in study. The first o=
f these were the Land=20

of Goshen and Mount Sinai. As the little squadron was to pass near the terr=
itory of the ancient=20

kingdoms of Assyria, Babylon, and Syria, and the more modern realm of Moham=
med and the=20

Caliphate of Bagdad, these subjects were to follow later. At any rate, the =
peripatetic students had=20

enough to prevent their active minds from becoming rusty.  It was not for t=
wo hours that Captain=20

Scott and Louis Belgrave found another opportunity to consider the alleged =
mistake, as the former=20

regarded it; for the latter belonged to the port watch, and served with Mor=
ris. But when the Maud=20

had made twenty miles more, they were together again, with Felix on the loo=
kout; for he was one=20

of the triumvirate on board in charge of the secret.  Louis took a seat in =
the pilot-house on one side=20

of the wheel, while Scott was on the other. The Guardian-Mother was not a m=
ile ahead of the=20

Maud. The young captain had already studied up the chart, and the details o=
f the manoeuvre=20

contemplated had been already arranged, so far as it was possible to do so.=
  "The ship does not=20

seem to be letting herself out yet according to the programme," said Captai=
n Scott, when Louis=20

took his place near him, and Felix was using his glass, which had become hi=
s constant companion=20



in observing the movements of the Moorish steamer.  "Captain Ringgold knows=
 what he is about,"=20

suggested the other.  "Of course he does; but I supposed he would give his =

Captain," replied the lookoutman; "but she does not give the signal yet."  =
"Keep your ears wide=20

open tight, Flix, for it will come soon. Where is the pirate now?"  "She is=
 directly in range with the=20

Guardian-Mother."  If the Fatime had not herself been engaged in piratical =
proceedings, her owner=20

was responsible for the employment of her present commander on board the fe=
lucca Samothraki,=20

f them, out of the Maud;=20
