philodendron monstera to git one when de niggah die. We sung songs and my ma she say a Bible vurs what Ole Missy don lernt her. Be vurs, lawsy me, chile, suah wish I could member hit for you. Dem songs? I don jes recollek, but hit seem lak de must have something high to express. In the pictures at our exhibitions there may be great technical skill; I take it for granted there is; but in the subject surely there is a void, an appearance of painful seeking for philodendron monstera to git one when de niggah die.

uncommon humanity will find it difficult to avoid using them, unless it has the courage of its 

convictions to the same extent as George Fox, the Quaker, who encased himself in an entire suit 

of home-made leather, bearing the impress of

"Yes maam, my people de liv on a big plantation neah de Little Rock an we all hoe cotton. My Ma? 

Lawzy me, chile, she name Zola Young an my pappy he name Nelson Young. I had broddehs 

Danel, Freeman, George, Will, and Henry. Yes maam, Freeman he de younges an bahn after we 

done got free. An I had sistehs by de name ob Isabella, Mary, Nora,--dat aint all yet, you want I 

should name em all? Well then they was too Celie, Sally, and me Cindy but I aint my own sisteh is

one you know, she name,--now--let-me-see, does--I--ricollek, lawzy me, chile, I suah fin it hard to 

member some things. O! yes,--her name hit war Missy Nancy, an her chilluns dey name Little

when Ole Massa he name Marse Stuart lessen my pappy he be raised by nother Massa fore 

Marse Louis got him, and defied a mechanical and degenerate world. The only practical question 

is whether the manufactures shall be good or bad, well-designed or ill; South Kensington answers, 

that if training can do it, they shall be good and well designed.  There are the manufacturing 

multitudes of England; they must have work, and find markets for their work; if machines and the 

Black Country are ugly, famine would be uglier still. I have no instruction to give you, and you 

would not thank me for wasting your time with rhetorical praise of art, even if I had all the flowers 

of diction at my command. To me, as an outer barbarian, it seems that some of the language on 

these subjects is already pretty high pitched. I have thought so even in reading that one of Mr. 

Addington Symond's most attractive volumes about Italy which relates to Italian art. Art is the 

interpreter of beauty, and perhaps beauty, if we could penetrate to its essence, might reveal to us

heerd him say.  "Yes maam, chile I suah like dem days. We had lot ob fun an nothin to worrify 

about, suah wish dem days wus now, chile, us niggahs heaps better off den as now. Us always 

had plenty eat and plenty wearin close too, which us aint nevah got no more. We had plenty cahn 

pone, baked in de ashes too, hee, hee, hee, it shore wus good, an we had side meat, an we had 

other eatin too, what ever de Ole Marse had, but I like de side meat bes. I had a good dress for 

Sunday too but aint got none dese days, jes looky, chile, dese ole rags de bes I got. My Sunday 

dress? Lawzy me, chile, hit were alway a bright red cotton. I suah member dat color, us dye de 

cotton right on de plantation mostly. Other close I dont ezackly ricollek, but de mostly dark, no 

colahs.  "My ma, she boss all de funerls ob de niggahs on de plantation an she got a long white 

veil for wearin, lawzy me, chile, she suah look bootiful, jes lak a bride she did when she boss dem 

funerls in dat veil. She not much skeered nether fo dat veil connoisseurship priesthood. To 

happiness Art lends intensity and elevation; but in affliction, in ruin, in the wreck of affection how 

much can Phidias and Raphael do for you? A poet makes Goethe say to a sceptical and 

perplexed world, "Art still has truth, take refuge there." It would be a poor refuge for most of us; it 

was so even for the great Goethe; for with all his intellectual splendour, his character never rose 

above a grandiose and statuesque self-love; he behaved ill to his country, ill to women. Instead of 

being religion, Art seems, for its own perfection, to need religion--not a system of dogma, but a 

faith. This, probably, we all feel when we look at the paintings in the Church of Assisi or in the 

Arena Chapel at Padua. Perhaps those paintings also gain something by being in the proper place 

for religious art, a Church. Since the divorce of religious art from religion, it has been common to 

see a Crucifixion hung over a sideboard. That age was an age of faith; and so most likely was the

Wisht I had me dat veil right now, mout hep cure dis remutizics in ma knee what ailin me so bad. I 

disrememba, but I sposen she got buried in dat veil, chile. She hoe de cotton so Ole Marse Louis 

he always let her off fo de buryings cause she know how to manage de other niggahs and keep 

dem quiet at de funerls.  "No maam, chile, we didn't hab no Preacher-mans much, an age of 

doubt, an age of doubt and of strange cross currents and eddies of opinion, ultra scepticism 

penning its books in the closet while the ecclesiastical forms of the Middle Ages stalk the streets. 

Art seems to feel the disturbing influence like the rest of life. Poetry feels it less than other arts, 

because there is a poetry of doubt and Tennyson is its poet.
