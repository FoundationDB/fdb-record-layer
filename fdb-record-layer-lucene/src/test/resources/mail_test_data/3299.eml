second! who, after securing his fiddle, that had stranded on a mud-bank, sc=
rambled up the steep=20

slope, amidst the roars of laughter of my people and of ourselves; while th=
e perverse mule, having=20

turned harmony into discord, kicked up its heels and galloped off, braying =
an ode in praise of=20

liberty, as the "Lay of the last Minstrel." The discomfited fiddler was wip=
ed down by my Tokrooris,=20

who occasionally burst into renewed fits of laughter during the operation; =
the mule was caught,=20

and the minstrel remounted, and returned home completely out of tune.  On t=
he following morning,=20

at sunrise, I mounted my horse, and, accompanied by Taher Noor and Bacheet,=
 I rode to pay my=20

respects to Mek Nimmur. Our route lay parallel to the stream, and, after a =
ride of about two miles=20

through a fine, park-like country, bounded by the Abyssinian Alps about fif=
teen miles distant, I=20

observed a crowd of people round a large tamarind tree, near which were sta=
nding a number of=20

horses, mules, and dromedaries. This was the spot upon which I was to meet =
Mek Nimmur. Upon=20

my approach the crowd opened, and, having dismounted, I was introduced by T=
aher Noor to the=20

great chief. He was a man of about fifty, and exceedingly dirty in appearan=
ce. He sat upon an=20

angarep, surrounded by his people; lying on either side upon his seat were =
two brace of pistols,=20

and within a few yards stood his horse ready saddled. He was prepared for f=
ight or flight, as were=20

also his ruffianly-looking followers, who were composed of Abyssinians and =
Jaleens.  I=20

commenced the conversation by referring to the hospitality shown by his fat=
her to my countryman,=20

Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, and I assured him that such kind attentions were nev=
er forgotten by an=20

Englishman, therefore I had determined to visit him, although the Egyptian =
authorities had=20

cautioned me not to trust myself within his territory. I explained that I w=
as bound towards an=20

unknown point, in search of the sources of the White Nile, which might occu=
py some years, but=20

that I wished to perfect the exploration by the examination of all the Abys=
sinian Nile affluents: and I=20

concluded by asking for his assistance in my journey to the Bahr Angrab and=
 the Salaam. He=20

replied very politely, and gave me much local information; he said that the=
 Egyptians gave him no=20

peace, that he was obliged to fight in self-defence; but that, if I could m=
ake overtures on his part to=20

the Egyptian authorities, he would engage never to cross the Atbara, provid=
ed they observed a=20

similar condition. I promised to represent his offer to the Governor-Genera=
l on my arrival at=20

Khartoum. He agreed to give me a guide to the rivers Glogova."  The lawyer =
tossed about on the=20

snow-white pillows, from which an odor of spring emanated (they had been ou=
t in the garden to air=20

the day before).  "Never mind," thought he, "the umbrella is mine after all=
. I can prove it in a court=20

of justice if necessary. I have witnesses. There are Mr. Sztolarik, Mrs. Mu=
encz and her sons, the=20

whole town of Besztercebanya."  Then he laughed bitterly.  "And yet, what a=
m I thinking of? I can't=20

prove it, for, after all, the umbrella does not belong to me, but to the Mu=
encz family, for the old=20

man bought it. So only that which is in the handle belongs to me. But can I=
 go to the priest and=20

say: 'Your reverence, in the handle of the umbrella is a check for 200,000 =
or 300,000 florins,=20

please give it to me, for it belongs of right to me'?"  Then Gyuri began to=
 wonder what the priest=20

would answer. He either believed the legend of the umbrella, and would then=
 say: "Go along, do!=20

St. Peter is not such a fool as to bring you a check on a bank from Heaven!=
" Or if he did look in the=20

handle and find the receipt, he would say: "Well, if he did bring it, he ev=
idently meant it for me."=20

And he would take it out and keep it. Why should he give it to Gyuri? How w=
as he to prove it=20

belonged to him?  "Supposing," thought our hero, "I were to tell him the wh=
ole story, about my=20

mother, about my father, and all the circumstances attending his death. Let=
 us imagine he would=20



believe it from Alpha to Omega; of what use would it be? Does it prove that=
 the treasure is mine?=20

Certainly not. And even if it did, would he give it to me? A priest is only=
 a man after all. Could I=20

have a lawsuit, if he would not give it me? What nonsense! Of course not. H=
e might take the=20

receipt out of the handle, and what proofs can I bring then that it was eve=
r in it?"  The perspiration=20

stood on his forehead; he bit the bed-clothes in his helpless rage. To be s=
o near to his inheritance,=20

and yet not be able to seize hold of it!  "Black night, give counsel!" was =
Gyuri's prayer. And it is=20

best, after all, to turn to the night for help. Gyuri was right to ask its =
advice, for it is a good friend to=20

thought. Among the Golden Rules should be written: "Think over all your act=
ions by night, even if=20

you have decided by day what course to take!" For a man has night thoughts =
and day thoughts,=20

though I do not know which are the better. I rather think neither kind is p=
erfect. For daylight, like a=20

weaver, works its colors into one's thoughts, and night covers them with it=
s black wings. Both of=20

them paint, increase and decrease things--in one word, falsify them. Night =
shows the beloved one=20

more beautiful than he=20


_
Salaam, that were not far distant, and he at once pointed out to me the two=
 dark gorges, about=20

twelve and sixteen miles distant, in the chain of precipitous mountains fro=
m which they flowed. He=20

described the country upon the other side of the mountains to be the elevat=
ed plateau of=20

Abyssinia, and he advised me to visit the king before my departure from his=
 territory; one's=20

enemies, increases one's troubles, diminishes one's joy. It is not kind of =
it; but night is sovereign,=20

and is answerable to no one for its actions. Take things as they come, but =
do not put aside serious=20

thought when you are seeking the truth. Though, of course, you do not reall=
y seek the truth; even=20

if it comes to meet you, you get out of its way. I ought to=20
