in the following January Ricafort concluded that "this dual command was imp=
ossible," and=20

restricted the intendant to certain routine functions, at the same time ask=
ing the approval of the=20

home government for this proceeding. He had brought with him a portrait of =
Fernando VII,=20

presented by the king to his colony of Filipinas; the municipal council of =
Manila decided to pay this=20

portrait the same honors as if the king himself had visited the islands, an=
d during the week of=20

December 19-25 festivities of every kind were conducted, with the utmost di=
splay and=20

magnificence. (Five years later, orders from the Spanish government were re=
ceived at Manila,=20

censuring the extravagant expenditures on that occasion, said, to amount to=
 some 16,000 pesos,=20

as an unwarranted and blamable use of municipal funds, and regulating, for =
the future,=20

expenditures of this sort.) A royal decree of June 8, 1826, ordained that t=
he secularization of=20

parish curacies should cease, and that those ministries should be restored =
to the religious orders,=20

which was accordingly done. On September 15 of that year Fray Hilarin Diez,=
 an Augustinian, took=20

possession of the archbishopric of Manila, replacing Zulaibar, who had died=
 on March 4, 1824. In=20

June a circular letter was sent by Ricafort to the provincial governors, re=
minding them of the law=20

(art. 26 of the "Ordinances of good government") which forbade them to hind=
er in any way the=20

trade in the products of the provinces, whether by Spaniards, natives, or m=
estizos, and whether in=20

kind or with money, ordering them to permit trade freely everywhere, withou=
t any delays or=20

exactions against those doing business. In 1827 Ricafort sent an expedition=
 against Jol, which=20

was kept off by the valor of the Joloans; but the Spaniards burned and rava=
ged the settlements on=20

the shores of Illana Bay, doing the Moros much damage. In that same year th=
e Spanish=20

government restablished the naval bureau at Manila, independent of the capt=
ain-general, and=20

Pascual Enrile was appointed as its chief; he proceeded to reorganize all b=
ranches of the service,=20

including that intended to serve childish confidence in the infallibility o=
f text-book misinformation,=20

on reading in Prescott=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CConquest in Mexico=E2=80=9D that =
Cortez obtained sulphur to replenish his stock=20

of powder by lowering one of his soldiers into the crater of Popocatepetl. =
He wondered how so=20

reputable a historian as Prescott had been induced to credit such an extrav=
agant =E2=80=9Cyarn=E2=80=9D on the=20

part of the Spanish chronicler. To his youthful fancy, fired by the teachin=
gs of primary geographies,=20

a volcano was a sort of chimney to a titanic iron furnace in full blast; in=
deed, he would have=20

supposed it safer to descend into an iron furnace than into the crater. He =
speculated long on the=20

matter, and wondered if fire-proof dresses were known in those days.  No sm=
all part of the non-

traveling public has similar misconceptions of the character of volcanoes; =
and to obtain the truth it=20

is not so necessary to learn as to unlearn. The description quoted from the=
 old text-book is false in=20

every particular. The mountain can not be said to be burning any more than =
melted lead. Nor does=20

anything that answers to either smoke or flame issue from it. Be it known t=
o all, that the greatest=20

portion of the surface of an active crater is usually covered with a solid =
crust, in which there may=20

be a small fiery lake, or inner secondary cone or crater. Into many craters=
 it is possible therefore to=20

descend: and into one volcano of the Mediterranean Sea an enterprising Scot=
ch firm have long=20

had quite remunerative chemical works.  The name is taken from one of the L=
ipari Islands--a small=20

group near Sicily--which was known to the ancients as Vulcano. When the Rom=
ans imported the=20

Grecian god, Hephaistos, to be their chief blacksmith, they assigned him Vu=
lcano as his forge, and=20

rechristened the lame old fellow with the adjective appellation of Vulcanus=
.  Men much prefer the=20



marvellous or mysterious to the true. And, while their reverence is of a me=
rely superstitious sort,=20

the reverence of the ignorant often surpasses that of the learned. A supers=
titious people readily=20

manufactured a myth to explain the awe-inspiring demonstrations of volcanoe=
s; and the myth=20

itself, because of its religious character, would discourage any attempt to=
 closely=20


_
whom he was able to restrain to a great extent; and he constructed several =
cruisers and other=20

vessels, one of which remained in active service for forty years. He establ=
ished the jurisdiction of=20

the bureau throughout the archipelago, creating port-captains for Iloilo, C=
apiz, Ceb, and=20

Pangasinn. Ever since the insurrection of 1744 in Bohol, caused by the impr=
udence of the Jesuit=20

Morales, the insurgents had (under their chief Dagohoy) maintained hostilit=
ies, not only against the=20

Spaniards, but even harassing their own countrymen who occupied the coastal=
 villages of that=20

island. The Recollects, in charge of the missions of Bohol after the expuls=
ion of the Jesuits, tried to=20

persuade the rebels to submit to Spanish authority, and secured from Govern=
or Raon a general=20

amnesty for them; but it resulted only in their defying further the authori=
ty of the government, which=20

was long unable to take any measures for subduing them. Finally, in 1827, t=
he danger to the loyal=20

villages of Bohol was so menacing that the authorities were compelled to pr=
otect them and reduce=20

the insurgents; and to this end Ricafort sent powerful expeditions (May, 18=
27, and April, 1828),=20

which after strenuous efforts compelled the rebels to submit. [19] That gov=
ernor accomplished=20

much during his term of office for the as sacrilege and impiety. There are =
similar volcano myths in=20

the island and Asiatic world. So firm was the belief of the Sandwich Island=
ers in the certainty of=20

dire vengeance upon all who trespassed on the domain of Pele, the goddess o=
f Kilauea, that when=20

a princess of the blood royal safely defied the goddess, ate her sacred ber=
ries, and threw rocks=20

into her boiling lake, the people at once abandoned their whole race of god=
s. If there was no Pele,=20

they knew of no god. Such reasons prevented the ancients and the barbarian =
world from obtaining=20

any light on volcanic action.  Similar causes operated with equal force to =
hinder investigation=20

during the middle and dark ages. Christian teachers seized upon them as con=
venient openings to=20

the abode of eternal torment. The Arian heretic, the Emperor Theodosius, wa=
s assigned to=20

Vulcano; while poor Anne Boleyn, for whose sake the =E2=80=9CDefender of th=
e Faith=E2=80=9D defied the Pope, was=20

sent by the latter to Mt. =C3=86tna, as the shortest route to her destinati=
on.  Similar ideas are noticed=20

among semi-barbarous races. The Aztecs deemed Popocatepetl, the greatest of=
 their volcanoes,=20

to be the place of punishment for wicked rulers. These gentry were supposed=
 to cherish no good=20

will toward their subjects, whose complaints had brought them to that place=
 of torment,=20


_
native gobernadorcillos should furnish to agriculturists the idle and unocc=
upied Indians within their=20

jurisdictions, to work on the estates, these laborers being paid their dail=
y wages; and on October=20

30, 1827, that all complaints in civil cases relating to farm laborers shou=
ld be settled by the=20

magistrates as promptly and simply as possible, "observing the contracts an=
d usages of the=20

Indians, when these are not unjust," and that no Indian laborer should be i=
mprisoned for a purely=20

civil debt (save those to the royal exchequer), nor should his animals, too=
ls, lands, or house be=20

seized therefor. The Spanish minister of the exchequer, Luis Lpez Ballester=
os, also took a=20

paternal interest in the islands, and secured royal decrees for the benefit=
 of their industries. One of=20

these (dated April 6, 1828) encouraged the importation into Filipinas of al=
l machinery suitable for=20

spinning and weaving cotton, offered public aid to private enterprises for =
improvement in weaving=20

and dyeing, and promised protection and encouragement to all projects for p=
romoting native=20

manufactures of cloth; and made the exportation of raw cotton from the isla=
nds free, in order to=20

promote the cultivation of that plant. Another decree (of the same date) pe=
rmitted the free=20

importation of all kinds of agricultural machinery and implements into Fili=
pinas; and authorized=20

premiums and rewards from the public funds to Filipino farmers who should f=
irst make large=20

plantations of vengeance. The people held them in great awe, and were wont =
to invoke the aid of=20

the gods when it became necessary to travel near the volcanoes. It is relat=
ed that the high priest,=20

Tezozomoc, was wont to give aloe-leaves inscribed with sacred characters, t=
o such persons.=20

These leaves were amulets to preserve the wearer from harm. Southey uses th=
is story in=20

_Madoc_:          =E2=80=9CSo ye may safely pass     Between the mountains,=
 which in endless war,     Hurtle=20

with horrible uproar, and frush     Of rocks, that meet in battle.=E2=80=9D=
  This mountain was in eruption=20

when Cortes reached Tlascala on his march to Mexico. It was believed to bod=
e evil to the people=20

of Anahuac. Learning the native superstition, Diego de Ordaz, captain of ar=
tillery, determined to=20

beard the demons in their den, and with some companions ascended the mounta=
in. Their safe=20

return convinced the natives that the Spaniards were in league with the spi=
rits, and did much to=20

dishearten them. In memory of this feat, the Ordaz family has a volcano pic=
tured on its coat of=20

arms.  The Javanese call their greatest volcano Maha-Meru. Meru, in the San=
scrit mythology, was=20

the home of Brahma, and the Malays, having adopted the legend, consider the=
ir greatest volcano=20

the fittest symbol of his throne and power.  [Illustration: AT THE SUMMIT O=
F POPOCATEPETL.]=20

Virgil=E2=80=99s =C3=86neid affords a passage containing the Roman myth con=
cerning Mt. =C3=86tna, and showing=20

and cloves, as also to those who should make most progress in the plantatio=
ns of Chinese=20

cinnamon [caneln], tea, and mulberry-trees, and in raising silk, etc. Those=
 who kept in cultivation a=20

certain area of land, and day-laborers who continued to work for a certain =
number of years, were=20

exempted from paying tributes; and the native farmers were allowed to keep =
cockpits in operation=20

daily and without tax, on the estates which they cultivated. "In spite of s=
o many privileges, not=20

many of them were inclined to the cultivation of their fields." Another roy=
al order (April 6, 1828)=20

made important regulations regarding the Chinese residing in the islands; t=
hey were to be=20

gathered into villages, as were the Indians; their heads of barangay were t=
o collect the tributes, as=20

in the Indian villages, being allowed three per cent of the collections for=
 their trouble; they were=20
