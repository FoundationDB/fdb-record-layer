Our beacon is never quenched to the wanderer of the night,      nor has eve=
r a guest blamed us=20

where men meet together.    Our Days[3] are famous among our foemen, of fai=
r report,=20

branded and blazed with glory like noble horses.    Our swords have swept t=
hroughout all lands=20

both west and east,      and gathered many a notch from the steel of hauber=
k-wearers;    Not used=20

are they when drawn to be laid back in the sheaths      before that the fol=
k they meet are spoiled=20

and scattered.    If thou knowest not, ask men what they think of us and th=
em      --not alike are he=20

t of their people's mill,=20

--around them it turns and whirls, while they stand midmost.[4]  The renown=
 of the clan was=20

closely wrapped up with the Arab chieftain's personal renown. He was keenly=
 sensitive on the=20

point of honour, and to that notion he attached a breadth of meaning which =
can scarcely be=20

understood in these days. Honour included all the different virtues that we=
nt to make up the ideal=20

all things, the man=20

who would 'keep his honour and defile it not' must be brave and hospitable-=

doubly dear,       God grant it may not be     That thou in heaven should=
=E2=80=99st ever hear       How much=20

we mourn for thee.      One after one the seasons wane,--       Our loss, i=
t grows not less;     Time=E2=80=99s=20

balm is vain to heal the pain       Of such a loneliness.      O little gra=

 blissful rest naught shall molest,--=20

_Death cannot enter there_.          AMONG THE LILIES.       Among the lili=

Our Easter lily, so fair and sweet,--     A flower too fair and frail to ke=

and pain must meet.      Among the lilies in Paradise       (O sweeter than=
 Eden, God=E2=80=99s garden=20

The Arab warrior was a mighty man of valour. He would spend whole days in t=

sweeping down upon the caravan of rich merchandise which his more peaceful =
countrymen of the=20

towns were carrying through the deserts. The Arab lived mainly by plunder. =

Bedawee's bread--and he relied on the success of his foraging expeditions f=
or his support. These=20

he conducted with perfect good-breeding; he used no violence when it could =
be avoided; he=20

merely relieved the caravan from the trouble of carrying any further the go=
ods that he was himself=20

willing to take charge of, urging, if necessary, the unfair treatment of hi=
s forefather Ishmael as an=20

excellent reason for pillaging the sons of Isaac. 'When a woman is the vict=
im, no Bedouin brigand,=20

however rude, will be ill-mannered enough to lay hands upon her. He begs he=
r to take off the=20

garment on which he has set his heart, and he then retires to a distance an=
d stands with eyes=20

averted, lest he should do violence to her modesty.'  The poems of the earl=
y Arabs are full of the=20

deeds of their warriors, the excitement of the pitched battle, the delight =
of the pursuit, the nightly=20

raid on the camp, the trial of skill between rival chiefs, and the other pi=
ctures of a warrior's triumph.=20

Here we find little of the generosity of war: mercy was rarely exercised an=
d hatred was carried to=20

its extremest limits; quarter was neither asked nor given; to despatch a wo=
unded man was no=20

disgrace; the families of the vanquished were enslaved. Notwithstanding his=
 frank genial nature,=20

the Arab was of a dangerously quick temper, derived, he boasted, from the f=
lesh he lived on of the=20

camel, the surliest and most ill-conditioned of beasts. If he              =

Thy glorious name alone we laud,--       Our springs, O Lord, are all in th=
