   or "growth."    420=20

Why not give at once its theological meaning, as we find it in       Webste=
r? With the Roman=20

Catholics it means simply "purgatory," the       borderland between heaven =
and hell (_Limbus=20

patrum_ and _Limbus       infantum_), the one for all men, whether good, ba=
d or indifferent;       the=20

other for the souls of unbaptized children! With the ancients it       mean=

_Esoteric Buddhism_ is called the Kama       Loka, between Devachan and Avi=
tchi.    421 As=20

Chaos, the eternal Element, not as the Kama Loka surely.    422 A proof tha=
t by this word Eliphas=20

Levi means the lowest region of       the terrestrial Akasha.    423 Eviden=
tly he is concerned only=20

with our periodical world, or the       terrestrial globe.    424 In the "r=
eaewakening" of the Forces=20

would be more correct.    425 An action which is incessant in eternity cann=
ot be called=20

Hindu Vedantin; it is the Sat and the       one Beingness of Parmenides, or=
 the Being identical with=20

Thought.       Now how can the Potencies be said to "create movement," once=
 it is       seen=20

movement never had any beginning, but existed in the Eternity?       Why no=
t say that the=20

reawakened Potencies transferred motion from       the eternal to the tempo=
ral plane of being?=20

Surely this is not       Creation.    426 _Histoire de la Magie._ Int., p. =

 God and the=20

fashioner of the Universe, claim that Brahma sprang from the navel       of=
 Vishnu, the=20

"imperishable," or rather from the lotus that grew       from it. But the "=
navel" here means the=20

everyone knows. The       translation of the Protestant _Bible_ is not a wo=
rd for word       rendering=20

of the earlier Greek and Latin _Bibles_: the sense is very       often disf=
igured, and "God" is put=20

where "Jahve" and "Elohim" stand.    431 _Psalms_, civ. 2, 3.    432 To avo=
id misunderstanding of=20

the word "creation" so often used by       us, the remarks of the author of=
 _Through the Gates of=20

Gold_ may be       quoted owing to their clearness and simplicity. "The wor=
ds 'to       create' are=20

often understood by the ordinary mind to convey the idea       of evolving =
something out of nothing.=20

This is clearly not its       meaning. We are mentally obliged to provide o=
ur Creator with chaos=20

from which to produce the worlds. The tiller of the soil, who is the       =
typical producer of social life,=20

must have his material: his earth,       his sky, rain and sun, and the see=
ds to place within the=20

earth. Out       of nothing he can produce nothing. Out of a void nature ca=
nnot       arise; there is=20

our desire for a=20

where the image is often       and I am doing so. Have you seen the king?" =
 "Yes, and all goes=20

well."  "We are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven."  It was then s=
triking half-past ten by St.=20

Paul's.  Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos entered.  "All's=
 well," he cried, as he=20

entered; "I have hired a cedar wherry, as light as a canoe, as easy on the =
wing as any swallow. It=20

is waiting for us at Greenwich, opposite the Isle of Dogs, manned by a capt=
ain and four men, who=20

for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our dispositio=

Once on board we drop down the Thames and in two hours are on the open sea.=
 In case I am=20

killed, the captain's name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning. =
A handkerchief, tied at the=20

four corners, is to be the signal."  Next moment D'Artagnan entered.  "Empt=
y your pockets," said=20

he; "I want a hundred pounds, and as for my own----" and he emptied them in=
side out.  The sum=20

was collected in a minute. D'Artagnan ran out and returned directly after. =
 "There," said he, "it's=20

done. Ough! and not without a deal of trouble, too."  "Has the executioner =
left London?" asked=20

Athos.  "Ah, you see that plan was not sure enough; he might go out by one =
gate and return by=20

another."  "Where is he, then?"  "In the cellar."  "The cellar--what cellar=
?"  "Our landlord's, to be=20

sure. Mousqueton is propped against the door and here's the key."  "Bravo!"=
 said Aramis, "how did=20

you manage it?"  "Like everything else, with money; but it cost me dear."  =
"How much?" asked=20

Athos.  "Five hundred pounds."  "And where did you get so much money?" said=
 Athos. "Had you,=20

then, that sum?"  "The queen's famous diamond," answered D'Artagnan, with a=
 sigh.  "Ah, true,"=20

said Aramis. "I recognized it on your finger."  "You bought it back, then, =
from Monsieur des=20

Essarts?" asked Porthos.  "Yes, but it was fated that I should not keep it.=
"  "So, then, we are all=20

right as regards the executioner," said Athos; "but unfortunately every exe=
cutioner has his=20

assistant, his man, or whatever you call him."  "And this one had his," sai=
d D'Artagnan; "but, as=20



good luck would have it, just as I thought I should have two affairs to man=
age, our friend was=20

brought home with a broken leg. In the excess of his zeal he had accompanie=
d the cart containing=20

the scaffolding as far as the king's window, and one of the crossbeams fell=
 on his leg and broke it."=20

"Ah!" cried Aramis, "that accounts for the cry I heard."  "Probably," said =
D'Artagnan, "but as he is a=20

thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place t=
o help those already=20

at the scaffold, and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom Low=
e, an assistant=20

carpenter and friend of his, to go down to Whitehall, with three of his fri=
ends. Here's the letter he=20

sent by a messenger, for sixpence, who sold it to me for a guinea."  "And w=
hat on earth are you=20

going to do with it?" asked Athos.  "Can't you guess, my dear Athos? You, w=
ho speak English like=20

John Bull himself, are Master Tom Lowe, we, your three companions. Do you u=
nderstand it now?"=20

Athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration, ran to a closet and drew forth w=
orkmen's clothes, which=20

the four friends immediately put on; they then left the hotel, Athos carryi=
ng a saw, Porthos a vise,=20

Aramis an axe and D'Artagnan a hammer and some nails.  The letter from the =
executioner's=20

assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expecte=
d.     65. The=20

Workmen.   Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window. =
It arose from blows=20

of hammer and hatchet, clinking of pincers and cranching of saws.  Lying dr=
essed upon his bed,=20

the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart. He c=
ould not endure it, and=20

sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and=
 not disturb the last=20

slumber of one who had been their king. The sentinel was unwilling to leave=
 his post, but allowed=20

Parry to pass.  Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold, =
over which they were=20

nailing a covering of black serge. Raised to the height of twenty feet, so =
as to be on a level with=20

the window, it had two lower stories. Parry, odious as was this sight to hi=
m, sought for those=20

among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise; and fixed o=
n two men, who=20

were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony.  "My friends," said Parr=
y, mounting the scaffold=20

and standing beside them, "would you work a little more quietly? The king w=
ishes to get a sleep."=20

One of the two, who was standing up, was of gigantic size and was driving a=
 pick with all his might=20

into the wall, whilst the other, kneeling beside him, was collecting the pi=
eces of stone. The face of=20

the first was lost to Parry in the darkness; but as the second turned aroun=
d and placed his finger=20

on his lips Parry started back in amazement.  "Very well, very well," said =
the workman aloud, in=20

excellent English. "Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he will =
sleep better to-morrow=20

night."  These blunt words, so terrible if taken literally, were received b=
y the other workmen with a=20

roar of laughter. But Parry withdrew, thinking he was dreaming.  Charles wa=
s impatiently awaiting=20

his return. At the moment he re-entered, the sentinel who guarded the door =
put his head through=20

the opening, curious as to what the king was doing. The king was lying on h=
is bed, resting on his=20

elbow. Parry closed the door and approaching the king, his face radiant wit=
h joy:  "Sire," he said, in=20

a low voice, "do you know who these workmen are who are making so much nois=
e?"  "I? No; how=20

would you have me know?"  Parry bent his head and whispered to the king: "I=
t is the Comte de la=20

Fere and his friends."  "Raising my scaffold!" cried the king, astounded.  =
"Yes, and at the same=20

time making a hole in the wall."  The king clasped his hands and raised his=
 eyes to Heaven; then=20

leaping down from his bed he went to the window, and pulling aside the curt=
ain tried to distinguish=20

the figures outside, but in vain.  Parry was not wrong. It was Athos he had=
 recognized, and=20

Porthos who was boring a hole through the wall.  This hole communicated wit=
h a kind of loft--the=20

d the magic characters=20

on the       walls and in the air of the crypts of Initiation, without ment=
ioning       the tables of stone=20

on which the finger of God wrote the       commandments? Between the writin=
g of one God and=20

other Gods the       difference, if any, lies only in their respective natu=
res; and if       the tree is to=20

be known by its fruits, then preference would have to       be given always=
 to the Pagan Gods. It is=20

the immortal "To be or not       to be." Either all of them are--or at any =
rate, may be--true, or all=20

are surely pious frauds and the result of credulity.    455 _Papyrus Magiqu=

arise even with a perfectly known language       like Sanskrit, the meaning=
 of which is far easier to=20

meaning correctly in their respective       translations, in which one Orie=

460 _Op. cit._, i. 297.    461 Book II., Commentary.    462 Bunsen and Cham=

with "the       very phrases we find in the _New Testament_ in connection w=

exist in India in our day, as well as in China and all the Buddhist       c=

reigned some 1300 years before our era.    469 One may judge how trustworth=

translations of such Egyptian       documents when the sentence is rendered=
 in three different=20

ways by       three Egyptologists. Rouge says: "He found her in a state _to=
 fall       under the power=20

of spirits_," or "with her limbs quite stiff," (?)       another version; a=
nd Chabas translates: "And the=20

Scribe found the       Khou too wicked." Between her being in possession of=
 an evil Khou       and=20

"with her limbs quite stiff," there is a difference.    470 De Mirville, v.=
 247, 248.    471 Some=20

translators would have Lucian speak of the inhabitants of the       city, o=
f the king's room and the=20

ceiling of the one below it. Their plan was to pass through the hole they w=
ere making into this loft=20

and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king's room, so as to=
 form a kind of trap-door.=20

Through this the king was to escape the next night, and, hidden by the blac=
k covering of the=20

scaffold, was to change his dress for that of a workman, slip out with his =
deliverers, pass the=20



sentinels, who would suspect nothing, and so reach the skiff that was waiti=
ng for him at=20

Greenwich.  Day gilded the tops of the houses. The aperture was finished an=
d Athos passed=20

through it, carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black clo=
th, and the tools with=20

which he was to open a communication with the king's room. He had only two =
hours' work to do to=20

open communication with the king and, according to the calculations of the =
four friends, they had=20

the entire day before them, since, the executioner being absent, another mu=
st be sent for to=20

Bristol.  D'Artagnan returned to change his workman's clothes for his chest=
nut-colored suit, and=20

Porthos to put on his red doublet. As for Aramis, he went off to the bishop=
's palace to see if he=20

could possibly pass in with Juxon to the king's presence. All three agreed =
to meet at noon in=20

Whitehall Place to see how things went on.  Before leaving the scaffold Ara=
mis had approached=20

the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make=
 an attempt to gain=20

another interview with the king.  "Adieu, then, and be of good courage," sa=
id Athos. "Report to the=20

king the condition of affairs. Say to him that when he is alone it will hel=
p us if he will knock on the=20

floor, for then I can continue my work in safety. Try, Aramis, to keep near=
 the king. Speak loud,=20

very loud, for they will be listening at the door. If there is a sentinel w=
ithin the apartment, kill him=20

without hesitation. If there are two, let Parry kill one and you the other.=
 If there are three, let=20

yourself be slain, but save the king."  "Be easy," said Aramis; "I will tak=
e two poniards and give=20

one to Parry. Is that all?"  "Yes, go; but urge the king strongly not to st=
and on false generosity.=20

While you are fighting if there is a fight, he must flee. The trap once rep=

being on the trap, dead or alive, they will need at least ten minutes to fi=
nd the hole by which he=20

has escaped. In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the kin=
g will be saved."=20

"Everything shall be done as you say, Athos. Your hand, for perhaps we shal=
l not see each other=20

again."  Athos put his arm around Aramis's neck and embraced him.  "For you=
," he said. "Now if I=20

die, say to D'Artagnan that I love him as a son, and embrace him for me. Em=
brace also our good=20

and brave Porthos. Adieu."  "Adieu," said Aramis. "I am as sure now that th=
e king will be saved as=20

I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world."  Aramis parted fr=
om Athos, went down=20

from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel, whistling the =
air of a song in praise of=20

Cromwell. He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fir=
e, drinking a bottle of port=20

and devouring a cold chicken. Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentar=
ians; D'Artagnan ate=20

in silence, revolving in his mind the most audacious plans.  Aramis related=
 what had been agreed=20

upon. D'Artagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his =
voice.  "Bravo!" he=20

said; "besides, we shall be there at the time of the flight. What with D'Ar=
tagnan, Grimaud and=20

Mousqueton, we can manage to dispatch eight of them. I say nothing about Bl=
aisois, for he is only=20

472 De Mirville, v. 256, 257.    473 How can de Mirville see Satan in the E=
gyptian God of the great=20

divine Name, when he himself admits that nothing was greater than       the=
 name of the oracle of=20

Dodona, as it was that of the God of the       Jews, IAO, or Jehovah? That =
oracle had been brought=20

by the       Pelasgians to Dodona more than fourteen centuries B.C. and lef=
t with       the=20

forefathers of the Hellenes, and its history is well-known and       may be=
 read in Herodotus.=20

Jupiter, who loved the fair nymph of the       ocean, Dodona, had ordered P=
elasgus to carry his cult=20

to Thessaly.       The name of the God of that oracle at the temple of Dodo=
na was Zeus=20

Pelasgicos, the Zeuspater (God the Father), or as De Mirville       explain=
s: "It was the name _par=20

excellence_, the name that the Jews       held as the ineffable, the unpron=
ounceable Name--in=20

short, _Jaoh-       pater_, _i.e._, 'he who was, who is, and who will be,' =
otherwise the       Eternal."=20

And the author admits that Maury is right "in discovering       in the name=
 of the Vaidic Indra the=20

Biblical Jehovah," and does not       even attempt to deny the etymological=
 connection between the=20

two       names--"the _great_ and the _lost_ name with the sun and the thun=
der-       bolts."=20

Strange confessions, and still stranger contradictions.    474 Reuvens' _Le=

 Aramis swallowed a hasty=20

mouthful, gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes.  "Now," said he, =
"I'm off to the bishop's.=20

Take care of the executioner, D'Artagnan."  "All right. Grimaud has relieve=
d Mousqueton and has=20

his foot on the cellar door."  "Well, don't be inactive."  "Inactive, my de=
ar fellow! Ask Porthos. I=20

pass my life upon my legs."  Aramis again presented himself at the bishop's=
. Juxon consented the=20

more readily to take him with him, as he would require an assistant priest =
in case the king should=20

wish to communicate. Dressed as Aramis had been the night before, the bisho=
p got into his=20

carriage, and the former, more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance =
than his deacon's=20

dress, got in by his side. The carriage stopped at the door of the palace. =
 It was about nine o'clock=20

in the morning.  Nothing was changed. The ante-rooms were still full of sol=
diers, the passages still=20

lined by guards. The king was already sanguine, but when he perceived Arami=
s his hope turned to=20

joy. He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aramis. The bishop affected =
to speak in a loud=20

voice, before every one, of their previous interview. The king replied that=
 the words spoken in that=20

interview had borne their fruit, and that he desired another under the same=
 conditions. Juxon=20

turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alon=
e with the king. Every=20

one withdrew. As soon as the door was closed:  "Sire," said Aramis, speakin=
g rapidly, "you are=20

saved; the London=20

 a hereditary caste in=20

days of old. In       those long-departed ages a man became a Brahman throu=
gh personal       merit=20

and Initiation. Gradually, however, despotism crept in, and       the son o=
f a Brahman was created=20

a Brahman by right of protection       first, then by that of heredity. The=
 rights of blood replaced=20

those       of real merit, and thus arose the body of Brahmans, which was s=
oon       changed into a=20

powerful caste.    490 _Des Initiations Anciennes and Modernes._ "The myste=
ries," says=20

Ragon, "were the gift of India." In this he is mistaken, for the       Arya=
n race had brought the=20

mysteries of Initiation from Atlantis.       Nevertheless he is right in sa=
ying that the mysteries=20

preceded all       civilisations, and that by polishing the mind and morals=
 of the       peoples they=20

served as a base for all the laws--civil, political, and       religious.  =

The word "patriarch" is composed of the Greek word "Patria"       ("family,=
" "tribe," or "nation") and=20

"Archos" (a "chief"), the       paternal principle. The Jewish Patriarchs w=
ho were pastors, passed=20

their name to the Christian Patriarchs; yet they were no your majesty's win=
dow--the cry we heard=20

was his--and there is no executioner nearer at hand than Bristol."  "But th=
e Comte de la Fere?"=20

asked the king.  "Two feet below you; take the poker from the fireplace and=
 strike three times on=20

the floor. He will answer you."  The king did so, and the moment after, thr=
ee muffled knocks,=20

answering the given signal, sounded beneath the floor.  "So," said Charles,=
 "he who knocks down=20

there----"  "Is the Comte de la Fere, sire," said Aramis. "He is preparing =
a way for your majesty to=20

escape. Parry, for his part, will raise this slab of marble and a passage w=
ill be opened."  "Oh,=20

Juxon," said the king, seizing the bishop's two hands in his own, "promise =
that you will pray all=20

your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your f=
eet, and for two others=20

also, who, wherever they may be, are on the watch for my safety."  "Sire," =
replied Juxon, "you=20

shall be obeyed."  Meanwhile, the miner underneath was heard working away i=
ncessantly, when=20

suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage. Aramis seized the po=
ker and gave the=20

signal to stop; the noise came nearer and nearer. It was that of a number o=
f men steadily=20

approaching. The four men stood motionless. All eyes were fixed on the door=
, which opened=20

slowly and with a kind of solemnity.  A parliamentary officer, clothed in b=
lack and with a gravity that=20

augured ill, entered, bowed to the king, and unfolding a parchment, read th=
e sentence, as is=20

usually done to criminals before their execution.  "What is this?" said Ara=
mis to Juxon.  Juxon=20

replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it. =

here that the resurrection of a really       dead body is an impossibility =
in Nature.    496 The kings of=20

Hungary claimed that they could cure the jaundice; the       Dukes of Burgu=
ndy were credited with=20

preserving people from the       plague; the kings of Spain delivered those=
 possessed by the devil.=20

The prerogative of curing the king's evil was given to the kings of       F=
rance, in reward for the=20

virtues of good King Robert. Francis the       First, during a short stay a=
t Marseilles for his  "Was=20

as disappeared, your=20

majesty, but a man has offered his services instead. The execution will the=
refore only be delayed=20

long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs."  A sli=
ght moisture on his brow=20

was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced, as he learned these tid=
ings. But Aramis was=20

livid. His heart ceased beating, he closed his eyes and leaned upon the tab=
le. Charles perceived it=20

and took his hand.=20

touched and cured of that disease upwards of 500 persons. The kings       o=
f England had the=20

same privilege.    497 See Laurens' _Essais Historiques_ for further inform=
ation as to the=20

world-wide, universal knowledge of the Egyptian Priests.    498 _Des Initia=

word comes from the Greek "hieros" ("sacred") and "glupho" ("I       grave"=
). The Egyptian=20

characters were sacred to the Gods, as the       Indian Devanagari is the l=
anguage of the Gods.=20

secondly, to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time. W=

me?"  "Certainly," replied the officer, and left the room.  Aramis dug his =
nails into his flesh and=20

groaned aloud.  "Oh! my lord bishop," he cried, seizing Juxon's hands, "whe=
re is Providence?=20

believe me,=20
