dracaena marginata will pass. The real thing we found was an awakening peop=
le, coming into the new century eager and wise and sure that it held somewh=
ere in its coming years the dawn of a new day. That really is the hope of t=
he war--an industrial hope, not a political hope, not a geographical hope, =
but a hope for better things for the common man. It is a hope that Christia=
nity may take Christendom, and that the fellowship among the nations of the=
 world so learned nothing, absolutely nothing, of the existence of a lake. =
This statement perfectly accords with what I heard myself thirty-five years=
 later at Esmeralda. The probability of a fact is powerfully shaken when it=
 can be proved to be totally unknown on the very spot where it ought to be =
known best; and when those by whom the existence of the lake is affirmed co=
ntradict each other, not in the least essential circumstances, but in all t=
hat dracaena marginata will pass. The real thing we found was an awakening =

ll that _
were bigger, huskier men than the men in the south of Italy, and that they =
looked better-kept and=20

better-bred. They certainly are a fierce and indomitable people. The Austri=
ans don't raid the=20

Milanese in airships. They said that once the Austrians came and the next d=
ay the Milanese=20

loaded up a fleet of big Capronis with 30,000 pounds of high explosives, sa=
iled over Austria and=20

blew some town to atoms. So Milan has never been bothered since as other bo=
rder towns of Italy=20

have been bothered by air-raiders. The days we spent in Milan were like day=
s in a modern=20

American industrial city--say Toledo, or St. Paul or Detroit or Kansas City=
.  Turin is similarly=20

modern and industrial, though not so beautiful as Milan. In Turin we saw th=
e scene of the riot--the=20

"grosser rebellion," which our carabinieri friend told us about. Signor Nit=
ti, now a member of the=20

Italian cabinet, who entertained us in Rome, told the Italian parliament--a=
ccording to the American=20

newspapers--that the millers caused the riot. The bread ration did not come=
 to Turin one morning,=20

and the working people struck. Nitti says the millers were hoarding flour a=
nd caused the delay.=20

The strike grew general over the city. Workers wandering about the town wer=
e threatened with the=20

police if they congregated. They congregated, and some troops from a nearby=
 training camp were=20

called. The troops were new; they were also friends of the strikers. They r=
efused to fire. Then the=20

strikers built barricades in the streets and in a day or so the regular tro=
ops came down from the=20

mountains with machine guns, fired on the barricades and when hundreds were=
 hit the rebellion=20

was quelled. And Signor Nitti says it was all because some profit hog stopp=
ed the ordinary flow of=20

flour from the farmer to the consumer of bread! There is, of course, the ot=
her side. They told us in=20

Turin that boys in their teens were found Erevato and the Padamo. They woul=
d have resisted the=20

attacks of the natives, if, instead of leaving them isolated and solely to =
the control of the soldiery,=20

they had been formed into communities, and governed like the villages of ne=
ophyte Indians.  We=20

left the mission of Esmeralda on the 23rd of May. Without being positively =
ill, we felt ourselves in a=20

state of languor and weakness, caused by the torment of insects, bad food, =
and a long voyage, in=20

narrow and damp boats. We did not go up the Orinoco beyond the mouth of the=
 Rio Guapo, which=20

we should have done, if we could have attempted to reach the sources of the=
 river. There remains=20

a distance of fifteen leagues from the Guapo to the Raudal of the Guaharibo=
s. At this cataract,=20

which is passed on a bridge of lianas, Indians are posted armed with bows a=
nd arrows to prevent=20

the whites, or those who come from their territory from advancing westward.=
 How could we hope=20

to pass a point where the commander of the Rio Negro, Don Francisco Bovadil=
la, was stopped=20

when, accompanied by his soldiers, he tried to penetrate beyond the Gehette=
?* (* See above.)=20

The carnage then made among the natives has rendered them more distrustful,=
 and more averse=20

to the inhabitants of the missions. It must be remembered that the Orinoco =
had hitherto offered to=20

geographers two distinct problems, alike important, the situation of its so=
urces, and the mode of its=20

communication with the Amazon. The latter problem formed the object of the =
journey which I have=20

described; with respect to the discovery of its sources, that remains to be=
 done by the Spanish and=20

Portuguese governments.  Our canoe was not ready to receive us till near th=
ree o'clock in the=20

afternoon. It had been filled with innumerable swarms of ants during the na=
vigation of the=20

Cassiquiare; and the toldo, or roof of palm-leaves, beneath which we were a=
gain doomed to=20

remain=20


_
back of the barricades with thousand lire notes in their pockets, and that =
German agents came=20

during the first hours of the strike and spread money lavishly to make the =
riot a rebellion. Probably=20

this is true. The profiteer made the strike possible. It was an opportunity=
 for rebellion, and=20

Germany took the opportunity. Always she is on hand with spies to buy what =
she cannot honestly=20

win. Reluctantly we turned our faces from Italy to France. Yet the journey =
had been well worth=20

while. We came home with a definite and hopeful impression about Italy. The=
 Turin riot, bad as it=20

was, was not an anti-war riot. It was directed at the bad administration of=
 the food controller. Italy=20

then was not an invaded country, as France was, and had no such enthusiasm =
for the war, as a=20

nation has when its soil is invaded. Italy has that enthusiasm now for the =
war. We saw that her=20

man-power was hardly tapped. She has millions to pour into the trenches. Sh=
e needs and out=20

during twenty-two days, was with difficulty cleared of these insects. We em=
ployed part of the=20

morning in repeating to the inhabitants of Esmeralda the questions we had a=
lready put to them,=20

respecting the existence of a lake towards the east. We showed copies of th=
e maps of Surville and=20

La Cruz to old soldiers, who had been posted in the mission ever since its =
first establishment.=20

They laughed at the supposed communication of the Orinoco with the Rio Idap=
a, and at the White=20

Sea, which the former river was represented to cross. What we politely call=
 geographical fictions=20

they termed lies of the old world (mentiras de por alla). These good people=
 could not comprehend=20

how men, in making the map of a country which they had never visited, could=
 pretend to know=20

things in minute detail, of which persons who lived on the spot were ignora=
nt. The lake Parima, the=20

Sierra Mey, and the springs which separate at the point where they issue fr=
om the earth,=20


_
of the war, iron and coal. She will have to borrow her guns and her fuel. B=
ut she has almost=20

enough food. We found sugar scarce; butter scarce, and bread sharply allowa=
nced in hotels and=20

restaurants. We found two meatless days a week besides Friday and found the=
 people, as a rule,=20

observing them. We found the industries of the nation turned solely toward =
the war. Italy realizes=20

what defeat means. The pro-Austrian party which was strong at the beginning=
 of the war has=20

vanished, and since the invasion, even the Pope has lost his interest in pe=
ace!  But all these=20

things repeatedly assured that no one had ever been to the east of the Raud=
al of the Guaharibos;=20

and that beyond that point, according to the opinion of some of the natives=
, the Orinoco descends=20

like a small torrent from a group of mountains, inhabited by the Coroto Ind=
ians. Father Gili, who=20

was living on the banks of the Orinoco when the expedition of the boundarie=
s arrived, says=20

expressly that Don Apollinario Diez was sent in 1765 to attempt the discove=
ry of the source of the=20

Orinoco; that he found the river, east of Esmeralda, full of shoals; that h=
e returned for want of=20
