 be a good idea," agreed Mr. Damon.  Tom, Mr. Damon and Koku, bidding farew=

s and his brother coming to see them off.  "Give us an option on all that e=
xplosive you make, Tom Swift!" begged Walter Titus. "We were so successful =
with this tunnel, thanks to you, troops he could muster 3000 men.  These ad=

in Peru, went aboard the steamer, Job Titus and his brother coming to see t=
hem off.  "Give us an option on all that explosive you make, Tom Swift!" be=
gged Walter Titus. "We were so successful with this tunnel, thanks to you, =

grin, that all his officers voted for retreat.  "In vain," he reported to t=
he King, _
seeking to prevent the completion of the tunnel. But he had not been succes=
sful.  Waddington it=20

was who had thrown the bomb, though he declared he only hoped to disable To=
m and Mr. Titus,=20

and not to injure them. He was fighting for delay. And it was Waddington, w=
orking in conjunction=20

with the rascally foreman Serato, who had induced the tunnel workers to des=
ert so mysteriously,=20

hoping to scare the other Indians away. He nearly succeeded too, had it not=
 been for the gratitude=20

of the woman whose baby Tom had saved from the condor.  Waddington had been=
 an actor=20

before he became involved with the rival contractors. He was smooth shaven =
when first he went to=20

Shopton, to spy on Mr. Titus, whose movements he had been commanded to foll=
ow by Blakeson=20

& Grinder. Then he disappeared after Mr. Titus chased him, only to reappear=
, in from kilted=20

Highlander and English red-coat poured one tremendous sheet of flame.  The =
French staggered,=20

but still came on.  Another fatal volley met them, inflicting awful slaught=
er.  As they wavered, Wolfe=20

flourished his sword, and amidst the weird uproar of the bagpipes, the shri=
eks and groans of the=20

wounded, the war-whoops of the Indians, the mad shouting of the English, an=
d fierce slogan of the=20

Highlanders, Wolfe pushed on over dead and dying, behind a moving wall of b=
ayonets.  A bullet=20

shattered his wrist, another pierced his body, but he kept on; a third lodg=
ed in his breast, and=20

Wolfe fell upon the ground.  Two or three stalwart grenadiers bore their be=
loved general quickly to=20

the rear.  "There is no need for a surgeon," he said; "it is all over with =
me!"  {219}  One of the=20

grenadiers looked up and cried out, "They=20


_
Waddington, meanwhile, had grown a beard and this, with his knowledge of th=
eatrical makeup,=20

enabled him to deceive even Mr. Titus. Of course it was comparatively easy =
to deceive Tom, who=20

had not known him. Waddington had really been ill when he called for help o=
n the ship, and he=20

had not noticed that it was Tom and Mr. Titus who came into his stateroom t=
o his aid. When he did=20

recognize them, he relied on his disguise to screen him from recognition, a=
nd he was successful.=20

He had only pretended to be ill, though, the time he slipped out and threw =
the bomb.  Reaching=20

Peru he at once began his plotting. Serato told him about the secret shaft =
leading into the tunnel,=20

and with the knotted rope, and with the aid of the faithless foreman, the m=
en were got out of the=20

tunnel and paid to hide away.  Waddington was planning further disappearanc=
es when Tom saw=20

him, but thought it a dream.  Masni, the Indian woman, out herb-hunting one=
 day, had seen=20

Waddington, 'the bearded man' as he then was--working the secret stone. Hid=
den, she observed=20

him and told her husband, who was afraid to reveal what he knew. But when T=
om saved the baby=20

the woman rewarded him in the only way possible. And it was Serato, who, at=
 Waddington's=20

suggestion, caused the "hit" among the men by working on their superstitiou=
s fears.  Waddington,=20

knowing that he was dying, confessed everything, and begged forgiveness fro=
m Tom and his=20

friends, which was granted, in as much as no real harm had been done.  Wadd=
ington was but a=20

tool in the hands of the rival contractors, who deserted him in they run!" =
 The dying Wolfe opened=20

his eyes and murmured, "Who run?"  "The enemy, sir; they give way everywher=
e."  The general=20

roused himself by a superhuman effort.  "Go, one of you, to Colonel Burton,=
" he said in quick=20

terms of command.  "Tell him to march Webb's regiment down to Charles River=
 to cut off their=20

retreat from the bridge."  Then, turning on his side, he whispered faintly,=
 "Now, God be praised, I=20

die in peace."  In a few moments the gallant Wolfe was no more.  How fared =
it meanwhile with his=20

brave enemy, Montcalm?  As he galloped about on horseback the tide of Frenc=
h fugitives pressed=20

him back towards the gates of Quebec.  He was nearing the walls when a shot=
 passed through his=20

body.  Mortally wounded though he was, he kept himself seated in the saddle=
, two soldiers=20

supporting him on either side.  As his life-blood streamed from Montcalm's =
body down his horse's=20

limbs, the frightened crowd of women within the gates exclaimed in grief an=
d terror, "The Marquis=20

is killed! the Marquis is killed!"  "It is nothing, it is nothing," replied=
 the dying Montcalm: "do not be=20

troubled for me, my good friends."  When, some hours later, his spirit had =
breathed his last,=20

Montcalm was buried under the floor of the Ursuline Convent.  No workman co=
uld be found during=20

the panic to make a coffin, and so an {220} old servant gathered a few boar=
ds and nailed them=20

together into a rough box.  No bell tolled, no cannon fired a salute as Mon=
tcalm was laid to eternal=20

rest.  Not thus was the funeral of the victorious Wolfe.  His body was emba=
lmed and borne=20


_
hours, however, were made as comfortable as possible by the generosity of T=
om and Mr. Damon.=20

No effort was made to bring Blakeson & Grinder to justice, as there was no =
evidence against them=20

after Waddington died.  And, as the tunnel was finished, the Titus brothers=
 had no further cause=20

for worry.  "But if it had not been for Tom's big blast, and the discovery =
of the hidden city of Pelone=20

just in the right place, we might be digging at that tunnel yet," said Job =
Titus.  The day before the=20

steamer was to sail, Tom Swift received a cable message. Its receipt seemed=
 to fill him with=20

delight, so that Mr. Damon asked:  "Is it from your father, Tom?"  "No it's=
 from Mary Nestor. She=20

says her father has forgiven me. They have been away, and Mary has been ill=
, which accounts for=20

no letters up to now. But everything is all right now, and they feel that t=
he dynamite trick wasn't my=20

fault. But, all the same, most powerful gathered to do him honour and rever=
ence at his funeral in=20

Westminster Abbey.  Yet history has struck the balance.  To-day in Quebec, =
marking the scene of=20

the death-struggle on that fateful September day, a single shaft of stone r=
ises to heaven to=20

commemorate at the same time a victory and a defeat.  On the one side is gr=
aven the single word=20

"MONTCALM" and on the other "WOLFE."     {221}  CHAPTER XV  LVIS AND THE NO=
BLES=20

Vaudreuil, now quartered on the Beauport Road, called a council of war.  Tu=

confusion reigned.  Montcalm, seeing the sands of his life fast running out=
, despatched a brief=20

reply.  "You have a threefold choice," he said: "to fight the English again=
, to retreat to Jacques=20

Cartier, or to surrender the colony."  Over which choice to make, Vaudreuil=
 hesitated.  With=20
