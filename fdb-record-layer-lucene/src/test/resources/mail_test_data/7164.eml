"Hickville, eh? That's about a hundred miles from Denton. Well, I was going=
 to say that I'll write=20

you a few days before we start, and you can come on to Denton."  "All right=
. I'll do it."  "Then I'll go=20

and finish packing. I left Nat Anderson to do it, and he's just as likely t=
o put things upside down as=20

right side up. I'll see you at Denton, then."  "Yes," replied Will. But Jac=
k did not see the new boy at=20

Denton, and not until some time after their parting at the school; and when=
 he did see him, it was=20

under strange circumstances.  Good-bys were said among the pupils and teach=
ers of Washington=20

Hall, and Jack and his chums separated, he and Nat journeying to Denton, wh=
ich they reached=20

that night, much to the surprise of Mr. Ranger, Jack's three aunts, and Nat=
's folks.  Jack lost no=20

time in beginning his preparations for the camping trip, his father consent=
ing that the gun club=20

might be formed. Our hero wrote many letters, arranged for transportation t=
o the West, got into=20

communication with a guide near Cody, Wyoming, and invited Budge to go alon=
g.  "Sure I'll go,"=20

said the gum-chewing lad as he placed into his mouth a fresh wad of the sti=
cky substance.=20

"When'll it be?"  "In about two weeks," said Jack. "There are quite a few t=
hings to do yet."  In the=20

meanwhile, Nat Anderson, Sam Chalmers and Bony Balmore had secured permissi=
on from their=20

parents to go with Jack, and they were busy at their respective homes, maki=
ng up their kits. Sam=20

and Bony lived about a day's journey from Denton.  "Now I'll write to Bill,=
 and invite him to come=20

on," said Jack one night, and then he waited for a reply from the lad with =
whom he had so recently=20

become friends.  "Here's Bill's answer," said Jack to Nat one afternoon a f=
ew days later, when they=20

went down to the post-office, and Jack received a letter marked "Hickville.=
"  As Jack read it he=20

uttered a low whistle.  "What's the matter? Can't he come?" asked Nat.  "No=
. This is from his=20

rascally guardian. It's to me. Bill's run away."     CHAPTER XIII  OFF ON T=
HE TRIP   Nat stood=20

still in the street and stared at Jack.  "What's that you said?" he asked. =
 "Bill's run away. Listen and=20

I'll read the letter to you. It says: 'A few days ago my ward, William Will=
iams, returned from=20

Washington Hall, greatly to my regret. He explained the cause of his enforc=
ed vacation, and stated=20

that you had asked him to go off on a hunting trip. Of course, I refused to=
 let him go. In the first=20

place I don't believe in hunting, and for a lad of William's age to go off =
to the West, where he may=20

learn bad habits, is not the thing. Besides, I cannot trust him away from t=
he authority of older=20

persons.'"  "Wouldn't that jolt you?" commented Jack as he looked up from t=
he letter.  Nat nodded.=20

"Suffering snufflebugs!" he exclaimed. "That's the limit--isn't it, Jack?" =
 "Pretty near. Listen; there's=20

more to it: 'When I told my ward that he could not go, he answered me very =
sharply that if his=20

uncle was here he could get permission. That may be, but his uncle is not h=
ere. He begged to be=20

allowed to go, but I was firm in my refusal. I do not believe in such nonse=
nse as camping out, and I=20

told William so.  "'The other day, to my surprise, he disappeared from my h=
ome, and I have not=20

been able to get a trace of him. I am forced to come to the conclusion that=
 he has run away in a fit=20

of anger, because I would not let him go camping with you. I hold you partl=
y to blame for this, as it=20

was wrong of you to ask him to go. I must therefore ask you, in case you se=
e him, to at once=20

compel him to return to me. I absolutely forbid him to go camping with you,=
 and should he join you,=20

you must send him back. He has defied me, and must be punished. If you see =
him, turn him over=20

to the nearest police officer, inform me, and I will come and get him.'"  "=
Well, wouldn't that loosen=20

your liver pin!" exclaimed Nat. "Do you s'pose he's coming here, Jack?"  "I=
 don't know. I'm glad he=20

ran away from such a mean man as Mr. Gabel, though. The idea of not letting=
 him go camping! It's=20

a shame!"  "Will you make him go back if he does come?"  "Will I? Not much!=
 I'll take him=20



camping."  "That's the stuff!" cried Nat. "Gollywoggled gimlet giblets! but=
 some persons can be=20

mean when they try real hard! I wonder if he will come here?"  "It's hard t=
o say," replied Jack. "He=20

showed spunk, though, in running away, and I guess he couldn't have taken a=
ny money with him,=20

either, for his guardian never let him have any. Well, if he comes I'll loo=
k out for him, and I'll not=20

hand him over to a policeman, either."  "Say," called a voice from the othe=
r side of the street.=20

"Bettergome, Jack."  "Better go home--what relations. Injuries to our neigh=
bor are then=20

_classified_ by the moral law. They are divided into offences against life,=
 chastity, property, and=20

character; and I notice that the greatest offence in each class is expressl=
y forbidden. Thus the=20

greatest injury to life is murder; to chastity, adultery; to property, thef=
t; to character, perjury. Now=20

the greatest offence must include the least of the same kind. Murder must i=
nclude every injury to=20

life; adultery every injury to purity; and so of the rest. And the moral co=
de is closed and perfected=20

by a command forbidding every improper _desire_ in regard to our neighbors.=
  I have been=20

thinking, Where did Moses get that law? I have read history. The Egyptians =
and the adjacent=20

nations were idolaters; so were the Greeks and Romans; and the wisest or be=
st Greeks or=20

Romans never gave a code of morals like this. Where did Moses obtain that l=
aw, which surpasses=20

the wisdom and philosophy of the most enlightened ages? He lived at a perio=
d comparatively=20

barbarous; but he has given a law in which the learning and sagacity of all=
 subsequent time can=20

detect no flaw. Where did he obtain it? He could not have soared so far abo=
ve his age as to have=20

devised it himself. I am satisfied where he obtained it. It came down from =
heaven. It has convinced=20

me of the truth of the religion of the Bible."  The infidel, (now an infide=
l no longer), remained to his=20

death a firm believer in the truth of Christianity.  We call it the "Mosaic=
" Law, but it has been well=20

said that the commandments did not originate with Moses, nor were they done=
 away with when=20

the Mosaic Law was fulfilled in Christ, and many of its ceremonies and regu=
lations abolished. We=20

can find no trace of the existence of any lawmaking body in those early tim=
es, no parliament or=20

congress that built up a system of laws. It has come down to us complete an=
d finished, and the=20

only satisfactory account is that which tells us that God Himself wrote the=
 commandments on=20

tables of stone.  BINDING TO-DAY.  Some people seem to think we have got be=
yond the=20

commandments. What did Christ say? "Think not that I am come to destroy the=
 law and the=20

prophets; I am not come to destroy but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you=
, Till heaven and earth=20

pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till a=
ll be fulfilled." The=20

commandments of God given to Moses in the Mount at Horeb are as binding to-=
day as ever they=20

have been since the time when they were proclaimed in the hearing of the pe=
ople. The Jews said=20

the law was not given in Palestine, (which belonged to Israel), but in the =
wilderness, because the=20

law was for all nations.  Jesus never condemned the law and the prophets, b=
ut He did condemn=20

those who did not obey them. Because He gave new commandments it does not f=
ollow that He=20

abolished the old. Christ's explanation of them made them all the more sear=
ching. In His Sermon=20

on the Mount He carried the principles of the commandments beyond the mere =
letter. He unfolded=20

them and showed that they embraced more, that they are positive as well as =
prohibitive. The Old=20

Testament closes with these words: "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant=
, which I=20

commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments=
. Behold, I will send=20

you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of t=
he Lord: and he shall=20

turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the childre=
n to their fathers, lest I=20



come and smite the earth with a curse."  Does that look as if the law of Mo=
ses was becoming=20

obsolete?  The conviction deepens in me with the years that the old truths =
of the Bible must be=20

stated and restated in the plainest possible language. I do not remember ev=
er to have heard a=20

sermon preached on the commandments. I have an index of two thousand five h=
undred sermons=20

preached by Spurgeon, and not one of them selects its text from the first s=
eventeen verses of=20

Exodus xx. The people must be made to understand that the Ten Commandments =
are still=20

binding, and that there is a penalty attached to their violation. We do not=
 want a gospel of mere=20

sentiment. The Sermon on the Mount did not blot out the Ten Commandments.  =
When Christ=20

came He condensed the statement of the law into this form: "Thou shalt love=
 the Lord thy God with=20

all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all =
thy mind; and thy neighbor=20

as thyself." Paul said: "Love is the fulfilling of the law." But does this =
mean that the detailed=20

precepts of the Decalogue are superseded, and have become back numbers? Doe=
s a father=20

cease to give children rules to obey because they=20


_
gum-loving lad coming toward him.  "Some of your camping stuff arrived, and=
 your aunts don't=20

know where to put it. It's all over the parlor floor," explained Budge, tak=
ing his gum out of his=20

mouth in order to speak more plainly.  "I hope it's my new gun!" exclaimed =
Jack. "Come on, Nat,=20

let's hurry. Did they send you after me, Budge?" for the assistant janitor =
used to do chores for=20

Jack's aunts, and was constantly around the house.  "'Swat," replied Budge,=
 that being his gum=20

version of "That's what."  Jack and Nat hurried to the former's house. They=
 found several=20

packages strewn about the parlor, while Jack's three maiden aunts were sitt=
ing in chairs, staring=20

helplessly at the books because the people have become patriotic? Not at al=
l. And yet people=20

speak as if the Commandments do not hold for Christians because they have c=
ome to love God.=20

Paul said: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid. Yea, we=
 establish the law." It=20

still holds good. The commandments are necessary. So long as we obey, they =
do not rest heavy=20

upon us; but as soon as we try to break away, we find they are like fences =
to keep us within=20

bounds. Horses need bridles even after they have been properly broken in.  =
"We know that the law=20

is good if a man use it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made fo=
r a righteous man, but for=20

the lawless and disobedient, for the=20


_
"Oh, Jack!" exclaimed Aunt Angelina. "Whatever is in all those packages? Th=
e man who brought=20

them told us to be careful, as one was marked firearms."  "That's all right=
," said Jack easily. "It's=20

only some guns and cartridges I expect, Aunt Angelina."  "But--but suppose =
it should for=20

murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremon=
gers, for them that=20

defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured pe=
rsons, and if there be any=20

other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine."  Now, my friend, are you r=
eady=20
