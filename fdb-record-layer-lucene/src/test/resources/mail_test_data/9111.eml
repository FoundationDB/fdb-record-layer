Camellia Buds had proclaimed themselves as "Fairy Godmothers, Limited," had=
 adopted juniors=20

with much flourish of trumpets, had certainly fought a crusade and defended=
 them against injustice=20

and infringement of their rights, and then--and then--alack!--in the excite=
ment of other matters had=20

almost forgotten all about them.  Peachy remembered clearly that for the fi=
rst week of her=20

championship she had made a point of speaking daily to Olive, Doris, and Na=
talie. Now, for a full=20

fortnight she had scarcely nodded to them at the breakfast table. They had =
certainly had no=20

opportunity of pouring their childish woes into the sympathetic and motherl=
y ear which she had=20

quite intended should be always open to them.  "I've a wretched memory," sh=
e ruminated=20

remorsefully. "Poor kiddies. They've really got rather a grievance, though =
they needn't have been=20

so cheeky--the young imps! I guess I'd better call a meeting of the Camelli=
a Buds and see what's=20

to be done. I don't believe any of us have taken any notice of them just la=
tely."  Nine would-have-

been philanthropists, reminded of past schemes of benevolence, blushed unea=
sily, and tried to=20

revive interest in their protegees.  "They always seemed very busy with bas=
ket-ball and other=20

things, and not exactly hankering after us," urged Agnes in excuse.  "They =
could have come to us=20

if they'd wanted, of course," added Mary.  "That wasn't entirely the pact,"=
 said Peachy, driving in=20

her tacks with firm hammer. "We offered to 'mother' them, and then forgot a=
ll about them. No=20

wonder they think us frauds. What's to be done about it?"  "Get some more c=
akes somehow and=20

ask them all to a party," suggested Irene enthusiastically. "We have been p=
igs! I promised Desiree=20

to paint something in her album, and the book's been in my drawer for weeks=
, and I've never=20

touched it."  "How are we going to get the cakes?"  "Wheedle Antonio again,=
 I suppose. We=20

needn't have any ourselves. If there are two slices apiece for the kids, it=
 will do. We must keep=20

some of our biscuits from lunch so that we can seem to be eating something =
ourselves. Peachy,=20

you can coax him."  "You always leave it to me. Antonio isn't so easy to ma=
nage. Sometimes he's=20

an absolute Pharisee, and won't buy me so much as a single bit of candy. I'=
ll do what I can. Those=20

poor kids shall have a treat if it costs me my last dollar. We owe them som=
ething decent."=20

Antonio, whose lapses from duty were only occasional, and who had been repr=
imanded lately by=20

Miss Rodgers, who suspected his delinquencies, proved deaf on this occasion=
 to Peachy's=20

blandishments. He protested, with quite aggravating virtue, that it was as =
much as his place was=20

worth to smuggle even a solitary cream-cake, and that for the future he mus=
t no more be the=20

conveyor of contraband sweet stuff.  "Stumped in that quarter," mourned Pea=
chy. "But I'm not=20

going to let this beat me. I've been cultivating a friendship with the cook=
! Don't laugh! I thought it=20

might come in useful some day. I gave her my blue butterfly brooch (I had t=
wo of them!), and I took=20

a snap-shot of her in her Sunday clothes, and she was immensely pleased and=
 flattered. I haven't=20

developed it yet, by the by, but I will, and print her two copies and mount=
 them. If that doesn't melt=20

her heart into sparing me a little butter and sugar it ought to. We can squ=
are it this way: none of us=20

ten must eat any butter or sugar at breakfast or tea to-morrow, then we'll =
have a real right to have=20

it given us afterwards. Don't pull faces! You can have marmalade or jam. Wh=
at sybarites you are!"=20

"Right-o," agreed the Camellia Buds, sorrowfully accepting the sacrifice.  =
"But couldn't the juniors=20

contribute some butter, too?" added Sheila.  "It might be noticed if too ma=
ny went without.=20

Besides, it's the hostesses who ought to provide the party, not the guests.=
"  Benedicta, the cook,=20

was vulnerable, especially in view of the self-restraint exercised by the h=
eroic ten. She made a=20

hasty calculation of the amount of butter they would normally have consumed=
, added a package of=20



sugar, and lent them a pan and a spoon. Peachy carried away these spoils ch=
uckling, and hid=20

them carefully behind the summer-house. Then she racked her brains and comp=
osed what she=20

considered a suitable and telling invitation:            "To all who'd love=
 a Fairy Fete            I beg you=20

come, and don't be late,            We offer fun that will not wait.       =
     "The time is fixed for half-past=20

four,            You'll have to squat upon the floor,            We ask you=
 all--but can't do more.=20

"Our summer-house is small but handy,            Indeed we think the place =
most dandy,=20

We're going to try and make you candy.            "So leave your game of ba=
sket-ball,            And=20

come and make a friendly call,            You'll find a welcome for you all=
.                    "From=20

"Your Fairy Godmothers."  Peachy wrote her effusion upon a sheet torn from =
her best pad, folded=20

it, sought out Olive and handed it to her, telling her to pass it round the=
 form. The juniors grinned=20

at its contents. They had felt themselves neglected, but were quite ready t=
o forgive past omissions=20

on the strength of a present invitation.  "Better late than never," decreed=
 Doris. "I suppose we'll=20

go?"  "It sounds as if it might be rather nice," agreed the others.  So onc=
e more the Camellia Buds=20

were placed in the position of hostesses. Owing to the difficulty of the ca=
tering bringing back those=20

that wander too far from the pastures of the farm, and branding all that do=
 not already bear the=20

mark of their proprietor. These mulattos, who are known by the name of peon=
es llaneros, are=20

partly freed-men and partly slaves. They are constantly exposed to the burn=
ing heat of the tropical=20

sun. Their food is meat, dried in the air, and a little salted; and of this=
 even their horses sometimes=20

partake. Being always in the saddle, they fancy they cannot make the slight=
est excursion on foot.=20

We found an old negro slave, who managed the farm in the absence of his mas=
ter. He told us of=20

herds composed of several thousand cows, that were grazing in the steppes; =
yet we asked in vain=20

for a bowl of milk. We were offered, in a calabash, some yellow, muddy, and=
 fetid water, drawn=20

from a neighbouring pool. The indolence of the inhabitants of the Llanos is=
 such that they do not=20

dig wells, though they know that almost everywhere, at ten feet deep, fine =
springs are found in a=20

stratum of conglomerate, or red sandstone. After suffering during one half =
of the year from the=20

effect of inundations, they quietly resign themselves, during the other hal=
f; to the most distressing=20

deprivation of water. The old negro advised us to cover the cup with a line=
n cloth, and drink as=20

through a filter, that we might not be incommoded by the smell, and might s=
wallow less of the=20

yellowish mud suspended in the water. We did not then think that we should =
afterwards be forced,=20

during whole months, to have recourse to this expedient. The waters of the =
Orinoco are always=20

loaded with earthy particles; they are even putrid, where dead bodies of al=
ligators are found in the=20

creeks, lying on banks of sand, or half-buried in the mud.  No sooner were =
our instruments=20

unloaded and safely placed, than our mules were set at liberty to go, as th=
ey say here, para=20

buscar agua, that is, "to search for water." There are little pools round t=
he farm, which the animals=20

find, guided by their instinct, by the view of some scattered tufts of maur=
itia, and by the sensation=20

of humid coolness, caused by little currents of air amid an atmosphere whic=
h to us appears calm=20

and tranquil. When the pools of water are far distant, and the people of th=
e farm are too lazy to=20

lead the cattle to these natural watering-places, they confine them during =
five or six hours in a very=20

hot stable before they let them loose. Excess of thirst then augments their=
 sagacity, sharpening as=20

it were their senses and their instinct. No sooner is the stable opened, th=
an the horses and mules,=20

especially the latter (for the penetration of these animals exceeds the int=
elligence of the horses),=20

rush into the savannahs. With upraised tails and heads thrown back they run=
 against the wind,=20



stopping from time to time as if exploring space; they follow less the impr=
essions of sight than of=20

smell; and at length announce, by prolonged neighings, that there is water =
in the direction of their=20

course. All these movements are executed more promptly, and with readier su=
ccess, by horses=20

born in the Llanos, and which have long enjoyed their liberty, than by thos=
e that come from the=20

coast, and descend from domestic horses. In animals, for the most part, as =
in man, the quickness=20

of the senses is diminished by long subjection, and by the habits that aris=
e from a fixed abode and=20

the progress of cultivation.  We followed our mules in search of one of tho=
se pools, whence the=20

muddy water had been drawn, that so ill quenched our thirst. We were covere=
d with dust, and=20

tanned by the sandy wind, which burns the skin even more than the rays of t=
he sun. We longed=20

impatiently to take a bath, but we found only a great pool of feculent wate=
r, surrounded with palm-

trees. The water was turbid, though, to our great astonishment, a little co=
oler than the air.=20

Accustomed during our long journey to bathe whenever we had an opportunity,=
 often several times=20

in one day, we hastened to plunge into the pool. We had scarcely begun to e=
njoy the coolness of=20

the bath, when a noise which we heard on the opposite bank, made us leave t=
he water=20

precipitately. It was an alligator plunging into the mud.  We were only at =
the distance of a quarter=20

of a league from the farm, yet we continued walking more than an hour witho=
ut reaching it. We=20

perceived too late that we had taken a wrong direction. Having left it at t=
he decline of day, before=20

the stars were visible, we had gone forward into the plain at hazard. We we=
re, as usual, provided=20

with a compass, and it might have been easy for us to steer our course from=
 the position of=20

Canopus and the Southern Cross; but unfortunately we were uncertain whether=
, on leaving the=20

farm, we had gone towards the east or the south. We attempted to return to =
the spot where we=20

had bathed, and we again walked three quarters of an hour without finding t=
he pool. We=20

sometimes thought we saw fire on the horizon; but it was the light of the r=
ising stars enlarged by=20

the vapours. After having wandered a long time in the savannah, we resolved=
 to seat ourselves=20

beneath the trunk of a palm-tree, in a spot perfectly dry, surrounded by sh=
ort grass; for the fear of=20

water-snakes is always greater than that of jaguars among Europeans recentl=
y disembarked. We=20

could not flatter ourselves that our guides, of whom we knew the insuperabl=
e indolence, would=20

come in search of us in the savannah before they had prepared their food an=
d finished their=20

repast. Whilst somewhat perplexed=20


_
candy before the very eyes of their guests, so that they might see for them=
selves how little there=20

was of it and not grouse if the supply only ran to one bit apiece.  "Otherw=
ise they might think we'd=20

had first go and only given them the leavings," remarked Peachy, who was a =
born diplomat.  They=20

had counted on borrowing the spirit-lamp which the seniors used for brewing=
 their after-dinner=20

coffee, but at the last moment they found the bottle of methylated affected=
 by hearing from afar the=20

sound of a horse advancing towards us. The rider was an Indian, armed with =
a lance, who had just=20

made the rodeo, or round, in order to collect the cattle within a determina=
te space of ground. The=20

sight of two white men, who said they had lost their way, led him at first =
to suspect some trick. We=20

found it difficult to inspire him with confidence; he at last consented to =
guide us to the farm of the=20

Cayman, but without=20


_
"What a nuisance! There's no time to send for more. Never mind! We won't be=
 'done.' Let's light a=20

camp-fire and cook on that. We must manage somehow."  "We certainly can't d=
isappoint them!"=20

"Not after all this fuss."  The back of the summer-house, as being a partic=
ularly retired and=20

secluded spot, was chosen as the rendezvous, and when the nineteen juniors,=
 interested and=20

appreciative, came fluttering up the garden, they were met by scouts, condu=
cted round,=20

commanded to squat in a circle on the ground, and requested to make less no=
ise.  "D'you want the=20

whole of the school to butt in?" warned Jess. "Then keep quiet, can't you? =
Much taffy you'll get if=20

Rachel catches us. Your only chance is to lie low, you little sillies."  "R=
achel's playing tennis!"=20

giggled Evelyn Carr.  "There are other prefects as well as Rachel. Pull you=
rselves together and=20

don't get so excited."  The juniors, who had been talking at the top of the=
ir voices, squealing, and=20

otherwise raising the echoes, restrained their transports and contented the=
mselves with whispers=20

and giggles. The Camellia Buds were fetching fuel, which they had purloined=
 from the gardener's=20

wood-shed. They commenced to build a camp-fire.  Before very long the flame=
s were dancing up.=20

Now, the hostesses in their enthusiasm to be hospitable had foolishly forgo=
tten that it is one thing=20

to stir a pan over a methylated spirit lamp, and quite another to hold it o=
ver a camp-fire. Peachy,=20

Agnes, and Mary tried in turns and scorched their hands, egged on by the in=
terested circle=20

watching their performance.  "Make a big bonfire, and let it die down, and =
put the pan in the hot=20

ashes, just as we cook chestnuts," proposed Irene.  It was, at least, a fea=
sible suggestion.=20

Anything seemed better than open failure before trot of his horse. Our guid=
es assured us that=20

"they had already begun to be uneasy about us;" and, to justify this inquie=
tude, they gave a long=20

enumeration of persons who, having lost themselves in the Llanos, had been =
found nearly=20

exhausted. It may be supposed that the danger is imminent only to those who=
 lose themselves far=20

from any habitation, or who, having been stripped by robbers, as has happen=
ed of late years, have=20

been fastened by the body and hands to the trunk of a palm-tree.  In order =
to escape as much as=20

possible from the heat of the day, we set off at two in the morning, with t=
he hope of reaching=20

Calabozo before noon, a small but busy trading-town, situated in the midst =
of the Llanos. The=20

aspect of the country was still the same. There was no moonlight; but the g=
reat masses of nebulae=20

that spot the southern sky enlighten, as they set, a part of the terrestria=
l horizon. The solemn=20

spectacle of the starry vault, seen in its immense expanse--the cool breeze=
 which blows over the=20

plain during the night--the waving motion of the grass, wherever it has att=
ained any height;=20

everything recalled to our minds the surface of the ocean. The illusion was=
 augmented when the=20

disk of the sun appearing on the horizon, repeated its image by the effects=
 of refraction, and, soon=20

losing its flattened form, ascended rapidly and straight towards the zenith=
.  Sunrise in the plains is=20

the coolest moment of the day; but this change of temperature does not make=
 a very lively=20

impression on the organs. We did not find the thermometer in general sink b=
elow 27.5; while near=20

Acapulco, at Mexico, and in places equally low, the temperature at noon is =
often 32, and at sunrise=20

only 17 or 18 degrees. The level surface of the ground in the Llanos, which=
, during the day,=20


_
went off for fresh supplies of wood, which was soon crackling merrily. But =
alas! the Camellia Buds,=20

being rather overwrought and flustered with their experiments, did not calc=
ulate on the fact that the=20

smoke of their bonfire would give away their secret. Rachel had handed her =
tennis racket to=20

Phyllis, and was taking a turn among nocturnal radiation toward a sky witho=
ut clouds, the earth=20

and air have not time to cool very sensibly from midnight to sunrise.  In p=
roportion as the sun rose=20

towards the zenith, and the earth and the strata of superincumbent air took=
 different temperatures,=20

the phenomenon of the mirage displayed itself in its numerous=20
