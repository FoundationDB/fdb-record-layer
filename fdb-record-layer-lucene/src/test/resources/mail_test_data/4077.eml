"If I were you I would never venture near the 'Chequers;' at least, not wit=
hout my husband," replied Persis.  Nancy flushed, and muttered something th=
at sounded like "with a keeper;" but her good sense approved of that which =
had offended her somehow fall into--a certain man's hands. Then, at last, t=
hey did find the case, just as I'd begun to hope it was safe. I begged the =
Commissary of Police not to open it. In vain. When he did, what was my reli=
ef to see the diamond necklace you _
interest at Nancy, as one who had so narrowly escaped a terrible death.  "I=
 know that you are,=20

Persis Franks; you have always been a true friend to me," replied Mrs. Sand=
s; and the ear of=20

Ned's wife caught with pleasure the emphasis on the word _you_.  Then the b=
aby was duly=20

exhibited and admired; the heart of poor Nancy always warmed towards a baby=
. How he had=20

grown,--how much he was improved,--how like he was to curtains, for fear I =
might be seen from=20

outside, if the lights should suddenly come on. He didn't see the case, as =
he handed it to me, nor=20

could I. Just at that instant there was a knock at the door; and quick as t=
hought I pushed the=20

leather case down between the seat and back of the sofa."  "But what reason=
 had you to suppose=20

that any danger of discovery threatened you because of a knock at the door?=

one laughed and crowed, and showed the dimple on his cheek! Persis was alwa=
ys a patient,=20

smiling listener to the praises of either her husband or her child.  The co=
nversation, however, took=20

before long an abrupt turn. Nancy had something on her mind which, as was u=
sual with her, soon=20

found its way to her tongue.  "Do you think I shall be _able_ to keep the p=
ledge?" she asked=20

suddenly, though Persis had made no it very well, and maybe it is in your m=
ind now--who wants=20

me to marry him. He has wanted it for some time--I think because he admires=
 women who are=20

before the public and applauded by the world; also, perhaps, because I have=
 refused him, and he=20

is one who wants most what he finds hardest to get. He is not a scrupulous =
person, but he has=20

some power and a good deal of influence, because he is very highly=20


_
Franks, however, easily connected the abrupt question with the visit of Mrs=
. Fuddles. Nancy=20

repeated it rather impatiently, as Persis hesitated before giving a reply. =
 "I think that depends upon=20

two things," she answered, looking down as she spoke, perhaps to avoid meet=
ing the gaze of the=20

keen black eyes fixed upon her.  "What are these two things, Persis Franks?=
 You need not mind=20

speaking out boldly; you are not one to force your advice where it's not as=
ked, nor to set yourself=20

up, like Bell Stone, for being a deal better than your neighbors. I want to=
 keep the pledge if I can, if=20

only for the sake of poor John; but how am I to do it?"  "The first thing, =
at least so it seems to me,"=20

replied Persis, "is to keep out of all way of temptation."  "You don't mean=
 to say I'm to cut an old=20

friend," said Nancy, who was longing to renew her dangerous people have 'ax=

hated Raoul. I have fancied--that he hired detectives to spy upon me; and m=

common sense told me that he would let no chance slip to separate me from t=

would work mischief between us--or he would try to ruin Raoul, or crush me-=
-anything to keep us=20

apart. When I saw the Commissary of Police I was hardly surprised, and thou=

pretext had brought him, I said to myself 'That is the work of--'"  "Perhap=
s better not mention the=20

name, Mademoiselle."  "I didn't mean to. I leave that to your--imagination.=

could make of my letters, I was shaking=20
