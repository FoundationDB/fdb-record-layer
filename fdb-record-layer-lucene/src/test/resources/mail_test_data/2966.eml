"You mean your husband doesn't approve?"  "Approve!" Ethel echoed with a sn=
iff. "I'd like to see=20

him disapprove. I have him in fair control, I think." And she knitted her b=
rows in an eager way, for=20

this was a chance to tell how she had done it.  "How long have you been mar=
ried!" her visitor was=20

asking.  "Let me see. Four years? No, two," she replied, with a quick smile=
. "Time does so fly=20

along in this town!"  "It does indeed. It seems hardly any time at all sinc=
e the days when your=20

husband and I were friends."  "Oh, yes, he has often told me about you!" An=
d Ethel shot a swift=20

anxious look. "I know you don't like him," she wanted to add. "But if you'l=
l only give me a chance I'll=20

show you what I have made of this man--or was making, at least, till all of=
 a sudden right out of the=20

clouds there dropped a fat detective!" She laughed at the thought and then =
grew rigid. How silly=20

and pointless to laugh like that! Mrs. Crothers was telling now of the old =
group down about=20

Washington Square, and Ethel was listening hungrily.  "What gorgeous times =
you must have had,"=20

she exclaimed, "in those old days!" The next moment she turned crimson. "I'=
ve said it now. 'Old'! I=20

knew I should!" She caught Sally's good-natured smile and felt again like a=
 mere child.  From this=20

moment on she would take care! She avoided personal topics, and growing gra=
ve and dignified=20

she turned the conversation from Joe to music, concerts, the opera, "Salome=
," "Louise." She=20

carefully showed she was up to date, not only in music but in other things,=
 books she had=20

discussed years ago in the club of the little history "prof," and others sh=
e had been reading since--

Montessori, "Jean Christophe." Hiding her tense anxiety under a manner smoo=
th as oil, she talked=20

politely on and on, and she felt she was doing better now. So much better! =
No more stupid breaks=20

or girlish gush, but a modern intelligent woman of parts. And a glow of hop=
e rose in her breast. A=20

little more of this, she thought, and she would be ready to break off, and =
with a sudden appealing=20

smile take her new friend into her confidence, tell of her trouble and ask =
for advice.  But the smile=20

came from her visitor. Mrs. Crothers had risen and was holding out her hand=
. And as Ethel stared=20

in dismay at that smile, which displayed such an easy indifference to her a=
nd all her view of life,=20

her only woman friend in New York said:  "I'm so sorry I've got to run. I h=
ope you'll come and see=20

me."  From the door in the hallway Ethel came back in a sort of a daze--til=
l her eye lit on the blue=20

china clock on the mantel.  "Seventeen minutes!" she exclaimed. And then af=
ter one quick look=20

around, she flung herself on the sofa in tears. "I bored her! How I bored h=
er! How stupid I was, and=20

comic--a child! And then solemn--too solemn--all music and art--and educati=
on and--how in the=20

world do I know what I said? Or care! I hate the woman! I hate them all! Se=
venteen minutes! Isn't=20

that just like New York?"  But from this little storm she soon emerged. Gri=
mly sitting up on the=20

sofa, she reached out a hand icy cold, took the tea-pot and poured out a cu=
p. It was strong now,=20

thank Heaven! And frowning gravely into space, Ethel sat and drank her tea.=
    CHAPTER XXIV=20

"Now the one thing," she told herself, "is to keep your nerve and be sensib=
le. For this may decide=20

your whole life, you know. . . All right, what next? What's to be done?  "I=
 hate Sally Crothers," she=20

began, "but I may go to see her, nevertheless. She asked me to. Didn't mean=
 it, of course, she=20

was plainly bored! No, I won't do it! I loathe the woman! . . . All right, =
my dear, but who else can=20

you go to? Mrs. Grewe? She's doubtless at home--but there may be that detes=
table hat, tall, rich=20

and shiny, in her hall. It looked as though it owned her soul! No, thanks--=
not yet--not for me! . . .=20

Though she told me you soon get used to it. . . .  "Well, how about going b=
ack to Ohio, to the little=20

history prof, and hating all men--one and all! That sounds exceedingly temp=
ting! . . . I won't do it,=20

though--because if I do, it means I'm beaten here--and I'd lose Susette and=
 the baby!--. . . Quiet,=20



now. . . . And then there's Dwight. He will probably call up soon and ask h=
ow Sally and I got on. I=20

could go to him this very night! How perfectly disgusting! And yet it's jus=
t what Joe deserves! What=20

right had he to believe that of me? . . . Now please keep cool. If I go to =
Dwight I become exactly=20

like Mrs. Grewe--and I'd have to give up the children.  "No, it's back to J=
oe on my knees, to beg=20

him to let me stay right here. And I'll succeed--I know I will! But won't I=
 be under Fanny's thumb?=20

And won't I take back Amy's friends? Like a good repentant scared little gi=
rl! And eat their rich=20

meals and chatter as they do, and dance and grow old--and push Joe on to ma=
ke more money--

more and more--so that I can get fat and soft--like the rest of these cats!=
"  Again her face was=20

quivering. But with an effort controlling herself, she went into the nurser=
y. And on the floor with her=20

wee son, slowly rolling a big red ball back and forth to each other, soon a=
gain she had grown=20

quiet, almost like her natural self. She took supper alone, and then read a=
 novel, page after page,=20

without comprehending. An hour later she went to bed, and there lay listeni=
ng to the town--to its=20

numberless voices, distinct and confused, from windows close by and from th=
e street, and from=20

other streets by hundreds and from a million other homes, and from the two =
rivers and the sea--

voices blurred and fused in one. And its tone, to Ethel's ears, was one of =
utter indifference--good-

humoured enough but rather bored with "young things" weeping on its breast.=
  "Be Mrs. Grewe, if=20

you like," it said, "or Sally Crothers or Fanny Carr. Or go back home to yo=
ur history prof. Each one=20

of these things has been done before by so many thousands just like you. No=
body cares. You=20

have no neighbours. Do exactly as you like."  "Thank you very much," she sa=
id. "I choose to be=20

Sally Crothers first. And if that fails--well, between Fanny Carr and Mrs. =
Grewe there isn't much=20

choice. Do you think so?"  "Oh, no," said the city. And it yawned. But Ethe=
l lay there thinking.=20

"Excuse me," she spoke presently. "Sorry to annoy you again--but is there a=
ny God about?"=20

"None," came the sleepy answer. "Do as you like, I tell you."  She opened h=
er eyes and sat up in=20

bed.  "Now I've been getting morbid again! For goodness' sake let's try to =
be healthy and clear=20

about this!"  And she tried to be. But for some time she made little headwa=
y. It was easy to grimly=20

shut her teeth and resolve, "I've got to do this by myself, talk to Joe and=
 simply make him believe=20

me!" But as soon as she came to the details of what she should say to her h=
usband, his face as=20

she had seen it last--worn and nervous, overwrought--kept rising up before =
her. Could she=20

convince him! "It's my last chance!" If only she knew how to go about it! S=
he wanted to be heroic=20

and face this crisis all alone--but she had been alone so much. Tonight it =
seemed to Ethel as=20

though she had struggled alone for years. Was it all worth while, she asked=
 herself. She could feel=20

her courage ooze again. Her thinking grew vague and uneven. . . . And more =
and more the picture=20

rose of the woman friend she had counted on having--Sally Crothers, who was=
 so clever, an older=20

woman who knew New York, knew what to do in such tangles as this, knew Joe,=
 had known him=20

back in that past which Ethel was trying to raise again. And it was exasper=
ating! "If I could only get=20

at her!" she thought.  Carefully, almost word by word, she went over in her=
 mind her talk with Mrs.=20

Crothers that day, in order to find out her mistakes.  "Do you know what I =
think?" she said at the=20

end. "I think in the first part you did pretty well. You made breaks and we=
re clumsy, and she was=20

amused--but she rather liked you, nevertheless. At least you were a novelty=
. But then you went=20

and spoiled it all by making solemn fool remarks about the world in general=
. And thereupon Sally=20

arose and went. . . . All right, next time I'll be different. I won't be so=
lemn, nor afraid of saying=20

anything incorrect. In fact I'll revel in it! She asked me to come and see =
her, in a tone which added,=20



'Don't.' But I'll be incorrect right there. I will go to see her; and what'=
s more, I'll go tomorrow=20

afternoon! And I won't call up first, for she'd say she was out. I'll get i=
nto her house and get her=20

downstairs--and I'll break right through all smoothnesses and tell her exac=
tly how and why I've got=20

to have a woman friend! I'll give you the chance of your life, Sally Crothe=
rs, to throw out the life-

line!  "If you don't I'll--just swim about for awhile. No use in thinking o=
f that, though."  And suddenly=20

she fell asleep.    CHAPTER XXV  Mrs. Crothers lived in a small brick house=
 on a side street close=20

to Washington Square. As Ethel looked out from her automobile, how dear and=
 homey it=20

appeared, with such a quiet friendly face. "Now for the plunge." She went u=
p the low steps and=20

rang the bell. Thank Heaven it was a rainy day, for when the maid came Ethe=
l went right in, and=20

the rain made that seem natural. At least no door had been shut in her face=
. She wanted to get=20

inside this house!  "Is Mrs. Crothers at home?" she asked. The maid was not=
 sure. Ethel gave her=20

a card and was shown into a long cosy room with an old-fashioned air, where=
 a small coal fire=20

looked half asleep. She began to look around her. The walls were lined with=
 book-shelves, with=20

only a picture here and there. No wall-paper. "How funny." She frowned and =
added, "But it's nice."=20

There was but little furniture, and plenty of room to move about. "What a l=
ove of a mirror." It was of=20

gilt, and it reached from floor to ceiling between the two front windows. G=
ravely she looked at=20

herself in the glass. "Oh, I'm not very excited."  The maid reappeared, and=
 said, "Mrs. Crothers=20

asks you to excuse her. She's sick with a headache this afternoon."  "Oh, w=
hat a lie!" thought=20

Ethel. She stood for a moment irresolute, her heart in her mouth. "I will, =
though!" she decided, and=20

took out another card. "Then take her this little note," she said. And she =
wrote: "I know I am being=20

quite rude--but if the headache is not too severe will you see me just for =
a little while! I would not=20

bother you--honestly--but it is something so important--and it must be sett=
led today." It took two of=20

her cards, and even then it was horribly crowded and hard to read. "Never m=
ind," she thought.=20

"That's as far as I'll go. If she can't read that I'm done for!"  The maid =
had taken the message=20

upstairs.  "Now I've done it, I've gone too far. I'm done for--oh, I'm done=
 for! Well, look about you,=20

Ethel, my love--it's the last look you'll ever get at this room! How dear i=
t is, what taste, what a=20

home. Books, pictures, a piano of course--and the very air is full of the t=
hings that have been said=20

here after dinner, over coffee and cigarettes, by all the people you want t=
o know. Not rich nor=20

'smart' like Newport--just people with minds and hearts alive to the big th=
ings that really count, the=20

beautiful things! . . . Good-bye, my dears--you're not very kind."  "She'll=
 be down in a moment,"=20

said the maid.  "Thank you!" Ethel had wheeled with a start; and again left=
 alone, she stood=20

without moving. "Well, here you are--you've got your chance! And how do you=
 feel? Plain panicky!=20

Never mind, that's just what will catch her attention! Be panicky! Oh, I am=
--I am!" And her courage=20

oozed so rapidly that when her hostess came into the room, and with a smile=
 that was rather=20

strained, said "I am so glad to see you--" the girl who confronted her only=
 stared, and suddenly=20

shivered a little. Then she forced a smile and said, "How silly of me to sh=
iver like that."  "Come=20

here by the fire and sit down." Mrs. Crothers' voice was suddenly kind. "No=
w tell me how I can=20

help you," she said.  "Thank you. Why, it's simply this. I've had trouble w=
ith Joe, my husband--just=20

lately--in the last few days. And the trouble is so serious that--it's my w=
hole life--one way or the=20

other. At least it--certainly feels so! And I have no women friends I can g=
o to. They're all his--hers,=20

I mean."  "Hers!"  "Yes. My sister's. She is dead--but very much alive at t=
imes--through the friends=20

she left behind her. I've been fighting them all my life, it seems--ever si=
nce I married Joe!"  "Why=20



were you fighting them?" Ethel frowned:  "Because they--well, they were all=
 just fat--in body and=20

soul--the women, I mean--and the men were just making money for food and th=
ings to keep them=20

so. Do you know what I mean--that kind of New Yorker?"  "I do," said Mrs. C=
rothers. "Was that the=20

cause of your trouble with Joe!"  "Partly--yes. You see when I tried to sha=
ke them off, they=20

wouldn't be shaken--they hung on--because Joe was growing rich all of a sud=
den. Oh, I got pretty=20

desperate! But then I learned of other friends that Joe had had here long a=
go--before he married=20

_her_, you know. And I hunted for them--one by one. I could feel they were =
just what he needed,=20

you see. I mean that back among such friends I hoped he'd stop just making =
money and get to=20

work--on things he had dreamed of! You understand?"  "I think so--but not f=
ully. Go on in your own=20

way, my dear. Don't try to think. Keep talking."  "Thank you. I was in love=
 with him. There was=20

nobody else, man, woman or child--except Susette. She was Amy's little girl=
. You see, Mrs.=20

Crothers, when Amy died I was there--I had just come to town. So I stayed w=
ith Joe to look after=20

Susette. Then later on I began to feel that he was beginning to care for me=
. And I didn't like that--

on Amy's account, for I worshipped her then. So I broke away and took a job=
. . . . Oh, what in the=20

world am I getting at!"  "Don't try to think. Just tell me. You took a job.=
 What was it?"  Ethel told of=20

Greesheimer, and then of coming back to Joe, of his poverty and of her nurs=
ing Susette, of=20

dreaming of children, of falling in love, of marriage and the birth of her =
boy.  "But all the time Amy=20

had been there. Do you understand! Like a spirit, I mean! She had Joe first=
! She had shaped him!"=20

"Yes--"  "And so when he loved me even more, I do believe, than he ever lov=
ed her--still he did the=20

thing she would have wanted. Amy had taught him to show his love by loading=
 money on his wife.=20

And that was what started everything wrong. For he got rich--for my sake--a=
nd the money brought=20

Amy's friends back in a horde! Oh, now I'm repeating! I've said all that--"=
  "Please say it again!=20

You're doing so well!" Ethel told about Fanny and the rest. "I tried to lik=
e them--honestly! But I=20

simply couldn't!" she cried.  "Why couldn't you? Tell me plainly just what =
it was you wanted."=20

"What I wanted? Plainly? Oh, dear--I can't exactly--"  "What kind of people=
?"  Ethel frowned.  "Not=20

just eaters!" she exclaimed. "I wanted men and women who--well, who were se=
eing something=20

big--and beautiful and real in life! Life is so hard and queer in this town=
--so awfully crowded and=20

mixed up--and empty, somehow. You know how I mean? But they see something i=
n it all. Not=20

clearly--it's way off, you know. And they're busy of course, and by no mean=
s saints. They have=20

their worries and their faults and pettiness--they're human, too, But they'=
re looking for something=20

really worth while! Oh, I can't express it--I really can't!"  "Oh, yes you =
can, you've done quite well,"=20

said Mrs. Crothers steadily. "And now to narrow this down to Joe, you wante=
d him to be like that--

in his work and so in his life with you. Was that it?"  "Yes! And he used t=
o be! You must know=20

that!"  "Yes--I knew that. Your husband and I were once very good friends."=
  "That's it, and I=20

guessed it!" Ethel cried. "I was making wild guesses in the dark. And at la=
st I put my finger on his=20

partner, and we had a talk. It was a talk, a hard one--but I made him belie=
ve me in the end. And he=20

told me a little about you--and I wanted to meet you, oh, so much! But he s=
eemed to be out of=20

touch with you, so he took me to Mr. Dwight instead. I had always wanted to=
 sing, you know--and=20

the rest of it--well, Mr. Dwight must have told you."  "Only a little," was=
 the reply. "I don't yet fully=20

understand. How did all this bring trouble with Joe? It's something serious=
, you said--"  "It's=20

something very nasty." And Ethel began telling of Fanny's revelations. In t=
he midst of it the door-

bell rang.  "One moment." And Sally went into the hall. "Whoever it is, say=
 I've a headache," Ethel=20



heard her tell the maid. "The same old headache," Sally remarked as she gri=
mly pulled the=20

portieres. They waited in a tense little silence till the visitor had gone.=
 "And Alice," Sally called to=20

the maid. "If any one else comes, say I'm out." She turned back to Ethel, s=
miling:  "Suppose you=20

stay to supper. I'll telephone my husband to dine at his club--and we'll go=
 right on with this talk of=20

ours. We'll go on," she added determinedly, "until we have Joe so in our to=
ils that he'll be yours so=20

long as he lives."  Ethel suddenly sniffed and swallowed hard, and said, "O=
h, what a dear you are=20

to me!"  Sally looked at her queerly.  "This is to be a talk without tears,=
 but much good sensible=20

planning," she said. "I don't blame you a bit for having been frightened--y=
ou've been through an=20

ugly time. But I think with a little common sense--"  "I know," said Ethel,=
 "that's just what I need.=20

And that is why I came to you."  "Thank you," Sally smiled again. "Now go o=
n about Mrs. Carr."=20

The talk went on, with interruptions for supper and Sally's two small child=
ren, far into the evening.=20

And Mrs. Crothers did her share--filling in for Ethel the picture of Joe's =
old life, his work and=20

dreams, and his first marriage. She told of several meetings with Amy. And =
all the time she kept=20

watching, probing into this young second wife, skilfully raising Ethel's ho=
pes, her vivid freshness=20

and her youth, her hunger for a life she saw only in dazzling glimpses.  "D=
o you want my advice=20

about meeting Joe! Then here it is," she said at the end. "I needn't say do=
n't go on your knees--"=20

"You needn't!"  "I thought so--you're not that kind. And I wouldn't explain=
 too much about Dwight,=20

and those little things you did with him. Make Joe take you on faith or not=
 at all. Have a long talk=20

and make him listen--don't give him a chance to say a word. Talk right on a=
nd give him the picture=20

of his two wives, and then let him choose--between letting you go, while he=
 takes her friends, or=20

dropping them and keeping you and finding what he had before. I can help yo=
u in that--but before I=20

do, I think you've got to lay a ghost. She's in the way of everything. She =
has been in your home=20

long enough. And her strength is the fact that you and Joe never mention he=
r name to each other.=20

I wonder if you realize how great a danger that has been. At any rate I'm v=
ery sure that you must=20

break the silence now. It has been like a spell between you."    CHAPTER XX=
VI  The next=20

afternoon she sat waiting for Joe. She had come home the night before feeli=
ng so strong and sure=20

of her course. But beginning at the moment when she came into the empty apa=
rtment, subtly and=20

by slow degrees again her home had cast its spell, as though the rooms were=
 haunted. "I've got to=20

lay the ghost," she thought. She had telephoned to Joe to come, and he had =
replied abruptly, "All=20

right, I'll be there about four o'clock." It was just that now. Ethel poked=
 the logs in the fireplace until=20

there was a cheerful blaze. As she straightened up she caught sight of her =
face in the mirror over=20

the mantel. Even in the firelight how gaunt and strained it looked to her. =
 "Not very attractive," she=20

grimly thought. "This has got to be done by brains, my dear."  In a moment =
she heard Joe's key in=20

the door. She heard him taking off his coat and then coming slowly into the=
 room. With an effort=20

she turned and looked at him. His face appeared even more tense and grey th=
an it had two days=20

before; the nerves seemed quivering under the skin. And she felt a pang of =
pity. "He wasn't to=20

blame for the way he acted, it was his wretched nerves," she thought. "He'l=
l have a break-down=20

after this."  "Well, Ethel!"  "Oh, Joe, I'm so glad you're here." All at on=
ce she felt herself change.=20

She had meant to be so firm with him; but now, after one quick anxious look=
, in a low eager voice=20

she said, "I'm not going to talk much of myself. It won't do any good--I'm =
sure it won't. I love you,=20

Joe, and I can see you still love me. We need each other. And if we can jus=
t be sensible now--and=20

you can only believe in me--"  "God knows I want to, Ethel!" His tone was l=
ow, but so sharp and=20



tense that she drew suddenly closer. He turned from her and sank into a cha=
ir, with his hands for a=20

moment pressed to his eyes. "I'm sick of this--I'm not myself. Maybe I acte=
d like a fool. . . . Some=20

of that stuff from Fanny Carr doesn't hold together--it's too thin." He loo=
ked up at her. "But some of=20

it does. And what you'll have to clear up now is why you never let me know.=
"  "The reason I didn't,"=20

she answered quickly, "goes way back into the past. And it's not only about=
 you and me--it's=20

about--about somebody else." She stopped and her throat contracted. She set=
 her teeth. "We=20

must talk about Amy for a while."  There! At last she had brought it out! A=
nd she had seen her=20

husband flinch. For a moment both were silent.  "Why!" he asked. She swallo=
wed hard.  "Because=20

we never have before. We've--gone two years without speaking her name. I ha=
d no idea how bad=20

that might be." She broke off, for her voice was trembling so. "I don't kno=
w how much you've=20

learned in that time--about Amy, I mean--but I've learned a lot, and--I thi=
nk I'd better tell you. I=20

must, you see, or you won't understand what I've been doing lately. I could=
n't have explained=20

before, without speaking of her--and I didn't do that. But I should have, J=
oe, and I will now--if only=20

you'll be patient and let me do the talking."  "Well!"  "Some of it goes so=
 very far back." She leaned=20

forward with a queer little smile: "Amy was good to me when I came--and I h=
ad always worshipped=20

her--I thought she was nearly everything. She made me feel how she--loved y=
ou, Joe--she had=20

ambition, urged you on. But--oh, I've got to try to be clear. What kind of =
ambition was it, Joe! What=20

did you have before you met her? How did you used to look at your work! You=
 were coming up to=20

do big things--but you married her and your work all changed. You threw ove=
r ideals to make=20

money for her. And when your partner tried to hold you, Amy tried to break =
up the firm. Didn't she?=20

Don't you remember?" She waited, but he did not speak. "How hard it is for =
him," she thought, "to=20

admit a thing against her. This won't be easy." But she felt a little thril=
l of pride in him.  "So Bill has=20

been talking, has he," he said.  "Yes, I made him." She went on. "Amy set h=
erself against him--and=20

against all your other old friends. Not at first--I want to be fair to her,=
 Joe--don't think I'm blaming=20

just her for all this. I'm sure that at first she was different--she wanted=
 your friends to take her in.=20

Remember those dinners you took her to, and that week-end party up in Vermo=
nt!"  Joe looked at=20

her sharply:  "Who told you that?"  "Sally Crothers," said Ethel. "She was =
there."  "Sally Crothers?=20

You know her!" he demanded. She smiled at the startled look on his face.  "=
Why, yes," she replied=20

"You see I've been hunting so hard for you, Joe, among those friends you us=
ed to have. And I did=20

it without ever letting you know. Dwight, too--he was only one of them." Sh=
e frowned, and added=20

briskly, "Just incidental, so to speak. But I don't care to talk of him now=
--I'm speaking only of Amy.=20

And from what Sally Crothers has told me, poor Amy must have had some hard =
times. They=20

weren't fair to her. If they'd given her time and a real chance, everything=
 might have been different.=20

But they didn't, they turned her down. And feeling hurt and angry--and feel=
ing besides how she'd=20

have to grow--in her mind, I mean, and her interests, to take any place amo=
ng people like that--I=20

think she hesitated. You might have helped her then, perhaps--but you didn'=
t--and Amy was lazy,=20

Joe--that had always been a part of her. So she wouldn't make the effort. I=
nstead of coming up to=20

you, she made up her mind to pull you down!"  "That isn't true!" he said ha=
rshly. "And if you've=20

been taking for God's own truth what Sally Crothers told you--"  "Stop! Ple=
ase!" cried Ethel=20

eagerly. "I didn't mean what I said just then--I put it badly--oh, so wrong=
! She didn't say, 'I'll pull=20

him down.' She told herself your friends were snobs! And she said, 'I have =
friends who are human,=20

and they're quite good enough for me!' So she went on with Fanny Carr. And =
others came, the=20



circle grew. And it was all done day by day, and week by week. It happened-=
-and you never knew.=20

Nor did she. It was all so natural. But within a year she was going with pe=
ople, and so were you,=20

who cared for nothing you had wanted--women with no growth at all. They wer=
e all--oh, so=20

common, Joe!"  "That's a bit snobbish, isn't it?"  "You can call it what yo=
u like! But I say you can=20

find them all over town--richer and poorer, better and worse--women who wan=
t only common=20

things--just clothes and food and what they call love--with not a wish that=
 I can see except for=20

money to live like that! I'm no prig, Joe! I want pretty clothes, and I wan=
t to be gay and have nice=20

things. But you can get all I want of that and still get what is so much mo=
re!" Her voice dropped;=20

she hurried eagerly on: "Real work you love and which makes you grow, and f=
riends that keep you=20

growing! Ideas and things to know about--and beauty, music, pictures--the o=
pera--books and=20

people, plays--and buildings! The new library--the station--the--the tower =
down on Madison=20

Square! Your work, Joe! And your old friends! Men and women who really thin=
k and feel--not just=20

alive in their bodies! I don't know much about all that. Do you, these days=
! Mighty little! Because=20

she kept you away from it!"  "No!" But she caught the uncertain look in his=
 eyes.  "Are you so=20

sure? Why didn't she ever go to Paris? She must have been dying to go there=
 and shop, but she=20

never let you take her there. She was afraid to let you go near it again--t=
he Beaux Arts work, the=20

student life--afraid that you'd get thinking! So she kept you here and away=
 from your friends. She=20

even kept Crothers out of your firm. You partner fought her hard on that--a=
nd you held out--until=20

one day Crothers came to your office and told you he had changed his mind. =
You remember?"=20

"Yes--"  "Did he give you his reason!"  "Yes--he did--"  "Did he bring Amy =
into it!"  "He did not--"=20

"He should have, Joe. For just the afternoon before, Amy had made a call on=
 his wife--and had=20

said things insulting enough so that her husband had to break off!"  "Sally=
 told you that!"  "Why=20

should she lie?" Ethel threw a quick glance into Joe's eyes. "He believes i=
t!" she thought, and=20

hurried on: "I've talked to her, Joe, in a way that was bound to get the tr=
uth. Oh, I've been hunting=20

hard for you, dear! If Fanny Carr had told her detectives to follow me ever=
ywhere I've been, and=20

not just hunt for the nastiness that was in her own mind about me--they cou=
ld have shown what a=20

hunt it has been! I had so little time, you see! You were all in the balanc=
e--you'd waited so long!=20

Even now you've found you can't draw the plans--the ones you used to dream =
about! I know=20

because I made you try! And I went to Nourse, to your old friend Dwight, an=
d then to Sally=20

Crothers--and asked them all to help me. And as I went on and learned about=
 you as you used to=20

be, I fell in love all over again with the man I found--not Amy's husband--=
mine, all mine!  "And I=20

had almost got you back--when Fanny Carr, with her nasty view of me and wha=
t I was doing,=20

brought you those perfectly rotten reports? And if you believe them, Joe, I=
'm through! Go to=20

Nourse or to Sally Crothers, and they'll tell you I have spoken the truth. =
If you won't believe either=20

them or me, go on alone without me--or else marry Fanny Carr. But if you do=
 believe me and we're=20

to go on together now, you'll have to drop Fanny for good and all, and leav=
e Amy way behind.=20

You'll have to take up your old friends and try to get Crothers into your f=
irm. You may think your=20

business is yours and not mine--but if it's my life, it's my business, too!=
 It's like four walls around=20

me now, and I want to break out and so do you--away from mere money! I've w=
atched you, dear--

seen what a struggle has gone on inside of you--it has worn you out! haven'=
t you made money=20

enough? Let's leave it, go to Paris, and get to work before it's too late f=
or you to get back what you=20

had! And if there's no money, never mind. It will come later on--but don't =
let's be afraid if it doesn't.=20



Don't let's be afraid of pain--of fighting hard and suffering, Joe! I want =
more children! I want you! I=20

want you mine, all mine, my dear--not her husband. Don't you see?"  She had=
 been eagerly=20

leaning toward him. Joe was staring into the fire; the look in his eyes had=
 frightened her and made=20

her hurry to be through.  "What is it?" she asked. And she waited a moment.=
 "Don't you believe=20

what I've told you, Joe?"  "Yes," he said, "I believe all that. I believe a=
 good deal more than that."=20

There was a little silence, and then suddenly he reached for her hand, held=
 it tight and smiled into=20

the fire in a twitching sort of way. "I haven't been quite as blind as you =
think. I've seen a good deal=20

of what you were doing. But--" he frowned--"I'm older than you are. I know =
this job of mine clear=20

through--way back to those dreams you spoke of. I've had some hard mean tus=
sles about it--

lately--and that's my only excuse for acting like a damn fool as I did--the=
 other day. No use in=20

talking of that any more--or of--Amy either. She's--dead."  "Joe!" Ethel wh=
ispered. Tears came in=20

her eyes. He went steadily on:  "She had some fine points--you'll never kno=
w. There were things=20

we needn't talk about now. But you've made me see things, too. I don't thin=
k she'll be in the way=20

any more--I think we'll be able to speak of her."  "Of course! We must! I w=
ant to, dear!" Ethel's=20

voice was shaking.  "Not now." With an effort he rose. "There's something e=
lse to worry about.=20

You don't quite know me yet, you see."  "What do you mean?" She had risen, =
too, and caught his=20

arm. "You're not well, Joe! You're white as a sheet!" He laughed a little. =
 "I'm not quite right.=20

Something wrong in here, I guess." He pressed one hand to the base of his b=
rain and scowled as=20

though it hurt him. "Nothing serious, probably. But before it goes too far,=
 I want you to know that=20

when I get well I'm going to have a try at all that--the work you spoke of.=
 I'm going to try--_but I=20

may be too late! I may be older than you think!_" The tone of his voice was=
 sharp and strained. "I=20

don't know," he said. "The doctor may. About him--that's another point! It'=
s a nerve specialist we=20

need! Telephone your doctor and have him send one here tonight! I'm sorry, =
Ethel--damnably!"=20

CHAPTER XXVII   She got him to bed. The specialist came, and when he had ex=
amined Joe he=20

had a talk with Ethel that left her very frightened. After that came days a=
nd nights, when Joe, as,=20

though in delirium, said things in a jumble which revealed to her the inner=
 chaos he had gone=20

through in the last few weeks. He talked of Amy loyally, even pleading for =
her at times, excusing=20

her. And he talked of Ethel in many moods. Now he was angry at her interfer=
ence; again he saw=20

her side of it, and then his love for her would rise. More often still, he =
talked about work, and here=20

again the struggle went on. Money, money, money--figures, calculations, sch=
emes and rivals,=20

heavy chances. But suddenly all this was gone, and in a pitiful anger at hi=
s own futility he would=20

storm at himself for not being able to put on paper his early dreams.  But =
the weeks dragged by,=20

and at last she felt he was coming back to sanity. With his partner, then, =
she conspired to take Joe=20

over to Paris in April, to stay for a year if he would agree. And as part o=
f the conspiracy, Ethel had=20

several meetings with Nourse and Sally Crothers, in the hope of bringing Sa=
lly's husband into the=20

firm to be there in Joe's absence. This was far from easy, for Crothers nat=
urally held back; he did=20

not care to commit himself until he knew that Joe would agree. And whether =
Joe would agree or=20

not was by no means certain. Watching him as his health came back, Ethel wo=
ndered how he=20

would be when he returned to the office. How much of what he had said to he=
r, the first night of his=20

illness, had come only from a mind keyed up? How much of his promise would =
he remember?=20

Men sick and men well are in separate worlds. She could not speak of it to =
Joe, for the doctor had=20

forbidden it.  At the end of another month, however, Joe was up and about a=
gain; and soon, in=20



spite of the doctor's instructions, he was back at his office hard at work.=
 This of course looked=20

ominous. What was he doing? She could not discover. For his partner, over t=
he telephone, was far=20

from satisfactory. Now that he had Joe back again in that beloved office of=
 theirs, his manner=20

toward Ethel seemed to her to be gruff and unfriendly, to say the least. "S=
tand-offish to the last=20

degree--as though he believed he could handle Joe all by himself!" she thou=
ght in annoyance. At=20

last she sent for him one day and gave him quite a piece of her mind; and a=
lthough not fully=20

successful, she at least made him acquiesce in the plan she and Sally had c=
oncocted for a little=20

gathering to take place one night the following week. It was nearly seven o=
'clock upon the evening=20

in question; and in her room, at her dressing-table, Ethel was completing h=
er toilet. They were=20

going to dine with the Crothers', and Joe was nervous about it.  "Come on, =
Ethel, hurry up!"  "Yes,=20

love, I'm almost ready now. Are you sure the car is at the door?"  "It's be=
en there nearly half an=20

hour!"  "That's good. Just a minute more."  As he angrily lit a cigarette, =
she looked in the glass at=20

him and smiled. "How he dreads it, poor dear," she was thinking, as he stro=
de into the living-room,=20

"meeting Sally and all his old friends." She frowned. "Heaven knows I dread=
 it myself. What am I=20

going to say to them all? And suppose they don't care for me in the least? =
. . . Well, it will soon be=20

over." Presently Joe popped in at the door:  "Look here! If you're not dres=
sed enough--"  "I'm all=20

ready now," was her placid reply. "Don't you think I look rather nice?"  "O=
h, yes. You'll do."  "Thank=20

you, dear. Aren't you going to kiss me!"  "No! Yes! . . . Now come on!"  Sh=
e threw back her head=20

and laughed at him.   "It's beginning so well," murmured Sally to Ethel, as=
 they went in to dinner.=20

"Steady, my child."  "Oh, I'm all right!" was the reply, and Ethel smiled e=
xcitedly. The chorus of=20

exclamations that had greeted Joe and herself had been so warm and gay and =
real. There had=20

been no time for awkwardness. In a moment after their entrance, the hubbub =
of talk and laughter=20

had gone right on as though nothing had happened. At table it continued sti=
ll, and she felt herself=20

borne along on the tide. She looked at Joe, who was on Sally's right, and s=
he thought he was=20

doing exceedingly well. And as for these old friends of his, as she rapidly=
 scanned their faces, they=20

looked far from formidable. On her left side Sally's husband, a tall dark c=
reature with nice eyes,=20

was telling her about the men--two or three writers, an architect and a por=
trait painter rather well=20

known, whose pictures she had read about. She had already learned from Sall=
y what the women=20

did with themselves. They worked, they went to women's clubs, they dined an=
d did the social side.=20

One of them spoke for suffrage, another was a sculptress, one sang, one had=
 a baby. They did not=20

look solemn in the least. Everything went so naturally.  "Well, here I am a=
t last," she thought. She=20

kept throwing quick little glances about. Was it all so much worth while, s=
he wondered. Yes, they=20

were very pleasant and nice. But she had expected--well, something more, a =
kind of a brilliancy in=20

their eyes and the things they were saying. For here were Art and Music, Mo=
vements, Causes and=20

Ideas, and goodness only knew what else! Here were the people who really sa=
w something richer=20

and deeper in life than the sort of existence Amy had led--great bright vis=
tas leading off from the=20

city as it was today to some dazzling promised land. She thought of the lit=
tle history "prof." They=20

were so cosy about it here! She did not want them to be "highbrows"--Heaven=
 forbid! But they took=20

it all so easily!  She thought of the struggles she had been through in ord=
er to get where she was=20

tonight, the ardent hopes and the despairs, and all the eager planning. And=
 just for a moment=20

there came to her some little realization of those other women still outsid=
e, in this city of so many=20

worlds, each with her particular world, her bright and shining goal, her sh=
rine, and pushing and=20



scheming to get in. She recalled the fierce light in Amy's eyes and the ton=
e of her voice: "I may be=20

too late!" Amy had wanted only money, and people like that. But how hard sh=
e had wanted it! . . .=20

These people took it so pleasantly; they seemed so snug in their little gro=
up. She wondered if she=20

would become like that. No, she decided, most certainly not! And suddenly s=
he realized that this=20

was only one more step in the life she was to lead in this town. These peop=
le? For a time perhaps.=20

Then others--always others! That was how it was in New York.  Ethel gave a =
queer little laugh--

which at once she pretended had been caused by something Sally's husband ha=
d said. And she=20

listened to him attentively now. "There's so much time for everything! I'm =
only twenty-five!" she=20

thought. She turned to the painter on her right, and was soon talking rapid=
ly.  The moments=20

seemed to fly political offence out of Her Majesty=E2=80=99s dominions, nor=
 of conviction for an offence=20

which ought not either from its trivial nature or its circumstances to disq=
ualify a person from=20

practising medicine or surgery (_ib._, s. 34 [2]).  The council may order t=
o be paid out of any funds=20

at their disposal such costs as they may deem just to any person against wh=
om any complaint has=20

been made, which, when finally determined, is found to have been frivolous =
and vexatious (_ib._,=20

s. 34 [3]).  When the council direct the erasure of any name or entry, it s=
hall not be again entered=20

except by direction of the council or any of the divisions of the high cour=
t of justice (_ib._, s. 35 [1],=20

as amended Act 1891, c. 26, s. 3).  If the council think fit, they may dire=
ct the registrar to restore=20

any name or entry erased, without fee, or on payment of such fee not exceed=
ing the regular fee as=20

the council may fix (_ib._, s. 35 [2]).  The council is required to ascerta=
in facts, in the exercise of its=20

powers of erasing and restoring, by a committee of their own body of not mo=
re than five, and a=20

written report of the committee may be acted on by the council (_ib._, s. 3=
6 [1], as amended Act=20

1891, c. 26, s. 4).  At least two weeks=E2=80=99 notice of the first meetin=
g of the committee for ascertaining=20

the facts of any case must be served on a person whose conduct is subject t=
o inquiry, and such=20

notice must embody a copy of the charges or a statement of the subject-matt=
er of the inquiry, and=20

specify the time and place of meeting. The testimony is under oath, and sub=
ject to cross-

examination and the full right to call evidence in defence and reply. In th=
e event of the non-

attendance of such person the committee, on the proof of personal service o=
f the notice, may=20

proceed with the inquiry in his absence and without further notice (_ib._, =
s. 36 [5]).  No action can=20

be brought against the council or committee for anything done _bona fide_ u=
nder this act=20

notwithstanding want of form in the proceedings. Any person whose name has =
been ordered=20

erased may appeal from the decision of the council to any division of the h=
igh court at any time=20

within six months from the date of the order of erasure, and the judge may =
make such order as to=20

restoration, confirmation, or further inquiries by the committee or council=
 and as to costs, as to him=20

shall seem right (_ib._, s. 37, as amended Act 1891, c. 26, s. 5).  The app=
eal may be by a=20

summons served on the registrar to show cause, and is founded upon a copy o=
f the proceedings=20

before the committee, the evidence taken, the committee=E2=80=99s report, a=
nd the order of the council=20

certified by the registrar. The registrar is required to furnish to any per=
son desiring to appeal a=20

certified copy of all proceedings, reports, orders, and papers on which the=
 committee acted, on=20

payment of five cents a folio (_ib._, s. 38, as amended Act 1891, c. 26, s.=
 6).  The Act of 1891, c.=20

26, s. 7, provides for procuring the attendance of witnesses before the com=
mittee, and for=20

payment of costs by the person whose name has been directed to be erased.  =
RIGHTS OF=20

REGISTERED PERSONS.=E2=80=94Every person registered is entitled according t=
o his qualifications to=20



practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery, or any of them, as the case may b=
e, and to demand and=20

recover with full costs reasonable charges for professional aid, advice, an=
d visits and the cost of=20

any medicine or other medical or surgical appliances rendered or supplied b=
y him to his patient=20

(_ib._, s. 39).  LIMITATIONS.=E2=80=94One year after the termination of pro=
fessional services is=20

established as a period of limitations to an action for negligence or malpr=
actice by reason thereof=20

against duly registered members of said college (_ib._, s. 40).  EVIDENCE.=
=E2=80=94The register is=20

required to be printed and published, and a copy thereof purporting to be s=
o printed and published=20

is _prima facie_ evidence that the persons specified are registered; and, s=
ubject to the provisions=20

of subsection 2 of this section, the absence of the name of any person from=
 such copy shall be=20

_prima facie_ evidence that such person is not registered (_ib._, s. 41 [1]=
).  In case of the name of=20

a person not appearing in such copy, a certified copy, under the hand of th=
e registrar, of the entry=20

of the name on the register is evidence that such person is registered (_ib=
._, s. 41 [2]).  ANNUAL=20

CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.=E2=80=94Every registered medical practitioner =
is required to obtain=20

from the registrar annually, before December 31st, a certificate under seal=
 of the college that he is=20

a duly registered medical practitioner (Act 1891, c. 26, s. 8).  On payment=
 of all fees and dues=20

payable by such practitioner to the college, the registrar is required to w=
rite his name and the date=20

on the margin of the certificate, and the certificate is deemed to be issue=
d only from such date;=20

any fees properly charged during the time in which a name was erased from t=
he register are=20

legally recoverable on production of the certificate of registration at tim=
e of suit (_ib._).  No=20

certificate is issued to any practitioner indebted to the college, nor unti=

ncil shall appoint, be=20

evidence, that the person claiming is entitled to register it. There is an =
appeal to the council; any=20

name proved to the council to have been fraudulently or incorrectly entered=
 may be erased by an=20

 claiming it has furnished=20

evidence to the satisfaction of the registrar, duly attested by oath or aff=
idavit before a notary public=20

ed, and the cause of=20

the erasure, but not until the appeal, if any has been taken within the tim=
e allowed, has been=20

disposed of (_ib._, s. 23).  Where the council refuse to register, or direc=
t an erasure, the entry shall=20

not be again made except by direction of the council or the order of the su=
preme court or a judge=20

thereof (_ib._, s. 24).  Five days=E2=80=99 notice of the meeting of the co=

rporting to be so printed=20

and published, is _prima facie_ evidence that the persons specified are reg=
istered. The absence=20



of a name from such copy is _prima facie_ evidence that such person is not =

o such license and to=20



register, pass an examination before the board as to his knowledge and skil=
l for the efficient=20

practice of medicine, surgery, and midwifery. Upon passing the examination =
and proving to the=20

satisfaction of the examiners that he has, in an institution for the teachi=
ng of medicine in Her=20

Majesty=E2=80=99s possessions, complied with the rules and regulations made=
 by the provincial board, and=20

on payment of such fees as the board may by general by-law establish, such =
person shall be=20

entitled to a license (_ib._, art. 3,980).  All persons coming from any rec=
ognized college outside of=20

Her Majesty=E2=80=99s possessions desirous of obtaining a license from the =
College of Physicians and=20

Surgeons of the province must previously pass a preliminary examination bef=
ore the examiners=20

appointed by the board or establish to the satisfaction of the board that t=
hey have already passed=20

equivalent examinations, and they must moreover follow in one of the school=
s of medicine in the=20

province a complete course (for six months) of lectures, and such other cou=
rse or courses as shall=20

be necessary to complete the curriculum required by the board. They may pas=
s their professional=20

examination immediately after their preliminary examination (_ib._, art. 3,=
981).  POWERS OF=20

MEDICAL BOARD.=E2=80=94The board of governors of the College of Physicians =
and Surgeons has=20

among other powers the power to examine all credentials and documents purpo=
rting to entitle the=20

bearer to a license to practise and all diplomas, degrees, or other qualifi=
cations sought to be=20

registered, and to require the bearer to attest on oath, to be administered=
 by the chairman, that he=20

is the person whose name is mentioned therein, and that he became legally p=
ossessed thereof;=20

and to register in the books of the college the name, age, place of residen=
ce and birth of every=20

member of the profession practising in the province, the date of his licens=
e and the place where he=20

obtained it (_ib._, art. 3,982).  The provincial medical board, among other=
 powers, has the power=20

to make regulations respecting the tariffs or rates to be charged in towns =
and counties for medical,=20

obstetrical, or surgical advice, or for attendance or for the performance o=
f any operation or for any=20

medicines prescribed or supplied. The tariff must be approved by the lieute=
nant-governor in=20

council, and can only come into force six months after its publication once=
 in the Quebec _Official=20

Gazette_, and that of the order in council approving the same. The tariff d=
oes not, in case of suit,=20

obviate the necessity of proof of giving the advice, care, prescriptions, m=
edicines, and other things=20

therein mentioned (_ib._, art. 3,983).  The said board has power to fix the=
 fees for license and=20

registration (_ib._, art. 3,984).  QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATE.=E2=80=94The=
 qualifications of a=20

candidate for a license are:  1. That he holds a certificate of study from =
a licensed physician for the=20

period intervening between the courses of lectures which he has followed.  =
2. That he has reached=20

the age of twenty-one years.  3. That he has followed his studies during a =
period of not less than=20

four years, commencing from the date of his admission by the board to study=
 medicine.  4. That=20

during said four years he attended at some university, college, or incorpor=
ated school of medicine=20

=99 courses of general or descriptive=20

anatomy, of practical anatomy, of surgery, of the practice of medicine, of =
midwifery, of chemistry,=20

of materia medica and general therapeutics, of the institutions of medicine=
 or physiology and=20

general pathology, of clinical medicine, and of clinical surgery; one six-m=
onths=E2=80=99 course or two=20

three-months=E2=80=99 courses of medical jurisprudence, one three-months=E2=
=80=99 course of botany, one three-

months=E2=80=99 course of hygiene, and a course of not less than twenty-fiv=
e demonstrations upon=20

microscopic anatomy, physiology, and pathology.  5. That he attended the ge=
neral practice of a=20

hospital in which are contained not less than fifty beds under the charge o=
f not less than two=20



physicians or surgeons, for not less than one and one-half years or three p=
eriods of not less than=20

six months each.  6. That he has attended six cases of labor and compounded=
 medicines for six=20

months.  Each six-months=E2=80=99 course shall have consisted of one hundre=
d and twenty lectures except=20

in the case of clinical medicine, clinical surgery, and medical jurispruden=
ce.  Of four years=E2=80=99 study=20

required by this section, three six-months=E2=80=99 sessions, at least, mus=
t be passed in attending upon=20

lectures at a university, college, or incorporated school of medicine recog=
nized by the board.  The=20

first of such courses must have been attended during the session immediatel=
y succeeding the=20

preliminary examination, and the last during the fourth year of study, and =
the candidates must=20

undergo an examination on the final subjects of the curriculum at the end o=
f the session in the=20

fourth year of study (_ib._, art. 3,985).  MEMBERS OF COLLEGE.=E2=80=94All =
persons obtaining a=20

license to practise from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the prov=
ince are members of=20

the college, but are not eligible for governors within four years from the =
date of their admission as=20

members (_ib._, art. 3,986).  WOMEN.=E2=80=94The provincial medical board h=
as power to make=20

regulations respecting the admission of women to the study and practice of =
midwifery. Women=20

who were legally qualified on the 31st of October, 1879, to practise as mid=
wives in the province,=20

while required to conform to the rules of said college, retain their right.=
 Nothing in the act or the=20

regulations shall prevent women in the country from practising midwifery or=
 assisting at=20

accouchements without being admitted to the study or practice of midwifery;=
 but they must obtain=20

a certificate from a duly licensed physician certifying that they have the =
necessary knowledge=20

(_ib._, art. 3,987).  REGISTER.=E2=80=94The medical board is required to ca=
use to be kept by the=20

registrar a register of persons duly licensed and registered, and who have =
complied with the law=20

and the regulations of the board, and those persons only whose names are in=
scribed therein are=20

deemed to be qualified and licensed (_ib._, art. 3,988).  The registrar is =
required from time to time=20

to make the necessary alterations in the register (_ib._, art. 3,989).  EVI=
DENCE.=E2=80=94The registrar,=20

under the direction of the board of governors, causes to be printed, publis=
hed, and distributed to=20

the members, from time to time, a copy, called _The Quebec Medical Register=
_, of the register,=20

containing names, surnames, residences, medical titles, diplomas, and quali=
fications conferred by=20

a college or other medical body, with the dates of the same. A printed copy=
, certified under the=20

hand of the registrar as such, is _prima facie_ evidence that the persons n=
amed and entered have=20

been registered in accordance with this law. The absence of the name of any=
 person from such=20

copy is _prima facie_ proof that such person has not been lawfully register=
ed; provided always in=20

case a person=E2=80=99s name does not appear on such printed copy, a copy o=
r extract from the register=20

certified by the registrar of the college of the entry of such person=E2=80=
=99s name on the register is proof=20

that such person is duly registered (_ib._, art. 3,990).  A certificate und=
er the hand of the registrar=20

of the payment of the annual contribution of members of the college is _pri=
ma facie_ evidence that=20

such payments have been made (_ib._, art. 3,991).  NEGLECT TO REGISTER.=E2=
=80=94A person=20

entitled to register who neglects to register is not entitled to practise m=
edicine, surgery, or=20

midwifery, or to claim any of the rights and privileges conferred, and is l=
iable for all penalties=20

imposed for practising without registration, saving the right of certain me=
mbers holding a license=20

from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada (_ib._, art. 3,=
992).  ESTABLISHED=20

PRACTITIONER.=E2=80=94A person who has attended medical lectures during thr=
ee sessions of a=20

medical school in the British possessions, and who has actually been engage=
d in the practice of=20



medicine for over thirty years in the province, may, on proof of these fact=
s to the satisfaction of the=20

provincial medical board, and producing a certificate signed by two residen=
t medical practitioners=20

in the neighborhood where he has practised that he has succeeded in his pro=
fession, and is=20

entitled to the consideration of the board, be entitled to a license and to=
 registration without an=20

examination (_ib._, art. 3,993).  UNREGISTERED PERSONS.=E2=80=94No person u=
nless otherwise=20

authorized is entitled to recover any charge for medical or surgical advice=
, or professional service,=20

or for the performance of any operation, or for any medicines prescribed or=
 supplied, nor is he=20

entitled to any of the rights or privileges conferred, unless he has regist=
ered according to law and=20

paid his annual contribution to the college (_ib._, art. 3,994).  No certif=
icate required from any=20

physician or surgeon or medical practitioner is valid unless the signer is =
registered (_ib._, art.=20

3,995).  PERSONS GUILTY OF FELONY.=E2=80=94Any registered member of the med=
ical profession=20

convicted of felony forfeits his right to registration, and the medical boa=
rd causes his name to be=20

erased from the register (_ib._, art. 3,996).  If a person known to have be=
en convicted of felony=20

presents himself for registration, the registrar is required to refuse him =
registration (_ib._, art.=20

3,997).  OFFENCES AND PENALTIES.=E2=80=94A person not entitled to register =
convicted of having=20

practised in contravention of this law, for reward or the hope of reward, i=
s liable to a penalty of=20

$50.  A like penalty is incurred by every person assuming the title of doct=
or, physician, or surgeon,=20

or any other name implying that he is legally authorized to practise, if un=
able to establish the fact=20

by legal proof, and by every person who in an advertisement in a newspaper =
or in a written or=20

printed circular, or on business cards or on signs, assumes a designation s=
o as to lead the public=20

to believe that he is duly registered or qualified; and by every person who=
 offers or gives his=20

services as a physician, surgeon, or accoucheur for gain or hope of reward,=
 if he be not duly=20

authorized and registered.  BURDEN OF PROOF.=E2=80=94In every prosecution,=
=20


_
But soon the men had followed them, and every one was smoking, and Ethel wa=
s trying a=20

cigarette. The talk ran on, about this and that. But over on her side of th=
e room, Sally had led the=20

conversation back to Joe's old student days, to the Beaux Arts and life in =
the Quarter. Ethel heard=20

snatches from time to time, and she kept throwing vigilant glances over at =
her husband's face. He=20

seemed to be responding, with a hungriness that thrilled his wife. Again he=
 would fall silent, with=20

an anxious gleam in his eyes. "He's wondering if he's too old!" she thought=
, and she crossed the=20

room and joined them.  Sally was cleverly drawing him out about some of tho=
se early plans of his.=20

And though awkward at first, he was warming up. In the room the hubbub died=
 away. "They're=20

listening to Joe!" thought Ethel. Joe kept talking on and on. Every few mom=
ents some one would=20

break in to ask him something, or to raise a little laugh. Ethel tingled wi=
th pride in him, and with=20

hope for the success of her scheming.  Now the crucial time arrived. For on=
e by one the guests=20

had gone, till only she and Joe and Nourse remained with Sally and her husb=
and. The moment for=20

springing the great idea had come at last. Nourse was to do the talking. Th=
at had been arranged=20

ahead, at a meeting of Nourse and the two wives. But all at once in a panic=
 now, Ethel knew that=20

Nourse would bungle it. Why had she entrusted so much to this man? Had he e=
ver shown tact in=20

his whole life? And why so soon? Oh, it had been rash! The evening had pass=
ed so gorgeously.=20

Why not have waited and had other evenings to pave the way and make it sure=
! She tried to signal=20

to Nourse to stop him, but he could or would not hear! Now he was getting r=
eady to speak.  "Well,"=20

he said, rising and turning on Ethel a curious smile, "I guess it's time I =
was going home."  She=20

stared at him in blank relief. So he had some sense about things, after all=
.   "But look here, Bill,"=20

said her husband, "before you go, let's give these scheming women incumbent=
 on the party=20

prosecuted.  WITNESSES.=E2=80=94Members of the college are not incompetent =
witnesses by reason of=20

their membership.  COSTS.=E2=80=94The court imposing a penalty adds costs, =
and, in default of payment=20

within a delay which it fixes, condemns the defendant to imprisonment in a =
common jail of the=20

district for sixty days (_ib._, art. 3,998).  EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94In cases wh=
ere proof of registration is=20

required, the production of a printed or other copy or extract from the reg=
ister, certified under the=20

hand of the registrar of the college, is sufficient evidence that all perso=
ns named therein are=20

registered practitioners and any certificate upon such proof, or other copy=
 of the register or extract=20

from such register, purporting to be signed by any person in his capacity o=
f registrar of the college,=20

is _prima facie_ evidence that such person is registrar without proof of th=
e signature or of his=20

being in fact such registrar (_ib._, art. 3,999).  HOM=C5=92OPATHISTS.=E2=
=80=94The rights of hom=C5=93opathists=20

are not affected by the foregoing sections (_ib._, art. 4,002).  The hom=C5=
=93opathic physicians and=20

surgeons of the province form a corporation under the name of the Montreal =
Hom=C5=93opathic=20

Association (_ib._, art. 4,003).  The corporation has power to appoint thre=
e medical graduates of a=20

British or provincial university or medical licentiates of a British or pro=
vincial college or board=20

legally incorporated to be a board of examiners, to examine all persons who=
 may desire to obtain=20

a license to practise hom=C5=93opathic medicine (_ib._, art. 4,008).  A per=
son desiring to be examined=20

touching his qualifications to practise according to the doctrines and teac=
hing of hom=C5=93opathy=20

shall give notice in writing of at least one month to the secretary or trea=
surer of the association,=20

and show that he is not less than twenty-one years of age; has followed med=
ical studies for not=20

less than four years under the care of one or more duly qualified medical p=
ractitioners; has=20

attended at some recognized university or=20


_
in our affairs."  "Right," growled Nourse. And a moment later the three men=
 confronted two=20

astonished wives, and Bill was gravely announcing, "We've done this thing a=
ll by ourselves. The=20

firm is 'Nourse, Lanier and Crothers.' And from this night on we propose to=
 do business without=20

any interference from wives. Understand!" He frowned menacingly. "We settle=
d that this afternoon.=20

And the next thing we decided was that Joe packs up this wife of his, wheth=
er she happens to like=20

it or not, and takes her over to Paris. See? And if she tries to keep him f=
rom work by yanking him=20

all around to the shops--"  While Nourse growled on in his surly way, Ethel=
 slipped quietly into the=20

hall--where presently Sally with one arm about her was proffering a handker=
chief and murmuring.=20

"Use mine, dear."    CHAPTER XXVIII  On the night before they sailed for Fr=
ance, long after she=20

had gone to bed Ethel came out in her wrapper into the warm dark living-roo=
m. There was=20

something she had forgotten to do, and she wanted to get it off her mind. S=
he switched on the light=20

by the doorway, and looked about her smiling, but with a little shiver, too=
.  The ghost was gone--or=20

nearly so. Already the room had been stripped bare. Only Ethel's desk was l=
eft, and a chair or two=20

and the long, heavy table with a lamp at either end. Amy's picture was stil=
l on the table, but it lay=20

now on its back and looked up at the ceiling as though it knew it must soon=
 depart. Tomorrow the=20

movers would finish their work. Soon somebody else's things would be here, =
and somebody else's=20

life would pour in and fill the room and make it new. Somebody else. What k=
ind of a woman?=20

Another Amy, or Fanny Carr, or Sally Crothers or Mrs. Grewe? What a funny, =
complicated town.=20

On her return a year from now, Ethel had already decided to take a small ho=
use near Washington=20

Square. How long would that experiment last! Doubtless in the years ahead s=
he would try other=20

homes, one after the other. "Why do we move so in New York!" She thought of=
 that plan of her=20

husband's for the future city street, with long rows on either hand of huge=
 apartment buildings with=20

receding terraces, numberless hanging gardens looking into the street below=
. And she wondered=20

whether the city would ever be anything like that? "In New York all things =
are possible." . . .=20

"However." Ethel went to her desk and rummaged for paper, pen and ink. Then=
 she took out of a=20

cubby-hole a bulky letter and read it through. It was the "round-robin" com=
e again on its annual=20

journey over the land. It had been in a lonely mining camp, on a cattle ran=
ch, in a mill town and in=20

cities large and small. There were many kinds of handwriting here, and wide=
ly different stories of=20

the growth, the swift unfolding, of the lives of a new generation of women.=
 "Girls like me." She=20

read it through.  Then she took up her pen and began to write swiftly:  "I =
have been here for over=20

three years--but it was hard to write before, because everything was far fr=
om clear." She stopped=20

and frowned. "How much shall I tell them?" An eagerness to be frank and tel=
l all was mingled with=20

that feeling of Anglo-Saxon reticence which had been bred in Ethel's soul b=
ack in the town in Ohio.=20

"Besides, I haven't time," she thought.  "I feel," she wrote, "as though I =
were just out of danger--

barely out. In danger, I mean, of nervously dashing about after nothing unt=
il I got wrinkled and old=20

at forty--nerves in shreds. I might have done that. I have met a nerve spec=
ialist lately--and the=20

stories he has told me about women in this town!  "However! I want to make =
myself clear. Am I a=20

high-brow? Not at all. I want good clothes--I love to shop--and I propose t=
o go on shopping. If you=20

do not, let me tell you, my dears, that the men in New York are like all th=
e rest--and you would=20

soon be leading a very lonely existence! And I don't want that, I want bush=
els of friends--and some=20

of them men--decidedly! I want to dance and dine about--but I don't want to=
 be religious about it!=20

Nor frantic and get myself into a state!  "Well, but I did start out like t=
hat. When I came here to live-



-" She hesitated. "No, I'd better scratch that out."  "Thank Heaven I got m=
arried," she wrote, "and=20

fell in love with my husband." Again she stopped with a quick frown. "And I=
 had a baby. And I=20

began to find something real." Another pause, a long one.  "I had quite a s=
truggle after that. I was=20

all hemmed in--" she stopped again--"by the city I found when I first arriv=
ed. But I huffed and I=20

puffed and I hunted about--and at last I discovered our New York--the town =
we girls used to dream=20

about at home in all those talks we had! Oh, I don't mean I have found it y=
et--but I've felt it, though,=20

and had one good look. I dined with some people. How silly that sounds. But=
 never mind--the point=20

is not me, but the fact that this city is really and truly crammed full of =
the things we girls used to get=20

so excited about--Art, you know, and Music of anatomy, physiology, surgery,=
 theory and practice=20

of medicine, midwifery, chemistry, materia medica, and therapeutics respect=
ively, and not less=20

than one six-months=E2=80=99 course of clinical medicine and medical jurisp=
rudence respectively, or their=20

equivalents in time; and shall have complied with the regulations of such u=
niversity or incorporated=20

school of medicine with regard to such courses, and shall have followed suc=
h other course or=20

courses as may hereafter be considered by the board of examiners requisite =
for the advancement=20

of a medical education.  All such persons shall, at a regularly appointed t=
ime and place, be=20

examined on all the aforesaid branches by the board of examiners (_ib._, ar=
t. 4,009).  If the board=20

be satisfied by examination that a person is duly qualified to practise eit=
her or all of said branches=20

of medicine, as taught and practised by hom=C5=93opathists, they shall cert=
ify the same under the=20

hands and seals of two or all of such board.  The lieutenant-governor, on r=
eceipt of such=20

certificate, may, if satisfied of the loyalty, integrity, and good morals o=
f the applicant, grant to him a=20

license to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery, or either of them, co=
nformably to the=20

certificate, and all such licensees are entitled to all the privileges enjo=
yed by licentiates of=20

medicine (_ib._, art. 4,010).  The corporation appoints a secretary who kee=
ps a register of names=20

of all persons duly licensed to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery, =
or either of them,=20

according to the doctrines and teachings of hom=C5=93opathy.  Only those wh=
ose names are inscribed=20

in said register are qualified and licensed to practise according to the do=
ctrines and teachings of=20

hom=C5=93opathy (_ib._, art. 4,015).  The said secretary is required to mak=
e the necessary alterations=20

in the addresses or qualifications of the persons registered (_ib._, art. 4=

PENALTIES.=E2=80=94A person practising according to the hom=C5=93opathic do=

contravention of this act, or assuming a title implying that a person is le=

physician, surgeon, or accoucheur for gain or hope of reward, if not duly a=

is punishable with a penalty of $50.  BURDEN OF PROOF.=E2=80=94In every pro=

LEGAL STATUS OF THE DEAD BODY.   =3DDisposal and Obligations to Dispose of =
the=20

Same.=3D=E2=80=94There is no right of property, in the ordinary sense of th=
e word, in a dead human body;=20

but for the health and protection of society it is a rule of the common law=
, and which has been=20

confirmed by statutes in civilized states and countries, that public duties=
 are imposed upon public=20

officers, and private duties upon the husband or wife and the next of kin o=
f the deceased, to=20

protect the body from violation and see that it is properly interred, and t=
o protect it after it is=20

interred. A parent is bound to provide Christian burial for a deceased chil=
d, if he has the means,=20

but if he has not the means, though the body remains unburied so long as to=
 become a nuisance,=20

he is not indictable for the nuisance although he could obtain money for th=
e burial expenses by=20

borrowing it of the poor-law authorities of the parish, for he is not bound=
 to incur a debt. (Reg. _v._=20

Vann, 2 Div. C. C., 325; 15 Jur., 1,090.) On the other hand it has been hel=
d in England, that every=20

things their God. The town opens up if you look at it right--and you find M=
ovements--Politics--you=20

hear people talk--you see suffrage parades--I marched in one not long ago f=
eeling like Joan of Arc!=20

And you find men, too, who are doing things. Big schemes for skyscrapers an=
d homes! I mean=20

that our New York is here!"  Again there came a pause in the writing. Her e=
yes looked excited.=20

She smiled and frowned. Now to finish it off!  "What I want of it all I am =
not yet sure--for me=20

personally, I mean. But there is my husband, to begin with, and his work th=
at I can help grow--and=20

his old friends. And they are not all. I keep hearing of new ones I must me=
et--and they are mixed=20

in with all those things I have discovered in the town. A few of these peop=
le were born here--but=20

most have come from all over the country. Sometimes I shut my eyes and ask-=
-'Where are you=20

now, all over the land, you others who are to come to New York and be frien=
ds of mine and house=20

a dead body lies is bound by the common law, if he has the means to do so, =
to inter the body=20

decently, and this principle applies where a person dies in the house of a =
parish or a union. (Reg.=20

_v._ Stewart, 12 A. & D., 1,272.) And the expense may be paid out of the ef=
fects of the deceased.=20

(Tugwell _v._ Hayman, 3 Camp., 298, and note.)  In Pierce _v._ The Propriet=
ors Swan Point=20

Cemetery, 10 R. I., 227, s. c., 14 Am. Rep., 667, the Court said: =E2=80=9C=
That there is no right of property=20

in a dead body, using this word in its ordinary sense, may be well admitted=
, yet the burial of the=20

dead is a subject which interests the feelings of mankind to a much greater=
 degree than many=20

matters of actual property. There is a duty imposed by the universal feelin=
gs of mankind to be=20

discharged by some one toward the dead; a duty, and we may also say a right=
, to protect from=20

violation; it may, therefore, be considered as a sort of _quasi_ property, =
and it would=20

"I want children--more than one. How many I am not quite sure. That's anoth=
er point--you decide=20

these things." She frowned and scratched this sentence out. "And children g=
row--and the idea of=20

bringing them up makes me feel very young and humble, too. But in that we a=
re all in the same=20

boat--for the whole country, I suppose, is a good deal the same. What a que=
er and puzzling,=20

gorgeous age we are just beginning--all of us! I wonder what I shall make o=
f it? What shall I be like=20

ten years from now? How much shall I mean to my husband--and to other men a=
nd women? But=20

most of all to women--for we are coming together so! I wonder what we shall=
 make of it all? I=20

wonder how much we women who march--march on and on to everything--are real=
ly going to=20

mean in the world!  "Oh, how solemn! Good-night, my dears! A kiss to every =
one of you!"   She=20

folded her letter with the rest, and then she quickly squeezed them all int=
o a large envelope, which=20

she addressed to Miss Barbara Wells, Bismarck, North Dakota. Ethel's eyes w=
ere very bright. She=20

sniffed a little and smiled at herself. "Oh, don't be a baby! It's all over=
 now, you know--I mean it's=20

just beginning!"  She stopped for a moment by the table, with the letter in=
 be discreditable to any=20

system of law not to provide a remedy in such a case; ... but the person ha=
ving charge of it cannot=20

be considered as the owner of it in any sense whatever, he holds it only as=
 a sacred trust for the=20

benefit of all who may from family or friendship have an interest in it.=E2=

Abb. N. C., 72, and note.[493]  The law casts the duty of burial of the wif=

of the husband upon the wife. In Secord _v._ Secord (cited in note 1 above)=
, the Court said:=20

=E2=80=9CThere are cogent reasons connected with public policy and the peac=
e of families, where in the=20

absence of testamentary disposition the possession of a corpse and the righ=
t to determine its=20

burial should follow the administration of the estate.=E2=80=9D Inasmuch as=
 the husband has the first right to=20

administer upon the estate of the wife, and the wife upon the estate of the=
 husband, the law=20

imposes the correlative duty of burial upon the person having such right; a=

that the husband is liable for the=20

looked down at Amy's picture. "That is all any one needs to know."  Her loo=
k was pitying, tender,=20

but a little curious, too.  "I wonder what you were like at my age! I wonde=
r what you went through,=20

poor dear? . . . But it's over now--all over. All we don't like will fade a=
way, and you'll grow so=20

beautiful of the decent interment of his wife from whom he has been separat=
ed, whether the party=20

incurring the expense is an undertaker or mere volunteer.[494]  Where the d=
eceased leaves a will=20

ody, and the duty of=20

burial is imposed upon=20


_
her mother. . . . But she won't be just like you, my dear."  Ethel went slo=
wly out of the room. At the=20

doorway she switched off the light, and the bare, empty room was left in th=
e dark. The photograph=20

was invisible now. On the street below, a motor stopped; and there was a a =
direction by will=20

concerning the disposal of the body could be enforced, and therefore the ri=

direction has been conferred by statute in several States.[495]  And where =

funeral of her husband, it was held that she was liable for the=20
