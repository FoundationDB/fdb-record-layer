philodendron monstera on which you stand, Captain Scott," said Louis, giving him his hand.  "I thank you, Louis, with all my heart. You make me stronger than I was before," replied Scott, as he took the offered hand, and warmly pressed it.  The Maud was going ahead at only half speed, blowing off her extra philodendron monstera on which you stand, Captain Scott," said Louis, giving him his hand.  "I thank you, Louis, with all my heart. You make me stronger than I was before," replied Scott, as he took the offered hand, and warmly pressed it.  The Maud was going ahead at only half speed, blowing off her extra _
identification. Since he wouldn't talk, and I didn't recognize the trail or the place, I hadn't the 

slightest notion of my whereabouts--not the least in the world; didn't know where he was taking me 

or where I had landed when we stopped here."  The big man was leaning against the foot-rail of 

the bed and frowning thoughtfully. "Talked about dropping you into Lost River, did they? H'm. I 

reckon we'll have to look into that a little. Who set them on, son? Got any idea of that?"  "I have a 

very clear idea: it was this man Hathaway you speak of--a big ranchman named Griggs told me his 

name. He came across in the Pullman with me from Omaha; middle-aged, tall, and slim, with a 

hatchet face and owlish eyes. Before I learned his name we had talked a bit--killing time in the 

smoking-room. He said he was interested in mines and timber. Along toward the last he got the 

notion into his head that I was a special agent of some kind, on a mission for the Bureau of 

Forestry, and I was foolish enough to let him escape with the impression uncorrected."  "That was 

Pete Hathaway, all right," was the senator's comment. "His company has been cutting timber in 

the Lost River watershed reserves, and he probably thought you were aiming to get him. You say 

he sent Barto after you?"  "I'm only guessing at that part of it. When I rode away from Twin Buttes 

he was standing on the porch of the tavern, talking to Barto and two others; and I'm pretty sure he 

pointed me out to them. An hour or so later, three horsemen passed me on the mesa, one after 

another. I couldn't see them, but I heard them. It might have been another hour being.  "I am not 

making fun of the idea, Louis; the commander seems to be close aboard of me when there is any 

doubtful question to be decided by me as captain of this craft," continued Scott. "He is looking at 

me, and writing down all I do and say, ready to hold me responsible for everything when I meet 

him again. He is bigger and more present, so to speak, just now than ever before. If he knew the 

situation here at the present moment, it would half worry the life out of him, though he would be as 

dignified as ever."  "You have made a picture of your sense of responsibility; and I am glad you 

feel it so keenly," added Louis.  "This is a tight place for a young fellow like me, and I want to do 

my duty faithfully. If I should follow out my natural, inborn inclination, I should pitch into the Fatime, 

and open fire upon her officers and crew with all the rifles and revolvers we could muster. But I 

don't do that sort of thing now. I am not the same fellow I was when I came on board of the 

Guardian-Mother. Now I shall run away if I get a chance to do so."  "I think you are wise, Captain 

Scott," added Louis.  "Whatever my recording angel sets down for or against me, he shall not write 

that I tried to get into a fight with that pirate," said the captain with a great deal of emphasis.  "You 

know something about her speed, for we had a little trial of it in the Strait of Gibraltar."  "We did not 

beat her in a straight run, and we escaped from her by manoeuvring and the aid of shoal water," 

the captain explained. "I depend upon the same kind of assistance to get out of the present 

scrape."  "Then you have 


_
more past that when they potted me."  "You gave them your name?"  "Yes; and that seemed to 

tangle them a little. Barto said he believed I was lying, but, anyway, he'd give me a chance to 

'prove up.' Then they brought me here, and your--er--Mrs. Blount kindly stepped into the breach 

for me."  "You didn't know Honoria when you saw her?" queried the father.  "No; I wasn't in the 

least expecting--that is, I--you may  "I have. I shall do the best I can to get away from the pirate; 

but we may not succeed. I have no plan of this bay, only the general chart, on which but a few 

soundings are given. We may be driven into a corner where we shall have to see what virtue there 

is in our firearms, though I hope not."  "If we are compelled to fight, I am confident that every fellow 

on board will stand by you. I shall for one; for I
