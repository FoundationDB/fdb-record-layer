"Wal, first of all I give her marm's bundle--ya-as I did! I pitched that th=
ere bundle of aperns right at=20

her, and the way she growled an' tore at 'em was a caution, now I tell ye! =
I seen at once what=20

she'd do to me if she got me, so I left them parts, an' left 'em quick! I s=
tarted off through the=20

woods, hittin' only the high spots, and fancied I could beat the old gal ru=
nnin'. But not on your tin-

type! No, sir-ree! The old gal jest give a roar, come down on all four feet=
, and started after me at a=20

pace that set me a-thinkin' of my sins.  "Jest as sure as you live, if I'd =
kept on running she'd had=20

me within thirty yards. An' I knew if I climbed a big tree she'd race me to=
 the top of it and get me,=20

too. Ye see, a small-round tree was my only chance. A b'ar climbs by huggin=
' their paws around=20

the trunk, and it takes one of right smart size to suit them for climbin'. =
 "I see my tree all right, and I=20

went for it. Missus B'ar, she come cavortin' an' growlin' along, and it did=
 seem to me as though=20

she'd have a chunk out o' me afore I could climb out o' reach. It was jest =
about then, I reckon,"=20

pursued Long Jerry, chuckling again, "when I believe I began to grow tall! =
 "I stretched my arms up=20

as fur as I could, an' the way I shinnied up that he had planned appeared t=
o him more and not less=20

alarming than the reality, his own self-sacrifice was not without a certain=
 calculation and caution=20

too.  All these things had been seriously weighed and balanced in his mind.=
 He had considered his=20

sister's interest, and even his own eventual advantage. He had never neglec=
ted these primary=20

objects of life, and he did not do so now. But though all was taken into ac=
count and carefully=20

considered, Rolls's first magnanimous purpose was never shaken; and the use=
 he made of the=20

important breathing-time of these intervening days was characteristic. He h=
ad, like most men,=20

floating in his mind several things which he intended "some time" to do,--a=
 vague intention which,=20

in the common course of affairs, is never carried out. One of these things =
was to pay a visit to=20

Edinburgh. Edinburgh to Rolls was as much as London and Paris and Rome made=
 into one. All his=20

patriotic feelings, all that respect for antiquity which is natural to the =
mind of a Scot, and the pride=20

of advancing progress and civilisation which becomes a man of this century,=
 were involved in his=20

desire to visit the capital of his own country. Notwithstanding all the fac=
ilities of travel, he had been=20

there but once before, and that in his=20

minute she got to the tree and tried to scrape me off with both paws. She m=
issed me by half a=20

fraction of an infinitessimal part of an inch --that's a good word, that 'i=
nfinitessimal'; ain't it, Miss? I=20

got it off of a college perfesser what come up here, and he said he got it =
straight-away out of the=20

dictionary."  "It's a good word, Mr. Todd," laughed Ruth, highly delighted =
at the man and his story.=20

"Wal!" chuckled Jerry, "we'll say she missed me. I was so scar't that I did=
n't know then whether=20

she had missed me or was chawin' of me. I felt I was pretty numb like below=
 my waist. And how I=20

did stretch up that tree! No wonder I growed tall after that day," said Jer=
ry, shaking his head. "I=20

stretched ev'ry muscle in my carcass, Miss--I surely did!  "There was that =
ol she b'ar, on her hind=20

legs and a-roarin' at me like the Mr. Bashan's Bull that they tell about, a=
nd scratchin' the bark off'n=20

that tree in great strips. She cleaned the pole, as far up as she could rea=
ch, as clean as a bald=20

man's head. She jumped as far as she could, gnashed her teeth, and tried he=
r best to climb that=20

sapling. Every time she made a jump, or howled, I tried to climb higher. An=
', Miss, that was the=20

time I got stretched out so tall, for sure.  "The bear, with wide-open mout=
h, kept on a-jumpin' an'=20

ev'ry time she jumped I clumb a little higher, I was so busy lookin' down a=
t her that I never looked=20

up to see how fur I was gettin' toward the top, so, all of a suddent-like, =
the tree top begun to bend=20

over with me an' sumpin' snapped. 'Twarn't my galluses, neither!" crowed Lo=
ng Jerry, very much=20

delighted by his own tale. "I knowed that, all right. Sna-a-ap! she went ag=
ain, and I begun to go=20

down.  "I swanny! but that was a warm time for me, Miss--it sure was. There=
 was that ol' she b'ar=20

with her mouth as wide open as a church door-- or, so it looked to Jerry To=
dd. They say a feller=20

that's drowndin' thinks over all his hull endurin' life when he's goin' dow=
n. I believe it. Sure I do.=20

'Twarn't twenty feet from the top o' that tree to the ground, but I even re=
membered how I stole my=20

sister Jane's rag baby when I couldn't more'n toddle around marm's shanty--=
that's right!--an'=20

berried of it in the hog-pen. Every sin that was registered to my account c=
ome up before me as=20

plain as the wart on Jim Biggle's nose!"  "Oh, Mr. Todd!" cried Ruth. "Fall=
ing right on that awful=20

bear?"  "That's what I was doin', Miss--and it didn't take me long to do it=
, neither, I reckon. Mebbe=20

the b'ar warn't no more ready to receive me than I was to drap down on her.=
 I heard her give a=20

startled _whuff_, and she come on all four paws. The next thing I done was =
to land square on her=20

back--I swanny! that was a crack. Purty nigh drove my spine up through the =
top of my head, it did.=20

And the ol' b'ar must ha' been mighty sorry arterwards that she was right t=
here to receive me. She=20

give a most awful grunt, shook me off onto the ground and kited out o' that=
 as though she'd been=20

sent for in a hurry! I swanny! I never did see a b'ar run so fast," and Lon=
g Jerry burst into an=20

uproarious laugh.  "But that, I reckon, is the time I got so stretched out =
an' begun to grow so tall,=20

Miss," he added. "Stretchin' an' strainin' to git away from that ol' she b'=
ar was what done it."  Ruth=20

was delighted with the guide; but she was very tired, too, and when the mai=
ds came in she was=20

only too glad to fall in with the suggestion of bed. She was put to sleep i=
n a great, plainly furnished=20

room, where there were three other beds--a regular dormitory. It was like o=
ne of the Prime=20

sleeping rooms at Briarwood Hall.  And how Ruth did sleep that night after =
her adventurous day!=20

The sun shone broadly on the clearing about the camp when she first opened =
her eyes. Mary put=20

her head in at the door and said:  "Your breakfast will be spoilt, Miss Rut=
h, or I wouldn't disturb=20

you. All the men's ate long ago and Janey's fussin' in the kitchen. Besides=
, the folks will be over=20

from Scarboro in an hour. Mr. Cameron just telephoned and asked how you wer=
e."  "Oh, I feel=20

fine!" cried the girl from the Red Mill, joyfully.  But when she hopped out=
 of bed she found herself=20



dreadfully stiff and lame; the jouncing she had received while riding with =
the boy calling himself=20

Fred Hatfield, and the catamount, on the timber cart, and later her first l=
ong walk on snow-shoes,=20

had together strained her muscles and lamed her limbs to a degree. Old Aunt=
 Alvirah's oft-

repeated phrase fitted her condition, and she grimly repeated it:  "Oh, my =
back and oh, my bones!"=20

But the prospect of the other girls, coming--and Tom and his friends, too--=
and the fun in store for=20

them all at Snow Camp, soon made Ruth Fielding forget small troubles. Besid=
es, the muscles of=20

youth are elastic and the weariness soon went out of her bones. Before the =
party arrived from=20

Scarboro she had opportunity of going all about the great log lodge, and ge=
tting acquainted with all=20

it held and all that surrounded it.  The great hall on the lower floor was =
arranged so as to have a=20

broad open fireplace at either end. These fires were kept burning day and n=
ight and the great=20

heaps of glowing logs made the hall, and most of the upper rooms, very comf=
ortable indeed. The=20

walls of this hall were hung with snowshoes, Canadian toboggans--so light, =
apparently, that they=20

would not hold one man, let alone four, but very, very strongly built--guns=
, Indian bows and sheaf=20

of arrows, fish-spears, and a conglomeration of hunting gear for much of wh=
ich Ruth Fielding did=20

not even know the names, let alone their uses.  Outside the snow had been c=
leared away=20

immediately around the great log house and a wide path was cut through the =
drifts down to a small=20

lake, or pond. In coming from Rattlesnake Hill the night before with the ol=
d hermit, and the boy=20

who called himself Fred Hatfield, they had come down a long incline in sigh=
t of the camp. Now,=20

Ruth saw that a course had been made level upon that hillside, banked up on=
 either side with=20

dykes of snow, and water poured over the whole to make a perfect slide. The=
re was a starting=20

platform at the top and the course was more than half a mile in length, Lon=
g Jerry told her.  But=20

when she had seen all these things sleigh bells were heard and Ruth ran out=
 to welcome her=20

friends.     CHAPTER XI  THE FROST GAMES   The big sleigh in which were Hel=
en and the other=20

girls swept into the clearing in advance and Ruth's chum led the chorus add=
ressed vociferously to=20

the girl from Red Mill.  "Oh, Ruthie!"  "The lost is found!"  "And she got =
here first--wasn't that cute=20

of her?"  "Oh, _do_ tell us all about it, Ruth," cried Lluella Fairfax.  "H=
owever could you scare us=20

so, Ruthie?" cried Jennie Stone, the heavyweight. "I was so worried I was a=
ctually sick."  "And that=20

is positively 'no error,'" laughed Belle Tingley. "For once Heavy was so tr=
oubled that she couldn't=20

eat."  Helen was out of the sleigh at once and hugged Ruth hard. "You bless=
ed girl!" she cried. "I=20

was _so_ afraid something dreadful had happened to you."  "And what became =
of that horrid boy=20

Mr. Cameron tried to take to Scarboro?" demanded Madge Steele.  The boys pi=
led out of their=20

sledge before Ruth could answer these questions, and she was unable to give=
 a very vivid=20

explanation of all that had happened to her since leaving the train, until =
the whole party was=20

gathered before one of the open fires in the hall, waiting for dinner. Befo=
re this hour came,=20

however, and while the rest of the young folks were getting acquainted with=
 the possibilities of=20

Snow Camp, Ruth had a serious talk with Mr. Cameron regarding the mysteriou=
s boy who had=20

disappeared on the verge of the Snow Camp reservation.  "I don't know how h=
e escaped us. He=20

sped away through the woods with the old hermit's snowshoes--I am sure of t=
hat. And that old=20

Rattlesnake Man didn't seem to be bothered at all by his loss," Ruth said. =
 "Perhaps that hermit=20

knows something about the fellow. We'll look into that," said the merchant,=
 gravely. "However,=20

Ruth, you did what you thought was right. It was reckless. I cannot commend=
 you for leaving the=20

train, child. Something dreadful might have happened to you."  "I thought s=
omething dreadful=20



_did_ happen to me," said Ruth, with a shudder, "when those mules ran away =
and that catamount=20

leaped up on the timber cart."  "I believe you! And your going to the cabin=
 of that rattlesnake=20

catcher. They say he is mad, and he handles the serpents just as though the=
y were white mice.=20

The people hereabout are afraid of him," said Mr. Cameron, earnestly.  "He =
was as kind as he=20

could be to me," said Ruth, shaking her head. "I don't think I should ever =
be afraid of him. His eyes=20

are kind. But the snakes--oh! they did frighten me dreadfully."  "From what=
 I hear of this young=20

man, 'Lias Hatfield, who is in jail at Scarboro, he is a decent lad and has=
 worked hard for his=20

stepmother. The half-brother he shot was about the age of this boy we found=
 down home. But=20

_his_ body was recovered from the river only the other day when they arrest=
ed 'Lias. I shall make=20

it my business to see the Hatfields personally and learn, if possible, how =
a stranger like that boy=20

who came here with you, Ruth, could have obtained Mr. Hatfield's old wallet=
."  "He had some deep=20

interest in the mystery of this shooting," declared Ruth, and she told the =
merchant of the=20

newspaper clipping that had dropped out of the old wallet when she had unde=
rtaken to dry the=20

boy's clothing at the Red Mill.  Meanwhile, the other young folks were high=
ly delighted over the=20

possibilities for fun at Snow Camp. Tom and his friends did not pay much at=
tention to what was=20

inside the great log house; but before noon they knew all that was to be do=
ne outside and were=20

unhappy only because they did not know which to do first. In addition, Busy=
 Izzy had exhausted=20

himself and every man about the place, asking questions; and finally Tom an=
d Bob gagged him=20

with his own handkerchief and threatened to tie him up and not give him any=
 dinner if he did not=20

stop it.  "But _do_ let him ask for a second helping to pudding, boys," urg=
ed the kind-hearted=20

Heavy. "It's going to be fine--I had a taste of the dough. Mary says it's '=
Whangdoodle Pudding,=20

with Lallygag Sauce'; but you needn't be afraid of the fancy name she gives=
 it," added the plump=20

girl, rolling her eyes. "It's just scrumptious!"  They laughed at Heavy's e=
cstasies, yet all did full=20

justice to the pudding. Such a hearty appetite as everybody had! The snappi=
ng cold and the odor=20

of balsam and pine gave a tang to the taste that none of them had ever know=
n before. The girls=20

were full of plans for quiet hours around the great open fires, as well as =
for the out-of-door fun; but=20

Tom was leader on this first day of the vacation at Snow Camp, and he decla=
red for skating in the=20

afternoon.  Even Mrs. Murchiston went down to the pond.  The boys took turn=
s in pushing her=20

about in an ice-chair. But Mr. Cameron put on skates and proved himself mas=
ter of them, too.=20

Long Jerry came down to watch them and grinned broadly at the boys' antics =
on the ice. Jerry was=20

no skater; but he was stringing snowshoes and by the morning would have eno=
ugh ready for the=20

whole party and promised to teach the young folk the art of walking on them=
 in half a day.  That=20

afternoon on the ice only put an edge on the appetite of the whole party fo=
r the frost games.=20

"Plenty of time to make those pine-needle pillows for the girls at Briarwoo=
d, if we have a stormy=20

day," quoth Helen Cameron. "We mustn't mope before the fire this evening. T=
he moon is coming=20

up--big as a bushel and red as fire! Oh, we'll have some fun this night."  =
"What now?" demanded=20

Madge Steele. "I see the boys have stolen out after supper. A sleigh ride?"=
  "No; although that=20

would be fun," said Helen.  "Oh, dear! Can't we take it easy this evening?"=
 whined Heavy, after a=20

mighty yawn. "I _was_ so hungry--"  "You shouldn't give way to that dreadfu=
l appetite of yours,=20

Jennie Stone!" cried Belle Tingley. "If there's any fun afoot I want to be =
in it."  "Come on! All=20

ready!" shouted the boys outside the house, and the sextette of girls ran t=
o get on their wraps.=20

They bundled out of the house to find Tom, Bob and Isadore each drawing a l=
ong, flat, narrow=20



toboggan. Helen clapped her hands and shouted:  "Fine! fine! See these sled=
s, girls."  "We're=20

going to shoot the chutes, Heavy," sang out Madge. "Do you think you can st=
and it?"  "Now, don't=20

any of you back out," Tom said. "Each of us will take two girls on his sled=
. There's plenty of room."=20

"You'd better draw matches for us," said the irrepressible Heavy. "That is,=
 if you intend drawing=20

_us_--two to each toboggan--to the top of that slide. I never did care much=
 for boys--they are=20

greedy; but which one of you could drag Madge and me, for instance, up that=
 hill?"  "We draw the=20

line at that," cried Tom. "Those who can't toddle along to the top of the c=
hute needn't expect to=20

ride to the bottom."  They all hurried off, laughing and shouting. It was a=
 most beautiful moonlight=20

night. Save their own voices, only the distant barking of a fox broke the g=
reat silence that wrapped=20

the snow-clad country about. None of the grown folk followed them. The part=
y had the hill to=20

themselves.  It being a race to the hill-top, with the first two girls to t=
ake their places on the=20

toboggan of the first boy, naturally Heavy was out of the running, and boun=
d to be last. She came=20

panting to the starting platform, and found Ruth waiting to share Isadore's=
 sled with her.  Tom, with=20

Madge and Belle, had already shot down the icy chute. Bob Steele, with Llue=
lla and Helen before=20

him, dropped over the verge of the platform and their toboggan began to whi=
z down the pathway,=20

as Jennie plumped down upon the remaining toboggan.  "Come on, Ruthie! You'=
re a good little=20

thing to wait for me--and I guess Tom Cameron didn't like it much, either? =
He wanted you."=20

"Nonsense, Jennie," returned Ruth, with a laugh. "What does it matter? As l=
ong as we all get a=20

slide--"  "Hurry up, now," cried Busy Izzy, troubled because he was behind =
his comrades, if the=20

girls were not. "Sit tight."  He pushed the toboggan over the edge of the d=
rop almost before Ruth=20

was settled behind Jennie. He flung himself upon the sled, sitting sideways=
, and "kicked" them=20

over the drop. The toboggan struck the icy course and began to descend it l=
ike an arrow shot from=20

a bow. Jennie Stone shrieked a single, gasping:  "Oh!"  The toboggan whizze=
d down the path, with=20

the low, icy dykes on either hand, and so rapidly that their eyes watered a=
nd they could not see. It=20

seemed only a breath when the third toboggan shot onto the level at the bot=
tom, and they passed=20

the crew of the first sled already coming back. It was exhilarating sport--=
it was delightful. Yet every=20

time they started Ruth felt as though the breath left her lungs and that sh=
e couldn't catch it again=20

until they slowed down at the bottom of the hill.  She would have felt safe=
r with one of the other=20

boys, too. Isadore Phelps was none too careful, and once the toboggan ran u=
p one of the side=20

dykes and almost spilled them on the course.  "Do look out what you are abo=
ut, Isadore," Ruth=20

begged, when they reached the bottom of the slide that time. "If we should =
have a spill----"  "Great=20

would be the fall thereof!" grinned Isadore, looking at Heavy, puffing up t=
he hill beside them.  "You=20

take care now, and don't spatter me all over the slide," said the cheerful =
stout girl, whose doll-like=20

face was almost always wreathed in smiles.  But Isadore was really becoming=
 reckless. To tell the=20

truth, Bob and Tom were laughing at him. He had been the last to get away e=
ach time from the=20

starting platform, and he could not catch up with the others. Perhaps that =
was the stout girl's fault;=20

but Ruth would climb the hill no faster than Jennie, and so the third tobog=
gan continued far behind=20

the others. As they panted up the hill Tom and his two companions shot past=
 and waved their=20

hands at them; then followed Bob Steele's crew and Helen shouted some laugh=
ing gibe at them.=20

Isadore's face grew black.  "I declare! I wish you girls would stir yoursel=
ves. Hurry up!" he growled=20

quite ungallantly.  "What's the hurry?" panted Heavy.  "There's nobody payi=
ng us for this; is there?=20

Let 'em catch up with us and then we will be--all--to--geth--er--Woof! My g=
oodness me, I'm=20



winded," and she had to stop on the hill and breathe.  "Go on and leave us.=
 Take one trip by=20

yourself, Isadore," said Ruth.  "No, I won't," returned Phelps, ungratefull=
y. "Then they'll all gab=20

about it. Come along; will you?"  "Don't you mind him, Jennie," whispered R=
uth. "I don't think he's=20

very nice."  They got aboard the toboggan once more and Isadore recklessly =
flung himself on it,=20

too, and pushed off. At the moment there came a shrill hail from below. Tom=
 was sending up some=20

word of warning--at the very top of his voice.  But the three just starting=
 down the slide could not=20

distinguish his words.  Jennie shut her eyes tight the moment the toboggan =
lurched forward, so=20

she could not possibly see anything that lay before them. Ruth peered over =
the stout girl's=20

shoulder, the wind half blinding her eyes with tears. But the moonlight lay=
 so brilliantly upon the=20

track that it was revealed like midday. Something lay prone and black upon =
the icy surface of the=20

slide.     CHAPTER XII  PERIL--AND A TAFFY PULL   It seemed to Ruth Fieldin=
g, as the=20

toboggan dashed down the chute toward that strange object in their course, =
as though her lips=20

were glued together. She could not speak--she could not utter a sound.  And=
 yet this inaction--this=20

dumbness--lasted but a very few seconds. The thing upon the slide lay more =
than half way down=20

the hill--a quarter of a mile ahead when her stinging eyes first saw it.  T=
oward it the sled rushed,=20

gathering speed every moment, and the object on the track grew in her eyes =
apace. When her lips=20

parted she screamed so that Isadore heard her words distinctly:  "Stop, Izz=
y! There's something=20

ahead! Look!"  Of course it was foolish to beg of the boy to stop. Nothing =
could halt them once=20

they had started upon the icy incline. But her cry warned Isadore of the pe=
ril ahead.  He echoed=20

her cry, and was as panic-stricken as the girl herself. At first, the thing=
 looked like somebody lying=20

across the slide. Had one of their friends fallen off either of the other t=
oboggans, and been too hurt=20

to rise? Then, the next instant, both Isadore and Ruth knew that the thing =
was too small for that.  It=20

was really a jacket that Bob Steele had tied about his neck by the arms. On=
 the way down the=20

sleeves had become untied and the jacket had spread itself out upon the sli=
de to its full breadth.  It=20

didn't seem as though such a thing could do the coming toboggan any harm; b=
ut Ruth and Isadore=20

Phelps knew well that if it went upon the outspread coat there would be a s=
pill. It would act like a=20

brake to the sled, and that frail vehicle on which the three young folk rod=
e would stop so abruptly=20

that they would be flung off upon the icy course.  Ruth at least understood=
 this peril only too well;=20

but she made no further outcry. Jennie Stone's eyes were still tight shut. =
 One moment the=20

outspread jacket lay far before them, across the path. The next instant--or=
 so it seemed--they were=20

right upon it.  "Hang on!" yelled Isadore, and shot his boot-heel into the =
icy surface of the slide.=20

The toboggan swerved. Jennie uttered a cry. The sled went up the left hand =
dyke like a bolting=20

horse climbing a roadside wall or a side hill.  In Ruth's ears rang the sho=
uts of their friends, who=20

were coming hastily up the hillside. They could do nothing to help the enda=
ngered crew, nor could=20

the latter help themselves.  Up the toboggan shot into the air. It leaped t=
he shoulder of the dyke=20

and--crew and all--darted out into space.  That was certainly an awful mome=
nt for Ruth Fielding=20

and her two companions. Jennie's intermittent squeal turned into a sudden s=
hriek-- as keen and=20

nerve-racking as the whistle of a locomotive. Isadore Phelps "blew up" with=
 a muffled roar as he=20

turned half a somersault in the air and landed headfirst in a huge snowdrif=
t.  That is how the girls=20

landed, too. At least, if they didn't dive headfirst into the drift, they w=
ere pretty well swallowed up in=20

it. And it was providential that they all did find such a soft cushion when=
 they landed.  Their=20

individual shrieks were broken off suddenly by the smothering snow. Their f=
riends, on the other=20



side of the slide, came plunging across the course, and Bob Steele, slippin=
g on the smooth=20

surface, kicked up both feet high in the air, landed with a crash on the sm=
all of his back, and=20

finished the slide to the very bottom of the chute in that most undignified=
 position.  Bob's accident=20

turned the whole affair into a most ludicrous scene. Tom Cameron laughed so=
 hard that he=20

scarcely had the strength to help the girls out of the snowdrift. As for Is=
adore, he had to scramble=20

out by himself--and the soft snow had got down his neck, and he had lost hi=
s hat, his ears were full=20

of snow, and altogether he was in what Madge Steele called "a state of mind=
."  "Huh!" Izzy=20

growled, "you all can laugh. Wait! I'll get square with you girls, now, you=
 better believe that."  And=20

he actually started off for the camp in a most abused state. The others cou=
ld not help their=20

laughter--the more so that what seemed for a few seconds to promise disaste=
r had turned out to=20

be nothing but a most amusing catastrophe.  This ended the coasting for thi=
s particular evening,=20

however. Jennie Stone was pried out of the snowdrift last of all, and they =
all went to the bottom of=20

the hill where Bob Steele sat with his back against a tree trunk, waiting, =
as he said, for the "world=20

to stop turning around so fast." His swift descent had made him dizzy.  The=
y all ran back to Snow=20

Camp, catching up with Isadore before he got there with his grouch, and Tom=
 and Bob fell upon=20

the grouch and dumped it into another snowbank--boy and all--and managed in=
 the scuffle to bring=20

Busy Izzy into a better state of mind.  "Just the same," he declared, "I'll=
 get square with those girls=20

for laughing at me--you see if I don't!"  "A lot of good that'll do you," r=
eturned Tom Cameron. "And=20

why shouldn't they laugh? Do you suppose that the sight of you on your head=
 in a snowbank with=20

your legs waving in the wind was something to make them _weep_? Huh!"  But =
when they got=20

inside the big hall, where the two fires burned, Izzy forgot his grouch. Th=
ere was a basket of=20

popcorn and several "poppers" and the crowd of young folk were soon shellin=
g corn and popping=20

it, turning the fluffy, snow-white kernels into big bowls, over which thick=
 cream was poured, and, as=20

Jennie declared, "they ate till they couldn't eat another crumb!"  "Isn't i=
t just grand?" cried Belle=20

Tingley, when the girls had retired to the big room in which Ruth Fielding =
had slept alone the night=20

before. "I never did know you could have so much fun in the woods in the de=
ad of winter. Helen!=20

your father is just the dearest man to bring us up here! We'll none of us f=
orget this vacation."  But=20

in the morning there were new things to go and learn. The resources of Snow=
 Camp seemed=20

unending. As soon as breakfast was over there was Long Jerry ready with sno=
wshoes for all. Tom=20

and Helen, as well as Bob Steele, were somewhat familiar with these impleme=
nts. And Ruth had=20

had one unforgettable experience with them.  But at first there were a good=
 many tumbles, and=20

none of the party went far from the big lodge on this occasion. They came i=
nto the mid-day dinner=20

pretty well tired, but oh, how hungry!  "I declare, eating never seemed so =
good before," Bob Steele=20

murmured. "I really wish I could eat more; but room I have not!"  Heavy wen=
t to sleep before the=20

fire directly after the meal, but was awakened when the girls all trooped o=
ut to the kitchen to make=20

molasses taffy. The boys had gone with Long Jerry to try to shoot squirrels=
; but they came back=20

without having any luck before the girls were fairly in possession of Janey=
's kitchen.  "Let us help--

aw, do!" cried Tom, smelling the molasses boiling on the range and leading =
the way into the=20

kitchen.  "You can't cook anything good to eat when there are boys within a=
 mile, and they not=20

know it," sighed Jennie Stone.  "Or be able to keep them out of it," declar=
ed Madge Steele. "I=20

suppose we shall have to let them hang around, Helen."  "I tell you!" cried=
 Helen, who never would=20

go back upon her twin, and who liked to have him around, "we'll make some n=
ut candy. There's=20



nuts--half a bushel of them. The boys must crack and pick the nuts and we'l=
l make some walnut=20

taffy--it will be lots nicer than plain taffy."  "Oh, well, that _does_ put=
 another face upon the matter,"=20

laughed Lluella Fairfax.  "But they must all three whistle while they're pi=
cking out the nuts," cried=20

Heavy. "I know them! The nut meats will never go into the taffy pan if they=
 don't whistle."  Tom and=20

his chums agreed to this and in a few minutes they were all three sitting g=
ravely on the big settee=20

by the fire, a flatiron in each boy's lap, each with a hammer and the baske=
t of nuts in reach, and all=20

dolefully whistling--with as much discord as possible. The whistling did ce=
rtainly try the girls'=20

nerves; but the boys were not to be trusted under any other conditions.  Bu=
sy Izzy, however--that=20

arch schemer--had not forgiven the girls for laughing at his overset on the=
 toboggan slide the night=20

before. And as he sat whistling "Good Night, Ladies" in a dreadful minor, h=
e evolved such a plan=20

for reprisal in his fertile mind that his eyes began to snap and he could h=
ardly whistle for the grin=20

that wreathed his lips.  "Keep at it, Mr. Isadore Phelps!" cried Ruth, firs=
t to detect Izzy's defection.=20

"We're watching you."  "Come! aren't we going to have a chance to eat a sin=
gle kernel?" Izzy=20

growled.  "Not one," said Helen, stoutly. "After you have the nuts cracked =
and picked out, we'll=20

spread the kernels in the dripping pans, the taffy will then be ready, we'l=
l pour it over, and then set=20

the candy out to cool in the snow. After that we'll give you some--if you'r=
e good."  "Huh!" grunted=20

Isadore. "I guess I know a trick worth two of that. We'll get our share, fe=
llows," and he winked at=20

Tom and Bob.     CHAPTER XIII  SHELLS AND KERNELS   The three boys stuck to=
 their work,=20

with only a whisper or two, until there was a great bowl of nutmeats, and R=
uth pronounced the=20

quantity sufficient. Meanwhile, the taffy was boiling in the big kettle, an=
d Ruth and Jennie had=20

buttered three dripping pans. They spread the nutmeats evenly in the pans a=
nd then set the pans=20

carefully on a snowdrift outside the back door to get thoroughly cold befor=
e the taffy was poured=20

thinly over the nuts.  Everybody was on the _qui vive_ about the candy then=
. The girls couldn't=20

drive the boys out of the room. The bubbling molasses filled the great kitc=
hen with a rich odor.=20

Jennie began popping corn with which to make cornballs of the taffy that co=
uld not be run into the=20

three pans of nuts.  Isadore Phelps disappeared for possibly three minutes-=
-no longer; and the=20

girls never missed him.  At last the candy could be "spun" and Ruth pronoun=
ced it ready to pour=20

into the pans outside. Isadora said he would help--the kettle was too he de=
termined to make this=20

expedition now. It seemed the most suitable way of spending these all-impor=
tant days, before he=20

took the step beyond which he did not know what might happen to him. A more=
 serious visitor, yet=20

one more determined to see everything and to take the full advantage of all=
 he saw, never entered=20

that romantic town. He looked like a rural elder of the gravest Calvinistic=
 type as he walked, in his=20

black coat and loosely tied white neckcloth, about the lofty streets. He we=
nt to Holyrood, and=20

gazed with reverence and profound belief at the stains of Rizzio's blood. H=
e mounted up to the=20

Castle and examined Mons Meg with all the care of a historical observer. He=
 even inspected the=20

pictures in the National Collection with unbounded respect, if little knowl=
edge, and climbed the=20

Observatory on the Calton Hill. There were many spectators about the street=
s who remarked him=20

as he walked about, looking conscientiously at everything, with mingled ama=
zement and respect;=20

for his respectability, his sober curiosity, his unvarying seriousness, wer=
e remarkable enough to=20

catch an intelligent eye. But nobody suspected that Rolls's visit to Edinbu=
rgh was the solemn visit=20

of a martyr, permitting himself the indulgence of a last look at the scenes=
 that interested him most,=20

ere giving himself up to an unknown and mysterious doom.  On the morning of=
 the 24th, having=20



satisfied himself fully, he returned home. He was quite satisfied. Whatever=
 might now happen, he=20

had fulfilled his intention, and realised his dreams: nothing could take aw=
ay from him the=20

gratification thus secured. He had seen the best that earth contained, and =
now was ready for the=20

worst, whatever that might be. Great and strange sights, prodigies unknown =
to his fathers, were=20

befitting and natural objects to occupy him at this moment of fate. It was =
still early when he got=20

back: he stopped at the Tinto Station, not at that which was nearest to Dal=
rulzian, and slowly=20

making his way up by the fatal road, visited the scene of Torrance's death.=
 The lodge-keeper=20

called out to him, as he turned that way, that the road was shut up; but Ro=
lls paid no heed. He=20

clambered over the hurdles that were placed across, and soon reached the sc=
ene of the tragedy.=20

The marks of the horse's hoofs were scarcely yet obliterated, and the one f=
atal point at which the=20

terrified brute had dinted deeply into the tough clay, its last desperate a=
ttempt to hold its footing,=20

was almost as distinct as ever.  The terrible incident with which he had so=
 much to do came before=20

him with a confused perception of things he had not thought of at the time,=
 reviving, as in a dream,=20

before his very eyes. He remembered that Torrance lay with his head down th=
e stream--a point=20

which had not struck him as important; and he remembered that Lord Rintoul =
had appeared out of=20

the wood at his cry for help so quickly, that he could not have been far aw=
ay when the accident=20

took place. What special signification there might be in these facts Rolls =
was not sufficiently clear-

headed to see. But he noted them with great gravity in a little notebook, w=
hich he had bought for=20

the purpose. Then, having concluded everything, he set out solemnly on his =
way to Dunearn.  It=20

was a long walk. The autumnal afternoon closed in mists; the moon rose up o=
ut of the haze--the=20

harvest moon, with a little redness in her light. The landscape was dim in =
this mellowed vapour,=20

and everything subdued. The trees, with all their fading glories, hung stil=
l in the haze; the river=20

tinkled with a far-off sound; the lights in the cottages were blurred, and =
looked like huge vague=20

lamps in the milky air, as Rolls trudged on slowly, surely, to the place of=
 fate. It took him a long=20

time to walk there, and he did not hurry. Why should he hurry? He was sure,=
 went he ever so=20

slowly, to arrive in time. As he went along, all things that ever he had do=
ne came up into his mind.=20

His youthful extravagances--for Rolls, too, had once been young and silly; =
his gradual settling into=20

manhood; his aspirations, which he once had, like the best; his final ancho=
rage, which, if not in a=20

very exalted post, nor perhaps what he had once hoped for, was yet so respe=
ctable. Instead of the=20

long lines of trees, the hedgerows, and cottages which marked the road, it =
was his own life that=20

Rolls walked through as he went on. He thought of the old folk, his father =
and mother; he seemed=20

to see Bauby and himself and the others coming home in just such a misty au=
tumn night from=20

school. Jock, poor fellow! who had gone to sea, and had not been heard of f=
or years; Willie, who=20

'listed, and nearly broke the old mother's heart. How many shipwrecks there=
 had been among the=20

lads he once knew! Rolls felt, with a warmth of satisfaction about his hear=
t, how well it was to have=20

walked uprightly, to have "won through" the storms of life, and to have bee=
n a credit and a comfort=20

to all belonging to him. If anything was worth living for, that was. Willie=
 and Jock had both been=20

cleverer than he, poor fellows! but they had both dropped, and he had held =
on. Rolls did not want=20

to be proud; he was quite willing to say, "If it had not been for the grace=
 of God!----" but yet it gave=20

him an elevating sense of the far superior pleasure it was to conquer your =
inclinations in the days=20

of your youth, and to do well whatever might oppose. When the name of Rolls=
 was mentioned by=20

any one about Dunearn, it would always be said that two of them had done ve=
ry well--Tammas=20



and Bauby: these were the two. They had always held by one another; they ha=
d always been=20

respectable. But here Rolls stopped in his thoughts, taking a long breath. =
After this, after what was=20

going to happen, what would the folk say then? Would a veil drop after to-d=
ay upon the=20

unblemished record of his life? He had never stood before a magistrate in a=
ll his days--never seen=20

how the world looked from the inside of a prison, even as a visitor--had no=
thing to do, nothing to=20

do with that side of the world. He waved his hand, as if separating by a my=
stic line between all that=20

was doubtful or disreputable, and his own career. But now----Thus through t=
he misty darkening=20

road, with now a red gleam from a smithy, and now a softer glimmer from a c=
ottage door, and=20

anon the trees standing out of the mists, and the landscape widening about =
him, Rolls came on=20

slowly, very seriously, to Dunearn. The long tower of the Town House, which=
 had seemed to=20

threaten and call upon Lord Rintoul, was the first thing that caught the ey=
e of Rolls. The moon=20

shone upon it, making a white line of it against the cloudy sky.  Mr Monype=
nny was at dinner with=20

his family. They dined at six o'clock, which was thought a rather fashionab=
le hour, and the=20

comfortable meal was just over. Instead of wine, the good man permitted him=
self one glass of=20

toddy when the weather grew cold. He was sitting between the table and the =
fire, and his wife sat=20

on the other side giving him her company and consolation,--for Mr Monypenny=
 was somewhat low=20

and despondent. He had been moved by Sir James Montgomery's warm and sudden=
 partisanship=20

and belief of John Erskine's story; but he was a practical man himself, and=
 he could not, he=20

owned, shaking his head, take a sensational view. To tell him that there sh=
ould have been just=20

such an encounter as seemed probable--high words between two gentlemen--but=
 that they should=20

part with no harm done, and less than an hour after one of them be found ly=
ing dead at the bottom=20

of the Scaur--that was more than he could swallow in the way of a story. To=
 gain credence, there=20

should have been less or more. Let him hold his tongue altogether--a man is=
 never called upon to=20

criminate himself--or let him say all. "Then you must just give him a word,=
 my dear, to say nothing=20

about it," said Mrs Monypenny, who was anxious too. "But that's just imposs=
ible, my dear, for he=20

blurted it all out to the sheriff just as he told it to me." "Do you not th=
ink it's a sign of innocence that=20

he should keep to one story, and when it's evidently against himself, so fa=
r as it goes?" "A sign of=20

innocence!" Mr Monypenny said, with a snort of impatience. He took his todd=
y very sadly, finding=20

no exhilaration in it. "Pride will prevent him departing from his story," h=
e said. "If he had spoken=20

out like a man, and called for help like a Christian, it would have been no=
thing. All this fuss is his=20

own doing--a panic at the moment, and pride--pride now, and nothing more." =
 "If ye please," said=20

the trim maid who was Mr Monypenny's butler and footman all in one--the "ta=
ble-maid," as she=20

was called--"there's one wanting to speak to ye, sir. I've put him into the=
 office, and he says he can=20

wait."  "One! and who may the one be?" said Mr Monypenny.  "Weel, sir, he's=
 got his hat doon on=20

his brows and a comforter aboot his throat, and he looks sore for-foughten,=
 as if he had travelled=20

all the day, and no' a word to throw at a dog; but I think it's Mr Rolls, t=
he butler at Dalrulzian."=20

"Rolls!" said Mr Monypenny. "I'll go to him directly, Jeanie. That's one th=
ing off my mind. I thought=20

that old body had disappeared rather than bear witness against his master,"=
 he said, when the girl=20

had closed the door.  "But oh, if he's going to bear witness against his ma=
ster, it would have been=20

better for him to disappear," said the sympathetic wife. "Nasty body! to ea=
t folk's bread, and then=20

to get them into trouble."  "Whesht with your foolish remarks, my dear: tha=
t is clean against the=20

law, and it would have had a very bad appearance, and prejudiced the Court =
against us," Mr=20



Monypenny said as he went away. But to tell the truth, he was not glad; for=
 Rolls was one of the=20

most dangerous witnesses against his master. The agent went to his office w=
ith a darkened brow.=20

It was not well lighted, for the lamp had been turned down, and the fire wa=
s low. Rolls rose up=20

from where he had been sitting on the edge of a chair as Mr Monypenny came =
in. He had=20

unwound his comforter from his neck, and taken off his hat. His journey, an=
d his troubled thoughts,=20

and the night air, had limped and damped him; the starch was out of his tie=
, and the air of=20

conscious rectitude out of his aspect. He made a solemn but tremulous bow, =
and stood waiting till=20

the door was closed, and the man of business had thrown himself into a chai=
r. "Well, Rolls--so you=20

have come back!" Mr Monypenny said.  "Ay, sir, I've come back. I've brought=
 you the man, Mr=20

Monypenny, that did _yon_."  "Good Lord, Rolls! that did what? You take awa=
y my breath."  "I'll do=20

it more or I'm done. The man that coupit yon poor lad Tinto and his muckle =
horse ower the brae."=20

Mr Monypenny started to his feet. "Do you mean to tell me--Lord bless us, m=
an, speak out, can't=20

ye! The man that----Are ye in your senses, Rolls? And who may this man be?"=
  "You see before=20

you, sir, one that's nae better than a coward. I thought it would blow by. =
I thought the young=20

master would be cleared in a moment. There was nae ill meaning in my breast=
. I did the best I=20

could for him as soon as it was done, and lostna a moment. But my courage f=
ailed me to say it=20

was me----"  "You!" cried Monypenny, with a shout that rang through the hou=
se.  "Just me, and no=20

other; and what for no' me? Am I steel and airn, to take ill words from a m=
an that was no master of=20

mine? Ye can shut me up in your prison--I meant him no hairm--and hang me i=
f you like. I'll no' let=20

an innocent man suffer instead of me. I've come to give myself up."     CHA=
PTER XL.   "DEAR MR=20

ERSKINE,--I do not know what words to use to tell you how pained and distre=
ssed we are--I speak=20

for my mother as well as myself--to find that nothing has been done to reli=
eve you from the=20

consequence of such a ridiculous as well as unhappy mistake. We found my br=
other Robin as=20

anxious as we were, or more so, if that were possible, to set matters right=
 at once; but=20

unfortunately on the day after, the funeral took up all thoughts: and what =
other obstacles=20

intervened next day I cannot rightly tell, but something or other--I am too=
 impatient and pained to=20

inquire what--came in the way; and they tell me now that to-morrow is the d=
ay of the examination,=20

and that it is of no use now to forestall justice, which will certainly set=
 you free to-morrow. Oh, dear=20

Mr Erskine, I cannot tell you how sick and sore my heart is to think that y=
ou have been in=20

confinement (it seems too dreadful, too ludicrous, to be true), in confinem=
ent all these long days. I=20

feel too angry, too miserable, to think of it. I have been crying, as if th=
at would do you any good,=20

and rushing up and down abusing everybody. I think that in his heart Robin =
feels it more than any=20

of us: he feels the injustice, the foolishness; but still he has been to bl=
ame, and I don't know how=20

to excuse him. We have not dared to tell poor Carry--though, indeed, I need=
 not attempt to conceal=20

from you, who have seen so much, that poor Carry, though she is dreadfully =
excited and upset, is=20

not miserable, as you would expect a woman to be in her circumstances. Coul=
d it be expected?=20

But I don't know what she might do if she heard what has happened to you. S=
he might take some=20

step of her own accord, and that would be not prudent, I suppose; so we don=
't tell her. Oh, Mr=20

Erskine, did you ever think how miserable women are? I never realised it ti=
ll now. Here am I, and,=20

still more, here is my mother. She is not a child, or an incapable person, =
I hope! yet she can do=20

nothing--nothing to free you. She is as helpless as if she were a baby. It =
seems to me ridiculous=20

that Robin's opinion should be worth taking, and mine not; but that is quit=
e a different matter. My=20



mother can do nothing but persuade and plead with a boy like Robin, to do t=
hat which she herself,=20

at her age, wise as she is, good as she is, cannot do. As you are a man, yo=
u may think this of no=20

importance; and mamma says it is nature, and cannot be resisted, and smiles=
. But if you suppose=20

she does not feel it!--if she could have been your bail, or whatever it is,=
 you may be sure you=20

would not have been a single night in _that_ place! but all that we can do =
is to go down on our=20

knees to the men who have it in their power, and I, unfortunately, have not=
 been brought up to go=20

down on my knees. Forgive me for this outburst. I am so miserable to think =
where you are, and=20

why, and that I--I mean _we_--can do nothing. What can I say to you? Dear M=
r Erskine, our=20

thoughts are with you constantly. My mother sends you her love.  "EDITH."  =
       *       *       *       *=20

*  Edith felt perhaps that this was not a very prudent letter. She was not =
thinking of prudence, but=20

of relieving her own mind and comforting John Erskine, oppressed and suffer=
ing. And besides, she=20

was herself in a condition of great excitement and agitation. She had been =
brought back from=20

Tinto, she and her mother, with a purpose. Perhaps it was not said to her i=
n so many words; but it=20

was certainly conveyed to the minds of the female members of the family gen=
erally that Millefleurs=20

was at the end of his patience, and his suit must have an answer once for a=
ll. Carry had been told=20

of the proposal by her mother, and had pledged herself to say nothing again=
st it. And she had kept=20

her promise, though with difficulty, reserving to herself the power to act =
afterwards if Edith should=20

be driven to consent against her will. "Another of us shall not do it," Car=
ry said; "oh, not if I can=20

help it!" "I do not believe that Edith will do it," said Lady Lindores; "bu=
t let us not interfere--let us=20

not interfere!" Carry, therefore, closed her mouth resolutely; but as she k=
issed her sister, she could=20

not help whispering in her ear, "Remember that I will always stand by you--=
always, whatever=20

happens!" This was at Lindores, where Carry, pining to see once more the fa=
ce of the outer world=20

since it had so changed to her, drove her mother and sister in the afternoo=
n, returning home alone=20

with results which were not without importance in her life. But in the mean=
time it is Edith with=20

whom we have to do. She reached home with the sense of having a certain ord=
eal before her--

something which she had to pass through, not without pain--which would brin=
g her into direct=20

antagonism with her father, and convulse the household altogether. Even the=
 idea that she must=20

more or less vex Millefleurs distressed and excited her; for indeed she was=
 quite willing to admit=20

that she was "very fond of" Millefleurs, though it was ridiculous to think =
of him in any other capacity=20

than that of a brotherly friend. And it was at this moment she made the dis=
covery that,=20

notwithstanding the promises of Rintoul and Millefleurs, nothing had been d=
one for John. The=20

consequence was, that the letter which we have just quoted was at once an e=
xpression of=20

sympathy, very warm, and indeed impassioned--more than sympathy, indignatio=
n, wrath,=20

sentiments which were nothing less than violent--and a way of easing her ow=
n excited mind which=20

nothing else could have furnished. "I am going to write to John Erskine," s=
he said, with the=20

boldness produced by so great a crisis; and Lady Lindores had not interfere=
d. She said, "Give him=20

my love," and that was all. No claim of superior prudence, or even wisdom, =
has been made for=20

Lady Lindores. She had to do the best she could among all these imperfectio=
ns. Perhaps she=20

thought that, having expressed all her angry glowing heart to John, in the =
outflowing of=20

impassioned sympathy, the girl would be more likely, in the reaction and fe=
ar lest she had gone=20

too far, to be kind to Millefleurs; for who can gauge the ebbings and flowi=
ngs of these young=20

fantastic souls? And as for Lady Lindores's private sentiments, she would n=
ot have forced her=20



daughter a hairbreadth; and she had a good deal of pain to reconcile hersel=
f to Millefleurs's=20

somewhat absurd figure as the husband of Edith. But yet, when all is said, =
to give your child the=20

chance of being a duchess, who would not sacrifice a little? If only Edith =
could make up her mind=20

to it! Lady Lindores went no further. Nevertheless, when the important mome=
nt approached, she=20

could not help, like Carry, breathing a word in her child's ear, "Remember,=
 there is no better heart=20

in existence," she said. "A woman could not have a better man." Edith, in h=
er excitement, grasped=20

her mother's arms with her two hands; but all the answer she gave was a lit=
tle nervous laugh. She=20

had no voice to reply.  "You will remember, Millefleurs, that my daughter i=
s very young--and--and=20

shy," said Lord Lindores, on the other side. He was devoured by a desire to=
 say, "If she refuses=20

you, never mind--I will make her give in;" which indeed was what he had sai=
d in a kind of=20

paraphrase to Torrance. But Millefleurs was not the sort of person to whom =
this could be said. He=20

drew himself up a little, and puffed out his fine chest, when his future fa=
ther-in-law (as they hoped)=20

made this remark. If Edith was not as willing to have him as he was to have=
 her, she was not for=20

Millefleurs. He almost resented the interference. "I have no doubt that Lad=
y Edith and I will quite=20

understand each other--whichever way it may be," Millefleurs added with a s=
igh, which suited the=20

situation. As a matter of fact, he thought there could not be very much dou=
bt as to the reply. It was=20

not possible that they could have made him stay only to get a refusal at th=
e end--and Millefleurs=20

was well aware that the girls were very few who could find it in their hear=
ts to refuse a future=20

dukedom: besides, had it not been a friendship at first sight--an immediate=
 liking, if not love? To=20

refuse him now would be strange indeed. It was not until after dinner that =
the fated moment came.=20

Neither Lord Lindores nor Rintoul came into the drawing-room; and Lady Lind=
ores, having her=20

previous orders, left the field clear almost immediately after the entrance=
 of the little hero. There=20

was nothing accidental about it, as there generally is, or appears to be, a=
bout the scene of such=20

events. The great drawing-room, all softly lighted and warm, was never aban=
doned in this way in=20

the evening. Edith stood before the fire, clasping her hands together nervo=
usly, the light falling=20

warm upon her black dress and the gleams of reflection from its jet trimmin=
gs. They had begun to=20

talk before Lady Lindores retreated to the background to look for something=
, as she said; and=20

Millefleurs allowed the subject they were discussing to come to an end befo=
re he entered upon=20

anything more important. He concluded his little argument with the greatest=
 propriety, and then he=20

paused and cleared his throat.  "Lady Edith," he said, "you may not have no=
ticed that we are=20

alone." He folded his little hands together, and put out his chest, and mad=
e all his curves more=20

remarkable, involuntarily, as he said this. It was his way of opening a new=
 subject, and he was not=20

carried out of his way by excitement as Edith was.  She looked round breath=
lessly, and said, "Has=20

mamma gone?" with a little gasp--a mixture of agitation and shame. The sens=
e even that she was=20

false in her pretence at surprise--for did she not know what was coming?--a=
gitated her still more.=20

"Yeth," said Millefleurs, drawing out his lisp into a sort of sigh. "I have=
 asked that I might see you=20

by yourself. You will have thought, perhaps, that for me to stay here when =
the family was in--

affliction, was, to say the least, bad taste, don't you know?"  "No," said =
Edith, faltering, "I did not=20

think so; I thought----"  "That is exactly so," said Millefleurs, seriously=
. "It is a great bore, to be=20

sure; but you and I are not like two nobodies. The truth is, I had to speak=
 to your father first: it=20

seemed to be the best thing to do,--and now I have been waiting to have thi=
s chance. Lady Edith, I=20

hope you are very well aware that I am--very fond of you, don't you know? I=
 always thought we=20



were fond of one another----"  "You were quite right, Lord Millefleurs," cr=
ied Edith, nervously; "you=20

have been so nice--you have been like another brother----"  "Thanks; but it=
 was not quite in that=20

way." Here Millefleurs put out his plump hand and took hers in a soft, loos=
e clasp--a clasp which=20

was affectionate but totally unimpassioned. He patted the hand with his fin=
gers as he held it in an=20

encouraging, friendly way. "That's very pleasant; but it doesn't do, don't =
you know? People would=20

have said we were, one of us, trifling with the other. I told Lord Lindores=
 that there was not one=20

other girl in the world--that is, in this country--whom I ever could wish t=
o marry but you. He was not=20

displeased, and I have been waiting ever since to ask; don't you think we m=
ight marry, Lady=20

Edith? I should like it if you would. I hope I have not been abrupt, or any=
thing of that sort."  "Oh=20

no!--you are always considerate, always kind," cried Edith; "but, dear Lord=
 Millefleurs, listen to=20

me,--I don't think it would do----"  "No?" he said, with rather a blank air=
, suddenly pausing in the=20

soft pat of encouragement he was giving her upon the hand; but he did not d=
rop the hand, nor did=20

Edith take it from him. She had recovered her breath and her composure; her=
 heart fluttered no=20

more. The usual half laugh with which she was in the habit of talking to hi=
m came into her voice.=20

"No?" said Millefleurs. "But, indeed, I think it would do very nicely. We u=
nderstand each other very=20

well; we belong to the same _milieu_" (how pleased Lord Lindores would have=
 been to hear this,=20

and how amazed the Duke!), "and we are fond of each other. We are both youn=
g, and you are=20

extremely pretty. Dear Edith--mayn't I call you so?--I think it would do ad=
mirably, delightfully!"=20

"Certainly you may call me so," she said, with a smile; "but on the old foo=
ting, not any new one.=20

There is a difference between being fond of any one, and being--in love." E=
dith said this with a hot,=20

sudden blush; then shaking her head as if to shake that other sentiment off=
, added, by way of=20

reassuring herself, "don't you know?" with a tremulous laugh. Little Millef=
leurs's countenance grew=20

more grave. He was not in love with any passion; still he did not like to b=
e refused.  "Excuse me,=20

but I can't laugh," he said, putting down her hand; "it is too serious. I d=
o not see the difference, for=20

my part. I have always thought that falling in love was a rather vulgar way=
 of describing the matter.=20

I think we have all that is wanted for a happy marriage. If you do not love=
 me so much as I love=20

you, there is no great harm in that; it will come in time. I feel sure that=
 I should be a very good=20

husband, and you----"  "Would not be a good wife--oh no, no!" cried Edith, =
with a little shudder,=20

shrinking from him; then she turned towards him again with sudden compuncti=
on. "You must not=20

suppose it is unkindness; but think,--two people who have been like brother=
--and sister."  "The=20

only time," said Millefleurs, still more seriously, "that I ever stood in t=
his position before, it was the=20

relationship of mother and son that was suggested to me--with equal futilit=
y, if you will permit me to=20

say so;--brother and sister means little. So many people think they feel so=
, till some moment=20

undeceives them. I think I may safely say that my feelings have never--exce=
pt, perhaps, at the=20

very first--been those of a brother,--any more," he added in a parenthesis,=
 "than they were ever=20

those of a son."  What Edith said in reply was the most curious request eve=
r made perhaps by a=20

girl to the man who had just asked her to marry him. She laid her hand upon=
 his arm, and said=20

softly, "Tell me about her!" in a voice of mild coaxing, just tempered with=
 laughter. Millefleurs=20

shook his head, and relieved his plump bosom with a little sigh.  "Not at t=
his moment, dear Edith.=20

This affair must first be arranged between us. You do not mean to refuse me=
? Reflect a moment. I=20

spoke to your father more than a week ago. It was the day before the death =
of poor Mr Torrance.=20

Since then I have waited, hung up, don't you know, like Mahomet's coffin. W=
hen such a delay=20



does occur, it is generally understood in one way. When a lady means to say=
 No, it is only just to=20

say it at once--not to permit a man to commit himself, and leave him, don't=
 you know, hanging on."=20

"Dear Lord Millefleurs----"  "My name is Wilfrid," he said, with a little p=
athos; "no one ever calls me=20

by it: in this country not even my mother--calls me by my name."  "In Ameri=
ca," said Edith, boldly,=20

"you were called so by--the other lady----"  He waved his hand. "By many pe=
ople," he said; "but=20

never mind. Never by any one here. Call me Wilfrid, and I shall feel happie=
r----"  "I was going to=20

say that if you had spoken to me, I should have told you at once," Edith sa=
id. "When you=20

understand me quite, then we shall call each other anything you please. But=
 _that_ cannot be,=20

Lord Millefleurs. Indeed you must understand me. I like you very much. I sh=
ould be dreadfully=20

sorry if I thought what I am saying would really hurt you--but it will not =
after the first minute. I think=20

you ought to marry _her_----"  "Oh, there would be no hindrance there," sai=
d Millefleurs; "that was=20

quite unsuitable. I don't suppose it could ever have been. But with you," h=
e said, turning to take=20

her hand again, "dear Edith! everything is as it should be--it pleases your=
 people, and it will delight=20

mine. They will all love you; and for my part, I am=20


_
careful and the girls followed him to the door in a body when he carried ou=
t the steaming couldron.=20

"Do pour it carefully, Izzy!" cried Helen.  "If that boy spoils it, I'll ne=
ver forgive him," sighed Heavy.=20

Ruth ran out after him. But Isadore took great care in pouring the mixture =
into the pans as he had=20

been instructed, and even she had no complaint to make. He hurried back to =
the kitchen, too,=20

poured the residue of the boiled molasses upon the popcorn and they made up=
 the cornballs at=20

once.  "Come on, now," said Izzy, in a great hurry. "Give us fellows our sh=
are of the cornballs and=20

we'll beat it. We're going skating. We'll help you eat your old candy when =
we come back.  "Maybe=20

it will be all gone by that time," said Heavy, slily.  "I wish you joy of i=
t, then, Miss Smartie," returned=20

Isadore, chuckling. "Come on, fellows."  They seized their skates and ran a=
way. Isadore could=20

hardly talk for laughter; and he carried a good sized paper bag besides his=
 share of the popcorn=20

balls.  The girls "cleaned up"--for that had been the agreement with Janey =
when she let them have=20

her kitchen--and then sat down before the hall fire to make pine pillows, o=
f which they were=20

determined to take a number to Briarwood to give to their friends. Helen ha=
d bought a lot of denim=20

covers stamped and lettered with mottoes, including the ever-favorite "I Pi=
ne for Thee and=20

Likewise Balsam."  But although they were very merry around the fire, Heavy=
 could not long be=20

content. The popcorn balls disappeared like magic and the stout girl kept w=
orrying the others with=20

questions about the taffy.  "Don't you suppose that candy's cool? I declare=
! those boys might play=20

a joke on us--they might creep back and steal all three pans."  "Dear me, J=
ennie!" cried Ruth=20

Fielding. "If you are so anxious, why don't you run and bring a pan in? We'=
ll see if it's brittle=20

enough to break up."  Heavy sighed, but put down her work and arose. "It's =
always I who has to do=20

the work," she complained.  "Bring the pan in here and break the candy," ad=
vised Madge Steele.=20

"We'll have to watch you."  Heavy came back with one of the candy pans in s=
hort order, bringing a=20

hammer, too, with which to crack the brittle taffy.  "Come! we'll see how i=
t tastes; and if it's good=20

enough," she added, smiling broadly, "we won't let the boys have even a lit=
tle bit. They were mean=20

enough to go off skating without us."  She cracked up a part of the candy, =
passed the pan around=20

quickly, and popped a piece into her own mouth. In a moment she spat the ca=
ndy into the fire, with=20

a shriek, and put her hand to her jaw.  "Oh! oh! oh!" she cried.  "What's t=
he matter with you,=20

Heavy?" demanded Helen, startled.  "Oh, I've broken a tooth I believe. Oh!"=
  "Why were you so=20

greedy?" began Madge, sedately. And then, suddenly, she stopped chewing the=
 bit of candy she=20

had taken into her mouth, and a sudden flush overspread her face.  "Why, he=
re's a piece of=20

nutshell!" cried Lluella.  "How careless those boys were!" Helen added. "Th=
ey got some of the=20

shells in with the meat."  "We should have expected it," Belle cried. "They=
 never should have been=20

trusted to crack the nuts."  "Oh, girls!" gasped Ruth, who had quickly exam=
ined the candy in the=20

pan.  Her voice was tragic, and the others looked at her (all but Madge) in=
 surprise. "What have=20

those horrid boys done?" demanded Jennie Stone.  "They've spoiled it all!" =
Ruth cried. "There's=20

nothing but shells in the candy. They've ruined it!"  "Oh! oh! oh!" shrieke=
d Heavy again. "It can't be=20

true!"  "It can be, for it is!" said Madge Steele, decidedly. "Those mean b=
oys! I certainly will fix Bob=20

for that."  "And Tom!" cried Helen, almost in tears. "How could he be so me=
an?"  "I don't believe=20

Tom did it, Helen," said Ruth, slowly.  "He was just as bad as the others, =
I venture to say," Madge=20

said, sharply.  "If he is, I won't speak to him for a month!" cried his twi=
n sister. "We won't have=20

anything more to do with them while we are here--there now! Oh, how mean!" =
 "Maybe it's only=20

one pan that is this way," suggested Heavy, timidly.  They all ran out to s=
ee. The other pans were=20



just like the first one. The nut meats had been removed and shells scattere=
d in the pans instead.=20

No wonder Isadore Phelps had wanted to pour the molasses taffy!  "And they'=
ve got all the=20

meats," said Belle Tingley. "They are eating them and chuckling over the tr=
ick right now, I wager."=20

"It's a mean, mean trick!" gasped Helen, in a temper. "I never will forgive=
 Tom. And I just hate=20

those other boys."  "You're welcome to hate Bobbie," said Madge. "He deserv=
es it."  "_Such_ a=20

contemptible joke!" groaned Belle.  "Let's make some more," Ruth suggested.=
 "And we won't give=20

them any."  "No. I don't want to go all through it again," Helen said, shak=
ing her head.  At that=20

moment the telephone rang. Ruth was nearest and she jumped up and answered =
the call. At the=20

other end of the wire an excited female voice demanded:  "Is this Snow Camp=
?"  "Yes," replied=20

Ruth, "it is."  "Mr. Cameron's camp?"  "Yes. But he is not in the house jus=
t now."  "Aren't any of=20

your men-folks there?" queried the excited voice.  "I guess most of the men=
 are drawing in logs for=20

the fires," said Ruth. "What is the matter?"  "I want to warn you all to lo=
ok out for the panther. It is=20

supposed to be coming your way--towards Snow Camp. The beast has just kille=
d a pig for us, and=20

was frightened away. It's done other damage to-day among the neighbors' cat=
tle. Do you hear=20

me?"  "Oh, I hear you!" cried Ruth, and then held her hand over the mouthpi=
ece and spoke to the=20

other girls: "That panther--that catamount!" she cried. "It is supposed to =
be coming this way.=20

Where is your father, Helen? And Long Jerry Todd?"     CHAPTER XIV  A TELEP=
HONE CHASE=20

The excited screaming of the other girls brought Mrs. Murchiston to the hal=
l in a hurry. When she=20

heard what had caused the excitement she called the maids, intending to sen=
d one of them for Mr.=20

Cameron.  But just then the woman--a farmer's wife along the road--began ta=
lking to Ruth again,=20

and the maids learned from her answers into the 'phone the cause of the exc=
itement. Go out into=20

the open when the catamount might be within a couple of miles of the lodge?=
 No, indeed!  Mary=20

threw her apron over her head and sank down on the floor, threatening hyste=
rics. Janey was=20

scared both dumb and motionless. These women who had lived all their lives =
in towns, or near=20

towns, were not fit to cope with the startling incidents of the backwoods. =
 The woman on the wire=20

explained to Ruth that she was telephoning all along the line toward Scarbo=
ro, warning each=20

farmer of the big cat's approach.  "But if it keeps on in the Lady Lindores=
 as I am of you. Nothing=20

could be more jolly (to use a vulgar word--for I hate slang) than the life =
we should lead. I should=20

take you _over there_, don't you know, and show you everything, as far as S=
an Francisco if you=20

like. I know it all. And you would form my opinions, and make me good for s=
omething when we=20

came back. Come! let it be settled so," said Millefleurs, laying his other =
hand on Edith's, and=20

patting it softly. It was the gentlest fraternal affectionate clasp. The ha=
nds lay within each other=20

without a thrill in them--the young man kind as any brother, the girl in no=
wise afraid.  "Do you=20

think," said Edith, with a little solemnity, from which it cost her some tr=
ouble to keep out a laugh,=20

"that if I could consent (which I cannot: it is impossible), do you think i=
t would not be a surprise,=20

and perhaps a painful one, to--the other lady--if she heard you were coming=
 to America _so_?"=20

Lord Millefleurs raised his eyes for a moment to the ceiling, and he sighed=
. It was a tribute due to=20

other days and other hopes. "I think not," he said. "She was very disintere=
sted. Indeed she would=20

not hear of it. She said she regarded me as a mother, don't you know? There=
 is something very=20

strange in these things," he added, quickly forgetting (as appeared) his po=
sition as lover, and=20

putting Edith's hand unconsciously out of his. "There was not, you would ha=
ve supposed, any=20

chance of such feelings arising. And in point of fact it was not suitable a=
t all. Still, had she not seen=20



so very clearly what was my duty----"  "I know now," said Edith; "it was th=
e lady who--advised you=20

to come home."  He did not reply directly. "There never was anybody with su=
ch a keen eye for=20

duty," he said; "when she found out I hadn't written to my mother, don't yo=
u know, that was when=20

she pulled me up. 'Don't speak to me,' she said. She would not hear a word.=
 I was just obliged to=20

pack up. But it was perfectly unsuitable. I never could help acknowledging =
that."  "Wilfrid," said=20

Edith, half in real, half in fictitious enthusiasm,--for it served her purp=
ose so admirably that it was=20

difficult not to assume a little more than she felt--"how can you stand the=
re and tell me that there=20

was anything unsuitable in a girl who could behave so finely as that. Is it=
 because she had no=20

stupid little title in her family, for example? You have titles enough for =
half-a-dozen, I hope. Are=20

you not ashamed to speak to one girl of another like that----"  "Thank you,=
" said Millefleurs, softly,--

"thank you; you are a darling. All you say is quite true. But she is not--e=
xactly a girl. The fact is--

she is older than--my people would have liked. Of course that was a matter =
of complete=20

indifference to me."  "O--oh! of course," said Edith, faintly: this is a po=
int on which girls are not=20

sympathetic. She was very much taken aback by the intimation. But she recov=
ered her courage,=20

and said with a great deal of interest, "Tell me all about her now."  "Are =
you quite decided?" he=20

said solemnly. "Edith,--let us pause a little; don't condemn me, don't you =
know, to disappointment=20

and heartbreak, and all that, without sufficient cause. I feel sure we shou=
ld be happy together. I for=20

one would be the happiest man----"  "I could not, I could not," she cried, =
with a sudden little=20

effusion of feeling, quite unintentional. A flush of hot colour ran over he=
r, her eyes filled with tears.=20

She looked at him involuntarily, almost unconscious, with a certain appeal,=
 which she herself only=20

half understood, in her eyes. But Millefleurs understood, not at the half w=
ord, as the French say,=20

but at the half thought which he discovered in the delicate transparent sou=
l looking at him through=20

those two involuntary tears. He gazed at her for a moment with a sudden sta=
rtled enlargement of=20

his own keen little eyes. "To be sure!" he cried. "How was it I never thoug=
ht of that before?"  Edith=20

felt as if she had made some great confession, some cruel admission, she di=
d not know what. She=20

turned away from him trembling. This half comic interview suddenly turned i=
n a moment to one of=20

intense and overwhelming, almost guilty emotion. What had she owned to? Wha=
t was it he made=20

so sure of? She could not tell. But now it was that Millefleurs showed the =
perfect little gentleman=20

he was. The discovery was not entirely agreeable to his _amour propre_, and=
 wounded his pride a=20

little; but in the meantime the necessary thing was to set Edith at her eas=
e so far as was possible,=20

and make her forget that she had in any way committed herself. What he did =
was to set a chair for=20

her, with her back to the lamp, so that her countenance need not be reveale=
d for the moment, and=20

to sit down by her side with confidential calmness. "Since you wish it," he=
 said, "and are so kind as=20

to take an interest in her, there is nothing I should like so much as to te=
ll you about my dear Miss=20

Nelly Field. I should like you to be friends."  Would it were possible to d=
escribe the silent hush of=20

the house while these two talked in this preposterous manner in the solitud=
e so carefully prepared=20

for them! Lord Lindores sat breathless in his library, listening for every =
sound, fixing his eyes upon=20

his door, feeling it inconceivable that such a simple matter should take so=
 long a time to=20

accomplish. Lady Lindores in her chamber, still more anxious, foreseeing en=
dless struggles with=20

her husband if Millefleurs persevered, and almost worse, his tragical wrath=
 and displeasure if=20

Millefleurs (as was almost certain) accepted at once Edith's refusal, sat b=
y her fire in the dark, and=20

cried a little, and prayed, almost without knowing what it was that she ask=
ed of God. Not, surely,=20



that Edith should sacrifice herself? Oh no; but that all might go well--tha=
t there might be peace and=20

content. She did not dictate how that was to be. After a while both father =
and mother began to=20

raise their heads, to say to themselves that unless he had been well receiv=
ed, Millefleurs would=20

not have remained so long oblivious of the passage of time. This brought a =
smile upon Lord=20

Lindores's face. It dried his wife's eyes, and made her cease praying. Was =
it possible? Could=20

Edith, after all, have yielded to the seductions of the dukedom? Her mother=
 felt herself struck to=20

the heart by the thought, as if an arrow had gone into her. Was not she ple=
ased? It would delight=20

her husband, it would secure family peace, it would give Edith such a posit=
ion, such prospects, as=20

far exceeded the utmost hopes that could have been formed for her. Somehow,=
 however, the first=20

sensation of which Lady Lindores was conscious was a humiliation deep and b=
itter. Edith too! she=20

said to herself, with a=20


_
it last, the creature will strike Snow Camp first," declared the excited la=
dy. "You must get your men=20

out with guns and dogs to stop the beast if you can. It's mad with hunger a=
nd it will do some=20

dreadful damage if it is not killed."  Ruth repeated this to her friends, a=
nd asked Mrs. Murchiston=20

what they should do.  "If the baste comes here," cried Mary, the maid, "he =
can jump right into=20

these low winders. We'll be clawed to pieces."  "There are heavy shutters f=
or these windows," Mrs.=20

Murchiston said, faintly. "But they are to heavy for us to handle--and I su=
ppose they are stored in=20

one of the outbuildings, anyway."  "Why, I wouldn't go out of doors for a f=
ortune!" cried Lluella=20

Fairfax.  "But the creature isn't here yet," Ruth said, doubtfully.  "How d=
o you know how fast he's=20

traveling?" returned Helen, quickly.  "But think of the boys down there ska=
ting," said her chum.=20

"Oh, oh!" gasped Jennie. "If that panther eats them up they'll be more than=
 well paid for spoiling=20

our taffy."  "Hush, Jennie!" commanded Madge. "This is no time for joking. =
How are we going to=20

warn them--and the men in the woods?"  "And father?" cried Helen Cameron.  =
"Oh, I wouldn't=20

_dare_ go out!" gasped Belle Tingley.  But Ruth ran out into the big kitche=
n and opened the door.=20

The outbuildings were not far away, but not a soul appeared about them. The=
re seemed to be a=20

brooding silence over the whole place. The men were so deep in the woods th=
at she could not=20

hear a sound from them; nor was the ring of skates on the pond apparent to =
her ear.  "Come back,=20

Ruth! come back!" begged her chum, who had followed her. "Suppose that beas=
t should be hiding=20

near?"  "I don't suppose he's within a mile of the camp," said Ruth, her vo=
ice unshaken. "There are=20

all the guns in the hall--even the little shotguns. I don't suppose the men=
 have a gun with them,=20

and of course the boys have not. And both parties should be warned. I'm goi=
ng----"  "Oh, Ruth!=20

you're mad!" cried Helen. "You mustn't go."  "Who'll go, then?" demanded he=
r friend. "I guess=20

we're all equally scared--Mrs. Murchiston and all."  "Nobody will go----"  =
"I'm going!" declared Ruth,=20

firmly. "If the panther is coming from that woman's house--the woman who te=
lephoned--then the=20

pond is in the very opposite direction. I'll take Tom's rifle and some cart=
ridges."  "But you don't=20

know how to shoot!" cried Helen.  "We ought to know. It's a shame that girl=
s don't learn to handle=20

guns just like boys. I'm going to get Long Jerry Todd to show me how."  Whi=
le she spoke she had=20

run into the hall and caught up Tom's light rifle. She knew where his ammun=
ition was, too. And=20

she secured half a dozen cartridges and put them into the magazine, having =
seen Tom load the=20

gun the day before.  "You'll shoot yourself!" murmured Helen.  "I hope not,=
" returned Ruth, shaking=20

her head. "But I hope I won't have a chance to shoot the panther. I don't w=
ant to see that awful=20

beast again."  "I don't see how you dare, Ruth Fielding!" cried Helen.  "Hu=
h! It isn't because I'm not=20

afraid," admitted her chum. "But somebody must tell those boys, dear."  Rut=
h had already seized=20

her coat and sense of heart-sickness and downfall within her. She had wishe=
d it surely--she had=20

felt that to see her child a duchess would be a fine thing, a thing worth m=
aking a certain sacrifice=20

for; and Millefleurs had nothing in him to make a woman fear for her daught=
er's happiness. But=20

women, everybody knows, are inaccessible to reason. It is to be doubted whe=
ther Lady Lindores=20

had ever in her life received a blow more keen than when she made up her mi=
nd that Edith was=20

going to do the right thing, the prudent wise thing, which would secure fam=
ily peace to her mother,=20

and the most dazzling future to herself.  When a still longer interval had =
elapsed, and no one came=20

to tell her of the great decision, which evidently must have been made, Lad=
y Lindores thought it=20

best to go back to the drawing-room, in which she had left Edith and her lo=
ver. To think that Edith=20

should have found the love-talk of Millefleurs so delightful after all, as =
to have forgotten how time=20



passed, and everything but him and his conversation, made her mother smile =
once more, but not=20

very happily. When she entered the drawing-room she saw the pair at the oth=
er end of it, by the=20

fire, seated close together, he bending forward talking eagerly, she leanin=
g towards him, her face=20

full of smiles and interest. They did not draw back, or change their positi=
on, as lovers do, till Lady=20

Lindores, much marvelling, came close up to them, when Millefleurs, still t=
alking, jumped up to find=20

a chair for her. "And that was the last time we met," Millefleurs was sayin=
g, too much absorbed in=20

his narrative to give it up. "An idea of duty like that, don't you know, le=
aves nothing to be said."=20

Lady Lindores sat down, and Millefleurs stood in front of the two ladies, w=
ith his back to the fire, as=20

Englishmen love to stand. There was a pause--of extreme bewilderment on the=
 part of the new-

comer. Then Millefleurs said, in his round little mellifluous voice, foldin=
g his hands,--"I have been=20

telling dear Edith of a very great crisis in my life. She understands me pe=
rfectly, dear Lady=20

Lindores. I am very sorry to tell you that she will not marry me; but we ar=
e friends for life."=20

CHAPTER XLI.   Carry drove away from Lindores in the afternoon sunshine, le=
aning back in her=20

corner languidly watching the slanting light upon the autumnal trees, and t=
he haze in which the=20

distance was hid, soft, blue, and ethereal, full of the poetry of nature. S=
he had about her that soft=20

languor and delicious sense of freedom from pain which makes convalescence =
so sweet. She felt=20

as if she had got over a long and painful illness, and, much shattered and =
exhausted, was yet=20

getting better, in a heavenly exemption from suffering, and perfect rest. T=
his sense of recovery,=20

indeed, is very different from the languor and exhaustion of sorrow; and ye=
t without any intention=20

of hers, it veiled with a sort of innocent hypocrisy those feelings which w=
ere not in consonance=20

with her supposed desolation and the mourning of her widowhood. Her behavio=
ur was exemplary,=20

and her aspect all that it ought to be, everybody felt; and though the coun=
try-side was well aware=20

that=20


_
the former, pulled the other down upon her ears, and catching up the loaded=
 gun ran out of the=20

kitchen just before Mrs. Murchiston, who had suddenly suspected what she wa=
s about, came to=20

forbid the venture. Ruth, however, was out of the house and winging her way=
 down the cleared=20

path toward the pond, before the governess could call to her.  "Oh, she wil=
l be killed, Mrs.=20

Murchiston!" cried Helen, in tears.  "Not likely," declared that lady. "But=
 she should not have gone=20

out without my permission."  Nor was Ruth altogether as courageous as she a=
ppeared. She did=20

not suppose that the huge cat that had so frightened her and the strange bo=
y that Mr. Cameron=20

had brought up from Cheslow, was very near Snow Camp as yet. Yet she glance=
d aside as she=20

ran with expectation in her eyes, and when of a sudden something jumped in =
the bushes, she=20

almost shrieked and ran the faster.  There was a crash beside the path, the=
 bushes parted, and a=20

great, fawn-colored body leaped out into the path.  "Oh, Reno!" Ruth cried.=
 "I never _was_ so=20

frightened! You bad dog--I thought you were the cat-o'-mountain."  But imme=
diately she felt that=20

her fear was gone. Here was Tom's faithful mastiff, whose tried courage she=
 knew, and which she=20

knew would not fail her if they came face to face with the panther.  She hu=
rried on, nevertheless,=20

to the pond, to warn the boys; but to her surprise, as she approached the i=
ce, she heard nothing of=20

the truants. There was no ring of steel on the ice, nor were their voices a=
udible. When Ruth=20

Fielding reached the ice, the pond was deserted.  "Now what could have happ=
ened to them?=20

Where have they gone?" thought the girl.  She hesitated, not alone staring =
about the open pond,=20

but looking sharply on either side into the snow-mantled woods. Reno remain=
ed by her and she=20

had a hand upon his collar. Should she shout? Should she call for Tom Camer=
on and his mates?=20

If she called, and the terrible cat was within earshot, it might be attract=
ed to her by the sound.=20

"Baby!" she finally apostrophized herself. "I don't suppose that beast is a=
nywhere near. Here=20

goes!" and she raised her clear voice in a lusty shout.  There came, howeve=
r, no reply. She=20

shouted again and again, with a like result.  "Where under the sun could th=
ose boys have gone?"=20

was her unspoken question. "Could they have returned to the house by some o=
ther path?"  But=20

she did not believe this was so. Rather, she was inclined to think Tom and =
his comrades had gone=20

farther than the pond. There was a good-sized stream through which the wate=
rs of this pond=20

emptied into Rolling River. That outlet was frozen over, too, and it would =
be just like the three boys=20

to explore the frozen stream.  Ruth wished that she had brought her skates =
instead of the gun with=20

her. She felt now that the boys should indeed be warned of the roaming pant=
her, as they had gone=20

so far from the lodge. Here was Reno, too. If she told the mastiff to find =
Tom, he would doubtless=20

do so. She could even send some written word to the boys by the dog--had sh=
e a she had no=20

great reason to be inconsolable, it yet admired and respected her for appea=
ring to mourn. Her=20

fragility, her paleness, her smile of gentle exhaustion and worn-out looks,=
 did her unspeakable=20

credit with all the good people about. They were aware that she had little =
enough to mourn for, but=20

there are occasions on which nature demands hypocrisy. Any display of satis=
faction at another's=20

death is abhorrent to mankind. Carry in her convalescence was no hypocrite,=
 but she got the credit=20

of it, and was all the better thought of. People were almost grateful to he=
r for showing her husband=20

this mark of respect. After all, it is hard, indeed, when a man goes out of=
 this world without even=20

the credit of a woman's tears. But Carry had no sorrow in her heart as she =
drove away from the=20

door of her former home. It had not been thought right that she should go i=
n. A widow of not yet a=20

fortnight's standing may, indeed, drive out to get a little air, which is n=
ecessary for her health, but=20



she cannot be supposed to be able to go into a house, even if it is her fat=
her's. She was kissed=20

tenderly and comforted, as they took leave of her. "My darling Carry, Edith=
 and I will drive over to=20

see you to-morrow; and then you have the children," her mother said, hersel=
f half taken in by=20

Carry's patient smile, and more than half desirous of being taken in. "Oh y=
es, I have the children,"=20

Carry said. But in her heart she acknowledged, as she drove away, that she =
did not even want the=20

children. When one has suffered very much, the mere absence of pain becomes=
 a delicious fact, a=20

something actual, which breathes delight into the soul. Even when your back=
 aches or your head=20

aches habitually, to be free of that for half an hour is heaven; and Carry =
had the bewildering=20

happiness before her of being free of it for ever. The world bore a differe=
nt aspect for her; the air=20

blew differently, the clouds floated with another motion. To look out over =
the plain, and away to the=20

blue hills in the distance, with all their variety of slopes, and the infin=
ite sweet depths of colour and=20

atmosphere about them, was beyond all example delightful, quite enough to f=
ill life and make it=20

happy. In the heavenly silence she began to put her thoughts into words, as=
 in her youth she had=20

done always when she was deeply moved. Oh, who are they that seek pleasure =
in the world, in=20

society, in feasts and merrymakings, when it is here, at their hand, ready =
for their enjoyment? This=20

was her theme. The sunset upon the hills was enough for any one; he who cou=
ld not find his=20

happiness in that, where would he find it? Carry lay back in her corner, an=
d felt that she would like=20

to kiss the soft air that blew upon her, and send salutations to the trees =
and the sun. What could=20

any one want more? The world was so beautiful, pain had gone out of it, and=
 all the venom and=20

the misery. To rest from everything, to lie still and get better, was of it=
self too exquisite. Carry had=20

not for a long time written any of those little poems which Edith and=20


_
played message-bearer.  But the warn Tom and his companions would not be al=
l Ruth had started=20

out to do. Tom was a good shot and a steady hand, she knew. With this loade=
d rifle in his hand=20

the party might feel fit to meet the panther, if it so fell out. Without an=
y weapon even the noble=20

mastiff might prove an insufficient protection.     CHAPTER XV  THE BATTLE =
IN THE SNOW   It=20

was a fact that Ruth was tempted to run back to the house, just as fast as =
she could go, and from=20

there send Reno out to find his young master. Whether the dog could have tr=
aced Tom on the ice,=20

however, is a question, for Ruth did not yield to this cowardly suggestion.=
 She had come out with=20

the gun to find the boys, and her hesitation at the edge of the pond was on=
ly momentary.  She=20

started down the pond toward the stream, seeing the scratches of the boys' =
skates leading in that=20

direction. There could be no doubt as to where they had gone. Ruth only wis=
hed that she had=20

brought her skates when she ran so hastily from Snow Camp.  Not a sound rea=
ched her ears,=20

save the sharp twitter of a sparrow now and then, the patter of Reno's feet=
 on the ice, and the=20

rattle of the loaded rifle against the buttons of her sweater-coat. The for=
est that surrounded the=20

pond seemed uninhabited. The axes of the woodsmen did not echo here, and th=
e boys must=20

indeed be a great way off, for she could distinguish no sound whatever from=
 them.  Yet she had no=20

doubt that she was following their trail--not even when she came down to th=
e outlet of the pond.=20

The strokes of the skates upon the ice were still visible. The three boys h=
ad certainly gone down=20

the frozen stream.  "Come on, Reno!" she exclaimed aloud, encouraging herse=
lf in her duty. "We'll=20

find them yet. They certainly could not have gone clear to Rolling River--t=
hat's ten miles away!"=20

The stream was not ten yards across--nothing more than a creek. The woods a=
nd underbrush shut=20

it in closely. There was not a mark in the snow on either hand of footsteps=
--not that Ruth could=20

see. And how heavy the afternoon silence was!  Ruth had recovered in a meas=
ure from the first=20

fear she had felt of the marauding panther. The beast, had he traveled towa=
rd Snow Camp, was=20

likely miles away from the spot. She had determined to go on and find Tom a=
nd the others, more=20

that they might be warned of peril on approaching Snow Camp, than for any o=
ther reason.  And=20

she did wish, now, that Tom and the other boys would appear. She was more t=
han a mile--quite=20

two miles, indeed--from the lodge.  "I guess Mr. Cameron will call me reckl=
ess again. He=20

suggested that I was that when I followed Fred Hatfield--or whatever his na=
me was-- from the cars=20

at Emoryville. He'll surely scold me for this," thought Ruth.  She kept on =
down the stream,=20

however, and at last began to shout for her boy friends. Her clear voice ra=
ng from wall to wall of=20

the forest; but it could not have been heard far into the snowy depths on e=
ither hand. Suddenly=20

Reno growled a little, sniffed, and the hair upon his neck began to rise.  =
"Now, there's no use your=20

doing that, boy," Ruth declared, clutching the mastiff tight by the collar =
with her left hand, while she=20

balanced the rifle in her right. "If you hear them, bark! Tom will know it'=
s you, then, and your bark=20

will carry farther than my voice, I do believe."  Reno whined, and looked f=
rom side to side, sniffing=20

the keen, still air. It seemed as though he scented danger, but did not kno=
w for sure from which=20

direction it was coming.  "You're scaring me, acting so, Reno!" exclaimed R=
uth. "I wish you=20

wouldn't. I can't help feeling that the panther is right behind me somewher=
e. Oh!"  The end of her=20

soliloquy was a shriek. Something flashed through the brush clump on her le=
ft hand. Reno broke=20

into a savage barking and sprang toward the bank. But Ruth did not lose her=
 grip on his collar, and=20

her hand restrained him.  "Oh, Tom! Tom!" the girl cried.  There was anothe=
r movement in the=20

bushes. It was between Ruth and the way to the camp, had she been so foolis=
h as to try to reach=20



the house directly through the woods. But she did face up stream again, and=
 had Reno been=20

willing to accompany her she would have run as hard as ever she could in th=
at direction.  "Come,=20

Reno! Come, good dog!" she gasped, tugging at his collar. "Let it alone--we=
 must go back----"=20

Reno uttered another savage growl and sprang upon the bank. The hard packed=
 snow crunched=20

under him. There sounded a scream from the brush --a sound that Ruth knew w=
ell. The catamount=20

was really at hand--there could be no mistaking that awful cry, once having=
 heard it.  The dog=20

burst through the bushes with such a savage clamor that Ruth was indeed ter=
rified. She sprang=20

after him, however, hoping to drag him back from any affray other choice re=
aders had thought so=20

lovely. Her tears had grown too bitter for such expression--and to feel her=
self flow forth once again=20

into the sweet difficulties of verse was another delight the more. She was =
all alone, in deep weeds=20

of widowhood, and almost every voice within twenty miles had within the las=
t fortnight more than=20

once uttered the words "Poor Lady Car!" but oh, how far from poor she felt =
herself! In what=20

exquisite repose and peace was she mending of all her troubles!  Sometimes =
she would ask=20

herself, with a wonder which enhanced the sweetness, Was it really all over=
--all over--come to an=20

end, this nightmare which had blotted out heaven and earth? Was it possible=
? never to come back=20

to her again round any corner, never to have any more power over her. Hence=
forward to be alone,=20

alone--what word of joy! It is a word which has different meanings to diffe=
rent people. To many in=20

Carry's position it is the very knell of their lives--to her there was a mu=
sic in it beyond the power of=20

words to say. Her weakness had brought that misery on herself: and now, was=
 it possible that she=20

was to fare so much better than she deserved, to get rid of it for ever? Sh=
e drew a long breath,=20

and imagined how different things might have been: she might have lived to =
be an old woman=20

under that yoke; she might never have got free--her mind, nor her imaginati=
on, nor her life. She=20

shuddered to think what might have been. But it was over, ended, finished, =
and she was free--

done with it for ever. She had not deserved this; it was a happiness which =
it was scarcely possible=20

to realise. Poor Carry, futile even in her anticipations of relief! It neve=
r occurred to her that the two=20

little children to whom she was returning--now all her own, she was so fool=
ish as to think--were=20

pieces of Torrance, not done with, never to be done with as long as her lif=
e lasted; but she was as=20

unconscious of that, as incapable of thinking of any harm to come from thos=
e round-faced, stolid=20

babies, as--any other mother could be.  Thus she was driving along, very ha=
ppy, very still,=20

exhausted and languid and convalescent, with all the beautiful world before=
 her, full of consolation=20

and peace, when Trouble set out to meet her upon her way. Poor Lady Car! sh=
e had suffered so=20

much,--did not life owe her a little quiet, a breathing moment--long enough=
 to get better in--quite=20

better, as we say in Scotland--and get the good of her deliverance? Indeed =
it seemed so: but to=20

different souls different experiences. Some would have escaped, would have =
gone on softly, never=20

quite getting over the dismal preface of their life to the sight of spectat=
ors, but in reality tasting the=20

sweetness of repose--till the inevitable moment came, as it does to all, wh=
en the warfare has to be=20

taken up again. But to Carry there was left no interval at all. She so deli=
cate, so sensitive, all her=20

nerves so highly strung, quiet would have been everything for her. But quie=
t she was not to have.=20

Trouble set out from the gate of Dalrulzian while she rolled softly along t=
o meet it, unconscious,=20

thinking of nothing which could justify that sudden apparition--not a feeli=
ng in her going out=20

towards it, or provoking the sight. The trouble which thus approached Lady =
Car was in the shape=20

of Edward Beaufort, his tall figure slightly stooping, yet in the full vigo=
ur of manhood, his=20



countenance gently despondent, a habitual sigh hanging, as it were, about h=
im; the ends of his=20

luxuriant beard lightly moved by the breeze. He walked somewhat slowly, mus=
ing, with nothing=20

particular to do, and Carry caught sight of him for some time before they m=
et. She gave a low cry=20

and sat upright. Her convalescent heart lying so still, so sweetly silent a=
nd even in its gentle=20

beatings, like a creature that had been hurt, and was coming softly to itse=
lf, leaped up with a=20

bound and spring, and began to go again like a wild thing, leaping, palpita=
ting, pulling at its leash.=20

The first movement was terror--for though her tyrant was gone, the traditio=
n of him was still upon=20

her, and she could not get rid of the instinct all at once. "My God!" she s=
aid to herself in the=20

silence, clasping her hands, "Edward!" with something of the wild passion o=
f alarm which John=20

Erskine had once seen. But then all in a moment again this terror subsided.=
 Her sense of=20

convalescence and repose flew away like the wind. A wild flood of joy and h=
appiness rushed into=20

her heart. "Edward!"--for the first time, feeling herself carried away by a=
 drowning and dazzling tide=20

of life, which blinded and almost suffocated her, Carry realised in one mom=
ent what it meant to be=20

free. The effect was too tremendous for any thought of prudence, any hesita=
tion as to what his=20

sentiments might be, or what was suitable=20


_
if anything happened to his brave and beautiful Reno?  It was past the girl=
's power, however, to=20

stay the mastiff. With angry barks he broke through the barrier and entered=
 a small glade not a=20

stone's throw from the bank of the stream. Before Ruth reached this cleared=
 place she saw the=20

tracks of the beast which had so startled her. There could be no mistaking =
the round impressions=20

of the great, padded paws. Unlike the print of the bear, or the dog, that o=
f the cat shows no marks=20

of claws unless it be springing at its prey.  And now, when Reno burst into=
 the open, the panther=20

uttered another fierce and blood-chilling scream. Ruth noted the flash of t=
he great, lithe body as=20

the beast sprang into the air. Startled for the moment by the on-rush and s=
avage baying of the=20

dog, the panther had leaped into a low-branching cedar. The tree shook to i=
ts very tip, and to the=20

ends of its great limbs. There the panther crouched upon a limb, its eyes b=
alefully glaring down=20

upon the leaping, growling mastiff.  As Ruth remembered the creature from t=
he time of her=20

dreadful ride on the timber cart with the so-called Fred Hatfield, it displ=
ayed a temper and ferocity=20

that was not to be mistaken. Reno's sudden onslaught was all that had drive=
n it to leap into the=20

tree. But there it crouched, squalling and tearing the hard wood into splin=
ters with its unsheathed=20

claws. In a moment it would leap down upon the dog, and She called to the c=
oachman to stop, not=20

knowing what she did, and with her head and her hands stretched out from th=
e window, met him=20

as he came up.  For the first moment there was not a word said between them=
, in the excess of=20

emotion, he standing below, she looking out from above, her white face surr=
ounded by the=20

widow's livery of woe, but suddenly flushed and glowing with life and love,=
 and a kind of=20

triumphant ecstasy. She had forgotten what it meant--she had not realised a=
ll that was in it; and=20

now it burst upon her. She could not think, scarcely breathe--but held out =
her hands to him, with=20

that look beyond words to describe. And he took them in the same way, and b=
ent down his face=20

over them, silent, not saying a word. The coachman and footman on the box t=
hought it was excess=20

of feeling that made this meeting so silent. They were sorry for their mist=
ress, who was not yet=20

able to meet any one with composure; and the low brief conversation that fo=
llowed, sounded to=20

them like condolence and sympathy. How astounded the men would have been, a=
nd the still=20

landscape around them, with its houses hidden in the trees, and all its sil=
ent observers about, had=20

they known what this colloquy actually was.  "Edward!" was the first word t=
hat was said--and then=20

"Carry! Carry! but I ought not to call you so."  "Oh, never call me anythin=
g else," she cried; "I could=20

not endure another name from you. Oh, can you=20


_
"Oh, Reno! Good dog!" she moaned. "Come back! come back!"  The mastiff woul=
d not obey and in=20

a moment the huge cat sprang out of the tree directly upon Tom Cameron's fa=
ithful companion.=20

Reno was too sharp to be easily caught, however; he leaped aside and the sa=
bre-like claws of the=20

panther missed him. Nor was the dog unwise enough to meet the panther face =
to face.  He sprang=20

in and bit the cat shrewdly, and then got away before the beast wheeled, ye=
lling, to strike him.=20

Round and round in the snow they went, so fast that it was impossible for R=
uth to see which was=20

dog and which was cat, their paws throwing up a cloud of snow-dust that alm=
ost hid the=20

combatants.  "Ah!" cried Ruth, aloud. "I've missed my chance, I should have=
 have paid for it--

bitterly, bitterly! And it was not my fault."  "I never blamed you. I have =
forgiven you always. My=20

suffering is not older than my forgiveness."  "You were always better than =
I;" and then she added=20

eagerly, not pausing to think, carried on by that new tide that had caught =
her, "it is over; it is all=20

over now."  It was on his lips to say Thank God--but he reflected, and did =
not say it. He had held=20

her hands all the time. There was nobody to see them, and the servants on t=
he box were=20

sympathetic and silent. Then he asked, "Will they let me go to you now?"  "=
You will not ask any=20

leave," she said hastily--"no leave! There are so many things I have to say=
 to you--to ask your=20

pardon. It has been on my heart to ask=20


_
to shoot the creature while it was in the tree."  And that seemed true enou=
gh. For had she been=20

the best of shots with the rifle, it looked now as though she was as likely=
 to shoot Reno as the=20

panther whilst they battled in the snow.     CHAPTER XVI  AN APPEARANCE AND=
 A=20

done that, I could die."  "No dying now," he said, with her hands in his.  =
"Ah," she cried, with a little=20

shudder, "but it is by dying I am here."  He looked at her pitifully with a=
 gaze of sympathy. He was=20

prepared to be sorry if she was sorry. Even over his rival's death Edward B=
eaufort felt himself=20

capable of dropping a tear. He could go so far=20
