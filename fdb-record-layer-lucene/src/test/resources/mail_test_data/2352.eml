each eye. And down what Dinky-Dunk once called the honeyed corners of my mouth went another 

pair of lines which clearly came from too much laughing. But most unmistakably of all there was a 

line coming under my chin, a small but tell-tale line, announcing the fact that I wasn't losing any in 

weight, and standing, I suppose, one of the foot-hills which precede the Rocky-Mountain dewlaps 

of old age. It wouldn't be long, I could see, before I'd have to start watching my diet, and looking 

for a white hair or two, and probably give up horseback riding. And then settle down into an ingle-

nook old dowager with a hassock under _my_ feet and a creak in my knees and a fixed conviction 

that young folks never acted up in _my_ youth as they act up nowadays.  I tried to laugh it away, 

but my heart went down like a dredge-dipper. Whereupon I set my jaw, which didn't make me look 

any younger. But I didn't much care, for the mirror had already done its worst.  "Not muchee!" I 

said as I sat there making faces at myself. "You're still one of the living. The bloom may be off in a 

place or two, but you're sound to the core, and serviceable for many a year. So _sursum corda! 

'Rung ho! Hira Singh!_' as Chinkie taught us to shout in the old polo days. And that means, Go in 

and win, Chaddie McKail, and die with your boots on if you have to."  I was still intent on that study 

of my robust-looking but slightly weather-beaten map when Dinky-Dunk walked in and caught me 

in the middle of my Narcissus act.  "'All is vanity saith the Preacher,'" he began. But he stopped 

short when I swung about at him. For I hadn't, after all, been able to carpenter together even a 

whale-boat of consolation out of my wrecked schooner of hope.  "Oh, Kakaibod," I wailed, "I'm a 

pie-faced old has-been, and nobody will ever love me again!"  He only laughed, on his way out, 

and announced that I seemed to be getting my share of loving, as things went. But he didn't take 

back what he said about me being withered. And the first thing I shall do to-morrow, when 

Gershom comes down to breakfast, will be to ask him how old Cleopatra was when she brought 

Antony to his knees and how antiquated Ninon D'Enclos was when she lost her power over that 

semi-civilized creature known as Man. Gershom will know, for Gershom knows everything. 

according to her own account belonging partly to other people; among other things, of a collection 

of pictures to make room for which, as she said, she had been obliged to send away her son, who 

was missing at that critical juncture. The duty was a harsh one, but seems, by Mrs. Gordon's own 

account, not to have been harshly performed. If any property that ought to have been restored was 

kept, it was kept not by Wolfe but by "Hangman Hawley." Still one could wish to see Wolfe fighting 

on a brighter field than Culloden, and engaged in a work more befitting a soldier than the ruthless 

extirpation of rebellion which ensued.  The young soldier is now thoroughly in love with his 

profession. "A battle gained," he says, "is, I believe the highest joy mankind is capable of receiving 

to him who commands; and his merit must be equal to his success if it works no change to his 

disadvantage." He dilates on the value of war as a school of character. "We have all our passions 

and affections roused and exercised, many of which must have wanted their proper employment 

had not suitable occasions obliged us to exert them. Few men are acquainted with the degrees of 

their own courage till danger prove them, and are seldom justly informed how far the love of 

honour and dread of shame are superior to the love of life." But now peace comes, the sword is 

consigned to rust, and in promotion Patronage resumes its sway. "In these cooler times the 

parliamentary interest and weight of particular families annihilate all other pretensions." The 

consequence was, of course, that when the hotter times returned they found the army officered by 

fine gentlemen, and its path, as Napier says, was like that of Satan in "Paradise Lost" through 



chaos to death.  Wolfe would fain have gone abroad (England affording no schools) to complete 

his military and general education; but the Duke of Cumberland's only notion of military education 

was drill; so Wolfe had to remain with his regiment. It was quartered in Scotland, and besides the 

cankering inaction to which the gallant spirit was condemned, Scotch quarters were not pleasant 

in those days. The country was socially as far from London as Norway. The houses were small, 

dirty, unventilated, devoid of any kind of comfort; and habits and manners were not much better 

than the

Gershom has been studying some of my carbon-prints. He can't for the life of him understand why 

I consider Dewing's _Old-fashioned Gown_ so beautiful, or why I should love Childe Hassam's 

_Church at Old Lyme_ or see anything remarkable about Metcalf's _May Night_. But I cherish 

them as one cherishes photographs of lost friends.  A couple of the Horatio Walker's, he 

acknowledged, seemed to mean something to him. But Gershom's still in the era when he 

demands a story in the picture and could approach Monet and Degas only by way of Meissonier 

and Bouguereau. And a print, after all, is only a print. He's slightly ashamed to admire beauty as 

mere beauty, contending that at the core of all such things there should be a moral. So we pow-

wowed for an hour and more over the threadbare old theme and the most I could get out of 

Gershom was that the lady in _The Old-fashioned Gown_ reminded him of me, only I was more 

vital. But all that talk about landscape and composition and line and tone made me momentarily 

homesick for a glimpse of Old Lyme again, before I go to my reward.  But the mood didn't last. 

And I no longer regret what's lost. I don't know what mysterious Divide it is I have crossed over, 

but it seems to be peace I want now instead of experience. I'm no longer envious of the those 

days through an unfavourable medium, at all events he did not find it charming. "The men here," 

he writes from Glasgow, "are civil, designing, and treacherous, with their immediate interest 

always in view; they pursue trade with warmth and a necessary mercantile spirit, arising from the 

baseness of their other qualifications. The women coarse, cold and cunning, for ever enquiring 

after men's circumstances; they make that the standing of their good breeding." Even the sermons 

failed to please. "I do several things in my character of commanding officer which I should never 

think of in any other; for instance, I'm every Sunday at the Kirk, an example justly to be admired. I 

would not lose two hours of a day if it would not answer some end. When I say 'lose two hours,' I 

must complain to you that the generality of Scotch preachers are excessive blockheads, so truly 

and obstinately dull, that they seem to shut out knowledge at every entrance." If Glasgow and 

Perth were bad, still worse were dreary Banff and barbarous Inverness. The Scotch burghers, their 

ladies, and the preachers are entitled to the benefit of the remark that the Scotch climate greatly 

affected Wolfe's sensitive frame, and that he took a wrong though established method of keeping 

out the cold and damp. When

life. The lights may be shining bright on many a board-walk, at this moment, but it means little to 

this ranch-lady. What I want now is a better working-plan for that which has already been placed 

before me. Often and often, in the old days, when I realized how far away from the world this 

lonely little action to lift the soul above the clay his spirits, as he admits rise and fall with the 

weather and his impressions vary with them. "I'm sorry to say that my writings are greatly 

influenced by the state of my body or mind at the time of writing and I'm either happy or ruined by

stood, I used to nurse a ghostly envy for the busier tideways of life from which we were banished. I 

used to feel that grandeur was in some way escaping me. I could picture what was taking place in 

some of those golden-gray old cities I had known: The Gardens of the Luxembourg when the 

horse-chestnuts were coming out in bloom, and the Chateau de Madrid in the Bois at the luncheon 

hour, or the Pre Catalan on a Sunday with heavenly sole in lemon and melted butter and a still 

more heavenly waltz as you sat eating _fraises des bois_ smothered in the mortal frame subject 

to."  Inverness was the climax of discomfort, coarseness and dulness, as well as a centre of 

disaffection. Quarters there in those days must have been something like quarters in an Indian 

village, with the Scotch climate superadded. The houses were hovels, worse and more fetid than 

those at Perth. Even when it was fine there was no amusement but shooting woodcocks at the risk 

of rheumatism. When the rains poured down and the roads were broken up there was no society, 

not even a newspaper, nothing to be done but to
