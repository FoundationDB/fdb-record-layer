disposal of the chief executive. As a humorist he was on a par with the inm=
ate who imagines that=20

his cell is full of ghosts. Every now and then this man proceeds to drive o=
ut these unwelcome=20

intruders, and swears at them roundly. He becomes very noisy during this dr=
iving out process and=20

the night guards frequently command him to desist. When assured that the gh=
osts are all out of his=20

cell he remains quiet the rest of the evening. These spells occur frequentl=
y, and there is little=20

question but that the man really believes that ghosts are in his cell.     =
                             PRISON=20

HUMOR.   Several years ago there was an inmate in the Stillwater penitentia=
ry who unconsciously=20

perpetrated one of the best jokes that had been heard at the institution fo=
r some time. He was a=20

German and a hard-working carpenter by trade. He was honest to a fault and =
led a model life=20

while on the outside. The crime for which he was sentenced was assault on a=
 fellow workman, and=20

for this offense he received a two-year sentence at the Stillwater penitent=
iary. He was immediately=20

put to work for the Minnesota Thresher Co., being assigned work in one of t=
he carpenter shops.=20

One day he forgot to take his plug of chewing tobacco with him to the shop,=
 having left it laying on=20

the small table in his cell. That evening when he came in from work he foun=
d the plug of tobacco=20

missing. He at once began calling for one of the night guards, and on that =
gentleman's arrival the=20

prisoner remarked:  "Say, Mr. Guard, dere must pe thieves in dis here blace=
. Mine tobacco's she=20

was gone, und I harms noboddies. I dink be warm and dry, where no external =
Air is admitted, that=20

it may ferment or work duly, for that is a material point. If it be otherwi=
se disposed, so that it stands=20

in a place which is subject to Heats and Cold, the Ferment will stop upon C=
old, or be too violent=20

upon Heats; but in cold Weather put some Straw about it. See more of the wo=
rking of Liquors in=20

_March_, in the Article of Brewing, and likewise take care that your Bottle=
s are dry when you bottle=20

your Wine, and that you have good Corks; take care likewise that your Wine =
be clear before you=20

bottle it, or it will be good for nothing. If this Wine be rightly managed =
according to the above=20

Directions, it will be fit for drinking after it has been bottled a Month. =
 In the making of white Elder-

Wine, there is no difference if you make it with Raisins; but it is much th=
e best, in my Opinion, if=20

you make it with Sugar after the following manner: only it is to be conside=
r'd, that white Elder-

Berries are yet very scarce, and there must be more of them used in the Sug=
ar Wine than in the=20

Raisin Wine.    To make white Elder-Wine, or red Elder-Wine, with Sugar.  G=
ather the Elder-

Berries ripe and dry, pick them, bruise them with your Hands, and strain th=
em; then set the Liquor=20

by in glaz'd earthen Vessels for twelve hours to settle, then put to every =
pint of Juice a pint and=20

half of Water, and to every Gallon of this Liquor put three Pounds of _Lisb=
on_ Sugar: set this in a=20

Kettle over the Fire, and when it is ready to boil, clarify it with the Whi=
tes of four or five Eggs; let it=20

boil an hour, and when it is almost cold, work it with=20


_
bolicemans und catch sum uf dem rascals."  The foregoing story is absolutel=
y authentic, and was=20

told again and again by the prisoners who appreciate a good joke as keenly =
as their free brothers.=20

It also brings out rather forcibly the fact that, notwithstanding the man w=
as in prison, he was still=20

honest.           it, filling up the Vessel from time to time with the same=
 Liquor saved on purpose, as=20

it sinks by working. In a Month's time, if the Vessel holds about eight Gal=
lons, it will be fine and fit=20

to bottle, and after bottling, will be fit to drink in two Months: but reme=
mber, that all Liquors must=20

be fine before they=20
