Similarly, persons removed from cold countries to hot cannot endure it but waste away; whereas 

those who pass from hot places to the cold regions of the north, not only do not suffer in health 

from the change of residence but even gain by it.  5. It appears, then, that in founding towns we 

must beware of districts from which hot winds can spread abroad over the inhabitants. For while 

all bodies are "for mine have been pretty idle for more than a week."  "I wish," exclaimed another, 

with a bitter curse on mankind in general, "that the whole Thames would go a-fire, from 

Westminster to Gravesend."  The energy with which this was said caused a general laugh and a 

good deal of chaff, but there was no humour in the man who spoke.  He was one of those of whom

natural temperament which make up the natures of all the different animals of the world, each after 

its kind.  6. Therefore, if one of these elements, heat, becomes predominant in any body 

whatsoever, it destroys and dissolves all the others with its violence. This defect may be due to 

violent heat from certain quarters of the sky, pouring into the open pores in too great proportion to 

admit of a mixture suited to the natural temperament of the body in question. Again, if too much 

moisture enters the channels of a body, and thus introduces disproportion, the other hundreds of 

such may be seen day by day, year by year, waiting at the different gates of the docks, in stolid 

weariness, for the chance of a day's work--the wage of which is half-a-crown.  When a foreman 

comes to a gate to take on a few such hands, the press of men, and the faces, hungry and eager 

beyond description, make one of the saddest of the sad sights to be seen even at the east end of 

London.  In another part of the crowd, where the street was narrow, a scene of a most fearful kind 

was being enacted.  All scoundreldom appeared to have collected in that spot.  For two or three 

hours robbery and violence reigned unchecked in the very face of the police,
