dracaena marginata  MRS. ALVING. What do you mean by "really responsible pe=

sitions that one cannot help attaching some weight to their opinions.  MRS.=

 preserve communications and hold western Tennessee; the three other corps =

MANDERS. And here you have the Bank Account of the capital lying at interes=
t to cover the=20

current expenses of the Orphanage.  MRS. ALVING. Thank you; but please keep=
 it--it will be more=20

convenient.  MANDERS. With pleasure. I think we will leave the money in the=
 Bank for the=20

present. The interest is certainly not what we could wish--four per cent. a=
nd six months' notice of=20

withdrawal. If a good mortgage could be found later on--of course it must b=
e a first mortgage and=20

an unimpeachable security--then we could consider the matter.  MRS. ALVING.=
 Certainly, my dear=20

Pastor Manders. You are the best judge in these things.  MANDERS. I will ke=
ep my eyes open at=20

any rate.--But now there is one thing more which I have several times been =
intending to ask you.=20

MRS. ALVING. And what is that?  MANDERS. Shall the Orphanage buildings be i=
nsured or not?=20

MRS. ALVING. Of course they must be insured.  MANDERS. Well, wait a moment,=
 Mrs. Alving.=20

Let us look into the matter a little more closely.  MRS. ALVING. I have eve=
rything insured;=20

buildings and movables and stock and crops.  MANDERS. Of course you have--o=
n your own=20

estate. And so have I--of course. But here, you see, it is quite another ma=
tter. The Orphanage is to=20

be consecrated, as it were, to a higher purpose.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, but tha=
t's no reason--  the=20

region south of the city appeared quite beyond reach, since the batteries c=
losed the river, which=20

seemed the sole means of approach for Northern forces. The surest approach =
to the stronghold=20

was from the east; but there Grant had tried and failed; public sentiment w=
ould not sustain another=20

movement from that side. There was nothing for it but to try by the north a=
nd west, and Grant=20

grappled with the problem.  Besides the natural obstacles, he had to take a=
ccount of his own=20

forces, and the strength and character of his adversary. In November, 1862,=
 Johnston, not yet=20

recovered from the wounds received at Fair Oaks in May, was ordered to assu=
me command in the=20

West, taking the troops of Kirby Smith, Bragg, and the army defending the M=
ississippi. The latter=20

force, up to that time under Van Dorn, was transferred to John C. Pemberton=
, of an old=20

Pennsylvania family, before and after the war a citizen of Philadelphia. Th=
ough a Northerner, he=20

had the entire confidence of both Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee. His re=
cord in the old army=20

was good; he was made lieutenant-general by the Confederacy, and received m=
ost weighty=20

responsibilities. He served bravely and faithfully the cause he had espouse=
d; though outclassed in=20

his campaign, he did not lack ability. Pemberton commanded some fifty thous=
and=20


_
impropriety in guarding against all contingencies--  MRS. ALVING. No, I sho=
uld think not.=20

MANDERS. But what is the general feeling in the neighbourhood? You, of cour=
se, know better=20

than I.  MRS. ALVING. Well--the general feeling--  MANDERS. Is there any co=
nsiderable number=20

of people--really responsible people--who might be that of Port Hudson and =
detachments posted=20

in northern Mississippi. On the watch at such a point as Jackson, the state=
 capital, he could, on=20

short notice, concentrate his scattered command to meet whatever danger mig=
ht threaten.=20

Against this alert adversary Grant could now oppose about an equal number o=
