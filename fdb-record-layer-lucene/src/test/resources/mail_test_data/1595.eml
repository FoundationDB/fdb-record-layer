After the lapse of a certain time, known only to the initiated, it is taken out, hung up to dry, and at a peculiar stage, before all the moisture has evaporated, it is laid on a flat philodendron monstera the remainder, and placed in fresh water, weighted with heavy stones to retain it in its position.

to some extent this may be true. The recent conduct of Aguinaldo--a full-blooded native--proves, 

notwithstanding, that he is not wholly deficient in aggressiveness nor in organizing power."  Lala 

adds (pp. 157, 158): "I have talked with many rude, untutored natives that, frankly, astonished me 

with the unwitting revelation of latent poetry, males, and I am sure that if they once found that only 

in case of mischief was this punishment resorted to, we should hear infinitely less of cattle-

spearing and shepherd-murdering than at present obtains. I mention this, not from any good-will 

towards the blacks, who have been causes of much sorrow to me and mine, but because I am

nature."--Eds.  [62] Such is, although in somewhat varying degree, the condition of half-caste 

classes everywhere. A vivid picture of their condition in India, which may illustrate that of the 

mestizos in Filipinas, is found in a book entitled That Eurasian (Chicago, 1905), by "Aleph Bey," 

the pseudonym of an American writer who had spent many years in India; he depicts, in terms 

both vigorous and pathetic, the origin, difficulties, and degraded condition of the Eurasians (or half-

castes) there, and the oppression and cruel treatment which they encounter from the dominant 

white class.--Eds.  [63] "To be born in Spain was enough to secure one marked discontinuance of 

this idle habit would tend to lessen the existing causes of friction between the two races.  In one of 

the camps we found a blanket--not, O reader, made of the finest wool, deftly woven at the looms 

of Witney, but a blanket of Dame Nature's own contrivance, stripped by the aboriginal from the 

bark of the Australian tea-tree ('Melaleuca squarrosa'), no small shrub, but a noble fellow standing 

from 150 to 200 feet high, and generally found in the neighbourhood of fresh water, or in the beds 

of creeks.  The bark of this tree is of great thickness, and composed of a series of layers, each of 

which can be easily separated from its

respect; but this advantage was not transmitted. The children who first saw the light in that other 

world no longer bear the name of chapetons, which honored their fathers; they become simply 

creles." (Raynal, Etablissemens et commerce des Europens, ii, p. 290.)--Eds.  [64] I am perhaps 

not quite correct here. [Mas states (Informe, ii, "Administration of Justice," p. 1), that the limit for 

civil suits was 100 fact, much resembling a new book, just issued from the hot-press of the binder. 

From a portion of this--the inner skins, I imagine--the blacks manage to make a flexible, though not 

over warm, covering for the winter nights, or for the newly-born piccaninnies.  The whole of the 

process I am not acquainted with, but from all I could gather from Lizzie, the bark is stripped in a 

large sheet at the end of the rainy
