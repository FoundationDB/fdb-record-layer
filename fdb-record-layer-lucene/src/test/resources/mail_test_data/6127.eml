night in, her spirits gave way. She uttered one heart-rending shriek, swoon=
ed, and was carried=20

down from the dock--senseless.  Mrs. Green narrated circumstantially to Mr.=
 Green what had=20

taken place in court that afternoon, with a minute exactness, as he sipped =
his wine after dinner. As=20

she did so, I believe he half repented the prosecution of this poor girl, a=
lthough not a shadow of a=20

doubt rested upon his mind as to her guilt. He said he thought it was a pit=
y she had not confessed.=20

As the hours rolled on, and bedtime approached, and he was about entering t=
he solemnity of=20

night--when, I am inclined to think, men's better thoughts usually gain the=
 ascendency (that is,=20

unless the thinker be _intent_ on the perpetration of crime)--he confessed =
that he did not know=20

what to do; that he thought the poor girl ought to have an attorney employe=
d for her; and that he=20

would see his lawyer about it in the morning.  Next morning after having pe=
rused his letters, Mr.=20

Green went to consult Mr. Scrowle, his private solicitor, about the engagem=
ent of some other=20

attorney for the defence of the girl. Mr. Scrowle, however, put rather a ne=
w complexion on the=20

affair. When he heard the previous good character of the accused; when he w=
as informed of her=20

solemn protestations of innocence in the house; when it transpired that the=
 boy had run for a=20

policeman with such pleasant, not to say indecent, haste; and was told that=
 the magistrate was=20

impressed by the girl's declaration of innocence,--Mr. Scrowle suggested to=
 his client, Mr. Green,=20

that his servant had possibly been the victim of what is called by thieves =
a "plant;" that one of the=20

servants (perhaps that boy) might have been the thief, and might have place=
d the things in the=20

girl's box for the purpose of directing suspicion upon her. Mr. Green did n=
ot think it likely that his=20

attorney was correct, because of the difficulty the boy would have in getti=
ng at the room from=20

which the trinkets were taken; but his lawyer, in reply, said he did not th=
ink much of such an=20

argument, because thieves found opportunities of getting what they wanted u=
nder the most=20

adverse or difficult circumstances. The attorney then suggested that Mr. Gr=
een might possibly get=20

into trouble over the matter himself.  Many reasons, but particularly the l=
ast reason, inclined Mr.=20

Scrowle to endorse the suggestion of his client, that the girl should be pr=
ovided with legal=20

assistance, procured at the cost of the prosecutor; and, when this point ov=
erloading, and the first,=20

in fifteen years had not, out of a large fleet of steamers, lost a single v=
essel, although they made=20

from fifty to seventy double trips per year. The second case deserves parti=
cular mention. About=20

the year 1860, the firm of Anthony Gibbs & Co., of London, took a contract =
from the Peruvian=20

Government to charter and load ships from the Chincha Islands with guano, a=
nd as many as three=20

or four hundred ships left those islands annually for different parts of th=
e world. At first they were=20

allowed to load and proceed to sea without inspection or surveying, and wer=
e permitted to load as=20

deeply as the masters thought fit. What was the result? Accidents and losse=
s were reported every=20

few days, and many of their ships foundered at sea, some with all hands on =
board. When the head=20

of the house at Lima, Peru, introduced proper surveying before loading, to =
discover what repairs=20

were needed, etc., allowing no overloading, and not permitting the ships to=
 go to sea without full=20

inspection of her pumps and gear, a sudden and wonderful change took place,=
 and for years after=20

not one of these ships foundered at sea.  There is no sadder record than th=
at which has been=20

made of many a gallant vessel, sailing with the best prospects--=E2=80=9CMi=
ssing,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CNever heard of.=E2=80=9D=20

Occasionally the mysterious fate of some of these vessels has been revealed=
 by the picking up of=20

sealed bottles containing brief records of the disastrous end of the missin=
g ships. But such cases=20

are rare in comparison with the vast majority of the disasters; for the gre=
atest peril to a vessel in a=20



storm is the vicinity of a reef or shoal. In the open sea there is comparat=
ive safety, even in a=20

considerable gale, for good seamen; but a shoal or rocky coast may be fatal=
 to the vessel striking,=20

even though the wind be but moderate. So nearly all disasters occur along s=
hore; and the time is=20

past in which it is possible for a vessel to be lost on an unknown or uninh=
abited coast. Hence,=20

soon or late, the lot of nearly every vessel is known. Occasionally a vesse=
l has been abandoned=20

as unseaworthy or unmanageable, and has surprised those abandoning her by d=
rifting around for=20

months in the path of other vessels and occasionally fouling with some of t=
hem, to their serious=20

injury.  [Illustration: WRECKED ON A ROCK.]  The polar seas present peculia=
r perils to the=20

navigator. Almost every one has heard of the ill-fated Franklin expedition,=
 even though others may=20

not be familiar. The=20


_
after all, the girl had been punished enough, and that he should not have a=
ny objection whatever=20

to letting her off, if it could be arranged, although she was an ungrateful=
 and an obstinate minx for=20

not confessing.  Mr. Green, who was a somewhat careful, not to say a penuri=
ous man, with great=20

reluctance consented to give his solicitor authority to take what steps he =
might deem necessary,--

either to pursue or to withdraw from the prosecution, to defend the girl, t=
o unravel the mystery of=20

the case, and to arrange it if possible, or thought that step expedient.  M=
r. Green's solicitor, at this=20

stage of the business, sent for me. I got leave to accompany the attorney w=
ho was employed for=20

the defence (acting in the capacity of his clerk) to the house of detention=
, where we had an=20

interview with the poor girl. It was one of the most painful scenes I have =
ever gone through. She=20

had completely fascinated the matron and the female warders, who, accustome=
d to deal uniformly=20

with crime, were slow to believe in any theory of a prisoner's innocence; y=
et they believed this girl=20

perfectly innocent; and relying upon my experience of human nature, I almos=
t immediately wrote=20

her down as innocent.  It was evident to me, as I told her legal adviser, t=
hat a "plant" had been=20

made upon her.  When he came out of the gaol, like a blackguard as he was, =
he said to me, "You=20

must not let the case go off at the next examination, because both you and =
I ought to have some=20

costs out of it." With difficulty I was prevented grasping the fellow by th=
e throat. I did, however,=20

suppress my loathing and indignation, and played the hypocrite with him suf=
ficiently to suggest=20

that it would be a good thing if we could get her off at once. There would =
be more credit attaching=20

to us, I argued, than if the magistrate should commit the girl at the next =
examination for trial, and=20

some ranting barrister of the Old-Bailey school got her off, and obtained a=
ll the merit. As to costs, I=20

suggested that most likely some arrangement could be made for a fixed sum, =
so that he might=20

earn as much by a successful defence at the next magistrates' meeting as at=
 the sessions. These=20

arguments had their weight with the attorney, and he soon coincided with me=
 in thinking that we=20

had better bring the case to as speedy a termination as we could.  At the s=
uggestion of Mr.=20

Green's own private attorney, I took a note of introduction to him at his h=
ouse, with a view of=20

consulting him directly on the facts of this case.  I was immediately shown=
 into the library, where I=20

found the merchant and his wife ceased, it being indisputable that it is us=
eless though found. The=20

great expeditions of later years have been equipped purely from a scientifi=
c standpoint. No=20

conceivable benefit to commerce can result therefrom.  But the vast majorit=
y of fatalities in the=20

polar seas have not been among the great exploring expeditions, any more th=
an the majority of=20

disasters in warmer climes are among first-class passenger steamers. The wo=
rld over, it is the=20

coasting vessels, the fishing smacks, the second and third-class freighters=
 that swell the lists of=20

losses at sea. And in the polar seas the most numerous disasters are among =
the whaling and=20

sealing vessels, which visit the regions season after season. Many a vessel=
 has been crushed like=20

an egg-shell amid the enormous masses of ice. Often a vessel seemingly hope=
lessly imprisoned=20

has been abandoned by the crew, only to be freed by some caprice of the win=
ds and picked up by=20

some other crew. And again there have been instances of vessels seen restin=
g in masses of ice=20

far above the water, raised by continual tilting and piling of ice-cakes be=
neath. Sometimes a=20

vessel has floated about thus for a considerable period. Comparatively spea=
king, losses of life=20

have been small in proportion to the dangers and property losses. Where so =
many vessels are in=20

the same region at a time, the crew of a crushed ship can generally reach a=
nother vessel without=20

great difficulty. But years ago, when the whaling fleet was smaller, and st=
eam had not been called=20



to the seaman=E2=80=99s aid, the peril of life was greater; and many is the=
 vessel that sailed away never to=20

be heard of again.  One of the best stories illustrating this class of dang=
ers is that of the whaleship=20

_Rufus_. A whaling vessel in 1774 found an abandoned ship; and on boarding =
her, found the crew=20

scattered about in the postures assumed when they first yielded to the fata=
l sleep. The tale, in=20

verse worth  [Illustration: CASTAWAYS ON A RAFT.]  remembering, but seldom =
or never seen,=20

was told many years ago by an unknown author. The distinctness and simplici=
ty of the style render=20

the poem worth preserving, aside from the interest of the story.   THE SHIP=
 RUFUS.      Sing not,=20

thought for the purpose of making a demonstration or producing an effect up=
on me.  We left Mrs.=20

Green in the library. As Mr. Green, in the drawing-room, began to relate to=
 me his conviction of the=20

girl's guilt, my eye rested upon a splendid piano, the lid of which was clo=
sed, and, as I afterwards=20

found, fastened, but jammed in which I thought I saw the corner of a note. =
 Here, I       Those=20

imagination I dimly perceived, through the walnut-tree lid of the piano, so=
mething wrapped in that=20

envelope of which a corner was palpably visible.  I did not venture to disc=

to Mr. Green. I did     Borne onward by the angry North,       An arctic na=
