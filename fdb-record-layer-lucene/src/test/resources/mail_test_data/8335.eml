philodendron monstera a gun in it; apparently he considered that a sufficie=
nt precaution against an attack by TT. He wasn't likely to react in a panic=
ky manner. And the mere fact that he suspected Telzey of homicidal tendenci=
es would make him give the closest attention to what she said. Whether he b=
elieved her then was the shawl, and the cavaliers pass under it. In fact, i=
t is the only thing; it is the new dance at Paris.=E2=80=9D  What a pity th=
at any thing so delightful should be so indefinite and perplexing, and inde=
ed impossible, which rendered it still more desirable! If Lord Carisbrooke =
only could have remembered its philodendron monstera a gun in it; apparentl=
y he considered that a sufficient precaution against an attack by TT. He wa=
sn't likely to react in a panicky manner. And the mere fact that he suspect=
ed Telzey of homicidal tendencies would make him give the closest attention=
 to what she said. Whether he believed her then was the shawl, and the cava=
liers pass under it. In fact, it is the only thing; it is the new dance at =
Paris.=E2=80=9D  What a pity that any thing so delightful should be so inde=
finite and perplexing, and indeed impossible, which rendered it still more =
desirable! If Lord Carisbrooke only could have remembered its _
brutes before disease wiped them out on the planet."  [Illustration]  The l=
ast seemed a less than=20

fortunate statement just now. Telzey felt a sharp tingle of alarm, then sen=
sed that in the minds=20

which were drawing the meaning of the Moderator's speech from her mind ther=
e had been only a=20

brief stir of interest.  She cleared her throat, said, "The point is that t=
hey weren't wiped out by=20

disease."  He considered her quizzically, seemed to wonder what she was try=
ing to lead up to.=20

Telzey gathered her courage, plunged on, "Would you like to hear what did h=
appen?"  "I should be=20

very much interested, Miss Amberdon," the Moderator said without change of =
expression. "But=20

first, if you'll excuse me a moment...."  There had been some signal from h=
is desk which Telzey=20

hadn't noticed, because he picked up a small communicator now and said "Yes=
?" After a few=20

seconds, he resumed, "That's rather curious, isn't it?... Yes, I'd try that=
.... No, that shouldn't be=20

necessary.... Yes, please do. Thank you." He replaced the communicator, his=
 face very sober;=20

then, his eyes flicking for an instant to TT, he drew one of the upper desk=
 drawers open a few=20

inches, and turned back to Telzey.  "Now, Miss Amberdon," he said affably, =
"you were about to=20

say? About these crest cats...."  Telzey swallowed. She hadn't heard the ot=
her simplicity with=20

which they exhibited and expressed their feelings, had in them something be=
witching. Then the=20

rough remembrance of his old life at Falkirk and its contrast with the pres=
ent scene had in it=20

something stimulating. They were his juniors by several years, but they wer=
e always gentle and=20

kind to him; and sometimes it seemed he was the only person whom they, too,=
 had found kind and=20

gentle. He called his cousin, too, by her Christian name, and he was amused=
, standing by this=20

beautiful giantess, and calling her Flora. There were other amusing circums=
tances in the quadrille;=20

not the least, Lord St. Aldegonde dancing with Mrs. Campian. The wonder of =
Lady St. Aldegonde=20

was only equalled by her delight.  The lord-lieutenant was standing by the =
duke, in a comer of the=20

saloon, observing, not with dissatisfaction, his daughter, Lady Ida Alice, =
dancing with Lothair.  =E2=80=9CDo=20

you know this is the first time I ever had the honor of meeting a cardinal?=
=E2=80=9D he said.  =E2=80=9CAnd we never=20

expected that it would happen to either of us in this country when we were =
at Christchurch=20

together,=E2=80=9D replied the duke.  =E2=80=9CWell, I hope every thing is =
for the best,=E2=80=9D said Lord Agramont. =E2=80=9CWe are=20

to have all these gentlemen in our good city of Grandchester, to-morrow.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSo I understand.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CYou read that paragraph in the newspapers? Do=20


_
but she could guess what it had been about. His office had called the guest=
 house, had been told=20

by Halet's maid that Halet, the chauffeur and Dr. Droon were out looking fo=
r Miss Telzey and her=20

pet. The Moderator's office had then checked on the sportscar's communicati=
on number and=20

attempted to call it. And, of course, there had been no response.  To the M=
oderator, considering=20

what Halet would have told him, it must add up to the grim possibility that=
 the young lunatic he was=20

talking to had let her three-quarters-grown crest cat slaughter her thing i=
n it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAbout our friend? It=20

would be a great misfortune.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe bishop says there is no=
thing in it,=E2=80=9D said the lord-lieutenant.=20

=E2=80=9CWell, he ought to know. I understand he has had some serious conve=
rsation recently with our=20

friend?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; he has spoken to me about it. Are you going=
 to attend the early celebration=20

tomorrow? It is not much to my taste; a little new-fangled, I think; but I =
shall go, as they say it will=20

do good.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am glad of that; it is well that he should be=
 impressed at this moment with the=20

importance and opinion of his=20


_
the two men when they caught up with her! The office would be notifying the=
 police now to conduct=20

an immediate search for the missing aircar.  When it would occur to them to=
 look for it on the=20

Moderator's parking terrace was something Telzey couldn't know. But if Hale=
t and Dr. Droon were=20

released before the Moderator accepted her own version of what had occurred=
, and the two=20

reported the presence of wild crest cats in Port Nichay, there would be alm=
ost no possibility of  =E2=80=9CDo=20

you know I never saw him before?=E2=80=9D said the lord-lieutenant. =E2=80=
=9CHe is winning.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI know no youth,=E2=80=9D=20

said the duke, =E2=80=9CI would not except my own son, and Bertram has neve=
r given me an uneasy=20

moment, of whom I have a better opinion, both as to heart and head. I shoul=
d deeply deplore his=20

being smashed by a Jesuit.=E2=80=9D  The dancing had ceased for a moment; t=
here was a stir; Lord=20

Carisbrooke was enlarging, with unusual animation, to an interested group, =
about a new dance at=20


_
situation under control. Somebody was bound to make some idiotic move, and =
the fat would be in=20

the fire....         *       *       *       *       *  Two things might be=
 in her favor. The Moderator seemed to=20

have the sort of steady nerve one would expect in a man who had bagged two =
Baluit crest cats.=20

Unfortunately, he did not know its name, and could not describe its figure;=
 but it was something=20

new; quite new; they got it at Paris. Princess Metternich dances it. He dan=
ced it with her, and she=20

taught it him; only he never could explain any thing, and indeed never did =
exactly make it out. =E2=80=9CBut=20

you=20
