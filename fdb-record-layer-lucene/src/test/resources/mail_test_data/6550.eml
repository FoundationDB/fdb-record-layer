since such things are not plain and apparent to the view, as we think they =

since I observe that the uneducated rather than the educated are in higher =
favour, thinking it=20

beneath me to engage with the uneducated in the struggle for honour, I pref=

excellence of our department of knowledge by the publication of this treati=
se.  4. In my first book,=20

Emperor, I described to you the art, with its points of excellence, the dif=
ferent kinds of training with=20

which the architect ought to be equipped, adding the reasons why he ought t=
o be skilful in them,=20

and I divided up the subject of architecture as a whole among its departmen=
ts, duly defining the=20

limits of each. Next, as was preeminent and necessary, I explained on scien=
tific principles the=20

method into a convent, into a widows' home, into an almshouse...."  "Into a=
 lunatic asylum!" I cried,=20

not able to restrain myself.  "Well, even into a lunatic asylum! That would=
 be better, that would be=20

better," she cried, with flashing eyes. "When I was in Pestrovo today I env=
ied the sick and starving=20

peasant women because they are not living with a man like you. They are fre=

thanks to you, I am a parasite, I am perishing in idleness, I eat your brea=
d, I spend your money,=20

and I repay you with my liberty and a fidelity which is of no use to any on=
e. Because you won't=20

give me a passport, I must respect your good name, though it doesn't exist.=
"  I had to keep silent.=20

Clenching my teeth, I walked quickly into the drawing-room, but turned back=
 at once and said:  "I=20

beg you earnestly that there should be no more assemblies, plots, and meeti=
ngs of conspirators in=20

my house! I only admit to my house those with whom I am acquainted, and let=
 all your crew find=20

another place to do it if they want to take up philanthropy. I can't allow =
people at=20


_
geometrical figures the different winds and the quarters from which they bl=
ow, and showed the=20

proper way to lay out the lines of streets and rows of houses within the wa=
lls. Here I fixed the end=20

of my first book. In the second, on building materials, I treated their var=
ious advantages in=20

structures, and the natural properties of which they are composed. In this =
third book I shall speak=20

of the temples of the immortal gods, describing and explaining them in the =
proper manner.=20

CHAPTER I  ON SYMMETRY: IN TEMPLES AND IN THE HUMAN BODY   1. The design of=
 a=20

temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which must be most carefully =
observed by the=20

architect. They are due to proportion, in Greek [Greek: analogia]. Proporti=
on is a correspondence=20

among the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to a =
certain part selected=20

as standard. From this result the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry =
and proportion there=20

can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no p=
recise relation between its=20

members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man.  2. For the human bo=
dy is so designed by=20

nature that the face, from the chin to the top of the forehead and the lowe=
st roots of the hair, is a=20

tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of =
the middle finger is just the=20

same; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck a=
nd shoulder from the=20

top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the midd=
le of the breast to the=20

summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height of the face itself, =
the distance from the=20

bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; th=
e nose from hysterical=20

woman like you!"  My wife, pale and wringing her hands, took a rapid stride=
 across the room,=20

uttering a prolonged moan as though she had toothache. With a wave of my ha=
nd, I went into the=20

drawing-room. I was choking with rage, and at the same time I was trembling=
 with terror that I=20

might not restrain myself, and that I might say or do something which I mig=
ht regret all my life. And=20

I clenched my hands tight, hoping to hold myself in.  After drinking some w=
ater and recovering my=20

calm a little, I went back to my wife. She was standing in the same attitud=
e as before, as though=20

barring my approach to the table with the papers. Tears were slowly trickli=
ng down her pale, cold=20

face. I paused then and said to her bitterly but without anger:  "How you m=
isunderstand me! How=20

unjust you are to me! I swear upon my honour I came to you with the best of=
 motives, with nothing=20

but the desire to do good!"  "Pavel Andreitch!" she said, clasping her hand=
s on her bosom, and her=20

face took on the agonized, imploring expression with which frightened, weep=
ing children beg not to=20

be punished, "I know perfectly well that you will refuse me, but still I be=
g you. Force yourself to do=20

one kind action in your life. I entreat you, go away from here! That's the =
only thing you can do for=20

the starving peasants. Go away, and I will forgive you everything, everythi=
ng!"  "There is no need=20

for you to insult me, Natalie," I sighed, feeling a sudden rush of humility=
. "I had already made up=20

my mind to go away, but I won't go until I have done something for the peas=
ants. It's my duty!"=20

"Ach!" she said softly with an impatient frown. "You can make an excellent =
bridge or railway, but=20

you can do nothing for the starving peasants. Do=20


_
side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there=
 to the lowest roots of=20

the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot i=
s one sixth of the height of=20

the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also=
 one fourth. The other=20

members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employi=
ng them that the=20

famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless re=
nown.  3. Similarly, in=20

the  "Indeed? Yesterday you reproached me with indifference and with being =
devoid of the feeling=20

of compassion. How well you know me!" I laughed. "You believe in God--well,=
 God is my witness=20

that I am worried day and night...."  "I see that you are worried, but the =
famine and compassion=20

have nothing to do with it. You are worried because the starving peasants c=
an get on without you,=20

and because the Zemstvo, and in fact every one who is helping them, does no=
t need your=20

guidance."  I was silent,=20
