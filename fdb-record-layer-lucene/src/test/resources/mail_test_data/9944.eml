Nurse. That the transformation was quite complete was proven by the "For Pe=
te's sake!" that=20

exploded from Ted's lips when at last, having solved all the problems of th=
e universe, he turned to=20

see if she were really there.  "Smile!" he commanded. She smiled.  "That's =
swell. Thanks," he=20

exclaimed. "I just wanted to see if you were real."  He was to know much mo=
re about that a few=20

moments later.  "Listen! I think I hear the roar of a heavy plane!" Mary ex=
claimed suddenly.  Ted=20

listened. The drone of his own motor was in his ears. He heard nothing else=
. "Guess you imagined=20

that," he said. "Strange things happen to you in the sky. There are mirages=
 of sound as well as of=20

sight."  She made no reply. The steady drumming was still in her ears. She =
was tired. It had been=20

a long, exciting day. She wondered vaguely what they would do with her when=
 she got aboard the=20

_Black Bee_, if she ever did. She hoped there was a tiny cabin where she co=
uld sleep forever and=20

ever. Thinking of this, she nearly fell asleep when Ted exclaimed:  "Look a=
t that! The light of the=20

moon blinked out and there's not a cloud in the sky!"  "But it's on now!" s=
he laughed.  "Yes, it came=20

right back, but--"  "There!" she exclaimed. "It's off again! No! Now it's o=
n--"  Ted did not answer. He=20

was beginning to think he knew what was up. He hoped the moon would blink a=
gain. And he was=20

not disappointed.  "Look at the moon! Quick!" He was all excited.  "It's ou=
t!" she protested.  "Look=20

closer! There's a Jap snooper between us and the moon. Now it's below the m=
oon! Once you get it=20

spotted, you can see it anywhere."  "What's a Jap snooper?" she asked.  "A =
big four-motored=20

flying boat looking for a U. S. convoy."  "Oh!" she breathed. "We have to g=
et that one, don't we?"=20

"I'll say we do! Wonder if Jack's radio works?" Then, "No matter. Don't dar=
e call him. We'll get after=20

that snooper alone."  The girl's hair seemed to rise and stand up like a fu=
zzy-wuzzy's, but she was=20

game. "Get them!" she hissed. She was thinking of the horrors of Corregidor=
 and Bataan.  Giving=20

his ship the gun, keeping an eye on the giant's shadow, Ted began to climb.=
 The big ship was=20

slow. They gained rapidly. At just the right moment Ted came racing down up=
on the snooper.=20

They were almost upon it when Ted let out a burst of murderous fire.  He sh=
ot past the big ship,=20

swung back, felt his way until the snooper was again between him and the mo=
on, then went=20

straight at her. Again at very close range he pressed the firing button. Bu=
t what was this? The gun=20

fired a few shots, then jammed.  "Bum outfit--not my ship nor my gun," he g=
roaned.  All of a=20

sudden, to his astonishment, he caught the _rat--tat--tat_ of a gun behind =
him. It was Mary. They=20

were passing beneath the enemy. She was firing the rear gun, straight up.  =
"Good girl!" he=20

exclaimed. "Give it to them!"  Flashes of fire came from the enemy, but the=
 shots went wild.  "We'll=20

swing about and meet them almost head on," he said in a steady voice. "I'll=
 dip down just in time=20

and you give them all you've got."  "I--I'll do my darndest." She braced he=
rself for the ordeal.  They=20

very nearly missed going low enough. It seemed to Ted that they must have s=
craped uncommon.=20

Among these we may mention tremor, insomnia, and nervous dread of thunder-s=
torms and of=20

electricity. There is no doubt that some persons who have been exposed to l=
ightning stroke do, at=20

least for a time, become unusually susceptible to the influences of atmosph=
eric electricity.  =3DLoss=20

of Motion=E2=80=94Paralysis.=3D=E2=80=94This is a very frequent result of a=
 stroke from lightning. Hemiplegia is not=20

uncommon. In Bonnet=E2=80=99s case the patient was struck on the head by th=
e lightning, which caused a=20

lacerated wound in the left temple, but did not injure the aponeurosis. On =
recovery of=20

consciousness the patient was found to have a left hemiplegia involving the=
 face and both=20

extremities accompanied by a diminution of sensation over the left half of =
the body. The sensation=20



became normal in two days, but a partial hemiplegia remained permanently. I=
n the case of Durand=20

there was a nearly complete right hemiplegia with accompanying hyper=C3=A6s=
thesia and some=20

affection of speech. Deglutition and mastication were difficult, and there =
was persistent hiccough.=20

There was photophobia and hyper=C3=A6sthesia. The patient improved in two w=
eeks and finally=20

recovered. There is often a temporary hemiplegia.  Nearly all forms of para=
lyses of the extremities=20

may occur. We may have paralysis of all the extremities or of both arms or =
legs, or monoplegias.=20

Paraplegia occurs not very rarely. It is usually of short duration. It may =
be accompanied by=20

paralysis of the bladder. Single muscles or muscle groups only may be affec=
ted.  Ptosis may occur=20

with paralysis of other branches of the third nerve, causing diplopia. Faci=
al paralysis occurs also=20

alone; in one case it lasted only twenty-four hours, in another one month. =
 Difficulty in mastication=20

is sometimes found, but much more frequently difficulty in deglutition is r=
eported.  Retention of=20

urine, dysuria, or incontinentia urin=C3=A6 may all occur, and there is som=
etimes a paralysis of the=20

rectum, usually temporary, and sometimes obstinate constipation, which in o=
ne case was=20

combined with paralysis of the bladder and monoplegia.  Aphasia in various =
degrees and various=20

forms of dysphasia or difficulty in speech are not uncommon. They are apt t=
o be temporary.  Loss=20

of co-ordination in the lower extremities with partial paralysis of bladder=
 and rectum is reported.=20

=3DConvulsions.=3D=E2=80=94Epilepsy may be brought on by lightning: this wo=
uld be more likely to occur in a=20

person previously subject to epileptic attacks. Hysterical convulsions and =
spasms may also be=20

produced, both immediately and as a more remote result, usually in persons =
predisposed. Tetany=20

and catalepsy are said to occur.  Clonic spasms of the whole body and convu=
lsive movements of=20

the limbs are not very infrequent. In some cases a marked sensitiveness rem=
ains for a time in the=20

limbs struck, so that if touched they are immediately thrown into clonic sp=
asms.  =3DDisturbances of=20

Sensation.=3D=E2=80=94_Pain_ occurs in nearly all cases. It is most frequen=
tly a secondary result of the=20

burns and other injuries. Not rarely, however, it exists as a direct sympto=
m in the form of a burning=20

or stinging neuralgia in the limb or limbs affected. Sometimes the first se=
nsation on the recovery of=20

consciousness seems to be pain all over the body or confined to some portio=
ns only, but the=20

amount and=20


_
And it was very good, for scarcely had they passed on to safety when there =
was a great flash and=20

an explosion as the giant blew up.  "Good work! Great stuff!" sounded in Te=
d's ears. Jack was=20

speaking.  "Better keep radio silence," was Ted's answer.  All the while Te=
d and Mary were=20

engaged in the fight, Jack and Stew had been standing by to come in if they=
 were needed.  Stew=20

had been all for stepping in at the very start, but Jack had ruled against =
it. "We don't know our=20

ship, our guns, or our instruments well enough to risk it," was his verdict=
. "Besides, our capture of=20

this secret plane may be of more importance than we think."  "Not much help=
 at the bottom of the=20

sea," Stew agreed.  The fight over, they got back into line, then zoomed on=
 through the night.  Ted=20

was astonished when at last, flying high, they sighted the white specks on =
the sea that would be=20

their task force. And a greatly reinforced one it was.  "Three times as man=
y fighting ships as we=20

had before," he said to Mary. "Three carriers and scores of cruisers and de=
stroyers. This is it!=20

We're off to the big varies much. One patient had a burning pain in the bac=
k and leg lasting only=20

half an hour after recovery of consciousness. In another case there were pa=
ins all over at the end=20

of the first week. On the whole, severe pain in some or all of the limbs, a=
nd less commonly in the=20

head, without paralysis and lasting some days is not rare. In one case repo=
rted by Paige the=20

patient had intense pain in the head, neck, arms, and chest; that in the he=
ad was constant, severe,=20

and lasted seven days, elsewhere less constant.  Pain in the arms accompani=
ed by paralysis and=20

an=C3=A6sthesia and lasting three months has been reported.  Headache is no=
t rare as a later or=20

secondary symptom.  Disturbances of sensation other than pain are not rare.=
  A certain amount of=20

hyper=C3=A6sthesia almost always exists in the portion affected immediately=
 after the stroke. This is=20

often so marked that it cannot be wholly due to the burns or other injuries=
. It is usually very=20

temporary and ceases in a few hours. In some cases a permanent or lasting s=
ensitiveness to the=20

action of electricity is said to remain.=20


_
"This is it!" Stew was saying to Jack.  "Only part of it," Jack replied. "W=
e'll pick up two other task=20

forces. In all there will be hundreds of ships--more than you have seen in =
all your life!"  Even at=20

that, Jack was thrilled to his fingertips at sight of this great battle arm=
ada. "We'll be back on the=20

deck of the _Black Bee_ in just no time," he said to Stew.  "With luck we s=
hall," Stew agreed.=20

without paralysis. In the cases reported by Balfour, one boy said he could =
not feel his legs and=20

another that his arms were cut off. In a case reported by Free there was lo=
ss of sensation in the=20

right upper extremity from the elbow to the fingers and in the left lower e=
xtremity from the knee to=20

laughed into his mike.  "Make 'em a speech, boy! Make 'em a speech!" Jack u=

is to be suspected.  Par=C3=A6sthesi=C3=A6 are very common after lightning =

is the subjective sensation of numbness. Tingling, formication, and the sen=
