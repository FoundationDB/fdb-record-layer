dracaena marginata breathing hard. Pointing his stick in the direction of the minister, he finished with savage calm, "My little girl here alone, and with a man like you! God help me!"

Daisy Mainwaring has lost a considerable sum of money, and the poor little child is in such trouble 

about it that she has run away. Of course, I don't believe for a moment that she has really lost the 

money--of course it was stolen from her. Well, good-bye, I'm going to seek her, other man." 

Elizabeth did not once take her gaze from her brother's face, while she spoke slowly and distinctly: 

"Father will not be afraid to face the truth, even though it may mean financial ruin. He is brave, and 

he is honest now. I shall tell him all."  "Don't be too hasty,

house in good time in the morning, Dove."  "Yes, sir, very sorry to hear your bad news," said Dove, 

in a self-possessed voice, but Arthur saw that his color had changed, and he wanted no stronger 

clue to confirm his suspicions. When he got into the street he not only consulted his watch, but a 

time-table. A later train than he had intended to travel by would take it to Rosebury early in the 

morning. He would go by this train. Now he jumped into a hansom and drove to his it strike you as 

strange the way Father acted that night when I announced my contemplated trip to Australia to 

look up Phillips?"  She nodded ever so slightly.  "And did it strike you as strange the way he 

treated Mr. McGowan when he offered to help him to his room?"  "But why do you bring Mr. 

McGowan into this?"  "Bets, if I had known one grain of the truth that night I'd have flatly refused 

the appointment to this case at the risk of losing my position in the firm. Father was

gave hasty directions.  "You're to buy the paint yourself, Lawson; see that it is properly mixed, and 

the right shade. Move the plants from the balcony early in the morning--the man will arrive in good 

time, and listen, Lawson, I don't want him to be too closely watched."  "What do you mean by that, 

sir?" said Lawson.  "Only that wish you to read. I had it copied in Washington last week." 

Elizabeth unfolded the paper, and read: "Be it known that one Adoniah Phillips, after due 

application, and upon his own request, for reasons herein stated, is authorized to change his 

name to----"  The paper fell to the floor. The room began to swim. The furniture

out, of course--but don't imagine the man to be a thief until he is proved such."  "Well, sir, your 

commands must be obeyed, of course, but you have many articles of virtue and elegance about." 

"Never mind that, Lawson--do as I tell you."  When his servant left the room Noel took a five-pound 

note out of his pocket, and enclosing it in an open envelope laid it carelessly on the chimney-

piece. There was no writing on the envelope, and the note might well have been slipped into it by 

mistake. Noel also slipped a ring of some value from his finger, and dropped it into a little tray, 

which contained odds and ends of different descriptions.  "Now I've laid my trap," he said to 

himself. "My poor little Daisy, I hope I may ensnare your ogre to his destruction."  The next 

morning early Dove, well pleased with his job, and never guessing that the smallest suspicions 

had attached themselves to him, arrived at Noel's rooms. He was a most idle man, and seldom 

cared for work, but he was pleased at Noel's singling him out, and imagined that notwithstanding 

her running away, he owed this visit to little Daisy.  "She's a pert little thing," he said to himself, 

"and if she's so true to me as all this, why I suppose I must leave her alone in the future. I made a 

nice little haul out of her the other day, and I've got several of them sovereigns about me still; but 

lor, wasn't she in a piteous fright when I took that cheque away with me!"  Dove was highly 

pleased with the appearance of Noel's rooms. He could see no beauty in the simplicity of the girls' 

Palace Beautiful, but although he was quite incapable of judging of the value of the pictures and 

exquisite little statuettes which adorned the walls, he was judge enough of the depth and richness 

of the Turkey rugs, and of the wealth which must have been expended over the very select 

furniture of Noel's sitting-room.  Lawson, wondering much at his master's directions but supposing 

that Dove must be a very special _protege_, received him with much cordiality, gave him 

directions with regard to his work, and then left him alone. Dove painted and cleaned, and whistled 

as he worked; he felt quite cheerful and virtuous, and began to consider that the position of British 

workmen was not such a bad one after all. He felt more and more pleased with Daisy Mainwaring 

for having put him in the way of such agreeable and profitable occupation, and more and more 

resolved to leave her alone for the future.  "Maybe if I was to talk to the pretty little dear she'd find 

me a deal more jobs of this yere sort," he said to himself. "A little lady she is, and no mistake, and 

she keeps very genteel friends, as any one can see with half an eye."  After Dove had worked for 

two or three hours he began to feel thirsty, for he was quite unaccustomed to any continuous 

labor. The sun was shining brightly on the balcony, and he was also a little hot, and the inside of 

Noel's room looked deliciously cool and inviting. He had just seen Lawson walking down the 

street, too, so he was quite sure of having the premises to himself. Slipping off his shoes he 

stepped into the room and began to look about him with an appreciative air. He handled some of 

Noel's choicest books, and looked through a portfolio of rare engravings but neither books nor 

engravings were quite in Dove's way, and after a time he strolled over to the mantel-piece, as he 

said, to see how he looked reflected in the over-mantel glass. There were letters there directed to 

Noel. Dove would have dearly liked to acquaint himself with their contents, but he was a slow and 

deficient reader. Some cigars lay in a little cigar-case at one end. Dove, as a matter of course, and 

without weighing the question at all, slipped a couple into his pocket. After doing this he did not 

feel quite so virtuous, nor so like the proverbial British workman; he jingled some of Daisy's 

sovereigns in his pocket, and laughed when they made a pleasant sound. Still eagerly peering at 

all the articles on the mantel-piece his quick eyes presently detected amongst a heap  "Mack 



McGowan!" she whispered faintly. "Oh, what am I saying? Why am I saying that name? What has 

happened to me?"  "Poor little girl! I thought my little sister was stronger than that. I've been a fool 

for letting you read all those papers after the strain you've been through."  "Mack McGowan!" she 

repeated. She seized the paper which her brother had lifted from the floor. "Oh, it's in that paper, 

and it's _his_ name! Harold, what does it mean?"  "You must brace up, Beth. The man you are in 

love with is the son of Adoniah Phillips. He bears his father's new name."  She was suddenly 

weary. She felt just one desire: to get back home. She took Harold's arm and led him toward the 

door.  "I want to go home, and I need you to drive the car."     CHAPTER XVII   During the 

homeward trip Elizabeth was as one in a stupor. When they reached the brow of the hill above the 

village, Harold stopped the car. Elizabeth half turned about in her seat, resting her elbow on the 

back above and lifting her hand to her eyes to shade them from the light. She gazed upon the 

glory of the western sky where the sun was dropping into a bed of gold, lavishly splashing the low-

hanging clouds with a radiance that seemed to drip from their edges. A shock suddenly brought 

her back to reality with a pain at her heart. Silhouetted against the gold of the sky-line, his head 

bared, his shoulders thrown back, was a tall figure: the son of Adoniah Phillips!  "That's a good 

view for sore hearts, Bets," commented her brother.  She caught her breath in quick gasps. "Yes. 

But, oh, Harold, it's so hard!"  "I know," he agreed, taking her hand. "Have you thought out a line of 

action? Where shall we begin?"  The girl did not answer. Harold followed with his eyes the 

direction of her gaze. His hand tightened in hers. The minister had just recognized them, and was 

waving his cap high over his head in welcome. Elizabeth lifted her handkerchief and permitted the 

light breeze to flutter it. Harold answered with a swing of his arm. Mr. McGowan started toward 

them.  "Drive me home, Harold. I can't see him now."  "But, Sis, this may be our only time 

together. Tell me what to do. I'm lost. I don't know which way to turn."  "I must see Uncle Josiah 

first. He has had time to think a lot, and he may know how to help us. I'm going to his place to-

night."  "By George! You're right. I hadn't thought of going to him. He does know something about 

this. He was in my office the other day, and asked a host of questions. He'll help us if he can. Why 

not stop there now?"  "Not now. I'm not decent to see any one, or be seen. Please, take me 

home."  He threw in the clutch and the car shot down the hill, past a curious crowd in front of the 

general store, and on up the knoll into the Fox estate.  Mr. Fox had not yet returned from 

Riverhead. He had telephoned that he might get home for dinner. But the dinner hour came and 

went, and still he did not return. After the silent, and all but untasted, meal, Elizabeth left the house 

by the rear entrance. She hurried along the walk, out through the wicket gate at the back, and 

down to the beach. From here she turned into the path that zigzagged across town-lots, over 

sand-dunes, through brush heaps, to the rear of the Captain's place.  She walked round the house 

to the side door. She lifted the heavy knocker, and held it tightly as though fearing to let it drop 

against the rusty iron plate. What if Uncle Josiah had forgotten his engagement, and was not 

home? But Uncle Josiah had never yet forgotten a promise he had made her. She let the piece of 

iron fall. The sound echoed through the house. It frightened her, and she poised as though of a 

mind to run. Instead of the usual hearty boom for her to "Come in," the door swung wide, and she 

stood face to face with the minister.  "Oh!" she cried, stepping back into the shadows.  "I've been 

expecting you, Miss Fox. Will you come in?" he cordially invited.  "You were expecting me? But I---

-"  Hardly knowing what she did, and certainly not realizing why she did it, she accepted the 


_
of rubbish and odds and ends Noel's valuable signet-ring; it was of heavy workmanship, and its 

gold alone made it worth money.  "Why, Isaacs the Jew would give me two pound ten, or perhaps 

three pounds for this," queried Dove. "It has plainly been forgotten here, and if the gent does miss 

it he'll lay the blame on that fine fellow Lawson."  It took a very small parley with Dove's seared 

conscience to make him pocket the ring, and by the time Lawson returned to the house the five-

pound note had also been appropriated. Dove whistled more cheerily than ever over his work that 

afternoon, and in the evening he went home quite unsuspecting any little trap which might have 

been set for him.  He had scarcely gone before a boy arrived with a telegram directed to Lawson, 

and with a reply pre-paid. Lawson read the following words:--  "Look on the mantel-piece in my 

sitting-room for a blank envelope, open, which contains a five-pound note--No. 11267. I also left 

my ring in the cigar tray. Wire reply if note and ring are safe.--ARTHUR NOEL."  The address to 

reply to was added.  Poor Lawson spent an agonized ten minutes in searching over the contents 

of the mantel-piece. In the end he had to fill in the reply telegram with the news that nowhere could 

the five-pound note nor the ring be found.  A little over two hours passed, and again the worthy 

servant was startled by a telegraphic dispatch. This was what it contained:--  "Have reasons to 

believe that the painter Dove is the thief. Go instantly to the nearest police-station, give them the 

number of the note, and go with one of their staff to Dove's house. His address is, 10, Eden Street, 

Junction Road, Holloway. The note and ring will probably be found on his person. Get him 

apprehended if possible. Take all necessary cabs.--ARTHUR NOEL."  Thus it came to pass that 

when that evening Dove sat down tranquilly to a luxurious supper of lobster salad, chops, and 

bottled stout, he was unpleasantly interrupted. When two policemen, accompanied by Lawson, 

came into his room, he was guilty of using very violent language, and altogether conducted himself 

in a most excited manner; but, notwithstanding his resistance, and Mrs. Dove's hysterics, and 

some terribly distressing chuckles, really sounding more like laughter than tears, which were heard 

to issue from the lips of that naughty boy, Tommy, a strict closed the door. She stood poised like a 

wild thing ready for flight at the slightest warning.  "I trust that your father isn't ill again?" said the 

minister solicitously.  "No-o. That is, not yet. He's quite well, thank you. He isn't home, or wasn't 

when I left."  "I'm glad."  "I beg your pardon?"  "I'm glad your father isn't ill," he explained, growing 

quite as embarrassed as she.  "Oh! Yes. Thank you."  "Miss Fox, something must be wrong. May I 

help you?"  "No. Really, no. That is, not bad wrong, yet," she stammered. "Only he promised to be 

home, and--well, he isn't."  "The Captain will be back soon. He asked me to entertain you till his 

return. I fear I'm not doing it very well."  "Indeed, you are. That is, I guess you are. Is the Captain 

far away?"  "He took Miss Pipkin over to Miss Splinter's. Miss Splinter is very ill. Won't you be 

seated?"  "Yes, thank you. No, I think I'll stand. Dear me! What can be the matter with me? I'm 

acting quite stupid and silly, am I not?"  She tried to laugh, but her dry throat gave a cracked 

sound. Mr. McGowan noticed, and did not complete the smile that was beginning to form about his 

own lips.  "Really, I think I'll be going, and come back again. I feel so very queerly, and--

uncomfortable with--with----"  "With me in the room?" he finished with a sad smile. "I'm sorry. I'll 

step into my study. If you need anything, please call."  He had reached the door and the knob had 

turned under his hand when she gave a cry, between a sob and a plea. He swung quickly about. 

"Don't leave me, please!" she pleaded. "I mean, don't go on my account."  "But I seem to be 

disturbing you, and I don't wish to do that," he said kindly.  She broke down completely. "Oh, I do 



need you so much! Please stay! I'm afraid, afraid of everything, afraid of myself! You said one 

should keep a cool head, but I can't! I can't! I've tried so hard. Oh, Mack--Mr. McGowan, please 

help me!"  She finished her broken plea in muffled sobs in the folds of his coat. He drew her 

against him till his arms ached. She knew now that she could make of her love for this man no 

voluntary offering in order to save her father humiliation. All afternoon and evening she had been 

forming that resolution. But this love that had come to her, pure and undefiled from the hand of 

God, could not be denied for the sins of one man, even though that man be her

consequence he was that very night locked up in jail.  Oh, if only poor little Daisy, tossing on her 

hot and feverish pillow, could have known!     CHAPTER XLV.  THE PRINCE TO THE RESCUE. 

Hannah was doing well in her little shop at Teckford. She had always been a most saving body, 

and although Mrs. Mainwaring had never been able to pay her high wages, she had managed to 

put the greater portion of what she received away. Hannah was one of those fortunate individuals 

on whom even a shabby dress will look neat. Her boots lasted twice as long as any one else's, her 

caps retained their starch and their whiteness long after another servant's would have had to be 

resigned to a fresh cleaning process. Hannah therefore required little or no money to spend on 

dress, and in consequence, when the Mainwaring girls went away, she had a little nest-egg laid by 

to stock a shop. She found a suitable little house at Teckford, laid in her little store of provisions 

with care, for she argued wisely that however poor people were they required food, and was living 

very comfortably on the proceeds of her sales. Hannah, as a rule, had a smooth and unruffled 

brow; she was a careful woman, but not a troubled one. At the present moment, however it could 

scarcely be said of this good soul that she was without cares. The neighbors who came in to buy 

their bacon, and fresh eggs, and candles, and tea, remarked that Hannah had no longer a cheery 

word and a pleasant smile an engulfing current, nor did she wish to stay its overwhelming power. 

For the first time that afternoon she was conscious of real strength.  Mr. McGowan tried to lift her 

face from his shoulder, but she clung the closer.  "I want to look at you," he said jubilantly.  "Not 

just yet!" she sobbed. "I want to get used to this."  "Then, let me hear you say you love me!" 

entreated the man.  "Mack McGowan, I love you!" She drew back a pace. "Now, you may look at 

me just once, though I don't look like much with my eyes all swelled up and red."  He drank in the 

beauty of the face before him. "Thank God! You do love me! It isn't just pity."  She nodded her 

head so vigorously that the wisps of fair hair fell about her large blue eyes. "Yes, I love you, Mack. 

There, now, you've looked long enough. Kiss me, please." She lifted her face.  Mr. McGowan was 

unstintingly obeying the command when a loud knock jarred the side door. They started and 

sprang apart.  "Who can that be knocking like that?" asked the girl, hastily tucking away the stray 

locks of hair.  "It must be the Captain. But I wonder----"  Elizabeth laughed, and pointed toward a 

window where the curtain was above the lower sash. The Captain had seen them!  "I don't care if 

he did see. Let me go to the door."  She had taken one step in that direction when the door flew 

back and in came Mr. James Fox.  "Father! You!"  Without replying, Mr. Fox glared ferociously at 

the minister. His hand trembled 


_
they tumbled out their halfpennies and asked for "a little piece of taffy, please, ma'am," noticed 

that Hannah's eyes had red rims round them, and they wondered if she was naughty, and that was 

why she cried.  Yes, poor Hannah had a troubled heart during those early summer days, for Daisy 

lay so weak and languid, and indifferent to all external things, on her tiny little face. Elizabeth, 

growing alarmed, started toward her father. But the Elder waved her back. Mr. McGowan broke 

the awful silence.  "We can't help it, Mr. Fox. I'm very sorry that this has come against your will." 

"So it is true. God help me!" The Elder's words came with surprising calm, but his tone was harsh 

and hard. "So it is as I was warned. It is hard to believe that my
