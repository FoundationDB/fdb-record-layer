ghts; this might be the=20

place, but of course I didn't stop much to look around."  At the top of the=
 second flight Mr. Stevens=20

and Teeny-bits came to a narrow hallway from which opened two doors. Mr. St=
evens knocked=20

softly on the one at the right and, receiving no answer, pushed it open. Th=
ey had expected to find=20

no one in the room; to their surprise, a Chinese who had been lying on a "d=
ouble-decker" bunk=20

jumped down to the floor and stood looking at them with astonishment and fe=
ar in his face.  "This=20

isn't the room, and I don't think I ever saw this fellow before," Teeny-bit=
s whispered to the English=20

master.  "We're looking for two Chinese who were in one of these rooms last=
 Friday night," said=20

Mr. Stevens to the Oriental. "Perhaps they're in the other room."  It was e=
vident that the Chinaman=20

who confronted them with startled eyes did not understand much English. He =
made no reply and=20

continued to stare at them as if he thought it inexplainable that two white=
 men should suddenly=20

invade his sleeping quarters.  Mr. Stevens backed out of the room and somew=
hat to Teeny-bits'=20

surprise in so many different situations by their owners, that I have known=
 no less than 8 degrees=20

of difference between several of them kept in one town, within almost a sto=
ne's throw of each=20

other, at one and the same moment of time.  Every allowance being made for =
other causes, I am=20

still of the opinion that the difference in the climates of the Ohio and la=
ke regions of country, is to=20

be attributed chiefly to the prevalence of different currents of air. The s=
outhern current rarely, if=20

ever, reaches the northern lakes, and the northern, until lately, never rea=
ched the Gulf of Mexico.=20

But as the country is cleared of its native forests, we may reasonably conc=
lude this cold current of=20

air will prevail more and more, until we shall have snow enough for sleighs=
, at least two months in=20

every winter; the summers will be shorter, the extremes of heat and cold wi=
ll be greater than at=20

present, and those clouds which formerly obscured the sun almost continuall=
y during the summer=20

months, will be chased away, and with them the pale cheek, the sallow hue, =
the oppression at the=20

breast, and the difficulty of respiration, the headache, and the thousand i=
lls which many of the=20


_
empty except for a table and four chairs which were arranged as if for a ga=
me of cards. Teeny-bits=20

had expected to see a mattress lying on the floor, but nothing of the sort =
greeted his eyes and no=20

one was in the room.  "This looks like the place, but somehow it seems chan=
ged," he said to Mr.=20

Stevens.  At that moment they both heard a cry in Chinese and, as they whir=
led round, an answer=20

came from the floor below and the sound of feet pattering down the stairway=
.  "There!" exclaimed=20

Mr. Stevens, "I'm afraid your friends are running away. That fellow in the =
other room has given the=20

alarm. Let's go down to the restaurant quickly and see what we can find."  =
Chuan Kai met the two=20

with an inscrutable countenance. There was something about his eyes, howeve=
r, that suggested=20

to Teeny-bits and Mr. Stevens that he was not wholly unprepared for their c=
all.  "Last Friday night,"=20

said the English master, "this young man was kept for several hours in one =
of the rooms upstairs.=20

We should like to talk to the two Chinese who were kind enough to permit hi=
m to escape."  "No=20

unne'stan'," said Chuan Kai, wrinkling his lips in a manner that showed his=
 yellow teeth.  Mr.=20

Stevens was patient. He repeated his request, laid his hand on Teeny-bits' =
shoulder, pointed=20

toward the ceiling as he mentioned the room above and then held up two fing=
ers as he spoke of=20

the Chinese who had been present when Teeny-bits escaped. The only answer w=
as a puzzled=20

frown on Chuan Kai's wrinkled features; either the old man was bewildered b=
y the request of his=20

visitors or he was a good actor. Suddenly Mr. Stevens decided the latter, f=
or he spoke rapidly and=20

with considerable force:  "I think you understand English all right. Now te=
ll me, where are those=20

two men of yours? If you will let me see them quickly perhaps we can agree =
not to trouble you=20

further. Now then, where are they?"  Chuan Kai smiled with such ingenuousne=
ss as he could=20

summon. "Ai," he said. "You like to see my boys?"  He turned away from them=
 quickly and cried=20

out something in Chinese, at the same time throwing back a door which led t=
o the kitchen.=20

"Come, look, _see_," he said as he turned back to Teeny-bits and Mr. Steven=
s. "You like see all=20

boys."  In the kitchen which was disclosed to view were four Chinese in loo=
se-sleeved shirts and=20

aprons. They were engaged in cutting up meat and in mixing food over the fi=
re. Among them=20

Teeny-bits did not recognize either one of the Orientals who had acted so s=
trangely at our climate.=20

We shall probably then have fewer diseases, and more acute ones. The storms=
 will probably be=20

fewer, more severe, and not continue as long as at present. There are still=
 further views which=20

might be taken of this subject, but they are left to abler pens and future =
observations.  Thus I have=20

endeavoured to give my opinion on a subject of some interest to the present=
, as well as future=20

generations; in doing which, I have not sought for flowers which might have=
 been gathered by=20

stepping out of my path, but the _fruit_ rather of my own observation and e=
xperience: I have not=20

wandered through the fields of imagination, invoking the poetic muse, but a=
ddressed myself chiefly=20

"To him who soars on golden wing,       Guiding his fiery-wheeled throne,  =
     The cherub=20

contemplation."     ART. XIII. _On a singular Disruption of the Ground, app=
arently by Frost, in=20

Letters from_ EDWARD HITCHCOCK, A.M. _Principal of Deerfield Academy_.  (Wi=
th a Plate.)=20

_To the Editor of the American Journal of Science, &c._    SIR,  I have lat=
ely examined a singular=20

disruption in the earth, discovered a few days since in the northerly part =
of an extensive meadow=20

in this town, about ten rods from Deerfield river.  The soil on the spot is=
 alluvial, consisting of a dry,=20

rich, vegetable mould, with a large intermixture of sand; and the field, el=
evated 14 feet above the=20

bed of the river, is annually mowed. A valley encircles the ruptured spot o=
n the east, south, and=20

west, only five feet lower, yet so marshy and soft, as to render draining n=
ecessary to make it=20



passable; and immediately back of this valley, on the south, rises a hill 1=
00 feet high, at whose=20

foot are several springs. North of the rupture, also, between it and the ri=
ver, is a gradual descent of=20

three feet: indeed, the ground slopes from it on every side except the nort=
hwest.  A fissure one=20

inch wide and fourteen deep, forming an almost perfect ellipsis, whose diam=
eters are 9 and 5=C2=BD=20

rods, marks the exterior limit of the convulsion. Within this curve are sev=
eral others nearly=20

concentric to it, some forming a quarter, and some half an ellipsis, and ne=
ar the longer axis are=20

others, running in various directions. On this transverse diameter, which l=
ies near the highest part=20

of the swell above described, and in its longest direction, or parallel to =
the river, the greatest effect=20

of the convulsion appears. The earth, to the depth it has frozen the past w=
inter, 14 inches, is=20

broken on a=20


_
sight of the knife mark.  "I don't think they're here," he said to Mr. Stev=
ens. "As I remember it they=20

were bigger than these fellows."  The English master turned to Chuan Kai an=
d said, "We don't=20

intend to cause you any trouble. This young friend of mine has a mark on hi=
s shoulder which looks=20

like a knife. Two of your men acted strangely when they saw it. What can yo=
u tell me about it?=20

Don't be afraid to speak up."  Chuan Kai and his four employees looked at t=
heir American visitors=20

with every semblance of frank amazement and bewilderment.  "Well, we'll try=
 one thing more," said=20

Mr. Stevens. "Pull off your coat, Teeny-bits, and let them take a look at t=
hat mark."  Teeny-bits=20

quickly threw off his coat and unbuttoned the soft collar of his shirt unti=
l he could pull back the=20

linen and show the mark of the the south edge of the fissure, having been f=
orced up, overlaps the=20

other, three feet. Where one edge does not thus overreach, the tables of ea=
rth, which at a small=20

distance resemble masses of ice, are raised up so that their faces form an =
isosceles triangle,=20

leaving a cavity beneath. About the extremities of the transverse axis, is =
also an overlapping of=20

two feet, which continues nearly two rods on the curve each way from the ax=
is, and in most places=20

is double, overreaching internally and externally, exhibiting likewise, som=
e irregularity where the=20

compressing forces acted at right angles to each other. The edges of these =
elevated masses of=20

earth, which are yet frozen, are quite smooth, and the angles but little fr=
actured. I have dug into=20

the earth about four feet underneath the longer axis of the=20


_
knife. The effect was more than the English master or Teeny-bits expected. =
The four Chinese, who=20

had been observing in apparent astonishment this sudden performance on Teen=
y-bits' part, gazed=20

at the mark and began to jabber among themselves in a manner that showed pl=
ainly enough their=20

excitement and agitation. One of them even took a step nearer as if to obta=
in a clearer view.=20

Chuan Kai, however, quickly brought their demonstration to an end. He excla=
imed sharply in his=20

singsong language and stepped toward them in a manner that had only one mea=
ning,--a threat of=20

violence. Instantly the four Chinese resumed their work over the meat and t=
he kettles, and=20

although they rolled their black eyes furtively toward Teeny-bits and the i=
n other places, but cannot=20

perceive that the soil has been moved below where it was frozen. It is, how=
ever, not the most=20

favourable season for ascertaining this fact.  Every appearance on the spot=
 will justify this=20

conclusion, that the frozen surface of the earth around, has pressed with g=
reat force _from every=20

direction_ to this ellipsis as a centre; for, were every fissure in the ell=
ipsis to be filled by replacing=20

the earth, there must remain on its longer axis and at the extremities of t=
his, an overplus of surface=20

two feet wide.  The month of February last has been unusually cold. Its mea=
n temperature in=20

Deerfield, by Fahrenheit's scales, is as follows.    7_h._ A. M.     1=C2=
=BD_h._ P. M.     10_h._ P. M.=20

6=C2=B0=20
