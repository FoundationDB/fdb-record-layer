philodendron monstera useless are the words of wisdom from an old man to quell the rebellious spirit of the young.  Jean was on the watch. And evening after evening when the work on the farm was done, Pierre would sit in the small low room of the auberge and looked amiable, for well they knew the meaning of the word "breakfast" and the relative halt.  The sudden stoppage awoke the sleeper, and he struggled to rise.  "Hallo!  What's wrong?  Where am I?

century, and had been ready to burst into flames for the past decade.  Antoine Melun, the 

wheelwright, who was to have married Louise, Pierre's sister, had trapped a pair of pigeons in the 

woods of M. le duc de Kernogan. He had done it to assert his rights as exactly a servant of the 

house, but a sort of self-appointed hanger-on, or unpaid retainer.  For an Indian, he was of a 

cheerful disposition and made himself generally useful.  When they were outside, it was found that 

the gale had abated considerably, and

the pigeons. Though he was a poor man, he was no poorer than hundreds of peasants for miles 

around: but he paid imposts and taxes until every particle of profit which he gleaned from his 

miserable little plot of land went into the hands of the collectors, whilst M. le duc de Kernogan paid 

not one sou towards the costs of the State, and he had to live on what was left of his own rye and 

wheat after M. le duc's pigeons had had their fill of them.  Antoine Melun did not want to eat the 

pigeons which he had trapped, but he desired to let M. le duc de Kernogan know that God and 

Nature clouds which were driving wildly athwart the heavens, as though the elemental war which 

had ceased to trouble the earth were still raging in the sky.  "Peter," said the brother, as they stood 

for a moment beside two Indian sledges, one of which was laden with provisions, the other empty-

-"Peter, don't forget your promise.  Lay the whip on heavy. Nothing else will keep me awake!"  "All 

right!  Sit down there for a moment.  We're not quite ready yet."  "I'd better not.  No!  I will stand till 

it's time to start," returned Dan with a dubious shake of his head.  "Didn't you say you

never intended all the beasts and birds of the woods to be the exclusive property of one man, 

rather than another. So he trapped and killed two pigeons and M. le duc's head-bailiff caught him 

in the act of carrying those pigeons home.  Whereupon Antoine was arrested for poaching and 

thieving: he was tried at Nantes under the presidency of M. le duc de Kernogan, and ten minutes 

ago, while the man in the tattered coat was declaiming to a number of peasant lads in the coffee-

room of the auberge des Trois Vertus on the subject of their rights as men and citizens, some one 

brought the news that Antoine Melun had just been condemned to death and would  "Yes, I did, 

old boy."  "Does it look like trusting me to refuse the very first order I give you?  What an example 

to Okematan!  I am in command, Dan.  Do as you're bid, sir, and sit down."  With a faint smile, and 

a still more dubious shake of the head, Dan obeyed.  He sat down on the empty sledge and the 

expected result followed.  In a few seconds he was asleep.  "Now we'll pack him in tight," 

observed his brother, as he and the Indian stretched the sleeper at full length on the sledge, 

wrapped him completely up in the warm buffalo-robes, and lashed him down in such a way that he 

resembled a mummy, with nothing visible of him except his mouth

on the morrow.  That was the spark which had fanned Pierre Adet's hatred of the aristocrats to a 

veritable conflagration: the news of Antoine Melun's fate was the bleat which rallied all those 

human sheep around their leader. For Pierre had naturally become their leader because his hatred 

of M. le duc was more tangible, more powerful than theirs. Pierre had had more education than 

they. His father, Jean Adet the miller, had sent him to a school in Nantes, and when Pierre came 

home M. le cure of Vertou took an interest in him and taught him all he knew himself--which was 

not much--in the way of philosophy and the classics. But later on Pierre took to reading the 

writings of M. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and soon knew the _Contrat Social_ almost by heart. He 

had also read the  Four strong large dogs were attached to each sledge in tandem fashion, each 

dog having a little collar and harness of its own.  No reins were necessary.  A track beaten in the 

soft snow with his snow-shoes by the Indian, who stepped out in front, was guide enough for them; 

and a tail-line attached to the rear of each sledge, and held by the drivers, sufficed to restrain them 

when a stretch of hard snow or ice tempted them to have a scamper.  The road thus beaten over 

the prairie by Okematan, though a comparatively soft one, was by no means smooth, and the 

rough motion would, in ordinary circumstances, have rendered sleep impossible to our hero; but it 

need hardly be said that it failed to disturb him on the present occasion.  He slept like an infant

in M. Marat's newspaper _L'ami du Peuple!_ and, like Antoine Melun, the wheelwright, he had got 

it into his head that it was not God, nor yet Nature who had intended one man to starve while 

another gorged himself on all the good things of this world.  He did not, however, speak of these 

matters, either to his father or to his sister or to M. le cure, but he brooded over them, and when 

the price of bread rose to four sous he muttered curses against M. le duc de Kernogan, and when 

famine prices ruled throughout the district those curses became overt threats; and by the time that 

the pinch of hunger was felt in Vertou Pierre's passion of fury against the duc de Kernogan had 

turned to a frenzy of hate against the entire noblesse of France.  Still he said nothing to his cared 

nothing for the many plunges down the prairie waves, and recked not of the frequent jerks out of 

the hollows.  Hour after hour did Peter Davidson with his silent companion trudge over the 

monotonous plains--hope in the ascendant, and vigour, apparently, inexhaustible.  The dogs, too, 

were good and strong.  A brief halt now and then of a few minutes sufficed to freshen them for 

every new start. Night passed away, and daylight came in with its ghostly revelations of bushes 

that looked like bears or buffaloes, and snow-wreaths that suggested the buried forms of frozen 

men.  Then the sun arose and scattered these sombre visions of early morning with its 

gladdening, soul-reviving rays.  At this point the rescue-party chanced to have reached one of 

those bluffs of

But his father knew. Old Jean would watch the storm-clouds which gathered on Pierre's lowering 

brow; he heard the muttered curses which escaped from Pierre's lips whilst he worked for the 

liege-lord whom he hated. But Jean was a wise man and knew how useless it is to put out a feeble 

hand were few indeed and far between.  "Breakfast," said Peter, heaving a profound sigh as he 

turned about and checked the teams, for at that point he happened to be in advance beating the 

track.  Okematan expressed his entire concurrence with an emphatic "Ho!"  The wearied dogs lay 

down in
