extortion, and he would tell the jury that excessive damages might bear the=
 complexion of=20

meditated or of unconscious injustice.  The jury rose in their box, turned =
round face to face, had a=20

little to say to one another during perhaps two or three minutes' time, and=
 then returned a verdict=20

for the plaintiff, with 500_l._ damages.  The company was somewhat taken ab=
ack by the=20

largeness of these damages. The truth is, their case had not been got up so=
 patiently and carefully=20

as it might have been. A proper investigation into the antecedents and mode=
 of life of the plaintiff,=20

by any moderately intelligent lawyer's clerk, would have enabled them to la=
y such facts before the=20

jury as must have reduced his claim to less than one-fifth of the amount he=
 got,--if such inquiry=20

had not led the investigator into a track for entirely exploding the plaint=
iff's case.  The defendants,=20

as a random experiment, determined to move for a new trial in this case. A =
rule absolute for a new=20

trial was granted, upon condition that they brought into court enough money=
 to abide the event of=20

such new trial--that is to say, to cover damages and costs. The railway com=
pany had before now=20

derived immense advantages by delay, and were hopeful that time would bring=
 some advantage in=20

this case--as it did.  The success which had attended my investigations on =
former occasions in a=20

somewhat similar case or two, led to my being employed on the present.  I h=
ad not much difficulty=20

in effecting my object. I had several clues to the parties. I almost suspec=
ted, from the nature of the=20

case, that the affair was altogether a conspiracy to defraud the company--a=
nd I was right in my=20

suspicions.  The plaintiff had not been injured. The collision had taken pl=
ace some time before his=20

arrival on the spot. The principal guard of the train in which the collisio=
n took place was in the=20

swindle. He professed to telegraph on behalf of a passenger who had been so=
mewhat bruised to a=20

friend in London, which message (in order to divert suspicion) ran thus: "C=
ollision at B----. I am not=20

hurt. All right." Upon this hint the plaintiff hastily communicated with on=
e or two of his companions=20

in such frauds, and hastened down to the spot in a gig hired from a livery =
stable. The vehicle=20

deposited him about a mile from the place where the accident occurred, whic=
h had, in the mean=20

time, been ascertained with precision. The gig was then driven back by a co=
mpanion, and the=20

plaintiff slunk off to the margin of the line, and waited for an opportunit=
y to sigh and groan with=20

advantage.  The return home of Mr. Freeling, who had been seen by the watch=
ful swindler,=20

supplied the opportunity he wanted; and the plaintiff accordingly made the =
noises already=20

described, which attracted the attention of that gentleman. Of course the s=
coundrel knew that the=20

railway company would, as usual, send their doctor. He knew how to get over=
 that little difficulty.=20

He had his confederates, and he knew how to make the most of the unscrupulo=
us tactics of the=20

company in dealing with the real victims of railway collisions. He saw that=
 he could turn Dr.=20

Attrabilious's visit to good account by supplying it to Mr. Capulet Attic a=
s one of the pegs for an=20

oratorical display. The Dr. Jones who was sent for was a confederate. He be=
longed to the gang,=20

and of course would have shared the spoil. The nurse was also in the swindl=
e. The arrangement=20

for the division of the spoil remunerated her more liberally than nurses ar=
e generally paid for their=20

services. In fact the whole thing was a conspiracy.  I laid all these circu=
mstances before the=20

company's solicitors in my report. It was, however, resolved, as we had the=
 whole set clearly in our=20

grasp, not to arrest them immediately, but to await and but one has ever be=
en recorded west of=20

Dodge City, Kansas. It is not unknown in Europe, though far less common tha=
n with us, having=20

been noticed a few times in France. In general, it is so rare that a tornad=
o that passed through=20

Monville in 1845 attracted such attention as to be noticed in French text-b=
ooks on physics. To the=20



American, there is nothing unusual in the conduct of this storm.  Perhaps t=
he earliest detail of a=20

storm of this sort among us is that of a double one in South Carolina, on t=
he afternoon of May 2,=20

1761:  =E2=80=9CThe tornado crossed the Ashley River and swooped down upon =
the shipping at Rebellion=20

Wharf with such fury as to threaten the destruction of the entire fleet. Fr=
om the city, it was seen=20

coming at first rapidly toward Wappo Creek, like a column of smoke, with a =
very irregular and=20

tumultuous movement. The quantity of vapor which composed this column, and =
its prodigious=20

velocity, produced such intense commotion that it agitated Ashley River to =
its depths and left the=20

channel bare. The ebb and flow made the shipping float off to a great dista=
nce. When it struck the=20

river, it made a noise like continuous thunder; its diameter, at that momen=
t, was estimated at=20

fifteen hundred feet, and its height, as seen at Charleston,  [Illustration=
: TORNADO AT=20

MONVILLE.]  at twenty-five degrees. It was met at White Point by another wh=
irlwind, which=20

descended Cooper River, but was not equal to the first. When they came toge=
ther, the commotion=20

in the air was much greater still; the foam and the vapor seemed to be thro=
wn to the height of forty=20

degrees, while the clouds that hurried from all directions toward that poin=
t seemed to rush thither=20

and whirl about at one and the same time, with incredible velocity. The met=
eor then darted on the=20

shipping in the roadstead, and reached them in three minutes, although the =
distance was nearly=20

six miles. Out of forty-five vessels, five were sunk on the spot; the state=
 ship, Dolphin, and eleven=20

others were dismasted. The damage, estimated at more than =C2=A3200,000, wa=
s done in a moment,=20

and even the vessels that sank were swallowed up so rapidly that the people=
 who were below had=20

scarcely time to scramble up on deck. The whirlwind of Cooper River changed=
 the course of the=20

one that came from Wappo Creek, which, had it not been for that, would, pro=
ceeding in the same=20

direction, have swept away the city of Charleston before it like so much st=
raw.  =E2=80=9CThis terrible=20

column was first perceived about noon, at more than fifty miles southwest o=
f the roads. It=20

destroyed everything in its way, making a complete avenue when it passed th=
rough the woods.=20

The loss of the five ships was so sudden that it is not known whether it wa=
s the weight of the=20

column of wind, or the mass of water driven upon them that made them go dow=
n.=E2=80=9D  The tornado=20

occasionally originates at sea and whirls up a heavy column of water for a =
few feet, which,=20

meeting the dark funnel from above, presents the appearance of a pillar of =
water reaching the=20

clouds. Not a few ignorant people once imagined that all rain originated fr=
om the water thus=20

sucked up. These columns, or =E2=80=9Cwater-spouts,=E2=80=9D are generally =
a few feet in diameter, and may=20

sometimes be broken by firing a cannon-ball through them. They are not ordi=
narily considered=20

dangerous: but there are some exceptions, and it is not improbable that man=
y a ship that left port,=20

never to be heard of again, has been overwhelmed by some gigantic water-spo=
ut.  Of the most=20

destructive tornadoes in the United States, Mississippi records the two lea=
ding ones. The first=20

came on May 7, 1840, and Natchez was the principal sufferer, though other p=
ortions of Adams=20

county were swept. The day began warm and cloudy, with the wind south, veer=
ing to east. At=20


_
events, and see if the next combination of the gang for a like purpose did =
not reveal to us a few=20

more of its members. It did so. I discovered that the doctor in attendance =
upon a damaged railway=20

traveller in Lancashire, about two months afterwards, and the plaintiff in =
the first case, visited as=20

friends the intended plaintiff in the second place. Just as our plans were =
ripe for execution, we=20

were, however, forestalled by the arrest of five members of the dangerous c=
onfederacy on two=20

gigantic cases--one for forgery, and the rest for a great railway robbery, =
which had been suddenly=20

disclosed to the police authorities by a wretch who craved vengeance upon a=
n associate in the=20

gang because he had been successful in carrying off the affections of "a la=
dy" with whom the=20

informer had cohabited. Of these men captured, all were found guilty on the=
 strongest testimony,=20

got at through the informer by officers who laid traps under his guidance, =
and by surrounding=20

circumstances to which he had assisted them. One of the parties to my actio=
n--that is, the doctor--

made good his escape. I believe he went to America.     A PATRIOTIC BARBER =
IN FAULT   A few=20

years ago I was employed to watch "the other side" in a hotly contested ele=
ction. It was my first=20

engagement of the kind, and I sharpened my wits in order that I might fairl=
y earn my fee,--which=20

the reader may be glad to know was a handsome one. Perhaps he may also be p=
leased to learn=20

that I am an impartial man. It is true that, on the occasion I now speak of=
, I was employed by the=20

agent of the Liberal candidate; but I have, on other subsequent occasions, =
rendered service, and I=20

believe good service, to Conservative gentlemen who now wear the title of M=
.P. During the river=20

six or seven miles below the city, did not reach it until 2 P.M. The rush o=
f the wind did not last five=20

minutes, and the destructive blast only a few seconds. Houses were burst ou=
tward; three hundred=20

and seventeen persons were killed in the city and on the river. Sheet tin w=
as carried twenty miles,=20

and windows thirty miles. One hundred and nine persons were badly injured, =
and property to the=20

value of $1,260,000 destroyed. Most of the deaths resulted from drowning; t=
wo steamers and sixty=20

flatboats were sunk, while the city was flooded with nine inches of rain. E=
normous hail-stones fell.=20

A desk fastened with three locks, was blown open by the explosive force of =
the expanding air=20

within. Another curious freak of this expansive power occurred in a tornado=
 at New Brunswick. A=20

towel hanging on the wall was found apparently blown nearly through it. The=
 expanding air had=20

driven the towel in a large crevice which opened in the wall behind it; and=
 the crevice closed as the=20

storm passed on, holding the towel to puzzle the neighborhood.  The next gr=
eat tornado visited=20

Natchez, June 16, 1842, and killed five hundred people.  Next to these, in =
destruction of life, is the=20

famous  [Illustration: WATER-SPOUT AT SEA.]  Marshfield tornado of April, 1=
880, in which one=20

hundred and one persons were killed, and six hundred injured. The town of M=
arshfield was literally=20

wiped off the earth. This tornado is notable for its unusually wide path, a=
nd the large area=20

traversed. Four counties were swept; and though the country was sparsely se=
ttled and=20

comparatively little improved, yet the damage to property was estimated at =
more than $1,000,000.=20

Gen. Greely, of the Signal Service, pronounces it one of the most=20

place, as they always do at elections, and one of them I propose to relate.=
 By the way, there is=20

nothing which quickens human ingenuity like a vigorous electioneering strug=
gle. Wit, humour,=20

desperate practical joking, and ingenious stratagems, crowd in such excitin=
g profusion, that=20

sometimes the strict rules of moral propriety are hidden or get confused be=
fore the eyes of the=20

parties concerned. Sometimes I think I behaved unhandsomely towards the bar=
ber of whom I am=20

about to speak. At other times I think it served him right. The reader shal=
l decide between my first=20

and my second thoughts on this head.  In the borough of W---- there lived o=
ne John=20

Shufflebotham, a barber who earned a livelihood--that is to say, earned or =
got money to buy=20

scanty food, little raiment, plenty of beer, and a liberal supply of strong=
er waters for the=20

consumption of himself and Mrs. Shufflebotham--by the exercise of his trade=
, or "profession," as=20

he styled it, and it was believed in no other way. This barber had a reputa=
tion for shaving his=20

customers as clean as they could wish for a penny each--and he would do the=
 job at half the price=20

for junction of two streams, a few miles southwest of Marshfield; and, like=
 the South Carolina=20

tornado of 1761, owed its immense power to the union of two lesser storms t=
hat had traveled=20

down the valleys of the respective streams. Such a tornado passing over a g=
reat city would equal=20

the earthquake in disastrous effects. Perhaps a better idea of its power ma=
y be gathered from a=20

comparison with the New Haven storm of 1878, which killed but thirty-four p=
eople and destroyed=20

$2,000,000 worth of property--as much as the recent storm at Louisville. Th=
e remarkable feature=20

about every tornado--the very small destruction of life--may be better unde=
rstood when it is stated=20

that, excluding the two Natchez tornadoes, where the number of houses wreck=
ed is not known,=20

and the Louisville storm, the twenty most destructive tornadoes in the Unit=
ed States have killed six=20

hundred and thirteen people, and destroyed over three thousand houses. This=
 brings us to the=20

peculiar fact that but one person is killed in every five houses. As the av=
erage house may be=20

counted as containing four persons, it appears that the chances that any si=
ngle=20


_
rough and stubborn head of hair, popular tradition, and the tariff on his d=
oor-post, declared=20

threepence to be a fixed or immovable charge. This, however, was not the on=
ly character which=20

John Shufflebotham enjoyed. He was esteemed a man of principle; thoroughly =
incorruptible. Not a=20

breath of suspicion of his political honesty had ever been floated on the t=
urbid atmosphere of W----=20

at the most prying time--say just after the settlement of accounts between =
the "free and=20

independent voters" and the candidates. I was told that John one. While the=
 mathematical=20

calculation may be encouraging, yet few will care to take the risk of a tor=
nado, even though the=20

odds be vastly in their favor. People place little dependence in arithmetic=
 as a life preserver. The=20

recent Louisville storm presents a high average, as about fifty of the vict=
ims were taken from a=20

single building. The lowest average is shown by the tornado that struck Cam=
den, New Jersey,=20

August 3d, 1885, when five hundred houses were destroyed, and but six perso=
ns killed: one for=20

every eighty-three houses. In=20
