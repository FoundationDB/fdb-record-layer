dracaena marginata of his physician. It is, perhaps, needless to say that his wife attended on him mainly with her own hands, and would let none but the rudest offices be performed by any other person. Carriage rides, gentle railroad tracks, the Gautier plant, animals alive and dead, trees, lumber and infinite wreckage were rushed onward to be jammed and piled at the railroad bridge in a maze of ruin fifty feet high and covering dracaena marginata of his physician.

opinion upon it, and it was evident that he was not quite satisfied with it. It had, I dare say, 

weakened his suspicions, but it had not destroyed them. I was sorry for the imperfect result, but I 

could do no more than I had done for his satisfaction.  I often mused and reflected over this 

curious case. What could have given rise to these suspicions in the mind of such a man as Mr. 

Percival? I set it down to incompatibility of temper. He was a somewhat studious and retiring man. 

His wife, although as good a woman as ever drew breath, was a light and somewhat volatile 

person. In many respects, I argued, this is an incongruous union. I thought I saw inevitable misery 

for both husband and wife in the future.  About a year after I had finished my proper business with 

Mr. and Mrs. Percival, I was waited upon by an eminent London solicitor, who knew nothing of my 

former engagement, for the purpose of tracing the retreat of that gentleman, who had deserted his 

wife, and was hiding from all his friends. My visitor, the private solicitor of Mr. Percival, had not 

heard from him since or about his flight. It was not supposed that any violence had befallen him, 

although it was hard to say what harm might befall him. His physician had advised that he had 

been suffering from one of the thousand forms of one of the hundred branches of that disorder 

known by the familiar collective title of insanity. It was a mild and harmless type of the disease--a 

species of melancholia. The friends of the unfortunate gentleman were anxious to discover, and 

perhaps secretly watch over, him; at the worst, place him under gentle and temporary restraint. As 

he was known to be a man of high and honourable ambition--very likely to obtain and worthily fill a 

seat in Parliament, unless his prospects were marred--publicity, scandal, or gossip, on the subject 

of his bereavement, was to be deprecated.  I accepted this engagement, and I thought it desirable 

to let the solicitor know of the previous retainer given me by Mr. Percival, so that he might re-state 

the facts to the physician, who would thereby gain some insight into the secret of the gentleman's 

misfortune.  We had no clue to Mr. Percival's whereabouts. Certain facts led us to imagine he had 

not left this country; but I put myself in communication with the French and Belgian police, as the 

best mode of tracing him if he had crossed the sea. I had all the provincial papers filed at Peele's 

and Deacon's Coffee-houses critically scanned, so that if any harm befell him I should hear of it. 

This was a precaution I added to the through the second cut. Practically, therefore, the distribution 

of water made at two bends and cuts was only a little more than that which was made at one. Had 

there been no bends and railroad cuts between Conemaugh Lake and Johnstown; had the flood 

been confined for the entire distance to a single channel, then the towns below would have 

recognized no previous swell whatever; a single gigantic wall of water would have struck 

Johnstown as distinctly as it struck South Point; the inhabitants, in most cases, would not have 

had time even to reach their  [Illustration: MILL CREEK.]  upper stories; the wave, even more than 

it did, would have crushed as with the single blow of a mighty hammer, and the number of 

survivors who could tell a tale of wonderful deliverance would have been correspondingly 

diminished. The lesson of these facts is for those who dwell below dams or reservoirs. If there be 

nothing in the nature of the channel to distribute the water, and the rupture be instantaneous, the 

destruction of life and property will be awful to contemplate.  At the Gautier Works, the flood, while 

extending over all the valley, was yet parted into three principal divisions. One of these, following 

the course of the Conemaugh, rushed down against the foot of the hill, just above the Stone 

Bridge, and would have instantly swept away that magnificently solid structure, had it not stood 

parallel to, rather than at right angles with the torrent; another turning to the left, swept across 



Conemaugh Borough and the upper wards of Johnstown, destroying hundreds of stone buildings, 

the German Lutheran church, and the Hulbert House; while the third swept straight down through 

the middle of the city, demolishing the Y. M. C. A. Hall, the Municipal buildings, and scores of the 

finest residences. This last, turned into a reverse current by the damming of the water at the 

bridge, was presently rolled back, to ensure the destruction of whatever had escaped in its 

downward course.  Thousands of people, drifted from the towns above, were dead already, or still 

struggling in the water; and to these were now quickly added many thousands more. Of the people 

of Johnstown, it may be said that not a soul had time to fly. We hear nothing at all about escapes 

to the hills. At the scream of the warning whistle, some were startled, and looked up the river. 

According to their place in the town, they saw, at the distance of a mile, half a mile, or only a 

hundred yards away, an ominous and inexplicable dark cloud, which might be smoke or spray, 

hanging upon the surface of the 


_
usual police inquiry through the _Hue and Cry_.  One day I got intelligence through a West-of-

England paper that a gentleman, answering to the description of Mr. Percival, had been found 

wandering along the coast, in a state which indicated mental disorganisation. I lost no time in 

proceeding to the spot, with the doctor, and with Mrs. Percival, who insisted upon being of the 

party.  We claimed the poor man, who yielded himself up to our control like an infant. We brought 

him to London, and took apartments for him in a western suburb, so as to be out of the eye of 

gossips, and near to had taken place, but of its nature they were not well aware. Those who saw it 

at the greatest distance had hardly time to scramble to the upper stories of their dwellings, before, 

even there, they found themselves struggling in the water; while the vast majority, on looking forth, 

saw buildings, not a half block above them, already leaping from their foundations. Simultaneous 

with the roar and rush of the torrent, came the crash of houses, the shrieks and cries of men, 

women and children, the revolution of everything as in a kaleidoscope, and then, driven with the 

speed of a race-horse,
