prohibiting the officials of India House from receiving Indians into this kingdom: also instructions as 

to what they must do to forbid this traffic, under penalty of death, to ship captains and sailors, so 

that no one would dare to bring an Indian, nor allow one to be brought here. Let them know that 

they are forewarned in such cases.  Thinking there was nothing doubtful in the cedulas Your 

Highness sent for the departure of these religious I did not care to exhibit the cedula until the very 

end, in case we took besides the forty, an excess of stores, etc.  Now that I have shown it to the 

officials, they maintain that, as it does not expressly state that those above the number of forty 

should be provided for out of the funds of the dead, but from the money in the charge of the 

treasurers, they do not intend to provide for more than the forty, lest they should have to pay out of 

their own pockets.  I beseech Your Highness graciously to order this settled at once, so that we 

shall not be forced to leave behind the religious we hope to embark, in addition to the forty.  And 

let this be done soon, for we are only waiting for good weather.  The heavy rains which have fallen 

daily have prevented the launching of two or three of the vessels.  To-day the river from its source 

has abated.  Our Lord prosper and grant a long and happy life to Your Highness.  Amen.  Seville 

20th April 1544.  Your humble servant who kisses Your Royal hands.  To-night the following 

occurred--an Indian came to me complaining that notwithstanding his certificate of freedom, given 

him by Gregorio Lopez, his owner kept him in slavery and treated him worse than a slave, sending 

him out with a donkey to carry and sell water. He showed me his certificate of freedom, in the 

presence of ten or twelve monks.  I told him to go to-day to the Casa de Contractacion so that its 

Her mistress was lying senseless--I must go at once, and help her.  I took the little six-toed brat in 

my cloak, told my slavegirl to follow me with water, and soon found myself--as thou canst guess--

at the tomb of Assa's ancestors.  The poor woman, who lay there in convulsions, was his 

daughter-in-law Setchem.  The baby, a boy, was as sound as a nut, but she was evidently in great 

danger.  I sent the maid with the litter, which was waiting outside, to the temple here for help; the 

girl said that her master, the father of the child, was at the war, but that the grandfather, the noble 

Assa, had promised to meet the lady Setchem at the tomb, and would shortly be coming; then she 

disappeared with the litter. I washed the child, and kissed it as if it were my own.  Then I heard 

distant steps in the valley, and the recollection of the moment when I, lying at the point of death, 

had received that gift of money from Assa came over me, and then I do not know myself how it 

happened--I gave the new-born grandchild of Assa to my slave-girl, and told her to carry it quickly 

to the cave, and I wrapped the little six-toed baby in my rags and held it in my lap.  There I sat--

and the minutes seemed hours, till Assa came up; and when he stood before me, grown grey, it is 

true, but still handsome and upright--I put the gardener's boy, the six-toed brat, into his very arms, 

and a thousand demons seemed to laugh hoarsely within me.  He thanked me, he did not know 

me, and once more he offered me a handful of gold.  I took it, and I listened as the priest, who had 

come from the temple, prophesied all sorts of fine things for the little one, who was born in so 

fortunate an hour; and then I went back into my cave, and there I laughed till I cried, though I do 

not know that the tears sprang from the laughter.  "A few days after I gave Assa's grandchild to the 


_
correct the abuse, and I sent a servant with him to show him the building--because if his master 

found out, he would keep him until he called in the officials.  Finally his owner discovered him and 

took the letter and tore it up.  He said "bring chains and put them on this dog." The Indian escaped 

through a window and they cried after him, "Thief, thief," so that somebody down below came and 

beat him, and stabbed him in the jaw.  He managed to reach a place where some of my servants 

were, and they are trying to cure him: but he is dying.  One of my servants went to the assistant to 

tell him what had happened, but the latter answered that he was not astonished that people killed 

the Indians, because they stole and did much harm.  I beg Your Highness to note how destitute 

they are of any pity.  With judges so cruelly unjust and tyrannical, Your Highness may imagine 

what sort of things happen over there [in the colonies] with the Spaniards against the Indians, 

when they dare do these things in Seville where, the other day a judge ordered an Indian to be 

stabbed to death.  FRAY BARTHOLOMEW DE LAS CASAS, BISHOP OF CHIAPA.     The voyage 

began badly, for the _San Salvador_ was poorly ballasted and only arrived at Gomera, one of the 

Canary Islands, after considerable difficulty and danger, on the 19th of July, and was detained 

there for ten days until the ship was made seaworthy.  Some of the friars who were unfamiliar with 

sea-voyages conceived such mistrust of the _San Salvador_ that they refused to again go aboard 

her, so it was necessary to distribute these nineteen timid souls amongst the other ships. The 30th 

of July saw the fleet again at sea, and the voyage to Hispaniola continued without any untoward 

incident, until the 9th of September, when they arrived in the harbour of Santo Domingo, where the 

same vessel on which Las Casas and the twenty-seven friars were, ran on a rock and came near 

being wrecked in sight of land: hardly was this disaster surmounted when she collided with 

another of the ships to the imminent peril of both, though, fortunately, with no great injury to either. 

The Dominicans in Santo Domingo conducted the Bishop and his friars in solemn procession to 

the convent, where Te Deum Laudamus was sung.  In striking contrast to this affectionate 

reception was that which awaited him from the colonists.  The New Laws were regarded as the 

ruin of the colonies and Las Casas was universally considered the inspirer, if not actually the 

framer of these laws, hence the indignation and hatred of the Spaniards against him and all 

Dominicans was at fever heat: meetings were held, in which it was resolved to boycott the friars 

and refuse them all alms or assistance.  Seeing the odium he had unwittingly wrought upon his 

hosts, the Bishop was inclined to leave their convent and go to the Franciscans, but this was 

rightly considered as likely to spread the antagonism which had so far manifested itself against the 

Dominicans only. Even before things had reached this the sixth toe had come off; I had made a 

little wound on his foot to take in the bumpkin.  So Assa's grandchild, the son of the Mohar, grew 

up as the gardener's child, and received the name of Pentaur, and he was brought up in the 

temple here, and is wonderfully like Assa; but the gardener's monstrous brat is the pioneer 

Paaker.  That is the whole secret."  Ani had listened in silence to the terrible old woman.  We are 

involuntarily committed to any one who can inform us of some absorbing fact, and who knows how 

to make the information valuable. It did not occur to the Regent to punish the witch for her crimes; 

he thought rather of his older friends' rapture when they talked of the singer Beki's songs and 

beauty.  He looked at the woman, and a cold shiver ran through all his limbs.  "You may live in 

peace," he said at last; "and when you die I will see to your being embalmed; but give up your 

black arts.  You must be rich, and, if you are not, say what you need.  Indeed, I scarcely dare offer 



you gold--it excites your hatred, as I understand."  "I could take thine--but now let me go!"  She got 

up, and went towards the door, but the Regent called to her to stop, and asked:  "Is Assa the 

father of your son, the little Nemu, the dwarf of the lady Katuti?"  The witch laughed loudly.  "Is the 

little wretch like Assa or like Beki? I picked him up like many other children."  "But he is clever!" 

said Ani.  "Ay-that he is.  He has planned many a shrewd stroke, and is devoted to his mistress. 

He will help thee to thy purpose, for he himself has one too."  "And that is--?"  "Katuti will rise to 

greatness with thee, and to riches through Paaker, who sets out to-morrow to make the woman he 

loves a widow."  "You know a great deal," said Ani meditatively, "and I would ask you one thing 

more; though indeed your story has supplied the answer--but perhaps you know more now than 

you did in your youth.  Is there in truth any effectual love-philter?"  "I  will not deceive thee, for I 

desire that thou should'st keep thy word to me," replied Hekt.  "A love potion rarely has any effect, 

and never but on women who have never before loved.  If it is given to a woman whose heart is 

filled with the image of another man her passion for him only will grow the stronger."  "Yet 

another," said Ani.  "Is there any way of destroying an enemy at a distance?"  "Certainly," said the 

witch.  "Little people may do mean things, and great people can let others do things that they 

cannot do themselves. My story has stirred thy gall, and it seems to me that thou dost not love the 

poet Pentaur.  A smile!  Well then--I have not lost sight of him, and I know he is grown up as proud 

and as handsome as Assa.  He is wonderfully like him, and I could have loved him--have loved as 

this foolish heart had better never have loved.  It is strange!  In many women, who come to me, I 

see how their hearts cling to the children of men who have abandoned them, and we women are 

all alike, in most things. But I will not let myself

Prince Philip on the 15th of September, denouncing the cruelties which still went on unchecked 

and mentioning by name a number of officials who were unworthy to occupy the positions they 

held, because of the grave abuses they committed and tolerated.  On September 10th a letter 

which shows the state of public feeling towards the New Laws and the new Bishop was addressed 

to the Emperor by the principal colonists of Nicaragua.  The signers avow their surprise that their 

twenty-five or thirty years of services to the Crown should be rewarded by seeing their children 

disinherited, and declare that if the New Laws are put in force, despite their cries to high heaven 

for justice, it will only remain injure him, and help everyone that persecutes him; for though Assa is 

dead, the wrongs he did me live in me so long as I live myself. Pentaur's destiny must go on its 

course.  If thou wilt have his life, consult with Nemu, for he hates him too, and he will serve thee 

more effectually than I can with my vain spells and silly harmless brews.  Now let me go home!"  A 

few hours later Ameni sent to invite the Regent to breakfast.  "Do you know who the witch Hekt 

is?"  asked Ani.  "Certainly--how should I notknow?  She is the singer Beki--the former 

enchantress of Thebes.  May I ask what her communications were?"  Ani thought it best not to 

confide the secret of Pentaur's birth to the high-priest,

them to die.  Las Casas is denounced as an envious, vainglorious, and turbulent monk, who has 

been expelled from every colony in the Indies and whom even no monastery can tolerate.  He is 

charged with bringing ruin on large numbers of people, solely because revengeful motives prompt 

him to injure certain individuals.  It is also pointed out that he knows nothing about affairs in New 

Spain and the mainland, having spent all his life in Cuba and the islands.  However much Las 

Casas may have deplored the feeling his presence provoked and especially the rancour he had 

stirred up against his brethren, give him some information about the old woman, and how she had 

had a hand in the game; and he related to his hearer, with some omissions and variations--as if it 

were a fact he had long known--the very story which a few hours since he had overheard, and 

learned for the first time.  Ani feigned great astonishment, and agreed with the high-priest that 

Paaker should not for the present be informed of his true origin.  "He is a strangely constituted 

man," said Ameni, "and he is not incapable of playing us some unforeseen trick before he has 

done his part, if he is told who he is."   The storm had

only offence lay in giving him hospitality, he did not allow his regrets on this score to arrest or 

modify the steps he intended to take to enforce obedience to the New Laws. Shortly after his 

arrival, he presented copies of the laws and of the other royal ordinances which he carried, to the 

Audiencia, asking that, in accordance with their provisions, torn and flying clouds, cleared by 

degrees, as the morning went on; a sharp coolness succeeded the hot blast, but the sun as it 

mounted higher and higher soon heated the air.  On the roads and in the gardens lay uprooted 

trees and many slightly-built houses which had been blown down, while the tents in the strangers' 

quarter, and hundreds of light
