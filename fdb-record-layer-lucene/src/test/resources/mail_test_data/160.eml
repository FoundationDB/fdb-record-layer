and he warned her that she was doing too much, it was too soon after the bi=

building was to be free the first of May. Ethel went up to see it at once. =
And the arrangement of the=20

rooms, and the way the sun flooded into each one, made her exclaim with ple=
asure.  The present=20

tenants were a young widow and her companion, a most respectable elderly da=
me. The widow=20

was about Ethel's age and excessively pretty and stylish, and in her low sw=
eet voice and her=20

manner was a peculiar attractiveness that Ethel could not analyse. She expl=
ained that she was=20

going abroad, possibly to be gone a year, or she never would have given up =
into consultation in a=20

special case with a physician or surgeon residing in this State, nor does i=
t affect in any way the=20

laws in reference to the license tax (_ib._, s. 1,752) nor does it apply to=
 midwives (_ib._, s. 1,753).=20

FEES.=E2=80=94To the board of examiners, before examination, $5 (_ib._, s. =
1,747, as amended Act=20

1892, c. 70).  To the clerk of the court, for recording, same fee as for re=
cording a deed (_ib._, s.=20

1,749).   WASHINGTON.  EXAMINING BOARD.=E2=80=94The governor is required to=
 appoint a State=20

medical examining board of nine members, learned=20


_
than glad to show Ethel about, and displayed a friendly interest in her vis=
itor's eager planning.=20

When Ethel left at the end of an hour, the widow smiled at her and said, wi=
th a charming little=20

hesitation:  "I don't think you have my name. It's Mrs. Grewe. I do hope yo=
u'll come up whenever=20

you like, and let me help you all I can. I shall so love to feel when I go =
that you and your kiddies=20

will be here. I've noticed them so often, down-stairs and in the elevator. =
And they're both such=20

darlings."  And at that, with a thrill of pride, Ethel felt almost as thoug=
h she had found a friend in=20

the and theory of medicine and surgery (Act March 28th, 1890, s. 1).  The s=
aid board is required to=20

hold meetings for examination on the first Tuesday of January and July in e=
ach year, alternately in=20

western and eastern Washington at such places as the board may designate. T=
he board may call=20

special meetings when, in the opinion of a majority of the board, they are =
necessary. The board is=20

required to keep a record of all applicants for a license, with their ages,=
 the time spent in the study=20

and practice of medicine and surgery, and the name and location of all inst=
itutions granting to such=20


_
They saw each other frequently, for Ethel was always running in to look thr=
ough the various rooms=20

and puzzle and decide on curtains, rugs and portieres. In this she was aide=
d more than she knew=20

by the taste displayed in the furnishings, rich, subdued and yet so gay, th=
at young Mrs. Grewe had=20

collected here. The two had animated talks, and once when her new acquainta=
nce suggested, "I'd=20

be so glad if I could be of some help in your shopping," Ethel replied, "Oh=
, you could! I'd love to=20

have you!" And they started in that day.  And yet how curious, even here. F=
or whenever Ethel=20

endeavoured to get the conversation upon a little more intimate terms, Mrs.=
 Grewe would almost=20

instantly become evasive and remote. And once when Ethel asked of lectures =
in medicine or=20

surgery, and whether such applicant was rejected or licensed; and said regi=
ster is _prima facie_=20

evidence of all matters therein recorded (_ib._, s. 2).  QUALIFICATION.=E2=
=80=94Every person desiring to=20

commence the practice of medicine or surgery, or either of them, in any of =
their or its branches,=20

must make a written application to the board for a license, supported by an=
 affidavit of the=20

applicant, setting forth the actual time spent in the study of medicine and=
 surgery, and when;=20

whether such study was in an institution of learning and, if so, its name a=
nd location; if not in such=20

institution, where and under whose tutorship such study was prosecuted, the=
 time engaged in the=20

actual practice, if at all, of=20


_
almost with a start, as though she were saying, "Ha! Look out! I'm in dange=
r of letting you be a real=20

friend!" And thinking this over, Ethel reflected, "The only New Yorker I've=
 met so far, whom I'd like=20

to know, is nice to me simply because she is going abroad in a month and so=
 it's safe! Has she=20

offered to introduce me to a single friend of hers? Well, then, don't! Keep=
 your old friends! I don't=20

want to eat them!" And for days together she would leave the young widow al=
one.  But the latter=20

would make pleasant advances, and soon they would be shopping again. This a=
cquaintance was=20

one of the few bright spots in a season which for Ethel was full of anxious=
 worries. For it was by no=20

means easy. Amy had been a shopper who simply could not resist pretty thing=
s, and so her=20

apartment was crowded with furniture and bric-a-brac. "How much can I get r=
id of without=20

offending Joe?" asked Ethel. He was the kind of man who says nothing. He wo=
uld not object, but=20

he would feel hurt. It took the most careful probing to find how far she co=
uld safely go. And she=20

was tempted by the shops. In her smart town car, with plenty of money and w=
ith young Mrs.=20

Grewe at her side, it was almost impossible to of the applicant at the time=
 of the application, such=20

application and affidavit to be filed and preserved of record in the office=
 of the secretary of the=20

board. At the time and place designated by the board or at a regular meetin=
g of the board,=20

applicants must be examined in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, histology, m=
ateria medica,=20

therapeutics, preventive medicines, the practice of medicine, surgery, obst=
etrics, diseases of=20

women and children, of the nervous system, of the eye and ear, medical juri=
sprudence, and such=20

other branches as the board deem advisable. The examination must be both sc=
ientific and=20

practical, and of sufficient severity to test the candidate=E2=80=99s fitne=
ss to practise medicine and surgery,=20

by written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, questions and =
answers, and the same are=20

required to be filed and preserved of record in the said secretary=E2=80=99=
s office. After the examination, if=20

it be satisfactory, the board shall grant a license, by the consent of not =
less than five members,=20

except as hereinafter provided.  REFUSAL OR REVOCATION.=E2=80=94The board m=
ay refuse or revoke=20

a license for unprofessional or dishonorable conduct, subject to the right =
of appeal=20


_
wonder Amy bought too much." But there they were, all Amy's belongings, and=
 to be rid of each=20

table, each chair, each rug, meant the most careful thinking.  "Nevertheles=
s," she told herself.=20

"That apartment upstairs is to be my own home."  In the meantime her new oc=
cupation was=20

working out wonderfully as an excuse for not going about in the evenings. S=
he was so dead tired=20

every night. No need to feign fatigue, it was  =E2=80=9CUnprofessional or d=
