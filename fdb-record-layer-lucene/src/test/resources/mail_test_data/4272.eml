 upper-floor office. With all his suspicions of the morning reawakened, he =
dropped from the car, dashed into the building, and took the all-night elev=

 talk to you at random.  "The Red Sea is an _
envelope big enough."  Blount took up the letter opener and slipped the bla=
de under the flap of the=20

envelope. If he had looked up at the stenographer then he would have seen t=
he mask of=20

innocence slip aside to discover a face ashen with terror. But whatever the=
 shorthand man had to=20

fear from the opening of the lately sealed envelope was postponed by the in=
coming of Ackerton,=20

the working head of the legal department, with a damage suit to discuss wit=
h his chief. Blount=20

thrust the big envelope into his pocket unopened, and later in the day, whe=
n he went around to his=20

bank to put the evidence letters into his safe-deposit box, the incident of=
 the morning had lost its=20

significance so completely, or had been so deeply buried under other and mo=
re important matters,=20

that he deposited the packet without examining it.  The evening of this sam=
e day there was a=20

dance given by the Gordons in the ranchman candidate's big house opposite t=
he Weatherfords' in=20

Mesa Circle, and Blount went, hoping that Patricia would be there. She was =
there; and in the heart=20

of the evening, when Blount had persuaded her to sit out a dance with him i=
n a corner of the=20

homelike reception-hall, he began to pry at a little stone of stumbling whi=
ch was threatening to=20

grow too large to be easily rolled aside.  "I'm hunting a conscience to-nig=
ht," he said, without=20

preface. "Have you got one that you could lend me?"  She laughed lightly.  =
"You told me once that=20

I had the New England conscience--which was the same as saying that I had e=
nough for my own=20

needs and a surplus to pass around among my friends. What bad thing have yo=
u been doing=20

now?"  He made a wry face. "It's the 'practical politics' again. Suppose I =
say that I have obtained=20

positive evidence of a crime against the laws of the State and the nation. =
How far am I justified in=20

suppressing, for a perfectly right and proper end, this evidence which woul=
d send a lot of people to=20

jail?"  "Mercy!" she exclaimed; "how you can bring a thunderbolt crashing d=
own out of a perfectly=20

clear sky! Is it ever justifiable to shield criminals and criminality?"  "T=
hat is just what I'm trying to=20

find out," he persisted. "At the present moment I am shielding a good handf=
ul of open lawbreakers.=20

Some of them know what I'm doing, and some of them don't. Those who know ha=
ve been told that=20

they must be good or I'll publish the evidence, and they've promised to be =
good if I won't publish it.=20

At the time I didn't question my right to make such a bargain, but--"  "But=
 now you are questioning=20

it? What would happen if you should tell what you know?"  "Chaos," he repli=
ed briefly.  "May I ask=20

who is implicated?"  "A good half of the corporation officials in the State=
, and some few outside of=20

it."  "Mercy!" she said again. And then: "It's too big for me, Evan. I can =
only go back to first=20

principles and ask if it is ever justifiable to do evil that good may come.=
"  "If you put it that way, I've=20

made myself _particeps criminis_," he said gravely. "I have given my word t=
o keep still if the=20

lawbreaking deals are broken off at once and in good faith. Beyond that, I =
can't help knowing that=20

the exposure which I have threatened to make, and could make, would practic=
ally turn the people=20

of this State into a mob."  She was shaking her head determinedly. "I can't=
 help you this time,=20

Evan; truly I can't." Then, in ship-shape condition.  The space occupied by=
 Conference Hall had=20

been taken; but the captain had set the carpenter at work to extend the pro=
menade six feet aft,=20

and the work was completed before night. The carpet was laid, and the arm-c=
hairs removed to the=20

new Conference Hall. The awning overhead was to be lengthened out by the sa=
ilmakers among=20

the crew.  Mr. Shafter had always insisted that his force was too small, an=
d the captain admitted=20

the truth of his position. Felipe Garcias had stood on the books of the shi=
p as third engineer for=20

several months; and John Donald was made fourth engineer. The chief was ent=
irely satisfied with=20

the appointments. Pitts returned to his place on the forecastle as a seaman=
. The "Big Four" had=20



staterooms in the cabin. After all, the change was only the restoration of =
the old order of things=20

before the ship arrived at Gibraltar.  At daylight the next morning the Gua=
rdian-Mother hauled out=20

of the basin, and started on her voyage for the other extremity of the Red =
Sea.     CHAPTER XXVII=20

THE CONFERENCE ON THE PROMENADE   The promenade did not wholly change its n=
ame=20

after it became Conference Hall, and had been enlarged and improved. It was=
 as popular a resort=20

as it had ever been when the ship was under way and there was anything to b=
e seen. The place=20

was occupied when the ship hauled out of the basin in the early morning of =
January 19; for the=20

passengers had all asked to be called at five o'clock.  It seemed a little =
strange to go to sea=20

without the Maud astern, and with the principal members of her ship's compa=
ny seated with the=20

others on the promenade. The commander had engaged a pilot for the whole le=
ngth of the Red=20

Sea; for it is full of rocks and reefs, making the navigation difficult and=
 dangerous, though it has=20

been thoroughly surveyed, and the chart is speckled with small islands and =
coral reefs.  "I could=20

give you the Arabic names of some of the surroundings as we proceed," said =
the captain, who had=20

taken a position where he could observe the movements of the vessel, and it=
 enabled him to look=20

into the pilot-house through the after windows when he desired to do so.  "=
Please don't, Captain=20

Ringgold!" exclaimed Mrs. Belgrave. "It makes my jaws ache even to hear the=
m."  "But there are=20

some things which have no other names, and they must sometimes be used. Tha=
t buoy on the=20

starboard has no English name; but it is of no consequence, and I will not =
try to speak it. On the=20

opposite shore is the Gebel Ataka, which you have noticed before. By this t=
ime you have learned=20

that gebel is a mountain, and _jebel_, as you will find it on your map of t=
he Peninsula of Sinai,=20

means the same thing. _Ras_ is a cape. Formerly I knew many more words than=
 now; for it is very=20

easy to forget a foreign language."  "There is a lightship on the starboard=
," said Louis, who was=20

seated between his mother and Miss Blanche.  "That is the Zenobia, on Newpo=
rt Rock," added the=20

captain. "Now look to the shore on the left, which is called Abu Darraj. Pe=
rhaps you had better=20

write it down and remember it; for the people in this vicinity believe the =
Israelites crossed the Red=20

Sea where the ship is at this moment. The water was formerly very shallow h=
ere, and a passage=20

for vessels had to be dredged through it. Napoleon and some of his generals=
 were here, and tried=20

to cross over on horseback;=20


_
father? He could tell you what to do and how to do it, and his judgment wou=
ld be too big and just=20

to stumble over the tangling little moralities."  Blount smiled.  "What if =
I should tell you that my=20

father is more or less involved, Patricia? I don't know precisely how much =
or how little, but I am=20

assured, by those who claim to know, that he, too, would as it did Pharaoh =
and his army; the wind=20

changed, and the tide rolled in so that he was compelled to retreat."  Ther=
e was nothing more to=20

be explained, and the commander went to the pilot-house; but the air was de=
lightfully pleasant,=20

and the sun rising over the mountains of the peninsula was a beautiful sigh=
t. The ladies were in=20

raptures, and some of=20


_
general wreck."  "I can't believe it!" she protested, in generous loyalty. =
"These people, whoever=20

they are, are deceiving you to shelter themselves. Have you ever spoken to =
your father about=20

this?"  "Yes, once; one evening when we were dining together I told him wha=
t I had, and what use=20

I should make of it if all other means should fail. Also, I advised him to =
dodge."  "What did he say?"=20

"That is the discouraging part of it. I was hoping against hope that he wou=
ld tell me to go ahead;=20

that he would say that he wasn't involved. But, as a matter of fact, he did=
n't say much of anything.=20

I'm horribly afraid that his silence meant all that I've been trying to bel=
ieve it didn't mean."  She=20

was slowly opening and closing her fan, as if she were trying to gain time.=
  "I can only tell you=20

again what I told you at first," she said at length. "You must be bigger th=
an all these hampering=20

circumstances; bigger than the little moralities, if need be. You can be, E=
van; you've given=20

splendid proof of it thus far, and I'm proud--just as proud as I can be--" =
 Blount felt as if he could,=20

joyously and entirely without scruple, have brained young Gordon, to whom t=
he next dance=20

belonged, and who came just at this climaxing moment to claim Patricia. But=
 there was no help for=20

it, short of a cold-blooded and rather embarrassing deed of violence, and t=
he hard-won confidence=20

ended pretty much where it had begun.  When he left the Gordon house, which=
 was far out in the=20

northeastern residence suburb, Blount meant to go directly to the hotel and=
 to bed. He had been=20

losing much sleep in the activities of the campaign, and the loss was begin=
ning to tell upon him.=20

But as the trolley-car was passing the Temple Court Building boys left thei=
r seats, and walked=20

about the upper deck. Then Miss Blanche thought she had better walk for a t=
ime before breakfast,=20

and very soon the whole party were occupied in the same manner. The command=
er had=20

appointed a conference at nine o'clock, and several interesting subjects we=
re to be considered.=20

Captain Ringgold was not disposed to drive his ship at her best speed, whic=
h was over sixteen=20

knots an hour; but he had instructed Mr. Shafter, the chief engineer, to gi=
ve her about fourteen=20

knots, for she was more comfortable at this rate than when forced to do her=
 utmost, to say nothing=20

of the saving of coal. At this rate she would arrive at Bombay in ten days,=
 including a stop of one=20

day at Aden. In this time he expected to accomplish a great deal in the sch=
ool of the conference.=20

The weather was fortunately all that could be desired, though the Red Sea s=
ometimes behaves=20

very badly; and at the time appointed the members of the party were all in =
their places on the=20

promenade. The little table, with its vase of flowers brought from the gard=
ens of the Terreplein,=20

was in position. Mr. Woolridge was one of the first to take his arm-chair. =
He had at first been rather=20

indifferent in regard to the instruction element of the ship, but had becom=
e quite interested since=20

he had been called to the platform as a speaker.  The commander was the fir=
st to take the=20

platform; and he appeared with a rose in the lappel of his coat, which prob=
ably would not have=20

been there if Mrs. Belgrave had not placed it there. She was very fond of f=
lowers, and had=20

arranged quite a collection of potted plants, as well as filled all the vas=
es on board with cut flowers=20

from the village.  "The subject first in order seems=20
