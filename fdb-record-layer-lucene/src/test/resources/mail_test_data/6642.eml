around the country joked in a nasty way about it. Whenever I saw her come u=
p the furrow,=20

shouting to her beasts, sunburned, sweaty, her dress open at the neck, and =
her throat and chest=20

dust-plastered, I used to think of the tone in which poor Mr. Shimerda, who=
 could say so little, yet=20

managed to say so much when he exclaimed, "My An-tonia!"     XVIII   AFTER =
I began to go to the=20

country school, I saw less of the Bohemians. We were sixteen pupils at the =
sod schoolhouse, and=20

we all came on horseback and brought our dinner. My schoolmates were none o=
f them very=20

interesting, but I somehow felt that by making comrades of them I was getti=
ng even with Antonia=20

for her indifference. Since the father's death, Ambrosch was more than ever=
 the head of the house=20

and he seemed to direct the feelings as well as the fortunes of his women-f=
olk. Antonia often=20

quoted his opinions to me, and she let me see that she admired him, while s=
he thought of me only=20

as a little boy. Before the spring was over, there was a distinct coldness =
between us and the=20

Shimerdas. It came about in this way.  One Sunday I rode over there with Ja=
ke to get a horse-

collar which Ambrosch had borrowed from him and had not returned. It was a =
beautiful blue=20

morning. The buffalo-peas were blooming in pink and purple masses along the=
 roadside, and the=20

larks, perched on last year's dried sunflower stalks, were singing straight=
 at the sun, their heads=20

thrown back and their yellow breasts a-quiver. The wind blew about us in wa=
rm, sweet gusts. We=20

rode slowly, with a pleasant sense of Sunday indolence.  We found the Shime=
rdas working just as=20

if it were a week-day. Marek was cleaning out the stable, and Antonia and h=
er mother were=20

making garden, off across the pond in the draw-head. Ambrosch was up on the=
 windmill tower,=20



oiling the wheel. He came down, not very cordially. When Jake asked for the=
 collar, he grunted=20

and scratched his head. The collar belonged to grandfather, of course, and =
Jake, feeling=20

responsible for it, flared up.  "Now, don't you say you have n't got it, Am=
brosch, because I know=20

you have, and if you ain't a-going to look for it, I will."  Ambrosch shrug=
ged his shoulders and=20

returned, carrying a collar=20

that had been badly used--trampled in the dirt and gnawed by rats until the=
 hair was sticking out of=20

it.  "This what you want?" he asked surlily.  Jake jumped off his horse. I =
saw a wave of red come=20

up under the rough stubble on his face. "That ain't the piece of harness I =
loaned you, Ambrosch; or=20

if it is, you've used it shameful. I ain't a-going to carry such a looking =
thing back to Mr. Burden."=20

Ambrosch dropped the collar on the ground. "All right," he said coolly, too=
k up his oil-can, and=20

began to climb the mill. Jake caught him by the belt of his trousers and ya=
nked him back.=20

Ambrosch's feet had scarcely touched the ground when he lunged out with a v=
icious kick at Jake's=20

stomach. Fortunately Jake was in such a position that he could dodge it. Th=
is was not the sort of=20

thing country boys did when they played at fisticuffs, and Jake was furious=
. He landed Ambrosch a=20

blow on the head--it sounded like the crack of an axe on a cow-pumpkin. Amb=
rosch dropped over,=20

stunned.  We heard squeals, and looking up saw Antonia and her mother comin=
g on the run. They=20

did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water,=
 without even lifting=20

their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Amb=
rosch had come to his=20

senses and was sputtering with nose-bleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. "Le=
t's get out of this,=20

Jim," he called.  Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched =
as if she were going=20

to pull down lightning. "Law, law!" she shrieked after us. "Law for knock m=
y Ambrosch down!"  "I=20

ny more!"  Jake=20

the fine morning was=20

spoiled for us. I had n't a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper a=

made him sick to get so angry. "They ain't the same, Jimmy," he kept saying=
 in a hurt tone. "These=20
