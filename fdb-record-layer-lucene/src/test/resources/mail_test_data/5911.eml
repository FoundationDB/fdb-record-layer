ay, that the person who drew up this=20

register assigns two different dates for the death of Monstrelet, and in th=
is he has been followed by=20

John le Robert. Both of them say, that Monstrelet died on the 20th of July,=
=E2=80=94and, a few lines=20

farther, add, that he died about sixteen days before peace was concluded be=
tween duke Philip=20

and Ghent, which was signed about the end of the month: it was, in fact, co=

 I therefore think, that one of=20

these dates must mean the day of his death, and the other that of his funer=

Monstrelet died on the 15th and was buried on the 20th. The precise date of=
 his death is, however,=20

of little importance: it is enough for us to be assured, that it took place=
 in the month of July, in=20

1453, and consequently that the thirteen last years of his history, printed=
 under his name, cannot=20

have been written by him. I shall examine this first continuation of his hi=
story, and endeavour to=20

ascertain the time when Monstrelet ceased to write,=E2=80=94and likewise at=
tempt to discover whether,=20

during the years immediately preceding his death, some things have not been=
 inserted that do not=20

belong to him.  =E2=80=98Before I enter upon this discussion of his work, I=
 shall conclude what I have to say=20

of him personally, according to what the writer of the register of the Cord=
eliers and the abbot of St=20

Aubert testify of him. He was, says each of them, =E2=80=98a very  And may =

or abandoning a dead=20

when those of Froissart end, and extend to the death of the duke of Burgund=
