War   By  C.G. Woodson.  1919     PREFACE   About two years ago the author =
decided to set=20

forth in a small volume the leading facts of the development of Negro educa=
tion, thinking that he=20

would have to deal largely with the movement since the Civil War. In lookin=
g over documents for=20

material to furnish a background for recent achievements in this field, he =
discovered that he would=20

write a much more interesting book should he confine himself to the ante-be=
llum period. In fact,=20

the accounts of the successful strivings of Negroes for enlightenment under=
 most adverse=20
