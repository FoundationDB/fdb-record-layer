to a climax. The policy pursued against the Indians was severe, and yet the=
re was no proper=20

protection afforded by the government; war was declared against them in 167=
6, and then the=20

forces sent out were suddenly disbanded by the governor, Berkeley. At last =
there was a popular=20

rebellion, which included almost all the civil and military officers of the=
 colony, and the rebellious=20

party put Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., a recently arrived but very popular planter=
, at their head. He=20

marched with five hundred men against the Indians, but was proclaimed a tra=
itor by the governor,=20

whom Bacon proclaimed a traitor in return. The war with the savages became =
by degrees quite=20

secondary to the internal contests among the English, in the course of whic=
h Bacon took and=20

burned Jamestown, beginning, it is said, with his own house; but he died so=
on after. The=20

insurrection was suppressed, and the Indians were finally quieted by a trea=
ty.  Into all the Indian=20

wars after King Philip=E2=80=99s death two nationalities besides the Indian=
 and English entered in an=20

important way. These were the Dutch and the French. It was the Dutch who, s=
oon after 1614, first=20

sold firearms to the Indians in defiance of their own laws, and by this mea=
ns greatly increased the=20

horrors of the Indian warfare. On the other hand, the Dutch, because of the=

These tribes, the Cayugas, Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, and Senecas--afterw=
ard joined by=20

the Tuscaroras--held the key to the continent. Occupying the greater part o=
f what is now the State=20

of New York, they virtually ruled the country from the Atlantic to the Miss=
issippi and from the Great=20

Lakes to the Savannah River. They were from the first treated with great co=
nsideration by the=20

Dutch, and they remained, with brief intervals of war, their firm friends. =
One war, indeed, there was=20

under the injudicious management of Governor Kieft, lasting from 1640 to 16=
43; and this came=20

near involving the English colonies, while it caused the death of sixteen h=
undred Indians, first or=20

last, seven hundred of these being massacred under the borrowed Puritan lea=

the Iroquois and the=20

Dutch.  When New Netherlands yielded to the English, the same alliance was =
retained, and to this=20

we probably owe the preservation of the colonies, their union against Engla=
nd, and the very=20

existence of the present American nation. Yet the first English governor, C=

alliances. =E2=80=9CWhen the Dutch held this country,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=
