"How good of you, dear Miss Egerton; let me see it at once. Real Spanish lace is of great value. 

Oh, and white, too! What lovely flounces!"  "The lady to whom they belonged know nothing of their 

real value; she was disposing of both shawl and flounces yesterday evening for ten shillings." 

"Oh, Miss Egerton! oh, poor, poor thing! I will gladly give her fifty pounds for them."  Miss Egerton 

coughed, and colored slightly.  "The fact is," she said, "I do not think she ought to sell them; they 

are mementoes, and belonged to her mother. Mrs. Ellsworthy, I won't deceive you any longer. This 

lace is now the property of Jasmine Mainwaring. She took it to a pawnshop last night, and but for

have absolutely given it away; I was just in time to redeem it. Now the fact is, I happen to know 

that Primrose does not wish this lace to be sold; I offered, long ago, to find a purchaser for it, but 

she looked terribly distressed at the idea. What I should like to do would be this; in short, in short--I 

do not quite know how to put it--"  "I know, I know," said Mrs. Ellsworthy, clapping her hands, "you 

want me to be a pawnbroker, and to lend money on it. I will, I will, with pleasure; oh, this is quite a 

fresh and delightful idea."  "Give me ten pounds to help the poor child over her present difficulties," 

said Miss Egerton, tears in her eyes. "Yes, ten pounds is quite enough. I will not take a penny 

more."  "Now, Mrs. Ellsworthy, as we have comfortably disposed of this little matter, I want to talk 

to you most seriously about the girls."  Mrs. Ellsworthy bent her head to listen with rapt attention; 

and the two women were engaged for a couple of hours in most earnest conversation.  That 

afternoon, when Jasmine, very weary and very depressed, toiled up the stairs to her Palace 

Beautiful, she found two letters awaiting her. One was from Primrose, containing very cheerful 

news about Daisy. Daisy was really getting better, and had even been out for a few minutes. The 

other letter had not come by the post, and Jasmine wondered who her correspondent could be. 

She opened it eagerly. It contained a folded sheet of paper, out of which dropped two crisp Bank 

of England notes for five pounds each. The sheet of paper itself contained the following words:-- 

"DEAR JASMINE:--I have found a pawnbroker who better understands the value of your old lace. I 

have borrowed ten pounds for you on it, with liberty for you to redeem the shawl and flounces at 

your convenience. You can pay me back the ten shillings I lent you last night when you get 

change; but there is no hurry. Come and have tea this evening at six, dear. I have much to talk 

over with you.       "Your affectionate friend,      "AGNES EGERTON."  Poor little Jasmine's delight 

can scarcely be conceived. She found it an easy matter to change one of the notes, and Poppy 

was in possession of the balance of her money long before the evening. Her radiant face seemed 

scarcely to belong to the same girl when she entered Miss Egerton's room in time for that good 

lady's tea.  "Jasmine," said Miss Egerton, when the meal was over, and Jasmine had exhausted 

her many expressions of rapture, and astonishment, and gratitude, "I have news to tell you. That 

dreadful man Dove has received a long term of imprisonment. He won't trouble our dear little 

Daisy again."  "And Daisy is beginning to get better," said Jasmine. "I heard from Primrose to-day, 

and she wrote quite hopefully about her. Yes, I suppose I am glad that Mr. Dove is locked up; it 

was so very wicked of him to frighten our little pet."  "I also had a letter from Primrose," said Miss 

Egerton. "She is unhappy because she thinks that I am at personal inconvenience for the money 

which I lent her instead of that which Dove stole. I am not inconvenienced for it--I can never regret

smooth for you poor children. I am going to write to Primrose to-night; but before I do so I should 

like to have a little talk with you, Jasmine."  "Oh, yes," said Jasmine, "I feel very humble to-night, 

and very thankful. I am in the kind of humor to-night when I could listen to any amount of good 

advice."  "Notwithstanding, Jasmine," said Miss Egerton, with a slight smile, "that advisers are 

never considered the most agreeable people. Jasmine, dear, I have seen Mrs. Ellsworthy to-day." 

"Our darling Mrs. Ellsworthy," said Jasmine, flushing brightly; "and how was she? Does she know 

that I still care for her?"  "I think she does, Jasmine, and undoubtedly she cares for you. She again
