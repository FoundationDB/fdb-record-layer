illumined the small farmery and the mill and the slowly moving mass of men =
along the narrow=20

road, whilst clouds of black, dense smoke were tossed about by the gale. Pi=
erre walked with head=20

erect. He ceased to think of his father and he never looked back to see if =
the others followed him.=20

He knew that they did: like the straw-ricks a while ago, they had become th=
e prey of a consuming=20

fire: the fire of their own passion which had caught them and held them and=
 would not leave them=20

now until their ardour was consumed in victory or defeat.   IV  M. le duc d=
e Kernogan had just=20

finished dinner when Jacques Labruniere, his head-bailiff, came to him with=
 the news that a rabble=20

crowd, composed of the peasantry of Goulaine and Vertou and the neighbourin=
g villages, had=20

assembled at the cross-roads, there held revolutionary speeches, and was ev=
en now marching=20

toward the castle still shouting and singing and brandishing a miscellaneou=
s collection of weapons=20

chiefly consisting of scythes and axes.  "The guard is under arms, I imagin=
e," was M. le duc's=20

comment on this not altogether unforeseen piece of news.  "Everything is in=
 perfect order," replied=20

the head-bailiff cooly, "for the defence of M. le duc and his property--and=
 of Mademoiselle."  M. le=20

duc, who had been lounging in one of the big armchairs in the stately hall =
of Kernogan, jumped to=20

his feet at these words: his cheeks suddenly pallid, and a look of deadly f=
ear in his eyes.=20

"Mademoiselle," he said hurriedly, "by G--d, which remains a mystery till a=
ltogether forgotten.=20

Nevertheless Nemesis was on the wing.  While Duncan McKay junior was thus p=
ushing his way=20

over the plains in the direction of Red River Settlement, two poor half-bre=
ed women were toiling=20

slowly over the same plains behind him, bound for the same haven of hoped-f=
or and much-needed=20

rest and refreshment.  The poor creatures had been recently made widows.  T=
he husband of one,=20

Louis Blanc, had been killed by Indians during this hunt; that of the other=
, Antoine Pierre, had met=20

his death by being thrown from his horse when running the buffalo.  Both wo=
men were in better=20

condition than many of the other hunters' wives, for they had started on th=
e homeward journey=20

with a better supply of meat, which had not yet been exhausted.  It happene=
d that Marie Blanc and=20

Annette Pierre came upon McKay's camp soon after he left it the second time=
.  Here they=20

prepared to spend the night, but, on discovering marks of fresh blood about=
, they made a search,=20

and soon came on the unburied corpse of the murdered man, lying behind a bu=
sh.  They=20

recognised it at once, for Perrin had been well-known, as well as much like=
d, in the Settlement.=20

Neither of the women was demonstrative.  They did not express much feeling,=
 though they were=20

undoubtedly shocked; but they dug a hole in the snow with their snow-shoes,=
 and buried the body=20

of the hunter therein--having first carefully examined the wound in his bre=
ast, and removed the=20

poor man's coat, which=20


_
forgotten--momentarily----"  "M. le duc?" stammered the bailiff in anxious =
inquiry.  "Mademoiselle=20

de Kernogan is on her way home--even now--she spent the day with Mme. le Ma=
rquise=20

d'Herbignac--she was to return at about eight o'clock.... If those devils m=
eet her carriage on the=20

road...."  "There is no cause for anxiety, M. le duc," broke in Labruniere =
hurriedly. "I will see that=20

half a dozen men get to horse at once and go and meet Mademoiselle and esco=
rt her home...."=20

"Yes ... yes ... Labruniere," murmured the duc, who seemed very much overco=
me with terror now=20

that his daughter's safety was in jeopardy, "see to it at once. Quick! quic=
k! I shall wax crazy with=20

anxiety."  While Labruniere ran to make the necessary arrangements for an e=
fficient escort for=20

Mademoiselle de Kernogan and gave the sergeant in charge of the posse well =
as a hole in the=20

back, for the bullet had gone quite through him.  Then they returned to the=
 camp, and made a=20

careful examination of it; but nothing was found there which could throw li=
ght on the subject of who=20

was the murderer.  Whether a comrade or an Indian had done the deed there w=
as nothing to=20

show; but that a murder had been committed they could not doubt, for it was=
 physically almost=20

impossible that a man could have shot himself in the chest, either by accid=
ent or intention, with=20

one of the long-barrelled trading guns in use among the buffalo-hunters.  A=
nother point, justifying=20

the supposition of foul play, was the significant fact that Perrin's gun, w=
ith his name rudely carved=20

on the stock, still lay in the camp _undischarged_.  "See--here is somethin=
g," said one woman to=20

the other in the Cree tongue, as they=20


_
huddled up in the capacious armchair, his head buried in his hand, shiverin=
g in front of the huge=20

fire which burned in the monumental hearth, himself the prey of nameless, o=
verwhelming terror.=20

He knew--none better--the appalling hatred wherewith he and  She held up a =
knife which she had=20

found half buried near the fire.  "It is not a common scalping-knife," said=
 the other woman.  "It is=20

the knife of a settler."  The weapon in question was one of the large sheat=
h-knives which many of=20
