At length early on the 15th, at four o'clock, came our first attack. After =
a preliminary smoking-out=20

with gas, our artillery got to work, and about ten o'clock we climbed out o=
f the trenches and=20

advanced fifty metres in the hail of bullets. Here I got my first shot thro=
ugh the coat. Three=20

comrades were killed at the outset of the assault, and some twenty slightly=
 or severely wounded,=20

but we had obtained our object. The trench was ours, although the English t=
wice attempted to turn=20

us out of it.  The fight went on till eleven o'clock that evening. We were =
then relieved by the 10th=20

Company, and made our way back along of silex, commonly called burrstone. I=

examined by several practical millers, who do not hesitate to pronounce the=
 specimens which it=20

affords, equal, if not superior, to the French burrs. The locality is twent=
y acres in extent, and=20

appears to be inexhaustible. The mineral varies very much in its appearance=
; it is generally=20

porous, and appears to have been puffed up by the escape of some gas, while=
 it was in a state of=20

fusion. A mass of well-raised bread gives no inadequate idea of its configu=
ration. It produces most=20

passing two days without sleep. We were hardly able to get our meals. From =
every side firing was=20

going on, and shots came plugging two metres deep into the ground. This was=
 my baptism of fire.=20

It cannot be described as it really is--something like an earthquake, when =
the big shells come at=20

and comfortable seemed our road back to the size of the siliceous rocks, th=

necessity of constructing them of detached masses. They form, of a single r=
ock, millstones of five=20

and a half feet in diameter, which are not defaced by any irregularity, or =
even earthy cavity. These=20

millstones may be carried down the White, Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi riv=
ers, to New-Orleans,=20

with great facility. And if they should prove as excellent as it is expecte=

the night an alarm. Our=20

neighbors had allowed themselves to be driven out of our hard-won position,=
 and the 6th=20

rable distance upon the=20

banks of a small stream, called Leather-wood creek: the bottom of the creek=
 was covered, the=20

and wounded lay on=20
