Wolcott Norris. He opened his lips to speak, but no sound came from them. F=
or the moment his=20

thoughts were too full to find expression in words.  "It seems--" he said u=
nsteadily after a time, "like=20

something I've been dreaming, and now I know why I've had such a strange fe=
eling toward you--

just as if you were my older brother--or my--my father. To-morrow when Neil=
 and I go back to=20

Ridgley, will you come?"  "Yes, Teeny-bits, I'll come," said Wolcott Norris=
, "and we'll go over to=20

Greensboro and have a talk with those Chinese that Neil told me about."  Te=
d Norris jumped to his=20

feet as if he had suddenly come out of a trance. "By thunder!" he cried, "m=
y head is swimming=20

round in circles, but I've just enough of a grip on my brains to see that y=
ou and I--that we--oh,=20

shucks!--put it there!" And the big fellow thrust out his hand to Teeny-bit=
s.  Next day the Norris=20

cabin at Pocassett was closed. Ted Norris went back to Jefferson and the ot=
her three traveled on=20

toward Ridgley School. At the Greensboro station Teeny-bits and Wolcott Nor=
ris left the train and=20

made their way to the Eating Palace of Chuan Kai. There the mining engineer=
, who knew how to=20

talk to an Oriental, very quickly discovered that the proprietor of the est=
ablishment was a native of=20

the Honan Province; that Shanghai and the Yangtse and Tung-sha were places =
not unknown to=20

them, and then suddenly he put the question the formations which he has wel=
l described, the=20

terms _transition_ and _secondary_, which there can be little doubt do in f=
act belong to them. His=20

strata of highly inclined limestone, appear to belong to the transition cla=
ss of Werner, and his flat=20

strata, to the secondary. It may be observed in this place, that the specim=
ens alluded to in the text=20

(passim,) appear to be correctly described by Mr. Cornelius, and to justify=
 his geological=20

inferences as far as hand-specimens seen at a distance from their native be=
ds, can form a safe=20

basis for general geological inductions. _Editor._  [32] Copied partly from=
 Manuscripts of the late=20

Dr. Muhlenberg, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  [33] This large species I unde=
rstand has been=20

mistaken by a writer on Natural History for _Boa constrictor_: this is ment=
ioned to show how=20

remotely it is possible to diverge from accuracy in this science.  [34] I h=
ave been since informed by=20

Mr. Lesueur, that to his taste the poison was bitter.  [35] The terminal ca=
udal plates of this=20

individual were bifid, as in the one of Peale's Museum.  [36] This last is =
the animal, beyond a=20

doubt, judging from the detailed description and plate, which has lately be=
en erected into a new=20

had been leading the conversation. When Chuan Kai had left China was Red Kn=
ife, the robber,=20

alive? Chuan Kai started at the name and answered quickly:  "He is a devil!=
 He will never die."=20

"And that was why your men acted strangely when they saw the mark on the yo=
ung man's=20

shoulder? They are from your region, too, and they know Red Knife's mark. I=
t any one tolerably=20

versed in the science, should proof be thought necessary.  [37] Dr. Barton =
remarked that this part=20

is rounded, (cauda teres,) this observation was not autoptical, but dictate=
d most probably by the=20

appearance of Catesby's figure. In the young animal the tail is less compre=
ssed than in the old=20

this side of the world. That's all right. We've learned all we wish to know=
 and you need have no=20

fear, Chuan Kai, that any harm will come to you."  The Oriental had shown c=
learly that the mining=20

engineer had hit upon the truth; there was no necessity of wasting more tim=
e in and pavements of=20

cities, &c. on which the materials being minutely divided by attrition, are=
 in a better state for the=20

sun to act freely on, and will consequently yield greater products than equ=
al areas of undisturbed=20

surface, under like circumstances of heat.  [39] Perhaps=20
