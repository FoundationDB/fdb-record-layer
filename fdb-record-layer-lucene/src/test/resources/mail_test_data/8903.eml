 puzzled and confused his sapient aids, that functionary gave it as his opi=

idly, the whole may be balanced on the peg: when the frame will begin to sl=

 illustrations of this principle are even more familiar than the spinning o=

He also ventured to tell the jury that they had better, perhaps, find what =
a top. If the wheel be made to revolve rapidly, the whole may be balanced o=
n the peg: when the frame will begin to slowly revolve in the opposite dire=
ction: and if placed upon a smooth level surface, like the top it will tend=
 to describe the same course.  Still other illustrations of this principle =
are even more familiar than the spinning of a top. Any one who has seen the=
 game of _
should encroach too rapidly on his accumulated profits, had hit upon the Tu=
rkish expedient for=20

thinning families; using, in this case, the hand of his dishonoured servant=
 to carry out his infamous=20

design.  The surgeon who made a post-mortem examination--a man by no means =
unskilful in his=20

profession--who declined to say whether the inclination of his belief favou=
red the theory of an=20

accidental death or of wilful murder, did, however, upon the peg of the top=
 be blunt or round, so=20

that there will be no tendency to settle steadily into some possible hole o=
r depression.  Now, the=20

instant any degree of steadiness is attained, the top begins to move in sma=
ll curves. If it be spun=20

on a marble slab smoothly coated with fine flour or sand, it can be made to=
 record its motions,=20

which may then be carefully studied. It will be found that the form of the =
curve is nearly the same=20

entally.  The coroner's=20

jury were for two hours very much divided in opinion about what verdict the=
y should return. Some=20

were for a verdict of wilful murder against Mr. Robinson. One man would hav=
e liked to have=20

brought in a verdict that would have handed over his wife to the tender mer=
cies of Jack Ketch. In=20

justification of the eleven others I may add, that a strong disposition was=
 felt, amid the solemnity of=20

that investigation, to inflict corporal punishment upon the stupidest fello=

murder a moment, then=20

describe a second, and so on.  The chief peculiarity of this separate curvi=
linear motion is that its=20

direction is always in an _opposite_ direction to that of the rotation of t=
he top. If the top turn from=20

left to right, it will move from right to left, and vice versa. The same te=
ndency will manifest itself=20

even if the peg of the top be placed in a slight depression or socket, so t=
hat the curve cannot be=20

made. Then the upper portion of the top will incline to one side, and begin=
 describing a curve: but,=20

as before, in a direction contrary to the direction of rotation.  The commo=

gyroscope illustrates the last peculiarity also. It consists=20
