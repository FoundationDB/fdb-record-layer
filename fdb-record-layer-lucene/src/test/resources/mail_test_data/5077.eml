electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, 

middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and 

donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 

with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring 

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 

2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and 

permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by 

U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's so zealously.  We must now, for a little 

while, leave Charles de la Tour and his fortunes.  We will return to them anon, but meanwhile it 

behoves us to see what was happening to Champlain and Quebec.  You will remember that the 

great Cardinal Richelieu had placed himself at the head of the Company of the Hundred 

Associates.  He had made Canada a royal province, with a nobility of its own and with Champlain 

as Viceroy. The war with England and the captures of Kirke brought this great scheme to a halt for 

some years, but the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye was signed at last, and the Hundred Associates 

were ready to begin their operations.  By the end of May 1633 Champlain was back again in his 

fort on Cape Diamond.  This time he had with him two hundred persons and great equipments.  In 

his Company also were a number of Jesuits, to take the place of the Recollets.  With such zeal did 

they administer their charge that life at Quebec became pious and orderly, and many Indian 

conversions to Christianity were {56} made.  A new fort was built at the old trading station of Three 

Rivers, at the mouth of St. Maurice River, as a protection against the Iroquois, but otherwise not 

very much happened worth describing here during the last two years of Champlain's life.  The 

veteran was now but two years short of the allotted span, and could survey the fruits of his long 

labours in

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project 

Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and 

donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works 

that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of 

equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly 

important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to 

complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United 

States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much 

paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these it was true, made Canada full of towns 

and cities and filled her countryside with prosperous farms and peasantry.  But he had trod out a 

path through the forest and had sown the seed of future greatness. If only he had not also sown 

the seed of future hatred--if only he had made the Iroquois a friend instead of a foe!  Nevertheless, 

when he fell sick on Christmas Day 1635 and his heroic spirit passed away for ever from the land 

he loved, Samuel de Champlain had well earned the name by which he is to-day called on the 

banks of the St. Lawrence, the "Father of Canada."  In his prime Champlain had a handsome 

countenance, a noble and soldierly bearing, and an iron constitution.  In an age when fifty miles 

was considered a great journey, he travelled many thousands by sea and by land, crossing the 

ocean at least twenty times to defend or promote the colony's interests in Old France.  His wife 

survived him nearly twenty years, and having founded a convent at Meaux, in France, became 

herself a nun, and as Sister Helen, beloved by the other nuns, she died.  After Champlain's 

lamented death a new Governor, Charles de Montmagny, a pious soldier and knight of Malta, was 

sent out to Canada.  On his landing {57} at the foot of Cape Diamond a striking scene took place.

we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation

"Behold the first cross that I have seen in this country.  Let us worship the crucified Saviour in his 

image."  The procession straightway

Jesuits, who ruled with great severity.  If a French colonist failed to attend church regularly, he was 

sent off to prison.  They cared nothing for the good things of this world; their only desire was for 

the salvation of souls.  It mattered nothing to them whether the Company of the Hundred 

Associates made money out of the buying and selling of furs or not.  The great ambition of the
