that we have called you, my good M. Mouston. Could you not procure us a few=
 of those nice little=20

fricassees at the hotel-

wine, which cured your master so quickly of his sprain!"  "Alas! sir," said=
 Mousqueton, "I much fear=20

that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren co=
untry, and I think we=20

should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little hous=

the forest."  "How! is there a house in the neighborhood?" asked D'Artagnan=
.  "Yes, sir," replied=20

Mousqueton.  "Well, let us, as you say, go and ask a dinner from the master=
 of that house. What is=20

your opinion, gentlemen, and does not M. Mouston's suggestion appear to you=
 full of sense?"=20

"Oh!" said Aramis, "suppose the master is a Puritan?"  "So much the better,=
 mordioux!" replied=20

D'Artagnan; "if he is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the ki=

(pronounced Jevo and in a peculiar way) had the effect of       killing a m=

mysterious Schemham-phorasch was       not always used for holy purposes by=

"You are very happy," exclaimed Athos, laughing, in spite of himself, at th=

Gascon; "for you see the bright side of everything."  "What would you have?=
" said D'Artagnan. "I=20

"Come, come," said D'Artagnan, "more reason why we should start on our jour=

Grimaud!"  Grimaud appeared.  "Well, Grimaud, my friend, have you seen anyt=
