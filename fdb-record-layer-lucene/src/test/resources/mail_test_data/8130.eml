philodendron monstera confidant. You think over about unburdening to me, Mi=
ss Daisy. I'll promise to be a safe receptacle."  Daisy shook her head mour=
nfully.  "It would be no use," she said; "even telling now would be no mann=
er of use. Oh, Poppy, I wish I had been strong enough, and I wish so dreadf=
ully I had not reverses like I once did."  "Reverses! You told me it wasn't=
 money! And, anyway, what does Uncle Josiah's action have to do with your r=
everses?" She switched on the light at her desk. When she saw her father's =
face she gave a little cry.  "I have told you the truth, Beth. It isn't mon=
ey. I wish philodendron monstera confidant. You think over about unburdenin=
g to me, Miss Daisy. I'll promise to be a safe receptacle."  Daisy shook he=
r head mournfully.  "It would be no use," she said; "even telling now would=
 be no manner of use. Oh, Poppy, I wish I had been strong enough, and I wis=
h so dreadfully I had not reverses like I once did."  "Reverses! You told m=
e it wasn't money! And, anyway, what does Uncle Josiah's action have to do =
with your reverses?" She switched on the light at her desk. When she saw he=
r father's face she gave a little cry.  "I have told you the truth, Beth. I=
t isn't money. I wish _
wonderful help to the household purse, and Primrose performed her irksome d=
uties with a=20

cheerful, and even thankful heart. Her anxieties about Daisy were almost la=
id to rest. Since the=20

child had been moved to Miss Egerton's house she seemed quite a changed cre=
ature. Her old=20

cheerfulness and sweet calm were returning to her. Morning after morning sh=
e bade Primrose=20

good-bye with a bright smile on her little face, and however long and dull =
her day was, she greeted=20

her sister happily at night. What, therefore, was poor Primrose's consterna=
tion to find, on returning=20

home the evening after Jasmine had made arrangements for the publication of=
 her manuscript not=20

only Jasmine, but Miss Egerton and Bridget all surrounding poor little Dais=
y, who lay on the sofa=20

with a ghastly white face, and burst into nervous troubled weeping whenever=
 she was spoken to.=20

"We found her in such a queer state," said Jasmine; but Miss Egerton held u=
p a warning hand.=20

"Let it rest now, my dear," she said; "we need not go into the story in Dai=
sy's presence; she wants=20

perfect quiet. Primrose, she has been longing so for you; will you sit down=
 by her, and hold her=20

hand?"  Daisy opened her eyes when she heard Primrose's name, and held up a=
 hot little hand to=20

her sister, who clasped it very firmly.  "I want to speak to you all by you=
rself, Primrose," she=20

whispered. "Please ask Jasmine, and Miss Egerton, and Bridget to go away. I=
 want to say=20

something most important to you."  "Leave us for a moment," said Primrose t=
o the others; and=20

Jasmine went down with Miss Egerton to the sitting-room.  The moment Daisy =
found herself quite=20

alone with Primrose she raised her head, ceased crying, and looked at her s=
ister with bright=20

feverish eyes, and cheeks that burned.  "Primrose," she said, "would you th=
ink it very, very wrong=20

of me if I did something that wasn't in itself the very best thing to do, b=
ut something that I had to do=20

to prevent a dreadful ogre putting me down into a dark dungeon? Would it be=
 very wrong of me to=20

do a very little thing to prevent it, Primrose?"  "My darling," said Primro=
se, "your poor little head=20

must be wandering. I don't understand what you mean, my dear little one. Of=
 course it would be=20

only right of you to keep away from an ogre, and not to allow one to touch =
you--but there are no=20

ogres. Daisy love--there never were such creatures. You need not make yours=
elf unhappy about=20

beings that never existed. The fact is, Daisy, you are too much alone, and =
your little head has got=20

quite full of the idea of fairies. I must ask Mr. Noel not to talk to you i=
n so fanciful a manner."  "Oh=20

don't, Primrose, for it is my one and only comfort. Oh! I am glad you think=
 I ought to keep out of=20

the ogre's power. He is a dreadful, dreadful ogre, and he has tried to get =
into the Palace, and I am=20

awfully afraid of him."  Then Daisy laughed quite strangely, and said, in a=
 wistful little voice--  "Of=20

course, Primrose, this is only fairy-talk. I always was fond of fairies, wa=
sn't I? Primrose, darling, I=20

want you to do a little thing for me, will you?"  "Of course, Daisy. Why, h=
ow you are trembling,=20

dear!"  "Hold my hand," said Daisy, "and let me put my head on your shoulde=
r. Now I'll ask you=20

about the little thing, Primrose; there's your letter from Mr. Danesfield o=
n the table."  "Has it=20

come?" said Primrose; "I am glad. I expected it yesterday morning."  "It's =
on the table," repeated=20

Daisy. "Will you open it, Primrose? I'd like to see what's inside."  "Oh, t=
here'll be nothing very=20

pretty inside, darling; it is probably a postal order for our quarter's mon=
ey."  "Yes, but let me see it,=20

Primrose."  Primrose moved slowly to the table, took up the letter, and ope=
ned it.  "It's just as I=20

said, Daisy," she remarked, "only, no--it's not a postal order, it's a cheq=
ue. I must write my name=20

on the back, and take it to the Metropolitan Bank to cash to-morrow."  "Let=
 me see you writing your=20

name on the back, please, Primrose," said  Miss Pipkin had been disturbed b=
y the noise, and now=20

opened the study door. She looked alarmed. The swarthy face of the Captain =
was a sickly green=20



where the white reflected through the deep tan.  "Of all things!" exclaimed=
 the housekeeper. "I=20

s'pose I should pity the two of you if you feel the way you look. But, for =
the lan' sakes, Josiah, let=20

go the minister's arms this very minute. You're crushing them."  The Captai=
n's hands relaxed and=20

fell limply to his sides. The tense muscles of his face eased into a silly =
grin.  "We was having a=20

friendly little argument, hey, Mack?"  The minister assented.  "Then, I'd h=
ate to see you in a real=20

fight. Things must be going to your head, Josiah."  "That's a fact, Clemmie=
, they be, but they're=20

clearing it up."  "You need some of that liniment. Your worrying has put yo=
ur stomach out. I'll fix up=20

a dose for you."  "No you won't neither. It ain't liniment I want, it's som=
ething for the outside." He=20

started for his hat and coat.  "Josiah! You're clean off in your head, goin=
g out a night like this! It's=20

raining pitchforks, and is past ten o'clock."  "Don't you worry, Clemmie. I=
 ain't crazy. I've just got=20

back what little sense I was born with. I'm sailing my _Jennie P._ to the c=
ity. Good-bye." Before=20

she could enter any protest, he stooped and kissed her.  Miss Pipkin stood =
as one paralyzed while=20

the Captain snatched his rubber hat from the nail behind the kitchen door, =
and slipped into his=20

slicker. He was out of the house before the coat was fastened about his nec=
k.  [Illustration: Miss=20

Pipkin had been disturbed by the noise.--_Page 261._]  "Now, ain't that a c=
aution to saints! And us=20

a-standing here and not trying to stop him. He's gone plumb off in his head=
!" lamented the=20

housekeeper, dropping limply into a chair. "What ever shall I do, Mr. McGow=
an? I know he's=20

coming down with that terrible fever again. I know it! I know it!" She wept=
 bitterly. "There ain't been=20

no one so kind to me, and that cares for me like him! And I ain't never giv=
e him any chance!"  "Do=20

you really care for the Captain?"  She straightened, and dabbed her apron i=
nto the corners of her=20

eyes, attempting at the same time to marshal a legion of denials. But the l=
egion refused to be=20

marshaled. She gave up, and admitted that she did care for Captain Josiah, =
very much.  "Then,=20

he'll come back, have no fear. A twenty-mule team couldn't keep him away." =
 "What good will it be=20

if he does come back, if he ain't got his senses?"  "In my opinion he was n=
ever more sane than he=20

is to-night. He has not taken leave of his senses; he is not a man so easil=
y dethroned. He has=20

merely taken a leave of absence from town, and all his five senses have gon=
e with him."  After=20

Miss Pipkin had gone to her room somewhat comforted, Mr. McGowan spied the =
yellow piece of=20

paper which the Captain had dropped. He stooped down, picked it up, smoothe=
d the crumpled=20

page, and began to read. His eyes widened with each additional line.      "=
Jim and I are going into=20

partnership over here in Sydney. It     isn't just what I'd like, but there=
 are certain advantages. He=20

is a keen fellow, and I'll have to watch him pretty close. There     is an =
older man who has taken us=20

into his firm, so Jim can't     have his own way. There is loads of money h=
ere, and I mean to     get=20

my share of it.      "Jim and I are both fighting for the same girl. She is=
 the     daughter of the old=20

man who heads up the firm. May the best man     win, providing I'm the best=
 man. I'll give him=20

some run for his     money, anyway. I think I'm on the inside track for the=
 present.      "I guess=20

you'd better not say anything about Jim being over     here. He isn't using=
 his own name, and says=20

he wants it kept a     dead secret. Just what his game is, I don't know. Bu=
t there are     lots just like=20

him who are hiding behind assumed names.      "I'm too harum-scarum a sailo=
r for a quiet home-

loving woman     like you, so just forget me. Be=20


_
Daisy, in a queer, constrained little voice.  Primrose smiled to herself at=
 the child's caprice but,=20

taking up a pen, she put her signature across the back of the cheque.  "May=
 I take it in my hand,=20

Primrose?" said Daisy. "Oh, thank you! My hand shakes, doesn't it? but that=
's because I'm so=20

dreadfully subject to starts. Isn't it funny, Primrose, to think that this =
little paper should mean a lot=20

of golden sovereigns? Doesn't it make you feel rich to have it, Primrose?" =
 "It makes me feel that=20

with it and the help of my weekly salary we shall be able to pay for our br=
ead and butter, Daisy."=20

Daisy turned ghastly white.  "Oh, yes," she said, "oh, yes, dear Primrose. =
Will you put the cheque=20

back into the envelope, and may I sleep with it under my pillow? I'll stay =
so quiet and still, and I'll=20

not start at all if I have the cheque that you have signed under my pillow.=
"     CHAPTER XXXVIII.=20

DAISY'S REQUEST.   Primrose was so anxious to soothe Daisy that she allowed=
 her without a=20

moment's hesitation to have her way. The moment the child felt her hot litt=
le fingers clasping the=20

letter with its precious enclosure she became quiet, and ceased to speak. P=
rimrose had=20

undressed her, and placed her in bed, and she now turned her back on her si=
ster, and still=20

clasping the letter tightly, closed her eyes. Primrose hoped she was asleep=
, and went softly out of=20

the room to talk over matters with Jasmine and Miss Egerton. Miss Egerton c=
ould throw no light on=20

the subject of Daisy's queer attack, and when Primrose at last went to bed =
she had to own that her=20

anxieties with regard to her little sister had returned.  The next morning =
she was obliged to leave=20

earlier than usual, and rather to Daisy's astonishment, and very much to he=
r relief, said nothing=20

about Mr. Danesfield's letter. Primrose had not forgotten the letter, but s=
he knew she would not be=20

able to go to the bank that day, and she thought it would comfort Daisy to =
take care of it.=20

"Jasmine," she said to her second sister, "must you go out this morning? I =
think it is hardly well to=20

leave Daisy alone."  Jasmine's face clouded over.  "Have you forgotten, Pri=
mrose, that Miss=20

Egerton and Mr. Noel were to take me to South Kensington Museum to-day? The=
y arranged that I=20

should go with them quite a week ago, and it would never do to put them off=
 again now. I'll tell you=20

what I'll do, Primrose; I'll take Daisy too; I'll see that she is not over =
tired, and Mr. Noel will take=20

great care of her; they are very fond of each other."  "Try to arrange it s=
o, then, Jasmine," said=20

Primrose; "for I do not feel happy about her being left."  Primrose went aw=
ay to spend her day as=20

usual with Mrs. Mortlock, and sat down to her "continual reading" with a he=
avy heart.  Mrs.=20

Mortlock was losing her sight rapidly--cataract was forming on her eyes, an=
d she could now only=20

dimly see the face and form of her young companion. Primrose, however, alwa=
ys managed to=20

soothe the somewhat irascible old lady, and was already a prime favorite wi=
th her.  To-day she=20

took up the newspaper with a heavy heart, and the anxiety which oppressed h=
er made itself felt in=20

a certain weary tone which came into her voice.  Mrs. Mortlock was fond of =
Primrose, but was=20

never slow in expressing an opinion.  "Crisp up, Miss Mainwaring," she said=
; "crisp up a little;=20

drawling voices give me the fidgets most terribly. Now, my dear, try to fan=
cy yourself in the House=20

of Commons; read that speech more animated, my love. Ah, that's better!"  P=
rimrose exerted=20

herself, and for a few minutes the reading came up to its usual standard, b=
ut then, again, thoughts=20

of Daisy oppressed the young reader, and once more her voice flagged.  "The=
re, my dear, you=20

had better turn to the bits of gossip; they are more in your line, I can se=
e, this morning. Dear, dear,=20

dear! I can't tell what's come to girls these days; they don't seem to find=
 no heart nor pleasure in=20

anything. Now, if there is a girl who, in my opinion, has fallen on her fee=
t, it's you,  Here the page=20

ended, and the remainder of the letter was in Miss Pipkin's trunk.  Before =
he had finished reading,=20



the chug-chug from the Captain's power-boat floated in from the harbor, and=
 the minister longed to=20

be with him.     CHAPTER XIV   Elizabeth Fox was sitting alone in her room =
when the familiar chug=20

from the exhaust of the _Jennie P._ fell on her ears. She raised her window=
-curtain, and watched=20

the dim lights move out of the harbor in the direction of the Sound. An unr=
easoning fear seized=20

her, and it steadily grew more and more acute as the exhaust from the engin=
e exploded less and=20

less distinctly. As the lights went out of view into the rain-soaked night,=
 resentment replaced fear.=20

The minister had doubtless heard of the plans that were being laid by Sim H=
icks for his forceful=20

ejection from Little River, and rather than face further trouble was slinki=
ng away like a coward=20

under cover of night and storm.  Her better judgment soon began to form exc=
uses for his action.=20

The Athletic Club, thoroughly reorganized, had been placed under good leade=
rship, and Mr.=20

McGowan doubtless thought that the members could get on without his further=
 aid. In all=20

probability, he feared that his presence might interfere with the promised =
consummation of=20

fellowship between the club and the church, and was leaving quietly so anot=
her man less=20

aggressive than he might accomplish the thing he had so well begun. Had he =
remained, he would=20

have been compelled to fight his way through by brute force. He had been fo=
rsaken by all those=20

who should have stood by him. He was not a coward! He was taking the most d=
ifficult course. His=20

going was the most heroic act of all.  Why had every man's hand been agains=
t him? Why had her=20

father not so much as lifted a finger to stay the persecutors? She drew in =
her lip between her=20

teeth, and mercilessly bit the pretty Cupid's arch. She kicked her foot aga=
inst a stool till the piece=20

of furniture lay beyond reach of her toe. Her father had not made a single =
effort to prevent one=20

action of those who had set themselves against the minister. Instead, he ha=
d aided them, and in=20

many instances had even led in the opposition against the young man.  One t=
hought at length=20

inhibited all others. She drew back from the window, and sinking into a dee=
p chair, covered her=20

face with her arm. Mack McGowan had gone out of her life! Suddenly, she kne=
w that she loved=20

him, loved him as passionately as he had declared his love for her. Why had=
 she been unable to=20

understand him that night on the beach? Had she really tried? She classed h=
erself with all the=20

others who had been so blind as to force this man to leave their village.  =
She jerked the pins from=20

her hair, letting the fair mass fall over her shoulders. The stand she had =
taken had been because=20

of the attitude of her father. He had no right to come between her and the =
man she loved. Why=20

had he done it? Her fingers paused in the act of delving for a buried hairp=
in, and her arm fell limply=20

over the wing of the chair. A vision of her father's face had come before h=
er, startling her=20

imagination. She saw him again as she had seen him that night when Harold h=
ad announced his=20

intended trip to Australia. She recalled his ghostly features on the night =
of Harold's return from=20

abroad. Could there be some unknown reason for her father's actions against=
 the young minister?=20

And did that reason justify his action?  Her conjectures were cut short by =
the sound of footfalls on=20

the stair. The tread was heavy, as though the climber were dragging himself=
 up by main force. On=20

the top landing he halted, and turned toward her door.  What caprices emoti=
on plays with=20

judgment! One moment judgment may map out a course as clear as the noonday,=
 and the next=20

moment emotion may lead judgment into a blind alley. Thus did the emotions =
of Elizabeth=20

suddenly halt her judgment, leaving all her reason deaf, dumb, and blind.  =
"Beth, are you asleep?"=20

whispered a tired, husky voice.  "No, Father. I haven't=20


_
handsome salary I allow is earned with next to no trouble. When once a girl=
 can read she can read=20

continual, and that's all I ask of you."  "I'm sorry," said Primrose; "some=
 things at home are=20

troubling me, and I cannot help thinking about them. I shall do better over=
 the gossip."  "That's=20

right, my love! I'd ask you about the home troubles, but my nerves won't st=
and no worriting. Get on=20

with the gossip, dear, and make your voice chirrupy and perky, as though yo=
u saw the spice of it=20

all, and enjoyed it--do."  Just at this moment, while poor Primrose was try=
ing to train her unwilling=20

voice, the door was opened, and Poppy, red in the face, and with her best h=
at and jacket on, came=20

in.  "Miss Primrose, I'm come to say good-bye, I am. No, Mrs. Mortlock, whe=
n about to quit I don't=20

fear you no longer--not all the Sarahs in Europe would have power over me n=
ow. I'm going. Aunt=20

Flint and me we has quarrelled, and I has given her fair warning, and I'm g=
oing back to my native=20

place, maybe this evening. Never no more will this city of wanities see me.=
 I'm off, Miss Primrose; I=20

leaves Penelope Mansion now, and I go straight away to your place to bid Mi=
ss Jasmine and Miss=20

Daisy good-bye."  "For goodness sake, Sarah Matilda Ann!" here interrupted =
Mrs. Mortlock,=20

speaking with great excitement, "before you go see you bring me up my beef-=
tea--Mrs. Flint won't=20

give it a thought, and my nerves won't keep up without the nourishment. Run=
 down to the kitchen=20

this minute, Sarah Mary, and bring me up the beef-tea, and a nice little de=
licate slice of toast, done=20

to a turn, to eat with it.  She blindly felt that her father had need of he=
r, and although she could not=20

understand the meaning of the battle he had been called upon to general, sh=
e must give him her=20

aid.  Mr. Fox entered and felt his way across the dark room. He found a cha=
ir and dropped into it.=20

"You're in the dark, dear," he observed.  "Yes, Father. I've been thinking =
here since twilight. Lights=20

always interfere with my thoughts, and so I did not turn them on."  "Why, m=
y dear, how long you=20

have been sitting like this! It is now nearly eleven o'clock. Your thoughts=
 must have been pretty=20

active."  "I had no idea it was that late!" she exclaimed. "I have been thi=
nking a great deal."  He=20

stirred uneasily. Since the Captain's visit the Elder had been on the verge=
 of collapse.  "Pretty bad=20

storm," he commented, and his voice trembled.  Elizabeth reached out into t=
he darkness and took=20

his hand. As she pressed it to her lips she felt it shake.  "Thank you, Bet=
h."  "Are you well,=20

Father?"  "Not very. But it is nothing serious. At least, the doctor so ass=
ures me. I presume he=20

ought to know."  "Why don't you go to the city and consult a specialist? Th=
ese country doctors may=20

not understand how to diagnose your case fully."  "All the specialists in C=
hristendom couldn't help=20

me."  "Father!"  "Don't grow alarmed," he said, with a short nervous laugh.=
 "The only thing any=20

doctor ever removes from his patient is what is worth the doctor's while. P=
resent day physicians=20

get away with a lot that is no credit to their profession. The main thing t=
hat interests them is not the=20

disease, but the sufferer's=20


_
don't let the toast get burnt, for if I can't see I can taste, and well kno=
w when my toast is burnt."=20

Poppy was about to give a saucy answer, but a look from Primrose restrained=
 her, and before she=20

left Penelope Mansion she had provided the old lady with her luncheon. latt=
er, they will keep=20

coaxing the former along."  "I suppose it is the spirit of the age to want =
to get all the money one=20

can. Others, besides doctors, do that."  "Yes. Yes. There are still others =
who are grossly=20

misjudged simply because they have money, too."  "Of course=20


_
and regret, and then Poppy set out, determined to take her chance of findin=
g Jasmine and Daisy=20

at home.  "I'll go back to my own place to-night," she said to herself, "an=
d tell my mother that=20

wanity of wanities is London--my fifteen shillings will just buy me a singl=
e third, and I needn't eat=20

nothing until to-morrow morning."  When Poppy arrived at Miss Egerton's she=
 was told by Bridget=20

that Miss Jasmine was out, but that she would find Miss Daisy by herself up=
stairs. Poppy ran=20

nimbly up the stairs, and knocked at the sitting-room door; there was no an=
swer, and turning the=20

handle, she went in. Daisy was lying with her face about you. Please, tell =
me all about your=20

troubles. It hurts me to see you suffering so, and I want to help you. I'll=
 try very hard."  "I can't tell=20

you everything, Beth."  "Oh! Yes, you can. I'll be your doctor, and I'll pr=
omise not to remove more=20

of your money than is absolutely necessary for a new frock. Try me this onc=
