Come to yourself! Why is it that now      Your figure seems to melt in limp=
 despair,     Your eyes=20

are wildly rolling here and there?     That when I come, sweet girl, to mak=

. He travelled in the=20

hope of finding strength, visiting Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Tyrol, and =
observing, with a serious=20

amusement, the varieties of men and manners. While still absent from France=
, in 1581, he learned=20

that he had been elected=20


_
_Madanika._ [_Coming to herself._] O you reckless man! When you did what yo=
u ought not to=20

have done for my sake, you didn't kill anybody or hurt anybody in that hous=
e?  _Sharvilaka._=20

Madanika, Sharvilaka does not strike a terrified man or a man asleep. I did=
 not kill anybody nor=20

hurt anybody.  _Madanika._ Really?  _Sharvilaka._ Really.  _Vasantasena._ [=
_Recovering=20

consciousness._] Ah, I breathe again.  _Madanika._ Thank heaven!  _Sharvila=
ka._ [_Jealously._]=20

What does this "Thank heaven" mean, Madanika?      I sinned for you, when l=
ove had made me=20

pine,       Although my house was good since time began;     Love took my v=
irtue, but my pride is=20

Pecks him and leaves him bare.                             10      Love is =
a fire, whose flame is lust,=20

Whose fuel is gallantry,     Wherein our youth and riches must       Thus s=
acrificed be.=20

11  [62.16. S.  _Vasantasena._ [_With a smile._] His excitement is a little=

_Sharvilaka._ Yes!      Those men are fools, it seems to me,       Who trus=
t to women or to gold;=20

For gold and girls, 'tis plain to see.       Are false as virgin snakes and=

Love not a woman; if you ever do,       She mocks at you, and plays the gay=
 deceiver:     Yet if she=20

loves you, you may love her too;       But if she doesn't, leave her.      =
                       13  Too true it=20

is that      A courtezan will laugh hesitated in accepting an honourable bu=
t irksome public office;=20

the King permitted no dallying, and Montaigne obeyed. Two years later the m=
ayor was re-elected;=20

it was a period of difficulty; a Catholic and a Royalist, he had a heretic =
brother, and himself yielded=20

to the charm of Henri of Navarre; "for the Ghibelline I was a Guelph, for t=
he Guelph a Ghibelline."=20

When, in 1585, pestilence raged in Bordeaux, Montaigne's second period of o=
ffice had almost=20

expired; he quitted the city, and the election of his successor took place =
in his absence. His last=20

years were brightened by the friendship--almost filial--of Mlle. de Gournay=
, an ardent admirer, and=20

afterwards editor, of the _Essais_. In 1592 Montaigne died, when midway in =
his sixtieth year.  The=20

first two books of the _Essais_ were published by their author in 1580; in =
1588 they appeared in=20

an augmented text, with the addition of the third book. The text superinten=
ded by Mlle. de=20

Gournay, based upon a revised and enlarged copy left by Montaigne, is of th=
e year 1595.  The=20

unity of the book, which makes no pretence to unity, may be found in the fa=
ct that all its topics are=20

concerned with a common subject--the nature of man; that the writer accepts=
 himself as the=20

example of humanity most open to his observation; and that the same tranqui=
l, yet insatiable=20

curiosity is everywhere present. Man, as conceived by Montaigne, is of all =
creatures the most=20

variable, unstable, inconstant. The species includes the saint and the brut=
e, the hero and the=20

craven, while between the extremes lies the average man, who may be anythin=
g that nature,=20

custom, or circumstances make him. And as the species varies=20


_
She trusts you not, but waits your trustful hour.     If virtue and a name =
are yours, then hold!=20

Avoid her as you would a graveyard flower.                 14  And again:  =
    As fickle as the billows of=20

the sea,       Glowing no longer than the evening sky,     A woman takes yo=
ur gold, then leaves you=20

free; endlessly from himself: his conscience controls his temperament; his =
temperament betrays=20

his conscience; external events transform him from what he was. Do we seek =
to establish our=20

moral being upon the rock of philosophical dogma? The rock gives way under =
our feet, and=20

scatters as if sand. Such truth as we can attain by=20
