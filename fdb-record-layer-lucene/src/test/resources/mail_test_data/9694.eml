At that moment footsteps and voices were heard in the corridor, and as the door of the bearded 

man's stateroom was opened, Mr. Titus had a glimpse of Tom and one of the stewards.  "Yes, I'll 

look after him," the steward said "He's been this way before. Thank you, sir, for calling me."  "I 

guess the steward has been well tipped," thought Tom.  As Mr. Titus came out and the door was 

shut, the young inventor asked in a whisper,  "Well, was it he?"  The contractor shook his head. 

"No," he answered. "I never was more surprised in my life.  I felt sure it was Waddington in there, 

but it wasn't. That man's beard is real, and while he has a look like Waddington about the eyes 

and upper part of his face, the man is a stranger to me. That is I think so, but in spite of all that, I 

have a queer feeling that I have met him before."  "Where?" Tom inquired.  "That I can't say," and 

the tunnel contractor shook his head. "Whew! That was a bad one!" he exclaimed, as the steamer 

pitched and tossed in an alarming manner.  "Yes, the storm seems to be getting worse instead of 

better," agreed Tom. "I hope none of the cargo shifts and comes banging up against my new 

explosive. If it does, there'll be no more tunnel digging for any of us."  "Better not mention the fact 

of the explosives on board," suggested Mr. Titus.  "I won't," promised Tom. "The passengers are 

frightened enough as it is. But I watched the powder being stored away.  I guess it is safe."  The 

storm raged for two days before it began to die away.  Meanwhile, nothing was seen, on deck or in 

the dining cabins, of the bearded man.  Tom and Mr. Titus made some guarded inquiries of the 

steward who had attended the sick man, and from him learned that he was down on the 

passenger list as Senor Pinto, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was traveling in the interests of a 

large firm of coffee importers of the United States, and was going to Lima.  "And there's no trace of 

Waddington?" asked Tom of Mr. Titus, as they were discussing matters in their stateroom one 

day.  "Not a trace. He seems to have dropped out of sight, and I'm glad of it."  "Perhaps Blakeson 

& Grinder have given up the fight against you."  "I wish they had, though I don't look for any such 

good luck. But I'm willing to fight them, now that we have an even chance, thanks to your 

explosive."  The storm blew itself out. The Bellaconda "crossed the line," and there was the usual 

horseplay among the sailors when Father Neptune came aboard to hold court. Those who had 

never before been below the equator were made to undergo more or less of an initiation, being 

lathered and shaved, and then pushed backward into a canvas tank of water on deck.  While Tom 

enjoyed the voyage, with the possible exception of the storm, he was anxious, and so was Mr. 

Titus, for the time to come when they should get to the tunnel and try the effect of the new 

explosive. Mr. Damon found an elderly gentleman as fond of playing chess as was the eccentric 

man himself, and his days were fully occupied with castles, pawns, knights, kings, queens and so 

on. As for Koku he was taken in charge by the sailors and found life forward very agreeable. 

Senor Pinto had recovered from his seasickness, the steward told Tom and Mr. Titus, but still he 

kept to his stateroom.  It was when the Bellaconda was within a day or two of Callao that a 

wireless message was received for Mr. Titus.  It was from his brother. The message read:   "Have 

information from New York office that rivals are after you. Look out for explosive."   "What does 

that mean?" asked Tom.  "Well, I presume it means our rival contractors know we have a supply of 

your new powder on board, and they may try to get it away from us."  "Why?" Tom demanded. 

"To prevent our using it to complete the tunnel. In that case they'll get the secret of it to use for 

themselves, when the contract goes to them by default. Can we do anything to protect the powder, 

Tom?"  "Well, I don't know that we'll need to while it's stowed away in the cargo. They can't get at 



it any more than we can, until the ship unloads. I guess it's safe enough. We'll just have to keep 

our eyes open when it's taken out of the hold, though."  Tom and Mr. Titus, both of whom were 

fond of fresh air and exercise, had made it a practice to get up an hour before breakfast and take a 

constitutional about the steamer deck.  They did this as usual the morning after the wireless 

warning was received, and they were standing near the port rail, talking about this, when they 

heard a thud on the deck behind them. Both turned quickly, and saw a round black object rolling 

toward them. From the object projected what seemed to be a black cord, and the end of this cord 

was glowing and smoking.  For a moment neither Tom nor Mr. Titus spoke. Then, as a slow 

motion of the ship rolled the round black thing toward Tom, he cried:  "It a bomb!"  He darted 

toward it, but Mr. Titus pulled him back.  "Run!" yelled the contractor.  Before either of them could 

do anything, a queer figure of an elderly gentleman stepped partly from behind a deck-house, and 

stooped over the smoking object.  "Look out!" yelled Mr. Titus, crouching low. "That's an explosive 

bomb! Toss it overboard!"     Chapter X  Professor Bumper   Fairly fascinated by the spluttering 

fuse, neither Tom nor Mr. Titus moved for a second, while the deadly fire crept on through the 

black string-like affair, nearer and nearer to the bomb itself.  Then, just as Tom, holding back his 

natural fear, was about to thrust the thing overboard with his foot, hardly realizing that it might be 

even more deadly to the ship in the water than it was on the deck, the foot of the newcomer was 

suddenly thrust out from behind the deck-house, and the sizzling fuse was trodden upon.  It went 

out in a puff of smoke, but the owner of the foot was not satisfied with that for a hand reached 

down, lifted the bomb, the fuse of which still showed a smouldering spark of fire, and calmly pulled 

out the "tail" of the explosive.  It was harmless then, for the fuse, with a trail of smoke following, 

was tossed into the sea, and the little man came out from behind the deck-house, holding the 

unexploded bomb.  For a moment neither Tom nor Mr. Titus could speak. They felt an 

inexpressible sense of relief. Then Tom managed to gasp out:  "You--you saved our lives!"  The 

little man who had stepped on the fuse, and had then torn it from the bomb, looked at the object in 

his hand as though it were the most natural thing in the world to pick explosives up off the deck of 

passenger steamers, as he remarked:  "Well, perhaps I did. Yes, I think it would have gone off in 

another second or two. Rather curious; isn't it?"  "Curious? Curious!" asked and exclaimed Mr. 

Titus.  "Why, yes," went on the little man, in the most matter of fact tone. "You see, most explosive 

bombs are round, made that way so the force will be equal in all directions. But this one, you 

notice, has a bulge, or protuberance, on one side, so to speak. Very curious!  "It might have been 

made that way to prevent its rolling overboard, or the bomb's walls might be weaker near that 

bulge to make sure that the force of the explosion would be in that direction. And the bulge was 

pointed toward you gentlemen, if you noticed."  "I should say I did!" cried Mr. Titus. "My dear sir, 

you have put us under a heavy debt to you! You saved our lives!  I--I am in no frame of mind to 

thank you now, but--"  He strode over to the little man, holding out his hand.  "No, no, I'd better 

keep it," went on the person who had rendered the bomb ineffective. "You might drop it you know. 

You are nervous--your hand shakes."  "I want to shake hands with you!" exclaimed Mr. Titus--"to 

thank you!"  "Oh, that's it. I thought you wanted the bomb. Shake hands? Certainly!"  And while 

this ceremony was being gone through with, Tom had a moment to study the appearance of the 

man who had saved their lives. He had seen the passenger once or twice before, but had taken no 

special notice of him. Now he had good reason to observe him.  Tom beheld a little, thin man, little 



in the sense of being of the "bean pole" construction. His head was as bald as a billiard ball, as the 

young inventor could notice when the stranger took off his hat to bow formally in response to the 

greeting of some ladies who passed, while Mr. Titus was shaking hands with him.  The bald head 

was sunk down between two high shoulders, and when the owner wished to observe anything 

closely, as he was now observing the bomb, the head was thrust forward somewhat as an eagle 

might do. And Tom noticed that the eyes of the little man were as bright as those of an eagle. 

Nothing seemed to escape them.  "I want to add my thanks to those of Mr. Titus for saving our 

lives," said Tom, as he advanced. "We don't know what to make of it all, but you certainly stopped 

that bomb from going off."  "Yes, perhaps I did," admitted the little man coolly and calmly, as 

though preventing bomb explosions was his daily exercise before breakfast.  Tom and Mr. Titus 

introduced themselves by name.  "I am Professor Swyington Bumper," said the bomb-holder, with 

a bow, removing his hat, and again disclosing his shiny bald head. "I am very glad to have met 

you indeed."  "And we are more than glad," said Tom, fervently, as he glanced at the explosive. 

"Now that the danger is over," went on Mr. Titus, "suppose we make an investigation, and find out 

how this bomb came to be here."  "Just what I was about to suggest," remarked Professor 

Bumper. "Bombs, such as this, do not sprout of themselves on bare decks. And I take it this one is 

explosive."  "Let me look at it," suggested Tom. "I know something of explosives."  It needed but a 

casual examination on the part of one who had done considerable experimenting with explosives 

to disclose the fact that it had every characteristic of a dangerous bomb. Only the pulling out of the 

fuse had rendered it harmless.  "If it had gone off," said Tom, "we would both have been killed, or, 

at least, badly injured, Mr. Titus."  "I believe you, Tom. And we owe our lives to Professor 

Bumper."  "I'm glad I could be of service, gentlemen," the scientist remarked, in an easy tone. 

"Explosives are out of my line, but I guessed it was rather dangerous to let this go off.  Have you 

any idea how it got here?"  "Not in the least," said Tom. "But some one must have placed it here, 

or dropped it behind us."  "Would any one have an object in doing such a thing?" the professor 

asked.  Tom and Mr. Titus looked at one another.  "Waddington!" murmured the contractor. "If he 

were on board I should say he might have done it to get us out of the way, though I would not go 

so far as to say he meant to kill us. It may be this bomb has only a light charge in it, and he only 

meant to cripple us."  "We'll find out about that," said Tom. "I'll open it."  "Better be careful," urged 

Mr. Titus.  "I will," the young inventor promised. "I beg your pardon," he went on to Professor 

Bumper. "We have been talking about something of which you know nothing. Briefly, there is a 

certain man who is trying to interfere in some work in which Mr. Titus and I are interested, and we 

think, if he were on board, he might have placed this bomb where it would injure us."  "Is he here?" 

asked the professor.  "No. And that is what makes it all the more strange," said Mr. Titus. "At one 

time I thought he was here, but I was mistaken."  Tom took the now harmless bomb to his 

stateroom, and there, after taking the infernal machine apart, he discovered that it was not as 

dangerous as he had at first believed.  The bomb contained no missiles, and though it held a 

quantity of explosive, it was of a slow burning kind. Had it gone off it would have sent out a sheet 

of flame that would have severely burned him and Mr. Titus, but unless complications had set in 

death would not have resulted.  "They just wanted to disable us," said the contractor.  "That was 

their game. Tom, who did it?"  "I don't know. Did you ever see this Professor Bumper before?"  "I 

never did."  "And did it strike you as curious that he should happen to be so near at hand when the 



bomb fell behind us?"  "I hadn't thought of that," admitted the contractor. "Do you mean that he 

might have dropped it himself?"  "Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that," replied Tom, slowly. 

"But I think it would be a good idea to find out all we can of Professor Swyington Bumper."  "I 

agree with you, Tom. We'll investigate him."     Chapter XI  In the Andes   Professor Swyington 

Bumper seemed to live in a region all by himself. Though he was on board the Bellaconda, he 

might just as well have been in an airship, or riding along on the back of a donkey, as far as his 

knowledge, or recognition, of his surroundings went. He seemed to be thinking thoughts far, far 

away, and he was never without a book--either a bound volume or a note-book. In the former he 

buried his hawk-like nose, and Tom, looking over his shoulder once, saw that the book was printed 

in curious characters, which, later, he learned were Sanskrit. If he had a note-book the bald-

headed professor was continually jotting down memoranda in it.  "I can hardly think of him as a 

conspirator against us," said Tom to Mr. Titus.  "After you have been in the contracting business 

as long as I have you'll distrust every one," was the answer.  "Waddington isn't on board, or I'd 

distrust him. That Spaniard, Senor Pinto, seems to be out of consideration, and there only remains 

the professor. We must watch him."  But Professor Bumper proved to be above suspicion. 

Carefully guarded inquiries made of the captain, the purser and other ships' officers, brought out 

the fact that he was well known to all of them, having traveled on the line before.  "He is making a 

search for something, but he won't say what it is," the captain said. "At first we thought it was gold 

or jewels, for he goes away off into the Andes Mountains, where both gold and jewels have been 

found. He never looks for treasure, though, for though some of his party have made rather rich 

discoveries, he takes no interest in them."  "What is he after then?" asked Mr. Titus.  "No one 

knows, and he won't tell. But whatever it is he has never found it yet. Always, when he comes 

back, unsuccessful, from a trip to the interior and goes back North with us, he will remark that he 

has not the right directions. That he must seek again.  "Back he comes next season, as full of 

hope as before, but only to be disappointed. Each time he goes to a new place in the mountains 

where he digs and delves, so members of the parties he hires tell me, but with no success. He 

carries with him something in a small iron box, and, whatever this is, he consults it from time to 

time. It may be directions for finding whatever he is after. But there seems to be something 

wrong."  "This is quite a mystery," remarked Tom.  "It certainly is. But Professor Bumper is a fine 

man. I have known him for years."  "This seems to dispose of the theory that he planted the bomb, 

and that he is one of the plotters in the pay of Blakeson & Grinder," said Mr. Titus, when he and 

Tom were alone.  "Yes, I guess it does. But who can have done it?"  That was a question neither 

could answer.  Tom had a theory, which he did not disclose to Mr. Titus, that, after all, the 

somewhat mysterious Senor Pinto might, in some way, be mixed up in the bomb attempt. But a 

close questioning of the steward on duty near the foreigner's cabin at the time disclosed the fact 

that Pinto had been ill in his berth all that day.  "Well, unless the bomb fell from some passing 

airship, I don't see how it got on deck," said Tom with a shake of his head. "And I'm sure no airship 

passed over us."  They had kept the matter secret, not telling even Mr. Damon, for they feared the 

eccentric man would make a fuss and alarm the whole vessel. So Mr. Damon, occasionally 

blessing his necktie or his shoe laces, played chess with his elderly gentleman friend and was 

perfectly happy.  That Professor Bumper not only had kept his promise about not mentioning the 

bomb, but that he had forgotten all about it, was evident a day or two after the happening. Tom 



and Mr. Titus passed him on deck, and bowed cordially. The professor returned the salutation, but 

looked at the two in a puzzled sort of fashion.  "I beg your pardon," he remarked, "but your faces 

are familiar, though I cannot recall your names. Haven't I seen you before?"  "You have," said 

Tom, with a as the height of land, and thence to go down to James's Bay."  At the beginning of 

April they arrived at the Long Sault, where they prepared some canoes in order to ascend the 

Ottawa River.  From Lake Temiscamingue they passed many portages until they reached Lake 

Abbitibi, at the entrance or most southern extremity of which they built a small fort of stockades. 

After a short halt they continued their course onward to James's Bay.  First doomed to conquest 

by Troyes and his companions was Moose Factory, a stockade fort with four bastions.  In the 

centre stood a house 40 feet square and as many high, terminating in a platform. This fort was 

escaladed by the French late at night, and of {116} the palisades short work was made by the 

hatchets of the bushrangers.  Not a man amongst the garrison appears to have attempted a 

decent defence save the chief gunner, whose skull was split into fragments by Iberville, and who 

thus perished bravely at his post of duty.  A cry for quarter went up, and the English were made 

prisoners on the spot.  They were sixteen in number, and as the attack was made at night, they 

were in a state of almost complete undress.  Troyes found in the fort twelve cannon, chiefly six 

and eight pounders, three thousand pounds of powder, and ten pounds of lead.  It is worth telling 

that this conquest was made with an amount of pomp and ceremony calculated to strike the 

deepest awe into the hearts of the fifteen unhappy traders, who knew nothing of fighting, nor had 

bargained for anything so perilous.  For so small a victory it was both preceded and followed by 

almost as much circumstance as would have sufficed for the Grand Monarque himself in one of 

his theatrical sieges.  The Chevalier announced in a loud voice that he took possession of the fort 

and island "in the name of his Most Christian Majesty the Most High, Most Mighty, Most 

Redoubtable Monarch Louis XIV. of the Most Christian names, King of France and Navarre." 

According to romantic custom, a sod of earth was thrice raised in the air, whilst a cry of "Vive le 

Roi" rang out over those waters wherein, deep down, lay the bodies of Henry Hudson and his 

brave followers.  Flushed with his triumph, the Chevalier de Troyes {117} next bethought him of an 

attack on either Fort Rupert or Fort Albany.  He did not long hesitate.  News came that a boat 

containing provisions had left Moose Factory on the previous day bound for Rupert's River. 

Iberville was therefore sent with nine men and two bark canoes to attack a sloop belonging to the 

Company, then lying at anchor at the mouth of the latter river.  Fourteen souls were aboard, 

including the Governor.  To accomplish this feat it was necessary to travel forty leagues along the 

sea-coast.  The road was extremely difficult, and in places almost impassable.  A small boat was 

built to carry a couple of small camion.  When he had arranged all his plans, Troyes left for Fort 

Rupert.  Ste. Hlne was sent on in advance to reconnoitre the English fort. He returned with the 

information that it was a square structure, flanked by four bastions, but that all was in a state of 

confusion owing to repairs and additions then being made.  The cannon had not yet been placed, 

being temporarily accommodated outside on the slope of a redoubt.  Ere the attack, which could 

only have one issue, was made by the land forces, Iberville had boarded the Company's sloop, 

surprised captain and crew, and made all, including Governor Bridgar, prisoners.  Four of the 

English were killed.  On the heels of this exploit, Iberville came ashore, rejoined his superior, and 

overpowered the almost defenceless garrison of Fort Rupert.  The French forces now united, and 



Ste. Hlne having been as successful as his brother in securing the second of the Company's 

ships, all embarked and {118} sailed for the remaining post of the Company in that part of the Bay. 

Neither Troyes nor Iberville knew its precise situation; but a little reconnoitring soon discovered it. 

Fort Albany was built in a sheltered inlet forty yards from the borders of the Bay.  Two miles to the 

north-east was an estrapade, on the summit of which was placed a seat for a sentinel to sight the 

ships expected from England, and to signal them if all was well.  But on this morning, unhappily, 

no sentinel was there to greet with a waving flag the Company's captured ship, on the deck of 

which young Iberville held vigilant and expectant watch.  Two Indians, however, brought Governor 

Sargeant tidings of the approach of the enemy, and his previous successes at Moose and Rupert 

rivers.  The Governor immediately resolved upon making a bold stand; all was instantly got in 

readiness to sustain a siege, and the men were encouraged to behave with fortitude.  Two hours 

later the booming of cannon was heard, and soon afterwards a couple of skirmishers were sighted 

at a distance.  Despite the Governor's example, the servants at the fort were thrown into the 

greatest confusion.  Two of their number were deputed by the rest to inform the Governor that they 

were by no means disposed to sacrifice their lives without provision being made for themselves 

and families in case of a serious issue.  They were prevailed upon by the Governor to return to 

their posts, and a bounty was promised them.  Bombardment by the French soon afterwards 

began, and lasted for two {119} days, occasionally replied to by the English.  But it was not until 

the evening of the second day that the first fatality occurred, when one of the servants was killed, 

and this brought about a mutiny.  Elias Turner, the chief gunner, declared to his comrades that it 

was impossible for the Governor to hold the place, and that, for his part, he was ready to throw 

himself on the clemency of the French. Sargeant, overhearing this declaration, drew his pistol and 

threatened to blow out the gunner's brains if he did not return to his post, and the man slunk back 

to his duty.  The French now profited by the darkness to bring their cannon through the wood 

closer to the fort; and by daybreak a series of heavy balls struck the bastions, causing a breach. 

Bridgar and Captain Outlaw, then at Fort Albany, were convinced that the enemy was undermining 

the powder magazine, in which case they would certainly all be blown to pieces.  From the ship 

the French had thrown up a battery, which was separated from the moat surrounding the fort by 

less than a musket-shot.  None ventured to show himself above ground at a moment of such peril. 

A shell exploded at the head of the stairway and wounded the cook.  The cries of the French could 

now be distinctly heard outside the fort--"Vive le Roi, Vive le Roi."  In their fright and despair the 

English echoed the cry "Vive le Roi," thinking thereby to propitiate their aggressors.  But the latter 

mistook the cry for one of defiance, as a token of loyalty to an altogether different monarch, and 

the bullets whistled faster and thicker.  Sargeant {120} desired to lower the flag floating above his 

own dwelling, but there was none to undertake so hazardous a task.  Finally, Dixon, the under-

factor, offered to show himself and placate the French.  He first thrust a white cloth from a window 

and waved a lighted torch before it.  He then called in a loud voice, and the firing instantly ceased. 

The under-factor came forth, fully dressed, bearing two huge flagons of port wine.  Walking 

beyond the parapets, he encountered both Troyes and Iberville, and by the light of a full moon the 

little party of French officers and the solitary Englishman sat down on the mounted cannon, or on 

the ground beside it, broached the two flagons and drank the health of the two kings, their 

masters.  "And now, gentlemen," said Dixon, "what is it you want?"  "Possession of your fort in the 



name of his Most Christian Majesty, King Louis the Fourteenth."  Dixon, explaining that he was not 

master there, offered to conduct this message to his chief, and in a very short time the French 

commanders were seated comfortably within the house of the Governor. The demand was here 

repeated, it being added that great offence had been given by the action of the English in taking 

captive three French traders, the previous autumn, and keeping them prisoners on ground owned 

and ruled by the King of France.  For this compensation was demanded, and Sargeant was 

desired at once to surrender the fort. The Governor was surprised at such extreme measures, for 

which he was totally unprepared, but was willing {121} to surrender upon terms of capitulation.  On 

the following morning these were arranged.  It was agreed that Sargeant should continue to keep 

all his personal effects; and further, that his deputy, Dixon, three domestics, and his servant 

should accompany him out of the fort.  It was also agreed that Troyes should send the clerks and 

servants of the Company to a neighbouring island, there to await the arrival of the Company's 

ships from England.  In case of their non-arrival within a reasonable time, Troyes promised to 

assist them to such vessel as he could procure for the purpose.  The Frenchmen also gave 

Sargeant the provisions necessary to keep him and his companions from starvation. All quitted the 

fort without arms, save Sargeant and his son, whose swords and pistols hung at their sides.  The 

Governor and his suite were provided with passage to Hays Island, where he afterwards made his 

escape to Port Nelson.  The others were distributed between Forts Moose and Albany, and were 

treated by their captors with considerable severity and hardship.  Having attended to the 

disposition of his prisoners and their property, Troyes, accompanied by Iberville, departed on 10th 

August for Montreal.  The gallant Chevalier and his associates would have been glad to have 

pursued their successes by crossing the Bay and capturing York Factory.  But although two ships 

belonging to the Company had fallen to their lot, yet they could find none competent to command 

them.  The distance between Albany and Port Nelson was by water 250 leagues, and the road 

overland was {122} as yet unknown to the French.  But it was not their purpose that it should long 

remain so.  In a letter to his official superior at Quebec, Troyes, who wanted to plant the fleur-de-

lys over the whole bay, boasted that the next year would not pass without his becoming 

acquainted with it.  Wherefore Troyes suffered himself to be prevailed upon by Iberville and be 

content with the victories already won.  They carried with them in their journey more than 50,000 

beaver skins as a trophy of their arms.  Many of the Hudson's Bay Company's servants were 

employed in bearing the spoils.  During the dreary march several of these unhappy captives were 

killed through the connivance of the French with the Indians; and the survivors reached Quebec in 

a dreadfully emaciated and halt condition.  You may believe that the victories of the Chevalier 

were blazoned to the skies.  He was hailed in Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec as equal to any 

of the heroes of olden times, and his return was celebrated with great pomp.  As to his future, the 

career of the Chevalier de Troyes ended abruptly and tragically in 1687, when he and all his men, 

to the number of ninety, were massacred by the Indians at Niagara.  Governor la Barre, as you 

have heard, was an altogether different sort of man from Count Frontenac.  The Iroquois tribes, 

especially the Senecas, who had now become the strongest nation, noticed the difference at once 

when they resumed negotiations.  Instead of the dignity of command, La Barre wheedled their 

deputies, sending them away from {123} Montreal loaded with presents.  Soon afterwards, when 

he despatched a trading expedition to the Illinois region, the Senecas stopped it in its course, 



overhauled the canoes, and confiscated all the valuable goods with which La Barre (with an eye to 

great private profits) had packed them.  Such a high-handed proceeding touched the Governor in 

a very sore place--his pocket.  He became very wroth with the rascally Senecas, and swore to 

punish them for their knavery and presumption.  A force of 900 men being raised, La Barre himself 

led them to the land of the Senecas on the south side of Lake Ontario.  But so badly laid and badly 

carried out were his plans that, having got as far as the spot, since called the Bay of Famine, 

Governor la Barre called a halt and there encamped.  Each day saw some of the soldiers stricken 

down by death and disease.  The prospect was so gloomy that finally La Barre thought it best to 

come to terms with the enemy, and he therefore patched up an inglorious peace.  The name of the 

Seneca deputy at the peace conference was La Grande Gueule, or Big Jaw, so called from his gift 

of sustained eloquence. Big Jaw openly boasted that the Iroquois had not the slightest intention of 

sparing the Illinois tribe, whether the French liked it or not.  Frontenac would have smitten the 

fellow down where he stood, but La Barre was obliged to pocket this affront, and the next day the 

remnant of his troops, full of anger and indignation, marched away.  Such a peace could not, of 

course, long endure.  {124} The Iroquois torch had been kindled, an evil wind was blowing, and it 

would take more than La Barre's feeble efforts to extinguish it.  Tardy in war and too eager for 

peace had the Governor shown himself, and when he returned to Quebec found, to his 

mortification, that the King, his master, had superseded him.  His instant return to France was 

ordered, the Marquis de Denonville being appointed in his stead. Little pains did His Majesty take 

to conceal his dissatisfaction with the treaty, or his anger at the abandonment of the Illinois.  The 

new Governor very quickly found that the English colonists were intriguing with the Iroquois, 

upholding and encouraging them in acts of hostility against the French.  War, and war in earnest, 

had to come, and when 800 fresh soldiers arrived from France, Denonville began to prepare for it. 

In this he had the loyal support of the brave and wise man who also came out as the new 

Governor of Montreal, De Callires.  Unluckily, Denonville began with an act of treachery. It was a 

strange deed for a soldier and a Christian.  A number of Iroquois chiefs were enticed to Fort 

Frontenac, where they were seized, and, after being flung into prison, were sent to France to work 

all the rest of their days in the galleys.  What a fate for such haughty braves, who never worked, 

but left all labour to their poor squaws!  What wonder the revenge of the Iroquois was terrible! 

Creeping along the St. Lawrence with his army, Denonville crossed Lake Ontario, built a new fort, 

and leaving 400 men to guard it, marched towards {125} the Seneca lodges.  In the middle of July 

1687 a hot battle took place with 800 Senecas, in which, after losing six men killed and twenty 

wounded, the French drove the foe into the forest.  Four hundred thousand bushels of Indian corn 

(maize) and several herds of swine were found and destroyed.  In the meantime, however, while 

the Senecas were being punished, the danger to Montreal and the other towns was imminent, 

owing to their being without strong military protection.  To defend Chambly 120 bushrangers were 

armed, and on the island of Montreal, Callires built twenty small forts for the inhabitants to take 

refuge in, should the Iroquois descend upon them in force.  For by this time, as you can imagine, 

the whole of the Five Nations were blazing with rage, as if they had been so many bloodthirsty 

wolves.  Even in their rage they were cunning.  They had no intention of attacking Canada in force; 

that was not their method of warfare.  Crossing the border silently in batches, each singled out his 

prey, some sleeping village, or mayhap an unsuspecting farm.  Next day a few mangled corpses 



here, a heap of smoking ruins there, told the terrible tale of the Iroquois raid.  After a time the wiser 

heads amongst the Five Nations began to consider whether a conquest over the French would not 

make the Colonial English (whom they called _Ang'ais_ or Yankees) too powerful.  Suddenly they 

openly professed a desire for peace.  A deputation was sent to Canada to say that, strong as the 

Iroquois knew themselves to be, they did not mean to press for all the advantages they had the 

{126} right and power to demand.  "We know," they said, "how weak you are.  We can at any time 

burn the houses of your people, pillage your stores, waste your crops, and raze your forts."  To 


_
the other day."  "Oh, yes! So I did! So I did!" exclaimed Professor Bumper.  "I felt sure I had seen 

you before. Are you all right?"  "Yes. There haven't been any more bombs thrown at us," the 

contractor said. "By the way, Professor Bumper, I understand you are quite a traveler in the 

Andes, in the vicinity of Lima."  "Yes, I have been there," admitted the bald-headed scientist in 

guarded tones.  "Well, I am digging a tunnel in that vicinity," went on Mr. Titus, "and if you ever get 

near Rimac, where the first cutting is made, I wish you would come and see me--Tom too, as he is 

associated with me."  "Rimac-Rimac," murmured the professor, looking sharply at the contractor. 

"Digging a tunnel there? Why are you doing that?" and he seemed to resent the idea.  "Why, the 

Peruvian government engaged me to do it to connect the two railroad lines," was the answer. "Do 

you know anything about the place?"  "Not so much as I hope to later on," was the unexpected 

answer. "As it happens I am going to Rimac, and I may visit your tunnel."  "I wish you would," 

returned Mr. Titus.  Later on, in their stateroom, the contractor remarked to the young inventor: 

"Sort of queer; isn't it?"  "What?" asked Tom. "His not remembering us?"  "No, though that was 

odd. But I suppose he is forgetful, or pretends to be. I mean it's queer he is going to Rimac." 

"What do you mean?" asked Tom.  "Well, I don't know exactly what I mean," went on the tunnel 

contractor, "but our tunnel happens to start at Rimac, which is a small town at the base of the 

mountains."  "Maybe the professor is a geologist," suggested Tom, "and he may want to get some 

samples of that hard rock."  "Maybe," admitted Mr. Titus. "But I shall keep my eyes on him all the 

same. I'm not going to have any strangers, who happen to be around when bombs drop near us, 

get into my tunnel."  "I think you're wrong to doubt Professor Bumper," Tom said.  A few days after 

this, when Tom and Mr. Titus were casually discussing the weather on deck and wondering how 

much longer it would be before they reached Callao, Mr. Damon, who had been playing 

numberless games of chess, came up for a breath of air.  "Mr. Damon," called Tom, "come over 

here and meet a friend of ours, Professor Bumper," and he was about to introduce them, for the 

two, as far as Tom knew, had not yet met. But no sooner had the professor and Mr. Damon caught 

sight of each other than there was a look of mutual recognition.  "Bless my fountain pen!" cried the 

eccentric man. "If it isn't my old friend!"  "Mr. Damon!" cried the professor. "I am delighted to see 

you again. I did not know you were on board!"  "Nor I you. Bless my apple dumpling! Are you still 

after those Peruvian antiquities?"  "I am, Mr. Damon. But I did not know you were acquainted with 

Mr. Swift."  "Oh, Tom and I are old friends."  "Professor Bumper saved the lives of Mr. Titus and 

myself," said Tom, "or at least he saved us from severe injury by a bomb."  "Pray do not mention 

it, my friends," put in the professor, casually. "It was New York claimed the Iroquois as English 

subjects.  "If you are English subjects, then you must be at peace with us, for France and England 

are not now at war."  "Onontio," exclaimed the chief of the Envoys, "the Five Nations are 

independent!  We can be friends to one or both, or enemies to one or both.  Never have we been 

conquered by either of you."  In the end a truce was proclaimed, but truce or no truce, a great 

many skirmishes and massacres still went on, on both sides.  All they could do to prevent a peace 

being signed, the Hurons of Michilimackinac, allies of the French, did.  To them peace meant utter 

ruin; their numbers were too few, and they well knew Denonville could not protect them from the 

fury of the Iroquois.  Amongst the Hurons was a tall chief famous for his prowess in war and his 

gift of eloquence.  He was, according to those who knew him, the bravest and most intelligent 

chief on the whole Continent.  Kondiaronk, or "The Rat," was mortally offended that the French 



should have made even a truce without so much as consulting the wishes of their native allies.  To 

take his revenge on Denonville, he resolved to make peace impossible.  When the Iroquois 

envoys were on their way to Montreal to sign the treaty, "The Rat" lay in ambush with a band of his 

trusty Hurons.  He surprised and made them all his prisoners, slaying {127} one.  When they 

angrily explained that they were peaceful envoys, the crafty Kondiaronk professed to be greatly 

surprised, because, said he, "the French Governor himself sent me here on purpose to waylay 

you.  But if, as I believe, what you say is true, behold, I set you at liberty!  May the gods curse 

Onontio for having committed such an act of treachery!"  Thus saying, he loaded the deputies with 

gifts and bade all but one go free.  After which Kondiaronk, glorying in his perfidy, hastened to 

Michilimackinac, shaking his fist in triumph and crying, "I have killed the peace!"  He spoke then 

the truth.  The Iroquois prisoner he took with him, under the pretence of adopting him in place of 

one of his Hurons slain by the deputies on being attacked, was handed over to the French 

Commander of Michilimackinac as a spy.  In vain the victim protested that he was an envoy of 

peace between the Five Nations and the French.  In vain did he try to explain the circumstances of 

his capture.  Kondiaronk laughed in his face, telling the French Commander he must have taken 

leave of his wits, and the unhappy wretch was led to the stake.  An Iroquois captive was released 

by Kondiaronk and bidden to return to his tribe with this message, that while the French were 

making a show of wishing peace, they were secretly slaying and capturing the men of the Five 

Nations.  Months passed while the Iroquois brooded on vengeance.  Denonville's protestations 

were received in contemptuous silence.  There was now nothing to prevent formal war, for France 

and England had recommenced hostilities.  King James the Second had {128} fled from his throne 

and palace to France.  William of 


_
Of course he did not mean it just that way.  Then, naturally, Mr. Damon had to be told all about the 

bomb for the first time, and his wonder was great. He blessed everything he could think of.  "And 

to think it should be my old friend, Professor Bumper, who saved you," said the odd man to Tom 

and Mr. Titus later that day.  "Do you know him well?" asked Mr. Titus.  "Very well indeed. Our 

drug concern sells him many chemicals for his experiments."  "Well, if you know him I guess he 

can't be what I thought he was," the contractor went on. "I'm glad to know it. Why is he going to 

the Andes?"  "Oh, for many years he has been interested in collecting Peruvian antiquities. He has 

a certain theory in regard to something or other about their ancient civilization, but just what it is I 

have, at this moment, forgotten. Only I know you can thoroughly trust Professor Bumper, for a 

finer man never lived, though he is a bit absent-minded at times.  But you will like him very much." 

Thus the last lingering doubt of Professor Bumper was removed. Mr. Damon told something of 

how the scientist had been honored by degrees from many colleges and was regarded as an 

authority on Peruvian matters.  But who had placed the bomb on deck remained a mystery.  In due 

time Callao, the seaport of Lima, was reached and our friends disembarked. Tom saw to the 

unloading of the explosive, which was to be sent direct to the tunnel at Rimac. Mr. Titus, Tom and 

Mr. Damon would remain in Lima a day or so.  Professor Bumper disembarked with our friends, 

and stopped at the same hotel. Tom kept a lookout for Senor Pinto, but did not see him, and 

concluded that the Spaniard was ill, and would be carried ashore on a stretcher, perhaps.  Lima, 

the principal city and capital of Peru, proved an interesting place. It was about eight miles inland 

and was built on an arid plain about five hundred feet above sea level. Yet, though it was on what 

might be termed a desert, the place, by means of irrigation, had been made into a beauty spot. 

Tom found the older part of the city was laid out with mathematical regularity, each street crossing 

the other at right angles. But in the new portions there was not this adherence to straightness. 

"Bless my transfer! Why, they have electric cars here!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, catching sight of 

one on the line between Callao and the capital.  "What did you think they'd have?" asked Mr. 

Titus, "elephants or camels?"  "I--I didn't just know," was the answer.  "Oh, you'll find a deal of 

civilization here," the contractor said. "Of course much of the population is negro or Indian, but 

they are often rich and able to buy what they want. There is a population of over 150,000, and 

there are two steam railroads between Callao and Lima, while there is one running into the interior 

for 130 miles, crossing the Andes at an elevation of over three miles. It is a branch of that road, 

together with a branch of the one running to Ancon, that I am to connect with a tunnel."  Tom 

found some beautiful churches and cathedrals in Lima, and spent some time visiting them. He and 

Mr. Damon also visited, in the outskirts, the tobacco, cocoa and other factories.  Three days after 

reaching the capital, Mr. Titus having attended to some necessary business while Mr. Damon set 

on foot matters connected with his affairs, it was decided to strike inland to Rimac, and to try the 

effect of Tom Swift's explosive on the tunnel.  The journey was to be made in part by rail, though 

the last stages of it were over a rough mountain trail, with llamas for beasts of burden, while our 

friends rode mules.  As Tom, Mr. Damon, Koku, and Mr. Titus were going to the railroad station 

they saw Professor Bumper also leaving the hotel.  "I believe our roads lie together for a time," 

said the bald-headed scientist, "and, if you have no objections, I will accompany you."  "Come, 

and welcome!" exclaimed Mr. Titus, all his suspicions now gone.  "And it may be that you will be 

able to help me," the scientist went on.  "Help you--how?" asked Tom.  "I will tell you when we 



reach the Andes," was the mysterious answer.  It was a day later when they left the train at a small 

station, and struck off into the foothills of the great Andes Mountains, where the tunnel was 

started, that the professor again mentioned his object.  "Friends," he said, as he gazed up at the 

towering cliffs and crags, "I am searching for the lost city of Pelone, located somewhere in these 

mountains. Will you help me to find it?"     Chapter XII  The Tunnel   Mr. Damon, of the three who 

heard Professor Bumper make this statement, showed the least sign of astonishment. It would 

have been more correct to say that he showed none at all. But Tom could not restrain himself. 

"The lost city of Pelone!" he exclaimed.  "Is it here--in these mountains?" asked Mr. Titus.  "I have 

reason to hope that it is," went on the professor.  "The golden tablets are very vague, but I have 

tried many locations, and now I am about to try here. I hope I shall succeed. At any rate, I shall 

have agreeable company, which has not always been my luck on my previous expeditions seeking 

to find the lost city."  "Oh, Professor, are you still on that quest?" asked Mr. Damon, in a matter-of-

fact tone.  "Yes, Mr. Damon, I am. And now that I look about me, and see the shape of these 

mountains, I feel that they conform more to the description on the golden plates than any location I 

have yet tried. Somehow I feel that I shall be successful here."  "Did you know Professor Bumper 

was searching for a lost city of the Andes?" asked Tom, of his eccentric friend.  "Why yes," 

answered Mr. Damon. "He has been searching for years to locate it."  "Why didn't you tell us?" 

inquired Mr. Titus.  "Why, I never thought of it. Bless my memorandum book! it never occurred to 

me. I did not think you would be interested.  Tell them your story, Professor Bumper."  "I will soon. 

Just now I must see to my equipment. The story will keep."  And though Tom and Mr. Titus were 

both anxious to hear about the lost city, they, too, had much to do to get ready for the trip into the 

interior.  The beginning of the tunnel under one of the smaller of the ranges of the Andes lay two 

days journey from the end of the railroad line. And the trip must be made on mules, with llamas as 

beasts of burden, transporting the powder and other supplies.  "We'll only need to take enough 

food with us for the two days," said Mr. Titus. "We have a regular camp at the tunnel mouth, and 

my brother has supplies of grub and other things constantly coming in. We also have shacks to 

live in; but on this trip we will use tents, as the weather at this season is fine."  It was quite a little 

expedition that set off up the mountain trail that afternoon, for they had arrived at the end of the 

railroad line shortly before dinner, and had eaten at a rather poor restaurant.  Professor Bumper 

had made up his own exploring party, consisting of himself and three native Indian diggers with 

their picks and shovels. They were to do whatever excavating he decided was necessary to locate 

the hidden city.  Several mules and llamas, laden with the new explosive, and burdened with camp 

equipment and food, and a few Indian servants made up the cavalcade of Tom, the contractor, Mr. 

Damon and Koku. The giant was almost as much a source of wonder to the Peruvians as he had 

been on board the ship.  And he was a great help, too. For some of the Indians were under-sized, 

and could not lift the heavy boxes and packages to the backs of the beasts of burden.  But Koku, 

thrusting the little men aside, grasped with one hand what two of them had tried in vain to lift, and 

set it Louis, reigned in his stead.  A new English Governor, Andros, was sent out to New York to 

foment the deadly feud between the Iroquois and the Canadians.  In the month of August 1689 

burst at last the storm of the Iroquois' hatred and revenge.  One night, during a heavy shower of 

hail, 1500 dusky warriors crossed Lake St. Louis, landing silently and stealthily on the beautiful 

island of Montreal, the "Garden of Canada."  By daybreak they had grouped themselves in 



platoons, one platoon around every large dwelling for several leagues along the road at Lachine 

almost to the gates of Montreal.  The inhabitants of Lachine were wrapped in sweet slumber, soon 

and ruthlessly to be exchanged for that other slumber which knows no mortal awakening.  Let us 

conjure up the terrible picture.  At each door, in war-paint and feathers, stands a group of savages 

with upraised hatchets and huge mallets.  The signal is given; it is the dread Indian war-whoop; 

the next moment doors and windows are driven inwards.  Sleeping men, women, and children are 

dragged from their beds.  In vain they struggle in the hands of their butchers, in vain they appeal to 

those who know no pity.  They might as well appeal to wild beasts.  A few houses resist their 

attacks; when these are fired 200 unhappy beings, the hope and pride of the colony, are burnt 

alive.  Agonising shrieks rend the air.  The knife, the torch, and the tomahawk spare none, not 

even {129} the little children.  Those who do not now die under their tortures are led away to 

nameless cruelties, which will furnish rare sport to the lodges of the Five Nations.  Such was the 

awful massacre of Lachine; such the vengeance of the Iroquois.  So swift and sudden had been 

the blow that the citizens of Montreal were paralysed.  All that dreadful day the savages moved on, 

and for many days afterwards, and none came to arrest their course. Governor Denonville, to 

whose policy the calamity was due, seems entirely to have lost his nerve.  A few miles from 

Lachine a body of 200 troops, led by a brave officer named Subercase, asked to be led against 

the murderers of their countrymen.  But Denonville, in a panic, ordered Subercase to take refuge 

in Fort Roland.  All were forbidden to stir.  Another body of men, commanded by one Larobeyre, 

attempting to reach Fort Roland, were set upon and cut to pieces. More than half the prisoners 

were burnt by their conquerors. Larobeyre, wounded and unable to flee, was led captive to the 

Iroquois wigwams and roasted alive at a slow fire.  The bloodthirsty tribes remained by the St. 

Lawrence as long as they pleased; their ravages of the countryside continued for many weeks. 

Not until October did the last of them disappear.  A small party sent by Denonville to make sure 

that they had really gone, came upon a canoe bearing twenty-two departing Iroquois paddling 

across the Lake of the Two Mountains.  The chance was not one to be foregone.  Too long held in 

check, the Canadians drew near the savages, {130} who fired upon them without damage.  Then 

with a fierce joy the white men singled out each his man, raised their muskets, and when the 

explosion came eighteen Iroquois toppled over into the lake.  But considering the hundreds of 

Canadians who had been massacred, this was a paltry retribution indeed.  What wonder now that 

the men and women of Canada longed for the strong right arm and sagacious brain of Frontenac! 

Is it any marvel that they rejoiced to hear that, menaced with the loss of his North-American 

dominions, King Louis had entrusted the gallant, fiery old soldier once more with the government 

of New France.  Frontenac's return was hailed by all, nobles, soldiers, merchants, artisans, 

farmers, even by the Jesuits, who five years before had striven to send him away.  He was 

escorted to the fort with a multitude of torch-bearers.  Well he knew what a great task awaited him. 

He had now to battle not only with the Iroquois, but with the Anglo-American colonies, the 

Yankees, as they were called by the Indians, just as his master, King Louis, had to combat five 

powers at once--England, Germany, Holland, Spain, and Savoy.  Was Frontenac equal to the 

task?  Was the strain now to be placed on his shoulders too great for the powers of a hero 

seventy-two years of age?  That question let the next chapter answer.     {131}  CHAPTER IX 

"QUEBEC FOR KING LOUIS"  When Count Frontenac arrived at Quebec the massacre at 



Lachine had just thrilled all Canada with horror.  It was time to be up and doing if the French 

Canadians were not to be utterly exterminated, if New France was to be saved for King Louis, then 

at the height of his power and renown.  Callires, the Governor of Montreal, saw in the presence 

not of the Iroquois but of the English in New York the root of all Canada's troubles.  He urged his 

sovereign to strike, and King Louis had resolved to deal them a blow once and for all, from which 

they would never recover.  He would banish them from New York and plant a colony of 

Frenchmen instead.  The plan was entrusted to Frontenac to execute.  Unfortunately for the 

success of this scheme, sufficient ships and troops and money were not forthcoming at the right 

moment from France.  There followed vexatious delays, and when the French fleet at length 

crossed the ocean and anchored at Chedabucto, in Acadia, the season was too far advanced to 

begin operations.  Meanwhile Frontenac was not the man to let time dwell on his hands.  Against 

the English colonies three war-parties were organised whose deeds of blood {132} were long 

remembered in American homesteads and in Indian wigwams.  Frontenac saw that French 

prestige had sunk so low amongst the northern and western tribes that all were ready to make 

peace with the dreaded Iroquois on any terms.  At the very name of Frenchmen the meanest 

brave amongst the Five Nations laughed and spat contemptuously on the ground.  "Now, by St. 

Louis," cried Frontenac, "they shall see how weak we are!"  His fiery soul could not wait upon the 

seasons.  The three expeditions he sent forth marched amidst the ice and snow of mid-winter, for 

it was by such a stroke of daring that Canada could be saved.  The first started from Montreal, led 

by Mantet and Ste. Hlne, one of the three sons of the brave Canadian named Le Moine, and after 

incredible hardships reached the village of Schenectady, on the Hudson.  They burst upon the 

sleeping, unsuspecting villagers in the middle of the night, killing many and taking numerous 

prisoners. When the fighting was over they burned nearly the whole settlement to the ground.  The 

Indians of the party were indignant at not being able to torture the prisoners unhindered, for the 

French-Canadian leaders were not cruel by nature.  They showed gratitude to an English colonist 

named Glen, who, on a previous occasion, had treated certain French prisoners with kindness. 

Glen barricaded his house, resolved to sell his life dearly, but the Canadian captain called out to 

him to have no fear.  "We are your debtors, not your enemies. Moreover, if you have any kinsmen 

amongst {133} the captives we have taken, point them out, and they shall go free."  The Quebec 

Indians looked on sulkily while the Englishman took advantage of this handsome offer and named 

several of the prisoners.  "This Yankee pale-face has a terribly large family," their chief was heard 

to grumble.  The second war-party from Three Rivers, led by the redoubtable Franois Hertel, 

wiped out the village of Salmon Falls, butchering most of the inhabitants; while the third, under the 

command of Portneuf, attacked and captured the fort and settlement at Casco Bay. To the 

disgrace of Portneuf, he 


_
or llama.  The way was rough but they took their time to it, for the trail was an ascending one. 

Above and beyond them towered the great Andes, and Tom, gazing up into the sky, which in 

places seemed almost pierced by the snow-covered peaks, saw some small black specks moving 

about.  "Condors," said Mr. Titus, when his attention was called to them. "Some of them are 

powerful birds, and they sometimes pick up a sheep and make off with it, though usually their food 

consists of carrion."  They went into camp before the sun went down, for it grew dark soon after 

sunset, and they wanted to be prepared.  Supper was made ready by the Indian helpers, and 

when this was over, and they sat about a camp fire, Tom said:  "Now, Professor Bumper, perhaps 

you'll explain about the lost city."  "I wish I could explain about it," began the scientist.  "For years I 

have dreamed of finding it, but always I have been disappointed. Now, perhaps, my luck may 

change."  "Do you think it may be near here?" asked Mr. Titus, motioning toward the dark and 

frowning peaks all about them.  "It may be. The signs are most encouraging. In brief, the story of 

the lost city of Pelone is this. Thousands of years when they surrendered, and abandoned his 

prisoners to his Indian allies, who scalped and burnt them all.  By feats such as these the tide was 

turned.  At last the French had exhibited proofs of their prowess, and the Iroquois were not slow in 

acknowledging that they had made a mistake when they branded them with the name of cowards. 

Frontenac could strike still as heavy a blow as in the past.  The wavering North-West tribes made 

haste to assure him of their support, and the haughty Iroquois, in spite of the arguments of the 

English, sent deputies to Quebec to congratulate Onontio on his return to the land.  The furs which 

had been collecting for three years in the distant ports, with none daring enough to venture upon 

their transport, now began to pour into Montreal in hundreds of canoes.  Trade began to revive, 

and the drooping spirits of the colonists were exchanged for gladness and hope.  Could the 

redoubtable Frontenac have thought {134} that the English colonists would bear this terrible 

treatment tamely?  No! every mind and bosom there was excited by the desire for revenge. 

Moreover, they knew that now France's chief strength lay in Frontenac himself. With England 


_
know how many--there existed somewhere in Peru an ancient city that was the centre of 

civilization for this region. Older it was than the civilization of the Mexicans--the Montezumas--

older and more cultured.  "It is many years since I became interested in Peruvian antiquities, and 

then I had no idea of the lost city. But some of the antiques I picked up contained in their 

inscriptions references to Pelone. At first I conceived this to be a sort of god, a deity, or perhaps a 

powerful ruler.  But as I went on in my work of gathering ancient things from Peru, I saw that the 

name Pelone referred to a city--a seat of government, whence everything had its origin.  "Then I 

got on the track more closely. I examined ancient documents. I found traces of an ancient 

language and writings, different from anything else in the world. I managed to construct an 

alphabet and to read some of the documents. From them I learned that Pelone was a city situated 

in some fertile valley of the Andes. It had existed for thousands of years; it was the seat of learning 

and culture. Much light would be thrown on the lives of the people who lived in Peru before the 

present races inhabited it, if I could but locate Pelone.  "Then I came across two golden tablets on 

which were graven the information that Pelone had utterly vanished."  "How?" asked Tom.  "The 

golden tablets did not say. They simply stated the fact that Pelone was lost, and one sentence 

read: 'He who shall find it again shall be richly rewarded.' But it is not for that that I seek. It is that I 

may give to the world the treasures it must contain--the treasures of an ancient civilization."  "And 

how do you think the city disappeared?" asked Mr. Titus.  "I do not know. Whether it was 

destroyed by enemies, whether it was buried under the Frontenac applied, told him bluntly that he 

had need for all his soldiers in Europe.  "Your demands," wrote King Louis, "come at a wrong time. 

A defensive policy is the proper one for you to pursue." True, William the Third of England also 

could give little help to the New Englanders.  They, too, must fight their own battles.  To their own 

arms was it left to inflict chastisement on the Canadians in the north.  Accordingly, all the colonies 

met in consultation, and by great efforts a fleet of seven vessels and several hundred men was 

raised in Boston.  Sir William Phips led them forth, and Port Royal, in Acadia, was taken without 

much trouble.  Sufficient booty was captured to cover the cost of this expedition, and the New 

Englanders returned flushed with triumph and eager for a more daring blow. Meanwhile a land 

force of 1300 men, under Colonel Winthrop, had failed, through sickness and mismanagement, to 

reach Montreal by way of Lake Champlain.  A portion of this little army had followed Captain John 

Schuyler onwards, and, crossing the Canadian border, killed a few Frenchmen near Montreal. 

When it had done that, it beat a hasty retreat.  Such raids as these--for raids is all they were--

afforded little satisfaction to the English colonists, {135} burning with a desire to sweep the lilies of 

France from the New World.  Silently and speedily a plot was matured, and by the next summer it 

was ripe.  Frontenac, thinking all was secure for the present, had left Quebec to entertain a band 

of Iroquois at Montreal to a great feast and war-dance.  One morning a messenger arrived post-

haste to tell him that the enemy in their ships were sailing up the St. Lawrence.  Not a moment 

was to be lost.  Summoning the Governor of Montreal and De Ramsay of Three Rivers to follow 

him with 


_
and solitary in some valley amid the mountain fastnesses of the Andes, I do not know. But I am 

certain the city once existed, and it may exist yet, though it may be in dust-covered ruins. That is 

what I seek to find. See! Here are the tablets telling about it. I got them from an old Peruvian 

grave."  He took from a box two thin sheets of yellow metal. They were covered with curious 

marks, but Tom and the others could make nothing of them. Only Professor Bumper was able to 

decipher them.  "And that is the story of the lost city of Pelone--as much as I know," he said. "For 

years I have sought it. If I can find it I shall be famous, for I shall have added to human 

knowledge."  "If the people of that city wrote on golden tablets, the yellow metal must have been 

plentiful," commented Mr. Titus.  "You might strike a rich mine."  "I have no use for riches," said 

the professor.  "Well, I have," the contractor said, with a laugh. "That's why I'm putting through this 

tunnel. And if my lion-hearted Frontenac pressed forward with all his speed.  Ere he could reach 

Quebec the enemy's fleet had anchored off the Isle of Orleans.  Quebec was almost in a panic, 

but Frontenac's arrival instantly assuaged their fears.  He filled all with his enthusiasm. They 

resolved to die rather than yield.  Great trunks of trees and casks filled with stones were hastily 

heaped up where the walls were weakest.  On the enemy were trained the rows of cannon, and 

2700 men firmly awaited the onslaught.  Was the danger then so great?  Who was the man--who 

were the men--who thus hoped to storm the strongest citadel in New France?  A humble 

blacksmith's son was William Phips, born at Fort Pemaquid, in Maine.  In his boyhood he herded a 

drove of cattle.  But he was a clever boy, and having learned ship-carpentry, he built a little vessel 

of his own, and as a trader went to sea.  Phips was a born sailor.  In one of his many long voyages

like to see this lost city of yours, Professor Bumper. It may contain gold."  "You may have all the 

gold, if I am allowed to keep the antiquities we find," stipulated the scientist. "Then you will help 

me in my search?"  "As much as we can spare time for from the tunnel work," promised Mr. Titus. 

"I'll instruct my men to keep their eyes open for any sign of ancient writings on the rocks we blast 

out."  "Thank you," said the professor.  The of Cuba.  Phips learnt all the particulars, satisfied 

himself of his ability, and then determined to raise that ship and make himself master of her 

wealth.  At first people laughed at him, but he persevered, and at last the King had given him the 

command of a warship.  As he had promised, so Phips carried out his plan, bringing to England a 

fortune of 300,000.  With the praise of King Charles the Second ringing in his ears, as Sir William
