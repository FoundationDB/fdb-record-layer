philodendron monstera takes up the cause of the fiscal who has become embro=
iled with the governor and taken refuge in the Recollect convent, and persu=
ades him to present himself in fuerza, hoping that the governor would treat=
 him compassionately; matters turning out differently than he hopes, the ar=
chbishop, believing himself to be the cause of the evils that come upon the=
 fiscal, is attacked by severe melancholy which causes immediate death; pea=
ceful by disposition, lovable, and virtuous.  VACANT issue; and I now take =
up the thread of my story from that point, thinking it can hardly fail to b=
