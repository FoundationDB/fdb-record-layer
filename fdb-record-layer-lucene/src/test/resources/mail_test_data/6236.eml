ranging over so wide a field, is subject to shifts this way and that, leadi=
ng to a variety of breezes.=20

10. So we often have Leuconotus and Altanus blowing respectively to the rig=
ht and left of Auster;=20

Libonotus and Subvesperus to the right and left of Africus; Argestes, and a=
t certain periods the=20

Etesiae, on either side of Favonius; Circias and Corus on the sides of Caur=
us; Thracias and=20

Gallicus on either side of Septentrio; Supernas and Caecias to the right an=
d left of Aquilo; Carbas,=20

and at a certain period the Ornithiae, on either side of Solanus; while Eur=
ocircias and Volturnus=20

blow on the flanks of Eurus which is between them. There are also many othe=
r names for winds=20

derived from localities or from the squalls which sweep from rivers or down=
 mountains.  11. Then,=20

too, there are the breezes of early morning; for the sun on emerging from b=
eneath the earth strikes=20

humid air as he returns, and as he goes climbing up the sky he spreads it o=
ut before him,=20

extracting breezes from the vapour that was there before the dawn. Those th=
at still blow on after=20

sunrise are classed with Eurus, and hence appears to come the Greek name [G=
reek: euros] as the=20

child of the breezes, and the word for "to-morrow," [Greek: aurion], named =
from the early morning=20

breezes. Some people do indeed say that Eratosthenes could not have inferre=
d the true measure=20

of the earth. Whether true or untrue, it cannot affect the truth of what I =
have written on the fixing of=20

the quarters from which the different winds blow.  [Illustration: DIAGRAM O=
F THE WINDS (From=20

the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]  12. If he was wro=
ng, the only result will be=20

that the individual winds may blow, not with the scope expected from his me=
asurement, but with=20

powers either more or less widely extended. For the readier understanding o=
f these topics, since I=20

have treated them with brevity, it has It's my opinion, Joe, that the men o=
f the salvage corps run=20

quite as much risk as your fellows do in going through fire and smoke and w=
orking among falling=20

beams and tumbling walls in order to cover goods with their tarpaulins and =
protect them from=20

water."  "I admit that the salvage men do their work like heroes," said Joe=
; "but if you would read=20

our chief's report for last year, you would see that we do our best to put =
out fires with the smallest=20

possible amount of water.  Why, we only used about eleven million gallons i=
n the last twelve=20

months--a most insignificant quantity that, for the amount of work done!"  =
A tinkle of the telegraph=20

bell here cut short the conversation.  "Fire, in the Mall, Kensington," was=
 the signal.  "Get her out,=20

lads!" cried Joe, referring to the engine.  Helmets and hatchets were donne=
d and buckled on in the=20

old style, and quiet jokes or humorous and free-and-easy remarks were utter=
ed in slow, even=20

sleepy tones, while the men acted with a degree of prompt celerity that cou=
ld not have been=20

excelled had their own lives depended on their speed.  In three minutes, as=
 usual, they were off at=20

full gallop.  The Bloater--who still longed to follow them as of old, but h=
ad other business on hand--

wished them "good luck," and proceeded at a smart pace to his new lodgings.=
  We must change=20

the scene now, for the men of the Red Brigade do not confine their attentio=
ns exclusively to such=20

matters as drilling, fighting, suffering, conquering, and dying.  They some=
times marry!  Let us look=20

in at this little church where, as a passer-by remarks, "_something_ appear=
s to be going on."  A=20

tall handsome young man leads to the altar a delicate, beautiful, blooming =
bride, whose bent head=20

and blushing cheek, and modest mien and dependent air, contrast pleasantly =
with the gladsome=20

firm countenance, stalwart frame, and self-reliant aspect of the bridegroom=
.  Looking at them as=20

they stood then, no one could have entertained for a moment the idea that t=
hese two had ever=20



united in the desperate and strenuous attempt to put out a fire!  Yet so it=
=20


_
[Greek: schemata], at the end of this book: one designed to show the precis=
e quarters from which=20

the winds arise; the other, how by turning the directions of the rows of ho=
uses and the streets=20

away from their full force, we may avoid unhealthy blasts. Let A be the cen=
tre of a plane surface,=20

and B the point to which the shadow of the gnomon reaches in the morning. T=
aking A as the=20

centre, open the compasses to the point B, which marks the shadow, and desc=
ribe a circle. Put=20

the gnomon back where it was before and wait for the shadow to lessen and g=
row again until in=20

the afternoon it is equal to its length in the morning, touching the circum=
ference at the point C.=20

Then from the points B and C describe with the compasses two arcs intersect=
ing at D. Next draw a=20

line from the point of intersection D through the centre of the circle to t=
he circumference and call it=20

E F. This line will show where the south and north lie.  [Illustration]  13=
. Then find with the=20

compasses a sixteenth part of the entire circumference; then centre the com=
passes on the point E=20

where the line to the south touches the circumference, and set off the poin=
ts G and H to the right=20

and left of E. Likewise on the north side, centre the compasses on the circ=
umference at the point F=20

on the line to the north, and set off the points I and K to the right upon =
a time, devoted themselves=20

to the extinction of a fire in a cupboard with such enthusiasm that they ha=
d been successful not=20

only in putting that fire out, but in lighting another fire, which nothing =
short of union for life could=20

extinguish!  Joe Dashwood gave away the bride, and he could not help remark=
ing in a whisper to=20

the Bloater, (who was also there in sumptuous attire), that if ever a man w=
as the born image of his=20

father that man was Fred Crashington--an opinion which was heartily respond=
ed to by Mrs Maggie=20

Crashington, who, then in the period of life which is described as "fat, fa=
ir, and forty," looked on at=20

the proceedings with intense satisfaction.  Mary Dashwood--also fat, fair, =
and forty--was there too,=20

and if ever a woman congratulated herself on a rosebud having grown into a =
full blown blush-rose,=20

that woman was Mary.  Besides a pretty large company of well-dressed people=
, with white favours=20

in their breasts, there was a sprinkling of active men with sailor-like cap=
s, who hung about the=20

outskirts of the crowd, and among these were two or three stout fellows wit=
h brass helmets and=20

dirty hands and faces, and wet garments, who had returned from a recent fir=
e, just in time to take=20

a look at their comrade and his fair bride.  "Poor Ned, how his kind heart =
would have rejoiced to=20

see this day!"=20

through the centre from G to K and from H to I. Thus the space from G to H =
will belong to Auster=20

and the south, and the space from I to K will be that of Septentrio. The re=
st of the circumference is=20

to be divided equally into three parts on the right and three on the left, =
those to the east at the=20

points L and M, those to the west at the points N and O. Finally, intersect=
ing lines are to be drawn=20

from M to O and from L to N. Thus we shall have the circumference divided i=
nto eight equal=20

spaces for the winds. The figure being finished, we shall have at the eight=
 different divisions,=20

beginning at the south, the letter G between Eurus and Auster, H between Au=
ster and Africus, N=20

between Africus and Favonius, O between Favonius and  So, the wedding party=
 left the church,=20

and the firemen returned to their posts of watchfulness and duty.  About th=
e same period that this=20

wedding took place, there was another wedding in the great metropolis to wh=
ich we would draw=20

the reader's attention.  Not that it was a great one or a splendid one; on =
the contrary, if it was=20

marked by any unusual peculiarities, these were shabbiness and poverty.  Th=
e wedding party=20

consisted of only two, besides the bride and bridegroom, and everything was=
 conducted with such=20

quietness, and gravity, and absence of excitement, that it might almost hav=
e been mistaken for a=20

funeral on a small scale by any one unacquainted with the ceremonial appert=
aining thereto.  The=20

happy pair, besides looking=20
