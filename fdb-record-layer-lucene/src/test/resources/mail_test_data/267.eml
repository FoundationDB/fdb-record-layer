commerce being at times the most lucrative that can be carried on; but to remark, that had it not 

been for the strange system of trading just described, the restrictive system, and the monopoly of 

the Phillippine Company, the activity and ingenuity of private traders would have discovered other 

branches of commerce, and with them, that their own produce might suffice to pay for the piece 

broken, that I seemed to be conscious of Lizzie, continuing her melancholy drone, and battering 

monotonously on the tin pannikin, nor was I surprised when in the morning I ascertained that such 

had really been her occupation all night; for the purpose of keeping the body from harm, she 

avowed, but, I am inclined to think, much more from fear of sleeping in the neighbourhood of a 

dead body,

an instance, the English and every other nation of Europe have for a century carried betel-nut to 

China, but from the Phillippines not a nut was exported--it was a royal monopoly! and the 

merchants and growers were thus deprived of about half a million of dollars annually, that the king 

might pocket 30,000. Many other instances might be cited.  [109] The boletas "long did duty as 

paper money, passing from hand to hand." (Lala, Philippine Islands, p. 177.)--Eds.  [110] "Aunque

lucky enough to find a tree that had been blown down in the late hurricane, leaving a hollow where 

its roots had been torn out of the ground.  In this natural grave we laid the poor trooper, wrapped 

in his bark shell, and, having raised a pile of stones upon the spot, of such dimensions as to 

preclude the probability of the body being disturbed by dingoes, we went on our way, silent and 

melancholy.     AN AUSTRALIAN

(Though they should carry horned devils to Mexico, they would make money by them), was the 

gruff observation of an old soldier to the writer. The trade could not have been better 

characterized; for the very topmen and cabin servants crammed their departments full of goods of 

all kinds; and it was a very common thing to heave to, to clear the decks in the Bay of Manila. The 

"Timoneles" (quarter-masters) had always servants!  [111] The revolt of Mexico from Spain began 

in 1810, but independence was not accomplished until 1821. The first constitution of the republic 

of Mexico was proclaimed on October 4, 1824.--Eds.  [112] A ship was dispatched from Manila in 

1821, and another freighted: this last as an English ship; both were on account of the Company. 

[113] The first constitution of Spain was promulgated on March 19, 1812, during the Napoleonic 

invasion of that country. Fernando VII had been displaced on the throne by Joseph Bonaparte for 

a time, but the latter fled from Madrid, at Wellington's approach with an English army, and

repetition of the last; camps in abundance, but no blacks, and we had as yet seen no signs of the 

Townsville party.  At night we camped by the side of a large creek, and, after supper, were lying 

down, with the intention of making up for the broken slumbers of the previous night, when 

Ferdinand, who had moved higher up the stream to get a private eel for himself and his lady, came 

back and shook Dunmore, saying--  "Many big fellow fire sit down up creek."  We were on our feet 

in a moment, and, stealing quietly through the bush, soon saw the glare, and on our nearer 

approach, could make out many recumbent figures round the fire, and one man passing to and fro, 

on guard.  "By Jove!  it's the Cleveland Bay mob," said Dunmore; "we must take care they don't 

fire into us.  Lie down, or get behind trees, all you fellows, and I'll hail them."  "Holloa there!" he 

cried, when we had all "planted" (in Australian parlance signifying "concealed") ourselves.  "Don't 

fire, we're Cardwellites!"  In a moment the sentry's rifle was at his shoulder,

was restored to Spain as its king, returning in March, 1814. After long-continued struggles with the 

Liberal party, Fernando restored absolutism in that country in 1823, with the aid of a French army; 

and the Constitution was overthrown until after Fernando's death in 1833.--Eds.  [114] To account 

for the enormous difference, it will be sufficient to observe, that the Acapulco ships alone smuggle 

from 1-4th to 1-3d of their cargo (treasure) on shore--that opium which is prohibited, is smuggled 

to a considerable amount, as direction whence the voice came; but it was my old friend Abiram 

Hills, ex-mayor of Bowen, a thorough bushman, and possessed of great nerve, whose turn it then 

happened to be to keep watch over his slumbering companions. As quickly as it had been raised, 

his rifle fell into the hollow of his arm, and shouting out, "Get up, you fellows, here are the 

Rockingham Bayers!" he rushed forward, and in a moment was shaking hands with Dunmore, 

while the sleepers, uncertain whether it was an alarm, stood rubbing their eyes, and
