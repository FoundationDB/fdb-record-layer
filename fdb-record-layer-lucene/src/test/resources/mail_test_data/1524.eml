of this sort ought to be postponed until the country can bear such burdens.=
 The present permanent=20

four battalions of infantry, each containing approximately one thousand men=
; of a cavalry corps,=20

recently increased to three squadrons; and a brigade of artillery, with a f=
orce of four hundred forty-

four men, including a light-armed company. The following may also be regard=

en began to talk, with=20

bated breath, of the fearful wrath the Lord manifested because of those who=
 had lent a willing ear=20

to heretical doctrines. =E2=80=9CThis was why only the priests and holy men=
 of the church could appease=20

the Divine wrath; and if the town of Epidaurus had escaped the ruin which b=
efell all the other=20

towns along the coast, it was because the inhabitants had taken the statue =
of St. Hilary to the sea-

shore. The Saint=20

eives enough pay to=20

live comfortably, in a country where living is so cheap; "it is equivalent =
for an Indian, and even for=20

 the soldiers ought to=20
