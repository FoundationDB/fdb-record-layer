Next day the polling began. It was a day of wild excitement. Beer and spiri=
ts and food were=20

distributed _ad libitum_ to the whole population by one side and the other.=

and thirty-three, and destroyed one thousand two hundred and forty-five hou=
ses: thus displaying=20

quite as great power as any tornado observed in our own land. The speed of =
rotation was so great=20

that a bamboo cane was driven through a mud wall five feet thick, faced on =
both sides with brick;=20

as great penetrative power as is usually given to a six-pound cannon-ball.=
