It was a life of hustle and bustle, jostle and push, here to-day, and a hun=
dred miles away=20

tomorrow.  The small boy, who was up before the first pale streak of light =
appeared in the east,=20

and off to the freight-yards to see the four or five long circus trains com=
e in, could have told you=20

something about the marvelous way in which circus-men handle their strange =
caravan.  There was=20

always a crowd of these enterprising urchins standing wide-eyed and with ga=
ping mouths, while=20

the circus wonders were being unloaded.  They could have told you that the =
great gaudy vans=20

were loaded on a train of flat cars, and that a single horse working a rope=
 and pulley-block=20

trundled the vans from the train nearly as fast as their respective teamste=
rs could hitch horses to=20

them and drive away.  These boys knew that the stake and chain wagon was al=
ways the first to=20

leave the train. Some of them usually fell in behind it and followed to the=
 circus grounds, for it was=20

good sport to see men with heavy sledge-hammers drive the many stakes and s=
tretch the long=20

chain which formed the perimeter of it should be exhibited for a brief spac=
e to the people of=20

England. This was a condition which Mr. Phoebus had made in the interests o=
f art, and as a due=20

homage alike to his own patriotism and celebrity.  There was to be a privat=
e inspection of the=20

picture at the studio of the artist, and Mr. Phoebus had invited Lothair to=
 attend it. Our friend had=20

accordingly, on the appointed day, driven down to Belmont and then walked t=
o the residence of=20

Mr. Phoebus with Colonel Campian and his wife. It was a short and pretty wa=
lk, entirely through=20

the royal park, which the occupiers of Belmont had the traditionary privile=
ge thus to use.  The=20

residence of Mr. Phoebus was convenient and agreeable, and in situation not=
 unlike that of=20

Belmont, being sylvan and sequestered. He had himself erected a fine studio=
, and added it to the=20

original building. The flower-garden was bright and curious, and on the law=
n was a tent of many=20

colors, designed by himself and which might have suited some splendid field=
 of chivalry. Upon gilt=20

and painted perches, also, there were paroquets and macaws.  Lothair=20

their places.  After the stake and chain wagon, came wagons bearing the coo=
king and dining tents,=20

for breakfast is a most important matter when you have five hundred hungry =
people to feed.  By=20

nine o'clock the vast concourse were all on the circus ground, breakfast wa=
s over and=20

preparations for the great parade were on foot.  Nearly everything in the c=
ircus, with the exception=20

of the side-shows, had to take part in the parade.  Only the small boy, who=
 stands upon the=20

pavement, holding to lamp-post or iron hitching-post to steady himself in t=
he wild excitement, can=20

tell you lawn. Mr. Phoebus was highly esteemed, and had distinguished and e=
minent friends,=20

whose constant courtesies the present occasion allowed him elegantly to ack=
nowledge. There was=20

a polished and gray-headed noble who was the head of the patrons of art in =
England, whose nod=20

of approbation sometimes made the fortune of a young artist, and whose purc=
hase of pictures for=20

the nation even the furious cognoscenti of the House of Commons dared not q=
uestion. Some of=20

the finest works of Mr. Phoebus were to be found in his gallery; but his lo=
rdship admired Madame=20

Phoebus even more than=20
