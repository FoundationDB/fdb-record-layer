These are the salient points of the narrative in the Book of Samuel (2 Sam.=
 v.-viii.), and are all=20

abundantly illustrated by the psalms. We shall have next then to consider "=
The Songs of the King."=20

How did the fugitive bear his sudden change of fortune? What were his thoug=
hts when at last the=20

dignity which he had ever expected and never sought was his? The answer is =
ready to our hand in=20

that grand psalm (Ps. xviii.) which he "spake in the day that the Lord deli=
vered him from all his=20

enemies, and from the hand of Saul." The language of this superscription se=
ems to connect the=20

psalm with the period of internal and external repose which preceded and pr=
ompted David's=20

"purpose to build an house for the Lord" (2 Sam. vii.) glad to assist you."=
  The puzzled expression=20

of Chundango's face at this moment was a study: "Has Lady Broadhem told him=
 everything or=20

not?--How much does he know?--What line shall I take?" and he stroked his c=
hin doubtfully.=20

"Come, out with it," I said, sharply; "I haven't time to stand here all day=
 waiting till you decide how=20

much you will tell me and how much you won't." Now this is the kind of spee=
ch which disturbs a=20

native more than any other, but which would be inexcusable in polite societ=
y. I had lived too much=20

in the East to be trammelled with the conventionalities of Europe, and my f=
riend felt as much, for=20

he cringed at once after the manner of his race.  "I have no intention of d=
eceiving you," he said. "I=20

don't know whether Lady Broadhem has told you that we are to be united in m=
atrimony?"  "Yes," I=20


_
glows so brightly in the psalm stimulated that desire, and the emphatic ref=
erence to the mercy=20

promised by God to "his seed for evermore," which closes the hymn, points p=
erhaps to the definite=20

promise of the perpetuity of the kingdom to his descendants, which was God'=
s answer to the same=20

desire. But whether the psalm belongs to the years of the partial sovereign=
ty at Hebron, or to=20

those of the complete dominion at Jerusalem, it cannot be later than the se=
cond of these two=20

dates; and whatever may have been the time of its composition, the feelings=
 which it expresses=20

are those of the first freshness of thankful praise when he was firmly sett=
led in the kingdom. Some=20

critics would throw it onwards to the very  "Well, I want to make arrangeme=
nts by which the=20

ceremony may be accomplished without delay, for I feel the suspense is tryi=
ng. Might I ask you to=20

find out the earliest moment which would suit her convenience? I need not s=
ay that I hope you will=20

be present."  "I suppose you would prefer it, if possible, before the arriv=
al of the next mail from=20

Bombay?" I said.  Chundango, who is by no means deficient in intelligence, =
saw at a glance that it=20

was useless to attempt to deceive me. "I see that you know," he said, meekl=
y, "the terrible=20

misfortune by which I have been overtaken, through no fault of my own. I am=
 quite sure it will not=20

affect Lady Broadhem's resolution."  "I am quite sure it will," I said; "an=
d the=20
