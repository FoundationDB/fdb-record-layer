philodendron monstera prayer when attending church-service.  "Yes, to be su=

coffee afterwards did me good. I was all dressed when Morton, Aunt Lilian's=

ad to know that, though it surprised _
not for a man to speak up for himself," he said good-humoredly; "but you an=
d all the village know=20

that I've not wandered far astray. I don't pretend to be such an out-and-ou=
t saint as you are," he=20

added with a smile; "but I'm not worse than my neighbors, and I don't doubt=
 but that we'll both land=20

in heaven at last."  "And do you suppose that _I_ dare start in the voyage =
to eternity in such a=20

cockle-shell as my own merits, all leaky and worthless!" exclaimed Ned Fran=
ks. "No, no, neighbor;=20

I know too well that if I did so, I must go to the bottom. As when the floo=
d was coming upon the=20

world, there was but _one_ safe vessel, and that was the ark, so there is n=
ow but _one_ means of=20

salvation, which God himself has provided,--_faith in the Lord Jesus Christ=
_. Can we fancy that in=20

those old days of the flood there were no boats and no sailors,--that none =
could row, and none=20

could swim? It's likely that there were men who had vessels, and trusted in=
 them, and were proud=20

of them, too,--who believed that these vessels could ride through the fierc=
est storm that ever blew;=20

and that may have been the very reason why, Ivor Dundas that he hasn't spoi=
led your life."  As=20

she asked this question she was tugging away at a knot in the ribbons that =
tied the bag she had=20

found.  "Perhaps I shall," I answered. "I might do worse."  "I should think=
 you might!" exclaimed=20

Lisa. "Oh, do accept him soon. I don't want Ivor Dundas to say to himself t=
hat you're broken-

hearted for him. Lord Bob is sure to propose to you to-morrow--even if he h=
asn't already: and if he=20

has, he'll do it again. I saw it in his eye all to-day. He was dying to spe=
ak at any minute, if only he'd=20

got a chance with you alone. You _will_ say 'yes' when he does, won't you, =
and have the=20

engagement announced at once?"  "I'll see how I feel at the time, if it com=
es," I answered, trying to=20

speak gaily, but making a failure of it.  At last Lisa had got the brocade =
bag open, and was looking=20

in. She seemed surprised by what she saw, and very much interested. She put=
 in her hand, and=20

touched the thing, whatever it was; but she did not tell me what was there.=
 Probably she wanted to=20

excite my curiosity, and make me ask. But I didn't care enough to humour he=
r. If the bag had been=20


_
warning, these men would not fly to the ark; and so, when the flood came, t=
hey perished. _My_=20

only hope of heaven is in the merits and death of my Lord. I don't fear dea=
th, because I know that=20

I've already taken refuge in the ark of salvation, which is faith in Christ=
, the Saviour of sinners."=20

"These things are too deep for me," said the carpenter. "I'm a simple, plai=
n man, and don't puzzle=20

my head with matters of doctrine. I never can make out what you thorough-go=
ing people consider=20

yourselves to be. There are saints and sinners in the world, that's clear. =
Nancy Sands is a sinner,=20

and you are a saint,--nay, don't stop me, I must have out my say. Now, I do=
n't count myself much=20

either of a saint or a sinner; I'm a plain, honest man, who don't like shou=
ldn't have been interested=20

in the least. I saw Lisa give a little sidelong peep up at me, to see if I =
were watching; but when she=20

found me looking entirely indifferent, she tied up the bag again and stowed=
 it away in one of the=20

deep pockets of her travelling cloak.  I was afraid that, when we'd arrived=
 at the hotel and gone up=20

to our rooms Lisa might want to stop with me, and be vexed when I turned he=
r out, as I felt I must=20

do. But she seemed to have lost interest in me and my affairs, now that all=
 doubt was settled. She=20

didn't even wish to talk over what had happened; but when I bade her good-n=
ight, simply said,=20

"good-night" in return, and let me shut the door between the rooms.  "I sup=
pose," I thought, "that=20

the best thing I shall have to hope for=20


_
I shall do just as well as others in the end. But what puzzles me," continu=
ed the carpenter, "is that=20

the saints will insist upon it that they are the sinners; they flare up, as=
 you did now, at the very=20

notion of being taken to heaven because they after this, until I grow quite=
 old, is to sleep, and be=20

happy in my dreams." But though I tried hard to put away thoughts of all ki=
nds, and fall asleep, I=20

couldn't. My eyes would not stay closed for more than a minute at a time; a=
nd always I found=20


_
that they can't be safe unless they declare that they are sinful!" The inva=
lid would have laughed=20

aloud, had there not been a grave earnestness in the face of Franks, which =
checked any such=20

unseemly mirth.  "And is not the prayer in the Litany, Have mercy upon us m=
iserable sinners, put=20

into every mouth?" observed Franks, who had a clear recollection of the ver=
y after hour, hoping for=20

the light.     CHAPTER XV   DIANA HEARS NEWS  It seemed as if the night wou=
ld never end. If I=20

had been vain, and deserved to be punished for my vanity, then I was well p=
unished now; I felt so=20

ashamed and humiliated.  It must have been long after one when I went to be=
d, yet I was thankful=20

when dawn came, and gave me an excuse to get up.=20
