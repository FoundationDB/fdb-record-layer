t important and prominent _
exhibitors themselves in every instance except one, in which one the result=
 was unimportant.  The=20

special feature to which I desire to call your attention may perhaps be bes=
t understood if I express=20

my own views in regard to it.  At present it is the practice for one commit=
tee of judges to make the=20

awards on the animals of each breed in their several rings of yearlings, tw=
o-year-olds, and three-

year-olds. After that has been done it is the practice for another committe=
e to select the=20

sweepstakes animals from among all the entries of all ages of that breed wi=
thout regard to the=20

prizes which the former committee may have awarded.  Now it not infrequentl=
y happens, and is=20

always liable to occur, that the latter committee selects as the best anima=
l of any age one which=20

the former committee did not deem worthy of any prize at all or at least no=
t a first prize, when=20

judged by them in competition with these of its own age only. Evidently the=
re is a mistake=20

somewhere. Both decisions can not be correct. Both committees, we are bound=
 to assume are=20

equally honest, disinterested, and competent, because the members of both c=
ommittees=20

considered in making up a decision such discrepancy of judgment and the sys=
tem which renders it=20

possible may be almost excusable, perhaps, but in the Fat Stock Show, where=
 we deal so fully in=20

details and exact figures, and where we pretend to use our best efforts in =
every practical manner=20

to get at and publish for the benefit of a confiding world the reliable, bo=
ttom facts obtained by the=20

labors of paid experts, reach a conflicting record is not, in any judgement=
, one to be greatly proud=20

of.  There is one plain, just and proper remedy for this, to wit: Restrict =
the award of sweepstakes=20

prizes in the several breed rings to such animals as have taken first premi=
ums in the rings for=20

ages, and restrict competition for _grand sweepstakes_ to such animals as h=
ave taken=20

_sweepstake_ prizes in the breed rings as have not otherwise competed at al=
l. The awards of all=20

special prizes should follow the decisions in the regular rings when not of=
fered for animals not=20

included in the regular rings.  Under this rule every animal competing for =
a sweepstakes prize, with=20

possible exceptions in the grand sweepstakes, would have received the highe=
st indorsement of=20

the committees, and hence there could be no pretense of prejudice on the pa=
rt of the judges and=20

hence, too, it would matter very little whether a new competent committee w=
ere called for the=20

grand sweepstakes or that committee was composed of judges who served in th=
e rings, the latter,=20

in my opinion, being preferable, because of their larger opportunity in bec=
oming familiar with the=20

points of difference between the competing animals.  I am persuaded that no=
 objection to the=20

remedy as I have stated it, would or could properly be made except by those=
 whose animals were=20

not included in and Norfolk. In Washington and Canaan, it constitutes the r=
ock of the high=20

mountains, and is a part of the same range in the other towns, while the va=
lleys and the more=20

moderate elevations are covered with limestone.  The river Housatonic appea=
rs to have made its=20

way through this range, for the same rock continues on the western side of =
the river parallel to it in=20

the mountains of Kent, Sharon, and Salisbury. In Litchfield commences a ran=
ge of porphyritic=20

granite, or _porphyritic gneiss_, which alternates with the common gneiss, =
and in some instances=20

rests upon it. This rock begins at Mount Prospect, between Litchfield and W=
arren, and runs=20

through South Farms, Bethlem, and Watertown. The crystals of feldspar in it=
, are often very=20

perfect.  The primitive granite, as a rock, is not found, though it lies sc=
attered on the surface in=20

great quantities, and large masses. The graphic granite in this region is o=
ften remarkably fine.=20

Mica slate constitutes a considerable part of those rocks that rest on the =
gneiss, though never=20

found in such elevated situations. The mica slate rocks are always inclined=
 at a great angle with=20



the horizon, and follow the direction of the other range. Litchfield villag=
e, Chesnut hill, and great=20

part of Harwington, are entirely composed of this rock. The Bantum and the =
Waterbury rivers have=20

their bottoms of it. Some of the brooks entering the Waterbury, have cut th=
eir passage through the=20

mica slate, leaving walls of 40 or 50 feet on each side, traversed by veins=
 of a very coarse-grained=20

granite, and often much mixed with sulphuret of iron. The slate near Harwin=
gton meeting-house=20

contains a great quantity of sulphuret of iron. Mica slate likewise lies on=
 the sides of the gneiss=20

range in Canaan and Salisbury, where it dips under the limestone. _Sienite_=
 is scattered on the=20

surface in large masses, especially where the porphyritic gneiss is found. =
Sometimes, however,=20

the masses are so large as to form mountains. Mount Tom, between Litchfield=
 and Washington, is=20

of this nature, being entirely composed of sienite, resting on gneiss. Slat=
y sienite is frequently=20

found, having a very large proportion of hornblende.  The minerals that are=
 found in this region,=20

are much more interesting than its geology. In describing them, I shall con=
fine myself to the district=20

east of the limestone range, intending at some future time to investigate a=
nd describe the=20

limestone country.  Carbonate of lime, the granular limestone, is scattered=
 over the whole of this=20

region. It often is found in the cavities of decayed quartz rocks, and cont=
ains tremolite and augite.=20

_Cyanite_ or _Sappar_, is found in great quantities, especially in Harwingt=
on and Litchfield. A=20

crystalline mass of this was found a few years ago, weighing probably 15 cw=
t.; it lay on a mica=20

slate ridge, and undoubtedly had been formerly imbedded in the slate. Beaut=
iful white talc,=20


_
objection I have ever heard to the adoption of the rule, even at the fairs,=
 is based on the idea that=20

those animals (or the owners) failing to take prizes in the rings for ages,=
 should have a "new trial"=20

before an entirely new jury in sweepstakes. But how about those who won the=
 verdict in the first=20

trial! Is there any justice in requiring them to submit to another trial be=
tween themselves and those=20

they have once vanquished? and if there is any propriety in that, why not i=
n still another new trial=20

and more new trials before new juries until every animal in the show has re=
ceived a first prize, or=20

the treasury has been exhausted or the community fails to furnish any more =
jurymen?  If it were=20

simply the "consolation stakes" to non-prize winners, some loose practice m=
ight seem justifiable,=20

but it is not the best policy in conducting the competitions of the Fat Sto=
ck Show to be influenced=20

by any considerations except those which relate to fair, impartial and inte=
lligent decisions, and no=20

decisions can be fair, impartial and intelligent which conflict with each o=
ther and which, as a whole,=20

fail to form a consistent record.  JOHN P. REYNOLDS,     Supt. Class A.    =
     *       *       *       *=20

*  James F. Scott purchased 200 mares and 500 one and two year old colts to=

MULES.   Where land is not too high, and pasturage good as well as cheap, k=
eeping good mares=20

from which young mules can be raised is certainly a profitable business; es=
pecially so where corn=20

and hay are grown on the farm, and the mares can be profitably worked at le=
ast part of the year.=20

With a liberal supply of corn fodder for winter feeding, and a good pasture=
, with hay and corn=20

during the coldest weather, and when at work, this branch of farming is not=
 only easy, but certain=20

and profitable. A mare in good condition, not counting pasturage, can be ke=
pt for eight dollars=20

disseminated in the mass. Specimens of this mass are in almost all the cabi=
nets in America.=20

Smaller masses have been found associated with feldspar. Small crystals of =
this mineral are very=20

common in mica slate, with staurotide and garnet. Two of these crystals are=
 often arranged at right=20

angles with each other. In Cornwall it is found in small crystals in the gn=
eiss containing graphite.=20

_Staurotide_ is very common and very beautiful. It is found principally in =
mica slate, and exhibits=20

often the cross. It most generally is crystallized in four-sided prisms.  _=
Quartz_, of course, is=20

common. Cornwall particularly is distinguished for the _smoky_ variety. Fer=
ruginous quartz is=20

found in rolled masses in the whole of this range.  _Petro silex_, in rolle=
d masses with ferruginous=20

quartz, containing veins of _chalcedony_ and _hornstone_, and geodes of qua=
rtz crystals, are=20

common in Litchfield and Goshen. Sometimes these masses in the interior ass=
ume the=20

appearance of Burrstone.  _Common opal_ has been found in Litchfield, thoug=
h rarely. It was part=20

of a mass of ferruginous quartz, with indelible dendritic impression. It is=
 very hard, and its fracture=20

is conchoidal.  _Mica_ is very common. It is found green, white, and perfec=
tly black. It generally=20

occurs in blocks of granite.  _Schorl_, in rounded crystals, is found in al=
l the granite in this range;=20

in radiating crystals on quartz; and in acicular crystals on mica slate. Th=
e large crystals are so=20

brittle, that few of them can be obtained perfect. I once found it in Litch=
field, near Plymouth, in=20

prismatic crystals on earthy graphite.  Feldspar is very common and beautif=
ul in all the towns. It is=20

usually found in rhomboidal fragments, and has a fine lustre. It is blue, w=
hite, and red. Some of the=20

granite of Torringford is very beautiful, being composed of white and smoky=
 quartz, red feldspar,=20

and green mica. In the porphyritic gneiss, feldspar is in six-sided prisms.=

keeping of mare and service cost fourteen. There has been no time since I c=
ame to this part of the=20

State when a mule colt would not bring all the way from twenty-five to fift=
y dollars, depending, of=20

course, upon the size, form, and general condition at weaning time. Allowin=
g nothing for the work=20

the mare would be able to do, which certainly ought to be sufficient to pay=
 for her keep, there is left=20

a good margin for profit. Or if we count the interest on the money invested=
 in the mare, still we=20

have a good profit left. The difference paid for young mules shows two fact=
s: first, the importance=20

of a good sire, or jack, and the other of a well-formed mare. It certainly =
costs no more money to=20

keep a well-formed animal than it does to keep a poor one. Of course, at th=
e start, one may=20

require a somewhat larger outlay of money, and in this way, if we count the=
 interest on the money=20

invested, cause young mules to cost a trifle more than if cheaper animals w=
ere used. But this is=20

more than compensated for by the larger price the colt will bring.  The dif=
ference between a mare=20

that will bring a mule that only sells for the lowest price here at weaning=
 time, twenty-five dollars,=20

and one that brings a mule that will sell for fifty, the highest generally =
obtained, would make quite=20

an item in the amount of profit to be derived from her keep, and especially=
 where the same=20

animals are kept quite a number of years for this purpose, as is often the =
case.  And this is not all;=20

the mule will himself pay handsomely for keeping. Mules a year old, that ar=
e broken to the halter,=20

so that they can be led, bring from eighty to one hundred dollars. When two=
 years old, and broken=20

to to the wagon as well as saddle, one hundred to one hundred and twenty-fi=
ve dollars is the=20

general price. Of course a pair of well matched mules, well broken to harne=
ss, at three or four=20

years, will sell all the way from three to five hundred dollars, depending =
upon their color, form,=20

size, etc. And this difference is, in nearly all cases the result of the di=
fference between good and=20

poor jacks, as well as good and poor mares. One other point must always be =
taken into account in=20

this work, and that is in having mares that are sure breeders.  I find that=
 those who have made=20

most money out of this line of farming or stock-raising are those who, when=
 they have secured a=20

valuable brood mare that is sure of bringing a first-class mule colt, they =
not only keep her, but they=20

take good care of her; and in this way they secure the very best results an=
d realize the largest=20

profits.  Where proper care is taken not to overwork or strain them, mares =
can always be profitably=20

worked in planting and cultivating the corn crop, as well as cribbing it in=
 the fall; fully enough work=20

can be done to pay for what they eat and by E. Wilkins, Esq.  _Beryl_, both=
 crystallized and=20

massive, is often found in Litchfield in granite. Its colours are green, gr=
eenish yellow, pale yellow,=20

and brown. Its crystals are often very perfect.  _Garnets_ are common in al=
l the towns of this=20

range.  _Epidote._ Very beautiful crystals of this mineral have been found =
in Washington,=20

associated with feldspar. They are so rounded as to render it very difficul=
t to discover their form.=20

They have a very fine lustre, and are of an olive green; in Litchfield, in =
crystals with hornblende,=20

and graphic granite, and in veins in sienite.  Perhaps no region can be fou=
nd containing more=20

beautiful _tremolite_. All its varieties occur; the fibrous of Litchfield a=
nd Bethlem is very=20

distinguished. In Canaan, it is found containing crystals of sulphuret of i=
ron. I do not speak here of=20

the tremolite found in the limestone range.  _Common asbestus_ exists in Wa=
shington and New=20

Milford.  The white _augite_ is a mineral found in this range; in Litchfiel=
d, in six-sided prisms very=20

much flattened, on quartz, and carbonate of lime with tremolite. They somet=
imes occur several=20

inches long.  The _lamellar_ and _slaty_ varieties of common _hornblende_ a=
re very common.=20

Radiated _actynolite_ of a beautiful bluish green in Litchfield; in Canton =
of a brownish green.=20



_Steatite_ is common, and is quarried in Litchfield. The varieties of _talc=
_ are very common,=20

connected with steatite, cyanite, and chlorite.  _Chlorite_ in Litchfield, =
is found on quartz, with talc.=20

Porcelain clay in Litchfield in small quantities, and in Washington.  _Grap=
hite_ is found in Cornwall=20

in great quantities. Its gangue is gneiss and sienite. It is lamellar, and =
has a metallic lustre; is=20

easily obtained, and might be made useful. Epidote and cyanite are found wi=
th it.  _Ores_ are not=20

common. Oxides of iron, and sulphuret of iron are scattered over the whole =
range. Near Mount=20

Prospect in Litchfield, sulphuret of iron in mass is in great quantities; a=
nd sulphate of iron on the=20

surface of the ground near it. A stone containing a few grains of _native c=
opper_ was found in=20

Litchfield.  The red oxyde of _titanium_ occurs in Litchfield sparingly. A =
very handsome specimen=20

of the _reticulated oxyde of titanium_, was picked up. It was on mica, and =
the mica had an evident=20

tendency towards the same form.     BOTANY.     ART. VI. _An Account of two=

out the time that=20

pastures fail, and corn fodder, wheat straw, and hay, with a small amount o=
