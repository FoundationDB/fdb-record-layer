 in Johnstown. To him=20

and his family the deluge came without a moment=E2=80=99s warning. They wer=
e in an upper room, fearing,=20

suspecting nothing, till they saw houses not half a square away starting fr=
om their places, reeling=20

and crackling onward over fences, telephone poles and fruit-trees, and jost=
ling against each other.=20

Before they could fly in any direction, they were waist-deep in water. Bene=
ath the lower sash=20

which was raised, Mr. Miller sprang out upon some floating timbers, urging =
his wife to follow. She,=20

however, mounted the bed, which being instantly forced up to the ceiling sh=
e was almost=20

smothered. The water had closed the opening beneath the sash, and up to her=
 neck in water she=20



now set herself desperately to effect an opening at the top of the window, =
but she only tore her=20

hands in the vain attempt to wrench away the slat. Mr. Miller, by this time=
 recovering from his first=20

plunge, with one hand caught hold of the spout beneath the eaves, and with =
the other, battered=20

through two panes of glass, cutting himself badly. Drawing up one foot, wit=
h it he now kicked out=20

the sash, when his wife dived out under the lintel, expecting to reach foot=
ing on the roof of a small=20

porch below. The porch, however, was gone, and she disappeared deep beneath=
 the turbid flood.=20

A moment later, by some violent ebullition of the water, she was thrown to =
the surface, and at=20

once laid hold on the spout. Meanwhile, the house was drifting rapidly towa=
rd Stony Creek. When=20

the vast number of houses adrift struck the hill beyond the stream there wa=
s a fearful rebound;=20

many houses were crushed to splinters, many were upset, and scores of cling=
ing wretches were=20

mangled, killed, or plunged into the water and drowned. The current, arrest=
ed by the hill, divided; a=20

part turned to the left up Stony Creek, carrying many houses nearly a mile;=
 part turned to the right,=20

to add its freightage of life and ruin to the already tremendous gorge abov=
e the bridge, while=20

between these currents a central portion was rolled back in the direction w=
hence it came. On this=20

portion Mr. Miller=E2=80=99s house was carried, till wandering round and ha=
ving described two-thirds of a=20

complete circle, by the subsidence of the water it found rest at last not m=
ore than a hundred yards=20

from its original position. During much of this journey the pastor and his =
wife, up to their necks in=20

water, and battered and bruised incessantly by the terrible drift, were cli=
nging to the spout. At last=20

two of their neighbors being in some manner, incomprehensible to themselves=
, thrown upon the=20

roof and sitting on the comb, after a time espied beneath the eaves the hea=
ds of the unfortunate=20

couple. To creep down to the edge of the steep roof, slippery through inces=
sant rain and recover=20

the pastor and his wife was an undertaking fraught with extreme peril, yet =
these men, as did=20

hundreds more in this awful hour, freely risked their lives in the effort t=
o save others. A little later a=20

woman and a boy were recovered, and brought to the same roof, on the comb o=
f which six=20

persons now sat until nightfall, when the house having ceased from its wand=
erings, they managed=20

to creep into the attic. This being unfinished, there was no floor on which=
 even the sick could lie;=20

so, in the dark, in their torn and wet and filthy garments,=20

to render doubtful their recovery.  Mr. Calliver, a machinist, had his dwel=

wards of the city. His wife, an invalid, had not walked for seven years. He=
 was watching the flood,=20

and telling his neighbors that the worst was already past, when, looking up=
 the river, he saw=20

houses bounding from their places and skurrying towards him. He shouted to =
his family at once to=20

flee to the attic, but, before they could reach it they were knee-deep in w=
ater. The house was=20

floated, and borne swiftly away, but fortunately did not turn over. It drif=

struck upon something, and was held fast, while other buildings were drifte=
