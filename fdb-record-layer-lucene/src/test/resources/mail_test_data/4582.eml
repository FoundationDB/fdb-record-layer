 all over her head, so=20

eyes. In the evening the=20

 So funny and so=20

earnest; so small, and yet so great with purpose.  "I don't think I've any =

loud, she said: "I do=20

could manage him?"  "I know he could."  "Then let us pray for his return," =
said Meg.  The clock on=20

 one cigarette first.=20

That's what's so lovely about being with you, Jan--you don't mind. Of cours=

cessity to her as to=20

many men, and the long abstinence of term-time had always been a penance.  =
She made some=20

good rings, and, leaning forward to look through them at Jan, said: "By the=
 way, I must just tell you=20

fifty years previous to=20

that date.  One Charles Considine Smith, who had been a shipper of sherry i=

City of London, bought it in that year from a Quaker called Solomon Page, w=
ho planted the yew=20

hedge that surrounds the smooth green lawn seen from the windows of the mor=

was a curious clause attached to the title-deeds, which stipulated that no =
cats should be kept by=20

the owner of Wren's End, lest they should interfere with the=20


_
once seen, no words are needed to tell why these lovely plains, all ready f=

moistened with sufficient rainfall annually, were so attractive to the earl=

first serious efforts at colonization.   THE COLUMBIA RIVER.  All waters of=
 eastern Washington=20

reach the ocean through the Columbia river, uniting the entire region in on=
e spirit of fraternity. The=20

grandest and most reaching scenic feature of the region, it supplies unlimi=
ted water for successful=20

irrigation and power purposes, and in places still provides the principal m=
ode of transportation.=20

Between Kettle Falls and the Snake river are a number of important rapids, =
chief of which is Priest=20

Rapids, just below Saddle Gap, ten miles long with a descent of seventy fee=
t and a possible horse=20

power of half a million.  Just above the mouth of the Snake river are the c=
ities of hedge, or the=20

brown wrens building at the foot of the hedges in the orchard. Appended to =
this injunction were the=20

following verses:      If aught disturb the wrens that build,     If ever l=
ittle wren be killed     By dweller=20

in Wren's End--      Misfortunes--whence he shall not know--     Shall fall=
 on him like noiseless=20

snow,     And all his steps attend.      Peace be upon this house; and all =
    That dwell therein good=20

luck befall,     That do the wrens befriend.  Charles Considine Smith faith=
fully kept to his=20

agreement regarding the protection of the wrens, and much later wrote a ser=
ies of articles upon=20

their habits, which appeared in the _North Cotswold Herald_. He seems to ha=
ve been on friendly=20

terms with Solomon Page, who, having inherited a larger property in the nex=
t county, removed=20

thence when he sold Wren's End.  In 1824 Smith married Tranquil Page, daugh=
