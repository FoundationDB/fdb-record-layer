chiefly peopled.  Farther along toward evening the great range, which had been visible for hours in 

the westward vista, began to define itself in peaks and high, bald shoulderings of wind-swept 

mesas. Here was something definite and tangible for the stirring underman to lay hold upon. 

Blount, the sober-minded, the self-contained, found a curious transformation working itself out in 

quickened pulses and exhilarating nerve-tinglings. Boston, the Law School, the East of the narrow 

walk-ways and the still narrower rut of custom and convention, were fading into a past which 

already seemed age-old and half forgotten. He threw open the window at his elbow and drank in 

deep inspirations of the hill-sweeping blast. It was sweet in his nostrils, and the keen crispness of 

it was as fine wine in his blood. After all, he had been but a sojourner in the other world, and this 

was his homeland.  At the dining-car dinner, which was served while the higher peaks of the main 

range were as vast islands floating in a sea of crimson and gold, Blount missed the man of many 

troubles. The dining-car was well filled, and, though the faces of the diners were all unfamiliar, the 

hum of talk, the hurrying of the waiters, and the subdued clamor drowning itself in the under-drone 

of the drumming wheels answered well enough for companionship. There are times when even 

the voice of a friend is an intrusion, and the returning exile had happed upon one of them. 

Largeness, the inspiring breadth of the immensities, was what he craved most; and when he had 

cut the many-coursed dinner short, he hurried back to his Pullman window, hoping that he might 

have the smoking-compartment to himself again.  The unspoken wish was granted. When he 

entered the smoking-room he found it empty; and, filling his cutty pipe, he drew the cushioned 

wicker chair out to face the open window. Fresh glimpses of the northward landscape shortly 

brought a renewal of the heart-stirrings; and when he finally had the longed-for sight of a bunch of 

grazing cattle, with the solitary night-herd hanging by one leg in the saddle to watch the passing of 

the train, the call of the homeland was trumpeting in his ears, and he would have given anything in 

reason to be able to changes places, temporarily at least, with the care-free horseman whose wiry, 

muscular figure was struck out so artistically against the dun-colored hillside.  "Would I really do 

such a thing as that?" he asked himself half incredulously, when the night-herd and his grazing 

drove had become only a picturesque memory; and out of the heart-stirrings and pulse-

quickenings came the answer: "I more than half believe that I would--that I'd jump at the chance." 

Then he added regretfully: "But there placed the craft broadside to the Moorish steamer, so that 

the "Big Four" could see her out the cabin windows.  The pirate made no demonstration of any 

kind, and the dinner was disposed of in good order, and with hardly an allusion to the exciting 

events that were expected. Pitts was instructed to give the engineers their dinner as soon as 

possible; for all hands might be needed at any moment.  "Heave the lead, Flix; it begins to look 

like shoal water around us," said the captain when they returned to the forecastle.  The great rock 

was of a light color, and could be distinctly seen from the deck. A portion of it rose about six feet 

above the surface of the water when the Maud anchored, and the receding tide now permitted two 

feet more of the projecting cone to be seen.  "By the mark two," reported Felix, as he drew up the 

line.  "Twelve feet; we have not much to spare under the keel," added the captain. "We had 

fourteen feet when we anchored, and the tide has been ebbing five hours."  "Hold on, Captain 

Scott!" shouted Felix, as he carried the lead-line to the other side of the vessel. "I have been 

measuring on the top of a bulging rock. And a half two!"  "Fifteen feet; that looks more like it. There 

ought to be about three feet ebb and flow here, and your sounding gave about double that, Flix." 



"It was the fault of the rock on the bottom, Captain;" but the leadsman heaved the line all around 

the steamer with the same result.  There was nothing to do except to observe the Fatime; but she 

did nothing, and there was no appearance of any movement on her deck.  "I think we had better 

attend to that lesson now, as we have nothing else to do," said the captain after they had looked 

about them for a time. "I don't care to have the pirate suppose we are on the anxious seat."  "All 

right," replied Louis, as he seated himself on the rail by the bow flag-pole. "I have studied my 

lesson, and I am all ready."  "Blaze away, then," replied the captain.  "If any of you have not yet 

found it out, I will begin by informing you that the land on three sides of us belongs to the island of 

Cyprus, and you are again on Turkish territory. The owners of the island call it Kebris, written by 

them G'br's, if you can make anything of that combination of consonants," Louis began, spelling 

out the strange names he introduced. "The Greeks call it Kupros, and the French, Chypre. Venus 

was the original goddess of spring among the Romans, but became the goddess of love, the 

Aphrodite of the Greeks, and was worshipped as such in this island by the Phoenicians and other 

ancients.  "One of this lady's names was Cypris, or Cypria; and that is why the island happens to 

be called Cyprus. It is in about the same latitude as

"Any chance to do what?" rumbled a mellow voice at his elbow, and Blount turned quickly to find 

that a big, bearded man, smoking an abnormally corpulent cigar, had come in to take his seat on 

the divan.  At another time Blount, the conventional and Syria on the east. It is 140 miles long by 

60 in breadth, containing 3,707 square miles, or larger than both Rhode Island and Delaware 

united.  "It has two ranges of mountains extending east and west, the highest peak being 6,352 

feet. It has

self-conscious and embarrassed, as any human being is when he is caught talking to himself. But 

with the transformation had come a battering down of doors in the house of the broader fellowship, 

and he laughed good-naturedly.  "You caught me fairly," he acknowledged. "I thought I still had the 

place to myself."  "But the chance?" persisted the big man, looking him over appraisively. "You 

don't look like a man who has had to hang round on the aidges hankerin' after things he couldn't 

get."  "I guess I haven't had to do that very often," was the reflective rejoinder. "But a mile or so 

back we passed a bunch of cattle, with the night man riding watch; I was just saying to myself that 

I'd like to change places with that night-herd--only there wasn't going to be any chance."  The 

bearded man's laugh was a deep-chested rumbling suggestive of rocks rolling down a declivity. 

"Lordy gracious!" he chuckled. "If you was to get a leg over a bronc', and the bronc' should find it 

out--Say, I've got a li'l' blue horse out on my place in the Antelopes that'd plumb give his ears to 

have you try it; he shore would. You take my advice, and don't you go huntin' a job night-ridin' in 

the greasewood hills. Don't you do it!"  "I assure you I hadn't thought of doing it for a permanency. 

But just for a bit of adventure, if the chance should offer while I'm in the notion. I believe I'd take it. 

I haven't ridden a cow-pony for fourteen years, but I don't believe I've lost the knack of it."  "Ho!" 

said the big man. "Then you ain't as much of a tenderfoot as you look to be. Shake!" and he held 

out a hand as huge as a bear's paw. Following the hand-grip he grew confidential. "'Long in the 

afternoon I stuck my head in at the door and saw you chewin' the rag with a thin-faced old nester 

that couldn't set still in his chair while he talked. Know him?"  "Not at all," said Blount promptly. "He 

has the section opposite mine, and he got on at Omaha."  "Well, I wouldn't want to know him if I 

was you," was the bearded man's comment. Then: "Tryin' to get you to invest in some o' his 

properties?"  "Oh, no."  "Well, he will, if he gets a chance. He'd go furder'n that; he'd nail you up to 

the cross and skin you alive if there was any money in it for him. His name's Simon Peter, and it 

ort to be Judas. I know him down to the ground!"  "Simon Peter?" said Blount inquiringly.  "Ya-as; 

Simon Peter Hathaway. And my name's Griggs; Griggs, of the except after heavy rains, or when 

the snow melts on the mountains. There is no room for lakes of any size, though there is a small 

one on the east coast, which dries up completely in summer, like the rivers, but has an abundance 

of fish in winter. This is rather remarkable, and the fact is not doubted, though the phenomenon 

has not been explained."  "The fish must go down where the water goes," laughed Felix. "If there 

are any volcanoes here, I suppose they come up in the winter all boiled or broiled ready for the 

table."  "I don't know how that is, Flix, and we haven't time to investigate the matter. The interior of 

the island is mostly composed of a great plain, which was once famous for its crops of grain; but 

the system of irrigation which prevailed has been discontinued, and its fertility no longer exists. In 

a scarcity of rain five years ago there was almost a famine in the island.  "As you have seen for 

yourselves, there is a deficiency of harbors, and this bay is a fair specimen of them. It has two 

places they call seaports, but they are not worthy of the name. They are on the south side, and in 

such a blow as we had last night, they afford no shelter to shipping from southerly storms; and 

Captain Scott was wise in coming here instead of going to Limasol, which is just inside of Cape 

Gata. The ports on this side of the island would be similarly exposed in a northerly storm. Safe 

ports are necessary for the commerce of a country or an island, and therefore to its prosperity.  "In 

ancient times there were ports at Salamis, Paphos, and Famagusta, in the eastern part of the 

island, which was the portion celebrated in the past. The capital is Leucosia, as I find it on my 



chart, though I find it elsewhere put down as Nicosia; and even the cape we have in sight is 

Pifanio in a standard atlas. The population is 186,000, of whom not quite 50,000 are 

Mohammedans, and the rest are orthodox Greeks. The great majority of the people speak the 

Greek language, but it is so much corrupted that Flix would not understand it."  "You are right, my 

darling; I want the pure Greek of Kilkenny, or I don't take it in," replied the Milesian.  "The island 

was colonized by the Phoenicians, who have a history too long to be related now; but they 

occupied the northern part of Syria and the country to the north of us. They were the New Yorkers 

of their day and generation, and were largely engaged in commerce. They brought 


_
Antelopes, back o' Carnadine--if anybody should ask you who give you your pointer on Simon 

Peter Judas. I don't blacklist no man in the dark, and I've said a heap more to that old ratter's face 

than I've ever said behind his back. Ump! him a-wrigglin' in that chair you're settin' in and tryin' to 

fix up some way to skin you! Don't tell me! I know blame' well what he was tryin' to do."  Blount 

listened and was interested, not so much in the bit of gossip as in the big, red-faced ranchman, 

who so evidently had a grudge to worship of Venus over here, and called the island Kupros after 

her. It had at first nine independent kingdoms, and I should suppose that almost anybody could 

afford to be a king in this locality. It was conquered by the Egyptians about five hundred years 

before the time of Christ; then by the Persians; and finally came into the possession of the 

Romans.  "It went with the Eastern Empire when Rome was divided. The people embraced 

Christianity at an early date. It was said that a shepherd discovered the body of St. Matthew
