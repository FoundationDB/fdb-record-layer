philodendron monstera seen at Geera; this was surrounded by basalt, and the=
 presence of limestone entirely mystifles my ideas of geology. Immense quan=
tities of very beautiful spar lay upon the surface in all directions; some =
of this was perfectly white, and veined like an agate--I believe it was whi=
te cornelian; other fragments, of sizes equalling sixty or seventy pounds w=
eight, were beautifully green, suggesting the presence of copper. Large mas=
ses of exquisite bloodstone, the size of a "perhaps." And so it was with Gy=
uri.  "What is the umbrella like, Miss Veronica?" he asked.  Veronica close=
d her lips firmly, as though she considered it unnecessary to answer him, t=
hen thought better of it, and said:  "It is not much to look at; it is of f=
aded red stuff, looks a thousand years old, and is patched all over."  "Wit=

cleaning, my good angel whispered a providential warning, and I agreed to f=
ire this particular rifle=20

by a long fishing-line attached to the trigger, while the gun should be fas=
tened to a tree. It blew all=20

to pieces! The locks were blown entirely away, and the stock was shattered =
into fragments:=20

nothing remained but the thick end near the shoulder-plate. I had received =
a mysterious=20

presentiment of this; had I fired that rifle in perfume through the room, d=
ecidedly more pleasant=20

than the fumes of tobacco smoke which had filled it a minute before.  Madam=
e Krisbay, startled by=20

the sudden darkness, gave vent to a little scream, and Klempa seized the op=
portunity to exclaim:=20

"I assure you it was not I!"  There was a general confusion in the darkness=
, but Mrs. Szliminszky,=20

wanting to prove she was above being troubled by such trifles, quietly cont=
inued her conversation=20

with Gyuri.  "It is a pretty little legend, Mr. Wibra. I am not easily impo=
sed upon,=20


_
killed on the spot. The charge was five drachms, which was small in proport=
ion to the weight of the=20

cylindrical projectile. This may be a warning to such sportsmen who adopt n=
ew-fashioned=20

projectiles to old-fashioned rifles, that were proved with the spherical bu=
llet, which in weight and=20

friction bears no proportion to the heavy cylinder; nevertheless, this rifl=
e should not have burst,=20

and the metal showed great inferiority, by blowing into fragments instead o=
f splitting.  The leader of=20

Mek Nimmur's party returned, as he had promised, to be our guide. I extract=
 from my journal,=20

verbatim, my notes upon that date.  "March 19, 1862.--Started at 1.30 P.M.,=
 and halted at 5 P.M.=20

There is no water for about thirty miles; thus we had watered all the anima=
ls at the usual hour=20

(noon), and they will accordingly endure until to-morrow evening. Upon asce=
nding the slope of the=20

Settite valley, the country is an immense plain of fertile soil, about two =
hundred feet above the=20

river. While on the march, I espied a camel wandering without an owner; thi=
s was inmmediately=20

secured as a lawful prize by our guide. This fellow's name is Mahomet; he i=
s, doubtlessly, an out-

and-out scoundrel; he is about five feet ten inches in height, and as thin =
as a live man can be; he=20

is so crafty-looking, and so wiry and eel-like, that if I were to lock him =
up I should secure the key-

hole, as he looks capable of squeezing through anything. We slept on the pl=
ain.  "March 20.--

Started at 5 A.M., and in three hours we reached the chain of lofty wooded =
hills that bound the=20

plain. In a march of four hours from this point, we arrived at a hor, or ra=
vine, when we halted=20

beneath a large tamarind tree, and pitched the tent according to the instru=
ctions of our guide. The=20

plain from the Settite to the base of the hilly range that we had crossed, =
is legend. But the=20

umbrella is really wonderful. Sick people are cured if they stand under it;=
 a dead man rose to life=20

again when it touched him. It is of no use your shaking your head, for it i=
s true. I know the man=20

himself, he is still alive. Altogether the things that umbrella has done ar=
e wonderful, especially the=20

fact that it has brought luck and riches to the priest of Glogova."  A dark=
 suspicion took possession=20

of Gyuri, and when the candles were relighted, it was to be seen he was as =
pale as death.  "Is the=20

priest rich?" he asked.  "Very rich," answered Mrs. Szliminszky.  He drew n=
earer to her, and=20

suddenly seized hold of her hand, pressing it convulsively. The good lady c=
ould not make out why.=20

(If he had done so a minute sooner, she could have understood it, but the c=
andles were alight=20

now!)  "He found something in the umbrella, did he not?" he asked, panting.=
  Mrs. Szliminszky=20

shrugged her white shoulders, half visible through the lace insertion of he=
r dress.  "Why, what=20

could he find in an umbrella? It is not a box, nor an iron case. But for th=
e last fourteen years=20

people have come from great distances to be married under the umbrella, and=
 they pay=20

generously for it. And then when a rich person is dying anywhere beyond the=
 Bjela Voda, from the=20

Szitnya right as far as Krivan, they send for the priest of Glogova to hear=
 their confession, and=20

after their death, to bury them under the umbrella."  Veronica, to whom the=
 mayor's wife had been=20

showing the embroidered table-cloth, calling her attention to the fineness =
of the linen, now caught=20

a few words of the conversation.  "Are you speaking of our umbrella?" she a=
sked amiably, leaning=20

toward them.  Gyuri and Mrs. Szliminszky started.  "Yes, my dear," answered=
 the latter, slightly=20

confused.  Gyuri smiled mischievously.  "I see," said Veronica, "you=20


_
table-land in this country, it is well adapted for cotton cultivation. Were=
 the route secure through=20

the Base country, loaded camels might reach Cassala in six days and from th=
ence to Souakim. All=20

this country is uninhabited. On arrival at the base of the first bill, a gr=
ove of tamarinds shades a=20

spring, at which we watered our horses, but the water is impregnated with n=
atron, which is=20

common throughout this country, and appears in many places as an effloresce=
nce on the surface=20

of the ground. From the spring at the eastern base of the hills, we ascende=
d a rugged pass,=20

winding for some miles among ravines, and crossing elevated shoulders of th=
e range. Upon the=20

summit we passed a rich mass of  "No, I do not."  "Really?" asked the girl =
reproachfully; "and=20

why?"  "Because I never believe nonsense, and because ..."  He had nearly s=
aid too much, but he=20

kept back the words that rose to his lips when he saw how wounded the girl =
appeared at his=20

incredulity. She smiled, turned her head away, and gazed silently at her pl=
ate. Gyuri was silent=20

too, though he felt inclined to cry out:  "I am rich at last, for in the ha=
ndle of that umbrella there are=20

unknown treasures."  It is remarkable that if good luck befalls a man, his =
first wish (for he still has=20

wishes, even if they are all fulfilled) is to communicate it to others; he =
would like trumpets=20

sounded, heralds to be sent round to announce it=20
