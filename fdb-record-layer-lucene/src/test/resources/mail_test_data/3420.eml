In order to find the dimensions of the crescent in the single roller we must proceed as follows: WA is in the center of the fork when it rests against the bank, and is, therefore, one of the sides of the fork angle, goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.

of the same form, and a good fit. Fig. 23 illustrates the difference in size of rollers. In the smaller 

one the conditions imposed are satisfied, while in the larger one they are not. In the single roller 

the safety action is at the mercy of the impulse and pallet angles. We have noticed that in order to 

favor the impulse we require a large roller, and for the safety action a small one, therefore 

escapements made on fine principles are supplied with two rollers, one for each action.  It may be 

well to say that in our opinion a proportion between the fork and impulse angles in 10deg. pallets 

of 3 or 3 1/2 to 1, _depending_ upon the size of the escapement, is the lowest which OTHER

single roller. We have seen them in proportions of 2 to 1 in single roller--a scientific principle 

foolishly applied--resulting in an action entirely unsatisfactory.  When the guard point is pressed 

against the roller the escape tooth must still rest on the locking face of the pallet; if the total lock is 

2deg., by allowing 1 1/4deg. freedom for the guard point between the bank and the roller the 

escapement will still be locked 3/4deg. How much this shake actually amounts to depends upon 

the guard radius. Suppose this to be 4 mm., then the freedom would equal 4 x 2 x 3.1416 / 360 x 

1.25 = .0873 mm.  [Illustration: Fig. 24.]  [Illustration: Fig. 25.]  _The Crescent_ in the roller must
