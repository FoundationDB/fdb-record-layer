than the arrival of this aged Bishop with his four humble companions.  He f=
inally entered the city of=20

Mexico at ten o'clock one morning, and not only was there no disturbance of=
 the peace when he=20

was recognised, but his followers even heard some comments of admiration fo=
r him as he passed=20

through the streets to the Dominican monastery where he was to lodge.  The =
very day of his=20

arrival, Las Casas betrayed his lack of those conciliatory qualities, witho=
ut which no man can=20

negotiate debatable questions with any hope of success.  During his several=
 visits to Spain, where=20

he handled delicate questions with consummate skill, he had shown tact in s=
eeking to disarm=20

opposition and conciliate opponents, but in Mexico he displayed no wordly w=
isdom whatsoever.=20

He replied to the message of the Viceroy and the auditors who sent to welco=
me him, that he would=20

not visit them as they were excommunicated because they had cut off the han=
d of a priest in=20

Antequera.  The news of this message was spread throughout the city and sti=
ll further inflamed the=20

popular ire against him.  Just at a time when so much depended upon winning=
 supporters to his=20

side and conciliating, as far as possible, the conflicting principles of th=
e contending parties, Las=20

Casas alienated the powerful Viceroy and the auditors, and rendered himself=
 inaccessible to any=20

possible overtures from the more reasonable and moderate men of the opposit=
ion, whom it should=20

have been his first duty to placate by every possible concession.  The syno=
d or council was=20

composed of the five bishops of Mexico, Chiapa, Guatemala, Oaxaca, and Mech=
oacan, with=20

possibly a sixth from Tiazcala; besides these, there were the prelates and =
chief theologians of the=20

religious orders, and finally, all the learned men of the colony.  The outc=
ome of their deliberations=20

was contained in eight propositions, of which the five principal ones were =
as follows:   1.1. All=20

infidels, of whatsoever sect or religion they may be or whatever       may =
be their sins, hold and=20

possess in conformity with the natural       and divine law and the law of =
nations, the property they=20

acquire       without prejudice to others; and likewise their principalitie=
s,       kingdoms, estates,=20

lordships, dignities, and jurisdictions.  2.2. Although four different clas=
ses of infidels exist, there is=20

but one       method instituted by divine providence for teaching the true =
      religion, namely,=20

persuading the understanding by reasoning and       attracting the will by =
gentleness. This is=20

common to all men in the       world, without regard to difference of error=
s or sects, or=20

corruption of morals.  3.3. The sole and final cause why the Apostolic See =
granted supreme=20

sovereignty and imperial jurisdiction over the Indies to the Kings       of=
 Castile and Leon was the=20

preaching of the Gospel, the spread of       the Christian religion, and th=
e conversion of the nations=20

of those       regions, and not to increase their dignity or to make them r=
icher       princes than they=20

were.  4.4. The Holy See, in granting the said supreme sovereignty, did not=
       intend to deprive=20

the native sovereigns and rulers of their estates,       lordships, jurisdi=
ction, honours, and dignities,=20

nor did it intend       to give the Kings of Castile and Leon any license b=
y which the       spread of=20

the Gospel should be impeded and the conversion of the       people of thos=
e regions be retarded.=20

5.5. The said sovereigns of Castile, who offered and bound themselves of   =
    their own choice to=20

see that the faith was preached and the Indians       converted, are oblige=
d by divine precept to=20

bear the necessary       expenses for accomplishing these ends.  These were=
 the most important=20

of the eight articles approved by the synod, and they were grounded upon an=
d defended by a=20

multitude of arguments drawn from the Fathers and General Councils: they we=
re not adopted=20

without opposition, and every point was fought over in endless debates, for=
 the conquerors and all=20

holders of encomiendas contested stoutly for what they held to be their rig=
hts.  The synod also=20



established the conditions on which sacraments should be administered to th=
e colonists, and=20

addressed a full report of the proceedings to the Emperor, soliciting his c=
onfirmation and the royal=20

authority for executing all that the exhibit at the Liverpool Tercentenary =

Esq., of Exeter, I am obliged for information relating to local clocks comi=

horizon in regard to local makers. H. Wingent, Esq., of Rochester, an enthu=
siastic collector and=20

connoisseur of old clocks, has kindly enabled me to reproduce one of his ex=
amples. To Herbert=20

Bolton, Esq., of the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, I am indebted for the =
inclusion of a fine=20

specimen in that collection.  I desire especially to record the generous ai=
d I have had from Percy=20

Webster, Esq., of Great Portland Street, London, who is well known as a con=
noisseur of old=20

clocks, and from his son, Malcolm R. Webster, Esq., who have given me pract=
ical assistance in=20

regard to verifying facts from actual examples.  To Thomas Rennie, Esq., of=
 the Glasgow Art=20

Galleries and Museums, I desire to record thanks. To Edward Campbell, Esq.,=
 of Glasgow, who=20

has enriched my volume with examples of Scottish work in his collection, I =
am indebted for=20

information regarding Scottish makers embodied in this volume.  I am, by th=
e kindness of John=20

Smith, Esq., of Edinburgh, author of _Old Scottish Clockmakers_, and of his=
 publisher, William J.=20

Hay, Esq., John Knox's House, Edinburgh, enabled to produce names and dates=
 of certain=20

Scottish makers not recorded elsewhere. In this connection my friend Willia=
m R. Miller, Esq., of=20

Leith, has spared no time to help me to do justice to Scottish makers, and =
I am especially grateful=20

to him for his kindly enthusiasm. He was there at the "chap o' the knok" wh=
en I asked his help.=20

Westropp Dudley, Esq., of the National Museum, Dublin, has extended to me h=
is courtesy in=20

enabling the inclusion of Irish makers coming under his research. To Arthur=
 Deane, Esq., of the=20

Public Art Gallery and Museum, Belfast, I am similarly obliged for data rel=
ative to old Belfast=20

clockmakers.  To the many friends who have during an extended period genero=
usly supplemented=20

my own studies by supplying me with data in regard to provincial makers and=
 other hitherto=20

unelucidated matters, I wish to offer my cordial thanks.  To my readers in =
general, whether they be=20

collectors of old English china or earthenware, of furniture, or of prints,=
 or of old silver, I desire to=20

record my appreciation of their kindness in regard to my volumes on these s=
ubjects. I have=20

honestly endeavoured to treat each sub-head concerning the evolution of des=
ign in the English=20

home with sane reasoning, and I trust with ripe judgment. I have assiduousl=
y collected facts and=20

studiously attempted to marshal them, each by each, according to relative v=
alue. Popular my=20

volumes may be, but it is my hope that they may contribute something of per=
manent value to the=20

subjects with which they deal.      ARTHUR HAYDEN.     CONTENTS=20

_
Although Las Casas had several times essayed to bring the question of slave=
ry before the council,=20

no direct or explicit decision was given on that important point, and as hi=
s efforts were=20

embarrassing, the Viceroy quickly told him that reasons of State had compel=
led him to defer a=20

definite solution of that question.  Far from quieting Las Casas, this info=
rmation aroused his zeal=20

all the more, and as a hearing in the council was denied him, he preached a=
 few days later when=20

the Viceroy was present, taking for his text this significant passage from =
the thirtieth chapter of the=20

prophet Isaias: "For this is a rebellious people; lying children, children =
that will not hear the law of=20

God.  Who say to the seers, see not; and to the prophets, prophesy not righ=
t things unto us; speak=20

unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits."  The sermon was not without the i=
ntended effect, and=20

the Viceroy began to regret the exclusion of the subject of slavery from th=
e council: as a=20

compromise, he consented that separate meetings should be held in the conve=
nt of San Domingo=20

to consider this subject, offering to transmit to the Emperor the conclusio=
ns adopted.  Las Casas=20

was ably seconded in the proceedings of these meetings, by Fray Luis Cancer=
, and a declaration=20

was drawn up declaring that the Indians--with few exceptions--had been unju=
stly enslaved and=20

that those who held them were bound to set them free: slave-holders were de=
scribed as tyrants=20

and all personal services exacted from the defenceless natives were condemn=
ed.  Those who=20

took part in these meetings and signed the decisions, were destitute of any=
 means to give effect to=20

them, but they adopted measures to publish and distribute copies of them th=
roughout the colonies,=20

in the hope that they might influence public opinion in the right direction=
.  Las Casas named the=20

Canon, Juan Perera, as his Vicar-General in the diocese of Chiapa, on the n=
inth of November,=20

1546, and at the same time appointed as confessors the friars Tomas Casilla=
s, Tomas de la Torre,=20

Domingo de Arana, and Alonso de Villabra, to whom he furnished copies of th=
e instructions=20

approved by the council of Mexico, in which were comprised the twelve rules=
.  The colonists=20

appealed to the Emperor against the instructions, which they held to be und=
uly severe and=20

onerous for them, and, in reply to their petition, a royal order dated in V=
alladolid on the twenty-

eighth of November, 1542, was received by the Audiencia of Mexico ordering =
a copy of the=20

disputed regulations to be sent to Spain for examination.  In the early par=
t of the year 1547, Las=20

Casas arrived in Vera Cruz to embark for Spain, and after some delay there,=
 until a ship could be=20

found for the voyage, left the shores of America for the last time(65)     =

continue the struggle in the cause of freedom.  Upon his arrival in Spain, =
he repaired at once to=20

Valladolid where the court was usually in residence, only to find that Don =
Philip had gone to hold a=20

Cortes in the kingdom of Aragon.  With his habitual promptness, the Bishop =
followed him thither,=20

and was received with great kindness by the Prince, who, after listening at=
tentively to all that he=20

had to recount, wrote to the Dominicans in Chiapa commending their conduct =
and offering to send=20

more men of their Order to reinforce them, if they were required.  The Indi=
ans were ever=20

uppermost in the mind of Las Casas and he likewise obtained that the Prince=
 should write letters=20

to the caciques in Chiapa and Tuzulutlan, who had become Christians, congra=
tulating them on=20

their conversion, praising their zeal, of which the Bishop had informed him=
, and urging them to=20

follow the counsels of their Dominican friends.  To celebrate his pacific v=
ictory in the "Land of=20

War," Las Casas also had the sinister name Tuzulutlan officially changed to=
 that of Vera Paz or=20

True Peace.  The formal resignation of Las Casas from the diocese of Chiapa=
 was made known to=20

the Spanish Ambassador in Rome, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, in a letter f=
