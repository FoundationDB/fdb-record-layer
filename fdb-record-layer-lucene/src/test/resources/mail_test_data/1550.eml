HOLD IN SILENCE AND TO MEDITATE UPON DURING THE DAY  FOR JUSTICE  "There's =
a=20

Spirit of Justice that Secures me in Which is My Own."  If we reach a consc=
iousness of justice, we=20

need have no doubts as to our care in every particular while journeying bet=
ween the two peaks of=20

eternity--from birth to the Great Divide.  There is nothing that can defeat=
 old-fashioned folk used to=20

say, with his kind.  The aforesaid =E2=80=9Ccall=E2=80=9D makes no mention =
of his family. If you like to call on them=20

when they come to the parish, and if you find them congenial=E2=80=94your c=
ongeners, in fact=E2=80=94keep up=20

the association as you would with your doctor=E2=80=99s, or your lawyer=E2=
=80=99s family. That you belong to Doctor=20

Barnabas=E2=80=99 parish, that you are the wife or daughter of an officer i=
n his church, gives you absolutely=20

no claim on his wife or daughters beyond what you, individually, possess. T=
o demand that Mrs.=20

Barnabas, refined in every instinct, highly educated and with tastes for wh=
at is best and highest in=20

social companionship, should be bullied and patronized by Mrs. Million, a p=
urse-proud vulgarian,=20

unlearned and stupid, is sheer barbarity. Yet we see it=E2=80=94and worse=
=E2=80=94in many American churches.=20

[Sidenote: A FALSE ASSUMPTION]  Do you, sensible and amenable reader, lead =
the way to=20

better things; loosen at least one buckle of the harness that bows many a f=
ine spirit to breaking,=20

and makes the church a smoke in the nostrils of unprejudiced outsiders. Sep=
arate ecclesiastical=20

from social relations.=20


_
consciousness of justice will attract to himself every conceivable thing ne=
eded for this life, because=20

it will be the logical objective of justice to supply to each individual th=
at justice for which he thinks.=20

That is the reason why this affirmation is so complete in itself; namely, "=
There is a spirit of=20

JUSTICE that secures me in which is my own, and this security is provided a=
lready for us by the=20

Spirit of Justice."  It would be a psychological paradox to think that Just=
ice could be defeated. That=20

could not be. Perhaps it appears to you that your own has not yet been secu=
red to you, but,=20

remember that life is fleeting--that a year is as a tale that is told--and =
that a decade is but as=20

"Ships that pass in the night"--when the years have vanished in the distanc=
e.  If you have lived a=20

life of justice, and it appears now that your own is not coming to you, tha=
t someone else is having=20

more of the good things of life than you, and that someone seems to have us=
ed the art of the man=20

of injustice, be not deceived, God is not mocked, for "whatsoever a man sow=
eth that shall he also=20

reap." If you have sowed equity and justice in the days that are gone, be s=
ure that the same equity=20

and justice will be secured to you.  The Scriptures tell us not to think to=
o much of the man who is=20

nourishing like a green bay tree, for his efforts are soon cut off and he v=
anisheth away.  One who=20

is astride the scales of justice, and who thinks that he can hold the balan=
ce, is gravely mistaken.=20

He may have occupied his present position for many years, first putting his=
 weight on one side and=20

then on the other in an effort to keep his equilibrium. Perhaps today it ap=
pears that the scales of=20

justice are being well manipulated by his insincerity, duplicity or tricker=
y--but it is like the green bay=20

tree. It will soon pass away.  Justice is as eternal as God Himself, and th=
ere is no more possibility=20

of defeating it in the individual's life, in your own life, in the life of =
a nation or in the history of=20

mankind, than there is likelihood that the sun can get away from its own ra=
ys. The justice of God is=20

eternal, or, in other words, God always is Justice, personified. Where God =
rules, and where His=20

laws and mandates have been given by His own fiat, "man, neither flesh nor =
the devil" can defeat=20

the ultimate outcome of justice. Your own is secured to you.  Man himself i=
s fashioned by the=20

finger of Divinity. The crown of justice is placed upon his brow and no rut=
hless hand of greed,=20

duplicity or evil dexterity can ever tear it away. It is there to stay, and=
 the man who has been thus=20

crowned because he has lived in this consciousness of justice--in the consc=
iousness of God=20

Himself--is bound to have come back to him that which he has thought, that =
which he has sowed--

Justice. You are secured by this spirit of justice.  Perhaps already your l=
ife has had the law of=20

compensation bring to you more than to others of whom you may think, and wh=
o, because of their=20

bank account, get more out of life than you. A man may have a million dolla=
rs, and yet not be as=20

happy as the laborer living in a thatched cottage. _Perhaps Justice has tip=
ped the scales in your=20

favor already--and you have failed to recognize it. Perhaps you have childr=
en, loved ones, family=20

and fireside which bring more comfort to you than the land owner gets who l=
ives in his palace on=20

the hill_.  Half of Life, or the joys of Life, depend upon our ability to r=
ecognize and appreciate the=20

blessings we already have. Therefore, in counting your blessings, or discou=
nting your blessings,=20

be sure that you use a moral standard, instead of a material standard, in g=
auging whether justice=20

has been meted out to you or not.  The Justice of the Eternal secures me, t=
he Spirit of Justice=20

secures me in which is mine own. Believe it, think it, live it, claim it an=
d Justice shall be yours.=20

*       *       *       *       *    Question--In practicing the Silence, t=
he mind seems to flutter all about=20

and there is great nervous tension. What is wrong?  Answer--Lack of concent=
ration. This person=20

ought to follow some simple exercise of concentration, such as given below,=
 until the mind has=20



control over the body. By practicing a few of the simple exercises given be=
low, fifteen minutes a=20

day, and then taking the Silence a few hours after these exercises have bee=
n practiced, the mind=20

will begin to be under control.  The nervous tension is caused because of t=
his lack of control, and=20

in the effort to bring the scattering mind into one focus the reaction come=
s upon the nervous=20

system which, in turn, reacts upon the body.  Practice and exercises for la=
ck of concentration=20

follow.     EXERCISES  By Thos. Parker Boyd        (1) Select some part of =
the body, a foot or=20

hand, with the      idea of HEAT. While holding the mind in this attitude, =
     breathe deeply and=20

steadily, and, in from one to four      minutes, you will feel the warm glo=
w coming to the foot. In=20

this way, you can soon master the entire body. Begin with the      sense of=
 feeling. If there is an=20

itching of the body, make it      stop by the force of your will. In from t=
hree days to three      weeks,=20

you can stop the itching sensation at will. Then try      the habit of snee=
zing; stubbornly resist the=20

inclination to      sneeze, and you will soon have the mastery. Now try you=
r will      on coughing.=20

When the tickling sensation comes, stop it by      the exercise of your wil=
l. You can soon master it.=20

Next try      it on pain. When you feel a pain in the body, instead of     =
 rubbing on liniment, rub in a=20

little will power; soon it will      ease your pain as if by magic. With th=
e fingers of one hand      rub=20

the skin on the back of the other hand, stroking toward      the elbow, and=
 will that all feeling shall=20

disappear. In from      one to three minutes, take a needle, and you can st=
ick it      through the skin=20

on the back of the hand without pain. You      may have to try it a dozen t=
imes, but persistence will=20

bring      Owe your right to call a fellow parishioner =E2=80=9Cfriend,=E2=
=80=9D and to visit at manse or parsonage, or=20

rectory, to what you _are_=E2=80=94not to the adventitious circumstance of =
being a member in good=20

standing in a fashionable, or an unfashionable, church. Exact no considerat=
ion from those who=20

belong with you to the household of faith on the ground of that spiritual =
=E2=80=9Cfellowship.=E2=80=9D The position is=20

false; the claim ignoble.         *       *       *       *       *  No mat=
ter what church one is in, one should=20

always try to conform as far as possible to its order of worship. Not to do=
 this shows a want of=20

proper reverence.     CHAPTER XXXIV  THE WOMAN=E2=80=99S CLUB   [Sidenote: =
THE TOLERANT=20

ATTITUDE]  THE popularity of women=E2=80=99s societies for literary study, =
for economic discussion, for=20

the consideration of municipal and social improvement, is enormous. They ar=
e to be found all over=20

the country, but particularly do they flourish in the Middle West, where ev=
ery town and hamlet in=20

the region boasts a woman=E2=80=99s club of some sort. Both ridicule and pr=
aise are showered upon these=20

organizations; and they deserve both. Some of their manifestations are crud=
e, absurd and=20

tiresome; others are fine in themselves, exert a broadening influence over =
those intimately=20

concerned, and are helpful indirectly to the whole community represented by=
 them. However much=20

particular societies may lay themselves open to adverse criticism by reason=
 of priggishness,=20

superficiality or a mistaken sense of their importance in the scheme of thi=
ngs, it must be=20

acknowledged that the general tendency of these organizations is good. They=
 lift women out of the=20

consideration of the commonplace, domestic side of existence; they encourag=
e toleration and a=20

give-and-take attitude toward life, in which attitude women are often lacki=
ng; they open a way for=20

the development of latent talent of various kinds; they are often stepping =
stones to improvement in=20

the social life of a community. It would be hard to estimate how much they =
have done in creating=20

an atmosphere for the truly artistic and literary element in various commun=
ities throughout the=20

United States. No doubt they have in this way encouraged the production of =
literature and other=20

forms of art; while, in humbler fashion, they have brought pleasure and an =
outlook into many=20



narrow circumscribed lives.  An English woman, visiting in a western city o=
f our country, was=20

asked what one of our institutions she admired the most. =E2=80=9CThe Woman=
=E2=80=99s Club,=E2=80=9D she replied without=20

hesitation, and added that she would like to transplant it to her native la=
nd where, it was true, there=20

were associations of women banded together for various purposes, but none i=
n which women met=20

in such easy and happy intellectual relations as in the women=E2=80=99s clu=
bs of America. Such praise=20

from an unprejudiced observer of our country consoles the woman who believe=
s in the mission of=20

the woman=E2=80=99s club despite many an ugly newspaper fling. The English =
woman in question was=20

fortunate in attending a club of particular interest and value where, to a =
degree, the ideal of what a=20

woman=E2=80=99s club should be was realized. Such a club indicates the poss=
ibilities of the institution,=20

however; and many organizations of women are working with crude material th=
rough absurd=20

phases toward accomplishment as happy.  In small communities where the oppo=
rtunities are=20

infrequent for theater, for social diversion of various kinds, the woman=E2=
=80=99s club is of the greatest=20

help. It serves at once to focus and distribute all the better social and i=
ntellectual interests of the=20

neighborhood. It may be a means of lifting a whole community to a livelier =
and more interesting=20

social and intellectual level.  [Sidenote: HELPING IN LEGISLATION]  Many wo=
men=E2=80=99s clubs=20

become important factors in municipal legislation along the lines most amen=
able to feminine=20

influence. Through such clubs women have helped to solve educational questi=
ons, have=20

influenced public sentiment in the direction of cleaning and beautifying th=
e streets, and in many=20

other ways have helped to promote law and order. The literary club is, howe=
ver, the form most=20

often taken by feminine organizations.  The formation of a literary club is=
 not a difficult matter,=20

though the amount of red tape with which it is sometimes covered up makes t=
he project seem=20

formidable. The woman most interested in the organization of such a club sh=
ould call a meeting at=20

her house of those she thinks most likely to enter into the scheme with ene=
rgy and profit. A=20

perusal of Robert=E2=80=99s _Rules of Order_ or of any other good manual of=
 parliamentary law, will show=20

how such a meeting should be conducted, how officers should be elected and =
a constitution=20

adopted. It may be said in this connection that there are few matters harde=
r for a woman to digest=20

gracefully than a knowledge of parliamentary usages. Such knowledge is for =
use only, not for=20

display. To make a show of it is like using a kitchen utensil for a drawing=
-room ornament. Many=20

women seem to regard the rules governing societies as important in themselv=
es. They are only=20

important as the knowledge and use of them quickens the business proceeding=
s leading up to the=20

real purpose of the organization. Business in a woman=E2=80=99s club, found=
ed for study and improvement,=20

is only a means to an end. It is disastrous to consider it otherwise.  [Sid=
enote: MAKING OUT THE=20

PROGRAM]  The membership having been decided upon, the officers selected an=
d constitution=20

adopted, the next and most important thing in a literary club is to make ou=
t the program. For this=20

purpose an executive committee of three or more is appointed by the preside=
nt or elected by the=20

club. Sometimes this committee makes out the entire program, merely notifyi=
ng each member of=20

the part she is expected to take in its performance. Sometimes the members =
are consulted as to=20

what subjects they prefer. The more arbitrary method is often necessary in =
order to procure unity=20

of design in the program. If, for instance, the program for the day include=
s two papers=20


_
of hearing.       (2) It may seem impossible at first thought, but you have=
      seen people so=20

absorbed in what they were reading or thinking      that they heard nothing=
, although you=20

addressed them      directly. They are simply abstracted from all else, and=
 are      thinking of one=20

thing--to the exclusion of everything else.      They entered this state of=
 abstractedness=20

unconsciously. To      do so the subjects considered should be related, so =
as to make some sort of=20

harmony. If each member is allowed to choose her subject, regardless of any=
thing but her own=20

desire, small pleasure or profit follows. In some clubs the executive commi=
ttee sends out cards to=20

the members, asking for suggestions, accepts the best of these, and, when p=
ossible, assigns the=20

topics preferred.  [Sidenote: ASSIGNING THE TOPICS]  If the first=20


_
instance, take sight; concentrate your vision and your whole      attention=
 upon some object, real or=20

imaginary, until soon the      sense of HEARING becomes dormant. A little p=
ractice will      enable=20

you to study, think or sleep, regardless of noise.       (3) Having mastere=
d hearing, begin on=20

SIGHT. You have known      people who walked on the street, looked at you a=
nd passed by=20

without recognition, although they knew you well. A person      deeply thin=
king on some subject,=20

neither sees nor hears, but      uses the mental sense entirely. The method=
 is to let the eyes      be=20

open, but concentrate the thoughts on hearing or feeling.       (4) After g=
etting control of your sight,=20

take up the TASTE.      Take some tasteless thing on the tongue, abstract t=
he mind to=20

something else until the taste becomes dormant. Then take      something wi=
th committee should=20

be careful to select subjects according to the persons for whom they are de=
signed. Mrs. Brown,=20

who loves poetry, but knows nothing of science, should not be asked to hand=
le the wonders of=20

electricity in the twentieth century; and Mrs. White, who has a delicious t=
ouch in narrating personal=20

experiences, but knows little of continental fiction, would better be asked=
 to write a paper on her=20

summer vacation than one on the great Russian novelists, Turgenieff and Tol=
stoi. Of course, the=20

practise for Mrs. Brown and Mrs. White, in considering subjects opposed to =
their knowledge and=20

taste, might be salutary for them, but it might also send the other members=
 of the club to sleep.=20

And the ambition of the executive committee should be to avoid as much duln=
ess as possible in=20

the atmosphere it partly creates.  Whether the program shall be miscellaneo=
us=20


_
by this gradual process you can make the sourest pickle      sweet.       (=
5) Finally take some light=20

odor, and hold it before the      nostrils, abstracting the attention from =
the sense of smell,      by=20

hearing or seeing, etc., until by practice you can pass      through the fo=
ulest odor without=20

inconvenience or notice.  Sit or stand absolutely motionless, except your b=
reathing, for one to five=20

minutes at a time. Do this often.  Practice closing each finger in rotation=
; then, when all are closed,=20

open one at a time very slowly, keeping the attention fixed on what you are=
 doing. Keep all the=20

other fingers still, save the one you are exercising with.  Inhale graduall=
y for ten seconds, then=20

exhale in the same way and be devoted to progressive study in one direction=
, is a question to be=20

considered by the committee. If the club is small, compact in spirit, and o=
n improvement bent, the=20

study of some one period, author or movement is often most advantageous. If=
 the club is large,=20

and entertainment is largely the motive for meeting, a program that varies =
to meet the various=20

demands of the membership is better.  [Sidenote: THE CLUB SESSION]  Usually=
, the number of=20

papers on a given day should not exceed two. Sometimes, owing to the light =
or easily divisible=20

nature of the theme for the day, three papers, of fifteen or twenty minutes=
 each, may be assigned.=20

For the discussion that should follow the paper, or papers, it is the custo=
m generally=20
