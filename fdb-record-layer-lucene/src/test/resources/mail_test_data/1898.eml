dracaena marginata  "How did you know that I had the name and address of the firm which has been paying Father the interest on the Phillips loan?"  "Why, you told me."  "In my sleep?"  "Indeed, no.

light and pleasant."  Jasmine's eyes began to sparkle.  "Oh! at another time it would be delightful," 

she said.  "But don't you want a guinea very badly now? Don't you think you had better put on your 

hat and come away with me, and try to earn it?"  "I will," said Jasmine, with sudden enthusiasm. 

"Oh, Mr. Noel, how good you are! How I wish I had a brother, and that you were he!"  Noel took 

Jasmine to his friend's house, where the little girl began by being almost frightened, but soon 

forgot herself in the strong interest of her pleasant work. Noel was right when he said Jasmine had 

true artistic instincts. Certainly, hers was untaught genius, but her unerring taste came to her aid, 

and Mrs. Daintree's dinner-table never looked prettier or fresher than when the little maiden had 

completed her work. The room was bright and sunny, but Jasmine gave the table a bower-like and 

cool effect, and she not only dressed the dinner-table but placed flowers here and there about the 

room. Mrs. Daintree was delighted, and asked the pretty little girl to come again to arrange a 

dinner-table for her the following week.  With her golden sovereign and her shilling tucked tightly 

away in her glove Jasmine did not feel altogether miserable as she went home; even though Daisy 

might still be lost, those first earnings were sweet. She rushed upstairs and told her tale to Poppy, 

who sympathized most warmly with her. Very soon after her arrival a four-wheeler was heard to 

draw up to the door, and Mrs. Dredge alone returned.  "I have left Primrose at Rosebury," she 

said; "we have made inquiries, and there is no doubt a child resembling Daisy went down by the 

night train yesterday. We have searched high and low, however, but cannot at present get any 

trace of her. Don't look so pale, Jasmine, she must soon be found. Primrose is staying with Miss 

Martineau, and they are not leaving a stone unturned to find her. Most likely they have done so by 

now. Don't cry, Jasmine; take example by your sister--she's a fine plucky bit of a lass, and does 

not waste  "How?"  "How'd you suppose I know? Get out of my way and let me get at the 'phone!" 

"You ain't going to do nothing of the kind," replied Jud as he stepped in front of the belligerent 

Hank. "There's some reason for driving like that. I don't know what's up, but the first feller to 

interfere with her joy ride is going to get hurt. I was in the cellar of her dad's place doing an odd job 

of plumbing for him when she come to me, and said: 'Jud, I'm going for a drive.' I 'lowed that was 

real nice, wondering why she'd be telling me that. 'I may have to drive pretty fast, and I want you to 

telephone ahead as far as you can to have the road clear. Tell the policemen my name, and ask 

that they don't stop me.'"  "But her dad----"  "Her dad ain't home. He went over Riverhead way 

more than an hour ago."  "But, Jud----"  "Dry up that butting, Hank, or we'll lead you out in the alley 

behind your store and feed you tin cans."  Hank climbed back to his wagon-seat, and Jud, noticing 

the determined expression in the storekeeper's eyes, deputized two men to keep watch of him 

while he went inside and did some telephoning.  Elizabeth Fox reached the city limits without 

being molested. She then looked at her watch, and slowed down her car. She kept the 

speedometer needle wavering within the speed law till she set her brakes before the building 

where the law firm of Starr and Jordan maintained their offices. Harold was so surprised to see his 

sister that he gave her the name of the Trust Company for which she asked before he realized 

what he was doing. She glanced at the clock, hastily scribbled the address on a card, and ran from 

the room. Harold stood still in dumb amazement. He walked to the window and looked down into 

the street below. He recognized her red motor-car as it glided through the traffic at an alarming 

rate. A mild oath escaped him as it dawned upon him that the name of the bank was that of the 

firm through which the interest payments had been made on the Phillips loan. What on earth could 



she be up to?  It was far past the

there's something to be done."  "Yes, that's just it," said Jasmine; Primrose has got something to 

do, but I haven't--I can do nothing to find my little darling! Oh, Mrs. Dredge, are not you awfully 

frightened about her?"  "Tut, tut, my dear, not a bit of it! Of course, when a little lass runs away all 

by herself there are most times difficulties in getting trace of her, but don't you be in a way, for they 

won't last long."  Poor empty, the force having gone home for the Saturday half-holiday. She 

turned from the locked door, but it flew open, and Harold called to her.  "I thought you'd come 

back, Sis. In fact, I meant to tell you that I wanted you to take dinner with me, but you blew in and 

out so suddenly that I didn't have time to collect my thoughts. What are you up to, anyway?"  "Oh, 

nothing much."  "How did you learn of this Phillips affair? I take

was soothed again, however, by the sight of Noel, who came in very soon afterwards. He said he 

had seen the Ellsworthys, and meant to go down to Rosebury by the night train.  "I'm pleased to 

hear it, young man," said Mrs. Dredge; "you're doing just what my Joshua would have approved of 

had he been alive. Even though Joshua was in the chandlery line he had a truly noble heart, and 

one of his all your hurry was about."  She only laughed in reply, her eyes dancing.  "I didn't know 

that you were on the inside of this, and I don't know yet how much you really know."  "I know a lot." 

"How did you find out?"  "Everybody has told me a little, and I have been piecing it together for 

several days. But can't we sit down, or go out to lunch? I'm really very tired, now that it's over, and
