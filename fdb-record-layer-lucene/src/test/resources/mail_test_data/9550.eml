receiving it, you can which the increase of his wealth never induced him to=
 extend. He seems to=20

have felt a singular diffidence as to his capacity for aristocratic expendi=
ture. The conversation=20

turning one day on the immense fortunes of certain noblemen, he said, "I un=
derstand it is easy=20

and natural enough for those who are born and brought up to it, to spend L5=
0,000 or even=20

L150,000 a year; but I should be very sorry to have to undergo the fatigue =
of even spending=20

L30,000 a year. I believe such a job as that would drive me mad." He felt a=
n equally strange=20

misgiving as to his capacity for aristocratic idleness. "It requires a spec=
ial education," he said, "to=20

be idle, or to employ the twenty-four hours, in a rational way, without any=
 calling or occupation. To=20

live the life of a gentleman, one must have been brought up to it. It is im=
possible for a man who=20

has been engaged in business pursuits the greater part of his life to retir=
e; if he does so, he soon=20

discovers that he has made a great mistake. I shall not retire, but if for =
some good reason, I should=20

be obliged to do so, it would be to a farm. There I would bring up stock wh=
ich I would cause to be=20

weighed every day, ascertaining at the same time their daily cost, as again=
st the increasing=20

weight. I should then know when to sell and start again with another lot." =
 Of tinsel, which=20

sometimes is as corrupting to vulgar souls as money, this man seems to have=
 been as regardless=20

as he was of pelf. He received the Cross of the Iron Crown from the Emperor=
 of Austria. He=20

accepted what was graciously offered, but he said that, as an Englishman, h=
e did not know what=20



good Crosses were to him. The circumstance reminded him that he had receive=
d other Crosses,=20

but he had to ask his agent what they were, and where they were. He was tol=
d that they were the=20

Legion of Honour of France, and the Chevaliership of Italy; but the Crosses=
 could not be found.=20

Duplicates were procured to be taken to Mrs. Brassey, who, her husband rema=
rked, would be glad=20

to possess them all.  Such millionaires would do unmixed good in the world;=
 but unfortunately they=20

are apt to die and leave their millions, and the social influence which the=
 millions confer, to "that=20

unfeathered two-legged thing, a son." This is by no means said with a perso=
nal reference. On the=20

contrary, it is evident that Mr. Brassey was especially fortunate in his he=
ir. We find some indication=20

of this in a chapter towards the close of Mr. Helps' volume, in which are t=
hrown together the son's=20

miscellaneous recollections of the father. The chapter affords further proo=
f that the great=20

contractor was not made of the same clay as the Fisks and Vanderbilts--that=
 he was not a mere=20

market-rigger and money-grubber--but a really great man, devoted to a speci=
al calling. He is=20

represented by his son as having taken a lively interest in a wide and vari=
ed range of subjects--

engineering subjects especially as a matter of course, but not engineering =
subjects alone. He=20

studied countries and their people, evincing the utmost interest in Chicago=
, speculating on the=20

future industrial prosperity of Canada, and imparting the results of his ob=
servations admirably=20

when he got home. Like all great men, he had a poetic element in his charac=
ter. He loved the=20

beauties of nature, and delighted in mountain scenery. He was a great sight=
-seer, and when he=20

visited a city on business, went through its churches, public buildings, an=
d picture-galleries, as=20

assiduously as a tourist. For half an hour he stood gazing with delight on =
the Maison Carree, at=20

Nismes. For sculpture and painting he had a strong taste, and the Venus of =
Milo "was a joy to=20

him." He had a keen eye for beauty, shapeliness and comeliness everywhere, =
in porcelain, in=20

furniture, in dress, in a well built yacht, in a well appointed regiment of=
 horse. Society, too, he=20

liked, in spite of his simplicity of habits; loved to gather his friends ar=
ound his board, and was=20

always a genial host. For literature he had no time, but he enjoyed oratory=
, and liked to hear good=20

reading. He used to test his son's progress in reading, at the close of eac=
h half year, by making=20

him read aloud a chapter of the Bible. His good sense confined his ambition=
 to his proper sphere,=20

and prevented him from giving ear to any solicitations to go into politics,=
 which he had not leisure=20

to study, and which he knew ought not to be handled by ignorance. His own l=
eanings were=20

Conservative; but his son, who is a Liberal, testifies that his father neve=
r offered him advice on=20

political matters, or remonstrated with him on a single vote which he gave =
in the House of=20

Commons. It is little to the discredit of a man so immersed in business tha=
t he should have been=20

fascinated, as he was, by the outward appearance of perfect order presented=
 by the French=20

Empire and by the brilliancy of its visible edifice, not discerning the exp=
losive forces which its=20

policy was all the time accumulating in the dark social realms below; thoug=
h the fact that he, with=20

all his natural sagacity, did fall into this tremendous error, is a warning=
 to railway and steamboat=20

politicians.  Mr. Brassey's advice was often sought by parents who had sons=
 to start in the world.=20

"As usual, a disposition was shewn to prefer a career which did not involve=
 the apparent=20

degradation of learning a trade practically, side by side with operatives i=
n a workshop. But my=20

father, who had known, by his wide experience, the immense value of a techn=
ical knowledge of a=20

trade or business as compared with general educational advantages of the se=
cond order, and who=20

knew how much more easy it is to earn a living as a skilful artisan than as=
 a clerk, possessing a=20



mere general education, always urged those who sought his advice to begin b=
y giving to their sons=20

a practical knowledge of a trade."  "My father," says Mr. Brassey, junior, =
"ever mindful of his own=20

struggles and efforts in early life, evinced at all times the most anxious =
disposition to assist young=20

men to enter upon a career. The small loans which he advanced for this purp=
ose, and the=20

innumerable letters which he wrote in the hope of obtaining for his young c=
lients help or=20

employment in other quarters, constitute a bright and most honourable featu=
re in his life." His=20

powers of letter-writing were enormous, and, it seems to us, were exercised=
 even to excess. So=20

much writing would, at least, in the case of any ordinary=20


_
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you recei=
ved the work on a=20

physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. =
 The person or entity=20

that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacemen=
t copy in lieu of a=20

refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity prov=
iding it to you may choose=20

to too much of the energy which should be devoted to thought. His correspon=
dence was brought=20

with his luncheon basket when he was shooting on the moors. After a long da=
y's journey he sat=20

down in the coffee room of the hotel, and wrote thirty-two letters before h=
e went to bed. He never=20

allowed a letter, even a begging letter, to remain unanswered; and, says hi=
s son, "the same=20

benignity and=20


_

 also defective, you may=20

demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem=
.  1.F.4.  Except for the=20

limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this w=
ork is provided to you 'AS-

NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.=20

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties =
or the exclusion or=20

 forth in this agreement=20

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement s=
hall be interpreted to=20

make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state=
 law.  The invalidity or=20

unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the rema=
ining provisions.  1.F.6.=20

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark o=
wner, any agent or=20

employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm=
 electronic works in=20

conduct in every relation of life, pervaded his whole correspondence." "In =
the many volumes of his=20

letters which are preserved, I venture to affirm that there is not the fain=
test indication of an=20

ungenerous or unkindly sentiment--not a sentence which is not inspired by t=
he spirit of equity and=20

justice, and by universal charity to mankind."  By the same authority we ar=
e assured that "Mr.=20

Brassey was of a singularly patient disposition in dealing with all ordinar=
y affairs of life. We know=20

how, whenever a hitch occurs in a railway journey, a great number of passen=
gers become=20

irritated, almost to a kind of foolish frenzy. He always took these matters=
 most patiently. He well=20

knew that no persons are so anxious to avoid such detentions as the officia=
ls themselves, and=20

never allowed himself to altercate with a helpless guard or distracted stat=
ion-master."  The only=20

blemish which the son can recollect in the father's character, is a want of=
 firmness in blaming=20

when blame was due, and an incapacity of refusing a request or rejecting a =
proposal strongly=20

urged by others. The latter defect was, in his son's judgment, the cause of=
 the=20

motion and distribution=20

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, cost=
s and expenses, including=20

legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following whi=
ch you do or cause to occur:=20

(a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, =
modification, or additions or=20

deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  =

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm=
 is synonymous with=20

the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest=
 variety of computers=20

including disasters which he experienced as a man of business. Both defects=
 were closely allied to=20

virtues--extreme tenderness of heart and consideration for the feelings of =
others.  "He was=20

graceful," says Mr. Brassey, junior, in conclusion, "in every movement, alw=
ays intelligent in=20

observation, with an excellent command of language, and only here and there=
 betrayed, by some=20

slight provincialisms, in how small a degree he had in early life enjoyed t=
