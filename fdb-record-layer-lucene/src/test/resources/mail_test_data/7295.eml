"NOTES AND QUERIES." Twenty years after that event, when about to   embark =
for the Continent=20

with the Countess of Albany, Alfieri, as   he was stepping on board the pac=

first time   since 1771 Lady Ligonier, who was on the quay. They recognised=
   each other, but that=20

was all.    Alfieri, after describing this event in the 21st chapter of his=
   Autobiography, proceeds:--

run-down heels, the latter due to a bad habit of turning the foot over in w=
alking. This can be=20

corrected easily by having the shoe built up at the sole on the opposite si=

element of beauty in an all-round conception of the subject. A feeling for =

be cultivated, and the effort to do this is worth making.  [Sidenote: INDIV=
IDUALITY IN DRESS]=20

Some women who are timid as to their ability to combine colors and tones, p=
lunge into black as a=20

safe refuge or adopt a standard color which they regard as =E2=80=9Csafe=E2=
=80=9D for all occasions. This is a poor=20

way out of the difficulty. Resolute study and a little experimenting will y=
ield better results and an=20

agreeable variety. A woman should study her =E2=80=9Cpoints=E2=80=9D in the=
 light of day before a full-length mirror,=20

and once she has really learned what becomes her she should allow no millin=
er or modiste to coax=20

her into =E2=80=9Cthe latest cry.=E2=80=9D There is no such thing as the =
=E2=80=9Ctyranny of fashion=E2=80=9D for the woman who=20

dresses intelligently. She will never be either in or out of the mode.  Nea=
tness is unquestionably an=20

element of that indefinable thing we call style, though many women who are =
neat are not modish.=20

Neatness is the integrity of dress, the essential foundation to which all g=
ood things may be added.=20



To a woman whose love for dress is allied to the thirst for perfection in t=
hat branch, untidiness is=20

more than distasteful. If =E2=80=9Cextra=E2=80=9D hair must be worn, it sho=
uld be moderate in quantity, of the best=20

quality and most skilfully arranged. Face powder, carelessly put on, makes =

ridiculous. An open placket is viewed by a fastidious woman as something li=
ke disgrace. Broken=20

shoe-laces, gaps between belt and skirt, soiled neckwear, crookedness in th=

gowns and other evidences of careless dressing are abhorrent to her. Neatne=

"CHILDE HAROLD."  There is a famous passage in one of Lord Byron's most fam=
ous poems,=20

which I am ashamed to confess that, though I am English born, and a constan=
t reader of poetry, I=20

cannot clearly understand. It seems to present no difficulties to anybody e=
lse, for it has been=20

quoted a thousand times over and over, without any intimation that it is no=
t as clear as light. It is in=20

the sublime Address to the Ocean at the end of Canto IV. of _Childe Harold_=
, stanza 182.:=20

"Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--       Assyria, Greece, =
Rome, Carthage, what=20

are they?       Thy waters wasted them while they were free,       And many=
 a tyrant since; their=20

shores obey       The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay       Has dri=
ed up realms to deserts:--

not so thou,       Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play--       Time w=
rites no wrinkle on thine=20

azure brow--       Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now."  I ha=
ve copied out to the end=20

of the stanza; for in fact it is not easy to stop the pen when copying such=
 stanzas as these: but my=20

business is with the fourth and fifth lines only. In the fourth line, as yo=
u will observe, a semicolon is=20

inserted after the word "since." I find it there in the first edition of th=
e fourth canto of _Childe=20

Harold_, published in 1818; it is there in the standard edition of Lord Byr=
on's _Works_, issued by=20

Murray about 1832; it is there in the splendid illustrated edition of _Chil=
de Harold_ published by=20

Murray in 1841,--one of the finest books of the kind, if not the finest, th=
at has yet done honour to=20

the English press. This punctuation is found, therefore, in the earliest ed=
ition that was issued, and=20

in those on which the most care has been bestowed. Yet what is the sense wh=
ich the lines thus=20

punctuated present?        "Thy waters wasted them [_i.e._ the empires] whi=
le           they were free,=20

And many a tyrant since."  They waters wasted many a tyrant? How, in the na=
me of wonder?=20

What sort of an occupation is this to assign to the majestic ocean? Does th=
e poet mean to assert=20

that anciently it wasted empires, and now it only wastes individuals. Absur=
d! Yet such is the only=20

meaning, as far as I see, that can be assigned to the lines as they stand. =
 If the punctuation be=20

altered, that is, if the semicolon after "since" be removed, and a comma pl=
aced at the end of the=20

line, the whole becomes luminous:        "Thy waters wasted them while they=
 were free,       And=20

many a tyrant since their shores obey."  That is (I beg pardon if I am unne=
cessarily explanatory),=20

"The waters wasted these empires while they were free, and since they have =
been enslaved,"--an=20



apt illustration of that indifference to human affairs which the poet is at=
tributing to the ocean. The=20

words, "the stranger, slave, or savage," which follow in the next line, are=
 to be taken in connexion=20

with the phrase "many a tyrant," and as an enumeration of the different sor=
ts of tyrants to which=20

these unhappy empires have been subjected.  This is my view of the sense of=
 this famous=20

passage: if any of your correspondents can point out a better, I can only s=
ay "candidus imperti,"=20

&c.  There was a very elaborate article on Lord Byron's Address to the Ocea=
n in to present an=20

agreeable appearance. If to these qualities she adds a scent for novelty an=
d style, she may hope=20

to be, as far as clothes are concerned, =E2=80=9Cvery smart indeed.=E2=80=
=9D If beyond this she have the artist=E2=80=99s gift,=20

she may make herself better than =E2=80=9Csmart,=E2=80=9D she may be beauti=
ful.  [Sidenote: MINOR POINTS IN=20

DRESS]  One minor point: the handkerchief, when not in actual use, should b=
e invisible. It is a=20

concession to nature, and to carry it in the hand, tuck it in the belt or u=
p the sleeve is provincial. A=20

muff or a party bag of dainty texture may serve to hide it in lieu of a poc=
ket.         *       *       *       *=20

*  [Sidenote: HAPHAZARD DRESSING]  At women=E2=80=99s parties in this count=
ry one sees a variety of=20

costumes not all suited to the occasion. The hostess at a luncheon may wear=
 a white lingerie=20

dress, one of her guests will be in a shirt-waist costume, a second in whit=
e satin and the rest in=20

quiet silks or in elegant chiffon waists and cloth or velvet skirts. The pi=
cture is spoiled by this=20

haphazard dressing. The majority were correctly attired but the shirt-waist=
 and the white satin were=20

equally wrong. The hostess who knows that any one of her guests may be comp=
elled to dress with=20

exceptional plainness will help to make that person comfortable by wearing =
a quiet gown herself.=20

Except at very intimate affairs it is wiser, however, to decline an invitat=
ion than to make an=20

embarrassingly poor appearance.  At afternoon receptions one often sees the=
 hostess and her=20

assistants in elaborate gowns, while many of the callers are in tailored st=
reet costume. This again=20

spoils the picture. If a woman expects to attend afternoon affairs she shou=
ld have an afternoon=20

gown.         *       *       *       *       *  Highly polished finger-nai=
ls of a length to suggest claws, are=20

plainly visible, gently push back the scarf-skin at the base of the nail da=
ily with an orange-wood=20

stick. A little cold cream rubbed in nightly around the edges of the nails =
is a great help. No sharp=20

instrument should ever be used to clean the nails. The orange-wood sticks a=

GLOVES]  Su=C3=A8de gloves are softer in appearance and more elegant than t=
he glac=C3=A9 ones, but as=20

they soil more quickly and clean less readily they should not be attempted =
by women of limited=20

means. A delicately colored glove is more artistic with many costumes than =
a pure white one, but=20

here again practicability must be counted, as the light-colored glove will =
seldom clean well and the=20

white one does. A woman who must carefully consider the cost of her dressin=
g will, if she is clever,=20

plan mezzo-tinted costumes which are artistic and becoming and which do not=
 demand light or=20

white gloves.         *       *       *       *       *  Transparent blouse=
s that display the under-clothing are=20

bad form. If very sheer material is used, a special slip should be worn und=
er the blouse. Very thin=20

hose are equally objectionable. Perfume of any sort is now taboo beyond the=
 elusive scent of=20

lavender or violet sachets in one=E2=80=99s dresser drawers, or a dash of t=
oilet water in the bath.=20

[Sidenote: DRESSING FOR CHURCH]  One=E2=80=99s dress at church should invar=
iably be quiet. This is=20



prescribed not only by taste but by consideration for others who may be pre=
sent and who may be=20

of more limited means. A church is of all places the one in which to avoid =
exciting envy by costly=20

apparel.         *       *       *       *       *  One of the mistaken ide=
as held by women who are just=20

becoming sensitive to effects in dress is that everything should match. The=
 result in such cases if=20

not positively bad is usually dull and monotonous. The woman who wears with=
 her blue suit a blue=20

hat with a blue feather and a blue veil, a blue waist and blue gloves and s=
hoes, is a nightmare. A=20

black hat, an =C3=A9cru veil, gray gloves perhaps=E2=80=94in these ways rel=
ief and variety must be obtained. In=20

choosing colors, the skin, hair and eyes should all be considered. It is an=
 exploded idea that=20

brunettes should cling to brown. Much depends on the complexion.     CHAPTE=
R XVI  MAKING=20

AND RECEIVING GIFTS   WEDDING gifts may be sent any time after the wedding =
cards are=20

issued. They are sent to the bride, and may be as expensive and elaborate, =
or as simple and=20

inexpensive, as the means of the sender make proper. An invitation to a chu=
rch wedding,=20


_
dissects it almost line by line, has somehow, as is the wont of commentator=
s, happened to pass=20

over the difficulty which stands right in his way. To make up for this, how=
ever, he contrives to find=20

new difficulties of his own. The following is a specimen:    "Recite," he s=
ays, "the stanza beginning,=20

'Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee;'    and when the sonorou=
s roll has subsided, try=20

to understand it. You   will find some difficulty, if we mistake not, in kn=
owing who or   what is the=20

apostrophized subject. Unquestionably the world's   ocean, and not the Medi=
terranean. The very=20

last verse we were far   in the Atlantic:        'Thy shores are empires.' =
   "The shores of the world's=20

ocean are empires. There are, or have   been, the British empire, the Germa=
n empire, the Russian=20

empire,   and the empire of the Great Mogul, the Chinese empire, the empire=
   of Morocco, the=20

four great empires of antiquity, the French   empire, and some others. The =
poet does not intend=20

names and things   in this very strict way, however," &c.  What empires the=
 poet _did_ mean there=20

is surely no difficulty in discovering, for those who wish to understand ra=
ther than to cavil. The very=20

next line to that quoted is--        "_Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage,_ wh=
at are they?"  and it=20

would require some hardihood to assert that these empires were not on the s=
hores of the=20

Mediterranean.  After all, the best commentators are translators: they are =
obliged to take the=20

difficulties by the horns. I find, in a translation of Byron's _Works_ publ=
ished at Pforzheim in 1842,=20

the lines thus the necessity of making a wedding-present. Indeed the matter=
 of wedding-presents=20

admits of more freedom each year and many people make it a rule to send gif=
ts only to intimate=20

friends and relatives. Perhaps this state of affairs has been brought about=
 by the fact that among a=20

certain=E2=80=94or uncertain=E2=80=94class, invitations were sometimes issu=
ed with the special purpose of calling=20

forth a number of presents,=E2=80=94in fact, for revenue only. Few persons =
acknowledge this of=20

themselves, but sometimes a bride was met who was so indiscreet or so void =
of taste as to=20

confess her hope that all the persons whom she invited to her nuptials woul=
d be represented by=20

remembrances in gold, silver, jewelry or napery. The pendulum has swung as =
far in the opposite=20

direction, and fewer wedding gifts than of old are sent from politeness alo=
ne.  Suitable gifts for a=20

 for those who are=20

compelled to take their notion of the poetry of _Childe Harold_ from his Ge=
rman, instead of the=20

original English! There is one passage in which the reader finds this refle=
ction driven hard upon=20

him. Who is there that does not know Byron's stanza on the Dying Gladiator,=
 when, speaking of=20

"The inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won,"  he adds, in lines whi=
ch will be read _till_=20

Homer and Virgil are forgotten:        "He heard it, but he heeded not--his=
 eyes       Were with his=20

heart, and that was far away;       He reck'd not of the life he lost nor p=

    All this gush'd with his=20

blood--shall he expire       And unavenged? Arise, ye Goths! and glut your =
ire!"  There are two=20

phrases in this stanza which seem to me to have never been surpassed: "youn=
g barbarians," and=20

"all this _gushed with his blood_." How inimitable is "young barbarians!" T=
he "curiosa felicitas" of=20

Horace never carried him farther,--or perhaps so far. Herr Duttenhofer cont=
ents himself by saying--=20

"fern am Donaustrand       Sind seine Kinder, freuend sich am Spiel."  "Afa=
r on the shore of the=20
