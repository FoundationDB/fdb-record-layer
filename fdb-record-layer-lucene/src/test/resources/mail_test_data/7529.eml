about! But, as usual, we hide our real feelings behind this flippant mask. Reading between the 

lines we confess to strange apprehensions. Why has the Princess so gravely exceeded her dress 

allowance? Has she, on behalf of her beloved country, been collecting war-ships? Has she 50 or 



60 _Dreadnoughts_ up her sleeve to upset the balance of naval power on "the day"? We make the 

German Chancellor a present of these disturbing reflections.         *       *       *       *       *  HIS 

SON'S FATHER.  In at least one of our daily newspapers the attention of the public was recently 

drawn to a brilliant young orator, ANTHONY ASQUITH by name, who began a series of lectures at 

Antibes before influential audiences. The first two of the series dealt with aviation and music 

respectively. We understand that the titles of the remainder of the series will include "Physical 

Culture," "The Limitations of Radium," "The Place of Theosophy in Metaphysics," and "The Proper 

Education of the Child."  We learn from a correspondent that this gifted gentleman (who, by the 

way, is still quite young, being, well on the bright side of his teens) is a member of a highly-

respected London family resident within a stone's throw of Whitehall.  After a career full of promise 

at Oxford, Master ANTHONY ASQUITH's father was called to the Bar; and although he no longer 

follows the profession of barrister (in which, by the way, he rose to the distinction of King's 

Counsel), he is not forgotten by many of his old colleagues in Lincoln's Inn. It was at one time 

common knowledge that he would certainly have been made a judge had he only remained active 

in his profession. He has devoted the last few years, however, to political work, which has always 

had a particular attraction for him. As a man of sound judgment and ready acumen, Mr. 

ANTHONY ASQUITH's father is much honoured in the councils of his own party; he is also a very 

effective speaker, and is sure of a large and appreciative audience whenever he addresses a 

meeting, whether it be in London or elsewhere.  We venture to predict that the world will hear 

further of the man whom the remarkable performance of his youthful son has established within 

the public eye.         *       *       *       *       *  THE NEW "AGONY COLUMN."  (_A forecast of

*       *       *       *  MUSIC AND MILLINERY.  The luminous suggestion that ladies attending the 

forthcoming performances of _Parsifal_ should wear mantillas instead of aigrettes is almost the 

first serious attempt to bring the arts of music and dress into a true and fitting relation. We are 

therefore not in the least surprised to learn that a movement is on foot to promote sumptuary 

legislation to secure this end as part and parcel of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE's far-reaching 

programme of social reform. Pending the realisation of these schemes the Editor of _Music for the 

Million_ has had the happy thought of interviewing a number of distinguished musicians, whose 

views may be summarised herewith.  Sir HENRY WOOD said that conductors and orchestral 

players were extraordinarily sensitive to sartorial influences. Unfortunately the force of tradition 

was so strong that he found it impossible to indulge his tastes. It was _de rigueur_ to conduct in 

either a frock or an evening coat, but if he had his own way he would vary his garb for every 

composer. For example, he would like to wear a harlequin's dress for STRAUSS, a full-bottomed 

wig and ruffles for BACH, HAYDN and GLUCK, a red tie and a cap of Liberty for SCHOeNBERG, 

and the uniform of a Cossack of the Ukraine for TCHAIKOVSKY. Instead of which the utmost 

liberty that he was allowed was a butterfly tie. He thought that members of the orchestra ought to 

be permitted to consult their individual tastes in dress. Certain restrictions would of course be 

needed. Thus, uniforms were all very well for dance and restaurant bands, but he would not like to 

see the Queen's Hall Symphony Orchestra competing with Blue Bessarabians or Pink Alsatians. 

Herr KUBELIK declared that a violin _virtuoso_ could never play his best by daylight. Artificial light, 

full evening dress and diamonds were indispensable in an audience. You would not play 

_bravura_ music to people in morning costume; it was like drinking champagne out of a teacup. 

Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON said that as the highest form of musical composition was a Funeral 

March he was in favour of making black obligatory for all persons who attended high-class 

symphonic concerts. The kaleidoscopic colours affected by modern women of fashion distracted 

serious artists and sometimes made them play wrong notes. An exception might perhaps be 

allowed in favour of dark purple, because of its association with mourning, but the glaring colour 

schemes now in vogue were to be deprecated as prejudicial to solemnity. It pained him to see 

music reduced to the menial position of the handmaid of levity.  Professor BANTOCK said that he 

was entirely in favour of establishing an equation between music and the costume of those who 

performed or listened to it. For instance, he felt that his _Omar Khayyam_ would make a far 

deeper impression if the audience were all clad in Persian garb. The same need for local colour 

would be felt in the case of his new Siberian

audience. She strongly condemned the practice followed by some ladies of
