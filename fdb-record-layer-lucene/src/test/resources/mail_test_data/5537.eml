I had my little Fletcher No. 24 in my hand--that handy little weapon that almost formed an extra 

bone of myself, and, whispering to Abou Do to hold my bridle close to the bit, as Aggahr was not 

very steady under fire, I took a clean shot direct at the centre of the shoulder. The ball smacked as 

though it had struck an iron target. Aggahr gave a start, and for the moment both Abou Do and 

myself were prepared for a rush; but the buffalo had never flinched, and he remained standing as 

though immoveable. Abon Do whispered, "You missed him, I heard the bullet strike the tree;" I 

shook my head, and quickly re-loaded--it was impossible to miss at that distance, and I knew that I 

had fired steadily. Hardly had I rammed the bullet down, when, with a sudden thump, down fell the 

buffalo upon his side, and, rolling over upon his back, he gave a few tremendous struggles, and 

lay dead.  Great caution should be invariably used in approaching a fallen buffalo and all other 

dangerous animals, as they are apt to recover sufficiently, upon seeing the enemy, to make a last 

effort to attack, which is generally more serious than any other phase of the hunt. We accordingly 

pitched a few large stones at him to test the reality of death, and then walked up and examined 

him. The Reilly No. 10 had gone quite through the neck, but had missed a vital part. The little 

Fletcher had made a clean and minute hole exactly through the shoulder, and upon opening the 

body we found the ball sticking in the ribs on the opposite side, having passed through the very 

centre of the lungs.  The aggageers now carefully flayed it, and divided the tough hide into 

portions accurately measured for shields. One man galloped back to direct the two water-camels 

that were following in our tracks, while others cut up the buffalo, and prepared the usual disgusting 

feast by cutting up the reeking paunch, over which they squeezed the contents of the gall-bladder, 

and consumed the whole, raw and steaming.* On the arrival of the camels they were quickly 

loaded, and we proceeded to fire the grass on our return to camp. The Arabs always obtained 

their fire by the friction of two pieces of wood; accordingly, they set to work. A piece of dry nabbuk 

was selected, about as thick as the little finger. A notch was cut in this, and it was laid horizontally 

upon the ground, with the notch uppermost; into this was fixed the sharp point of a similar piece of 

wood, about eighteen inches long, which, being held perpendicularly with both hands, was night, 

and he heard in his dreams a voice saying: "You are a millionaire!"  When he wrote out miserable 

little bills for ten or fifteen florins, these words seemed to dance before him on the paper:  "Lay 

down your pen, Gyuri Wibra, you have treasures enough already, heaven only knows how much. 

Your father saved it up for you, so you have a right to it. You are a rich man, Gyuri, and not a poor 

lawyer. Throw away those deeds and look for your treasure. Where are you to look for it? Why, 

that is just the question that drives one mad. Perhaps sometimes, when you are tired out, and 

throw yourself down on the ground to rest, it may be just beneath you, it is, perhaps, just beginning 

to get warm under your hand when you take it away to do something else, and it may be you will 

never find it at all. And what a life you could lead, what a lot you could do with the money. You 

could drive a four-in-hand, drink champagne, keep a lot of servants. A new world, a new life would 

be open to you. And to possess all this you only need a little luck; but as you have none at 

present, take up your pen again, my friend, and go on writing out deeds and bills, and squeezing a 

few florins out of the poor Slovaks."  It was a great pity he had heard anything about the missing 

treasure. He felt it himself, and often said he wished he knew nothing about it, and would be very 

glad if something were to happen which would go to prove that the treasure did not really exist; for 

instance, if some one would remark:  "Oh, yes, I met old Gregorics once in Monte Carlo; he was 



losing his money as fast as he could."  But no such thing happened; on the contrary, new 

witnesses were always turning up to assure him: "Old Gregorics must certainly have left an 

immense fortune, which he intended you to have. Don't you really know anything about it?"  No, he 

knew nothing at all about it, but his thoughts were always running on the subject, spoiling all his 

pleasure in life. The promising youth had really become only half a man, for he had two separate 

and distinct persons in him. Sometimes he entirely gave himself up to the idea that he was the 

child of a servant, and began to feel he had attained to a really good position by means of his own 

work, and was happy and contented in this thought. But only a word was needed to make the 

lawyer a totally different man. He was now the son of rich old Pal Gregorics, waiting to find and 

take possession of his property. And from time to time he suffered all the pangs of Tantalus, and

palms like a drill, with as great a pressure as possible, from the top to the bottom, as the hands 

descended with the motion of rubbing or rolling the stick. After about two minutes of great labour, 

the notch began to smoke, a brown dust, like ground coffee, fell from the singed wood, and this 

charred substance, after increased friction, emitted a still denser smoke, and commenced 

smouldering; the fire was produced. A rag was torn from the thorn-brushed drawers of one of the 

party, in which the fire was carefully wrapped and fanned with the breath; it was then placed in a 

wisp of dry grass, and rapidly turned in the air until the flame burst forth. A burning-glass should be 

always carried in these countries, where a cloudless sky ensures an effect. Although in Arab 

hands the making of fire appears exceedingly simple, I have never been able to effect it. I have 

worked at the two sticks until they have been smoking and I have been steaming, with my hands 

blistered, but I have never got beyond the smoke; there is a peculiar knack which, like playing the 

fiddle, must be acquired, although it looks very easy. It is not every wood that will produce fire by 

this method; those most inflammable are the cotton-tree and the nabbuk. We now descended to 

the river, and fired the grass; the north wind was brisk, and the flames extended over miles of 

country within an hour.    * All these Arabs, in like manner with the Abyssinians,     are subject to 

the attacks of intestinal worms, induced     by their habit of eating raw flesh.  We returned towards 

the camp. On the way we saw numerous antelopes; and, dismounting, I ordered one of the 

hunters to lead my horse while I attempted to stalk a fine buck mehedehet (Redunca 

Ellipsyprimna). There were several in the herd, but there was a buck with a fine head a few yards 

in advance; they were standing upon an undulation on open ground backed by high grass. I had 

marked a small bush as my point of cover, and creeping unobserved towards this, I arrived 

unseen within about a hundred and twenty yards of the buck. With the Fletcher 24 I made a good 

shoulder-shot; the buck gave a few bounds and fell dead; the does looked on in astonishment, and 

I made an equally lucky shot with the left-hand barrel, bringing down what I at first had mistaken to 

be a doe, but I discovered it to be a young buck.  The Mehedehet is an antelope of great beauty; it 

resembles the red deer in colour, but the coat is still rougher; it stands about thirteen hands in 

height, with a pair of long slightly-curved annulated horns. The live weight of the male would be 

about five hundred pounds; the female, like the nellut (Tragelaphus Strepsiceros), is devoid of 

horns, and much resembles the female of the Sambur deer of India. This antelope is the "water-

buck" of South to look after itself for weeks at a time, while he went to Vienna to look up some of 

his father's old acquaintances.  The rich carriage-builder, who had bought Gregorics's house in 

Vienna, gave him valuable information.  "Your father," he said, "once told me when I paid him for 

the house, that he should put the money in some bank, and asked me which would be the best 

and safest way to set to work about it."  Gyuri wandered then from one bank to another, but 

without success. Thoroughly worn out he returned to Besztercebanya with the full intention of not 

thinking any more about the subject.  "I am not going on making a fool of myself," he said. "I won't 

let the Golden Calf go on lowing in my ears forever. I will not take another step in the affair, and 

shall imagine I dreamed it all."  But it was easier said than done. You can throw ashes on a 

smouldering fire--it will put it out, but not prevent it smoking.  Sometimes one friend referred to it, 

sometimes another. His mother, who now walked on crutches, often spoke of the good old times, 

sitting in her arm-chair by the fire. And at length she owned that old Gregorics had wanted to 

telegraph for Gyuri on his deathbed.  "He seemed as though he could not die till he had seen you," 



she said. "But it was my fault you came too late."  "And why did he so much want to see me?"  "He 

said he wanted to give you something."  A light broke in upon Gyuri's brain. The Vienna carriage-

builder had given him to understand that his father's fortune was represented by a receipt for 

money placed in a bank, and from the information his mother now gave him, he concluded that the 

old gentleman had intended giving him the receipt before his death. So he must always have kept 

it by him. But what had become of it? In which bank was the money deposited? Could he, knowing 

what he did, give up the idea of finding it?  No, no, it was impossible! It could not be lost! Why, a 

grain of wheat, if dropped in a ditch, would reappear in time, however unexpectedly. And in a case 

of this kind, a chance word, a sign, could clear up every doubt.  He had not long to wait. One day, 

the dying mayor of the town, Tamas Krikovszky, sent for him to make his will. Several people, 

holding high positions in the town, were assembled in the room. There lay the mayor, pale and 

weak, but he still seemed to retain some of the majesty of his office, in the manner in which he 

took leave of his inferiors in office, recommending the welfare of the town to them, and then taking 

from under his pillow the official seal, he put it into their hands, saying:  "For twenty years I have 

sealed the truth with it!"  Then he dictated his will to Gyuri, and while doing so, referred now and 

then to various incidents in his life.  "Dear me, what times those were," he said once, 


_
On arrival at the camp, I resolved to fire the entire country on the following day, and to push still 

farther up the course of the Settite to the foot of the mountains, and to return to this camp in about 

a fortnight, by which time the animals that had been scared away by the fire would have returned. 

Accordingly, on the following morning, accompanied by a few of the aggageers, I started upon the 

south bank of the river, and rode for some distance into the interior, to the ground that was entirely 

covered with high withered grass. We were passing through a mass of kittar and thorn-bush, 

almost hidden by the immensely high grass, when, as I was ahead of the party, I came suddenly 

upon the tracks of a rhinoceros; these were so unmistakeably recent that I felt sure we were not 

far from the animals themselves. As I had wished to fire the grass, I was accompanied by my 

Tokrooris, and my horse-keeper, Mahomet No. 2. It was difficult ground for the men, and still more 

unfavourable for the horses, as large disjointed masses of stone were Gyuri. "Your father had a 

red umbrella, with a hollow handle, in which he used to carry valuable papers from one camp to 

another, in the days when he was a spy."  "What!" stammered Gyuri. "The red umbrella?" and his 

eyes shone.  Like a flash of lightning a thought had entered his head. The receipt was in that 

umbrella! His blood began to course madly in his veins, as the certitude of the truth of his 

suspicion grew upon him. Yes, there it was, he was sure of it; and all at once he remembered the 

incident in Szeged, how Gregorics had let his umbrella fall in the water, his anxiety, and offer of a 

large reward for its discovery. Then again, the old gentleman's words rang in his ear:  "The 

umbrella will once belong to you, and you will find it useful to protect you from the rain."  The 

bystanders could not imagine why Gyuri seemed so much put about at the mayor's death; in their 

opinion it was quite right of the old man to take his departure, he had dragged on with his gouty 

old leg quite long enough, and should now make room for younger 


_
grass.  We were just speculating as to the position of the rhinoceros, and thinking how 

uncommonly unpleasant it would be should he obtain our wind, when whiff! whiff! whiff! We heard 

the sharp whistling snort, with a tremendous rush through the high grass and thorns close to us; 

and at the same moment two of these determined brutes were upon us in full charge. I never saw 

such a scrimmage; sauve qui peut! There was no time for more than one look his life for nothing, 

for were they not going to have his portrait painted and hung in the Town Hall, a grand ending to 

his life? If he lived for ten years longer he could have no greater honor done him, and his portrait 

would be even uglier than now.  They were even more surprised at the strange question which 

Gyuri, in spite of the solemnity of the occasion, put to the dying man.  "And was the hole big, sir?" 

"What hole?" asked the mayor, who had 


_
him round the neck, I ducked my head down to his shoulder, well protected with my strong 

hunting-cap, and I kept the spurs going as hard as I could ply them, blindly trusting to Providence 

and my good horse, over big rocks, fallen trees, thick kittar thorns, and grass ten feet high, with 

the two infernal animals in full chase only a few feet behind me. I heard their abominable whiffing 

close to me, but so did good horse also, and the good old hunter flew over obstacles that I should 

have thought impossible, and he dashed straight under the hooked thorn bushes and doubled like 

a hare. The aggageers were all scattered; Mahomet No. 2 was knocked over by a rhinoceros; all 

the men were sprawling upon the rocks with their guns, and the party was entirely discomfited. 

Having passed the kittar thorn, I turned, and, seeing that the beasts had gone straight on, I 

brought  "The hole in the handle of the umbrella."  "I really don't know, I never asked Gregorics." 

He closed his eyes, and in a weak voice added, with that phlegma which only a Hungarian 

displays on his deathbed:  "But if you wait a bit, I'll ask him."  And he probably kept his promise, for 

half an hour later a black flag was flying from the roof of the Town Hall, and the bell of the Roman 

Catholic church was tolling.  Gyuri Wibra had hurried home, nervous and excited, and was now 

marching up and down his office, his heart beating wildly with joy.  "I have the treasure at last!" he 

kept on repeating to himself, "at least, I should have it if I had the umbrella. But where is it?" He 

could neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep till he had settled it. He questioned his mother on the 

subject, and she did her best to answer him, but could only repeat:  "How am I to remember that, 

my

perfectly impossible; it was only a wonder that the horse had escaped in ground so difficult for 

riding. Although my clothes were of the strongest and coarsest Arab cotton cloth, which seldom 

tore, but simply lost a thread when caught in a thorn, I was nearly naked. My blouse was reduced 

to shreds; as I wore sleeves only half way from the shoulder to the elbow, my naked arms were 

streaming with blood; fortunately my hunting cap was secured with a chin strap, and still more 

fortunately I had grasped the horse's neck, otherwise I must have been dragged out of the saddle 

by the hooked thorns. All the men were cut and bruised, some having fallen upon their heads 

among the rocks, and others do you want that ragged umbrella for?"  Gyuri sighed.  "If I have to 

dig it out of the ground with my ten fingers, I will do it."  "Perhaps Matyko will remember something 

about it?"  Matyko was soon found; he sat smoking his pipe in the anteroom of the office, for he 

was now Gyuri's servant. But he also said he had forgotten far more important things than that in 

all these years; but this much he did remember, that the dead man had kept the umbrella near him 

till the hour of his death.  "Heaven only knows," he added, "why he took such care of the ragged 

old thing."  (Not only heaven knew the reason now, but Gyuri too!)  He got more information from 

the old woman who kept the grocer's 


_
escape. Mahomet No. 2, the horse-keeper, was more frightened than hurt, as he had been 

knocked down by the shoulder and not by the horn of the rhinoceros, as the animal had not 

noticed him; its attention was absorbed by the horse.  I determined to set fire to the whole country 

immediately, and descending the hill towards the river to obtain a favourable wind, I put my men in 

a line, extending over about a mile along the river's old Gregorics's house; she had been in the 

house when he died, and had helped to lay him out. She swore by heaven and earth that the 

umbrella had been tightly clutched in the dead man's hand, and they had had the greatest difficulty 

in freeing it from his grasp.  "Yes," said the old woman, "the umbrella was certainly in his hand, 

may I never move from this spot if it is not true."  "It is all the same," muttered Gyuri; "we want
