study human nature in the towns; and we do not want to be pursued by its no=
isier manifestations=20

amid scenes that call for the sympathetic presence of peace. Shaugh Prior, =
finely placed on the=20

border of the moorland, is entirely delightful, as also is Meavy, with its =
famous oak, twenty-five feet=20

in girth, and its village cross. Lovers of such things will specially notic=
e the old font-cover of the=20

church at Shaugh. There is also a notable cross on the slope of Ringmore Do=
wn, over eight feet in=20

height, the tallest on the moor.  One of the pleasantest spots of this corn=
er of Dartmoor is the=20

village of Sheepstor, a familiar sight from the railway to all who are maki=
ng the journey to=20

Princetown by train. It lies at a little distance from the rail, but the Bu=
rrator reservoir here=20

constructed for the supply of Plymouth, in the bed of an ancient lake, prob=
ably draws more curious=20

visitors than do the beauty and interest of its surroundings. Sheepstor Chu=
rch has been unhappily=20

restored, to the sad detriment of its exquisite screen, enough of which has=
 been preserved to tell=20

of its original glory. The tor itself rises finely above the clustering cot=
tages of the village, and a=20

cavern called the Pixies' Cave is shown as the refuge of one of the Elford =
family during the Civil=20

War. It is said that he lay concealed here, somewhat in the manner of the B=
aron Bradwardine's=20

concealment in Scott's _Waverley_, while the Roundhead troopers were closel=
y searching his=20

house and grounds, at Langstone by Burrator. Having won the affection of th=
e peasantry, they=20

kept his secret and provided him with food. It is said that he occupied his=
 enforced leisure by=20

painting the sides of the cave, but no traces of painting can now be seen. =
The cave is difficult to=20

find, and nothing but treachery could have revealed the hiding-place. It is=
 not stated whether=20

Elford's presence drove out the pixies to whom the cavern really belonged; =
but in case they still=20

remain it is well to remember the usual etiquette of leaving a pin or some =
other small gift. Pixies=20

seem to be as easily pleased as are the patron saints of some holy wells.  =
A remarkable story is=20

told by Mrs. Bray as to the manner in which the cholera reached Sheepstor d=
uring the terrible=20

visitation of 1832. A man of supposed poverty died, with his wife and child=
ren, at Plymouth, where=20

the plague was raging fiercely, and their home was visited by two brothers,=
 with small hope of=20

picking up anything valuable. To their surprise a large sum in cash was fou=
nd, and the brothers=20

fought together over the dead bodies in order to possess it. While fighting=
, they were disturbed by=20

the police, and one of the two, having actually assumed some of the clothes=
 of the dead man, took=20

refuge in a cottage at Sheepstor. Strangely enough, he escaped the infectio=
n himself, but it was=20

taken by the two worthy cottagers, and they both died. Their little boy, th=
us orphaned, carried word=20

to Tavistock that his parents had both died and that he had been left alone=
   But even here there=20

was a false note; and he knew it. Perhaps he was vaguely jealous of any ali=
en interference: was=20

not Meenie the sole and only care of the giant mountain?  Anyhow, the verse=
s were of no avail for=20

Meenie's book; and otherwise he did not care for them; so the envelope was =
crumpled up and=20

thrown away.  On the evening before the brother and sister were to leave fo=
r the south, Meenie=20

came along to see them. Ronald had got quite accustomed to find Miss Dougla=
s in the house of=20

late; for Maggie needed a good deal of direction and help--the tearful litt=
le lass being sorely=20

distraught at the thought of going away.  But on this occasion it was himse=
lf she had come to=20

seek.  'I have made a little drawing for you, Ronald,' said she--and the be=
autiful Highland eyes=20

were downcast a little--'as well as I could, of the loch and the hills and =
the river; and I want you to=20

take it to Glasgow with you, and put it on the mantelpiece of your room, an=
d then sometimes it will=20

make you think of the old place and of us all.'  'I'm sure, it will not nee=
d a picture to make me do=20



that,' said he, 'but all the same I am obliged to ye, and it will be the ch=
ief treasure in the house----'=20

'Oh no, oh no,' she said, with a rueful smile--and she ventured to raise he=
r eyes.  'You must not=20

think it a picture at all--but only a few lines scribbled on a paper-knife =
to make you remember the=20

place when you happen to find it lying about.  And you must not look at it =
until I have gone,=20

because you would feel bound to praise it; and that would be as awkward for=
 you as for me--for=20

indeed it is nothing at all.  And here,' she added, producing a small slip =
of paper, 'is my sister's=20

address in Glasgow; and I have written to her; and she will be very glad if=
 you will call on them=20

when you have the time.'  'I don't know how to thank ye,' said he.  'It's w=
hen people are going=20

away that they find out how many friends they are leaving behind.'  'In you=
r case' said she, very=20

modestly and prettily, 'it is not difficult to count--you have only to say =
the whole country-side.'  And=20

then she added: 'I heard of the lads that came all the way from Tongue.'  '=
The wild fellows!--they=20

had a long tramp here and back home again.'  She looked at him rather hesit=
atingly.  'There will be=20

a great many coming to see you off to-morrow morning, Ronald,' she said.  '=
I should think not--I=20

should think not,' he said.  'Oh, but I know there will be.  Every one is t=
alking of it.  And I was=20

thinking--if it was not too much trouble--if you were not too busy--I was w=
ondering if you would=20

come along and say good-bye to my father and mother this evening--I would r=
ather have that than-

-than--with a crowd of people standing by----'  'Oh yes, certainly,' he sai=
d, at once.  'When will I=20

come?  Now, if ye like.'  'And Maggie too?'  'Yes, yes, why not?'  'And abo=
ut my album, Ronald?'=20

'Well,' said he, with not a little embarrassment, 'I have not written anyth=
ing in it yet; but I will give it=20

to you in the morning;=20


_
considered so remarkable that the cholera should have visited so healthy a =
spot, and especially=20

people of such known cleanliness, that an enquiry was instituted and the st=
ory came out.=20

[Illustration: STONE AVENUE, NEAR MERRIVALE]  Before leaving Sheepstor some=
thing should=20

be said of the fine stone rows and other remains at Drizzlecombe, but it is=
 impossible here to give=20

full attention to these numerous relics. We find a reminder of the Elford f=
amily in the name of=20

Yelverton, a corruption of Elford-town. Yelverton and Dousland have both be=
come popular with=20

residents and visitors, having the convenience of rail and commanding a dis=
trict of great beauty.=20

But, attractive as they are, neither can claim to be on the moorland, nor c=
an this claim be made by=20

Tavistock itself, though that town boasts of being the "western gate of Dar=
tmoor". There is a rich=20

supply of beauty and of delightful associations at Tavistock, but it was ne=
ver a moor town. Here=20

and at Buckland Monachorum are many traces of the two rival abbeys, of whic=
h Tavistock was far=20

the more ancient and the more wealthy. Both spots if there's nothing in it,=
 then ye must just=20

understand that I could not get anything good enough, and I will send somet=
hing from Glasgow----'=20

'Indeed no,' said she promptly.  'Why should you trouble about a thing like=
 that?  Write your name=20

in the book, Ronald, and that will be enough.'  The three of them now went =
outside, and the door=20

was shut behind them. It was a beautiful night; the moon was slowly rising =
over the solitudes of=20

Strath-Terry; and the lake was like a sheet of silver.  They were rather si=
lent as they walked along=20

the gray highway; to-morrow was to make a difference to all of their lives.=
  When they reached the=20

Doctor's cottage, and when Ronald and Maggie were ushered into the parlour,=
 it was clear that the=20

visit had been expected; for there was cake on the table, and there were pl=
ates and knives, and a=20

decanter of sherry, and a number of wine-glasses.  And not only was the big=
 good-humoured=20

Doctor as friendly as ever, but even the awe-inspiring little Dresden-china=
 lady condescended, in=20

these unusual circumstances, to be gracious. Of course the talk was all abo=
ut=20


_
have memories of Francis Drake, and at Tavistock there is an admirable stat=
ue. Buckland and=20

Buckfast, being both Cistercian, had much communication; and the influence =
of these three=20

abbeys was great in preserving the moorland trackways, setting up crosses f=
or the guidance of=20

travellers, and keeping the moor open to a gradual course of civilization. =
They were also centres of=20

art and culture at a period when such things were at a discount, and in thi=
s respect we can never=20

be too grateful to the old monastic settlements. Whether or not we class th=
em among those good=20

things whose corruption is worst, they were undoubtedly good in their day. =
We find around=20

Dartmoor as elsewhere that the monks chose their localities well, with a ke=
en eye for natural=20

beauty and the advantages of water. We may infer also that they ventured ac=
ross Dartmoor when=20

other men were chary of crossing it, and their faith had certainly the cour=
age of its convictions. If=20

we and his prospects in Glasgow, and so forth; and Mrs. Douglas took care t=
o impress him with=20

the fact that, on the occasion of Lord Ailine having recently spent an even=
ing with them, his=20

lordship had distinctly approved of the step Ronald had taken, and hoped it=
 might turn out well in=20

every way.  'Will there be any office work, Ronald?' the Doctor asked.  'I =
suppose so, for a time.'=20

'You'll not like that, my lad.'  'I'll have to take what comes, like other =
folk,' was the simple answer.=20

How pretty Meenie was on this last evening!  She did not say much; and she =
hardly ever looked at=20

him; but her presence, then as ever, seemed to bring with it an atmosphere =
of gentleness and=20

sweetness; and when, by chance, she did happen to regard him, there was a k=
ind of magic=20

wonder in her eyes that for the moment rather bedazzled him and made his an=
swers to these=20

good people's inquiries somewhat inconsecutive.  For they were curious to k=
now about his plans=20


_
that they will be other than kindly. If they are ghosts now, there was a ti=
me when they drove forth=20

ghosts themselves, and when they converted pagan monuments into symbols of =
the religion of=20

love.  It would be very pleasant to linger about Tavistock, with its intere=
st in his welfare; while all=20

the time he sate thinking of how strange Glasgow would be without the chanc=
e of catching a=20

glimpse of Meenie anywhere; and wondering whether his dream-sweetheart--the=
 imaginary=20

Meenie whom he courted and wooed and won in these=20
