208                                    CHAPTER 1                        The Stranger in the Storm   Burrowing deep 

into the hoods of their slickers, the two Cub Scouts hastened along the darkening street.  Stinging 

gusts of rain pelted their faces. The strong wind fairly bowled them off their feet.  "Say Brad, this is 

awful!"  "It's sure coming down--and how!" agreed the older boy.  Brad Wilber, dark-haired and 

serious, was a Boy Scout and a leader among the younger boys. An outstanding athlete and 

nearly ready for high school, he served as Den Chief of the Webster City Cubs.  His companion, 

the blue-eyed, sandy-haired Dan Carter, had just turned ten.  Firm of muscle and old for his years, 

the younger boy grew so fast it was hard to keep him in Cub uniforms.  He and Brad had been 

good friends ever since Sam Hatfield had organized Den 2. On this particular evening, they had 

been overtaken by the storm on their way to a Cub meeting at the church.  "Say, let's hold up a 

second!" Dan gasped as a heavy curtain of rain veiled the sidewalk ahead.  The pair halted a 

moment under a store awning, there to catch their breath.  "This may turn to ice or sleet before the 

night's over," Brad said anxiously. "Then watch the cars pile up!"  "It's almost cold enough for 

sleet," Dan agreed with a shiver. "The storm certainly rolled in fast. Maybe Sam Hatfield decided 

to call off the Cub meeting."  Brad moved back against the building wall to escape the awning drip. 

"Not Sam," he said cheerfully. "He knows the Cubs are tough. Anyway, we're a little late. The 

others are probably at the church now, waiting for us."  From their shelter the two boys could see 

the church building a half block ahead, on the opposite side of the street.  The windows on the 

lower floor shone dimly through the wall of rain.  "The place is lighted, so Sam must be there at 

least," Brad commented. "Shall we go on now? We don't want to be late and hold up the meeting." 

"Okay," Dan agreed, buttoning his slicker which had pulled apart.  Heads low, they bored directly 

into the wind. The rain scarcely had slackened. Droplets dashed into their eyes, completely 

blinding them.  The boys were nearly opposite the church when Brad, who was ahead, ran full tilt 

into a man huddling against a building wall.  "I'm sorry," the boy apologized. "I didn't see you 

standing there."  "Watch where you're going next time!" the other growled.  Because the man 

spoke in such a surly tone, Brad looked him over carefully.  The     How does your garden grow? 

With silver bells and cockle-shells     And pretty maids all in a row!"   --Mother Goose.    MARY, 

Mistress Mary,     How does your garden grow?   From your uplands airy,   Mary, Mistress Mary, 

Float the chimes of faery     When the breezes blow!   Mary, Mistress Mary,     How does your 

garden grow?    With flower-maidens, singing     Among the morning hills--   With silvern bells a-

ringing,   With flower-maidens singing,   With vocal lilies, springing     By chanting daffodils;   With 

flower-maidens, singing     Among the morning hills!     THE TRIOLET    YOUR triolet should 

glimmer     Like a butterfly;   In golden light, or dimmer,   Your triolet should glimmer,   Tremble, 

turn, and shimmer,     Flash, and flutter by;   Your triolet should glimmer     Like a butterfly. 

FROM THE BRIDGE    HELD and thrilled by the vision     I stood, as the twilight died,   Where the 

great bridge soars like a song     Over the crawling tide--    Stood on the middle arch--     And night 

flooded in from the bay,   And wonderful under the stars     Before me the city lay;    Girdled with 

swinging waters--     Guarded by ship on ship--   A gem that the strong old ocean     Held in his 

giant grip;    There was play of shadows above     And drifting gleams below,   And magic of 

shifting waves     That darkle and glance and glow;    Dusky and purple and splendid,     Banded 

with loops of light,   The tall towers rose like pillars,     Lifting the dome of night;    The gliding cars 



of traffic     Slid swiftly up and down   Like monsters, fiery mailed,     Leaping across the town. 

Not planned with a thought of beauty;     Built by a lawless breed;   Builded of lust for power, 

Builded of gold and greed.    Risen out of the trader's     Brutal and sordid wars--   And yet, behold! 

a city     Wonderful under the stars!     "PALADINS, PALADINS, YOUTH NOBLE-HEARTED" 

GALAHADS, Galahads, Percivals, gallop!   Bayards, to the saddle!--the clangorous trumpets, 

Hoarse with their ecstasy, call to the mellay.   Paladins, Paladins, Rolands flame-hearted, 

Olivers, Olivers, follow the bugles!    Girt with the glory and glamor of power,   Error sits throned in 

the high place of justice;   Paladins, Paladins, youth noble-hearted,   Saddle and spear, for the 

battle-flags beckon!   Thrust the keen steel through the throat of the liar.    Star (or San Grael) that 

illumines thy pathway,   Follow it, follow that far Ideal!--   Thine not the guerdon to gain it or grasp 

it;   Soul of thee, passing, ascendeth unto it,   Augmenting its brightness for them that come 

after.    Heed then the 


_
snap-brim hat which dripped rain, appeared shadowy and unfriendly. He might have been thirty 

years of age, maybe older. A day-old beard made it difficult to judge.  "Sorry," Brad apologized 

again.  He and Dan started on, only to be stopped in their tracks by a question.  "Hey, kids," the 

stranger addressed them, "what's going on over there?"  "Over where?" demanded Dan.  "In that 

church. It's lighted up like a Christmas tree."  "Oh, just a Cub meeting," Dan explained briefly. 

Again he and Brad tried to move away, but the stranger more or less blocked the street.  "A Cub 

meeting?" the man echoed. "What's that?"  Brad had a feeling that the stranger in asking such a 

stupid question was stalling for time. He seemed to be looking over the two boys, studying them. 

"It's the younger boy program of the Boy Scouts of America," Brad explained briefly. "We have a 

whale of a lot of fun."  "But what's the church doing all lighted up?"  "Dan told you," Brad said 

patiently. "The Cubs are having their monthly meeting."  His answer still did not satisfy the 

stranger. "But the church has been closed, hasn't it?" he mumbled.  "That's right." Brad began to 

edge away for he resented the delay.  "The church was closed nearly a month while repairs were 

made on the heating system," Dan added. "Now the work is finished, so services will be held 

again."  Muttering something, the stranger turned and slouched off in the rain.  "Queer duck," Brad 

commented as he and Dan started to cross the flooded street. "What did he mumble?"  "I'm not 

sure I caught it right. I thought he said: 'A fine thing!'"  "Must be a screwball, Dan. Somehow I 

didn't like his appearance."  "Same here. His eyes were so intent they gave me the creeps. 

Wonder why he was interested in the church anyhow?"  "Oh, idle curiosity, I suppose. You didn't 

know him?"  "Never clapped eyes on him before," Dan replied, leaping over a river of gutter flow. 

"He must be new in Webster City."  The boys had reached the vestibule of the church.  Brad 

pulled open the heavy double doors and they went in out of the rain. Shaking out their slickers, 

they hung them up before entering the main part of the church.  The room smelled of fresh paint 

and seemed rather cold. Lights were on, however.  Hearing voices, Brad and Dan tramped on 

back to a small meeting chamber in the rear of the building.  All of the Cubs had gathered there--

Chips Davis, Midge Holloway, Red Suell, Fred Hatfield, and Babe Bunning, the youngest addition 

to the Den.    Hoarse with the fervor, the frenzy of battle,--   Paladins, Paladins, saddle! to saddle! 

Bide not, abide not, God's bugles are calling!--   Thrust the sharp sword through the heart of the 

liar.     "MY LANDS, NOT THINE"    MY lands, not thine, we look upon,   Friend Croesus, hill and 

vale and lawn.     Mine every woodland madrigal,     And mine thy singing waterfall   That vaguely 

hints of Helicon.    Mark how thine upland slopes have drawn   A golden glory from the dawn!-- 

_Fool's gold?_--thy dullness proves them all       My lands--not thine!    For when all title-deeds are 

gone,   Still, still will satyr, nymph, and faun     Through brake and covert pipe and call     In dances 

bold and bacchanal--   For them, for me, you hold in pawn,       My lands--not thine!     TO A 

DANCING DOLL    FORMAL, quaint, precise, and trim,     You begin your steps demurely-- 

There's a spirit almost prim     In the feet that move so surely,   So discreetly, to the chime   Of the 

music that so sweetly                     Marks the time.    But the chords begin to tinkle 

Quicker,   And your feet they flash and flicker--                     Twinkle!--   Flash and flutter to a 

tricksy                     Fickle meter;   And you foot it like a pixie--                     Only fleeter!    Now our 

current, dowdy                     Things--    "Turkey-trots" and rowdy                     Flings--   For they 

made you overseas   In politer times than these,   In an age when grace could please, 

Ere St. Vitus   Clutched and shook us, spine and knees;--     Loosed a plague of jerks to smite us! 



Well, our day is far more brisk     And our manner rather slacker),   And you are nothing more than 

bisque                     And lacquer--   But you shame us with the graces   Of courtlier times and 

places                     When the cheap   And vulgar wasn't "art"--     When the faunal prance and 

leap                     Weren't "smart."    Have we lost the trick of wedding                     Grace to 

pleasure?   Must we clown it at the bidding     Of some tawdry, common measure?    Can't you 

school us in the graces   Of your pose and dainty paces?--   Now the chords begin to tinkle 

Quicker--   And your feet they flash and flicker--                     Twinkle!--   And you mock us as you 

featly     Swing and flutter to the chime   Of the music-box that sweetly                     Marks the time! 

LOWER NEW YORK--A 


_
birthday.  Because he was the youngest Cub in the Den the fellows made it a little tough for him, 

calling him Babe Bunning instead of his real name.  Babe didn't like to be kidded, but he was 

game--all the Cubs admitted that.  "Say, we thought you guys weren't coming," Chips greeted 

Brad and Dan. "How'd you get here anyhow?"  "On a raft," Dan bantered. "Hit a lamppost on Main 

Street and had to swim the rest of the way."  "Oh, go on!" Chips laughed. "I guess the storm's let 

up."  "Like fun it has," Dan corrected. "Look at the rain sluicing down those windows."  Sam 

Hatfield, the assistant Cub leader, seemed unconcerned about the storm. He told the boys he had 

his car parked at the rear of the church. If the rain failed to let up before the meeting ended, he 

planned to take everyone home.  "And now let's forget the storm and get down to business," he 

said, calling the meeting to order. "We have some important matters to take up tonight."  To stir 

their blood and start the session off, the boys gave the Cub yell.  Like healthy young wolves, they 

howled in unison: "A-h-h-kay Iaa! W-e-e-l d-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-r Best!"  "And that's exactly what I hope 

we'll do in the job that's ahead of us--our best," Mr. Hatfield emphasized as the room became 

quiet again. "You fellows know why I called you here tonight?"  "It's something about the church 

building fund, isn't it?" Midge Holloway recalled. He had heard his father, one of the Den "Dads" 

mention the matter at home.  "That's right," Mr. Hatfield agreed. "As everyone knows, we need a 

new church or, at the very least, another wing. Now that temporary repairs have    WHITE wing'd 

below the darkling clouds     The driven sea-gulls wheel;   The roused sea flings a storm against 

The towers of stone and steel.    The very voice of ocean rings     Along the shaken street--   Dusk, 

storm, and beauty whelm the world     Where sea and city meet--    But what care they for flashing 

wings,     Quick beauty, loud refrain,   These huddled thousands, deaf and blind     To all but greed 

and gain?     AT SUNSET    THE sun-god stooped from out the sky     To kiss the flushing sea, 

While all the winds of all the world     Made jovial melody;   The night came hurrying up to hide 

The lovers with her tent;   The governed thunders, rank on rank,     Stood mute with wonderment; 

The pale worn moon, a jealous shade,     Peered from the firmament;   The early stars, the curious 

stars,     Came peering forth to see   What mighty nuptials shook the world     With such an 

ecstasy   Whenas the sun-god left the sky     To mingle with the sea.     A CHRISTMAS GIFT 

ALACK-A-DAY for poverty!   What jewels my mind doth give to thee!    Carved agate stone 

porphyrogene,   Green emerald and beryl green,   Deep sapphine and pale amethyst,   Sly opal, 

cloaking with a mist   The levin of its love elate,   Shy brides' pearls, flushed and delicate,   Sea-

colored lapis lazuli,   Sardonyx and chalcedony,   Enkindling diamond, candid gold,   Red rubies 

and red garnets bold:   And all their humors should be blent     In one intolerable blaze,   Barbaric, 

fierce, and opulent,     To dazzle him that dared to gaze!    Alack-a-day for poverty:   My rhymes 

are all you get of me!   Yet, if your 


_
crying need, though, is for a new building."  "A campaign is under way to raise funds, isn't it?" Brad 

remarked, for Mr. Hatfield had discussed the matter with him.  "Yes, Brad. The church trustees 

have asked the Cub Scouts to pitch in and help. What do you say, fellows?"  "How much will we 

have to raise?" Chips asked, running a hand through his short-cropped hair.  "No definite sum has 

been   The worthless words are set in gold.     SILVIA    I STILL remember how she moved 

Among the rathe, wild blooms she loved,   (When Spring came tip-toe down the slopes,   Atremble

flowers into full festival,   And chid them with this madrigal:    _"The busy spider hangs the brush
