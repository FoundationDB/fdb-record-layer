ribbons of roads up to the battle.  When the battle ceases, of course, that=
 organization will depart.=20

But always democracy will know that it can organize, that it can rise to a =
divine dignity of courage=20

and sacrifice. And that knowledge is the great salvage of this war. More th=
an written laws, more=20

than justice established, more than wrongs righted in any nation, and in al=

knowledge of this latent power of men!     CHAPTER IX  IN WHICH WE RETURN T=
O "THE LAND=20

OF THE FREE"   We found when we were leaving England another of those curio=
us contrasts=20

between the nations of the earth that one meets in a long journey. Coming i=
nto Bordeaux we were=20

convoyed for three hours by a ratty little French destroyer and a big dirig=
ible French balloon.=20

Leaving Liverpool, we lay two nights and a day sealed in the harbour, and t=
hen sailed out with the=20

Arabic, the Mongolian, the Victorian, and two freighters, amid a whole floc=
k of cruisers and=20

destroyers. The protecting fleet stayed with us two nights and three days. =
On the French boat the=20

barber practically had no news of sudden deaths and hairbreadth escapes whi=
ch had happened=20

while we slept. We sailed into the Gironde River peacefully, almost joyousl=
y. But we left the=20

Mersey with a story that a big fleet of destroyers hovered at the river's m=
outh; that the Belgic had=20

been beached out there on a shoal by a "sub," and that we would be lucky if=
 our throats were not=20

cut in the water as we tried to swim ashore after we had been blown out of =
our boats.  The French=20

certainly are more casual than the English. But then, the Germans have sunk=
 virtually no=20

vegetable substances which form part of our nourishment. It is not the same=
 with man as with=20

animated beings placed lower in the scale of organization. In the former, a=
ssimilation is exerted=20

only on those substances that enter essentially into the composition of the=
 bones, the muscles,=20

and the medullary matter of the nerves and the brain. Plants, on the contra=
ry, draw from the soil=20

the salts that are found accidentally mixed in it; and their fibrous textur=
e varies according to the=20

nature of the earths that predominate in the spots which they inhabit. An o=
bject well worthy of=20

research, and which has long fixed my attention, is the small number of sim=
ple substances (earthy=20

and metallic) that enter into the composition of animated beings, and which=
 alone appear fitted to=20

maintain what we may call the chemical movement of vitality.  We must not c=

by want of nutrition, and=20

by other pathologic causes. The sensation of hunger ceases long before dige=
stion takes place, or=20

the chyme is converted into chyle. It ceases either by a nervous and tonic =
impression exerted by=20

the aliments on the coats of the stomach; or, because the digestive apparat=

substances that excite the mucous membranes to an abundant secretion of the=
 gastric juice. To=20

this tonic impression on the nerves of the stomach the prompt and salutary =
effects of what are=20

called nutritive medicaments may be attributed, such as chocolate, and ever=

_
liner is the favourite food of von Tirpetz! They even showed us his teeth m=
arks on our American=20

liner, the New York. On an earlier trip during the summer of 1917 the boat =
had been torpedoed=20

when Admiral Sims was a passenger, going to England. The Admiral was sittin=
g at dinner when=20

the explosion occurred and the force of it threw him to the high ceiling of=
 the dining saloon! At least=20

that's what they told us. Caution and conflicting doubts, "fears within and=
 foes without," were not=20

so unreasonable as one might fancy, coming out of any British port.  But to=
 Henry and me the=20

greatest contrast came, not in the conduct of the ship's officers, as compa=
red with the French=20

seamen, but in the ship's company, going to war and coming away from it. We=
 went with youth;=20

the Espagne was crowded with young men going to war, with young women going=
 out to serve=20

those who were salvaging the waste of war. The boat carried a score of love=
rs--some married,=20

some impromptu, some incidental and fleeting, but all vastly interesting. F=
or when the new wine=20

blooms the old ferments, and stumbling over the dark decks at night on the =
Espagne, we were=20

forever running into youth paired off and gazing at the mystery of the ocea=
n and the stars. So the=20

corks were always popping in our old hearts; and we enjoyed it. But we pace=
d the black night=20

decks of the New York as "one who treads alone a banquet hall deserted." We=
 were among the=20

younger people on the ship. There was no youth to play with under thirty! N=
o one touched the=20

piano. No one lifted his voice in song. The most devilish thing going as we=
 sailed was a game of=20

chess! There was a night game of whist or cribbage or some other sedentary =
game, which closed=20

at ten, and after that in the library the talk sagged and died like a decom=
posed chord in a=20

Tschaikovsky symphony! It was sad! One had to go to the smoking room where =
there was wassail=20

on lemon squash and insipid English beer until after midnight. But there th=
e talk was good. Of=20

course it sometimes bore a strong smell of man about it, but it was virile =
and wise. A rug dealer=20

from Odessa, a dealer in mining machinery from Moscow, a Chicago college pr=
ofesser returning=20

from Petrograd, a cigarette maker from Egypt, a brace of British naval offi=
cers going over to return=20

with Canadian transports, an American aerial engineer, back from an inspect=
ion trip to France, a=20

great English actor, who once played Romeo with Mary Andersen--to give one =
an approximate of=20

his age--a Red Cross commission from Italy, and an Australian premier. The =
whole ship's=20

company was but thirty-four first class and of these but six were women. It=
 was no place for=20

dashing young blades in their late forties like Henry and me.  As the hour =
for leaving the ship=20

approached, the press of the splendid months behind us drew Henry and me to=
gether more and=20

more. We were hanging over the deck rail looking at a faint attempt at a cl=
oudy sunset at the end=20

of our last day out. We fell to talking of the love affairs on the Espagne,=
 and perhaps from me=20

came some words about the Eager Soul, the Gilded Youth and the Young Doctor=
. Henry looked=20

up dazed and anxious. Clearly he did not know what it was all about.  "Who =
was this Gilded=20

Youth?" asked Henry.  "He was the dream we dreamed when we were boys, Henry=
. When fate set=20

you out as a book agent on the highway and me to kicking a Peerless job pre=
ss in a dingy printing=20

office. The Gilded Youth was all we would fain have been!"  "And the Eager =
Soul?" quoth he.=20

undergoes. Opium, which is not nutritive, is employed with success in Asia,=
 in times of great=20

scarcity; it acts as a tonic. But when the matter which fills the stomach c=
an be regarded neither as=20

an aliment, that is, as proper to be assimilated, nor as a tonic stimulatin=
g the nerves, the cessation=20

of hunger is probably owing only to the secretion of the gastric juice. We =
here touch upon a=20

problem of physiology which has not been sufficiently investigated. Hunger =
is appeased, the=20



painful feeling of inanition ceases, when the stomach is filled. It is said=
 that this viscus stands in=20

need of ballast; and every language furnishes figurative expressions which =
convey the idea that a=20

mechanical distension of the stomach causes an agreeable sensation. Recent =
works of physiology=20

still speak of the painful contraction which the stomach experiences during=
 hunger, the friction of=20

its sides against one another, and the action of the gastric juice on the t=
exture of the digestive=20

apparatus. The observations of Bichat, and more particularly the fine exper=
iments of Majendie, are=20

in contradiction to these superannuated hypotheses. After twenty-four, fort=
y-eight, or even sixty=20

hours of abstinence, no contraction of the stomach is observed; it is only =
on the fourth or fifth day=20

that this organ appears to change in a small degree its dimensions. The qua=
ntity of the gastric=20

juice diminishes with the duration of abstinence. It is probable that this =
juice, far from=20

accumulating, is digested as an alimentary substance. If a cat or dog be ma=
de to swallow a=20

substance which is not susceptible of being digested, a pebble for instance=
, a mucous and acid=20

liquid is formed abundantly in the cavity of the stomach, somewhat resembli=
ng in its composition=20

the gastric juice of the human body. It appears to me very probable, that w=
hen the want of=20

aliments compels the Ottomacs and the inhabitants of New Caledonia to swall=
ow clay and steatite=20

during a part of the year, these earths occasion a powerful secretion of th=
e gastric and pancreatic=20

juices in the digestive apparatus of these people. The observations which I=
 made on the banks of=20

the Orinoco, have been recently confirmed by the direct experiments of two =
distinguished young=20

physiologists, MM. Cloquet and Breschet. After long fasting they ate as muc=
h as five ounces of a=20

silvery green and very flexible laminar talc. Their hunger was completely s=
atisfied, and they felt no=20

inconvenience from a kind of food to which their organs were unaccustomed. =
It is known that great=20

use is still made in the East of the bolar and sigillated earths of Lemnos,=
 which are clay mingled=20

with oxide of iron. In Germany the workmen employed in the quarries of sand=
stone worked at the=20

mountain of Kiffhauser spread a very fine clay upon their bread, instead of=
 butter, which they call=20

steinbutter* (stone-butter). (* This steinbutter must not be confounded wit=
h the mountain butter=20

(bergbutter) which is a saline substance, produced by a decomposition of al=
uminous schists.)  The=20

state of perfect health enjoyed by the Ottomacs during the time when they u=
se little muscular=20

exercise, and are subjected to so extraordinary a regimen, is a phenomenon =
difficult to be=20

explained. It can be attributed only to a habit prolonged from generation t=
o generation. The=20

structure of the digestive apparatus differs much in animals that feed excl=
usively on flesh or on=20

seeds; it is even probable that the gastric juice changes its nature, accor=
ding as it is employed in=20

"She, dearly beloved, was the ideal of our boyish hearts. Did you ever have=
 a red-headed=20

sweetheart in those olden golden days, Henry?" He shook a sad head in retro=
spection. "Nor did=20

one ever come to me. But most boys want one sometime, so I took her off the=
 Red Cross Posters=20

and breathed the breath of life into her. And isn't she a peach; and doesn'=

heart and make up for the hardship of your youth?" He smiled assent and ask=

or stimulating substances=20
