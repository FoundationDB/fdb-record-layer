hotel, along the esplanade, and up a steep incline to the Villa Bleue. The =
hospitable little=20

parsonage seemed an exact materialization of the personality of its owners.=
 Canon and Mrs. Clark=20

were both small and smiling and charitable and particularly kind, and their=
 tiny unpretentious=20

dwelling, with its sunny aspect and its flowers and its pet birds, was abso=
lutely in keeping with=20

their tone of mind. From some houses seem to emanate certain mental atmosph=
eres, as if they=20

reflected the sum total of the thoughts that have collected there, and sens=
itive visitors receive=20

subconscious impressions of chilly magnificence, intellectual activity or a=
 spirit of general=20

tolerance.  The Villa Bleue always felt radiant with kind and cheery impuls=
es, and its flower-

covered walls seemed almost to shine as the girls, secure of a welcome, par=
ted from Miss=20

Brewster, and ran up the steps to the pleasant veranda. Mrs. Clark made the=

She had six cosy basket-chairs waiting for them, and a plateful of most del=
icious almond=20

 serpentine. Near the=20

village of San Juan, the granular diabasis appears alone uncovered, and tak=
es a greenish black=20

hue. The feldspar intimately mixed with the mass, may be separated into dis=
tinct crystals. The=20

mica is very rare, and there is no quartz. The mass assumes at the surface =
a yellowish crust like=20

dolerite and basalt.  In the midst of this tract of trap-formation, the Mor=
ros of San Juan rise like two=20

castles in ruins. They appear linked to the mornes of St. Sebastian, and to=
 La Galera which=20

bounds the Llanos like a rocky wall. The Morros of San Juan are formed of l=
imestone of a=20

crystalline texture; sometimes very compact, sometimes spongy, of a greenis=
h-grey, shining,=20

composed of small grains, and mixed with scattered spangles of mica. This l=
imestone yields a=20

strong effervescence with acids. I could not find in it any vestige of orga=
nized bodies. It contains in=20
