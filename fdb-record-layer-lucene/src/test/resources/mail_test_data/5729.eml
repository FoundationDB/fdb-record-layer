development of the physical capabilities of a country before we can expect =
from its inhabitants=20

sufficient mental vigour to receive and understand the truths of our religi=

Christian missionaries, of various and conflicting creeds, who have fruitle=

Christianity upon the barren soil of Africa; but their labours were ill-tim=
ed, they were too early in=20

it until there be some=20

foundation for a superstructure. Raise the level of the waters, and change =
the character of the=20

surrounding deserts: this will also raise the intellectual condition of the=
 inhabitants by an=20

improvement in the natural conditions of their country. . . . . . .  The fi=
rst portion of our task was=20

completed. We had visited all the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia, including =
the great Blue Nile that=20

had been traced to its source by Bruce. The difficult task still lay watchi=
ng his opportunity to make=20

a dash at him, but the appearance of a policeman put a sudden termination t=
o the riot by inducing=20

the Bloater and Little Jim to shoulder their brooms and fly.  Mr Sparks, sm=
iling grimly, (he never=20

smiled otherwise), thrust his hands into his pockets, resumed his cheroot, =
and held on the even=20

tenor of his way.  But he had not yet done with the Bloater.  That volatile=
 and revengeful youth,=20

having run on in advance, ensconced himself behind a projection at the corn=
er of the street close=20

to which Sparks had to pass, and from that point of vantage suddenly shot i=
nto his ear a yell so=20

excruciating that it caused the man to start and stagger off the pavement; =
before he could recover=20

himself, his tormentor had doubled round the corner and vanished.  Growling=
 savagely, he=20

continued his walk.  One of the turns to the left, which he had to make, le=
d him through a dark and=20

narrow street.  Here, keeping carefully in the middle of the road for secur=

their road from=20

 equator, and perhaps=20

however, in his expectations.  The Bloater happened to know of a long ladde=
