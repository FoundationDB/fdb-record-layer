  The second wolf-like step, pushed open the door and put his head close to=
 the chink.  There was a dispute among the guards.  "I tell you," one of th=
em was saying, "that if Coysel predicted that, 'tis as good as true; I know=
 nothing about it, but I have heard say that he's not _
in _Phaedrus_:       Being _initiated_ in those _Mysteries_, which it is la=
wful to call     the most=20

blessed of all mysteries ... we were freed from the     molestations of evi=
ls, which otherwise await=20

us in a future period     of time. Likewise in consequence of this divine _=
initiation_, we     became=20

spectators of entire, simple, immoveable, and blessed     visions, resident=
 in a pure light.(526)=20

This veiled confession shows that the Initiates enjoyed Theophany--saw visi=
ons of Gods and of=20

real immortal Spirits. As Taylor correctly infers:       The most sublime p=
art of the _epopteia_ or=20

final revealing,     consisted in beholding the Gods [the high Planetary Sp=
irits]     themselves,=20

invested with a resplendent light.(527)   The statement of Proclus upon the=
 subject is unequivocal:=20

In all the Initiations and Mysteries, the Gods  "Raoul, we set out to-night=
 for Paris."  "Eh?" cried the=20

young man, turning pale.  "You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Mad=
ame de Saint-

Remy. I shall wait for you here till seven."  The young man bent low, with =
an expression of sorrow=20

and gratitude mingled, and retired in order to saddle his horse.  As to D'A=
rtagnan, scarcely, on his=20

side, was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter, which he r=
ead over again:  "Return=20

immediately to Paris.--J. M----."  "The epistle is laconic," said D'Artagna=
n; "and if there had not=20

been a postscript, probably I should not have understood it; but happily th=
ere is a postscript."  And=20

he read that welcome postscript, which made him forget the abruptness of th=
e letter.  "P. S.--Go to=20

the king's treasurer, at Blois; tell him your name and show him this letter=
; you will receive two=20

hundred=20


_
of themselves, and appear in a variety of shapes; and sometimes     indeed =
a formless light of=20

themselves is held forth to the view;     sometimes this light is according=
 _to a human form_ and=20

sometimes     it proceeds into a different shape.(528)   Again we have     =
  Whatever is on earth is=20

the resemblance and shadow of something     that is in the sphere, while th=
at resplendent thing=20

[the prototype     of the Soul-Spirit] remaineth in _unchangeable_ conditio=
n, it is     well also with its=20

shadow. When that resplendent one removeth far      "Assuredly," said D'Art=
agnan, "I admire this=20

piece of prose. The cardinal writes better than I thought. Come, Planchet, =
let us pay a visit to the=20

king's treasurer and then set off."  "Toward Paris, sir?"  "Toward Paris." =
 And they set out at as=20

hard a canter as their horses could maintain.     16. The Duc de Beaufort. =
  The circumstances that=20

had hastened the return of D'Artagnan to Paris were as follows:  One evenin=
g, when Mazarin,=20

according to custom, went to visit the queen, in passing the guard-chamber =
he heard loud voices;=20
