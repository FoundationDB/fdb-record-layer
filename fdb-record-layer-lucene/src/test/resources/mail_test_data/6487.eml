There are other stone rows near, all of which have been partially despoiled=
, but less so than=20

elsewhere; the mystery of their significance remains unsolved. Ugborough Be=
acon and Butterton=20

Hill, both about 1200 feet in height, stand like southern sentinels of the =
moorland to the east of=20

Harford. On the slopes of Sharp Tor is a stunted wood, very like Wistman's.=
  Westward, near=20

Cornwood, is the ravine of the River Yealm, known as Awns and Dendles, whic=
h it is best not to=20

visit on Plymouth's early-closing day or on Bank Holidays. It is a pity tha=
t popularity should mean=20

vulgarizing, for it is right that every lovely spot should be accessible to=
 the greatest possible=20

number of those who can appreciate it. The qualification is an important on=
e; nothing is gained by=20

the thronging to such scenes of those whose tastes are best met by entertai=
nment pavilions and=20

roundabouts. Besides which, the conscienceless tripper is a terror to all w=
ho love ferns, and there=20

are still some rarities to be found in the Yealm valley.  Near Cornwood is =
Fardell, once a manor of=20

the Raleighs; and though Sir Walter was not born here he undoubtedly paid t=
he spot many visits.=20

The place is also interesting because of a stone discovered here, bearing O=
gham inscriptions=20

supposed to prove the extent of the Irish invasion somewhere about the sixt=
h century, when=20

Devon and Cornwall were overrun by saints and chieftains from the green isl=
and. There are a=20

number of attractive manor houses in this part of the moorland's fringe, to=
gether with some fine=20

heights, such as Pen Beacon and Shell Tor, rising to about 1500 feet. But t=
here is no particular=20

charm in the china-clay works of Lee Moor--an industry which may be studied=
 on a larger scale in=20

the St. Austell district of Cornwall. China-clay, yielding a little, she pu=
t a heavier strain on him, and=20

began to reel up.  It was very well done, and without a word of admonition;=
 for Ronald was proud=20

of his pupil, and wished to show that he could leave her to herself.  By an=
d by the fish began to=20

show himself a little more amenable, and preparations were made for receivi=
ng him on shore.=20

Miss Carry stepped back a few yards; her father got out of the way altogeth=
er; Ronald crouched=20

down, clip in hand.  Of course, when the salmon found himself being guided =
into the shallows, he=20

was off like a bolt; and again and again he repeated these sullen rushes; b=
ut each time they were=20

growing weaker; and at last, as the gleam of something white showed in the =
water, Ronald made a=20

sudden plunge with the clip--and the salmon was ashore.  He laughed.  'I su=
ppose this will be my=20

last day on the loch, and a very good finish it is.'  The men brought along=
 the other fish, and these=20

were all laid out on the grass side by side, though it was now too dark to =
see much of them.  As=20

regards the three salmon, Mr. Hodson's, on being accurately weighed, was fo=
und to be sixteen=20

and a half pounds, Miss Carry's two respectively fourteen pounds and eleven=
 pounds.  She was a=20

very happy young woman as she walked home with her father and Ronald throug=
h the now rapidly=20

gathering dusk.  His last day on the lake:--well, it would be something ple=
asant to look back upon=20

in after times--the summer-like weather, the still water, the silent and su=
nlit crags and woods and=20

bays.  And perhaps, too, he would remember something of her bright society,=
 her friendly=20

disposition, and the frank good-comradeship with which she shared her meal =
of milk and bread=20

with two common boatmen.  Nay, he could not well help remembering that--and=

 in this respect china-

 It was to be his last gift=20

perhaps it was this very=20

had to come uncalled-for; it was not of his summoning.  And now, in this ho=
