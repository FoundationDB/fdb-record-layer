Manifestly he must see Blenkinsop and caution him.  Breakfast over, he walked, by the longest way around, to his office in the Temple Court, hoping to find proved to be a robber and a villain. Her son Louis had discovered his character long before she did, and, after fighting a long and severe battle, had driven him away, recovering a large sum of money he had _
pinched. They was afraid I'd come here and squeal to you!"  Blount stopped him with an impatient 

gesture. "Let that part of it rest and get down to business. What you have been telling me may be 

true, but I can't do anything on your bare word--the word of a man who is dodging the police. 

You've got to bring me proofs in black and white; lists of the faked names, and a straight-out give-

away of how they are to be used; names and dates, and a written story of your bargainings with 

the men higher up. This is Thursday; to be of any use, these documents would have to be in my 

hands by Saturday noon, at the latest. You know best whether the thing can be done in time--or 

done at all. What do you say?"  For a little time Gryson said nothing. When he spoke it was 

evident that the lust for vengeance and a guilty conscience were fighting an even-handed battle. 

"I could get the affidavits--maybe," he said. "There's a dozen 'r more of the cullies down-along got 

their notice to fade away when I got mine, and they'd jump at th' chance to get back at the bosses. 

But f'r Gawd's sake, look at what it means to me! Anny minute I'm on the job I'd be lookin' to see 

some bull with a star on 'im holdin' a gun on me; and after that, it's this f'r mine"--with a jerk of the 

head and a pantomimic gesture simulating the hangman's knot under his ear.  "That is your risk," 

said Blount coldly, making this small concession to the expiring sense of uprightness. "You know 

how badly you want to 'get square,' as you put it, and I am interested only in the results. If you get 

caught, I sha'n't turn my hand over to help you--you can take that straight. But if you show up here 

with the proofs, proofs that I can use, any time before Saturday night, I'll undertake to see that you 

get safely out of the State."  It was in the little pause which followed that some one in the corridor 

rapped smartly on the locked door. At the sound, Gryson collapsed and his face became an ashen 

mask of fear. Blount, the law-abiding, might have hesitated, but this newer Blount had slain his 

scruples. Snatching Gryson out of his chair, he thrust him silently through the half-open door of the 

work-room, and a moment they seen the owner who was making the cruise in her? They had. He 

was a man thirty or thirty-two, with a fine black beard, and a lady had said he was a remarkably 

handsome man. His informant thought he was a foreigner, though he spoke English as fluently as 

the officers of the garrison. He was dressed in the latest style of European garments when he 

came on shore, and the Parsee had been unable to form an opinion in regard to his nationality. 

The carpenter of the Guardian-Mother had constructed something like a magazine in the hold of 

the ship for the ammunition which had been taken on board before she sailed. It was large enough 

for the new supply, though some further precautions were taken for the safety of the contents. The 

four twenty-four pounders were placed, two forward and two aft, the former on the forecastle, and 

the latter in the space on deck abaft the boudoir.  The guns were mounted on naval carriages, and 

portholes were to be prepared on the passage to India. The two twelve-pounders were to remain 

on the top-gallant forecastle, where they had always been; though they had been used on the 

Fourth of July, and for saluting purposes only, except in the Archipelago, where they had done 

more serious work, and had doubtless saved Miss Blanche and Louis from capture.  The 

commander sincerely hoped there would never be an occasion to make use of either the old or the 

new guns, for he was eminently a man of peace; but he was prepared to defend his ship, either 

from pirates, belligerent natives, or Captain Mazagan when he had recovered from his wound. 

Probably he would not have thought of such a thing as increasing his means of defence if 

Mazagan had not followed the ship as far as Suez.  After he had looked over the white steam-

yacht which lay beyond the British steamer as well as he could, and gathered all the information in 



regard to her and her commander, he could not help thinking of the last threats of Mazagan. He 

had been assured that Ali-Noury Pacha was as vindictive as ever, and that he had long before 

ordered a new steamer to be built for him. Did the white steam-yacht belong to him?  Mazagan, 

evidently for the want of care, had irritated his 


_
the corridor entrance, opening the door and calmly facing the two policemen on the threshold. 

"Well?" he said brusquely.  One of the men touched his helmet.  "We're looking for a felly that 

ducked in below a couple of hours ago, Mr. Blount. He's in the building, somewheres, and your 

office being lighted, we thought maybe you'd--"  Blount threw the door wide.  "You can see for 

yourselves," he said. "Would you like to come in and look around?"  "Sure not; your word's as 

good as the search, Mr. Blount. 'Twas only on the chance that he might have faked an excuse and 

ducked in on you to be out of reach."  Blount left the door open and went to get his coat and hat. 

"Who is the man?" he asked, while the officers lingered.  "A felly named Gryson. He's been 

working in the railroad shops what times he wasn't pullin' off something crooked in the p'litical 

line."  "What is he wanted for?" Blount was closing his desk and preparing to leave the office. 

"Croaking a bank watchman up in Montana afther he'd souped the vault door for a kick-shot."  "In 

that case, perhaps I'm lucky that he didn't drop in and croak me," laughed Blount, turning off the 

lights and joining the two men in the corridor. And then: "There is a back stair to the engine-room 

in the basement in the other wing of the building: have you been watching that?"  The bigger of the 

two policemen prodded the other in the ribs with his night-stick. "That's on us, Jakey. He'll have 

been gone hours ago. Let's be drilling. 'Tis a fine mind ye have, Mr. Blount, to be thinking of thim 

back stairs right off the bat." And the pair went down in the elevator with Blount, chuckling to 

themselves at their own discomfiture.  Having set his hand to the plough, Blount did nothing 

carelessly. Sauntering slowly, and even pausing to light a cigar, he trailed the two policemen until 

they were safely in another street. Then he turned back to the great office building and once more 

had himself lifted to the upper floor. In the office corridor he waited until the car had dropped out of 

sight; waited still longer to give the drowsy night-boy time to settle himself on his stool and go to 

sleep. Then he went swiftly to the door of the private room and unlocked it.  Gryson was ready, 

and even in the dim light of the corridor Blount could see that he was white-faced and trembling. In 

the silent faring to the stair which wound down in a spiral around the freight elevator Blount 

gripped the arm of trembling.  "You've got to get your nerve," he gritted savagely, "or you'll be 

nipped before you've gone a block!" And then: "Here's the stair: follow it down until you get to the 

basement. There's a coal entrance from the alley, and the engineer will be with his boilers in the 

other wing--and probably asleep. You've got it straight, have you? You're to bring the papers to my 

office on or before Saturday night. I'll be looking out for you, and if you bring me the evidence, 

you'll be taken care of. That's all. Down with you, now, and go quietly. If you're caught, I drop you 

like a hot nail; remember that."  Still puffing at the cigar which glowed redly in the darkness of the 

wing corridor, Blount waited until his man had been given time to reach the basement. Then he 

walked slowly back to the main corridor and descended by the public stair without awakening the 

elevator boy, who was sleeping soundly in his car on the ground level.  On the short walk to the 

hotel the full significance of the thing he had done had its innings. Cynical criticism to the contrary 

notwithstanding, there is now and then an honest lawyer who regards his oath of admission to the 

bar--the oath which binds him to uphold the cause of justice and fair dealing--as something more 

than a mere form of words. Beyond all question, an honest man who has sworn to uphold the law 

may neither connive at crime nor shield a criminal. Blount tried the shift of every man who has 

gone to the hospital at Suez. He could learn nothing in regard to him there; but it was entirely 

impossible that he could have come to Aden, for no steamer had passed the Guardian-Mother on 



her passage. The white steamer had no doubt come through the canal before her.  The 

commander could not solve the problem. He decided to "take the bull by the horns," and settle the 

question before he sailed the next day. He had dressed himself in his best uniform in the morning, 

and he decided to pay a visit to the white steam-yacht before he slept again. It was to be a visit of 

ceremony; and he ordered the crew of the barge to put on their clean white uniforms, for he 

intended to go in state.  All the passengers were still on shore, and there was no one to go with 

him if he had desired any company. He wished to inform the Pacha, if the owner proved to be he, 

and he was on board, that he was prepared for any and every thing. If His Highness attempted 

any trickery or treachery in the direction of the members of his party, or any one of them, he would 

blow the white steamer out of the water, even if she belonged to the Sultan of Morocco. In fact, he 

had worked himself up as much as he ever could into an angry frame of mind.  If he was waiting 

for Mazagan to come to Aden,--for the pirate must have written to him in regard to his intentions, if 

he had any,--the persecution of the Americans was to be continued over the Indian Ocean. He 

was to command this magnificent steamer, as he had the Fatime, and would be ready to retrieve 

his misfortunes in the past. But Captain Ringgold was "reckoning without his host."  He descended 

the gangway steps, and took his seat in the stern-sheets of the barge with compressed lips; for he 

intended to meet the Pacha face to face, and this time at his own instigation. Possibly his crew 

were physiognomists enough to wonder what had come over the captain; for they had never seen 

him when he looked more in earnest. The captain nodded at the cockswain, and the bowman 

shoved off. The crew gave way, and no boat ever presented a finer appearance.  "To the white 

steam-yacht beyond the P. and O. steamer," said the commander; and said no more.  The men 

bent to their oars, and they were soon in sight of the beautiful vessel, as everybody called her; and 

Captain Ringgold could not but indorse the general verdict; at least, he thought she was quite as 

handsome as the Guardian-Mother, which was enough to say of any vessel in his estimation. The 

barge made a landing at the platform of the gangway.  "May I be permitted to go on board?" asked 

the captain of the sailor who stood at the head of the steps.  "Yes, sir; she is open to ladies and 

gentlemen to-day," replied the man.  The commander ascended the steps to the bulwarks, where 

the seaman was evidently doing duty as a sentinel, though he was not armed.  "What steamer is 

this?" asked the visitor; for he had not yet seen the name of the steamer.  "The Blanche, sir," 

replied the man very respectfully; for the commander's uniform had made its proper impression. 

"The Blanche!" exclaimed the captain of the Guardian-Mother, starting back as though a red-hot 

shot had struck him.  [Illustration: "CAPTAIN RINGGOLD, I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU." Page 

337.]  It was very remarkable that the steamer should have that name; but he preserved his 

dignity, and concluded that the name had been given for some member of the owner's family; and 

he saw a lady seated near the rudder-head, who might be the owner of the name. He looked 

about the deck,--what of it could be seen,--though most of it was covered by the house, extended 

nearly from stem to stern, as on the Guardian-Mother. Everything was as neat and trim as though 

she had been a man-of-war. He could see two twelve-pounders on the side where he was; and he 

concluded there were two more on the other side.  But if this craft was to chase and annoy his 

party, she was 


_
told himself morosely that he had nothing to do with Gryson's past; that he had taken no retainer 

from the Montana authorities; that the criminal was merely a cog in a wheel which was grinding 

toward a righteous end, and as such should be permitted to serve his turn.  The well-worn 

argument is always specious to the beginner, and Blount thought he had sufficiently justified 

himself by the time he was pushing through the revolving doors into the Inter-Mountain lobby. But 

when he saw his father quietly smoking his bed-time cigar in one of the big leather-covered 

lounging-chairs, he realized that the first step had been taken in an exceedingly thorny path; that 

whatever else might be the outcome of the bargain with Thomas Gryson, a son was coldly plotting 

to bring disgrace and humiliation upon a father.  For this reason, and because, when all is said, 

blood is much thicker than water, Blount made as if he did not see the beckoning hand-wave from 

the depths of the big chair in the smokers' alcove; ignored it, and with set lips and burning eyes 

made for the nearest elevator to take refuge in his room.     XXIII  A CRY IN THE NIGHT.   With 

the critical election, a struggle which was to decide for another two-year period whether or not the 

people of the Sage-Brush State were to be the masters or the servants of chartered monopoly, 

only four days distant, the capital city took on the aspect of a stirring camp--two enough armed to 

be a match for his own ship; and with the feeling he had stirred up in his mind, he congratulated 

himself on the superiority of the ship he commanded. The seaman informed him that he was at 

liberty to look over the vessel, for it was believed to be the finest her celebrated builders had ever 

completed.  "I desire to see the captain of this steamer," replied Captain Ringgold, declining the 

permission extended to him.  "He is in his cabin, sir, and I will call him down," replied the man. 

The captain gave him his card, and the sailor mounted to the promenade deck. He had not been 

gone two minutes before the captain rushed down the steps as though he were in a desperate 

hurry.  "Captain Ringgold, I am delighted to see you!" shouted the captain of the Blanche before 

the visitor had time to make out who he was. "I am glad to see you on the deck of my ship!" And 

he extended his hand to the commander of the Guardian-Mother.  "Captain Sharp!" roared the 

visitor, seizing the offered hand, and warmly pressing it.  It was a tremendous let-down for him, 

after he had roused all his belligerent nature into action, to find Captain W. Penn Sharp in 

command of the suspicious steamer.     CHAPTER XXXV  GENERAL NEWRY'S MAGNIFICENT 

YACHT   The biography of Captain Penn Sharp had been quite romantic within the preceding 

year. In company with his brother he had been a detective in New York during the greater portion 


_
parties were in the Inter-Mountain Hotel--and each incoming train brought fresh relays of 

henchmen and district spellbinders to swell the sidewalk throngs and to crowd the lobbies.  On the 

Friday morning Blount awoke with the feeling that he had definitely cut himself off from all the 

commonplace activities of the campaign. There were two days of suspense to be outworn, and if 

he could have compassed it he would have been glad to efface himself completely. Since that was 

impossible, and since it seemed equally impossible that he should go on keeping up the farce of 

the _modus vivendi_ after he had taken honest and upright man; but in spite of this fact he had 

saved a competence for a man of small desires before he was fifty years old. He had never been 

married till the last year of his life.  He had what he called a "profession," and he had attended to it 

very closely for twenty years or more. When he "had a case to 'work up,'" he took it to his humble 

lodging with him, and studied out the problem. There was nothing in his room that could be called 

a luxury, unless a library of two hundred volumes were classed under that head; and he spent all 

his leisure time in this apartment, having absolutely no 


_
that of his father's accuser, he bought the morning papers hurriedly at the hotel news-stand and 

went down the avenue to get his breakfast at the railroad restaurant, where he would be 

measurably sure of isolation.  After giving his order he ran hastily through the local news in the 

papers. There was no mention of the arrest of one Thomas Gryson in any of the police notes, and 

he breathed freer. But in _The Plainsman_ there was an editorial which was vaguely disturbing. 

Blenkinsop, who wrote his own leaders, hinted pointedly at coming disclosures which would 

change the political map of the State for all time. Blount, trying to determine how much or how little 

the editorial was based upon his talk with the editor on the Wednesday night, found his omelet 

tasteless. Ready enough, as he was his money, which he had prudently invested.  In his younger 

days he had been to sea, and came home as the mate of a large ship when he was twenty-two. 

His prospects in the commercial marine were very promising; but his brother, believing he had 

peculiar talent for the occupation in which he was himself engaged, induced him to go into the 

business as his partner. He had been a success; but men do not live as he did, depriving himself 

of rest or recreation, without suffering for it. His health broke down.  Confident that a voyage at sea 

would build him up, he applied to Captain Ringgold for any place he could offer him. Only the 

position of quartermaster was available. He was glad to obtain this on board of such a steamer. 

He had told his story, and the commander needed just such a person. Mrs.
