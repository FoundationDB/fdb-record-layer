governing in his stead.  In response to the announcement of the Bishop's pr=
esence, the Governor=20

despatched his brother-in-law, who was a person of some authority, to welco=
me the Bishop,=20

instructing him to treat him in all respects with the highest consideration=
 and in case he wished to=20

come to Merida, to arrange everything necessary for his journey thither.  I=
t was decided to make=20

the journey by sea rather than by the more difficult overland route, and on=
e boat-load of friars=20

sailed, carrying a large part of the stores, which included vestments and a=
ltar plate and other=20

church furnishings.  Hardly were the preparations for the departure of the =
Bishop and the=20

remainder of his people completed, when the distressing news of the total l=
oss of this vessel and=20

its cargo reached them from Champoton, an Indian village, where the few sur=
vivors of the wreck=20

had found refuge. Nine friars and twenty-three other persons perished in th=
is disaster, the news of=20

which threw a heavy cloud of sadness over the little band of missionaries. =
 Thousands of miles=20

from their native land and in a new world, these men were sustained solely =
by their faith in their=20

mission and their confidence in the leadership of their venerable Bishop, f=
or they were not only cut=20

off from hope of succour but were exposed to the persecutions of their own =
countrymen, because=20

of their zeal for justice, in defending the oppressed against cupidity and =
cruelty.  Despite the many=20

causes for discouragement Las Casas decided, on the advice of the pilot of =
the ship that was to=20

carry them, to profit by the fair weather then prevailing, and set the exam=
ple to the others of going=20

first on board the vessel.  The friars followed in silence, and so entirely=
 were their thoughts given=20

to the premature fate of their lost comrades, that the whole of that night =
and the following day were=20

passed in silence and prayer: when the ship reached the place where the wre=
ck had occurred, the=20

prayers for the dead were solemnly recited by the tearful company.  This be=
coming tribute=20

rendered to the memory of the departed, Las Casas seated himself at table a=
nd, setting the others=20

a wholesome example, he began to eat, for until then no one had had the hea=
rt to touch food.  The=20

weather suddenly changed for the worse and a perilous Norther, which was th=
e greatest enemy of=20

navigation in those waters, sprang up, forcing the vessel to put in at the =
island of Terminos, where=20

some fragments of the wreck were found, but the sea had given up no dead. T=
hree days passed in=20

waiting for better weather, and though Las Casas desired to re-embark and c=
ontinue the voyage,=20

Fray Tomas that of any other human being."  At the door of her house Setche=
m came up with her=20

son's chariot. They saw each other, but both looked away, for they could no=
t meet affectionately,=20

and would not meet coldly.  As the horses outran the litter-bearers, the mo=
ther and son looked=20

round at each other, their eyes met, and each felt a stab in the heart.  In=
 the evening the pioneer,=20

after he had had an interview with the Regent, went to the temple of Seti t=
o receive Ameni's=20

blessing on all his undertakings.  Then, after sacrificing in the tomb of h=
is ancestors, he set out for=20

Syria.  Just as he was getting into his chariot, news was brought him that =
the mat-maker, who had=20

sawn through the masts at the gate, had been caught.  "Put out his eyes!"  =
he cried; and these=20

were the last words he spoke as he quitted his home.  Setchem looked after =
him for a long time;=20

she had refused to bid him farewell, and now she implored the Gods to turn =
his heart, and to=20

preserve him from malice and crime.     CHAPTER XXXI.  Three days had passe=
d since the=20

pioneer's departure, and although it was still early, busy occupation was a=
stir in Bent-Anat's work-

rooms.  The ladies had passed the stormy night, which had succeeded the exc=
iting evening of the=20

festival, without sleep.  Nefert felt tired and sleepy the next morning, an=
d begged the princess to=20



introduce her to her new duties for the first time next day; but the prince=
ss spoke to her=20

encouragingly, told her that no man should put off doing right till the mor=
row, and urged her to=20

follow her into her workshop.  "We must both come to different minds," said=
 she.  "I often shudder=20

involuntarily, and feel as if I bore a brand--as if I had a stain here on m=
y shoulder where it was=20

touched by Paaker's rough hand."  The first day of labor gave Nefert a good=
 many difficulties to=20

overcome; on the second day the work she had begun already had a charm for =
her, and by the=20

third she rejoiced in the little results of her care.  Bent-Anat had put he=
r in the right place, for she=20

had the direction of a large number of young girls and women, the daughters=
, wives, and widows=20

of those Thebans who were at the war, or who had fallen in the field, who s=
orted and arranged the=20

healing herbs.  Her helpers sat in little circles on the ground; in the mid=
st of each lay a great heap=20

of fresh and dry plants, and in front of each work-woman a number of parcel=
s of the selected=20

roots, leaves, and flowers.  An old physician presided over the whole, and =
had shown Nefert the=20

first day the particular plants which he needed.  The wife of Mena, who was=
 fond of flowers, had=20

soon learnt them all, and she taught willingly, for she loved children.  Sh=
e soon had favorites=20

among the children, and knew=20


_
was in favour of waiting for the shipwrecked people at Champoton to overtak=
e them, and then to=20

continue the journey overland.  This difference of opinion led to a divisio=
n of the company, the=20

Bishop re-embarking with Father Ladrada and a few of the others, while the =
majority were left to=20

follow the overland route.  The chief city of the diocese of Chiapa was Ciu=
dad Real, and the=20

Bishop, on his arrival, was accorded a warm welcome and was lodged in one o=
f the best houses in=20

the place, belonging to a Spaniard who was absent at that time, while the f=
riars were=20

accommodated in another, just industrious and careful, others as idle and h=
eedless:  "Ay! ay!"  she=20

exclaimed, bending over a little half-naked maiden with great almond-shaped=
 eyes.  "You are=20

mixing them all together.  Your father, as you tell me, is at the war.  Sup=
pose, now, an arrow were=20

to strike him, and this plant, which would hurt him, were laid on the burni=
ng wound instead of this=20

other, which would do him good--that would be very sad."  The child nodded =
her head, and looked=20

her work through again.  Nefert turned to a little idler, and said: "You ar=
e chattering again, and=20

doing nothing, and yet your father is in=20
