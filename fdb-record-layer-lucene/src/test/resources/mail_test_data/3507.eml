tion to the carriage driving. He tells with laughter how the slaves would "=
grab a piece of meat and bread and run to the field" as no time was allowed=
 to sit and eat breakfast. This was a very different way from that of the m=
aster he had before, as Mr. L'Angle was much better to his slaves.  Mr. Hal=

 thrown back into an isolation very marked, though tempered by her sympathy=
 with the Protestant party on the Continent. In later times the growth of E=

ages, some with two=20

wheels and some with four. She never heard of any money called "shin-plaste=

money-conscious during the war when Confederate currency was introduced. Wh=

were sick, they were given castor oil, turpentine and medicines made from v=

Negroes could enlist in the Southern army if they desired,] none of them wi=

preferred to join northern forces and fight for the thing they desired most=

was no longer a dream, but a reality, the Merritts started life on their ow=

ON   The life of=20

Florida Clayton is interesting in that it illustrates the miscegenation pre=
valent during the days of=20

slavery. Interesting also is the fact that unhappily was unable to invade: =
unhappily we say,=20

because if he had landed in England he would assuredly have there met his d=
oom; the Russian=20

campaign would have been antedated with a more complete result, and all the=
 after-pages in the=20

history of the Arch-Brigand would have been torn from the book of fate. Eng=
land is indebted for=20

her political liberties in great measure to the Teutonic character, but she=
 is also in no small=20

measure indebted to this immunity from invasion which has brought with it a=
 comparative immunity=20

from standing armies. In the Middle Ages the question between absolutism an=
d that baronial=20

liberty which was the germ and precursor of the popular liberty of after-ti=
mes turned in great=20

measure upon the relative strength of the national militia and of the bands=
 of mercenaries kept in=20

pay by overreaching kings. The bands of mercenaries brought over by John pr=
oved too strong for=20

the patriot barons, and would have annulled the Great Charter, had not nati=
onal liberty found a=20

timely and powerful, though sinister, auxiliary in the ambition of the Fren=
ch. Prince Charles I. had=20

no standing army, the troops taken into pay for the wars with Spain and Fra=
nce had been=20

disbanded before the outbreak of the Revolution; and on that occasion the n=
ation was able to=20

overthrow the tyranny without looking abroad for assistance. But Charles II=
. had=20


_
of those turbulent days. Many years before her birth--March 1, 1854--Florid=
a's great grandfather, a=20

white man, came to Tallahassee, Florida from Washington, District of Columb=
ia, with his children=20

whom he had by his Negro slave. On coming to Florida, he set all of his chi=
ldren free except one=20

boy, Amos, who was sold to a Major Ward. For what reason this was done, no =
one knew. Florida,=20

named for the state in which she was born, was one of seven children born t=
o Charlotte Morris=20

(colored) whose father was a white man and David Clayton (white).  Florida,=
 in a retrogressive=20

mood, can recall the "nigger hunters" and "nigger stealers" of her childhoo=
d days. Mr. Nimrod and=20

Mr. Shehee, both white, specialized in catching runaway slaves with their t=
rained bloodhounds.=20

Her parents always warned her and her brothers and sisters to go in someone=
's yard whenever=20

they saw these men with their dogs lest the ferocious animals tear them to =
pieces. In regards to=20

the "nigger stealers," Florida tells of a covered wagon which used to come =
to Tallahassee at=20

regular intervals and camp in some secluded spot. The children, attracted b=
y the old wagon, would=20

be eager to go near it, but they were always told that "Dry Head and Bloody=
 Bones," a ghost who=20

didn't like children, was in that wagon. It was not until later years that =
Florida and the other=20

children learned that the driver of the wagon was a "nigger stealer" who st=
ole children and took=20

them his father's fate; he kept up a small standing army; and the Whigs, th=
ough at the crisis of the=20

Exclusion Bill they laid their hands upon their swords, never ventured to d=
raw them, but allowed=20

themselves to be proscribed, their adherents to be ejected from the corpora=
tions, and their leaders=20

to be brought to the scaffold. Resistance was in the same way rendered hope=
less by the standing=20

army of James II., and the patriots were compelled to stretch their hands f=
or aid to William of=20

Orange. Even so, it might have gone hard with them if James's soldiers, and=
 above all Churchill,=20

had been true to their paymaster. Navies are not political; they do not ove=
rthrow constitutions; and=20

in the time of Charles I. it appears that the leading seamen were Protestan=
t, inclined to the side of=20

the Parliament. Perhaps Protestantism had been rendered fashionable in the =
navy by the naval=20

wars with Spain.  A third consequence of insular position, especially in ea=
rly times, is isolation. An=20

extreme case of isolation is presented by Egypt, which is in fact a great i=
sland in the desert. The=20

extraordinary fertility of the valley of the Nile produced an early develop=
ment, which was=20

afterwards arrested by its isolation, the isolation being probably intensif=
ied by the jealous=20

exclusiveness of a powerful priesthood which discouraged maritime pursuits.=
 The isolation of=20

England, though comparatively slight, has still been an important factor in=

ender of Tallahassee=20

to the Yankees. Three years later she came to Jacksonville to live with her=
 sister. She married but=20

is now divorced after 12 years of marriage.  Three years ago she entered th=
e Old Folks Home at=20

Viola B. Muse, Field Worker Jacksonville, Florida December 3, 1936  "FATHER=
" CHARLES=20

COATES   "Father" Charles Coates, as he is called by all who know him, was =
born a slave, 108=20

years ago at Richmond, Virginia, on the plantation of a man named L'Angle. =
His early boyhood=20

days was spent on the L'Angle place filled with duties such as minding hogs=
, cows, bringing in=20

wood and such light work. His wearing apparel consisted of one garment, a s=
hirt made to reach=20

below the knees and with three-quarter sleeves. He wore no shoes until he w=
as a man past 20=20

years of age.  The single garment was worn summer and winter alike and the =
change in the=20

weather did not cause an extra amount of clothes to be furnished for the sl=
aves. They were=20

required to move about so fast less than the Continental provinces the infl=
uence of Roman=20

Conquest. Scotland and Ireland escaped it altogether, for the tide of invas=
ion, having flowed to the=20

foot of the Grampians, soon ebbed to the line between the Solway and the Ty=
ne. Britain has no=20

monuments of Roman power and civilization like those which have been left i=
n Gaul and Spain,=20

and of the British Christianity of the Roman period hardly a trace, monumen=
tal or historical,=20

remains. By the Saxon conquest England was entirely severed for a time from=
 the European=20

system. The missionary of ecclesiastical Rome recovered what the legionary =
had lost. Of the main=20

elements of English character political and general, five were brought toge=
ther when Ethelbert and=20

Augustine met on the coast of Kent. The king represented Teutonism; the mis=
sionary represented=20

Judaism, Christianity, imperial and ecclesiastical Rome. We mention Judaism=
 as a separate=20

element, because, among other things, the image of the Hebrew monarchy has =
certainly entered=20

largely into the political conceptions of Englishmen, perhaps at least as l=
argely as the image of=20

Imperial Rome. A sixth element, classical Republicanism, came in with the R=
eformation, while the=20

political and social influence of science=20


_
heat from the body was sufficient to keep them warm.  When Charles was stil=
l a young man Mr.=20

L'Angle sold him on time payment to W.B. Hall; who several years before the=
 Civil War moved=20

from Richmond to Washington County, Georgia, carrying 135 grown slaves and =
many children.=20

Mr. Hall made Charles his carriage driver, which kept him from hard labor. =
Other slaves on the=20

plantation performed such duties as rail splitting, digging up trees by the=
 roots and other hard=20

work.  Charles Coates remembers vividly the cruelties practiced on the Hall=
 plantation. His duty=20

was to see that all the slaves reported to work on beginning to be felt. St=
ill, after the conversion of=20

England by Augustine, the Church, which was the main organ of civilization,=
 and almost identical=20

with it in the early Middle Ages, remained national; and to make it thoroug=
hly Roman and Papal, in=20

other words to assimilate it completely to the Church of the Continent, was=
 the object of=20

Hildebrand in promoting the enterprise of William. Roman and Papal the Engl=
ish Church was=20

made, yet not so thoroughly so as completely to destroy its insular and Teu=
tonic character. The=20

Archbishop of Canterbury was still _Papa alterius orbis_; and the struggle =
for national=20
