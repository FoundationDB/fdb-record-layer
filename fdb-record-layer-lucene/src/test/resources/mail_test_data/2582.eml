interpreted to exclude Negroes from the benefits therein provided, were con=
strued, nevertheless,=20

by friends of the race as authorizing their education at public expense. Co=
nvinced of the truth of=20

this contention, officials in different parts of the State began to yield i=
n the next decade. At=20

Columbia, Pennsylvania, the names of such colored children as were entitled=
 to the benefits of the=20

law for the education of the poor were taken in 1818 to enable them to atte=
nd the free public=20

schools. Following the same policy, the Abolition Society of Philadelphia, =
seeing that the city had=20

established public schools for white children in 1818, applied two years la=
ter for the share of the=20

fund to which the children of African descent were entitled by law. The req=
uest was granted. The=20

Comptroller opened in Lombard Street in 1822 a school for children of color=
, maintained at the=20

expense of the State. This furnished a precedent for other such schools whi=
ch were established in=20

1833, and 1841.[1] Harrisburg had a colored school early in the century, bu=
t upon the=20

establishment of the Lancastrian school in that city in the thirties, the c=
olored as well as the white=20

children were required to attend it or pay for their education themselves.[=
2]  [Footnote 1: _Special=20

Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed_., 1871, p. 379.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 3=
79.]  In 1834 the=20

legislature of Pennsylvania established a system of public schools, but the=
 claims of the Negroes=20

to public education were neither guaranteed nor denied.[1] The school law o=
f 1854, however,=20

seems to imply that the benefits of the system had always been understood t=
o extend to colored=20

children.[2] This measure provided that the comptrollers and directors of t=
he several school=20

districts of the State could establish within their respective districts se=
parate schools for Negro and=20

mulatto children wherever they could be so located as to accommodate twenty=
 or more pupils.=20

Another provision was that wherever such schools should "be established and=
 kept open four=20

months in the year" the directors and comptrollers should not be compelled =
to admit colored pupils=20

to any other schools of that district. The law was interpreted to mean that=
 wherever such=20

accommodations were not provided the children of Negroes could attend the o=
ther schools. Such=20

was the case in the rural districts where a few might find him.  The servic=
e over, Ivan repaired to=20

the Hall of Nobles, as one whose rank entitled him to find entrance there. =
He had to content=20

himself with an obscure place in the crowded assembly, where he could not s=
ee the Czar,=20

although he could hear his voice. In a noble address, Alexander laid before=
 his subjects the full=20

extent of the public danger. He concealed nothing; the strength of the inva=
ders, the position of the=20

army, its perils, its resources, its needs, all were revealed with a large-=
minded candour which=20

would have honoured the constitutional monarch of a free people. In conclus=
ion, he said that he=20

=E2=80=9Cregarded the zeal of the nobility as the firmest support of the th=
rone. In all times and on all=20

occasions it has proved the faithful defender of the integrity and glory of=
 Russia.=E2=80=9D Here his voice=20

thrilled, faltered with emotion, and he paused amidst a universal cry that =
seemed to shake the=20

massive roof and walls of the grand old hall--=E2=80=9CAsk what you please,=
 sire; we offer you everything.=E2=80=9D=20

One of the nobles proposed the gift of a serf in every twenty-five; but a c=
horus of eager voices=20

interrupted, =E2=80=9CIt is not half enough!=E2=80=9D Finally, one serf in =
every ten, ready armed and equipped, and=20

provided for three months, was unanimously voted for the service of the Cza=
r.[19]  While all this=20

went on, Ivan sat in his place, silent and sad at heart. _He_ had nothing t=
o give,--nothing but his=20

life; yet that, perhaps, might count for something hereafter.  In the meant=
ime, a scene equally=20

significant was taking place in the adjacent Hall of Merchants. Old Petrovi=
tch repaired thither with=20

the rest, leaning on the arm of his youthful guide Feodor, his eldest son, =
who ought to have=20



accompanied him, being absent at the time. =E2=80=9CI cannot see the face o=
f the Lord=E2=80=99s anointed,=E2=80=9D he said,=20

=E2=80=9Cbut I can hear his voice.=E2=80=9D This assembly, like the other, =
was densely crowded. Feodor contrived to=20

find standing room upon the edge of a seat; and from this vantage-ground he=
 was able to look=20

over the heads of the throng of grave, bearded merchants. =E2=80=9CGrandfat=
her,=E2=80=9D he whispered, =E2=80=9Cthe Czar=20

is not here; only the Governor.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGod save his Excellency =
Count Rostopchine! Hearts of steel,=20

such as his, are sorely needed now,=E2=80=9D the old man responded.  =E2=80=
=9CBut we can see _him_ any day we=20

like. It is the Czar we want to see,=E2=80=9D grumbled Feodor.  =E2=80=9CPa=
tience, boy; he=20

school with their white friends.[3] The children of Robert B. Purvis, howev=
er, were turned away=20

from the public schools of Philadelphia on the ground that special educatio=
nal facilities for them=20

had been provided.[4] It was not until 1881 that Pennsylvania finally swept=
 away all the distinctions=20

of caste from her public school system.  [Footnote 1: _Purdon's Digest of t=
he Laws of Pa_., p. 291,=20

sections 1-23.]  [Footnote 2: Stroud =E2=80=9CAnd, while we wait for him, i=
t is _his_ words the count is going=20

to give us, not his own.=E2=80=9D  This was true. Amidst a hush of eager ex=
pectation, the Governor rose=20

and read aloud the address of the Czar =E2=80=9Cto our ancient city and met=
ropolis of Moscow.=E2=80=9D It=20

contained the same explanations and appeals which at that moment in another=
 place were falling=20

from his own lips; and concluded with an earnest exhortation to prepare for=
