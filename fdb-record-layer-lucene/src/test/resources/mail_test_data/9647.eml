that the boy had it in his mind to escape. She did not wish to arouse Uncle=
 Jabez. Nor did she=20

wish the strange boy to depart so secretly.  Mr. Cameron expected to find h=
im here when he came=20

in the morning, she was sure. Although Mr. Cameron only supposed him an ord=
inary runaway, and=20

perhaps wished to advise him to return to his mother, Ruth knew well that F=
red Hatfield's was no=20

ordinary case of vagabondage.  Ruth hesitated on the stairs for some minute=
s. Uncle Jabez=20

snored. There was no further movement from the boy on the couch.  She was g=
rowing very cold.=20

Ruth could not remain there on the stairs to guard the boy all night. Somet=
hing desperate had to=20

be done--and something very desperate she did!  She unlatched the door agai=
n as quietly as=20

possible. She pushed it open far enough to slip through into the kitchen. T=
here was no movement=20

from the boy--not a sound. Nor did Ruth dare even look in his direction.  S=
he crept across the=20

kitchen floor to the stove. She reached the garments hung upon the chair ba=
cks. She selected one=20

and withdrew in a hurry to the staircase, and so ran up to her room.  "Ther=
e!" she thought, shutting=20

her door and breathing heavily. "If he wants to run away he can; but he'll =
have to go without his=20

trousers!"     CHAPTER V  OFF FOR THE BACKWOODS   It was still dark when Ru=
th awoke and=20

slipped down to the kitchen again. But she heard her uncle rattling the sto=
ve grate. He was a very=20

early riser. She peered into the kitchen and saw the grove of drying clothi=
ng, so knew that her trick=20

of the night before had kept Fred Hatfield from running away.  Therefore sh=
e merely dropped the=20

boy's nether garments inside the kitchen door and scurried back to her own =
room to dress by=20

candle-light. She heard Aunt Alvirah stumbling about her room and groaning =
her old, old tune,=20

"Oh, my back, and oh, my bones!" As soon as Ruth was dressed she ran in to =
see if she could do=20

anything for the old woman.  "Ah, deary! what a precious pretty you be," sa=
id the old woman,=20

hugging her. "I'm so rich and important--snatched in a moment from all his =
enjoyments. He had=20

been deeply awed and impressed when he heard of it first; but by this time =
the honours paid to the=20

dead man seemed to John an insult to his own superior claims--he who was li=
ving and suffering=20

unjustly. To think that those who called themselves his friends should have=
 deserted him to show=20

a respect which they could not feel for the memory of a man whom they had n=
one of them=20

respected while he lived! He was no cynic, nor fond of attributing every ev=
il to the baseness of=20

humanity, but he could not help saying now, between his closed teeth, that =
it was the way of the=20

world.  He had another visitor in the afternoon, some time after Miss Barba=
ra took her departure,=20

but not one of those he expected. To his great surprise, it was the white e=
rect head of old Sir=20

James which was the next he saw. The veteran came in with a grave and troub=
led countenance.=20

He gave a shudder when he heard the key turn in the door. "I have come to s=
ee if there was--

anything I could do for you?" Sir James said.  John laughed again. To laugh=
 seemed the only=20

possible way of expressing himself. It is permissible for a man to laugh wh=
en a woman would cry,=20

and the meaning is much the same. This expressed indignation, incredulity, =
some contempt, yet=20

was softened by a gentler sentiment, at sight of the old soldier's kind and=
 benign but puzzled and=20

troubled face. "I don't know what any one can do for me but take me out of =
this," he said, "and no=20

one seems disposed to do that."  "John Erskine," said the old General solem=
nly, "the=20

circumstances are very serious. If you had seen, as I have seen, a young, s=
trong man laid in his=20

grave this day, with a little toddling bairn, chief mourner." His voice bro=
ke a little, as he spoke. He=20

waved his hand as if to put this recollection away. "And your story was not=
 satisfactory. It did not=20

commend itself to my mind. Have patience and hear me out. I came away from =
you in displeasure,=20



and I've done nothing but turn it=20


_
long. And your Uncle's that proud of you, too! He often reads the reports t=
he school teacher sends=20

him--I see him doing that in the evening. He keeps the reports in his cash-=
box, just as though they=20

was as precious as his stocks and bonds. Yes-indeedy!"  "You are so glad to=
 have me at home,=20

Aunt over in my thoughts ever since. It's very far from satisfactory; but I=
 cannot find it in my heart=20

to disbelieve you," the old man cried, with a quiver of emotion in his face=
. He held out his large,=20

soft, old hand suddenly as he spoke. John, who had been winding himself up =
to indignant=20

resistance,=20
