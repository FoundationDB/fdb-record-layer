was difficult not to feel anxious about her, though the general would never=

 week having elapsed since his arrival at the camp, _
fired, and killed several of the islanders. The vessel continued to strike =
violently against the rocks,=20

and soon went to pieces. Some of the crew took to their boats, but were dri=
ven on shore, and=20

murdered by the natives; others threw themselves into the sea, and such as =
reached the land,=20

shared the fate of their unfortunate companions, so that not a single soul =
belonging to this vessel=20

escaped alive."  "The ship which grounded on Paiow, was driven on a sandy b=
each, and the=20

natives came down and also discharged their arrows into her; but the crew p=
rudently did not=20

resent the aggression, but held up axes, beads, and toys, as peace-offering=
s, upon which the=20

assailants desisted from farther hostilities. As soon as the wind had moder=
ated, an aged chief, in a=20

canoe, put off to the ship. He was received with caresses, accepted the pre=
sents offered to him:=20

and upon going ashore, pacified the islanders by assurances that the ship's=
 crew were peaceably=20

inclined towards them. Upon this, several natives went on board, and were a=
ll presented with toys.=20

In return, they supplied the crew with yams, fowls, bananas, cocoa-nuts, ho=
gs, &c. and confidence=20

was established between them. The ship was now abandoned, and the crew went=
 on shore,=20

bringing with them part of her stores. Here they remained for some time, an=
d built a small vessel=20

with the materials from the wreck. When it was ready to put to sea, as many=
 as could=20

conveniently, embarked in her, being plentifully supplied with fresh provis=
ions by the islanders.=20

The commander promised those who were left behind, to return immediately wi=
th presents for the=20

natives, and to bring them off; but, as the little vessel was never afterwa=
rds heard of, the men=20

sought the protection of the neighbouring chiefs, with whom they lived. Sev=
eral muskets and some=20

gunpowder had been left them by their comrades, and by means of these, they=
 proved of great=20

service to their friends, in encounters with the neighbouring islanders."  =
The natives of Manicolo=20

are not cannibals; but when an enemy falls into their power he is immediate=
ly killed, and his body=20

is deposited in sea-water, and kept there until the bones become perfectly =
bare. The skeleton is=20

then taken up, the bones of the extremities scraped and cut into various fo=
rms, to point arrows and=20

spears. Their arms consist tent; you are a veteran=E2=80=94the only one amo=
ng us, at least on the staff,=20

who was wounded at Aspromonte.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 52 The life of Lothai=
r had been so strange and=20

exciting since he quitted Muriel Towers that he had found little time for t=
hat reflection in which he=20

was once so prone to indulge. Perhaps he shrank from it. If he wanted an ea=
sy distraction from=20

self-criticism it may be a convenient refuge from the scruples, or even the=
 pangs, of conscience=E2=80=94it=20

was profusely supplied by the startling affairs of which he formed a part, =
the singular characters=20

with whom he was placed in contact, the risk and responsibility which seeme=
d suddenly to have=20

encompassed him with their ever-stimulating influence, and, lastly, by the =
novelty of foreign travel,=20

which, even under ordinary circumstances, has a tendency to rouse and stir =
up even ordinary=20

men.  So long as Theodora was his companion in their counsels, and he was l=
istening to her deep=20

plans and daring suggestions, enforced by that calm enthusiasm which was no=
t the least powerful=20

of her commanding spells, it is not perhaps surprising that he should have =
yielded without an effort=20

to her bewitching ascendancy. But when they had separated, and she had emba=
rked on that=20

perilous enterprise of personally conferring with the chiefs of those secre=
t societies of France,=20

which had been fancifully baptized by her popular name, and had nurtured he=
r tradition as a=20

religious faith, it might have been supposed that Lothair, left to himself,=
 might have recurred to the=20

earlier sentiments of his youth. But he was not left to himself. He was lef=
t with her injunctions, and=20

the spirit of the oracle, though the divinity was no longer visible, pervad=
ed his mind and life.=20



Lothair was to accompany the general as one of his aides-de-camp, and he wa=
s to meet Theodora=20

again on what was contemplated as the field of memorable actions. Theodora =
had wisely=20

calculated on the influence, beneficial in her view, which the character of=
 a man like the general=20

would exercise over Lothair. This consummate military leader, though he had=
 pursued a daring=20

career, and was a man of strong convictions, was distinguished by an almost=
 unerring judgment,=20

and a mastery of method rarely surpassed. Though he was without imagination=
 or sentiment, there=20

were occasions on which he had shown he=20


_
heavy clubs, spears, and bows and arrows. They poison the latter with a kin=
d of reddish gum,=20

extracted from a species of tree peculiar to the island. When any one is st=
ruck by a poisoned=20

arrow in any of the limbs, the part is quickly cut out, and his life is som=
etimes saved; but if the=20

wound happens to be in the body, where it cannot be easily excised, he resi=
gns himself quietly to=20

death without a murmur, though he frequently lingers for four or five days =
in excruciating agony.=20

The Manicolans differ from almost all the other islanders in the South Sea;=
 they are as black as=20

negroes, have short woolly hair, and resemble them in their features. Their=
 religion also is=20

different; in every village in the island there is a house dedicated to the=
 Deity. At the principal=20

chapel, the skulls of all the people who were killed, belonging to the ship=
 that grounded at=20

Whanoo, are still preserved. The natives of Tucopia, unaccustomed to the si=
ght of human bones,=20

avoid, as much as possible, when they visit the island, approaching the sac=
red house where the=20

skulls are deposited.            *       *       *       *       *  THE SEL=
ECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES=20

OF _NEW WORKS_.         *       *       *       *       *   WAVERLEY NOVELS=
.   The _new edition_, (of=20

which _Waverley_ has just appeared,) is, without exception, the handsomest =
book of the day, in=20

sympathy, and he had a rapid and correct perception of character. He was a =
thoroughly honest=20

man, and, in the course of a life of great trial and vicissitude, even enve=
nomed foes had never=20

impeached his pure integrity. For the rest, he was unselfish, but severe in=
 discipline, inflexible, and=20

even ruthless in the fulfilment of his purpose. A certain simplicity of spe=
ech and conduct, and a=20

disinterestedness which, even in little things, was constantly exhibiting i=
tself, gave to his character=20

even charm, and rendered personal intercourse with him highly agreeable.  I=
n the countless=20

arrangements which had to be made, Lothair was never wearied in recognizing=
 and admiring the=20

prescience and precision of his chief; and when the day had died, and for a=
 moment they had=20

ceased from their labors, or were travelling together, often through the ni=
ght, Lothair found in the=20

conversation of his companion, artless and unrestrained, a wonderful fund o=
f knowledge both of=20

men and things, and that, too, in very different climes and countries.  The=
 camp in the Apennines=20

was not favorable to useless reverie. Lothair found unceasing and deeply-in=
teresting occupation in=20

his numerous and novel duties; and, if his thoughts for a moment wandered b=
eyond the barren=20

peaks around him, they were attracted and engrossed by one subject=E2=80=94=
and that was, naturally,=20

Theodora.=20
