INTRODUCTION.  The winter of 1879-80 Ibsen spent in Munich, and the greater=
 part of the=20

summer of 1880 at Berchtesgaden. November 1880 saw him back in Rome, and he=
 passed the=20

summer of 1881 at Sorrento. There, fourteen years earlier, he had written t=
he last acts of _Peer=20

Gynt_; there he now wrote, or at any rate completed, _Gengangere_. It was p=
ublished in=20

December 1881, after he had returned to Rome. On December 22 he wrote to Lu=
dwig Passarge,=20

one of his German translators, "My new play has now appeared, and has occas=
ioned a terrible=20

uproar in the Scandinavian press; every day I receive letters and newspaper=
 articles decrying or=20

praising it.... I consider it utterly impossible that any German theatre wi=
ll accept the play at present.=20

I hardly believe that they will dare to play it in the Scandinavian countri=
es for some time to come."=20

How rightly he judged we shall see anon.  In the newspapers there was was a=
 command of the=20

waters, which was secured in early March by an event that startled the worl=
d. Among the many=20

disadvantages under which the South labored in her struggle with the North =
was a painful lack, as=20

compared with her opponent, of factories, machine-shops, ship-yards, and sk=
illed labor; yet=20

determination and ingenuity brought about several wonderful fighting contri=
vances, of which the=20

most remarkable was the _Virginia_. The hull of the _Merrimac_, a frigate o=
f thirty-five hundred=20

tons and forty guns, one of the most formidable vessels of the old navy, pa=
rtly burned and=20

afterward sunk at the evacuation of Norfolk by the Federals in April, 1861,=
 was raised, and found=20

to be sound enough for further use. Good heads, among whom John M. Brooke, =
manager of the=20

Tredegar Iron Works at Richmond, was prominent, fitted to the hull a casema=
te, or box, pierced for=20

cannon, and heavily plated with iron--the first effective armored ship. The=
re was a frank farewell to=20

masts, sails, and other=20
