dracaena marginata fifteen-sixteenths of the inertia. Hence, we find these =
constant air currents toward the west are, in reality, the result of the ea=
rth carrying any object on its surface a little more rapidly than the atmos=
phere moves; so that these winds are precisely the same in dracaena margina=
ta fifteen-sixteenths of the inertia. Hence, we find these constant air cur=
rents toward the west are, in reality, the result of the earth carrying any=
 object on its surface a little more rapidly than the atmosphere moves; so =
that these winds are precisely the same in _
affection for his person, and of admiration for his principles. But for the=
se exuberant manifestations=20

of attachment and devotion, I certainly might give the reader a splendid sp=
ecimen of what a=20

speech on the hustings may be. The hurrahs and the huzzas broke up Mr. Fipp=
s's arguments, and=20

the coruscations of his eloquence into fragments. Let it suffice to say, it=
 was a brilliant and a grand=20

speech.  On the show of hands being called for, a few were held up for Mr. =
Twitch, a few more for=20

Mr. Jollefat, and a whole forest of uplifted palms testified their desire t=
o have Horatio Mount-

Stephen Fipps as the member for N----. The returning officer, of course, de=
clared the choice of the=20

electors, by an open vote, to have fallen upon that honourable gentleman, a=
nd a poll was=20

demanded by each of his antagonists.  The most important thing to be now ef=
fected was an=20

escape from the town. This was not in reality a very easy thing, although t=
o the reader nothing=20

may perhaps appear more easy of accomplishment. By this time every body in =
the place knew the=20

three conspirators, and neither the "candidate," nor his two immediate asso=
ciates, were often left=20

alone during five consecutive minutes. To quit the place by either of the o=
rdinary roads, in the=20

ordinary way, would have been likely to excite suspicion. To have moved off=
 singly, but=20

simultaneously, by three different roads, would have excited less suspicion=
 perhaps, but would=20

have been more damnatory if discovered. To move off other than simultaneous=
ly would have been=20

to peril, perhaps, the lives, and certainly to have perilled the chastiseme=
nt, of one or two who=20

might remain after the flight of one had been ascertained.  Detection was, =
moreover, a thing likely,=20

under any circumstances, to follow rapidly on the retreat. My man had notic=
ed the presence of at=20

least half a dozen strangers in the camp of the enemy. These strangers had =
a knowing look, and=20

wore a metropolitan aspect. He suspected them of being spies upon us. Mr. F=
ipps's antecedents=20

might, for any thing we positively knew to the contrary, have been ascertai=
ned, and become=20

known to the Liberal candidate, whose game he was trying to spoil, although=
 that gentleman and=20

his friend might not deem it expedient (if they could not exactly prove the=
 connexion between the=20

party of Fipps and that of Mr. Jollefat) to explode the fiction of the form=
er's candidature. However,=20

get away they must, and that before the polling of to-morrow, or they would=
 not get away until too=20

late.  It was part of my design icy coldness a short distance beneath. The =
great Polar current=20

comes down from Baffin=E2=80=99s Bay, and off the coast of Newfoundland it =
plunges beneath the warm,=20

lighter current of the Gulf Stream; but it is not warmed by it. Registering=
 thermometers detect its=20

icy coldness almost unchanged in the realms of the tropics, far beneath the=
 surface.  Note some=20

simple illustrations of the expansive force of freezing water. Every housew=
ife knows that a bottle=20

left full of water will burst when the water freezes. The same power is sho=
wn in the gradual=20

disintegration of rocks by alternate freezing and thawing. Water freezing i=
n the crevices bursts off=20

small particles, or even large fragments; so that rocks long exposed to the=
 weather, crumble more=20

or less. Every one is familiar with the appearance presented by steep clay-=
banks, in late winter=20

and early spring, of ragged masses and fragments ready to fall at any time.=
 Still another instance=20

of this destructive power is shown in the killing of vegetation by freezing=
. Plants are built of=20

myriads of tiny cells. The moisture within freezes and bursts the cell-wall=
s, destroying the plant life.=20

Certain plants have cells more elastic than others, which in consequence ar=
e not destroyed by=20

freezing. But as an expanded cell does not readily shrink to its former siz=
e, subsequent freezings,=20

when the cell contains more water than before, may finally destroy it. So w=
heat is =E2=80=9Cwinter-killed,=E2=80=9D=20

by too frequent freezing. So globes of steel may be burst by this force.  T=
o show the poor qualities=20



of water as a conductor of heat, take a long glass tube and fill with water=
. Then put a piece of ice=20

in one end. The water at the other end may now be brought to the boiling po=
int by means of the=20

flame of a lamp, ere the ice at the other end is melted.  Every one is fami=
liar with the fact that=20

heated air rises; but not all inquire why it does so. Take a foot-ball or b=
ladder and partially inflate it;=20

then hold it near a hot fire, and it may be swollen almost to bursting. Now=
, there is no more air in it=20

than before; and if it be laid in a cold place, it will shrink to its first=
 inflation. This shows how great=20

is the expansive power of heat on the atmosphere. The same weight occupying=
 a much larger=20

bulk, we perceive that heated air is much lighter, and must rise. This, the=
n, is the cause of what=20

are known as constant winds.  As the earth revolves on its axis, the air is=
 unequally heated, that=20

nearest the equator becoming the warmest, in consequence of its receiving t=
he most direct=20


_
match should be applied at this exact point of the scheme.  We had arranged=
 to keep the poll open=20

for Fipps, notwithstanding his flight. No official notice of the abandonmen=
t of his candidature was=20

therefore served upon the returning officer.  In fact, although Fipps ran a=
way, Fipps must still be a=20

candidate. Our head lawyer thought that necessary, and also thought it wise=
 to poll one man at=20

least for the runaway.  After deliberation, it was arranged between the int=
ended fugitives that=20

morning should be chosen for their flight, and that they should fly in comp=
any. After the=20

nomination, high revelry had been kept at the Green Swan with Two Tails. Ev=
ery section of the=20

community of N---- had its representation there: the lower orders being pro=
vided for in rooms, and=20

with refreshments suited to their tastes, while the while the cooler air to=
 the north or south must=20

flow southward or northward to fill the vacuum. Now, the earth turning on i=
ts axis from west to=20

east, whirls the northward and southward currents to the westward, so that =
they appear to blow=20

from the northeast and southeast. The result of this loss of direction is g=
radual; so that when first=20

perceptible, they are almost from a due northerly or southerly direction. A=
s they near the equator,=20

they are more rapid, and turn more decidedly to the west, never becoming vi=
olent, however; rarely=20

exceeding fifteen to eighteen miles per hour.  It would appear that at the =
point where these meet=20

each other, or come in contact with the ascending warm current, there must =
be a region of calms=20

or light, variable winds, and occasional tempests. Such, in fact, is the ca=
se. This belt is from two=20


_
municipal notabilities who had attached themselves to the popular and winni=
ng cause of Fipps,=20

were being entertained in a better room of the house. Fipps himself, and my=
 man and the attorney,=20

being in the company of the latter, carefully guarded against any thing lik=
e excess. They were the=20

only prudent people in the lot. This revelry lasted through the night, and =
until morning. Mine host=20

himself, knocked up by fatigue and potations, retired to an uneasy couch. T=
he hostess had=20

snatched a little rest, and resumed charge of the house while her lord slum=
bered. As for Mr. Fipps,=20

my man, and the attorney, they contrived to disentangle themselves from the=
ir supporters about=20

three in the morning, under strong protestations of anxiety for the welfare=
 of those gentlemen, who=20

were urged, for appearance' sake and their own health's sake, to retire hom=
e and get a few winks=20

of sleep, and come refreshed in the morning to the poll. By this means the =
multitude surrounding=20

the candidate, except his two confidants, were got rid of. So far good.  mi=
les in width, and lies=20

along the thermal equator, or line of greatest average heat. This is not th=
e same at the earth=E2=80=99s=20

equator, properly so called; for, as the land has greater capacity for abso=
rbing and retaining heat=20

than the sea, and as most of the land lies in the northern hemisphere, it i=
s evident the highest=20

mean temperature must be north of the equator. So this belt of calms must l=
ie in the same region;=20

and, in fact, in the Atlantic ocean it lies between 3 and 9=C2=B0 north lat=
itude, and in the Pacific,=20

between 4 and 8=C2=B0. As the sun travels northward during the first half o=
f the year, this region of=20

calms shifts slightly, also, so as to always nearly coincide with belt of t=
he greatest mean heat.  At=20

first sight, it appears curious that the motion of the earth should deflect=
 these winds to the west. It=20

would appear that the earth, atmosphere and all, must revolve as a unit abo=
ut its axis; else, if the=20

atmosphere lose time, its speed to the westward should be constantly accele=
rated, and long ago=20

should have reached a velocity=20


_
About six in the morning, Fipps,--oppressed with an imaginary headache and =
sense of fatigue; my=20

man, in like condition; and the attorney, in a similar state,--called for s=
oda-water with a dash of=20

brandy, and began, in the presence of the hostess, to bewail their unfitnes=
s to go through the=20

labours of the approaching struggle. My man suggested that it might be as w=
ell to take a stroll, if=20

they could get out quietly and not have a rabble at their heels. They asked=
 if that were possible.=20

The landlady consented to let them out by a back-door across a meadow which=
 formed part of her=20

lord's tenancy, where they could strike off into some by-lanes, and get wha=
t they so urgently=20

needed--"a breath of fresh air." This suited admirably. My man had already =
taken soundings of the=20

roads, and knew that by this means the party could walk or run off a shake =
the mountains=20

themselves; while, in fact, there is no variation perceptible.  It should b=
e remembered that at the=20

equator the earth is about twenty-four thousand miles in circumference; and=
 as one complete=20

revolution is made every twenty-four hours, a point on the equator is carri=
ed eastward at the rate=20

of one thousand miles an hour. But if a circle be drawn around the earth pa=
rallel to the equator, at=20

some distance from it, it is at once seen that any object in this circle, h=
aving a shorter distance to=20

traverse, is carried eastward at a slower rate; so that a point only a few =
yards from either pole=20

must necessarily advance but a few feet per hour. So then, a body of air mo=
ving from either pole=20

toward the equator, must needs advance very slowly if the friction of the u=
pper reverse currents=20

and of the surface of the globe are to=20


_
of only five miles, and meet an up-train to London at the ---- Station at e=
ight o'clock a.m.  Not a=20

soul was astir on the outskirts of the town, save here and there a rustic l=
abourer walking to his toil=20

or engaged thereon--rude, unlettered men, without political thought or char=
acter, who took no=20

interest in the great struggle at the borough of N----, and who cared to do=
 no more than return the=20

salutation of "Good morning" to the same velocity as that of any point over=
 which it may pass.=20

Now, in the case of these constant winds, the inertia is very nearly overco=
me, as they start from a=20

circle in which the velocity to the eastward is about 750 miles per hour. I=
f the inertia were fully=20

overcome, there would be no perceptible wind; as the velocity is actually b=
ut fifteen to eighteen=20

miles per hour, it appears that the friction encountered actually destroys =
from=20
