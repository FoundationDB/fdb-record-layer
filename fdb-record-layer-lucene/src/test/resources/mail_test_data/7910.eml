philodendron monstera of evil. Every toll of the solemn bell, which pealed through the calm evening air, seemed, with a voice more impressive than that of man, to repeat the warning, _He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly the Winter, then the Drink will chill, and grow flat and dead. But where Cellars are of this sort, it is adviseable to make your great Brewings in this Month rather than in _October_; for you may keep such Cellars temperate in philodendron monstera of evil.

muscular arms, and loud voice. They were also the two about whose spiritual state their pastor 

had felt most concern. Nancy, a slave to violent passions, furious temper, and a craving for drink. 

Stone, free from all these vices, yet, in his self-righteousness and blindness of heart, almost as far 

from the kingdom of heaven as the neighbor whom he despised. Almost at the same time the two 

had been stricken down, the one by a terrible accident, the other by sudden illness. Affliction had 

come to both the Pharisee and the publican. One had been raised and restored, though maimed, 

to her home; the other was never to quit his cottage till carried forth in his coffin. But mercy had 

visited each, and, as they met to attend the solemn service together, both penitents could say in 

the words of the Psalmist, _It is good for me that I have been afflicted_.   Take a large Eel, and 

scour the Skin and the Inside very well with Salt, cut off the Head, and split it down the Back, then 

lay it abroad upon your Dresser, and season it well with Spice, Salt, and a good quantity of Red 

Sage minced small: mix these well, and sprinkle the Mixture thick upon your Eel, then roll it up, 

and tye it close in a thin Cloth at each end, and in the middle; boil it then in a strong Pickle of 

Vinegar, Water, Salt, some Spice, and a Bay-leaf or two; and when it is boiled enough, take out 

the Eel, and let it stand till it is quite cold, and when the Pickle is cold likewise, pour the Pickle into 

a glazed Earthen-Pan, and put your Eel into it to keep for Use; this will remain good several 

Weeks, if it is kept close cover'd. When the Eel is quite cold, take off the Cloth.  The Eel is also 

good in Pyes, fry'd and boil'd, which

This was the first time that Nancy had been a communicant; she had never before dared to 

approach the table of the Lord. Stone, on the contrary, had attended regularly, at stated times in 

the year; but with him, until now, the service had been but an empty form, only tending to increase 

the blindness of his conscience, by leading him to think that he had fulfilled all righteousness, 

when he made thus open profession of faith, without one spark of its living reality. At that time Ben 

Stone would have scouted the idea of Nancy Sands, whom he deemed the worst woman in 

Colme, being permitted to enter his cottage on an occasion so solemn, to show that she shared 

his faith and his hopes, and might share his happiness in the mansions above. Yet there they were 

now together, Pharisee and publican, both brought to the foot of the cross; the once despised 

drunkard meekly giving God thanks that she was not what she once had been, and the Pharisee, 

not raising up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but silently uttering the prayer, _God be merciful 

to me a sinner_!  Often had Persis and her husband joined in the holy service, but never had they 

felt heaven nearer to them, and the Christian's hope sweeter, than they did in Stone's cottage on 

that bright August eve. They saw the saving power of the gospel in the two penitents before them, 

the one rescued from the rock of self-righteousness, the other from the whirlpool of intemperance. 

The little flock gathered together in that peaceful home seemed an emblem of that blessed band, 

who, through God's mercy and grace, shall, after life's troubles and tossings, reach in safety the 

heavenly shore.  As the Frankses returned, after the solemn meeting by the sick-bed of Stone, a 

rich, golden glow was over the sky, and a deep stillness in the air; heaven seemed to be all to 

prepare.  About the end of this Month, the Trout begins to come in Season; for before this time, its 

Body is cover'd with little Insects, which is a Demonstration of its being sick and unwholesome. 

The best way of eating this Fish is to boil it, and serve it with Butter and an Anchovy for Sauce; as 

is commonly practis'd about _Hungerford, Spenham-Land_, and other noted Places for Trout.  If 

the Season is now mild, about the end of the Month the Sap in the Birch-Tree will begin to be very 

fluent. And so in the Choice of Fish to be seasonable, we must have regard to the Temper of the 

Air; for if the Air be mild and gentle, sooner or later all parts of the Creation are govern'd by it: but 

when I direct for this Month or another any thing to be done, I suppose the Temper of the Air to be 

what it is for the generality; but the Birch-Tree Sap we will suppose begins now to flow, and then 

we are to take the opportunity of making Wine of it. The best Receipt I have met with for making 

this Wine, is the following.    To make Birch-Wine. From Lady _W._  When the Sap of the Birch-

Tree will run, cut a large Notch in the Bark of the Trunk of the Tree, in such a place as one may 

conveniently place a Vessel to receive the Sap; which Will flow at the Incision very plentifully, 

without doing any harm to the Tree. If the Trees are pretty large, you may expect about a Gallon of 

Liquor from each of them, which must be order'd in the following manner. Take five Gallons of the 

Liquor, to which put five Pounds of Powder-Sugar, and two Pounds of Raisins of the Sun stoned; 

to this, put the Peel of one large Lemon, and about forty large fresh Cloves: boil all these together, 

taking off the Scum carefully as it rises; then pour it off into some Vessel to cool, and as soon as it 

is cool enough to put Yeast to it, work it as

came a sound, solemn at all times, but especially so at that hour, the measured tolling of the 

church-bells for a departed soul. It was the first announcement to those who had met in Stone's 

cottage that the unhappy Sir Lacy had been called to his last account.  Yes, the bells that had 

been silent on his arrival at his ancestral home, now, with slow and mournful peal, announced his 

departure. Soon would a dark and narrow home receive the mortal remains of the late possessor 

of thousands of acres. Had power, wealth, and high station been a blessing or a curse to him who 

had not indeed _buried_ his talents, but made them an instrument of evil? The profane tongue 

was now silenced; the hand that had rattled the then tunn it, taking care not to stop the Vessel till it 

has done Working, and in a Month's time it will be ready to bottle. This is not only a very Pleasant, 

but a very Wholesome Wine.  This Month is esteemed one of the principal Seasons for brewing of 

Malt Liquors for long keeping; the Reason is, because the Air at this time of the Year is temperate, 

and contributes to the good Working or Fermenting the Drink, which chiefly promotes its 

Preservation and good Keeping: for very cold Weather prevents the free Fermentation or Working 

of Liquors, as well as very hot Weather; so that if we brew in very cold Weather, unless we use 

some Means to warm the Cellar while new Drink is Working, it will never clear

busy with evil designs, the heart that had been a den of wickedness, now lay lifeless and cold. The 

baronet's spirit had passed from earth, and left no sweet memories behind. Another and a far 

better man would now bear his title and rule in his Hall, and dispense happiness as widely as the 

late lord of the manor had tried to spread the under, if in very hot Weather the Cellar is not put in a 

temperate state, the Consequence of which will be, that such Drink will be Muddy and Sour, and, 

perhaps, never recover; or if it does, perhaps not under two or three Years. Again, such 

Misfortunes are often owing to the badness of the Cellars; for where they are dug in springy 

Ground,
