Tom's second blast was even more successful than the first, and enough of t=
he hard rock was=20

loosed and pulverized to give the Indian laborers ten days' work in removin=
g it from the tunnel.=20

Then, as the services of the young inventor would not be needed for a week =
or more, he decided=20

to go on a little trip with Professor Bumper.  "I'll come too," said Mr. Da=
mon. "One of the sub-

contractors whose men are gathering the cinchona bark for our firm has his =
headquarters in the=20

region where you are going, and I can go over there and see why he isn't up=
 to the mark."=20

Accordingly, preparations having been made to spend a week in camp in the f=
orests of the Andes,=20

Tom and his party set off one morning. Professor Bumper's Indian helpers wo=
uld do the hard=20

work, and, of course, Koku, who went wherever Tom went, would be on hand in=
 case some feat of=20

strength were needed.  It was a blind search, this hunt for a lost city, an=
d as much luck might be=20

expected going in one direction as in another; so the party had no fixed po=
int toward which to=20

travel. Only Mr. Damon stipulated that he wanted to reach a certain village=
, and they planned to=20

include that on their route.  Tom Swift took his electric rifle with him, a=
nd with it he was able to=20

bring down a couple of deer which formed a welcome addition to the camp far=
e.  The rifle was a=20

source of great wonder to the Peruvians.  They were familiar with ordinary =
firearms, and some of=20

them possessed old-fashioned guns. But Tom's electric weapon, which made no=
t a sound, but=20

killed with the swiftness of light, was awesome to them. The interpreter ac=
companying Professor=20

Bumper confided privately to Tom that the other Indians regarded the young =
inventor as a devil=20

who could, if he wished, slay by the mere winking of an eye.  Mr. Damon loc=
ated the quinine-

gathering force he was anxious to see, and, through the interpreter, told t=
he chief that more bark=20

must be brought in to keep up to the terms of the contract.  But something =
seemed to be the=20

matter. The Indian chief was indifferent to the interpreted demands of Mr. =
Damon, and that=20

gentleman, though he blessed any number of animate and inanimate objects, s=
eemed to make no=20

impression.  "No got men to gather bark, him say," translated the interpret=
er.  "Hasn't got any=20

men!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Why, look at all the lazy beggars around the vi=
llage."  This was true=20

enough, for there were any number of able-bodied Indians lolling in the sha=
de.  "Him say him no=20

got," repeated the translator, doggedly.  At that moment screams arose back=
 of one the grass=20

huts, and a child ran out into the open, followed by a savage dog which was=
 snapping at the little=20

one's bare legs.  "Bless my rat trap!" gasped Mr. Damon. "A mad dog!"  Shou=
ts and cries arose=20

from among the Indians. Women screamed, and those who had children gathered=
 them up in their=20

arms to run to shelter. The men threw all sorts of missiles at the infuriat=
ed animal, but seemed=20

afraid to approach it to knock it over with a club, or to go to the relief =
of the frightened child which=20

was now only a few feet ahead of the animal, running in a circle.  "Me git =
him!" cried Koku, jumping=20

forward.  "No,  Wait!" exclaimed Tom Swift. "You can kill the dog all right=
, Koku," he said, "but a=20

scratch from his tooth might be fatal. I'll fix him!"  Snatching his electr=
ic rifle from the Indian bearer=20

who carried it, Tom took quick aim. There was no flash, no report and no pu=
ff of A huge wave=20

broke over the main deck and the ship lurched desperately.  Two hours later=
 the cable parted, and=20

the ship was hurled rudderless to and fro in the trough of the sea.  By the=
 French account, matters=20

were in no more enviable state aboard the _Pelican_; Iberville, however, am=
idst scenes rivalling=20

those just described, did his best to animate his officers and men with a s=
pirit equalling his own.=20

"It is better," he cried, "to die, if we must, outside the bastions of Fort=
 Bourbon than to perish here=20

like pent sheep on board."  {149}  When morning broke, it was seen by the F=
rench that their ship=20



was not yet submerged, and it was resolved to disembark by such means as la=
y in their power.=20

The Company's servants were more fortunate.  The _Hudson's Bay_ had drifted=
 eight miles to the=20

south of the fort, and was wrecked on a bank of icy marshland, which at lea=
st constrained them to=20

wade no deeper than their knees.  The French, however, were forced to make =
their way through=20

the icy water submerged to their necks, from the results of which terrible =
exposure no fewer than=20

eighteen marines and seamen lost their lives.  Once on shore they could not=
, like the English, look=20

forward to a place of refuge and appease their hunger with provisions and d=
rink.  They were=20

obliged, in their shivering, half-frozen state, to subsist upon moss and se=
aweed, but for which=20

indifferent nourishment they must inevitably have perished.  The Company's =
garrison witnessed=20

the calamities which were overtaking the French, but not knowing how great =
their number, and=20

assured of their hostility, did not attempt any acts of mercy.  They percei=
ved the enemy camped in=20

a wood, less than two leagues distant, where, building several fires, they =
sought to restore their=20

spirits by means of warmth and hot draughts of boiled herbs.  While the for=
t was being continually=20

recruited by survivors of the two wrecked ships, the other three French ves=
sels had arrived on the=20

scene.  The fourth, the _Violent_, lay at the bottom of the Bay, having bee=
n sunk by the ice.  The=20

_Palmier_ had suffered the loss of her helm, but was fortunate in not being=
 also {150} a victim of=20

the storm.  The French forces being now united, little time was lost by Ibe=
rville in making active=20

preparations for the attack upon the fort.  On the 11th the enemy attained =
a small wood, almost=20

under the guns of the fort, and having entrenched themselves, lit numerous =
fires and made=20

considerable noise in order to lend the impression to the English that an e=
ntrenchment was being=20

thrown up.  This ruse was successful, for the Governor gave orders to fire =
in that direction; and=20

Iberville, seizing this opportunity, effected a landing of all his men and =
armaments from the ships.=20

The fort would now soon be hemmed in on all sides, and it were indeed stran=
ge if a chance shot or=20

firebrand did not ignite the timbers and the powder magazine were not explo=
ded.  Governor Bailey=20

was holding a council of his advisers when one of the French prisoners in t=
he fort gave notice of=20

the approach of a messenger bearing a flag of truce. He was recognised as M=
artigny.  The=20

Governor permitted his advance and sent a factor to meet him and insist upo=
n his eyes being=20

bandaged before he would be permitted to enter.  Martigny was conducted to =
where the council=20

was sitting, and there delivered Iberville's message demanding surrender.  =
He was instantly=20

interrupted by Captain Smithsend, who, with a=20


_
the dog suddenly crumpled up in a heap, and, with a dying yelp, rolled to o=
ne side.  The child was=20

saved.  The little one, aware that something had happened, turned and saw t=
he stretched out form=20

of its enemy. Then, sobbing and crying, it ran toward its mother who had ju=
st heard the news.=20

While the mothers gathered about the child, and while it were not true that=
 Iberville had been killed=20

in the action.  In spite of Martigny's denials, Smithsend loudly persisted =
in believing Iberville's=20

death, and held that the French were in sore straits and only {151} made th=
e present attack=20

because no other alternative was offered to desperate men to obtain food an=
d shelter.  Bailey=20

allowed=20


_
and girls made a ring at a respectful distance from the dog, there was acti=
vity noticed among the=20

men of the village. They began hurrying out along the forest paths.  "Where=
 are they going?"=20

asked Tom. "Is there some trouble?  Was that a sacred dog, and did I get in=
 bad by killing it?"  The=20

interpreter and the native chief conversed rapidly for a moment and then th=
e former, turning to of=20

Martigny's demands.  The latter returned, and the French instantly set up a=
 battery near the fort=20

and continued, amidst a hail of bullets, the work of landing their damaged =
stores and armaments.=20

Stragglers from the wreck of the _Hudson's Bay_ continued all day to find t=
heir way to the fort, but=20

several reached it only to be shot down in mistake by the cannon and musket=
s of their own=20
