ay abaft the main shrouds, _
countrymen to the gallows granted them M. le duc's gracious pardon and thei=
r liberty: the only=20

exception to this general amnesty being Pierre Adet, the son of the miller.=
 M. le duc's servants had=20

deposed to seeing him pull open the door of the coach and stand for some ti=
me half in and half out=20

of the carriage, obviously trying to terrorise Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle r=
efused either to=20

corroborate or to deny this statement, but she had arrived fainting at the =
gate of the chateau, and=20

she had been very ill ever since. She had sustained a serious shock to her =
nerves, so the doctor=20

hastily summoned from Paris had averred, and it was supposed that she had l=
ost all recollection of=20

the terrible incidents of that night.  But M. le duc was satisfied that it =
was Pierre Adet's presence=20

inside the coach which had brought about his daughter's mysterious illness =
and that heartrending=20

look of nameless horror which had dwelt in her eyes ever since. Therefore w=
ith regard to that man=20

M. le duc remained implacable and as a concession to a father's outraged fe=
elings both the mayor=20

of Nantes and the city functionaries accepted Adet's condemnation without a=
 murmur of dissent.=20

The sentence of death finally passed upon Pierre, the son of Jean Adet, mil=
ler of Vertou, could=20

not, however, be executed, for the simple reason that Pierre had disappeare=
d and that the most=20

rigorous search instituted in the neighbourhood and for miles around failed=
 to bring him to justice.=20

One of the outriders who had been in attendance on Mademoiselle on that fat=
eful night declared=20

that when Jean-Marie finally whipped up his horses at the approach of the p=
arty of soldiers, Adet=20

fell backwards from the step of the carriage and was run over by the hind w=
heels and instantly=20

killed. But his body was never found among the score or so which were left =
lying there in the mud=20

of the road until the women and old men came to seek their loved ones among=
 the dead.  Pierre=20

Adet had disappeared. But M. le duc's vengeance had need of a prey. The out=
rage which he was=20

quite convinced had been perpetrated against his daughter must be punished =
by death--if not by=20

the death of the chief offender, then by that of the one who stood nearest =
to him. Thus was Jean=20

Adet the miller dragged from his home and cast into prison. Was he not impl=
icated himself in the=20

riots? Camille the bailiff had seen and heard him among the insurgents on t=
he hillock that night. At=20

first it was stated that he would be held as hostage for the reappearance o=
f his son. But Pierre=20

Adet had evidently fled the countryside: he was obviously ignorant of the t=
errible fate which his=20

own folly had brought upon his father. Many thought that he had gone to  VI=
XEN DELIVERED=20

AND WOLVES DEFEATED.  With much labour and skill had the Davidsons and McKa=
ys erected=20

two timber cottages side by side in the land of their adoption.  These two =
families were among the=20

first band of settlers.  They were very different in character--one being H=
ighland, the other Lowland=20

Scotch, but they were more or less united by sympathy, intermarriage, and l=
ong residence beside=20

each other on the slopes of the Grampian Hills, so that, on the voyage out,=
 they made a compact=20

that they should stick by each other, and strive, and work, and fight the b=
attle of life together in the=20

new land.  All the members of the Davidson family were sterling, sedate, he=
arty, and thorough-

going.  Daniel and Peter were what men style "dependable" fellows, and bore=
 strong resemblance=20

to their father, who died almost immediately after their arrival in the new=
 country.  Little Jessie was=20

like her mother, a sort of bottomless well of sympathy, into which oceans o=
f joy or sorrow might be=20

poured without causing an overflow-- except, perchance, at the eyelids--and=
 out of which the=20

waters of consolation might be pumped for evermore without pumping dry.  Th=
e idea of self never=20

suggested itself in the presence of these two.  The consequence was that ev=
erybody adored them.=20

It was rather a selfish adoration, we fear, nevertheless it was extremely d=
elightful--to the adorers,=20



we mean--and doubtless not unpleasant to the adored.  The love of God, in C=
hrist, was the=20

foundation of their characters.  Of the McKay family we cannot speak so con=
fidently.  Elspie,=20

indeed, was all that could be desired, and Fergus was in all respects a ste=
rling man; but the head=20

of the family was, as we have seen, open to improvement in many respects, a=
nd Duncan junior=20

was of that heart-breaking character which is known as ne'er-do-weel.  Poss=
ibly, if differently=20

treated by his father, he might have been a better man.  As it was, he was =
unprincipled and hasty=20

of temper.  Little wonder that, when thrown together during a long voyage--=
to an almost unknown=20

land--Elspie McKay and Daniel Davidson should fall into that condition whic=
h is common to all=20

mankind, and less wonder that, being a daring youth with a resolute will, D=
aniel should manage to=20

induce the pliant, loving Elspie, to plight her troth while they were gazin=
g over the ship's side at the=20

first iceberg they met.  We may as well hark back here a little, and very b=
riefly sketch the incident.=20

It may serve as a guide to others.  The two were standing--according to the=
 report of the bo's'n,=20

who witnessed the whole affair--"abaft the main shrouds squintin' over the =
weather gangway."  We=20

are not quite sure of the exact words used by that=20


_
seek his fortune in Paris where his talents and erudition would ensure him =
a good place in the=20

present mad rush for equality amongst all men. Certain it is that he did no=
t return and that with=20

merciless hate and vengeful relentlessness M. le duc de Kernogan had Jean A=
det hanged for a=20

supposed crime said to be committed by his son.  Jean Adet died protesting =
his innocence. But=20

the outburst of indignation and revolt aroused by this crying injustice was=
 swamped by the torrent=20

of the revolution which, gathering force by these very acts of tyranny and =
of injustice, soon swept=20

innocent and guilty alike into a vast whirlpool of blood and shame and tear=
s.     discreditable=20

bo's'n, but these are something like them.  It was moon-light and dead calm=
; therefore propitious,=20

so far, to Daniel's design--for Daniel undoubtedly had a design that night,=
 obvious to his own mind,=20

and clearly defined like the great iceberg, though, like it too, somewhat h=
azy in detail.  "What a=20

glorious, magnificent object!" exclaimed Elspie, gazing in wonder at the be=
rg, the pinnacles of=20

which rose considerably above the mast-head.  "Yes, very glorious, very mag=
nificent!" said Daniel,=20

gazing into the maiden's eyes, and utterly regardless of the berg.  "I wond=
er how such a huge=20

mass ever manages to melt," said Elspie--for the human mind,=20


_
CHAPTER I  THE MOOR   I  Silence. Loneliness. Desolation.  And the darkness=
 of late afternoon=20

in November, when the fog from the Bristol Channel has laid its pall upon m=
oor and valley and hill:=20

the last grey glimmer of a wintry sunset has faded in the west: earth and s=
ky are wrapped in the=20

gloomy veils of oncoming night. Some little way ahead a tiny light flickers=
 feebly.  "Surely we=20

cannot be far now."  "A little more patience, Mounzeer. Twenty minutes and =
we be there."=20

"Twenty minutes, mordieu. And I have ridden since the morning. And you tell=
 me it was not far."=20

"_I_ wonder it does not melt at once," said Dan, with pointed emphasis.  "W=
hat do you mean?"=20

she asked, turning her eyes in considerable astonishment from the berg to t=
he man.  "I mean,"=20

said he, "that under the influence of your eyes the iceberg ought to melt s=
traight away.  They have=20

melted my heart, Elspie, and _That_ has been an iceberg, I find, till now."=
  He seized her hand.  It=20

had all come on so suddenly that poor Elspie was quite unprepared for it.  =
She turned as if to fly,=20

but Daniel put his arm round her waist and detained her.  "Elspie, dearest =
Elspie, it=20
