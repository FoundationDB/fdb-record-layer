distinguished men he called about him. His fame does not rest on any one qu=
ality, but on a=20

wonderful union and blending of qualities, in which there was none that det=
racted at all from the=20

confidence and admiration the whole inspired. Those who think there can be =
no true greatness,=20

where there is nothing dazzling, startling; those who are smitten with a fo=
olish admiration of=20

heroes, may pronounce his character tame and commonplace; but much of this =
appearance=20

originates in what really constitutes the chief glory of his character; its=
 exact proportions, its perfect=20

harmony. Above all, there was his sacred regard to principle, and the solem=
n resolve with which=20

he devoted himself to the service of his country, that gave a moral finish =
and sublimity to his=20

character, and makes us speak of him, as we speak of religion. Yes, we can =
hardly stand in the=20

presence of that noble form in the almost speaking marble, without somethin=
g of the feeling with=20

which the pagans were impressed, when they stood before the statues of thei=
r gods. You have=20

done well to place it where it is; for there is something in that look, whi=
ch a make himself=20

agreeable to the ladies at Lindores. Both of the strangers, thus caught in =
the net of difficulties and=20

dangers which surrounded their old comrade, resented it more or less; but w=
hat could they do?=20

Edith took no further part in the consultation. She retired behind her moth=
er, whose arm she=20

continued to hold firm and fast in both her hands. When she was moved by th=
e talk going on at her=20

side she grasped that arm tightly, which was her only sign of emotion, but =
for the rest retired into=20

the darkness where no one could see, and into herself, a still more effectu=
al retirement. Lady=20

Lindores felt that her daughter's two hands clasping her were like a sort o=
f anchor which Edith had=20

thrown out in her shipwreck to grasp at some certainty. She bore the pressu=
re with a half smile=20

and sigh. She too had felt the shipwreck with keen passion, still more seri=
ous than that of Edith:=20

but she had no one to anchor to. She felt this, half with a grateful sense =
of what she herself was=20

still good for; but still more, perhaps, with that other personal sense whi=
ch comes to most--that=20

with all the relationships of life=20


_
being reminded of his obligation to go, and do likewise.  One of the worst =
tendencies of our=20

political dissensions is, that they make us indifferent or blind to the per=
sonal qualifications of the=20

candidates for office. I am aware that parties are to be expected in a free=
 country; and that they=20

answer many useful and important ends, particularly by being a watch and ch=
eck on one another,=20

so as to prevent the party in power from abusing that power. I know, too, t=
hat where a party is=20

founded on a real difference of opinion on important national questions, no=
 one mother and wife,=20

she, for all solace and support, was like most of us virtually alone.     C=
HAPTER XXXV.   "Your=20

master is just a young fool. Why, in the name of a' that's reasonable," cri=
ed Mr Monypenny, "did he=20

not send for me?"  "Sir," said Rolls, "you're too sensible a man not to kno=
w that the last thing a lad=20

is likely to do is what's reasonable, especially when he's in that flurry, =
and just furious at being=20

blamed."  Mr Monypenny was walking up and down his business room with much =
haste and=20

excitement. His house was built on the side of a slope, so that=20


_
difference, except, perhaps, in great emergencies which can seldom occur, t=
hreatening the very=20

existence of the state. Party, however, becomes faction, a mischievous and =
unprincipled faction,=20

when the great national interests are forgotten, and the canvass at electio=
ns is made to turn on=20

points which have nothing to do with the questions, Is he honest? Is he cap=
able? There is no=20

danger to this country so long as a free and unbiassed expression of public=
 sentiment governs; but=20

there is danger, and great danger, if every thing is to be done by party, a=
nd if the impulse of party=20

is to be given by a few hollow and artful men. It is not to be denied that =
many men, who would not=20

have attracted a moment's attention from any fair view of their natural or =
acquired abilities, have=20

yet been drawn into the lists by party considerations solely, and elevated =
to high and responsible=20

posts, merely that they might expose their incompetency, and disgrace the n=
ation. Can it be that=20

the people are deceived; that the virtue and intelligence of the people, of=
 which we hear so much,=20

are deceived? Do they not consider in such cases, do they not know, that th=
ey are the=20

instruments, the mere tools of ambitious and intriguing demagogues; who are=
 seeking, in this way,=20

to avail room, which was level with the road on one side, was elevated on t=
he upper floor at the=20

other, and consequently had the advantage of a view bounded, as was general=
, by "that eternal=20

Tinto," as he was in the habit of calling it. The good man, greatly disturb=
ed by what he heard,=20

walked to his window and stared out as Rolls spoke. And he shook his fist a=
t the distant object of=20

so many troubles. "Him and his big house and his ill ways--they've been the=
 trouble of the country-

side those fifteen years and more," cried the excited "man of business"; "a=
nd now we're not done=20

with him, even when he's dead."  "Far from done with him," said Rolls, shak=
ing his head. He was=20

seated on the edge of a chair with his hat in his lap and a countenance of =
dismay. "If I might make=20

so bold as to ask," he said, "what would ye say, sir, would be done if the =
worst came to the worst?=20

I'm no' saying to Mr Erskine indiveedually," added Rolls--"for it's my beli=
ef he's had nothing ado=20

with it--but granting that it's some person and no mere accident----"  "How=
 can I tell--or any man?"=20

said Mr Monypenny. "It depends entirely on the nature of the act. It's all =
supposition, so far as I=20

can see. To pitch Pat Torrance over the Scaur, him and his big horse, with =
murderous intent, is=20

more than=20

and turn them to selfish and sinister purposes?  The manner in which the ch=
aracters of our public=20

men are treated, is another practice likely to disgust the virtuous and hig=
h minded with the service;=20

end induce them to withdraw altogether. It is necessary to our liberties, I=
 admit, that a jealous and=20

vigilant watch should be kept on the conduct of men in power. But it is not=
 necessary, I am sure,=20

that that mighty engine the press, on both sides, instead of endeavoring to=
 enlighten the=20

community by a fair and manly discussion of the great questions at issue, s=
hould teem with=20

nothing but gross personalities, and vulgar and And there was no quarrel or=
 motive. Culpable=20

homicide----"  "That'll be what the English gentleman called manslaughter."=
  "Manslaughter is a=20

wide word. It would all depend on the circumstances. A year; maybe six mont=
hs only----If it were to=20

turn out so--which I do not for a moment believe----" said Mr Monypenny, fi=
xing his eyes upon=20

Rolls with a determination which betrayed internal feebleness of belief.  "=
Nor me, sir--nor me!"=20

cried Rolls, with the same look. They were like two conspirators regarding =
each other with the=20

consciousness of the plot, which, even between themselves, each eyeing the =
other, they were=20

determined to=20
