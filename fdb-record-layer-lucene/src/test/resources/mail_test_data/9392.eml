Soudan provinces; the principal stations were Khartoum, Cassala, and Dongola. Cassala was 

close to the Abyssinian frontier, and within from fifteen to twenty days' march of Souakim, on the 

Red Sea, to which reinforcements could be despatched in five days from Cairo. Khartoum had the 

advantage of the Blue Nile, that was navigable for steamers and sailing vessels as far south as 

Fazogle, from which spot, as well as from Gallabat, Abyssinia could be invaded; while swarms of 

Arabs, including the celebrated Hamrans, the Beni Amer, Hallongas, Hadendowas, Shookeriahs, 

and Dabainas, could be slipped like greyhounds across the frontier. Abyssinia is entirely at the 

mercy of Egypt.  Moosa Pasha subsequently started with several thousand men to drive the 

Abyssinians from Gallabat, which position they had occupied in force with the avowed intention of 

marching upon Khartoum; but upon the approach of the Egyptians they fell back rapidly across the 

mountains, without a sign of showing fight. The Egyptians would not follow them, as they feared 

the intervention of the European powers.  Upon our first arrival in Khartoum, from 11th June until 

early in October, the heat was very oppressive, the heart of heat, and fanned by a pretty stiff 

breeze into ungovernable fury--yet it was as nothing to the fire that raged in Ned's bosom.  If he 

had hated his wife, or been indifferent to her, he would in all probability, like too many husbands, 

have sought for congenial society elsewhere, and would have been harsh to her when obliged to 

be at home. But Ned loved his wife, and would have made any sacrifice, if by so doing, he could 

have smoothed her into a more congenial spirit.  When, therefore, he found that his utmost efforts 

were of no avail, and that he was perpetually goaded, and twitted, and tweaked for every little 

trifle, his spirit was set alight--as he at last remarked in confidence to David Clazie--and all the fire-

engines in Europe, Asia, Africa and America couldn't put it out.  The dry-salter's premises seemed 

to have been set on fire for poor Ned's special benefit that night.  They suited his case exactly. 

There was more than the usual quantity of smoke to suffocate, and fire to roast, him.  There was 

considerable danger too, so that the daring men of the brigade were in request--if we may say that 

of a brigade in which _all_ the men were daring--and Ned had congenial

below 95 degrees Fahr. in the shade, and frequently 100 degrees, while the nights were 82 

degrees Fahr. In the winter, the temperature was agreeable, the shade 80 degrees, the night 62 

degrees Fahr. But the chilliness of the north wind was exceedingly dangerous, as the sudden 

gusts checked the perspiration, and produced various maladies, more especially fever. I had been 

extremely fortunate, as, although exposed to hard work for more than a year in the burning sun, I 

had remarkably good health, as had my wife likewise, with the exception of one severe attack 

while at Sofi. Throughout the countries we had visited, the temperature was proverbial meeting of 

Greek with Greek was mere child's play to this meeting of fire with fire.  The inflamed Ned and the 

blazing dry-salter met in mortal conflict, and the result was tremendous!  It made his brother 

firemen stand aghast with awful admiration, to observe the way in which Ned dashed up tottering 

staircases, and along smoke-choked passages, where lambent flames were licking about in 

search of oxygen to feed on, and the way in which he hurled down brick walls and hacked through 

wood partitions, and tore up fir-planking and seized branch and hose, and, dragging them into 

hole-and-corner places, and out upon dizzy beams, and

about 90 degrees in the shade from May until the end of September; but the nights were generally 

about 70 degrees, with the exception of the winter months, from November until February, when 

the thermometer generally fell to 85 degrees Fahr. in the day, and sometimes as low as 58 

degrees at between 2 and 5 A.M.  I shall not repeat a minute description of Khartoum that has 

already been given in the "Albert N'yanza;" it is a wretchedly unhealthy town, containing about 

thirty thousand inhabitants, exclusive of troops. In spite of its unhealthiness and low situation, on a 

level with the river at the junction of the Blue and White Niles, it is the general emporium for the 

trade of the Soudan, from which the productions of the country it hissed again.  It was a fine 

example of the homoeopathic principle that "like cures like;" for the fire in Ned's bosom did 

wonders that night in the way of quenching the fire in the dry-salter's warehouse.  When this had 

gone on for an hour, and the fire was at its height, Ned, quite exhausted, descended to the street, 

and, sitting down on the pavement, leaned against a rail.  "If you goes on like that, Ned," said Bob 

Clazie, coming up to him, "you'll bust yourself."  "I wish I could," said Ned.  At that moment, Bob's 

brother David came towards them with the brandy bottle.  "Have a glass, Ned, you need it," said 

David.  Ned, although not a teetotaller, was one of the men who did not require spirits, and 

therefore seldom took
