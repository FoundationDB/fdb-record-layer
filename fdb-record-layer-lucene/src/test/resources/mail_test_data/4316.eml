that he would not leave his=20

country, he slit his nostrils, laughing       as though he were only giving=
 him a pinch. 12.12. This=20

lost soul lauded himself, and shamelessly boasted before a       venerable =
monk that he tried his=20

best to get many Indian women with       child, because when they were preg=

price on       selling them for slaves. 13.13. In this kingdom, or possibly=
 in a province of New Spain,=20

a Spaniard       went hunting game, or rabbits, with his dogs; one day, not=
 finding       anything to=20

hunt, it seemed to him that the dogs were hungry, so he       seized a litt=
le child from its mother=20

and cut off its arms and legs       with a dagger, giving each dog its port=
ion and when they had=20

eaten       these pieces he threw that little body on the ground for all of=
 them       together. 14.14.=20

when       all the infernal tyrants had left, eager for and blinded by the =
      riches of Peru, Fray=20

Jacomo proceeded, with four monks of his Order       of St. Francis, to tha=
t kingdom, to pacify it,=20

and to preach and       bring to Jesus Christ the remnant of people left fr=
om the infernal=20

harvesting and the tyrannical massacres committed by the Spaniards       du=
ring seven years; and=20

I think that these monks went there in the       year thirty-four. 16.16. T=

Indians from the province of Mexico as       messengers, to inquire whether=

em news of the one       only=20

God, who is God and true Lord of all the world. 17.17. They [the Indians] a=

In the reign of George II the clock again grew in stature. Its portability =
was evidently not a=20

necessity. It cannot be now said to resemble a carriage clock. Chamber cloc=
ks became definite=20

objects of decorative utility as part of the domestic fitments of a room. T=
he architectural ornament=20

becomes pronounced, and there is a massive grandeur about the cases which s=
uited the early=20

Georgian mansions and Hogarthian furniture of the period. These eight-day s=
triking and alarum=20

clocks had become a feature of the English home. The fine provincial exampl=
e by John Page, of=20

Ipswich, is 24 inches high and 12-1/4 inches wide. In addition to the four =
terminals there is a fifth at=20

the apex on a column with supporting metal ornament. The adjacent clock by =
Godfrey Poy, in date=20

1745, has at the apex a small figure of Ajax. In both these examples there =
are rings at the side as=20

ornaments, or possibly for use to lift the clock in lieu of the older style=
 of the handle at the top (p.=20

187).  In the reign of George III (1760-1820) the table clock shows greater=
 variety. It was a restless=20

time, filled with wars and political struggles--a reign notable for the Ame=
rican Declaration of=20

Independence on 4th July 1776, for the beginning of the French Revolution i=
n 1789, for the=20

"darkest hour in English history," the planned invasion of England by Frenc=
h and Spanish fleets,=20

and contemplated invasion of Ireland by the Dutch fleet. In this reign, too=
, there came what may be=20

termed the industrial revolution due to the introduction of machinery and s=
team-power. The=20

growing wealth of the middle classes demanded more luxurious furniture. Mer=
chants and=20

manufacturers, shipowners and traders with India and the East, Lancashire c=
otton-spinners and=20

mill-owners founded a new plutocracy. Bristol and Liverpool traders in "bla=
ckbirds," as the=20



iniquitous slave trade was impiously termed, amassed fortunes. Although Pit=
t advocated the=20

emancipation of slaves, under his rule "the English slave trade more than d=
oubled."  [Illustration:=20

orders that no more Spaniards except the monks were to be allowed to       =
enter the country, nor=20

should the Indians suffer any harm from the       Christians. 19.19. The fr=
iars, as is their custom,=20

preached to those people the gospel       of Christ, and the holy intention=
s of the king of Spain=20

towards       them.  With such love and pleasure did they receive the doctr=
ine and       example of=20

the monks, and so greatly did they rejoice over the news       of the kings=
 of Castile, of whom in all=20

rom France, and is a=20

forerunner, in its departure from the square case, of the style which Shera=
ton, in his adaptation=20

from the French, made at a later date.  =3DCompetition with French Elaborat=
