 was Dr. Droon, a=20

zoologist. He had been tuned in on Telzey's newscast interview on the liner=
 the night before, and=20

wondered whether Telzey would care to discuss Tick-Tock with him.  "Frankly=
, no," Telzey said.=20

Dr. Droon came awake and gave Telzey a surprised look. Halet smiled easily.=
  "My niece doesn't=20

intend to be discourteous, doctor," she explained.  [Illustration]  "Of cou=
rse not," the zoologist=20

agreed doubtfully.  "It's just," Halet went on, "that Telzey is a little, o=
h, sensitive where Tick-Tock is=20

concerned. In her own way, she's attached to the animal. Aren't you, dear?"=
  "Yes," Telzey said=20

blandly.  "Well, we hope this isn't going to disturbed you too much, dear."=
 Halet glanced=20

significantly at Dr. Droon. "Dr. Droon, you must understand, is simply doin=

 stir in the room. Lady St.=20

Aldegonde and her sisters approached the piano, at which was seated the emi=
nent professor. A=20

note was heard, and there was silence. The execution was exquisite; and, in=
deed, there are few=20

things more dainty than the blended voices of three women. No one seemed to=
 appreciate the=20

performance more than Mrs. Campian, who, greatly attracted by what was taki=
ng place, turned a=20

careless ear, even to the honeyed sentences of no less a personage than the=
 lord-bishop.  After=20

an interval Lady Corisande was handed to the piano by Lothair. She was in f=
ine voice, and sang=20

with wonderful effect. Mrs. Campian, who seemed much interested, softly ros=

outward circle of the group which had gathered round the instrument. When t=

Telzey transferred her gaze back to the zoologist. Dr. Droon cleared his th=
roat. "I, ah, understand,=20

Miss Amberdon, that you're unaware of what kind of creature your, ah, Tick-=
Tock is?"  Telzey=20

started to speak, then checked herself, frowning. She had been about to sta=
te that she knew=20

exactly what kind of creature TT was ... but she didn't, of expressed her h=
ope that Mrs. Campian=20

would now favor them. It was not becoming to refuse when others had contrib=
uted so freely to the=20

general entertainment, but Theodora was anxious not to place herself in com=
petition with those=20

who had preceded her. Looking over a volume of music, she suggested to Lady=
