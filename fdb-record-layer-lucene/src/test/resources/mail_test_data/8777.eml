that the Spaniards, wounded to the death, were dying game (after the fashio=

Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, el Gran Capitan, Cortes (not at the siege of Mexico=

before Algiers) came up before me, and I thought on the long warfare, exten=
ding over seven=20

hundred years, by which Spain saved the southern half of Europe from the Mo=
ors; upon Gerona,=20

Zaragoza, and, most of all, upon Cervera, last of the Quixotes, Vara de Rey=
, Linares, and the poor=20

peasants from Galician hills, thyme-scented wastes in Lower Aragon, Asturia=
n mountains, and=20

Estremenian oak-woods, who, battling against superior numbers, short of foo=
d, of ammunition,=20

and bereft of hope, were proving their descent from the grim soldiers of th=

the Middle Ages, and making the invaders of their country pay for their pir=
acy in blood.  Blood is=20

hoop, light it, and the balloon=20

colored tissue-paper, and=20
