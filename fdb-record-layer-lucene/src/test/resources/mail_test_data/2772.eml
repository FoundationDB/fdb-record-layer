release from the savages?"  Fearless Frank leaned up against the tree which had been used as 

the torture-stake, and related what is already known to the reader.  When he had finished, the 

rescued captive seized his hand between both her own, and thanked him warmly.  "Had it not 

been for you, sir, no one but our God knows what would have been my fate. Oh! sir, what can I do, 

more than to thank you a thousand times, to repay you for the great service you have rendered 

me?"  "Nothing, lady; nothing that I think of at present. Was it not my duty, while I had the power, 

to free you from the hands of those barbarians? Certainly it was, and I deserve no thanks. But tell 

me, what is your name, and were your friends all killed in the train from which you were taken?"  "I 

had no friends, sir, save a lady whose acquaintance I made on the journey out from Cheyenne. As 

to my name--you can call me Miss Terry."  "Mystery!" in blank amazement.  "Yes;" with a gay 

laugh--"Mystery, if you choose. My name is Alice Terry."  "Oh!" and the it for you if I can."  It was 

hard for the boy to believe his own senses.  But picking up a pen he wrote: "Ralph Waldo 

Emerson, Concord; November 22, 1881."  Emerson looked at it, and said mournfully: "Thank you." 

Then he picked up the pen, and writing the single letter "R" stopped, followed his finger until it 

reached the "W" of Waldo, and studiously copied letter by letter!  At the word "Concord" he 

seemed to hesitate, as if the task were too great, but finally copied again, letter by letter, until the 

second "c" was reached.  "Another 'o,'" he said, and interpolated an extra letter in the name of the 

town which he had done so much to make famous the world over.  When he had finished he 

handed back the book, in which there was written:  [Illustration: Ralph Waldo Emerson's 

signature.]  The boy put the book into his pocket; and as he did so Emerson's eye caught the slip 

on his desk, in the boy's handwriting, and, with a smile of absolute enlightenment, he turned and 

said;  "You wish me to write my name?  With pleasure. 


_
Mystery! ha! ha! good joke. I shall call you the latter. Have you friends and relatives East?"  "No. I 

came West to meet my father, who is somewhere in the Black Hills."  "Do you know at what 

place?"  "I do not."  "I fear it will be a hard matter to find him, then. The Hills now have a floating 

population of about twenty-five thousand souls. Your father would be one to find out of that lot."  A 

faint smile came over the girl's face. "I should know papa among fifty thousand, if necessary;" she 

said, "although I have not seen him for years."  She failed to mention how many, or what 

peculiarities she would recognize him by. Was he blind, deaf or dumb?  Fearless Frank glanced 

around him, and saw that a path rugged and steep led up to the prairie above.  "Come," he said, 

offering his arm, "we will get up to the plains and go."  "Where to?" asked Miss Terry, rising with 

an effort. The welts across her back were swollen and painful.  "Deadwood is my destination. I can 

deviate my course, however, if it will accommodate you."  "Oh! no; you must not inconvenience 

yourself on my account. I am of little or no consequence, you know."  She leaned upon his arm, 

and they ascended the path to the plain above.  Frank's horse was grazing near by where the 

scarlet youth had taken his unceremonious tumble.  Off to the north-west a cloud of dust rose 

heavenward, and he rightly conjectured that it hid from view the chieftain, Sitting Bull, and his 

warriors.  His thoughts reverting to his companion, "General" Nix, and the train of Charity Joe, he 

glanced toward where he had last seen them.  Neither were to be seen, now. Probably Nix had 

rejoined the train, and it was out of eye-shot behind a swell in the plains.  "Were you looking for 

some one?" Alice asked, looking into her rescuer's face.  "Yes, I was with a train when I first heard 

your cries; I left the boys, and came to investigate. I guess they have gone on without me."  "How 

mean of them! Will we have to make the journey to the Hills alone?"  "Yes, unless we should 

providentially fall in with a train or be overtaken by a stage."  "Are you not afraid?"  "My cognomen 

is Fearless Frank, lady; you can draw conclusions from that."  He went and caught the horse, 

arranged a blanket in the saddle so that she could ride side-fashion, and assisted her to mount. 

The sun was touching the lips of the horizon with a golden kiss; more time than Frank had 

supposed' had elapsed since he left the train.  Far off toward the east shadows were hugging 

close behind the last lingering rays of sunlight; a couple of coyotes were sneaking into view a few 

rods away; birds were winging homeward; a perfume-laden breeze swept down from the Black 

Hills, and fanned the pink cheeks of Alice Terry into a vivid glow.  "We cannot go far," said Frank, 

thoughtfully, "before darkness will overtake us. Perhaps we had better remain in the canal, here, 

where there is both grass and water. In the morning we will take a fresh start."  The plan was 

adopted; they camped in the break, or "canal," near where Alice had been tortured.  Out of his 

saddle-bags Frank brought forth crackers, biscuit and dried venison; these, with clear sparkling 

water from the spring in the chaparral, made a meal good enough for anybody.  The night was 

warm; no fire was needed.  A blanket spread on the grass served as a resting-place for Alice; the 

strange youth in scarlet lay with his head resting against the side of his horse. The least 

movement of the animal, he said, would arouse him; he was keen of scent and quick to detect 

danger--meaning the horse.  The night passed away without incident; as early as four o'clock--

when it is daylight on the plains--Fearless Frank was astir.  Be found the rivulet flowing from the 

spring to abound with trout, and caught and dressed the morning meal.  Alice was awake by the 

time breakfast was ready. She bathed her face and hands in the stream, combed her long auburn 

hair through her fingers, and looked you?"  Overcome with astonishment, Edward mechanically 



handed him the album once more from his pocket.  Quickly turning over the leaves, Emerson 

picked up the pen, and pushing aside the slip, wrote without a moment's hesitation:  [Illustration: 

Ralph Waldo Emerson's second signature.]  The boy was almost dazed at the instantaneous 

transformation in the man!  Miss Alcott now grasped this moment to say: "Well, we must be going!" 

"So soon?" said Emerson, rising and smiling.  Then turning to Miss Alcott he said: "It was very kind 

of you, Louisa, to run over this morning and bring your young friend."  Then turning to the boy he 

said: "Thank you so much for coming to see me.  You must come over again while you are with 

the Alcotts.  Good morning!  Isn't it a beautiful day out?" he said, and as he shook the boy's hand 

there was a warm grasp in it, the fingers closed around those of the boy, and as Edward looked 

into those deep eyes they twinkled and smiled back.  The going was all so different from the 

coming.  The boy was grateful that his last impression was of a moment when the eye kindled and 

the hand pulsated.  The two walked back to the Alcott home in an almost unbroken silence. Once 

Edward ventured to remark:  "You can have no idea, Miss Alcott, how grateful I am to you."  "Well, 

my boy," she answered, "Phillips Brooks may be right: that it is something to have seen him even 

so, than not to have seen him at all. But to us it is so sad, so very sad.  The twilight is gently 

closing in."  And so it proved--just five months afterward.  Eventful day after eventful day followed 

in Edward's Boston visit.  The following morning he spent with Wendell Phillips, who presented 

him with letters from William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Mott, and other famous persons; and then, 

writing a letter of introduction to Charles Francis Adams, whom he enjoined to give the boy 

autograph letters from his two presidential forbears, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, sent 

Edward on his way rejoicing.  Mr. Adams received the boy with equal graciousness and liberality. 

Wonderful letters from the two Adamses were his when he left.  And then, taking the train for New 

York, Edward Bok went home, sitting up all night in a day-coach for the double purpose of saving 

the cost of a sleeping-berth and of having a chance to classify and clarify the events of the most 

wonderful week in his life!     CHAPTER VII  A PLUNGE INTO WALL STREET  The father of 

Edward Bok passed away when Edward was eighteen years of age, and it was found that the 

amount of the small insurance left behind would barely cover the funeral expenses.  Hence the 

two boys faced the problem of supporting the mother on their meagre income. They determined to 

have but one goal: to put their mother back to that life of comfort to which she had been brought 

up and was formerly accustomed.  But that was not possible on their income.  It was evident that 

other employment must be taken on during the evenings.  The city editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_ 

had given Edward the assignment of covering the news of the theatres; he was to ascertain 

"coming attractions" and any other dramatic items of news interest.  One Monday evening, when a 

multiplicity of events crowded the reportorial corps, Edward was delegated to "cover" the Grand 

Opera House, where Rose Coghlan was to appear in a play that had already been seen in 

Brooklyn, and called, therefore, for no special dramatic criticism.  Yet _The Eagle_ wanted to 

cover it.  It so happened that Edward had made another appointment for that evening which he 

considered more important, and yet not wishing to disappoint his editor he accepted the 

assignment. He had seen Miss Coghlan in the play; so he kept his other engagement, and without 

approaching the theatre he wrote a notice to the effect that Miss Coghlan acted her part, if 

anything, with greater power than on her previous Brooklyn visit, and so forth, and handed it in to 

his city editor the next 


_
thought Fearless Frank.  "The day promises to be delightful, does it not?" she remarked, as she 

seated herself to partake of the repast.  "Exactly. Autumn months are ever enjoyable in the West." 

The meal dispatched, no delay was made in leaving the place.  Fearless Frank strode along 

beside his horse and its fair rider, chatting pleasantly, and at the same time making a close 

observation of his surroundings. He knew he was in parts frequented by both red and white 

savages, and it would do no harm to keep on one's guard.  They traveled all day and reached 

Sage creek at sunset.  Here they remained over night, taking an early start on the succeeding 

morning.  That day they made good progress, in consequence of Frank's purchase of a horse at 

Sage creek from some friendly Crow Indians, and darkness overtook them at the mouth of Red 

Canyon, where they went into camp.  By steady pushing they reached Rapid creek the next night, 

for no halt was made at Custer City, and for the first time since leaving the torture-ground, camped 

with a miner's family. As yet no cabins or shanties had been erected here, canvas tents serving in 

the stead; to-day there are between fifty and a hundred wooden structures.  Alice was charmed 

with the wild grandeur of the mountain scenery--with the countless acres of blossoms and 

flowering shrubs--with the romantic and picturesque surroundings in general, and was very 

emphatic in her praises.  One  Unfortunately, however, Miss Coghlan had been taken ill just before 

the raising of the curtain, and, there being no understudy, no performance had been given and the 

audience dismissed.  All this was duly commented upon by the New York morning newspapers. 

Edward read this bit of news on the ferry-boat, but his notice was in the hands of the city editor. 

On reaching home that evening he found a summons from _The Eagle_, and the next morning he 

received a rebuke, and was informed that his chances with the paper were over.  The ready 

acknowledgment and evident regret of the crestfallen boy, however, appealed to the editor, and 

before the end of the week he called the boy to him and promised him another chance, provided 

the lesson had sunk in.  It had, and it left a lasting impression.  It was always a cause of profound 

gratitude with Edward Bok that his first attempt at "faking" occurred so early in his journalistic 

career that he could take the experience to heart and profit by it.  One evening when Edward was 

attending a theatrical performance, he noticed the restlessness of the women in the audience 

between the acts. In those days it was, even more than at present, the custom for the men to go 

out between the acts, leaving the women alone.  Edward looked at the programme in his hands.  It 

was a large eleven-by-nine sheet, four pages, badly printed, with nothing in it save the cast, a few 

advertisements, and an 


_
and when night again overtook them, they rode into the bustling, noisy, homely metropolis--

Deadwood, magic city of the North-west.     CHAPTER VI.  ONLY A SNAKE--LOCATING A MINE. 

Harry Redburn hurried off toward the cabin, which was some steps away. In Anita's scream there 

were both terror and affright.  Walsingham Nix, the hump-backed, bow-legged explorer and 

prospecter hobbled after him, using his staff for support.  He had heard the scream, but years' 

experience among the "gals" taught him that a feminine shriek rarely, if ever, meant anything. 

Redburn arrived at the cabin in a few flying bounds, and leaped into the kitchen.  There, crouched 

upon the floor in one corner, all in a little heap, pale, tumbling and terrified, was Anita. Before her, 

squirming along over the sand-scrubbed floor, evidently disabled by a blow, was mechanically 

folded the programme, turned it long side up and wondered whether a programme of this smaller 

size, easier to handle, with an attractive cover and some reading-matter, would not be profitable. 

When he reached home he made up an eight-page "dummy," pasted an attractive picture on the 

cover, indicated the material to go inside, and the next morning showed it to the manager of the 

theatre.  The programme as issued was an item of considerable expense to the management; 

Edward offered to supply his new programme without cost, provided he was given the exclusive 

right, and the manager at once accepted the offer.  Edward then sought a friend, Frederic L. 

Colver, who had a larger experience in publishing and advertising, with whom he formed a 

partnership.  Deciding that immediately upon the issuance of their first

enormous black-snake.  It was creeping away instead of toward Anita, leaving a faint trail of 

crimson in its wake; yet the young girl's face was blanched with fear.  "You screamed at that?" 

demanded Redburn, pointing to the coiling serpent.  "Ugh! yes; it is horrible."  "But, it is harmless. 

See: some one has given it a blow across the back, and it is theatres, Edward proceeded to 

secure the exclusive rights to them all. The two young publishers solicited their advertisements on 

the way to and from business mornings and evenings, and shortly the first smaller-sized theatre 

programme, now in use in all theatres, appeared. The venture was successful from the start, 

returning a comfortable profit each
