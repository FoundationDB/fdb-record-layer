was sufficiently advanced to teach with success. He united with the Church =
of the Disciples and=20

preached in that connection until 1859.[1] In some cases colored preachers =
were judged=20

sufficiently informed, not only to minister to the needs of their own congr=
egations, but to preach to=20

white churches. There was a Negro thus engaged in the State of Florida.[2] =
Another colored man=20

of unusual intelligence and much prominence worked his way to the front in =
Giles County,=20

Tennessee. In 1859 he was the pastor of a Hard-shell Baptist Church, the me=
mbership of which=20

was composed of the best white people in the community. He was so well prep=
ared for his work=20

that out of a four days' argument on baptism with a white minister he emerg=
ed victor. From this=20

appreciative congregation he received a salary of from six to seven hundred=
 dollars a year.[3]=20

[Footnote 1: Simmons, _Men of Mark_, p. 144.]  [Footnote 2: Bremer, _Homes =
of the New World_,=20

vol. ii., pp. 488-491.]  [Footnote 3: _The Richmond Enquirer_, July, 1859; =
and _Afr. Repository_,=20

vol. xxxv., p. 255.]  Statistics of this period show that the proportionate=
ly largest number of=20

Negroes who learned in spite of opposition were found among the Scotch-Iris=
h of Kentucky and=20

Tennessee. Possessing few slaves, and having no permanent attachment to the=
 institution, those=20

mountaineers did not yield to the reactionaries who were determined to keep=
 the Negroes in=20

heathendom. Kentucky and Tennessee did not expressly forbid the education o=
f the colored=20

people.[1] Conditions were probably better in Kentucky than in Tennessee. T=
raveling in Kentucky=20

about this time, Abdy was favorably impressed with that class of Negroes wh=
o though originally=20

slaves saved sufficient from their earnings to purchase their freedom and p=
rovide for the education=20

of their children.[2]  [Footnote 1: In 1830 one-twelfth of the population o=
f Lexington consisted of=20

free persons of color, who since 1822 had had a Baptist church served by a =
member of their own=20

race and a school in which thirty-two of their children were taught by a wh=
ite man from Tennessee.=20

He had pledged himself to devote the rest of his life to the uplift of his =
colored brethren. One of=20

these free Negroes in Lexington had accumulated wealth to the amount of $20=
,000. In Louisville,=20

also a center of free colored population, efforts were being made to educat=
e ambitious Negroes.=20

Travelers noted that colored schools were found there generations before th=
e Civil War and=20

mentioned the intelligent and properly speaking colored preachers, who were=
 bought and=20

supported by their congregations. Charles Dabney, another traveler through =
this State in 1837,=20

observed that the slaves of this commonwealth were taught to read and belie=
ved that they were=20

about as well off as they would have been had they been free. See Dabney, _=
Journal of a Tour=20

through the U.S. and Canada_, p. 185.]  [Footnote 2: Abdy, _Journal of a To=
ur_, etc., 1833-1834,=20

pp. 346-348.]  It was the desire to train up white men to carry on the work=
 of their liberal fathers=20

that led John G. Fee and his colaborers to establish Berea College in Kentu=
cky. In the charter of=20

this institution was incorporated the declaration that "God has made of one=
 blood all nations that=20

dwell upon the face of the earth." No Negroes were admitted to this institu=
tion before the Civil War,=20

but they came in soon thereafter, some being accepted while returning home =
wearing their=20

uniforms.[1] The State has since prohibited the co-education of the two rac=
es.  [Footnote 1:=20

Catalogue of Berea College, 1896-1897.]  The centers of this interest in th=
e mountains of=20

Tennessee were Maryville and Knoxville. trunks of trees laid one over the o=
ther, with the=20

interstices stuffed with moss. There was a church, also of wood, but larger=
 and better built, with a=20

bell suspended from a fine elm tree close to it. Two of the izbas were bett=
er than the rest, and=20

belonged, one to the starost, the other to the pope, or parish priest, Anna=
=E2=80=99s father. That of the=20



starost boasted a porch, with ornamental wooden pillars and quaint carvings=
. It had a substantial=20

chimney built of good bricks, and secure well-glazed windows to keep out th=
e intense cold of the=20

Russian winter. Indeed all the cottages were more comfortable than they loo=
ked.  Ivan entered,=20

and dutifully made his bow, as he had been taught to do, to the holy pictur=
e which hung in the=20

corner, with a lamp burning before it, since this was a feast-day. The cont=
ents of the izba were=20

extremely simple. The most conspicuous object was the stove, with a wide sh=
elf or platform over=20

it, upon which the family usually slept; a handsome carved chest contained =
the clothing used upon=20

festive occasions, and there were besides a few stools, a table, an arm-cha=
ir, and some wooden=20

cups, platters, and cooking utensils. The vapour-bath, that indispensable R=
ussian luxury, occupied=20

an outhouse.  An old woman stood over the fire, diligently stirring a capac=
ious caldron, from which=20

there issued a very savoury steam. The family the starost had to feed was n=
ot a small one,--three=20

grown-up sons, with the wife and child of one of them, found shelter beneat=
h his roof.  =E2=80=9CYou are=20

cooking tschi for our supper, mativshka,=E2=80=9D said Ivan.  =E2=80=9CAnd =
what better dish could I be cooking, my=20

! Why, every one knows who you=20

are. You are our dear little lord.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut whose son am I, m=
ativshka? That was what he wanted to=20

know.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAsk the father, boy, ask the father. As for me, wh=
y, =E2=80=98A word is not a bird: if it flies out,=20

you=E2=80=99ll never catch it again.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  Old Feodora would n=
ot have thought it any harm to put her nursling=20

off with a string of falsehoods, if they had occurred to her at the moment,=
 or if she had thought=20

them necessary; for these poor, =E2=80=9Cdimly-lighted souls=E2=80=9D had l=
ittle idea of the value of truth. But Ivan=E2=80=99s=20

history was now so much an =E2=80=9Copen secret=E2=80=9D in the village, th=
at she saw no reason why the boy=20

should not know it himself, since he was twelve years old, and very intelli=
gent. Still, she was afraid=20

to tell him anything without her husband=E2=80=99s knowledge and concurrenc=
e.  Soon afterwards the=20

starost came in--an imposing and venerable figure, his long, gray beard nea=
rly covering the breast=20

of his caftan. He would have parted with his head quite as readily as with =
that beard.  As soon as=20

he had made his reverence to the sacred picture, seated himself in his chai=
r by the stove, and=20

exchanged his formidable (and fragrant) boots of Russia leather for a pair =
of lapti, or bark slippers,=20

Ivan stood up before him, and put the question directly, =E2=80=9CBativshka=
, whose son am I?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGreat St.=20

Nicholas! what has come to the boy?=E2=80=9D the starost exclaimed; then he=
 looked perplexed, and=20

hesitated for an answer. His wife leaned over the back of his chair and sai=
d a few words in a low=20

voice, and a whispered discussion followed, during which Ivan waited patien=
tly. Presently Feodora=20

returned to her cooking; and the starost solemnly crossed his breast with t=
he thumb and two=20

fingers=20


_
of white persons interested in the elevation of the colored people. There d=
eveloped such an=20

antislavery sentiment in the former town that half of the students of the M=
aryville Theological=20

Seminary became abolitionists by 1841.[1] They were then advocating the soc=
ial uplift of Negroes=20

through the local organ, the _Maryville Intelligencer_. From this nucleus o=
f antislavery men=20

developed a community with ideals not unlike those of Berea.[2]  [Footnote =

 sit down at his feet.=20
