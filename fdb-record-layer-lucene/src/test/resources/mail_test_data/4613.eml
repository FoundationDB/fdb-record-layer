HILDA. No poetry? Then, so far as I can tell,     The Twentieth Century oug=
ht to suit you well....=20

I've an idea!    GIOCONDA. What is it?    HILDA.            This: that you =
    Show me how best you'd=20

like a man to woo.    GIOCONDA. I will, I will!    HILDA.            Imagin=
e, then, that I     Am she for=20

whom you say you'd gladly die.     This is my room at Baystead: that's the =
street:     You must=20

come in from there....     (_Leading her left._)                      and t=
hen we meet.    GIOCONDA. By=20

Holy Church, a pretty sport to play!     God shield you, Signorina Hilda Gr=
ay!      (_Exit left._)=20

HILDA. Now--what's the time? It must be half-past four.     It is. I'll giv=
e him just one minute more.=20

(_Looking at herself in a pocket-mirror, and making a toilet._)      Goodne=
ss! I do look horrid.... Will=20

he bring     An emerald or a pearl engagement-ring?     He comes! I'll take=
 pearls as a last resort.=20

(_Enter, left_, GIOCONDA _carrying a pipe and a walking-stick_.)    GIOCOND=
A. Well, and how=20

_are_ you? In the pink, old sport?    HILDA. I'm glad to see you, Harry. Do=
 sit down.=20

GIOCONDA. 'Some' heat to-day, what? Even here. In town     Perfectly awful.=
 Got a match?=20

(_She tries in vain to light the pipe from a match struck by_ HILDA.)      =
                I say,     Old=20

thing--you really look top-hole to-day.    HILDA. Well, naturally: I knew t=
hat you were coming.=20

(GIOCONDA _pulls at her pipe in silence, pokes the floor with her stick, an=
d shifts it from hand to=20

hand_.)      You're very quiet.    GIOCONDA (_with a start_).      Oh! what=
's that you're thumbing?=20

(_Goes over to_ HILDA _and looks over her shoulder_.)    HILDA. Addington S=
ymonds.=20

GIOCONDA.               Any good?    HILDA.                      Why--gorge=
ous!     You ought to read it--

all about the Borgias.    GIOCONDA. What are they? Oh, I see! I had enough =
    Up at the 'Varsity=20

of that sort of stuff.     I say--oh, blast the thing, this pipe's a dud! (=
_She puts the pipe           on the=20

table._)    HILDA. You smoke too much. They say it slows the blood,     And=
 _that_ you simply=20

can't afford.      (_Pause._)    GIOCONDA.                   I say----    H=
ILDA. Well, what?=20

GIOCONDA.                   You really look top-hole to-day.    HILDA. How =
nice! But flattery always=20

was your wont.      (_Pause._)    GIOCONDA. I say----    HILDA.            =
That's just it, Harry dear--

you don't.    GIOCONDA. I came to ask you something.... (_Producing a ring.=
_)                     Ever=20

seen     A ring like this? Not a bad sort of green.    HILDA (_taking it_).=
 Emeralds! I worship=20

emeralds. They enthrone     All the luxuriant summer in a stone.     Do let=
 me just see how it looks!=20

The third     Finger, I think, is generally preferred?     How splendid! Wo=
n't she be delighted?=20

GIOCONDA.         Who?    HILDA. Your dear Aunt Kate.    GIOCONDA.         =
I bought the thing for=20

you.    HILDA. Harry!    GIOCONDA.         _You_ know--a what-d'you-call-it=
 ring?    HILDA.=20

Engagement?    GIOCONDA.         That's the goods. And in the Spring     Th=

guinea. What about it?    HILDA. See, how it fits! I couldn't do without it=
.    GIOCONDA. Right-o!=20

Then, that's that: good. But if you carry     A diary, jot down, 'Next Spri=
ng, marry Harry'--     You=20

might forget. You keep a diary?    HILDA (_bringing a small diary from her =
bag_).      Look--     I did=20

blush--buying an engagement-book!    GIOCONDA. Well, how's the enemy? Good =
Lord! what a=20

shock!     D'you know, old bean, it's more than five o'clock?    HILDA. You=
'll have some tea?=20

GIOCONDA.         Can't. Sorry. Told two men     I'd play a foursome with t=
hem at 5.10.     You'd=20

better make the fourth.    HILDA.            I really can't.     There are =
some new delphiniums I=20

_must_ plant.    GIOCONDA (_going out, left_). See you to-morrow, then.    =
HILDA.            You'll=20

drive me frantic     If you're not just the teeniest bit romantic!    GIOCO=
NDA. It isn't done. You're=20

absolutely wrong     In asking me to do that stunt. So long!  (_She tosses =
the pipe and stick off,=20

left._)      There! Did I play it well? You'd be my wife?    HILDA (_sighin=
g_). My dear, you played=20



old Harry to the life--     His gaucherie....    GIOCONDA.         His nobl=
e self-command....    HILDA.=20

The way he shifts his cane from hand to hand....    GIOCONDA. A nervous tri=

much he feels....    HILDA. All I know is--I'd have a man who kneels     An=
d pours out passion in a=20

style as rippling     As the best Swinburne--or at least as Kipling.    GIO=
CONDA. Then I'll now be=20

_your_ lady. To your part--     Woo me as you'd be wooed!    HILDA.        =
    With all my heart!=20

(_Catching up her cloak, she flings it over her shoulder._)      Last Mirac=
le of the World, sainted,=20

adored,     Divine Gioconda--hear me, I beg!    GIOCONDA.         My lord! =
   HILDA. Dost know of=20

passion? Is that heart so pure     As not to guess what torments I endure  =
   Who for so long have=20

sighed for thee in vain?     And wilt thou have no pity on my pain?     Wil=
t thou still spurn me as a=20

thing abhorred     Whose only crime is to love thee?    GIOCONDA.         M=
y lord----    HILDA.=20

Stay! I will brook no answer. For thy sake     Did I not paint the town in =
crimson-lake?     Have I not=20

wrenched thee through thy nunnery-bars?     And bear I not some ninety-seve=
n scars     Taken as=20

I fought my way to thy fair feet?     Think how thy relatives rushed into t=
he street     To save thee--

how I put them to the sword     And left them strewn about in heaps!    GIO=
CONDA.         My lord---

-    HILDA. Had I a boy's light love when I, to win     Thy favour, cut off=
 all thy kith and kin?     Run=20

through the list! Measure my love by that!     Two great-grandfathers (one,=
 I own, was fat);     Five=20

brothers; fourteen uncles; half a score     Of nephews (and I dare say even=
 more);     A brace of=20

maiden-aunts; a second-cousin;     And family connections by the dozen.    =
 Does it not melt that=20

pitiless heart of ice     To see thyself secured at such a price?    GIOCON=
DA. My lord----    HILDA.=20

Or if indeed thy heart requires     Flame fiercer than my love's Etnaean fi=
res--     Ask what thou=20

wilt, but do not ask that I     Live on. Command me, rather, how to die.   =
  Say in what style thou'dst=20

have me perish here,     So that at least my ardour win one tear!     Choos=
e what thou wilt--I'll=20

execute thy charge--     Nor fear to speak: my repertoire is large.     I c=
an suspend myself upon a=20

rafter;     Fall on my blade, and die with horrid laughter;     Leap from a=
 height; read Bennett's=20

books; or swallow     Poison--and, mark you, with no sweet to follow.    GI=
OCONDA. My lord----=20

HILDA.            Thy choice is made?    GIOCONDA.                   My lor=
d----    HILDA.=20

Alack!    GIOCONDA. I have accepted thee ten minutes back.    HILDA. Then--=
I will deign to live.=20

My castle stands     Four-towered among its olive-silvered lands.     Away!=
 Away! Thou art all=20

heaven to me!  (_She drags_ GIOCONDA _right. They break._)    GIOCONDA. Won=
derful! That's=20

Pandolfo to a tee!    HILDA. I should adore him!    GIOCONDA.         And I=
 Harry, too     If only you=20

were I and I were you!     But soft! since here we stand beyond the range  =
   Of Time, why don't we=20

swop?    HILDA.            You mean 'exchange'?     Why not? We will!      =
(_Moving quickly, right._)=20

May Titian's age enfold me!    GIOCONDA. Stop! Stop! You can't go yet. You =
haven't told me=20

Where I can find the Twentieth Century.    HILDA (_leading her front, and p=
ointing to the=20

audience_). Then,     Behold its ladies and its gentlemen.    GIOCONDA. Wha=
t lovely people!... All=20

the same, you know,     They're not as I have pictured them.    HILDA.     =
       How so?=20

GIOCONDA. They're all so still.... And then--my fancy boggles     To see no=
t one who's wearing=20

motor-goggles.     How can I get among them?    HILDA.            You must =
jump     Down there.=20

GIOCONDA.         But that would mean a dreadful bump!    HILDA. You want t=
o go from fifteen-

sixty sheer     To nineteen-twenty. 'Tis a jump, my dear....     And so--fa=
rewell! I come, I come at=20

last--     O fire and sound and perfumes of the Past! (_She goes out quickl=
y,           right._)=20

GIOCONDA. Her eyes were green. However hard he tries,     Pandolfo never ca=
n resist green=20



eyes.     I know he'll die for her and not for me.     Why did I let her go=
? It shall not be!  (HILDA=20

_enters, right_.)    HILDA. It shall not be! Why did I let her go?     Harr=
y will love her more than me,=20

I know.     Gioconda!    GIOCONDA.         Hilda!    HILDA.            Some=
how, after all,     I can't let=20

Harry go beyond recall.     I think of his good heart: I know how proud    =
 I'll be to watch him=20

through a dusty cloud     When his new car, balanced upon one tire,     Rol=
ls roistering through the=20

lanes of Devonshire.    GIOCONDA. I too, fair friend, perceive with sudden =
terror     The greatness=20

of my momentary error.     I mustn't let you risk the enterprise....     Pa=
ndolfo never could endure=20

green eyes!    HILDA. Let us each make the best of her own age!    GIOCONDA=
. But sometimes=20

you will write me--just a page?    HILDA. I will indeed. And you?    GIOCON=
DA.                   And so=20

will I.     Hilda--farewell!    HILDA. Gioconda, dear--good-bye!  (_Standin=

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  1.A. By reading or using any remedie=
s, or protecting=20

against the consequences of severe injury by the use of ordinary antiseptic=
 dressings and=20

treatment, he would no doubt be liable for any resulting damage, and could =
not recover pay for his=20

service.  _Experiments Not to be Tried on Patients=E2=80=94This Rule Applie=
s to Charity Patients._=E2=80=94For=20

like reasons of public policy it has been held that a physician has no righ=
t to try experiments on his=20

patient.[167] In this respect a charity patient will be protected by law an=
d compensated for=20

damages received from experiments on his health and person, just as much as=
 a person from=20

whom a large fee could be expected. Humanity and public policy both forbid =
that experiments=20

should be tried upon one class of patients any more than another. However t=
his may be, in a case=20

of extreme danger, where other resorts have failed and everything else done=
 that could=20

reasonably be required, and if the patient and his family consent after ful=
l information of the=20

dangerous character of the operation, or the unknown qualities and powers o=
f the drug to be=20

administered, the practitioner would be justified and protected if some new=
 methods of treatment=20

not entirely developed or known to the profession, but supposed to be effic=
acious, should be=20

adopted, although the result might prove unfavorable. In such a case, howev=
er, it would be=20

extremely perilous for the physician to stand upon his own judgment alone. =
He should consult the=20

best talent in his profession available, and abide by the judgment of his c=
olleagues or a fair=20

majority of them; and even then should apply to his course of action the ma=
xim. When in doubt run=20

no risks; better let a patient perish from disease or injury, than while at=
tempting uncertain=20

experiments with the surgeon=E2=80=99s knife or the use of dangerous drugs.=
 The safe rule is to take no=20

chances, unless there is a consensus of judgment of several physicians. It =
may be objected that if=20

no experiments are tried no new medicines or surgical devices could be disc=
overed, or their=20

effects observed. The answer to this objection is that vivisection, and oth=
er experiments upon live=20

animals, permit of experimentation to a considerable degree, and often effe=
ctually point out the=20

proper course of treatment of the human subjects. In the case of drugs and =
medicines the practice=20

is well known of physicians trying the effects thereof upon their own perso=
ns, in their zeal and=20

anxiety to give to the world new discoveries. But, as heretofore observed, =
the law does not=20

recognize the right of the medical or surgical practitioner to tamper with =
his patients=E2=80=99 health by the=20

use of untried experiments, without imposing upon the practitioner liabilit=
y for all injuries=20

proximately resulting from their use. All of such matters will, however, fa=
ll more properly under=20

consideration when the liability of the physician and surgeon for malpracti=
ce is considered.=20

CHAPTER IV.  OF THE LEGAL RIGHT OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS TO RECOVER=20

COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES.   _Liability to Pay for Services._=E2=80=94An im=
portant matter for=20

physicians and surgeons is the question as to who is responsible, or liable=
 to pay for their=20

services. If there is an express contract this question does not arise; but=
 in most instances the=20

person performing the services renders them upon call, and it is necessary =
for him to understand=20

his legal right to recover pay for services in the absence of an express co=
ntract.  _Person Treated,=20

and not Person calling in Physician, Employs Him and is Liable._=E2=80=94In=
 the first place, it must be=20

stated as a general proposition that the person for whom the services are a=
ctually rendered, or=20

upon whom the operation is performed, is bound to pay for them, if otherwis=
e capable in law of=20

making contracts and incurring obligations. And secondly, that one who call=
s a physician or=20



surgeon to attend a patient is not presumed to have contracted to pay for t=
he services rendered,=20

unless his relations with the patient are such that he would be obligated i=
n law to pay, even if he=20

had not himself called in the medical man.  In the first case it is presume=
d that the patient is liable,=20

because he receives the benefit of the services, and nothing less than a di=
stinct understanding=20

that he was not to pay will relieve him from this obligation.  _Married Wom=
en and Infants Generally=20

Not Liable._=E2=80=94Where such a person is a married woman, unless the cas=
e arises in States or=20

countries where married women have been declared by statutes to be liable t=
he same as if single,=20

this rule does not obtain. Nor is an infant personally liable when he is li=
ving with his parent or=20

guardian. Hull _v._ Connelly, 3 McCord (S. C.), 6; Klein _v._ La Amoreaux, =
2 Paige Ch., 419;=20

Atchinson _v._ Bruff, 50 Barb., 384; Wilcox _v._ Smith, 26 Barb., 341. But =
the contract of an infant=20

nd will be held valid=20

and enforced against his estate if there is no person standing _in loco par=
entis_ who can be held=20

liable. 3 Barn. & Cress., 484; 2 Kent Com., 236. In cases when the parent o=
f the infant or the=20

husband of the married woman is liable, this liability obtains because the =
services rendered are=20

deemed necessary, and fall within the common-law obligation of such persons=
 to provide and pay=20

for necessaries for those whom they are bound to support and maintain.  _Bu=

 such cases the burden is=20

upon the person performing the services, to show that they were necessary, =
and it is his duty to=20

know, or learn, the true legal status of the patient, and the true legal re=
lations of the patient to the=20

person other than the patient from whom payment is to be claimed. As said i=
n the case of Crain=20

_v._ Baudouin (55 N. Y., 256-261), =E2=80=9Cin the case of minor children e=
ven, the law imposes this duty=20

upon those who would furnish them with necessaries, relying upon the credit=
 of their fathers, and=20

seeking to charge them. (Hunt _v._ Thompson, 3 Scam., 179; Van Valkinburgh =
_v._ Watson, 13 J.=20

R., 480).=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C_A fortiori_, it is so in the case of an adult =
married daughter living with her husband.=E2=80=9D=20

And as to the liability of the husband of a married woman in the absence of=
 statute giving her legal=20

capacity to contract and charge her separate estate. Consult Moody _v._ Osg=

 _Mother of Infant=20

probably Liable after Father=E2=80=99s Death._=E2=80=94It has been a much d=
isputed question whether after the=20

father=E2=80=99s death the mother becomes responsible for necessaries furni=
shed for her minor children.=20

The theory of law upon which a father is made liable proceeds upon the grou=
nd that he is bound to=20

support the child and has a right to the child=E2=80=99s services during it=
s minority.[168] It has been held=20

that the mother after the death of the father is entitled to those services=
. Campbell _v._ Campbell,=20

disapproving Bentley _v._ Richtmeyer (4 Comstock, 38), and approving _In re=
_ Ryder, 11 Paige,=20

185. If she is entitled to the services of her child, she must be bound to =
support and care for it; and=20

so it was held in Furman _v._ Van Size cited above.  _Estates of Insane Per=
sons Liable in a=20

Proper Case._=E2=80=94Persons of unsound mind are liable for necessaries fu=
rnished for their benefit,=20

and can be made to pay therefor at reasonable and proper rates, but they ca=
nnot make contracts=20

for a specific rate. It is always a question of fact as to what sum should =
be charged against their=20

estates, if they have any.  _Master Not Liable for Services Rendered Servan=
t without Special=20

Contract._=E2=80=94In the case of master and servant, while at common law a=
s between a master and=20

servant the master was bound to provide medicine and food for the servant w=
hen the servant was=20



an inmate of the master=E2=80=99s house, this is an obligation which a thir=
d person could not enforce, and=20

the master can only be held liable for services rendered to the servant, up=
on proof of a specific=20

contract with him to pay for them.   _Case of Crain v. Baudouin Considered.=
_=E2=80=94The case of Crain=20

_v._  Baudouin, _supra_, affords an interesting discussion before the  high=
est court of New York=20

State, as to the question as to how far a  father calling a physician for a=
n adult child for whom he is=20

not bound  to provide, although lying sick at the father=E2=80=99s house, c=
an be held  liable for the services=20

rendered upon such call. In that case the  plaintiff attended as a physicia=
n upon the daughter of=20

the defendant,  who was sick at his house. The daughter was of full age, ma=
rried and  living with=20

her husband, but was brought from that of her husband to  that of her fathe=
r in order that she=20

might be under the care of her  mother. Defendant was present when plaintif=
f made his calls, gave=20

the  latter a history of the patient=E2=80=99s illness, and received direct=
ions  as to her treatment. He told=20

others of the frequency and length of  the plaintiff=E2=80=99s visits, and =
of his opinion of the case, without=20

any  disclaimer of liability. The Court held, however, that these facts  we=
re insufficient to imply a=20

promise on the father=E2=80=99s part to pay  for the services, and that the=
 additional facts that the=20

defendant  consented to the calling in of a consulting physician, and that =
a bill  was sent in by the=20

plaintiff, unless acknowledged and acquiesced in by  defendant, or that he =
had before this=20

employed other physicians, were  also insufficient to raise an implication =
of law of such a promise=20

to pay. The plaintiff relied in his argument upon the fact that the  patien=
t was a daughter of the=20

defendant, but the Court held that any  presumption which might arise from =
this had the daughter=20

been under  age, was overcome by the fact that she was past a majority, and=
 was  married and=20

lived with her husband and children. The plaintiff also  relied to support =
his cause of action upon=20

the interest exhibited  by the defendant in the course of treatment pursued=
, and the other  facts as=20

to the presence of the defendant when the plaintiff made  his professional =
calls alone and in=20

consultation; his receiving  directions as to treatment; his recognition to=
 others of the fact that  the=20

plaintiff was in attendance; his reciting to others a knowledge  of the fre=
quency and length of the=20

visits of plaintiff without any  disclaimer on the part of the defendant of=
 liability. The Court said  as=20

to these facts: =E2=80=9CIt is true that particular acts will sometimes  gi=
ve rise to particular obligations,=20

duties and liabilities. But the  party whose acts are thus to affect him mu=
st be in such predicament=20

as that those acts have, of legal necessity, a significance attached  to th=
em, at the time, which he=20

may not afterward repel.... It has  been held that a special request by a f=
ather to a physician to=20

attend  upon his son, then of full age but lying sick at the father=E2=80=
=99s house,  raised no implied=20

promise on the part of the father to pay for the  services rendered.=E2=80=
=9D See Boyd _v._ Sappington, 4=20

Watts (Pa.), 247; and  so in Veitch _v._ Russell, 3 Ad. & Ell. (N. S.), 927=
, it is said:  =E2=80=9CA physician=20

attends in every case on request; that fact alone is  not enough for the in=
ference of a special=20

contract;=E2=80=9D and see Sellen  _v._ Norman, 4 Carr. & P., 284. Still le=
ss where there has been no=20

special request by the father to the physician, and no more than  acquiesce=
nce in his calls. As it=20

would be unnatural for the parent  of an invalid child, though legally eman=
cipated, or for an=20

intimate  and confidential friend of hers, not to know the rise and course =
of  her malady, not to be=20

interested in the state of it as disclosed at  any time to skilled inspecti=
on, not to be so anxious as to=20

be in  waiting when scientific skill was to be applied for its cure, not to=
  be ready to receive=20

directions for treatment in the intervals; so it  is not to be implied in t=
he one case more than in the=20

other that,  from these manifestations, because unaccompanied with an expre=
ss  repudiation of=20



liability, a liability may be implied. They are to be  referred to natural =
affection and friendly=20

sympathy, rather than to  an acquiescence in the rendition of a personal be=
nefit, or counted as=20

acts done under a sense of legal obligation.=E2=80=9D The Court further sai=
d  that =E2=80=9Ceven if it should be=20

assumed that the usage exists that the  physician called to consult with hi=
m who is in attendance,=20

with the  consent of the person who has employed the latter, is in contempl=
ation  of law in the hire=20

 upon such a set of=20
