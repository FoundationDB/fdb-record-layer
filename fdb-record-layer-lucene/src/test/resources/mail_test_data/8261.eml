 but which at first he exercise of two thousand men was not a slight affair=

 than those of the armorers, the clink of whose instruments resounded _
ingenious author. We hope to introduce a few of the notes of the Series; bu=
t content ourselves for=20

the present with the following: being the original of the legend of Mrs. Gr=
izel Oldbuck:  Mr. R----d of=20

Bowland, a gentleman of landed property in the vale of Gala, was prosecuted=
 for a very=20

considerable sum, the accumulated arrears of teind (or tithe) for which he =
was said to be indebted=20

to a noble family, the titulars (lay impropriators of the tithes.) Mr. R---=
-d was strongly impressed=20

with the belief that his father had, by a form of process peculiar to the l=
aw of Scotland, purchased=20

these lands from the titular, and therefore that the present prosecution wa=
s groundless. But after=20

an industrious search among his father's papers, an investigation of the pu=
blic records, and a=20

careful inquiry among all persons who had transacted law business for his f=
ather, no evidence=20

could be recovered to support his defence. The period was now near at hand =
when he conceived=20

the loss of his lawsuit to be inevitable, and he had formed his determinati=
on to ride to Edinburgh=20

next day, and make the best bargain he could in the way of compromise. He w=
ent to bed with this=20

resolution, and with all the circumstances of the case floating upon his mi=
nd, had a dream to the=20

following on his legs when Lothair entered it, and was dictating to an offi=
cer writing at a table.=20

=E2=80=9CYou ought to know my military secretary,=E2=80=9D said the general=
, as Lothair entered, =E2=80=9Cand therefore I=20

will introduce you.=E2=80=9D  Lothair was commencing a suitable reverence o=
f recognition as the secretary=20

raised his head to receive it, when he suddenly stopped, changed color, and=
 for a moment=20

seemed to lose himself, and then murmured, =E2=80=9CIs it possible?=E2=80=
=9D  It was indeed Theodora: clothed in=20

male attire, she seemed a stripling.  =E2=80=9CQuite possible,=E2=80=9D she=
 said, =E2=80=9Cand all is well. But I found it a=20

longer business than I had counted on. You see, there are so many new perso=
ns who knew me=20

only by tradition, but with whom it was necessary I should personally confe=
r. And I had more=20

difficulty, just now, in getting through Florence than I had anticipated. T=
he Papalini and the French=20

are both worrying our allies in that city about the gathering on the southe=
rn frontier, and there is a=20

sort of examination, true or false, I will not aver, of all who depart. How=
ever, I managed to pass=20

with some soldiers=E2=80=99 wives who were carrying fruit as far as Narni, =
and there I met an old comrade=20

of Aspromonte, who is a custom-officer now, but true to the good cause, and=
 he, and his daughter,=20

who is with me,=20


_
him, he thought, and asked him why he was disturbed in his mind. In dreams =
men are not=20

surprised at such apparitions. Mr. R----d thought that he had informed his =
father of the cause of his=20

distress, adding that the payment of a considerable sum of money was the mo=
re unpleasant to=20

him, because he had a strong consciousness that it was not due, though he w=
as unable to recover=20

any evidence in support of his belief. "You are right, my son," replied the=
 paternal shade; "I did=20

acquire right to these teinds, for payment of which you are now prosecuted.=
 The papers relating to=20

the transaction are in the hands of Mr. ----, a writer (or attorney,) who i=
s now retired from=20

professional business, and resides at Inveresk, near Edinburgh. He was a pe=
rson whom I=20

employed on that occasion for a particular reason, but who never on any oth=
er occasion=20

transacted business on my account. It is very possible," pursued the vision=
, "that Mr. ---- may have=20

forgotten a matter which is now of a very old date; but you may call it to =
his recollection by this=20

token, that when I came to pay his account, there was difficulty in getting=
 change for a Portugal=20

piece of gold, and that we were forced to drink out the balance at a tavern=
." Mr. R----d awaked in=20

the morning with all the words of the vision imprinted on his mind, and tho=
ught it worth while to ride=20

across the through every thing, and so I am with my dear friends again.=E2=
=80=9D  After some slight=20

conversation in this vein, Theodora entered into a detailed narrative of he=
r proceedings, and gave=20

to them her views of the condition of affairs.  =E2=80=9CBy one thing, abov=
e all others,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9CI am=20

impressed, and that is, the unprecedented efforts which Rome is making to o=
btain the return of the=20

French. There never was such influence exercised, such distinct offers made=
, such prospects=20

intimated. You may prepare yourself for any thing; a papal coronation, a fa=
mily pontiff=E2=80=94I could=20

hardly say a King of Rome, though he has been reminded of that royal fact. =
Our friends have=20

acted with equal energy and with perfect temper. The heads of the societies=
 have met in council,=20

and resolved that, if France will refuse to interfere, no domestic disturba=
nce shall be attempted=20

during this reign, and they have communicated this resolution to headquarte=
rs. He trusts them; he=20

knows they are honest men. They did something like this before the Italian =
War, when he=20

hesitated about heading the army from the fear of domestic revolution. Anxi=
ous to recover the=20

freedom of Italy, they apprized him that, if he personally entered the fiel=
d, they would undertake to=20

insure tranquillity at home. The engagement was scrupulously fulfilled. Whe=
n I left Paris all looked=20

well, but affairs require=20


_
Inveresk, instead of going straight to Edinburgh. When he came there, he wa=
ited on the gentleman=20

mentioned in the dream, a very old man; without saying any thing of the vis=
ion, he inquired=20

whether he remembered having conducted such a matter for his deceased fathe=
r. The old=20

gentleman could not at first bring the circumstance to his recollection, bu=
t on mention of the=20

Portugal piece of gold, the whole returned upon his memory; he made an imme=
diate search for the=20

papers, and recovered them; so that Mr. R----d carried to Edinburgh the doc=
uments necessary to=20

gain the cause which he was on the verge of losing. The author has often he=
ard this story told by=20

persons who had the is a struggle between the Church and the secret societi=
es; and it is a death-

struggle.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 53 During the week that elapsed after the =
arrival of Theodora at the=20

camp, many recruits, and considerable supplies of military stores, reached =
the valley. Theodora=20

really acted as secretary to the general, and her labors were not light. Th=
ough Lothair was=20

frequently in her presence, they were, never, or rarely, alone, and, when t=
hey conversed together,=20

her talk was of details. The scouts, too, had brought information, which mi=
ght have been expected,=20

that their rendezvous was no longer a secret at Rome. The garrison of the n=
eighboring town of=20

Viterbo had, therefore, been=20


_
themselves to be deceived, and were certainly incapable of deception. He ca=
nnot therefore refuse=20

to give it credit, however extraordinary the circumstances may appear. The =
circumstantial=20

character of the information given in the dream, takes it out of the genera=
l class of impressions=20

commencement of an intrenched camp in the vicinity of that place, to be gar=
risoned by a=20

detachment of the legion of Antibes and other good troops, so that any junc=
tion between the=20

general and Garibaldi, if contemplated, should not be easily effected.  In =
the mean time, the life of=20
