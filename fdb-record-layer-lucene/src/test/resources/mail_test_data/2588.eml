Scene of the kind witnessed only once or twice in Session. Six hundred pair=

 sufficient to make a=20

reputation. And yet, when result of Division announced, it was found that m=

in the Chair, and Committee fully constituted, the waggish WIGGIN walked ad=
own the House, with=20

his hat cocked on one side of his head, in defiance of Parliamentary etique=

 says, "is derided=20

ord of Parliamentary=20

y hinted that among=20

his many admirable qualities terseness of diction is not prominent. In fact=
 he has been sometimes=20

alluded to by the playful prefix WINDBAG. If TAY PAY had been content to ad=
minister reproof, it=20

would have been well. But he goes on to discuss SEXTON's parliamentary styl=
e, and comes to=20

this conclusion:--"Mr. SEXTON's one fault as a speaker is that he does not =
proportion his=20

observations sufficiently at certain stages in his speeches; and that prepa=
ration sometimes has the=20

effect of tempting him to over-elaboration." If TAY PAY likes to put it tha=

hen I last drew my=20

poniard."  "Ah! Good! another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt. Well, my frien=
d, nothing now is=20

lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow."=
  "Hush!" said Athos,=20

putting a finger on his lips, with the sad smile peculiar to him; "let us t=
alk no more of Mordaunt--it=20

will bring bad luck." And Athos set forward toward Charenton, followed clos=
ely by Aramis.     78.=20

The Battle of Charenton.   As Athos and Aramis proceeded, and passed differ=
ent companies on=20

the road, they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battl=
e.  "Ah! my friend!" cried=20

Athos, suddenly, "where have you brought us? I fancy I perceive around us f=
aces of different=20

officers in the royal army; is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming=
 toward us with his=20

brigadiers?"  "Good-day, sirs," said the duke, advancing; "you are puzzled =
by what you see here,=20

but one word will explain everything. There is now a truce and a conference=
. The prince, Monsieur=20

de Retz, the Duc de Beaufort, the Duc de Bouillon, are talking over public =
affairs. Now one of two=20

things must happen: either matters will not be arranged, or they will be ar=
ranged, in which last=20

case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again."  "Si=
r," said Aramis, "you=20

speak to the point. Allow me to ask you a question: Where are the plenipote=
ntiaries?"  "At=20

Charenton, in the second house on the right on entering from the direction =
of Paris."  "And was=20

this conference arranged beforehand?"  "No, gentlemen, it seems to be the r=
esult of certain=20

propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians."  Athos and Ar=
amis exchanged=20

smiles; for they well knew what those propositions were, to whom they had b=
een made and who=20

had made them.  "And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are," asked =
Athos, "belongs to----"=20

"To Monsieur de Chanleu, who commands your troops at Charenton. I say your =
troops, for I=20

presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs?"  "Yes, almost," said Aramis.  "W=
e are for the king=20

and the princes," added Athos.  "We must understand each other," said the d=
uke. "The king is with=20

us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Conde, althou=
gh I must add 'tis=20

almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs."  "Yes," answ=
ered Athos, "but his=20

right place is in our ranks, with the Prince de Conti, De Beaufort, D'Elbeu=
f, and De Bouillon; but,=20



sir, supposing that the conference is broken off--are you going to try to t=
ake Charenton?"  "Such=20

are my orders."  "Sir, since you command the cavalry----"  "Pardon me, I am=
 commander-in-chief."=20

"So much the better. You must know all your officers--I mean those more dis=
tinguished."  "Why,=20

yes, very nearly."  "Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your comma=
nd the Chevalier=20

d'Artagnan, lieutenant in the musketeers?"  "No, sir, he is not with us; he=
 left Paris more than six=20

weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to England."  "I knew t=
hat, but I supposed=20

he had returned."  "No, sir; no one has seen him. I can answer positively o=
n that point, for the=20

musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon, the substitute for =
Monsieur=20

d'Artagnan, still holds his place."  The two friends looked at each other. =
 "You see," said Athos.  "It=20

is strange," said Aramis.  "It is absolutely certain that some misfortune h=
as happened to them on=20

the way."  "If we have no news of them this evening, to-morrow we must star=
t."  Athos nodded=20

affirmatively, then turning:  "And Monsieur de Bragelonne, a young man fift=
een years of age,=20

attached to the Prince de Conde--has he the honor of being known to you?" d=
iffident in allowing=20

the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings.  "Y=
es, surely, he came with=20

the prince; a charming young man; he is one of your friends then, monsieur =
le comte?"  "Yes, sir,"=20

answered Athos, agitated; "so much so that I wish to see him if possible." =
 "Quite possible, sir; do=20

me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to headquarters."  "Hal=
loo, there!" cried=20

Aramis, turning around; "what a noise behind us!"  "A body of cavaliers is =
coming toward us," said=20

Chatillon.  "I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat."  "And I the Du=
c de Beaufort by his white=20

plume of ostrich feathers."  "They are coming, full gallop; the prince is w=
ith them--ah! he is leaving=20

them!"  "They are beating the rappel!" cried Chatillon; "we must discover w=
hat is going on."  In fact,=20

they saw the soldiers running to their arms; the trumpets sounded; the drum=
s beat; the Duc de=20

Beaufort drew his sword. On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all th=
e officers of the royalist=20

army, mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops, ran to him.  "Gentleme=
n," cried Chatillon, "the=20

truce is broken, that is evident; they are going to fight; go, then, into C=
harenton, for I shall begin in=20

a short time--there's a signal from the prince!"  The cornet of a troop had=
 in fact just raised the=20

standard of the prince.  "Farewell, till the next time we meet," cried Chat=
illon, and he set off, full=20

gallop.  Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and =
the Duc de Beaufort.=20

As to the Duc de Bouillon, he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to retu=
rn to Paris in a litter; but=20

his place was well filled by the Duc d'Elbeuf and his four sons, ranged aro=
und him like a staff.=20

Meantime, between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looke=
d ready to serve=20

as a last resting place for the dead.  "Gentlemen," cried the coadjutor, ti=
ghtening his sash, which=20

he wore, after the fashion of the ancient military prelates, over his archi=
episcopal simar, "there's=20

the enemy approaching. Let us save them half of their journey."  And withou=
t caring whether he=20

were followed or not he set off; his regiment, which bore the name of the r=
egiment of Corinth, from=20

the name of his archbishopric, darted after him and began the fight. Monsie=
ur de Beaufort sent his=20

cavalry, toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu, who defended the place, wa=
s ready to resist=20

an assault, or if the enemy were repulsed, to attempt a sortie.  The battle=
 soon became general=20

and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor. His proper vocation had alwa=
ys been the sword=20

and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard, no matter=
 for whom or against=20

whom.  Chanleu, whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment, thought=
 that the moment was=20

come to pursue it; but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the D=
uc de Chatillon in=20



person. This charge was so fierce, so skillfully conducted, that Chanleu wa=
s almost surrounded.=20

He commanded a retreat, which began, step by step, foot by foot; unhappily,=
 in an instant he fell,=20

mortally wounded. De Chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voic=
e to his men, which=20

raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies, so that eve=
ry man thought only of=20

his own safety and tried to gain the trenches, where the coadjutor was tryi=
ng to reform his=20

disorganized regiment.  Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encou=
nter the royal troops,=20

who were entering, pele-mele, the intrenchments with the fugitives. Athos a=
nd Aramis charged at=20

the head of their squadrons; Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands, Ath=
os with his sword in his=20

scabbard, his pistol in his saddle-bags; calm and cool as if on the parade,=
 except that his noble=20

and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who =
were sacrificed=20

on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the persona=
l rancor of the princes.=20

Aramis, on the contrary, struck right and left and was almost delirious wit=
h excitement. His bright=20

eyes kindled, and his mouth, so finely formed, assumed a wicked smile; ever=
y blow he aimed was=20

sure, and his pistol finished the deed--annihilated the wounded wretch who =
tried to rise again.  On=20

the opposite side two cavaliers, one covered with a gilt cuirass, the other=
 wearing simply a buff=20

doublet, from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet, charged in f=
ront. The cavalier in the gilt=20

cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his won=
ted skill.  "Ah! 'tis you,=20

Monsieur de Chatillon," cried the chevalier; "welcome to you--I expected yo=
u."  "I hope I have not=20

made you wait too long, sir," said the duke; "at all events, here I am."  "=
Monsieur de Chatillon,"=20

cried Aramis, taking from his saddle-bags a second pistol, "I think if your=
 pistols have been=20

discharged you are a dead man."  "Thank God, sir, they are not!"  And the d=
uke, pointing his pistol=20

at Aramis, fired. But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke's fi=
nger press the trigger=20

and the ball passed without touching him.  "Oh! you've missed me," cried Ar=
amis, "but I swear to=20

Heaven! I will not miss you."  "If I give you time!" cried the duke, spurri=
ng on his horse and rushing=20

upon him with his drawn sword.  Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile=
 which was peculiar to=20

him on such occasions, and Athos, who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis =
with the rapidity of=20

lightning, was just going to cry out, "Fire! fire, then!" when the shot was=
 fired. De Chatillon opened=20

his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse.  The ball had entered h=
is breast through a=20

notch in the cuirass.  "I am a dead man," he said, and fell from his horse =
to the ground.  "I told you=20

this, I am now grieved I have kept my word. Can I be of any use to you?"  C=
hatillon made a sign=20

with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent s=
hock; 'twas a thrust=20

from a sword, but his cuirass turned aside the blow.  He turned around and =
seized his new=20

antagonist by the wrist, when he started back, exclaiming, "Raoul!"  "Raoul=
?" cried Athos.  The=20

young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the C=
hevalier d'Herblay;=20

two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul, but Ar=
amis protected him with=20

his sword.  "My prisoner!" he cried.  Athos took his son's horse by the bri=
dle and led him forth out=20

of the melee.  At this crisis of the battle, the prince, who had been secon=
ding De Chatillon in the=20

second line, appeared in the midst of the fight; his eagle eye made him kno=
wn and his blows=20

proclaimed the hero.  On seeing him, the regiment of Corinth, which the coa=
djutor had not been=20

able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts, threw itself into the midst=
 of the Parisian forces, put=20

them into confusion and re-entered Charenton flying. The coadjutor, dragged=
 along with his=20

fugitive forces, passed near the group formed by Athos, Raoul and Aramis. A=
ramis could not in his=20



jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor's misfortune, and was about t=
o utter some bon mot=20

more witty than correct, when Athos stopped him.  "On, on!" he cried, "this=
 is no moment for=20

compliments; or rather, back, for the battle seems to be lost by the Fronde=
urs."  "It is a matter of=20

indifference to me," said Aramis; "I came here only to meet De Chatillon; I=
 have met him, I am=20

contented; 'tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel!"  "And beside=
s, we have a prisoner,"=20

said Athos, pointing to Raoul.  The three cavaliers continued their road on=
 full gallop.  "What were=20

you doing in the battle, my friend?" inquired Athos of the youth; "'twas no=
t your right place, I think,=20

as you were not equipped for an engagement!"  "I had no intention of fighti=
ng to-day, sir; I was=20

charged, indeed, with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil, =
when, seeing Monsieur=20

de Chatillon charge, an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his sid=
e. It was then that he=20

told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Co=
mte de la Fere."=20

"What! you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the cheval=
ier?"  "I did not=20

recognize the chevalier in armor, sir!" said Raoul, blushing; "though I mig=
ht have known him by his=20

skill and coolness in danger."  "Thank you for the compliment, my young fri=
end," replied Aramis,=20

"we can see from whom you learned courtesy. Then you were going to Rueil?" =
 "Yes! I have a=20

despatch from the prince to his eminence."  "You must still deliver it," sa=
id Athos.  "No false=20

generosity, count! the fate of our friends, to say nothing of our own, is p=
erhaps in that very=20

despatch."  "This young man must not, however, fail in his duty," said Atho=
s.  "In the first place,=20

count, this youth is our prisoner; you seem to forget that. What I propose =
to do is fair in war; the=20

vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means. Give me the despatch,=
 Raoul."  The young=20

man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule =
of conduct.  "Give him=20

the despatch, Raoul! you are the chevalier's prisoner."  Raoul gave it up r=
eluctantly; Aramis=20

instantly seized and read it.  "You," he said, "you, who are so trusting, r=
ead and reflect that there is=20

something in this letter important for us to see."  Athos took the letter, =
frowning, but an idea that he=20

should find something in this letter about D'Artagnan conquered his unwilli=
ngness to read it.  "My=20

lord, I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the =
troop of Monsieur de=20

Comminges, the ten men you demand. They are good soldiers, fit to confront =
the two violent=20

adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of."  "Oh=
!" cried Athos.  "Well,"=20

said Aramis, "what think you about these two enemies whom it requires,=20

not as like as two drops of water to D'Artagnan and Porthos?"  "We'll searc=
h Paris all day long,"=20

said Athos, "and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road=
 to Picardy; and I feel=20

no doubt that, thanks to D'Artagnan's ready invention, we shall then find s=
ome clew which will=20

solve our doubts."  "Yes, let us search Paris and especially inquire of Pla=
nchet if he has yet heard=20

from his former master."  "That poor Planchet! You speak of him very much a=
t your ease, Aramis;=20

he has probably been killed. All those fighting citizens went out to battle=
 and they have been=20

massacred."  It was, then, with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet,=
 who alone could give=20

them information, was alive or dead, that the friends returned to the Place=
 Royale; to their great=20

surprise they found the citizens still encamped there, drinking and banteri=
ng each other, although,=20

doubtless, mourned by their families, who thought they were at Charenton in=
 the thickest of the=20

fighting.  Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet, but he had seen noth=
ing of D'Artagnan;=20

they wished to take Planchet with them, but he could not leave his troop, w=
ho at five o'clock=20

returned home, saying that they were returning from the battle, whereas the=
y had never lost sight=20

of the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII.     79. The Road to Picardy.=
   On leaving Paris, Athos=20

and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger; but we k=
now that for men like=20

these there could be no question of danger. Besides, they felt that the den=
ouement of this second=20

Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make.  B=
esides, there was no=20

tranquillity in Paris itself. Provisions began to fail, and whenever one of=
 the Prince de Conti's=20

generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult, w=
hich he put down again,=20

and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues.  In one o=
f these risings, the Duc=20

de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin, in order to give the=
 populace, as he put it,=20

something to gnaw at. Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coup-d'etat, w=
hich took place on the=20

very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton=
.  They quitted Paris,=20

beholding it abandoned to extreme want, bordering on famine; agitated by fe=
ar, torn by faction.=20

Parisians and Frondeurs as they were, the two friends expected to find the =
same misery, the same=20

fears, the same intrigue in the enemy's camp; but what was their surprise, =
after passing Saint=20

Denis, to hear that at Saint Germain people were singing and laughing, and =
leading generally=20

cheerful lives. The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encoun=
ter the Mazarinists=20

scattered about the Isle of France, and also to escape the Frondeurs, who w=
ere in possession of=20

Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville=
, in order that he=20

might ascertain whether they were friends or foes. Having escaped these dan=
gers, they returned=20



by the main road to Boulogne, at Abbeville, and followed it step by step, e=
xamining every track.=20

Nevertheless, they were still in a state of uncertainty. Several inns were =
visited by them, several=20

innkeepers questioned, without a single clew being given to guide their inq=
uiries, when at=20

Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his d=
elicate fingers. He=20

turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with=
 a knife:  "Port....=20

D'Art.... 2d February."  "This is capital!" said Athos to Aramis, "we were =
to have slept here, but we=20

cannot--we must push on." They rode forward and reached Abbeville. There th=
e great number of=20

inns puzzled them; they could not go to all; how could they guess in which =
those whom they were=20

seeking had stayed?  "Trust me," said Aramis, "do not expect to find anythi=
ng in Abbeville. If we=20

had only been looking for Porthos, Porthos would have stationed himself in =
one of the finest hotels=20

and we could easily have traced him. But D'Artagnan is devoid of such weakn=
esses. Porthos=20

would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying o=
f hunger; he has gone=20

on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else."  Th=
ey continued their=20

route. It had now become a weary and almost hopeless task, and had it not b=
een for the threefold=20

motives of honor, friendship and gratitude, implanted in their hearts, our =
two travelers would have=20

given up many a time their rides over the sand, their interrogatories of th=
e peasantry and their=20

close inspection of faces.  They proceeded thus to Peronne.  Athos began to=
 despair. His noble=20

nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them. They h=
ad not looked carefully=20

enough for their lost friends. They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in=
 their inquiries. They were=20

willing and ready to retrace their steps, when, in crossing the suburb whic=
h leads to the gates of=20

the town, upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning aro=
und the rampart, Athos=20

cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk, which represented, with the aw=
kwardness of a first=20

attempt, two cavaliers riding furiously; one of them carried a roll of pape=
r on which were written=20

these words: "They are following us."  "Oh!" exclaimed Athos, "here it is, =
as clear as day; pursued=20

as he was, D'Artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been =
pressed very closely,=20

which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping."  Aramis shook=
 his head.  "Had=20

he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of."  "Y=
ou are right,=20

Aramis, let us travel on."  To describe the impatience and anxiety of these=
 two friends would be=20

impossible. Uneasiness took possession of the tender, constant heart of Ath=
os, and fearful=20

forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis. They galloped on for tw=
o or three hours as=20

furiously as the cavaliers on the wall. All at once, in a narrow pass, they=
 perceived that the road=20

was partially barricaded by an enormous stone. It had evidently been rolled=
 across the pass by=20

some arm of giant strength.  Aramis stopped.  "Oh!" he said, looking at the=
 stone, "this is the work=20

of either Hercules or Porthos. Let us get down, count, and examine this roc=
k."  They both alighted.=20

The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the ro=
ad, but some one=20

having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside.  With the assi=
stance of Blaisois and=20

Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over. Upon the side next=
 the ground were=20

scratched the following words:  "Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing u=
s. If we reach=20

Compiegne we shall stop at the Peacock. It is kept by a friend of ours."  "=
At last we have=20

something definite," said Athos; "let us go to the Peacock."  "Yes," answer=
ed Aramis, "but if we are=20

to get there we must rest our horses, for they are almost broken-winded."  =
Aramis was right; they=20

stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity o=
f corn steeped in=20



wine; they gave them three hours' rest and then set off again. The men them=
selves were almost=20

dead with fatigue, but hope supported them.  In six hours they reached Comp=
iegne and alighted at=20

the Peacock. The host proved to be a worthy man, as bald as a Chinaman. The=
y asked him if=20

some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursu=
ed by dragoons;=20

without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier.  "Do yo=
u know that?" he=20

asked.  Athos merely glanced at it.  "'Tis D'Artagnan's sword," he said.  "=
Does it belong to the=20

smaller or to the larger of the two?" asked the host.  "To the smaller."  "=
I see that you are the=20

friends of these gentlemen."  "Well, what has happened to them?"  "They wer=
e pursued by eight of=20

the light dragoons, who rode into the courtyard before they had time to clo=
se the gate."  "Eight!"=20

said Aramis; "it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and D'Artagna=
n should have=20

allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men."  "The eight men would doub=
tless have failed=20

had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians i=
n the king's service, who=20

are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbe=
rs."  "Arrested, were=20

they?" inquired Athos; "is it known why?"  "No, sir, they were carried off =
instantly, and had not=20

 consolation that they=20

were not wounded," said Aramis.  "Where were they taken?" asked Athos.  "To=
ward the town of=20

I.  Het reisverhaal, waarvan wij onzen lezers bij deze een gedeelte voorleg=
gen, is van den=20

franschen reiziger Paul Marcoy, die in de jaren 1848 tot 1860, het geheele =
vasteland van Zuid-

Amerika, van de kusten van Peru tot die van den Atlantischen oceaan doortro=
k. Eene aangename=20

wijze van vertellen, eene zeer uitgebreide algemeene kennis, voor welke bij=
kans geen tak van=20



wetenschap een geheel onbekend gebied is, eene zeldzame gave van opmerking:=
 ziedaar zoo=20

vele eigenschappen, die den heer Marcoy aanspraak geven op de belangstellin=
g van beschaafde=20

lezers: eene belangstelling, die hem te minder onthouden zal worden, daar d=
e onmetelijke=20

landstreken, die hij doorkruist heeft, zeker tot de minst bekende der aarde=
 behooren. Wij mogen=20

hem dan ook gerust verder voor zich zelven laten spreken.    Islay, aan de =
kust van Peru, op 17=20

01' zuiderbreedte en 74 30' westerlengte gelegen, is de haven van het depar=
tement en de stad=20

Arequipa. De baai, onregelmatig van vorm, heeft ongeveer een mijl in omtrek=
; zij is omzoomd door=20

een dubbele reeks van lomas of heuvelen, geel van kleur, plomp van voorkome=
n,=20

amphitheatersgewijze  "Let us alight here," said Athos. "D'Artagnan will no=
t have let slip an=20

opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur, and at the same time leavi=
ng some trace of himself."=20

They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur, at the counte=
r--as their friends must=20

have done before them. The counter was covered with a plate of pewter; upon=
 this plate was=20

written with the point of a large pin: "Rueil... D.."  "They went to Rueil,=
" cried Aramis.  "Let us go to=20

Rueil," said Athos.  "It is to throw ourselves into the wolf's jaws," said =
Aramis.  "Had I been as=20

great a friend of Jonah as I am of D'Artagnan I should have followed him ev=
en into the inside of=20

the whale itself; and you would have done the same, Aramis."  "Certainly--b=
ut you make me out=20

better than I am, dear count. Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone =
to Rueil without great=20

caution. But where you go, I go."  They then set off for Rueil. Here the de=
puties of the parliament=20

had just arrived, in order to enter upon those famous conferences which wer=
e to last three weeks,=20

and produced eventually that shameful peace, at the conclusion of which the=
 prince was arrested.=20

Rueil was crowded with advocates, presidents and councillors, who came from=
 the Parisians, and,=20

on the side of the court, with officers and guards; it was therefore easy, =
in the midst of this=20

confusion, to remain as unobserved as any one might wish; besides, the conf=
erences implied a=20

truce, and to arrest two gentlemen, even Frondeurs, at this time, would hav=
e been an attack on=20

the rights of the people.  The two friends mingled with the crowd and fanci=
ed that every one was=20

occupied with the same thought that tormented them. They expected to hear s=
ome mention made=20

of D'Artagnan or of Porthos, but every one was engrossed by articles and re=
forms. It was the=20

advice of Athos to go straight to the minister.  "My friend," said Aramis, =
"take care; our safety lies=20

in our obscurity. If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to r=
ejoin our friends in=20

some deep ditch, from which the devil himself could not take us out. Let us=
 try not to find them out=20

by accident, but from our notions. Arrested at Compiegne, they have been ca=
rried to Rueil; at=20

Rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal, who has either kept them n=
ear him or sent them=20

to Saint Germain. As to the Bastile, they are not there, though the Bastile=
 is especially for the=20

Frondeurs. They are not dead, for the death of D'Artagnan would make a sens=
ation. As for=20

Porthos, I believe him to be eternal, like God, although less patient. Do n=
ot let us despond, but=20

wait at Rueil, for my conviction is that they are at Rueil. But what ails y=
ou? You are pale."  "It is=20

this," answered Athos, with a trembling voice.  "I remember that at the Cas=
tle of Rueil the Cardinal=20

Richelieu had some horrible 'oubliettes' constructed."  "Oh! never fear," s=
aid Aramis. "Richelieu=20

was a gentleman, our equal in birth, our superior in position. He could, li=
ke the king, touch the=20

greatest of us on the head, and touching them make such heads shake on thei=
r shoulders. But=20

Mazarin is a low-born rogue, who can at the most take us by the collar, lik=
e an archer. Be calm--for=20

I am sure that D'Artagnan and Porthos are at Rueil, alive and well."  "But,=
" resumed Athos, "I recur=20



to my first proposal. I know no better means than to act with candor. I sha=
ll seek, not Mazarin, but=20

the queen, and say to her, 'Madame, restore to us your two servants and our=
 two friends.'"  Aramis=20

shook his head.  "'Tis a last resource, but let us not employ it till it is=
 imperatively called for; let us=20

rather persevere in our researches."  They continued their inquiries and at=
 last met with a light=20

dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted D'Artagnan to Ru=
eil.  Athos,=20

however, perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen.  "I=
n order to see the=20

queen," said Aramis, "we must first see the cardinal; and when we have seen=
 the cardinal--

remember what I tell you, Athos--we shall be reunited to our friends, but n=
ot in the way you wish.=20

Now, that way of joining them is not very attractive to me, I confess. Let =
us act in freedom, that we=20

may act well and quickly."  "I shall go," he said, "to the queen."  "Well, =
then," answered Aramis,=20

"pray tell me a day or two beforehand, that I may take that opportunity of =
going to Paris."  "To=20

whom?"  "Zounds! how do I know? perhaps to Madame de Longueville. She is al=
l-powerful yonder;=20

she will help me. But send me word should you be arrested, for then I will =
return directly."  "Why=20

do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?"  "No, I thank you."  =
"Should we, by being=20

arrested, be all four together again, we should=20

achietrotsen: een=20

natuurlijk bolwerk, dat het afzakken van het zand en de losse aarde tegenho=
udt, en tevens den=20

aanslag der golven keert. Door de onophoudelijke werking der zee, wier golv=
en, door den=20

zuidenwind opgejaagd, met geweld op deze kust breken, zijn de rotsen letter=
lijk afgesleten en op=20

sommige punten uitgehold, zoodat zij zich loodrecht verheffen. Aan den voet=
 dezer rotsige=20

heuvelen steken, hier en daar, donker zwarte porfierrotsen hare scherpe pun=
ten boven de met=20

schuim gekuifde golven uit. Op den achtergrond der baai verheft zich eene z=
ware rotsmassa, niet=20

ongelijk aan een in puin gevallen toren, die door middel van balken, planke=
n en touwladders met=20

den vasten wal verbonden is. Deze rots, met den toestel die daartoe behoort=
, dient tot kaai,=20

havenhoofd, aanlegplaats en steiger voor de zwervende en varende bevolking,=
 en ook tot=20

wachtpost voor de douanen. Het tolkantoor--een houten loods met een veldbed=
--staat aan eene=20

der zijden van de rots; van daar voert een steil, slingerend pad, na eene w=
andeling van tien=20

minuten, naar het dorp Islay, tegen de helling van een heuvel gebouwd; free=
."  "My friend, since I=20

killed Chatillon, adored of the ladies of Saint Germain, I am too great a c=
elebrity not to fear a=20

prison doubly. The queen is likely to follow Mazarin's counsels and to have=
 me tried."  "Do you=20

think she loves this Italian so much as they say she does?"  "Did she not l=
ove an Englishman?"=20

"My friend, she is a woman."  "No, no, you are deceived--she is a queen."  =
"Dear friend, I shall=20

sacrifice myself and go and see Anne of Austria."  "Adieu, Athos, I am goin=
g to raise an army."=20

"For what purpose?"  "To come back and besiege Rueil."  "Where shall we mee=
t again?"  "At the=20

foot of the cardinal's gallows."  The two friends departed--Aramis to retur=
n to Paris, Athos to take=20

measures preparatory to an interview with the queen.     80. The Gratitude =
of Anne of Austria.=20

Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audie=
nce of Anne of Austria.=20

It was granted, and was to take place after her morning's "levee," at which=
, in accordance with his=20

rights of birth, he was entitled to be present. A vast crowd filled the apa=
rtments of Saint Germain.=20

Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court; but this crowd represent=
ed chiefly=20


_
Als ge, op den top diens heuvels staande, uw blikken over den omtrek laat d=
walen, dan overziet=20

ge een weinig verkwikkelijk tafereel. Van het noorden tot het zuiden aansch=
ouwt ge niets dan=20

zandheuvels, hooge klippen, dorre stranden met drijfhout bezaaid, lange en =
breede strepen van=20

salpeter en zeezout, witte kalklagen, steenachtige eilandjes met eene dikke=
 laag guano (eigenlijk=20

huano) bedekt, rotsen van allerlei kleur en vorm. De doorschijnende helderh=
eid der lucht, het=20

verblindend sterke licht, het smetteloos azuur van den hemel en de zee, doe=
n alle bijzonderheden=20

tot in de kleinste trekken van dit wijde geheel zoo duidelijk mogelijk uitk=
omen; doch deze=20

onbarmhartige verlichting, die overal de schaduw verdrijft, verspreidt over=
 dit sombere tooneel een=20

akeligen glans, eene doodsche majesteit, en brengt een pijnlijken indruk va=
n verlatenheid en=20

ledigheid te weeg.  Uit zee gezien, heeft de baai van Islay de gedaante van=
 een halve maan met=20

scherpe, omgebogen punten; van kaap Cavallos ten noorden, of van de rotsen =
van Ilo ten zuiden,=20

gezien, doet zij u denken aan een reusachtigen visch, half onder het water =
bedolven. Tallooze=20

zwermen zeevogels, van de wanstaltige pelikaan tot den sierlijken bevallige=
n stormvogel, die van=20

den morgen tot den avond in den helderen zonneschijn heen en weder fladdere=
n en vliegen, rijzen=20

en dalen, dragen er toe bij om de gelijkenis nog treffender te maken: men z=
ou meenen een op het=20

strand geworpen walvisch te zien, omzwermd door gansche zwermen vraatzuchti=
ge roofvogels.=20

Elk jaar werpen ongeveer een veertigtal schepen, van Europa of Noord-Amerik=
a komende, en=20

naar Valparaiso of de tusschenliggende havens bestemd, te Islay het anker u=
it, om de producten=20

van het binnenland, die derwaarts worden gebracht, op te nemen. Gedurende e=
enige dagen komt=20

dan althans een vluchtige schijn van leven de doodsche eenzaamheid van de h=
aven en het=20

ellendige dorp bezielen. De echoos, gewoonlijk alleen antwoordende op het r=
uischen der golven,=20

het klagelijk loeien van den wind en het gebrul der zeehonden, worden nu ge=
wekt door de ruwe=20

liederen der half beschonken matrozen, in allerlei talen uitgegalmd: dan li=
gt het schip weer het=20

anker en alles verzinkt op nieuw voor geruimen tijd in hetzelfde sombere zw=
ijgen.  Op een fraaien=20

Julimorgen, hier dus in het hart van den winter, bevond ik mij aan boord va=
n de Vicar of Bray, een=20

fatsoenlijken driemaster, op de werven van Liverpool gebouwd, in gezelschap=
 van den=20

gezagvoerder van dat schip, den engelschen consul te Islay gevestigd, en va=
n eenige notabelen=20

van Arequipa. Reeds een goede veertien dagen geleden, had de kapitein ons h=
oofd voor hoofd=20

uitgenoodigd, met hem te dejeuneeren: nu zou eindelijk aan die uitnoodiging=
 gevolg worden=20

gegeven. Op het oogenblik, waarop dit verhaal begint, was het niet ver van =
elf uur; en hoewel het=20

dejeuner precies ten tien uur moest beginnen, had de hofmeester den matroos=
 van de wacht nog=20

niet het lang verwachte bevel gegeven om de bel te luiden. De genoodigden b=
egonnen lange=20

gezichten te trekken en gaapten van honger; toch deed ieder zijn best om zi=
ch goed te houden, en=20

babbelde lustig door, zonder zich schijnbaar over zijn maag te bekommeren. =
Terwijl het gesprek=20

van die heeren beurtelings vroolijk en ernstig werd, stond ik, op de versch=
ansing geleund, te kijken=20

naar de heuvelen van Islay, die door de vochtige nevels van October, hier t=
e lande onder den=20

naam van garuas bekend, gedurende een paar maanden met gras, bloemen, friss=
che wateren,=20

vogels en insecten zonden worden getooid, met alles, in n woord, wat er ged=
urende de negen of=20

tien overige maanden van het jaar even onbekend is als druiven of ananassen=
 in de dorre woestijn=20

van Sahara.  Eindelijk kwam er uitkomst. Een dier diepe zuchten, die, in de=
n schouwburg, als het=20

scherm, na eene lange vervelende pauze, weer opgaat, aan de borst van het p=
ubliek ontsnappen,=20

werd ook door onze vrienden geslaakt, toen, op het luiden der bel, de hofme=
ester uit de keuken=20



trad en over het dek naderde, met beide handen een schotel dragende, waarin=
, weelderig op een=20

bed van groenten rustende, een gebraden schapenbout van zeer eerbiedwaardig=
en omvang lag.=20

Wij haastten ons naar de trap van de kajuit, die wij gelijktijdig met den h=
ofmeester bereikten. Tien=20

minuten later hoorde men niets meer dan zekere eigenaardige, half onderdruk=
te geluiden,=20

begeleid door het gekletter van messen en vorken; ieder beijverde zich, den=
 verloren tijd zooveel=20

mogelijk in te halen. Met uitzondering van den schapenbout, die altijd in a=
lle Prince de Conti, the=20

Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility =
of France.  The=20

greatest possible gayety prevailed at court. The particular characteristic =
of this was that more=20

songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance. The court made s=
ongs on the=20

Parisians and the Parisians on the court; and the casualties, though not mo=
rtal, were painful, as=20

are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule.  In the midst of this s=
eeming hilarity,=20

nevertheless, people's minds were uneasy. Was Mazarin to remain the favorit=
e and minister of the=20

queen? Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there? Eve=
ry one hoped so,=20

so that the minister felt that all around him, beneath the homage of the co=
urtiers, lay a fund of=20

hatred, ill disguised by fear and interest. He felt ill at ease and at a lo=
ss what to do.  Conde=20

himself, whilst fighting for him, lost no opportunity of ridiculing, of hum=
bling him. The queen, on=20

whom he threw himself as sole support, seemed to him now not much to be rel=
ied upon.  When=20

the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged to stay until=
 the queen, who was=20

waited upon by a new deputation from Paris, had consulted with her minister=
 as to the propriety=20

and manner of receiving them. All were fully engrossed with the affairs of =
the day; Athos could not=20

therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends--p=
oor atoms, lost in=20

that raging whirlwind.  But Athos was a man of inflexible determination; he=
 firmly adhered to a=20

purpose once formed, when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to=
 be prompted by a=20

sense of duty. He insisted on being introduced, saying that although he was=
 not a deputy from=20

Monsieur de Conti, or Monsieur de Beaufort, or Monsieur de Bouillon, or Mon=
sieur d'Elbeuf, or the=20

coadjutor, or Madame de Longueville, or Broussel, or the Parliament, and al=
though he had come=20

on his own private account, he nevertheless had things to say to her majest=
y of the utmost=20

importance.  The conference being finished, the queen summoned him to her c=
abinet.  Athos was=20

introduced and announced by name. It was a name that too often resounded in=
 her majesty's ears=20

and too often vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize it=
; yet she remained=20

impassive, looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in =
women who are queens,=20

either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth.  "It is then a serv=
ice which you propose to=20

render us, count?" asked Anne of Austria, after a moment's silence.  "Yes, =
madame, another=20

service," said Athos, shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him.=
  Athos had a noble=20

heart, and made, therefore, but a poor courtier.  Anne frowned. Mazarin, wh=
o was sitting at a table=20

folding up papers, as if he had only been a secretary of state, looked up. =
 "Speak," said the queen.=20

Mazarin turned again to his papers.  "Madame," resumed Athos, "two of my fr=
iends, named=20

D'Artagnan and Monsieur du Vallon, sent to England by the cardinal, suddenl=
y disappeared when=20

they set foot on the shores of France; no one knows what has become of them=
."  "Well?" said the=20

queen.  "I address myself, therefore, first to the benevolence of your maje=
sty, that I may know=20

what has become of my friends, reserving to myself, if necessary, the right=
 of appealing hereafter=20

to your justice."  "Sir," replied Anne, with a degree of haughtiness which =
to certain persons=20



became impertinence, "this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst o=
f so many absorbing=20

concerns! an affair for the police! Well, sir, you ought to know that we no=
 longer have a police,=20

since we are no longer at Paris."  "I think your majesty will have no need =
to apply to the police to=20

know where my friends are, but that if you will deign to interrogate the ca=
rdinal he can reply=20

without any further inquiry than into his own recollections."  "But, God fo=
rgive me!" cried Anne, with=20

that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her, "I believe that you are y=
ourself interrogating."  "Yes,=20

madame, here I have a right to do so, for it concerns Monsieur d'Artagnan--=
-d'Artagnan," he=20

repeated, in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of t=
he weak and erring=20

woman.  The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistanc=
e of Anne.  "Sir," he=20

said, "I can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty. These indi=
viduals are under arrest.=20

They disobeyed orders."  "I beg of your majesty, then," said Athos, calmly =
and not=20

met een weinig goeden wil, toch verstaanbaar was; het dejeuner, waarop ik u=
 genoodigd heb, is=20

waarschijnlijk het laatste, dat wij te zamen gebruiken zullen; morgen, ten =
elf ure, ligt ik het anker=20

en ga onder zeil naar Santa-Maria de Belen do Para, waar mijn huwelijk met =
de dochter van een=20

mijner patroons zoo goed als bepaald is. Als ik getrouwd ben, verkoop ik Ma=
zarin, "to quash these=20

arrests of Messieurs d'Artagnan and du Vallon."  "What you ask is merely an=
 affair of discipline=20

and does not concern me," said the queen.  "Monsieur d'Artagnan never made =
such an answer as=20

that when the service of your majesty was concerned," said Athos, bowing wi=
th great dignity. He=20

was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him.  "You, too, have been i=
n England, sir?" he=20

said, making a sign to the queen, who was evidently going to issue a severe=
 order.  "I was a=20

witness of the last hours of Charles I. Poor king! culpable, at the most, o=
f weakness, how cruelly=20

punished by his subjects! Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to litt=
le purpose for devoted=20

hearts to serve the interests of princes. This is the second time that Mons=
ieur d'Artagnan has been=20

in England. He went the first time to save the honor of a great queen; the =
second, to avert the=20

death of a great king."  "Sir," said Anne to Mazarin, with an accent from w=
hich daily habits of=20

dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression, "see if we can =
do something for these=20

gentlemen."  "I wish to do, madame, all that your majesty pleases."  "Do wh=
at Monsieur de la Fere=20

requests; that is your name, is it not, sir?"  "I have another name, madame=
--I am called Athos."=20

"Madame," said=20


_
schoonvader, en word reeder, even als hij: dat is mijne toekomst. Maar dat =
ligt nog in het=20

verschiet; en in afwachting dat het uur van scheiden voor ons gekomen zij, =
zult gij mij wel willen=20

vergunnen, te herinneren aan zekere weddenschap, waarbij mijne eer als zeem=
an betrokken is.=20

Don Pablo Marcoy, onze vriend, die, terwijl ik spreek, bezig is een karikat=
uur van mij te maken met=20

een stukje brood, heeft zich, zoo als gij weet, voorgenomen, dezelfde reis =
te maken als ik;=20

bovendien heeft hij gewed, dat hij, den weg over land nemende, en aldus van=
 het zuidwesten naar=20

het noordoosten het groote vasteland doortrekkende, dat ik moet omzeilen, n=
og eer dan ik aan=20

den mond van de Amazone zou zijn. Ik heb de weddenschap aangenomen, maar zo=
nder den=20

inzet te bepalen. Wat zal nu die shall be fulfilled."  "You hear, sir?" sai=
d the queen.  "Yes,=20

madame, I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty. May I not=
 go and see my=20

friends?"  "Yes, sir, you shall see them. But, apropos, you belong to the F=
ronde, do you not?"=20

"Madame, I serve the king."  "Yes, in your own way."  "My way is the way of=
 all gentlemen, and I=20

know only one way," answered Athos, haughtily.  "Go, sir, then," said the q=
ueen; "you have=20

obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know."  Scarcely, howev=
er, had the tapestry=20

closed behind Athos when she said to Mazarin:  "Cardinal, desire them to ar=
rest that insolent=20

fellow before he leaves the court."  "Your majesty," answered Mazarin, "des=

what I was going to ask you to let me do. These bravoes who=20
