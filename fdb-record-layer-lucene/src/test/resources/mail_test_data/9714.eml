He muttered something about Ned's being a nice boy if he were not so "airy;=
" always "fussing=20

about his clothes and talking in a mincing way--just like a New York boy." =
 "Do you remember,"=20

said Nora, "how the boys plagued you in New York, merely because you didn't=
 talk and dress quite=20

as they do? Didn't you think it mean of them?"  "Mean as dirt," Oscar said =
promptly; "and I made=20

'em sick of it, too. I guess they won't try it on another Western feller!" =
 "But, my dear boy, don't you=20

see you are doing the same thing? You tease Ned and make him unhappy becaus=
e he doesn't=20

dress and talk like the boys you know at home."  Oscar shrugged his shoulde=
rs; then he laughed.=20

"Maybe you're right, Aunt Nora. Anyhow I didn't mean to be mean and I'm wil=
ling to make up if=20

Ned is!"  Nora squeezed the little grimy hand so affectionately that he shr=
ank back lest she should=20

kiss him, "before everybody"--the erratic and inconsiderate conduct of wome=
n in kissing boys was=20

one of his trials. However, she was more judicious. She went on: "I knew I =
could trust you to be=20

just, Oscar. Only you must remember that Ned isn't impulsive like you; it t=
akes him a long time to=20

obstinacy.  "The witness, gentlemen," said Pennington, K.C., in triumph to =
the jury, "has two moles=20

on his neck, exactly as described by Mr. Duncan Farll, but he will not disp=
lay them!"  Eleven legal=20

minds bent nobly to the problem whether the law and justice of England coul=
d compel a free man=20

to take his collar off if he refused to take his collar off. In the meantim=
e, of course, the case had to=20

proceed. The six or seven hundred pounds a day must be earned, and there we=

ly, she resolved to try to=20

soften Edmund's resentment before Oscar should speak to him. But the unfort=
unate Oscar did not=20

let a moment slip. No sooner was his aunt's back turned to speak to an acqu=
aintance than he=20

darted away "to find Ned." Ned was easily found. He was lying in his berth =
so bundled up in a rug=20

that only a patch of his hair was visible. The poor boy had been crying; bu=
t of course Oscar could=20

not know that. He began in a loud, cheerful voice that grated on Edmund's n=
erves. "I say, Ned,=20

s'pose we make up! we'd have lots more fun being friends; and I'll learn yo=
u how to box and=20

everything."  No answer.  "Say, Ned, are you 'sleep?"  "No, I'm not," came =
in a fierce, smothered=20

voice from the heap on the berth, "and I wish you'd leave me alone!"  "Then=
 you don't want to=20

make up and be friends?" said Oscar, in a changed voice.  "No, I don't."  "=
All right for you, then!"=20

said Oscar. With which withering sarcasm and a vast deal of dignity he marc=
hed out of the room.=20

"Catch me trying that Putney and also in Wandsworth. This was obviously tru=

been nothing but the widow of a builder in a small way of business well kno=
wn in Putney and also=20

in Wandsworth. She was every inch that.  "How did you first meet your prese=
nt husband, Mrs.=20

Leek?" asked Mr. Crepitude.  "Mrs. Farll, if you please," she cheerfully co=
rrected him.  "Well, Mrs.=20

Farll, then."  "I must say," she remarked conversationally, "it seems queer=
 you should be calling=20

me Mrs. Leek, when they're paying you to prove that I'm Mrs. Farll, Mr.----=
, excuse me, I forget=20

e a witness standing in=20

the box just as if she were standing in her kitchen talking to a tradesman =
at the door. He was not=20

accustomed to such a spectacle. And though Alice was his own witness he was=

because he was angry with her husband. He blushed. Juniors behind him could=
 watch the blush=20

creeping like a tide round the back of his neck over his exceedingly white =
collar.  "If you'll be good=20
