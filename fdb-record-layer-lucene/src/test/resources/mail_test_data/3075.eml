tared at her father. She=20

was unaccustomed to be addressed in that tone, and she resented it. Earley =
and Mr. Burgess=20

were her humble slaves. Captain Middleton did as he was told and became an =
elephant, a camel,=20

or a polar bear on the shortest notice, moreover he threw himself into the =
part with real goodwill=20

and enjoyment. The lazy man lying there on the sofa, who showed no flatteri=
ng pleasure in her=20

society, must be roused to a sense of his shortcomings. She seized the Tedd=
y-bear, swung it=20

round her head and brought it down with a resounding thump on Hugo's chest.=
 "Det up," she said=20

more loudly. "Loo don't seem to know any stolies, so you _mus'_ play wis me=
."  Hugo swung his=20

legs off the sofa and sat up to recover his breath, which had been knocked =
out of him by the=20

Teddy-bear.  "You're a very rude little girl," he said crossly. "You'll hav=
e to be punished if you do=20

that sort of thing."  "What sort of sing?"  "What you did just now; it's ve=
