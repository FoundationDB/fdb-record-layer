shut his eyes and groped helplessly for some hand-hold upon the suddenly re=
habilitated=20

responsibilities. Saturday--the day when Gryson would return with the proof=
s which, if they were to=20

serve any good end, must be given the widest possible publicity in the two =
days remaining before=20

the election. Blount recalled his carefully laid plans: he had intended giv=
ing Collins and the two=20

record clerks a half-holiday, so that Gryson might come and go unnoticed. A=
lso, he had meant to=20

make a definite appointment with Blenkinsop and the representative of the U=
nited Press, to the=20

end that there might be no delay in the firing of the mine. Lastly, Gryson =
must be shielded and=20

gotten out of the city in safety; so much the traitor had a right to demand=
 if he should risk his liberty=20

and his life by returning with the evidence.  It was a hideous tangle to ow=
e itself to the joyous=20

gambollings of the firemen's mascot dog. And there was more to it than the =
hopeless smashing of=20

the Saturday's plans. Into the midst of the mordant reflections, and adding=
 a sting which was all its=20

own, came the thought of this newest obligation laid upon him by his father=
 and his father's wife.=20

They had taken him in and were loading him down with kinsman gifts of care =
and loving-kindness,=20

while his purpose had been--must still be--to strike back like a merciless =
enemy. He remembered=20

the old fable of the adder warmed to life in a man's bosom, and it left him=
 sick and nerveless.=20

None the less, the obsession of the indomitable purpose persisted, gripping=
 him like the=20

compelling hand of a giant in whose grasp he was powerless. For a time he s=
ought to escape, not=20

realizing that the obsession was the call of the blood passed on from the m=
en of his race who, with=20

axe and rifle, had hewn and fought their way in the primeval wilderness, an=
d would not be denied.=20

Neither did he suspect that the dominating passion driving him on was his b=
est gift from the man=20

against whom he was pitting his strength. What he did presently realize was=
 that the giant grip of=20

purpose was not to be broken; and thereupon a vast cunning came to possess =
him. He must have=20

time and a chance to plan again: if he should feign sleep, perhaps the woma=
n whose presence=20

and personality were shackling the inventive thought would go away and leav=
e him free to think.=20

She did go after a while, though so noiselessly that when he opened his eye=
s it was with the fear=20

that he should see her still bending over the little embroidery frame at th=
e window. Finding himself=20

alone, he sat up in bed and gave the broken head an opportunity to blot him=
 out if it could. For a=20

little space the walls of the room became as the interior of a hollow peg-t=
op, spinning furiously with=20

a noise like the rushing of many waters. After the surroundings had resumed=
 their normal figurings=20

he rose to his knees. There was another grapple with the whirling peg-top, =
and again he mastered=20

the dizzying confusion. Made bold by success, he got his feet on the floor =
and stood up, clinging to=20

the brass foot-rail of the bed until the unstable encompassments had once m=
ore come to rest.  By=20

this time he was able to conquer all save the throbbing headache. Shuffling=
 first to one door and=20

then to the other, he shot the bolts against intrusion. Then he staggered a=
cross to the dressing-

case and took a look at himself in the glass. The bandaged head, with its h=
aggard, pain-distorted=20

face grimacing back at him, extorted a grunt of sardonic disapproval, but t=
he mirror answered the=20

query which had sent him stumbling across to it. The bandage was comparativ=
ely small and tightly=20

drawn; a soft hat could be worn over it--the hat would cover and decently h=
ide it.  Next he found=20

his clothes, those he had been wearing at the time of the accident. Somebod=
y had been thoughtful=20

enough to have them cleaned and pressed; from which he argued that the plun=
ging fall on the wet=20

asphalt had been demoralizing in more ways than one. Continuing the experim=
ental venture, he=20

walked back and forth and up and down until he could do it without clutchin=
g at the bed-rails to=20



save himself from falling. Then he reshot the door-bolts and went back to b=
ed to await=20

developments.  The first of these came when Patricia brought his luncheon. =
He had been=20

wondering if she would be the one to come; wondering and hoping. With the u=
nfilial purpose=20

driving him on, there were added twinges at the thought of his father's wif=
e going on piling the=20

mountain of obligation higher and still higher by waiting upon him, and thu=
s reminding him at every=20

turn of the adder fable. With Patricia it was different.  "Good morning," h=
e grimaced, when Patricia=20

came in with the daintily appointed server. "Getting a bit more of the firs=
t-aid practice, are you?"  "I=20

am obeying orders," she flashed back, when she had shaken up the pillows an=
d placed the=20

appetizing meal within his reach. "Mrs. Blount said I'd probably have a les=
s disturbing influence=20

upon you than she would. Shall I feed you?"  "Good heavens, no! I'm not tha=
t near dead, I hope! If=20

you don't believe it, you may sit down and watch me eat--if you're not miss=
ing your own luncheon."=20

"Nurses have no regular meal-times," she retorted. And then: "You are feeli=
ng a great deal better,=20

aren't you?"  "Much better--since you came. Did they tell you it was a dog?=
"  She nodded, and he=20

went on.  "It was my unlucky night, I guess. Did the fire burn up my office=
? I forgot to ask Mrs.=20

Blount about that."  "No; it was a building across the street from the Temp=
le Court."  "'Small favors=20

thankfully received,'" he quoted, resolutely pushing a fresh recurrence of =
the tomtom beatings into=20

the background; "small favors and larger ones in proportion--this broth, fo=
r example. It's simply=20

delicious. I hadn't realized how hungry I was."  "The broth ought to be goo=
d; I made it myself, you=20

know."  "You did? Where, for pity's sake?"  "In the hotel kitchen. The _che=
f_ was furious at first.=20

He twirled his Napoleon-III mustaches and sputtered and swelled up like an =
angry old turkey. But=20

when I talked nice to him in his own beloved Bordelaise he let me do anythi=
ng I pleased."  Blount=20

looked up quickly, and the movement brought the head-throbbings back with d=
isconcerting=20

celerity.  "You are cruelly kind to me, Patricia; everybody is kind to me. =
And I'm not needing=20

kindness just now," he ended.  "Aren't you? I don't agree with you, and I'm=
 sure your father and=20

Mrs. Blount wouldn't." Then she went on to tell him how they had all been u=
p, watching the=20

progress of the fire from their windows, when the word came that he had bee=
n hurt in the street.=20

Also, she told how his father had impatiently smashed the telephone because=
, the wires having=20

been cut and tangled in the fire, he could get no response, and how, thereu=
pon, he had turned the=20

entire night force of the hotel out to go in search of a doctor. "But with =
all that, he couldn't stand it=20

to look on while the doctor was taking the stitches," she added. "He turned=
 his back and tramped=20

over here to the window; and I could hear him gritting his teeth and--and s=
wearing."  If Evan Blount=20

ate faster than a sick man should, it was because there are limits to the f=
inest fortitude. Patricia=20

ran on cheerfully, minimizing her own part in the first-aid incidents, and =
magnifying the anxious=20

and affectionate concern of the senator and his wife. He listened because h=
e could not help it; but=20

when he had finished, and she was inquiring if there was anything else she =
could do for him, he=20

dissembled, saying that he would try to sleep, and asking her to shut out m=
ore of the daylight and=20

to deny him to everybody until evening.  She promised; but naturally enough=
, with the dreadful=20

responsibility drawing nearer with every hour-striking of the tiny leather-=
cased travelling-clock on=20

the dresser, sleep was out of the question for him. Hot-eyed and restless, =
he wore out the long=20

afternoon in feverish impatience, slipping now and then into the shadow lan=
d of delirium when the=20

pain was severest, but clinging always to the obsessing idea. At whatever c=
ost, the crisis must find=20

him resolute to do his part. Gryson must be met, the evidence of fraud must=
 be secured, and the=20



fraud itself must be defeated.  The bright autumn day was fading to its twi=
light, and the shadows=20

were gathering around his bed, when Patricia tiptoed in to ask, first, if h=
e were awake, and, next,=20

what he would like to have for his supper. Exhausted by the waiting battle,=
 he answered briefly: he=20

was not hungry; if he could be left alone again, with the assurance that no=
 one would come to=20

disturb him, it was all he would ask. He tried to say it crustily, with the=
 irritable impatience of the=20

convalescent--dissembling again. But the young woman with a self-sacrificia=
l career in view had=20

lost none of her womanly gift of sympathetic intuition.  "You are not so we=
ll this evening," she said=20

softly, laying a cool palm on his forehead. "I think I'd better telephone D=
octor Dillon."  Now the=20

thing for Patricia's lover to do was obvious. With pity thus trembling on t=
he very crumbling brink of=20

love, the opportunity which months of patient wooing had not evoked lay rea=
dy to his hand. It was=20

a fair measure of the mastery an obsession may obtain--the lover's ability =
to thrust the gentler=20

emotion into the background, to feign restless irritation under the passion=
-stirring touch, and to=20

say: "No; I don't want Dillon or anybody; I want to be left alone. Please l=

want to be disturbed."  She took the curt dismissal in silence, and after s=
he was gone Blount sat=20

up in bed and cursed himself fervently and painstakingly for the little bru=
tality. But the remorseful=20

cursings took nothing from the grim determination which had prompted the br=
utality. The dusk was=20

thickening, and the street electrics were turning the avenue into a broad h=
ighway of radiance.=20

Blount got up, and with a disheartening renewal of the splitting headache, =
began to dress, but=20

there were many pauses in which he had to sit on the edge of the bed to wai=
t for the throbbing=20

pain to subside.  The next step was to reach his own room, two floors above=
, and he let himself=20

cautiously into the corridor and locked the door from the outside. Making a=
 long round to avoid the=20

elevators, he dragged himself up two flights of stairs and so came to his g=
oal.  Enveloped in a rain-

coat, and with a soft hat drawn well over his eyes, he compassed the escape=
 from the upper floor=20

by means of the remote stair he had used in ascending, and so reached the g=
round-floor.=20

Fortunately, the lobby was crowded; and turning up the collar of the rain-c=
oat to hide the bandage,=20

Blount worked his way toward the revolving doors. More than once in the dod=
ging progress he=20

rubbed shoulders with men whom he knew, and who knew him; but the shielding=
 hat-brim and the=20

muffling rain-coat saved him.  Reaching the street, he did not attempt to w=
alk to the Temple Court.=20

Instead, he crept around to a garage near the hotel and hired a two-seated =
road-car. Quite=20

naturally, the garage-keeper wanted to send his own driver, and Blount coun=
ted it as an=20

unavoidable misfortune that he was obliged to give his name, and to hear th=
e motor-liveryman=20

say: "Oh, sure! I didn't recognize you, Mr. Blount. I reckon Senator Dave's=
 son can have anything=20

o' mine that he wants."  Blount drove the road-car all the way around the C=
apitol grounds to come=20

into his office street inconspicuously. Across from the Temple Court the fi=
re ruins were still=20

smouldering, and there was an acrid odor of stale smoke in the air. For a f=
ull third of the block the=20

street was littered with debris. Blount stopped his machine at the nearest =
corner and got out to=20

reconnoitre the office-building entrance. In the vestibule he glanced up at=
 the face of the=20

illuminated wall-clock, making a hasty calculation based upon the leaving t=

from its hiding-place under his coat and laid it on the desk. "It's all the=
