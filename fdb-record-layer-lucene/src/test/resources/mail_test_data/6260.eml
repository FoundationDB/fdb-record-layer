philodendron monstera Primrose;" but when morning after morning Miss Egerto=
n was still too busy to go into the question, Primrose began to have namele=

On this afternoon she walked quickly, and are one and the same thing, as is=

y to go into the question, Primrose began to have nameless little fears, an=
d had to scold herself for being fanciful and nervous.  On this afternoon s=
he walked quickly, and are one and the same thing, as is the case with Mr. =

e, you've gone and spoiled it. I was _
them."  Then Miss Egerton went downstairs to meet Primrose with a smile abo=
ut her thin lips, and=20

a serene, beautiful light in her kind eyes.  "They are getting ready--the r=
ooms are beginning to look=20

charming, dear," she said. "Oh no, you must not see them yet. It is my fanc=
y not to show them to=20

you until they are quite ready, and I fear that won't be until the day afte=
r to-morrow; but to-morrow,=20

Primrose, you and Jasmine and little Daisy may occupy yourselves packing yo=
ur trunks."  "It all=20

sounds delightful," said Primrose. "You cannot think, Miss Egerton, how che=
ered we all are at the=20

thought of coming to you. As to Daisy, I simply should not know her--she is=
 a changed child. I told=20

the Doves that we were leaving as I went out this afternoon. They looked ra=
ther cross, and Mrs.=20

Dove asked for a week's rent, instead of the usual notice. But I can manage=
 to pay that nicely. I=20

won't stay now, dear Miss Egerton. I'm going round to see Mr. Jones about t=
he plates he was to=20

try and sell for me, and then I shall hurry back to Daisy."  "Take her this=
 fresh egg and this little=20

sponge-loaf for her supper," said Miss Egerton. "Now good-bye, dear. God bl=
ess you, dear!"  "It is=20

wonderful what kind friends we girls seem to meet at every turn," thought P=
rimrose to herself, as=20

she hurried down the dirty, sloppy street. "It would be very strange if we =
did not succeed with so=20

many people wishing us well. Oh! I feel in good spirits to-night. Even if M=
r. Jones has not sold the=20

plates I shall not complain."  Mr. Jones assured his industrious pupil when=
 she entered his dark=20

little shop that he had "all but" got a customer for her. The customer was =
a wealthy old gentleman,=20

who had a passion for collecting china, and, in special, liked the work of =
beginners. The old=20

gentleman had looked at Primrose's plates, and had said that they were very=
 fine, and had a=20

certain crudity or freshness about them, which, for his part, he took to; a=
nd if she had three or four=20

more lessons he felt morally certain that he would purchase her wares.  "He=
's a splendid=20

customer, but he was most explicit on the point of more lessons, Miss Mainw=
aring," said Mr.=20

Jones.  "But you have found me so many 'all but' customers who just wished =
me to have a few=20

more lessons, Mr. Jones," said Primrose, smiling sadly.  "None like the pre=
sent man--none like the=20

present man, my dear young lady," answered Mr. Jones, rubbing his fat hands=
 softly together. "A=20

man who likes crudity, and calls it freshness, ain't to be found every day =
of the week, Miss=20

Mainwaring."  Primrose admitted this fact, and, bidding her teacher good ev=
ening, without=20

committing herself to any definite promise of taking further lessons, she t=
urned her steps=20

homewards. Even Mr. Jones had scarcely power to depress her to-night. She f=
elt brave and bright,=20

and all her youth made itself manifest in her springing, elastic step. Now =
that she was about to=20

leave them, she felt horrified at the thought of having lived so long with =
the Doves. Her sense of=20

relief at the thought of making her home with Miss Egerton was greater than=
 she could express.=20

She entered the house, and came upstairs singing a gay air under her breath=
.  At the door of their=20

attics she was met by Jasmine.  "Oh, Primrose! I have been watching for you=
. I am so glad you=20

have come. I cannot think what is the matter with Daisy."  "With Daisy?" ec=
hoed Primrose; "but I=20

left her so bright two hours ago."  "She was bright an hour ago, Primrose; =
she was sitting on the=20

floor with the Pink in her arms, and laughing and chatting. I put on my bon=
net, and left her alone=20

for about ten minutes while I ran round the corner to get what we wanted fo=
r our supper, and when=20

I came back she was sitting with her hands straight before her in her lap, =
and the Pink standing by=20

her side, and looking into her face and mewing and Daisy not taking a scrap=
 of notice, but with her=20

eyes fixed straight in front of her in quite a dreadful way. When I went up=
 to her and touched her,=20

she began to shiver, and then to cry, and then she said, 'oh Jasmine! we ca=
n't go away from here-



-we can't; oh, we can't! We mustn't do it, Jasmine; we must stay here alway=
s, always!'"  "Poor little=20

darling!" said Primrose. "She must have had a bad dream; certainly Miss Ege=
rton is right, and her=20

nerves are very much shaken and she wants change as soon as possible. Is sh=
e in the bedroom,=20

Jasmine?"  "Yes."  "Will you cook the supper, and I will go to her?"  Jasmi=
ne nodded, and=20

Primrose went straight into the other room. Her little sister had once more=
 flown to the Pink for=20

consolation; she was holding the little animal tightly in her arms, and was=
 rocking herself=20

backwards and forwards, and sobbing under her breath.  Primrose knelt down =
by her.  "What is it,=20

my own little darling?" she asked.  "Oh, nothing, Primrose," said poor litt=
le Daisy, raising her tear-

stained face; "nothing really, dear Primrose, only I don't like to leave th=
e poor Doves."  "Oh, is that=20

all?" said Primrose, in a very cheerful tone. "Why, Daisy, you did not at a=
ll mind leaving them a=20

couple of days ago; but if you are really fond of them you can still see th=
em occasionally, for we=20

are not going far away."  "I don't wish to leave the poor Doves," repeated =
Daisy, bending down=20

over the Pink, and her tears falling afresh.  "But, Daisy dear, how very fu=
nny of you to speak like=20

this! You know, darling, you must allow Jasmine and me to decide for you; w=
e feel that you will be=20

much happier and much more comfortable with Mrs. Egerton. Come, Daisy, thes=
e tears are very=20

bad for you in your weak state. Let me wash your face and hands, and take y=
ou into the other=20

room to a nice surprise supper sent by Miss Egerton."  But Daisy only shook=
 her head, and bent=20

lower over her cat, and repeated over, and over, and over:  "I can't go awa=
y from Mr. and Mrs.=20

Dove."  Poor Primrose became really alarmed at last.  "Daisy," she said, "t=
here must be some=20

reason for this sudden change in your wishes. You were quite delighted at t=
he thought of going to=20

Miss Egerton's an hour ago, when Jasmine was here; Jasmine went out, and wh=
en she came=20

back she found you in this state. Did you see anybody while Jasmine was out=
?"  "N--n--no--I=20

mean--I mean I can't say. Don't ask me, Primrose. Oh, Primrose, I'm such a =
miserable little girl!=20

but please, please, please don't take me away from the poor Doves."  Daisy =
cried herself nearly=20

into hysterics, and Primrose had at last to pacify her by assuring her that=
 they were not going=20

away from the Doves just yet.     CHAPTER XXVIII.  A STARTLING DISCOVERY.  =
 All through her=20

dreams that night Daisy sobbed and moaned. Primrose, lying awake by her sid=
e, felt more and=20

more alarmed and concerned. What was the matter with her little sister? She=
 felt completely=20

puzzled. The bright little castle in the air she and Jasmine had been build=
ing; the cheerful thought=20

of the cosy rooms which the girls were to share together in their friend's =
house; the dear delight of=20

having furniture of their very own again; all these very healthful and natu=
ral dreams were fading=20

and fading, for whenever Primrose even alluded to their leaving their prese=
nt quarters Daisy=20

clutched her hand, and looked at her with such pleading eyes, and used hurr=
ied words of such=20

anguished entreaty, that at last the eldest sister felt obliged to say--  "=
We will stay where we are,=20

Daisy, until you wish to leave."  Then the poor little thin face relaxed in=
to a wan smile, the lids=20

drooped over the tired blue eyes, and the child slept more peacefully.  Whe=
n Primrose felt her=20

head, however, it was feverish, and her little hands burned to the touch. S=
he went into the next=20

room and called Jasmine.  "Jasmine," she said, "I am going round to Mrs. Eg=
erton's; I am going to=20

tell her all about Daisy's alarm and terror. I am going to consult her, for=
 I know she means to be a=20

good friend to us. Jasmine, promise me one thing--don't leave Daisy alone w=
hile I am out. I cannot=20

in the least understand how it happened, but I feel sure she must have got =
some fright when you=20

were out last night."  "Oh, she couldn't have," answered Jasmine--"I locked=
 the door after me. I=20



never leave Daisy alone without locking the door. I won't leave her now, of=
 course, Primrose--I will=20

take my little writing table close to her bedside, and if she wakes I can r=
ead her a part of my=20

novel."  Primrose gave one or two more directions, and then hurried out, an=
d Jasmine, after she=20

had washed up the breakfast things, and put the little sitting-room perfect=
ly tidy, moved her small=20

writing-table into the bedroom, and sat down by Daisy's side. She was in th=
e scribbling stage of=20

her great work, and with her head bent low, her cheeks flushed, and her fin=
gers much stained with=20

ink, was writing away with great rapidity, when she was startled by some ve=
ry earnest words from=20

the little sleeper.  "Oh, no, indeed, Mr. Dove--oh no, you may be quite cer=
tain. I know where I'd go=20

if I told a lie, of course, Mr. Dove. Yes, yes, you are my friend, and I'm =
your friend--yes, yes."=20

"Daisy, do wake up," said Jasmine; "you are talking such rubbish about Mr. =
Dove, and about=20

telling lies, and Mr. Dove being your friend--open your eyes, Daisy, and le=
t me give you such a=20

nice little breakfast."  "Is that you, Jasmine?" said Daisy--"I thought you=
 were Mr. Dove--I was=20

asleep, and I was dreaming."  "Yes, Eyebright, and talking in your dreams,"=
 said Jasmine,=20

stooping down and kissing her.  Daisy held one of Jasmine's hands very tigh=
tly.  "Did I say=20

anything, Jasmine--anything that you shouldn't hear--anything about--about =
sticky sweetmeats,=20

Jasmine?"  "No, you silly pet, not a word. Now sit up in bed, and let me gi=
ve you your breakfast.=20

Daisy, I really do think my novel is going to be a great success. I am goin=
g to put Mr. Dove into it,=20

and Mrs. Dove, and Tommy Dove, and our dear old Poppy, and of course oursel=
ves. One reason=20

why I feel so confident that the novel will be a success is that _all_ the =
characters will be sketched=20

from the life."  "But please don't put in about the Doves," said Daisy. "I =
think they are such dread--I=20

mean, of course, they are my friends, particularly Mr. Dove, he's my real, =
real friend, but I mean=20

that I don't think they'd come well into a book, Jasmine--I don't think the=
y're book people a bit--

book people should be princes and knights and lovely ladies, and there shou=
ld be no houses, and=20

no attics, only there might be fairy palaces, and all the little girls shou=
ld be happy, and kept safe=20

from ogres--the little girls in the books shouldn't even have an ogre for a=
 friend. Oh, Jasmine,=20

Jasmine! I'm so very miserable!"  Daisy again broke into weak sobs, and poo=
r Jasmine could=20

scarcely soothe her.  A little before noon Primrose and Miss Egerton, and a=
 tall, grave, kind-

looking man, who went by the name of Dr. Griffiths, and was a great friend =
of Miss Egerton's,=20

came up the stairs.  Both Dove and his wife saw them go, and Dove shook his=
 hand at Dr.=20

Griffiths, as that gentleman walked up the stairs. They all three went into=
 the attics, and the doctor=20

had a long talk with the little patient--he felt her pulse and her head, an=
d looked into her eyes, and=20

tried to induce her to laugh, and did succeed in getting one little startle=
d and half-frightened sound=20

from the child; then he went back into the sitting-room, and had a long tal=
k with Primrose and Miss=20

Egerton. The upshot of this was that Miss Egerton went sorrowfully away, fo=
r the doctor absolutely=20

forbade the girls to move from their present quarters for another week or f=
ortnight. At the end of=20

that time he said Daisy would be better, and might have got over the foolis=
h fancy which now=20

troubled her, but for the time being she must be yielded to, and at any ris=
k kept easy in her mind.=20

Miss Egerton went very sorrowfully away, and upstairs to the rooms she mean=
t to make so pretty.=20

"There is no special hurry about the furnishing, Bridget," she said to her =
servant. "Little Miss Daisy=20

is too ill to be moved for the present."  "The men have come round to be pa=
id for the bits of=20

furniture, leastways, ma'am," answered Bridget, "and the foreman from the o=
ther shop is standing=20

in the hall, and wants to know if you'll settle with him now, or if he shal=
l call again."  "I'll settle with=20



him now, Bridget. Dear Miss Primrose left some money in my charge yesterday=
 morning, and I can=20

pay the man at once."  One of the rules of Miss Egerton's life was never to=
 leave a bill unpaid for=20

twenty-four hours, if possible--she hated accounts, and always paid ready m=
oney for everything.=20

She now ran downstairs, and unlocking her desk, took out Mr. Danesfield's e=
nvelope. Primrose=20

had begged of her to open it when the bills came in, and pay for the furnit=
ure--Primrose seemed to=20

have an absolute prejudice against unfastening that envelope herself.  Miss=
 Egerton opened it=20

slowly now, smiling as she did so at the quaint inscription on the cover. A=
 folded sheet of paper lay=20

within--she spread the paper before her, expecting to see the three five-po=
und notes folded within=20

its leaves--blankness and emptiness alone met her view--no money was inside=
 the envelope--the=20

whole thing was a cruel fraud. The poor governess fairly gasped for breath-=
-there lay the bill for six=20

pounds nineteen shillings which she had incurred, making sure that she coul=
d meet it out of=20

Primrose's money. Primrose had spoken so confidently about her little nest-=
egg, and behold, she=20

had not any!--the envelope was a fraud--the girl had been subjected to a cr=
uel practical joke.  Miss=20

Egerton was extremely poor--it was with the utmost difficulty she could mak=
e two ends meet. She=20

thought hard for a minute--then her brow cleared, and she rose to her feet.=
  "Better I than those=20

orphan girls!" she said, under her breath, and then she went to her desk ag=
ain, and filled in a=20

cheque for the amount.  "I can do without my winter cloak, and my black mer=
ino dress will last me=20

for some weeks longer if I sponge it with cold tea, and re-line the tail," =
she said to herself. "Any=20

little privation is better than to hurt the hearts of the orphan girls."  S=
he paid the man, who signed=20

the receipt, and then she let him out herself. As she did so a young man ca=
me hastily up the=20

steps--he had a bright face, and running up to the governess, he seized bot=
h her hands in his.=20

"Oh, Arthur, how glad I am to see you!" said Miss Egerton.     CHAPTER XXIX=
.  A BLESSING.=20

Miss Egerton took Arthur Noel--for it was he--straight back into her little=
 sitting-room, and sitting=20

down on her worn little horse-hair sofa, and raising her eyes anxiously to =
the young man's face,=20

she told him the story of the attic upstairs, of the furniture she had purc=
hased, of the girls she had=20

meant to serve. She showed him, with hands that trembled, the envelope with=
 its queer inscription,=20

and she unfolded for his benefit the empty sheet of blank paper. She told h=
er story at once without=20

any reservation, even relating with a little hasty blush how she felt oblig=
ed to pay for the furniture=20

herself.  Perhaps Arthur Noel was the only person in the world to whom she =
would have made this=20

confession; for she was one of those who made it a practice never to let he=
r right hand know what=20

her left did, but she had known Arthur from his boyhood, and he was one of =
those men who inspire=20

trust and sympathy at a glance.  He listened to the story with interest, an=
d even excitement--he=20

was naturally enthusiastic, but even Miss Egerton had never seen him so per=
turbed and so moved=20

as he was at present.  "I know about those girls," he said at last; "what a=
re their names?--I am=20

sure I know about them. Nay, let me ask you a question--Is not one called J=
asmine? Has she not a=20

piquant face, and very soft and yet bright eyes, and a great lot of curly b=
rown hair? Yes, Miss=20

Egerton, I am sure the girls you speak of are in a certain sense _my_ girls=
; for if they are the ones=20

I mean I took them under my protection long ago."  "Their name is Mainwarin=
g. My dear Arthur,=20

where and how have you met them? My dear boy, I fully believe, I have alway=
s believed, in your=20

good intentions, in your wish to do your utmost for every one; but if you h=
ave really known=20

Primrose, and Jasmine and Daisy, and have taken them, as you say, under you=
r protection, I must=20

say that of late you have lost sight of them--you have not been as kind as =
you generally are to=20



people in difficulties, for I never met three more absolutely friendless gi=
rls than these."  "It was a=20

good Providence sent me here this morning," said Noel. "You are quite right=
, Miss Egerton; I did=20

lose sight of the children. I tried to follow them, but they managed to hid=
e themselves most=20

effectually. Think of my coming up to see you this morning, with a message =
from Mrs. Ellsworthy,=20

and finding that our lost lambs are all but safe in your kind fold. How rel=
ieved my dear mother-

friend will be!"  "Mrs. Ellsworthy is the kindest and best of women," said =
Miss Egerton; "I will=20

receive your message presently, Arthur, but you puzzle me more and more whe=
n you tell me that=20

she too knows my girls. I came across them quite accidentally. They called =
to ask me to give=20

Jasmine lessons in English composition, and I took a fancy to them, and, in=
 particular, felt drawn=20

to the little one--for she reminded me of--, but no matter! The girls have =
been in and out of my=20

house ever since. I saw that they were fearfully independent, but in many t=
rivial ways I tried to help=20

them. Well, Arthur, it is most surprising--it is altogether incomprehensibl=
e, but never during the=20

months we have been seeing each other daily have they alluded to you or the=
 Ellsworthys. They=20

seemed perfectly unconstrained, and chatted many times of their cottage hom=
e in the country, but=20

they never spoke of the Ellsworthys."  "They would not be likely to do," an=
swered Noel. "I think,=20

Miss Egerton, I must now tell you Mrs. Ellsworthy's and my side of the stor=
y."  Certainly Miss=20

Egerton appeared to neglect her duties that morning; fortunately, her schoo=
l had not yet re-

opened, but Bridget waited for orders, and the tradesman left the house una=
ttended to. Bridget=20

knew that Miss Egerton was always greatly taken up with Mr. Noel, and she h=
ad to admit that he=20

was a bonny-looking young man with a pleasant face; but Bridget hitherto ha=
d given her mistress=20

credit for always putting duty before pleasure. What, therefore, did her pr=
esent neglect of=20

household management mean?  Arthur Noel had a long story to tell, and Miss =
Egerton listened,=20

weighing each point, and not giving too undue sympathy to either party. Noe=
l was of course=20

enthusiastic in Mrs. Ellsworthy's cause, and announced his intention of goi=
ng to see her that very=20

day.  "She is in town," he said; "and if you give me the girls' address I c=
an bring her to them this=20

afternoon."  But here Miss Egerton laid her thin hand on the young man's ar=
m.  "No, Arthur, I won't=20

betray their secret, poor little dears! they may have been headstrong, and =
silly, and rash, and,=20

poor children, they may fail utterly, but they have not failed yet by any m=
eans, and if they wish not=20

to be tempted into a luxurious and dependent life, even by the kindest frie=
nd, I, for one, will stand=20

by them. You have come on me by accident, Arthur, and have learned about th=
e girls by accident;=20

you have no right to tell what you have thus discovered. I have studied tho=
se girls' characters and=20

I know that Primrose at least would die of a broken heart if her independen=
ce were taken from her.=20

No, Arthur; if you wish really to help them you must put them in the way of=
 earning their own living,=20

and in this manner the Ellsworthys can doubtless assist, for they are rich,=
 and have influence."=20

Then Miss Egerton and her guest had another long and earnest discussion, at=
 the end of which=20

time a compromise was arrived at. Noel might tell the Ellsworthys that he a=
nd Miss Egerton knew=20

where the girls lived, and the Ellsworthys might give in-direct help by aid=
ing him in his efforts to=20

find suitable work for Primrose and Jasmine--he too, could be their open an=
d acknowledged friend,=20

and he arranged with Miss Egerton to call and see them that very afternoon.=
  Finally, Miss Egerton=20

again drew his attention to the envelope, which was only given to mock, as =
it contained nothing=20

but blank paper.  Noel examined it carefully.  "This must have been given t=
o the girls by Mr.=20

Danesfield, the banker at Rosebury," he said. "I know him well; he is the l=
ast person who would=20



play them such a trick. Don't you think, Miss Egerton it is quite possible =
that this envelope may=20

have been opened, and the money removed?"  "But the envelope does not look =
tampered with,"=20

answered Miss Egerton, turning it round, and examining it carefully.  "Thie=
ves are very clever,"=20

answered Noel. "It is easy to open an envelope by holding it over steaming =
water."  "But Primrose=20

always kept this letter locked up in her trunk."  "Well, I will settle the =
point by writing direct, and in=20

strict confidence, to Mr. Danesfield. In the meantime let us say nothing to=
 Miss Mainwaring; and=20

you will let me pay for the furniture, kind friend."  But Miss Egerton's fa=
ce flushed brightly, and she=20

drew back a step or two.  "No, my dear boy, I cannot. Since I drew that che=
que I have felt=20

strangely happy. I think this very small act of self-denial will bring me a=
 blessing, and I don't wish=20

to be deprived of it. Good-bye, Arthur; come to see me again at three, and =
I will take you to my=20

girls."     CHAPTER XXX.  VOICE OF THE PRINCE.   Daisy felt quite certain t=
hat the Prince had=20

come. Jasmine greeted her old friend of St. Paul's Cathedral with sparkling=
 eyes and effusive=20

words of welcome. Primrose, too, was very pleased to see any one who brough=
t such a contented=20

look into Daisy's little face, for the child asked herself to sit in his ar=
ms, and laying her head on his=20

shoulder, she listened with pleasure to some wonderful fairy stories which =
he related. While Noel=20

was by, Daisy seemed quite to forget her nervous  It became evident that th=
ere was no intention=20

on the part of any to leave the room, and so the Elder called the mixed cro=
wd to order.  The first=20

half-hour proved so tame that some who had remained to see trouble, got up =
and went home. At=20

last Mr. Beaver rose, and the audience caught its breath. He poised himself=
 on one foot, and=20

began to pump, blink, whistle, and finally to stutter.  "M-M-Mr. Ch-ch-ch-c=
hairman!" he called in a=20

high excited voice.  Elder Fox declared that Mr. Beaver had the floor, and =
Mr. Beaver proceeded=20

to take it, at least a good part of the section round which he was hopping.=
 People moved back and=20

gave him room, for he needed plenty of space in which to make himself under=
stood.  "The p-p-

parish c-committee h-h-has d-decided that M-Mr. McGowan is not the m-m-man =
for our ch-ch-

church. Elder F-F-Fox has the report of the c-c-committee. I m-m-move we h-=
h-h-hear him now!"=20

Mr. Fox mounted the platform and came forward to the edge. He looked into t=
he faces of those=20

before him with deep sadness in his own.  "Friends, this is one of the sadd=
est moments of my life,"=20

he began, his voice shaking with feeling. "Some--er--have come to love our =
young brother who=20

has been called to our church. And he has many very estimable qualities. Fo=
r that reason I feel=20

very keenly what I am about to say. The committee feels that Mr. McGowan ho=
lds ideas that are=20

too far advanced for our humble little church. We must not overlook the fac=
t that we hold sacred=20

some of the things to which he flippantly referred to-night, and it is our =
duty to protect--er--the=20

sacred doctrines which have been handed down to us from the more sacred mem=
ory of our=20

fathers and martyrs of the past.  "Our minister does not believe in the div=
ine inspiration of the=20

Bible. The question was put to him by one of the members of this committee,=
 and he replied--er--

that even if every jot and tittle were personally dictated by God--which he=
 doubted--the Bible would=20

remain a sealed book unless it inspired those who read it. It is evident fr=
om this answer that he=20

does not believe in--er--our sacred doctrine of the verbal inspiration of S=
cripture.  "You have heard=20

him to-night, asking us--er--in the common slang of the dock to rid ourselv=
es of all these doctrines=20

on which the church has been founded. What he said proves that he does not =
believe in the=20

fundamentals of Christian faith.  "I need not go back of this sermon so fre=
sh in our minds to prove=20

to your intelligence that Mr. McGowan is not orthodox. I could call to your=
 attention many=20



unfortunate statements, but I feel that it is not necessary. Your committee=
 has gone over every=20

detail--er--prayerfully and thoughtfully. Truly, it gives me a pain----"  "=
Get a bottle of Watkins'=20

Relief!" piped a shrill voice through the partially opened window.  Taken b=
y surprise, and with his=20

mouth open, the Elder lost every expression of dignity as he gazed in the d=
irection whence the=20

advice had come. Before he could again gather up the threads of his closing=
 remarks several men=20

were demanding the floor. The Elder scanned the faces of all, in order to p=
lace friend and foe. He=20

then fixed his glance on some one at the rear of the room. In answer to the=
 Elder's nod a heavy=20

basso pealed forth.  Every head turned about, and as the buzz of comment br=
oke from the=20

astonished crowd the Elder rapped for order. The Reverend Mr. Means of New =
York City moved=20

ponderously forward.  The faces of the sympathetic ones in the audience bec=
ame exceedingly=20

serious as each looked into the face of the city clergyman. Certainly, this=
 meeting must be of=20

tremendous importance to lead so great a man to leave his metropolitan pulp=
it to attend a=20

gathering in so small a church.  "We must have better order!" cried Mr. Fox=
, smiling a welcome to=20

the visiting minister. "We have the unexpected pleasure of a visit from--er=
--our much-loved friend=20

and brother. Shall we dispense with the business of the hour and hear what =
the Reverend Mr.=20

Means may have on his heart?"  Mr. Means took his position near the moderat=
or. With a long=20

sympathetic look he searched the invisible among the shadows of the ceiling=
. He was calm, too=20

calm, thought the Captain. He drew his frock coat about him, and plunged th=
e fingers of his right=20

hand in between the two buttons over his heart. That attitude, as of one we=
ary with the struggles=20

of men and yet tolerant because of long-suffering kindness, had an immediat=
e effect on part of the=20

audience. From somewhere near the center of the room applause started, and =
soon swelled to a=20

moderate ovation. He acknowledged the respect shown him by bringing his eye=
s down to the level=20

of his audience.  "Brethren,"--his voice trembled as he began to speak,--"I=
 have no special=20

message for you to-night; my heart is too sore from the things I have just =
seen and heard. I have=20

been in the rear of this room during your entire service. I have listened t=
o the unfortunate sermon=20

which your bright young minister was so unwise as to preach. I do not marve=
l that you are like a=20

flock of sheep having no shepherd; that sermon was enough to confuse even m=
e, and I have been=20

in the ministry a great many years. I feel I must say something, but I earn=
estly pray that it may not=20

influence you in this matter which is yours to decide. I do not intend to e=
ven suggest what action=20

you ought to take on the report of your parish committee. You must remember=
 that what you do to-

night may affect the future of our young brother, and you must not wreck th=
at future. Mr. McGowan=20

and I do not agree on matters of theology, but that fact does not prevent m=
e from admiring some=20

of his fine qualities to which your senior Elder referred to-night. Time ma=
y cool the ardor of his=20

youth into sane and safe ideas.  "But,"--he lifted his hands toward heaven =
and his voice toward the=20

people,--"what your parish committee chairman has told you in his report is=
 true, only too true. We=20

cannot afford to permit our churches to suffer from such teachings as those=
 given you to-night,=20

and I dare say, which have been given you many times past. Brethren, as gre=
at as is our love for=20

this young minister, it is as nothing in comparison with the devotion that =
should be ours where the=20

doctrines of our church are concerned. I opposed the ordination of Mr. McGo=
wan in the New York=20

Presbytery a year ago on the ground that he was not sound in doctrine, but =
when my brethren=20

passed him over my protest I acquiesced as a Christian must always do when =
the voice of the=20

majority speaks. But I must say that I greatly deplored the action taken at=
 that time. Not that I hold=20



any personal feelings against the young man, but because I am opposed to un=
orthodox men being=20

called to our pulpits.  "Now, brethren, I should gladly waive all this," he=
 continued, dropping his=20

voice to a soothing whisper, "but theological differences are not all that =
stand between the young=20

man and a faithful church. You've heard him suggest that the church which s=
hould be the house of=20

God, and which Scripture calls the house of prayer, be turned into a playho=
use for the community.=20

I cannot imagine any man with a passion to save souls holding to an idea th=
at he can accomplish=20

this by desecrating the place of Divine Worship by turning it into a gymnas=
ium. The only=20

explanation possible is that Mr. McGowan has not been reared under the infl=
uences of our best=20

families. Not that this is anything against his character, but fact is fact=
."  The room became quiet=20

with interest in anticipation of what might follow. It was true that their =
minister had come to them as=20

an unknown man, and they were certainly entitled to any disclosure of his p=
ast that the city man=20

might wish to give. But there was nothing more said on the subject, and a m=
urmur of disapproval=20

ran over the audience.  "I have finished, except to say that I honor your E=
lder for the firm stand he=20

has taken. Mr. Fox, you are to be congratulated on your courage, and althou=
gh I repeat that I=20

would not think of influencing the action of this assembly, I hope that eve=
ry man and woman=20

present may see fit to support you."  Captain Pott had grown more and more =
restless as time went=20

on, and now as the city minister began to move from the platform the Captai=
n began to move=20

toward the open window.  "I am ready to entertain any motion which you care=
 to make,"=20

announced the chairman.  Mr. Beaver rose. With the first hiss from his lips=
, the Captain dropped=20

his hand over the sill and tapped the outside of the casing. Shouts went up=
 from the boys who=20

stood beneath the window. These were answered by cries of fire from various=
 parts of town. The=20

clang of the gong at the fire-house broke through the stillness of the crow=
ded room. Distant alarms=20

were rung with steady regularity. The meeting adjourned in a body.  The sea=
man had kept his=20

promise, and "Providence had cut the pack for the new deal."     CHAPTER IX=
   In an incredibly=20

short time the church was emptied. Each one in the crowd was shouting wild =
conjectures as to=20

whose place was on fire as they ran in the direction of the blaze. It was a=
 strange sight that met=20

the gaze of the excited people as they came in full view of Dan Trelaw's pl=
ace. He was busily=20

engaged pouring oil on unburned sections of his hen-coops! Dan's hen-houses=
 were located at the=20

rear of his property, and had been built from a collection of dry-goods box=
es. They had been the=20

pride of his life, and as the crowd watched him pour on more oil, some one =
declared that Dan must=20

have gone out of his senses. Nor would he permit the fire company to play t=
heir chemical hose.=20

"It's come to a purty pass," Dan stated to the onlookers, "when a man can't=
 burn down his own=20

coops to get rid of the mites without the whole blame town turning out to i=
nterfere. If the very last=20

one of you don't clear out, I'll use my office as constable of this town to=
 run the lot of you in!"  Hank=20

Simpson was the chief of the volunteer corps, and Dan was chief of the Litt=
le River police system.=20

The two chiefs argued as to the rights of the respective offices. Hank decl=
ared it was his official=20

duty to put the fire out. Dan as emphatically declared it was his official =
duty to disperse the crowd.=20

Finally, Hank admitted that Dan had a right to burn his own property so lon=
g as the property of=20

others was not endangered. Some say that the chief of police answered the c=
hief of the fire corps=20

with a slow and deliberate wink.  "Now, all of you clear out and leave me t=
o my fire," demanded=20

Dan, as he poured on more oil.  Mr. McGowan had gone directly home after th=
e preaching service.=20

But he did not sleep that night. It was very early on Monday morning when h=
e entered the kitchen.=20



Miss Pipkin was already busy with the preparations for breakfast.  "Good mo=
rning, Mr. McGowan,"=20

greeted Miss Pipkin, cheerily. "Are you all right this morning?"  "Yes, tha=
nk you, Miss Pipkin."  "I=20

was afraid you'd be sick after last night. I didn't sleep none, I was that =
excited when I got home.=20

I've always been used to quiet meetings, and that last night after you left=
 was a disgrace. But you=20

wasn't to blame, no siree!" she finished with a vigorous shake of her head.=
  "I am not so sure that=20

you would find very many to agree with you."  "Lan' sakes! How you do talk,=
 Mr. McGowan! Don't=20

you think I know what it's all about? I ain't blind, and what I couldn't se=
e through, Josiah helped me=20

with last night. You've got him to thank that they didn't vote you out of y=
our position."  "Miss Pipkin,=20

do you mean that the Captain spoke up in meeting?"  "Well, he didn't exactl=
y talk, but he stopped=20

others from talking, and that's about the same thing."  "How?" asked the mi=
nister eagerly.  "He=20

kind of made me promise not to tell a soul, but I don't think he meant you.=
 Anyhow, you should=20

know. You see, he was setting by a window, and some of the boys from your c=
lub was on the=20

outside, waiting. He h'isted the window a little so's to get his hand throu=
gh. Hank Simpson and=20

some others was at the fire-house, and when Josiah give them beneath the wi=
ndow some sort of=20

signal, they all shouted '_Fire_.' That was the sign for others scattered r=
ound town, and they=20

begun to shout, too. Then, those at the fire-house got the cart out and run=
g the bells. It was real=20

funny, but don't tell Josiah I said so, because he was all puffed up last n=
ight. He gave his signal=20

just as Mr. Beaver got up to make a motion to have you put out. Things was =
pretty strong against=20

you after Reverend Mr. Means spoke."  "Mr. Means!"  "Um-hm. He was there as=
 big as life and=20

sad as Job. He talked so tearful-like that everybody was upset, but they di=
dn't get to take a vote,=20

and that was a good thing, for there were some there that would have voted =
against you, being so=20

worked up, who wouldn't think of it in their right senses. Mr. McGowan, the=
m boys down to the Inn=20

ain't going to let you go from the town if they can keep you here. Them boy=
s with Josiah got up=20

that fire scare last night."  "But it was more than a scare, I saw the fire=
."  "Course you did. 'Twas=20

old Dan Trelaw's hen-house that was burned down. The mites was bothering hi=
m, and he wanted=20

the insurance to build a better one."  "He burned his hen-house to collect =
insurance?"  "That's=20

what Josiah said."  "That's absurd. There isn't an insurance company in Suf=
folk County that would=20

write a policy on such junk, and if they did he could never collect a cent =
if it is known he burned it=20

on purpose."  "Josiah said it wasn't a regular company, just local. I guess=
 he'll get his money, all=20

right. Are you ready for your breakfast?"  A boyish grin slowly lighted the=
 minister's face as the=20

truth of what had happened dawned on him.  "Do you mean----"  "I ain't sayi=
ng right out just what I=20

mean," she broke in as she paused on the kitchen threshold. "If you're real=
 bright on guessing,=20

you'll be able to figure that out for yourself. The thing that's most inter=
esting to me is that the Lord=20

is wonderful in the performing of all His works, and we ain't to question h=
ow He brings 'em to pass.=20

I wasn't much in favor of the way Josiah done last night when he first told=
 me, but the more I think=20

about it, the more it seems all right to me. It didn't seem dignified and n=
ice to break up even a bad=20

meeting that way, but what else was he to do? You've got to stay here, that=
's plain, and if He ain't=20

got saints enough to keep you He'll use the heathen.... Go right in and set=
 down."  "I'm not sure=20

that it will bring Providence or any one else much glory if I stay here," s=
aid the minister, with a faint=20

smile.  Miss Pipkin returned with a steaming pot of coffee. She took her pl=
ace at the table and for=20

some time eyed the minister in silence. She was a thoroughgoing mystic in h=
er religious faith, but=20

her mysticism was tempered with such a practical turn of mind that it was w=
holesome and=20



inspiring.  "Mr. McGowan, it is the will of God that you stay right here in=
 this town. If we do His will=20

we ain't to worry about the glory part," she emphatically affirmed. She pla=
ced the cups and=20

saucers beside the coffee-pot and filled them. "You hit 'em hard last night=
, and that is exactly=20

what's ailing them. You've been hitting 'em too hard for comfort. The shoe'=
s pinching and they're=20

not able to keep from showing how it hurts. You hit me, too," she observed,=
 looking earnestly into=20

the minister's eyes.  "I'm sorry."  "You needn't be, 'cause it wasn't you s=
peaking. It was God=20

speaking through you. Them words you used for your text rung in my ears all=
 night long. I could=20

hear 'em plainer than when you spoke 'em from the pulpit: 'Launch out into =
the deep.' Mr.=20

McGowan, do you believe there is any forgiveness for the unpardonable sin?"=
  Evidently knowing=20

that a minister of the Presbyterian faith could entertain but one answer an=
d remain a moral man,=20

she did not wait for a reply.  "It was years ago when I first heard them wo=
rds. They were just as=20

plain to me then as they was last night, but I refused to obey 'em. I didn'=
t think I could stand the=20

ocean. You know the way I was coming over from Riverhead. Well, I'm always =
sick on the water,=20

and so I said right out that I wouldn't set sail as a seaman's wife. I was =
young and strong-headed=20

then, and didn't understand. The man I said 'No' to went off, and I never h=
eard from him but three=20

times since. Some said he was drowned at sea, but I know he wasn't. I've be=
en true to him all=20

these years, trying to atone for my sin of disobedience. If he'd come back =
now, I'd go with him=20

though he'd slay me."  Mr. McGowan wanted to smile at the mixed figure, but=
 the serious face=20

before him prevented him. "Did you say you never heard from him?" he asked,=
 sympathetically.=20

"No. I didn't say that." She spoke sharply, but immediately her face and to=
ne softened. "I didn't=20

mean to speak cross, but I ain't spoke of this for years, and it upsets me =
when I think of what I=20

done."  "We'll not speak of it, then."  "It won't disturb me the least bit.=
 It sort of helps to talk about it.=20

I'm thinking all the time about him, how brave he was. He was so manly, too=
, was my Adoniah."=20

"Adoniah?" questioned the minister, sitting up with a suddenness that aston=
ished Miss Pipkin.=20

"Adoniah was his first name. I ain't spoke it out loud for years. It does s=
ound sort of queer, doesn't=20

it? I didn't think so then." She sighed deeply. "The spirit of the Lord see=
med to go away from me=20

when Adoniah did. If only he'd come back."  "He has not left you. God is no=
t a hard master,=20

leaving people alone for their shortcomings."  "Do you think He'll send him=
 back to me?"  "He is=20

here now. He has never left you."  Miss Pipkin looked dazed, then puzzled, =
and finally provoked. "I=20

didn't think you'd trifle, or I'd never told you."  "Indeed, I'm not trifli=
ng."  "Then, what happened last=20

night has gone to your head, poor thing! I'd ought to have known better tha=
n to have troubled you=20

with my sorrows. You've got all you ought to carry. Poor thing!"  She slowl=
y pushed her chair from=20

the table, eyeing the minister as though expecting signs of an outbreak. Bu=
t he motioned her back=20

into her chair with a calmness that reassured her.  "I don't quite understa=
nd your meaning, I=20

guess," she said.  "And it is quite apparent that I didn't understand yours=
. You were speaking of=20

the Spirit of God leaving you, and I said He was right here with you----"  =
"Now, ain't I a caution to=20

saints!" broke in Miss Pipkin. "I did mix you up awful, didn't I? What I wa=
s asking you about was if=20

you thought God would send back my Adoniah Phillips. He----Why, Mr. McGowan=
, what's the=20

matter now?"  The minister had risen and was looking oddly at the housekeep=
er.  "What on earth=20

have I said this time?" she implored.  "You say your lover's name was Phill=
ips, Adoniah Phillips?"=20

Miss Pipkin did not reply, but looked at him fixedly.  "Please, don't look =
at me like that, it makes me=20

feel like I've been guilty of something," he said, trying hard to smile.  "=
You sure you ain't sick?"  "Of=20



course, I'm not ill. I'm slightly interested in that peculiar name. I've he=
ard it just once before, and=20

I'm wondering if there is a chance of its being the same man."  "You've hea=
rd of him?"  "Well, I=20

have heard his name."  "There ain't likely to be another name like his."  "=
Have you any idea where=20

he is at present? You said a bit ago that you did not think he had been dro=
wned at sea."  "No," she=20

answered curtly.  "Can you so much as guess?"  "I don't know if he's living=
 at all, so of course I=20

ain't got no idea where he is," was her snappy reply. "Has he been telling =
you about me and him?"=20

she asked, nodding toward the up-stairs where the Captain was presumably as=
leep.  "He hasn't=20

said anything to me, but----"  "You'll promise not to repeat one word to hi=
m of what I just told you?"=20

she begged, again jerking her head toward the stair.  "I promise to say not=
hing about what you=20

have told me. But I have my reasons for wanting to know something about thi=
s man Phillips."=20

"What are your reasons?"  "I should not have said reasons, for I guess it i=
s nothing but my=20

curiosity that prompts me to ask. If you could tell me more of the facts I =
might be able to help you=20

locate him."  "You mean you have an idea that he is still living?"  "I can'=
t say as to that, but if you'll=20

only help me I am certain that we shall find out something interesting."  M=
iss Pipkin drew the=20

corner of her apron across the corner of her eyes, disappointment written d=
eeply in every line and=20

wrinkle of her face.  "There ain't much more to tell. Adoniah went to sea. =
I got a letter from him=20

once from Australia. I wrote back saying I'd take back what I'd said. He an=
swered it, but didn't say=20

nothing about what I said to him. He spoke of meeting up with some one he k=
new, saying they=20

was going in business together. I ain't never told anybody about that, not =
even Josiah, and I ain't=20

going to tell you, for I don't think he was square with Adoniah, but I can'=
t prove it."  The thud of=20

heavy boots on the rear stair checked further comment she seemed inclined t=
o make, and she=20

dried out the tears that stood in her eyes with short quick dabs as she hur=
ried to the kitchen.  "Lan'=20

of mercy!" she exclaimed, returning with a smoking waffle-iron. "I clean fo=
rgot these, and they're=20

burned to ashes. Here, don't you drink that cold coffee, I'll heat it up ag=
ain," she said, taking the=20

cup. Leaning closely to his ear, she whispered, "Mind, you ain't to tell a =
living soul about what I=20

said, and him above all others."  The minister nodded.  Miss Pipkin entered=
 the kitchen just as the=20

Captain opened the stair-door. He sniffed the air as he greeted the two wit=
h a hearty "Good=20

morning."  "Purty nigh never woke up. You'd otter have come up and tumbled =
me out, Mack."=20

"Rest well, did you?"  "Just tolerable. Clemmie," he called, "I seem to sme=
ll something burning.=20

There ain't nothing, be there?"  "We was busy talking, and them irons got t=
oo hot."  "Talking, be=20

you? Don't 'pear to have agreed with neither of you more than it did with t=
hose irons."  "You=20


_
fancies--she even spoke confidentially of ogres who tried to make themselve=
s friendly, and she=20

asked Arthur, with a very puzzled, anxious face, if a little girl, who was =
so unfortunate as to have=20

an ogre for a friend, could ever get rid of him.  "Oh, yes; he might turn i=
nto an enemy," answered=20

Arthur.  But here poor Daisy shuddered violently, and turned very white.  "=
No, no," she said; "not=20

into an enemy, never into an enemy, dear Mr. Arthur."  "What matter is it t=
o you, little maid?"=20

answered Arthur cheerily, though he regarded her with very keen observation=
. "There is no ogre=20

going to trouble you as either friend or enemy; If he does he will have to =
meet me. I am the Prince,=20

you know, and my mission in life is to slay the wicked ogres."  "Oh! but hi=
s poor wife and his=20

children!" half sobbed Daisy; "couldn't you lock him up in a tower, dear Pr=
ince?"  Arthur smiled,=20

and gradually managed to lead the child's thoughts into another direction. =
He was already gaining=20

the greatest possible influence over her, and he managed, on the occasion o=
f his second visit, to=20

coax her to let him carry her across to Miss Egerton's for a couple of hour=
s. Dove met them as=20

Arthur was carrying the child away, and he first scowled, and then smiled o=
bsequiously. Daisy=20

turned deadly white, and Noel felt that she trembled.  [Illustration: DOVE =
MET THEM. Palace B]=20

"I'm coming back to-night, Mr. Dove," she called out, in a shaky little voi=
ce; and Dove answered--=20

"Pleased to hear it, missy; the attics would be lonesome without you, missy=
."  "Daisy," whispered=20

Noel, "tell me something--is Dove the ogre?"  "Oh, don't, don't, Mr. Prince=
!" answered back the=20

child. "No, no, of course not; why, he's only poor Mr. Dove--a friend of mi=
ne."  When Daisy=20

reached Miss Egerton's and found herself seated in that lady's cosy little =
drawing-room, with=20

sponge-cakes _ad libitum_ to eat, and Noel sitting by and willing to give u=
p all his time to her=20

benefit, she cheered up wonderfully; a faint color came to her white little=
 cheeks, and Miss=20

Egerton, as she passed the open drawing-room door, heard one or two silvery=
 peals of laughter=20

coming from her lips.  "Bless the child!" thought the kind woman; "how much=
 better she is when=20

she is out of that house. What nice influence that good fellow, Arthur, has=
 over her. I do trust the=20

silly little one will soon give up her fancies--for they surely can be noth=
ing but fancies--and come to=20

live with me."  But when the twilight fell Daisy ceased to laugh, the anxio=
us and troubled look=20

returned to her face, and after a time she said to Arthur, in her pretty co=
axing way--  "Take me=20

home now, please, Mr. Prince."  Two days afterwards Noel called at the girl=
s' lodgings Daisy alone=20

was in, but to all his entreaties she now turned a deaf ear. No, she did no=
t want to go out; she=20

would rather stay in her own dear, nice old attics; she was never so happy =
anywhere as in her own=20

attics. She was very fond of Miss Egerton, but she did not think she would =
like to live with her.=20

Miss Egerton kept a bird, and Daisy had a great dislike to birds.  "Please,=
 Mr. Prince," she said, in=20

conclusion, "stay with me here for an hour or two, and tell me a beautiful =
story."  Noel was rather=20

clever at making up impromptu stories, and he now proceeded to relate a tal=
e with a moral.=20

"There was a kind lady who had prepared lovely guest-chambers--beautiful th=
ey were, and worthy=20

of a palace."  Here Noel stopped, and looked hard at his little listener.  =
"Do you know why they=20

were so lovely, little maid?"  "No; please tell me, Mr. Prince. Oh, I am su=
re this is going to be a real=20

true fairy tale--how delicious!" and Daisy leaned back on her sofa with a s=
igh of content.  "The=20

rooms were beautiful, Daisy," continued Arthur "because the walls were pape=
red with Goodness=20

and the chairs, and the tables, and the carpets, and the sofas, and the tho=
usand-and-one little=20

knick-knacks, were placed in the rooms by Self-Denial, and the windows were=
 polished very=20

brightly by Love herself, and she kept the key which opened the chamber doo=
rs."  "How sweet!"=20



said Daisy.  "Yes; there were two rooms, and they were very sweet. To live =
there meant to get into=20

an abode of peace. As to ogres, they would fall down dead on the threshold =
of such rooms. There=20

were only two, and they were up high in a small house, and without the gild=
ing and the glory which=20

I spoke of they would have seemed humble enough, but to those who knew thei=
r secret, and what=20

their owner had done for her expected guests, they appeared a very Palace B=
eautiful. Now, Daisy,=20

I must tell you something so sad. The rooms were ready, but the guests did =
not arrive. Three=20

guests were expected, but the kind lady who had prepared the rooms, who had=
 papered them with=20

Goodness, and furnished them with Self-Denial, and brightened them with Lov=
e, waited and=20

longed for her visitors in vain.  "Two of the visitors were most anxious to=
 come, but one--a little=20

one--although she looked very gentle and had a sweet expression and blue ey=
es, and seemed=20

quite the sort of little girl who would not willingly hurt a fly, held back=
. It never entered into her head=20

that she was selfish, and was making two or three people who loved her both=
 anxious and=20

unhappy. She preferred to live in rooms which, by comparison, were like dun=
geons; for the owners=20

had never put Love into them, and had never thought of Self-Denial in conne=
ction with them.=20

There, Daisy-flower, I have done. It seems a pity that the little girl shou=
ld have been so selfish,=20

does it not?"  "But how does the story end, Mr. Arthur? You have really onl=
y just begun."  "I only=20

know the beginning, Daisy," said Noel, as he rose to leave. "I have not an =
idea whether that=20

Palace Beautiful will ever receive its visitors, whether that kind lady wil=
l ever be made happy, or=20

whether that little girl will ever cease to be selfish."  A few moments aft=
erwards Noel went away,=20

and poor Daisy turned her face to the wall and wept.  Of course, the very o=
bvious moral had hit=20

her hard, poor little maid! Oh! if she could really only confide in Arthur-=
-he was so nice and strong,=20

and he looked so contemptuously at Mr. Dove that day when he was carrying D=
aisy across the=20

road to Miss Egerton's.  "I don't believe he would be afraid of Mr. Dove," =
she whispered softly,=20

under her breath. "Oh dear! why am I so terribly frightened? Why does he ma=
ke my heart beat?=20

and why do I shake so when I see him? Well, I'll never tell about his bring=
ing me up the sticky=20

sweetmeats--of course I'll not tell. I promised I wouldn't; it would be dre=
adful to break one's=20

promise. Of course I know where people go who break their promises. No, I p=
romised Mr. Dove,=20

and I must always, and always, and always keep my word; but I did not promi=
se him that I'd stay=20

here. He wanted me to, and I just had it on the tip of my tongue, for I was=
 dreadfully frightened, but=20

he heard a noise, and he went away. I'm so glad I didn't promise, because t=
he Prince says I=20

should go and live in the Palace Beautiful. He thinks I'm a selfish little =
girl. Oh dear! how terrified I=20

shall be, but I won't be a selfish little girl, and keep Primrose and Jasmi=
ne away from the Palace,=20

and break the kind lady's heart. I must try and write a very private little=
 note to Mr. Dove, and tell=20

him that though I am going away I'll always and always keep my word about t=
he sweeties, and I'll=20

always be his truest of friends, although I do fear him more than anything =
in the world."  Here=20

Primrose came in, and poor little Daisy roused herself, and tried to talk c=
heerfully.  "Primrose," she=20

said, "do you mind my writing a letter which nobody is to see?"  Primrose l=
aughed.  "You funny=20

pet!" she said; "if no one is to see the letter why do you trouble to write=
 it?"  "I only mean,=20

Primrose," continued Daisy, "that you are not to see it, nor Jasmine, nor M=
iss Egerton, nor Mr.=20

Noel. It is to--to somebody; but you are not to be curious, Primrose, nor t=
o ask any questions. It's a=20

most terribly important letter, and when it's written I'm going to put it i=
n the post myself. I'll go out=20

with you, and you must turn your back when I drop it into the pillar-box. Y=
ou'll be very happy when=20



it's written, Primrose, and I'm doing it for you and Jasmine, and because I=
 won't be a selfish little=20

girl."  Primrose stooped down and kissed Daisy.  "You may write your letter=
 and post it," she said,=20

"and I'll try not to be the least bit curious, Eyebright. Now sit down and =
write away, you have a nice=20

quiet hour before Jasmine comes in to tea."  "So I have," answered Daisy; "=
thank you, Primrose.=20

Please don't say anything to me when I'm writing."  Then Daisy in her corne=
r blotted her fingers,=20

and brought a deep flush to her little pale face, and ruined several sheets=
 of note-paper, all of=20

which she carefully tore up to the smallest fragments. At last an epistle, =
over which she sighed and=20

trembled, and even dropped tears, was finished. crowing so loud, Josiah."  =
"No, that's a fact I=20

didn't. You see, Eadie busted mine during that cleaning raid, and I can't a=
fford a new one."  "You=20

must have hit your funny-bone, or something," hinted Miss Pipkin as she pou=
red a cup of the=20

reheated coffee.  "Now, don't get mad, Clemmie. I was just fooling. Mack un=
derstands me purty=20

well, and he'll tell you that I didn't mean nothing by what I said."  "Josi=
ah Pott! You're that=20

disrespectful that I've a good mind to scold you."  "What's up now, Clemmie=
?"  "The very idea! You=20

calling the minister by his first name."  "I've done it ever since I knowed=
 him, and he wouldn't like=20

me to change now. Hey, Mr. McGowan?"  "Call me by my first name, Cap'n. Too=
 much dignity=20

doesn't sit well on your shoulders. You needn't mind, Miss Pipkin, for that=
 is a habit that was=20

formed before I became a minister, and there is no disrespect, I assure you=
."  "You mean you two=20

knowed each other before you come here?"  "You see, Mack come to me one sum=
mer when I was=20

starting on a cruise, and he was such a good sailor that we spent four seas=
ons together after that."=20

"You never told me that," said Miss Pipkin.  "I didn't think to, Clemmie. M=
ack, have some more of=20

these waffles. They're mighty tasty. It takes Clemmie to cook 'em to a turn=
."  "Just listen to that!"=20

rejoined the housekeeper. "He ain't had none yet."  The minister did the un=
heard-of thing: he=20

refused the offer of waffles!  "Mack, you ain't going to let them hypocrite=
s and wolves in sheep's=20

clothing come right up and steal your appetite out of your mouth, be you?" =
 Mr. McGowan assured=20

him that he had no such intention.  "You don't know what you're missing," d=
eclared the Captain,=20

smacking his lips to make the waffles appear more appetizing. "Have just on=
e. Maybe your=20

appetite is one of them coming kind, and I'll swan if 'tis that one taste o=
f these would bring it with a=20

gallop."  "Don't urge him if he don't want 'em, Josiah."  "Cal'late your ta=
lking must have gone to his=20

stomach, hey, Clemmie?"  "Josiah!" she exclaimed, coloring. "He'll soon for=
get all I said to him."=20

"You sartin give it to 'em good last night, Mack. It was the best I ever he=
ard. Got most of 'em=20

where they lived, and you took 'em out into the deep beyond their wading-li=
ne, too. How about=20

you, Clemmie?"  Miss Pipkin had important business in the kitchen.  "Yes, M=
ack, that sure was a=20

ringer," continued the Captain as he helped himself to another layer of waf=
fles. "Wonder if=20

Clemmie took what you said about launching out as literal?"  Miss Pipkin re=
turned with a plate of=20

smoking waffles and placed them at the Captain's side.  "Thanks, Clemmie. I=
 was 'feared you'd be=20

setting out to sea in my dory after hearing that sermon last night," he sai=
d banteringly, with a=20

twinkle in his eyes. "You'd best explain that your meaning was figur'tive, =
Mack. I looked up that=20

word once and it means----"  "Josiah Pott! How can you be so cruel!"  With =
a sob that rose from=20

the depths, Miss Pipkin fled, slamming the kitchen door after her.  "I'll s=
wear, if she ain't crying!"=20

exclaimed the surprised seaman. "What in tarnation do you suppose is up, Ma=
ck? You don't=20

cal'late she thought I was relating to her for earnest, do you?"  He rose a=
nd started toward the=20

door. Mr. McGowan laid a hand on his friend's sleeve.  "You'd better leave =
her alone."  "But I never=20



meant nothing. She'd otter know that. I'm going to tell her," he said, pull=
ing away from the minister,=20

and trying the closed door. "Clemmie, be sensible, and come out of there. I=
 didn't mean nothing,=20

honest, I didn't."  But Miss Pipkin did not come out. She did not so much a=
s answer his=20

importunings. When the men were out of the dining-room she went up-stairs, =
not to appear again=20

that day.  It was afternoon when Mr. McGowan hobbled out of his study, ate =
a light lunch, put a=20

few sandwiches in his pocket, and started in the direction of the peninsula=
 road that led to the=20

beach.     CHAPTER X   Mr. McGowan left the highway a little beyond the Fox=
 estate, and=20

followed a crooked, narrow old footpath across-lots. The path dipped and ro=
se with the contour of=20

the land till at last it lost itself in the white level stretch of sandy be=
ach. He walked on and on, so=20

deeply absorbed in his thoughts that he was unmindful of the blistered foot=
. It was only when=20

hunger pains conspired with the irritation of his foot that he dropped on a=
 log. He drew the=20

sandwiches from his pocket, and proceeded to devour them with genuine relis=
h. For hours after he=20

had finished his lunch, he sat with his back to the warming rays of the aft=
ernoon sun, and gazed=20

vacantly across the wide stretches of sand-dunes.  The chill of the evening=
 air roused him at=20

length to the fact that he must be going home. But when he tried to rise, h=
e discovered that his=20

long walk had produced an ill effect on Miss Pipkin's remedy for sprained a=
nkles. He dropped back=20

again on the log, pondering on how he was to retrace his steps. The sun sli=
pped into the misty=20

haze that hung low above the horizon of the autumn sky. The shadows crept s=
lowly up out of the=20

waters and over the landscape. A thin cloud drifted in over the Sound, thro=
ugh which a pale moon=20

pushed a silvery edge. With the gathering darkness there came a deep myster=
y over land and sea=20

which seemed to creep round and envelop him.  Suddenly, the chill of the ev=
ening air was filled=20

with a glowing warmth, as when one senses the presence of a friend. He star=
ed about him. He=20

listened intently. Could it be possible that this sudden change was only a =
mental fancy? He=20

hobbled a short way up the beach, and as he rounded a promontory his weaken=
ed ankle turned=20

on a loose stone. With an exclamation he settled down on the sand.  A figur=
e near the water's=20

edge rose as though startled. She paused, ready for flight. Then with an in=
voluntary cry came=20

toward the man huddled up on the sand.  "O dear, you are hurt!" she cried, =
as he attempted to=20

rise.  "Elizabeth!" He spoke her name without thought of what he did, even =
as she had=20

unknowingly used the word of endearment in her exclamation of surprise and =
concern.  "You=20

should not have walked so far," she said, her tone cordial, but her eyes ho=
lding a smoldering fire.=20

She helped him to a near-by stone, and sat down beside him.  "I somehow fel=
t that you were=20

near."  "You thought--what?"  "No, I did not think it, I just sensed it."  =
"You certainly have a very=20

fertile imagination."  "Yes. It has been both my blessing and curse."  "But=
 how did you come to feel=20

I was about here?"  "I don't know. It does seem strange, doesn't it?" he mu=
sed. "But I was certain--

--"  "Perhaps you were thinking----" She stopped abruptly.  "Of you," he fi=
nished for her. "I was. I=20

was feeling quite lonely, and couldn't help wishing I could talk with you."=
  "I heard to-day that you=20

are thinking of leaving Little River," she suggested, tactfully changing wh=
at she considered a=20

dangerous subject.  "You heard that I intend to leave? Pray, tell----"  "Th=
en you're not going?"=20

"Quite to the contrary, I intend to fight this thing through if it takes a =
whole year."  "I'm so glad!"=20

There was deep relief in her voice. She hesitated before continuing. "I had=
 a terrible quarrel with=20

Father this evening."  "Why did you do that?"  "I was very angry, and left =
him to come out here. It=20

is the first time we have ever really fallen out. I've thought over some of=
 the unkind things I said to=20



him, and I am ashamed. I was about to go back to him when you fell on those=
 stones and hurt=20

yourself."  "You are right, Miss Fox. Go back to him. He will see different=
ly, too, now that he has=20

had time to think it all over."  "That is what worries me. He won't see dif=
ferently, though I know he=20

is in the wrong. I'm afraid we'll quarrel again."  "Then, I should wait. He=
 will come to you in time."=20

"Father will never do that," she said, sorrowfully. "I hurt him more than I=
 had any right." Searching=20

the minister's face under the dim light, she concluded: "Please, Mr. McGowa=
n, don't blame Father=20

too severely for what happened last night! He is not himself."  "Miss--Eliz=
abeth! Did you quarrel=20

with your father about me?" His heart gave a bound into his throat.  She no=
dded, looking for the=20

world like a child grown tall. Her eyes did not waver as they met the hungr=
y look in his own.=20

"About me?" he repeated incredulously.  "Yes."  A wild passion swept throug=
h him as he listened=20

to the quiet affirmative.  "It began about you and the Athletic Club. Fathe=
r does not understand=20

about your work among the boys. It ended about you and the action of the ch=
urch last night."  "But=20

that action was not voted through."  "I know. But the end is not yet."  "Do=
 you think that my=20

relations with the Boys' Club is all that was behind the abortive action la=
st night?"  "I----"  "Would=20

you advise me to give that work up for a while till all this blows over?"  =
"No, indeed!" she declared=20

strongly. "I think----Well, he says=20


_
"MY DEAR FRIEND, MR. DOVE,--I always and always will be most true to you. I=
 would not be=20

such a wicked little girl as to break my word for anything I'm going always=
 to keep it, and tortures,=20

even the Inquisition, and even the rack, wouldn't get it out of me. Did you=
 ever hear of the rack,=20

Mr. Dove? but perhaps you had better not know. Yes, I'll always keep my wor=
d, the word that I=20

promised, and no one shall ever know about you and me and the sticky sweetm=
eats; but I won't=20

keep the word that I didn't promise. You remember how you wanted me to give=
 you another word=20

that I'd always stay here, and keep Primrose and Jasmine here, instead of l=
etting them go and=20

going with them to the Palace Beautiful. I almost promised you, for you loo=
ked so fierce, and your=20

eyes were so bloodshot, and cruel, and terrible, and I'd great work to keep=
 remembering that you=20

were really my friend; but I'm so glad I did not give you that word too, fo=
r now I know that I'd have=20

done very wrong. A Prince has come to me, Mr. Dove, and told me I am very s=
elfish to try to keep=20

my sisters out of the Palace Beautiful. He says the walls are covered with =
Goodness and the=20

furniture is put there by Self-Denial, and the windows are shining because =
Love has polished them=20

up. He says there's no Love and no Goodness here, and he calls your rooms d=
ungeons. He's a=20

very, very strong Prince, and he kills ogres--he even kills ogres who are f=
riends to little girls.=20

Please, Mr. Dove, this is to say that I'm going away to the Palace Beautifu=
l, and that I'll always=20

keep my word about the sweeties.       "Your true little friend,      DAISY=
."  Then Daisy fastened her=20

letter, and directed it to Mr. Dove, No. 10, Eden Street, and she asked Pri=
mrose for a stamp, and=20

then she and her eldest sister went out, and Primrose turned her back while=
 Daisy dropped the=20

letter into the nearest are not orthodox. Do you need to preach like that?"=
  "If my theology is of=20

poor quality, I can't help it. I can preach only what is truth and reality =
to me."  "But couldn't you be=20

more careful how you do it? Couldn't you be less frank, or something? Shoul=
d you antagonize=20

your people so?"  "I'm sorry if I have really antagonized any one by what I=
 say. Do you find=20

anything unorthodox in my sermons?"  "That isn't a fair question to ask me.=
 I'm not familiar with=20

such things. I thought you might preach less openly what you believe so str=
enuously. Coat the pills=20

so they'll go down with the taste of orthodoxy." She smiled faintly. "I hat=
e to see you putting=20

weapons in their hands."  "And do you honestly think I'd be dealing fair wi=
th myself or with those to=20

whom I preach to sugar-coat my thoughts with something that looks like pois=
on to me?"  She did=20

not reply, but with a quick look she flashed from her wonderful eyes a mess=
age he could not fail to=20

catch even in the semi-darkness. She dropped her hand lightly on his sleeve=
, and his fingers=20

quickly closed over hers. She drew nearer. He could feel the straying wisps=
 of fair hair against his=20

hot cheek. His emotions taxed all his powers of self-control.  "We must be =
going," she said, rising.=20

"Oh, I forgot your foot! You must wait here till I send the trap for you al=
ong the beach."  "Don't do=20

that. I'll get on very well, if you'll help me a little."  "Please, wait ti=
ll I send Debbs. You'll hurt=20

yourself."  "Your father might object to my riding in his carriage," he rem=
arked, with a light laugh.=20

"Mr. McGowan, you must not talk like that. I know you don't like him, but h=
e is really the best father=20

in all the world!"  "Forgive me, Miss Fox. I didn't mean to be rude. I'm af=
raid I was just trying to be=20

funny. As a matter of fact, I do like your father, but there has been no op=
portunity----"=20


_
The moment this was done the child gave a little skip, and caught Primrose'=
s hand, and squeezed=20

it hard, and said, in an excited voice--  "Now I've done it! I'm not going =
to be the selfish little girl=20

who breaks people's hearts. Primrose, darling let us hurry back to the dung=
eons, and put all our=20

things together, so that we may reach the Palace Beautiful to-night."  Poor=
 Primrose, who was not=20

in Daisy's secret, and knew nothing of Arthur Noel's allegory, was consciou=
s of a momentary wild=20

fear that her little sister had taken leave of her senses; but she soon beg=
an to see meaning in=20

Daisy's words, and was only too glad to yield to the child's caprice at onc=
e.  That very night,=20

therefore, Miss Egerton's nice rooms were occupied, and that good lady laid=
 her head on her own=20

pillow with a light and thankful heart.  Fortunately for Daisy, Dove was ou=
t while the packing was=20

going on, and only Mrs. Dove, with a very black scowl on her face, saw the =
girls drive away in a=20

four-wheeler. She refused to say good-bye to them, and was heard to mutter =
that the "ongratitude=20

of some folks was past enduring."  "Here, Dove," she said, when late that n=
ight her lord and=20

master came in, "those pretty young ladies as you thought so much of--'the =
attics' I called them,=20

and always will call them--well, they're gone. They had a four-wheeler, and=
 off they've gone, bag=20

and baggage. For my part I ain't sorry, for now that them attics are painte=
d up and cleaned, which=20

they did out of their own money, I may be able to rise my rent. Those young=
 ladies and I couldn't=20

have kept together much longer. Disobliging, I call  "Have you tried very h=
ard to find an=20

opportunity? You've stayed away from our house pretty consistently, and hav=
e not asked him one=20

thing about the church work."  "I stayed away because I was requested to." =
 "That was only for the=20

time he was ill."  "I'd be glad----"  "Why will you grown men act like chil=
dren sometimes?"  "Miss=20

Fox, please be seated again," requested the minister, a note of authority i=
n his voice. "I have=20

something important to say to you, and the time may not come again."  The g=
irl obeyed, taking her=20

place close beside him on the stone.  "I see you do not understand what has=
 brought this trouble=20

between your father and me. Neither do I, but I don't think that it's a mat=
ter of doctrine. Nor do I=20

believe that it's the work I've been doing down at the Inn with the boys. S=
ome cause strikes deeper=20

than both. They are merely excuses. You remember that he made no objection =
to me in the=20

beginning along these lines, and I preached no less strenuously then, as yo=
u call it, than I do now.=20

In fact, had it not been for your father I doubt very much if the installat=
ion had gone through last=20

summer. Behind the scenes there is another man, and he is pulling the strin=
gs while he directs the=20

play. When I was ordained to the ministry in the New York Presbytery, that =
man fought me=20

desperately, while he raised no objections to others who were ordained at t=
he same time, and who=20

held views far more radical than mine. That man was at the installation. Wh=
en your father told me=20

that he was coming, I made no protest, for I saw that there was a fast frie=
ndship between the two.=20

You know what that=20


_
it was only this morning I asked Miss Mainwaring for the loan of seven and =
sixpence, and she up=20

and said, 'I'm sorry I can't oblige you, Mrs. Dove.' Those kind of young la=
dies don't suit me, and I'm=20

thankful they're gone. Why, Dove, how you do stare!--there's a letter waiti=
ng for you on the table."=20

Dove took up his letter and read it carefully once or twice; after his seco=
nd reading he put it into=20

his pocket, and turned to his wife--  "They've gone round to Miss Egerton's=
; isn't that so, my love?"=20

"Who do you mean by 'they,' Dove?"  "The three young ladies, of course."  "=
Oh, I suppose so; but I=20

neither know nor care--I wash my hands of them from this day forward!"  "We=
ll, then, look here,=20

Mrs. Dove, my love," said the husband, "I _don't_ wash my hands of them--no=
, not by no means.=20

It's all right if they're gone to Miss Egerton's--there are trap-doors in t=
he roof at Miss man tried to=20

do at the installation. You doubtless know, too, that he has been much with=
 your father of late. You=20

also saw him at the meeting last night.  "Miss Fox, if we knew all the fact=
s, we should be able to=20

lay the blame for this trouble and your father's condition right where it b=
elongs."  "You refer to Mr.=20

Means?"  "I do. What it is----"  "Mr. McGowan, if you think any man can inf=
luence my father, you=20

do not know him. I dislike Mr. Means, maybe because he is so preachy. But h=
e cannot influence=20

Father."  "I wish I could believe that!"  "You must believe it. You are let=
ting your imagination color=20

your judgment."  "I should like to believe anything you tell me, but I can'=
t believe anything else=20

than that Mr. Means stands behind this whole mess. Just why, I don't know, =
but it looks very much=20

as though there is a skeleton concealed in his closet, and he's afraid that=
 I'm=20


_
the roof, and quarter-day is coming on, Mrs. Dove, my only love!"  "Law, Do=
ve! you have a most=20

startling way of saying them poetic lines," answered his wife.     CHAPTER =
XXXI.  A "CONTINUAL=20

READER."   A few days after the girls were comfortably settled in their new=
 quarters Primrose=20

went out. She went out all alone, for by this time London streets and Londo=
n ways were familiar to=20

her. Neatly and very quietly dressed, with the usual serene light on her sw=
eet face, and that dignity=20

about her whole bearing which prevented any one from ever being rude to her=
, she went, not to=20

her china-painting as usual, but simply to take exercise in the London stre=
ets.  The fact was,=20

Primrose wanted to be alone--she wanted out."  "Why did you say that?"  "I =
don't know. I can't see=20

what connection I could possibly have with the man."  "You are talking nons=
ense!"  "Perhaps, but=20

truth sometimes masquerades in the garb of the court fool."  "Just what do =
you mean?"  "I wish to=20

heaven I knew!"  "Do you think----" She paused. She searched his face, whic=
h was dimly and=20

fitfully lighted by the moonbeams as they broke through the phantom-like cl=
ouds that were=20

beginning to sweep the heavens. "Tell me, please, just what it is you are t=
hinking."  "I dare not. But=20

there is some reason not yet come to light, and it is sheltered in the mind=
 of Mr. Means."  "Perhaps=20

he knew you before you entered the ministry?" she half suggested, half=20


_
problem. She was beginning to be perplexed, and even slightly alarmed. Her =
alarm was not=20

caused at present by anything in connection with Daisy, for Daisy seemed al=
most bright and well=20

again; but money matters were not too prosperous with the young housekeeper=
, the life of=20

independence she had hoped to attain for herself and her sisters seemed to =
recede from her view=20

day by day--the china-painting brought in no  "I have no recollection of ev=
en so much as meeting=20

him before coming before the ordaining Presbytery of which he was a member.=
 So far as the=20

history of my life is concerned, he may find out the whole of it, if he so =
wishes. It wouldn't make=20

very interesting reading, though. Miss Fox,"--his voice took on the quality=
 of his earnestness,--"if=20

you have any way of finding out what the actual cause is for the=20

nd more inadequate=20

to Primrose the more her experience in expenses grew, and now something abo=
ut Miss Egerton=20

added to her cares. It seemed to Primrose that Miss Egerton was holding bac=
k something--she=20

had always been frank and open with the girls, but when Primrose asked her =
how much their=20

furniture had cost, and whether she had opened Mr. Danesfield's letter to p=
ay for it the good lady's=20

brow had grown troubled, and she had replied--  "I am busy to-day--I will g=
o fully into the matter=20

church, I shall do all in my power to make amends, providing the fault is m=
ine."  "Why don't you go=20

to him? He might be reasonable, and listen to you."  "Didn't I go to him? D=
idn't I try to find out what=20

I had done till you and the doctor forbid my coming again?"  "I don't mean =
Father. Why don't you=20

go to Mr. Means?"  "Would you, if you were in my position?"  She shook her =
head decidedly. "But I=20

don't like him."  "Perhaps that may be my reason, too."  "But I thought all=
 ministers had to love=20

everybody."  "We might love the man, but not his ways."  "There's no merit =
