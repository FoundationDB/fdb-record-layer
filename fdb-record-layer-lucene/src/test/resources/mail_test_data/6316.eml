QUESTIONS.  1. A final judgment in the Circuit Court was brought by writ of error directly into the

D alone could settle them, but refused to do so. What kind of action could M institute against D? 

11. Smith purchased a horse from Jones, giving him in payment a check on a bank which he

leave all the Scales on, though some take them off, to prevent that trouble at the Table; for the 

Skin of the Salmon. is the fattest part of the Fish, and is liked by most People. Lay your Fish thus 

prepared, into the Pan, where you boil it, and pour in Water, with a sixth part of Vinegar, a little 

Salt, and a stick of Horse-Radish; this should be boiled pretty quick: thus far for boiling fresh 

Salmon. The grand Sauce for it you will see at the end of these Receipts, for preparing the several 

sorts of Fish for the Bisque but if it is served alone, then let the Sauce be as follows. Take a Pint of 

Shrimps, a Pint of Oysters and their Liquor, and half a Pint of pickled Mushrooms; or else take 

Shrimps, and the Bodies of two middling Sea-Crabs, or of a couple of Lobsters, the Tail of the 

Lobsters to be cut in Dice, but use which you have by you. If you have Oysters, stew them a little, 

in their own Liquor, with some Mace, and whole Pepper, then lay by the Oysters, and put 

Mushroom Pickle to the Liquor, and dissolve two Anchovies in it; then melt what quantity of Butter 

you think fit, and mix your prepared Liquor with it, adding a little White Wine, or that may be left 

out. I should take notice, that just before you melt your Butter, put your Oysters, Shrimps, and 

Mushrooms, _&c._ into your prepared Liquor to boil up, and then mix all together. _Note,_ The 

Bodies of the Crabs being well stirred in the Liquor, will thicken it, and render the whole very 

agreeable.    To boil _Turbut, Flounders,_ or _Plaise, Pike,_ or a _Cod's-Head,_ or _Whitings._ 

When your Fish are gutted and well wash'd: put them upon your Fish-Plate; the Jacks or Pikes, 

whether small or great, must have their Tails skewer'd into their Mouths, so that they make a 

round figure, which is the Fashion. Then put your Fish into the Kettle, into as much Water as will 

cover them. Put into this Water, an Onion, with some Cloves stuck in it, some Mace, some whole 

Pepper, a little bunch of sweet Herbs, a stick of Horse-Radish, and half a Lemon. When your 

Liquor boils, add a little Vinegar, or Verjuice; and when your Fish are boiled enough, let them drain 

before the Fire. The Sauce for these, if they are served singly, is that directed for the Salmon, or 

else some melted Butter, Anchovies dissolved in Water, over the Fire, and some Shrimps; or for 

want of them, if you can get any of the small Crabs, such as they sell in _London,_ about eight or 

ten a Penny, and no bigger in their Bodies than to contain the quantity of a Golden-Pippin. Take 

the Inside of the Bodies of these, and thicken your Sauce with them. Or if you have Cray-fish, take 

the Bodies of them, and mix them well with your Sauce, and cut the Tails in small bits, as big as 

Pease. The foregoing way of boiling Fish gives them a relish.    To fry _Soles, Flounders, Plaise, 

Whitings, Smelts,_ and _Gudgeons,_ or such like.  Take a large quantity of Hog's-Seam, or Lard, 

and melt it in a Pan, till it is very hot; then put in your Fish, prepared as follows; but first you may 

fry some Bread, in Lengths, as big as one's Finger, to drain for a Garnish.  As for Soles, skin them, 

and gut them, then flour them well, and toss them into the Pan, turning them once, when you see 



the upper side of a yellow Colour. When they are enough, put them into a Cullendar to drain 

before the Fire.  Flounders are only to be gutted, and the Skins wash'd with Water and Salt, and 

being well dry'd with a Cloth, flour them, and fling them into the Pan, and use them as you did the 

Soles.  The Plaise are to be done in the same manner as the Flounders.  Whitings must be treated 

in the same manner as the former.  Smelts must be only rub'd with a coarse Cloth, and then 

flour'd, and thrown into the Pan.  Gudgeons must be scaled and gutted, well dry'd and flour'd, and 

thrown into the hot Lard: but take care in all these that you have a quick Fire under them, and not 

too many in the Pan at one time.  You have now all your Furniture for your Bisque of Fish; but to 

fry them still crisper, and better, use Sallad-Oil instead of Hogs-Lard; or if you have neither of 

these, you may use good dripping of Beef, or Mutton, but there must be enough of it, and it should 

be as hot as possible, in the Pan, when you throw your Fish in. Serve these with melted Butter, 

and Anchovy Liquor, with Shrimps, or Oysters, if they are single.    To broil _Whitings._  Clean 

your Whitings, with Water and Salt, after they are gutted, and drying them thoroughly, flour them 

well, then lay them on the Grid-Iron, first rubbing it with a little Chalk. As you find them enough on 

one side, turn them, and serve them, if they go to the Table alone, with Butter melted, some 

Anchovy Liquor, and Oyster Sauce; these may make one of your grand Dishes of Fish, but fry'd 

and boiled is enough, because there is never a Dish of this kind, but there are many more at the 

same Treat, which will give

B refusing to bring an action?  16. Brown, as executor of Smith, filed his final account in the 

Orphans' Court of Salem County, and gave notice of settlement. Grey, one of the residuary 

legatees, desired to have the accounting in Chancery. Was this possible? If so, how should he 

proceed and what must he show?  17. In the trial of an action for libel wherein plaintiff claimed 

compensatory damages only, defendant offered in mitigation of damages evidence that the 

publication was made in good faith and with honest belief in its truth. The Court excluded the offer, 

and this ruling was attacked on appeal. Was it correct?  18. Plaintiff, aged nine, who was struck 

and injured by an automobile while crossing a street, brought this Dish have some Spitchcot-Eels. 

_N.B._ I forbear to mention here the manner of dresing Spitchcot-Eels, as they are already set 

down in the first part of this Book.  When you fry Whitings, skewer their Tails in their Mouths; and 

some take off their Skins.    The Grand Dish of Fish, and its Sauce.  When we have prepared 

these things, with regard to the grand Dish we design, then make the following Sauce: _viz._ 

Sauce for a Bisque of Fish.  Take a Pint of Gravey, two or three spoonfuls of Mushroom Katchep, 

and a spoonful or two of Mushroom Pickle; then add about a Gill of White Wine, half an Onion, a 

slice of Lemon with the Peel, two Anchovies shred, some Cloves, and Mace. When these have 

boiled half a quarter of an

negligence. The Court charged that a child of that age could be charged with contributory 

negligence, but that in considering that question it was for the jury to consider whether the plaintiff 

had exercised the caution which would reasonably be expected from one of his years. Was this 

charge correct?  19. A, an owner of a dwelling house, brought an action against B, who had a 

tannery in the next block, alleging and showing on trial that noxious fumes from B's tannery had 

made plaintiff's house untenantable. B moved to nonsuit on the ground that these fumes injured a 

large number of houses, were a public nuisance and the only remedy was by out the Onion, and 

Lemon, and thicken your Liquor, with about three Pounds of Butter, rub'd in a little Flour; then put 

in the Body of a Crab, or Lobster, Shrimps, Oysters, and Mushrooms, and it is ready to pour over 

your Fish: but some rather chuse to serve this Sauce in Basons, lest it be too high for every 

Palate. However, when you have disposed your Fish well in the Dish, garnish with fry'd Bread, 

Horse-Radish scraped, fry'd Parsley, Lemon sliced and pickled, red Beet-Root sliced, and serve it 

up hot. If your Sauce is serv'd in Basons; then take care to have one Bason of plain Butter: but if 

all your Company happens to like the rich Sauce,
