Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of 

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, 

middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and 

donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 

with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring 

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 

2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and 

permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the 

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see 

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.  Information 

about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state 

of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Foundation's 

EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

determination till all his powder and lead was spent, although he refused to lower his colours, the 

English mariners overpowered him and made him their prisoner.  But the English knew a brave 

man when they saw one, and Vauquelin they treated with distinguished honour, inviting him to a 

banquet and toasting him loudly as a hero.  This was the deathblow to the hopes of Lvis.  True, he 



had Montreal still in his hands, but what was Montreal without ammunition and provisions, with the 

enemy clamouring at the very gates?  The Canadian Militia had deserted to their homes, and 

Vaudreuil and De Lvis had to defend the city with only 2000 disheartened troops; while against 

them {230} was ranged a force of 17,000 English. Further resistance was useless, and so on the 

8th of September Vaudreuil surrendered to General Murray, and Canada and all its dependencies 

passed to the British Crown.  Hopeless as the situation had been for a full year past, ever since 

Wolfe had laid down his life at the moment of victory on the Plains of Abraham, there were some 

amongst the French to whom the thought of defeat was unbearable pain.  Invincible in spirit, we 

see emerging through the mist of a century and a half, the courtly, stalwart, chivalrous figure of the 

Chevalier de Lvis.  To be conquered while his right arm could grip the handle of a sword was to 

him unutterable disgrace.  When he heard that his superior, Vaudreuil, had agreed that the French 

troops should lay down their arms and serve no longer during the war, his manly cheek flushed 

and he insisted that the negotiations should be broken off.  "If," he said, "the Marquis de Vaudreuil 

must surrender, let us at least withdraw with the troops to the Island of St. Helen in order to uphold 

there, on our own behalf, the honour of the King's army."  But this step Vaudreuil could not, of 

course, permit, and the Chevalier could only grind his teeth in mortification and prepare to bid the 

Canada he loved an eternal farewell.  Canada was now a British colony, and those members of 

the old French Canadian families who were unwilling to become British subjects followed 

Vaudreuil and Lvis back to France.  With them also went the rascally Bigot and the traitors and 

pilferers who had fattened on the distresses of their country.  Nemesis awaited them!  No sooner 

had {231} they touched French soil than they were seized and flung into the Bastille.  At first the 

brazen Cadet swore, when he faced his judges, he was innocent, but afterwards he confessed all. 

Bigot too denied his knavery, until the papers signed by himself put him to silence.  His 

punishment was great, but far less than he deserved; he was banished from France for life, his 

property confiscated to the King, and he was made to pay a fine of 1,500,000 francs.  Cadet was 

banished for nine years and fined 6,000,000 francs, while the rest were ordered to be imprisoned 

until their fines were paid, so that many who had betrayed New France languished in the gaols of 

Old France and died within those bare stone walls.  Canada, as you have seen, had now changed 

masters.  But the red-man, so long the friend and ally of the French, standing at the door of his 

wigwam or stealing noiselessly in his war-paint through the forest, was puzzled and angered.  He 

could not understand how it had happened; he could not understand why the flag of the lilies 

should be hauled down from every fort and trading-station, and the flag of the English or the 

"Boston men," as he called them, unfurled.  His mind could not grasp the meek submission of the

Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public pale-faces--the 

farmers and traders--to the chiefs sent out by King George.  "Why do you not," said one of their 

braves, "leave your towns and villages and set up your lodges in the forest?  Then, when the 

English are lulled into security, return and fall upon and slay them?  You can win battles by craft 

and cunning as well as by numbers and cannon."  But although the French Canadians smiled and 

shook {232} their heads at this plan, yet at the western settlements, such as Michilimackinac, 

Detroit, and Presqu'Isle, they did not scruple to tell the Indians that the English would soon drive 

them from their forest homes and hunting-grounds, and thereby to kindle hate in their hearts for 

the new conquerors.  The French

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status

charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not 

uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and Indian 

character far better than the English, who treated them with contemptuous neglect.  The vanity of 

the redskin chiefs was no longer fostered, and the tribes were told plainly that they were regarded 

as vassals and savages.  For the English--the Boston men--could not forget the bloodthirsty 

cruelty which had been practised upon them and their wives and children for so long, and now that 

they felt that all power on the continent was in the hollow of their hands, they would not stoop to 

truckle to its aboriginal masters.  At first the haughty redskin
