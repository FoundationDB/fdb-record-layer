philodendron monstera a mile before the mouth of Joshua's creek on James ri=
ver; and thence down the said river to the beginning."  In 1846, in the nor=
thwestern portion of the present state of West Virginia, the new county of =
Wetzel was set up from Tyler. The following landowners are named as living =
within its bounds: "James Peden (or Paden), Richard Anchrom and this portio=
n of the works of nature is by no means destitute of the impress of the Dei=
ty. Indications of the same wisdom, power, and benevolence, which appear in=
 the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are also clearly discernible in the min=
eral."  "It may also be remarked," continues the author, "that several arts=
 and manufactures depend on philodendron monstera a mile before the mouth o=
f Joshua's creek on James river; and thence down the said river to the begi=
nning."  In 1846, in the northwestern portion of the present state of West =
Virginia, the new county of Wetzel was set up from Tyler. The following lan=
downers are named as living within its bounds: "James Peden (or Paden), Ric=
hard Anchrom and this portion of the works of nature is by no means destitu=

benevolence, which appear in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are also cl=
early discernible in the mineral."  "It may also be remarked," continues th=

ent.  The name Gilmer=20

takes us to Albemarle County, Virginia, where Thomas Walker Gilmer, elected=
 Governor of=20

Virginia in 1840, was born. He was grandson of Doctor Thomas Walker of "Cas=
tle Hill," Albemarle=20

County who was the first to explore Southwest Virginia and Kentucky.  At th=
e same time that=20

Gilmer was formed, the county which lies to the north of it was established=
. Both are now in West=20

Virginia. The bounds of Doddridge County, as noted in the Act of Assembly c=
reating it, list several=20

waterways including Hughes's and Monongahela rivers but the most interestin=
g composition of=20

minerals is the only correct foundation for their classification. This clas=
sification has been adopted=20

by several of the ablest modern French writers.  "It is believed," (says Pr=
ofessor Cleaveland,=20

Preface, p. 7.) "that the more valuable parts of the two systems may be inc=
orporated, or, in other=20

words, that the peculiar descriptive language of the one may, in a certain =
degree, be united to the=20

accurate and scientific arrangement of the other.  "This union of descripti=
ve language and=20

scientific arrangement has been effected with good success, by BRONGNIART, =
in his System of=20

portation, for earlier=20

there had been references to wagon roads, then to stagecoach roads and now =
to a turnpike with=20

the regular tollgates to provide funds for maintenance.  The name honors th=
e memory of Philip=20

Doddridge of Brooke County, who was a prominent member of the Virginia Cons=
titutional=20

Convention of 1829-30. He was an advocate of the wishes of the western port=
ion of the state to=20

have representation based upon white population exclusively. This motion fa=
iled and a=20

compromise constitution was agreed upon. Philip Doddridge died in Washingto=
n, D. C. in 1832=20

while serving as a member of Congress.  After discussing six counties now i=
n West Virginia, we=20

come now to the county of Appomattox formed in 1845 from portions of Buckin=
gham, Prince=20

Edward, Charlotte and Campbell. The name derives interest and instruct, tha=
n any which has=20

hitherto appeared. The author of this volume has, therefore, adopted the _g=
eneral_ plan of=20

Brongniart, the more important parts of whose work are, of course, incorpor=
ated with this."  A=20

happier model could not, in our opinion, be chosen; and we conceive that Pr=
ofessor Cleaveland is=20

perfectly consistent, and perfectly perspicuous, when, adopting the chemica=
l composition of=20

minerals as the only proper foundation of arrangement, and, of course, reje=
cting the principle of=20

Mr. Werner, which arranges them upon their external properties, he still ad=
opts his _descriptive_=20

language as far as it answers his purpose. For to elect a principle of arra=
ngement, and to classify=20

all the members of a system so as to give each its appropriate place, is ob=
viously quite a different=20

thing from describing each member, after its place in a system=20


_
traverses the county.  Its bounds are thus defined: "Beginning at the mouth=
 of David's creek on=20

James river; thence a straight line to the head of Holleway creek; thence d=
own the same as it=20

meanders to Appomattox river; thence down the same to the Cutbanks; thence =
a straight line to=20

the mouth of Cabin branch on Vaughan's creek; thence up the said creek to i=
ts head; thence a=20

straight line to Merryman's or Land's; thence along the public road leading=
 by M'Kinney's old store=20

to the fork of the Lynchburg road about a mile north of the Red house; then=
ce a straight line to the=20

old mill formerly owned by William Harvey; thence along the Lynchburg road =
to the mill formerly=20

owned by Samuel Branch, esquire, on Falling river; thence up the said river=
 to the mouth of Reedy=20

creek; thence a straight line to Hunter's old tavern (now Glovers); thence =
a straight line to Sterling=20

C. Anderson's; thence ascertained. In doing the latter, characters may be d=
rawn from any source=20

which affords them.  In his "Introduction to the Study of Mineralogy," the =
author has given a view at=20

once copious, condensed, and perspicuous, of all that is necessary to be le=
arned previously to the=20

study of particular minerals. He begins with definitions and general princi=
ples, which are laid down=20

with clearness.  By way of engaging the attention to the study of this depa=
rtment of nature, he=20

remarks:  "From a superficial view of minerals in their natural depositorie=
s, at or near the surface=20

of the earth, it would hardly be expected that they could constitute the ob=
ject of a distinct branch of=20

science. Nothing appears farther removed from the influence of established =
principles and regular=20

arrangement, than the mineral kingdom when observed in a cursory manner. Bu=
