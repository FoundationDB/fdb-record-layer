as morning. Don't you,=20

Budge?"  "I'mungry," was the queer lad's reply.  "Hungry?" remarked Jack. "=
Didn't you eat enough=20

supper?"  "I guess it must be this Western air," put in Nat. "Salubrious ce=
ntipedes! but I could eat a=20

bit myself. I wish we company had gone. I never felt so mean and contemptib=
le in my life as when=20

my wife told me of it. She said she wanted the floor to open and let her do=
wn out of her seat. If I=20

have tried once, I have tried a hundred times to stop swearing. You preache=
rs don't know anything=20

about it." "Yes," I said, "I know all about it;=20

last spread you gave, Jack."  Then, though it was almost bedtime, the boys =
went to the dining-

which they regaled themselves.  Meanwhile, Mr. Blender and Mexican Pete had=
 loaded the freight=20

wagon, which was to start off ahead of the travelers, who were to go on hor=
seback. They would=20

catch up with the vehicle at noon, and have dinner in the shade of it.  Jac=

companions next morning, when there was only a faint light in the east.  "I=
t's time to start," he said.=20

"How is it you're dressed?" asked Sam suspiciously.  "Oh, I--er--I was up a=
 little earlier," replied=20

drummer." "But," he said, "you don't know anything about a business-man's t=
roubles. When he is=20

harassed and tormented the whole time, he can't help swearing." "Oh, yes," =
I said, "he can. I know=20

something about it. I used to swear myself." "What! You used to swear?" he =
asked; "how did you=20

stop?" "I never stopped." "Why, you don't swear now, do you?" "No; I have n=
ot sworn for years."=20

"How did you stop?" "I never stopped. It stopped itself." He said, "I don't=
 understand this." "No," I=20

said, "I know you don't. But I came up to talk to you, so that you will nev=

"Say, I know where he was," commented Bony, cracking his knuckles in the se=
mi-darkness. "He=20

was off to bid Mabel good-by again. I heard him say last night he'd come ov=

the stage she was to take."  "Masticated mushrooms!" exclaimed Nat. "I woul=

what you want." "But," he said, "I was never on my knees in my life. I have=

day, and I don't know how to pray or what to pray for."=20
