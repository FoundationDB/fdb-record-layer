laden with men and women going to their death and shouting "God save the King" all the way. 

That is not the sort of paltry revenge which would satisfy me. My father was hanged by yours as a 

malefactor--hanged, I say, like a common thief! he, a man who had never wronged a single soul in 

the whole course of his life, who had been an example of fine living, of hard work, of noble 

courage through many adversities. My mother was left a widow--not the honoured widow of an 

honourable man--but a pariah, the relict of a malefactor who had died of the hangman's rope--my 

sister was left an orphan--dishonoured--without hope of gaining the love of a respectable man. All 

that I and my family owe to ci-devant M. le duc de Kernogan, and therefore I tell you, that both he 

and his daughter shall not die like martyrs but like malefactors too--shamed--dishonoured--loathed 

and execrated even by their own kindred! Take note of that, M. le duc de Kernogan! You have 

sown shame, shame shall you reap! and the name of which you are so proud will be dragged in 

the mire until it has become a by-word in the land for all that is despicable and base."  Perhaps at 

no time of his life had Martin-Roget, erstwhile Pierre Adet, spoken with such an intensity of 

passion, even though he was at all times turbulent and a ready prey to his own emotions. But all 

that he had kept hidden in the inmost recesses of his heart, ever since as a young stripling he had 

chafed at the social conditions of his country, now welled forth in that wild harangue. For the first 

time in his life he felt that he was really master of those who had once despised and oppressed 

him. He all the troubles that had befallen and surrounded, and well-nigh overwhelmed them in time 

past.  The Davidson and McKay families had re-established themselves on their farms, rebuilt their 

houses and planted their fields, and splendid crops of all kinds were now flourishing, ready for 

spade and sickle.  The soil was found to be excellent.  In after years, forty-fold was no uncommon 

return.  In one case, for a bushel of barley sown, fifty-six bushels were reaped; and from a bushel 

of seed potatoes were obtained one hundred and forty-five bushels!  Industry, however, had not at 

that time been rewarded with such encouraging results, but there was sufficient to indicate 

cheering prospects in the near future, and to gladden the hearts of the pioneer settlers.  As a good 

number of these had, under the depressing influence of disappointment and failure in the past, 

neglected to sow extensively, not a few families were forced again to winter at Pembina, and draw 

their supplies from the chase to avoid consuming all the seed which alone ensured them against 

famine.  Among these were the Swiss families, most of whom, being watch and clock makers, 

pastry-cooks, mechanics and musicians, were not well adapted for agricultural pursuits.  Perhaps 

they were as ill-adapted for the chase, but seed takes time to sow and grow, whereas animals 

need no prolonged nursing--at least from man--and are quickly killed if one can shoot.  The young 

leader of the Switzers, however, Andre Morel, soon left his party at Pembina under the care of his 

lieutenant, and returned to Red River Settlement, bent on mastering the details of husbandry, so

sense of possession and of power had gone to his head like wine: he was intoxicated with his own 

feeling of triumphant revenge, and this impassioned rhetoric flowed from his mouth like the 

insentient babble of a drunken man.  The duc de Kernogan, sitting on profitable occupation than 

the chase.  For this purpose, he sought and obtained employment with the Davidsons in the new 

and enlarged edition of Prairie Cottage.  His sister, Elise, was engaged by old McKay to act as 

companion and assistant to his daughter

his knees and his head buried in his hands, had no thought of breaking in on the other man's 

ravings. The bitterness of remorse paralysed his thinking faculties. Martin-Roget's savage words 

struck upon his senses like blows from a sledge-hammer. He knew that nothing but his own folly 

was the cause of Yvonne's and his own misfortune. Yvonne had been safe from all evil Elise, 

proved to be invaluable acquisitions in the households in which they had found a home, for both 

were lively, intelligent companions, hard workers at whatever they undertook, and were possessed 

of sweet melodious voices.  Andre also performed on the violin, an instrument which has played a 

prominent part in the wild Nor'-West ever since the white-man set down
