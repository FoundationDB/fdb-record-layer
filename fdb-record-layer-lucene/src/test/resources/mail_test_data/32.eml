mistake; we have heard nothing of this," he said. "I am sure Carry--would be averse to any fuss. It 

was such a thing for her that there was no coroner's inquest. I made sure we were all safe. You 

must be mistaken," he said.  "Lord Rintoul," said Nora, who was given to opposition, "though there 

is no coroner's inquest, there must be justice; and if they think Mr Erskine has anything to do with

her hand over Nora to grasp his, but this gesture seemed to drive him back into himself. He 

withdrew a little from the side of the pony-carriage, and made a pretence of not seeing the old 

lady's outstretched hand. Miss Barbara was shocked, and gave him a curious look; but she was

Lord Rintoul? Bring me word, not here, but to my house. I am going home."  He gave a little bow 

of assent, and stood on the pavement looking after them as they drove away. He stood longer 

than was necessary for that, till they had disappeared round the corner of the High Street, till the 

children about--of whom there was always a large supply in Dunearn--began to gape at him with

small pebble tumbled along the flags where he stood--a harmless experiment to see if there was 

any fun in him. He

as if the operation was difficult, and went on to the Town-house. When he got there, he went in 

reluctantly, with evident disinclination. The attendant who had talked to Rolls made way for him 

respectfully. The other people about opened the doors and took off their hats to the young 

potentate. A small case which was going on at the time was even suspended while the sheriff, not 

nearly so great a man, answered his lordship's questions in his own person. "Yes, there has been
