little or nothing:--they affect great decency of manners and a religious de=
portment in all their=20

actions; but any thing but this is to be found in the conduct of the genera=
lity; and a common=20

remark amongst themselves, "Esta no es tierra para un hombre de bien," [137=
] is worth a chapter=20

on the subject.  This may be thought an exaggerated, or at least a highly c=
oloured picture, and it is=20

natural that it should be so. A recital of a well-known custom may add an e=
vidence to these=20

assertions, premising that it is not the only, though the most prominent on=

earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. But as already seen, the electrical phe=
nomena of volcanic=20

eruptions are fairly considered an effect, and not a cause, of the eruption=
s, as the hydro-electric=20

machine illustrates. In the theory of these men, the molten veins of the in=

conductors which are too small or imperfect to allow the electricity to pas=

large veins of coal exist, because large masses of carbon would be necessar=

electric tension in the interior. Herr Steffens must account for the fact t=
hat the great coal regions of=20
