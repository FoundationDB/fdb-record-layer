young in years.  Both of the girls were terrified, and would have fled had he not detained them. 

"Ha, ha!" he said, stepping in front of them, "do not be frightened; don't go, ladies. That's only the 

way I express my amusement at anything."  "Then, for mercy's sake, don't get amused again," 

said Alice, deprecatingly. "Why, dear me, I thought the Old Nick and all his couriers had pounced 

down upon us."  "Well, how do you know but what he has? _I_ may be his Satanic majesty, or one 

of his envoys."  "I hardly think so; you are too much an earthly being for that. Come, now, take off 

that detestable mask and let me see what you look like."  "No, indeed! I would not remove this 

mask, except on conditions, for all the gold yon toiling miners are finding, which, I am satisfied, is 

no small amount."  "You spoke of conditions. What are they?"  "Some time, perhaps, I will tell you, 

lady, but not now. See! my men are signaling to me, and I must go. Adieu, ladies;" and in another 

CHAPTER XIII  BUILDING UP A MAGAZINE  Edward Bok has often been referred to as the one 

"who made _The Ladies' Home Journal_ out of nothing," who "built it from the ground up," or, in 

similar terms, implying that when he became its editor in 1889 the magazine was practically non-

existent.  This is far from the fact.  The magazine was begun in 1883, and had been edited by Mrs. 

Cyrus H. K. Curtis, for six years, under her maiden name of Louisa Knapp, before Bok undertook 

its editorship.  Mrs. Curtis had laid a solid foundation of principle and policy for the magazine: it 

had achieved a circulation of 440,000 copies a month when she transferred the editorship, and it 

had already acquired such a standing in the periodical world as to attract the advertisements of 

Charles Scribner's Sons, which Mr. Doubleday, and later Bok himself, gave to the Philadelphia 

magazine--advertising which was never given lightly, or without the most careful investigation of 

the worth of the

In their concealment the two Filmores witnessed this meeting between Dick and the two girls.  "So 

there are females here, eh?" grunted the elder, musingly. "From observation I should say that 

Prince Dick was a comparative stranger here."  "That is my opinion," groaned Clarence, his 

thoughts reverting to his empty stomach. "Did you hear that laugh a moment ago? It was more like 

the screech of a lunatic than anything else."  "Yes; he is a young tiger. There is no doubt of that to 

my mind."  "And we shall have to keep on the alert to take him. He came to the cabin last 

periodical.  What every magazine publisher knows as the most troublous years in the 

establishment of a periodical, the first half-dozen years of its existence, had already been 

weathered by the editor and publisher.  The wife as editor and the husband as publisher had 

combined to lay a solid basis upon which Bok had only to build: his task was simply to rear a 

structure upon the foundation already laid.  It is to the vision and to the genius of the first editor of 

_The Ladies' Home Journal_ that the unprecedented success of the magazine is primarily due.  It
