It would be to leave the first century incomplete and to offer an     insul=
t to the memory of St. John,=20

to pass over in silence the name     of one who had the honour of being his=
 special antagonist, as=20

Simon was that of St. Peter, Elymas that of Paul, etc. In the     first yea=
rs of the Christian era, ...=20

there appeared at Tyana in     Cappadocia one of those extraordinary men of=
 whom the=20

Pythagorean     Elmer, 5 Redf., 181. A disposition to construe the statute =
strictly was disclosed in=20

the opinion of Earl, J., in Edington. _v._ =C3=86tna L. I. Co., 77 N. Y., 5=
64, but his personal views were=20

disapproved in subsequent cases; see Grattan _v._ Metro. L. I. Co., 80 N. Y=
., 281; Renihan _v._=20

initiated in all the secret doctrines of India, Egypt and Chaldaea,     end=
owed, therefore, with all the=20

theurgic powers of the ancient     Magi, he bewildered, each in its turn, a=
ll the countries which he=20

visited, and which all--we are obliged to admit--seem to have     blessed h=
is memory. We could not=20

doubt this fact without     repudiating real historical records. The detail=
s of his life are     transmitted=20

to us by a historian of the fourth century     (Philostratus), himself the =
translator of a diary that=20

recorded     day by day the life of the philosopher, written by Damis, his =
    disciple and intimate=20

friend.(238)   De Mirville admits the possibility of _some_ exaggerations i=
n both recorder and=20

translator; but he "does not believe they hold a very wide space in the nar=
rative." Therefore, he=20

regrets to find the Abbe Freppel "in his eloquent _Essays_,(239) calling th=
e diary of Damis a=20

romance." Why?       [Because] the orator bases his opinion on the perfect =
similitude,     calculated=20

as he imagines, of that legend with the life of the     Saviour. But in stu=
dying the subject more=20

profoundly, he [Abbe     Freppel] can convince himself that neither Apollon=
ius, nor Damis,     nor=20

again Philostratus ever claimed a greater honour than a     likeness to St.=
 John. This programme=20

was in itself sufficiently     fascinating, and the travesty as sufficientl=
y scandalous; for     owing to=20

magic arts Apollonius had succeeded in counterbalancing,     in appearance,=
 several of the=20

miracles at Ephesus [produced by St.     John], etc.(240)   The _anguis in =
herba_ has shown its=20

head. It is the perfect, the wonderful similitude of the life of Apollonius=
 with that of the Saviour that=20

places the Church between Scylla and Charybdis. To deny the life and the "m=
iracles" of the=20

former, would amount to denying the trustworthiness of the same Apostles an=
d patristic writers on=20

whose evidence is built the life of Jesus himself. To father the Adept's be=
neficent deeds, his=20

raisings of the dead, acts of charity, healing powers, etc., on the "old en=
emy" would be rather=20

dangerous at this time. Hence the stratagem to confuse the ideas of those w=
ho rely upon=20

authorities and criticisms. The Church is far more clear-sighted than any o=
f our great historians.=20

The Church _knows_ that to deny the existence of that Adept would lead her =
to denying the=20
