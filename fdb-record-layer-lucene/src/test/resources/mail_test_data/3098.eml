unfortunate if, after meeting so often this evening, we should not succeed =
in meeting to-morrow."=20

"Oh, as to that, sir," replied Chatillon (for it was he who, with Flamarens=
, was leaving the Duc de=20

Beaufort), "you may be assured; for if we meet by night without seeking eac=
h other, much more=20

shall we meet by day when wishing it."  "I hope that is true," said Aramis.=

the Opera Comique it=20

had its comic side.  _Q._ How was that?  _A._ For instance, _les tricoteuse=
s_ were represented=20

by comely,   albeit plump maidens, who seemed more inclined to dance round =

I do; and the=20
