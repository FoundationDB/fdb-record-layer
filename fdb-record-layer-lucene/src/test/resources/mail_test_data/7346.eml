philodendron monstera  Black Bruin sniffed the bars of his cage where the m=

Sometimes he would fall asleep and dream of the old free life, only to wake=
 to the torment of his=20

prison-bars.  There was but one incident during the first year of Black Bru=
in's circus life that is=20

worth mentioning.  The circus was showing in a fair-sized city in Northern =
New York, in St.=20

Lawrence River County.  The day was exceptionally warm, the crowd was unusu=
ally large and the=20

torment of captivity was unusually galling to the wild beasts.  Black Bruin=
 was restless and paced=20

to and fro in his cage, and sniffed its bars more often than usual.  Sudden=
ly from out the babel=20

about him a voice spoke that fell pleasantly on his ear and in the sound wa=
s something that he=20

remembered.  When the voice ceased speaking, some psychological reaction sl=
ipped a slide in=20

the brute mind, the impression of which had been gained many years before, =
and the great bear=20

saw, as plainly as he had seen it then, the farmhouse with the chicken-coop=
s in the front yard, and=20

ducks, geese, turkeys and hens all moving about over the green turf.  There=
 was the barn and the=20

outbuildings and the long low hen-house where he had so often robbed the he=
ns' nests.  Then the=20

scene shifted slightly and the dreamer saw the orchard at the back of the f=
armhouse with its=20

gnarled and twisted trees and the row of little white houses in the shade n=
ear by.  "Hum, hum, zip-

-hum," went the bees flying in from their long quest afield in search of th=
e heart secret of the floral=20

world.  But whether it was the droning of bees or the hum of many voices th=
at he heard Black=20

Bruin could not tell.  At this point in his reverie he looked through his b=
ars at three of the circus-

goers who were evincing peculiar interest in him.  These were a man, a woma=
n, and a boy of=20

about nine years.  "What a fine bear," the man was saying; "much larger tha=
n the old female that I=20

shot on that----"  But the man did not finish the sentence, for noticing th=
e pallor that crept into his=20

wife's face at his words and the shiver that ran through her frame, he desi=
sted.  "Look here,=20

sonny," Venice, the ortolans, the Italian confectionery, the endless bouque=
ts, were worthy of the=20

soft and invisible music that resounded from the pavilion, only varied by t=
he coquettish scream of=20

some macaw, jealous, amid all this novelty and excitement, of not being not=
iced.  =E2=80=9CIt is a scene of=20

enchantment,=E2=80=9D whispered the chief patron of British art to Madame P=
hoebus.  =E2=80=9CI always think=20

luncheon in the air rather jolly,=E2=80=9D said Madame Phoebus.  =E2=80=9CI=
t is perfect romance!=E2=80=9D murmured the=20

chief patron of British art to Euphrosyne.  =E2=80=9CWith a due admixture o=
f reality,=E2=80=9D she said, helping him=20

to an enormous truffle, which she extracted from its napkin. =E2=80=9CYou k=
now you must eat it with butter.=E2=80=9D=20

Lothair was glad to observe that, though in refined society, none were pres=
ent with whom he had=20

any previous acquaintance, for he had an instinctive feeling that if Hugo B=
ohun had been there, or=20

Bertram, or the Duke of Brecon, or any ladies with whom he was familiarly a=
cquainted, he would=20

scarcely have been able to avail himself of the society of Theodora with th=
e perfect freedom which=20

he now enjoyed. They would all have been asking who she was, where she came=
 from, how long=20

Lothair had known her, all those questions, kind and neighborly, which unde=
r such circumstances=20

occur. He was in a distinguished circle, but one different from that in whi=
ch he lived. He sat next to=20

Theodora, and Mr. Phoebus constantly hovered about them, ever doing somethi=
ng very graceful,=20

or saying something very bright. Then he would whisper a word to the great =
Clorinda, who flashed=20

intelligence from her celebrated eyes, and then he made a suggestion to the=
 aesthetical Lady=20

Beatrice, who immediately fell into enthusiasm and eloquence, and took the =
opportunity of=20

displaying her celebrated hands.  The time had now arrived when they were t=
o repair to the studio=20

and view the picture. A curtain was over it, and then a silken rope across =
the chamber, and then=20

some chairs. The subject of the picture was Hero and Leander, chosen by the=
 heir of all the=20



Russias himself, during=20


_
kept Black Bruin until now he would probably have looked just about like th=
is old chap.  What do=20

you think of that?"  "Whew," whistled the boy.  "Ain't he a monster?  Our b=
ear wasn't more than a=20

quarter as big."  "No," replied the man.  "That was because he was not grow=
n, but he was a fine=20

cub when we let the peddler have him.  I have often wondered what became of=
 him."  "Wasn't visit=20

to England.  =E2=80=9CA fascinating subject,=E2=80=9D said old Cecrops to M=
r. Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cbut not a very original one.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThe originality of a subject is in its treatment,=E2=80=9D was the=
 reply.  The theme, in the present instance,=20

was certainly not conventionally treated. When the curtain was withdrawn, t=

had taken of us."  "Come, John, let's look at some of the other animals," s=
aid the boy's mother.=20

"Bar-bar was all right, but it gives me the shivers to look at a full-grown=
 black bear like this."  So=20

the three moved on to the the female form, and yet the painter had so skilf=
ully availed himself of=20

the shadowy and mystic hour, and of some gauze-like drapery, which veiled w=
