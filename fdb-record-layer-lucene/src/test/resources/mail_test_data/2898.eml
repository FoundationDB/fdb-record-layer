rpetuated by occasional recurrence of the shocks during several days. The _
tobacco. Three millions of inhabitants, all without exception of sex or age=
 consumers of that=20

article--and for each one of them, on the average, and at a very low estima=
te, can be set down a=20

consumption of four pesos [worth] a year--would produce an addition to the =
revenue of twelve=20

million pesos, which they would obtain from the land and from their industr=
ies, in order to give at=20

the same time a great impulse to commerce. This is not a paradox, for the u=
se of tobacco is of so=20

prime necessity for the Indians that the same calculation can be made for t=
hat object that would be=20

made for the use of bread in Espaa. [Bernaldez considers the injurious effe=
cts of enforcing this=20

monopoly in only a part of the islands--"although more than half the popula=
tion is today subject to=20

the monopoly, its income is only one-tenth of what, at a reasonable estimat=
e, it ought to be"--and=20

those of its careless and negligent administration. He makes the following =
suggestions:] That the=20

collection of the tributes from the Indians of Filipinas be made compulsory=
 in money, as soon as=20

the colonial money can be placed in circulation in their provinces. That th=
e monopoly of tobacco in=20

Filipinas be extended to all the [now] exempt provinces, without exception;=
 and the government=20

there will succeed much better in establishing it therein by sagacity than =
by authority or force. That=20

the examination and appraisal of the leaf tobacco which the monopoly purcha=
ses from the growers=20

be made before a board which the government there shall appoint annually, c=
omposed of officials=20

from the capital who are most trustworthy and intelligent in that branch of=
 administration, such=20

tobacco as proves to be unfit for use being burned in their presence. That =
all the tobacco which=20

can be collected in Filipinas be conveyed to Espaa, by means of contracts w=
ith private persons for=20

the freighting of ships; and with it the amount which can be remitted from =
the [different] branches=20

of the royal exchequer, and the annual surplus of their funds.    Of the re=
venue from wine  The=20

product of the revenue from wine cannot in Filipinas be considered so impor=
tant as that from=20

tobacco, because the Indians are very moderate in their drinking. The wines=
 made from the=20

cocoanut and nipa (the only ones subject to the monopoly) are wholesome for=
 the Indians; and as=20

the monopoly has regulated the supply for each village, greatly improving t=
he process of making=20

the liquor and diminishing its strength, the Indians prefer the monopoly to=
 the free privilege of this=20

article. The failure of this revenue to increase depends on two causes: fir=
st, that the monopoly is=20

not extended, as it ought to be, to all the provinces of the islands, not o=
nly thus to place all the=20

natives on the same footing, and so suppress the contraband trade, but to p=
revent by this method=20

the manufacture by the Indians of other beverages which are more injurious =
to their health, and=20

which, without giving them pleasure, intoxicate them as has been the case w=
ith the brandy and=20

rum from sugar-cane juice or molasses; second, the great amount of the two =
last-named liquors=20

which is clandestinely furnished to the public, as a result of the permissi=
on, very negligently=20

guarded, which was given to manufacture them freely to export abroad, or to=
 sell them under a=20

certain tax in order that they should not injure the consumption of the art=
icle placed under=20

monopoly control. [Bernaldez admits that the manufacture of the above-menti=
oned brandy and=20

rum ought to unusual alarm shown. A large number of chimneys in Boston were=
 thrown down;=20

clocks were stopped; a new vane was broken from the market house, the spind=
le being snapped=20

at a place where it was five inches thick; but we are not told of any serio=
us loss of life or property.=20

The shock extended southward, and was plainly felt along the east side of t=
he Chesapeake, but=20

not on the western shore. The sea wave set in motion travelled southward, a=
nd it is supposed to=20

have occasioned the unusual commotion of the water in the West Indies. At S=
t. Martin=E2=80=99s the sea=20



suddenly fell five feet below its level, and then rose six above.  The time=
 of the shock was=20

determined exactly by an accident. Prof. Winthrop, of Cambridge, had placed=
 a long glass tube in=20

his tall clock, as a safe place. This tube, thrown against the pendulum, st=
opped the clock, which=20

the day before had been adjusted to meridianal noon; and as Prof. Winthrop =
had compared his=20

watch and clock the night before, he was able to show that the shocks began=
 at eleven minutes=20

and thirty-five seconds after four A.M., November 18, and continued about f=
our and a half minutes.=20

Eighteen periods of earthquakes are noted in the next fifty-five years; and=
 at one of these, in 1791,=20

nearly one hundred and fifty shocks were felt.  [Illustration: OLD STATE HO=
USE, CHARLESTON.]=20

In 1810-11-12, a series of remarkable shocks were felt throughout a large p=
ortion of the United=20

States, but with especial force in the central Mississippi valley. The firs=
t were noticed near St.=20

Genevieve, but the center of violence seemed to lie around New Madrid, Mo. =
The shocks became=20

so sharp and frequent that Dr. Robertson was sent out to observe and record=
 them carefully. He=20

kept count up to five hundred, and then abandoned that portion of the work.=
  The phenomena=20

were much like those of the milder type of earthquakes everywhere. Around N=
ew Madrid huge=20

fissures opening in the earth emitted volumes of sand and gas, occasionally=
 spouting water, or=20

sending out bursts of flame. Some of the fissures were six hundred feet lon=
g and twenty feet wide.=20

The sand and water was sometimes thrown as high as forty or fifty feet. Dur=
ing the whole period=20

there were unusual disturbances in other regions. On the night of the most =
violent shocks occurred=20

the great earthquake at Caracas, Venezuela, which destroyed so many thousan=
ds. Had the=20

Mississippi region been a very thickly settled one, the loss of life would =
have been fearful. Upon=20

the upheaval of a new island, Sabrina, in the Azores, to a height of three =
hundred and twenty feet,=20

and an eruption of the St. Vincent volcano, in the Antilles, the disturbanc=
e ceased. It is not safe to=20

assert positively that there was no connection between these phenomena; but=
 there is little=20

probability that there was. They serve rather to show how universal are the=
 subterranean forces=20

with which man must deal. The year 1811 was also marked by a storm of unusu=
al violence, and by=20

the appearance of a brilliant comet. But, as noticed before, efforts to est=
ablish any especial=20

connection between such phenomena have not met with any marked success.  Th=
ese=20

earthquakes were so violent in the river itself as to almost shatter boats =
in mid-stream. Trees at=20

some distance from the bank were hurled into the water with tremendous forc=
e. Flashes of fire and=20

molten matter were thrown to great heights. The explosions seemed like a ba=
ttery of artillery.=20

Sunken logs and snags were thrown from the deep bottom of the river to a he=
ight of=20


_
"because otherwise the country would lose the enormous quantity of molasses=
 which results from=20

the sugar-making, which has a considerable value, but cannot be employed fo=
r other uses;" but=20

the government ought to maintain the value of the monopolized beverages, an=
d at the same time=20

facilitate the exportation of rum and brandy. [147] He recommends, besides =
the extension of the=20

wine monopoly:] That, as a consequence, every other kind of beverage made i=
n the country be=20

prohibited in the islands for the common use of the Indians. That the manuf=
acture of brandy and=20

rum from sugar-cane be allowed only for the export trade. That each manufac=
turer be likewise=20

allowed to have a retail warehouse, under the imposts which they now pay. T=
hat the=20

manufacturers be compelled to establish their factories in the immediate vi=
cinity of Manila, where=20

they can and must be watched, at their own expense, by the revenue clerks. =
That all the brandy=20

and rum which is made from sugar be immediately deposited in warehouses, th=
e keys of which the=20

custom-house shall take charge of, the government levying on it moderate du=
ties for deposit as=20

well as for export. [148]    Of the head-money, or personal tax, from the C=
hinese  [The Chinese=20

were at first allowed in Filipinas only Sulphurous streams dashed from a th=
ousand rents, leaving=20

unfathomable fissures. Great forest trees lashed their heads together, or w=
ere snapped off by the=20

shocks. Small islands sank to the bottom of the river. Quantities of coal a=
nd charred wood were=20

thrown up; some lying a considerable distance from the fissures that discha=
rged them. Many boats=20

were lost; quite a number of people were buried under falling banks. It was=
 undoubtedly the most=20

violent convulsion in the history of our country. Reelfoot lake, now a note=
d fishing resort, we are=20

told was formed by this earthquake.  Time would fail us to give an especial=
 notice of the many=20

shocks received since the country has been more widely settled. With a noti=
ce of the recent=20

Charleston earthquake this list must be closed.  This convulsion owes its i=
mportance rather to its=20

location than to its violence. It was felt over about one-fourth of the ent=
ire country, its greatest=20

force being felt along the Atlantic coast from New Haven to Savannah. The a=
rea affected was=20

elliptical, and the shock was but little less severe at Atlanta, Georgia, i=
n East Tennessee, and=20

many North and South Carolina regions, than in Charleston itself. It was fe=
lt at Charleston at 9:51,=20

August 31, 1886, and reached Toronto,=20

the soil and work in handicrafts; but they have drawn into their possession=
 the control of trade and=20

commerce, "winning the good-will of the government and the tolerance of the=
 inhabitants of Manila=20

with a thousand intrigues unknown in the country. They have done in Filipin=
as what the Europeans=20

ought to have done, that is, to acquire wealth and send it, or themselves g=
o with it, to their own=20

country to establish commercial houses;" and thus they have added a marvelo=
us amount to the=20

wealth of China. Their method of doing business is explained--practically t=
he same as is done in=20

the United States at the present time; united capital and effort, division =
of the gains accordingly,=20

quick sales and small profits, etc. They have obtained the exclusive four m=
inutes. It did not travel=20

so readily westward as northward.  It is of course impossible to estimate e=
xactly the damage done.=20

A considerable number of important cities  [Illustration: CHARLESTON, S. C.=
]  suffered more or=20

less; but the majority were forgotten in the unusual severity at Charleston=
. The city appeared as=20

though it had been through a siege, or as if a gigantic charge of dynamite =
had been exploded=20

beneath it. In all directions might be seen heaps of ruins, houses totterin=
g, cracked, twisted--in all=20

stages of destruction. Ever and anon a fresh shock brought down some crumbl=
ing edifice with a=20

sullen roar, and a cloud of stifling dust veiled it from view. The night re=
sounded with the screams=20

of terrified fugitives, the tread of=20


_
trade, "and thereby have aroused the hostility of corporations and private =
persons, notwithstanding=20

that they are a class of peaceable and industrious people in the country." =
Bernaldez thinks that=20

their tax of six pesos a year is much too small, considering the advantages=
 which they enjoy and=20

the large fortunes which they acquire in the islands; in Batavia the Chines=
e pay the the groans and=20

cries of the wounded. The parks swarmed with those in search of a place of =
safety. Hundreds=20

were bruised or maimed by falling stones and timbers; not a few were killed=
 outright; others,=20

crushed in the wrecks, died a lingering death.  Appeals for aid were prompt=
ly responded to by all=20

portions of the country. Even those localities which had themselves suffere=
