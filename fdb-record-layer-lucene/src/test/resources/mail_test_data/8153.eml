"Vous aimez les tableaux     changeans: je veux vous contenter."      _Le D=

Sweet odours, radiant colours, glittering light!   How swift a change from =
the dusk sodden night=20

Of London in mid-winter! Duchesses of Brabant and Bourgogne, and kneeled lo=
w before him,=20

lifting up her sweet girlish face to him in lieu of speaking in a tongue as=
 yet unknown to her. Then=20

Charles took her by the hand, raised her and looked at her pensively; "and =
in this look the sweet=20

thought of love did enter into his heart." After the ladies had withdrawn f=
rom the royal presence,=20

the Sire de la Riviere, an old minister of Charles V., asked the king: "Sir=
e, what think you of this=20

young lady? shall she remain with us?" "By my faith, yes," replied Charles,=
 "we wish no other, for=20

she pleases us." There was no tarrying for elaborate ceremonies, fond as th=
e king was of them;=20

Charles insisted on an immediate wedding. He and the young German princess =
were married on=20

July 17, 1385, four days after this first interview. The bride was but four=
teen, and the groom not=20

quite seventeen; it was one of those infamous child marriages of which the =
history of Europe is too=20

full.  Isabeau de Baviere was already of a slothful habit, to be roused onl=
y by her love of=20

amusement, to purchase which neither she nor her young husband would spare =
anything. Luxury=20

and wild extravagance in dress, in entertainments, even in funerals, was ch=
aracteristic of the age;=20

the whole kingdom gave itself up to extravagance and debauchery; existence =
was one mad revel,=20

with no thought of who should pay the piper; all must dance and caper as if=
 bitten by the tarantula.=20

The very costumes are wild: "Here (we see) men-women comically tricked out,=
 and effeminately=20

trailing on the ground robes twelve ells long; there, others, whose figures=
 are distinctly defined by=20

their short Bohemian jackets and tight pantaloons, though with sleeves floa=
ting down to the=20

ground; here, men-beasts, embroidered all over with animals of every kind; =
there, men-music,=20

pricked all over with notes, from which one could sing before or behind; wh=
ile others placarded=20

themselves with a scrawl of signs and letters, which, no doubt, said nothin=
g good.... Rational=20

beings did not hesitate to disguise themselves in the satanic, bestial shap=
es which grin down upon=20

us from the eaves of churches. Women wore horns on their heads, men on thei=
r feet the peaks of=20

their shoes were twisted up into horns, griffins, serpents' tails. The wome=
n, above all, would have=20

made our spirits (of the age of Saint Louis) tremble; with their bosoms exp=
osed, they haughtily=20

paraded high above the heads of the men their gigantic hennin (the peaked a=
nd horned=20

headdress) with its scaffolding of horns, requiring them to turn sideways a=
nd stoop as often as=20

they went in or out of a room."  With all this outlandish fashion of dress =
the young queen was in=20

perfect accord; and the life of the court was one succession of brilliant e=
ntertainments, wicked in=20

their sensuality no less than in their waste of the revenues of a kingdom a=
lready impoverished by=20

long wars. During the early years of her presence--we cannot call it her ru=
le--in France, Isabeau=20



took no part in politics; neither did her husband, for that matter, since h=
e left the government in the=20

hands of his uncles, chief of whom was Philippe de Bourgogne. We shall ther=
efore have little to=20

record at first beyond some of the more noteworthy of the doings at the cou=
rt.  The first of these,=20

and one of the most scandalous, occurred in May, 1388; and the occasion whi=
ch it was intended=20

to celebrate merits some attention from those who would appreciate the utte=
r incapacity of Charles=20

VI. even at this period. To understand the circumstances we must go back to=
 the time when=20

Charles V. lay dying, and his brother, Louis, Duke of Anjou, waited in an a=
djoining room till the=20

breath should be out of the king's body. When the king was really dead, out=
 came Louis to seize=20

upon the plate and other movables of value. Hearing that Charles had concea=
led a considerable=20

treasure in the walls of his palace at Melun, and being unable to discover =
the hiding place, this=20

affectionate brother sent for the treasurer of the late king, and uttered t=
he grim threat: "You will find=20

that money for me, or off goes your head." The executioner was there with h=
is ax--the treasure=20

was found; and Louis carried it off to squander it in prosecuting his claim=
s to the throne of Naples.=20

Now he was dead, and his two sons were about to leave France to continue th=
e fight for Naples.=20

So far from remembering with resentment the enormous sums formerly stolen f=
rom him by this=20

very family, Charles VI. must needs squander more in a splendid show to cel=
ebrate the knighting=20

of the princes of Anjou.  That ceremony in which the young soldier of God s=
wore to defend the=20

right, with all the solemn and impressive ritual that the Church could devi=
se to sanctify and dignify=20

his act, was to be turned into a vile debauch. In the ancient abbey of Sain=
t-Denis, beside the=20

tombs of the great dead who had glorified France, were lodged "the Queen an=
d a bevy of=20

illustrious ladies." Monastery or no monastery, the monks must harbor these=
 fair guests, whom all=20

the rules of their=20


_
_Titania_ here might revel as at home;   Fair forms are floating soft as Pa=
phian foam,     Bright as=20

an iceberg-splinter.    Dianas doubtless, yet their frost holds fire;   The=
 snowiest bosom covers soft=20

desire,     And these are snowy, verily.   As blanched--and bare--as Himala=
ya's peaks,   Light-

vestured as a troop of dancing Greeks.     Waltz-measures ripple merrily.  =
  Merrily? Yes; the=20

music throbs with mirth,   Feet trip in time to it; yet what strange dearth=
     Of glee midst all these=20

graces!   The quickening fire of spirit, passion, will,   Seems scarce to m=
ove these dancing forms=20

or thrill     These irresponsive faces.    The Shadow smiled. "True, yet no=
t true," he said.   "Good=20

Form demands that men should look half dead,     And women semi-frozen.   Y=
et Nature lives=20

ow of pleasure,   She=20

 a young heart     Throbs=20

to the pulsing measure."    "Men meet to moon, and women whirl to wed,   Th=
e cynic says. Is joy in=20

life quite dead.     Gladness in concourse banished   From the parades of f=
ashionable youth?=20

the Shadow. "Questionings like these   Sound _gauche_ and gushing. Better f=

I believe, of eight or nine millions? This is about the figure required to =
provide the Members of the=20

London County Council with a moderate-sized palace, not perhaps entirely su=
ited to their exalted=20

dignity, but, at least, sufficient to house them in something like proper a=
nd fitting style. A site=20

should be secured on the Embankment, by clearing away Somerset House, and t=
he intervening=20

buildings, including the blocks of the Inner and Middle Temple, which could=
 all be carted away and=20

re-erected further down, say, at Millbank, and on the space thus secured a =
white marble structure=20

could be reared with an adequately imposing facade facing the river, that w=
ould in some slight=20

degree represent the majesty of the illustrious body destined to occupy it.=
 I don't say that nine=20

millions would be enough thoroughly to carry out the design I have in view,=
 but your surplus might=20

 I have, owing to=20

the present exorbitant rates for postage, not communicated for many years. =
This fact has=20

suggested to me that _the_ golden opportunity now offers itself to you of r=

opening closed correspondence, restoring natural affection in otherwise har=
dened breasts, and, in=20

a word, consolidating the Empire, it may be, for countless ages yet unborn.=
 Spend your surplus,=20

Sir, in providing this country and all her dependencies with a _farthing po=
stage_--mind, not a=20

_penny_, but a FARTHING POSTAGE! I read somewhere that the actual cost to t=
he Government=20

for the transport of letters was at the rate of ten for a penny. Thus your =
four millions sunk in the=20

enterprise ought to produce you an immediate profit, at least so I make it,=
 of six millions a year.=20

But, profit or no profit, think of the boon to thousands of Englishmen like=
 myself, who could then=20

stand a penny-worth of correspondence in the year, with children with whom =
now they are unable=20

to communicate, owing to the cruel and crushing charge of fivepence for a s=
ingle letter. Picture=20

SELEY's=20

article in this month's _Harper_? He advises a higher rate of pay for the r=
ank and file of the British=20

Army? _Verbum sap._ You understand. It is clear what you must do with your =
surplus. Ensure=20

TOMMY ATKINS six-and-six-pence a day, and you will have every Regiment in t=

thronged with real live Gentlemen. This is what is wanted (so I gather from=
 Lord W.'s article) to=20

make the British Army, if not the most costly, at least the most respectabl=
e in the world. Come, Sir,=20

do not make it necessary that you should be reminded a second time of your =
plain and obvious=20

duty by    A SANGUINE AND EXPECTANT PRIVATE.  SIR,--There can be no doubt i=

the proper destination of those surplus millions, the fitting disposition o=
f which, I am informed, is=20

involving you in no little perplexity. They seem in a special manner to fur=
nish the legitimate answer=20

to the almost universal cry, now going forth, for "Free Education." Here th=
en is your opportunity.=20

And it is a magnificent one. Your surplus will enable a wise and paternal G=
overnment to give not=20

merely education, free of cost, to every child in the three kingdoms, but w=

means to infuse the very highest culture attainable into the very dregs of =

Italian, German, Russian, French, Chinese, together with riding, dancing, p=
ainting in oil colours,=20

 No--no. I will reveal=20

d action did but=20

redress the wrong I designed to effect!  _The E._ (_annoyed_). This is a se=
rious matter, reflecting=20

as it does upon the legitimacy of my lately recovered son. What proof have =
you, woman, of your=20

preposterous allegation?  _Mrs. H._ None, my lord,--but these--  [_Exhibits=

B._ (_triumphantly_). And so--oh, Father, Mother, ROSE--dear, dear ROSE--I =
am no acrobat after=20

all!  _The E._ (_sternly_). Would you were anything half so serviceable to =
the community, Sir! I=20

have no superstitious reverence for rank, and am, I trust, sufficiently enl=
ightened to discern worth=20

and merit--even beneath the spangled vest of the humblest acrobat. Your fos=
ter-brother, brief as=20

our acquaintance has been, has already endeared himself to all hearts, whil=
e you have borne a=20

trifling reverse of fortune with sullen discontent and conspicuous incapaci=
ty. He has perfected=20

himself in a lofty and distinguished profession during years spent by _you_=
, Sir, in idly cumbering=20

the earth of Eton and Oxford. Shall I allow him to suffer by a purely accid=
ental coincidence? Never!=20

I owe him reparation, and it shall be paid to the uttermost penny. From thi=
s day, I adopt him as my=20

eldest son, and the heir to my earldom, and all other real and personal exc=
luded. Says the=20

chronicle of a monk of Saint-Denis: "To gaze on their exceeding beauty you =
would have said it=20

was a meeting of the heathen goddesses." And so they were, heathen goddesse=
s, with a lawless=20

Venus at their head. But the festival, be it remembered, was a religious on=
e; we go "to hear mass=20

every morning." The religious services over, the day was given up to magnif=
icent tourneys and rich=20

banquets, and the nights to balls, masked balls, "to hide blushes." For thr=
ee days and three nights=20

was this revel maintained, the mad Bacchanals scrupling not to defile even =
the most sacred places=20

by their orgies, which the presence of the king and queen rather encouraged=
 than checked. It was=20

the queen herself, indeed, who loved all this. One does not wonder that peo=
ple began to whisper=20

that she had already shown more than decorous affection for her brother-in-=
law, the brilliant Louis=20

d'Orleans; in the _pervigilium Veneris_, the "wake of Venus," as they calle=
d the balls at Saint-

Denis, who could say what might have happened?  The king attained his major=
ity; in a sudden fit=20

of impatience, he threw off the control of his uncles, till now the rulers =
of France, and set up his=20

own government. The royal princes had not been good governors; each one was=
 too intent upon=20

his own interests to consider those of France; and accordingly France hated=
 them, and hoped for=20

better things from the young king and his sober government of humble counse=
llors. But Charles=20

needed excitement; in lieu of war there were fetes, upon which he squandere=
d money till the=20

people groaned and the councillors trembled. Any excuse was sufficient for =
holding a fete. Of a=20

sudden, Charles and Isabeau remembered that the queen had never been crowne=
d and had=20

never made a royal entry into Paris. The city was ordered to make unexample=
d preparations to=20

receive Isabeau as queen; she had been living in Paris a good part of the t=
ime during the four=20

years since her marriage, but that did not do away with the necessity for a=
 formal introduction to=20

the capital of her dominions.  With his usual love of the spectacular, Froi=
ssart gives us an account,=20

covering many pages, of the reception of Isabeau. The Parisians dressed the=
mselves in gay=20

costumes of scarlet, and green, and gold, each vying with his neighbor and =
rivalling, as far as he=20

dared, the gorgeousness of the courtiers and nobles. The fountains ran wine=
 and milk, the=20

balconies and windows were festooned with flowers and crowded with eager sp=
ectators, while=20

musicians played before the doors of many houses and miracle plays were giv=
en on the street=20

corners. On August 22nd, the young queen, hailed at every step by the accla=
mations of the=20

throngs in the streets, and accompanied by a crowd of noble ladies borne in=
 sumptuous litters,=20

passed from Saint-Denis to Paris. At the Porte Saint-Denis there was a cano=
py representing=20

"heaven, made full of stars, and within it young children apparelled like a=
ngels," and an "image of=20

Our Lady herself," holding the infant Saviour. Two of the angels, let down =
from heaven by ropes,=20



placed a golden crown upon Isabeau's head, singing: "Sweet lady amid the _f=
leur-de-lis_, are you=20

not from heaven?"  "Then when the Queen and the ladies were passed by," hav=
ing greatly=20

admired this "high heaven richly apparelled with the arms of France, the de=
vice of the king," they=20

proceeded along the street till they came to a place where was a fountain, =
"which was covered=20

over with a cloth of fine azure, painted full of flower-de-luces of gold...=
. And out of this fountain=20

there issued in great streams spiced drinks and claret, and about this foun=
tain there were young=20

maidens richly apparelled, with rich chaplets on their heads, singing melod=
iously: great pleasure it=20

was to hear them. And they held in their hands cups and goblets of gold, of=
fering and giving to=20

drink all such as passed by; and the Queen rested there and regaled herself=
 and regarded them,=20

having great pleasure in that device, and so did all other ladies and damos=
els that saw it."=20

Passing onward to where stood the Church of Saint James, "all the street of=
 Saint-Denis was=20

covered over with cloths of silk and camlet, such plenty as though such clo=
ths should cost nothing.=20

And I, Sir John Froissart, author of this history, was present and saw all =
this and had great wonder=20

where such number of cloths of silk were gotten; there was as great plenty =
as though they had=20

been in Alexandria or Damascus; and all the houses on both sides of the gre=
at street of Saint-

Denis were hanged with cloths of Arras of divers histories, the which was p=
leasure to behold."  At=20

the "bridge of Paris," hard by Notre-Dame, fresh wonders awaited the queen.=
 A master tumbler,=20

from Genoa, "had tied a cord on the highest house of the bridge of Saint-Mi=
chael over all the=20

houses, and the other end was tied on the highest tower in Our Lady's churc=
h. And as the Queen=20

passed by, and was in the street called Our Lady's street, because it was l=
ate, this said master=20

with two burning candles in his hands issued out of a little stage that he =
had made on the height of=20

Our Lady's tower, and singing he went upon the cord all along the great str=
eet, so that all saw him=20

and had marvel how it might be." This tumbler, dressed as an angel, gave an=
other crown to=20

Isabeau, and then mounting skyward disappeared through a slit in the canopy=
 over the bridge, as=20

if he were returning to heaven.  In the great Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Isab=
eau was crowned,=20

saying, says Froissart,--not without an equivocation of which he himself wa=
s doubtless quite=20

unconscious,--"what prayers she pleased." But the festivities were not over=
; we have omitted=20

many a detail given by Froissart plays and dumb shows presenting indiscrimi=
nately the sacred=20

histories of Scripture and the legends of French heroes, castles full of mo=
ck monsters,=20

representations of the entire heavenly hierarchy and of the dream which had=
 suggested to Charles=20

the emblem of the flying hart. With gay balls at night and jousts and mirac=
le plays by day, the=20

celebration was continued for several days. The merchants of Paris presente=
d to the queen and to=20

Valentine Visconti, the new Duchess of Orleans, most costly jewels, rich se=
ts of plate, in gold and=20

silver, cups, and salvers, and dishes of gold, "whereat everyone marvelled =
greatly," and the royal=20

pair were greatly pleased.  Who was to pay for all the display in this entr=
y of the queen? The=20

citizens of Paris had fondly hoped that, what with their show of loyal joy =
and their presents,--

aggregating some sixty thousand crowns in gold,--the king would be pleased =
to remit certain=20

oppressive taxes. On the contrary, it was the citizens of Paris who were co=
mpelled to pay for all=20

this fine foolery. Charles departed from Paris a few days after the conclus=
ion of his fete, leaving=20

behind him an increased tax and an ordinance prohibiting, under penalty of =
death, the use of=20

certain silver coins of small value; this latter restriction, which was int=
ended to favor the circulation=20

of his new and debased coinage, inflicted peculiar hardships upon the poor.=
 Thus, Isabeau was=20



already inflicting much misery upon the poor of that capital which had lavi=
shed so much upon her;=20

and before we bestow our commiseration upon the miserable king in after day=
s, it is well to=20

remember the miseries of his subjects.  Life had been as yet but a dream fo=
r Charles and his=20

queen; though France was rapidly going to ruin under their extravagant and =
heedless rule, could=20

they not chase away care in revels surpassing any that France had yet seen?=
 But the dream was=20

soon to become a nightmare, the hideous nightmare of insanity, for this hee=
dless monarch.  It was=20

not until three years after the coronation of Isabeau that her unfortunate =
husband had the first=20

attack of what was, unmistakably, insanity, though to any reasonable creatu=
re the behavior of the=20

whole court would have seemed mad enough from the beginning. One of those a=
cts of lawless=20

private vengeance which were so soon to become dreadfully familiar in Franc=
e first excited the=20

king almost to the point of frenzy. A certain Pierre de Craon, a noble who =
had already=20

distinguished himself by robbing the late Duke of Anjou, was driven from Pa=
ris by the Duke of=20

Orleans, to whose wife he had imprudently revealed some of the infidelities=
 of her too licentious=20

husband. He fled to Jean de Montfort, who persuaded him that the person chi=
efly responsible for=20

his disgrace was the renowned Olivier de Clisson, Conetable of France. Secr=
etly returning to=20

Paris, Pierre de Craon lay in wait for the constable one night and fell upo=
n him with a band of=20

bravoes. The brave De Clisson was seriously wounded, and the villains fled,=
 thinking him slain.=20

Charles, who favored De Clisson, was furious at the outrage, and breathed v=
engeance against=20

Craon. As Jean de Montfort constituted himself the defender of this wretch,=
 and refused to deliver=20

him up to justice, the lands belonging to Craon were devastated, his wife a=
nd children were driven=20

forth, and war was declared upon Brittany.  The king had always had a passi=
onate love for the=20

more theatrical side of war, and, as soon as the constable was able to ride=
, the king and his forces=20

marched upon Brittany. We may pass over the earlier part of his campaign, t=
aken up in aimless=20

marches and as aimless parleying. On August 5, 1392, during a spell of inte=
nsely hot weather,=20

Charles marched out of Mans. He had been suffering from a fever, was much w=
eakened, and had=20

for days been greatly harassed by the heat and the baffling of his delayed =
vengeance; he was=20

moody, and "his spirits sore troubled and travailed," when, as he rode thro=
ugh the forest of Mans,=20

there suddenly rushed to his horse's head a wild figure, half clothed, and =
manifestly mad. Seizing=20

the king's bridle, the apparition exclaimed, with that strange earnestness =
so often noticeable in=20

those whose reason is unbalanced: "Sir King, ride no further forward, for t=
hou art betrayed." The=20

servants hastily drove away the poor madman, and sought to restore the king=
's peace of mind,=20

more seriously disturbed than ever by a happening that might well have star=
tled even a person in=20

strong health. On rode the cavalcade, out over the open plains, where a bla=
zing sun beat full upon=20

the king's head, protected only by a thin cap. Suddenly Charles started, ch=
ecked his horse, drew=20

his sword, and charged upon the pages who rode beside him, crying, as if in=
 the heat of battle:=20

"On, on! down with these traitors!" Madly pursuing the pages, he put to fli=
ght even the Duke of=20

Orleans, and was not overpowered and disarmed until he and his horse were q=
uite exhausted.  He=20

recognized none of those about him, and only physical weakness prevented hi=
m from becoming=20

again a frantic lunatic. The poor weak brain, over-excited and worn-out by =
the long years of=20

debauchery, was hopelessly overthrown; though sane at times, and even for c=
onsiderable periods,=20

Charles VI. was evermore incapable of ruling, being a mere helpless and unh=
appy tool in the=20

hands of the heartless people who could win sufficient power to rule what w=
as left of France.  The=20



queen was no Blanche de Castille, able to rule a kingdom, and the king's un=
cle, Philippe de=20

Bourgogne, was at first the real power in France. He was opposed by Isabeau=
 de Baviere and her=20

paramour and brother-in-law, Louis d'Orleans, brother of the king; and the =
history of the next few=20

years is largely a record of shameless intrigues between these people to ob=
tain control of the mad=20

king, in whose name many an odious thing was done. The regency should, by r=
ights, have=20

devolved upon the king's eldest brother, Louis d'Orleans, who was twenty-on=
e years of age at the=20

time of Charles's madness; but the Dukes of Burgundy and Berri set him asid=
e for "his too great=20

youth." There might have been found some precedent for recognizing Isabeau =
as regent; but there=20

is no evidence that she ever made any serious efforts to establish her clai=
m; for she was content=20

with that which the Duke of Burgundy was quite willing to allow her, viz., =
the squandering of=20

money--not his money--in her pleasures. Isabeau was nominally associated in=
 the council that=20

exercised the powers of regency, but she was really under the control of th=
e Duchess of=20

Burgundy, whom the chroniclers call "a haughty and cruel woman."  With such=
 care as the doctors=20

of the period were likely to give him, there was not much hope of the perma=
nent restoration of the=20

king's reason. One learned physician, however, did have the correct idea as=
 to the cause of=20

Charles's malady and prescribed a moderate diet and a quiet life for him. U=
nder this wise=20

treatment Charles soon recovered as much reason as he had ever had; but the=
 regimen imposed=20

by the physician's orders was as distasteful to the king as it was to Isabe=
au. The queen, under=20

pretext of furnishing diversions for him, began again the wild life of deba=
uchery which had been=20

the prime cause of Charles's insanity. It was at one of these festivals tha=
t occurred the famous=20

"dance of savages" that so nearly deprived France of her mad king.  The chr=
onicler of Saint-Denis=20

says that "it was an evil custom of the time in many parts of France to ind=
ulge unreproved in all=20

sorts of indecent follies at the marriage of a widow, and to assume with th=
eir extravagant masks=20

and disguises the liberty of making all sorts of obscene remarks to the bri=
de and bridegroom." It=20

was at a sort of charivari held one night (January 29, 1393) in celebration=
 of the marriage of one of=20

Isabeau's German waiting women, a widow, that Hugues de Guisay, one of thos=
e panders to the=20

follies of the rich and extravagant who plan their "amusements" for them, u=
ndertook to divert the=20

mad king, the queen, and the whole court. He devised "six coats made of lin=
en cloth covered with=20

pitch and thereon flax like hair." Charles put on one of these, and he and =
his five satyr-like=20

companions, much delighted with their resemblance to things of horrid form,=
 pranced in among the=20

other revellers. The five were linked together by a chain, the king, fortun=
ately, being loose and=20

preceding them. As the wretched Charles, in his disgraceful costume, was tr=
ying to fulfil the part of=20

a satyr indeed by teasing and exchanging coarse jests with the young Duches=
s of Berri, Louis=20

d'Orleans came into the room. Wishing to discover who it was so disguised--=
we refuse to credit=20

the account which says he acted in mere heedless desire to see what would h=
appen--he held a=20

torch too near one of the tow-clad gallants. In an instant the whole five u=
nhappy victims of folly=20

were in a blaze. "Save the King! save the King!" cried one of them as he bu=
rned. Fortunately the=20

Duchess of Berri, guessing that it was the king who stood by her, covered h=
im with her cloak and=20

prevented his costume from catching fire. Four of the others, whom not a so=
ul in this gay=20

assemblage seems to have made serious attempts to rescue, were burned to de=
ath, one escaping=20

by jumping into a large tub of water in the pantry. Among those who died wa=
s the wanton deviser=20

of this foolish and dangerous amusement; and as his body was borne to the t=
omb through the=20



streets of Paris the people cursed him and called out after him, as he had =
been wont to speak to=20

the poor when it pleased him to amuse himself with them: "Bark, dog!"  Wond=
erful to relate, this=20

scene of horror at the dance of savages does not appear to have occasioned =
an immediate=20

relapse on the part of the king. Isabeau, who had manifested extreme terror=
 and sympathy at the=20

moment of her husband's peril, joined him in making virtuous resolutions to=
 lead a more regular=20

and sober life. But the love of pleasure was too firmly rooted; there were =
renewed debauches, and=20

Charles became more violently mad than before, knowing neither his wife nor=
 his children, and=20

even denying his own identity. And so it continued throughout his life: fol=
lowing the regimen of his=20

doctors, Charles would have a lucid interval; then he chased the doctors fr=
om the palace and went=20

back to debauchery and to madness. Astrologers were sent for to enlist the =
sidereal powers in his=20

behalf; one astrologer brought a book which he affirmed the Lord had sent t=
o Adam by the hand of=20

an angel; what good it had done to Adam appeareth not, but it certainly did=
 not relieve the king.=20

Then there were two Austin friars (!) who made a draught of powdered pearls=
 and enlisted all the=20

forces of sorcery in the king's behalf; but the king did not recover, and t=
he friars were handed over=20

to the Inquisition, condemned, and decapitated.  Meanwhile any affection th=
at Isabeau may have=20

felt for her husband had passed away. She had found the Duke of Burgundy at=
 last unendurably=20

parsimonious; Louis d'Orleans was far more liberal with the money of the ki=
ngdom; besides, he=20

was a handsome rake, whom all the women loved; it was inevitable that Isabe=
au should ally=20

herself with the man who was willing not only to share her wanton pleasures=
 but to squeeze out of=20

the people the money required for them. The people, particularly the people=
 of Paris, hated the=20

Duke of Orleans because he was always imposing more taxes, and loved the Du=
ke of Burgundy=20

because he was politic enough to pretend to reduce taxes. It is therefore n=
ot surprising that we=20

have so many accounts of the outrageous conduct of Isabeau de Baviere and L=
ouis d'Orleans; for=20

if the people are long-suffering, they yet do not forget.  In order to meet=
 some part of the expenses=20

incurred by the prodigality of the court, Louis d'Orleans and the queen, in=
 1405, imposed a new=20

tax. The prisons were soon crowded with poor wretches who could not pay the=
 impost even by=20

selling all their belongings, to the very straw of their beds. While the qu=
een amused herself the=20

people cursed. Not knowing what could become of the great sums raised and s=
quandered by the=20

worthless pair, the people said that Isabeau sent cartloads of gold into Ba=
varia and that Louis=20

wasted it in magnificent structures on his domain at Couci and at Pierrefon=
ds.  The wild=20

accusations of a maddened people, however, were not without excuse. This mi=
serable wanton=20

who was Queen of France left her husband, the poor, good-natured madman, an=
d her children to=20

the care of servants whose wages, in the midst of all this waste of the pub=
lic money, she forgot to=20

pay. The servants neglected both children and husband; the King of France w=
as allowed to remain=20

in filth and rags, covered with vermin that made repulsive sores upon him, =
while the little dauphin=20

was but a half starved ragamuffin. One of the physicians discovered in what=
 state Charles was: he=20

had refused to bathe or to change his clothes for five months, and there wa=
s danger of his dying=20

from sheer filth. Disguising some of his attendants in fearful costumes, th=
e physician sent them=20

into the mad king's den, where they terrified him into passivity and manage=
d to bathe him, dress=20

his sores, and change his clothes before the fit of terror passed away. Whe=
n Charles next had a=20

lucid interval he learned of the neglect of Isabeau, thanked those who had =
been more tender than=20

his wife, and gave one lady, who had tried to care for the dauphin, a goble=
t of gold.  The=20



indignation of the people was great; all classes united in abhorrence of th=
is shameless wife and=20

mother. An Austin friar, bolder than the rest, preached a sermon before Isa=
beau and openly=20

reproved her wantonness: "At your court reigns dame Venus, and her waiting =
maids are Lechery=20

and Gormandise." The queen and her idle and vicious courtiers wished him pu=
nished for his=20

effrontery; but Charles, hearing what he had said, declared that he liked s=
uch sermons, sent for=20

the preacher, listened with interest and attention to his recital of the wo=
es of the kingdom,=20

projected reforms--and went mad again.  While the fit of reform was on, Lou=
is d'Orleans, terrified=20

by a storm that had overtaken him and Isabeau in one of their pleasure-jaun=
ts, vowed to repent=20

and pay his debts. At these glad tidings over eight hundred creditors assem=
bled; but the clouds=20

rolled away, and with them went Louis's desire to be honest. He laughed at =
the creditors and gave=20

secret orders to debase the coinage.  The poor king was just sane enough to=
 realize that things=20

were going wrong; he appealed for help to the Duke of Burgundy. The vigorou=
s and pitiless Jean=20

Sans Peur, who had succeeded Philippe le Hardi in Burgundy, came down upon =
Paris, and=20

Isabeau fled with Orleans to Melun, abandoning Charles, but planning to car=
ry off next day the=20

royal children and those of the Duke of Burgundy. Jean de Bourgogne, howeve=
r, overtook the=20

children and brought them back to Paris, where he now (August, 1405) establ=
ished himself in the=20

Louvre.  So outrageous had been the spoliation under Isabeau and Louis that=
 the Parisians=20

welcomed Jean as a deliverer. The queen, under cover of a pretended right t=
o appropriate goods=20

for royal uses, had systematically not only taken the necessaries of life, =
provisions and the like, but=20

had seized merchandise, jewels, money stored away by the owners, and furnit=
ure, plundering=20

even the hospitals, and storing these stolen goods with the intention of se=
lling them at auction.=20

Greed was her predominating trait, and so we are not surprised to find her =
hatred of Jean Sans=20

Peur increasing to the point of virulence when she was deprived of the oppo=
rtunity of robbing=20

unmolested. Unfortunately for her, Orleans was not a man of ability or ener=
gy sufficient to cope=20

successfully with Jean de Bourgogne, and the struggle between the two dukes=
 merely exhausted=20

the resources of Orleans without seriously impairing those of his opponent.=
 Isabeau, moreover,=20

was not bloodthirsty; both her indolence and her interest impelled her to f=
avor the peace between=20

the two dukes which was brought about in the closing months of 1407.  Louis=
 was ill; in mere=20

kindness his cousin of Burgundy visited him, and a reconciliation was effec=
ted. As soon as Louis=20

was recovered from his indisposition the two, accompanied by the old Duke d=
e Berri, who was=20

anxious to promote peace, heard mass and took communion together, swearing =
fraternal love for=20

each other. This was on Sunday, November 27, 1407. On the next Wednesday ev=
ening Louis d'=20

Orleans went as usual to sup with Isabeau at the Hotel Barbette, and was in=
 particularly high=20

spirits, attempting to divert the queen, who had been much distressed at th=
e birth of a stillborn=20

child, a love child, as people said. About eight o'clock in the evening, a =
message, apparently from=20

the king, summoned Louis, and as he went in response to the summons, accomp=
anied by but a=20

few pages and servants, he was set upon and hacked to pieces in the streets=
 of Paris by a gang of=20

ruffians under one Raoul d'Octonville.  The assassins made good their escap=
e before people=20

knew what had happened. When the death of the king's brother was discovered=
, great was the=20

consternation; for all knew that such a crime had not been committed by an =
obscure scoundrel,=20

and the question was asked, what great man had hired the assassins? In a fe=
w days Jean de=20

Bourgogne, in a mood between terror and impudent bravado, confessed that he=
 was guilty of the=20



foul murder of the man to whom he had so recently sworn amity in the sight =
of God. Fearing that=20

even his rank could not sufficiently shield him from punishment for this sh=
edding of the blood royal,=20

Jean fled from Paris to his own dominions.  The dead man had been neither a=
 good brother nor a=20

good prince; with all of those facile graces which might have made him lova=
ble to all men and did=20

make him fascinating to most women he had combined no sterling qualities. H=
e was not cruel; that=20

is the only relatively good trait--and even that but negative--that we can =
set over against his=20

reckless frivolity and licentiousness, his shameless infidelity and disrega=
rd of oaths and the most=20

sacred obligations. He was not mourned in Paris, which was shocked but not =
grieved at his death;=20

he was not sincerely mourned by the infamous queen whom he had led away fro=
m her duty to her=20

pitiful, insane husband; but he was mourned by the woman whom he had most d=
eeply wronged--

his wife.  This wife was the lovely Italian, Valentine Visconti, daughter o=
f the Duke of Milan, who=20

had married Louis in 1389 and was a sharer in the splendors of the gorgeous=
 entry of Isabeau de=20

Baviere into Paris. From the first she had just cause of complaint--and yet=
 never complained--of=20

the infidelity of a husband whom she loved with her whole heart, but whose =
love she could not=20

retain. Froissart, who was no friend of hers, tells us a most curious and e=
xtraordinary story of one=20

of Valentine's rivals, whom Louis had preferred to his wife as early as 139=
2. It appears that Louis=20

d'Orleans had rashly confided the details of an amour to that Pierre de Cra=
on whom we have=20

mentioned before, and this knight revealed them to Valentine. The young duc=
hess sent at once for=20

the lady to whom Louis was devoting himself: "Wilt thou do me wrong with my=
 lord, my husband?"=20

The woman was abashed, and in her confusion confessed her guilt. Then said =
Valentine: "Thus it=20

is: I am informed that my lord loveth you, and you him, and the matter is s=
o far gone between you=20

that in such a place and at such a time he promised you a thousand crowns o=
f gold to be his=20

paramour; howbeit, you did refuse it as then, wherein you did wisely, and t=
herefore I pardon you;=20

but I charge you on your life that you commune=20

*       *  KICKED!  (_By the Foot of=20

Clara Groomley._)  CHAPTER IV. AND LAST.  In the little sitting-room above =
his shop sat Mr.=20

ASSID ROPES. It was the afternoon before Christmas Day. He had generously a=
llowed all his=20

assistants to leave. "If anybody wants their hair cut, or their hat ironed,=
" he said, "I'll do it myself,=20

and then they'll wish they hadn't."  Yet, when a customer rapped on the flo=
or below, Mr. ROPES=20

felt exceedingly angry.  "What do you want?" he called down the stairs.  "I=
 want my hat ironed,"=20

said a clear, manly voice.  "Go away! Your hat doesn't want ironing. Go to =
bed!"  "I will not go=20

away," said the clear, firm voice, "until you have attended to my hat--hat =
once, if you please."  Mr.=20

ROPES came grumbling down the stairs. For one moment he gazed at the man in=
 the shop, and=20

then flung his arms round him and wept tears of joy.  "My dear old friend, =
CYRIL MUSH!" he=20

exclaimed.  They had been boys together at Eton, and rowed in the Trinity b=
oat together at=20

Cambridge. Fate had separated them.  In less than a minute they were talkin=
g over old times=20

together in the little sitting-room over the shop. CYRIL MUSH was delighted=
. "You can't charge an=20

old friend anything for just ironing his hat," he said, with his peculiarly=
 winning smile.  Before Mr.=20

ROPES could correct this impression, another voice was heard in the shop be=
low.  "Can you=20

come down for a minute--to oblige a lady?"  Mr. ROPES descended once more. =
In a minute he=20

returned.  "Awfully sorry, MUSH, but I must go. I've got to shave a dead po=
odle, and the men are=20

coming to stuff it at nine o'clock to-night. It's for a lady--_noblesse obl=
ige_, you know. I'll finish your=20

hat when I come back."  In a hearken no more to his commanding." From the t=
reatment he=20

received at the next meeting with his lady-love, Louis discovered that some=
thing was amiss, and=20

she finally told him of the interview with Valentine. Louis then went home =
to his wife, "and showed=20

her more token of love than ever he did before," finally wheedling her into=
 telling him who had=20

been the talebearer. The sequel we know: how Craon was driven from court, a=
nd returned to=20

attempt the assassination of De Clisson.  But if her husband did not love h=
er, the king manifested=20

a real and innocent affection for Valentine, his "dear sister," remembering=
 her and asking for her=20

when, in his madness, he knew no other. Yet even out of this there was to c=
ome evil for Valentine;=20

for the Duchess of Burgundy, fearing the growth of the Orleans influence ov=
er the king, spread evil=20

reports about the innocent relations between Charles and Valentine. Adding =
to these insinuations=20

an accusation far more dangerous than that of adultery would have been in s=
uch a court, the=20

Burgundians asserted that the king's insanity was produced and continued by=
 the power of=20



witchcraft; and this accusation, fastened upon Valentine, obtained such cre=
dit that her husband=20

had to remove her from court to a sort of exile in his own dominions. We fi=
nd even worse=20

accusations credited by the unsympathetic Froissart, who reports that she h=
ad unwittingly=20

poisoned her own child in an attempt to poison the dauphin, for "this lady =
was of high mind,=20

envious and covetous of the delights and state of this world. Gladly she wo=
uld have seen the Duke=20

her husband attain to the crown of France, she had not cared how."  Through=
 good report and evil=20

report the poor duchess had lived on, loving her husband and leading a life=
 at least far more=20

regular than that of the court, though she possessed the Italian love of th=
e artistic and the beautiful=20

and was very extravagant. The king, now often idiotic when he was not ravin=
g, had been turned=20

completely against her. To amuse and distract him, and also to strengthen t=
he Burgundian=20

influence, the Duke of Burgundy provided him with a fair child as playmate =
and mistress. To the=20

sway once held by Valentine over Charles there now succeeded Odette. She wa=
s little more than=20

a child, but she became mistress as well as playfellow of the mad king. Of =
humble origin (_filia=20

cujusdam mercatoris equorum_ daughter of a certain horse dealer), she wears=
 in court history a=20

name better than that she was born to, Odette de Champdivers; and the peopl=
e, indulgent of the=20

sin of the mad king, called her "la petite reine." She was happy, it seems,=
 and kind to the king,=20

amused him, was loved by him; and, more true to him than was quite pleasing=
 to the Burgundians,=20

did not play false to France in later years when Burgundy and England were =
leagued together, but=20

is said to have used her influence over the king rather for France=20


_
placed it on his head. He went out into the streets. He was wondering what =
poodle it was which=20

Mr. ASSID ROPES had gone to shave. Could it be the same? No, most certainly=
 not. So of course=20

it was the same.  In the meanwhile Mr. ROPES had arrived at the house, and =
had been ushered=20

into the chamber of death. The light was very bad, and he happened to cut t=
he animal while=20

engaged in shaving it.  "Very sorry, Sir," said Mr. ROPES, from force of ha=
bit, "but it's not my fault.=20

You've got a pimple there, and you jerked your head just as I was going ove=
r it. A little powder will=20

put that all right."  [Illustration]  Suddenly it flashed across him that t=
he poodle was not dead if the=20

blood flowed. He rushed out of the room, and found himself confronted by a =
handsome, wicked-

looking man, of about thirty.  "Excuse me, Sir, but that poodle's not dead.=
 It's in a trance. Just run=20

down to the kitchen and fetch me some brandy, some blankets, and some hot b=
ricks, and I'll her=20

we know little more than that she died about 1424, leaving a daughter whose=
 legitimacy was=20

recognized by Charles VII., and who was honorably married to a petty gentle=
man of Poitou.  When=20

the handsome, elegant, but unfaithful Louis was murdered, Valentine was at =
Blois with her=20

children; the eldest was but sixteen, old enough to feel the loss, but not =
old enough to avenge it.=20

But Valentine determined to avenge her husband; her grief gave her energy. =
She came at once to=20

Paris with her youngest son and her daughter-in-law, that Isabelle de Franc=
e who was already a=20

widow from the death of Richard II., and now affianced to the young Duke d'=
Orleans. The king,=20

sane at the time, was inexpressibly shocked by the murder of his brother, a=
nd was moved to tears=20

when Valentine came before him to demand justice upon the murderer. He prom=
ised to act, and=20

probably really meant what he said, but his mind was not capable of sustain=
ed effort. Jean de=20

Bourgogne was making=20


_
"The dog _is_ dead, and in a very few hours he'll be stuffed," was the crue=
l reply. "You needn't=20

trouble to bring it round. If you've brought your tackle round, you can sha=
ve it."  "I've been shaving=20

it--and that's how I know."  A door opened on the other side of the passage=
, and a fair retinue so=20

formidable in numbers as to be an army; and Valentine retired to Blois, to =
bide her time. Jean,=20

hardly opposed by Isabeau or any of the few who might be supposed either to=
 exercise some=20

authority or to sympathize with the Orleans faction, came to Paris, boldly =
hired lawyers and=20


_
came out in tears and a black dress.  "What's the matter, ALGERNON?" she sa=
id.  "It's nothing,=20

ALICE. This idiot says that _Tommy's_ not dead."  With one wild yell of joy=
, a yell that broke the=20

gas-globes, and unlinked carriages at all the principal London railway stat=
ions, ALICE SMITH fell=20

senseless on the floor.  "Out you get!" exclaimed her cousin ALGERNON to Mr=
. ROPES. "If the=20

dog is not dead, come back in two hours, and _prove_ it--otherwise it will =
be dead, and stuffed=20

too."  "Now then," said ALGERNON, when Mr. ROPES had gone, "if _Tommy Atkin=
s_ is not dead,=20

he soon will be." He grasped his walking-stick, and tried the door of the r=
oom. It was locked. Mr.=20

ROPES had locked it, and taken the key!  "Aha!" he exclaimed. "Baffled! Baf=
fled! Kindly turn the=20

lime-light off the swooned maiden, and throw it on to me. Sympathetic music=
 from the violins, if=20

you please."         * * *  One hour had passed. Mr. ALKALOID, the photogra=
pher, had met Mr.=20

MUSH. Mr. ALKALOID had come from Ryde to London to get his hair singed. The=
 two accidentally=20

met Mr. ROPES as he was dashing wildly down the street towards his own shop=
. In one minute all=20

was explained. Mr. ALKALOID had fetched his photographic apparatus, and the=
 three were=20

careering back to the house where the poodle lay dead. But was he dead? You=
 know he wasn't,=20

as well upon the person of the Duke d'Orleans," and made the poor madman wh=
o was king issue=20

letters patent declaring that he, the king, "took out of his heart all disp=
leasure against his very dear=20

and well-beloved cousin of Burgundy for having put out of the world his bro=
ther of Orleans."=20

Isabeau, who had shown herself utterly incapable of action in this crisis, =
remained at Melun until=20

the arrogant and dangerous Duke of Burgundy had forced matters in this way =
and had been called=20

away to repress a rebellion of Liege. Then she and her allies, with three t=
housand troops, entered=20

Paris (August 26, 1408). Valentine came next day, and with her the young Ch=
arles d'Orleans,=20

destined to become famous as one of France's sweetest poets, although kept =
a prisoner in=20

England for twenty-five years. The king being once more incapacitated, it w=
as decided that=20

Isabeau should preside at the hearing of the formal complaint of the Duches=
s of Orleans. When=20

the mourning widow and the youthful Duke of Orleans came before the council=
 to demand a=20

hearing, their plea was readily granted, for the menacing figure of Jean Sa=
ns Peur was no longer=20

there to intimidate Isabeau and the friends of his victim. The next day, be=
fore the young Duke of=20

Guyenne, who acted in the place of the king, the legal and ecclesiastical d=
ignitaries employed by=20

Valentine=20


_
"It's the only sure test," said ALKALOID. "If that dog's alive, he'll wag h=
is tail when I try to=20

photograph him. I never knew it fail."         * * *  Outside the door of t=
hat gorgeously-furnished room=20

stood an excited group. ALGERNON, the villain, was soliloquising. ALICE was=
 explaining to=20

CYRIL how he had dropped his note down the neck of the wrong girl--who was =
also named=20

SMITH--and how she had been compelled to believe him unfaithful. Mr. ROPES =
was listening=20

attentively at the key-hole, and CYRIL was kissing ALICE.  Within the room =
Mr. ALKALOID was=20

charges of sorcery and tyranny and to show that Jean de Bourgogne should be=
 punished for the=20

murder. The arguments of the Orleans advocates were far superior to the sha=
llow, sophistical,=20

utterly shameless harangues which had been delivered in defence of Jean. Th=
e legal advocate=20

asked, on behalf of Valentine and her children, that Jean be compelled to c=
ome humbly to the=20

Louvre and there to apologize to the king and to the widow and her children=
; that his houses in=20

Paris be razed; that he be ordered to expend great sums in founding churche=
s and convents, in=20


_
it dead, but of course that doesn't humbug _you_.)  "Now then, we're ready,=
" they heard Mr.=20

ALKALOID say. "Don't stare. Just a natural, easy--now then--thank you!"  Th=
ere was dead silence=20

within the room and without. Then the door opened, and Mr. ALKALOID came ou=
t cheerfully.  "The=20

poodle's dead all right," he said. "What you took to be blood, ROPES, was b=
lacking off your razor.=20

You really ought not to strop them on your boot. I'll walk round to your sh=
op with you. I want my=20

hair singed."  ALICE went into hysterics; ALGERNON swooned with joy; and CY=
RIL MUSH had a=20

fit.  At the moment of going to press, they are all three still in the abov=
e condition. The dog, in the=20

meantime, has been accidentally stuffed with the stuffing intended for the =
stuffer's Christmas=20

goose. The goose was found, on carving, to be stuffed with several his crim=
e; and that he be=20

banished beyond seas for twenty years, and, after his return, be not suffer=
ed to approach nearer=20

than one hundred leagues to the queen and the Orleans princes.  But Valenti=
ne, though she=20

prevailed on the queen and the princes of the council to agree to summon Je=
an de Bourgogne to=20

trial before the Court of Parliament, was impotent to prosecute her cause. =
For Jean, after a=20

ferocious suppression of the rebellious citizens of Liege, came boldly back=
 to Paris, was received=20

as a victor and a friend by the people of Paris, and so overawed the other =
members of the council=20

that the Orleans sympathizers dared not even dream of prosecuting the trial=
 of this unabashed=20

murderer.  Valentine de Milan and her sons retired to Blois, fearing even f=
urther outrages from the=20

triumphant Burgundians. Well might she now have=20
