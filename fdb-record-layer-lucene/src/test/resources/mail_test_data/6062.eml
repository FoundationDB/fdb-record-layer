. Dana agreed with this view, supplemented every _
other; trying to read the other's thoughts; the one penitent and craving fo=
rgiveness, the other cold=20

almost to sternness, and yet not unwilling to forgive and forget.  Deadwood=
 Dick's wound was=20

quickly and skillfully dressed; it was not dangerous, but was so exceedingl=
y painful that the pangs=20

soon brought him back to consciousness.  The moment he opened his eyes he s=
aw Fearless=20

Frank and Anita--perceived their position toward each other, and that it wo=
uld require only a single=20

word to bridge the chasm between them. A hard look came into his eyes as th=
ey gazed through=20

the holes in the mask, then he gazed at Alice--sweet piquant Alice--and the=
 hardness melted like=20

snow before the spring sunshine.  "Thank God it was no deeper," he said, si=
tting upright, and=20

rubbing the tips of his black-glove fingers over the patches that covered t=
he gash, "Although=20

deucedly bothersome, it is not of much account."  To the surprise of all he=
 sprung to his feet, and=20

strode to the door. Here he stopped, and looked around for a few moments, s=
niffing at the cool=20

mountain breeze, as a dog would. A single cedar tree stood by the cabin, it=
s branches, bare and=20

naked, stretching out like huge arms above the doorway. And it was at these=
 the road-agent=20

gazed, a savage gleam in his piercing black eyes.  After a few careful obse=
rvations, he turned his=20

face within the cabin.  "Justin McKenzie," he said, gazing at the young man=
, steadily, "I want you=20

to do me a service. Go to my camp, and say to my men that I desire their pr=
esence here, together=20

with the two prisoners, and a couple of stout lariats, with nooses at the e=
nd of them. Hurry, now!"=20

Fearless Frank started a trifle, for he seemed to recognize the voice; but =
the next instant he bowed=20

assent, and left the cabin. When he was gone, Dick turned to Redburn.  "Hav=
e you a glass of=20

water handy, Cap? This jab in the gullet makes me somewhat thirsty," he sai=
d.  Redburn nodded,=20

and procured the drink; then a strange silence pervaded the cabin--a silenc=
e that no one seemed=20

willing to break.  At last the tramp of many feet was heard, and a moment l=
ater the road-agents,=20

with Fearless Frank at their head, reached the doorway, where they halted. =
The moment=20

Deadwood Dick came forward, there was a wild, deafening cheer.  "Hurra! hur=
ra! Deadwood Dick,=20

Prince of the Road, still lives. Three long hearty cheers, lads, and a humm=
er!" cried Fearless=20

Frank, and then the mountain echoes reverberated with a thousand discordant=
 yells of hurrah.=20

The young road-agent responded with a nod, and then said:  "The prisoners; =
have you them=20

there?"  "Here they are, Cap!" cried a score of voices, and the two Filmore=
s were trotted out to the=20

front, with ropes already about their necks. "Shall we h'ist 'em?"  "Not je=
st yet, boys: I have a few=20

words to say, first."  Then turning half-about in the doorway, Deadwood Dic=
k continued:  "Ladies=20

and gentlemen, a little tragedy is about to take place here soon, and it be=
comes necessary that I=20

should say a few words explaining what cause I have for hanging these two w=
retches whom you=20

see here.  "Therefore, I will tell you a short story, and you will see that=
 my cause is just, as we look=20

at these things here in this delectable country of the Black Hills. To begi=
n with:  "My name is, to=20

you, _Edward Harris!_" and here the road-agent flung aside the black mask, =
revealing the smiling=20

face of the young card-sharp. "I have another--my family name--but I do not=
 use it, preferring=20

Harris to it. Anita, yonder; is my sister.  "Several years ago, when we wer=
e children, living in one of=20

the Eastern States, we were made orphans by the death of our parents, who w=
ere drowned while=20

driving upon a frozen lake in company with my uncle, Alexander Filmore, and=
 his son, Clarence--

those are the parties yonder, and as God is my judge, I believe they are an=
swerable for the death=20

of our father and mother.  "Alexander Filmore was appointed guardian over u=
s, and executor of=20

our property, which amounted to somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty thou=
sand dollars, my=20



father having been for years extensively engaged in speculation, at which h=
e was most always=20

successful.  "From the day of their death we began to receive the most tyra=
nnical treatment. We=20

were whipped, kicked about, and kept in a half-starved condition. Twice whe=
n we were in bed,=20

and, as he supposed, asleep, Alexander Filmore came to us and attempted to =
assassinate us, but=20

my watchfulness was a match for his villainy, and we escaped death at his h=
ands.  "Finding that=20

this kind of life was unbearable, I appealed to our neighbors and even to t=
he courts for protection,=20

but my enemy was a man of great influence, and after many vain attempts, I =
found that I could not=20

obtain a hearing; that nothing remained for me to do but to fight my own wa=
y. And I did fight it.=20

"Out of my father's safe I purloined a sum of money sufficient to defray ou=
r expenses for a while,=20

and then, taking Anita with me, I fled from the home of my youth. I came fi=
rst to Fort Laramie,=20

where I spent a year in the service of a fur-trader.  "My guardian, during =
that year, sent three men=20

out to kill me, but they had the tables turned on them, and their bones lay=
 bleaching even now on=20

Laramie plains.  "During that year my sister met a gay, dashing young range=
r, who hailed to the=20

name of Justin McKenzie, and of course she fell in love with him. That was =
natural, as he was=20

handsome, suave and gallant, and, more than all, reported tolerably well to=
-do.  "I made inquiries,=20

and found that there was nothing against his moral character, so I made no =
objections to his=20

paying his attentions to Anita.  "But one day a great surprise came.  "On r=
eturning from a buffalo-

hunt of several days' duration I found my home deserted, and a letter from =
Anita stating that she=20

had gone with McKenzie to Cheyenne to live; they were not married yet, but =
would be, soon.=20

"That aroused the hellish part of my passionate nature. I believed that McK=
enzie was leading her a=20

life of dishonor, and it made my blood boil to even think of it. Death, I s=
wore, should be his reward=20

for this infidelity, and mounting my horse I set out in hot haste for Cheye=
nne.  "But I arrived there=20

too late to accomplish my mission of vengeance.  "I found Anita and took he=
r back to my home, a=20

sad and sorrowing maiden; McKenzie I could not find; he had heard of my com=
ing, and fled to=20

escape my avenging hand. But over the head of my weeping sister, I swore a =
fearful oath of=20

vengeance, and I have it yet to keep. I believe there had been some kind of=
 a sham marriage;=20

Anita would never speak on the subject, so I had to guess at the terrible t=
ruth.  "And there's where=20

you made an accursed mess of the whole affair!" cried McKenzie, stepping in=
to the cabin, and=20

leading Anita forward, by the hand. "Before-God and man _I acknowledge Anit=
a Harris to be my=20

legally wedded wife_. Listen, Edward Harris, and I will explain. That day t=
hat you came to=20

Cheyenne in pursuit of me, I'll acknowledge I committed an error--one that =
has caused me much=20

trouble since. The case was this:  "I was the nearest of kin to a rich old =
fur-trader, who proposed to=20

leave me all his property at his death: but he was a desperate woman-hater,=
 and bound me to a=20

promise that I would never marry.  "Tempted by the lust for gold, I yielded=
, and he drew up a will in=20

my favor. This was before I met Anita here.  "When we went to Cheyenne, the=
 old man was lying=20

at the point of death; so I told Anita that we would not be married for a f=
ew days, until we saw how=20

matters were going to shape. If he died, we would be married secretly, and =
she would return to=20

your roof until I could get possession of my inheritance, when we would go =
to some other part of=20

the country to live. If he recovered, I would marry her anyway, and let the=
 old man go to Tophet=20

with his money-bags. I see now how I was in the wrong.  "Well, that very da=
y, before your arrival,=20

the old man himself pounced down upon us, and cursed me up hill and down, f=
or my treachery,=20

and forthwith struck me out from his will. I immediately sent for a chaplai=
n, and was married to=20



Anita. I then went up to see the old man and find if I could not effect a c=
ompromise with him.  "He=20

told me if I would go with him before Anita and swear that she was not lega=
lly my wife, and that I=20

would never live with her, he would again alter his will in my favor.  "Kno=
wing that that would make=20

no difference, so far as the law was concerned, I sent Anita a note apprisi=
ng her of what was=20

coming, and stating that she had best return to you until the old man shoul=
d die, when I would=20

come for her. Subsequently I went before her in company with the old man an=
d swore as I had=20

promised to do, and when I departed she was weeping bitterly, but I natural=
ly supposed it was=20

sham grief. A month later, on his death-bed, the old trader showed me the l=
etter I had sent her,=20

and I realized that not only was my little game up, but that I had cheated =
myself out of a love that=20

was true. I was left entirely out of the will, and ever since I have bitter=
ly cursed the day that=20

tempted me to try to win gold and love at the same time. Here, Edward Harri=
s," and the young=20

man drew a packet of papers from inside his pocket, "are two certificates o=
f my marriage, one for=20

Anita, and one for myself. You see now, that, although mine has been a grie=
vous error, no=20

dishonor is coupled with your sister's name."  Ned Harris took one of the d=
ocuments and glanced=20

over it, the expression on his face softening. A moment later he turned and=
 grasped McKenzie's=20

hand.  "God bless you, old boy!" he said, huskily. "I am the one who has er=
red, and if you have it=20

in your heart to forgive me, try and do so. I do not expect much quarter in=
 this world, you know.=20

There is Anita; take her, if she will come to you, and may God shower his e=
ternal blessings upon=20

you both!"  McKenzie turned around with open arms, and Anita flew to his em=
brace with a low glad=20

cry. There was not a dry eye in the room.  There was an impatient surging o=
f the crowd outside;=20

Dick saw that his men were longing for the sport ahead; so he resumed his s=
tory:  "There is not=20

much more to add," he said, after a moment's thought. "I fled into the Blac=
k Hills when the first=20

whispers of gold got afloat, and chancing upon this valley, I built us a ho=
me here, wherein to live=20

away the rest of our lives.  "In time I organized the band of men you see a=
round me, and took to=20

the road. Of this my sister knew nothing. The Hills have been my haunt ever=
 since, and during all=20

this time yon scheming knaves"--pointing to the prisoners--"have been const=
antly sending out men=20

to murder me. The last tool, Hugh Vansevere by name, boldly posted up rewar=
d papers in the=20

most frequented routes, and he went the same way as his predecessors. Seein=
g that nothing=20

could be accomplished through aids, my enemies have at last come out to sup=
erintend my=20

butchery in person; and but for the timely interference of Calamity Jane an=
d Justin McKenzie, a=20

short time since, I should have ere this been numbered with the dead. Now, =
I am inclined to be=20

merciful to only those who have been merciful to me; therefore, I have deci=
ded that Alexander and=20

Clarence Filmore shall pay the penalty of hanging, for their attempted crim=
es. Boys, _string 'em=20

up!_"  So saying, Deadwood Dick stepped without the cabin, and closed the d=
oor behind him.=20

Redburn also shut down and curtained the windows, to keep out the horrible =
sight and sounds.=20

But, for all this, those inside could not help but hear the pleading cries =
of the doomed wretches,=20

the tramp of heavy feet, the hushed babble of voices, and at last the terri=
ble shout of, "Heave 'o!=20

up they go!" which signaled the commencement of the victims' journey into m=
id-air.  Then there=20

was a long blank pause; not a sound was heard, not a voice spoke, nor a foo=
t moved. This silence=20

was speedily broken, however, by two heavy falls, followed almost immediate=
ly by the tramp of=20

feet.  Not till all was again quiet did Redburn venture to open the door an=
d look out. All was dark=20

and still.  The road-agents had gone, and left no sign of their work behind=
.  When morning=20



dawned, they were seen to have re-camped on the was a welcome sight, for it=
 meant an easy=20

meeting of the pay-roll for that week and two succeeding weeks.  But the ch=
eck was from a=20

manufacturing patent-medicine company.  Without a moment's hesitation, Mr. =
Curtis slipped it=20

back into the envelope, saying: "Of course, _that_ we can't take."  He retu=
rned the check, never=20

gave the matter a second thought, and went out and borrowed more money to m=
eet his pay-roll.=20

With all respect to American publishers, there are very few who could have =
done this--or indeed,=20

would do it today, under similar conditions--particularly in that day when =
it was the custom for all=20

magazines to accept patent-medicine advertising; _The Ladies' Home Journal_=
 was practically the=20

only publication of standing in the United States refusing that class of bu=
siness!  Bok now saw=20

advertising done on a large scale by a man who believed in plenty of white =
space surrounding the=20

announcement in the advertisement.  He paid Mr. Howells $10,000 for his aut=
obiography, and Mr.=20

Curtis spent $50,000 in advertising it.  "It is not expense," he would expl=
ain to Bok, "it is=20

investment.  We are investing in a trademark.  It will all come back in tim=
e."  And when the first=20

$100,000 did not come back as Mr. Curtis figured, he would send another $10=
0,000 after it, and=20

then both came back.  Bok's experience in advertisement writing was now to =
stand him in=20

excellent stead.  He wrote all the advertisements, and from that day to the=
 day of his retirement,=20

practically every advertisement of the magazine was written by him.  Mr. Cu=
rtis believed that the=20

editor should write the advertisements of a magazine's articles.  "You are =
the one who knows=20

them, what is in them and your purpose," he said to Bok, who keenly enjoyed=
 this advertisement=20

writing.  He put less and less in his advertisements. Mr. Curtis made them =
larger and larger in the=20

space which they occupied in the media used.  In this way _The Ladies' Home=
 Journal_=20

advertisements became distinctive for their use of white space, and as the =
advertising world began=20

to say: "You can't miss them."  Only one feature was advertised at one time=
, but the "feature" was=20

always carefully selected for its wide popular appeal, and then Mr. Curtis =
spared no expense to=20

advertise it abundantly.  As much as $400,000 was spent in one year in adve=
rtising only a few=20

features--a gigantic sum in those days, approached by no other periodical. =
 But Mr. Curtis believed=20

in showing the advertising world that he was willing to take his own medici=
ne.  Naturally, such a=20

campaign of publicity announcing the most popular attractions offered by an=
y magazine of the day=20

had but one effect: the circulation leaped forward by bounds, and the adver=
tising columns of the=20

magazine rapidly filled up.  The success of _The Ladies' Home Journal_ bega=
n to look like an=20

assured fact, even to the most sceptical.  As a matter of fact, it was only=
 at its beginning, as both=20

publisher and editor knew.  But they desired to fill the particular field o=
f the magazine so quickly=20

and fully that there would be small room for competition.  The woman's maga=
zine field was to=20

belong to them!     CHAPTER XIV  MEETING A REVERSE OR TWO  With the hithert=
o unreached=20

magazine circulation of a million copies a month in sight, Edward Bok decid=
ed to give a broader=20

scope to the periodical.  He was determined to lay under contribution not o=
nly the most famous=20

writers of the day, but also to seek out those well-known persons who usual=
ly did not contribute to=20

the magazines; always keeping in mind the popular appeal of his material, b=
ut likewise aiming=20

constantly to widen its scope and gradually to lift its standard.  The edit=
or was very desirous of=20

securing something for his magazine that would delight children, and he hit=
 upon the idea of trying=20

to induce Lewis Carroll to write another _Alice in Wonderland_ series.  He =
was told by English=20

friends that this would be difficult, since the author led a secluded life =
at Oxford and hardly ever=20



admitted any one into his confidence.  But Bok wanted to beard the lion in =
his den, and an Oxford=20

graduate volunteered to introduce him to an Oxford don through whom, if it =
were at all possible, he=20

could reach the author. The journey to Oxford was made, and Bok was introdu=
ced to the don, who=20

turned out to be no less a person than the original possessor of the highly=
 colored vocabulary of=20

the "White Rabbit" of the Alice stories.  "Impossible," immediately declare=
d the don.  "You couldn't=20

persuade Dodgson to consider it."  Bok, however, persisted, and it so happe=
ned that the don liked=20

what he called "American perseverance."  "Well, come along," he said.  "We'=
ll beard the lion in his=20

den, as you say, and see what happens.  You know, of course, that it is the=
 Reverend Charles L.=20

Dodgson that we are going to see, and I must introduce you to that person, =
not to Lewis Carroll.=20

He is a tutor in mathematics here, as you doubtless know; lives a rigidly s=
ecluded life; dislikes=20

strangers; makes no friends; and yet withal is one of the most delightful m=
en in the world if he=20

wants to be."  But as it happened upon this special occasion when Bok was i=
ntroduced to him in=20

his chambers in Tom Quad, Mr. Dodgson did not "want to be" delightful.  The=
re was no doubt that=20

back of the studied reserve was a kindly, charming, gracious gentleman, but=
 Bok's profession had=20

been mentioned and the author was on rigid guard.  When Bok explained that =
one of the special=20

reasons for his journey from America was to see him, the Oxford mathematici=
an sufficiently=20

softened to ask the editor to sit down.  Bok then broached his mission.  "Y=
ou are quite in error, Mr.=20

Bok," was the Dodgson comment.  "You are not speaking to the person you thi=
nk you are=20

addressing."  For a moment Bok was taken aback.  Then he decided to go righ=
t to the point.  "Do I=20

understand, Mr. Dodgson, that you are not 'Lewis Carroll'; that you did not=
 write _Alice in=20

Wonderland_?"  For an answer the tutor rose, went into another room, and re=
turned with a book=20

which he handed to Bok.  "This is my book," he said simply.  It was entitle=
d _An Elementary=20

Treatise on Determinants_, by C. L. Dodgson.  When he looked up, Bok found =
the author's eyes=20

riveted on him.  "Yes," said Bok.  "I know, Mr. Dodgson.  If I remember cor=
rectly, this is the same=20

book of which you sent a copy to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, when she wrot=
e to you for a=20

personal copy of your _Alice_."  Dodgson made no comment.  The face was abs=
olutely without=20

expression save a kindly compassion intended to convey to the editor that h=
e was making a=20

terrible mistake.  "As I said to you in the beginning, Mr. Bok, you are in =
error.  You are not=20

speaking to 'Lewis Carroll.'"  And then: "Is this the first time you have v=
isited Oxford?"  Bok said it=20

was; and there followed the most delightful two hours with the Oxford mathe=
matician and the=20

Oxford don, walking about and into the wonderful college buildings, and aft=
erward the three had a=20

bite of lunch together.  But all efforts to return to "Lewis Carroll" were =
futile.  While saying good-by=20

to his host, Bok remarked:  "I can't help expressing my disappointment, Mr.=
 Dodgson, in my quest=20

in behalf of the thousands of American children who love you and who would =
so gladly welcome=20

'Lewis Carroll' back."  The mention of children and their love for him mome=
ntarily had its effect.=20

For an instant a different light came into the eyes, and Bok instinctively =
realized Dodgson was=20

about to say something.  But he checked himself.  Bok had almost caught him=
 off his guard.  "I am=20

sorry," he finally said at the parting at the door, "that you should be dis=
appointed, for the sake of=20

the children as well as for your own sake.  I only regret that I cannot rem=
ove the disappointment."=20

As they later walked to the station, the don said: "That is his attitude to=
ward all, even toward me.=20

He is not 'Lewis Carroll' to any one; is extremely sensitive on the point, =
and will not acknowledge=20

his identity.  That is why he lives so much to himself.  He is in daily dre=
ad that some one will=20



mention _Alice_ in his presence.  Curious, but there it is."  Edward Bok's =
next quest was to be=20

even more disappointing; he was never even to reach the presence of the per=
son he sought.  This=20

was Florence Nightingale, the Crimean nurse.  Bok was desirous of securing =
her own story of her=20

experiences, but on every hand he found an unwillingness even to take him t=
o her house.  "No=20

use," said everybody.  "She won't see any one.  Hates publicity and all tha=
t sort of thing, and=20

shuns the public."  Nevertheless, the editor journeyed to the famous nurse'=
s home on South=20

Street, in the West End of London, only to be told that "Miss Nightingale n=
ever receives strangers."=20

"But I am not a stranger," insisted the editor.  "I am one of her friends f=
rom America.  Please take=20

my card to her."  This mollified the faithful secretary, but the word insta=
ntly came back that Miss=20

Nightingale was not receiving any one that day.  Bok wrote her a letter ask=
ing for an appointment,=20

which was never answered.  Then he wrote another, took it personally to the=
 house, and awaited=20

an answer, only to receive the message that "Miss Nightingale says there is=
 no answer to the=20

letter."  Bok had with such remarkable uniformity secured whatever he sough=
t, that these=20

experiences were new to him.  Frankly, they puzzled him.  He was not easily=
 baffled, but baffled=20

he now was, and that twice in succession.  Turn as he might, he could find =
no way in which to=20

reopen an approach to either the Oxford tutor or the Crimean nurse.  They w=
ere plainly too much=20

for him, and he had to acknowledge his defeat.  The experience was good for=
 him; he did not=20

realize this at the time, nor did he enjoy the sensation of not getting wha=
t he wanted.=20

Nevertheless, a reverse or two was due.  Not that his success was having an=
y undesirable effect=20

upon him; his Dutch common sense saved him from any such calamity.  But at =
thirty years of age=20

it is not good for any one, no matter how well balanced, to have things com=
e his way too fast and=20

too consistently.  And here were breaks.  He could not have everything he w=
anted, and it was just=20

as well that he should find that out.  In his next quest he found himself a=
gain opposed by his=20

London friends. Unable to secure a new _Alice in Wonderland_ for his child =
readers, he=20

determined to give them Kate Greenaway.  But here he had selected another r=
ecluse.  Everybody=20

discouraged him.  The artist never saw visitors, he was told, and she parti=
cularly shunned editors=20

and publishers.  Her own publishers confessed that Miss Greenaway was inacc=
essible to them.=20

"We conduct all our business with her by correspondence.  I have never seen=
 her personally=20

myself," said a member of the firm.  Bok inwardly decided that two failures=
 in two days were=20

sufficient, and he made up his mind that there should not be a third.  He t=
ook a bus for the long=20

ride to Hampstead Heath, where the illustrator lived, and finally stood bef=
ore a picturesque Queen=20

Anne house that one would have recognized at once, with its lower story of =
red brick, its upper=20

part covered with red tiles, its windows of every size and shape, as the in=
spiration of Kate=20

Greenaway's pictures.  As it turned out later, Miss Greenaway's sister open=
ed the door and told=20

the visitor that Miss Greenaway was not at home.  "But, pardon me, has not =
Miss Greenaway=20

returned?  Is not that she?" asked Bok, as he indicated a figure just comin=
g down the stairs.  And=20

as the sister turned to see, Bok stepped into the hall.  At least he was in=
side!  Bok had never seen=20

a photograph of Miss Greenaway, he did not know that the figure coming down=
-stairs was the=20

artist; but his instinct had led him right, and good fortune was with him. =
 He now introduced himself=20

to Kate Greenaway, and explained that one of his objects in coming to Londo=
n was to see her on=20

behalf of thousands of American children.  Naturally there was nothing for =
the illustrator to do but=20

to welcome her visitor.  She took him into the garden, where he saw at once=
 that he was seated=20



under the apple-tree of Miss Greenaway's pictures.  It was in full bloom, a=
 veritable picture of=20

spring loveliness.  Bok's=20


_
slope, where the smoke of their camp-fires rose in graceful white columns t=
hrough the clear=20

transparent atmosphere.  During the day Dick met Alice Terry, as she was ga=
thering flowers, a=20

short distance from the cabin.  "Alice--Miss Terry," he said, gravely, "I h=
ave come to ask you to be=20

my wife. I love you, and want you for my own darling. Be mine, Alice, and I=
 will mend my ways,=20

and settle down to an honest, straightforward life."  The beautiful girl lo=
oked up pityingly.  "No,"=20

she said, shaking her head, her tone kind and respectful, "I cannot love yo=
u, and never can be=20

your wife, Mr. Harris."  "You love another?" he interrogated.  She did not =
answer, but the tell-tale=20

blush that suffused her cheek did, for her.  "It is Redburn!" he said, posi=
tively. "Very well; give him=20

my congratulations. See, Alice;" here the young road-agent took the crape m=
ask from his bosom;=20

"I now resume the wearing of this mask. Your refusal has decided my future.=
 A merry road-agent I=20

have been, and a merry road-agent I shall die. Now, good-by forever."      =
   *       *       *       *       *=20

On the following morning it was discovered that the road-agents and their d=
aring leader, together=20

with the no less heroic Calamity Jane, had left the valley--gone; whither, =
no one knew.  About a=20

month later, one day when Calamity Jane was watering her horse at the strea=
m, two miles above=20

Deadwood, the road-agent chief rode out of the chaparral and joined her.  H=
e was still masked,=20

well armed, and looking every inch a Prince of the Road.  "Jennie," he said=
, reining in his steed, "I=20

am lonely and want a companion to keep me company through life. You have no=
 one but yourself;=20

our spirits and general temperament agree. Will you marry me and become my =
queen?"  "No!"=20

said the girl, haughtily, sternly. "I have had all the _man_ I care for. We=
 can be friends, Dick; more=20

we can never be!"  "Very well, Jennie; I rec'on it is destined that I shall=
 live single. At any rate, I'll=20

never take a refusal from another woman. Yes, gal, we'll be friends, if not=
hing more."         *       *=20

*       *       *  There is little more to add.  We might write at length, =
but choose a few words to end=20

this o'er true romance of life in the Black Hills.  McKenzie and Anita were=
 remarried in Deadwood,=20

and at the same time Redburn led Alice Terry to the altar, which consummati=
on the "General"=20

avowed was "more or less of a good thing--consider'bly less o' more 'n' mor=
e o' less."  Through=20

eastern lawyers, a settlement of the Harris affairs was effected, the whole=
 of the property being=20

turned over to Anita, thereby placing her and Fearless Frank above want for=
 a lifetime.  Therefore=20

they gave up their interest in the Flower Pocket mines to Redburn and the "=
General."  Calamity=20

Jane is still in the Hills.  And grim and uncommunicative, there roams thro=
ugh the country of gold a=20

youth in black, at the head of a bold lawless gang of road-riders, who, fro=
m his unequaled daring,=20

has won and rightly deserves the name--Deadwood Dick, Prince of the Road.  =

atmosphere instantly changed.  Miss Greenaway conveyed the unmistakable imp=
ression that she=20

had been trapped, and Bok realized at once that he had a long and difficult=
 road ahead.  Still,=20

negotiate it he must and he did!  And after luncheon in the garden, with th=
e cat in his lap, Miss=20

Greenaway perceptibly thawed out, and when the editor left late that aftern=
oon he had the promise=20



of the artist that she would do her first magazine work for him.  That prom=
ise was kept monthly,=20

and for nearly two years her articles appeared, with satisfaction to Miss G=
reenaway and with great=20

success to the magazine.  Bok now devoted his attention to strengthening th=
e fiction in his=20

magazine.  He sought Mark Twain, and bought his two new stories; he secured=
 from Bret Harte a=20

tale which he had just finished, and then ran the gamut of the best fiction=
 writers of the day, and=20

secured their best output.  Marion Crawford, Conan Doyle, Sarah Orne Jewett=
, John Kendrick=20

Bangs, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Hamlin Garland, Mrs. Burton Harrison, Elizabeth=
 Stuart Phelps,=20

Mary E. Wilkins, Jerome K. Jerome, Anthony Hope, Joel Chandler Harris, and =
others followed in=20

rapid succession.  He next turned for a moment to his religious department,=
 decided that it needed=20

a freshening of interest, and secured Dwight L. Moody, whose evangelical wo=
rk was then so=20

prominently in the public eye, to conduct "Mr. Moody's Bible Class" in the =
magazine--practically a=20

study of the stated Bible lesson of the month with explanation in Moody's s=
imple and effective=20

style.  The authors for whom the _Journal_ was now publishing attracted the=
 attention of all the=20

writers of the day, and the supply of good material became too great for it=
s capacity.  Bok studied=20

the mechanical make-up, and felt that by some method he must find more room=
 in the front=20

portion.  He had allotted the first third of the magazine to the general li=
terary contents and the=20

latter two-thirds to departmental features.  Toward the close of the number=
, the departments=20

narrowed down from full pages to single columns with advertisements on each=
 side.  One day Bok=20

was handling a story by Rudyard Kipling which had overrun the space allowed=
 for it in the front.=20

The story had come late, and the rest of the front portion of the magazine =
had gone to press.  The=20

editor was in a quandary what to do with the two remaining columns of the K=
ipling tale.  There=20

were only two pages open, and these were at the back.  He remade those page=
s, and continued=20

the story from pages 6 and 7 to pages 38 and 39.  At once Bok saw that this=
 was an instance=20

where "necessity was the mother of invention."  He realized that if he coul=
d run some of his front=20

material over to the back he would relieve the pressure at the front, prese=
nt a more varied=20

contents there, and make his advertisements more valuable by putting them n=
ext to the most=20

expensive material in the magazine.  In the next issue he combined some of =
his smaller=20

departments in the back; and thus, in 1896, he inaugurated the method of "r=
unning over into the=20

back" which has now become a recognized principle in the make-up of magazin=
es of larger size.=20

At first, Bok's readers objected, but he explained why he did it; that they=
 were the benefiters by the=20

plan; and, so far as readers can be satisfied with what is, at best, an awk=
ward method of=20

presentation, they were content.  To-day the practice is undoubtedly follow=
ed to excess, some=20
