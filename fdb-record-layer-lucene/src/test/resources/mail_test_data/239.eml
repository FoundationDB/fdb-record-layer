The dry weather had introduced a season of anarchy along the whole frontier. The Atbara was 

fordable in many places, and it no longer formed the impassable barrier that necessitated peace. 

Mek Nimmur (the Leopard King) showed the cunning and ability of his namesake by pouncing 

upon his prey without a moment's warning, and retreating with equal dexterity. This frontier 

warfare, skilfully conducted by Mek Nimmur, was most advantageous to Theodorus, the King of 

Abyssinia, as the defence of the boundary was maintained against Egypt by a constant guerilla 

warfare. Upon several occasions, expeditions on a large scale had been organized against Mek 

Nimmur by the Governor-General of the Soudan; but they had invariably failed, as he retreated to 

the inaccessible mountains, where he had beaten them with loss, and they had simply wreaked 

their vengeance by burning the deserted villages of straw huts in the low lands, that a few dollars 

would quickly rebuild. Mek Nimmur was a most unpleasant neighbour to the Egyptian 

Government, and accordingly he was a great friend of the King Theodorus; he was, in fact, a 

shield that protected the heart of Abyssinia.  As I have already described, the Base were always at 

war with everybody; and as Mek Nimmur and the Abyssinians were constantly fighting with the 

Egyptians, the passage of the Atbara to the east bank was the commencement of a territory where 

the sword and lance represented the only law. The Hamran Arabs dared not venture with their 

flocks farther east than Geera, on the Settite, about twenty-five miles from Wat el Negur. From the 

point of junction of the Settite with the Atbara opposite Tomat to Geera, they were now encamped 

with their herds upon the   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg 

Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide 

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public 

domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by 

the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) 

are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is 

committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states 

of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, 

much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit 

donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND 

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org 

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation 

requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in 

such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully 

accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received 

from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project 

Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a 

number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,

to supply me with elephant-hunters (aggageers) and guides to accompany me into the Base and 

Mek Nimmur's country.  My intention was to thoroughly examine all the great rivers of Abyssinia 

that were tributaries to the Nile. These were the Settite, Royan, Angrab, Salaam, Rahad, Dinder, 

and the Blue Nile. If possible, I should traverse the Galla country, and crossing the Blue Nile, I
