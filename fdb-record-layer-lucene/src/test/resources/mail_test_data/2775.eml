 truth from their lips, and not from one who found pleasure in it. The snee=

was almost necessitated by the number of women for him to witness the leade=
r=E2=80=99s downfall.  Without another word to Black Buck, he whirled aroun=
d to hunt up Father Buck and Mother Deer. He wanted the truth from their li=
ps, and not from one who found pleasure in it. The sneer in Black Buck=E2=
=80=99s words angered him.  He found _
Mohammadanism--I mean the humane treatment of animals.  'There is no religi=
on which has taken=20

a higher view in its authoritative documents of animal life, and none where=
in the precept has been=20

so much honoured by its practical observance. 'There is no beast on earth,'=
 says the Kur-an, 'nor=20

bird which flieth with its wings, but the same is a people like unto you--u=
nto the Lord shall they=20

return;' and it is the current belief that animals will share with men the =
general resurrection, and be=20

judged according to their works. At the slaughter of an animal, the Prophet=
 ordered that the name=20

of God should always be named; but the words, 'the Compassionate, the Merci=
ful,' were to be=20

omitted; for, on the one hand, such an expression seemed a mockery to the s=
ufferer, and, on the=20

other, he could not bring himself to believe that the destruction of any li=
fe, however necessary,=20

could be altogether pleasing to the All-Merciful. 'In the name of God,' say=
s a pious Musalman=20

before he strikes the fatal blow; 'God is most great; God give thee patienc=
e to endure the affliction=20

which He hath allotted thee!' In the East there has been no moralist like B=
entham to insist in noble=20

words on the extension of the sphere of morality to all sentient beings, an=
d to be ridiculed for it by=20

people who call themselves religious; there has been no naturalist like Dar=
win, to demonstrate by=20

his marvellous powers of observation how large a part of the mental and mor=
al faculties which we=20

usually claim for ourselves alone we share with other beings; there has bee=
n no Oriental 'Society=20

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.' But one reason of this is not fa=
r to seek. What the=20

legislation of the last few years has at length attempted to do, and, from =
the mere fact that it is=20

legislation, must do ineffectually, has been long effected in the East by t=
he moral and religious=20

sentiment which, like almost everything that is good in that part of the wo=
rld, can be traced back, in=20

part at least, to the great Prophet of Arabia. In the East, so far as it ha=
s not been hardened by the=20

West, there is a real sympathy between man and the domestic animals; they u=
nderstand one=20

another; and the cruelties which the most humane of our countrymen unconsci=
ously effect in the=20

habitual use, for instance, of the muzzle or the bearing-rein on the most d=
ocile, the most patient,=20

the most faithful, and the most intelligent of their companions, are imposs=
ible in the East. An Arab=20

_cannot_ ill-treat his horse; and Mr. Lane bears emphatic testimony to the =
fact that in his long=20

residence in Egypt he never saw an ass or a dog (though the latter is there=
 looked upon as an=20

unclean animal) treated with cruelty, except in those cities which were ove=
rrun by Europeans.'[19]=20

There are some very beautiful traditions of the Prophet, showing the tender=
ness with which he=20

always treated animals and which he ever enjoined on his people. A man once=
 came to him with a=20

carpet and said, 'O Prophet, I passed through a wood and heard the voices o=
f the young of birds,=20

and I took and put them into my carpet, and their mother came fluttering ro=
und my head.' And the=20

Prophet said, 'Put them down;' and when he had put them down the mother joi=
ned the young. And=20

the Prophet said, 'Do you wonder at the affection of the mother towards her=
 young? I swear by=20

Him who has sent me, Verily God is more loving to his servants than the mot=
her to these young=20

birds. Return them to the place from which ye took them, and let their moth=
er be with them.' 'Fear=20

God with regard to animals,' said Mohammad; 'ride them when they are fit to=
 be ridden, and get off=20

when they are tired. Verily there are rewards for our doing good to dumb an=
imals, and giving them=20

water to drink.'   Such, in brief outline, is the religion of Mohammad. It =
is a form of pure theism,=20

simpler and more austere than the theism of most forms of modern Christiani=
ty, lofty in its=20

conception of the relation of man to God, and noble in its doctrine of the =
duty of man to your trail,=20

and Great Horn will find me. Hurry! Hurry!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWait a minute=
!=E2=80=9D exclaimed White Tail. =E2=80=9CCan=E2=80=99t you find=20



a hiding place, Rusty?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, many of them, but I must sho=
w you the way to the shallow brook.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CNo, you tell me how to find it,=E2=80=9D interrupted White Tail. =
=E2=80=9CI can run much faster alone.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s strai=

s. Good-bye, and thank you!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre you=20

going to leave me, White Tail?=E2=80=9D asked Bumper.  =E2=80=9CYes, Bumper=
, for you travel too slow for me. You=20

must find a burrow, and run for it. There must be one around here.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CYes, there=E2=80=99s a good one not=20

far from here. But don=E2=80=99t you need me?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, Bumper=
, I can outrun you, and if you come along=20

Puma may overtake me. Good-bye, and thank you! I=E2=80=99m off now.=E2=80=
=9D  Bumper waited until White Tail=20

was out of sight and hearing. Then he sought a safe burrow, and stood at th=
e entrance to watch=20

and listen. Pretty soon he heard a crash in the bushes, as Puma came dashin=
g along. Close=20

behind him was Great Horn the Owl, flitting from tree to tree.  =E2=80=9CI =
wonder where Rusty is,=E2=80=9D Great=20

Horn was saying. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t see him anywhere.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CNeither do I see White Tail,=E2=80=9D roared back Puma,=20

=E2=80=9Cbut I smell him. I=E2=80=99m on the right trail.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CI wish I could smell Rusty. My eyes are good, but my nose=20

isn=E2=80=99t as sharp as yours, Puma.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t c=
are where Rusty is,=E2=80=9D was the reply. =E2=80=9CI want White Tail,=20

and I=E2=80=99m going to catch him this time. He can=E2=80=99t escape as he=
 did before.=E2=80=9D  They swept past Bumper,=20

and made their way down the trail. The White Rabbit sighed, and said: =E2=
=80=9CI do hope White Tail will=20

escape.=E2=80=9D  And White Tail hoped so too. Meanwhile, he was running wi=
th all his might. As soon as=20

he had left his two friends, he leaped through the bushes or over them, wit=
h his head aimed=20

straight for the brook. He heard the roar of Puma behind him, and this spur=
red him on to greater=20

speed.  When he finally reached the shallow brook, he waded in and rapidly =
followed it down=20

toward its mouth where it joined the wider stream. When Puma reached the br=
ook he was baffled.=20

The scent he had been following suddenly stopped.  =E2=80=9CWhich way has h=
e gone?=E2=80=9D he growled. =E2=80=9CUp=20

or down? I=E2=80=99ll go up, Great Horn, and you go down. If you see him ho=
ot to me, and I=E2=80=99ll come.=E2=80=9D  Puma=20

crossed the stream and ran up it on the opposite side, and Great Horn flitt=
ed down it. Of course,=20

Great Horn found White Tail, but what happened then will appear next.=20

STORY XIII                     WHITE TAIL HEARS UNPLEASANT NEWS   Great Hor=
n found White=20

Tail a long way down the stream, but by that time morning was dawning, and =
the light began to=20

hurt the Owl=E2=80=99s eyes. He caught a glimpse of something moving throug=
h the bushes, and flew=20

toward it, for he could not in the early light see very far.  =E2=80=9CAh! =
I=E2=80=99ve found you, White Tail!=E2=80=9D he cried.=20

=E2=80=9CI knew it was you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow did you know it, Great H=
orn?=E2=80=9D asked White Tail. =E2=80=9CI know you can=E2=80=99t see=20

very well in this light. I don=E2=80=99t believe you can see me yet. You on=
ly hear me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe idea!=E2=80=9D snapped=20

Great Horn. =E2=80=9CI can see you as well as you can see me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t believe it,=E2=80=9D replied White Tail. =E2=80=9CCan=
=20

you see Rusty sitting on the end of my antlers?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CRusty! R=
usty! Is he there?=E2=80=9D exclaimed Great=20

Horn excitedly. Now the thought of being so near to his prey made him very =
hungry, and he flew=20

straight at White Tail=E2=80=99s head. This was what the buck wanted, and w=
hen the Owl was close=20

enough he swung his antlers around swiftly and caught Great Horn on the end=
. The blow was=20

enough to knock the breath out of the bird, and he fell with a plump in the=
 bushes.  =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s for=20

betraying me to Puma,=E2=80=9D White Tail said. =E2=80=9CNow call to him wh=
en you can get back your breath. I=E2=80=99m=20

off.=E2=80=9D  And through the bushes he ran, leaving Great Horn so surpris=
ed and stunned that he couldn=E2=80=99t=20

call to Puma for a long time. White Tail had made good his escape.  A few y=
ards through the=20

woods he came upon the other stream, the broad river which he knew so well.=
 He crossed this,=20

and made his way up the other=20


_
to the lower creation. There is little in it of superstition, less of compl=
exity of dogmas; it is an=20

exacting religion, without the repulsiveness of asceticism; severe, but not=
 merciless. On the other=20

hand, it is over-rigid and formal; it leaves too little to the believer and=
 too much to his ritual; it=20

places a prophet and a book between man and God, and practically discourage=
s the desire for a=20

direct relation between the Deity and his servant; it draws the picture of =
that God in too harsh=20

outlines, and leaves out too much of the tenderness and loving-kindness of =
the God of Christ's=20

teaching, and hence it has been the source of more intolerance and fanatica=
l hatred than most=20

creeds.  This religion is Islam as understood and taught by its Prophet, so=
 far as we can gather it=20

from the Kur-an, aided by those traditions which seem to have the stamp of =
authenticity. It need=20

hardly be said that it is not identical with the Islam with which the philo=
sophers of Baghdad=20

amused themselves, nor with the fantastic creed which the Fatimee Khalifs o=
f Egypt represented,=20

and brought in the person of El-Hakim to its limit of extravagance; nor is =
it the Islam with which as=20

much as with their ferocity the Karmatees aroused the fear and abhorrence o=
f all good Muslims.=20

Neither the Soofism of Persia nor the dervish sensation-religion of Turkey =
conform to this ancient=20

Islam, to which perhaps a modification of the Wahhabee puritanism would be =
the nearest=20

approach. The original faith of Mohammad has not gained by its development =
in foreign lands and=20

alien minds, and perhaps the best we can hope for modern Islam is that it m=
ay try the experiment=20

of retrogression, or rather seek to regain the simplicity of the old form w=
ithout losing the=20

advantages (if there be any) which it has acquired from contact with Wester=
n civilisation.   Islam is=20

unfortunately a social system as well as a religion; and herein lies the gr=
eat difficulty of fairly=20

estimating its good and its bad influence on the world. It is but in the na=
ture of things that the=20

teacher who lays down the law of the relation of man to God should also end=
eavour to appoint the=20

proper relation between man and his neighbour. Christianity was undoubtedly=
 a social even more=20

than a religious reform, but the social regulations were too indefinite, or=
 at all events too=20

impracticable, for any wide acceptance among the professors of the religion=
. Islam was less=20

fortunate. Mohammad not only promulgated a religion; he laid down a complet=
e social system,=20

containing minute regulations for a man's conduct in all circumstances of l=
ife, with due rewards or=20

penalties according to his fulfilment of these rules. As a religion Islam i=
s great: it has taught men to=20

worship one God and nose, he ran rapidly toward home. He had made his way o=
ut of Puma=E2=80=99s=20

hunting and through the higher timberland to his home.  His appearance was =
hailed with delight by=20

all his friends. =E2=80=9COh, White Tail, we thought you were dead!=E2=80=
=9D exclaimed one.  =E2=80=9CDead! Huh! Why=20

should you think that?=E2=80=9D he sniffed.  [Illustration: =E2=80=9CTHAT=
=E2=80=99S FOR BETRAYING ME TO PUMA,=E2=80=9D=20

WHITE TAIL SAID.]  =E2=80=9CYoung Black Buck said you were. He left you, an=
d he was sure the dogs=20

would catch you. He was sorry for you, but you couldn=E2=80=99t keep up wit=
h him, and he didn=E2=80=99t want to=20

die because you couldn=E2=80=99t run as fast as he.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat=
!=E2=80=9D exclaimed White Tail. =E2=80=9CHas Young Black=20

Buck returned? And did he tell such a tale?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhy, yes, th=
at=E2=80=99s what he said.=E2=80=9D  With a roar of rage=20

at this falsehood, White Tail pushed his way into the middle of the herd, a=
nd stood face to face=20

before Young Black Buck.  =E2=80=9CYou have been spreading more false stori=
es about me, Young Black=20

Buck!=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CAfter the way I saved you from the dogs, y=
ou lie about me!=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck=20

stood all atremble at the sight of White Tail. He had truly believed that t=
he dogs would catch him,=20

and he thought there would be no harm in telling a story of his escape that=
 would hurt White Tail=20

and help himself.  =E2=80=9CListen!=E2=80=9D White Tail added, swinging aro=
und and facing the herd. =E2=80=9CListen to a=20



story of treachery. Young Black Buck has lied to you, and you must hear me.=
 When he stumbled=20

and sprained his leg, I stayed with him until it healed. Then when the man =
hunters started the dogs=20

on our trail, we ran together until Young Black Buck=E2=80=99s weak leg cri=
ppled him again. The dogs=20

would have caught him, but I waited for them, and when they saw me I led th=
em off on my trail.=20

Young Black Buck escaped while I led the dogs a merry chase. I saved his li=
fe, and he rewards=20

me for it by lies=E2=80=94nothing but lies!=E2=80=9D  The commotion that fo=
llowed these words was great, and the=20

herd gazed from one speaker to the other.  =E2=80=9CI challenge you to deny=
 it!=E2=80=9D continued White Tail,=20

facing Young Black Buck. =E2=80=9CSee he cannot deny it! He knows it to be =
the truth!=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck,=20

indeed, looked guilty. His limbs were trembling, and his head drooping. For=
 once he had no ready=20

story to explain his lies.  =E2=80=9CTo punish you for it, Young Black Buck=
, I challenge you to a fight!=E2=80=9D went=20

on White Tail, now so enraged that he wanted to punish his rival.  It was t=
hen that Black Buck=20

interfered.  =E2=80=9CCease your quarreling over such petty things,=E2=80=
=9D he said. =E2=80=9CThere are greater things for=20

the herd to consider than this.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat can be greater than=
 a question of honor?=E2=80=9D interrupted White=20

Tail boldly. =E2=80=9CYour son has spread falsehoods about me, and I challe=
nge him to prove it by fighting.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CAnd I tell you to cease your quarreling,=E2=80=9D added Black Buck=
. =E2=80=9CYou=20

impurely. As a social system Islam is a complete failure: it has misunderst=
ood the relations of the=20

sexes, upon which the whole character of a nation's life hangs, and, by deg=
rading women, has=20

degraded each successive generation of their children down an increasing sc=
ale of infamy and=20

corruption, until it seems almost impossible to reach a lower level of vice=
.  The fatal spot in Islam is=20

the degradation of women. The true need your strength for a different kind =
of challenge. Know you=20

not what has happened?=E2=80=9D  White Tail looked mystified. Suddenly it o=
ccurred to him that he hadn=E2=80=99t=20

seen Father Buck or Mother Deer. They hadn=E2=80=99t come forth to greet hi=
m. Had anything serious=20

happened to them?  =E2=80=9CNo, I don=E2=80=99t know what has happened,=E2=
=80=9D White Tail admitted. =E2=80=9CI have been=20

away, and know nothing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen listen!=E2=80=9D replied Bl=
ack Buck. =E2=80=9COur leader has failed.=20


_
a nation's place in the ranks of civilisation is the position of its women.=
 When they are held in=20

reverence, when it is considered the most infamous of crimes to subject a w=
oman to dishonour,=20

and the highest distinction to protect her from wrong; when the family life=
 is real and strong, of=20

which the mother-wife is the heart; when each man's pulse beats loyal to wo=
manhood, then is a=20

nation great. When women are treated as playthings, toys, drudges, worth an=
ything only if they=20

have beauty to be enjoyed or strength to labour; when sex is considered the=
 chief thing in a=20

woman, and heart and mind are forgotten; when a man buys women for his plea=

White Tail stood dumbfounded. Father Buck had been disgraced! He had fallen=
 and missed his=20

footing! He had failed to cross the brook in a single jump! He was to be de=
posed as leader!  It=20

seemed incredible, and White Tail was on the point of saying so when he rem=
embered the words=20

of Father Buck, and his prediction that some day he would fail through old =
age and weakness. The=20

thing had happened then in his absence. White Tail was glad of that, for it=
