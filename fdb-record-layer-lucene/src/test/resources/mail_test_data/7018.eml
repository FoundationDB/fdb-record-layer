III  The clerk had handed the two men their permits back. They were allowed to pass through the gates.  In If he held up his hand before his face it was absolutely invisible.  In the haste of the first rush he had crashed through a mass of small shrubbery with which the bank of the stream was _
broad-shouldered, bull-necked, the typical self-educated peasant, with square jaw and flat head, 

with wide bony hands and spatulated fingers: and Chauvelin--the aristocrat turned demagogue, 

thin and frail-looking, bland of manner and suave of speech, with delicate hands and pale, almost 

ascetic face.  The one represented all that was most brutish and sensual in this fight of one caste 

against the other, the thirst for the other's blood, the human beast that has been brought to bay 

through wrongs perpetrated against it by others and has turned upon its oppressors, lashing out 

right and left with blind and lustful fury at the crowd of tyrants that had kept him in subjection for so 

long. Whilst Chauvelin was the personification of the spiritual side of this bloody Revolution--the 

spirit of cool and calculating reprisals that would demand an eye for an eye and see that it got two. 

The idealist who dreams of the righteousness of his own cause and the destruction of its enemies, 

but who leaves to others the accomplishment of all the carnage and the bloodshed which his 

idealism has demanded, and which his reason has appraised as necessary for the triumph of 

which he dreams. Chauvelin was the man of thought and Martin-Roget the man of action. With the 

one, revenge and reprisals were selfish desires, the avenging of wrongs done to himself or to his 

caste, hatred for those who had injured him or his kindred. The other had no personal feelings of 

hatred: he had no personal wrongs to avenge: his enemies were the enemies of his party, the 

erstwhile tyrants who in the past had oppressed an entire people. Every man, woman or child who 

was not satisfied with the present Reign of Terror, who plotted or planned for its overthrow, who 

was not ready to see husband, father, wife or child sacrificed for the ultimate triumph of the 

Revolution was in Chauvelin's sight a noxious creature, fit only to be trodden under heel and 

ground into subjection or annihilation as a danger to the State.  Martin-Roget was the 

personification of sans-culottism, of rough manners and foul speech--he chafed against the 

conventions which forced him to wear decent clothes and boots on his feet--he would gladly have 

seen every one go about the streets half-naked, unwashed, a living sign of that downward levelling 

of castes which he and his friends stood for, and for which they had fought and striven and 

committed every crime which human passions let loose could invent. Chauvelin, on the other 

hand, was one of those who wore fine linen and buckled shoes and whose hands were delicately 

washed and perfumed whilst they signed decrees which sent hundreds of women and children to 

a violent and cruel death.  The one trod in the paths of Danton: the other followed in the footsteps 

of Robespierre.   II  Together the two men mounted the outside staircase which leads up past the 

lodge of the concierge and through the clerk's office to the interior of the stronghold. Outside the 

monumental doors they had to wait a moment or two while the clerk examined their permits to 

enter.  "Will you come into my office with me?" asked Chauvelin of his companion; "I have a word 

or two to add to my report for the Paris courier to-night. I won't be long."  "You are still in sent his 

canoe ahead like an arrow, and Archie, who appreciated the situation, seconded the movement. 

"Stop!" exclaimed the strange Indian, in the Saulteaux tongue, but the Cree chief did not feel the 

duty of obedience strongly upon him just then.  On the contrary, he put forth all his strength, but 

quietly, for he remembered that Dan Davidson was behind.  As there was now no need for 

concealment, the pursuer uttered a shrill war-whoop which was immediately answered and 

repeated until the woods rang with the fiendish sound, while half-a-dozen canoes dashed out from 

the banks on either side, and sought to bar the river.  "Now, Arch-ee," said the Cree chief in a low 

voice, "paddle for your life and be a man!"  "I'll be two men, if you like, Oke," answered the boy, 



whose courage was of that type which experiences something almost like desperate glee in the 

presence of imminent danger.  The canoe, obedient to the double impulse and the power of the 

current, was soon out of hearing of the pursuers.  "O! if I only had a paddle I might help you," said 

Little Bill eagerly.  "Yes, an' bu'st your biler, or explode your lungs, or something o' that sort," said 

his brother.  "No, no, Little Bill; you sit there like a lord or an admiral, an' leave men like Oke an' 

me to do all the dirty work."  While he spoke thus flippantly it is but justice to say that Archie was 

never more anxiously in earnest in his life, and that he strained at his paddle with a degree of 

energy that made him, perhaps, more than equal to many an average man.  So that the canoe 

forged well ahead of the pursuers and finally got to a part of the river where three islets divided it 

into several channels, rendering further pursuit in the dark useless if not impossible.  Their 

comrades, however, were not so fortunate.  Left behind by the sudden spurt of his leader, 

Davidson and his companion exerted themselves to overtake him, but the canoes of the enemy, 

which were just too late to cut off the retreat of Okematan, were in time to intercept the second 

canoe.  In this emergency Dan swerved aside, hoping to get to the bank before the Saulteaux 

could discover his exact whereabouts.  His intentions were thwarted by the want of caution in his 

companion.  "Iss it to the land ye are going?" asked Fergus.  "Yes--it's our only chance," 

whispered Dan.  "It iss my opeenion--" murmured the Highlander.  "Hush!" ejaculated Dan.  But 

the caution came too late.  A listening Red-skin overheard the sounds, and, with a sudden dash 

was alongside of them.  He did not, however, know the vigour of the men with whom he had to 

deal.  While he was in the very midst of a triumphant war-whoop, Dan cut him over the head with 

the paddle so violently that the instrument became splinters, and the whoop ceased abruptly.  At 

the same time Fergus caught hold of the bow of the enemy's canoe with an iron grasp, and, giving 

it a heave that might have put Samson to shame, fairly overturned it.  "Ye can wet your whustle 

now--whatever," he muttered.  As he spoke, the canoe ran with extreme violence against the 

invisible bank.  At the same moment a random volley was fired from the canoes in rear.  Fear lest 

they should wound or kill a comrade probably caused them to send the whizzing 


_
Martin-Roget.  "Always," replied the other curtly.  Martin-Roget threw a quick, suspicious glance on 

his companion. Darkness and the broad brim of his sugar-loaf hat effectually concealed even the 

outlines of Chauvelin's face, and Martin-Roget fell to musing over one or two things which Carrier 

had blurted out awhile ago. The whole of France was overrun with spies these days--every one 

was under suspicion, every one had to be on his guard. Every word was overheard, every glance 

seen, every sign noted.  What was this man Chauvelin doing here in Nantes? What reports did he 

send up to Paris by special courier? He, flame revealed the position of the fugitives, and those 

who had reserved their fire took better aim.  "Take to the bush, Fergus!" cried Dan, as he grasped 

his gun and leaped into the shallow water.  The Highlander stooped to lay hold of his weapon, 

which lay in the bow of the canoe, just as another volley was fired.  The act was the means of 

saving his life, for at least half-a-dozen bullets whizzed close over his head.  Before he could 

recover himself a strong hand grasped his neck and flung him backwards.  Probably a desperate 

hand-to-hand fight would have ensued, for Fergus McKay had much of the bone, muscle, 


_
ceased to count was nevertheless in constant touch with that awful Committee of Public Safety 

which was wont to strike at all times and unexpectedly in the dark. Martin-Roget shivered beneath 

his mantle. For the first time since his schemes of vengeance had wholly absorbed his mind he 

regretted the freedom and safety which he had enjoyed in England, and he marvelled if the 

miserable game which he was playing would be worth the winning in the end. Nevertheless he had 

followed Chauvelin without comment. The man appeared to exercise a fascination over him--a 

sinew, that is characteristic of his race, but a blow from an unseen weapon stunned him, and when 

his senses returned he found himself bound hand and foot lying in the bottom of a canoe.  He 

could tell from its motion, that it was descending the river.  Meanwhile Dan Davidson, under the 

impression that his comrade was also seeking safety in the bush, did his best to advance in 

circumstances of which he had never yet had experience, for, if the night was dark on the open 

bosom of the river, it presented the blackness of Erebus in the forest.  Dan literally
