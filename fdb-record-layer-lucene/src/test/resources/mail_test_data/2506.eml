an a pair of such rifles in an expedition in a wild country, as they would =
require more care in a damp climate than the imposing edifices, with fresh =

the fat will not melt thoroughly, as it will be combined with the water con=
tained in the body. The fat=20

should be separated as well as possible from the meat; it should then be hu=
ng in long strips upon=20

a line and exposed in the sun to dry; when nearly dried, it should be cut i=
nto pieces of about two=20

inches in length, and placed in a large vessel over a brisk fire, and kept =
constantly stirred. As the=20

fat boils out from the meat, the residue should be taken out with a pierced=
 ladle; this, when cool,=20

should be carefully preserved in leathern bags. This is called by the Arabs=
 "reveet," a supply of=20

which is most valuable, as a quantity can be served out to each man during =
a long march when=20

there is no time to halt; it can be eaten without bread, and it is extremel=
y nourishing. With a good=20

supply of reveet in store, the traveller need not be nervous about his dinn=
er. Dried meat should=20

also be kept in large quantities; the best is that of the giraffe and hippo=
potamus, but there is some=20

care required in preparing the first quality. It should be cut from portion=
s of the animals as free as=20

possible from sinews, and should be arranged in long thin strips of the dia=
meter of about an inch=20

and a quarter; these ribbon-like morsels should be hung in the shade. When =
nearly dry, they=20

should be taken down, and laid upon a flat rock, upon which they should be =
well beaten with a=20

stone, or club of hard wood; this breaks the fibre; after which they should=
 be hung up and=20

thoroughly dried, care being taken that the flesh is not exposed to the sun=
. If many flies are=20

present, the flesh should be protected by the smoke of fires lighted to win=
dward.  When meat is=20

thus carefully prepared, it can be used in various ways, and is exceedingly=
 palatable; if pounded=20

into small pieces like coarse sawdust, it forms an admirable material for c=
urry and rice. The Arabs=20

make a first-class dish of melach, by mixing a quantity of pounded dried me=
at with a thick porridge=20

of dhurra meal, floating in a soup of barmian (waker), with onions, salt, a=
nd red peppers; this is an=20

admirable thing if the party is pressed for time (if not too hot, as a larg=
e quantity can be eaten with=20

great expedition. As the Arabs are nomadic, they have a few simple but effe=
ctive arrangements for=20

food during the journey. For a fortnight preparatory to an expedition, the =
women are busily=20

engaged in manufacturing a supply of abrey. This is made in several methods=
: there is the sour,=20

and the sweet abrey; the former is made of highly-fermented dhurra paste th=
at has turned=20

intensely acid; this is formed into thin wafers, about sixteen inches in di=
ameter, upon the doka or=20

hearth, and dried in the sun until the abrey has become perfectly crisp; th=
e wafers are then broken=20

up with the hands, and packed in bags. There is no drink more refreshing th=
an water poured over=20

a handful of sour abrey, and allowed to stand for half an hour; it becomes =
pleasantly acid, and is=20

superior to lemonade. The residue is eaten by the Arabs: thus the abrey sup=
plies both meat and=20

drink. The finest quality of sweet abrey is a very delicate affair; the flo=
ur of dhurra must be well=20

sifted; it is then mixed with milk instead of water, and, without fermentin=
g, it is formed into thin=20

wafers similar to those eaten with ice-creams in this country, but extremel=
y large; these are dried=20

in the sun, and crushed like the sour abrey; they will keep for months if k=
ept dry in a leathern bag.=20

A handful of sweet abrey steeped in a bowl of hot milk, with a little honey=
, is a luxurious breakfast;=20

nothing can be more delicious, and it can be prepared in a few minutes duri=
ng the short halt upon=20

a journey. With a good supply of abrey and dried meat, the commissariat arr=
angements are=20

wonderfully simplified, and a party can march a great distance without much=
 heavy baggage to=20

impede their movements.  The flesh that is the least adapted for drying is =
that of the buffalo (Bos=20

Caffer), which is exceedingly tough and coarse. There are two species of th=
e Bos Caffer in=20

Abyssinia and Central Africa, which, similar in general appearance, differ =
in the horns; that which=20



resembles the true Bos Caffer of South Africa has very massive convex horns=
 that unite in front,=20

and completely cover the forehead as with a shield; the other variety has m=
assive, but perfectly=20

flat horns of great breadth, that do not quite unite over the os frontis, a=
lthough nearly so; the=20

flatness of the horns continues in a rough surface, somewhat resembling the=
 bark of a tree, for=20

about twelve inches; the horns then brazen-headed statues, would have stood=
 up and increased=20

the din of their progress by shouting continuously to clear the crowded tho=
roughfares.  As it was,=20

they had it all to themselves.  Sometimes the corner of a window-blind was =
hastily lifted, showing=20

that some wakeful one had curiosity enough to leap out of bed to see them p=
ass.  Here and there=20

a policeman paused, and followed them with his eye as long as the tail of s=
parks from the furnace=20

was visible.  Occasionally a belated toper stopped in his staggering progre=
ss to gaze at them, with=20

an idiotical assumption of seriousness and demand, "Wash ey maki'n sh' a 'o=
rrible row for?"  Now=20

and then a cat, with exploratory tendencies, put up its back and greeted th=
em with a glare and a=20

fuff, or a shut-out cur gave them a yelping salute; but the great mass of t=
he London population let=20

them go by without notice, as they would have treated any other passing thu=
nderbolt with which=20

they had nothing to do.  And yet they _had_ something to do with that engin=
e, or, rather, it had to=20

do with them.  But for it, and the rest of the Red Brigade, London would ha=
ve long ago been in=20

ashes.  It is only by unremitting vigilance and incessant action that the L=
ondon fires can be kept=20

within bounds. There are nearly two thousand fires in the year in the metro=
polis, and the heroic=20

little army which keeps these in check numbers only three hundred and seven=
ty-eight men.  That=20

this force is much too small for the work to be done is proved by the fact,=
 that the same men have=20

sometimes to turn out three, four or five times in a night, to work of the =
most trying and dangerous=20

nature.  There is no occupation in which the lives of the men employed are =
so frequently risked,=20

and their physical endurance so severely tried, as that of a London fireman=
.  As there are, on the=20

average, five fires every night all the year round, it follows that he is l=
iable to be called out several=20

times every night; and, in point of fact, this actually takes place very of=
ten.  Sometimes he has=20

barely returned from a fire, and put off his drenched garments, when he rec=
eives another "call,"=20

and is obliged to put them on again, and go forth weary--it may be fasting-=
-to engage in another=20

skirmish with the flames.  In all weathers and at all seasons--hot or cold,=
 wet or dry--he must turn=20

out at a moment's notice, to find himself, almost before he is well awake, =
in the midst of stifling=20

smoke, obliged to face and to endure the power of roasting flames, to stand=
 under cataracts of=20

water, beside tottering walls and gables, or to plunge through smoke and fl=
ames, in order to=20

rescue human lives.  Liability to be called _occasionally_ to the exercise =
of such courage and=20

endurance is severe enough; it is what every soldier is liable to in time o=
f war, and the lifeboat-

man in times of storm; but to be liable to such calls several times every d=
ay and night all round the=20

year is hard indeed, and proves that the Red Brigade, although almost perfe=
ct in its organisation=20

and heroic in its elements, is far too small.  Paris has about seven hundre=
d fires a year; New York=20

somewhere about three hundred; yet these cities have a far larger body of f=
iremen than London,=20

which with little short of two thousand fires a year, does her work of exti=
nction with only three=20

hundred and seventy-eight men!  She succeeds because every man in the littl=
e army is a hero, not=20

one whit behind the Spartans of old.  The London fireman, Ford, who, in 187=
1, at one great fire=20

rescued six lives from the flames, and perished in accomplishing the noble =
deed, is a sample of=20

the rest.  All the men of the Brigade are picked men--picked from among the=
 strapping and=20



youthful tars of the navy, because such men are accustomed to strict discip=
line; to being "turned=20

out" at all hours and in all weathers, and to climb with cool heads in tryi=
ng circumstances, besides=20

being, as a class, pre-eminently noted for daring anything and sticking at =
nothing. Such men are=20

sure to do their work well, however hard; to do it without complaining, and=
 to die, if need be, in the=20

doing of it.  But ought they to be asked to sacrifice so much?  Surely Lond=
oners would do well to=20

make that complaint, which the men will _never_ make, and insist on the for=
ce being increased,=20

not only for the sake of the men, but also for the sake of themselves; for,=
 although there _are_=20

three hundred and seventy-eight heroes who hold the fiery foe so well in ch=
eck, there are limits to=20

heroic powers of action, and it stands to reason that double the number=20


_
convex species. Buffaloes are very dangerous and determined animals; but, a=
lthough more=20

accidents occur in hunting these than any other variety of game, I cannot a=
dmit that they are such=20

formidable opponents as the elephant and black rhinoceros; they are so much=
 more numerous=20

than the latter, that they are more frequently encountered: hence the casua=
lties.  A buffalo can=20

always be killed with a No. 10 rifle and six drachms of powder when chargin=
g, if the hunter will=20

only wait coolly until it is so close that he cannot miss the forehead; but=
 the same rifle will fail=20

against an African elephant, or a black rhinoceros, as the horns of the lat=
ter animal effectually=20

protect the brain from a front shot. I have killed some hundreds of buffalo=
es, and, although in=20

many cases they have been unpleasantly near, the rifle has always won the d=
ay. There cannot be=20

a more convenient size than  But we are wandering from our point.  The engi=
ne has been tearing=20

all this time at racing speed along the Bayswater Road.  It turns sharp rou=
nd a corner near Notting=20

Hill Gate--so sharp that the feat is performed on the two off wheels, and d=
raws from Bob Clazie=20

the quiet remark, "Pretty nigh on our beam-ends that time, Joe."  A light i=
s now seen glaring in the=20

sky over the house-tops; another moment, and the engine dashes into Ladbrok=
e Square, where a=20

splendid mansion is in a blaze, with the flames spouting from the windows o=
f the second floor.=20

The engine pulls up with a crash; the reeking horses are removed and led as=
ide.  "Look alive,=20

lads!" is the only word uttered, and the helmeted heroes, knowing their wor=
k well, go into action=20

with that cool promptitude which is more than half the battle in attacking =
the most desperate odds=20

or the fiercest foe.    CHAPTER TWO.  The=20
