as eternity has neither=20

beginning nor end, the more or less prolonged duration of some particular f=
orm passes, as it were,=20

like an instantaneous flash of lightning. Before we have the time to realiz=
e that we have seen it, it=20

is gone and passed for ever; hence even our astral bodies, pure ether, are =
but illusions of matter=20

so long as they retain their terrestrial outline. The latter changes, says =
the Buddhist, according to=20

the merits or demerits of the person during his lifetime, and this is metem=
psychosis. When the=20

spiritual Entity breaks loose for ever from every particle of matter, then =
only it enters upon the=20

eternal and unchangeable Nirvana. He exists in Spirit, in nothing; as a for=
m, a shape, a=20

semblance, he is completely annihilated, and thus will die no more, for Spi=
rit alone is no Maya, but=20

the only Reality in an illusionary universe of ever-passing forms.       It=
 is upon this Buddhist=20

doctrine that the Pythagoreans grounded     the principal tenets of their p=
hilosophy. "Can that Spirit=20

which     gives life and motion, and partakes of the nature of light, be   =
  reduced to nonentity?"=20

they ask. "Can that sensitive Spirit in     brutes which exercises memory, =
one of the rational=20

faculties, die     and become nothing?" And Whitelock Bulstrode in his able=
 defence     of=20

Pythagoras expounds this doctrine by adding:      "If you say they [the bru=
tes] breathe their Spirits=20

into the air,     and there vanish, that is all that I contend for. The air=
 indeed     is the proper place=20

to receive them, being according to Laertius     full of souls; and accordi=
ng to Epicurus full of=20

atoms, the     principles of all things; for even this place wherein we wal=
k and     birds fly has so=20

much of a spiritual nature that it is invisible,     and therefore may well=
 be the receiver of forms,=20

since the forms     of all bodies are so; we can only see and hear its effe=
cts; the     air itself is too=20

fine and above the capacity of the age. What     then is the ether in the r=
egion above, and what are=20

the influences     of forms that descend from thence?" The _Spirits_ of cre=
atures,     the=20

Pythagoreans hold, who are emanations of the most sublimated     portions o=
f ether--emanations,=20

_breaths, but not forms_. Ether is     corruptible--all philosophers agree =
in that;--and what is=20

incorruptible _is so far from being annihilated_ when it gets rid     of th=
e _form_ that it lays a good=20

claim to _immortality_.      "But what is that which has no body, no _form_=
; which is=20

imponderable, invisible, and indivisible--that which exists, and     yet _i=
s not_?" ask the Buddhists.=20

"It is Nirvana," is the answer.     It is _nothing_--not a region, but rath=
er a state.(719)      SECTION=20

XLVII. THE SECRET BOOKS OF "LAM-RIN" AND DZYAN.   The _Book of Dzyan_--from=
 the=20

Sanskrit word "Dhyan" (mystic meditation)--is the first volume of the Comme=
ntaries upon the=20

seven secret folios of Kiu- te, and a Glossary of the public works of the s=
ame name. Thirty-five=20

volumes of after a reconnoissance along the entire line, in company with Ma=
rshal de Grammont,=20

he had returned and seated himself before a table, with his officers around=
 him. He questioned=20

them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain, but nothing posit=
ive had been learned.=20

The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone ou=
t of existence.=20

Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening, as when he h=
as completely=20

disappeared. The prince was, therefore, contrary to his custom, gloomy and =
anxious, when an=20

officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished t=
o see him.  The=20

Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went ou=
t. The prince=20

followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door; no one ventur=
ed to speak, for fear of=20



disturbing him.  Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard. The prince leap=
ed to his feet,=20

extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound, there was no mis=
taking it--it was the=20

noise of cannon. Every one stood up.  At that moment the door opened.  "Mon=
seigneur," said=20

Marshal de Grammont, with a radiant face, "will your highness permit my son=
, Count de Guiche,=20

and his traveling companion, Viscount de Bragelonne, to come in and give ne=
ws of the enemy,=20

whom they have found while we were looking for him?"  "What!" eagerly repli=
ed the prince, "will I=20

permit? I not only permit, I desire; let them come in."  The marshal introd=
uced the two young men=20

and placed them face to face with the prince.  "Speak, gentlemen," said the=
 prince, saluting them;=20

"first speak; we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments. The m=
ost urgent thing now is=20

to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing."  It fell naturally to th=
e Count de Guiche to make=20

reply; not only was he the elder, but he had been presented to the prince b=
y his father. Besides,=20

he had long known the prince, whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time. =
He therefore narrated to=20

the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingarbe.  Meanwhile Raoul =
closely observed the=20

young general, already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy, Fribourg, a=
nd Nordlingen.  Louis=20

de Bourbon, Prince de Conde, who, since the death of his father, Henri de B=
ourbon, was called, in=20

accordance with the custom of that period, Monsieur le Prince, was a young =
man, not more than=20

twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, with the eye of an eagle--agl' occhi =
grifani, as Dante says--

aquiline nose, long, waving hair, of medium height, well formed, possessed =
of all the qualities=20

essential to the successful soldier--that is to say, the rapid glance, quic=
k decision, fabulous=20

courage. At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind, =
so that in addition=20

to the revolution he had made in war, by his new contributions to its metho=
ds, he had also made a=20

revolution at Paris, among the young noblemen of the court, whose natural c=
hief he was and who,=20

in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court, modeled after =
Bassompierre, Bellegarde=20

and the Duke d'Angouleme, were called the petits-maitres.  At the first wor=
ds of the Count de=20

Guiche, the prince, having in mind the direction whence came the sound of c=
annon, had=20

understood everything. The=20


_
found in the possession of the Tibetan Gelugpa Lamas, in the library of any=
 monastery; and also=20

fourteen books of Commentaries and Annotations on the same by the initiated=
 Teachers.  Strictly=20

speaking, those thirty-five books ought to be termed "The Popularised Versi=
on" of the Secret=20

Doctrine, full of myths, blinds, and errors; the fourteen volumes of _Comme=
ntaries_, on the other=20

hand--with their translations, annotations, and an ample glossary of Occult=
 terms, worked out from=20

one small archaic folio, the _Book of the Secret Wisdom of the World_(720)-=
-contain a digest of all=20

the Occult Sciences. These, it appears, are kept secret and apart, in the c=
harge of the Teshu=20

Lama of Tji-gad-je. The Books of Kiu-te are comparatively modern, having be=
en edited within the=20

last millennium, whereas, the earliest volumes of the _Commentaries_ are of=
 untold antiquity,=20

some fragments of the original cylinders having been preserved. With the ex=
ception that they=20

explain and correct some of the too fabulous, and to every appearance, gros=
sly- exaggerated=20

accounts in the Books of Kiu-te(721)--properly so-called--the _Commentaries=
_ have little to do=20

with these. They stand in relation to them as the Chaldaeo-Jewish _Kabalah_=
 stands to the=20

Mosaic Books. In the work known as the _Avatumsaka Sutra_, in section: "The=
 Supreme Atman=20

[Soul] as manifested in the character of the Arhats and doubtless, of secur=
ing possession of that=20

town and separating from France the army of France. But in what force was t=
he enemy? Was it a=20

corps sent out to make a diversion? Was it an entire army? To this question=
 De Guiche could not=20

respond.  Now, as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence, =
it was these to which=20

the prince had especially desired an answer, exact, precise, positive.  Rao=
ul conquered the very=20

natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince:  "My=
 lord," he said, "will you=20

permit me to hazard a few words on that subject, which will perhaps relieve=
 you of your=20

uncertainty?"  The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a s=
ingle glance; he=20

smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old.  "Certai=
nly, monsieur, speak," he=20

said, softening his stern, accented tones, as if he were speaking to a woma=
n.  "My lord," said=20

Raoul, blushing, "might examine the Spanish prisoner."  "Have you a Spanish=
 prisoner?" cried the=20

prince.  "Yes, my lord."  "Ah, that is true," said De Guiche; "I had forgot=
ten it."  "That is easily=20

understood; it was you who took him, count," said Raoul, smiling.  The old =
marshal turned toward=20

the viscount, grateful for that praise of his son, whilst the prince exclai=
med:  "The young man is=20

right; let the prisoner be brought in."  Meanwhile the prince took De Guich=
e aside and=20


_
it is stated that:       Because from the beginning all sentient creatures =
have confused     the truth=20

and embraced the false, therefore there came into     existence a hidden kn=
owledge called Alaya=20

Vijnana.   "Who is in possession of the true knowledge?" is asked. "The gre=
at Teachers of the=20

Snowy Mountain," is the response.  These "great Teachers" have been known t=
o live in the=20

"Snowy Range" of the Himalayas for countless ages. To deny in the face of m=
illions of Hindus the=20

existence of their great Gurus, living in the Ashrams scattered all over th=
e Trans- or the Cis-

Himalayan slopes is to make oneself ridiculous in their eyes. When the Budd=
hist Saviour appeared=20

in India, their Ashrams--for it is rarely that these great Men are found in=
 Lamaseries, unless on a=20

short visit--were on the spots they now occupy, and that even before the Br=
ahmans themselves=20

came from Central Asia to settle on the Indus. And before that more than on=
e Aryan Dvija of fame=20

and historical renown had sat at their feet, had been taken and who this yo=
ung man was.=20

"Monsieur," said the prince, turning toward Raoul, "I know that you have a =
letter from my sister,=20

Madame de Longueville; but I see that you have preferred commending yoursel=
f to me by giving=20

me good counsel."  "My lord," said Raoul, coloring up, "I did not wish to i=
nterrupt your highness in=20

a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the coun=
t. But here is the=20

letter."  "Very well," said the prince; "give it to me later. Here is the p=
risoner; let us attend to what is=20

most pressing."  The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sol=
d their blood to=20

whoever would buy, and grew old in stratagems and spoils. Since he had been=
 taken he had not=20

uttered a word, so that it was not known to what country he belonged. The p=
rince looked at him=20

with unspeakable distrust.  "Of what country are you?" asked the prince.  T=
he prisoner muttered a=20

few words in a foreign tongue.  "Ah! ah! it seems that he is a Spaniard. Do=
 you speak Spanish,=20
