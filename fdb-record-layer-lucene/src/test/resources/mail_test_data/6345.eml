the school reached its zenith, it began to decline on account of bad feelin=

a divided management.  [Footnote 1: Henson, _Life of Josiah Henson_, pp. 73=

facts concerning the manual labor system of education, the student of educa=
tion sees that it was=20

not generally successful. This may be accounted for in various ways. One mi=
ght say that colored=20

people were not desired in the higher pursuits of labor and that their prep=
aration for such=20

vocations never received the support of the rank and file of the Negroes of=
 the North. They saw=20

then, as they often do now, the seeming impracticability of preparing thems=
elves for occupations=20

which they apparently had no chance to follow. Moreover, bright freedmen we=
re not at first=20

attracted to mechanical occupations. Ambitious Negroes who triumphed over s=
lavery and made=20

their way to the North for educational advantages hoped to enter the higher=
 walks of life. Only a=20

few of the race had the foresight of the advocates of industrial training. =
The majority of the=20

enlightened class desired that they be no longer considered as "persons occ=

said. =E2=80=9CBut I expected no less from Prince Ivan Ivanovitch Pojarsky.=
=E2=80=9D  Ivan had entered the house of=20

Petrovitch that day a reckless, frivolous youth, capable indeed of nobler t=
hings, but absorbed in=20

the pursuit of pleasure and in the petty, selfish troubles it entailed upon=
 him. He left the presence=20

of his aged friend with the heart, the purpose, the thoughts of a man. He f=
elt the ennobling glow of=20

patriotic fervour. His country was in jeopardy, and he was ready to give hi=
s life for it. He thought,=20

as he turned his steps homewards,--  =E2=80=9CThis is enough to make my bra=

Furthermore, bitterly as some white men hated slavery, and deeply as they s=
eemingly=20

sympathized with the oppressed, they were loath to support a policy which t=
hey believed was fatal=20

to their economic interests.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Minutes and Proceedings of t=

Convention_, etc., p. 25.]  [Footnote 2: _The Fifth Report of the American =
Antislavery Society_, p.=20

failure of the new=20

educational policy was that the managers of the manual labor schools made t=
he mistakes often=20

committed by promoters of industrial education of our day. At first they pr=
oceeded on the=20

presumption that one could obtain a classical education while learning a tr=

time earn sufficient to support himself at school. Some of the managers of =
industrial schools have=20
