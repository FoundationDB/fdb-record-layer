surely larger than the Peloponnesus, he would not have been       persecute=

death by the fanatical mob. Had that       other rabble which was raised ag=

understood what the       mysterious Sage of Crotona meant by giving out hi=
s remembrance of=20

having been the "Son of Mercury"--God of the Secret Wisdom--he would       =
not have been forced=20

to fly for his life; nor would Socrates have       been put to death, had h=
e kept secret the revelations=20

of his divine       Daimon. He knew how little his century--save those init=
iated--would=20

understand his meaning, had he given out all he knew of the moon.       Thu=
s he limited his=20

statement to an allegory, which is now proven to       have been more scien=

out any atmosphere outside=20

such profound valleys; this,       disregarding the revelation full of mean=

be so of necessity, if there is any atmosphere on our bright Selene       a=

do well to ponder over=20

these words. No doubt that       doctrines and secret teachings had they be=

 fol. 1526, quoted in Myer's=20

_Qabbalah_, p. 102.     86 _New-Platonism and Alchemy_, p. 6.     87 i.  Th=
e three friends drew=20

near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground, bathed in a pool o=
f blood. It was=20

evident that he had attempted to regain his bed, but had not had sufficient=
 strength to do so.=20

Athos, who imagined that he saw him move, was the first to go up to him.  "=
Well?" inquired=20

D'Artagnan.  "Well, if he is dead," said Athos, "he has not been so long, f=
or he is still warm. But no,=20

his heart is beating. Ho, there, my friend!"  The wounded man heaved a sigh=
. D'Artagnan took=20

some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face. The man op=
ened his eyes, made=20

an effort to raise his head, and fell back again. The wound was in the top =
of his skull and blood=20

was flawing copiously.  Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied i=
t to the gash. Again=20

the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strange=
rs, who appeared=20

to pity him.  "You are among friends," said Athos, in English; "so cheer up=
, and tell us, if you have=20

the strength to do so, what has happened?"  "The king," muttered the wounde=
d man, "the king is a=20

prisoner."  "You have seen him?" asked Aramis, in the same language.  The m=
an made no reply.=20

"Make your mind easy," resumed Athos, "we are all faithful servants of his =
majesty."  "Is what you=20

tell me true?" asked the wounded man.  "On our honor as gentlemen."  "Then =
I may tell you all. I=20

am brother to Parry, his majesty's lackey."  Athos and Aramis remembered th=
at this was the name=20

by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the =
king's tent.  "We=20



know him," said Athos, "he never left the king."  "Yes, that is he. Well, h=
e thought of me, when he=20

saw the king was taken, and as they were passing before the house he begged=
 in the king's name=20

that they would stop, as the king was hungry. They brought him into this ro=
om and placed=20

sentinels at the doors and windows. Parry knew this room, as he had often b=
een to see me when=20

the king was at Newcastle. He knew that there was a trap-door communicating=
 with a cellar, from=20

which one could get into the orchard. He made a sign, which I understood, b=
ut the king's guards=20

must have noticed it and held themselves on guard. I went out as if to fetc=
h wood, passed through=20

the subterranean passage into the cellar, and whilst Parry was gently bolti=
ng the door, pushed up=20

the board and beckoned to the king to follow me. Alas! he would not. But Pa=
rry clasped his hands=20

and implored him, and at last he agreed. I went on first, fortunately. The =
king was a few steps=20

behind me, when suddenly I saw something rise=20

88 lxiv. 10.     89 The _key_ is shown to be "in the source of measures ori=
ginating the       British=20

inch and the ancient cubit" as the author tries to prove.     90 The word a=
s a plural might have=20

better solved the mystery. God is       _ever-present_; if he were _ever-ac=
tive_ he could no longer=20

be an       infinite God--nor ever-present in his limitation.     91 The au=
thor is evidently a Mason of=20

the way of thinking of General       Pike. So long as the American and Engl=
ish Masons will reject=20

the       "Creative Principle" of the "Grand Orient" of France they will   =
    remain in the dark.     92=20

_Source of Measures_, pp. 308, 309.     93 In his _Pneumatologie_, in Vol. =
iv., pp. 105-112, the=20

Marquis de       Mirville claims the knowledge of the heliocentric system--=
earlier       than Galileo--

for Pope Urban VIII. The author goes further. He tries       to show that f=
amous Pope, not as the=20

persecutor but as one       persecuted by Galileo, and calumniated by the F=
lorentine Astronomer=20

into the bargain. If so, so much the worse for the Latin Church,       sinc=
e her Popes, knowing of it,=20

still preserved silence upon this       most important fact, either to scre=
en Joshua or their own=20

infallibility. One can understand well that the _Bible_ having been       s=
o exalted over all the other=20

systems, and its alleged monotheism    cry out to warn the king, but that v=
ery moment I felt a blow=20

as if the house was falling on my head, and fell insensible. When I came to=
 myself again, I was=20

stretched in the same place. I dragged myself as far as the yard. The king =
and his escort were no=20

longer there. I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place=
; then my strength gave=20

out and I fainted again."  "And now how are you feeling?"  "Very ill," repl=
ied the wounded man.=20

"Can we do anything for you?" asked Athos.  "Help to put me on the bed; I t=
hink I shall feel better=20

there."  "Have you any one to depend on for assistance?"  "My wife is at Du=
rham and may return=20

at any moment. But you--is there nothing that you want?"  "We came here wit=
h the intention of=20

asking for something to eat."  "Alas, they have taken everything; there isn=
't a morsel of bread in=20

the house."  "You hear, D'Artagnan?" said Athos; "we shall have to look els=
ewhere for our dinner."=20

"It is all one to me now," said D'Artagnan; "I am no longer hungry."  "Fait=
h! neither am I," said=20

Porthos.  They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the w=
ound. In the service=20

of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and b=
andages that he had=20

become something of a surgeon.  In the meantime the fugitives had returned =
to the first room,=20

where they took counsel together.=20

to keep quiet over its symbolism, thus allowing all its blunders to       b=

_Op. cit._, App. vii. p. 296. The writer feels happy to find this       fac=
t now mathematically=20

demonstrated. When it was stated in _Isis       Unveiled_ that Jehovah and =
Saturn were one and=20

the same with Adam       Kadmon, Cain, Adam and Eve, Abel, Seth, etc., and =
that all were=20

convertible symbols in the Secret Doctrine (see Vol. ii. pp. 446,       448=
, 464 _et seq._); that they=20

answered, in short, to secret       numerals and stood for escort have gone=
 this way; we had better=20

take the opposite direction, eh?"  Athos did not reply; he reflected.  "Yes=
," said Porthos, "let us=20

take the opposite direction; if we follow the escort we shall find everythi=
ng devoured and die of=20

hunger. What a confounded country this England is! This is the first time I=
 have gone without my=20

dinner for ten years, and it is generally my best meal."  "What do you thin=
k, D'Artagnan?" asked=20

Athos. "Do you agree with Aramis?"  "Not at all," said D'Artagnan; "I am pr=
ecisely of the contrary=20

opinion."  "What! you would=20


_
other doctrines--the author's statements remained unnoticed. _Isis_       h=
ad failed to appear under=20

a scientific form, and by giving too       much, in fact, gave very little =
to satisfy the enquirer. But=20

now, if       mathematics and geometry, besides the evidence of the _Bible_=
 and       _Kabalah_=20

are good for anything, the public must find itself       satisfied. No full=
er, more scientifically given=20

proof can be found       to show that Cain is the transformation of an Eloh=
im (the Sephira=20

Binah) into Jah-Veh (or God-Eve) androgyne, and that Seth is the       Jeho=
vah male, than in the=20

combined discoveries of Seyffarth, Knight,       etc., and finally in Mr. R=
alston Skinner's most=20

erudite work. The       further relations of these personifications of the =
 "No, I would join the escort."=20

Athos's eyes shone with joy.  "Join the escort!" cried Aramis.  "Let D'Arta=
gnan speak," said Athos;=20

"you know he always has wise advice to give."  "Clearly," said D'Artagnan, =
"we must go where=20

they will not look for us. Now, they will be far from looking for us among =
the Puritans; therefore,=20

with the Puritans we must go."  "Good, my friend, good!" said Athos. "It is=
 excellent advice. I was=20

about to give it when you anticipated me."  "That, then, is your opinion?" =
asked Aramis.  "Yes.=20

They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at th=
e ports; meanwhile we=20

shall reach London with the king. Once in London we shall be hard to find--=
without considering,"=20

continued Athos, throwing a glance at Aramis, "the chances that=20


_
races, in their gradual development, will be given later on in the       te=
xt.     95 The writings extant=20

in olden times often personified Wisdom as an       emanation and associate=
 of the Creator. Thus=20

we have the Hindu       Buddha, the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, =
the Hermes of=20

Greece; also the female divinities, Neitha, Metis, Athena, and the       Gn=
ostic potency Achamoth=20

or Sophia. The Samaritan _Pentateuch_       denominated the _Book of Genesi=
s_, Akamouth, or=20

Wisdom, and two       remnants of old treatises, the _Wisdom of Solomon_ an=
d the _Wisdom=20

of Jesus_, relate to the same matters. The _Book of Mashalim_--the       _D=
iscourses_ or=20

_Proverbs_ of Solomon--thus personifies Wisdom as the       auxiliary of th=
e Creator. In the Secret=20

Wisdom of the East that       auxiliary is found way."  "Yes," said Aramis,=
 "I understand."  "I,=20

however, do not understand," said Porthos. "But no matter; since it is at t=
he same time the opinion=20

of D'Artagnan and of Athos, it must be the best."  "But," said Aramis, "sha=
ll we not be suspected=20

by Colonel Harrison?"  "Egad!" cried D'Artagnan, "he's just the man I count=
 upon. Colonel Harrison=20

is one of our friends. We have met him twice at General Cromwell's. He know=
s that we were sent=20

from France by Monsieur Mazarin; he will consider us as brothers. Besides, =
is he not a butcher's=20

son? Well, then, Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow=
 of the fist, and I=20

how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns. That will insure his conf=
idence."  Athos smiled.=20

"You are the best companion that I know, D'Artagnan," he said, offering his=
 hand to the Gascon;=20

"and I am=20
