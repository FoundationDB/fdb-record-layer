"I believe you told me that the stand belonged to some one else."  "Yes, si=
r; I am only tending it in=20

his sickness; but he is getting better, and when he gets about again, I sha=
ll be thrown out of=20

business."  "But you don't look like one who would remain idle long."  "No,=
 sir; I shall be certain to=20

find something to do, if it is only blacking boots."  "Have you ever been i=
n that business?"  "I've=20

tried about everything," said Paul, laughing.  "I suppose you wouldn't enjo=
y boot-blacking much?"=20

"No, sir; but I would rather do that than be earning nothing."  "You are qu=
ite right there, and I am=20

glad you have no false shame in the matter. There are plenty who have. For =
instance, a stout,=20

broad-shouldered young fellow applied to me thus morning for a clerkship. H=
e said he had come=20

to the city in search of employment, and had nearly expended all his money =
without finding=20

anything to do. I told him I couldn't give him a clerkship, but was in want=
 of a porter. I offered him=20

the place at two dollars per day. He drew back, and said he should not be w=
illing to accept a=20

porter's place."  "He was very foolish," said Paul.  "So I thought. I told =
him that if such were his=20

feelings, I could not help him. Perhaps he may regret his refusal, when he =
is reduced to his last=20

penny. By the way, whenever you have to give up your stand, you may come to=
 me, and I will see=20

what I can do for you."  "Thank you, sir."  "And now, about these shirts; I=
 believe I agreed to pay a=20

dollar and a quarter each."  "Yes, sir."  "As they are of extra size, I thi=
nk I ought to pay twelve=20

shillings, instead of ten."  "My mother thinks herself well paid at ten shi=
llings."  "There must be a=20

great deal of work about one. Twelve shillings are none too much," and Mr. =
Preston placed nine=20

dollars in Paul's hand.  "Thank you," said Paul, gratefully. "My mother wil=
l consider herself very=20

lucky."  When Mrs. Hoffman received from Paul a dollar and a half more than=
 she anticipated, she=20

felt in unusually good spirits. She had regretted the loss of her former po=
orly paid work, but it=20

appeared that her seeming misfortune had only prepared the way for greater =
prosperity. The=20

trouble was that it would not last. Still, it would tide over the dull time=
, and when this job was over,=20

she might be able to resume her old employment. At any rate, while the futu=
re seemed uncertain,=20

she did not feel like increasing her expenditures on account of her increas=
ed earnings, but laid=20

carefully away three-quarters of her receipts to use hereafter in case of n=
eed.  Meanwhile, Paul=20

continued to take care of George Barry's business. He had been obliged to r=
enew the stock, his=20

large sales having materially reduced it. Twice a week he went up to see hi=
s principal to report=20

sales. George Barry could not conceal the surprise he felt at Paul's succes=
s.  "I never thought you=20

would do so well," he said. "You beat me."  "I suppose it's with woods, whi=
ch here and there jutted=20

out into it, forming islands and peninsulas.  The flat-roofed town straggle=
d along three flat and=20

sandy streets; the little plaza, planted with mameyes and paraiso trees, se=
rved as a lounging-

place by day, by night a caravanserai for negroes; in time of rain the stre=
ets were turned to=20

streams, and poured their water into the plaza, which became a lake.  At th=
e west corner of the=20

square was situated Cardozo=E2=80=99s store, the chief emporium, mart, and =
meeting-place (after the=20

barber=E2=80=99s and the chemist=E2=80=99s) of the whole town.  Two languid=
 and yellow, hermaphroditic young=20

Brazilians dressed in alpaca coats, white trousers, and patent leather boot=
s dispensed the wares,=20

whilst negroes ran about rolling in casks of flour, hogsheads of sugar, and=
 bales of black tobacco=20

from Bahia, or from Maranh=C3=A3o.  Such exterior graces did the little tow=
n of the High Cross exhibit to=20

us, wearied with the baking days and freezing nights of the last month=E2=
=80=99s campaign. Whether some=20

Jesuit in the days gone by, when missionaries stood up before their catechu=
mens unsustained by=20

Gatling guns, sheltered but by a rude cross in their hands and their meek l=
ives, had named the=20



place, in commemoration of some saving act of grace done by Jehovah in the =
conversion of the=20

heathen, none can tell.  It may be that the Rood set up on high was but a l=
andmark, or again to=20

mark a frontier line against the heathen to the north, or yet it may have b=
een the grave of some=20

Paulista, who in his foray against the Jesuits in Paraguay died here on his=
 return, whilst driving on=20

before him a herd of converts to become slaves in far San Paulo, to the gre=
ater glory of the Lord.=20

All these things may have been, or none of them; but the quiet sleepy place=
, the forests with their=20

parrots and macaws, their herds of peccaries, their bands of screaming monk=
eys, the bright-

striped tiger-cats, the armadillos, coatis, capibar=C3=A1s, and gorgeous fl=
aming =E2=80=9Cseibos,=E2=80=9D all intertwined=20

by ropes of living cordage of lianas, and the supreme content of all the dw=
ellers in the district, with=20

God, themselves, their country, and their lives, still after twenty years i=
s fresh, and stirs me, as the=20

memory of the Pacific stirs a reclaimed =E2=80=9Cbeach-comber=E2=80=9D over=
 his grog, and makes him say, =E2=80=9CI=20

never should have left them islands, for a man was happy in =E2=80=99em, li=
ving on the beach.=E2=80=9D  To this=20

commercial centre (centro do commercio) we were advised to go, and there I =
rode, leaving my=20

partner with the peons riding round the caballada upon the plains.  Dressed=
 as I was in the clothes=20

worn by the Gauchos of the Banda Oriental, a hat tied underneath the chin w=
ith a black cord, a=20

vicu=C3=B1a poncho, and armed with large resounding silver spurs, I made a =
blot of colour in Cardozo=E2=80=99s=20

shop amongst the quietly dressed Brazilians, who, though they were some of =
the smartest men in=20

South America upon a horse, were always clad in=20


_
the profits, I have to work the harder to make fair wages."  "It is fortuna=
te for my son that he found=20

you to take his place," said Mrs. Barry. "He could not afford to lose all t=
he income from his=20

business."  "It is a good thing for both of us," said Paul. "I was looking =
for a job just when he fell=20

sick."  "What had you been doing before?"  "I was in the prize-package busi=
ness, but that got=20

played out, and I was a gentleman at large, seeking for a light, genteel bu=
siness that wouldn't=20

require much capital."  "I shall be able to take my place pretty soon now,"=
 said the young man. "I=20

might go to-morrow, but mother thinks it imprudent."  "Better get back your=
 strength first, George,"=20

said his mother, "or you may fall sick again."  But her son was impatient o=
f confinement and=20

anxious to get to work again. So, two days afterward, about the middle of t=
he forenoon, Paul was=20

surprised by seeing George Barry get out of a Broadway omnibus, just in fro=
nt of the stand.  "Can I=20

sell you a necktie, Mr. Barry?" he asked, in a joke.  "I almost feel like a=
 stranger," said Barry, "it's=20

so long since I have been wore ordinary store-cut trousers, and had their f=
eet endued with all the=20

graces of a five-dollar elastic-sided boot.  Half-an-hour=E2=80=99s talk wi=
th the chief partner shattered all our=20

plans.  It then appeared that to take horses on to Rio was impossible, the =
country, after San Paulo,=20

being one dense forest, and even if the horses stood the change of climate,=
 the trip would take a=20

year, thus running off with any profit which we might expect.  Moreover, it=
 appeared that mules=20

were in demand throughout Brazil, but horses, till past San Paulo, five hun=
dred miles ahead, but=20

little valued, and almost as cheap, though much inferior in breed to those =
bred on the plains of=20

Uruguay.  He further told us to lose not a day in teaching all the horses t=
o eat salt, for without that=20

they would not live a month, as once the range of mountains passed between =
Cruz Alta and the=20

plains, no horse or mule could live without its three months=E2=80=99 ratio=
n of rock-salt; there being in the=20

pasture some malign quality which salt alone could cure.  Naturally he had =
the cheapest salt in the=20

whole town, and as our horses were by this time=20


_
"Do you feel strong enough to take charge now?" asked Paul.  "I am not so s=
trong as I was, and=20

the walk from our rooms would tire me; but I think if I rode both ways for =
the present I shall be able=20

to get along."  "Then you won't need me any longer?"  "I would like to have=
 you stay with me to-

day. I don't know how I shall hold out."  "All right! I'll stop."  George B=
arry remained in attendance=20

the rest of the day. He found that his strength had so far returned that he=
 should be able to=20

manage alone hereafter, and he told Paul so.  "I am glad you are well again=
, George," said Paul.=20

"It must have been dull work staying at home sick."  "Yes, it was dull; but=
 I felt more comfortable=20

from knowing that you were taking my place. If I get sick again I will send=
 for you."  "I hope you=20

won't get sick; but if you do, I will do what I can to help you."  So the t=
wo parted on the best of=20

terms. Each had been of service to the other, and neither had cause to comp=
lain.  "Well," said was=20

quite impossible to take them further without rest, they having been a mont=
h upon the road, we set=20

about to find an enclosed pasture where we could let them feed.  Xavier Fer=
nandez, a retired=20

slave- and mule-dealer, was the man on whom by accident we fell.  Riding ab=
out the plain=20

disconsolately, like Arabs changing their pastures, and with our horses fee=
ding near a little pond,=20

we met him.  An old straw hat, bed-ticking trousers, and with his naked fee=
t shoved into slippers of=20

carpindo leather, and an iron spur attached to one of them and hanging down=
 at least an inch=20

below his heel, mounted upon a mule saddled with the iron-framed Brazilian =
saddle, with the=20

addition of a crupper, a thing strange to our eyes, accustomed to the wild =
horses of the plains, he=20

did not look the type of =E2=80=9Clanded gentleman,=E2=80=9D but such he wa=
s, owner of flocks and herds, and, in=20

particular, of a well-fenced pasture, enclosing about two leagues of land. =
 After much talk of things=20

in general, of=20


_
at next?"  It was six o'clock, and there was nothing to be done till the mo=
rrow. He went slowly=20

homeward, revolving this subject in his mind. He knew that he need not rema=
in idle. He could=20

black boots, or sell newspapers, if nothing better offered, and he thought =
it quite possible that he=20

might adopt the latter business, for a few days at least. He had not forgot=
ten Mr. Preston's=20

injunction to let him know when he got out of business; but, as the second =
half dozen shirts would=20

be ready in three or four days, he preferred to wait till then, and not mak=
e a special call on Mr=20

Preston. He had considerable in progress in the republic we had left, upon =
our folly in bringing=20

horses, which could go no further into the interior, and of the money we sh=
ould have made had we=20

brought =E2=80=9Cbestas,=E2=80=9D that is, mules, we agreed to pay him so m=
uch a month for the use of his fenced=20

pasture, and for our maintenance during the time we stayed.  Leaving the ho=
rses feeding, watched=20

by the men, we rode to see the place.  Upon the way Xavier imparted much of=
 history, a good deal=20

of his lore, and curious local information about Cruz Alta, duly distorted,=
 as befits a reputable man,=20

through the perspective of his predilections, politics,=20
