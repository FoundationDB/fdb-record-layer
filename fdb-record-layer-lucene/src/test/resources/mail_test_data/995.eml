ecome old and very  The writer had a case in Bellevue Hospital during the p=
ast winter (1892-93) of a man who stated that he had been well and active u=
ntil some weeks previously, when, from muscular force alone, he sustained a=
 fracture of the _
God, that I will instantly avenge this offence.=E2=80=99 He departed withou=
t saying more, or having any=20

commands from Moses, and having entered the lady=E2=80=99s house found her =
in dalliance with her lover,=20

when, with a knife or dagger, he pierced their bodies through, and instantl=
y put them to death. The=20

twenty-four thousand adherents of the duke wished to revenge his death in b=
attle, but, through=20

God=E2=80=99s grace, they were the weaker, and were all slain.  =E2=80=98Th=
is example of the valiant man Phineas=20

is worthy of notice,=E2=80=94for he was so much enamoured with the love of =
God, and so grieved on=20

seeing the daring insult offered to him, that he was regardless of exposing=
 his own life to danger;=20

nor did he wait for the orders of Moses to perform the act,=E2=80=94but he =
did it because he saw that the=20

judges would not do their duty, some through neglect, others from fear of d=
uke Zambry.  =E2=80=98See what=20

praise and recompense he received for this act, as it is written in the hol=
y Scriptures: =E2=80=98Dixit=20

Dominus ad Moysem, Phinees filius Heleazari filii Aaron sacerdotis avertit =
iram meam a filiis=20

Israel, quia zelo meo commotus est contra eos ut non ipse delerem filios Is=
rael in zelo meo idcirco=20

loquere ad eum. Ecce do ei pacem f=C3=A6deris mei et erit tam ipsi quam sem=
ini ejus pactum=20

sacerdotii sempiternum: quia zelatus est pro Deo suo, et expiavit scelus fi=
liorum Israel.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98That is to=20

say, That the act he had done was so agreeable to God that he rewarded him,=
 by ordaining that=20

none but such as were of his blood should be anointed priests; and this is =
confirmed by the=20

writings in the Old Testament: =E2=80=98Placuit et cessavit seditio, et rep=
utatum est ei ad justitiam usque in=20

sempiternum.=E2=80=99 Scribitur in Psalmo. Which means, That this action re=
dounded to the honour, glory=20

and praise of Phineas and his family for ever.  =E2=80=98Thus it plainly ap=
pears, that concupiscence and=20

disorderly lusts had so entangled the duke Zambry in their snares that he b=
ecame an idolater, and=20

worshiped idols.=E2=80=94Here concludes the third example of my second arti=
cle.  =E2=80=98Respecting the third=20

article of my major, I must show from the authority of the Bible, which non=
e dare contradict, that=20

covetousness has made many become disloyal, was riding at full speed on hor=
seback, when his=20

horse suddenly stopped short. By great exertion the officer clung to the ho=
rse, but immediately lost=20

consciousness. His fall from the horse was broken by those about him, and t=
he concussion he=20

received was not due to the fall, but to the shock of stopping suddenly whe=
n his momentum was=20

great.  As a rule, however, the diagnosis of concussion, especially if it i=
s severe enough to be fatal,=20

is easily made by the marks of external violence with or without intracrani=
al lesions. The effects of=20

concussion may be transient and leave no trace, but, on the other hand, the=
y may be prolonged=20

and severe, _i.e._, paralysis, aphasia, loss of memory, imbecility, etc. Th=
e medical examiner=20

should be on his guard against simulation in respect to these prolonged eff=
ects of concussions.=20

One of the most frequent consequences of concussion is temporary amnesia, w=
hich ordinarily=20

succeeds immediately after the injury, but sometimes develops more slowly. =
The following curious=20

case is quoted from Lutaud as cited by Brouardel:  A woman in getting out o=
f a train at Versailles,=20

where she had gone to attend the funeral of a relative, was struck by the d=
oor of the compartment.=20

She fell, but did not lose consciousness, and picked herself up, but forgot=
 what she had come for.=20

Another result of an injury which has caused a contusion or contused wound =
may be a fracture or=20

dislocation. Fractures and dislocations of special parts will be referred t=
o later, in considering=20

injuries of the several regions of the body, but it seems appropriate here =
to refer to some of those=20

general considerations relating to these injuries which may especially dema=
nd the attention of the=20

medical expert.  =3DFractures=3D may be produced by blows or falls, or from=
 muscular action. The=20

medical witness may be questioned as to the cause of the fracture or, if it=
 was produced by a blow,=20



whether a weapon was used or not, as the defence is likely to assert that i=
t was caused by an=20

accidental fall. The nature of the associated wounds and contusions, if any=
 exist, may, as we have=20

seen, indicate the weapon used. If anything exists to indicate that a fall=
=20


_
although I could produce numerous instances from the Scriptures and other w=
ritings, I shall=20

confine my examples to three only.       =E2=80=98OF LUCIFER.  =E2=80=98The=
 first instance is that of Lucifer, the=20

most perfect of all the creatures God had made, of whom the prophet Isaiah =
says, =E2=80=98Quomodo=20

cecidisti de c=C5=93lo Lucifer, qui mane orieberis: qui dicebas in corde tu=
o, conscendam supra astra=20

Dei, exaltabo solium meum, ascendam supra altitudinem nubium et similis ero=
 altissimo.=20

Veruntamen ad infernum detraheris in profundum laci.=E2=80=99 Scrib. Is. xi=
v.  =E2=80=98Lucifer, as the prophet=20

writes, considering himself as the most perfect of creatures, said, within =
his own mind, =E2=80=98I will exert=20

myself so greatly that I will place myself and my throne above the angels, =
and rival God;=E2=80=99 that is to=20

say, he would have the same obedience paid to him. For this end, he deceive=
d numbers of angels,=20

and brought them over to his party, so that they were to do him homage and =
obedience, as to their=20

sovereign lord, and be no way subject to GOD; and Lucifer was to hold his g=
overnment in like=20

manner to should be noted, as the assailant is responsible for the effects =
of the fall.  A number of=20

conditions influence the ease with which a fracture is produced and account=
 for a fracture being=20

due to a slight injury, and so are mitigatory circumstances in the case.  F=
ractures are more easily=20

produced in the old and young, especially the former, than in the adult fro=
m the same force. This is=20

due to brittleness of the bones in the old and their small size in the youn=
g. Certain diseases like=20

syphilis, arthritis, scurvy, carcinoma, and rickets make the bones more fra=
ngible, and there is a=20

peculiar brittle condition of the bones known as _fragilitas ossium_, more =
or less hereditary, in=20

which the bones become fractured from very slight violence. Mercer is quote=
d by Taylor as stating,=20

but on how good authority it does not appear, that in general paralysis of =
the insane the bones are=20

particularly liable to fracture. Certain it is that not uncommonly insane p=
atients are found dead with=20

single or multiple fractures, but the attendants are generally convicted.  =
In=20


_
him.  =E2=80=98Thus he wished to deprive GOD, his Sovereign and Creator, of=
 the greater part of his power,=20

and attribute it to himself, being induced to it by covetousness, which had=
 taken possession of his=20

mind.  =E2=80=98St Michael, on discovering his intentions, came to him, and=
 said, that he was acting very=20

wrong; and that, since GOD had formed him the most perfect of his creatures=
, he was bounden in=20

gratitude to pay him greater reverence and obedience than all the others, f=
or the gracious favours=20

that had been shewn him. Lucifer replied, that he would do no such thing. S=
t Michael answered,=20

that neither very thin and brittle, but brittleness from any cause only mit=
igates, it does not excuse.=20

Taylor[609] reports a case in point where it was proved that the bones of t=
he skull were thin and=20

brittle, and the fractured skull proved fatal from inflammation of the brai=
n. The punishment was=20

mitigated owing to the circumstance of the brittleness of the bones.  SPONT=
ANEOUS=20

FRACTURES may occur from only a moderate degree of muscular action, and eve=
n where there=20

is no disease of the bones, but the above-mentioned condition of fragilitas=
 ossium, rendering the=20

bones more brittle, aids in the production=20


_
would suffer him to act so injuriously to their Sovereign Lord and Creator.=
 In short, a battle ensued=20

between them,=E2=80=94and many of the angels took part on either side, but =
the greater number were for=20

St Michael.  =E2=80=98St Michael slew Lucifer with a perdurable death,=E2=
=80=94and he and his legions were=20

patella, and os calcis are particularly liable to such fractures, but the l=
ong bones of the ribs and=20

extremities are sometimes so fractured, as instanced in the following cases=
 cited by Taylor:[610]=20

The humerus of a healthy man has been broken by muscular exertion simply by=
 throwing a=20


_
is in the xiith chap. of the Revelations: =E2=80=98Michael et angeli ejus p=
reliabantur cum dracone, et draco=20

pugnabat et angeli ejus cum eo;=E2=80=99 et paulum post,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98e=
t projectus est in terram draco ille, et angeli=20

ejus missi sunt cum eo. Et audivi vocem magnam in c=C5=93lo dicentem, nunc =
facta est salus, et virtus,=20

et regnum Deo nostro;=E2=80=99=E2=80=94which means, That St John saw in a v=
ision this battle, and how Lucifer=20

was cast with his angels from heaven into hell. When the battle was won, he=
 heard a loud voice=20

proclaiming through the heavens, =E2=80=98At present, peace is old, during =
the act of bowling at cricket,=20

heard a distinct crack like the breaking of a piece of wood. He fell immedi=
ately to the ground, and it=20

was found that his femur was fractured.  Again, in 1846, a healthy man, =C3=
=A6t. 33, was brought to=20

Gray=E2=80=99s Hospital with the following history: He was in the act of cr=
ossing one leg over the other to=20

look at the sole of his foot, when something was heard to give way; his rig=
ht leg hung down and he=20

was found to have received a transverse fracture of the femur at the juncti=
on of the middle and=20

lower=20
