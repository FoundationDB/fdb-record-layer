1830-1834. It is a beautiful county of high mountains, fertile valleys and =
good blue-grass pasture=20

land.  Its bounds were thus prescribed: "Beginning at the widow Litterell's=
, thence a straight line to=20

John Thrasher's; thence a straight line to John Cooper's old place; thence =
a straight line to where=20

the Waggon road crosses the Laurel ridge; from thence along the highest par=
t of said ridge to Little=20

river; and down the same to Mack's mountain; and with the same to the Grays=
on line and with the=20

same to the Patrick line and with the same to the Franklin line and with th=
e same to the line of=20

Montgomery and Franklin, opposite the widow Litterell's; from thence a stra=
ight line to the=20

beginning."  In addition to Floyd, Fayette County was also formed in 1831. =
This county, the second=20

attempt Virginia had made to honor the Marquis de la Fayette, fell later in=
to West Virginia. Taken=20

from parts of Logan, Greenbrier, Nicholas and Kanawha, Fayette lies in the =
southeastern part of=20

the state, and is traversed by the New River.  The lengthy description of i=
ts bounds notes several=20

streams besides the New River; namely: Lick creek, Meadow river, Mill creek=
, Gauley river,=20

temperament would be insensible, could their chance of occurrence be determ=
ined with the=20

greatest accuracy.  But none of the numbers in the foregoing table by any m=
eans expresses the=20

chance that a given interval will occur, considering _all_ the keys in whic=
h it is found. For example,=20

the Vth CG on the tonic of the natural key, in music written on this key, i=
s the one of most frequent=20

occurrence, its chance being expressed by 1807; but in the key of two flats=
, it becomes the Vth on=20

the supertonic, and its chance of occurrence is only as 197. Hence the prob=
lem can be completed=20

only by finding a set of numbers which shall express, with some degree of a=
ccuracy, the relative=20

frequency of different signatures.  An examination of 1600 scores, comprisi=
ng four entire=20

collections of music for the organ and voice, by the best European composer=
s, besides many=20

miscellaneous pieces, afforded the results in the following table:   TABLE =
