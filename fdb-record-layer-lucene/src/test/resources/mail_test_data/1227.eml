philodendron monstera   Chicken Chat.  Somebody says that "Plymouth Rock pullets are not always early layers, for they often grow for ten or twelve months before laying, though some lay as early as six months after Col. Gibbs, we were withheld from announcing it, because the form of the crystals, the specific gravity, the colour, and perhaps some other characters, were not perfectly accordant with European philodendron monstera   Chicken Chat.

the source of a perennial fruit supply.         *       *       *       *       *  It appears the cold wave did not 

reach its minimum in Central Florida, lat. 27, till the night of the 9th, ice having been found on the 

morning of the 10th, near Enterprise, three-fourths of an inch thick. Oranges on the trees were 

frozen through, and the leaves killed so they will drop. But though here and there a branch may be 

frosted and will die and have to be removed, little permanent damage to the groves has probably 

resulted. Central Florida is distant, as the crow flies, from Central Illinois, about one thousand 

miles. Suppose the cold wave moved steadily southwest, it follows, then, its rate of speed was not 

far from 200 miles every twenty-four hours. It is easy to comprehend how a complete signal 

service might warn of the approach of cold waves in time to take every necessary precaution to 

meet and disarm them.         *       *       *       *       *  But as much of a stinger as the late cold turn 

was, it was a mere cool breeze compared with that which fell on Florida and the entire Southwest 

in the winter of 1834-35. Then snow covered all Northern Florida, and in Central Georgia it lay on 

the ground some days, a foot deep. The young orange trees were all killed to the ground, and few 

of the aged trees escaped without the loss of most of their branches. But they soon recovered--

sprouting from the roots and stumps with great vigor, as they will again do after the late freeze. 

And this is one of the strong points of the orange. It will sprout from the stump or root when the 

trunk is removed, as surely as the young hickory or chestnut, and when transplanted young and 

trees of considerable size, will bear mutilation with about as much steel strikes, and when the steel 

is impressed upon it.  Structure compact, in some places slightly porous; lustre, generally dull, 

sometimes glimmering, and almost resinous.  Crystals octahedral. Specific gravity of three 

massive pieces, 5.7, 6. and 6.44 mean, 6.05 nearly; probably that of the crystals would be higher. 

Infusible by the blow-pipe even with borax, and does not by strong ignition impart any colour to it 

or to potash; not magnetic, even in fine powder, nor after being heated red hot on charcoal, and in 

contact with burning grease.  Many specimens decrepitate violently under the blow-pipe. When 

heated on coals in pieces of considerable size, they often explode with a smart report, and are 

thrown in fragments sometimes several yards from the fire.  Gangue quartz; accompanying 

minerals in the same vein, native bismuth, native silver, galena, iron and copper pyrites, much 

magnetic pyrites, blende, &c.  _Geological relations._ The country is primitive, and the immediate 

rock which forms the walls of the vein is said to be gneiss; (we have not seen it.)  Locality, town of 

Huntington, parish of New Stratford, county of Fairfield, 20 miles west from New-Haven, 

Connecticut.  _Remark._ Native bismuth in small quantities, has been for several years obtained 

from this mine, but the shaft has been sunk only about ten feet.   PART II. _A variety of the Ore._ 

General characters as above, but on some parts, there is seen a whitish, or yellowish, or 

sometimes darkish metallic substance; it is in thin plates, like the leaf metals, and sometimes 

reticulated, and graphic in its disposition; it is soft and easily cut with the knife. In the specimens 

examined, it was so much blended with the other ore, and so trifling in quantity, that it

*       *       *       *       *  Those who expect Congress to do anything that will hurt German and 

French importers, by way of retaliation for prohibiting pork and pork products, will be pretty sure to 

be disappointed. Senator Williams is responsible for the statement that the reason why agriculture 

is treated with so much contempt, is it sustains no lobby. But you may be separate it mechanically, 

so as to examine it separately.   PART III.--A. _Chemical Trials._  1. Muriatic acid, hot or cold, 

produces no effect; hot nitro-muriatic dissolves the ore with energy, red fumes are evolved, and 

generally a red solution obtained, from which ammonia precipitates red oxyd of iron abundantly. 

2. A heavy lemon-yellow powder remains, insoluble of course in acids,

importers will not fail in that respect, as millions will be spent to prevent legislation which will 

seriously interfere with the enormous profits of the foreign importing houses in New York. Perhaps 

Senator Williams will inform us what it will cost to keep up a well appointed lobby in Washington, 

and how much the average one-horse lawyers in Congress expect, in money down, in the way of 

a retainer. Huntington could tell, and so could Jay Gould; but both are silenced for the present, 

and Villard too.         *       *       *       *       *  "Put your thumb down there." That the trees on low 

lands which bore big crops in 1874-75, are just  3. A dark powder, in diminished quantity, again 

appears, more acid dissolves it in part, and again reveals the yellow powder, which ammonia 

again dissolves, and so on, till nothing remains but some portion of the gangue.  4. The 

ammoniacal solution, which contains the oxyd of tungsten, is decomposed by acids, and by heat, 

and instantly deposits a white heavy powder, becoming yellowish by standing, and full yellow by 

heat.  5. This powder is infusible by the blow-pipe, but ignited with borax in a platinum crucible, it 

became of a superb blue, like smalt, or between that and Prussian blue.  6. The quantity obtained 

was too small to make it

and the very trees also which have made the most vigorous growth both previously and last year. 

The whole matter is a question of nutrition.      B. F. J.         *       *       *       *       *  REMEMBER

reduction to the metallic state; no doubt remained, however, that it was oxyd of tungsten, or as it is 

sometimes called, tungstic acid.  7. There were traces of manganese, and all the facts perhaps 

justify the conclusion, that the ore is very similar to the ferruginous tungsten or wolfram.  8. The 

calcareous tungsten occurs in octahedral crystals, but we have not before heard of this form in the 

ferruginous species, which generally affects the prismatic forms.   B. REMARK.  We had been for 

some time inclined to believe, that the above ore was ferruginous
