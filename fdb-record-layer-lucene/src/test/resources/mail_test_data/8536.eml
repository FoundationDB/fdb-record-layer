two ships, therefore, were assigned to the West Gulf Squadron, ranging from=
 tugs, mortar-

schooners, and chartered ferry-boats to the most powerful man-of-war which =

owned.[221] To command this great fleet was chosen Farragut, whose force an=

the fleet managed to cross the bar and enter the Mississippi, a feat of no =

I'm going. But just you the main obstructions twenty miles above. Farragut =
had seventeen ships=20

for the attack, mounting one hundred and fifty guns, besides twenty mortar-=
schooners, with six=20

attendant gunboats, under Commodore David D. Porter.  Fort Jackson and Fort=
 St. Philip, well=20

manned and equipped, guarded the river on the west and east. An enormous ch=
ain, supported on=20

anchored hulks, stretched across the half-mile of current to hold any appro=
aching hostile vessels=20

at a point where the fire of the forts could converge. Above the forts, a f=
ormidable flotilla of craft=20

variously armed with rams and guns, some heaped with pitch-pine knots to se=

stood ready to take part.[224]  [Illustration: FORTS OF THE MISSISSIPPI]  U=
nless this boom=20

could be broken the ships could not ascend. Farragut ordered two gunboats t=
o this dangerous=20

lately.  REGINA. [Follows him.] It's himself, in the _Hartford_, led the co=
lumn which was to pass=20

rible. The night was=20

calm, with starlight and a waning moon; but in the fiercer flashings of the=
 combat the world=20

seemed on fire. In arcs rising far toward the zenith the shells of the mort=

broadsides thundered; from barbette and casemate rolled an incessant reply.=
 Suddenly above the=20

flashes of guns came a steady glare: fire-ships, their pitch-pine cargoes a=

midst of the struggling fleet. The attacking lines became confused in the v=
olumes of smoke settling=20

down upon the stream. In the blinding vapor friend could scarcely be told f=
