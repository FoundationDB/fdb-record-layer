attitude of the new Administration. Adams had not the slightest sympathy wi=
th the idea of rotation=20

in public position: such a policy, he said, would make government "a perpet=

story, one would think, would be anything but salutary; it is only when one=
 recognizes the simple,=20

unsophisticated piety which inspired it, and reflects upon its teaching of =
greater gentleness,=20

greater charity in judging others, that one can admire it.  To the mediaeva=
l mind, indeed, the Virgin=20

was not very unlike a heroine of romance, and it was no disrespect to deck =
her out=20


_
"Less possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my predecessors,"=
 wrote Adams in his=20

first message to Congress, "I am deeply conscious of the prospect that I sh=
all stand more and=20

oftener in need of your indulgence." In the principles and measures which h=
e urged upon the=20

legislative branch, none the less, he showed gorgeously as some fair Elaine=
 or Iseut. The story of=20

this latter heroine, whose name no two will spell alike,--Iseut, Ysoult, Is=
olde, Isout, Ysolt,--is one=20

typical of the age of romance and chivalry, and one which we shall give, de=
spite its familiarity. By=20

way of preface it may be well to remark that the story has been told so=20

Since the War of 1812 the Republicans, with whom Adams had been numbered, h=
ad inclined=20

strongly toward a liberal construction of the Constitution, but none had go=
ne to the limits marked=20

out in this program. Besides, a strong reaction was now setting in. The Pre=
sident's=20

recommendations were received in some quarters with astonishment, in some r=
ather with=20

amusement. Nowhere were they regarded, in their entirety, with favor. Even =
Clay--spokesman of=20

nationalism though he was--could not follow his chief in his untrammeled fl=
ights. Men still widely=20

believed that the National Government ought to spend money freely on highwa=
ys, canals, and=20

other improvements. But by his bold avowals Adams characteristically threw =
away support for both=20

himself and his cause; and the era of federal initiative and management was=
 thus hastened toward=20

its close.  No one who knew Jackson and his political managers expected the=
m to accept the=20

anomalous electoral results of 1825 as expressing the real will of the nati=
on, and it was a foregone=20

conclusion not only that the General would again be a candidate, but that t=
he campaign of 1828=20

would at once begin. The defeated Senator remained in Washington long enoug=
h to present=20

himself at the White House on Inauguration Day and felicitate his successfu=
l rival. Then he set out=20

on the long journey homeward. Every town through Pennsylvania and along the=
 Ohio turned out=20

en masse to greet him, and at Nashville he was given a prodigious reception=
. To friends and=20

traveling companions he talked constantly about the election, leaving no do=
ubt of his conviction=20

that he had been defeated by intrigue. To a sympathetic group of passengers=
 traveling down the=20

Ohio with him on board the General Neville he declared emphatically that, i=
f he had been willing to=20

make the same promises and offers to Clay that Adams had made, he would tha=
t minute be in the=20

presidential chair. If he should yet attain that dignity, he added variatio=

an was Isabelle, sister of=20

King Mark of Cornwall, who, dying when her son was born, asked that he be c=
alled Tristan, or=20

Tristram, "that is as much as to say, sorrowful birth." The boy was hated b=
y his uncle, King Mark,=20

who tried to make away with him; but the youth escaped to France, where he =
won the love of King=20

Faramond's daughter, and was in consequence compelled to flee again to Corn=
wall, where a=20

temporary reconciliation with Mark was effected. Then there came out of Ire=
land a knight, Sir=20

Morhoult, to claim tribute due to the Irish king by King Mark. Tristan foug=
ht with the stranger,=20

wounded him unto death, and was himself wounded by the poisoned lance of hi=
s adversary. Only=20

in the country where the poison was brewed was there hope of succor for the=
 wounded hero; and=20

accordingly Tristan set out for Ireland, in a boat without sails and withou=
t rudder, albeit well=20

victualled. The helpless boat, however, bore its precious burden safely to =
Ireland.  The wounded=20

knight, who concealed his real name, was kindly received by the Irish king,=
 who gave him into the=20

charge of his wife and his daughter, La Belle Iseut, both skilled leeches. =
The latter, fair and=20

golden-haired, altogether lovely, became the special attendant of the wound=
ed knight: "And when=20

she had searched his wound, she found in the bottom of his wound that there=
 was poison, and=20

within a little while she healed him, and therefore Tristan cast great love=
 to la Belle Iseut, for she=20

was at that time the fairest lady in the world, and then Sir Tristan taught=
 her to harp, and she=20

began to have a great fantasy unto Sir Tristan." Unfortunately the mother o=
f Iseut discovered by=20

chance that Tristan was the slayer of her brother, Sir Morhoult. Tristan mu=
