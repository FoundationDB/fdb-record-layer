Russian and American, Greesheimer expressed himself as he strode swiftly up=
 and down.  For=20

seven years without a break he had "kept a goil" more fascinating to his ta=
ste than any female in=20

New York. Her name was Sadie, she was a model in a dressmaker's shop uptown=
, and she=20

owned him body and soul. Their marriage had only been put off until he had =
bridged the=20

dangerous time in the launching of his business. For Greesheimer had a moth=
er, an old uncle and=20

a sister and two small nephews to support. But this Zimmerman contract, "Go=
tt sei danke!" would=20

clear the way for marriage at once. And as that glorious vision, of relativ=
es all radiant and Sadie=20

flushed and joyous leaping into his embrace, had burst upon his dazzled sou=
l, his glance had lit on=20

his employee, and he had hugged her in his joy! And she--Again did Greeshei=
mer swear! He felt=20

hot angry blushes rise. And later at his telephone he was saying to a woman=
 friend who ran an=20

employment bureau:  "I got to have a stenographer. See? Und I don't vant a =
goil, I vant a man--a=20

smart young fellah, y'understand. . . . Jewish? Yes! You betcher! No more C=
hristian goils in mine!=20

Dey have rotten minds--plain rotten minds!"  But to Ethel, walking blindly,=
 no such explanation=20

occurred. She could still feel that body, those greedy lips and clutching h=
ands, and out of her=20

disgust and rage emerged another feeling which grew like a load allopathic =
members, three=20

hom=C5=93opathic members, and one eclectic member (Compiled Laws 1884, s. 2=
,553).=20

QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94Applications for certificates and examinations are m=
ade to the board through=20

their secretary (_ib._, s. 2,555).  The board must examine diplomas as to t=
heir genuineness; the=20

verification consists in an affidavit of the holder and applicant that he i=
s the lawful possessor of the=20

diploma and the person therein named; the affidavit may be taken before any=
 person authorized to=20

administer oaths, and shall be attested under his hand and official seal if=
 he have a seal.=20

Graduates may present their diplomas and affidavits by letter or by proxy (=
_ib._, s. 2,556).=20

Examinations of persons not graduates or licentiates must be made by the bo=
ard, and certificates=20

by a majority of the board authorize the possessor to practise medicine and=
 surgery (_ib._, s.=20

2,557).  The certificate must be recorded in the county clerk=E2=80=99s off=
ice in every county in which the=20

holder practises or attempts to practise medicine or surgery (_ib._, s. 2,5=
58).  When a certificate is=20

filed, the clerk must record it and attach his certificate thereto, showing=
 the date of filing and=20

recording and the number of the book and the page of the record (_ib._, s. =
2,559).  Examinations=20

of persons not graduates must be made by the board and may be wholly or par=
tly in writing, in=20

anatomy, physiology,=20


_
her shoulders, sagging her spirit and crushing her down.  "Joe was right. I=
t was only my face. That=20

beast was only waiting! . . . I wonder if they're all like that? Probably n=
ot. But how can I tell the=20

sheep from the goats? I thought I could. I thought I knew how to handle mys=
elf--I thought I knew=20

how to get on in this town! But I don't, it seems--I've done nothing at all=
! I've just been a little fool! .=20

. . And New York is like that!"  She glared at the city around her, at its =
tall, hard unfriendly walls,=20

the jangling trolleys down below, the trucks and pathology, surgery, obstet=
rics, and the practice of=20

medicine (exclusive of materia medica and therapeutics) (_ib._, s. 2,561). =
 The board may refuse=20

or revoke a certificate to an individual guilty of unprofessional or dishon=
orable conduct (_ib._, s.=20

2,562).  DEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94Practising medicine is defined as =
professing publicly to be=20

a physician and prescribing for the sick or appending to a name the letters=
 =E2=80=9CM.D.=E2=80=9D The act does not=20

prohibit students from prescribing under the supervision of a preceptor, no=
r prevent women from=20

_
rushing by her. For all their hurry, some of the men shot glances at Ethel =
that made her burn. One=20

tall thin man even stopped and turned and she felt his look travel right do=
wn to her toes! She=20

walked on and on with her bare fists clenched. She had left her gloves in t=
he office. Go back for=20

them? No! Nor to any office, nor any man!  "Oh, yes, I will, I'll go back t=
o Joe--and hear him say, 'I=20

told you so.'"  She reached the apartment faint and sick. Joe had not come =
home, thank=20

goodness. She went to her room and to her bed, and had a good cry, which re=
lieved her a little.=20

And so, after an hour or two, looking steadily up at the ceiling, she decid=
ed that after a few days'=20

rest she would go to all three of those bureaus and say, "I'm in the market=
 still, if you please, but=20

only for a woman boss."  But later, as she was dressing for dinner, her eye=
 was caught by the=20

photograph of her sister Amy. And the face appeared to her suddenly so emer=
gency, nor apply to=20

commissioned surgeons or acting surgeons of the United States army or navy =
(_ib._, s. 2,563).=20

PENALTY.=E2=80=94Practising medicine or surgery without complying with the =
act is punishable with a=20

fine of from $50 to $500 for each offence; and filing a diploma or a certif=
icate of another, or a=20

forged affidavit of identification, is a felony punishable the same as forg=
ery.  EXCEPTION.=E2=80=94The=20

provisions of the act do not apply to those who have been practising medici=
ne ten years in the=20

Territory (_ib._, s. 2,564, Act passed 1882).  PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.=E2=80=
=94The code of ethics of=20

the United States Medical Association is the standard, and the rule of deci=
sion, concerning=20

professional conduct (_ib._, s. 2,565).  PENALTY.=E2=80=94Persons unlawfull=
y collecting or receiving fees=20

or compensation for services as physicians or surgeons in violation of this=
 act, are liable to the=20

party paying it for double the amount thereof (_ib._, s. 2,568).=20


_
at all new "movements" and ideas and work for women. She seemed to be smili=
ng now, with a=20

good-humoured pitying air, and to be saying:  "Now will you believe me? It =
isn't what you say to=20

men, it's how you look and what you wear."  And Ethel stared at it and frow=
ned, in a disillusioned,=20

questioning way.    CHAPTER VII  Joe did not say, "I told you so." It was a=
fter eight that evening=20

when he came home from his office, and she was annoyed at the delay, for sh=
e wanted to have=20

her confession of failure over and done with. As she waited if the diploma =
is genuine, $5.  To the=20

secretary of the board, from each graduate or licentiate if the diploma is =
fraudulent or not owned=20

by the possessor, $20 (_ib._, s. 2,556).  To clerk of the county, for filin=
g and recording certificate,=20

the usual fees (_ib._, s. 2,559).  To the secretary of the board, for exami=
nation, in advance, $10=20

(_ib._, s. 2,561).   NEW YORK.  PROHIBITION.=E2=80=94No person can lawfully=
 practise medicine unless=20

registered and legally authorized prior to September 1st, 1891, or unless l=
