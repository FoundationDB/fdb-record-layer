by means of the cymbals, compress the air which is enclosed in the cylinder=
s, and force it into the=20

pipes, through which it runs into the regulator, and through its neck into =
the windchest. With a=20

stronger motion of the levers, the air is still more compressed, streams th=
rough the apertures of=20

the cocks, and fills the channels with wind.  6. So, when the keys, touched=
 by the hand, drive the=20

sliders forward and draw them back regularly, alternately stopping and open=
ing the holes, they=20

produce resonant sounds in a great variety of melodies conforming to the la=
ws of music.  With my=20

best efforts I have striven to set forth an obscure subject clearly in writ=
ing, but the theory of it is not=20

easy, nor readily understood by all, save only those who have had some prac=
tice in things of this=20

kind. If anybody has failed to understand it, he will certainly find, when =
he comes to know the thing=20

itself, that it is carefully and exquisitely contrived in all respects.    =
 CHAPTER IX  THE=20

HODOMETER   1. The drift of our treatise now turns to a useful invention of=
 the greatest ingenuity,=20

transmitted by our predecessors, which enables us, while sitting in a carri=
age on the road or=20

sailing by sea, to know how many miles of a journey we have accomplished. T=
his will be possible=20

as follows. Let the wheels of the carriage be each four feet in diameter, s=
o that if a wheel has a=20

mark made upon it, and begins to move forward from that mark in making its =
revolution on the=20

surface of the road, it will have covered the definite distance of twelve a=
nd a half feet on reaching=20

that mark at which it began to revolve.  2. Having provided such wheels, le=
t a drum with a single=20

tooth projecting beyond the face of its circumference be firmly fastened to=
 the inner side of the hub=20

of the wheel. Then, above this, let a case be firmly fastened to the body o=
f the carriage, containing=20

a revolving drum set on edge and mounted on an axle; on the face of the dru=
m there are four=20

hundred teeth, placed at equal intervals, and engaging the tooth of the dru=
m below. The upper=20

drum has, moreover, one tooth fixed to its side and standing out farther th=
an the other teeth.  3.=20

Then, above, let there be a horizontal drum, similarly toothed and containe=
d in another case, with=20

its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to the side of the second drum, and let =
as many holes be made=20

in this (third) drum as will correspond to the number of miles--more or les=
s, it does not matter--that=20

a carriage can go in a day's journey. Let a small round stone be placed in =
every one of these=20

holes, and in the receptacle or case containing that drum let one hole be m=
ade, with a small pipe=20

attached, through which, when they reach that point, the stones placed in t=
he drum may fall one by=20

one into a bronze vessel set underneath in the body, of the carriage.  4. T=
hus, as the wheel in=20

going forward carries with it the lowest drum, and as the tooth of this at =
every revolution strikes=20

against the teeth of the upper drum, and makes it move along, the result wi=
ll be that the upper=20

drum is carried round once for every four hundred revolutions of the lowest=
, and that the tooth=20

fixed to its side pushes forward one tooth of the horizontal drum. Since, t=
herefore, with four=20

hundred revolutions of the lowest drum, the upper will revolve once, the pr=
ogress made will be a=20

distance of five thousand feet or one mile. Hence, every stone, making a ri=
nging sound as it falls,=20

will give warning that we have gone one mile. The number of stones gathered=
 from beneath and=20

counted, will show the number of miles in the day's journey.  5. On board s=
hip, also, the same=20

principles may be employed with a few changes. An axle is passed through th=
e sides of the ship,=20

with its ends projecting, and wheels are mounted on them, four feet in diam=
eter, with projecting=20

floatboards fastened round their faces and striking the water. The middle o=
f the axle in the middle=20

of the ship carries a drum with one tooth projecting beyond its circumferen=
ce. Here a case is=20

placed containing a drum with four hundred teeth at regular intervals, enga=
ging the tooth of the=20



drum that is mounted on the axle, and having also one other tooth fixed to =
its side and projecting=20

beyond its circumference.  6. Above, in another case fastened to the former=
, is a horizontal drum=20

toothed in the same way, and with its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to the=
 side of the drum that is=20

set on edge, so that one of the teeth of the horizontal drum is struck at e=
ach revolution of that=20

tooth, and the horizontal drum is thus made to revolve in a circle. Let hol=
es be made in the=20

horizontal drum, in which holes small round stones are to be placed. In the=
 receptacle or case=20

containing that drum, let one hole be opened with a small pipe attached, th=
rough which a stone, as=20

soon as the obstruction is removed, falls with a ringing sound into a bronz=
e vessel.  7. So, when a=20

ship is making headway, whether under oars or under a gale of wind, the flo=
atboards on the=20

wheels will strike against the water and be driven violently back, thus tur=
ning the wheels; and they,=20

revolving, will move the axle, and the axle the drum, the tooth of which, a=
s it goes round, strikes=20

one of the teeth of the second drum at each revolution, and makes it turn a=
 little. So, when the=20

floatboards have caused the wheels to revolve four hundred times, this drum=
, having turned round=20

once, will strike a tooth of the horizontal drum with the tooth that is fix=
ed to its side. Hence, every=20

time the turning of the horizontal drum brings a stone to a hole, it will l=
et the stone out through the=20

pipe. Thus by the sound and the number, the length of the voyage will be sh=
own in miles.  I have=20

described how to make things that may be provided for use and amusement in =
times that are=20

peaceful and without fear.     CHAPTER X  CATAPULTS OR SCORPIONES   1. I sh=
all next=20

explain the symmetrical principles on which scorpiones and ballistae may be=
 constructed,=20

inventions devised for defence against danger, and in the interest of self-=
preservation.  The=20

proportions of these engines are all computed from the given length of the =
arrow which the engine=20

is intended to throw, and the size of the holes in the capitals, through wh=
ich the twisted sinews that=20

hold the arms are stretched, is one ninth of that length.  2. The height an=
d breadth of the capital=20

itself must then conform to the size of the holes. The boards at the top an=
d bottom of the capital,=20

which are called "peritreti," should be in thickness equal to one hole, and=
 in breadth to one and=20

three quarters, except at their extremities, where they equal one hole and =
a half. The sideposts on=20

the right and left should be four holes high, excluding the tenons, and fiv=
e twelfths of a hole thick;=20

the tenons, half a hole. The distance from a sidepost to the hole is one qu=
arter of a hole, and it is=20

also one quarter of a hole from the hole to the post in the middle. The bre=
adth of the post in the=20

middle is equal to one hole and one eighth, the thickness, to one hole.  3.=
 The opening in the=20

middle post, where the arrow is laid, is equal to one fourth of the hole. T=
he four surrounding=20

corners should have iron plates nailed to their sides and faces, or should =
be studded with bronze=20

pins and nails. The pipe, called [Greek: syrigx] in Greek, has a length of =
nineteen holes. The=20

strips, which some term cheeks, nailed at the right and left of the pipe, h=
ave a length of nineteen=20

holes and a height and thickness of one hole. Two other strips, enclosing t=
he windlass, are nailed=20

on to these, three holes long and half a hole in breadth. The cheek nailed =
on to them, named the=20

"bench," or by some the "box," and made fast by means of dove-tailed tenons=
, is one hole thick=20

and seven twelfths of a hole in height. The length of the windlass is equal=
 to...[12] holes, the=20

thickness of the windlass to three quarters of a hole.  [Note 12: The dots =
here and in what follows,=20

indicate lacunae in the manuscripts.]  4. The latch is seven twelfths of a =
hole in length and one=20

quarter in thickness. So also its socket-piece. The trigger or handle is th=
ree holes in length and=20

three quarters of a hole in breadth and thickness. The trough in the pipe i=
s sixteen holes in length,=20



one quarter of a hole in thickness, and three quarters in height. The base =
of the standard on the=20

ground is equal to eight holes; the breadth of the standard where it is fas=
tened into the plinth is=20

three quarters of a hole, its thickness two thirds of a hole; the height of=
 the standard up to the=20

tenon is twelve holes, its breadth three quarters of a hole, and its thickn=
ess two thirds. It has three=20

struts, each nine holes in length, half a hole in breadth, and five twelfth=
s in thickness. The tenon is=20

one hole in length, and the head of the standard one hole and a half in len=
gth.  5. The antefix has=20

the breadth of a hole and one eighth, and the thickness of one hole. The sm=
aller support, which is=20

behind, termed in Greek [Greek: antibasis], is eight holes long, three quar=
ters of a hole broad, and=20

two thirds thick. Its prop is twelve holes long, and has the same breadth a=
nd thickness as the=20

smaller support just mentioned. Above the smaller support is its socket-pie=
ce, or what is called the=20

cushion, two and a half holes long, one and a half high, and three quarters=
 of a hole broad. The=20

windlass cup is two and seven twelfths holes long, two thirds of a hole thi=
ck, and three quarters=20

broad. The crosspieces with their tenons have the length of... holes, the b=
readth of three quarters,=20

and the thickness of two thirds of a hole. The length of an arm is seven ho=
les, its thickness at its=20

base two thirds of a hole, and at its end one half a hole; its curvature is=
 equal to two thirds of a=20

hole.  6. These engines are constructed according to these proportions or w=
ith additions or=20

diminutions. For, if the height of the capitals is greater than their width=
--when they are called "high-

tensioned,"--something should be taken from the arms, so that the more the =
tension is weakened=20

by height of the capitals, the more the strength of the blow is increased b=
y shortness of the arms.=20

But if the capital is less high,--when the term "low-tensioned" is used,--t=
he arms, on account of=20

their strength, should be made a little longer, so that they may be drawn e=
asily. Just as it takes=20

four men to raise a load with a lever five feet long, and only two men to l=
ift the same load with a=20

ten-foot lever, so the longer the arms, the easier they are to draw, and th=
e shorter, the harder.  I=20

have now spoken of the principles applicable to the parts and proportions o=
f catapults.=20

CHAPTER XI  BALLISTAE   1. Ballistae are constructed on varying principles =
to produce an=20

identical result. Some are worked by handspikes and windlasses, some by blo=
cks and pulleys,=20

others by capstans, others again by means of drums. No ballista, however, i=
s made without regard=20

to the given amount of weight of the stone which the engine is intended to =
throw. Hence their=20

principle is not easy for everybody, but only for those who have knowledge =
of the geometrical=20

principles employed in calculation and in multiplication.  2. For the holes=
 made in the capitals=20

through the openings of which are stretched the strings made of twisted hai=
r, there was a beautiful=20

view over the garden and the mill-pond, which was shining now in the sunshi=
ne like a mirror. They=20

admired it, and at the same time they were sorry that this man with the kin=
d, clever eyes, who had=20

told them this story with such genuine feeling, should be rushing round and=
 round this huge estate=20

like a squirrel on a wheel instead of devoting himself to science or someth=
ing else which would=20

have made his life more pleasant; and they thought what a sorrowful face An=
na Alexyevna must=20

have had when he said good-bye to her in the railway-carriage and kissed he=
r face and shoulders.=20

Both of them had met her in the town, and Burkin knew her and thought her b=
eautiful.      THE=20

LOTTERY TICKET  IVAN DMITRITCH, a middle-class man who lived with his famil=
y on an income=20

of twelve hundred a year and was very well satisfied with his lot, sat down=
 on the sofa after supper=20

and began reading the newspaper.  "I forgot to look at the newspaper today,=
" his wife said to him=20

as she cleared the table. "Look and see whether the list of drawings is the=
re."  "Yes, it is," said=20



Ivan Dmitritch; "but hasn't your ticket lapsed?"  "No; I took the interest =
on Tuesday."  "What is the=20

number?"  "Series 9,499, number 26."  "All right... we will look... 9,499 a=
nd 26."  Ivan Dmitritch had=20

no faith in lottery luck, and would not, as a rule, have consented to look =
at the lists of winning=20

numbers, but now, as he had nothing else to do and as the newspaper was bef=
ore his eyes, he=20

passed his finger downwards along the column of numbers. And immediately, a=
s though in=20

mockery of his scepticism, no further than the second line from the top, hi=
s eye was caught by the=20

figure 9,499! Unable to believe his eyes, he hurriedly dropped the paper on=
 his knees without=20

looking to see the number of the ticket, and, just as though some one had g=
iven him a douche of=20

cold water, he felt an agreeable chill in the pit of the stomach; tingling =
and terrible and sweet!=20

"Masha, 9,499 is there!" he said in a hollow voice.  His wife looked at his=
 astonished and panic-

stricken face, and realized that he was not joking.  "9,499?" she asked, tu=
rning pale and dropping=20

the folded tablecloth on the table.  "Yes, yes... it really is there!"  "An=
d the number of the ticket?"=20

"Oh, yes! There's the number of the ticket too. But stay... wait! No, I say=
! Anyway, the number of=20

our series is there! Anyway, you understand...."  Looking at his wife, Ivan=
 Dmitritch gave a broad,=20

senseless smile, like a baby when a bright object is shown it. His wife smi=
led too; it was as=20

pleasant to her as to him that he only mentioned the series, and did not tr=
y to find out the number=20

of the winning ticket. To torment and tantalize oneself with hopes of possi=
ble fortune is so sweet,=20

so thrilling!  "It is our series," said Ivan Dmitritch, after a long silenc=
e. "So there is a probability that=20

we have won. It's only a probability, but there it is!"  "Well, now look!" =
 "Wait a little. We have plenty=20

of time to be disappointed. It's on the second line from the top, so the pr=
ize is seventy-five=20

thousand. That's not money, but power, capital! And in a minute I shall loo=
k at the list, and there--

26! Eh? I say, what if we really have won?"  The husband and wife began lau=
ghing and staring at=20

one another in silence. The possibility of winning bewildered them; they co=
uld not have said, could=20

not have dreamed, what they both needed that seventy-five thousand for, wha=
t they would buy,=20

where they would go. They thought only of the figures 9,499 and 75,000 and =
pictured them in their=20

imagination, while somehow they could not think of the happiness itself whi=
ch was so possible.=20

Ivan Dmitritch, holding the paper in his hand, walked several times from co=
rner to corner, and only=20

when he had recovered from the first impression began dreaming a little.  "=
And if we have won,"=20

he said--"why, it will be a new life, it will be a transformation! The tick=
et is yours, but if it were mine=20

I should, first of all, of course, spend twenty-five thousand on real prope=
rty in the shape of an=20

estate; ten thousand on immediate expenses, new furnishing... travelling...=
 paying debts, and so=20

on.... The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on=
 it."  "Yes, an estate, that=20

would be nice," said his wife, sitting down and dropping her hands in her l=
ap.  "Somewhere in the=20

Tula or Oryol provinces.... In the first place we shouldn't need a summer v=
illa, and besides, it=20

would always bring in an income."  And pictures came crowding on his imagin=
ation, each more=20

gracious and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw himse=
lf well-fed, serene,=20

healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after eating a summer soup, cold as ice=
, he lay on his back on=20

the burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree.... I=
t is hot.... His little boy=20

and girl are crawling about near him, digging in the sand or catching ladyb=
irds in the grass. He=20

dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he need not g=
o to the office today,=20

tomorrow, or the day after. Or, tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfie=
ld, or to the forest for=20

mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When the sun s=
ets he takes a towel=20



and soap and saunters to the bathing-shed, where he undresses at his leisur=
e, slowly rubs his=20

bare chest with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near =
the opaque soapy=20

circles, little fish flit to and fro and green water-weeds nod their heads.=
 After bathing there is tea=20

with cream and milk rolls.... In the evening a walk or _vint_ with the neig=
hbours.  "Yes, it would be=20

nice to buy an estate," said his wife, also dreaming, and from her face it =
was evident that she was=20

enchanted by her thoughts.  Ivan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with =
its rains, its cold=20

evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have to take=
 longer walks about=20

the garden and beside the river, so as to get thoroughly chilled, and then =
drink a big glass of=20

vodka and eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink anoth=
er.... The children=20

would come running from the kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish =
smelling of fresh=20

earth.... And then, he would lie stretched full length on the sofa, and in =
leisurely fashion turn over=20

the pages of some illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and u=
nbuttoning his waistcoat,=20

give himself up to slumber.  The St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy,=
 gloomy weather. It=20

rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and cold. The do=
gs, the horses, the=20

fowls--all are wet, depressed, downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can'=
t go out for days=20

together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking despondently at the=
 grey window. It is=20

dreary!  Ivan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.  "I should go abroa=
d, you know, Masha," he=20

said.  And he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go abro=
ad somewhere to the=20

South of France... to Italy.... to India!  "I should certainly go abroad to=
o," his wife said. "But look at=20

the number of the ticket!"  "Wait, wait!..."  He walked about the room and =
went on thinking. It=20

occurred to him: what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to t=
ravel alone, or in the society=20

of light, careless women who live in the present, and not such as think and=
 talk all the journey=20

about nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over every =
farthing. Ivan Dmitritch=20

imagined his wife in the train with a multitude of parcels, baskets, and ba=
gs; she would be sighing=20

over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that she had=
 spent so much=20

money.... At the stations he would continually be having to run for boiling=
 water, bread and=20

butter.... She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....  "She=
 would begrudge me=20

every farthing," he thought, with a glance at his wife. "The lottery ticket=
 is hers, not mine! Besides,=20

what is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would sh=
ut herself up in the=20

hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!"  And for the first time=
 in his life his mind dwelt on=20

the fact that his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was satura=
ted through and through=20

with the smell of cooking, while he was still young, fresh, and healthy, an=
d might well have got=20

married again.  "Of course, all that is silly nonsense," he thought; "but..=
. why should she go=20

abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would go, of course.... I ca=
n fancy... In reality it=20

is all one to her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my wa=
y. I should be dependent=20

upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular woman, she will lock the money up=
 as soon as she gets=20

it.... She will hide it from me.... She will look after her relations and g=
rudge me every farthing."=20

Ivan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched brothers and si=
sters and aunts and=20

uncles would come crawling about as soon as they heard of the winning ticke=
t, would begin=20

whining like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles.=
 Wretched, detestable=20

people! If they were given anything, they would ask for more; while if they=
 were refused, they=20

would swear at them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune. =
 Ivan Dmitritch=20



remembered his own relations, and their faces, at which he had looked impar=
tially in the past,=20

struck him now as repulsive and hateful.  "They are such reptiles!" he thou=
ght.  And his wife's face,=20

too, struck him as repulsive and hateful. Anger surged up in his heart agai=
nst her, and he thought=20

malignantly:  "She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she =
won it she would give=20

me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under lock and key."  And he lo=
oked at his wife, not=20

with a smile now, but with hatred. She glanced at him too, and also with ha=
tred and anger. She=20

had her own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood p=
erfectly well what=20

her husband's dreams were. She knew who would be the first to try and grab =
her winnings.  "It's=20

very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!" is what her eyes exp=
ressed. "No, don't=20

you dare!"  Her husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in=
 his breast, and in=20

order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite her at the fourth page=
 on the newspaper and=20

read out triumphantly:  "Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!"  Hatred and hope=
 both disappeared at=20

once, and it began immediately to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that =
their rooms were dark=20

and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was not doi=
ng them good, but=20

lying heavy on their stomachs, that the evenings were long and wearisome...=
.  "What the devil's=20

the meaning of it?" said Ivan Dmitritch, beginning to be ill-humoured. "Whe=
rever one steps there=20

are bits of paper under one's feet, crumbs, husks. The rooms are never swep=
t! One is simply=20

forced to go out. Damnation take my soul entirely! I shall go and hang myse=
lf on the first aspen-

tree!"      End of Project Gutenberg's The Wife and Other Stories, by Anton=

_
sinew, are proportionate to the amount of weight in the stone which the bal=
lista is intended to=20

throw, and to the principle of mass, as in catapults the principle is that =
of the length of the arrow.=20

Therefore, in order that those who do not understand geometry may be prepar=
ed beforehand, so=20

as not to be delayed by having to think the matter out at a moment of peril=
 in war, I will set forth=20

what I myself know by experience can be depended upon, and what I have in p=
art gathered from=20

the rules of my teachers, and wherever Greek weights bear a relation to the=
 measures, I shall=20

reduce and explain them so that they will express the same corresponding re=
lation in our weights.=20

3. A ballista intended to throw a two-pound stone will have a hole of five =
digits in its capital; four=20

pounds, six digits; and six pounds, seven digits; ten pounds, eight digits;=
 twenty pounds, ten digits;=20

forty pounds, twelve and a half digits; sixty pounds, thirteen and a half d=
igits; eighty pounds, fifteen=20

and three quarters digits; one hundred pounds, one foot and one and a half =
digits; one hundred=20

and twenty pounds, one foot and two digits; one hundred and forty pounds, o=
ne foot and three=20

digits; one hundred and sixty pounds, one foot and a quarter; one hundred a=
nd eighty pounds, one=20

foot and five digits; two hundred pounds, one foot and six digits; two hund=
red and forty pounds,=20

one foot and seven digits; two hundred and eighty pounds, one foot and a ha=
lf; three hundred and=20

twenty pounds, one foot and nine digits; three hundred and sixty pounds, on=
e foot and ten digits.=20

4. Having determined the size of the hole, design the "scutula," termed in =
Greek [Greek:=20

peritretos],... holes in length and two and one sixth in breadth. Bisect it=
 by a line drawn diagonally=20

from the angles, and after this bisecting bring together the outlines of th=
e figure so that it may=20

present a rhomboidal design, reducing it by one sixth of its length and one=
 fourth of its breadth at=20

the (obtuse) angles. In the part composed by the curvatures into which the =
points of the angles run=20

out, let the holes be situated, and let the breadth be reduced by one sixth=
; moreover, let the hole=20

be longer than it is broad by the thickness of the bolt. After designing th=
e scutula, let its outline be=20

worked down to give it a gentle curvature.  5. It should be given the thick=
ness of seven twelfths of=20

a hole. The boxes are two holes (in height), one and three quarters in brea=
dth, two thirds of a hole=20

in thickness except the part that is inserted in the hole, and at the top o=
ne third of a hole in=20

breadth. The sideposts are five holes and two thirds in length, their curva=
ture half a hole, and their=20

thickness thirty-seven forty-eighths of a hole. In the middle their breadth=
 is increased as much as it=20

was near the hole in the design, by the breadth and thickness of... hole; t=
he height by one fourth of=20

a hole.  6. The (inner) strip on the "table" has a length of eight holes, a=
 breadth and thickness of=20

half a hole. Its tenons are one hole and one sixth long, and one quarter of=
 a hole in thickness. The=20

curvature of this strip is three quarters of a hole. The outer strip has th=
e same breadth and=20

thickness (as the inner), but the length is given by the obtuse angle of th=
e design and the breadth=20

of the sidepost at its curvature. The upper strips are to be equal to the l=
ower; the crosspieces of=20

the "table," one half of a hole.  7. The shafts of the "ladder" are thirtee=
n holes in length, one hole in=20

thickness; the space between them is one hole and a quarter in breadth, and=
 one and one eighth=20

in depth. Let the entire length of the ladder on its upper surface--which i=
s the one adjoining the=20

arms and fastened to the table--be divided into five parts. Of these let tw=
o parts be given to the=20

member which the Greeks call the [Greek: chelonion], its breadth being one =
and one sixth, its=20

thickness one quarter, and its length eleven holes and one half; the claw p=
rojects half a hole and=20

the "winging" three sixteenths of a hole. What is at the axis which is term=
ed the... face... the=20

crosspieces of three holes?  8. The breadth of the inner slips is one quart=
er of a hole; their=20



thickness one sixth. The cover-joint or lid of the chelonium is dove-tailed=
 into the shafts of the=20

ladder, and is three sixteenths of a hole in breadth and one twelfth in thi=
ckness. The thickness of=20

the square piece on the ladder is three sixteenths of a hole,... the diamet=
er of the round axle will=20

be equal to that of the claw, but at the pivots seven sixteenths of a hole.=
  9. The stays are... holes=20

in length, one quarter of a hole in breadth at the bottom, and one sixth in=
 thickness at the top. The=20

base, termed [Greek: eschara], has the length of... holes, and the anti-bas=
e of four holes; each is=20

one hole in thickness and breadth. A supporter is jointed on, halfway up, o=
ne and one half holes in=20

breadth and thickness. Its height bears no relation to the hole, but will b=
e such as to be=20

serviceable. The length of an arm is six holes, its thickness at the base t=
wo thirds of a hole, and at=20

the end one half a hole.  I have now given those symmetrical proportions of=
 ballistae and catapults=20

which I thought most useful. But I shall not omit, so far as I can express =
it in writing, the method of=20

stretching and tuning their strings of twisted sinew or hair.     CHAPTER X=
II  THE STRINGING=20

AND TUNING OF CATAPULTS   1. Beams of very generous length are selected, an=
d upon them=20

are nailed socket-pieces in which windlasses are inserted. Midway along the=
ir length the beams=20

are incised and cut away to form framings, and in these cuttings the capita=
ls of the catapults are=20

inserted, and prevented by wedges from moving when the stretching is going =
on. Then the bronze=20

boxes are inserted into the capitals, and the little iron bolts, which the =
Greeks call [Greek:=20

epizygides], are put in their places in the boxes.  2. Next, the loops of t=
he strings are put through=20

the holes in the capitals, and passed through to the other side; next, they=
 are put upon the=20

windlasses, and wound round them in order that the strings, stretched out t=
aut on them by means=20

of the handspikes, on being struck by the hand, may respond with the same s=
ound on both sides.=20

Then they are wedged tightly into the holes so that they cannot slacken. So=
, in the same manner,=20

they are passed through to the other side, and stretched taut on the windla=
sses by means of the=20

handspikes until they give the same sound. Thus with tight wedging, catapul=
ts are tuned to the=20

proper pitch by musical sense of hearing.  On these things I have said what=
 I could. There is left=20

for me, in the matter of sieges, to explain how generals can win victories =
and cities be defended,=20

by means of machinery.     CHAPTER XIII  SIEGE MACHINES   1. It is related =
that the battering=20

ram for sieges was originally invented as follows. The Carthaginians pitche=
d their camp for the=20

siege of Cadiz. They captured an outwork and attempted to destroy it. But h=
aving no iron=20

implements for its destruction, they took a beam, and, raising it with thei=
r hands, and driving the=20

end of it repeatedly against the top of the wall, they threw down the top c=
ourses of stones, and=20

thus, step by step in regular order, they demolished the entire redoubt.  2=
. Afterwards a carpenter=20

from Tyre, Bright by name and by nature, was led by this invention into set=
ting up a mast from=20

which he hung another crosswise like a steelyard, and so, by swinging it vi=
gorously to and fro, he=20

threw down the wall of Cadiz. Geras of Chalcedon was the first to make a wo=
oden platform with=20

wheels under it, upon which he constructed a framework of uprights and cros=
spieces, and within it=20

he hung the ram, and covered it with oxhide for the better protection of th=
e men who were=20

stationed in the machine to batter the wall. As the machine made but slow p=
rogress, he first gave it=20

the name of the tortoise of the ram.  3. These were the first steps then ta=
ken towards that kind of=20

machinery, but afterwards, when Philip, the son of Amyntas, was besieging B=
yzantium, it was=20

developed in many varieties and made handier by Polyidus the Thessalian. Hi=
s pupils were=20

Diades and Charias, who served with Alexander. Diades shows in his writings=
 that he invented=20



moveable towers, which he used also to take apart and carry round with the =
army, and likewise=20

the borer, and the scaling machine, by means of which one can cross over to=
 the wall on a level=20

with the top of it, as well as the destroyer called the raven, or by others=
 the crane.  4. He also=20

employed the ram mounted on wheels, an account of which he left in his writ=
ings. As for the tower,=20

he says that the smallest should be not less than sixty cubits in height an=
d seventeen in breadth,=20

but diminishing to one fifth less at the top; the uprights for the tower be=
ing nine inches at the=20

bottom and half a foot at the top. Such a tower, he says, ought to be ten s=
tories high, with windows=20

in it on all sides.  5. His larger tower, he adds, was one hundred and twen=
ty cubits high and=20

twenty-three and one half cubits broad, diminishing like the other to one f=
ifth less; the uprights, one=20

foot at the bottom and six digits at the top. He made this large tower twen=
ty stories high, each=20

story having a gallery round it, three cubits wide. He covered the towers w=
ith rawhide to protect=20

them from any kind of missile.  6. The tortoise of the battering ram was co=
nstructed in the same=20

way. It had, however, a base of thirty cubits square, and a height, excludi=
ng the pediment, of=20

thirteen cubits; the height of the pediment from its bed to its top was sev=
en cubits. Issuing up and=20

above the middle of the roof for not less than two cubits was a gable, and =
on this was reared a=20

small tower four stories high, in which, on the top floor, scorpiones and c=
atapults were set up, and=20

on the lower floors a great quantity of water was stored, to put out any fi=
re that might be thrown on=20

the tortoise. Inside of this was set the machinery of the ram, termed in Gr=
eek [Greek: kriodoche],=20

in which was placed a roller, turned on a lathe, and the ram, being set on =
top of this, produced its=20

great effects when swung to and fro by means of ropes. It was protected, li=
ke the tower, with=20

rawhide.  7. He explained the principles of the borer as follows: that the =
machine itself resembled=20

the tortoise, but that in the middle it had a pipe lying between upright wa=
lls, like the pipe usually=20

found in catapults and ballistae, fifty cubits in length and one cubit in h=
eight, in which a windlass=20

was set transversely. On the right and left, at the end of the pipe, were t=
wo blocks, by means of=20

which the iron-pointed beam, which lay in the pipe, was moved. There were n=
umerous rollers=20

enclosed in the pipe itself under the beam, which made its movements quicke=
r and stronger.=20

Numerous arches were erected along the pipe above the beam which was in it,=
 to hold up the=20

rawhide in which this machine was enveloped.  8. He thought it needless to =
write about the raven,=20

because he saw that the machine was of no value. With regard to the scaling=
 machine, termed in=20

Greek [Greek: epibathra], and the naval contrivances which, as he wrote, co=
uld be used in=20

boarding ships, I have observed that he merely promised with some earnestne=
ss to explain their=20

principles, but that he has not done so.  I have set forth what was written=
 by Diades on machines=20

and their construction. I shall now set forth the methods which I have lear=
ned from my teachers,=20

and which I myself believe to be useful.     CHAPTER XIV  THE TORTOISE   1.=
 A tortoise=20

intended for the filling of ditches, and thereby to make it possible to rea=
ch the wall, is to be made=20

as follows. Let a base, termed in Greek [Greek: eschara], be constructed, w=
ith each of its sides=20

twenty-one feet long, and with four crosspieces. Let these be held together=
 by two others, two=20

thirds of a foot thick and half a foot broad; let the crosspieces be about =
three feet and a half apart,=20

and beneath and in the spaces between them set the trees, termed in Greek [=
Greek:=20

hamaxopodes], in which the axles of the wheels turn in iron hoops. Let the =
trees be provided with=20

pivots, and also with holes through which levers are passed to make them tu=
rn, so that the tortoise=20

can move forward or back or towards its right or left side, or if necessary=
 obliquely, all by the=20



turning of the trees.  2. Let two beams be laid on the base, projecting for=
 six feet on each side,=20

round the projections of which let two other beams be nailed, projecting se=
ven feet beyond the=20

former, and of the thickness and breadth prescribed in the case of the base=
. This and all=20

beams let the rafters be set, tied one into another by means of tenons, and=

these woods are weak and easily catch fire. Over the boardings let there be=

V  HEGETOR'S=20

TORTOISE  [Illustration: HEGETOR'S RAM AND TORTOISE  1. From a MS. of the s=
ixteenth=20

century (Wescher's Poliorcetique des Grecs).  2. From a model made by A. A.=
 Howard.]   1. There=20

is also another kind of tortoise, which has all the other details as descri=
bed above except the=20

rafters, but it has round it a parapet and battlements of boards, and eaves=
 sloping downwards, and=20

is covered with boards and hides firmly fastened in place. Above this let c=
lay kneaded with hair be=20

spread to such a thickness that fire cannot injure the machine. These machi=
nes can, if need be,=20

have eight wheels, should it be necessary to modify them with reference to =
the nature of the=20

ground. Tortoises, however, which are intended for excavating, termed in Gr=
eek [Greek:=20

oryktides], have all the other details as described above, but their fronts=
 are constructed like the=20

angles of triangles, in order that when missiles are shot against them from=
 a wall, they may=20

receive the blows not squarely in front, but glancing from the sides, and t=
hose excavating within=20

may be protected without danger.  2. It does not seem to me out of place to=
 set forth the principles=20

on which Hegetor of Byzantium constructed a tortoise. The length of its bas=
e was sixty-three feet,=20

the breadth forty-two. The corner posts, four in number, which were set upo=
n this framework, were=20

made of two timbers each, and were thirty-six feet high, a foot and a quart=
er thick, and a foot and=20

a half broad. The base had eight wheels by means of which it was moved abou=
t. The height of=20

these wheels was six and three quarters feet, their thickness three feet. T=
hus constructed of three=20

pieces of wood, united by alternate opposite dovetails and bound together b=
y cold-drawn iron=20

plates, they revolved in the trees or amaxopodes.  3. Likewise, on the plan=
e of the crossbeams=20

above the base, were erected posts eighteen feet high, three quarters of a =
foot broad, two thirds of=20

a foot thick, and a foot and three quarters apart; above these, framed beam=
s, a foot broad and=20

three quarters of a foot thick, held the whole structure together; above th=
is the rafters were raised,=20

with an elevation of twelve feet; a beam set above the rafters united their=
 joinings. They also had=20

bridgings fastened transversely, and a flooring laid on them protected the =
parts beneath.  4. It had,=20

moreover, a middle flooring on girts, where scorpiones and catapults were p=
laced. There were set=20

up, also, two framed uprights forty-five feet long, a foot and a half in th=
ickness, and three quarters=20

of a foot in breadth, joined at the tops by a mortised crossbeam and by ano=
ther, halfway up,=20

mortised into the two shafts and tied in place by iron plates. Above this w=
as set, between the=20

shafts and the crossbeams, a block pierced on either side by sockets, and f=
irmly fastened in place=20

with clamps. In this block were two axles, turned on a lathe, and ropes fas=
tened from them held=20

the ram.  5. Over the head of these (ropes) which held the ram, was placed =
a parapet fitted out like=20

a small tower, so that, without danger, two soldiers, standing in safety, c=
ould look out and report=20



what the enemy were attempting. The entire ram had a length of one hundred =
and eighty feet, a=20

breadth at the base of a foot and a quarter, and a thickness of a foot, tap=
ering at the head to a=20

breadth of a foot and a thickness of three quarters of a foot.  6. This ram=
, moreover, had a beak of=20

hard iron such as ships of war usually have, and from the beak iron plates,=
 four in number, about=20

fifteen feet long, were fastened to the wood. From the head to the very hee=
l of the beam were=20

stretched cables, three in number and eight digits thick, fastened just as =
in a ship from stem to=20

stern continuously, and these cables were bound with cross girdles a foot a=
nd a quarter apart.=20

Over these the whole ram was wrapped with rawhide. The ends of the ropes fr=
om which the ram=20

hung were made of fourfold chains of iron, and these chains were themselves=
 wrapped in rawhide.=20

7. Likewise, the projecting end of the ram had a box framed and constructed=
 of boards, in which=20

was stretched a net made of rather large ropes, over the rough surfaces of =
which one easily=20

reached the wall without the feet slipping. And this machine moved in six d=
irections, forward (and=20

backward), also to the right or left, and likewise it was elevated by exten=
ding it upwards and=20

depressed by inclining it downwards. The machine could be elevated to a hei=
ght sufficient to throw=20

down a wall of about one hundred feet, and likewise in its thrust it covere=
d a space from right to=20

left of not less than one hundred feet. One hundred men controlled it, thou=
gh it had a weight of=20

four thousand talents, which is four hundred and eighty thousand pounds.   =
  CHAPTER XVI=20

MEASURES OF DEFENCE   1. With regard to scorpiones, catapults, and ballista=
e, likewise with=20

regard to tortoises and towers, I have set forth, as seemed to me especiall=
y appropriate, both by=20

whom they were invented and in what manner they should be constructed. But =
I have not=20

considered it as necessary to describe ladders, cranes, and other things, t=
he principles of which=20

are simpler, for the soldiers usually construct these by themselves, nor ca=
n these very machines=20

be useful in all places nor in the same way, since fortifications differ fr=
om each other, and so also=20

the bravery of nations. For siege works against bold and venturesome men sh=
ould be constructed=20

on one plan, on another against cautious men, and on still another against =
the cowardly.  2. And=20

so, if any one pays attention to these directions, and by selection adapts =
their various principles to=20

a single structure, he will not be in need of further aids, but will be abl=
e, without hesitation, to=20

design such machines as the circumstances or the situations demand. With re=
gard to works of=20

defence, it is not necessary to write, since the enemy do not construct the=
ir defences in conformity=20

with our books, but their contrivances are frequently foiled, on the spur o=
f the moment, by some=20

shrewd, hastily conceived plan, without the aid of machines, as is said to =
have been the=20

experience of the Rhodians.  3. For Diognetus was a Rhodian architect, to w=
hom, as an honour,=20

was granted out of the public treasury a fixed annual payment commensurate =
with the dignity of=20

his art. At this time an architect from Aradus, Callias by name, coming to =
Rhodes, gave a public=20

lecture, and showed a model of a wall, over which he set a machine on a rev=
olving crane with=20

which he seized an helepolis as it approached the fortifications, and broug=
ht it inside the wall. The=20

Rhodians, when they had seen this model, filled with admiration, took from =
Diognetus the yearly=20

grant and transferred this honour to Callias.  4. Meanwhile, king Demetrius=
, who because of his=20

stubborn courage was called Poliorcetes, making war on Rhodes, brought with=
 him a famous=20

Athenian architect named Epimachus. He constructed at enormous expense, wit=
h the utmost care=20

and exertion, an helepolis one hundred and thirty-five feet high and sixty =
feet broad. He=20

strengthened it with hair and rawhide so that it could withstand the blow o=
f a stone weighing three=20



hundred and sixty pounds shot from a ballista; the machine itself weighed t=
hree hundred and sixty=20

thousand pounds. When Callias was asked by the Rhodians to construct a mach=
ine to resist this=20

helepolis, and to bring it within the wall as he had promised, he said that=
 it was impossible.  5. For=20

not all things are practicable on identical principles, but there are some =
things which, when=20

enlarged in imitation of small models, are effective, others cannot have mo=
dels, but are=20

constructed independently of them, while there are some which appear feasib=
le in models, but=20

when they have begun to increase in size are impracticable, as we can obser=
ve in the following=20

instance. A half inch, inch, or inch and a half hole is bored with an auger=
, but if we should wish, in=20

the same manner, to bore a hole a quarter of a foot in breadth, it is impra=
cticable, while one of half=20

a foot or more seems not even conceivable.  6. So too, in some models it is=
 seen how they appear=20

practicable on the smallest scale and likewise on a larger. And so the Rhod=
ians, in the same=20

manner, deceived by the same reasoning, inflicted injury and insult on Diog=
netus. Therefore, when=20

they saw the enemy stubbornly hostile, slavery threatening them because of =
the machine which=20

had been built to take the city, and that they must look forward to the des=
truction of their state,=20

they fell at the feet of Diognetus, begging him to come to the aid of the f=
atherland. He at first=20

refused.  7. But after free-born maidens and young men came with the priest=
s to implore him, he=20

promised to do it on condition that if he took the machine it should be his=
 property. When these=20

terms had been agreed upon, he pierced the wall in the place where the mach=
ine was going to=20

approach it, and ordered all to bring forth from both public and private so=
urces all the water,=20

excrement, and filth, and to pour it in front of the wall through pipes pro=
jecting through this=20

opening. After a great amount of water, filth, and excrement had been poure=
d out during the night,=20

on the next day the helepolis moving up, before it could reach the wall, ca=
me to a stop in the=20

swamp made by the moisture, and could not be moved forwards, nor later even=
 backwards. And=20

so Demetrius, when he saw that he had been baffled by the wisdom of Diognet=
us, withdrew with=20

his fleet.  8. Then the Rhodians, freed from the war by the cunning of Diog=
netus, thanked him=20

publicly, and decorated him with all honours and distinctions. Diognetus br=
ought that helepolis into=20

the city, set it up in a public place, and put on it an inscription: "Diogn=
etus out of the spoils of the=20

enemy dedicated this gift to the people." Therefore, in works of defence, n=
ot merely machines, but,=20

most of all, wise plans must be prepared.  9. Likewise at Chios, when the e=
nemy had prepared=20

storming bridges on their ships, the Chians, by night, carried out earth, s=
and, and stones into the=20

sea before their walls. So, when the enemy, on the next day, tried to appro=
ach the walls, their=20

ships grounded on the mound beneath the water, and could not approach the w=
all nor withdraw,=20

but pierced with fire-darts were burned there. Again, when Apollonia was be=
ing besieged, and the=20

enemy were thinking, by digging mines, to make their way within the walls w=
ithout exciting=20

suspicion, and this was reported by scouts to the people of Apollonia, they=
 were much disturbed=20

and alarmed by the news, and having no plans for defence, they lost courage=
, because they could=20

not learn either the time or the definite place where the enemy would come =
out.  10. But at this=20

time Trypho, the Alexandrine architect, was there. He planned a number of c=
ountermines inside=20

the wall, and extending them outside the wall beyond the range of arrows, h=
ung up in all of them=20

brazen vessels. The brazen vessels hanging in one of these mines, which was=
 in front of a mine of=20

the enemy, began to ring from the strokes of their iron tools. So from this=
 it was ascertained where=20

the enemy, pushing their mines, thought to enter. The line being thus found=
 out, he prepared=20



kettles of hot water, pitch, human excrement, and sand heated to a glow. Th=
en, at night, he=20

pierced a number of holes, and pouring the mixture suddenly through them, k=
illed all the enemy=20

who were engaged in this work.  11. In the same manner, when Marseilles was=
 being besieged,=20

and they were pushing forward more than thirty mines, the people of Marseil=
les, distrusting the=20

entire moat in front of their wall, lowered it by digging it deeper. Thus a=
ll the mines found their=20

outlet in the moat. In places where the moat could not be dug they construc=
ted, within the walls, a=20

basin of enormous length and breadth, like a fish pond, in front of the pla=
ce where the mines were=20

being pushed, and filled it from wells and from the port. And so, when the =
passages of the mine=20

were suddenly opened, the immense mass of water let in undermined the suppo=
rts, and all who=20

were within were overpowered by the mass of water and the caving in of the =
mine.  12. Again,=20

when a rampart was being prepared against the wall in front of them, and th=
e place was heaped=20

up with felled trees and works placed there, by shooting at it with the bal=
listae red-hot iron bolts=20

they set the whole work on fire. And when a ram-tortoise had approached to =
batter down the wall,=20

they let down a noose, and when they had caught the ram with it, winding it=
 over a drum by turning=20

a capstan, having raised the head of the ram, they did not allow the wall t=
o be touched, and  1.F.5.=20

INTRODUCTION.   THE terms FORENSIC MEDICINE, LEGAL MEDICINE, and MEDICAL=20

JURISPRUDENCE have heretofore been used interchangeably to apply to those b=
ranches of=20

state medicine and of jurisprudence which have to deal with the application=
s of medical knowledge=20



to the elucidation of questions of fact in courts of law, and with the lega=
l regulation of the practice=20

of medicine.  MEDICO-LEGAL SCIENCE therefore includes all subjects concerni=
ng which=20

members of the legal and medical professions may seek information of one an=
other, each acting=20

in his professional capacity. It consists of two distinct branches: that tr=
eating of medical law, to=20

which the designation of MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE properly applies; and that r=
elating to the=20

application of medical, surgical, or obstetrical knowledge to the purposes =
of legal trials,=20

FORENSIC MEDICINE.[1]  The term STATE MEDICINE, which is sometimes erroneou=
sly used as=20

synonymous with forensic medicine, properly applies to a more extended fiel=
d of medical inquiry;=20

_i.e._, to all applications of medical knowledge to the public welfare. Sta=
te medicine, therefore,=20

while excluding medical jurisprudence, includes, besides forensic medicine,=
 public hygiene,=20

medical ethics, medical education, and military and naval medicine.  TOXICO=
LOGY, the science=20

of poisons, may be divided into _medical toxicology_, whose object is the p=
revention or cure of all=20

forms of poisoning, and _forensic toxicology_, whose aim is the detection o=
f criminal poisoning. In=20

its last-named relation toxicology differs from forensic medicine in one im=
portant particular. In all=20

cases other than those of poisoning in which questions involving medical kn=
owledge arise, the=20

answers are entirely within the functions of the physician, the surgeon, or=
 the obstetrician, but the=20

problems of forensic toxicology require for their solution the further aid =
of the chemist and the=20

pharmacologist.  Forensic medicine is an applied science, partly legal, par=
tly medical, calling for=20

information and investigation in widely divergent lines, and becoming more =
minutely ramified with=20

the progressive advances in medical knowledge and in those sciences of whic=
h medicine is itself=20

an application. Its development has been dependent partly upon the slow tho=
ugh progressive=20

tendency of medicine from the condition of an empirical art toward that of =
an exact science, and=20

partly upon the more rapid and more advanced development of criminal jurisp=
rudence. Medical=20

jurisprudence had reached a high development during the early history of th=
e Roman Empire, and=20

at a period long anterior to the first recognition of forensic medicine.  A=
lthough the literature of=20

modern medico-legal science is very largely written from the medical point =
of view and by=20

physicians, its earlier history is to be found in fragmentary form, partly =
in medical literature, but=20

principally=20


_
they destroyed the entire machine by glowing fire-darts and the blows of ba=
llistae. Thus by such=20

victory, not by machines but in opposition to the principle of machines, ha=
s the freedom of states=20

been preserved by the cunning of architects.  Such principles of machines a=
s I could make clear,=20

and as I thought most serviceable for times of peace and of war, I have exp=
lained in this book. In=20

the nine earlier books I have dealt with single topics and details, so that=
 the entire work contains=20

all the branches of architecture, set forth in ten books.                  =
  FINIS         *       *       *       *=20

*    SCAMILLI IMPARES (BOOK III, ch. 4)        No passage in Vitruvius has =
given rise to so much=20

discussion or      been the subject of such various interpretations as this=
 phrase.      The most=20

reasonable explanation of its meaning seems to be that of      Emile Burnou=
f, at one time Director=20

of the French School at Athens,      published in the _Revue Generale del' =
Architecture_ for 1875,=20

as a      note to a brief article of his on the explanation of the curves o=
f      Greek Doric buildings.=20

This explanation was accepted by Professor      Morgan, who called my atten=
tion to it in a note=20

dated December 12,      1905. It has also quite recently been adopted by Pr=
ofessor Goodyear=20

in his interesting book on _Greek Refinements_.       Burnouf would transla=
te it _nivelettes=20

inegales_, "unequal      levellers." He states that in many parts of France=
 in setting a      long=20

course of cut stone the masons make use of a simple device      consisting =
of three pointed blocks=20

of equal height used as      levellers, of which two are placed one at each=
 extremity of the=20

course, while the third is used to level the stones, as they are      succe=
ssively set in place, by=20

setting it upon the stone to be set      and sighting across the other two =
levellers. If two "levellers"=20

of      equal height are used with a third of less height placed at the    =
  centre of the course, with=20

perhaps others of intermediate height      used at intermediate points, it =
would obviously be equally=20

easy to      set out a curved course, as, for instance, the curved stylobat=
e of      the Parthenon=20

which rises about three inches in its length of one      hundred feet. By a=
 simple calculation any=20

desired curve could be      laid out in this way. The word scamillus is a d=
iminutive of=20

_scamnum_, a mounting-block or bench.       Practically the same explanatio=
n is given by G.=20

Georges in a memoir      submitted to the Sorbonne in April, 1875. Georges =
adds an      interesting=20

list, by no means complete, of the various explanations      that have been=
 offered at different=20

times.  Philander (1522-1552). Projections of the stylobate or pedestals.  =
Barbaro (1556-1690).=20

The same.  Bertano (1558).        Swellings of the die of the stylobate or =
bosses                        in=20

the stylobate or the frieze of the                        entablature.  Bal=
dus (1612).         Sub-plinths=20

placed under the bases of the columns.  Perrault (1673-1684).  Projection o=
f the stylobate.  Polleni=20

(1739).        The same.  Galiani (1758-1790).   Projection of the stylobat=
e with hypothesis of=20

embossments on the stylobates and the bases of                        the c=
olumns.  Tardieu and=20

Coussin (1837) and Mauffras (1847). Projection of the stylobates.  Aures (1=
865).          Steps or=20

offsets between the stylobate and the columns.       The list of Georges is=
 wholly French and=20

Italian.       Fra Giocondo's interpretation is indicated in our reproducti=
on of      the illustration in his=20

edition of 1511.       Hoffer (1838) and afterwards Pennethorne (1846) and =
Penrose (1851)=20

gave measurements showing the curvatures in the Parthenon and the      temp=
le of Theseus in=20

Athens. Penrose and most writers who followed      him supposed the "scamil=
li impares" to be=20

projections or offsets on      the stylobate required on account of the cur=
ves to bring the column=20

into relation with the architraves above, and similar offsets of      unequ=
al or sloping form were=20

supposed to be required above the      abaci of the capitals, but such offs=
ets, although sometimes=20



existing, have no obvious connection with the passage in Vitruvius.      C.=
 Boetticher (1863) and=20

more recently Durm have denied the original      intention of the curves an=
d ascribe them to=20

settlement, a      supposition which hardly accords with the earlier crimin=
al codes, and in the early=20

records of legal proceedings.  In the earliest historical periods the funct=
ions now exercised by the=20

priest, the lawyer, and the physician were performed by the same person, wh=
o, presumably, made=20

use of what medical knowledge he possessed in the exercise of his legal fun=
ctions. Among the=20

Egyptians at a very early period it is certain that medical questions of fa=
ct were considered in legal=20

proceedings, and that the practice of medicine was subject to legal regulat=
ion. According to=20

Diodorus,[2] =E2=80=9Cwhen a pregnant woman was condemned to death, the sen=
tence was not executed=20

until after she was delivered.=E2=80=9D The same author tells us[3] that =
=E2=80=9Cthe physicians regulated the=20

treatment of the sick according to written precepts, collected and transmit=
ted by the most=20

celebrated of their predecessors. If, in following exactly these precepts w=
hich are contained in the=20

sacred books, they did not succeed in curing the sick, they could not be re=
proached, nor could=20

they be prosecuted at law; but if they have proceeded contrary to the text =
of the books, they are=20

tried, and may be condemned to death, the legislator supposing that but few=
 persons will ever be=20

found capable of improving a curative method preserved during so long a suc=
cession of years and=20

adopted by the most expert masters of the art.=E2=80=9D With the system of =
legal trial in use among the=20

Egyptians[4] it is difficult to imagine that the question of the existence =
of pregnancy in the one=20

case, or of malpractice in the other, would not be the subject of contest, =
and, if contested,=20

determined without the testimony of obstetricians or of physicians.[5]  Med=
ical knowledge among=20

the Hindoos was further advanced than among the Egyptians. In the Rig Veda =
(about 1500 B.C.)=20

occur a few medical references, among which is the statement that the durat=
ion of pregnancy is=20

ten (lunar) months.  The earliest purely medical Sanskrit texts are the Ayu=
r Vedas of Ch=C3=A2raka and=20

S=C3=BBsruta, which were probably written about 600 B.C., but which are und=
oubtedly compilations of=20

information which had been handed down during many centuries before that ti=
me. In each of these=20

is a section devoted to poisons and their antidotes (Kalpa), in which it is=
 written that a knowledge=20

of poisons and antidotes is necessary to the physician =E2=80=9Cbecause the=
 enemies of the Rajah, bad=20

women, and ungrateful servants sometimes mix poison with the food.=E2=80=9D=
 Full directions are also=20

given for the recognition of a person who gives poison, and to differentiat=
e the poisons=20

themselves, whose number, from all the kingdoms of nature, is legion. The a=
ge at which women=20

may marry is fixed at twelve years, while men may not marry before twenty-f=
ive. The duration of=20

pregnancy is given as between nine and twelve lunar months, the average bei=
ng ten. The practice=20

of medicine is restricted to certain castes, and requires the sanction of t=
he Rajah, and the method=20

of education of medical students is prescribed.[6]  It is singular that the=
 Greeks were apparently=20

destitute of any knowledge of legal medicine. Although medicine and jurispr=
udence were highly=20

developed among them, allusions to any connection between the two are of ve=
ry rare occurrence=20

and uncertain.  The Hippocratic writings (_ca._ 420 B.C.) contain many fact=
s which are of medico-

legal interest: the possibility of superf=C5=93tation was recognized;[7] th=
e average duration of=20

pregnancy was known, and the viability of children born before term was dis=
cussed,[8] the relative=20

fatality of wounds affecting different parts of the body was considered,[9]=
 and the Hippocratic oath=20

makes the physician swear that he =E2=80=9Cwill not administer or advise th=
e use of poison, nor contribute=20

to an abortion.=E2=80=9D The position of the physician in Greek communities=
 was an exalted one. No slave=20



or woman might be taught medicine,[10] although later free-born women were =
permitted to=20

practise in their native places. Homer also refers to physicians as men of =
learning and of=20

distinction.[11] The Greek physician was therefore in a position, both from=
 his information and from=20

his standing in the community, to aid in the administration of justice.  Th=
e Greeks were also=20

extremely litigious and possessed a code of criminal procedure which was el=
aborate, and in many=20

respects resembled those now in use in England and the United States.[12] T=
he writings of the=20

Greek orators, Demosthenes, =C3=86schines, Lysias, Antiphon, Isocrates, etc=
., which have come down=20

to us substantiate=20


_
the note on this passage in his translation of Vitruvius (1865),      think=
s the scamilli were sloping=20

offsets on the stylobate to cause      the inclination of the columns, but =
admits that nothing of the=20

kind      has been found in the remains so far examined. It may be added th=
at      this is at variance=20

with the statement of the purpose of the      scamilli which Vitruvius give=
s.       Assuming, as I think=20

we must, that the horizontal curvature of the      stylobate in such buildi=
ngs as the Parthenon was=20

intended and      carefully planned, Burnouf's explanation fits the case pr=
ecisely      and makes this=20

passage of Vitruvius straightforward and simple.      This can be said of n=
o other explanation, for=20

all the others leave      the passage obscure and more or less nonsensical.=
 Durm's attempt to=20

refer the passage to the case of the temple with a podium which has      ju=
st been spoken of by=20

Vitruvius is somewhat forced, or at least      unnecessary. Clearly the pas=
sage refers to stylobates=20

in general;      but Reber also so translates and punctuates as to make the=
 use of      the "scamilli=20

impares" refer only to the case of temples built in      the Roman manner w=
ith the podium. His=20

resulting explanation still      leaves the passage obscure and unsatisfact=
ory. One may finally=20

refer to the ingenious but improbable explanation of Choisy, who      trans=
lates it echelons impairs,=20

and explains them as offsets      arranged according to the odd numbers, _n=
ombres impairs_, i. e.,=20

offsets varying at equal intervals in the proportion of 1, 3, 5, 7,      9,=
 etc., and which he claims was=20

applied also to the entasis of      columns.       H. L. WARREN.      INDEX=

=E2=80=9Cto Athens mankind is indebted for the olive, the fig, and the admi=
nistration of justice.=E2=80=9D[13]  The=20

writings of the Greek physicians contain no reference to any legal applicat=
ion of their knowledge,=20

and certain passages in the writings of the orators seem to indicate that, =
while a physician was=20

called to inspect and treat a wounded person, the testimony as to the patie=
nt=E2=80=99s condition was given=20

in court by others.  Thus in the case against Euergos and Mnesibulus, in wh=
ich an old woman had=20

died some days after an assault, Demosthenes[14] states that he notified th=
e accused to bring a=20

surgeon and cure the woman; but that as they did not do so, he himself brou=
ght his own surgeon=20

and showed him her condition in the presence of witnesses. Upon hearing fro=
m the surgeon that=20

the woman was in a hopeless condition, he again explained her state to the =
accused and required=20

them to find medical aid. Finally, on the sixth day after the assault the w=
oman died. He further=20

asserts that these statements would be proved by the depositions.[15]  The =
third Tetralogy of=20

Antiphon[16] (B.C. 480) relates to a case in which the defence was essentia=
lly the same as that=20

which was the subject of a vast amount of medical expert testimony in a cel=
ebrated trial for murder=20

 afterward. The=20

assailant is accused of murder and sets up the defence that the deceased pe=

wounds inflicted, but in consequence of unskilful treatment by the physicia=

cases is any mention made of physicians having been called upon for testimo=

statements would lead to the inference that they were not. In another case =
