 Indian villages=20

Although the laws of the Indias endeavor to establish firmly the peace and =
good government, both=20

temporal and spiritual, of the villages by placing limits to their extent a=
nd the number of their=20

residents, the inattention of the governors of Filipinas in regard to this =
so important subject, on the=20

one hand, and on the other the interested motives of the parish curas and t=
he ministers of the=20

doctrinas, have given rise to the abuse of the villages of excessive size w=
hich are now found=20

established in Filipinas. These, as they cannot be properly governed by the=
ir respective local=20

authorities, maintain within themselves a source of internal civil discord,=
 and from time to time they=20

have broken out in disturbances which have placed the islands in a very cri=
tical situation.  If the=20

reports of their population be examined, it will be found that in a great n=
umber of villages it does=20

not fall below 10,000, 11,000, or 12,000 souls; and it is impossible that s=
o many can be well=20

directed spiritually by the one parish cura alone which each village has, o=
r in the right, the other on=20

the left. There was left a ridge so narrow at the top one could not keep hi=
s balance on it. Santa=20

Cristena was hurled from the top of a sandy hill into the valley beneath. O=
ut of three hundred and=20

seventy-five towns and villages, three hundred and twenty were destroyed. T=
wo hundred and=20

fifteen lakes and morasses were created by displacements of the ground and =
blocking of water-

courses. The pestilence bred by these vied with the direct power of the ear=
thquake.  Some slight=20

disturbance was manifested on the day before the great shock. Prince Scylla=
, an old man, warned=20

his people to take to their boats, and himself set the example. When the fi=
rst shock came, many of=20

these people were sleeping in their boats near the shore, while the others =
were on the shore at a=20

little place elevated above  [Illustration: THE DISASTER OF SCYLLA.]  the s=
ea. With this=20

convulsion the earth rocked, and suddenly there was precipitated a great ma=
ss of rock from Mount=20

Jaci on the plain where the people had taken refuge; and immediately after =
the water arose to a=20

great height above its ordinary level and swept away the sleeping multitude=

_
alcalde. In this class of towns the most notable are the following: Tondo, =
with 13,424 souls;=20

Binondoc, 22,570; Tambobo, 21,378; Pasig, 14,465; Malolos, 19,655; Vigan, 1=
7,320; Pavay,=20

14,840; Lavag [Laoag], 25,242; Bacarra, 13,064; Balayan, 18,631; Taal, 23,5=
26; Banan, 17,438;=20

Batangas, 19,566; Cabatuan, 17,359; Xaro, 14,911. In these populations whic=
h do not conform to=20

the rule there has always been recognized more or less instability, for the=
 class of the plebeians,=20

or caylianes, is immense, and out of proportion to that of the timauas, or =
nobles; and likewise=20

because the unarmed authority of a gobernadorcillo must necessarily be vaci=
llating, at the mercy=20

of that great mass of people, who are easily set in motion by a seditious p=
erson, a few drunkards,=20

or the superstitious tale of some old man.  The successive revolts of vario=
us towns in the province=20

of Ilocos in the years 1810, 1812, and 1816 had no other source. The cause =
of this last uprising=20

was decided by me, in my official character as fiscal of the royal Audienci=
a of Manila. In my reply I=20

explained the origin of those repeated insurrections, analyzed the degree o=
f perverseness which=20

progressively in each of them had been revealed in the purpose of the consp=
irators, and deduced=20

the necessity of again with increased violence, bringing back many of the p=
eople and animals=20

which it had carried away. At the same time every boat in the vicinity was =
overwhelmed, or dashed=20

against the beach, and thus destroyed. The Prince, who was an aged man, wit=
h thirteen hundred=20

of his people was swept away and perished in the sea. The total loss of lif=
e resulting from this=20

earthquake is estimated at eighty thousand. A shock which came on the 4th o=
f March was as=20

violent as the first one. Eleven hundred shocks were felt in two years.  Do=
ubtless not a few of=20

those who perished died merely from hunger or confinement. Quite a number o=
f those rescued=20

after several days were uninjured.  If it be true that prosperity shows men=
 in their true colors, the=20

reverse is equally marked. It is hard to believe the tales of barbarous inh=
umanity of the occasion.=20

Says Dolomieu: =E2=80=9CAs egotism and the instinct of self-preservation cr=
ushed all other feeling, no help=20

was brought to the unhappy victims buried beneath the ruins; yet many of th=
em might have been=20

rescued. When calm was restored, the lower orders, succumbing to the vilest=
 passions of nature,=20

thought of nothing but pillage.=E2=80=9D  Like a certain class of ghouls wh=
o follow in the wake of armies to=20

enrich themselves by plundering the=20


_
towns should each have a ruler closer at hand who might keep them in check.=
 The Audiencia=20

made a report, with my opinion as fiscal thereon to the king our sovereign;=
 and, his Majesty having=20

deigned to command that immediately the said province should be divided int=
o two, it has been=20

maintained on that footing, scouring the fallen ruins, braving imminent dan=
ger, and treading under=20

foot dying persons who appealed piteously for help, in order to go and plun=
der the houses of the=20

wealthy. They robbed  [Illustration: LISBON BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE.]  the ve=
ry injured, who=20

would have paid them handsomely for rescuing them. At=20

ct of the governors to=20

enforce the law that no houses shall be erected close to the castles and fo=
rtresses.] Within=20

cannon-shot of the walls of Manila, and even no farther away than the bread=
th of the river, one=20

hundred thousand souls--Indians, mestizos, and Chinese--have been allowed t=
o establish the=20

ruins of his house, and when his servant saw what had happened he actually =
stole the silver=20

buckles off his shoes, while his legs were in the air, and made off with th=
em. The unfortunate=20

gentleman managed, however, to rescue himself from his perilous position. F=
