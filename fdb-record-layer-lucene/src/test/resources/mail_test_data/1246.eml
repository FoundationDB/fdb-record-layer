The Hours passed by, through huddled cities loud     With witless hate and stale _
storm. Let us hope the world will find peace at the end of the rainbow, and more especially 

Germany. I won't come with you now, as I hate having to serve tea. Ask some of your soldier 

friends who are cleverer at it than I. I want to watch the sunset on the Rhine."  And Carlo and 

Bianca parted for a short time, yet thereafter many experiences and a number of years were to roll 

between them before Carlo and Bianca at last found happiness in each other.  At the same time 

Major Hersey and Charlotta were observing the curious effect of light over the river.  They had 

gone together to the edge of one of the cliffs and were gazing across at the great fortress of 

Ehrenbreitstein from whose tower the stars and stripes were floating. To them the rainbow 

seemed to dip down into the depth of this ancient fortress and lose itself in the shadows. 

"Whenever I am homesick to return to my own country, Countess   And if her phlox and 

mignonette     Have heart to blossom by their side;   I wonder if the dear old lane   Still chirps with 

robins after rain,   And if the birds and banded bees   Still rob her early cherry-trees....    I wonder, 

if I went there now,   How everything would seem, and how--   But no! not now; there is no way 

Back to the Land of Yesterday.     OCTOBER    CEASE to call him sad and sober,   Merriest of 

months, October!   Patron of the bursting bins,   Reveler in wayside inns,   I can nowhere find a 

trace   Of the pensive in his face;   There is mingled wit and folly,   But the madcap lacks the grace 

Of a thoughtful melancholy.   Spendthrift of the seasons' gold,   How he flings and scatters out 

Treasure filched from summer-time!--   Never ruffling squire of old   Better loved a tavern bout 

When Prince Hal was in his prime.   Doublet slashed with gold and green;   Cloak of

I simply stare across at the flag on that old German fortress and think what it represents," Major 

Hersey declared. "Then I am content to remain in Germany for as long as I am needed. A little 

thing, isn't it, to give a few months, or a few years, or whatever length of time may be necessary to 

teach Germany her lesson, when so many other men have given their lives that our flag be the 

flag of victory and a just peace!"  The young girl's face softened.  "I think you are a good soldier, 

Major Hersey. There is something I want to confide to you. I did write my father as you suggested 

and told him I would come home if he wished, only he must allow me to keep my freedom. His 

answer was what I expected. He does not desire to see me at present and says I am free to travel 

in the United States if I like. Only he adds that when I have seen more of the world perhaps I shall 

be more content to do my duty to my father. Not very clear, but I think I understand. My father 

really wishes to become reconciled with me, only not to seem to give in too readily. So I shall 

return home in a few months perhaps. Then if you are still in Coblenz and I write you, won't you 

come to Luxemburg? We have been such good friends and I hate saying goodby forever to people 

I like."  Major Jimmie Hersey shook his head, his brown eyes were steady and although the old 

boyish color had diffused his face, there was the firm line about his mouth and chin which his 

soldiers knew and respected.  "No, Countess Charlotta, I shall not come to see you in Luxemburg 

or elsewhere and this must be our goodby. I have no idea of leaving the United States army so 

long as I am allowed to remain in it. This means I will have nothing to offer you in the future, save 

what I have now, I believe you understand."  The Countess Charlotta nodded.  "Yes, I understand. 

Goodby, yet nevertheless I shall look forward to our meeting again."            *       *       *       *       * 

Transcriber's note:    Of the dews that gem his breast;   Frosty lace about his throat;    Scarlet 

plumes that flaunt and float   Backward in a gay unrest--   Where's another gallant drest   With 

such tricksy gaiety,   Such unlessoned vanity?   With his amber afternoons   And his pendant 

poets' moons--   With his twilights dashed with rose   From the red-lipped afterglows--   With his 

vocal airs at dawn   Breathing hints of Helicon--   Bacchanalian bees that sip   Where his cider-

presses drip--   With the winding of the horn   Where his huntsmen meet the morn--   With his 

every piping breeze   Shaking from familiar trees   Apples of Hesperides--   With the chuckle, 

chirp, and trill   Of his jolly brooks that spill   Mirth in tangled madrigals   Down pebble-dappled 

waterfalls--   (Brooks that laugh and make escape   Through wild arbors where the grape 

Purples with a promise of   Racy vintage rare as love)--   With his merry, wanton air,   Mirth and 

vanity and folly   Why should he be made to bear   Burden of some melancholy   Song that 

swoons and sinks with care?   Cease to call him sad or sober,--   He's a jolly dog, October! 

CHANT OF THE CHANGING HOURS    THE Hours passed by, a fleet, confused crowd;     With 

wafture of blown garments bright as fire,   Light, light of foot and laughing, morning-browed,     And 

where they trod the jonquil and the briar   Thrilled into jocund life, the dreaming dells   Waked to a 

morrice chime of jostled bells;--   They danced! they danced! to piping such as         flings   The 

garnered music of a million Springs     Into one single, keener ecstasy;--   One paused and 

shouted to my questionings:     "Lo, I am Youth; I bid thee follow me!"    The Hours passed by; they 

paced, great lords and         proud,     Crowned on with sunlight, robed in rich attire;   Before their 

conquering word the brute deed         bowed,     And Ariel fancies served their large desire;    They 

spake, and roused the mused soul that dwells   In dust,

plumed Thought that soars and sings:     Lo, I am Song; I bid thee follow me!"    The Hours passed 

by, with veiled eyes endowed     Of dream, and parted lips that scarce suspire,   To breathing dusk 

and arrowy moonlight vowed,     South wind and shadowy grove and murmuring         lyre;-- 

Swaying they moved, as drows'd of wizard spells   Or tranc'd with sight of recent miracles,   And 

yet they trembled, down their folded wings   Quivered the hint of sweet withholden things,     Ah,
