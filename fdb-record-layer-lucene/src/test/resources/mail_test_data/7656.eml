to his early period, about 1634, is the "Man with a Helmet," also commonly =
known as a self-

portrait, fluent in execution and vivacious and lifelike in expression, yet=
 not without that hint of=20

conscious pose common with the artist in his endeavors to force the note of=
 character. The blunt,=20

strong features are strikingly like those of the authenticated portraits of=
 the artist, but Dr. Karl Voll,=20

Director of the Alt Pinakothek at Munich, declares that the idea of a "self=
-portrait," attractive as it=20

is, can hardly in this case be upheld. Whoever the sitter may have been, th=
e painting is an=20

amazing example of dexterity of hand and acute observation. The sharp glitt=
er of the helmet, the=20

contrasting flesh-like quality of the painting in the face, the light vigor=
ous drawing of the moustache=20

and hair, give an impression of the artist's mastery of his craft hardly to=
 be surpassed at any=20

period of his life. Far less poetic in its color-scheme and chiaro-oscuro t=
han the youthful portrait=20

belonging to Mrs. Gardiner's collection, it is even more eloquent of the ea=
se with which he=20

managed his tools. Of a still greater charm, with subtler problems met and =
solved, is the portrait of=20

Saskia van Ulenburgh, whom he married in Amsterdam in the year 1634, the pr=
obable date of the=20

Cassel portrait. At all events the young woman carries in her hand a spray =
of rosemary, the=20

symbol of betrothal, and her dress has the richness of a Dutch bride's equi=
pment. Here we see=20

Rembrandt's art in perhaps its most delicate and psychologically interestin=
g phase. The character=20

revealed by the small pretty features has neither extraordinary force nor m=
arked individuality. The=20

lines are neither deep-cut nor broad. One is reminded of a fine little etch=
ing in which the plate has=20

been bitten only to a moderate depth and which requires a sensitive handlin=
g in the printing to=20

produce anything like richness. Yet the result is rich in the fullest sense=
 of the term. It depends for=20

its quality not only upon the splendid color-scheme formed by the dark red =
of the velvet hat and=20

gown, the white of the feather, the gold and gray and dull blue of the trim=
mings and ornaments,=20

the beautiful jewels, with which Rembrandt then as later produced an appear=
ance of great=20

magnificence, the bright red-gold of the hair falling lightly over the soft=
ly modeled brow, and the=20

fair warm tones of the flesh glowing as from living health and physical ene=
rgy: it depends as much=20

upon the deep research into the expression that has resulted in the intimat=
e portraiture possible=20

only to genius and seldom found even in the work of the great masters, neve=
r, so far as the=20

writer's observation has gone, in the work of their later years. The smile =
that hesitates at the=20

corner of the whimsical little mouth, the tender modulations of surface on =
the forehead and about=20

the straight-gazing honest eyes, the swift suggestions of movement and play=
 of mood in the=20

flexible contours, the gaiety and sweetness and singular purity of the girl=
ish face, are evoked with=20

magisterial authority and precision. Never surely has there been a finer ex=
ample of Dutch care and=20

thoroughness in the observation and rendering of minute detail united to br=
eadth of effect. The=20

painting of the jewels and embroideries is wrought to a singularly perfect =
finish. It is almost as=20

though the artist had set himself to extract the utmost beauty of which the=
 textures of stuffs and=20

gems are capable, to prove how much more enchanting was the beauty of the b=
rilliant blond=20

demure little face daintily poised above them. Dr. Bode calls the picture "=
one of the most=20

attractive, not only of his early pictures, but of all his works."  [Illust=
ration: Courtesy of Berlin=20

Photographic Company.  SASKIA  _From a portrait by Rembrandt_]  To Rembrand=
t's early years=20

also are ascribed certain careful studies of old men's heads and several po=
rtraits of younger men.=20

Among these are one of the writing-master Coppenol and one of the poet Krul=
, the former painted=20

in 1632, the latter in 1633. The Krul portrait is the more striking of the =
two, and the pictorial=20



costume with the broad hat casting its lucent shadow over the fine brow, th=
e silken jacket with its=20

gleaming reflections and the wide white ruffles at neck and sleeve on which=
 the light blazes full,=20

adds to the dignity and richness of the effect. It is easy, however, to agr=
ee with Dr. Voll in ranking=20

the splendid portrait of an unknown man, of some five or six years later da=
te, far above the Krul=20

portrait in artistic quality. Although excessively warm in tone it has in a=
ddition to excellent=20

construction and a lifelike aspect a nobility of bearing that imposes itsel=
f directly and irresistibly=20

upon the spectator.  The portrait of Coppenol is not easily analyzed and Dr=
. Bode notes that the=20

likeness to the authenticated portraits of the famous drawing master is not=
 altogether convincing.=20

Simpler and homelier in appearance than the portrait of Krul, this solid an=
d even heavy figure=20

seated comfortably in an armchair, the well-drawn hands busy with mending a=
 quill pen, the=20

glance reflective, but hardly thoughtful, the mouth under the small fair mo=
ustache slightly=20

indeterminate, the head covered with short hair, the smooth fat face three-=
quarters in light,=20

presents at first glance a commonplace aspect enough. But returning to it f=
rom the Krul or even=20

from the more masterly later portrait, the spectator is certain to be deepl=
y impressed by the quiet=20

yet searching execution that takes account of every significant change in p=
lane or outline in the=20

large cheek and full chin. From the very commonplace of the pose and type o=
ne gains a special=20

pleasure, since the power of the artist to irradiate an ordinary subject is=
 the more clearly seen. The=20

serene light enveloping the good head and falling gently on the background =
brings no thought of=20

method or pigment to the mind, and the fleshlike quality of the face and ha=
nds is as near imitation=20

of reality as is possible within the bounds of synthetic art. It is easy to=
 agree with Dr. Bode's=20

opinion that the homely simple portraits painted in ordinary costume and un=
der ordinary conditions=20

of light during Rembrandt's first three years in Amsterdam are intellectual=
ly more worth while than=20

the earlier more personal works. The theory is that he turned them out in c=
ompetition with his=20

contemporaries and eclipsed them on their own ground.  The portrait of "Rem=
brandt's Father in=20

Indoor Dress," of the preceding year (1631), is in a quite different manner=
, and closely resembles=20

the painting in Boston of an old man with downcast eyes, from the same mode=
l. The bald head=20

and scanty beard, the wrinkled face and slightly uncertain mouth, are famil=
iar to all students of=20

Rembrandt's art. In 1631 Rembrandt was still in his father's house and one =
gains some notion of=20

the old miller's amiability from the frequency with which he appeared in et=
chings and paintings and=20

the variety of the poses which he took on behalf of his ardent son, adjusti=
ng his expression to his=20

assumed character with no little dramatic skill. Never in his later years d=
id Rembrandt so delicately=20

render the patience and discipline of age. In this alert, unprepossessing y=
et kindly face we can=20

read a not too fanciful history of the temperament of the sitter. We see, a=
t all events, the mark of a=20

sympathetic mind.  The next picture in the collection to mark a special per=
iod and one of brilliant=20

achievement in Rembrandt's career is the so-called "Woodcutter's Family," b=
elonging to the=20

decade between 1640 and 1650. After an old fashion the Holy Family is repre=
sented as seen in a=20

painting before which a curtain is partly drawn. The mother sits by the sid=
e of a cradle from which=20

she has lifted the child who clings to her neck while she presses him to he=
r in a close embrace. In=20

the farther corner of the room is the figure of the father in his carpenter=
's apron, and in the center a=20

cat is crouching near some dishes on the floor. The room is filled with a m=
ild sunlight that filters=20

through the air and falls across the figures of the mother and child and ac=
ross the broad expanse=20

of floor. The simplicity and poetic feeling in lighting and gesture are wor=
thy of Rembrandt's prime,=20



and there is no trace of the extreme drama that marks the religious composi=
tions at shot down=20

with many others; but the Mexicans had done their worst. With steady aim, t=
he volley was=20

returned; and ere the smoke rose a cheer rang through the ravine and Riley =
fell with a swoop on=20

the intrenchments. With bayonet and butt of musket, the Second and Seventh =
drove the enemy=20

from his guns, leaping into his camp and slaughtering all before them. Up r=
ushed Smith=E2=80=99s own=20

brigade on the left, driving a party of Mexicans before them, and charging =
with the bayonet straight=20

at Torrejon=E2=80=99s cavalry, which was drawn up in order of battle. Defea=
t was marked on their faces.=20

Valencia was nowhere to be found. Salas strove vainly to rouse his men to d=
efend themselves=20

with energy; Torrejon=E2=80=99s horse, smitten with panic, broke and fled a=
t the advance of our infantry.=20

Riley hurled the Mexicans from their camp after a struggle of a quarter of =
an hour; and as they=20

rushed down the ravine their own cavalry rode over them, trampling down mor=
e men than the=20

bayonet and ball had laid low. On the right, as they fled, Cadwalader=E2=80=
=99s brigade poured in a=20

destructive volley; and Shields, throwing his party across the road, obstru=
cted their retreat and=20

compelled the fugitives to yield themselves prisoners of war; The only figh=
t of any moment had=20

taken place within the camp. There, for a few minutes, the Mexicans had fou=
ght desperately; two=20

of our regimental colors had been shot down; but finally Anglo-Saxon bone a=
nd sinew had=20

triumphed. To the delight of the assailants, the first prize of victory was=
 the guns O=E2=80=99Brien had=20

abandoned at Buena Vista, which were regained by his own regiment. Twenty o=
ther guns and=20

over one thousand prisoners, including eighty-eight officers and four gener=
als, were likewise=20

captured, and some fifteen hundred Mexicans killed and wounded. The America=
n loss in killed,=20

wounded, and missing was about one hundred men.  Barely taking time to brea=
the his troops,=20

Smith followed in pursuit toward the city. By ten o=E2=80=99clock in the mo=
rning he reached San Angel,=20

which Santa Anna evacuated as he approached. The general-in-chief and the g=
enerals of division=20

had by this time relieved Smith of his command; Scott rode to the front, an=
d in a few brief words=20

told the men there was more work to be done that day. A loud cheer from the=
 ranks was the reply.=20

The whole force then advanced to Coyacan, within a mile of Churubusco, and =
prepared to assault=20

the place.   CHURUBUSCO  Santa Anna considered it the key to the city, and =
awaited the attack=20

in perfect confidence with thirty thousand men. The defences were of a very=
 simple description.=20

On the west, in the direction of Coyacan, stood the large stone convent of =
San Pablo, in which=20

seven heavy guns were mounted, and which, as well as the wall and breastwor=
ks in front, was=20

filled with infantry. A breastwork connected San Pablo with the _t=C3=AAte =
de pont_ over the=20

Churubusco River, four hundred yards distant. This was the easternmost poin=
t of defence, and=20

formed part of the San Antonio causeway leading to the city. It was a work =
constructed with the=20

greatest skill--bastions, curtain, and wet ditch, everything was complete a=
nd perfect--four guns=20

were mounted in embrasure and barbette, and as many men as the place would =
hold were=20

stationed there. The reserves occupied the causeway behind Churubusco. Inde=
pendently of his=20

defences, Santa Anna=E2=80=99s numbers--nearly five to one--ought to have i=
nsured the repulse of the=20

assailants.  By eleven--hardly seven hours having elapsed since the Contrer=
as camp had been=20

stormed, five miles away--Twiggs and Pillow were in motion toward the San A=
ntonio causeway.=20

Nothing had been heard of Worth, who had been directed to move along the ea=
st side of the=20

Pedregal on San Antonio; but it was taken for granted he had carried the po=
int, and Scott wished=20

to cut off the retreat of the garrison. Twiggs was advancing cautiously tow=
ard the convent, when a=20



heavy firing was heard in advance. Supposing that a reconnoitring party had=
 been attacked, he=20

hastily sent forward the First Artillery, under Dimmick, through a field of=
 tall corn, to support them.=20

No sooner had they separated from the main body than a terrific discharge o=
f grape, canister, and=20

musketry assailed them from the convent. In the teeth of the storm they adv=
anced to within one=20

hundred yards of that building, and a light battery under Taylor was brough=
t up on their right and=20

opened on the convent. Over an hour the gunners stood firm to their pieces =
under a fire as terrible=20

as troops ever endured; one-third of the command had fallen before they wer=
e withdrawn. Colonel=20

Riley meanwhile, with the stormers of Contreras, had been despatched to ass=
ail San Pablo on the=20

west, and, like Dimmick, was met by a murderous rain of shot. Whole heads o=
f companies were=20

mowed down at once. Thus Captain Smith fell, twice wounded, with every man =
beside him; and a=20

single discharge from the Mexican guns swept down Lieutenant Easley and the=
 section he led. It=20

was the second time that day the gallant Second had served as targets for t=
he Mexicans, but not a=20

man fell back. General Smith ordered up the Third in support, and these, pr=
otecting themselves as=20

best they could behind a few huts, kept up a steady fire on the convent. Sa=
llies from the works=20

were constantly made and as constantly repulsed, but not a step could the a=
ssailants make in=20

advance.  By this time the battle was raging on three different points. Wor=
th had marched on San=20

Antonio that morning, found it evacuated, and given chase to the Mexicans w=
ith the Fifth and Sixth=20

Infantry. The causeway leading from San Antonio to the _t=C3=AAte de pont_ =
of Churubusco was=20

thronged with flying horse and foot; our troops dashed headlong after them,=
 never halting till the=20

advance corps--the Sixth--were within short range of the Mexican batteries.=
 A tremendous volley=20

from the _t=C3=AAte de pont_ in front and the convent on the flank then for=
ced them to await the arrival=20

of the rest of the division. This was the fire which Twiggs heard when he s=
ent Dimmick against the=20

convent.  Worth came up almost immediately; and, directing the Sixth to adv=
ance as best they=20

could along the causeway in the teeth of the _t=C3=AAte de pont_, despatche=
d Garland and Clarke=E2=80=99s=20

brigades through the fields on the right to attack it in flank. Every gun w=
as instantly directed=20

against the assailants; and, though the day was bright and clear, the cloud=
s of smoke actually=20

darkened the air. Hoffman, waving his sword, cheered on the Sixth; but the =
shot tore and ripped=20

up their ranks to such a degree that in a few minutes they had lost ninety-=
seven men. The=20

brigades on the right suffered as severely. One hundred men fell within the=
 space of an acre. Still=20

they pressed on, till the Eighth (of Clarke=E2=80=99s brigade) reached the =
ditch. In they plunged, Lieutenant=20

Longstreet bearing the colors in advance--scrambled out on the other side--=
dashed at the walls,=20

without ladders or scaling implements--bayoneted the defenders as they took=
 aim. At last officers=20

and men, mixed pell-mell, some through the embrasures, some over the walls,=
 rushed or leaped in=20

and drove the garrison helter-skelter upon their reserves.  The _t=C3=AAte =
de pont_ gained, its guns=20

were turned on the convent, whence the Mexicans were still slaughtering our=
 gallant Second and=20

Third. Duncan=E2=80=99s battery, too, hitherto in reserve, was brought up, =
and opened with such rapidity=20

that a bystander estimated the intervals between the reports at three secon=
ds. Stunned by this=20

novel attack, the garrison of San Pablo slackened fire. In an instant the T=
hird, followed by=20

Dimmick=E2=80=99s artillery, dashed forward with the bayonet to storm the n=
earest bastion. With a run they=20

carried it, the artillery bursting over the curtain; but at that moment a d=
ozen white flags waved in=20

their faces. The whole fortified position of Churubusco was taken.  Meantim=
e, however, a conflict=20

as deadly as either of these was raging behind the Mexican fortifications. =
Soon after the battle=20



commenced, Scott sent Pierce and Shields=E2=80=99 brigades by the left, thr=
ough the fields, to attack the=20

enemy in the rear. On the causeway, opposed to them, were planted Santa Ann=
a=E2=80=99s reserves--four=20

thousand foot and three thousand horse--in a measure protected by a dense g=
rowth of maguey.=20

Shields advanced intrepidly with his force of sixteen hundred. The ground w=
as marshy, and for a=20


_
is beautiful and the tone mysterious. Nevertheless one misses the precious =
quality of the earlier=20

craftmanship as it shines in such lovely paintings as the "Saskia" and the =
"Portrait of a Young=20

Woman." In these the painter shows that he was still young, that he had arr=
ived at a skill of hand=20

that permitted him to use his medium with ease and certainty, but that he h=
ad not yet ceased to=20

attempt what lay just beyond his powers. His brush still sought out subtle =
refinements of modeling=20

with the patience that allied him to the earlier Dutch and Flemish masters.=
 He had, no doubt, the=20

instinctive feeling of ardent youth, the assumption of time ahead for the c=
arrying out of all projects,=20

and his brilliant manipulations of his pigment showed neither haste, nor as=
 yet the complete=20

confidence that leaves untold the detail of the story for the imagination o=
f the audience to supply.=20

He was not ready to sacrifice everything else to that light and atmosphere =
of which he made his=20

own world in his later years. Characteristic of his most winning use of thi=
s light that he created for=20

his own purposes is the portrait of Nicholas Bruyningh, Secretary of one of=
 the divisions of the=20

Courts of Justice at Amsterdam: one of the most salient and brilliant of th=
e Rembrandts in the=20

Cassel Gallery. This portrait belongs to the year 1652 when the artist was =
about forty-five years=20

old, and it is a superb example of matured genius. The subject offered an o=
pportunity for daring=20

handling and pictorial arrangement upon which Rembrandt seized with a full =
understanding of its=20

possibilities. The beautiful gay face with its suggestion of irresponsibili=
ty glows from a mist of=20

atmosphere that veils all minor detail, leaving in strong relief the mass o=
f curling hair, the smiling=20

dark eyes, the smiling mouth unconcealed by the slight moustache, the firml=
y modeled nose and=20

pliant chin, with the tasseled collar below catching the point of highest l=
ight. It is the poetry of good=20

humor, of physical beauty, of content with life and life's adventures. It a=
lso marks what Herr=20

Knackfuss calls Rembrandt's "softer manner" in which all sharp outlines of =
objects are effaced,=20

and the lights gleam from a general darkness. More than "The Sentinel," whi=
ch sometimes is given=20

as the starting point for this departure in style, it has the appearance of=
 a dramatic emergence=20

from shadow. From having been a painstaking craftsman Rembrandt at this tim=
e had become a=20

dramatist selecting from his material those elements best adapted to sway t=
he emotions. He has=20

lost himself--or found himself--in the expression of character; not merely =
character as one element=20

in a picture's interest, but character as _the_ element. In this picture of=
 Nicholas Bruyningh we=20

cannot escape from the merry careless temperament. We cannot as in the earl=
y portrait of Saskia=20

linger in dalliance over charming accessories and beautifully discriminated=
 textures until we reach=20

by moderate degrees the eloquence of the profoundly studied face. Bruyningh=
's face is like the=20

"_tirade_" of a French play--it is rendered at white heat and in one inconc=
eivably long breath. Its=20

significance is so intensified as to produce a profound feeling in a sympat=
hetic spectator.=20

m.  NICHOLAS=20

BRUYNINGH  _From a portrait by Rembrandt_]  If we compare it with the badly=
 named "Laughing=20

Cavalier" of Franz Hals we see clearly enough the difference between drama =
and realism. Drama=20

as defined by Robert Louis Stevenson consists not of incident but of passio=
n that must=20

progressively increase in order that the actor may be able to "carry the au=
dience from a lower to a=20

higher pitch of interest and emotion." This also defines Rembrandt's painti=
ng at all periods. As one=20

approaches the human face in his pictures one becomes aware of an emotional=
 quality that is=20

irresistible, and in a portrait like that of Bruyningh the emotional qualit=
y is almost isolated from=20

incident or detail. It is the great moment of the third act when the audien=
ce holds its breath.  "The=20



Standard Bearer" is not accepted by Dr. Bode as a fine work or even as cert=
ainly original, the=20

version of the same subject in Baron G. du Rothschild's collection having m=
ade much deeper an=20

impression upon him. The Cassel version is nevertheless a work of great dis=
tinction, the grave and=20

beautiful face and shining armor looking out of a luminous atmosphere that =
has more of the=20

Rembrandtesque quality than many authenticated works of Rembrandt's riper p=
eriod. The work is=20

engaging, personal, striking, and if not entirely great certainly possessed=
 of many of the qualities=20

of greatness.  While the Cassel collection does not contain any of the supe=
rb self portraits of=20

Rembrandt's later years, the one example in this kind having authority with=
out great interest, it=20

does include one biblical picture of unusual importance belonging to the ye=
ar 1656, the "Jacob=20

Blessing his Grandchildren," which is, however, unfinished. The square, dir=
ect brush strokes=20

suggest those of Hals, the drapery is thinly painted with a flowing medium,=
 the black shadows on=20

the face of Jacob cut sharply into the half tones, there is little discrimi=
nation in the textures and the=20

background comes forward. But the faces of the children are charming in cha=
racterization,=20

recalling the simple tenderness of the "Girl Leaning Out of the Window" at =
Dulwich, one of the=20

most enchanting embodiments of youth ever achieved by Rembrandt, and the wo=
man, Israelitish=20

in type, with large eyes and features rather abruptly defined, is an attrac=
tive attempt to realize=20

feminine beauty, a task in which Rembrandt was never dexterous, however.  O=
f the two=20

landscapes, that with the ruined castle is the most impressive, but neither=
 compares favorably with=20

the dainty perfection of the landscape etchings.  If we add to these exampl=
es the studies of old=20

men's heads and the delightful portrait of the artist's sister holding a pi=
nk in her hand, we realize=20

that the group as a whole covers many phases of Rembrandt's constantly chan=
ging inspiration. He=20

betrayed in his later works the impatience of those to whom few years are l=
eft in which to complete=20

their accomplishment, but he kept the sensitiveness of his youth well into =
his brief prime, although=20

he transferred it from the field of form to that of light. It betrays itsel=
f in the quality of that light=20

which absorbs all that is ugly, coarse, or ultra real in its poetizing glam=
our. From the tender explicit=20

craftsmanship of the wonderful Saskia to the golden mist enveloping the fig=
ure of Nicholas=20

Bruyningh, is a long step, but not longer than many a painter has taken in =
his progress from youth=20

to maturity. The special comment upon Rembrandt's character as a painter wh=
ich we are able to=20

gather from the Cassel pictures is that in casting off the trammels of part=
icularity he did not=20

become less receptive to poetic influences. He grew more and more a dreamer=
, and in losing the=20

clear objective manner of his early portraits he substituted not the idle c=
arelessness which in the=20

work of a painter's later years is apt to be condoned as freedom, but the g=
eneralization that=20

excludes vulgarities of execution and makes necessary increased mastery of =
the difficult craft of=20

painting.     FANTIN-LATOUR     VIII  FANTIN-LATOUR   Fantin-Latour was bor=
n in 1836, was the=20

son of a painter, and was educated at Paris under his father's guidance and=
 that of Lecoq and=20

Boisbaudeau, professor at a little art school connected with the Ecole des =
Beaux-Arts. One of the=20

most interesting painters of the little group in France whose work began to=
 come before the public=20

about the middle of the nineteenth century, a close friend of Whistler, a p=
assionate admirer of=20

Delacroix, and an inspired student of the old masters, he managed to preser=
ve intact an=20

individuality that has a singular richness and simplicity seen against the =
many-colored tapestry of=20

nineteenth-century art. Rubens, Velasquez, Rembrandt, Franz Hals, and Nicol=
aas Maas, Pieter de=20

Hooch and Vermeer of Delft, Watteau and Chardin, Van Dyck, Titian, Tintoret=
, and Veronese were=20



his true masters and his copies of their works are said by his enlightened =
critic, M. Arsene=20

Alexandre, to have a masterly quality of their own, to be far removed from =
the conventionality of=20

facsimiles, and to bear upon an underlying fidelity of transcription an imp=
ress of individual=20

sentiment. He sought to be faithful to the originals beyond external imitat=
ion, by seeking to render=20

the original tone of the painting in its first freshness, as it appeared be=
fore time and varnish had=20

yellowed and darkened it. He thus made himself familiar with the technical =
methods of the great=20

periods of painting, and, coming into his inheritance of modern ideas and i=
deals, he was able to=20

achieve a beauty of execution much too rarely sought by his contemporaries,=
 although his intimate=20

companions like himself frequented the Louvre with a considerable assiduity=
, spending upon the=20

old masters the enthusiasm which they withheld from the later academic scho=
ol of painting.  His=20

earlier subjects were largely Biblical and historical. He then passed to do=
mestic scenes and in=20

1859, 1861, and 1863 was painting his pictures of _Les Liseurs_ and _Les Br=
odeuses_ which=20

showed the charming face of his sister with her sensitive smiling mouth and=
 softly modeled brows,=20

and later that of his wife. At the Salon of 1859 he and Whistler both submi=
tted subjects drawn from=20

family life, Whistler his _At the Piano_ with his own sister and his niece,=
 little Annie Haden, for the=20

models, and Fantin his painting of young women embroidering and reading, on=
ly to have their=20

canvases refused. Fantin was not, however, a martyr to his predilections in=
 art. He early obtained=20

admission to the Salon although he had enough rejected work to permit him t=
o appear among the=20

painters exhibiting in the famous little "Salon des Refuses" of 1863. He re=
ceived medals and=20

official recognitions. But his modesty of taste led him to hold himself som=
ewhat apart and=20

exclusive among those who shared his likings. His portrait of himself, pain=
ted in 1858, shows a=20

dreamy young man with serious, almost solemn, eyes, sitting before his ease=
l, and looking into the=20

distance with the expression of one who sees visions.  As a matter of fact =
he did see visions and=20

attempted to fix them with his art. An ardent lover of music, he was eager =
to translate the emotions=20

aroused by it into the terms of his own art. As early as 1859 he was in Eng=
land, to which he=20

returned in 1861 and 1864, and while there he was surrounded by a group of =
people who shared=20

his enthusiasm for German music. There he first became familiar with Schuma=
nn's melodies, and=20

made the rare little etching representing his English friends, Mr. and Mrs.=
 Edwards, playing one of=20

Schumann's compositions, Edwards with his flute and Mrs. Edwards at the pia=
no. In 1862 he had=20

the very tempered satisfaction of finding that Wagner, already beloved by h=
im, had reached the=20

public taste through the labors of the courageous Pasdeloup. "I always regr=
et," he wrote to=20

Edwards, "seeing the objects of my adoration adored by others, especially b=
y the masses. I am=20

very jealous when I love."  In order to celebrate Wagner's triumph over the=
se masses, however, he=20

at once made the lithograph called _Venusberg_, from which sprang the very =
different oil version=20

of the same subject which together with the _Hommage a Delacroix_, the stor=
y of which M.=20

Benedite has recounted, was admitted to the Salon of 1864. Fantin's lithogr=
aphs, a number of=20

which are in the print room of the Lenox Library building in New York City,=
 show clearly his=20

preoccupation with music, and an interesting article on this phase of his t=
emperament appeared in=20

the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, September 15, 1906. Naturally a worshiper, he =
did not confine=20

himself to commemorating only the musicians who were his favorites. In lith=
ography and painting=20

he exalted such diverse heroes of the different arts as Stendhal, Hugo, Bau=
delaire, Delacroix,=20

Manet, Schumann, Weber, Berlioz, and Wagner. In 1877 his enthusiasm for Wag=
ner revived in his=20



work, and compositions based on the Ring music followed each other in rapid=
 succession.=20

Wolfram gazing at the evening star, or following with enchanted eyes Elizab=
eth's ghostly figure as=20

it moves slowly up the hill toward the towers of Wartburg; the Rhine maiden=
s playing with rhythmic=20

motions in the swirling waters, with Alberic, crouched in the foreground, w=
atching them; Sieglinde,=20

giving Siegmund to drink, as hounded and pursued he sinks at the door of Hu=
nding's dwelling; the=20

evocation of Kundry by Klingner; Siegfried blowing his horn and receding fr=
om the enticements of=20

the Rhine maidens--these are among the subjects that engaged him. It would =
be difficult to=20

describe his manner of interpretation. Quite without theatrical suggestion,=
 it combines a dramatic=20

use of dark and light and a feeling for palpable atmosphere hardly equaled =
by Rembrandt himself,=20

with a remarkably certain touch. Nothing could better emphasize the value o=
f technical drill to a=20

poetic temperament than these imaginative drawings. In them Fantin gives fu=
ll rein to his=20

emotional delight in tender visions and twilight dreams. The lovely rhythm =
of his lines, the rise and=20

fall of his sensitive shadows and lights that play and interplay in as stri=
ct obedience to law as the=20

waves of the sea, his delicate modeling by which he brings form out of nebu=
lous half-tones with=20

the slightest touches, the least discernible accents, the accurate bland dr=
awing, the ordered=20

composition, the subtle spacing, the innumerable indications of close obser=
vation of life--all these=20

qualities combine to give an impression of fantasy and reality so welded an=
d fused as to be=20

indistinguishable to the casual glance.  [Illustration: In the Brooklyn Art=
 Museum.  PORTRAIT OF=20

MME. MAITRE  _From a painting by Fantin-Latour_]  In spite of the assiduous=
 study of Dutch and=20

Italian masters, Fantin's work is characteristically French in both its fan=
tasy and its realism. Not=20

only the grace of the forms and the elegance of the gestures, but the senti=
ment of the composition=20

and the quality of the color, are undisguisedly Gallic. He is closer to Wat=
teau than to any other=20

painter but his firmer technic and more patient temperament give him an adv=
antage over the=20

feverish master of eighteenth-century idyls. His art throbs with a fuller l=
ife and in his airiest dreams=20

his world is made of a more solid substance. For melancholy he offers seren=
ity, for daintiness he=20

offers delicacy.  His technique, especially in his later work, is quite ind=
ividual in its character. He=20

models with short swift strokes of the brush--not unlike the brush work in =
some of Manet's=20

pictures. His pigment is rather dry and often almost crumbly in texture, bu=
t his values are so=20

carefully considered that this delicately ruffled surface has the effect of=
 casting a penumbra about=20

the individual forms, of causing them to swim in a thickened but fluent atm=
osphere, instead of=20

suggesting the rugosity of an ill-managed medium.  In his paintings of flow=
ers he found the best=20

possible expression for his subtle color sense. The letters written to him =
by Whistler in the sixties=20

show how fervently these paintings were admired by the American master of h=
armony, and also=20

how much good criticism came to him from his comrade whose enthusiasm for J=
apanese art=20

already was fully awakened.  As a portraitist, Fantin was peculiarly fortun=
ate. His exquisitely=20

painted flower studies, his pearly-toned beautifully drawn nudes, his litho=
graphs with their soft=20

darks and tender manipulations of line, his ambitious imaginative compositi=
ons, are none of them=20

so eloquent of his personality as his portraits with their absolute integri=
ty, their fine divination, and=20

their fluent technique. The portrait which we reproduce is of Madam Maitre,=
 was painted in 1882,=20

and was acquired by the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Scienc=
es in 1906. It=20

represents a woman of middle years with a sincere and thoughtful face and a=
 quiet bearing. The=20

felicities of Fantin's brush are seen in the way in which the silk sleeve f=
ollows the curve of the=20



round firm arm, and the soft lace of the bodice rests against the throat an=
d is relieved almost=20

without contrast of color against the white skin. The touches of pure pale =
blue in the fan and the=20

delicate tints of the rose are manifestations of the artist's restrained an=
d subtle management of=20

color, but above all there is a perfectly unassuming yet uncompromising ren=
dering of character.=20

There is nothing in the plain refined features that cries out for recogniti=
on of a temperament=20

astutely divined. to outflank the enemy--his advance was exposed to their w=
hole fire. Morgan, of=20

the Fifteenth, fell wounded. The New York regiment suffered fearfully, and =
their leader, Colonel=20

Burnett, was disabled. The Palmettos, of South Carolina, and the Ninth, und=
er Ransom, were as=20

severely cut up; and after a while all sought shelter in and about a large =
barn near the causeway.=20

Shields, in an agony at the failure of his movement, cried imploringly for =
volunteers to follow him.=20

The appeal was instantly answered by Colonel Butler, of the Palmettos: =E2=
=80=9CEvery South-Carolinian=20

will follow you to the death!=E2=80=9D The cry was contagious, and most of =
the New-Yorkers took it up.=20

Forming at angles to the causeway, Shields led these brave men, under an in=
cessant hail of shot,=20

against the village of Portales, where the Mexican reserves were posted. No=
t a trigger was pulled=20

till they stood at a hundred and fifty yards from the enemy. Then the littl=
e band poured in their=20

volley, fatally answered by the Mexican host. Butler, already wounded, was =
shot through the head,=20

and died instantly. Calling to the Palmettos to avenge his death, Shields g=
ives the word to charge.=20

They charge--not four hundred in all--over the plain, down upon four thousa=
nd Mexicans, securely=20

posted under cover. At every step their ranks thinned. Dickenson, who succe=
eded Butler in=20

command of the Palmettos, seizes the colors as the bearer falls dead; the n=
ext moment he is=20

down himself, mortally wounded, and Major Gladden snatches them from his ha=
nd. Adams,=20

Moragne, and nearly half the gallant band are prostrate. A very few minutes=
 more, and there will=20

be no one left to bear the glorious flag.  [Illustration: CHARGE OF THE =E2=
=80=9CPALMETTOS=E2=80=9D AT=20

CHURUBUSCO  (From a print of the time)]  But at this very moment a deafenin=
g roar was heard in=20

the direction of the _t=C3=AAte de pont_. Round-shot and grape, rifle-balls=
 and canister came crashing=20

down the causeway into the Mexican ranks from their own battery. Worth was =
there just in time.=20

Down the road and over the ditch, through the field and hedge and swamp, in=
 tumult and panic,=20

the Mexicans fled from the bayonets of the Sixth and Garland=E2=80=99s brig=
ade. A shout, louder than the=20

cannon=E2=80=99s peal--Worth was on their heels, with his best men. Before =
Shields reached the causeway=20

he was by his side, driving the Mexican horse into their infantry, and Ayre=
s was galloping up with a=20

captured Mexican gun. Captain Kearny, with a few dragoons, rode straight in=
to the flying host,=20

scattered them right and left, sabred all he could reach, and halted before=
 the gate of Mexico. Not=20

till then did he perceive that he was alone with his little party, nearly a=
ll of whom were wounded;=20

but, in spite of the hundreds of escopetas that were levelled at him, he ga=
lloped back in safety to=20

headquarters.  The sun, which rose that morning on a proud army and a defia=
nt metropolis, set at=20

even on a shattered, haggard band and a city full of woe-stricken wretches =
who did nothing all=20

night but quake with terror and cry at every noise, =E2=80=9CAqui viene los=
 Yanquies!=E2=80=9D All along the=20

causeway, and in the fields and swamp on either side, heaps of dead men and=
 cattle, intermingled=20

with broken ammunition-carts, marked where the American shot had told. A go=
ry track leading to=20

the _t=C3=AAte de pont_, groups of dead in the fields on the west of Churub=
usco, over whose pale faces=20

some stalks of tattered corn still waved, red blotches in the marsh next th=
e causeway, where the=20

rich blood of Carolina and New York soaked the earth, showed where the fire=
 of the heavy=20



Mexican guns and the countless escopetas of the infantry had been most murd=
erous. Scott had=20

lost, in that day=E2=80=99s work, over one thousand men in killed and wound=
ed, seventy-nine of whom were=20

officers. The Mexican loss, according to Santa Anna, was one-third of his a=
rmy, equal probably to=20

ten thousand men, one-fourth of whom were prisoners, the rest killed and wo=
unded. As the sun=20

went down the troops were recalled to headquarters; but all night long the =
battle-field swarmed=20

with straggling parties, seeking some lost comrade in the cold and rain, an=
d surgeons hurrying=20

from place to place and offering succor to the wounded.  It would have been=
 easy for Scott to have=20

marched on the city that night, or next morning, and seized it before the M=
exicans recovered the=20

shock of their defeat. Anxious, however, to shorten the war, and assured th=
at Santa Anna was=20

desirous of negotiating; warned, moreover, by neutrals and others that the =
hostile occupation of=20

the capital would destroy the last chance of peaceable accommodation and ro=
use the Mexican=20

spirit to resistance all over the country, the American general consented, =
too generously perhaps,=20

to offer an armistice to his vanquished foe. It was eagerly accepted, and n=
egotiations were=20

commenced which lasted over a fortnight. Early in September the treachery o=
f the Mexicans=20

became apparent. No progress had been made in the negotiations; and, in def=
iance of the=20

armistice, an American wagon, proceeding to the city for provisions, had be=
en attacked by the=20

mob and one man killed and others wounded. Scott wrote to Santa Anna, deman=
ding an apology,=20

and threatening to terminate the armistice on the 7th if it were not tender=
ed. The reply was=20

insulting in the extreme; Santa Anna had repaired his losses and was ready =
for another fight.=20

MOLINO DEL REY  On the evening of the 7th of September Worth and his office=
rs were gathered=20

in his quarters at Tacubaya. On a table lay a hastily sketched map showing =
the position of the=20

fortified works at Molino del Rey, with the Casa Mata on one side and the c=
astle of Chapultepec=20

on the other. The Molino was occupied by the enemy; there was reason to bel=
ieve it contained a=20

foundry in full operation, and Worth had been directed to storm it next mor=
ning. Over that table=20

bent Garland and Clarke, eager to repeat the glorious deeds of August 20th =
at the _t=C3=AAte de pont_=20

of Churubusco; Duncan and Smith, already veterans; Wright, the leader of th=
e forlorn-hope,=20

joyfully thinking of the morrow; famous Martin Scott and dauntless Graham, =
little dreaming that a=20

few hours would see their livid corpses stretched upon the plain; fierce ol=
d McIntosh, covered with=20

scars; Worth himself, his manly brow clouded and his cheek paled by sicknes=
s and anxiety. Each=20

officer had his place assigned to him in the conflict; and they parted to s=
eek a few hours=E2=80=99 rest. At=20

half-past two in the morning of the 8th the division was astir. =E2=80=99Tw=
as a bright, starlight night, whose=20

silence was unbroken as the troops moved thoughtfully toward the battle-fie=
ld. In front, on the=20

right, about a mile from the encampment, the hewn-stone walls of the Molino=
 del Rey--a range of=20

buildings five hundred yards long and well adapted for defence--were distin=
ctly visible, with drowsy=20

lights twinkling through the windows. A little farther off, on the left, st=
ood the black pile of the Casa=20

Mata, the arsenal, crenelled for musketry and surrounded by a quadrangular =
field-work. Beyond=20

the Casa Mata lay a ravine, and from this a ditch and hedge ran, passing in=
 front of both works to=20

the Tacubaya road. Far on the right the grim old castle of Chapultepec loom=
ed up darkly against=20

the sky. Sleep wrapped the whole Mexican line, and but few words were spoke=
n in the American=20

ranks as the troops took up their respective positions--Garland, with Dunn=
=E2=80=99s battery and Huger=E2=80=99s=20

twenty-four-pounders, on the right, against the Molino; Wright, at the head=
 of the stormers, and=20

followed by the light division, under Captain Kirby Smith, in the centre; M=
cIntosh, with Duncan=E2=80=99s=20



battery, on the left, near the ravine, looking toward the Casa Mata; and Ca=
dwallader, with his=20

brigade, in reserve.  Night still overhung the east when the Mexicans were =
roused from their=20

slumbers by the roar of Huger=E2=80=99s twenty-four-pounders and the crashi=
ng of the balls through the=20

roof and walls of the Molino. A shout arose within their lines, spreading f=
rom the ravine to the=20

castle; lights flashed in every direction, bugles sounded, the clank of arm=
s rang from right to left,=20

and every man girded himself for the fray. With the first ray of daylight M=
ajor Wright advanced with=20

the forlorn-hope down the slope. A few seconds elapsed; then a sheet of fla=
me burst from the=20

batteries, and round-shot, canister, and grape hurtled through the air. =E2=
=80=9CCharge!=E2=80=9D shouted the=20

leader, and down they went, with double-quick step, over the ditch and hedg=
e and into the line,=20

sweeping everything before them. The Mexicans fell from their guns, but soo=
n, seeing the=20

smallness of the force opposed to them, and reassured by the galling fire p=
oured from the azoteas=20

and Molino on the stormers, they rallied, charged furiously, and drove our =
men back into the plain.=20

Here eleven out of the fourteen officers of Wright=E2=80=99s party and the =
bulk of his men fell killed or=20

wounded. All of the latter who could not fly were bayoneted where they lay =
by the Mexicans.=20

Captain Walker, of the Sixth, badly shot, was left for dead; he saw the ene=
my murdering every=20

man who showed signs of life, but the agony of thirst was so insupportable =
that he could not resist=20

raising his canteen to his lips. A dozen balls instantly tore up the ground=
 around him; several=20

Mexicans rushed at him with the bayonet, but at that moment the light divis=
ion under Kirby Smith=20

came charging over the ditch into the Mexican line and diverted their atten=
tion.  [Illustration:=20

BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL REY  (From a print of the time)]  Garland, meanwhile, =
moved down=20

rapidly on the right with Dunn=E2=80=99s guns, which were drawn by hand, al=
l the horses having been=20

wounded and become unmanageable. These soon opened an enfilading fire on th=
e Mexican=20

battery; and, some of the gunners flying, the light division charged, under=
 a hot fire, and carried=20

the guns for a second time. Their gallant leader was shot dead in the charg=
e. But the enemy could=20

afford to lose the battery. From the tops of the azoteas, from the Casa Mat=
a, and the Molino, a=20

deadly shower of balls was rained crosswise upon the assailants. Part of th=
e reserve was brought=20

up, and Dunn=E2=80=99s guns and the Mexican battery were served upon the bu=
ildings without much effect=20

at first. Lieutenant-Colonel Graham led a party of the Eleventh against the=
 latter; when within=20

pistol-shot a terrific volley assailed him, wounding him in ten places. The=
 gallant soldier quietly=20

dismounted, pointed with his sword to the building, cried =E2=80=9CCharge!=
=E2=80=9D and sank dead on the field.=20

There was an equally fierce fight at the other wing, where Duncan and McInt=
osh had driven in the=20

enemy=E2=80=99s right toward the Casa Mata. McIntosh started to storm that =
fort; and, in the teeth of a=20

tremendous hail of musketry, advanced to the ditch, only twenty-five yards =
from the work. There a=20

ball knocked him down; it was his luck to be shot or bayoneted in every bat=
tle. Martin Scott took=20

the command, but as he ordered the men forward he rolled lifeless into the =
ditch. Major Waite, the=20

next in rank, had hardly seen him fall before he too was disabled. By whole=
 companies the men=20

were mowed down by the Mexican shot; but they stood their ground. At length=
 some one gave the=20

word to fall back, and the remnants of the brigade obeyed. Many wounded wer=
e left on the=20

ground; among others Lieutenant Burnell shot in the leg, whom the Mexicans =
murdered when his=20

comrades abandoned him. After the battle his body was found, and beside it =
his dog, moaning=20

piteously and licking his dead master=E2=80=99s face.  At the head of four =
thousand cavalry, Alvarez now=20

menaced our left. Duncan watched them come, driving a cloud of dust before =
them, till they were=20



within close range; then, opening with his wonderful rapidity, he shattered=
 whole platoons at a=20

discharge. Worth sent him word to be sure to keep the lancers in check. =E2=
=80=9CTell General Worth,=E2=80=9D was=20

his reply, =E2=80=9Cto make himself perfectly easy; I can whip twenty thous=
and of them.=E2=80=9D So far as Alvarez=20

was concerned, he kept his word.  On the American right the fight had reach=
ed a crisis. Mixed=20

confusedly together, men of all arms furiously attacked the Molino, firing =
into every aperture,=20

climbing to the roof, and striving to batter in the doors and gates with th=
eir muskets. The garrison=20

never slackened their terrible fire for an instant. At length, Major Buchan=
an, of the Fourth,=20

succeeded in bursting open the southern gate, and almost at the same moment=
 Anderson and=20

Ayres, of the artillery, forced their way into the buildings at the northwe=
stern angle. Ayres leaped=20

down alone into a crowd of Mexicans--he had done the same at Monterey--and =
fell covered with=20

wounds. In our men rushed on both sides, stabbing, firing, and felling the =
Mexicans with their=20

muskets. From room to room and house to house a hand-to-hand encounter was =
kept up. Here a=20

stalwart Mexican hurled down man after man as they advanced; there Buchanan=
 and the Fourth=20

levelled all before them. But the Mexicans never withstood the cold steel. =
One by one the=20

defenders escaped by the rear toward Chapultepec, and those who remained hu=
ng out a white=20

flag. Under Duncan=E2=80=99s fire the Casa Mata had been evacuated, and the=
 enemy was everywhere in=20

full retreat. Twice he rallied and charged the Molino; but each time the ar=
tillery drove him back=20

toward Chapultepec, and parties of the light infantry pursued him down the =
road. Before ten in the=20

morning the whole field was won; and, having blown up the Casa Mata, Worth,=
 by Scott=E2=80=99s order,=20

fell back to Tacubaya.  With gloomy face and averted eye the gallant soldie=
r received the thanks of=20

his chief for the exploits of the morning. His heart was with the brave men=
 he had lost: near eight=20

hundred out of less than thirty-five hundred, and among them fifty-eight of=
ficers, many of whom=20

were his dearest friends. All had fallen in advance of their men, with swor=
d in hand and noble=20

words on their lips. They had helped to storm Molino del Rey, and to cut do=
wn near a fifth of Santa=20

Anna=E2=80=99s fourteen thousand men. Sadly the general returned to his qua=
rters.  The end was now=20

close at hand. Reconnaissances were carefully made, and, the enemy=E2=80=99=
s strength being gathered=20

on the southern front of the city. General Scott determined to assault Chap=
ultepec on the west. By=20

the morning of the 12th the batteries were completed, and opened a brisk fi=
re on the castle,=20

without, however, doing any more serious damage than annoying the garrison =
and killing a few=20

men. The fire was kept up all day; and at night preparations were made for =
the assault, which was=20

ordered to be made next morning.   CHAPULTEPEC  At daybreak on the 13th the=
 cannonade=20

recommenced, as well from the batteries planted against Chapultepec as from=
 Steptoe=E2=80=99s guns,=20

which were served against the southern defences of the city in order to div=
ert the attention of the=20

enemy. At 8 A.M. the firing from the former ceased and the attack commenced=
. Quitman=20

advanced along the Tacubaya road, Pillow from the Molino del Rey, which he =
had occupied on the=20

evening before. Between the Molino and the castle lay first an open space, =
then a grove thickly=20

planted with trees; in the latter Mexican sharpshooters had been posted, pr=
otected by an=20

intrenchment on the border of the grove. Pillow sent Lieutenant-Colonel Joh=
nstone with a party of=20

voltigeurs to turn this work by a flank movement; it was handsomely accompl=
ished, and, just as=20

the voltigeurs broke through the redan, Pillow, with the main body, charged=
 it in front and drove=20

back the Mexicans. The grove gained, Pillow pressed forward to the foot of =
the rock; for the=20

Mexican shot from the castle batteries, crashing through the trees, seemed =
even more terrible=20



than it really was, and the troops were becoming restless. The Mexicans had=
 retreated to a=20

redoubt half-way up the hill; the voltigeurs sprang up from rock to rock, f=
iring as they advanced,=20

and followed by Hooker, Chase, and others, with parties of infantry. In a v=
ery few minutes the=20

redoubt was gained, the garrison driven up the hill, and the voltigeurs, Ni=
nth, and Fifteenth in hot=20

pursuit after them. Here the firing from the castle was very severe. Colone=
l Ransom, of the Ninth,=20

was killed, and Pillow himself was wounded.  Still the troops pressed on ti=
ll the crest of the hill was=20

gained. There some moments were lost, owing to the delay in the arrival of =
scaling-ladders, during=20

which two of Quitman=E2=80=99s regiments and Clarke=E2=80=99s brigade reinf=
orced the storming party. When the=20

ladders came, numbers of men rushed forward with them, leaped into the ditc=
h, and planted them=20

for the assault. Lieutenant Selden was the first man to mount. But the Mexi=
cans collected all their=20

energies for this last moment. A tremendous fire dashed the foremost of the=
 stormers in the ditch,=20

killing Lieutenants Rogers and Smith, and clearing the ladders. Fresh men i=
nstantly manned=20

naturally upon the canvas as we feel that she must have lived in the world.=
 It is for such sweet and=20

logical truth-telling, such mild and strict interpretation, that we must pa=
y our debt of appreciation to=20

Fantin, the painter of ideal realities and of actual ideals.     CARL LARSS=
ON     IX  CARL=20

LARSSON   The accomplished Swedish critic, Georg Nordensvan, opens his mono=
graph on Carl=20

Larsson with the statement that the latter is unquestionably the most popul=
ar artist of the present=20

day in his own country, and that he is equally popular as a man. It is not =
often that the personality=20

of an artist seems so essentially connected with his work as in Larsson's c=
ase. His gay,=20

pugnacious, independent, yet amiable temper of mind is so directly reflecte=
d in the character of his=20

various production as to make a consideration of the two together an almost=
 necessary prelude to=20

any account of him. He has insisted upon expressing his individuality at wh=
atever cost of=20

traditional and conventional technique and he has at the same time unconsci=
ously represented the=20

frankest, most wholesome, and, on the whole, most characteristic side of th=
e Swedish character. A=20

rather daring and flippant humor enters into his paintings. One of his port=
raits of himself shows him=20

standing, his happy reddish face aglow, against a yellowish-brown wall. He =
is dressed in a long,=20

yellowish-brown smoking frock, and holds in his raised hand a pencil from w=
hich appears to spring=20

a little feminine figure supposed to represent his genius. "This figure car=
ries what looks like a=20

quantity of small round cookies," says his critic, "possibly to symbolize t=
he adequacy with which=20

his genius provides for his nourishment."  Another shows him with his littl=
e girl sitting on his head,=20

maintaining her equilibrium by planting stout feet on his shoulders. The pa=
inter wears a house-

jacket, loose slippers and baggy trousers, his face beams with good-humor; =
the child is brimming=20

with laughter; the little scene is instinctive with the spirit of intimate =
domesticity, and the drawing,=20

free and easy, without apparent effort in the direction of elegant arrangem=
ent or expressiveness of=20

line, is nevertheless singularly nervous and vigorous.  [Illustration: MY F=
AMILY  _From a painting=20

by Carl Larsson_]  In still another portrait, he is sitting before his ease=
l, his little girl on one knee,=20

his canvas on the other with the easel serving only as a prop. His eyes are=
 turned toward a mirror=20

which is outside the picture and the reflection in which he is using as a m=
odel; the child's eyes are=20

fixed on the canvas watching the growth of the design. These are "self-port=
raits" in more than the=20

usual sense. It is the rarest thing in art to find a painter representing h=
is own aspect with such=20

complete lack of self-consciousness. No characteristics seem especially to =
be emphasized, none=20

betray exaggeration, there apparently is neither distortion nor idealizatio=
n, nor is there any attempt=20

to select a mood that shall preserve a favorable impression of the sitter. =
Nothing could, however,=20

more favorably present a character to the critical scrutiny of strangers th=
an this superb good faith.=20

The least sentimental of us must recognize with frank delight the wholesome=
 sweetness of the=20

world these kindly faithful records open to us.  Larsson was born at Stockh=
olm in 1853. From the=20

age of thirteen he depended upon his own labors for support; retouching pho=
tographs at first.=20

Later he entered the elementary school of the academy where he received hon=
ors. He drew from=20

the antique and from the model and began to make drawings for illustration =
when he was about=20

eighteen. The public knew him first through his drawings for the comic pape=
r called _Kasper_, and=20

he shortly became a much sought after illustrator for papers and books. The=
 first book illustrated=20

by him was a collection of stories by Richard Gustafsson, the editor of _Ka=
sper_, the next was=20



Anderson's "Tales." In the latter he succeeded Isidor Toernblom, who died i=
n 1876 after having=20

executed only a few drawings for the first part. He became bold and rapid i=
n improvisation, and=20

light and easy in execution--qualities that he never lost. He was obliged t=
o make of his academic=20

studies a side issue, bread-winning taking necessarily the first place with=
 him. No doubt it is to this=20

necessity that he owes that prompt adaptation of his facility to various us=
es, that practical=20

application of his freshly acquired knowledge which give to the simple comp=
ositions of his earlier=20

period an especial spontaneity. He had no time to fix himself in ruts of pr=
actice. To draw from the=20

Antinous one day and the next to press one's Greek outline into service for=
 the representation of=20

little dancing girls and happy babies is to effect that union between art a=
nd life which makes the=20

first moving and the second beautiful; the union in which Daumier found the=
 source of his=20

prodigious strength. In his early years Larsson was anything but a realist.=
 His fancy turned to=20

unusual and vast subjects, and his natural impatience caused him to launch =
himself upon them=20

with very inadequate preliminary study. The first canvas attempted by him d=
uring the study-time in=20

Paris (time which he won at the Academy) was nearly ten feet high and repre=
sented a scene from=20

the deluge with figures double life size. Naturally, he found himself unabl=
e to cope with the=20

difficulties that promptly arose and was obliged to give it up. In 1877, wh=
en he was twenty-four=20

years old, he painted a three-quarter length portrait of a woman standing, =
which was his best work=20

of that period. The genre pictures which he sent home to Stockholm at about=
 the same time=20

awakened little enthusiasm and spread the of the voltigeurs, gained a footh=
old on the parapet.=20

McKenzie, of the forlorn-hope, followed; and a crowd of voltigeurs and infa=
ntry, shouting and=20

cheering, pressed after him and swept down upon the garrison with the bayon=
et. Almost at the=20

same moment Johnstone, of the voltigeurs, who had led a small party round t=
o the gate of the=20

castle, broke it open and effected an entrance in spite of a fierce fire fr=
om the southern walls. The=20

two parties uniting, a deadly conflict ensued within the building. Maddened=
 by the recollection of=20

the murder of their wounded comrades at Molino del Rey, the stormers at fir=
st showed no quarter.=20

On every side the Mexicans were stabbed or shot down without mercy. Many fl=
ung themselves=20

over the parapet and down the hillside, and were dashed in pieces against t=
he rocks. More fought=20

like fiends, expending their last breath in a malediction and expiring in t=
he act of aiming a=20

treacherous blow as they lay on the ground. Streams of blood flowed through=
 the doors of the=20

college, and every room and passage was the theatre of some deadly struggle=
. At length the=20

officers succeeded in putting an end to the carnage, and, the remaining Mex=
icans having=20

surrendered, the stars and stripes were hoisted over the castle of Chapulte=
pec by Major Seymour.=20

Meanwhile Quitman had stormed the batteries on the causeway to the east of =
the castle, after a=20

desperate struggle, in which Major Twiggs, who commanded the stormers, was =
shot dead at the=20

head of his men. The Mexicans fell back toward the city. General Scott, com=
ing up at this moment,=20

ordered a simultaneous advance to be made on the city along the two roads l=
eading from=20

Chapultepec to the gates of San Cosme and Belen respectively. Worth was to =
command that on=20

San Cosme, Quitman that on Belen. Both were prepared for defence by barrica=
des, behind which=20

the enemy were posted in great numbers. Fortunately for the assailants, an =
aqueduct, supported=20

on arches of solid masonry, ran along the centre of each causeway. By keepi=
ng under cover of=20

these arches and springing rapidly from one to another, Smith=E2=80=99s rif=
les and the South Carolina=20

regiment were enabled to advance close to the first barricade on the Belen =
road and pour in a=20



destructive fire on the gunners. A flank discharge from Duncan=E2=80=99s gu=
ns completed the work; the=20

barricade was carried; and, without a moment=E2=80=99s rest, Quitman advanc=
ed in the same manner on=20

the garita of San Belen, which was held by General Torres with a strong gar=
rison. It, too, was=20

stormed, though under a fearful hail of grape and canister; and the rifles =
moved forward toward the=20

citadel. But at this moment Santa Anna rode furiously down to the point of =
attack. Boiling with rage=20

at the success of the invaders, he smote General Torres in the face, threw =
a host of infantry into=20

the houses commanding the garita and the road, ordered the batteries in the=
 citadel to open fire,=20

planted fresh guns on the Paseo, and infused such spirit into the Mexicans =
that Quitman=E2=80=99s=20

advance was stopped at once. A terrific storm of shot, shells, and grape as=
sailed the garita, where=20

Captain Dunn had planted an eight-pounder. Twice the gunners were shot down=
, and fresh men=20

sent to take their places. Then Dunn himself fell, and immediately afterwar=
d Lieutenant Benjamin=20

and his first sergeant met the same fate. The riflemen in the arches repell=
ed sallies, but Quitman=E2=80=99s=20

position was precarious till night terminated the conflict.  Worth, meanwhi=
le, had advanced in like=20

manner along the San Cosme causeway, driving the Mexicans from barricade to=
 barricade till=20

within two hundred and fifty yards of the garita of San Cosme. There he enc=
ountered as severe a=20

fire as that which stopped Quitman. But Scott had ordered him to take the g=
arita, and take it he=20

would. Throwing Garland=E2=80=99s brigade out to the right and Clarke=E2=80=
=99s to the left, he ordered them to=20

break into the houses, burst through the walls, and bore their way to the f=
lanks of the garita. The=20

plan had succeeded perfectly at Monterey; nor did it fail here. Slowly but =
surely the sappers=20

passed from house to house, until at sunset they reached the point desired.=
 Then Worth ordered=20

the attack. Lieutenant Hunt brought up a light gun at a gallop and fired it=
 through the embrasure of=20

the enemy=E2=80=99s battery, almost muzzle to muzzle; the infantry at the s=
ame moment opened a most=20

deadly and unexpected fire from the roofs of the houses, and McKenzie, at t=
he head of the=20

stormers, dashed at the battery and carried it almost without loss. The Mex=
icans fled precipitately=20

into the city.  At one that night two parties left the citadel and issued f=
orth from the city. One was=20

the remnant of the Mexican army, which slunk silently and noiselessly throu=
gh the northern gate,=20

and fled to Guadalupe-Hidalgo; the other was a body of officers who came un=
der a white flag to=20

propose terms of capitulation.   THE OCCUPATION OF THE CITY OF MEXICO  The =
sun shone=20

brightly on the morning of September 14th. Scores of neutral flags floated =
from the windows on the=20

Calle de Plateros, and in their shade beautiful women gazed curiously on th=
e scene beneath.=20

Gayly dressed groups thronged the balconies, and at the street-corners were=
 scowling, dark-faced=20

men. The street resounded with the heavy tramp of infantry, the rattle of g=
un-carriages, and the=20

clatter of horses=E2=80=99 hoofs. =E2=80=9CLos Yanquies!=E2=80=9D was the c=

 proudly to the=20
