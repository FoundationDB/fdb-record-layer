author is asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the argument 

'whither the wind blows.' That no conclusion is arrived at is also in accordance with the character 

of the earlier dialogues. The resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and 

Euthydemus, which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced on 

either side of the argument. On the whole, more may be said in favour of the genuineness of the 

Hippias than against it.  The Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting 

as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the Athenians among the 

Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian 

history. It exhibits an acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps, 

intended to rival that great work. If genuine, the proper place of the Menexenus would be at the 

end of the Phaedrus. The satirical opening and the concluding words bear a great resemblance to 

the earlier dialogues; the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the 

Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other writings of Plato. The 

funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested 

the subject, in the same manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight 

mention of Cleitophon and his attachment to him best worth while.  He realized that in order to do 

this he must do two things: he must husband his financial resources and he must begin to 

accumulate a mental reserve.  The wide public acceptance of the periodical which he edited 

naturally brought a share of financial success to him.  He had experienced poverty, and as he 

subsequently wrote, in an article called "Why I Believe in Poverty," he was deeply grateful for his 

experience.  He had known what it was to be poor; he had seen others dear to him suffer for the 

bare necessities; there was, in fact, not a single step on that hard road that he had not travelled. 

He could, therefore, sympathize with the fullest understanding with those similarly situated, could 

help as one who knew from practice and not from theory.  He realized what a marvellous blessing 

poverty can be; but as a condition to experience, to derive from it poignant lessons, and then to 

get out of; not as a condition to stay in.  Of course many said to Bok when he wrote the article in 

which he expressed these beliefs: "That's all very well; easy enough to say, but how can you get 

out of it?"  Bok realized that he could not definitely show any one the way.  No one had shown 

him.  No two persons can find the same way out.  Bok determined to lift himself out of poverty 

because his mother was not born in it, did not belong in it, and could not stand it.  That gave him 

the first essential: a purpose.  Then he backed up the purpose

in the Apology and Republic; or as the Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of 

Xenophon, Mem. A similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the 

Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.  To these two doubtful 

writings of Plato I have added the First work, and to work at anything that came his way, no matter 

what it was, so long as it meant "the way out."  He did not pick and choose; he took what came, 

and did it in the best way he knew how; and when he did not like what he was doing he still did it 

as well as he could while he was doing it, but always with an eye
