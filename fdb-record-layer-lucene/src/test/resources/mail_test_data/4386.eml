dracaena marginata than 8:15, and it would be over by eleven sharp. A nod is as good as a wink to Sir DRURIOLANUS, but all the same, Heaven forefend I should be guilty of either indiscretion in the Imperial Operatorial presence. Thus much at present.   "It is the cardinal."  "In person."  "How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon?"  Athos smiled, but did not reply. Five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince's door.  This door was guarded by a sentinel and dracaena marginata than 8:15, and it would be over by eleven sharp.

performance. Cherry-Tree Duet, between _Suzel_ and _Fritz_, great hit. Admirably sung and 

acted, and vociferously encored. Nay, they would have had it three times if they could, but though 

Sir DRURIOLANUS sets his face against encores, allowing not too much encore but just encore 

enough, he, as an astute Manager, cannot see why persons who have paid to hear a thing only 

once should hear it three times for the same money. No; if they like it so much that they want it 

again, and must have it, and won't be happy till they get it, then let them encore their own 

performance of paying for their seats, and come and hear their favourite _morceaux_ over and 

over again as often as they like to pay. He will grant one encore no more. Sir believe it they 

insulted us all the more. However, I'm glad not to fight them until to-morrow. I hope we shall have 

something better to do to-night than to draw the sword."  "What have we to do?"  "Egad! to take 

Mazarin."  Athos curled his lip with disdain.  "These undertakings do not suit me, as you know, 

Aramis."  "Why?"  "Because it is taking people unawares."  "Really, Athos, you would make a 

singular general. You would fight only by broad daylight, warn your foe before an attack, and never 

attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness."  Athos 

smiled.  "You know one cannot change his nature," he said. "Besides, do you know what is our 

situation, and whether Mazarin's arrest

we insist on Mr. IRVING giving us "To be or not to be," or any other soliloquy, all over again, 

simply because he has done it once so well? Do we ask Mr. J.L. TOOLE to repeat his author's 

good jokes--or his own when his author has failed him? No; we applaud to the echo, we laugh till, 

as Mr. CHEVALIER says, "we thort we should ha' died," but we don't encore the comic jokes, 

telling situations, or serious soliloquies as rendered by our accomplished histrions.  [Illustration: 

The Rabbinical-Hat-Beer-Jug.]  Were a collection of pictures made of Mlle. BAUERMEISTER in 

different characters, it would, for interest and variety, become a formidable rival of the CHARLES 

MATHEWS series now in the possession of the Garrick Club. To-night she is the busy, bustling 

_Caterina_, _Friend Fritz's_ housekeeper, who, as she has to provide all the food for their 

breakfast, and set it on the table, might be distinguished as _Catering Caterina_. No one now 

cares to see an Opera without Mlle. BAUERMEISTER in it, whether she appear as a dashing lady 

of the Court, probably in a riding-habit, or as a middle-class German housekeeper, or as Cupid 

God of Love, or as _Juliet's_ ancient nurse, or as an impudent waiting-maid, or as an unhappy 

mother, or as,--well,--any number of characters that I cannot now recall, but all done excellently 

well. Never have I heard of her being either "sick or sorry." Some few seasons ago I drew public 

attention to this most useful and ornamental _artiste_, and now I am glad to see that here and 

there a critic has awoke to the fact of her existence, and has done her tardy justice. Long may the 

Bauermeistersinger be able to give her valuable assistance, without which no Covent Garden 

Opera Company could possibly be perfect.  [Illustration: an encumbrance than an advantage?" 

"Say at once you disapprove of my proposal."  "I think you ought to do nothing, since you exacted 

a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in France."  "I have entered 

into no engagement and consider myself quite free. Come, come."  "Where?"  "Either to seek the 

Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon, and to tell them about this."  "Yes, but on one condition--

that we begin by the coadjutor. He is a priest, learned in cases of conscience, and we will tell him 

ours."  It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon, as his house came 

first; but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne, to see 

Raoul.  They re-entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to 

the Halles; and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois, they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud.  But 

Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne. He had received a message from the prince, 

to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received it.     77. The three Lieutenants 

of the Generalissimo.   The night was dark, but still the town resounded with those noises that 

disclose a city in a state of siege. Athos and Aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being 

stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades, who demanded the watchword; and on their 

saying that they were going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given 

them under pretext of conducting them, but in fact as a spy over their movements.  On arriving at 

the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers, who seemed to know every 

possible password; for they walked without either guide or escort, and on arriving at the

As to _L'Amico Fritz_, I should suggest that it be played in one Scene and two Acts. That this one 

Scene should be the Exterior of Cherry-Tree Farm (which should be _Fritz's_, not the _Rabbi's_) 

and that instead of lowering the Curtain, the _intermezzo_--not I venture to opine equal to the 

marvellous _intermezzo_ in _Cavalleria Rusticana_--should be played. _L'Amico_ is certain of an 

encore, and this will give the singers a rest. It could then commence at nine--a more had nothing 

to do but to speak to those who guarded them, who instantly let them pass with evident deference, 

due probably to their high birth.  On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still.  "Oh!" cried Aramis, 

"do you see, count?"  "Yes," said Athos.  "Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?" 

"What do you think, Aramis?"  "Why, they are our men."  "You are not mistaken; I recognize 

Monsieur de Flamarens."  "And I, Monsieur de Chatillon."  "As to the cavalier in
