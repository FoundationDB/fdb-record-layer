who fell.(217) But the latter's name is surely too famous, if one must cred=
it the Church Fathers, for=20

the historian to have mentioned him simply as "an Icarus." The writer is qu=
ite aware that there=20

exists in Rome a locality named Simonium, near the Church of SS. Cosmas and=
 Daimanus (Via=20

Sacra), and the ruins of the ancient temple of Romulus, where attendance of=
 these experts upon a=20

patient can cause no injury, and thereafter the responsibility rests solely=
 upon the public officer.=E2=80=9D=20

As to how far the decision of an inspector appointed by a board of health i=
s regarded by the law as=20

quasi-judicial, and therefore conclusive, see Underwood _v._ Green, 42 N. Y=

_
pieces of a stone, on which it is alleged the two knees of the Apostle Pete=
r were impressed in=20

thanksgiving after his supposed victory over Simon, are shown to this day. =
But what does this=20

exhibition amount to? For the broken fragments of one stone, the Buddhists =
of Ceylon show a=20

whole rock on Adam's Peak with another imprint upon it. A crag stands upon =
its platform, a terrace=20

of which supports a huge boulder, and on the boulder rests for nearly three=
 thousand years the=20

sacred foot-print, of a foot five feet long. Why not credit the legend of t=
he latter, if we have to=20

accept that of St. Peter? "Prince of Apostles," or "Prince of Reformers," o=
r even the "First-born of=20

Satan," as Simon is called, all are entitled to legends and fictions. One m=
ay be allowed to=20

discriminate, however.  That Simon could fly, _i.e._, raise himself in the =
air for a few minutes, is no=20

impossibility. Modern mediums have performed the same feat supported by a f=
orce that=20

Spiritualists persist in calling "spirits." But if Simon did so, it was wit=
h the help removing infected=20

persons from a city in stormy weather, and putting them in an unprotected a=
nd unsafe structure,=20

so that such persons died from the exposure, have been held liable. Aaron _=

Lozier _v._ Newark, 19 Vr., 453. In Missouri the power to license physician=

little the prayers and commands of rival Adepts, let alone Saints. The fact=
 is that logic is against=20

the supposed fall of Simon at the prayer of Peter. For had he been defeated=
 publicly by the=20

Apostle, his disciples would have abandoned him after such an evident sign =
of inferiority, and=20

would have become orthodox Christians. But we find even the author of _Phil=
osophumena_, just=20

such a Christian, showing otherwise. Simon had lost so little credit with h=
is pupils and the masses,=20

that he went on daily preaching in the Roman Campania after his supposed fa=
ll from the clouds=20

"far above the Capitolium," in which fall he broke his legs only! Such a lu=
cky fall is in itself=20

sufficiently miraculous, one would say.      SECTION XV. ST. PAUL THE REAL =
