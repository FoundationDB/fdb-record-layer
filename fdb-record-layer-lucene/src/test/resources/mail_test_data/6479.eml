d Bragelonne. Only imagine, my dear friend. Athos, who was of as high birth=
 as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of co=
mte, what is he to do with all those _
preoccupations, and this is only natural, since according to     Doellinger=
, 'the Eleusinian Mysteries=20

were viewed as the     efflorescence of all the Greek religion, as the pure=
st essence of     all its=20

conceptions.' "(478)      Not only conspirators were refused admittance the=
rein, but those     who=20

had not denounced them; traitors, perjurers, debauchees,(479)     ... so th=
at Porphyry could say=20

that: "Our soul has to be at the     moment of death as it was during the M=
ysteries, _i.e._, exempt=20

from any blemishes, passion, envy, hatred, or anger."(480)   Truly,       M=
agic was considered a=20

Divine Science which led to a participation     in the attributes of the Di=
vinity itself.(481)=20

Herodotus, Thales, Parmenides, Empedocles, Orpheus, Pythagoras, all went, e=
ach in his day, in=20

search of the wisdom of Egypt's great Hierophants, in the hope of solving t=
he problems of the=20

universe.  Says Philo:       The Mysteries were known to unveil the secret =
operations of=20

Nature.(482)      The prodigies accomplished by the priests of theurgic mag=
ic are so     well=20

authenticated and the evidence--if human testimony is worth     anything at=
 all--is so overwhelming=20

that, rather than confess that     the pagan theurgists far outrivalled the=
 Christians in miracles,=20

Sir David Brewster conceded to the former the greatest proficiency     in p=
hysics and everything=20

that pertains to natural philosophy.     Science finds herself in a very di=
sagreeable dilemma....=20

"Magic," says Psellus, "formed the last part of the sacerdotal     science.=
 It investigated the nature,=20

power, and quality of     everything sublunary; of the elements and their p=
arts, of animals,     of=20

various plants and their fruits, of stones and herbs. In short,     it dear=
 friend, Madame du Vallon----

"  Porthos, in pronouncing these words, seemed to gulp down something.  "Ma=
dame du Vallon=20

was of doubtful gentility. She had, in her first marriage--I don't think, D=
'Artagnan, I am telling you=20

anything new--married a lawyer; they thought that 'nauseous;' you can under=
stand that's a word=20

bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men. I have killed two, which h=
as made people hold=20

their tongues, but has not made me their friend. So that I have no society;=
 I live alone; I am sick of=20

it--my mind preys on itself."  D'Artagnan smiled. He now saw where the brea=
stplate was weak, and=20

prepared the blow.  "But now," he said, "that you are a widower, your wife'=
s connection cannot=20

injure you."  "Yes, but understand me; not being of a race of historic fame=
, like the De Courcys,=20

who were content to be plain sirs, or the Rohans, who didn't wish to be duk=
es, all these people,=20

who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the cer=
emonies, and I can say=20

nothing to them. Ah! If I only were a----"  "A baron, don't you mean?" crie=
d D'Artagnan, finishing his=20

friend's sentence.  "Ah!" cried Porthos; "would I were but a baron!"  "Well=
, my friend, I am come to=20

give you this very title which you wish for so much."  Porthos gave a start=
 that shook the room; two=20

or three bottles fell and were broken. Mousqueton ran thither, hearing the =
noise.  Porthos waved=20

his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles.  "I am glad to see," said D'=
Artagnan, "that you have=20

still that honest lad with you."  "He is my steward," replied Porthos; "he =
will never leave me. Go=20

away now, Mouston."  "So he's called Mouston," thought D'Artagnan; "'tis to=
o long a word to=20

pronounce 'Mousqueton.'"  "Well," he said aloud, "let us=20


_
therefore, it produced its effects. And it formed _statues_     [magnetized=
] which procure health,=20

and made all various figures     and things [talismans], which could equall=
y become the=20

instruments     of disease as well as of health. Often, too, celestial fire=
 is     made to appear=20

through magic, and then statues laugh and lamps are     spontaneously enkin=
dled."(483)   This=20

assertion of Psellus that Magic "made statues which procure health," is now=
 proven to the world to=20

be no dream, no vain boast of a hallucinated Theurgist. As Reuvens says, it=
 becomes "history."=20

For it is found in the _Papyrus Magique_ of Harris and on the votive stele =
just mentioned. Both=20

Chabas and De Rouge state that:       On the eighteenth line of this very m=
utilated monument is=20

found     the formula with regard to the acquiescence of the God (Chons) wh=
o     made his consent=20

known by a motion he imparted to his statue.(484)   There was even a disput=
e over it between the=20

two Orientalists. While M. de Rouge wanted to translate the word "Han" by "=
favour" or "grace," M.=20

Chabas insisted that "Han" meant a "movement" or "_a sign_" made by the sta=
tue.  Excesses of=20

power, abuse of knowledge and personal ambition very often led selfish and =
unscrupulous Initiates=20

to black Magic, just as the same causes led to precisely the same thing amo=
ng Christian popes=20

and cardinals; and it was black Magic that led finally to the abolition of =
the Mysteries, and not=20

Christianity, as is often erroneously thought. Read Mommsen's _Roman Histor=
y_, vol. i., and you=20

will find that it was the Pagans themselves who put an end to the desecrati=
on of the Divine=20

Science. As early as 560 B.C. the Romans had discovered an Occult associati=
on, a school of=20

black Magic of the most revolting kind; it celebrated mysteries brought fro=
m Etruria, and very soon=20

the moral pestilence had spread all over Italy       More than seven thousa=
nd Initiates were=20

prosecuted, and most of     them were sentenced to death....      Later on,=
 Titus-Livius shows us=20

another three thousand Initiates     sentenced during a single year for the=
 crime of poisoning.(485)=20

And yet black Magic is derided and denied!  Paulthier may or may not be too=
 enthusiastic in saying=20

that India appears to him as       The grand and primitive hearth of human =
thought, that has ended=20

by     embracing the whole ancient world,   but he was right in his idea. T=
hat primitive thought led=20

to Occult knowledge, which in our Fifth Race is reflected from the earliest=
 days of the Egyptian=20

Pharaohs down to our modern times. Hardly a hieratic papyrus is exhumed wit=
h the tightly=20

swathed-up mummies of kings and high priests that does not contain some int=
eresting information=20

for the modern students of Occultism.  All that is, of course, derided Magi=
c, the outcome of=20

primitive knowledge and of revelation, though it was practised in such ungo=
dly ways by the=20

Atlantean Sorcerers that it has since become necessary for the subsequent R=
ace to draw a thick=20

veil over the practices which were used to obtain so- called magical effect=
s on the psychic and on=20

the physical planes. In the letter no one in our century will believe the s=
tatements, with the=20

exception of the Roman Catholics, and these will give the acts a satanic or=
igin. Nevertheless,=20

Magic is so mixed up with the history of the world, that if the latter is e=
ver to be written it has to rely=20

upon the discoveries of Archaeology, Egyptology, and hieratic writings and =
inscriptions; if it insists=20

that they must be free from that "superstition of the ages" it will never s=
ee the light. One people=20

may suspect something; there may be spies about. You can suppose, Porthos, =
that what I have to=20

say relates to most important matters."  "Devil take them; let us walk in t=
he park," answered=20

Porthos, "for the sake of digestion."  "Egad," said D'Artagnan, "the park i=
s like everything else and=20

there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren; you are a ha=
ppy man, my friend=20

since you have not only retained your love of the chase, but acquired that =
of fishing."  "My friend,"=20



replied Porthos, "I leave fishing to Mousqueton,--it is a vulgar pleasure,-=
-but I shoot sometimes;=20

that is to say, when I am dull, and I sit on one of those marble seats, hav=
e my gun brought to me,=20

my favorite dog, and I shoot rabbits."  "Really, how very amusing!"  "Yes,"=
 replied Porthos, with a=20

sigh, "it is amusing."  D'Artagnan now no longer counted the sighs. They we=
re innumerable.=20

"However, what had you to say to me?" he resumed; "let us return to that su=
bject."  "With=20

pleasure," replied D'Artagnan; "I must, however, first frankly tell you tha=
t you must change your=20

mode of life."  "How?"  "Go into harness again, gird on your sword, run aft=
er adventures, and leave=20

as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside."  "Ah! hang it!" said=
 Porthos.  "I see you are=20

spoiled, dear friend; you are corpulent, your arm has no longer that moveme=
nt of which the late=20

cardinal's guards have so many proofs."  "Ah! my fist is strong enough I sw=
ear," cried Porthos,=20

extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton.  "So much the better."  "Are we=
 then to go to war?"=20

"By my troth, yes."  "Against whom?"  "Are you a politician, friend?"  "Not=
 in the least."  "Are you=20

for Mazarin or for the princes?"  "I am for no one."  "That is to say, you =
are for us. Well, I tell you=20

that I come to you from the cardinal."  This speech was heard by Porthos in=
 the same sense as if it=20

had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal.  "Ho! ho!=
 What are the wishes of=20

his eminence?"  "He wishes to have you in his service."  "And who spoke to =
him of me?"=20

"Rochefort--you remember him?"  "Yes, pardieu! It was he who gave us so muc=
h trouble and kept=20

us on the road so much; you gave him three sword-wounds in three separate e=
ngagements."  "But=20

you know he is now our friend?"  "No, I didn't know that. So he cherishes n=
o resentment?"  "You=20

are mistaken, Porthos," said D'Artagnan. "It is I who cherish no resentment=
."  Porthos didn't=20

understand any too clearly; but then we know that understanding was not his=
 strong point. "You=20

say, then," he continued, "that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the c=
ardinal?"  "Yes, and=20

the queen, too."  "The queen, do you say?"  "To inspire us with confidence =
she has even placed in=20

Mazarin's hands that famous diamond--you remember all about it--that I once=
 sold to Monsieur=20

des Essarts and of which, I don't know how, she has regained possession."  =
"But it seems to me,"=20

said Porthos, "that she would have done much better if she had given it bac=
k to you."  "So I think,"=20

replied D'Artagnan; "but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd f=
ancies; nevertheless,=20

since they are the ones who have riches and honors, we are devoted to them.=
"  "Yes, we are=20

devoted to them," repeated Porthos; "and you--to whom are you devoted now?"=
  "To the king, the=20

queen, and to the cardinal; moreover, I have answered for your devotion als=
o."  "And you say that=20

you have made certain conditions on my behalf?"  "Magnificent, my dear fell=
ow, magnificent! In the=20

first place you have plenty of money, haven't you? forty thousand francs in=
come,=20


_
embarrassing position in which serious Egyptologists, Assyriologists, savan=
ts and academicians=20

find themselves. Forced to translate and interpret the old papyri and the a=
rchaic inscriptions on=20

stelae and Babylonian cylinders, they find themselves compelled from first =
to last to face the=20

distasteful, and to them repulsive, subject of Magic, with its incantations=
 and paraphernalia. Here=20

they find sober and grave narratives from the pens of learned scribes, made=
 up under the direct=20

supervision of Chaldaean or Egyptian Hierophants, the most learned among th=
e Philosophers of=20

antiquity. These statements were written at the solemn hour of the death an=
d burial of Pharaohs,=20

High Priests, and other mighty ones of the land of Chemi; their purpose was=
 the introduction of the=20

newly-born, Osirified Soul before the awful-tribunal of the "Great Judge" i=
n the region of Amenti--

there where a _lie_ was said to outweigh the greatest crimes. Were the Scri=
bes and Hierophants,=20

Pharaohs, and King-Priests all fools or frauds to have either believed in, =
or tried to make others=20

believe in, such "cock-and bull stories" as are found in the most respectab=
le papyri? Yet there is=20

no help for it. Corroborated by Plato and Herodotus, by Manetho and Syncell=
us, as by all the=20

greatest and most trustworthy authors and philosophers who wrote said."  Po=
rthos began to be=20

suspicious. "Eh! my friend," said he, "one never has too much money. Madame=
 du Vallon left=20

things in much disorder; I am not much of a hand at figures, so that I live=
 almost from hand to=20

mouth."  "He is afraid I have come to borrow money," thought D'Artagnan. "A=
h, my friend," said he,=20

"it is all the better if you are in difficulties."  "How is it all the bett=
er?"  "Yes, for his eminence will=20

give you all that you want--land, money, and titles."  "Ah! ah! ah!" said P=
orthos, opening his eyes=20

at that last word.  "Under the other cardinal," continued D'Artagnan, "we d=
idn't know enough to=20

make our profits; this, however, doesn't concern you, with your forty thous=
and francs income, the=20

happiest man in the world, it seems to me."  Porthos sighed.  "At the same =
time," continued=20

D'Artagnan, "notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year, and perhaps=
 even for the very=20

reason that you have forty thousand francs a year, it seems to me that a li=
ttle coronet would do=20

well on your carriage, hey?"  "Yes indeed," said Porthos.  "Well, my dear f=
riend, win it--it is at the=20

point of your sword. We shall not interfere with each other--your object is=
 a title; mine, money. If I=20

can get enough to rebuild Artagnan, which my ancestors, impoverished by the=
 Crusades, allowed=20

to fall into ruins, and=20


_
papyri note down--as seriously as they note any history, or any fact so wel=
l known and accepted=20

as to need no commentary--whole royal dynasties of Manes, to wit, of shadow=
s and phantoms=20

(astral bodies), and such feats of magic skill and such Occult phenomena, t=
hat the most credulous=20

Occultist of our own times would hesitate to believe them to be true.  The =
Orientalists have found a=20

plank of salvation, while yet publishing and delivering the papyri to the c=
riticism of literary=20

Sadducees: they generally call them thirty acres of land about it, that is =
all I wish. I shall retire and=20

die tranquilly--at home."  "For my part," said Porthos, "I desire to be mad=
e a baron."  "You shall be=20

one."  "And have you not seen any of our other friends?"  "Yes, I have seen=
 Aramis."  "And what=20

does he wish? To be a bishop?"  "Aramis," answered D'Artagnan, who did not =
wish to undeceive=20

Porthos, "Aramis, fancy, has become a monk and a Jesuit, and lives like a b=
ear. My offers did not=20

arouse him,--did not even tempt him."  "So much the=20
