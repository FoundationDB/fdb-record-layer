ion: MAP OF CONEMAUGH VALLEY.]  are nearly fifty-five _
off the last time. You owe a great deal to me and to your excellent counsel=
, Mr. Needy and Mr.=20

Silkyarn."  "Oh, yes; I'm much obliged, sir, I assure you," Johnson interpo=
sed, with the hope of=20

abbreviating the homily.  "Of course," continued the lawyer, "I am bound to=
 do the best I can for=20

my client who is in a difficulty. I am glad that I did succeed in getting y=
ou off; but prevention is=20

better than cure, you know, Mr. Johnson."  "Of course," exclaimed the impat=
ient client.  "And," the=20

attorney went on to say, "let me give you a bit of sound advice gratis--mor=
al and religious advice,=20

as well as legal--Mr. Johnson. Let me assure you, that although I dare say =
you think there is no=20

harm in it, it is as wicked to plunder the revenue as it is to rob a privat=
e individual."  "I can't see it in=20

that light," said the unconvicted smuggler.  "It is so, upon my honour," re=
plied the attorney. "Think=20

over what I now say. Reflect upon the matter, Mr. Johnson, and you'll see I=
'm right."  "Well, that's=20

an affair for to-morrow. Let me see, what did you say your balance was, sir=
?"  "Oh, ah! Well, I said=20

I'd take a hundred guineas in final settlement--that is, a hundred and five=
 pounds, Mr. Johnson."=20

Johnson counted the money in notes, and handed it to the attorney, who laid=
 it on his table.  A=20

moment's silence followed.  It was broken by the attorney, who did not quit=
e understand the look=20

of the client; and as he feared that Mr. Johnson might be thinking the cost=
s excessive, Mr.=20

Swelling turned the theme.  "Now, I hope the next time you retain my servic=
es, they will be needed=20

for some different purpose. I should like to see you make money, and invest=
 it in land or houses,=20

and let me prepare the deeds."  "Yes, sir, you shall, when I can get the mo=
ney to buy the land and=20

houses."  "Well, till then good by, Mr. hunger-maddened people, they had fl=
ed in the darkness.=20

The city was saved by the drowning of the land.  A story is told of Frederi=
ck the Great, illustrative=20

of the same indomitable spirit. After establishing the supremacy of Prussia=
, he was suspected of=20

designs upon the independence of the Netherlands. The Dutch envoy at his co=
urt, newly=20

appointed, Frederick endeavored to overawe by a display of his power. A gre=
at military review was=20

held; and Frederick, who took a peculiar delight in tall men, caused troop =
after troop of his gigantic=20

grenadiers to file before the weazened little Dutchman, and asked his opini=
on. Of each one the=20

envoy said: =E2=80=9CVery good, _but not tall enough_.=E2=80=9D Frederick, =
much nettled at this oft repeated=20

criticism, asked the ambassador what he meant by it. =E2=80=9CI mean,=E2=80=
=9D he retorted, =E2=80=9C_that we can flood=20

our country twelve feet deep_!=E2=80=9D Frederick left the Dutch in peace. =
 Though the most terrible=20

calamities of any kind--whether from flood, famine, or earthquake--are to b=
e found in the history of=20

China, yet other nations have shared in disastrous floods. We mention a few=
:  A notable flood=20

occurred on the coast of Lincolnshire, England, A. D., 245. It seems to hav=
e been a high tide,=20

aided by the wind. Three thousand people and many cattle were drowned by a =
flood in Cheshire,=20

A. D., 353. Four hundred families were drowned in Glasgow, A. D., 758, by a=
n overflow of the=20

Clyde. A tidal wave destroyed several English seaports in A. D., 1014. The =
Severn leaped its=20

banks in 1483, submerging the adjacent lowlands, and drowning hundreds. Fif=
ty thousand people=20

perished in Catalonia, Spain, during a flood in 1617. In Yorkshire, England=
, occurred a remarkable=20

outburst of subterranean waters in 1686.  =E2=80=9CIn September, 1687, moun=
tain torrents inundated=20

Navarre, and two thousand persons were drowned.=20

out his client.  "You forgot, sir, I think, to give me a receipt; and I don=
't think I ever had any for the=20

money I paid you in the prison?"  "Oh, very well, Mr. Johnson. Certainly yo=
u can have a duly-

stamped receipt, if you please; but I hope you don't suppose that I want to=
 cheat you? I should not=20

like to think you reward my anxious services on your behalf by entertaining=
 such an unjust=20

suspicion of me as that?"  "No, sir. Oh, no. Nothing of that sort. Only, as=
 you were a-saying that it's=20

as wrong to rob the revenue as it is a private individual, I thought (altho=
ugh I don't see things quite=20

in that light) that you ought to give me one."  The attorney's moral philos=
ophy cost him 7_s._ 6_d._=20

He bit his lip, and sat down; and as penny receipts had not been invented, =
he wrote on a stamp of=20

the above value a receipt for all the money paid him by the smuggler, who r=
ather enjoyed the joke=20

he had played off on his legal adviser.     SWINDLING ACCORDING TO ACT OF P=
ARLIAMENT.=20

I think that the merchants and traders of England, Scotland, and Ireland, o=
r the Chambers of=20

Commerce of the United Kingdom, might lay out a fair sum of money in a wors=
e mode than by=20

retaining me to illustrate, through my experience, some defective acts of P=
arliament, under which,=20

as I have seen, frequent palpable and sometimes gigantic villany is perpetr=
ated. Whether this=20

notion of my usefulness to the mercantile community and the State is justif=
ied or not by any thing I=20

can show, the reader may judge from the following, which is one sample of L=
iffey overran its banks=20

and caused great damage. A reservoir in Lurca, a city of Spain, burst in 18=
02, in much the same=20

way as did the dam at Johnstown, and as a result one thousand persons peris=
hed. Twenty-four=20

villages near Presburg, and nearly all their inhabitants, were swept away i=
n April, 1811, by an=20

overflow of the Danube. Two years later, large provinces in Austria and Pol=
and were flooded, and=20

many lives were lost. In the same year a force of two thousand Turkish sold=
iers, who were=20

stationed on a small island near Widdin, were surprised by a sudden overflo=
w of the Danube and=20

all were drowned. There were two more floods in this year, one in Silesia, =
where six thousand=20

persons perished, and the French army met such losses and privations that i=
ts ruin was=20

accelerated; and another in Poland, where four thousand persons were suppos=
ed to have been=20

drowned. In 1816, the melting of the snow on the mountains surrounding Stra=
bane, Ireland,=20

caused destructive floods: and the overflow of the Vistula, in Germany, lai=
d many villages under=20

water. Floods that occasioned great suffering occurred in 1829, when severe=
 rains caused the=20

Spey and Findhorn to rise fifty feet above their ordinary level. The follow=
ing year the Danube again=20

overflowed its banks, and inundated the houses of 50,000 inhabitants of Vie=
nna.=E2=80=9D The Saone=20

[Illustration: BREAKING OF THE DYKES, HOLLAND.]  overflowed in 1840 and pou=
red its=20

turbulent waters into the Rhine, flooding one hundred square miles of land,=
 and drowning=20

thousands. Another great=20

An honest, struggling, and not rich, but moderately successful, trader in t=
he City of London, not=20

long ago, was told that a certain "firm" (Messrs. Voleur and Enlever), who =
had offices, or a=20

warehouse, not many hundreds of yards from the Mansion House, and somewhat =
nearer to the=20

cold abode of Gog and Magog, and who had an establishment in Paris, might d=
o business with=20

drowned a thousand people near Toulouse; while India, the same year lost ma=
ny through floods.=20

But no such destruction of life ever visited our own land till within a yea=
r past, and the event is=20

more to be deplored, in that it was caused by unexcusable negligence. That =
flood we must next=20

consider.     CHAPTER XVI.  THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD.      =E2=80=9CA sullen hoa=

_
Brown, although not able to bear losses, and therefore somewhat cautious, w=
as, at the same time,=20

naturally anxious to do business. He inquired the standing of this firm. Hi=
s friend could not tell him,=20

but said that other friends of his--Messrs. Downey and Grabble--were trader=
s with these=20

enterprising Parisians; that Downey was the very model of scrupulousness; a=
nd that Mr. Brown=20

might go and ask him to say confidentially what he knew about or thought of=
 the Frenchmen.=20

"Downey and Grabble are first-class people, I can assure you. If they say '=
right,' all is right; and if=20

they say 'don't,' then I say don't trust Voleur and Enlever, that's all." B=
rown thanked his friend.=20

Next day, as a matter of course, Brown called at the London office or wareh=
ouse of Voleur and=20

Enlever, which,      A sound like the tread of a hurrying host!--      A ro=
ar like the storm, as the wild=20

waters near,      Like the dash of the sea on a crag-bordered coast!       =
A wave like a mountain=20

sweeps swift through the vale      Ten thousand wrecked homes tossing dark =
in its spray,      Wild=20

cries of death-anguish echo mocks with her wail--      And the fiend of the=
 flood now has claimed=20

his prey!=E2=80=9D   India, profiting by long and sad experience, has provi=
ded, as far as may be possible,=20

against the contingencies of drought and famine, by the establishment of a =
magnificent system of=20

storage reservoirs, to furnish water for irrigating when rain is wanting. S=
ome of these tanks are fine=20

specimens of engineering, and so far as records go, no disaster has ever at=
tended their=20

establishment.=20

of his goods in his pocket. The agent and buyer of the French firm was in h=

the counter.  Firstly a formal explanation and inquiry or two passed betwee=
n these gentlemen.=20

"What class of goods do you say you can offer us?"  "Alpacas."  "They will =
do for the Paris market=20

just now, but we must have them purposes of irrigation, the water must be a=

surrounding country: hence, the only practicable plan has been to dam up th=
