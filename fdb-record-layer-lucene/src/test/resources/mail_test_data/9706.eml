Live Stock Breeders' Association was recently organized at Chesterfield and=

Massachusetts, by Col._ GEORGE GIBBS.  (For the American Journal of Science=
.)   The schorl of=20

the mineralogists of the last century united a variety of substances which =
subsequent observations=20

have separated into several species. The green schorl is now the epidote, o=
r the Vesuvian, or the=20

actynolite. The violet schorl, and the lenticular schorl, are the axinite. =
The black volcanic schorl is=20

the augite. The white Vesuvian schorl is the sommite. The white grenatiform=
 is the leucite. The=20

white prismatic is the pycnite, a species of the topaz, and another is a va=
riety of feldspar. Of the=20



blue schorl, one variety is the oxyd of titanium, another the sappare, and =
another the phosphate of=20

iron. The schorl cruciform is the granatite. The octahedral schorl is the o=
ctahedrite, or anatase.=20

The red schorl of Hungary, and the purple of Madagascar, are varieties of t=
he oxyd of titanium.=20

The spathique schorl is the spodumen.  The black schorl, and the electric s=
chorl, only remained,=20

and to avoid the confusion created by the use of the term schorl, the name =
of tourmaline was=20

given to this species by that celebrated mineralogist, the Abb=C3=A9 Ha=C3=
=BCy.[50]  The tourmaline is found=20

of almost every colour, and this variety of colour caused at first a number=
 to be formed into new=20

species; which are now considered only as varieties of the tourmaline: such=
 as the rubellite, the=20

tourmaline apyre, and indicolite.  The different analyses of the tourmaline=
, however, affords a=20

greater variety of results than is known in almost any other mineral.    Th=
e specific gravity of the=20

black varies from 3.08 to 3.36                               Green        f=
rom 3.15 to 3.36=20

Red          from 2.87 to 3.10    Analysis gives Silex from    35 to 58    =
              Alumine       20 to 48=20

Magnesia       0 to 10                  Iron           0 to 23             =
     Manganese      0 to 13=20

Alkali         0 to 10                  Water          0 to  4  These diffe=
rences must be in some measure=20

ascribed to a defect in the accuracy of some of the analyses. But it appear=
s that iron has not been=20

discovered in the red tourmaline. It is not unworthy of notice, that the re=
d tourmaline is considered=20

as infusible, but the others fusible.  The red tourmaline has been the most=
 valued, from its scarcity,=20

its employment in jewelry, and the beauty of its crystals. It has been disc=
overed in Siberia, in=20

Moravia, in the East-Indies, and in Massachusetts. In Siberia it is found i=
n a vein of decomposed=20

feldspar in a fine-grained granite, with black tourmaline. In Moravia with =
quartz and lepidolite (or=20

rose-coloured mica) in gneiss. In the East-Indies, at Ava and Ceylon, but i=
ts geological situation is=20

not known, though it is probably in gneiss or granite.  The red or rose tou=
rmaline of=20

Massachusetts, is found chiefly at Chesterfield, in a subordinate bed of gr=
anite, contained in mica=20

slate. The mica slate is the predominant rock of the country. It is fine gr=
ained, and contains an=20

abundance of small garnets. Direction of the strata north and south, varyin=
g a little easterly;=20

inclination perpendicular. The bed of granite is about three hundred feet l=
ong, and from five to=20

twenty feet broad. It is contained in a narrow ridge of mica slate, which d=
escends into, and is lost=20

in, a valley. The sides are precipitous; the highest part is about forty fe=

grains of white quartz, and a little light coloured mica, is moderately fin=
e grained, and of a grayish=20

white colour. In addition to tourmaline, it contains also emerald, some of =
the crystals of which are=20

from three to five inches in diameter. I succeeded in getting one out of it=
s matrix, which is three=20

and a half inches in diameter, and its summit (which is a plane without any=
 additional facettes) is=20

perfect.  The tourmalines are contained chiefly in a false vein of siliciou=
s feldspar and quartz,=20

which begins in the centre of the upper edge of the bed of granite, and pas=
ses obliquely,=20

descending to the northeast, about twenty feet, where it is intercepted fro=
m sight by the mica slate.=20

The vein is about one and a half foot thick in the upper part, and not more=
 than six or eight inches=20

where it is lost. This vein of silicious feldspar contains also a vein of b=

entre of the vein of=20

 report for the past year,=20

including the fair in September, and the Fat Stock Show in November.  THE F=
AIR.  It was perfectly=20

contains fourteen potash and the other nine soda. Between this and the saus=
surite, or tenacious=20

feldspar, the one contains eleven of lime, and the other only a trace.  The=
 silicious feldspar, which=20

I suspect to be the basis of the granite, crystallizes in thin rhomboidal t=
ables. They are very=20

frangible, and have one clivage perpendicular to the faces of the tables. S=
ometimes the tables=20

have one lateral edge or more truncated. In one fragment of a crystal I obs=
erved a very obtuse=20

acumination on the table, which appeared to be diedral, the sides being pla=
ced on the obtuse=20

lateral edges of the tables. On account of the extreme frangibility of the =
crystals, it is certainly=20

extremely difficult to seize their characters. Specific gravity only 2.333,=
 probably owing to=20

interstices between the tables. The colour is white, translucid, passing to=
 semi-transparent; lustre=20

sometimes dull, at others shining. The tables are sometimes so aggregated t=
hat their edges being=20

exposed, offer wedge-shaped and stelliform figures. The tourmalines=20
