outside ourselves that make for righteousness in this earth. We in America,=
 we in the everlasting=20

Wichitas and Emporias, are prone to feel that we can make for righteousness=
 what or when we will=20

by calling an election, by holding a public meeting, by getting a president=
, a secretary and a=20

committee on ways and means, by voting the bonds! But they who walk daily t=
hrough groves like=20

this, must in very spite of themselves give some thought to the hand that "=
reared these venerable=20

columns and that thatched the verdant roof!" Now in every French town, we d=
id not find a grove=20

like this. But in every French town we did find something to take its place=
, a historic spot marked=20

with a beautiful stone or bronze; a gently flowing river, whose beauty was =
Caribs (the Bedouins of=20

the rivers of Guiana) produced, was but slight compensation for the evils t=
hat followed in their=20

train, by rendering the tribes more ferocious, and diminishing their popula=
tion. We cannot doubt,=20

that the physical aspect of Greece, intersected by small chains of mountain=
s, and mediterranean=20

gulfs, contributed, at the dawn of civilization, to the intellectual develo=
pment of the Greeks. But the=20

operation of this influence of climate, and of the configuration of the soi=
l, is felt in all its force only=20

among a race of men who, endowed with a happy organization of the mental fa=
culties, are=20

susceptible of exterior impulse. In studying the history of our species, we=
 see, at certain distances,=20

these foci of ancient civilization=20


_
old buildings that recalled the past, a cathedral that had grown almost lik=
e the woods themselves,=20

out of the visions of men into the dreams of men. And these dumb teachers o=
f men have put into=20

the soul of France a fine and exquisite spirit. It rose at the Marne and ma=
de a miracle.  And ever=20

since the Marne that spirit has ruled France. Essentially it is altruistic.=
 Men are not living for=20

themselves. They are struck by the inequality of improvement in nations inh=
abiting analogous=20

climates, and whose native soil appears equally favoured by the most precio=
us gifts of nature.=20

Since my departure from the banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon, a new era =
has unfolded itself=20

in the social state of the nations of the West. The fury of civil discussio=
ns has been succeeded by=20

the blessings of peace, and a freer development=20


_
for something outside themselves; beyond themselves, even beyond the object=
s of their personal=20

affection. Men are living and dying today not for any immediate hope of gai=
n for their friends or=20

families, but for that organized political unit which is a spiritual thing =
called France. We Americans=20

who go to France are agreed that we have never in our lives The bifurcation=
s of the Orinoco, the=20

isthmus of Tuamini, so easy to be made passable by an artificial canal, wil=
l ere long fix the=20

attention of commercial Europe. The Cassiquiare, as broad as the Rhine, and=
 the course of which=20

is one hundred and eighty miles in length, will no longer form uselessly a =
navigable canal between=20

two basins of rivers which have=20

season of their anguish. They are treading the winepress as no other modern=
 nation has trodden=20

it, pressing their hearts' blood into the bitter wine of war. They grumble,=
 of course, as they do their=20

hard stint. The French proverbially are a nation of grumblers. Napoleon too=
k them grumbling for=20

fifteen years to glory. He took them grumbling to Moscow, and brought them =
grumbling back. They=20

grumbled under the Second Empire and into leagues. The grain of New Grenada=
 will be carried to=20

the banks of the Rio Negro; boats will descend from the sources of the Napo=
 and the Ucuyabe,=20

from the Andes of Quito and of Upper Peru, to the mouths of the Orinoco, a =
distance which equals=20

that from Timbuctoo to Marseilles. A country nine or ten times larger than =
Spain, and enriched with=20

the most varied productions, is navigable in every direction by the medium =
of the natural=20


_
they all but grumbled themselves into revolution. One heard revolt whispere=
d in a thousand=20

places. But they did not revolt. They will not revolt. Grumbling is a mere =
outer mannerism. In their=20

hearts they are brave.  Over and over again as we went about France were we=
 impressed with the=20

courage and the tenacity of the French. By very contrast with their eternal=
 grumbling did these=20

traits seem to loom large and definite and certain. We met Dorothy Canfield=
 in Paris, one of the=20

best of the younger American novelists. She told us a most illuminating sto=
ry. She has been two=20

years in France working with the blind, and later superintending the commis=
sary department of a=20

training camp for men in the American Field Ambulance service. She is a shr=
ewd and wise=20

observer, with a real sense of humour, and Heaven knows a sense of humour i=
s necessary if one=20

gets the truth out of the veneer of tragedy that the bifurcation of the riv=
ers. This phenomenon,=20

which will one day be so important for the political connections of nations=
, unquestionably=20

Opposite to the point where the Orinoco forms its bifurcation, the granitic=
 group of Duida rises in=20

an amphitheatre on the right bank of the river. This mountain, which the mi=

This story appeared in Everybody's Magazine in Dorothy Canfield's own words=
.] It seems that she=20

was riding into Paris from her training camp recently, and being tired went=
 to sleep in her=20

compartment, in which were two civilians, too old for military service. She=
 was awakened by a=20

wrangle and then--but let her tell it:  "Then I saw a couple of poilus stic=
king their heads in our=20

window shaking a beret and asking for contributions to help them enjoy thei=
r week's leave of=20

absence in Paris. My two elderly Frenchmen had given a little, under protes=
t, saying (what was=20

perfectly true) that it would go for drink and wouldn't do the poilus any g=
ood. And one of the=20

soldiers was the mission of Esmeralda, a little hamlet with eighty inhabita=
nts, surrounded by a=20

lovely plain, intersected by rills of black but limpid water. This plain is=
 adorned with clumps of the=20

mauritia palm, the sago-tree of America. Nearer the mountain, the distance =
of which from the=20

cross of the mission I found to be seven thousand three hundred toises, the=
 marshy plain changes=20

to a savannah, and spends itself along the lower region of the Cordillera. =

 was received with=20

acclamations, and they inquired to whom should they drink a toast with the =
money. I said, 'Oh,=20
