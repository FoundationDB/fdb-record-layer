strong confirmation of the truth of the vision.  =E2=80=98The whole town, s=

and the shield and lance were seen hanging to the roof, as formerly, over t=

knight,=E2=80=94but the point of the lance was covered with blood.  =E2=80=

had been replaced in=20

the tomb, and the arms under the roof. The point of the lance was covered w=
ith the blood of Julian=20

the apostate, as has been mentioned; and the chronicle adds, that when slai=
n, he received the=20

blood in his hand, saying, _Vicisti me Galil=C3=A6e!_ that is to say, =E2=
=80=98Thou hast conquered me, Galilean!=E2=80=99=20

alluding to JESUS CHRIST, and throwing his blood in the air.  =E2=80=98The =
same chronicle says, that one=20

of the counsellors and sophists of this Julian had a similar vision respect=
ing his miraculous death,=20

and beneath. The wound may reproduce the shape of the weapon, _i.e._, finge=
r-nails, etc. After=20

death the skin becomes brownish-yellow, hard, and dry, and then they are ca=

as a rule. The prognosis is variable, for there may be slow and extensive c=

impairment of function, etc. These wounds usually result from machinery acc=

ended miserably the life of Julian the apostate.  =E2=80=98We have another =
example in the monk Sergius,=20

who was a Christian of the church, but through covetousness got admitted in=
to the company of=20

Mohammed, and became his apostle. This monk, considering that Mohammed was =
a great=20

The injury which causes a contusion or contused wound may not infrequently =

for cases of rapid death following contusions of the abdomen which had caus=
ed extensive rupture=20

of the viscera and abundant hemorrhage. But Vibert gives two cases from his=
 own experience,=20

which are as follows:  A young man, twenty years old, received a kick in th=
