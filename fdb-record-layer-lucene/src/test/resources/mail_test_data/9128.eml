[Illustration: THE GREEK THEATRE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]     CHAPTER VIII 

ACOUSTICS OF THE SITE OF A THEATRE   1. All this having been settled with the greatest 

pains and skill, we must see to it, with still greater care, that a site has been selected where the 

voice has a gentle fall, and is not driven back with a recoil so as to convey an indistinct meaning to 

the ear. There are some places which from their very nature interfere with the course of the voice, 

as for instance the dissonant, which are termed in Greek [Greek: katechountes]; the circumsonant, 

which with them are named [Greek: periechountes]; again the resonant, which are termed [Greek: 

antechountes]; and the consonant, which they call [Greek: synechountes]. The dissonant are 

those places in which the first sound uttered that is  "That man crushes me with his magnanimity." 

This phrase pleased her so much that when she met the artists who knew of her affair with 

Ryabovsky she said every time of her husband, with a vigorous movement of her arm:  "That man 

crushes me with his magnanimity."  Their manner of life was the same as it had been the year 

before. On Wednesdays they were "At Home"; an actor recited, the artists sketched. The 

violoncellist played, a singer sang, and invariably at half-past eleven the door leading to the dining-

room opened and Dymov, smiling, said:  "Come to supper, gentlemen."  As before, Olga Ivanovna 

hunted celebrities, found them, was not satisfied, and went in pursuit of fresh ones. As before, she 

came back late every night; but now Dymov was not, as last year, asleep, but sitting in his study at 

work of some sort. He went to bed at three o'clock and got up at eight.  One evening when she 

was getting ready to go to the theatre and standing before the pier glass, Dymov came into her 

bedroom, 


_
back, checks as it sinks to the bottom the rise of the succeeding sound.  2. The circumsonant are 

those in which the voice spreads all round, and then is forced into the middle, where it dissolves, 

the case-endings are not heard, and it dies away there in sounds of indistinct meaning. The 

resonant are those in which it comes into contact with some solid substance and recoils, thus 

producing an echo, and making the terminations of cases sound double. The consonant are those 

in which it is supported from below, increases as it goes up, and reaches the ears in words which 

are distinct and clear in tone. Hence, if there has been careful attention in the selection of the site, 

the effect of the voice will, through this precaution, be perfectly suited to the purposes of a theatre. 

The drawings of the plans may be distinguished from each other by this difference, that theatres 

designed from squares are meant to be used by Greeks, while Roman theatres are designed from 

equilateral triangles. Whoever is willing to follow these directions will be able to construct perfectly 

correct theatres.     CHAPTER IX  COLONNADES AND WALKS   1. Colonnades must be 

constructed behind the scaena, so that when sudden showers interrupt plays, the people may 

have somewhere to retire from the theatre, and so that there may be room for the preparation of 

all the outfit of the stage. Such places, for instance, are the colonnades of Pompey, and also, in 

Athens, the colonnades of Eumenes and the fane of Father Bacchus; also, as you leave the 

theatre, the music hall which Themistocles surrounded with stone columns, and roofed with the 

yards and masts of ships captured from the Persians. It was burned during the war with 

Mithridates, and afterwards restored by King Ariobarzanes. At Smyrna there is the Stratoniceum, 

at Tralles, a colonnade on each side of the scaena above the race course, and in other cities 

which have had careful architects there are colonnades and walks about the theatres.  2. The 

approved way of building them requires that they should be double, and have Doric columns on 

the outside, with the architraves and their ornaments finished according to the law of modular 

proportion. The approved depth for them requires that the depth, from the lower part of the 

outermost columns to the columns in the middle, and from the middle columns to the wall 

enclosing the walk under the colonnade, should be equal to the height of the outer columns. Let 

dress-coat and a white tie. He was smiling gently and looked into his wife's face joyfully, as in old 

days; his face was radiant.  "I have just been defending my thesis," he said, sitting down and 

smoothing his knees.  "Defending?" asked Olga Ivanovna.  "Oh, oh!" he laughed, and he craned 

his neck to see his wife's face in the mirror, for she was still standing with her back to him, doing 

up her hair. "Oh, oh," he repeated, "do you know it's very possible they may offer me the 

Readership in General Pathology? It seems like it."  It was evident from his beaming, blissful face 

that if Olga Ivanovna had shared with him his joy and triumph he would have forgiven her 

everything, both the present and the future, and would have forgotten everything, but she did not 

understand what was meant by a "readership" or by "general pathology"; besides, she was afraid 

of being late for the theatre, and she said nothing.  He sat there another two minutes, and with a 

guilty smile went away.  VII  It had been a very troubled day.  Dymov had a very bad headache; he 

had no breakfast, and did not go to the hospital, but spent the whole time lying on his sofa in the 

study. Olga Ivanovna went as usual at midday to see Ryabovsky, to show him her still-life sketch, 

and to ask him why he had not been to see her the evening before. The sketch seemed to her 

worthless, and she had painted it only in order to have an additional reason for going to the artist. 

She went in to him without ringing, and as she was taking off her goloshes in the entry she heard a 



sound as of something running softly in the studio, with a feminine rustle of skirts; and as she 

hastened to peep in she caught a momentary glimpse of a bit of brown petticoat, which vanished 

behind a big picture draped, together with the easel, with black calico, to the floor. There could be 

no doubt that a woman was hiding there. How often Olga Ivanovna herself had taken refuge 

behind that picture!  Ryabovsky, evidently much embarrassed, held out both hands to her, as 

though surprised at her arrival, and said with a forced smile:  "Aha! Very glad to see you! Anything 

nice to tell me?"  Olga Ivanovna's eyes filled with tears. She felt ashamed and bitter, and would 

not for a million roubles have consented to speak in the presence of the outsider, the rival, the 

deceitful woman who was standing now behind the picture, and probably giggling malignantly.  "I 

have brought you a sketch," she said 


_
fifth higher than the outer columns, and designed in the Ionic or Corinthian style.  3. The columns 

will not be subject to the same rules of symmetry and proportion which I prescribed in the case of 

sanctuaries; for the dignity which ought to be their quality in temples of the gods is one thing, but 

their elegance in colonnades and other public works is quite another. Hence, if the lips quivered. 

"_Nature morte._"  "Ah--ah!... A sketch?"  The artist took the sketch in his hands, and as he 

examined it walked, as it were mechanically, into the other room.  Olga Ivanovna followed him 

humbly.  "_Nature morte_... first-rate sort," he muttered, falling into rhyme. "Kurort... sport... port..." 

From the studio came the sound of hurried footsteps and the rustle of a 


_
height, including the capital, be measured off into fifteen parts. Of these parts, let one be fixed 

upon to form the module, and in accordance with this module the whole work is to be developed. 

Let the thickness of the columns at the bottom be two modules; an intercolumniation, five and a 

half modules; the height of a column, excluding the capital, fourteen modules; the capital, one 

module in height and two and one sixth modules in breadth. Let the modular proportions of the 

rest of the work be carried out as written in the fourth book in the case of temples.  4. But if the 

columns are to be Ionic, let the  So she had gone. Olga Ivanovna wanted to scream aloud, to hit 

the artist on the head with something heavy, but she could see nothing through her tears, was 

crushed by her shame, and felt herself, not Olga Ivanovna, not an artist, but a little insect.  "I am 

tired..." said the artist languidly, looking at the sketch and tossing his head as though struggling 

with drowsiness. "It's very nice, of course, but here a sketch today, a sketch last year, another 

sketch in a month... I wonder you are not bored with them. If I were you I should give up painting 

and work seriously at music or something. You're not an

capital, be divided into eight and one half parts, and let one of these be assigned to the thickness 

of a column. Let the base, including the plinth, be fixed at half the thickness, and let the 

proportions of the capital be as shown in the third book. If the column is to be Corinthian, let its 

shaft and base be proportioned as in the Ionic, but its capital, as has been written in the fourth 

book. In the am! I'll tell them to bring us some tea, shall I?"  He went out of the room, and Olga 

Ivanovna heard him give some order to his footman. To avoid farewells and explanations, and 

above all to avoid bursting into sobs, she ran as fast as she could, before Ryabovsky came back, 

to the entry, put on her goloshes, and went out into the street; then she breathed easily, and felt 

she was free for ever from Ryabovsky
