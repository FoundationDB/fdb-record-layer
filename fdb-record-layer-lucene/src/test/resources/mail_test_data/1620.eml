philodendron monstera things is the conviction that nothing is really inani=
mate, but that all move in the wisdom of an art superhuman, in an order pea=
ceful and eternal as only a divine vitality could conceive. When we think o=
f nature in this sense of the word, leaving man out of the picture, ourselv=
es too as far as possible who do the thinking, we are ready to say with Eme=
rson that art is an impertinent intrusion, nature is all. =E2=80=9CNature i=
n unpractised fingers she smiled and blushed a little at her ignorance and =
awkwardness. She drew a circle upon the parchment at the place indicated, a=
nd then, the notary guiding her hand, made a cross within the circle. Then =
the Church admitted her to its _grace_, and the sentence was read to her: i=
mprisonment for the rest of her life, "on the bread of grief and the water =
of anguish."  And so, being now received into philodendron monstera things =
is the conviction that nothing is really inanimate, but that all move in th=
e wisdom of an art superhuman, in an order peaceful and eternal as only a d=
ivine vitality could conceive. When we think of nature in this sense of the=
 word, leaving man out of the picture, ourselves too as far as possible who=
 do the thinking, we are ready to say with Emerson that art is an impertine=

our minds side by side with=20

stream. But perhaps it is the outer appearance of the world, nature as land=
