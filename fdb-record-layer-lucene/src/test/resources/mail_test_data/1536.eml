philodendron monstera nearly all my Sundays in one or two such irregular ho=
mes--  MANDERS. Sunday of all days!  OSWALD. Isn't that the day to enjoy on=
e's self? Well, never have I heard an offensive word, and still less have I=
 witnessed anything that could be called immoral. No; do you know advantage=
 to be gained from a campaign on Northern soil. War-worn Virginia was to re=
ceive a respite; Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, as well as Washington, =
might be terrorized, and perhaps captured. If only the good-fortune so far =
enjoyed would continue, the Union=E2=80=99s philodendron monstera nearly al=

OSWALD. It ought to, indeed.  MANDERS. It was good of you to come home for =
the ceremony in=20

his honour.  OSWALD. I could do no less for my father.  MRS. ALVING. And I =
am to keep him so=20

long! That is the best of all.  MANDERS. You are going to pass the winter a=
t home, I hear.=20

OSWALD. My stay is indefinite, sir. But, ah! it is good to be at home!  MRS=
. ALVING. [Beaming.]=20

Yes, isn't it, dear?  MANDERS. [Looking sympathetically at him.] You went o=
ut into the world early,=20

my dear Oswald.  OSWALD. I did. I sometimes wonder whether it wasn't too ea=
rly.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Oh, not at all. A healthy lad is all the better for it; especially =
when he's an only child. He=20

oughtn't to hang on at home with his mother and father, and get spoilt.  MA=
NDERS. That is a very=20

disputable point, Mrs. Alving. A child's proper place is, and must be, the =
home of his fathers.=20

OSWALD. There I quite agree with you, Pastor Manders.  MANDERS. Only look a=
t your own son--

there is no reason why we should not say it in his presence--what has the c=
onsequence been for=20

him? He is six or seven and twenty, and has never had the opportunity of le=
arning what a well-

ordered home really is.  OSWALD. I beg your pardon, Pastor; there you're qu=
ite mistaken.=20

MANDERS. Indeed? I thought you had lived almost exclusively in artistic cir=
cles.  OSWALD. So I=20

have.  MANDERS. And chiefly among the younger artists?  OSWALD. Yes, certai=
nly.  MANDERS.=20

But I thought few of those young fellows could afford to set up house and s=
upport a family.=20

OSWALD. There are many who cannot afford to marry, sir.  MANDERS. Yes, that=
 is just what I=20

say.  OSWALD. But they may have a home for all that. And several of them ha=
ve, as a matter of=20

fact; and very pleasant, well-ordered homes they are, too.  [MRS. ALVING fo=
llows with breathless=20

interest; nods, but says nothing.]  MANDERS. But I'm not talking of bachelo=
rs' quarters. By a=20

"home" I understand the home of a family, where a man lives with his wife a=
nd children.=20

OSWALD. Yes; or with his children and his children's mother.  MANDERS. [Sta=
rts; clasps his=20

hands.] But, good heavens--  OSWALD. Well?  MANDERS. Lives with--his childr=
en's mother!=20

OSWALD. Yes. Would you have him turn his children's mother out of doors?  M=
ANDERS. Then it=20

is illicit relations you are talking of! Irregular marriages, as people cal=
l them!  OSWALD. I have=20

never noticed anything particularly irregular about the life these people l=
ead.  MANDERS. But how=20

is it possible that a--a young man or young woman with any decency of feeli=
ng can endure to live=20

in that way?--in the eyes of all the world!  OSWALD. What are they to do? A=
 poor young artist--a=20

poor girl--marriage costs a great deal. What are they to do?  MANDERS. What=
 are they to do? Let=20

me tell you, Mr. Alving, what they ought to do. They ought to which fortres=
s, after a six weeks=E2=80=99=20

siege, marked by two spirited assaults, he brought to great distress. Its f=
ate was sealed by the fall=20

of Vicksburg--Gardner, the commander, on July 9th, surrendering the post wi=
th more than six=20

thousand men and fifty-one guns.  The capture of Vicksburg and Port Hudson =
was a success such=20

as had not been achieved before during our Civil War, and was not parallele=
d afterward until=20

Appomattox. In military history there are few achievements which equal it; =
and the magnitude of=20

the captures of men and resources is no more remarkable than are the unfail=
ing courage of the=20

soldiers and the genius and vigor of the general.[242]     XIX  GETTYSBURG,=
 JULY 1=E2=80=933, 1863=20

In the Eastern field of operations in the American Civil War,   McClellan=
=E2=80=99s organization of the Army=20

of the Potomac had given him   a well-disciplined force, with which he was =
facing General Joseph=20

Johnston at the opening of 1862. But the Peninsular Campaign which   McClel=
lan entered upon=20

early in the year, with the bloody fighting   at Fair Oaks in May, and the =
Seven Days=E2=80=99 Battles in=20

May and June,   resulted in the withdrawal of the Northern forces. There fo=
llowed   Pope=E2=80=99s defeat=20



near Bull Run. The forward movement was a failure.   The Northern forces, o=
nly four miles from=20

Richmond in June, were   practically defending Washington in September. The=
 desperate battle=20

of Antietam checked Lee=E2=80=99s movement into Maryland, but was not   dec=
isive. Burnside=E2=80=99s costly=20

defeat at Fredericksburg in December   closed a gloomy year in the East, wh=
ich to many seemed=20

to show   that the South could more than hold its own. The new year brought=
   a renewal of=20

disaster to the Northern arms in Hooker=E2=80=99s defeat in   the hard-foug=
ht battle of Chancellorsville. But=20

the tide was to be   turned by one of the crucial events of military histor=
y, which was   close at=20

hand.--EDITOR.   The fall of Vicksburg, though a terrible blow to the South=
, was not a sudden one:=20

to all intelligent eyes it had for some weeks been impending; but that Lee =
could be defeated=20

seemed a thing impossible. Because so long unconquered, it had come to be a=
ccepted that he=20

was unconquerable.  Hooker soon recovered from the daze into which he had b=
een thrown at=20

Chancellorsville. His confidence in himself was not broken by his misfortun=
e. Instead of, like=20

Burnside, manfully shouldering most of the responsibility of his failure, H=
ooker vehemently=20

accused his lieutenants of misconduct, and faced the new situation with as =
much resolution as if=20

he had the prestige of a victor. The Army of the Potomac, never down in hea=
rt except for a=20

moment, plucked up courage forthwith and girded itself for new encounters. =
 The South,=20

meanwhile, was still rejoicing over Chancellorsville, for the cloud on the =
southwestern horizon was=20

is what they ought to do.  OSWALD. That doctrine will scarcely go down with=
 warm-blooded young=20

people who love each other.  MRS. ALVING. No, scarcely!  MANDERS. [Continui=
ng.] How can the=20

authorities tolerate such things! Allow them to go on in the light of day! =
[Confronting MRS.=20

ALVING.] Had I not cause to be deeply concerned about your son? In circles =
where open=20

immorality prevails, and has even a sort of recognised position--!  OSWALD.=
 Let me tell you, sir,=20

that I have been in the habit man=E2=80=99s hand. Longstreet joined Lee fro=
m Suffolk with two divisions,=20

swelling the Army of Northern Virginia to eighty thousand or more. Never be=
fore had it been so=20

numerous, so well appointed, or in such good heart. The numerical advantage=
 which the Federals=20

had heretofore enjoyed was at this time nearly gone, because thousands of e=
nlistments expired=20

which could not immediately be made good; volunteering had nearly ceased, a=
nd the new=20

schemes for recruiting were not yet effective.  Lee took=20
