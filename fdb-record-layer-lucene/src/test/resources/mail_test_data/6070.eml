portrayed, that will make a book seem contemporary. But we are left to wond=
er also whether=20

Thackeray did not intend _Vanity Fair_ to be more satirical in its effect t=
han it actually is, and _The=20

Newcomes_ to be less so. Did the great but easy-going artist make here a ca=
reless choice of the=20

time for his story?  Even the writers who seem now to have been most contem=
porary were really=20

not so; what seems contemporary in them are eternal aspects of life, which =
even in their day were=20

old. We sometimes doubt the value of those scholarly labors which search ou=
t for us the sources,=20

so-called, of the great poets, the residuum of earlier times which they ada=
pted to express their=20

genius; but these labors would be justified sufficiently by the answer they=
 give to those who think=20

that art speaks through contemporary life. They think that we should look i=
n our heart and write, as=20

Sidney did, or return directly to nature, as did Wordsworth, forgetting tha=
t when Sidney looked in=20

his heart to write, he wrote some masterly translations and paraphrases of =
earlier Italian or French=20

poems, and that when Wordsworth drew on his personal experience, as in the =
immortal lines to=20

the Cuckoo, he recast an earlier fine poem by Michael Bruce. The believers =
in the contemporary=20

urge us to paint the record of our own times as immediately as Chaucer wove=
 his neighbors into=20

the tapestry of the Canterbury Tales; they do not know how many versions th=
ere were of the=20

famous tales before Chaucer shaped them to his own purposes. Indeed, so muc=
h of the past has=20

gone into all that we now are or say or do, that the attempt to detach ours=
elves from the best that=20

has gone before is in a way a denial of contemporary character to our own t=
imes, or to any other=20

period; for the quality of civilization in 1923 which distinguishes it from=
 civilization in 1823 is the=20

gift, for good or evil, of the hundred years in between; and to be contempo=
rary with any moment in=20

history is to be aware of all the past that still is articulate in that mom=
ent.   III  If a writer fails to use=20

the past as the language with which to express his present, the reason may =
be that he does not=20

know the past, or that he has theoretical objections to using it so, even t=
hough the great writers=20

have followed no other method. But this reason is rarely the true one. Toda=
y as at other times any=20

sincere writer will be interested in the great examples of his art, and wil=
l find them out, and=20

probably the same instincts will eventually show themselves in his work as =
in the work of his=20

predecessors. Undoubtedly there are poets and novelists today who through a=
 mistaken cult of the=20

natural are striving for a strictly contemporary utterance=E2=80=94rejectin=
g, that is, all that they can=20

recognize in our speech as having a history. If their scholarship were more=
 complete, they would=20

have to reject even the meagre vocabulary of word, image and legend they ar=
e now content to=20

use. But the writer who willingly would avail himself of the full inheritan=
ce in his art finds himself=20

limited perhaps for another reason=E2=80=94he finds that his readers do not=
 know the past, that many of=20

them cultivate an ignorance of it, and that, therefore, if he uses it to sp=
eak with, he may not be=20

understood. It is part of the discipline which every art imposes on those w=
ho practise it, that they=20

must speak in terms intelligible to their audience. It remains to ask, of c=
ourse, who are the=20

audience? and the writer, if he is sufficiently courageous, stubborn, or ho=
peful, may choose to=20

address a more intelligent audience than first of a long series that would =
culminate in the actual=20

seizure of French Burgundy as soon as Louis should feel himself strong enou=
gh. But though Louis=20

was the ultimate and the greater danger, he could be put off, it was though=
t, by conciliatory=20

messages; an immediate danger lay in turbulent Flanders, which even the str=
ong duke could not=20

master, and which now, in the midst of much exuberant devotion for mademois=
elle, kept her in a=20



state of constant uneasiness. Something must be done to quiet the Flemings.=
  Marie, in imitation=20

of all new-made sovereigns whose crowns are none too secure, began by grant=
ing most liberal=20

charters and privileges to her loyal subjects in Flanders. For the most par=
t, the liberties thus=20

granted had been ancient liberties, temporarily denied under the Burgundian=
s, and now resumed=20

by the people with or without the official consent of their duchess. The Gh=
enters at once exercised=20

their right of being their own judges, and arrested the magistrates who had=
 dared to surrender the=20

city's liberties to Charles and had governed in his name. But neither the g=
ranting of privileges to=20

Flanders nor the grateful affection of the Ghenters could defend from Louis=
 Picardy and the=20

coveted towns on the Somme; money must be had, and the generous commons of =
Flanders were=20

appealed to. This congress of the estates of Flanders, Artois, Hainault, Br=
abant, and Namur met at=20

Ghent on February 3, 1477, less than a month after the death of Charles. Ma=
rie repeated to the=20

delegates her assurances, her oaths, her promises, and granted the "Great P=
rivilege," a sort of=20

Magna Charta and Bill of Rights in the history of Holland. The special priv=
ileges enumerated in this=20

grant are not novel; the grant was intended merely as a formal restatement-=
-to be formally ratified=20

by the sovereign--of those inalienable and indefeasible rights of the subje=
ct which were not=20

recognized in most countries for many a decade to come. "It was a recapitul=
ation and recognition=20

of ancient rights, not an acquisition of new privileges. It was a restorati=
on, not a revolution." The=20

nature of the rights asserted by the subject and admitted by the sovereign =
may be easily gathered=20

from a glance at one or two. "Offices shall be conferred by the duchess upo=
n natives alone; and=20

no man shall fill two offices. No office shall be farmed out. The great Cou=
ncil and Supreme Court=20

of the provinces shall be re-established.... No new taxes may be imposed bu=
t by consent of the=20

estates. No war, whether offensive or defensive, shall be begun by the duch=
ess or any of her=20

successors without the consent of the estates.... No money shall be coined,=
 nor shall its value be=20

raised or lowered, except by consent of the estates." If the principles her=
e enunciated could have=20

been made good in practice, the liberties of Marie's subjects would indeed =
have been secure; but=20

much of this Great Privilege, as well as of the similar charters granted to=
 other provinces, was pure=20

theory, and Marie no more meant to abide by her oath of ratification than K=
ing John had meant to=20

observe the provisions of Magna Charta. For the present, however, she must =
feign to be right well=20

pleased, though her cautious and devoted subjects had not granted her the a=
id she wanted, to be=20

used as she saw fit. All negotiations would be conducted in her name, of co=
urse, but in dealing=20

with Louis she must be guided by the counsel of the estates; and the estate=
s would levy an army=20

of a hundred thousand men for her--when it suited them to do so. That was t=
he sum and=20

substance of all that Marie could cajole them into granting.  Meanwhile, Lo=
uis was making ready to=20

seize Burgundy and Picardy,=20


_
an audience who he thinks will at last recover the traditional tongue in wh=
ich he speaks, and for=20

whom it will be worth his while to wait. This may seem to some of us the on=
ly way out, but we=20

know it is a precarious way. Such a brilliant belated justification came to=
 the Greek classics at the=20

Renaissance; it has come in music to such a giant as Bach, who was, as we s=
ay, ahead of his=20

own day; but to expect it to come to us merely because our contemporaries d=
o not appreciate us=20

is entirely too obvious a self-flattery. The sane artist will rather do his=
 best to say what he has to=20

say in language his day understands, and he will try also to encourage his =
audience in the=20

recovery of a larger language, so that he may say more to them.  This quest=
ion whether the reader=20

has sufficient command of the inherited language of literature is always an=
 acute one for the=20

author; the lasting successes in literature have been made at those moments=
 when a knowledge=20

of the past was wide-spread, and the audience were as familiar with the old=
er literature as the=20

writers were. Historical as Virgil seems to us in the _=C3=86neid_, almost =
antiquarian, he offered to his=20

first readers nothing they were not familiar with, and little that would no=
t immediately kindle an=20

emotion. In one sense then he may be said to have spoken in a contemporary =
language. But=20

neither he nor his audience would have understood the doctrine that art bec=
omes great by being=20

contemporary, and that it becomes contemporary by discrediting the past. =
=E2=80=9CTo have great poets,=20

there must be great audiences too=E2=80=9D, said Whitman, and here, as else=
where, we are coming to=20

realize, he got at the permanent truth of the matter. For it is a sound obs=
ervation of literary=20

historians that a country exercises its impulses toward art, in any period,=
 as much by what it reads=20

of the older books as by what it writes; the two activities must go togethe=
r if the contemporary=20

great writer is to get a competent hearing, and they must be studied togeth=
er if we are to estimate=20

justly the culture of an epoch. In what was produced, some decades of the e=
ighteenth century in=20

England look to us destitute of poetry, but in those very moments Spenser, =
Shakespeare and=20

Milton were widely loved, and enjoyed perhaps a more humane and significant=
 treatment from the=20

critics than they have often had since. The weakness of contemporary poetry=
 in Addison=E2=80=99s time, in=20

Warton=E2=80=99s and Gray=E2=80=99s, was not that they knew the elder maste=
rs, but that their practise departed so=20

widely from them and became so contemporary. The revival in the romantic ag=
e was brought=20

about by rejecting the kind of art the early eighteenth century wrote, and =
by building on the still=20

earlier art the eighteenth century had the wisdom to love.  In our day and =
in our land the question=20

of the audience is peculiarly acute, and it has been rendered more so by th=
e intentional efforts of=20

those who believe that literature should be contemporary. Even without thos=
e efforts we, who=20

come from many countries, with different race memories and with the legacy =
of different cultures,=20

should have had difficulty enough to achieve a common language adequately r=
ich in the best=20

things of the past and welded into some continuity with our American future=
. If we write in those=20

terms which to an Italian would be emotional, we shall hardly stir the puls=
es of a Scotchman or a=20

Slav, and if we waken the race-memories of the Spanish or the French, we ma=
y leave quite cold=20

the Dutch in Pennsylvania or the Swede in Minnesota. Our first hope, to whi=
ch some of us still=20

desperately cling, is that we may lose no one of these racial inheritances,=
 but that by a jealous=20

conserving and study of each of them, and by teaching them all to our child=
ren, we may build up=20

one of the richest cultures that the accidents of migration have ever permi=
tted the race to=20

compose. The literature of America in a thousand years would carry in its m=
ajestic overtones the=20

essential beauty of all the civilizations that have made their entry throug=
h our ports, the essential=20



beauty too of the wonderful Indian civilizations which our European coming =
dispossessed, and=20

above these overtones, perhaps, the far-off suggestions of the Greek and Ro=
man worlds and the=20

immemorial East.  But this hope, whether or not it could be realized, is so=
 far as we can see at=20

present a fantastic dream; our progress toward it has been slight=E2=80=94b=
etter, to be frank, we have=20

made no progress, rather we have lost ground. There is less general culture=
 of that sort in the=20

United States now than there was fifty years ago. It has seemed wise to man=
y of us, therefore, to=20

moderate our hopes, and to aim at mastering, not all our heritages in commo=
n, but at least one=20

tradition, and that the tradition of this country from the revolution till =
the present day. Such a=20

program might be carried out in our schools=E2=80=94not in the colleges, si=
nce only a fraction of the=20

country=E2=80=99s youth gets to college, but in those early school years th=
rough which all the boys and girls=20

may reasonably be expected to pass; and there would be nothing illogical in=
 burdening the schools=20

with the task, for the training of a common consciousness, cultural or othe=
rwise, in a land of=20

immigrants is the chief problem of elementary education. We thought, then, =
that we might all=20

absorb our own past and the few decades that preceded our coming, so that h=
ereafter the=20

spokesmen of the nation, poets, dramatists, preachers, statesmen, might at =
least touch some=20

common chords in us all by naming those who built up the opportunities we e=
njoy. This program is=20

still in force in other departments of study than literature, but the teach=
ers of literature have been=20

largely won over to the cult of the contemporary; so far from building up i=
n the land a great=20

audience for the great poets to sing to, many energetic teachers of literat=
ure are persuading these=20

children, if persuasion is necessary, to read only books of the day, about =
things of the day, and by=20

inference to neglect as really negligible anything written yesterday or wri=
tten about other times and=20

other problems than ours. Our dream of a cosmopolitan culture has shrunk in=
 practise to an=20

educational discipline which will make us more insular and provincial than =
we are already, more=20

selfish, more contemptuous of other times and of other peoples, and still f=
urther disinherited from=20

great art.  The movement began a few years ago in a protest against the nar=
row choice of books=20

permitted by the requirements for entrance to college. Some of the schools =
thought they could do=20

their best work if their teachers=E2=80=94and their pupils=E2=80=94could se=
lect the books for this arduous study;=20

there could be some wise consulting of taste, some adaptation to special te=
mperaments. So long=20

as the choice was still to be made from books of recognized merit, it was u=
nreasonable to deny=20

this request. But the trend toward the contemporary developed quickly; if w=
e consulted the taste=20

and the temperament of our students, the children of many racial traditions=
, we found that few of=20

the older writers were easy for them to understand; the difficulty of bridg=
ing over the gap between=20

traditions was too great for many of our teachers to solve, or perhaps they=
 themselves were not at=20

home in the tradition either of the books or of the students; and the most =
graceful form of=20

surrender was to study only what was easy for everybody. The process was pa=
ralleled in society=20

outside of the schoolroom, in the change in ideals and in every seizure the=
 appearance of legality,=20

but bent on seizing, right or wrong. Marie despatched two of her father's o=
ldest advisers, the=20

chancellor Hugonet and the lord of Humbercourt, as ambassadors to Louis, to=
 delay his=20

proceedings. Though faithful to the interests of their duchess, Hugonet and=
 Humbercourt were no=20

match for the crafty king. He had already tampered with other servants of B=
urgundy, and had=20

found few who could not be made to see that French gold or French titles we=
re better worth=20

considering than any favors received from a master who could no longer rewa=
rd. Of this class was=20



the Lord of Crevecoeur, whose mother had been the guardian of the young duc=
hess when she=20

had no mother, and to whom one of the most important charges in Burgundy ha=
d been deputed,=20

the governorship of Picardy and of the towns on the Somme. Crevecoeur was a=
 knight of the=20

Toison d'Or, and had received countless other favors from Charles, whose da=
ughter he was now=20

willing to betray. What Louis most desired was Arras; this my Lord of Creve=
coeur held for=20

Burgundy; might there not be found some legal subterfuge or quibble authori=
zing him to hold it for=20

the king? Louis cajoled, entreated, almost menaced, the Burgundian envoys, =
till they, thinking he=20

would have Arras anyway, yielded so far as to issue an order to Crevecoeur,=
 signed by the=20

chancellor, Hugonet, authorizing him to open the gates of the town to the k=
ing. Louis entered Arras=20

on March 4th, and Marie soon found that her troubles had but just begun.  W=
hen the news of the=20

surrender of Arras reached Ghent the citizens were furious, and demanded sa=
tisfaction from those=20

who had betrayed the public trust. A fresh embassy went, from the States th=
is time, to meet Louis,=20

who was advancing through Picardy. Marie had to consent to this embassy, an=
d doubtless thought=20

that little harm would come of it; but the unscrupulous Louis knew how to d=
eal with the burghers,=20

and no considerations of honor hindered him from using any means in his pow=
er to sow the seeds=20

of suspicion between the burghers and their duchess. When the embassy remon=
strated with him=20

for the desire to despoil the young heiress and told him that "there was no=
 harm in her, that they=20

could answer for her prudence and good faith, since she had publicly sworn =
to be guided by the=20

Council of the States in all things," Louis assumed an injured air. "You ar=
e deceived," he said,=20

"your mistress means to be guided by the advice of persons who do not desir=
e peace." The=20

envoys, thinking that Marie had been perfectly sincere and frank, refused t=
o credit ill of her. Then=20

Louis showed them a private note, in Marie's own hand, telling him that she=
 would be guided=20

solely by the advice of the court party and of Hugonet and Humbercourt in p=
articular, and begging=20

him to keep this secret from the envoys of the States.  Enraged and mortifi=
ed by this scandalous=20

duplicity the burgher envoys returned hastily to Ghent. The duchess receive=
d them in solemn=20

audience, seated upon her throne and surrounded by her courtiers. With grea=
t show of indignation=20

she denied the allegations of the king. "Here is your own letter," said the=
 chief of the envoys,=20

drawing it forth from his bosom. Marie was overwhelmed with confusion, and =
knew not what to=20

say. She trembled even for her own safety, now that this royal personage, i=
n defiance of the=20

comity of princes, had betrayed her to her own subjects. The duplicity of w=
hich she had been guilty=20

was not so reprehensible as it seems to us; the blame of it rests more upon=
 her advisers than=20

upon her, and she was but a weak girl, encompassed by selfish intriguers an=
d plotters who sought=20

to rob her of that which she had been taught to regard as her unquestioned =
right.  The most=20

conspicuous of her counsellors, though not by any means the ones solely res=
ponsible for this=20

unfortunate letter, were Hugonet and Humbercourt, who, feeling that the Ghe=
nters would take=20

vengeance upon them, threw themselves into a monastery immediately after th=
e fatal audience,=20

but were dragged out of the sanctuary that very night. Marie, faithful to t=
hose who had been faithful=20

to her, would gladly have saved them, but upon the mere rumor that the pris=
oners would be=20

allowed to escape the Ghenters flew to arms, congregated in the Friday mark=
et place, and,=20

asserting their ancient right of permanent assembly in time of danger, camp=
ed there day and night=20

till the two envoys were tried and executed. Marie might have claimed that =
the unhappy victims,=20

being ducal officers, should be delivered over to the Grand Council for tri=
al; but in view of the=20



excited state of popular feeling even that was not to be thought of. And wh=
en she nominated a=20

commission in which thirty out of thirty-six were citizens of Ghent, that t=
oo was insufficient=20

assurance that the accused would be convicted; the citizens would have the =
whole affair in their=20

own hands; their privileges had been tampered with, and they alone should p=
unish the offenders.=20

Marie did not even yet relax her efforts on behalf of Hugonet and Humbercou=
rt; her determined=20

fidelity to what she considered a sacred duty the protection of those who h=
ad risked themselves in=20

her service is the best trait in her character. The gratitude of princes is=
 not usually a burdensome=20

obligation to them; but the best principles of chivalry had been instilled =
into Marie, and, like her=20

rash but generous father, she would risk all on a point of honor. She sent =
representatives of the=20

nobles to sit with the burgher's court, though they could take no part in t=
he proceedings, and must=20

be mere spectators of a judgment already resolved upon. When the supreme mo=
ment=20

approached, Marie herself went to implore mercy for her servants. Dressed a=
s a simple Flemish=20

maiden, with the citizen's cap upon her head, she went on foot and unattend=
ed by guard or=20

courtier or even so much as a lady of her suite, through the angry crowd in=
 the market place to the=20

Town Hall, where the court sat.  But the judges themselves were more overaw=
ed by the relentless=20

crowd whose angry murmurs penetrated to them than by the presence of their =
lady. Pity her they=20

did; but as one of them said, pointing to the crowd: "We must satisfy the p=
eople." Not daunted by=20

this failure, Marie went among the people themselves, those loving yet terr=
ible subjects who had=20

gathered to see that their will was carried out. In Friday market place she=
 went from one to=20

another, weeping, with clasped hands imploring them not to punish servants =
who had merely=20

obeyed her commands. The sight of this defenceless girl, braving dangers in=
 such a cause and=20

venturing among a people whom she had offended, moved many to hearken to he=
r plea. The men=20

began to separate into two parties, those who could hear and see their lady=
 inclining to her side,=20

those farther off, removed from the direct influence of her presence, clamo=
ring for justice upon the=20

accused. Pikes were ranged against pikes, and there was imminent danger of =
a conflict; but the=20

partisans of the duchess were in the minority, and their enthusiasm in her =
cause waned when they=20

realized the danger of a civil broil. Marie's courageous appeal served only=
 to hurry on the trial,=20

since the judges were determined not to risk another scene fraught with suc=
h dangers.  Hugonet=20

and Humbercourt were put to the torture, and confessed what was enough to c=
onvict them, though=20

it was what everyone already knew: that they had surrendered Arras. Humberc=
ourt, a knight of the=20

Toison d'Or, appealed=20


_
professed criticism in our reviews; but the heart of the matter was and sti=
ll is in the centers of=20

education.  A teacher of English in New York City recently presented the ca=
se for contemporary=20

literature vs. the classics, in some such argument as this: When she was in=
 college, she said, the=20

faculty took such an inhospitable view of the world about them that only on=
e author, of all those=20

they studied in literature classes, was still alive when they studied his b=
ooks. She and her fellow=20

students felt somehow cramped and cheated, not to be studying more books of=
 which the authors=20

were still living. In other words, whereas the critics in Mr. Shaw=E2=80=99=
s play could not judge the work till=20

they knew who wrote it, these lovers of the contemporary could not estimate=
 a book till they knew=20

whether the author was in or out of the graveyard. In these better days, th=
e teacher went on to=20

say, she and her colleagues allow for the natural desire of their students =
to read what is written at=20

the moment=E2=80=94a life of a prominent man like Theodore Roosevelt, the w=
ork of a columnist in the=20

daily press, the popular plays, the most talked-of novels. Such reading, sh=
e explained, gives=20

opportunity for ethical or social or political discussion in class; she mea=
nt, it seems, that you can=20

argue whether the Middle West was fairly portrayed, and if so, what should =
be done to cure it, or=20

whether we should have gone into the war at all, or if so, what should have=
 been done to make the=20

lot of the private easier, and establish the officer on a less privileged p=
lane. Out of this open=20

discussion of spontaneous interest in current events, will come, she though=
t, a finer taste for the=20

best in art.  It is obvious that the training, such as it is, which is to p=
roduce this finer taste is a=20

training not in art at all, but in Americanization, if you choose to call i=
t so, in sociology or in politics.=20

These purposes are good in their place, but if they usurp the classroom whe=
re literature as an art=20

should be taught, we need expect no aid from the schools in training us to =
a common culture, not=20

at least so far as the word applies to poetry, to romance, to the drama, to=
 the novel. We might=20

Americanize ourselves in literature by reading our older poets=E2=80=94thre=
e of them, Whitman, Poe and=20

Emerson, of influence in the whole world today; we might read our elder nov=
elists, two of whom,=20

Cooper and Hawthorne, at their best were among the prose-poets of the ninet=
eenth century; or we=20

might read Parkman, an historian not likely to be surpassed for the beauty =
of his spirit, for the=20

solidity of his method, and for the romantic charm of his subject, by any w=
ho will hereafter write=20

about but legal forms could not be respected in this crisis. When the court=
 presented the=20

confessions and the sentence to the young duchess, a formality with which, =
in all their disregard of=20

legal forms, they thought it necessary to comply, she protested again, wept=
, entreated. All was=20

vain: "Madam," said they, "you have sworn to do justice not only upon the p=
oor, but upon the rich."=20

The two nobles were placed in the condemned cart--where, on account of the =
injuries received in=20

the torture, they could not stand--and led to execution. The people had suc=
ceeded in destroying=20

those who had dared to disregard their wishes; the sovereign of Burgundy wa=
s completely in their=20

power. They declared themselves her most fitting guardians and counsellors,=
 deprived her of the=20

comfort of having even members of her family about her, and proposed to fin=
d a husband for her=20

more suitable than any suggested by the nobles.  To all of this Marie was f=
orced to submit with=20

what grace she could; but upon the matter of a husband she was resolved to =
have something to=20

say for herself. No less than six suitors had some sort of claim to her, be=
sides the one to whom=20

her father had betrothed her in 1473. There was the dauphin, a mere boy of =
eight, for whom Louis=20

was intriguing; there was, at the other extreme, the worthless and worn-out=
 profligate, Clarence,=20

whom Margaret of York hoped to establish in this new and rich nest; there w=
as the fierce and cruel=20



Adolphus of Guelders, who had ended a career of crime in prison, and whom t=
he Ghenters meant=20

to take out of prison that he might be their duke and leader: then there we=
re the English Lord=20

Rivers, brother of England's queen, and the son of the Lord of Ravenstein, =
and the son of the=20

Duke of Cleves. In the whole list there was not one whom the poor girl coul=
d have considered with=20

anything but aversion. The worst of all, both politically and personally, w=
as the dauphin; the idea of=20

contracting a marriage with a mere child, and that child the son of her mos=
t dangerous enemy,=20

was revolting to Marie's feelings, so lately excited by the death of her tw=
o servants, betrayed by=20

Louis. At her very court she was surrounded by spies, who, pretending to sy=
mpathize with her and=20

console her, reported to Louis or to the emperor all the intimate confidenc=
es of the poor girl.  The=20

interest of Austria finally seemed to be in the ascendant, for now Margaret=
, despairing of making=20

Clarence acceptable either to the young lady or to her subjects or even to =
Edward IV., had thrown=20

her influence on the side of Maximilian, and the influence of France in the=
 Burgundian councils=20

had been ruined by the manifest determination of the=20


_
land. We might read Lincoln, about whom we talk so much, and we might profi=
tably read Jefferson=20

and Hamilton. We might even discover the charm of the colonial records, nor=
th and south, and the=20

heroic poetry of our frontier, as it pushed through wilderness and across p=
lain and canyon, to face=20

at last the Orient again and our inscrutable future. absorb all French Burg=
undy, all Flanders, if he=20

could get it. There had not been sufficient time for the growth of real nat=
ional feeling in the ill-

assorted and scattered provinces of the duchy; but the non-French parts of =
Burgundy, at least, by=20

no means relished the idea of losing their identity and becoming parts of F=
rance.  Personal=20

reasons=20


_
of Americanization would produce class discussion of some dignity, even tho=
ugh it had nothing to=20

do immediately with the art of literature, for it would give us, not only a=
 sense of our common=20

destiny, but an escape from our own circumstances into other days and other=
 minds, and it would=20

cultivate the sympathy and the imagination once thought to be the fruit of =
literary study. But to=20

discuss always and exclusively only what is under our own noses, to study a=
 life of Mr. Roosevelt=20

not because it is a great biography but because it is about Mr. Roosevelt, =
and to study novels not=20

because they are good novels, but because they are about us, is to find our=
selves in the end just=20

where we were in the beginning, with our prejudices more Maximilian had bee=
n in some sort the=20

choice of her father, and this alone would have some weight with her. Besid=
es, he was young;=20

report said he was handsome: "The hairs of his august head are, after the G=
erman fashion,=20

golden, lustrous, curiously adorned, and of becoming length. His port is lo=
rdly." And report spoke=20

no ill of this fair young golden-haired Teuton; he might be some three year=
s younger than=20

Mademoiselle de Bourgogne, but he was already a man and a bold hunter, thou=
gh as yet he had=20

had no opportunity of showing whether he were capable of leading armies, a =
very necessary=20

accomplishment in one who would undertake the care of Mademoiselle and her =
much coveted=20

heritage. He was poor: but was not she rich enough to make up=20


_
joy or sorrow in the world not our own. As for the ability to understand gr=
eat writing when it comes=20

to us, we have learned only this, that since Mr. Roosevelt lived nearer our=
 day than Dr. Johnson,=20

the biography of him is a better biography and a more interesting one than =
Boswell could write,=20

and we need not read Boswell; and since Main Street is nearer to us than th=
