ttle, or not at all, for the coloured surface of life; his chief concern is=

d the secret springs of action. He is aristocratic in his politics, monarch=
ical, an advocate for the centralisation of power; but he would have the mo=
narch enlightened, constitutional, and _
vowels as in Italian. Diacritical marks have been avoided, with the excepti=
on of the macron. This=20

sign has been used consistently[29] to mark long vowels except _e_ and _o_,=
 which are always=20

long. Three rules suffice for the placing of the accent. A long penult is a=
ccented: Maitreya,=20

Charudatta. If the penult is short, the antepenult is accented provided it =
be long: Sansthanaka. If=20

both penult and antepenult of a four-syllabled word are short, the pre-ante=
penultimate receives the=20

accent: Madanika, Sthavaraka.   III. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT  ACT I., entitl=
ed _The Gems are=20

left Behind_. Evening of the first day.--After the prologue, Charudatta, wh=
o is within his house,=20

converses with his friend Maitreya, and deplores his poverty. While they ar=
e speaking,=20

Vasantasena appears in the street outside. She is pursued by the courtier a=
nd Sansthanaka; the=20

latter makes her degrading offers of his love, which she indignantly reject=
s. Charudatta sends=20

Maitreya from the house to offer sacrifice, and through the open door Vasan=
tasena slips=20

unobserved into the house. Maitreya returns after an altercation with Sanst=
hanaka, and=20

recognizes Vasantasena. Vasantasena leaves a casket of gems in the house fo=
r safe keeping and=20

returns to her home.  ACT II., entitled _The Shampooer who Gambled_. Second=
 day.--The act=20

opens in Vasantasena's house. Vasantasena confesses to her maid Madanika he=
r love for=20

Charudatta. Then a shampooer appears in the street, pursued by the gambling=
-master and a=20

gambler, who demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gamblin=
g-house. At this=20

point Darduraka received a scanty education; but if he knew no Latin, his a=
cquaintance with=20

modern languages served him well. At first in the service of Charles the Bo=
ld, in 1472 he passed=20

over to the cause of Louis XI. His treason to the Duke may be almost descri=
bed as inevitable; for=20

Commines could not attach himself to violence and folly, and was naturally =
drawn to the counsels=20

of civil prudence. The bargain was as profitable to his new master as to th=
e servant. On the King's=20

death came a reverse of fortune for Commines: for eight months he was cramp=
ed in the iron cage;=20

during two years he remained a prisoner in the Conciergerie (1487-89), with=
 enforced leisure to=20

think of the preparation of his _Memoires_.[3] Again the sunshine of royal =
favour returned; he=20

followed Charles VIII. to Italy, and was engaged in diplomatic service at V=
enice. In 1511 he died.=20

[Footnote 3: Books I.-VI., written 1488-94; Books VII., VIII., written 1494=
-95.]  The _Memoires_ of=20

Commines were composed as a body of material for a projected history of Lou=
is XI. by Archbishop=20

Angelo Cato; the writer, apparently in all sincerity, hoped that his unlear=
ned French might thus be=20

translated into Latin, the language of scholars; happily we possess the Mem=
oirs as they left their=20

author's mind. And, though Commines rather hides than thrusts to view his o=
wn personality, every=20

page betrays the presence of a remarkable intellect. He was no artist eithe=
r in imaginative design=20

or literary execution; he was before all else a thinker, a student of polit=
ical phenomena, a searcher=20

after the causes of events, an analyst of=20
