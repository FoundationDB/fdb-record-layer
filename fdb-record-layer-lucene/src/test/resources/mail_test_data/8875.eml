philodendron monstera body, or of the individual Ego that reincarnates from one birth to another, and that therefore the latter disappears of logical necessity; to this it is answered: it is so for all exoteric purposes and as a general law. But the case with which we are dealing is an exceptional philodendron monstera body, or of the individual Ego that reincarnates from one birth to another, and that therefore the latter disappears of logical necessity; to this it is answered: it is so for all exoteric purposes and as a general law. But the case with which we are dealing is an exceptional _
communicated only from Guru to initiated pupil.  Having said so much, the statement still will and 

must appear incomprehensible, if not absurd, to many. Firstly, to all those who are unfamiliar with 

the doctrine of the manifold nature and various aspects of the human Monad; and secondly to 

those who view the septenary division of the human entity from a too materialistic standpoint. Yet 

the intuitional Occultist, who has studied thoroughly the mysteries of Nirvana--who knows it to be 

identical with Parabrahman, and hence unchangeable, eternal and no Thing but the Absolute All--

will seize the possibility of the fact. They know that while a Dharmakaya--a Nirvani "without 

remains," as our Orientalists have translated it, being absorbed into that Nothingness, which is the 

one real, because Absolute, Consciousness--cannot be said to return to incarnation on Earth, the 

Nirvani being no longer a he, a she, or even an it, the Nirmanakaya--or he who has obtained 

Nirvana "with remains," _i.e._, who is clothed in a subtle body, which makes him impervious to all 

outward impressions and to every mental feeling, and in whom the notion of his Ego has not 

entirely ceased--can do so. Again, every Eastern Occultist is aware of the fact that there are two 

kinds of Nirmanakayas--the natural, and the assumed; that the former is the name or epithet given 

to the condition of a high ascetic, or Initiate, who has reached a stage of bliss second the shade of 

the lime-trees.  There were benches here and there; the four gentlemen stopped near them; at a 

sign from Athos, Porthos and D'Artagnan sat down, the two others stood in front of them.  After a 

few minutes of silent embarrassment, Athos spoke.  "Gentlemen," he said, "our presence here is 

the best proof of former friendship; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous; not one 

has, therefore, to reproach himself."  "Hear me, count," replied D'Artagnan; "instead of making 

compliments to each other, let us explain our conduct to each other, like men of right and honest 

hearts."  "I wish for nothing more; have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur 

d'Herblay? If so, speak out," answered Athos.  "I have," replied D'Artagnan. "When I saw you at 

your chateau at Bragelonne, I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood; 

instead of answering me as a friend, you played with me as a child; the friendship, therefore, that 

you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords, but by your dissimulation at your 

castle."  "D'Artagnan!" said Athos, reproachfully.  "You asked for candor and you have it. You ask 

what I have against you; I tell you. And I have the same sincerity to show you, if you wish, 

Monsieur d'Herblay; I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me."  "Really, monsieur, 

you say strange things," said Aramis. "You came seeking me to make to me certain

the self-sacrifice of one who voluntarily gives up the absolute Nirvana, in order to help humanity 

and be still doing it good, or, in other words, to save his fellow-creatures by guiding them. It may 

be objected that the Dharmakaya, being a Nirvani or Jivanmukta, can have no "remains" left 

behind him after death, for having attained that state from which no further incarnations are 

possible, you sounded me, nothing more. Very well what did I say to you? that Mazarin was 

contemptible and that I wouldn't serve Mazarin. But that is all. Did I tell you that I wouldn't serve 

any other? On the contrary, I gave you to understand, I think, that I adhered to the princes. We 

even joked very pleasantly, if I remember rightly, on the very probable contingency of your being 

charged by the
