" I reminded him.  "Then what is the new one?" he asked, with an unexpected=
ly solemn look on his face.  "My husband has just asked me to join him in C=

 face a mask.  "I think I am," I told him. For I could see, now, how Peter'=
s return had simplified the situation by complicating it. Already he had ma=

t of Napoleon crumbled to pieces in four. But unscrupulous ambition was the=
 root of his character. It was necessary in fact to enable him to trample d=

 with any principle seems to me impossible. He came forward, it is true, dr=

of their generously deforested pelt. He took the pipe out of his mouth as h=
e stepped over to me,=20

and pulled off his heavy old gauntlet before he shook hands.  "Peter!" I re=
peated in my ridiculous=20

small whisper.  He didn't speak. But he smiled, a bit wistfully, as he star=
ed down at me. And for=20

just a moment, I think, an odd look of longing came into his searching hone=
st eyes which studied=20

my face as though he were counting every freckle and line and eyelash there=
. He continued to X-

ray me with that hungry stare of his until I took my hand away and could fe=
el the blood surging=20

back to my face.  "It's a long time," he said as he puffed hard on his pipe=
, apparently to keep it=20

from going out. The sound of his voice sent a little thrill through my body=
. I felt as rattle-headed as=20

a rabbit, and was glad when Dinkie and Poppsy captured him by altogether is=
 Roman. But there=20

was a municipal government in the Saxon capital, and evidently there must b=
e wherever large=20

cities exist with any degree of independence. The Roman law was, at all eve=
nts so far lost in the=20

early part of the Middle Ages when Christendom was in process of formation =
that the study of it=20

afterwards seemed new. Roman literature influenced that of mediaeval Christ=
endom down to=20

about the end of the twelfth century. Our writers of the time of Henry II. =
compose in half classical=20

Latin and affect classical elegancies of style. But then comes a philosophy=
 which in spite of its=20

worship of Aristotle is essentially an original creation of the mediaeval a=
nd Catholic mind couched=20

in a language Latin indeed but almost as remote from classical Latin as Ger=
man itself: the tongue=20

in truth of a new intellectual world. Open=20


_
catamounts.  "Where did you come from?" I finally asked, trying in vain to =
be as collected as Peter=20

himself.  Then he told me. He told me as nonchalantly as though he were giv=
ing me a piece of=20

news of no particular interest. He had rather a difficult book to finish up=
, and he concluded the=20

quietness of Alabama Ranch would suit him to a T. And when spring came he w=
anted to have a=20

look about for a nest of the whooping crane. It has been rather a rarity, f=
or some sixteen or=20

seventeen years, this whooping crane, and the Rome. The eye of the antiquar=
y sees the Basilica=20

in the Cathedral, but what essential resemblance does the Roman place of ju=
dicature and=20

business bear to that marvellous and fantastic poetry of religion writing i=
ts hymns in stone? In the=20

same manner the Roman _castra_ are traceable in the form as well as the des=
ignation of the=20

mediaeval _castella_. But what resemblance did the feudal militia bear to t=
he legionaries? And=20

what became of the Roman art of war till it was revived by Gustavus Adolphu=
s? The outward=20

 and tried the slide a=20

couple of times, and announced that our coaster was better than the chariot=
 of Icarius. And by this=20

time I had recovered my wits and my composure and got some of the snow off =
my Mackinaw.=20

"Have I changed?" I asked Peter as he turned to study my face for the secon=
d time.  "To me," he=20

said as he brushed the snow from his gauntlets, "you are always adorable!" =
 "_Verboten!_" I=20

retorted to that, wondering why anything so foolish could have the power to=
 make my pulses sing.=20

"Why?" he asked, as his eyes met mine.  "For the same old reason," I told h=
im.  "Reasons," he=20

said, "are like shoes: Time was and that it was so gives it great dignity a=

Romanized perhaps of the populations beneath the sway of Rome.  The founder=
 of the Roman=20

empire was a very great man. With such genius and such fortune it is not su=
rprising that he should=20

be made an idol. In intellectual stature he was at least an inch higher tha=
n his fellows which is in=20

itself enough to confound all our notions of right and wrong. He had the ad=
vantage of being a=20

statesman before he was a soldier whereas Napoleon was a soldier before he =
was a statesman.=20
