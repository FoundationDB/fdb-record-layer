the town, killed the men, abandoned the State to desolation, and carried off their wives into 

slavery, without permitting them, however, to lay aside the long robes and other marks of their 

rank as married women, so that they might be obliged not only to march in the triumph but to 

appear forever after as a type of slavery, burdened with the weight of their shame and so making 

atonement for their State. Hence, the architects of the time designed for public buildings statues of 

these women, placed so as to carry a load, in order that the sin and the punishment of the people 

of Caryae might be known and handed down even to posterity.  [Illustration: Photo. H. B. Warren

Pausanias, son of Agesipolis, after conquering the Persian armies, infinite in number, with a small 

force at the battle of Plataea, celebrated a glorious triumph with the spoils and booty, and with the 

money obtained from the sale thereof built the Persian Porch, to be a monument to the renown 

and valour of the people and a trophy of victory for posterity. And there they set effigies of the 

prisoners arrayed in barbarian costume and holding up the roof, their pride punished by this 

deserved affront, that enemies might tremble for fear of the effects of their courage, and that their 

own people, looking upon this ensample of their valour and encouraged by the glory of it, might be 

ready to defend their independence. So from that time on, many have put up statues of Persians 

supporting entablatures and their ornaments, and thus from that motive have greatly enriched the 

diversity of  "You're sure it was Sparks, are you?" inquired Bob.  "Quite sure.  It is true I only saw 

his confederate, but one of the men who had often seen Sparks in company with Crashington, his 

brother-in-law, knew him at once and saw him run off, with the boys after him.  He's a bad lot, but I 

hope he'll escape for poor Mrs Crashington's sake."  "And _I_ hope he won't escape, for poor 

Martha Reading's sake!" said Mary with much decision of tone.  "That's his sweet-'eart--a friend of 

Molly's!" said Joe to Bob in explanation.  At this point in the conversation, Master Fred 

Crashington, in his frantic efforts to reach an elevated part of the cupboard, fell backwards, 

drawing a shelf and all its contents on the top of himself and May.  Neither of them was hurt, 

though both were much frightened.  "I think _that_ must have put the fire out at last," said Joe, with 

a laugh, as he took the panting rosebud on his knee and smoothed her soft little head.  "We'll sit 

quiet now and have a chat."  A knock at the outer door here called Mrs Dashwood from the room. 

"Fire!" exclaimed May, holding up her finger and listening with eager expectation.  "No, little 

woman," said Joe, "they would ring loud if it was fire."  Meanwhile Mrs Dashwood opened the door 

and found herself confronted by a boy, with his hands in his pockets and his cap thrown in a 

reckless way half on the side and half on the back of his head.  "Oh, I suppose you are the boy 

Herring, sent here by Miss Reading," said Mrs Dashwood.  "Well, as to that, ma'am, you must be 

guided by taste.  I've 'eard of men of my years an' standin' bein' styled 'obble-de-'oys.  My name, 

likewise, is open to question.  Some of my friends calls me 'Erring-- others of 'em, Raw 'Erring--

others, again, the Bloater.  But I'm in no wise partikler, I _did_ come from Miss Reading to 'ave an 

interview with Mrs Dashwood--whom--I presoom--"  Here the Bloater laid 


_
stories of the same kind which architects ought to know.  7. As for philosophy, it makes an 

architect high-minded and not self-assuming, but rather renders him courteous, just, and honest 

without avariciousness. This is very important, for no work can be rightly done without honesty and 

Mrs Dashwood laughed, and said, "come in, boy."  "I have a pal, ma'am--a chum--a--in fact a 

_friend_--may I--"  Without finishing his sentence or waiting for a reply, the Bloater gave a sharp 

whistle, and Little Jim stood by his side as if by magical influence, looking the embodiment of

grasping nor have his mind preoccupied with the idea of receiving perquisites, but let him with 

dignity keep up his position by cherishing a good reputation. These are among the precepts of 

philosophy. Furthermore philosophy treats of physics (in Greek [Greek: physiologia]) where a 

more careful knowledge is required because the problems which come under this head are 

numerous and of very different kinds; as, for example, in the case of the conducting of water. For 

at points of intake and at curves, and at places  "Come in, both of you, and make haste," said 

Mary, ushering them into a small empty room.  "Now, boy--"  "Bloater, ma'am, if you 'ave no 

objection."  "Well, Bloater, our communication with each other must be brief and to the point, 

because--"  "Yes, ma'am--sharp and short," interrupted the Bloater--"reasons not required." 

Smiling in spite of herself, Mrs Dashwood said--  "You know Mr Sparks, and can--can--in short, 

give him into the hands of justice."  "If I knowed w'ere justice was," said the Bloater,

air naturally form in one way or another; and nobody who has not learned the fundamental 

principles of physics from philosophy will be able to provide against the damage which they do. So 

the reader of Ctesibius or Archimedes and the other writers of treatises of the same class will not 

be able to might give Mr Sparks into 'is 'ands, but I don't.  It's my opinion that _justice_ ain't 

finished yet.  They've made 'is 'ands no doubt--and pretty strong ones they are too--but they 

'aven't give 'im brains yet. 'Ows'ever, to make a long story short, 'as 'Amlet said to 'is father's 

ghost, w'ich was

by the philosophers.  8. Music, also, the architect ought to understand so that he may have 

knowledge of the canonical and mathematical theory, and besides be able to tune ballistae, 

catapultae, and scorpiones to the proper key. For to the right and left in the beams are the holes in 

the frames through which the strings of twisted sinew are stretched by means of _can_ give 'im 

into the 'ands of the p'lice--wot then?"  "_Do it_!" said Mrs Dashwood, with sudden intensity of 

feeling and manner, "Do it, boy--" ("Bloater," murmured the lad), "do it, Bloater. Oh! you have no 

idea what a blessing it would be to--to--to--a poor, dear girl who is mad--infatuated and, and--then, 

he is _such_ a scoundrel; such a fire-raiser, deceiver,
