engrossed in any way, the sense perception of any injury is not felt at the time, but later the 

suffering enters into consciousness. So, returning to our example of the seven notes struck 

simultaneously, we have one impression, but the ear is affected in succession by the notes one 

after another, so that they are stored in the brain-mind in order, for the untrained consciousness 

cannot register them simultaneously. All depends on training and on attention. Thus the 

transference of a sensation passing from any organ to the consciousness is almost simultaneous if 

your attention is fixed on it, but if any noise distracts your attention, then it will take a fraction more 

of a second before it reaches your consciousness. The Occultist should train himself to receive 

and transmit along the line of the seven scales of his consciousness every impression, or 

impressions, simultaneously. He who reduces the intervals of physical time the most has made the 

most progress.    Consciousness, Its Seven Scales.   There are seven scales or shades of 

consciousness, of the Unit; _e.g._, in a moment of pleasure or pain; four lower and three higher. 

1. Physical sense-perception: Perception of the cell (if paralyzed, the sense is there, though _you_ 

do not feel it).  2. Self-perception or apperception: _I.e._, self-perception of cell.  3. Psychic 

apperception: Of astral double, doeppelganger, carrying it higher to the:  4. Vital perception: 

Physical feeling, sensations of pleasure and pain, of quality.  These are the four lower scales, and 

belong to the psycho-physiological man.  5. Manasic discernment of the Manasic self-perception. 

Lower Manas:  6. Will perception: Volitional perception, the voluntary taking in of an idea; you can 

regard or disregard physical pain.  7. Spiritual, entirely conscious apperception:   Because it 

reaches the Higher, self-conscious Manas.  [Apperception means self-perception, conscious 

action, not as with Leibnitz, but when attention is fixed on the perception.]  You can take these on 

any planes: _e.g._, bad news as usual, raised his sword, and instead of pronouncing the 

customary formula, "I make you a knight. Be brave, faithful and loyal," he said, "You are brave, 

faithful and loyal. I knight you, monsieur le comte."  Then turning to Aramis, he said:  "It is now 

your turn, monsieur le chevalier."  The same ceremony recommenced, with the same words, 

whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass, that he might disguise himself like the king. Charles, 

having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos, embraced them both.  "Sire," said Winter, who in this 

trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up, "we are ready."  The king looked at the 

three gentlemen. "Then we must fly!" said he.  "Flying through an army, sire," said Athos, "in all 

countries in the world is called charging."  "Then I shall die, sword in hand," said Charles. 

"Monsieur le comte, monsieur le chevalier, if ever I am king----"  "Sire, you have already done us 

more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to, therefore gratitude is on our side. But we 

must not lose time. We have already wasted too much."  The king again shook hands with all 

three, exchanged hats with Winter and went out.  Winter's regiment was ranged on some high 

ground above the camp. The king, followed by the three friends, turned his steps that way. The 

Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened; the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up 

their station in battle array.  "Do you see that?" said the king. "Perhaps they are penitent and 

preparing to march."  "If they are penitent," said Athos, "let them follow us."  "Well!" said the king, 

"what shall we do?"  "Let us examine the enemy's army."  At the same instant the eyes of the little 

group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the 

morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle. The air was soft and clear, as it 

generally is at that early hour of the morning. The regiments, the standards, and even the colors of 



the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct.  On the summit

lower stages before coming to the heart.  Or take Sound:       1. It strikes the ear.      2. Self-

perception of the ear.      3. On the psychic or mental, which carries it to      4. Vital (harsh, soft; 

strong, weak; etc.).    The Ego.   One of the best proofs that there is an Ego, a true Field of 

Consciousness, is the fact already mentioned, that a state of consciousness is never exactly 

reproduced, though you should live a hundred years, and pass through milliards and milliards. In 

an active day, how many states and substates there are; it would be impossible to have cells 

enough for all. This will help you to understand why some mental states and abstract things follow 

the Ego into Devachan, and why others merely scatter in space. That which touches the Entity has 

an affinity for it, as a noble action, is immortal and goes with it into Devachan, forming part and 

parcel of the biography of the personality which is disintegrating. A lofty emotion runs through the 

seven stages, and touches the Ego, the mind that plays its tunes in the mind-cells. We can 

analyze the work of consciousness and describe it; but we cannot define consciousness unless we 

postulate a Subject.    Bhurloka.   The Bhurloka begins with the Lower Manas. Animals do not feel

turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood.  "Does this man know your 

majesty personally?" inquired Aramis.  Charles smiled.  "That man is Cromwell," said he.  "Then 

draw down your hat, sire, that he may not discover the substitution."  "Ah!" said Athos, "how much 

time we have lost."  "Now," said the king, "give the word and let us start."  "Will you not give it, 

sire?" asked Athos.  "No; I make you my lieutenant-general," said the king.  "Listen, then, Lord 

Winter. Proceed, sire, I beg. What we are going to say does not concern your majesty."  The king, 

smiling, turned a few steps back.  "This is what I propose to do," said Athos. "We will divide our 

regiments into two squadrons. You will put yourself at the head of the first. We and his majesty will 

lead the second. If no obstacle occurs we will both charge together, force the enemy's line and 

throw ourselves into the Tyne, which we must cross, either by fording or swimming; if, on the 

contrary, any repulse should take place, you and your men must fight to the last man, whilst we 

and the king proceed on our road. Once arrived at the brink of the river, should we even find them

perception is located in the aura of the pineal gland. This aura rest."  "To horse!" said Lord Winter. 

"To horse!" re-echoed Athos; "everything is arranged and decided."  "Now, gentlemen," cried the 

king, "forward! and rally to the old cry of France, 'Montjoy and St. Denis!' The war cry of England is
