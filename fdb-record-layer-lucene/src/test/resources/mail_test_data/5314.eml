wind. Have you noticed which way the _
might have induced Mohammad to waive certain minor points if they recognise=
d his prophetic=20

mission,--it is difficult to say. It seems most probable that Mohammad woul=
d not have yielded a jot=20

to their demands, and would have accepted nothing short of unconditional su=
rrender to his=20

religion. And it is at least doubtful whether Islam would have gained anyth=
ing by a further infusion=20

of Judaism. It already contained all that it could assimilate of the Hebrew=
 faith; the rest was too=20

narrow for the universal scope of Islam. The religion of Mohammad lost litt=
le, we may be sure, by=20

the standing aloof of the Arabian Jews; but the Jews themselves lost much. =
Mohammad, indeed,=20

treated them kindly so long as kindness was possible. He made a treaty with=
 them, whereby the=20

rights of the Muslims and the Jews were defined. They were to practise thei=
r several religions=20

unmolested; protection and security were promised to all the parties to the=
 treaty, irrespective of=20

creed; each was to help the other if attacked; no alliance was to be made w=
ith the Kureysh; war=20

was to be made in common, and no war could be made in the lead again at the=
 first opportunity.=20

Neither took these short spurts seriously, for they indicated nothing. Not =
until they had covered the=20

second mile did they begin to let out in real earnestness. Black Buck then,=
 to see whether White=20

Tail was beginning to show any strain, rushed ahead, and spread himself out=
 in a long, steady=20

lope.  White Tail kept close behind him until his speed began to slacken, a=
nd then to show that he=20

was still fresh and strong he dashed ahead and took the lead. Then followed=
 another mile of hard=20

running. Both bucks were beginning to perspire freely now, and the white la=
ther showed on their=20

flanks.  But neither one was winded or anywhere near the end of their stren=
gth. White Tail felt that=20

he could keep up the gait nearly all day. He felt singularly fresh and stro=
ng. They had made half=20

the circuit before either could try to outdistance the other.  The rest of =
the race would decide which=20

was the champion. Either they had to run abreast of each other until the en=
d, or one had to take=20

the lead. Suddenly, to White Tail=E2=80=99s surprise, Young Black Buck slow=
ed down, and=20


_
crime alone could do away with the protection of this treaty.  But the Jews=
 would not content=20

themselves with standing aloof; they must needs act on the offensive. They =
began by asking=20

Mohammad hard questions out of their law, and his answers they easily refut=
ed from their books.=20

They denied all knowledge of the Jewish stories in the Kur-an--though they =
knew that they came=20

from their own Haggadah, which was ever in their mouths in their own quarte=
r,--and they showed=20

him their Bible, where,  =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re on even terms up to this po=
int, White Tail. Suppose we rest awhile,=20

and then go on. The woods are so beautiful here, and I want to see what kin=
d of a place Puma=20

lives in. He=E2=80=99s around here somewhere, I suppose.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CYes, I came here one day with Father Buck,=20

and he showed me where Puma was. I smelt him and heard him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CHow exciting!=E2=80=9D exclaimed=20

Young Black Buck. =E2=80=9CI wonder if we=E2=80=99ll hear and smell him tod=
ay. I want to know what he looks like.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not so interested in that,=E2=80=9D laughed=20
