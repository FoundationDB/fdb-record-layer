it is monopolized by government, the defences are used against the Spanish =
revenue officers and=20

troops, who on this account never fail to destroy their establishments when=
 they can do so, though=20

many are impregnable to any force they can bring against them, from the nat=
ure of the passes,=20

and from the activity of the negroes, who use their bows with wonderful exp=
ertness. There are=20

indeed instances of their repulsing bodies of one or two hundred native tro=
ops, but affairs of this=20

magnitude are very rare.  To this predatory kind of warfare, as well as to =
the defective qualities,=20

and often very reprehensible conduct of the missionaries, generally Indian =
priests (Clerigos), are=20

perhaps to be in some measure attributed their unsettled habits. Those near=
est the Spanish=20

settlements carry on a little commerce, receiving wrought iron, cloth, and =
tobacco, but oftener=20

dollars, in exchange for gold-dust, &c., or for wax, honey, and other produ=
cts of their mountains.=20

The circumstance of their receiving dollars, which they rarely use in their=
 purchases, is a curious=20

one; but it is a fact, and very large quantities of money are supposed to b=
e thus buried; from what=20

motive, except a superstitious one, cannot be imagined. [43]  Of their mann=
ers or customs little or=20

nothing is known. Like all savage nations, they are abundantly tinctured wi=
th superstitions, fickle,=20

and hasty. One of their customs best known is, that upon the death of a chi=
ef, they plant=20

themselves in ambush on some frequented track, and with their arrows assass=
inate the first=20

unfortunate traveller who passes, and not unfrequently two or three; the bo=
dies are carried off as=20

sacrifices to the manes of the deceased. [44] The communications between th=
e Spanish=20

settlements are often interrupted by this circumstance, as no Indian will v=
enture out when the=20

negroes are known to be "de luto" (in mourning): they are also said to have=
 a "throwing of spears,"=20

similar to those of New Holland, at the death of any eminent person. In fac=
t, upon this, as upon all=20

other points unconnected with masses and sermons, there exists a degree of =
ignorance which is=20

almost incredible. The early missionaries, in their rage for nominal conver=
sion, appear to have=20

neglected entirely the history or origin of their neophytes; and, as in Ame=
rica, where the=20

monuments of ages were crumbled to the dust to plant the cross, all that re=
lated to the history of=20

their converts was considered as unprofitable, if not as impious, the devil=
 [45] being=20

compendiously supposed to preside over their political as well as religious=
 institutions in all cases.=20

In this belief, and in its consequent effects, the modern missionaries, who=
 are mostly Indian=20

priests, are worthy successors of their Spanish predecessors.  The governme=
nt have many=20

missions established for the purpose of converting them, but with little su=
ccess. Like most=20

savages, their mode of life has to them charms superior to civilization, or=
 rather to Christianity (for=20

here the terms are not synonimous); and they rarely remain, should they eve=
n consent to be=20

baptized, but on the first caprice, or exaction of tribute, which immediate=
ly takes place, and=20

sometimes even precedes this ceremony, return again to their mountains.  Ex=
posed to all=20

inclemencies of the weather, and with an unwholesome and precarious diet, t=
hey perhaps rarely=20

attain more than forty years of age. Their numbers are supposed rather to d=
iminish than increase;=20

and in a few years this race of men, with their language, will probably be =
extinct. It is indeed a=20

curious subject of enquiry, whether the language of those of the eastern is=
lands has any, and what=20

resemblance to those of Africa, or the southern parts of New Holland and Va=
n Dieman's Land?=20

[46]  They are not represented as very mischievous; but if strangers ventur=
e too far into their=20

woods, they consider it an aggression, and repel it accordingly with their =
arrows. Those who=20

frequent the Spanish settlements are rather of a mild character; and there =
are instances of=20



Spanish vessels being wrecked on the coast, whose people, particularly the =
Europeans, have=20

been treated by them in the kindest manner, and carefully conducted to the =
nearest settlement.=20

The character of the different tribes appears, however, to vary in this par=
ticular: some are=20

described as treacherous and cruel, and those which inhabit the north weste=
rn coasts of the Bay=20

of Manila are accused of having frequently attacked the boats of ships, whe=
n these were not=20

sufficiently guarded in their intercourse with them. The natives of the tow=
n in the Bay of Mariveles,=20

at the entrance of that of Manila, assured the writer of these pages, that =
it would be madness to=20

attempt accompanying them into the woods, even in disguise; and in this the=
y persisted, though=20

money was offered them to allow him to proceed with them.  The Indians are =
the descendants of=20

the various Malay tribes which appear to have emigrated to this country at =
different times, and=20

from different parts of Borneo and Celebes. Their languages, though all der=
ived from one stock=20

(the Malay), has a number of dialects differing very materially; so much so=
, that those from=20

different provinces frequently do not understand each other.  They differ t=
oo in their character, and=20

slightly in their manners and customs. The most numerous class of them are =
the Bisayas, [47] (a=20

Spanish name, from their anciently painting their bodies, and using defensi=
ve armour). These=20

inhabit the largest part of the southern islands. Luzon contains several tr=
ibes, of which the most=20

remarkable are the Ylocos, Cagayanes, Zambales, Pangasinanes, Pampangos, an=
d Tagalos.=20

These still retain their national distinctions and characters to such a deg=
ree, that they often=20

occasion quarrels amongst each other. Of their general character as a natio=
n we are now to=20

speak.  The Indian of the Phillippine Islands has been strangely misreprese=
nted. He is not the=20

being that oppression, bigotry, and indolence, have for 300 years endeavour=
ed to make him, or he=20

is so only when he has no other resource. Necessity, and the force of examp=
le have made those=20

of Manila, what the whole are generally characterized as--traitors, idlers,=
 and thieves.  How, under=20

such a system as will be afterwards described, should they be otherwise? Sa=
y rather, that all=20

considered, it is surprising to find them what they are; for they are in ge=
neral (I speak of the Indian=20

of the provinces), mild, industrious, as far as they dare to be so, hospita=
ble, kind, and ingenuous.=20

The Pampango is brave, [48] faithful, and active; the fidelity of the Cagay=
an is proverbial; the=20

Yloco and the Pangasinanon are most industrious; the Bisayan is brave and e=
nterprising almost to=20

fool-hardiness:--they are all a spirited, a proudly-spirited race of men; a=
nd such materials, in other=20

hands, would form the foundation of all that is great and excellent in huma=
n nature.  But for 300=20

years they have been ground to the earth with oppression. They have been cr=
ushed by tyranny;=20

their spirit has been tortured by abuse and contempt, and brutalized by ign=
orance; in a word, there=20

is no injustice that has not been inflicted on them, short of depriving the=
m of their liberty; and in a=20

work published at Madrid in 1819 (Estado de las Yslas Filipinas, par [sic; =
for por] Don Tomas=20

Comyn), whose author was a factor of the Phillippine company, a whole chapt=
er (the 4th) is=20

devoted to the mild and humane project "of establishing Spanish agriculturi=
sts throughout the=20

islands," who are, "to require a certain number of Indians from the governo=
rs of towns and=20

provinces, who are to be driven to the plantations, where they are to be ob=
liged to work a certain=20

time, the price of their labour being fixed, and then to be relieved by a f=
resh drove!" [49]  Such a=20

system, incredible as it may appear, has been proposed to a Spanish cortes;=
 and still more=20

wonderful, plans like these excited no reprobation in Manila. Such were Spa=
nish ideas of=20

governing Indians! Justice would almost tempt us to wish that this scheme h=
ad been carried into=20



execution, and that the Indian had risen and dashed his chains on the heads=
 of the authors of=20

such an infernal project. And yet the Indian is marked out as little better=
 than a brute; so many of=20

them are, but to the system of government, and not to the Indian, is the fa=
ult to be ascribed.  It is=20

not here meant to accuse the Spanish laws; many of them are excellent, and =
would appear to=20

have been dictated by the very spirit of philanthropy. But these active vol=
cano has. It is rather=20

ludicrous to suppose that polyps, among the lowest of created beings, leadi=
ng an ephemeral=20

existence, should yet have such unanimity of purpose, such perfect mutual u=
nderstanding, as to=20

undertake to build their reefs in a more or less circular form; it is prepo=
sterous to suppose the=20

unvarying form of the structure is the result of mere chance. Clearly we mu=
st find some other=20

influences; and the most reasonable is to suppose the foundations of these =
islands were laid by=20

the same agency that raised all other Oceanic islands from the bed of the s=
ea.  The volcano thus=20

plays an important part in the earth=E2=80=99s economy. Not only does it ad=
d to land areas by upheaval=20

from the deep. The amount of material thrown out by the Javanese volcanoes =
alone during the=20

past hundred years is greater far than all the silt borne to the sea by Ame=
rican rivers during the=20

same period. Krakatoa, in its recent eruption, threw out more than the Miss=
issippi bears to the sea=20

in sixty years.  There is some doubt as to how much volcanoes effect by dir=
ect upheaval. The=20

formation of many observed cones shows that the majority are mainly built u=
p by the materials=20

thrown out, and not by any great elevation of the adjacent surface. In the =
case of a volcano=20

already existing, it is of course not easy to know what proportion of its m=
ass is merely=20

accumulation of lava, cinders, or tufa.  As to the form of volcanic cones, =
those of ashes, cinders,=20

and scoria are of course steepest; those of lava thrown out when liquid hav=
ing a very gradual=20

slope. The difference may be readily illustrated by comparing a heap of san=
d and pebbles with a=20

heap of stiffening molasses candy. One is steeply conical; the other, round=
ed or dome-like. But=20

either form of volcano may abound in crevices and apertures from which issu=
e sulphurous vapors=20

and gases. These fumaroles, as they are called, are usually surrounded with=
 mineral deposits,=20

often resembling the most delicate filigree work.  Having considered the ge=
neral phases and=20

principles of volcanic action, we may now notice some of the more famous er=
uptions of the past.=20

CHAPTER XXI.  GREAT ERUPTIONS OF VESUVIUS.      =E2=80=9CE=E2=80=99en while=

While prince and pauper, =E2=80=99mid the scorching gloom,      Groped thro=
ugh the gaping streets; the=20

ocean hissed,      And palaces and marble temples reeled,      And crushed =
or prisoned; still the=20

ashes fell,      Till mansions, statues, homes and colonnades,      And Str=
ength, and Beauty, Love,=20

and Life, and Death,      Lay heaps on heaps, in one black ruin blent.=E2=
=80=9D   For nearly seventeen=20

hundred years there lay beneath a sea of ashes near the Naples Bay, a city =
whose destruction=20

had not been described by the younger Pliny; and in the lapse of years its =
site had been forgotten.=20

During the construction of an aqueduct in 1592, workmen frequently came upo=
n foundations of=20

buildings. No curiosity seems to have been aroused. Nearly a hundred years =
later other buildings=20

were discovered, with the inscription =E2=80=9CPOMPEII.=E2=80=9D Still ther=
e was no practical interest. Then the=20

attention of the learned was drawn to the discoveries at Herculaneum; and A=
lcubierre, a Spanish=20

colonel of engineers, in examining the subterranean canal, was led by the d=
iscovery of a house=20



and statues to conjecture that some great treasures might lie buried there.=
 Obtaining permission of=20

the King of Naples, he began excavations in the year 1748. In a few days he=
 unearthed =E2=80=9Ca picture=20

eleven palms long by four and one-half high, containing festoons of eggs, f=
ruits and flowers, the=20

head of a man, large and in good style, a helmet, an owl, various small bir=
ds and other objects.=E2=80=9D=20

Then was found the skeleton of a man, covered with the lava mud. By his sid=
e were eighteen=20

brass coins and one of silver. Then was found an amphitheatre, with a seati=
ng capacity of ten=20

thousand. But the work was poorly conducted: valuable pictures were detache=
d from the walls,=20

and the buildings again covered with rubbish. No strangers were allowed to =
copy anything.  When=20

the French occupied Naples, the work was for a time better conducted; then =
it again declined.=20

When Victor Emmanuel became King of Italy, a distinguished antiquarian scho=
lar, Guiseppe=20

Fiorelli, was appointed director-general of the works. Since then, the work=
 has been well done,=20

Signor Fiorelli noting =E2=80=9Cevery appearance or fragment which might af=
ford or suggest a restoration of=20

any part of a buried edifice; replacing with fresh timbers every charred be=
am, propping every=20

tottering wall or portion of brick work,=E2=80=9D till the tourist sees to-=
day a town in the integrity of its=20

outlines and order of its arrangement. =E2=80=9CTemples, baths, markets, to=
mbs, stand out just as they=20

stood eighteen hundred years ago. The villa of the port, the forum, the cou=
nting-house, the baker=E2=80=99s=20

shop, the school-room, the kitchen, carry us into the very heart of Roman l=
ife in the brightest days=20

of the empire. The jewelry of beauty, the spade of the laborer, the fetter =
of the prisoner and the=20

weapon of the soldier are all there, reproducing and realizing the past wit=
h a vividness which can=20

scarcely be conceived.=E2=80=9D  Relics and historic records give us an ide=
al of the past. How correct is the=20

ideal may be inferred from the fact that no two antiquarians have the same =
conception of a Druid=20

temple. With all the details of Scripture and Josephus, we have not an exac=
t model of the temple.=20

Inhabited ruins change with their possessors: those uninhabited decay in th=
e war of elements. But=20

Pompeii was, so to speak, hermetically sealed, in the height of its prosper=
ity, preserved from=20

Goths and Vandals, and is laid before us to-day as it stood over eighteen c=
enturies ago, allowing=20

us to see how sudden was the storm that burst upon it long years ago. The p=
aintings are=20

=E2=80=9Cundimmed by the leaden touch of time; household furniture left in =
the confusion of use; articles,=20

even of intrinsic value, abandoned in the hurry of escape, yet safe from th=
e robber, or scattered=20

about from the trembling hand which could not pause or stoop for its most v=
aluable possessions;=20

and in some instances the bones of the inhabitants, bearing sad testimony t=
o the suddenness and=20

completeness of the calamity that overwhelmed them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTher=
e are the very ruts which were made=20

by the wheels of chariots, flying, perhaps, from the impending ruin; there =
are water-pipes, in the=20

cavities of which, sealed by the hand of time, the splashing fluid can stil=
l be heard; there are rude=20

and grotesque inscriptions, scratched by some loiterer on the stucco, and a=
s fresh as when they=20

excited the mirth of the passer-by; there are egg-shells, bones of fish and=
 chickens, and other=20

fragments of a repast of which skeletons lying near were partaking when the=
 catastrophe=20

overwhelmed them; there is fuel ready to be supplied to furnaces for heatin=
g the baths; there are=20

the stains left upon the counters of drinking shops by wet glasses; there a=
re the vials of the=20

apothecary, still containing the fluids he was wont to dispense; there are =
ovens in which loaves of=20

bread, carbonized, but otherwise perfect, may yet be seen; there are vases =
with olives still=20

swimming in oil, the fruit retaining its flavor, and the oil  [Illustration=
: DESTRUCTION OF=20

POMPEII.]  burning readily when submitted to the flame; there are shelves, =
on which are piled=20



stores of raisins, figs and chestnuts; there are amphorae containing the ra=
re wine for which=20

Campania was so famous.=E2=80=9D  Here you saw a new altar of white marble,=
 wondrously beautiful, just=20

from the hands of the sculptor; =E2=80=9Can enclosure was building all roun=
d; the mortar just dashed=20

against the side of the wall was but half spread out; you saw the long, sli=
ding stroke of the trowel=20

about to return and obliterate its own track; but it never returned; the ha=
nd of the workman was=20

suddenly arrested, and the whole looks so fresh and new that you would almo=
st swear that the=20

mason had only gone to his dinner, and about to come back immediately to sm=
ooth the=20

roughness.=E2=80=9D  The younger Pliny tells us of his uncle=E2=80=99s deat=
h, and of the suddenness of the=20

calamity. The people were in the amphitheater when the volcano burst forth.=
 The elder Pliny, in=20

command of the fleet=20


_
delay vitiates their effect. That this colony, the most favoured perhaps un=
der heaven by nature,=20

should have remained till the present day almost a forest, is a circumstanc=
e which has generally=20

excited surprise in those who are acquainted with it, and has as generally =
been accounted for by=20

attributing it to the laziness of the Spaniards and Indians. This is but a =
superficial view of the=20

subject; one of those general remarks which being relatively a little flatt=
ering to ourselves, pass=20

current as facts, and then "we wonder how any one can doubt of what is so g=
enerally received."--

The cause lies deeper, man is not naturally indolent. When he has supplied =
his necessities, he=20

seeks for superfluities--if he can enjoy them in security and peace;--if no=
t--if the iron gripe of=20

despotism (no matter in what shape, or through what form it called by his s=
ister to notice a strange=20

cloud that had just appeared. He had just returned from a walk, bathed, and=
 gone to his study.=20

This was August 24, A. D. 79, about 1 P.M. The dense cloud occasionally glo=
wed with light; again,=20

it was of inky blackness. It was the =E2=80=9Cpine tree banner,=E2=80=9D si=
nce become so familiar to the=20

Neapolitans. Pliny at once started for his galleys, determined to have a cl=
oser view of the strange=20

scene. As he went to the shore he received a note from a lady who lived at =
the base of the=20

mountain, urging him to come to her assistance. He set out at once to rende=
r what aid he could;=20

=E2=80=9Cfor the villas stood extremely thick upon that lovely coast.=E2=80=
=9D They neared the mount; cinders,=20

pumice, ashes, and glowing stones fell on and among the vessels. Sternly or=
dering the frightened=20

crew to press on, Pliny stood in the=20


_
him, without affording him any equivalent--then indeed he becomes indolent,=
 that is, he merely=20

provides for the wants of to-day. This apathy is perpetuated through numero=
us generations till it=20

becomes national habit, and then we falsely call it nature. It cannot be to=
o often repeated, that=20

from the poles to the equator, man is the creature of his civil institution=
s, and is active in proportion=20

to the freedom he enjoys. Who that has perused the History of Java by Sir S=
. Raffles, [50] and=20

seen the effects of government planned by the talents of Minto in the spiri=
t of the British=20

constitution in that country, will now accuse the Javanese of unwillingness=
 to work, if the fruits of=20

his labour are secured to him? And yet we remember when a Javanese was anot=
her name for=20

every thing that is detestable. It is ever thus--we blame the race, because=
 that flatters our pride--

we should first look to their institutions. I return to the Phillippines.  =
The cause, then, of their little=20

progress is "because there is no security for property;" or in other words,=
 the smallness of the=20

salaries of the officers of justice, as well as of other members of governm=
ent, and the profligacy=20

inseparable from all despotic governments, have laid the inhabitants under =
that curse of all=20

societies, venal courts of justice. Does an unfortunate Indian scrape toget=
her a few dollars to buy=20

a buffalo, in which consists their whole riches? Woe to him if it is known;=
 and if his house is in a=20

lonely situation--he is infallibly robbed. Does he complain, and is the rob=
ber caught? In three=20

months he is let loose again (perhaps with some trifling punishment), to ta=
ke vengeance on his=20

accuser, and renew his depredations.  Hundreds of Indian families are yearl=
y ruined in this=20

manner. Deprived of their cattle, on which they depend for subsistence, the=
y grow desperate and=20

careless of future exertion, which can but lead to the same results, and th=
us either drag on a=20

miserable existence from day to day, or join with the robbers [51] to pursu=
e the same mode of life,=20

and to exonerate themselves from paying tributes and taxes, in return for w=
hich no protection is=20

granted. In many provinces this has been carried to such an extent, that wh=
ole districts are=20

rendered impassable by the robbers, [52] who even lay villages under contri=
bution!  This is the=20

state of the inland towns. On the coasts, and while a flotilla of gun-boats=
 is maintained at an=20

expense of upwards of half a million of dollars annually, there is no part =
safe from the attacks of=20

the Malay pirates from Borneo, Sooloo, and Mindanao. These make regular cru=
ises to procure=20

slaves, and have even not unfrequently carried them off, not only from the =
bay of Manila, [53] but=20

even from within gun-shot of its ramparts! The very soldiers and sailors se=
nt for their protection=20

plunder them. An Indian in whose neighbourhood troops are posted, or who se=
es the gun-boats=20

approaching, can no longer consider his property safe; and in the very vici=
nity of Manila, soldiers=20

ramble about with their loaded muskets, and pilfer all they lay hands upon =
at midday! [54]  Does=20

the Indian, in spite of all this, escape, and by patient industry make a li=
ttle way in the world? he is=20

vexed with offices; he is chosen Alguazil, Lieutenant, and Captain of his t=
own; to these offices no=20

pay is attached, they always occasion vessel, calmly dictating notes and ob=
servations on the awful=20

scene. Reaching Stabiae, he found a friend in great fear, preparing for fli=
ght, and waiting for a=20

change of wind. Pliny ordered baths, and sat calmly down to supper, assurin=
g his friend that the=20

lurid flames on the mountain sides were but villages fired by the heated st=
ones. Retiring to rest, his=20

anxious friends heard him snoring. Finding they were about to be entombed i=
n the falling cinders,=20

they roused him, and all, tying pillows on their heads as protection from t=
he showers of stones,=20

sought the seashore; but the waves ran too high for them to embark. It was =
still dark as Erebus in=20

the limit of the cloud, though already broad day. Drinking some water, Plin=
y stretched himself on a=20



mat; but an unusual rush of sulphurous vapor compelled the company to dispe=
rse, and two=20

servants assisted him to rise, but he at once fell back dead. Perhaps the n=
oxious vapors were in=20

greater quantity near the ground. His nephew tells us he always had weak lu=
ngs. The company=20

fled. Three days later, Pliny=E2=80=99s body was found =E2=80=9Clooking mor=
e like a man asleep than dead.=E2=80=9D At=20

Misenum, fourteen miles away, the earth was constantly and violently shaken=
. Houses were=20

toppling down. Chariots could not be steadied, even by supporting them with=
 large stones. The=20

sea rushed back, leaving many marine animals stranded high and dry. The dar=
k cloud on=20

Vesuvius flamed and roared. The cloud enveloped Misenum and spread to Capre=
=C3=A6. =E2=80=9CNothing was=20

to be heard but the shrieks of women and children, and the cries of men; so=
me were calling for=20

their children, others for their parents, others for their husbands, and on=
ly distinguishing each=20

other by their voices; one was lamenting his own fate, another that of his =
family; some wished to=20

die that they might escape the dreadful fear of death; but the greater part=
 imagined that the last=20

and eternal night was come, which was to destroy the gods and the world tog=
ether.=E2=80=9D Then came=20

the flash of flames; then darkness and ashes, blinding, crushing, burying. =
Stabiae also was buried.=20

But the destruction of the two great cities is given no word; it was sudden=
 and complete. The ruins=20

show they were shattered by an earthquake. Then showers of broken lava rush=
ed upon=20

Herculaneum; while Pompeii, farther away, was reached only by the cinder-sh=
owers. Dion Cassius=20

tells us the people were seated in the theatres when the shock came.  In th=
eir terror, every object=20

was distorted and magnified. =E2=80=9CA multitude of men, of superhuman sta=
ture, resembling giants,=20

appeared sometimes on the mountains, sometimes in the environs; stones and =
smoke were=20

thrown out; then the giants seemed to rise again, while the sounds of trump=
ets were heard.=E2=80=9D=20

Cassius, however, wrote a century and a half after the disaster; and the ch=
ief value of his=20

testimony is to show how terrible and lasting an impression had been made u=
pon the=20

Campanians, from whom he derived his narrative.  After the desolation, the =
site of Pompeii was=20

searched for such relics as might be of practical use elsewhere. The search=
 was rough and=20

destructive. The Emperor Alexander Severus made the place a =E2=80=9Csort o=
f quarry from which he drew=20

a great quantity of marbles, columns and beautiful statues which he employe=
d in adorning the=20

edifices which he constructed at Rome. Modern research has discovered but f=
ew gold and=20


_
he is pinched or cheated by the Mestizos, a forestalling, avaricious, and t=
yrannical race. Does he=20

suffer in silence? it is a signal for new oppressions: does he complain? a =
law suit. The Mestizos=20

are all connected, they are rich, and the Indian is poor.  The imperfect mo=
de of trial, both in civil=20

and criminal cases (by written declarations and the decisions of judges alo=
ne), lays them open to a=20

thousand frauds; for if the magistrate be supposed incorruptible, his notar=
ies or writers (escribanos=20

and escribientes) are not so; and from their knavery, declarations are ofte=
n falsified, or one paper=20

is exchanged for another whilst in the act of or before signing them.  To s=
uch a degree does this=20

exist, that few Indians, even of those who can read Spanish tolerably, will=
 sign a declaration made=20

before a magistrate without threats, or without having some one on whom the=
y can depend, to=20

assure them they may safely do so. Nor is this to be wondered at, when it i=
s known that=20

declarations on which the life or fortune of an individual may depend are l=
eft, often for days, in the=20

power of writers or notaries, any of whom may be bought for a doubloon; and=
 some of them are=20

even the menial servants of the magistrate! This applies to Luzon. In the o=
ther islands, this=20

miserable system is yet worse: they have seldom but one communication a yea=
r with the capital,=20

to which all causes of any magnitude are sent for decision or confirmation;=
 and, as the papers are=20

often (purposely) drawn up with some informality, the cause, after sufferin=
g all the first ordeal of=20

chicane and knavery, experiences a year's delay silver articles, coins, and=
 statues. It has=20

developed however, a far more fearful and faithful picture of the eruption =
than has been given by=20

any historian. The clouds of falling ashes so enveloped each object as to p=
reserve an exact=20

impression, from which casts have been made, showing every curve and line, =
even to the texture=20

of the clothes. So we look upon the death-agony, and conceive the terrors o=
f the scene.  Here is=20

the arena. Here were skeletons; perhaps of gladiators already slain; perhap=
s of wounded men,=20

unable to rise, who rolled and gasped, and struggled in the choking gloom. =
There is the prison;=20

you may see the fetters still round the leg bones of the inmates.  Here sto=
od the temple of Isis. On=20

that pedestal was a beautiful image of her, draped in purple and gold. In t=
he next room lay a priest=20

beside the battered wall, with axe in hand. In the next room sat a priest o=
vertaken at his dinner. In=20

other cloisters lay other priests, who had remained at the temple, perhaps =
deeming Isis would=20

protect them in that awful hour. Close by the prison door lay a skeleton wi=
th a handful of silver=20

coins. Mayhap some one had perished there while endeavoring to bribe the ja=
ilor to release a=20

prisoned friend. Close by that column, in his narrow niche, a Roman sentry =
stood, full armed;=20

observing to the last, stern, unflinching obedience to superior powers, who=
 neglected to relieve=20

him in the terror of the time.  In the vault of a beautiful suburban villa =
of Diomed, lay eighteen=20

adults, a boy, and an infant, huddled together in attitudes terribly expres=
sive of the agony of a=20

lingering death. To the=20


_
awaits it at Manila. Or should the cause be at length carried to the Audien=
cia, or Supreme Court,=20

and there, as is sometimes the case, be judged impartially, the delay of th=
e decision renders it=20

useless--the sentence is evaded--or treated with contempt! This may appear =
almost incredible, but=20

known children still clung their long, blonde hair. There was the impress l=
eft by the bust of a young=20

girl of striking beauty. Near the garden gate without the house were two sk=
eletons; one with a=20

bunch of keys and a quantity of money; the other with a number of silver va=
ses. Doubtless the=20

family had=20


_
While the civil power is thus shamefully corrupt or negligent of its duties=
, the church has not=20

forgotten that she too has claims on the Indian. She has marked out, exclus=
ive of Sundays, above=20

40 days in the year on which no labour can be performed throughout the isla=
nds. Exclusive of=20

these are the numerous local feasts in honor of the patron saints of towns =
and churches. [55] The=20

influence of these extends often through a groupe of many islands, always t=
o many leagues round=20

their different sanctuaries; and often lasting three or four days, sometime=
s a week, cellar; while=20

two slaves endeavored to profit by the confusion to escape with their booty=
. The stifling=20

sulphureous vapor found them out.  In the house of the Faun stood the skele=
ton of a woman; her=20

hands raised over her head. Her scattered jewels lay about the floor. Endea=
voring at length to=20

leave the house, she found the doorway blocked with ashes. The flooring of =
the upper rooms=20

began to fall, and she lifted her arms in vain attempt to stay the crumblin=
g roof. Thus was she=20

found.  In a garden near by a woman was found seven feet from the earth. Sh=
e had=20
