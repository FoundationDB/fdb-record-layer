If, therefore, you do not=20

discourteous and ungentlemanly, when you have so often received my request,=
 as well by the=20

poursuivant Aly, at present called Heugueville, in the letters delivered by=
 him in England in the=20

year 1401, as by other similar ones presented you by the poursuivant Gravil=
le, reciting my first=20

general challenge, drawn up at the h=C3=B4tel of my lord de Gaucourt at Ple=
ssis, the 12th day of May=20

1402, and by other letters sent by me to you by Berry king at arms, and whi=

imilarly opened by an incision=20

through its anterior wall which is prolonged upward through the aortic valv=
e. The cavities of the=20

auricle and ventricle, especially those of the right side, will often conta=
in blood-clots. These clots=20

are _usually_ post-mortem clots formed during the last hours of life or aft=
er death. It may=20

sometimes be necessary to distinguish these post-mortem clots from what are=
 known as ante-

mortem clots. The latter are usually of firm consistency, dry, of a whitish=
 color, and closely=20

entangled in the trabecul=C3=A6, while the former are succulent, moist, of =
a reddish-yellow color, and=20

are easily detached from the walls of the heart cavities. Ante-mortem clots=
 are rarely seen, and the=20


_
written from Paris the 12th day of June 1403, which are here copied, presen=
ted by the herald=20

Heugueville, to the most potent prince the earl of Somerset, governor of Ca=
lais. To all which letters=20

I have not found any one knight to send me his sealed answer and acceptance=
 of my propositions.=20

=E2=80=98I may therefore freely say, that I have not met with any fellowshi=
p or friendship where so much=20

chivalry abounds as in the kingdom of England, although I have come from so=
 distant a country,=20

and prosecuted my request for nearly two years; and that I must necessarily=
 return cause of death=20

to the post-mortem clots which are so often seen. After the heart is opened=
 we can with more care=20

and greater accuracy examine the condition of the valves and recognize the =
extent of valvular=20

lesions.  The condition of the endocardium should now be examined and any a=
bnormality noted.=20

Often it will be seen stained a deep red color. This is not due to disease,=
 but is caused by the=20

absorption of the coloring matter of the blood which has been set free by d=
ecomposition. The size=20

of the heart cavity and the thickness of the heart walls should be noted,=

own country without making any acquaintance with you, for which I have a gr=
eat desire, as is clear=20

from the tenor of all my letters. Should I thus depart from you without eff=
ecting my object, I shall=20

have few thanks to give you, considering the pain I am suffering, and have =
suffered for so long a=20

time. If I do not receive an answer from you within fifteen days after the =
date of this present letter,=20

my intention is, under the good pleasure of GOD, of our Lady, of my lords S=
t Michael and St=20

George, to return to my much-redoubted and sovereign lord the king of Arrag=
on. Should you,=20

within fifteen days, have any thing to write to me, I shall be found at the=
 h=C3=B4tel of my lord the=20

provost of Paris.  =E2=80=98I have nothing more to add, but to entreat you =
will have me in your=20

remembrance, and recollect the pain I am suffering. To add confidence to th=
is letter, I have signed=20

it with my sign manual, and sealed it with the seal of my arms. I have also=
 caused copies to be=20

made of our correspondence, marked A, B, C, one of which I have retained. W=
ritten at Paris, the=20

10th day of May, 1403.=E2=80=99  In consequence of this letter, Perrin de L=
oharent, sergeant at arms to the=20

king of England, calling himself a proxy in this business for the english k=
night, sent an answer=20

remembered that the heart walls may appear unusually flabby as the result o=
f decomposition, or=20

apparently thickened when death occurs in extreme systole. The interior of =
the heart can be=20

further examined by passing the enterotome into each auricle, carrying the =
incision through the=20

mitral and tricuspid valves to join at the apex with the previous incision,=
 which has been prolonged=20

through the ventricles to the apex. Thus the auriculo-ventricular valves ar=
e completely exposed.=20

Having removed the blood from the heart it is next weighed. The average nor=
mal weight of the=20

human heart is about twelve ounces in the male, and a little less in the fe=
male: its size roughly=20

corresponding to the closed hand of the individual. Normally, the thickness=
 of the walls of the left=20

ventricle about its middle is five-eighths to two-thirds of an inch, and of=
 the right ventricle one-

eighth to one-quarter of an inch.  Note the condition of the aorta above th=
e heart, whether it is=20

dilated, atheromatous, or shows calcareous deposits. Examine the coronary a=
rteries by opening=20

them with a blunt-pointed scissors. Disease of these vessels with thrombosi=
s is one of the causes=20

of sudden death which is often overlooked.  =3DThe Lungs.=3D=E2=80=94The lu=
ngs are removed by lifting them=20


_
such terms as these:  =E2=80=98To the most noble esquire, Michel d=E2=80=99=
Orris. I signify to you, on the part of my=20

lord John Prendergast, that if you will promptly pay him all the costs and =
charges he has been at=20

to deliver you by deeds of arms, according to the proposals in your letter,=
 which deeds have not=20

been accomplished from your own fault, he will cheerfully comply with your =
request; otherwise=20

know, that he will not take any further steps cavity and cutting through th=
e vessels and bronchi at=20

their base. If a lung is very adherent it is sometimes better to remove the=
 organ with the costal=20

pleura attached so as not to tear the lung substance. Examine the external =
surface of the lung as=20

to its shape, color, and consistency. Next open the large bronchi with a bl=
unt-pointed scissors, and=20

prolong the incision into the pulmonary substance along the minute bronchi.=
