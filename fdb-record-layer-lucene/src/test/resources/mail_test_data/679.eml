depressions appeared to mark the wake of the bob. Then the speed began to s=
lacken.  "They=20

work all right," Jack announced. "We'll try how they steer, now."  "Off bra=
kes!" shouted Sam, and=20

he and Nat pulled up the poles.  Once more the sled shot forward, coasting =
down the side of the=20

mountain. Bony sat beside Jack, in front, while Will was in the centre, sur=
rounded by the guns and=20

packages.  "Wow!" exclaimed Bony suddenly. "There's a bad place just ahead.=
"  "I see," remarked=20

Jack. "We must go to one side of it."  The place was a little hollow in the=
 face of the mountain, and=20

if the sled, which was headed directly for it, dipped down into it, there m=
ight be a serious accident.=20

"Jab your pole down, Nat!" cried Jack, as he calculated to which side of th=
e hollow it was best to=20

pass. "Jab it hard."  "Hard it is!" repeated Nat, as he bore down on his po=
le with all his force.  The=20

result was more than they bargained for. The sled slewed suddenly around, a=
nd only by clinging=20

desperately to it did the boys manage to save themselves from being spilled=
 off.  "Let go!" yelled=20

Jack quickly.  "Let go it is!" Nat managed to repeat, as he pulled up his p=
ole.  The sled slung=20

around straight again, and continued to slide, but the steering had been su=
ccessful, for they=20

passed well to one side of the hole.  "I guess a light jab will be all we'l=
l need to change the course=20

of this schooner," remarked Bony. "No more of those 'hard 'a port' orders, =
Jack."  "That's right. We=20

had a narrow escape."  On and on they went, Jack watching carefully for hol=
es or rocks, that he=20

might call orders to steer to one side or the other of them. The sled answe=
red her "helm" readily,=20

and, when there was need to slacken speed, the same poles served as brakes.=
  There was still a=20

long snowy stretch before them, though they had come a mile or more. It was=
 fully five miles to the=20

bottom of the slope, where the valley began and where they knew the mysteri=
ous men were=20

encamped.  The course they were on led almost straight down, and, by some c=
urious freak of=20

nature, it was quite like a cleared road down the side of the mountain. The=
re were few trees in the=20

path the sled was taking, and it seemed as if, in ages gone by, a great sno=
wslide or avalanche had=20

gone crashing down the declivity, preparing a path upon which, however, few=
 would have=20

ventured.  Now the speed, which had slackened on a place where the slope wa=
s not so great,=20

became faster. The wind whistled in the ears of the boys, and the broad run=
ners were throwing up=20

a fine shower of frozen snow.  Faster and faster the bob went. It was skimm=
ing along like a great=20

bird now, and the course was so clear that there was no need of steering.  =
Suddenly Jack spied,=20

just ahead of them, a great boulder, partly covered with snow. To strike it=
 meant a disaster, and=20

the sled was headed right for it.  "Sam! Sam!" cried Jack. "Put your pole d=
own."  This would slew=20

the sled to one side. Sam, bearing in mind what had happened when Nat put h=
is sapling down too=20

suddenly, gently dug his point into the snow. But, so great was the speed, =
that the sled was=20

slewed around almost as badly as before.  But it cleared the rock, and then=
 righted itself.  "Say,=20

but we're going some," remarked Bony.  Jack nodded.  "Too fast," he called.=
 "Put on the brakes,=20

fellows."  Nat and Sam prepared to obey this order. They bore down on the s=
aplings, but the sled=20

seemed only to go the faster.  "Put on brakes! Hard!" yelled Jack.  "We're =
trying to," called Sam.=20

He and Nat bore down with all their force. They could hear the ends of the =
saplings scraping over=20

the frozen snow, but they did not seem to take hold. There was no shower of=
 frozen crystals--no=20

depressions behind the runners.  [Illustration: "THE SLED WENT FASTER AND F=
ASTER."]  The=20

sled went faster and faster. Then Nat understood.  "The points of the brake=
s are worn off!" he=20

cried. "They won't take hold!"  "Take 'em up and sharpen 'em!" shouted Jack=
. "We've got to=20

slacken up or we'll be hurt! Sharpen the stakes."  It was the only thing to=
 do. The points of the=20



poles, dragging over the hard snow, had been worn flat and smooth. It was h=
ard work, putting=20

points on them, aboard the swaying bob, but Sam and Nat, aided by Bony and =
Will, managed to=20

do it with the hatchet. All the while the sled was skimming along, faster a=
nd faster.  "Jab 'em in!=20

Jab 'em in!" yelled Jack desperately.  Nat and Sam did so. There was a scra=
ping sound, as the=20

sharp points bit into the snow, but the speed of the sled did not seem to s=
lacken.  "The snow's=20

frozen too hard!" cried Nat. "We can't stop it now!"  "You've got to!" yell=
ed Jack. "We're going like=20

greased lightning!"  But, try as Nat and Sam did, they could not force the =
newly-sharpened stakes=20

into the ground. Jack, Bony and Will added their strength, but it was of no=
 use.  Faster and faster=20

the sled leaped down the slope. The wind cut the faces of the boys, and the=
 flying particles of=20

snow, freed by the edges of the runners, stung them like needles.  "We can'=
t stop!" said Nat,=20

hopelessly.  Straight as an arrow flew the sled.  "Look! Look!" cried Will,=
 and he pointed ahead.=20

There, right in the path, and not a quarter of a mile away, at the foot of =
the hill down which they=20

were shooting like a rocket, was a patch of blackness.  "It's a lake! A lak=
e of open water!" cried=20

Jack. "Get ready to jump!"     CHAPTER XXXII  INTO A STRANGE CAMP   It seem=

_
it plunged into the black water, might mean that they would be drawn down i=
nto the depths, never=20

to come up. So the lads prepared to leap from the swiftly-moving sled.  Yet=
 they would not jump=20

without their guns, and they hesitated a moment while they secured them. Th=
en they moved to the=20

edge of the bob.  But to leap from it, while it was traveling almost with t=
he speed of a railroad train,=20

meant no little risk. No wonder they hesitated, especially as there was no =
place to land but on the=20

hard, frozen surface of the snow, down which they were sliding.  Still, it =
was a choice of two=20

desperate expedients, and, as they supposed, they were choosing the lesser =
evil.  "Here we go!"=20

cried Nat, as he crouched for a spring.  "No! Wait! Wait!" almost screamed =
Jack. "That's not water!=20

It's ice! It's ice! We're all right! Stay on!"  He had called only just in =
time, for, as the sled came=20

nearer to the black patch, he had seen, from the glint of light upon its su=
rface, that it was hard,=20

black, thick ice.  A moment later the sled, striking a little hollow place =
bounded into the air. It came=20

down with a thump, and in another second was skimming over the frozen surfa=
ce of a little pond.=20

Straight across it flew, into a snow bank on the other side, where it came =
to an abrupt stop.  So=20

sudden, in fact, was the halting, that Will, who was near the front end, wa=
s shot from the bob, and=20

came down in the bank of snow, head first.  "Pull him out!" cried Jack, as =
he leaped off.  "Maybe=20

he's hurt."  The others hastened to the aid of their chum, and he was soon =
hauled out. He seemed=20

dazed, and there was blood coming from a cut on his head.  "Hurt much?" ask=
ed Jack anxiously.=20

"No--not much--hit my head on a stone under that pile of snow, I guess. But=
 where are we?"=20

"Where we started for, I think," replied Jack. "My, but that was a trip!"  =
"Petrified pole-cats! I should=20

say so!" ejaculated Nat. "I thought we were goners!"  "Same here," remarked=
 Sam. "But we don't=20

seem to have arrived at any place."  "We're at the foot of the hill," spoke=
 Bony. "That's something,"=20

and he tried to crack his knuckle joints, forgetting that he had thick mitt=
ens on.  "Let's see what's=20

beyond those trees," proposed Jack, after they had rested, and he pointed t=
o some dark pines that=20

fringed one shore of the pond. "Bring your guns, fellows, and come on."  "W=
hat about the grub?"=20

asked Nat.  "Leave it on the sled," replied Jack. "We'll probably come back=
 here."  He led the way=20

to the trees, and passed beyond the natural screen they formed, followed by=
 his chums. No=20

sooner had he penetrated the thick branches, than he uttered a cry of surpr=
ise. And well he might.=20

For in front of the young hunters was a strange camp, a large one, consisti=
ng of a big shed-like=20

structure, with several small log cabins grouped around it. And the place s=
melled of gasolene,=20

while from one of the cabins came a noise of machinery in operation.  "Boys=
!" exclaimed Jack,=20

"we've found the place."  "Yes, and there doesn't seem to be anybody here t=
o stop us," remarked=20

Nat.  They stood for a few moments on the edge of the permission of the cop=
