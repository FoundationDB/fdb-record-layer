superior to all other starches. Why "Made" scoffers could never understand,=

Public also bought it in large quantities, and George Middleton, son of Mut=

was forty, and then he married "family," for Lady Agnes Keills, younger dau=

him, gentle, upright,=20

and always affectionate. She adored their only child, Miles, and died quite=
 suddenly from heart=20

failure, just after that cheerful youth had joined at Woolwich. George Midd=
leton died some three=20

years later, leaving his money absolutely to his son, who came of age at tw=
enty-five. And, so far,=20

Miles had justified his father's faith in him, for he had never done anythi=
ng very foolish, and a=20

certain strain of Yorkshire shrewdness prevented him from committing any wi=
ld extravagance.  He=20

was generous, kindly, and keen on his profession, and he had reached the ag=
e of thirty-two=20

without ever having felt any overwhelming desire to marry; though it was pr=
etty well known that=20

considerable efforts to marry him suitably had been made by both mothers an=
d daughters.  The=20

beautiful and level-headed young ladies of musical comedy had failed to lan=

ng society and was quite=20

liberal, though not lavish, in the way of presents.  Young women of his own=
 rank were pleasant to=20

him, their mothers cordial, and no difficulty was ever put in the way of hi=
s enjoying their society.=20

But he was not very susceptible. Deep in his heart, in some dim, unacknowle=
dged corner, there=20

lay a humble, homely desire that he might _feel_ a great deal more strongly=
 than he had felt yet,=20

when the time and the woman came to him.  Never, until Meg smiled at him wh=
en he offered to=20

carry little Fay up that long staircase, had the thought of a girl thorough=
ly obsessed him; and it is=20

possible that even after their meetings in Kensington Gardens her image mig=
ht gradually have=20

faded from his mind, had it not occurred to Mrs. Trent to interfere.  He ha=
d seen a good deal of the=20

Trents while hunting with the Pytchley two winters ago. Lotty was a fearles=
s rider and what men=20

called "a real good sort." At one time it had sometimes crossed Captain Mid=
dleton's mind that=20

Lotty wouldn't make half a bad wife for a Horse Gunner, but somehow it had =
always stopped at the=20

idea, and when he didn't see Lotty he never thought about her at all.  Now =
that he no longer saw=20

Meg he thought about her all day and far into the night. His sensations wer=
e so new, so disturbing=20

and unpleasant, his life was so disorganised and upset, that he asked himse=
lf in varying degrees=20

of ever-accumulating irritation: "What the deuce was the matter?"  Then Mrs=
. Trent asked him to=20

She was most motherly and kind.  Just as he was wondering whether he might =
now decently take=20

leave of her, she said: "Captain Middleton, I'm going to take a great liber=

the slightest. However, he bowed and looked expectant.  "I saw you=20
