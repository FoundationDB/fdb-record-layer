 This has to be done the more king watched the spirit of another man, even =
as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it. He whose intell=
ect was thus supreme, Raoul, was the actual sovereign; the other, nothing b=
ut a phantom to whom he lent a soul; and yet, so _
Cedrenus can be credited       The Emperor Heraclius on his entry into the =
city of Bazaeum was=20

struck with admiration and wonder before the immense machine     fabricated=
 for King Chosroes,=20

which represented the night-sky with     the planets and all their revoluti=
ons, with the angels=20

presiding     over them.(609)   It was on such "spheres" that Pythagoras st=
udied Astronomy in the=20

_adyta arcana_ of the temples to which he had access. And it was there on h=
is Initiation, that the=20

eternal rotation of those spheres--"the mysterious wheels" as they are call=
ed by Clemens and=20

Denys, and which Plutarch calls delicate tenderness with which it was besto=
wed.  "I have=20

remarked also another thing," said Athos, "which is, that in firing off you=
r pistol you hold your arm=20

too far outstretched. This tension lessens the accuracy of the aim. So in t=
welve times you thrice=20

missed the mark."  "Which you, sir, struck twelve times," answered Raoul, s=
miling.  "Because I=20

bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow--so; do you understand what I me=
an?"  "Yes, sir. I=20

have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful."  "What a c=
old wind!" resumed=20

Athos; "a wintry blast. Apropos, if you fire--and you will do so, for you a=
re recommended=20


_
him, namely, the heliocentric system, the great secret of the Adyta. All th=
e discoveries of modern=20

astronomy, like all the secrets that can be revealed to it in future ages, =
were contained in the=20

secret observatories and Initiation Halls of the temples of old India and E=
gypt. It is in them that the=20

Chaldaean made his calculations, revealing to the world of the profane no m=
ore than it was fit to=20

receive.  We may, and shall be told, no doubt, that Uranus was unknown to t=
he ancients, and that=20

they were forced to reckon the sun amongst the planets and as their chief. =
How does anyone=20

know? Uranus is a modern name; but one thing is certain: the ancients had a=
 planet, "a mystery=20

planet," that they never named and that the highest Astronomus, the Hieroph=
ant, alone could=20

"confabulate with." But this seventh planet was not the sun, but the hidden=
 Divine Hierophant, who=20

was said to have a crown, and to embrace within its wheel "seventy-seven sm=
aller wheels." In the=20

archaic secret system of the Hindus, the sun is the visible Logos "Surya"; =
over him there is=20

another, the divine or heavenly Man--who, after having established the syst=
em of the world of=20

matter on the archetype of the Unseen Universe, or Macrocosm, conducted dur=
ing the Mysteries=20

the heavenly Rasa Mandala; when he was said:       To give with his right f=
oot the impulse to=20

_Tyam_ or Bhumi [Earth]     that makes her rotate in a double revolution.  =
 What says Hermes=20

again? When explaining Egyptian Cosmology he exclaims:       Listen, O my s=
on ... the Power has=20

also formed seven agents, who     contain within their circles the material=
 world, and whose action=20

is called destiny.... When all became subject to man, the Seven,     willin=
g to favour human=20

intelligence, communicated to him their     powers. But as soon as man knew=
 their true essence=20

and his own     nature, he desired to penetrate within and beyond the circl=
es and     thus break=20

their circumference by usurping the power of him who     has dominion over =
the Fire [Sun] itself;=20

after which, having     robbed one of the Wheels of the Sun of the sacred f=
ire, he fell     into=20

slavery.(610)   It is _not_ is very fond of powder--remember that in single=
 combat, which often=20

takes place in the cavalry, never to fire the first shot. He who fires the =
first shot rarely hits his man,=20

for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed, before an armed foe; =
then, whilst he fires,=20

make your horse rear; that manoeuvre has saved my life several times."  "I =
shall do so, if only in=20

gratitude----"  "Eh!" cried Athos, "are not those fellows poachers they hav=
e arrested yonder? They=20

are. Then another important thing, Raoul: should you be wounded in a battle=
, and fall from your=20

horse, if you have any strength left, disentangle yourself from the line th=
at your regiment has=20

formed; otherwise, it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death =
by the horses. At all=20

events, should you be wounded, write to me that very instant, or get some o=
ne at once to write to=20

me. We are judges of wounds, we old soldiers," Athos added, smiling.  "Than=
k you, sir," answered=20

the young man, much moved.  They arrived that very moment at the gate of th=
e town, guarded by=20

two sentinels.  "Here comes a young gentleman," said one of them, "who seem=
s as if he were=20

going to join the army."  "How do you make that out?" inquired Athos.  "By =
his manner, sir, and his=20

age; he's the second to-day."  "Has a young man, such as I am, gone through=
 this morning, then?"=20

asked Raoul.  "Faith, yes, with a haughty presence, a fine equipage; such a=
s the son of a noble=20

house would have."  "He will be my companion on the journey, sir," cried Ra=
oul. "Alas! he cannot=20

make me forget what I shall have lost!"  Thus talking, they traversed the s=
treets, full of people on=20

account of the fete, and arrived opposite the old cathedral, where first ma=
ss was going on.  "Let us=20

alight; Raoul," said Athos. "Olivain, take care of our horses and give me m=
y sword."  The two=20

gentlemen then went into the church. Athos gave Raoul some of the holy wate=
r. A love as tender=20



as that of a lover for his mistress dwells, undoubtedly, in some paternal h=
earts toward a son.=20

Athos said a word to one of the vergers, who bowed and proceeded toward the=
 basement.=20

"Come, Raoul," he said, "let us follow this=20


_
personification of the whole of mankind in relation to an event which occur=
red during its childhood,=20

so to say--the "Baptism by Fire"--which is a mystery within the great Prome=
thean Mystery, one that=20

may be at present mentioned only in its broad general features. By reason o=

growth of human intellect and the development in our age of the fifth princ=

iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step, wh=
ilst Athos and Raoul=20

descended. The sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a sil=
ver lamp on the lowest=20

step; and just below this lamp there was laid, wrapped in a flowing mantle =
of violet velvet, worked=20

with fleurs-de-lis of gold, a catafalque resting on trestles of oak. The yo=

scene by the state of his own feelings, which were=20
