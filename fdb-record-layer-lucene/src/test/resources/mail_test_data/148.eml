. All the others, together with numberless people, were put to the       sw=
ord, and lance.  And to do honour to the Lady Dutchman proved himself a sup=
erlative translator. The Dutch East India Company, till it was supplanted, =
was the conduit-pipe through which the arts of the East were allowed to pas=

deprived of his state.  All the other lords, his subjects, died       under=
 tyranny and servitude, as will=20

be told below.  9.9. The third kingdom and dominion was Maguana, a country =
equally=20

marvellous, most healthy and most fertile; where now the best sugar       o=
f the island is made. Its=20

king was called Caonabo.  In strength,       and dignity, in gravity, and p=
omp he surpassed all the=20

others.  They       captured this king with great cunning and malice, he be=
ing safe in       his own=20

house.  They put him on a ship to take him to Castile and,       as there w=
ere six ships in the port=20

ready to leave, God, who wished       to show that this, together with the =
other things, was a great=20

iniquity and injustice, sent a tempest that night that sank all the       v=
essels, drowning all the=20

Christians on board of them. The said       Caonabo perished, loaded with c=
hains, and fetters.=20

10.10. This lord had three or four very brave brothers as powerful and     =
  valiant as himself.=20

They, seeing the unjust imprisonment of their       brother and lord, and w=
itnessing the destruction=20

and slaughter the       Christians perpetrated in the other kingdoms, (part=
icularly after       they=20

knew that the king their brother was dead) armed themselves to       attack=
 the Christians and=20

avenge themselves.  The Christians went       against them with some horsem=
en.  Horses are the=20

most deadly arm       possible among the Indians.  They worked such havoc a=
nd slaughter,=20

that they desolated, and depopulated half the kingdom. 11.11. The fourth ki=
ngdom is that which is=20

called Xaragua.  This was as       the marrow, or the Court of Similarly in=
 the "all-over" marquetry=20

chest of drawers of the same period (illustrated p. 95), the panel at the s=
ide is undoubtedly a=20

clock-case panel. To examine both these chests of drawers in detail is to d=
iscover that the former=20

shows that the panels of the drawers were carefully thought out before exec=
ution. The metal drop-

handles in the centre were each intended to be there. They were in the cabi=
net-maker's mind=20

when he made his design and laid his marquetry. He has accommodated his pat=
tern to receive=20

these handles. In the other example it is seen that no such care was taken.=
 The escutcheon of the=20

locks covers a portion of the marquetry. The cabinet-maker in London had hi=
s Dutch-imported=20

panels ready to hand and he used them as he found them.  If some collector =
or expert were to=20

come along and determine that all the green and purple and flecked glass of=
 the Early Victorian=20

period, bottles with long necks and gilded stoppers, in English leather cas=
es, vases of inimitable=20

colour but execrable form, were typically English as representing early nin=
eteenth century glass,=20

we should put his theories aside as nonsense. Partly because we happen to k=
now what Bohemia=20

was exporting and partly because we know what the English glassworkers were=
 doing in the same=20

period. But in regard to 1650 to 1700 it is less easy to determine whether =
a wonderful school of=20

expert marquetry-workers existed in London as a secret industry. One must a=
ssume that they had=20

quietly assimilated all the technique of the Dutch craftsmen, and descended=
 on the town, just at=20

the right moment, with a new art, quite un-English, just at that moment whe=
n Dutch=20


_
other kingdoms in the politeness of its more ornate speech as well       as=
 in more cultured good=20

breeding, and in the multitude and       generosity of the nobles.  For the=
re were lords and nobles=20

in great       numbers.  In their costumes and beauty, the people were supe=
rior to       all others.=20

12.12. The king and lord of it was called Behechio and he had a sister     =
  called Anacaona.  Both=20

rendered great services to the King of       Castile, and immense kindnesse=
s to the Christians,=20

were in the ascendant and when Mary, the consort of William of Orange, was =
employing Marot,=20

the late Surveyor of The Hague, to convert Hampton Court from a Tudor into =
an Anglo-Orange=20

palace.  On an examination of delft earthenware of the period and Dutch dec=
orative art in general,=20

it is fairly obvious that the art impulses coincide with the various phases=
 of ornament as found on=20

the marquetry panel, whether they were the floriated designs of Italy with =
the vase and the=20

symmetrical flowers in=20


_
from many mortal dangers: and when the King Behechio died, Anacaona       w=
as left mistress of=20

the kingdom. 13.13. The governor(81) who ruled this island arrived there on=
ce, with       sixty=20

horsemen and more than three hundred foot.  The horsemen alone       were s=
ufficient to ruin the=20

whole island and the terra firma.  More       conventionalized by the Dutch=
, who clung to tulips and=20

carnations, or the arabesque designs derived from the Dutch traffic with th=
e East Indies, the=20

pseudo-Persian sherbet tray as a panel, the prayer rug as a full design. Wi=
