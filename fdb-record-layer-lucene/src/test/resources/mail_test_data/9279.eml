CHAP. XII.      THE ADMIRAL OF BRITTANY, WITH OTHER LORDS, FIGHTS THE=20

ENGLISH AT SEA.=E2=80=94GILBERT DE FRETUN MAKES WAR AGAINST KING         HE=
NRY.   In the=20

beginning of this year, the admiral of Brittany, the lord de Penhors, the l=
ord du Chastel[44], the lord=20

du Boys, with many other knights and esquires of Brittany, to the amount of=
 twelve hundred men=20

at arms, assembled at Morlens[45], and embarked on board thirty vessels at =
a port called Chastel-

Pol[46], to engage the English, who had a large fleet at sea on the look-ou=
t for merchantmen like=20

pirates. On the following Wednesday, as the English were cruising before a =
port called St=20

Matthieu[47], the Bretons came up with them, and chaced them until sun-rise=
 the ensuing=20

morning, when they engaged in battle. It lasted for three hours; but the Br=
etons at last gained the=20

victory, and took two thousand prisoners, with forty vessels with reindeer =
hair, and with the hair-

like appendage found on the fringy extremity of the baleen plates in the mo=
uth of a =E2=80=9Cbowhead=E2=80=9D=20

whale. The experiments, though far from satisfactory, were sufficiently con=
clusive to enable one to=20

recognize approximately the horse-like hair of some of the yellow races, th=
at of the negro, and that=20

of a blond Caucasian.  Beyond the forementioned characteristics, the task o=
f race recognition from=20

observation of the skull is one of great difficulty and perplexity with ill=
usory results. A considerable=20

experience of several years with the large collection of skulls in the Army=
 Medical Museum=20

enables me to speak advisedly on this point.[573]  Although the technical p=
rocedures of=20

craniometry require special measurements and employ an arsenal of special i=
nstruments, the=20

results are far from conclusive as regards the determination of human types=
. Time and space do=20

not permit the mention even in=20


_
greater part of the prisoners were thrown overboard and drowned, but some e=
scaped by promising=20

punctual payment of their ransom.  About this same time, an esquire, named =
Gilbert de Fretun, a=20

native of the country of Guines, sent his challenge to the king of England,=
 to avoid paying him his=20

homage; and in consequence, this Gilbert collected many men at arms, and ma=
de such exertions=20

that he provided himself with two vessels well equipped, and carried on a d=
estructive war against=20

the king as long as the truces between the kings of France and England were=
 broken, from which=20

event great evils ensued.                                   CHAP. XIII.    =
  THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS=20

QUARRELS WITH SIR CHARLES DE SAVOISY         AND WITH THE PROVOST OF PARIS.=
   At=20

this period, when the university of Paris was making its annual processions=
, much dissention=20

arose between some of its members, as they were near to St Catherine du Val=
 des Escoliers, and=20

the grooms of sir Charles de Savoisy, chamberlain[48] to the king of France=
, who were leading=20

their horses to drink in the river Seine. The cause of the quarrel was owin=
g to some of the grooms=20

riding their horses against the procession, and wounding some of the schola=
rs,=E2=80=94who, displeased=20

at such conduct, attacked them with stones, and knocked some of the riders =
off their horses.  The=20

grooms, on this, returned to the h=C3=B4tel de Savoisy, but soon came back =
armed with bows and=20

arrows, and accompanied by others of their fellow-servants, when they renew=
ed the attack against=20

the scholars, wounding many with their arrows and staves even when in the c=
hurch. This caused a=20

great riot. In the end, however, the great number of scholars overpowered t=
hem, and drove them=20

back, after several of them had been soundly beaten and badly wounded.  Whe=
n the procession=20

was concluded, the members of the university waited on the king, to make co=
mplaints of the insult=20

offered them, and demanded, by the mouth of their rector, that instant repa=
ration should be made=20

them for the offence which had been committed, such as the case required,=
=E2=80=94declaring, at the=20

same time, that if it were not done, they would all quit the town of Paris,=
 and fix their residence in=20

some other place, where they might be in safety.  The king made answer, tha=
t such punishment=20

should be inflicted on the offenders as that they should be satisfied there=
with. In short, after many=20

conferences, in which the members of the university urged their complaints =
to the king, as well as=20

to the princes of the blood who composed his council, it was ordered by the=
 king, to appease=20

them, that the lord Charles de Savoisy, in reparation for the offence commi=
tted by his servants,=20

should be banished from the king=E2=80=99s household, and from those of the=
 princes of the blood, and=20

should be deprived of all his offices. His h=C3=B4tel was demolished, and r=
azed to the ground; and he=20

was besides condemned to found two chapelries of one hundred livres each, w=
hich were to be in=20

the gift of the university.  After this sentence had been executed, sir Cha=
rles de Savoisy quitted=20

France, and lived for some time greatly dispirited in foreign countries, wh=
ere, however, he=20

conducted himself so temperately and honourably[49], that at length princip=
ally, through the queen=20

of France and some great lords, he made his peace with the university, and,=
 with their=20

approbation, returned again to various methods most relied upon by trained =
craniologists. Among=20

the oldest operations of cephalometry, as well as the most incomplete, is t=
he measurement of the=20

so-called facial angle, which is employed to distinguish the skull of a low=
er order of animal from=20

that of the negro and the white man. This angle, acute in the skulls of the=
 lower animals,=20

approaches a right angle as we ascend the zoological scale; being from 30=
=C2=B0 to 65=C2=B0 in the various=20

apes; 75=C2=B0 in the Mongolian; about 70=C2=B0 in the negro, and between 8=
0=C2=B0 and 90=C2=B0 for whites. The=20

prognathous (projecting) jaws of the negro cranium are distinctive, as well=
 as the shape of the=20



nasal opening, which in the black is an equilateral triangle, while it is i=
sosceles in the white. The=20

books usually speak of the Eskimo skull as pyramidal, which in point of fac=
t is not true. Inspection=20

and examination of a large collection of Eskimo crania has changed and grea=
tly modified some of=20

the previous notions of the conventional Eskimo skull. From more than one h=
undred, collected in=20

the vicinity of Bering Strait,[574] I find that the skulls present very con=
siderable variations among=20

themselves; some being brachycephalic, others dolichocephalic. In many the =
facial angle is 80=C2=B0,=20

and in one instance 84=C2=B0, which exceeds that observed by me in many Ger=
man skulls. Nor is the=20

prominence of the zygomatic arches such a constant difference in the config=
uration as to justify=20

one in speaking of the skull as pyramidal. On the contrary, in many of the =
specimens lines drawn=20

from the most projecting part of the zygomatic arch and touching the sides =
of the frontal bone,=20

instead of forming a triangle on being elongated, might, like the asymptote=
s of a parabola, be=20

extended to infinity and never meet. The index of the foramen magnum in the=
se skulls is about the=20

same as that of European crania. The internal capacity shows marked differe=
nce, the cubic=20

contents of the endocranium averaging that of the French or Germans.  As so=
me modern writers=20

lay great stress on the measurement of the cranial capacity, not only as an=
 aid to race=20

identification, but as an adjunct in the study of the criminal and insane c=
lasses, it may not be amiss=20

to give the salient facts relative thereto.  It is admitted that the crania=
l capacity may vary with the=20

intellectual state, hydrocephalic skulls, of course, being excluded. Microc=
ephalic adults give a=20

figure inferior to that of gorillas, some being as low as 419 c.c. Andaman =
Islanders and=20

autochthonous Australians appear, in respect to cranial capacity, to be mos=
t badly off. The=20

capacity of an Andaman has been found as low as 1,094 c.c.; while that of A=
ustralians=20

(autochthonous) and of some American tribes show an average capacity of 1,2=
24 c.c. in the=20

normal as well as in their deformed crania. The cranial capacity increases =
in the yellow races and=20

attains its maximum in the white races. In the middle European race 1,500 c=
.c. may be accepted=20

as the average; 1,750 c.c. is the maximum, and anything above is macrocepha=
lic; while the=20

minimum is 1,206 c.c., which is rather too low than too high. According to =
Topinard=E2=80=99s nomenclature=20

of the cranial capacity, macrocephalic in the adult European male are those=
 having a capacity of=20

1,950 c.c. and above; a large skull is one of 1,950 to 1,650 c.c.; average =
or ordinary, 1,650 to=20

1,450 c.c.; small, 1,450 to 1,150 c.c.; microcephalic=20


_
Not long after this event, sir William de Tigouville[50], provost of Paris,=
 caused two clerks of the=20

university to be executed: the one named Legier de Montthilier, a Norman, a=
nd the other Olivier=20

Bourgeois, a Breton, accused of having committed divers felonies. For this =
reason,=20

notwithstanding they were clerks, they were led to execution, and, although=
 they loudly claimed=20

their privileges, as of the clergy, in hopes of being rescued, they were hu=
ng on the gibbet. The=20

university, skulls of the insane are below the type, a measurement of sixte=
en male skulls giving an=20

average of only 1,449 c.c. Scotchmen head the list with the most voluminous=
 skulls, and according=20

to a tabular statement made up from Welcker, Aitken, Broca, and Meigs, the =
English come next,=20

with a capacity of 1,572 c.c. Then follow Eskimo, 1,483 c.c.; Germans, 1,44=
8 c.c.; French, 1,403 to=20

1,461 c.c.; South African negroes, 1,372 c.c.; Ancient Peruvians, 1,361 c.c=
.; Malay, 1,328 c.c.;=20

Mexican,=20


_
sentenced to erect a large and high cross of free stone, near the gibbet on=
 the road leading to=20

Paris, on which the figures of the two clerks were carved. They caused him =
also to have their=20

bodies taken down from the gibbet, and placed in a cart, covered with black=
 cloth; and thus=20

accompanied by him and his sergeants, with others bearing lighted torches o=
f wax, were they=20

carried to the church of St Mathurin, and there delivered by the provost to=
 the rector of the=20

university, who had them honourably interred in the cloisters of this churc=
h; and an epitaph was=20

placed over them, to their perpetual remembrance.                          =
          CHAP. XIV.      THE=20

SENESCHAL OF HAINAULT PERFORMS A DEED OF ARMS WITH THREE         OTHERS, IN=
=20

THE PRESENCE OF THE KING OF ARRAGON.=E2=80=94THE         ADMIRAL OF BRITTAN=
Y=20

UNDERTAKES AN EXPEDITION AGAINST         ENGLAND.   In this same year, an e=
nterprise of=20

arms was undertaken by the gallant seneschal of Hainault, in the presence o=
f the king of=20

Arragon[51].  The combatants were to be four against four, and their arms b=
attle-axes, swords and=20

daggers: the combat was to be for life or death, subject, however, to the w=
ill of the judge of the=20

field.  The companions of the seneschal were, sir James de Montenay, a knig=
ht of Normandy, sir=20

Tanneguy du Chastel, from the duchy of Brittany, and a notable esquire call=
ed Jean c.c.; Hottentot=20

and Polynesian, each 1,230 c.c.; Australians, 1,364 c.c.; and Nubians, 1,31=
3 c.c. The cranial=20

capacity in man, like that of the anthropoid apes, varies according to sex,=
 the difference being so=20

great that it is necessary to measure separately.  In the troglodyte skulls=
 of prehistoric times the=20

variation is not more than 99.5 c.c.; but in the contemporaneous races the =
difference varies from=20

143 to 220 c.c. French craniologists usually speak of the Auvernats as poss=
essing the highest=20

cerebral capacity (1,523 c.c.), and mention the skull of a Parisian of 1,90=
0 c.c. as the highest=20

known. Some Eskimo skulls, however, measure from 1,650 to 1,715 c.c., and t=
wo eurycephalic=20

Indian skulls in the anatomical section of the Army Medical Museum measure =
respectively 1,785=20

and 1,920 c.c.  Mr. Havelock Ellis, speaking of the psychic characteristics=
 of criminals, says that=20

the lower human races present a far larger proportion of anatomical abnormi=
ties than the ordinary=20

European population; and Sir William Turner writes of the skulls collected =
during the _Challenger_=20

expedition that although their number is certainly too limited to base any =
broad generalization on,=20

as to the relative frequency of occurrence of particular variations in the =
different races, there is=20

obviously a larger proportion of important variations than would occur in a=
=20

kingdom of Arragon,=E2=80=94and their chief was named Tollemache de Sainte =
Coulonne, of the king of=20

Arragon=E2=80=99s household, and much beloved by him: the second, sir Pierr=
e de Monstarde[53]: the=20

third, Proton de Sainte Coulonne; and the fourth, Bernard de Buef.  When th=
e appointed day=20

approached, the king had the lists magnificently prepared near to his palac=
e in the town of=20

Valencia. The king came to the seat allotted for him, attended by the the w=
hite races. Thus, for=20

example, the squamo-frontal articulation is found in less than two per cent=
 of European skulls,=20

while it is found in twenty per cent of negroes, according to Ecker, and 16=
.9 in Australian skulls,=20

according to Virchow. Again, the spheno-pterygoid foramen is found in 4.8 p=
er cent of European=20

skulls and in 20 per cent of American Indians; 30 per cent in Africans; 32 =
per cent in Asiatics, and=20

50 per cent in=20
