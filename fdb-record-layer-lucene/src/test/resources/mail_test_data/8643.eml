"Well, finally after Medill began cracking his knuckles and the king began =
crossing and recrossing=20

his legs, I saw it was time to go. I knew how the king felt. Every busy man=
 has to meet a lot of=20

bores. I sit hours with bores who the globe, the focus of volcanoes is in t=
he most ancient soils; and=20

it appears that an intimate connection exists between the great phenomena t=
hat heave up and=20

liquify the crust of our planet, and those igneous meteors which are seen f=
rom time to time on its=20

surface, and which from their littleness we are tempted to attribute=20


_
how the king felt. So I cleared my throat and said: 'Well Medill, don't you=
 think we'd better excuse=20

ourselves to his majesty and go?' The king put up his hand mildly and said:=
 'O please!' and the=20

colonel in charge of the party gulped at my sympathy for the king; but I wa=
s not to be balked, and=20

we all rose and after shaking hands around, the colonel led us out. And I d=
idn't know that I had=20

committed social manslaughter until the colonel exclaimed when we were in t=
he corridor: 'Oh you=20

republicans--you republicans, how you do like to show royalty its place!'" =
Medill has another=20

version. He declares that Henry stood the king's obvious ennui as long as h=
e could, then he rose=20

and cried: "O King! live for ever, but Medill and I must pull our freight!"=
 This version probably is=20

apochryphal! The Italian colonel declares that Henry expostulated: "Well, h=
ow in the dickens was I=20

to know that a king always gives the high sign for company to leave!"  This=
 Italian king is a vital=20

institution. He could be elected president. For he is a mixer, in spite of =
his diffident ways. When the=20

army in Northern Italy was hammering away at the Austrians, the king was wi=
th the soldiers. One=20

gets the impression that he is with the people pretty generally in their in=
fluence of the atmosphere.=20

Duida, though lower than the height assigned to it by popular belief, is ho=
wever the most=20

prominent point of the whole group of mountains that separate the basin of =
the Lower Orinoco=20

from that of the Amazon. These mountains lower still more rapidly on the no=
rth-east, toward the=20

Purunama, than on the east, toward the Padamo and the Rio Ocamo. In the for=
mer direction the=20

most elevated summits next to Duida are Cuneva, at the sources of the Rio P=
aru (one of the=20

tributary streams of the Ventuari), Sipapo, Calitamini, which forms one gro=
up with Cunavami and=20

the peak of Umiana. East of Duida, on the right bank of the Orinoco, Marava=
ca, or Sierra=20

Maraguaca, is distinguished by its elevation, between the Rio Caurimoni and=
 the Padamo; and on=20

the left bank of the Orinoco rise the mountains of Guanaja and Yumariquin, =
between the Rios=20

Amaguaca and Gehette. It is almost superfluous to repeat that the line whic=
h passes through=20

these lofty summits (like those of the Pyrenees, the Carpathian mountains, =
and so many other=20

chains of the old continent) is very distinct from the line that marks the =
partition of the waters. This=20
