  "Very, sir. I hardly see=20

how we can do it, sir!"  "That's too bad--now in our country education, fro=

"Is that so, sir," the cable was running through her hands as she spoke. Th=
en she added as the=20

elevator passed the second floor, "If we could only have that here, sir. If=
 we only could, sir!"  "Well,=20

Children should start life as equals. There is no snobbery so cruel as the =
snobbery that marks off=20

childhood into classes! When you women vote here, the first thing to do is =
to smash that=20

nonsense. But in the meantime keep the kids in work for the church. The pas=
turages at the foot of=20

the mountains round Santa Barbara are not so rich as at Esmeralda, but supe=
rior to those at San=20

Fernando de Atabapo. The grass is short and thick, yet the upper stratum of=
 earth furnishes only a=20

dry and parched granitic sand. The savannahs (far from fertile) of the bank=
s of the Guaviare, the=20

Meta, and the Upper Orinoco, are equally destitute of the mould which aboun=
ds in the surrounding=20

forests, and of the thick stratum of clay, which covers the sandstone of th=
e Llanos, or steppes of=20

Venezuela. The small herbaceous mimosas contribute in this zone to fatten t=
he cattle, but are very=20

rare between the Rio Jao and the mouth of the Guaviare.  During the few hou=
rs of our stay at the=20

mission of Santa Barbara, we obtained pretty accurate ideas respecting the =
Rio Ventuari, which,=20

next to the Guaviare, appeared to me to be the most considerable tributary =
of the Orinoco. Its=20

banks, heretofore occupied by the Maypures, are still peopled by a great nu=
mber of independent=20

nations. On going up by the mouth of the Ventuari, which forms a delta cove=
red with palm-trees,=20

, two streams that rise at=20

the foot of the lofty mountains of Cuneva. Higher up, on the west, lie the =
Mariata and the=20

Manipiare, inhabited by the Macos and Curacicanas. The latter nation is rem=
arkable for their=20

active cultivation of cotton. In a hostile incursion (entrada) a large hous=
e was found containing=20

more than thirty or forty hammocks of a very fine texture of spun cotton, c=
ordage, and fishing=20

implements. The natives had fled; and Father Valor informed us, that the In=
dians of the mission=20

who accompanied him had set fire to the house before he could save these pr=
oductions of the=20

industry of the Curacicanas. The=20

"We've talked that all over," she answered. "And we're certainly going to t=
ry. He'll have his=20

pension, and I'll have this job and he'll learn a trade and I think we can =
manage, sir!" The "sir"=20

came belated.  "Go to it, sister, and luck to you," cried her passenger as =
he rose from his bench.=20

The car was nearing the fourth floor.  "We shall," she answered; "no fear o=
f that." She stopped the=20

car, and they smiled as friends as she let him out of the door. "Well--good=
 morning," she said as=20

he turned down the corridor. The "sir" had left entirely when they reached =
the fourth floor. And all=20

the women of Europe, excepting perhaps those think themselves very superior=
 to these supposed=20

savages, appeared to me far less industrious. The Rio Manipiare, one of the=
 principal branches of=20

the Ventuari, approaches near its source those lofty mountains, the norther=
n ridge of which gives=20

birth to the Cuchivero. It is a prolongation of the chain of Baraguan; and =
there Father Gili places=20

the table-land of Siamacu, of which he vaunts the temperate climate. The up=
per course of the Rio=20

Ventuari, beyond the confluence of the Asisi, and the Great Raudales, is al=
most unknown. I was=20

informed only that the Upper Ventuari bends so much towards the east that t=

r" and are emerging=20

into life at the fourth floor as human beings.  It may be well to digress a=
 moment in this narrative,=20

from our purely martial adventure, that we may consider of the river. The p=
roximity of the tributary=20

streams of the Carony, the Caura, and the Ventuari, has facilitated for age=
s the access of the=20

Caribs to the banks of the Upper Orinoco. Bands of this warlike and trading=
 people went up from=20
