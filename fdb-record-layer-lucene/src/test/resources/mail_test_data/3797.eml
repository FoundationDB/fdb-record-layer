sort of creepy look about the whole place.  "I wonder where the last propri=
etor hung himself,=20

dear?" whispered Lucy in her cousin's ear.  But from the rather dismal _sal=
on_ they passed into a=20

more cheerful room. As the old housekeeper opened the shutters one by one s=
treams of strong=20

sunlight entered the place; the floor was inlaid wood, the walls were panel=
led to the ceiling, and=20

elaborately carved; the ceiling itself was of polished wood, beautifully ve=
ined; the furniture was of=20

oak, heavy and substantial; attempt at ornament there was none, nor was orn=
ament needed, for=20

from the windows of this room one looked out straight over the blue waters =
of the lake. The=20

cheerful sound of music came from the deck of a big saloon steamer, bearing=
 its crowd of noisy=20

tourists. On the opposite shore, at Villeneuve, were the wooded grounds of =
the hotel Byron;=20

Chillon, a white spot in the turquoise sea, was plainly visible to the righ=
t. The cousins stepped to=20

the open windows and descended the flight of stairs that led from the centr=
e one; it brought them=20

to a little terrace which overhung the lake.  Lucy clapped her hands with d=
elight, her more staid=20

cousin was rapt in pleased astonishment. In an instant the thousand and one=
 well-known=20

descriptions ran through her mind, and she thought of the impassioned pictu=
re of the palace on=20

the Como lake, which pre-sanctified. We bring back the blessed sacrament to=
 the desolate altar,=20

and unveil the cross. It is one of our highest ceremonies, the adoration of=
 the cross, which the=20

Protestants persist in calling idolatry, though I presume they will give us=
 leave to know the=20

meaning of our own words and actions, and hope they will believe us when we=
 tell them that our=20

genuflexions and kissing of the cross are no more than exterior expressions=
 of that love which we=20

bear in our hearts to Jesus crucified; and that the words adoration and ado=
re, as applied to the=20

cross, only signify that respect and veneration due to things immediately r=
elating to God and His=20

service.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI see no idolatry in it,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=
 musingly.  =E2=80=9CNo impartial person could,=E2=80=9D rejoined=20

Father Coleman; =E2=80=9Cbut unfortunately all these prejudices were imbibe=
d when the world was not so=20

well informed as at present. A good deal of mischief has been done, too, by=
 the Protestant=20

versions of the Holy Scriptures; made in a hurry, and by men imperfectly ac=
quainted with the=20

Eastern tongues, and quite ignorant of Eastern manners. All the accumulated=
 research and=20

investigation of modern times have only illustrated and justified the offic=
es of the Church.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat is=20

very interesting,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CNow, this question of id=
olatry,=E2=80=9D said Father Coleman, =E2=80=9Cthat is a=20

fertile subject of misconception.=20

into Pauline's delighted ear. Ought she not to be happy? Was not her handso=
me husband the very=20

ideal Claude?  Both girls were enthusiastic; they spent a long afternoon de=
termining this,=20

arranging that. But spring evenings in Switzerland are chilly; Capt suggest=
ed their return to the=20

hotel. They reluctantly bade farewell to the little villa; but during all t=
he long drive back they talked=20

of nothing but the furnishing of the various rooms, the things that must be=
 had, the things they=20

could not do without. All this was argued _pro_ and _con._; colours were vi=
tal matters, fashion=20

equally important; but not one thought did the ladies give themselves as to=
 the cost. Happy girls,=20

they were quite right; money in such a case as this was no object. Lucky ar=
e they who have not to=20

count the cost, these are to destroy idolatry because idolatry then meant d=
ark images of Moloch=20

opening their arms by machinery, and flinging the beauteous first-born of t=
he land into their huge=20

forms, which were furnaces of fire; or Ashtaroth, throned in moonlit groves=
, and surrounded by=20

orgies of ineffable demoralization. It required the declared will of God to=
 redeem man from such=20

fatal iniquity, which would have sapped the human race. But to confound suc=
h deeds with the=20

commemoration of God=E2=80=99s saints, who are only pictured because their =
lives are perpetual incentives=20

to purity and holiness, and to declare that the Queen of Heaven and the Mot=
her of God should be=20

to human feeling only as a sister of charity or a gleaner in the fields, is=
 to abuse reason and to=20

outrage the heart.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe live in dark times,=E2=80=9D said =
Lothair,=20
