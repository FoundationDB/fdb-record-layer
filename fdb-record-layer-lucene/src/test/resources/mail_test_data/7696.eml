cur-like barks used often to rouse us, and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields, 

"mousing" around the stone-heaps, making a queer, squeaking sound like a mouse, to call the real 

mice out of their grass nests inside the stone-heaps. This, indeed, is a favorite trick of Reynard.  At 

the time of my story, my friend Tom Edwards (ten years of age) and myself were in the turkey 

business, equal partners. We owned a flock of thirty-one turkeys. These roosted by night in a large 

butternut tree in front of Tom's house--in the very top of it, and by day they wandered about the 

edges of the clearings in quest of beech-nuts, which were very plentiful that fall.  All went well till 

the last week in October, when, on taking the census one morning, a turkey was found to be 

missing; the thirty-one had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening. It was the first one 

we had lost.  We proceeded to look for traces. Our suspicions were divided. Tom thought it was 

door stopped him at last. It might have hid mysterious and questionable things, but it said 

laconically 'Push,' and he courageously pushed... He was in a kind of boudoir thickly populated 

with tables and chairs. The swift transmigration from the blatant street to a drawing-room had a 

startling effect on him: it caused him to whip off his hat as though his hat had been red hot. Except 

for two tall elegant creatures who stood together at the other end of the boudoir, the chairs and 

tables had the place to themselves. He was about to stammer an excuse and fly, when one of the 

gentlewomen turned her eye on him for a moment, and so he sat down. The gentlewomen then 

resumed their conversation. He glanced cautiously about him. Elm-trees, firmly rooted in a border 

of Indian matting, grew round all the walls in exotic profusion, and their topmost branches 

splashed over on to the ceiling. A card on the trunk of a tree, announcing curtly, "Dogs not 

allowed," seemed to enhearten

thought it might have been an owl. But under the tree, in the soft dirt, where the potatoes had 

recently been dug, we found fox-tracks, and two or three ominous little wads of feathers, with one 

long tail feather adrift. Thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of 

the butternut--had a fit, perhaps--and that its flutterings had attracted the attention of some 

passing fox, which had, forthwith, taken it in charge. It was, as we regarded it, pause one of the 

gentlewomen swam haughtily towards him and looked him between the eyes. She spoke no word, 

but her firm, austere glance said:  "Now, out with it, and see you behave yourself!"  He had been 

ready to smile chivalrously. But the smile was put to sudden death.  "Some tea, please," he said 

faintly, and his intimidated tone said, "If it isn't troubling you too much."  "What do you want with 

it?" asked the gentlewoman abruptly, and as he was plainly at a loss 


_
no care on our part could have well foreseen, and a casualty such as turkey-raisers are 

unavoidably heirs to, and we bore our loss with resignation. We were glad to remember that 

turkeys did not often fall off their roosts.  This theory received something of a check when our flock 

counted only  "Tea-cake," he replied, though he hated tea-cake. But he was afraid.  "You've 

escaped this time," said the drapery of her muslins as she swam from his sight. "But no nonsense 

while I'm away!"  When she sternly and mutely thrust the refection before him, he found that 

everything on the table

a great many more feathers under the tree. This put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the 

matter. No algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate, together 

with our prospective profits, in the light of this new fact. It was clear that something must be done, 

and at once, growing elm-trees.  After one cup and one slice, when the tea had become stewed 

and undrinkable, and the tea-cake a material suitable for the manufacture of shooting boots, he 

resumed, at any rate partially, his presence of mind, and remembered that he had done nothing 

positively criminal in entering the
