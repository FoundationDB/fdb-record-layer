Whinstane Sandy has just come in with Peter's box, two days late. I felt su=
re that Peter would not=20

utterly forget us. There is still a great deal of shouting down in the kitc=
hen, where that most=20

miraculous of boxes has been unpacked. As for myself, I've had a hankering =
to be alone, to think=20

things over. But my meditations don't seem to get me anywhere.... Dinkie ha=
s just come up to=20

show me his brand-new bridle for Buntie. It is a magnificent bridle, as shi=
ny and jingly as any lad=20

could desire. I tried to get him to put it down, so that I could draw him o=
ver close to me and talk to=20

him. But Dinkie is too excited for any such demonstration. He's beginning, =
I'm afraid, to consider=20

emotion a bit unmanly. He seems to be losing his craving to be petted and p=
ampered. There are=20

times, I can see, when he desires his fence-lines to be respected.     _Sun=
day the Twenty-Ninth_=20

Nearly six weeks, I notice, have slipped by. For a month and a half, appare=
ntly, the impulse to air=20

my troubles went hibernating with the bears. Yet it has been a mild winter,=
 so far, with very little=20

snow and a great deal of sunshine--a great deal of sunshine which doesn't e=
late me as it ought. I=20

can't remember who it was said a happy people has no history. But that's no=
t true of a happy=20

woman. It's when her heart is full that she makes herself heard, that she s=
ings like a lark to the=20

world. When she's wretched, she retires with her grief....  I haven't been =
altogether wretched, it's=20

true, just as I haven't been altogether hilarious, but it disturbs me to fi=
nd that for a month and a half=20

I haven't written a line in producing the scepticism of Montaigne.  The emp=
ire itself was on the=20

point of dissolution. In empires founded by single conquerors, such as thos=
e of the East, when=20

corruption has made the reigning family its prey, the satraps make themselv=
es independent. The=20

empire of Alexander was divided among his generals. The empire of the conqu=
ering republic of=20

Rome, the republic itself having succumbed to vices analagous to the corrup=
tion of a reigning=20

family, was about to be broken up by the great military chiefs. Pompey had =
already, in fact, carved=20

out for himself a separate kingdom in Spain, which with its legions he had =
got permanently into his=20

own hands. Thus the unity of the civilized portion of humanity, so indispen=
sable to the future of the=20

race, would have been lost. Nor was there any remedy but one. Representatio=
n of the provinces=20

was out of the question. Supposing it possible that a single assembly could=
 have been formed out=20

of all these different races and tongues, the representation of the conquer=
ed would have been the=20

abdication of the conqueror, and abdication was a step for which the lazzar=
oni of the so-called=20

democratic party were as little prepared as the haughtiest aristocrat in Ro=
me. A world of egotism,=20

without faith or morality, could be held together only by force, which pres=
ented itself in the person=20

of the ablest, most daring, and most unscrupulous adventurer of the time. I=
f faith should again fail,=20

and the world again be reduced to a mass of egotism, the same sort of gover=
nment will again, be=20

needed. In fact, we are at this moment rather in danger of something of the=
=20


_
life. It's not that the last month or two has been empty, for no months are=
 really empty. They have=20

to be filled with something. But there are times, I suppose, when lives lie=
 fallow, the same as fields=20

lie fallow, times when the days drag like harrow-teeth across the perplexed=
 loam of our soul and=20

nothing comes of it at all. Not, I repeat, that I have been momentously unh=
appy. It's more that a=20

sort of sterilizing indifferency took possession of me and made the little =
ups and downs of=20

existence as unworthy of record as the ups and downs of the waves on the de=
adest shores of the=20

Dead Sea. It's not that I'm idle, and it's not that I'm old, and it's not t=
hat there's anything wrong with=20

this disappointingly healthy body of mine. But I rather think I need a chan=
ge of some kind. I even=20

envy Susie, who has ambled on to the Coast and is staying with the Lougheed=
s in Victoria, playing=20

golf and picking winter roses and writing back about her trips up Vancouver=
 Island and out of=20

season. But in any other case to propose to society such a model would be t=
reason to humanity.=20

The abandonment of military duty by the Roman people had, among other thing=
s, made slavery=20

more immoral than ever, because there was no longer any semblance of a divi=
sion of labour: the=20

master could no longer be said to defend the slave in war while the slave s=
upported him by labour=20

at home. Becoming more immoral, slavery became more cruel. The six thousand=
 crosses erected=20

on the road from Capua to Rome after the Servile War were the terrible proo=
f.  As to the existence=20

of an oligarchy in the bosom of the dominant republic, this would in itself=
 have been no great evil=20

to the subject world, to which it mattered little whether its tyrants were =
a hundred or a hundred=20

thousand; just as to the unenfranchised in modern communities it matters li=
ttle whether the=20

enfranchised class be large or small. In fact, the broader the basis of a t=
yranny, the more fearless=20

and=20
