ore the lethal breath of=20

selfishness and indifference every uncomfortable fact is transformed into m=
eaningless fiction, and=20

every branch of the once verdant Tree of Truth has become dried up and stri=
pped of its primeval=20

spiritual significance. Our modern Symbologist is superlatively clever only=
 at detecting phallic=20

worship and sexual emblems even where none were ever meant. But for the tru=
e student of Occult=20

Lore, White or Divine Magic could no more exist in Nature without its count=
erpart Black Magic,=20

than day without night, whether these be of twelve hours or of six months' =
duration. For him=20

everything in that Nature has an occult--a bright and a night side to it. P=
yramids and Druid's oaks,=20

dolmens and Bo-trees, plant and mineral--everything was full of deep signif=
icance and of sacred=20

truths of wisdom, when the Arch-Druid performed his magic cures and incanta=
tions, and the=20

Egyptian Hierophant evoked and guided Chemnu, the "lovely spectre," the fem=
ale Frankenstein-

creation of old, raised for the torture and test of the soul-power of the c=
andidate for initiation,=20

simultaneously with the last agonising cry of his terrestrial human nature.=
 True, Magic has lost its=20

name, and along with it its rights to recognition. But its practice is in d=
aily use; and its progeny,=20

"magnetic influence," "power of oratory," "irresistible fascination," "whol=
e audiences subdued and=20

held as though under a spell," are terms recognised and used by all, genera=
lly meaningless=20

though they now are. Its effects, however, are more determined and definite=
 among religious=20

congregations such as the Shakers, the Negro Methodists, and Salvationists,=
 who call it "the=20

action of the Holy Spirit" and "grace." The real truth is that Magic is sti=
ll in full sway amidst=20

mankind, however blind the latter to its silent presence and influence on i=
ts members, however=20

ignorant society may be, and remain, to its daily and hourly beneficent and=
 maleficent effects. The=20

world is full of such unconscious magicians--in politics as well as in dail=
y life, in the Church as in=20

the strongholds of Free-Thought. Most of those magicians are "sorcerers" un=
happily, not=20

metaphorically but in sober reality, by reason of their inherent selfishnes=
s, their revengeful=20

natures, their envy and malice. The true student of Magic, well aware of th=
e truth, looks on in pity,=20

and, if he be wise, keeps silent. For every a noose while kneeling on the b=
ed, and made a deep=20

=3DHomicidal=3D hanging is rare but does occur. Where the hands are tied to=
gether; where the injuries=20

produced by the cord are severe; where there are contusions and well-marked=
 ecchymoses;=20

where the laryngeal cartilages and hyoid bone are fractured or the cervical=
 vertebr=C3=A6 dislocated or=20

fractured; or where the carotids are injured or there is hemorrhage into th=
eir walls; where there are=20

ncope; where there=20

are many marks of violence on the body; where there is evidence of a severe=
 struggle=E2=80=94in all=20

these cases murder may be reasonably suspected. The number, situation, exte=
nt, and direction of=20

must be carefully noted and weighed. If these are out of proportion to the =
ligature, the suspension,=20

etc., they strongly suggest homicide, although they may occur in suicide (s=
ee Cases 4, 11, 18, 20,=20

28, 29, 44, 52, 55, 59, 66).  Homicidal hanging may be committed by an assa=
ilant who is strong on=20

a subject who is weak, on a child, a woman, an old person; on one stupefied=
 by liquor or narcotic=20

poison; or by many combined against one person.  Cases are reported where i=
njuries were=20

inflicted or poison given, and the subject was afterward hanged to avert su=
spicion. Most of these=20



cases are those of murder either by strangulation or suffocation (Cases 64,=
 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 74).=20

Sometimes hanging is =3Daccidental=3D. Children and even older persons play=
 at hanging=20

successfully. Taylor mentions the case of a boy who witnessed a hanging and=
 afterward tried the=20

experiment himself to ascertain the sensation, and caused his own death.   =
Tardieu[882] relates=20

the case of a man, T., age 37, of small stature,  feeble constitution, very=
 thin, of sinister face, eyes=20

hollow but  lively, cunning nose and mouth, who meeting a man aged 81, lear=
ned  that he had=20

some trouble with his leg and promised to cure him. The  old man lived alon=
e. T. told him to buy a=20

strong cord as thick as his  little finger and one and one-half yards long,=
 and keep the whole  thing=20

a secret. T. would see him at his room at 7 P.M. The old man  became suspic=
ious and had T.=20

arrested. The investigation showed that  already T. had made away with thre=
e old men by=20

hanging, who were known  to be opposed to suicide. Their bodies showed no t=
race of violence.=20

ften curses, which,=20

unable to reach him, will react on those who wish him evil. Lies and calumn=
y--the latter a teething=20

lie, adding actual bites to empty harmless falsehoods--become his lot, and =
thus the well-wisher is=20

soon torn to pieces, as a reward for his benevolent desire to enlighten.  E=
nough has been given, it=20

is believed, to shew that the existence of a Secret Universal Doctrine, bes=
ides its practical=20

methods of Magic, is no wild romance or fiction. The fact was known to the =
whole ancient world,=20

and the knowledge of it has survived in the East, in India especially. And =
if there be such a=20

Science, there must be naturally, somewhere, professors of it, or Adepts. I=
n any case it matters=20

little whether the Guardians of the Sacred Lore are regarded  Tardieu gives=
 a number of cases of=20

suicidal hanging which were falsely attributed to criminal violence, in whi=
ch the pressure of public=20
