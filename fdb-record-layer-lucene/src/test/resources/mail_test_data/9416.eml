me_; while the miserable proprietor, who had previously been most respectfu=
l, in a truculent=20

manner, and with horrible menaces, claimed a sovereign, and on my declining=
 to comply with his=20

extortionate demand, he actually offered to fight me, me a clergyman of the=
 Church of England.=20

From a sense of justice, I hastened to remunerate those who had been depriv=
ed of their coign of=20

vantage, but, alas! the claimants were innumerable; every man and boy in my=
 vicinity some=20

mysterious process, fall under the influence that his guardian so much drea=
ded and detested.=20

There was, however, a limit to these severe precautions, even before Lothai=
r should reach his=20

majority. His father had expressed in his will that his son should be educa=
ted at the University of=20

Oxford, and at the same college of which he had been a member. His uncle wa=
s of opinion he=20

complied with the spirit of this instruction by sending Lothair to the Univ=
ersity of=20


_
for a place. The mob cheered me with derisive epithets. The climax was reac=
hed when a most=20

offensive policeman in a dictatorial manner ordered me to 'Move on.' The Ch=
urch of England, in=20

my person, was ordered to 'move on.' I attempted to remonstrate, but I and =
the proprietor of the=20

broken bench were both suddenly propelled by the Jack in-office into a bye =
street, and I=20

discovered, to my horror, that I had lost Anastatia. Of course I had to sat=
isfy the ruffian's insolent=20

demands, but I did so under protest. The officer, however, now became more =
civil, and I,=20

fortunately, with his assistance, was able to rescue my sister from the mob=
. I _will_ take another=20

cup of tea, if you please. Thank you, three lumps. I _have_ seen the Lord M=
ayor's Show, never=20

again will I assist at that degrading spectacle."  In vain did Haggard and =
Lord Spunyarn attempt to=20

reassure the indignant vicar. Only on the return of Mrs. Haggard and Lucy d=
id the Reverend John=20

Dodd become comparatively system; and then commenced a celebrated chancery-=
suit, instituted=20

by the Roman Catholic guardian, in order to enforce a literal compliance wi=
th the educational=20

condition of the will. The uncle looked upon this movement as a popish plot=
, and had recourse to=20

every available allegation and argument to baffle it: but ultimately in vai=
n. With every precaution to=20

secure his Protestant principles, and to guard against the influence, or ev=
en personal interference=20

of his Roman Catholic guardian, the lord-chancellor decided that Lothair sh=
ould be sent to=20

Christchurch.  Here Lothair, who had never been favored with a companion of=
 his own age and=20

station, soon found a congenial one in the heir of Brentham. Inseparable in=
 pastime, not=20

dissociated even in study, sympathizing companionship soon ripened into fer=
vent friendship. They=20

lived so much together that the idea of separation became not only painful =
but impossible; and,=20

when vacation arrived, and Brentham was to be visited by its=20


_
beauty, however, the vicar forgot his woes.       CHAPTER VIII.    AT THE C=
ASTLE.   The=20

Haggards were heartily glad to leave town. The nasty scandal at the Pandemo=
nium had been=20

particularly irritating to Haggard personally. "Thank God," he said to hims=
elf, "the head of the=20

family will probably never hear of it, unless Hetton should go out of his w=
ay to tell him; but I don't=20

think he'd do that, he's not too particular himself, so it would be only a =
case of the pot calling the=20

kettle, after all. It wasn't my fault. How could I know the young idiot was=
 drugging himself with=20

Chartreuse? I was too much interested in the game. Besides, some one was bo=
und to have his=20

money sooner or later; in fact," pondered the big man, "I've been rather il=
l-used, when I come to=20

think of it. It's just my luck."  Just his luck! Yes, it was just his luck;=
 just his luck to squander every=20

farthing he possessed, and to be pitied by everybody that Lothair should be=
 a visitor to his=20

domain?       CHAPTER 3 Although Lothair was the possessor of as many palac=
es and castles as=20

the duke himself, it is curious that his first dinner at Brentham was almos=
t his introduction into=20

refined society. He had been a guest at the occasional banquets of his uncl=
e; but these were=20

festivals of the Picts and Scots; rude plenty and coarse splendor, with noi=
se instead of=20

conversation, and a tumult of obstructive defendants, who impeded, by their=
 want of skill, the very=20

convenience which they were purposed to facilitate. How different the surro=
unding scene! A table=20

covered with flowers, bright with fanciful crystal, and porcelain that had =
belonged to sovereigns,=20

who had given a name to its color or its form. As for those present, all se=
emed grace and=20

gentleness, from the radiant daughters of the house to the noiseless attend=
ants that anticipated all=20

his wants, and sometimes=20


_
to do the best he could for himself. Just his luck to have what the America=
ns call a "high-old time"=20

in Mexico, to hunt, to shoot, to enjoy the free wild life and absence of re=
straint in America. Just his=20

luck to thoroughly clear out that wealthy gambler Don Emanuel Garcia, at po=
ker; but then Haggard=20

had all the  Lothair sat between two of the married daughters. They address=
ed him with so much=20

sympathy that he was quite enchanted. When they asked their pretty question=
s and made their=20

sparkling remarks, roses seemed to drop from their lips, and sometimes diam=
onds. It was a rather=20

large party, for the Brentham family were so=20
