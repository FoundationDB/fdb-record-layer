Norah's dying mother, and sat up all night with Mrs. Peele when the girl's strength had given way? 

There were very few indeed whom Norah regarded with so much affection as she did the kind-

hearted Milly.  "Who would have thought of seeing you here in London!" continued Norah, whose 

face was beaming with pleasure. "I have not met you since your marriage. What has brought you 

and your husband up to town?"  "My husband,--don't talk of him!" cried Milly, in a tone of anguish 

which startled Norah. Then looking closer into the face of her friend, Norah could see a sad 

change there. The features of Milly Bligh had grown sharper and thinner; there were furrows on 

her brow which Norah had never seen there before. She observed now, also, what in the 

excitement of first meeting her friend she had not noticed, that the dress of Milly looked shabby: 

though it was winter-time, she wore a thin shawl, which was quite insufficient to protect her from 

the cold.  "Why--what--has he"--a feeling of delicacy prevented Norah from finishing the sentence. 

"_Deserted me!_" moaned Milly, as if to utter these two words was to wring blood from her heart. 

"O Norah, if you knew what I've had to bear! But it's all over now,--I don't know where he is,--I'm 

never like to see him again!"  The street chanced to be very quiet; Milly turned, and, as she walked 

by the side of her friend, in low earnest tones they went on with their conversation.  "Then what 

will you do, my poor dear Milly?" asked Norah, with heartfelt sympathy and pity.  "I must go into 

service again. I've come up to London to look out for a situation. My difficulty is that Mrs. Lane, 

with whom I lived all my years of service, is somewhere abroad, I don't know where, and, as I left 

her to be married, I did not so much as secure a written character from her."  "Oh, I'm so glad!" 

exclaimed Norah, suddenly.  "What,--glad that I've not a corner to turn to?" asked Milly.  "Oh, no, 

not glad of that, but glad that I may be able to help you. Mrs. Lowndes--she's my mistress--asked 

me only this morning if I knew of any nice housemaid who could take Martha's place. My lady had 

nearly fixed on one yesterday, but the character did not suit, so she's in a hurry to find another." 

"Mrs. Lowndes is not likely to take a servant on your recommendation, I should fear."  "You don't 

know what confidence she has in me, what trust she puts in my word," said Norah, with a little 

natural pride. "If I tell her that you have been five years in one place, and that I have known you all 

the time, and that I'm certain that if your mistress were not abroad, she would give you a first-rate 

character, I'm sure--at least I'm almost sure that she'll take you."  "O Norah, you're like a 

comforting angel!" cried poor Milly; "if you only knew what a service you're going to do me! I've 

been almost in despair; half of my clothes are in pawn; I thought that I'd never succeed in getting a 

respectable place!"  "And this is such a good one!" cried Norah, quite excited with pleasure; "and 

how delightful it will be for us both to be always together! A companion whom I could love doors 

and windows. As it was, I was uncomfortable enough. My forehead grew damp, as in the first 

moments of a Turkish bath, and absent mindedly I felt in pocket after pocket for my handkerchief. 

It was not to be found. I must have lost it at the hotel, or the detective's, or in the automobile I had 

hired. In an outside pocket of my coat, however, I chanced upon something for the existence of 

which I couldn't account. It was a very small something: only a bit of paper, but a very neatly 

folded bit of paper, and I remembered how it had fallen from my pocket onto the floor, and a 

gendarme had picked it up.  At ordinary times I should most likely not have given it a second 

thought; but to-night nothing unexpected could be dismissed as insignificant until it had been 

thoroughly examined. I put the paper back, and as I did so I heard Maxine give an exclamation, 

apparently of distress. I could not distinguish all she said, but I thought that I caught the word 



"diamonds." For a moment or two she and du Laurier talked together so excitedly that I might have 

made another attack on the window without great risk; and I was meditating the attempt when 

suddenly the voices ceased. A door opened and shut. There was dead silence, except for a 

footfall overhead, which sounded heavier than Maxine's. Perhaps it was her maid's.  For a few 

seconds more I stood still, awaiting developments, but there was no sound in the next room, and I 

decided to take my chance before it should be too late.  I jerked at the window, which yielded with 

a loud squeak that would certainly have given away the secret of my presence if there had been 

ears to hear. But all was still in the drawing-room adjoining, and I dropped down on to a flower bed 

some few feet below. Then I skirted round to the front of the house, walking stealthily on the soft 

grass, and would have made a noiseless dash for the gate had I not seen a stream of light flowing 

out through the open front door across the lawn. I checked myself just in time to draw back without 

being seen by a woman and a tall man moving slowly down the path. They were Maxine and, no 

doubt, du Laurier. They spoke not a word, but walked with their heads bent, as if deeply absorbed 

in searching for something on the ground. Down to the gate they went, opened it and passed out, 

only half closing it behind them, so that I knew they meant presently to come back again.  I should 

have been thankful to escape, but the chance of meeting them was too imminent. Accordingly I 

waited, and it was well I did, for as they reappeared in three or four minutes they could not have 

gone far enough to be out of sight from the gate.  "There's witchcraft in it," Maxine said, as she 

and her lover passed within a few yards of me, where I hid behind a little arbour.  Du Laurier's 

answer was lost to me, but his voice sounded despondent. Evidently they had mislaid something 

of importance and had small hope of finding it again. I could not help being curious, as well as 

sorry for Maxine that a further misfortune should have befallen her at such a time. But the one and 

only way in which I 


_
wanting to make me perfectly happy, and there is no one on earth whom I should so gladly have 

as my Milly." Norah could hardly refrain from skipping for joy as she walked.  A thought, however, 

occurred to her mind, which somewhat damped her pleasure. "The only thing that makes me 

afraid that you may not get the place," she said, "is that I know that Mrs. Lowndes objects to 

married servants. I have heard her say myself that she will never engage one, the husbands give 

so much trouble."  "I do not even know where mine is," sighed Milly; "but I don't see why anything 

at all need be said about my being married."  Norah became very grave. "Would it be right to hide 

such a fact?" she said; "would it not be like deceiving my mistress?"  "Well, if you're going to let 

out a poor friend's secrets, and deprive her of her best chance of earning her bread in an honest 

way, you're not the girl that I took you for," said Milly, with bitterness.  There is no need to relate all 

the conversation that passed, nor to tell how Milly tried to persuade Norah, and how Norah tried to 

persuade herself, that to suppress the truth was no falsehood; that it was not in the least 

necessary that Mrs. Lowndes should ever know that her housemaid was married. Norah promised 

to do all that she could to procure the situation for Milly, and on reaching home at once went to her 

lady, and pleaded the cause of her friend.  "Five years in one place,--that looks well," observed 

Mrs. Lowndes; "there would at any rate be no harm in my seeing the girl. You have known her, 

you say, all your life. You may tell her to call this evening, and I will judge for myself. It's hard for 

good servants when they lose their places by a mistress going abroad."  Norah knew that Milly 

had not lost her place on account of Mrs. Lane's going abroad, but she was only too glad that her 

lady should think so. We may always suspect that we are in danger of striking against the iceberg 

of deceit, when we allow ourselves to _wish_ something to be believed which we _know_ to be 

quite untrue.  "Stay," said Mrs. Lowndes, as the eager Norah was about to retire from the room; 

"of course your friend is not married?"  Norah was taken by surprise; in an unguarded moment the 

false "no" slipped from her tongue, and she passed through the doorway biting her lip, and 

wishing--fervently wishing that she had not been betrayed, even by friendship, into uttering a lie. 

"But I cannot go back now. Oh, no!" thought the conscience-stricken girl.  Mrs. Lowndes saw Milly 

that evening, liked her appearance and manner, and engaged her as housemaid at once. Norah 

could not feel as happy as she would have done had her mind been at rest, but dared not confess 

her fault, as she deemed that to do so would be cruelly wronging Milly. She resolved to be more 

careful in future; she hoped that this would be the very last time on which she would be guilty of 

speaking untruth. Alas! lies link themselves on one to another like the rings of a chain; and who 

that harbors one unconfessed, unforgiven sin dare hope that it will be _the last_?  Months passed 

quietly over. Norah now seldom thought of her falsehood. If she was colder in prayer, if she was 

less able to lift up her heart to God, if she took less pleasure in recalling the counsels of her uncle, 

she hardly traced these effects to their real cause,--_peace of conscience forfeited by sin_.  One 

morning Norah found Milly in her room weeping violently, and trembling with agitation. An open 

letter lay on her knee.  "What has happened?" cried Norah, anxiously.  "He's found,--my poor, 

poor lost one is found!" sobbed Milly; "but he's in the hospital dying; he wants to see me at once. 

O Norah, I must go to him this day! Ask mistress to give me leave for an hour; she's kind, she'll not 

have the heart to refuse it!"  "Do you wish me to ask her to let you go to the hospital to see your 

_husband_, when she does not know that you have one?" asked Norah, feeling extremely uneasy 

at the idea of her falsehood being found out at last.  "No, no; that would never do, that would get 



us both into trouble, and, oh, I've trouble enough already! Go and ask her to let me go to the 

hospital to visit a dying _mother_."      Oh! what a tangled web we weave,     When once we 

practise to deceive!  Norah found herself now in a position of greater temptation than ever. Milly 

was in such a state of misery and excitement that Norah dreaded that any opposition might throw 

her into a nervous fever. The poor, anxious wife would listen to no objection, had patience for no 

scruple, and was almost wild when Norah showed hesitation about doing her was to get away as 

soon as possible.  They had left the gate unlocked, and I drew in a long breath of relief when I was 

on the other side. I hurried out of the street, lest du Laurier should, by any chance, follow on 

quickly: and my first thought was to go immediately back to my hotel, where Girard might by now 

have arrived with news. I was just ready to hail a cab crawling by at a distance, when I 

remembered the bit of paper I'd found and put back into my pocket. It occurred to me to have a 

look at it, by the light of a street lamp near by; and the instant I had straightened out the small, 

crumpled wad I guessed that here was a link in the mystery.  The paper was a leaf torn from a 

note-book and closely covered on both sides with small, uneven writing done with a sharp black 

pencil. The handwriting was that of an uneducated person, and was strange to me. I could not 

make out the words by the light of the tall lamp, so I lit a wax match from my match-box, and 

protecting the flame in the hollow of my hand, began studying the strange message.  The three 

first words sent my heart up with a bound. "On board the 'Queen.'" I had crossed the Channel in 

the "Queen," and this beginning alone was enough to make me hope that the bit of paper might do 

more than any detective to unravel the mystery.      "I'm taking big risks because I've got to," I read 

on. "It's my     only chance. And if you find this, I bet I can trust you. You're     a gentleman, and 

you saved my life and a lot more besides by     getting into that railway-carriage when the other 

chaps did. The     minute I seen them I thot I was done for, but you stopped there     game. I'm a 

jewler's assistant, carrying property worth     thousands, for my employers. From the first I knew 

'twas bound     to be a ticklish job. On this bote I'm safe, for the villions     who would have 

murdered and robbed me in the train if it hadn't     been for you being there, won't have a chance, 

but when I get to     Paris it will be the worst, and no hope for the jewls, followed     as I am, if I 

hadn't already thot of a plan to save them through     you, an honest gentleman far above 

temptashun. I know who you     are, for I've seen your photo in the papers. So, what I did was 

this: to try a ventriloquist trick which has offen bin of use in     my carere, just as folks were on the 

boat's gangway. Thro'     making that disturbance, and a little skill I have got by doing     amatoor 

conjuring to amuse my wife and famly, I was able to slip     the case of my employer's jewls into 

your breast pocket without     your knowing. And I had to take away what you had in, not that I 

wanted to rob one who had done good by me, but because if I'd     left it the double thickness 

would have surprised you and you     would probably have pulled out my case to see what it was. 

Then     my fat would have bin in the fire, with certin persons looking     on, and you in danger as 

well as me which wouldn't be fare. I've     got your case in my pocket as I write, but I won't open it 

because it may have your sweetart's letters in. You can get your     property again by bringing me 

my master's, which is fare     exchange. I can't call on you, for I don't know where your going 

and daren't hang round to see on account of the danger I run,     and needing to meet a pal of 

mine who will help me. I must get     to him at once, if I am spared to do so, for which reason I 

wrote out this explanashun. The best I can do is to slip it in     your pocket which I shall try when in 



the railway stashun at     Paris. You see how I trust you as a gentleman to bring me the     jewls. 

Come as soon as you can, and get your own case instead,     calling at 218 Rue Fille Sauvage, 

Avenue Morot, back room, top     floor, left of passage. Expressing my gratitood in advance,      "I 

am,      "Yours trustfully,      "J.M. Jeweler's Messenger.      "P.S.--For heaven's sake don't fale, 

and ask the concerge for     name of Gestre."  If it had not been for my rage at not having read this 

illuminating little document earlier, I should have felt like shouting with joy. As it was, my delight 

was tempered with enough of regret to make it easier to restrain myself.  But for the fear that du 

Laurier might be still with Maxine, I should have rushed back to her house for a moment, just long 

enough to give her the good news. But in the circumstances I dared not do it, lest she should 

curse instead of bless me: and besides, as there was still a chance of disappointment, it might be 

better in any case not to raise her hopes until there was no danger of dashing them 


_
was drawn, Norah went to her mistress and told the falsehood put into her mouth by Milly.  Mrs. 

Lowndes was all kindness. Day after day the housemaid was permitted to go and see her sick 

mother, carrying sometimes little delicacies sent from her mistress's table. When Milly, from the 

effect of distress and excitement, herself fell ill, Mrs. Lowndes sent Norah instead of her to the 

hospital two or three times to see "the poor old lady," and questioned her on her return as to the 

sufferer's state. Thus Norah was led deeper and deeper into deceit. She had to speak of _her_ 

illness, _her_ danger, _her_ thanks, when coming from the death-bed of a young man, and she 

felt that her whole character was becoming gradually lowered and degraded. Never since she had 

first sought the Lord had Norah been in so low a spiritual state; even to speak of religion to little 

Selina appeared to her to be an act of hypocrisy now. Norah had sometimes a terrible doubt as to 

whether she had ever been a Christian at all!  Happily for Norah she was suddenly to be stopped 

in this downward path. It was a mercy to be arrested even by a blow.  One afternoon in April the 

bell summoned Norah to the presence of her mistress. She went down the stairs with a sinking at 

the heart, a feeling of misgiving from which she now very frequently suffered. What was her alarm, 

on opening the drawing-room door, to see, seated near her mistress, the chaplain of the hospital, 

whom she had met before on one of her visits to Doyle! Norah dared not even glance at her lady, 

but the sound of that terrible, deep-toned voice, so expressive of subdued indignation, made the 

wretched Norah guess but too well what was coming.  "Mr. Chancie has called to ask me to break 

to my housemaid the news of the death of her _husband_." There was a marked emphasis on the 

last word. "Am I to understand that this is the person whom she, and whom you have visited again 

and again, and spoken of repeatedly to me under the name of her _mother_?"  Norah pressed the 

nails of her right hand so tightly into the flesh of the left that traces were left for days!  "Am I to 

understand," continued the lady, thing was to get the treaty back, without a second of delay. As for 

the detective, who was perhaps waiting for me at the hotel, he would have to wait longer, or even 

go away disgusted--nothing made much difference now. Maybe, when once I had the treaty in my 

hands, I might send a messenger with a few cautious words to Maxine. No matter how late the 

hour, she was certain not to be asleep.  The cab I had seen crawling through the street had 

disappeared long ago, and no other was in sight, so I walked quickly on, hoping to find one 

presently. It was now so late, however, that in this quiet part of Paris no carriages of any sort were 

plying for hire. Finally I made up my mind that I should have to go all the way on foot; but I knew 

the direction of the Avenue Morot, though I'd never heard of Rue de la Fille Sauvage, and as it 

was not more than two miles to walk, I could reach the house I wanted to find in half an hour.  A 

few minutes more or less ought not to matter much, since "J. M." was sure to be awaiting me with 

impatience; therefore the thing which bothered me most was the effect likely to be produced on 

the man when I could not hand him over the diamonds in exchange for the treaty.  Of course I 

didn't believe that "J.M." was a jeweller's messenger, though possibly I might have been less 

incredulous if Maxine had not told me the true history of the diamonds, and what had happened in 

Holland. As it was, I had very little doubt that the rat of a man I had chanced to protect in the 

railway carriage was no other than the extraordinarily expert thief who had relieved du Laurier of 

the Duchess's necklace.  Following out a theory which I worked up as I walked, I thought it 

probable that the fellow had been helped by confederates whom he had contrived to dodge, 

evading them and sneaking off to London in the hope of cheating them out of their share of the 



spoil. Followed by them, dreading their vengeance, I fancied him flitting from one hiding-place to 

another, not daring to separate himself from the jewels; at last determining to escape, disguised, 

from England, where the scent had become too hot; reserving a first-class 


_
terrible tone, "that you and Milly have deliberately conspired together for months to deceive the 

mistress who trusted you?"  Norah wished that she could sink down anywhere out of sight, into the 

cellar, or into the grave.  "You leave this house to-morrow," said the lady, who could not but read 

confession in the silence of her maid, and her aspect of misery and shame. "If your family were in 

London, you should not stay here for another hour. To think that I should have entrusted my child 

to the care of such a"--Norah could not catch the concluding word, perhaps none was uttered, but 

her own conscience supplied the blank with "viper." "Of course you can expect no character from 

me; your vile deceit has done much to shake my faith in all my kind; I shall never trust a servant 

again as you were trusted by me. I could no more answer for your honesty now, wretched girl, 

than I could for your truth. She who could deliberately carry on such a course of deceit would be 

capable of taking my money."  Norah was utterly unable to speak a word in her own defence; she 

was miserable, crushed, almost in despair. and travelling with a golfer's kit; struck with panic at the 

last moment on seeing the very men he fled to avoid, close on his heels, and opening the door of 

his reserved carriage with a railway key.  All this was merely deduction, for so far as I had seen, 

"J.M.'s" travelling companions hadn't even accosted him. Still, the theory accounted for much that 

had been puzzling, and made it plausible that a man should be desperate enough to trust his 

treasure to a stranger (known only through "photos in the newspapers") rather than risk losing it to 

those he had betrayed.  I resolved to use all my powers of diplomacy to extract from "J.M." the 

case containing the treaty before he learned that he was not to receive the diamonds in its place; 

and I had no more than vaguely mapped out a plan of proceeding before I arrived in the Avenue 

Morot. Thence I soon found my way into the Rue de la Fille Sauvage, a mean street, to which the 

queer name seemed not inappropriate. The house I had to visit was an ugly big box of a building, 

with rooms advertised to let, as I could see by the light of a street lamp across 


_
in the same disgrace as herself, though not so hastily sent out of the house. Mrs. Lowndes found it 

more easy to show some indulgence to her, because she had never placed in her the same 

absolute trust; she had never given to Milly the charge of an only, a much-loved child.  Norah 

wrote off a hasty note to her uncle at Colme, and made her preparations for leaving her place with 

an almost bursting heart. One of her keenest pangs was that caused by the distress of little Selina, 

who could not at first be persuaded to believe her dear Norah to be capable of speaking an 

untruth.  "You never did tell a story. Oh, I'm sure that you _could not_! Say, only say that it's all a 

dreadful mistake!" cried the child, bursting into tears.  Norah was too wretched to weep; she did 

not close her eyes all that night; the house in which she had once been so happy had become to 

her now like a stifling prison. Yet she dreaded returning to her native village; she shrank from 

meeting the clear blue eye of her uncle; she felt herself unworthy of any kindness,--she who had 

sinned against light, she who had stained her soul with falsehood! Norah's only comfort was in the 

thought that at least her course of deception was over; she need play the hypocrite no longer; 

prayer was not now a mockery as it had seemed lately to be. Sin is in itself a thing more dreadful 

than the sharpest punishment for sin.     XVI.  Passing Events.   Norah had finished her sad story 

in tears. Neither Ned Franks nor his wife had interrupted the thread of it by a single question; they 

had sat grave and silent listeners. When all had been confessed, the sailor gently laid his hand on 

the shoulder of his sobbing niece. His manner was subdued and kind.  "Norah, my girl," he said, 

"let's be thankful that all was brought to daylight at last. I'd rather have you coming here, even in 

trouble and disgrace, than seeming to prosper in a course so dangerous to your soul. I only wish 

that your lady had known all through your own confession, instead of--but let that pass; I trust and 

believe that henceforth you will always be true as steel, and avoid the slightest approach to deceit 

all the more carefully because of your sufferings now. I need not say that we will never mention 

the subject to you again; you are heartily welcome to stay here as long as you will; you'll live, 

please God, to be a comfort and credit to us yet."  Of course there was much gossip in the village 

as to the cause of Norah's sudden return. There was a succession of visitors to the school-house 

on the following day. Many questions were put to Ned Franks and Persis, by those who were more 

curious the lines of shut windows behind narrow iron balconies.  The large double doors, from 

which the paint had peeled in patches, were closed, but I rang the bell for the concierge; and after 

a delay of several minutes I heard a slight click which meant that the doors had opened for me. I 

passed into a dim lobby, to be challenged by a sleepy voice behind a half open window. The 

owner of the voice kept himself invisible and was no doubt in the bunk which he called his bed. 

Only a stern sense of duty as concierge woke him up enough to demand, mechanically, who it 

was that the strange monsieur desired to visit at this late hour?  I replied according to instructions. 

I wished to see Monsieur Gestre.  "Monsieur Gestre is away," murmured the voice behind the little 

window.  I thought quickly. Gestre was probably the "pal" whom "J.M." had been in such a hurry to 

find. "Very well," said I, "I'll see his friend, the Englishman who arrived this evening. I have an 

appointment with him."  "Ah, I understand. I remember. Is it not that Monsieur has been here 

already? He now returns, as he mentioned that he might do?"  Again my thoughts made haste to 

arrange themselves. The "monsieur" who had called had probably also arrived late, after the 

concierge had gone to bed in his dim box, and become too drowsy to notice such details as the 

difference between voices, especially if they were those of foreigners. Perhaps if I explained that I 



was not the person who had said he would come again, but another, the man behind the window 

would consider me a complication, and refuse to let me pass at such an hour without a fuss. And 

of all things, a fuss was what I least wanted--for Maxine's sake, and because of the treaty. I 

decided to seize upon the advantage that was offered me.  "Quite right," I said shortly. "I know the 

way." And so began to mount the stairs. Flight after flight I went up, meeting no one; and on the 

fifth floor I found that I had reached the top of the house. There were no more stairs to go up.  On 

each of the floors below there had been a dim light--a jet of gas turned low. But the fifth floor was 

in darkness. Someone had put out the light, either in carelessness or for some special reason. 

There were several doors on each side of the passage, but I could not be sure that I had reached 

the right one until I'd lighted a match. When I was sure, I knocked, but no answer came.  "He can't 

be out," I said to myself, cheerfully. "He's got tired of waiting and dropped asleep, that's all."  I 

knocked again. Silence. And then for a third time, loudly, keeping on until I was sure that, if there 

were anyone in the room, no 


_
cause of Norah's so unexpectedly leaving her place. Both husband and wife maintained a resolute 

silence; they made no evasions, threw out no hints to mislead.  "People need not trouble 

themselves about my niece's concerns," was Ned's rather impatient remark when hard pressed for 

an answer to some impertinent question. "She has come to us for quiet and peace, sound asleep, 

I must have waked him.  After all, he had gone out, but perhaps only for a short time. Surely, he 

would soon come back, lest he should miss the keeper of the diamonds.  I had very little hope 

that, even on the chance of my arriving while he was away, he would have left the door open. 

Nevertheless I tried the handle, and to my surprise it yielded. 


_
one shall annoy her whilst she is under my roof."  Of course curiosity was not satisfied nor gossip 

silenced in Colme. Some of the neighbors guessed that Norah had done something very foolish or 

wrong; some that she had had a disappointment in love; but as no one had the means of proving 

the truth of his guesses, it might be hoped that curiosity would at last die out like a fire unsupplied 

with fuel. To be exposed to painful remarks, to be viewed with some suspicion, was the heavy but 

just  "That must be because the lock's broken and only a bolt remains," I thought. "So he had to 

take the risk. All the better. This looks as if he'd be back any minute. He wouldn't like giving the
