On July 6, 1839, a weekly publication was begun in Manila entitled, Precios=
 corrientes de Manila=20

[i.e., "Prices current at Manila"], [32] in the Spanish and English languag=
es. A royal decree of=20

October 4, 1839, provided for the introduction and circulation of books in =
the islands; the fiscal=20

must designate those that merited examination, and then they must be passed=
 upon by two=20

censors, appointed by the governor and the archbishop respectively, whose o=

 ON THEIR=20

CAPITAL MANILA,  1819 to 1822   ADVERTISEMENT  The following remarks are dr=
awn up by=20

one but little accustomed to writing, and offered with much diffidence. In =
them the Spanish=20

character will be found perhaps severely treated; but it is necessary to re=
mark, that not only these=20

observations are, from their very nature, general; but farther, that they h=
ave no reference to the=20

genuine or European Spanish character--a character of which the writer has =
but little knowledge,=20

and one as essentially different from that which falls under consideration =
in the following pages, as=20

the society of all convict colonies is from that of the mother country. [34=
]      PART I  THE=20

PHILLIPPINES  Of the numerous groupes of islands which constitute the marit=
ime division of Asia,=20

the Phillippines, in situation, riches, fertility, and salubrity, are equal=
 or superior to any. Nature has=20

here revelled in all that poets or painters have thought or dreamt of unbou=
nded luxuriance of=20

Asiatic scenery. The lofty chains of mountains--the rich and extensive slop=
es which form their=20

bases--the ever-varying change of forest and savannah--of rivers and lakes-=
-the yet blazing=20

volcanoes in the midst of forests, and fifty degrees.  Even if it be conced=
ed that the material of the=20

earth is a molten mass, there would be two theories to explain it: one, tha=
t the earth was originally=20

in a state of fusion, and was slowly cooling; the other, that the great pre=
ssure from without keeps=20

an otherwise solid center greatly compressed and heated, and consequently l=
iquid. Either=20

supposition is based on well established facts; but it does not appear clea=
r that the molten globe=20



with a cool shell can settle the entire question.  The objections to this a=
re several. One, the=20

complete absence of uniformity in the increase of heat as we descend. While=
 the total average is=20

as given above, the variations are so many and vast, that there does not se=
em to be any general=20

law, as there should be if the molten interior possessed the least uniformi=
ty. In some shafts the=20

increase is one degree for twenty feet; in others, one for every one hundre=
d; in some, the=20

temperature increases much more rapidly at great depths, in others, much le=
ss rapidly.  A second=20

objection is, the vast difference in the character of lavas, even in distri=
cts very near each other.=20

Thirdly, there seems no definite connection between volcanoes in the same r=
egion. Two adjacent=20

ones may exhibit very different conditions. Mauna Loa is about 10,000 feet =
above Kilauea, a great=20

crater of the same mountain. Yet the upper is often in a violent state of e=
ruption when the latter is=20

perfectly quiet. It would be difficult to conceive how these are supplied f=
rom the same source. If=20

the interior were a molten mass in a state of equilibrium, as would be nece=
ssary if the uniformity of=20

its motions in the solar system were to be preserved, any undue pressure wo=
uld compel the=20

molten matter to escape from the lowest opening. This would be in accordanc=
e with the simplest=20

laws of liquids. Then we should find volcanic action most vigorous at the l=
owest active volcano; but=20

such is not the case. The idea of a uniformly liquid interior seems hardly =
tenable.  There is still=20

other objection to this theory. Experiments have been made with various mat=
erials to ascertain the=20

change affected in them by heat. It is found that a block of granite five f=
eet long, by a change of=20

ninety-six degrees in temperature, is expanded .27792 of an inch; crystalli=
ne marble, .03264;=20

sandstone, .0549. If, then, a portion of the earth=E2=80=99s crust ten mile=
s in thickness be heated six=20

hundred degrees, its crust would be raised two hundred feet; or a change of=
 one degree, the rate=20

of expansion being fairly uniform to five hundred or six hundred degrees, w=
ould raise the surface=20

four inches. How important this matter is may be better understood when we =
consider that if the=20

interior of the earth be a uniformly molten mass, with a crust ten miles th=
ick, a contraction of one-

twelve thousandth of an inch should force out of the crust a cubic mile of =
lava. We should find then=20

a change in temperature one forty-eight thousandth of a degree should effec=
t this, if the crust were=20

ten miles thick.  We are then forced to conclude that the earth is not cool=
ing to any appreciable=20

extent; or that the liquid interior is still capable of indefinite compress=
ion without necessarily being=20

forced out through orifices in the crust; or that the interior is not a uni=
formly molten mass.  Such=20

are the arguments against a melted interior.  The reader should avoid the a=
ssumption of a uniform=20

rate of contraction or expansion of heat. Within very narrow limits, such a=
 hypothesis may be=20

allowed; but to assume that it is universal, would be to affirm that if you=
 could only make the=20


_
stamp her work with the mighty emblems of her creative and destroying power=
s. Java alone can=20

compete with them in fertility; but in riches, extent, situation, and polit=
ical importance, it is far=20

inferior.  Their position, whether in a political or commercial point of vi=
ew, is at all! The earth and=20

the temperature would swallow each other, like the two snakes, till neither=
 was left. To illustrate=20

more seriously, suppose a race of men existed whose only experience of temp=
erature ranged=20

between forty and two hundred degrees. They could consistently=20


_
the west and south, the islands of the fertile Pacific and the rising empir=
es of the new world on the=20

east, the vast market of China at their doors, their insular position and n=
umerous rivers affording a=20

facility of communication and defence to every part of them, an active and =
industrious population,=20

climates of almost all varieties, a soil so fertile in vegetable and minera=
l productions as almost to=20

exceed credibility; the require a temperature of many thousands of degrees =
to expand it to=20

seventeen hundred times its bulk. Yet we know they would have to raise it o=
nly to two hundred=20

and twelve degrees to produce the required effect. And if they could go bel=
ow forty degrees, they=20

would be astonished to find that water then expanded instead of contracting=
.  That the earth, if it=20

cools, does so very slowly is clear, from the character of the materials th=
rown=20
