their streaming fiercely forth, as if cloven from some solid block of fire, their swift course, and their 

instantaneous extinction.  The range and effects of the storm, too, are vividly painted. It is first "on 

the waters," which may possibly mean the Mediterranean, but more probably, "the waters that are 

above the firmament," and so depicts the clouds as gathering high in air. Then it comes down with 

a crash on the northern mountains, splintering the gnarled cedars, and making Lebanon rock with 

all its woods--leaping across the deep valley of Coelo-Syria, and smiting Hermon (for which Sirion 

is a Sidonian name), the crest of the Anti Lebanon, till it reels. Onward it sweeps--or rather, 

perhaps, it is all around the psalmist; and even while he hears the voice rolling from the furthest 

north, the extreme south echoes the roar. The awful voice shakes[E] the wilderness, as it booms 

across its level surface. As far south as Kadesh other."  Spiffy's face flushed, for if he had lost the 

conscience, he still retained the consciousness, of a gentleman, and he felt the reproach.  Just at 

this moment, Mr Wog, who had been elected an honorary member of the "Piccadilly," and was 

standing, unconsciously to us, listening to our conversation, struck in, and averted the retort which 

was rising to Spiffy's lips.  "I guess," he said, turning to Spiffy, for whose talents he evidently 

entertained a high admiration, "that I could give you a few hints, from my own experiences in New 

York, that might help you in your line of business. My own, sir, in that city, was quite similar to 

yours in this. You operate at night in Mayfair, and by day 'On 'Change.' Well, sir, I had two spheres 

of operation, one was on Wall Street, and the other on Fifth Avenue. In fact, I may say that Wall 

Street is the broad and flowery road that leads to Fifth Avenue. The trouble with operators in this

spreads, and away in the forests of Edom the wild creatures in their terror slip their calves, and the 

oaks are scathed and stripped of their leafy honours. And all the while, like a mighty diapason 

sounding on through the tumult, the voice of the sons of God in the heavenly temple is heard 

proclaiming "Glory!"  [E] Delitzsch would render "whirls in circles"--a picturesque allusion to the 

sand pillars which accompany storms in the desert.  The psalm closes with lofty words of 

confidence, built on the story of the past, as well as on the contemplation of the present. "Jehovah 

sat throned for (_i.e._, to send on earth) the flood" which once drowned the world scale. Now the 

first thing I did when I went to do business in New York, was to keep a judge."  "To keep a judge?" 

said Spiffy with amazement.  "Why, yes. How can you operate freely if you are afraid of the law? 

Besides his regular monthly allowance, my judge gets a percentage on every one of my financial 

enterprises which are fraudulent according to the letter of the statute. Then it costs me a good deal 

to manage to get all my lawsuits tried in his court. Besides, I have to keep a number of members 

of both the Houses of the Legislature at Albany regularly retained, and to put a big pile on one side 

for lobby operations at Washington, to say nothing about
