explained a phenomenon, which rather startled us, near Kew. We saw about ha=
lf-a-dozen cows=20

galloping furiously towards the river's brink; flirting their tails, and, i=
ndeed, conducting themselves=20

with a vivacity perfectly inconsistent with the acknowledged sobriety of th=
at useful animal. He=20

calmed our apprehensions, by informing us they were intended for the East I=
ndies. Every other=20

day they are fed with best rock-salt, instead of green-meat; which, by chem=
ical agency, renders=20

them fat and fit to be killed, and sent on ship-board at a moment's notice;=
 the trouble and delay of=20

salting down being totally unnecessary. These cows, he assured us, had just=
 finished their thirst-

inducing meal.  Near Hill's boat-shed is the patent Philanthropical Hay-tos=
ser, a stupendous=20

machine, invented expressly to prevent the degradation and slavery to which=
 thousands of our=20

fellow men are subjected during hay-harvest. It must gratify every friend t=
o the amelioration of his=20

species to learn, that the humane intention of the inventer is likely to be=
 realized, as there are=20

already three thousand Irishmen out of employ.  Here we must halt with our =
tourist. The result of=20

*   CLASSICAL CORRECTIONS.     In a neat little cottage, some five miles fr=
om town,   Lived a=20

pretty young maiden, by name Daphne Brown,     Like a butterfly, pretty and=
 airy:   In a village hard=20

by lived a medical prig,   With a rubicund nose, and a full-bottomed wig,  =
   Apollo, the apothecary.=20

He, being crop sick of his bachelor life,   Resolved, in his old days, to l=
ook for a wife--     (_Nota=20

bene_--Thank Heaven, I'm not married):   He envied his neighbours their cur=
ly-poled brats,   (All=20

swarming, as if in a village of Pats,)     And sighed that so long he had t=
arried.    Having heard of=20

fair Daphne, the village coquette,   As women to splendour were never blind=
 yet,     He resolved=20

with his grandeur to strike her;   So he bought a new buggy, where, girt in=
 a wreath,   Were his=20

arms, pills, and pestle--this motto beneath--     _"Ego opifer per orbem di=
cor."_    To the village he=20

drove, sought young Daphne's old sire,   Counted gold by rouleaus, and bank=
 notes by the quire,=20

And promised the old buck a share in't,   If his daughter he'd give--for th=
e amorous fool   Thought=20

of young ladies' hearts and affections the rule     Apparently rests with a=
 parent.    Alas! his old=20

mouth may long water in vain,   Who tries by this method a mistress to gain=
--     A _miss_ is the=20

sure termination:   For a maiden's delight is to plague the old boy,   And =
to think sixty-five not the=20

period for joy;     Alas! all the sex are vexation.    Daphne Brown had two=
 eyes with the tenderest=20

glances!   Her brain had been tickled by reading romances,     And those co=
mpounds of nonsense=20

called novels,   Where Augustus and Ellen, or fair Isabel,   With Romeo, in=
 sweet little cottages=20

dwell:    _Sed meo periclo_, read hovels.    She danger is from another lan=
d. But there will be no=20

peril if we are prompt and firm. Clear your mind of all these dark feelings=
 about the =E2=80=98Madre Natura.=E2=80=99=20

All that we require is that the most powerful and the most secret associati=
on in Europe should=20

ratify what the local societies of France have already intimated. It will b=
e enough. Send for=20

Colonna, and leave the rest to me.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 54 The =E2=80=9CM=
adre Natura=E2=80=9D is the oldest, the most=20

powerful, and the most occult, of the secret societies of Italy. Its mythic=
 origin reaches the era of=20

paganism, and it is not impossible that it may have been founded by some of=
 the despoiled=20

professors of the ancient faith. As time advanced, the brotherhood assumed =
many outward forms,=20

according to the varying spirit of the age: sometimes they were freemasons,=
 sometimes they were=20



soldiers, sometimes artists, sometimes men of letters. But whether their ex=
ternal representation=20

were a lodge, a commandery, a studio, or an academy, their inward purpose w=
as ever the same;=20

and that was to cherish the memory, and, if possible, to secure the restora=
tion of the Roman=20

Republic, and to expel from the Aryan settlement of Romulus the creeds and =
sovereignty of what=20

they styled the Semitic invasion.  The =E2=80=9CMadre Natura=E2=80=9D have =
a tradition that one of the most=20

celebrated of the popes was admitted to their fraternity as Cardinal del Me=
dici, and that when he=20

ascended the throne, mainly through their labors, he was called upon to coo=
perate in the fulfilment=20

of the great idea. An individual who, in his youth, has been the member of =
a secret society, and=20

subsequently ascends a throne, may find himself in an embarrassing position=
. This, however,=20

according to the tradition, which there is some documentary ground to accre=
dit, was not the=20

perplexing lot of his holiness Pope Leo X. His tastes and convictions were =
in entire unison with his=20

early engagements, and it is believed that he took an early and no unwillin=
g opportunity of=20

submitting to the conclave a proposition to consider whether it were not bo=
th expedient and=20

practicable to return to the ancient faith, for which their temples had bee=
n originally erected.  The=20

chief tenet of the society of =E2=80=9CMadre Natura=E2=80=9D is denoted by =
its name. They could conceive nothing=20

more benignant and more beautiful, more provident and more powerful, more e=
ssentially divine,=20

than that system of creative order to which they owed their being, and in w=
hich it was their=20

privilege to exist. But they differed from other schools of philosophy that=
 have held this faith, in this=20

singular particular: they recognize the inability of the Latin race to purs=
ue the worship of Nature in=20

an abstract spirit, and they desired to revive those exquisite personificat=
ions of the abounding=20

qualities of the mighty mother which the Aryan genius had bequeathed to the=
 admiration of man.=20

Parthenope was again to rule at Naples instead of Januarius, and starveling=
 saints and winking=20

madonnas were to restore their usurped altars to the god of the silver bow =
and the radiant=20

daughter of the foaming wave.  Although the society of =E2=80=9CMadre Natur=
a=E2=80=9D themselves accepted the=20

allegorical interpretation which the Neo-Platonists had placed upon the pag=
an creeds during the=20

first ages of Christianity, they could not suppose that the populace could =
ever comprehend an=20


_
Knew the raptures of Werter and Charlotte by rote;     Thought Smith and Si=
r Walter ecstatic;   And=20

as for the novels of Miss Lefanu,   She dog's-eared them till the whole twe=
nty looked blue;     And=20

studied 'The Monk' in the attic.    When her sire introduced our Apollo, he=
 found   The maiden in=20

torrents of sympathy drowned--     "Floods of tears" is too trite and too c=
ommon:   Her eyes were=20

quite swelled--her lips pouting and pale;   For she just had been reading t=
hat heartbreaking tale,=20

"Annabelle, or the Sufferings of Woman."    Apollo, I'll swear, had more co=
urage than I,   To accost=20

a young maid with a _drop in her eye_;     I'd as soon catch a snake or a v=
iper:   She, while wiping=20

her tears, gives Apollo some wipes;   And when a young lady has set up her =
pipes,     Her lover=20

will soon pay the piper.    Papa locked her up--but the very next night,   =
With a cornet of horse, the=20

young lady took flight;     To Apollo she left this apology--   "That, were=
 she to spend with an old=20

man her life,   She would gain, by the penance she'd bear as a wife,     A =
place in the next=20

martyrology."    Apollo gave chase, but was destined to fail;   The female =
had safely been lodged=20

in the mail,     Now flying full speed to the borders;   So the doctor, com=
pelled his sad fate to=20

endure,   Came back to his shop, commissioned to cure     All disorders but=
 Cupid's disorders.=20

_Monthly Magazine._          *       *       *       *       *  BAMBOROUGH =
CASTLE.  The origin of this=20

princely establishment may be new to our readers:--One of the owners of the=
 castle, John Forster,=20

member for Northumberland, having joined in the rebellion, and being genera=
l of the English part=20

of the rebel army, of course his estates, then valued at 1,314 _l_. _per an=
num_, were forfeited;=20

Crewe, bishop of Durham, purchased them from the government commissioners, =
and settled the=20

whole, by his will, on charitable uses. Under a clause which left the resid=
ue of the rents to such=20

charitable uses as his trustees might appoint, the "princely establishment =
of Bamborough" has=20

arisen--where    "Charity hath fixed her chosen seat;     And Pity, at the =
dark and stormy hour   Of=20

midnight, when the moon is hid on high,     Keeps her love watch upon the t=
opmost tower,   And=20

turns her ear to each expiring cry,     Blest if her aid some refined, not =
to say so fanciful. They=20

guarded, therefore, against the corruptions and abuses of the religion of N=
ature by the entire=20

abolition of the priestly order, and in the principle that every man should=
 be his own priest they=20

believed they had found the necessary security.  As it was evident that the=
 arrest of Garibaldi=20

could not be kept secret, the general thought it most prudent to be himself=
 the herald of its=20

occurrence, which he announced to the troops in a manner as little discoura=
ging as he could=20

devise. It was difficult to extenuate the consequences of so great a blow, =
but they were assured=20

that it was not a catastrophe, and would not in the slightest degree affect=
 the execution of the=20

plans previously resolved on. Two or three days later some increase of conf=
idence was=20

occasioned by the authentic intelligence that Garibaldi had been removed fr=
om his stern=20

imprisonment at Alessandria, and conveyed to his island-home, Caprera, thou=
gh still a prisoner.=20

About this time, the general said to Lothair: =E2=80=9CMy secretary has occ=
asion to go on an expedition. I=20

shall send a small detachment of cavalry with her, and you will be at its h=
ead. She has requested=20

that her husband should have this office, but that is impossible; I cannot =
spare my best officer. It is=20

your first command, and, though I hope it will involve no great difficulty,=
 there is no command that=20

does not require courage and discretion. The distance is not very great, an=
d so long as you are in=20

the mountains you will probably be safe; but in leaving this range and gain=
ing the southern=20

Apennines, which is your point of arrival, you will have to cross the open =
country. I do not hear the=20

Papalini are in force there; I believe they have concentrated themselves at=
 Rome, and about=20



Viterbo. If you meet any scouts and reconnoitring parties, you will be able=
 to give a good account=20

of them, and probably they will be as little anxious to encounter you as yo=
u to meet them. But we=20

must be prepared for every thing, and you may be threatened by the enemy in=
 force; in that case=20

you will cross the Italian frontier, in the immediate neighborhood of which=
 you will keep during the=20

passage of the open country, and surrender yourselves and your arms to the =
authorities. They will=20

not be very severe; but, at whatever cost and whatever may be the odds,=20


_
And snatch him, cold and speechless, from the grave."  BOWLES.   The charit=
able intentions of a=20

testator have never, in any instance, been better fulfilled than this; the =
residuary rents, owing to=20

the great increase of rental in the Forster estates, became considerably th=
e most important part of=20

the bequest; and the trustees, who are restricted to five in number, all cl=
ergymen, and of whom the=20

rector of Lincoln College is always one, being unfettered by any positive r=
egulations, have so=20

discharged their trust as to render Bamborough Castle the most extensively =
useful, as well as the=20

most munificent, of all our eleemosynary institutions. There are two free-s=
chools there, both on the=20

Madras system, one for boys, the other for girls; and thirty of the poorest=
 girls are clothed, lodged,=20

and boarded, till, at the age of sixteen, they are put out to service, with=
 a good stock of clothing,=20

and a present of 2_l_. 12_s_. 6_d_. each; and at the end of the first year,=
 if the girl has behaved=20

well, another guinea is given her, with a Bible, a Prayer-book, the Whole D=
uty of Man, and=20

Secker's Lectures on the Catechism. There is a library in the castle, to wh=
ich Dr. Sharp, one of the=20

trustees, bequeathed, in 1792, the whole of his own collection, valued at m=
ore than 800_l_.; the=20

books are lent gratuitously to any householder, of good report, residing wi=
thin twenty miles of=20

Bamborough, and to any clergyman, Roman Catholic priest, or dissenting mini=
ster within the said=20

distance. There is an infirmary also in the castle, of which the average to=
-morrow at dawn.=E2=80=9D  There=20

is nothing so animating, so invigorating alike to the body and soul, so tru=
ly delicious, as travelling=20

among mountains in the early hours of day. The freshness of Nature falls up=
on a responsive=20

frame, and the nobility of the scene discards the petty thoughts that peste=
r ordinary life. So felt=20

Captain Muriel, as with every military precaution he conducted his little t=
roop and his precious=20

charge among the winding passes of the Apennines; at first dim in the matin=
 twilight, then soft with=20

incipient day, then coruscating with golden flashes. Sometimes they descend=
ed from the austere=20

heights into the sylvan intricacies of chestnut-forests, amid the rush of w=
aters and the fragrant stir=20

of ancient trees; and, then again ascending to lofty summits, ranges of int=
erminable hills, gray or=20

green, expanded before them, with ever and anon a glimpse of plains, and so=
metimes the=20

splendor and the odor of the sea.  Theodora rode a mule, which had been pre=
sented to the=20

general by some admirer. It was an animal of remarkable beauty and intellig=
ence, perfectly aware,=20

apparently, of the importance of its present trust, and proud of its rich a=
ccoutrements, its padded=20

saddle of crimson velvet, and its silver bells. A couple of troopers formed=
 the advanced guard, and=20

the same number at a certain distance furnished the rear. The body of the d=
etachment, fifteen=20

strong, with the sumpter-mules, generally followed Theodora, by whose side,=
 whenever the way=20

permitted, rode their commander. Since he left England Lothair had never be=
en so=20


_
in-patients is about thirty-five--of out-patients above one thousand. There=
 is an ample granary,=20

from whence, in time of scarcity, the poor are supplied on low terms. Twice=
 a week the poor are=20

supplied with meal, at reduced prices, and with groceries at prime cost; an=
d the average number=20

of persons who partake this benefit is about one thousand three hundred in =
ordinary times, in=20

years of scarcity very many more. To sailors on that perilous coast Bamboro=
ugh Castle is what the=20

Convent of St. Bernard is to travellers in the Alps. Thirty beds are kept f=
or shipwrecked sailors; a=20

patrol for above eight miles (being the length of the manor) is kept along =
the coast every stormy=20

night; signals are made; a life-boat is in readiness at Holy Island, and ap=
paratus of every kind is=20

ready for assisting seamen in distress;--wrecked goods are secured Theodora=
. What struck him=20

most now, as indeed previously at the camp, was that she never alluded to t=
he past. For her there=20

would seem to be no Muriel Towers, no Belmont, no England. You would have s=
upposed that she=20

had been born in the Apennines and had never quitted them. All her conversa=
tion was details,=20

political or military. Not that her manner was changed to Lothair. It was n=
ot only as kind as before,=20

but it was sometimes unusually and even unnecessary tender, as if she repro=
ached herself for the=20

too frequent and too evident self-engrossment of her thoughts, and wished t=
o intimate to him that,=20

though her brain were absorbed, her heart was still gentle and true.  Two h=
ours after noon they=20

halted in a green nook, near a beautiful cascade that descended in a mist d=
own a sylvan cleft, and=20

poured its pellucid stream, for their=20
