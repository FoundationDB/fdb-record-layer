nder as the boys were getting ready to retire. "I'll see to filling the wat=
er tanks, and the grub you ordered in advance is here. I'll stack it in the=
 wagon, and we'll start off as soon as it's daylight. I've got good horses =

istian wife, and seven lovely children. I do not know if it is true, but I =
hear that all He gets in return is cursing and blasphemy." He said, "Come i=
n; come in." I went in. "Now," he said, "what you said out there is true. I=
f any man has a fine wife I am the man, and I have a lovely family of child=
ren, and God has been good to me. But do you know, we had company here the =
other night, dracaena marginata hotel.  "We'll start early in the morning,"=
 said Mr. Blender as the boys were getting ready to retire. "I'll see to fi=
lling the water tanks, and the grub you ordered in advance is here. I'll st=
ack it in the wagon, and we'll start off as soon as it's daylight. I've got=
 good horses for us all."  "Horses? Are we going to ride horses?" asked Sam=
.  "Of course, from now on," replied Jack. "Didn't I tell you?"  wealth, a =
beautiful Christian wife, and seven lovely children. I do not know if it is=
 true, but I hear that all He gets in return is cursing and blasphemy." He =
said, "Come in; come in." I went in. "Now," he said, "what you said out the=
re is true. If any man has a fine wife I am the man, and I have a lovely fa=
mily of children, and God has been good to me. But do you know, we had comp=
any here the other night, _
pitched sideways over the edge of the wagon, which at that moment was on a =
narrow part of the=20

road, skirting a big cliff. On one side the rock rose sheer like a wall. On=
 the other there was a=20

precipice, dropping away for a hundred feet or more.  Mabel could not repre=
ss a scream as she=20

felt herself tossed out of the wagon, and she threw her hands upward, vainl=
y clutching for=20

something to cling to. Her father turned and saw her. He prepared to leap b=
ackward to her aid, but=20

he could not have done it.  But Jack saw what had happened. His end of the =
seat was elevated, as=20

the other was depressed, and, taking in the situation at a glance, he made =
a spring toward the girl,=20

and clasped her about the waist just in time to prevent her falling out.  H=
e braced himself against=20

the edge of the wagon, and held on with all his strength, for the girl was =
no lightweight, and the=20

swaying of the vehicle threatened to toss them both out.  By this time Mr. =
Pierce had left his seat=20

beside Tanker Ike, who was  You would smile at and deride such a statement.=
  Ah, friends! You=20

cannot trifle with God in that way. Even if you swear without meaning it, i=
t is forbidden by God.=20

Christ said: "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an acco=
unt thereof in the day of=20

judgment; for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou s=
halt be condemned."=20

You will be held accountable whether your words are _idle_ or _blasphemous_=
.  A SENSELESS=20

HABIT.  The habit of swearing is condemned by all sensible persons. It has =
been called "the most=20

gratuitous of all sins," because no one gains by it; it is "not only sinful=
, but useless." An old writer=20

said that when the accusing angel, who records men's words, flies up to hea=
ven with an oath, he=20

blushes as he hands it in.  When a man blasphemes, he shows an utter contem=
pt for God. I was in=20

the army during the war, and heard men cursing and swearing. Some godly wom=
an would pass=20

along the ranks looking for her wounded son, and not an oath would=20


_
in the storm, and Mabel's father came to the aid of her and Jack.  "I've go=
t her!" Jack managed to=20

gasp.  "So I see!" cried Mr. Pierce, and then, lending his strength to that=
 of our hero, he pulled=20

Mabel safely within the wagon.  "That--that was a narrow squeak," commented=
 Mr. Pierce, when=20

Mabel, pale and gasping from fright, had been assisted to the seat, which w=
as replaced and=20

braced up after a fashion.  "Rather," admitted Jack with a smile.  "You sav=
ed her life, Ranger,"=20

went on Mr. Pierce, and there was a husky note in his voice. "She's--she's =
all I've got, and--and--I=20

don't know how to thank you. If she'd gone over the edge there--well, I don=
't like to talk about it."=20

"Oh, if I hadn't grabbed her some one else would," said Jack modestly.  Mab=
el did not say much,=20

but mothers, or their wives, or their sisters; they had more respect for th=
em than they had for God!=20

Isn't it a terrible condemnation that swearing held its own until it came t=
o be recognized as a vulgar=20

thing, a sin against society? Men dropped it then, who never thought of its=
 being a sin against=20

God.  There will be no swearing men in the kingdom of God. They will have t=
o drop that sin, and=20

repent of it, before they see the kingdom of God.  HOW TO KEEP FROM SWEARIN=
G.  Men often=20

ask: "How can I keep from swearing?" I will tell you. If God puts His love =
into your heart, you will=20

have no desire to curse Him. If you have much regard for God, you will no m=
ore think of cursing=20

Him than you would think of speaking lightly or disparagingly of a mother w=
hom you love. But the=20

natural=20


_
more than repaid him.  The excitement caused by the second accident calmed =
down, and then the=20

occupants of the wagon had time to notice that the progress of the vehicle =
was slower. The road=20

was not so steep, and a little later Tanker Ike guided his horses to a comp=
aratively level stretch.=20

The snow squall, too, suddenly ceased.  "Well," remarked the driver slowly =
as he halted the team=20

and got out to repair the broken brake, "I don't want a thing like that to =
happen again. I wanted to=20

help you, Mabel, but I didn't dare leave the horses."  "I--I was helped in =
time," answered the girl=20

with a little blush.  "Guess we'll wait for the freight wagon," went on Tan=
ker Ike. "Then I'll fix things=20

up and we'll go on. There's no more utter contempt for His law. When that l=
aw is written on his=20

heart, there will be no trouble in obeying it.  When I was out west about t=
hirty years ago, I was=20

preaching one day in the open air, when a man drove up in a fine turn-out, =
and after listening a=20

little while to what I was saying, he put the whip to his fine-looking Stee=
d, and away he went. I=20

never expected to see him again, but the next night he came back, and he ke=
pt on coming=20

regularly night after night.  I noticed that his forehead itched--you have =
noticed people who keep=20

putting their hands to their foreheads?--he didn't want any one to see him =
shedding tears--of=20

course not! It is not a manly thing to shed tears in a religions meeting, o=
f course!  After the=20


_
We're over the worst part of the road."  Mexican Pete, who drove the freigh=
ter, soon came up, he=20

having had no mishap on the trip down. The three men soon mended the broken=
 brake, and the=20

journey was resumed. That night they arrived at the stage station, which ma=
rked the beginning of=20

the two days' trip over the desert. It was here that Mr. Pierce and his dau=
ghter were to leave the=20

boys, to go on a different route.  "Now don't you young fellows forget to c=
ome to Pryor's Gap if you=20

get a chance," commanded Mr. Pierce. "My daughter and I will be there in a =
few weeks, after I do=20

a little more visiting. You can get there from where you are going to hunt =
without crossing this=20

desert, though it's rather a long, roundabout way. But I hope I'll see you =
again."  "Yes, try to=20

come," added Mabel as she shook hands with the boys, Jack last of all.  Was=
 it fancy, up here=20

every night? Is he interested?" "Interested! I should think not! You should=
 have heard the way he=20

talked about you today." "Well," I said, "that is a sign he is interested."=
  If no man ever has=20

anything to say against you, your Christianity isn't worth much. Men said o=
f the Master, "He has a=20

devil," and Jesus said that if they had called the master of the house Beel=
zebub, how much more=20

them of his household.  I asked where this man lived, but my friend told me=
 not to go to see him,=20

for he would only curse me. I said: "It takes God to curse a man; man can o=
nly bring curses on his=20

own head." I found out where he lived, and went to see him. He was the weal=
thiest man within a=20

hundred miles of that place, and had a wife and seven beautiful children. J=
ust as I got to his gate I=20

saw him coming out of the front door. I stepped up to him and said:=20


_
absolutely necessary? I rather think she did, or perhaps Jack held it.  "I =
hope you'll come to see=20

me--I mean us," she said.  "I'll come," was Jack's answer.  Mr. Pierce and =
his pretty daughter went=20

to stay with a friend that night, while the boys, Tanker Ike that is my nam=
e." Then he straightened=20

up and asked--"What do you want?" "Well," I said, "I would like to ask you =
a question, if you won't=20

be angry." "Well, what is it?" "I am told that God has blessed you above al=
l men in this part of the=20

country; that He has=20
