Slavonics. Four Serbs, five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all ethnic distinctions fail and it is 

here that they prevail anachronistically and atavistically. Contradiction and change the only two 

fixtures of this tormented region. The women of the Balkan - buried under provocative mask-like 

make up, retro hairstyles and too narrow dresses. The men, clad in sepia colours, old fashioned 

suits and turn of the century moustaches. In the background there is the crying game that is 

Balkanian music: liturgy and folk and elegy combined. The smells are heavy with muskular 

perfumes. It is like time travel. It is like revisiting one's childhood."  The Author  Sam Vaknin is the

These five priests were destined to have some thrilling experiences and to meet with terrible ends, 

all of which you shall hear in due time.  Meanwhile Champlain at home in France saw with eagle 

eye that Huguenot and Catholic could never live together in peace across the wide waste of 

waters.  They were always quarrelling.  The colony did not grow as it should, in spite of the fact 

that in a single year 22,000 beaver skins were sent by the De Caens to France.  Nor was religion 

attended to as devoutly as he thought the Huguenots ought to attend to it.  But perhaps this was 

because the Huguenots did not acknowledge the authority of the Pope.  So he wrote strongly to 

De Caen about it, and the letter fell into the hands of the most powerful, most crafty man of that 

era, far more powerful than King Louis the Thirteenth himself.  Cardinal Richelieu was the King's 

Prime Minister.  Having at length accomplished great things for his master in France, Richelieu 

now turned his attention to Canada.  With a stroke of the pen he abolished the monopoly of the De 

Caens and founded the "Company of the Hundred Associates," with himself at the head.  Thence-

forward no Huguenot was to be permitted to enter the colony under any conditions.  The new 

Company was given a perpetual monopoly of the fur trade and

Florida.  Moreover, the Company was bound to send out at once a number of labourers and 

mechanics and 4000 other colonists. Champlain was made one of the Associates, and continued 

in his command of Quebec.  Canada was now to be governed directly by the King, just as if it were 

one of the provinces of Old France, and nobles were to be created who would take their titles from 

their estates.  All then seemed bright and rosy for the colony on the St. Lawrence. But the best-laid 



plans, you know, "gang aft agley"; Richelieu, with all his strength and cunning, had no power over 

English ships, and English sailors would only laugh at his pretensions.  At the very moment when 

Champlain saw all his hopes about to be realised, the most cruel blow that had yet fallen fell upon 

him.  War had been declared between France and England, and King Charles of England, seeing 

his American colonies already prosperous, wished to extend his royal sway over the whole 

continent.  Thus, while the little band of Frenchmen in Quebec were nearly starving, owing to 

supplies running short during the winter of 1628, and were straining their eyes for the arrival of the 

great fleet of eighteen ships sent out by Richelieu, an English admiral sailed coolly up the St. 

Lawrence.  Sir David Kirke commanded a stout little fleet for King Charles, and it occurred to him 

that it would be very good policy to capture Quebec. Imagine the dismay of Champlain, the priests, 

the traders, farmers, and soldiers of the colony when, {48} having waited for succour until long 

past midsummer, the oncoming ships turned out to be English, and they received a summons from 

the English admiral to surrender!  How weak his fort was Champlain well knew, but that did not 

prevent him from replying firmly and with dignity to the summons, saying that he would defend his 

post until death.  Secretly he hoped that the French fleet he expected would come in time. 

Although he intended to take Quebec, Kirke did not press his advantage just then.  He had now a 

far better plan: to lie and wait for this same French fleet, and cripple the colony in that way.  His 

reward duly came.  Off Gasp, Kirke met the squadron from France, and after a fierce struggle 

captured all the ships but one, together with much booty.  What a plight was the brave Champlain 

now in!  Cut off from all communication with France, for at least ten months must his forlorn band 

wait before assistance could arrive.  He set to work to grapple with the difficulty by sending all his 

men farming, and hunting, and fishing.  Very little land was cleared as yet; it hardly seemed worth 

while clearing it as long as the dreaded Iroquois were allowed to shoot the farmers as they 

worked, and afterwards to swoop down and burn up the crops.  Worst of all to Champlain's mind, 

the Hurons and Algonquins whom he had befriended chose such a time as this to manifest their 

enmity to him.  Instead of helping, they refused him succour.  But food of some sort must be got. 

He set his people digging up wild roots in the woods, and despatched a boat down the {49} river to 

search the gulf for a friendly trader or fisherman who would give them dried codfish.  At the end of 

a long year of hardship, when no French ship came to his relief, Champlain was ready, in sheer 

desperation, to march his hungry little garrison

could really carry out this dangerous scheme the English admiral once more showed his face in 

the St. Lawrence.  This time it seemed far better to surrender to such an enemy as the English 

than to perish miserably from starvation in the wilderness. Kirke offered honourable terms, and 

Champlain, perceiving how utterly useless was resistance, gave up for a time the fort, magazine, 

and dwellings of Quebec.  On the 24th July 1629 Champlain and ten priests and a number of 

others embarked on board one of the English ships to be carried to England, and from thence to 

France.  For the first time in its history, the flag of England was hoisted, amidst great cheering on 

the part of the lusty English mariners, over Quebec.  You must not suppose the English abused 

their victory.  All the settlers who chose were allowed to remain on their property.  Lewis Kirke was 

installed as English Governor, and treated all with kindness, giving them bounteous provisions. 

On the way down the river the ship bearing away Champlain met, near Tadoussac, Emery de 

Caen, returning with supplies for Quebec.  Too late!  Kirke turned his guns on the Frenchmen, and 

De Caen was forced at the cannon's mouth to surrender.  But although he did so, young De Caen 

told the {50} Englishman that which completely spoilt Kirke's rest that night.  "I have heard," quoth 

De Caen, "that peace hath been declared between the two Crowns, and that when you captured 

Quebec and the sixteen French ships, King Louis and King Charles had been friends for a good 

two months.  You have,

De Caen spoke not falsely, for so it turned out to be.  When Kirke anchored in Plymouth harbour 

he learnt, to his chagrin, that peace had really been made some time before, and that all 

conquests from France must be restored.  The doughty, scarred old Governor, Champlain, posted 

in hot haste to London, and unfolded the tale of Quebec's surrender to King Louis' ambassador. 

But, strange as it may appear, King Louis was in no
