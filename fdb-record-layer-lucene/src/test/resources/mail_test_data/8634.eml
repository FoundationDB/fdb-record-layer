ed. Mr. Jollefat's=20

attorney said that he had in like manner inquired at the Carlton, but could=
 learn nothing about their=20

opponent. The Liberal was discouraged; the Conservative did not take the ma=
tter to heart. They=20

were agreed that nothing could be done to spoil the new candidate.  My man =
went to a local=20

printer and got some forms printed with counterfoils, much after the manner=
 of tradesmen's=20

"delivery note-books" or bankers' cheques, the use of which will immediatel=
y be seen. He also=20

contrived to make the acquaintance of a few leaders of the people,--what th=
e French would call=20

"men of action,"--not spouters or loudly boasting partisans.  On the evenin=
g of the second day=20

after Mr. Fipps's arrival at N----, my man had a consultation with about ha=
lf a dozen of the principal=20

of these men, who may be called the heads of gangs of voters; persons who r=
egarded the=20

franchise as a property to be sold in the market, like any other commodity;=
 except that this article=20

called a vote must be purchased by a candidate in retail quantities, in ord=
er that he might sell=20

them, as a constituency, in a lump or by wholesale. The result was a compac=
t or understanding,=20

which I have no doubt would have been faithfully kept by the vendors. These=
 men always keep=20

faith with their purchaser, if no other candidate, supposed to have still a=
 heavier weight of metal=20

with which to solve their honesty, should arrive on any subsequent night be=
tween the date of the=20

arrangement with them and the day of polling.  This part of the business re=
quires to be explained=20

with much precision, or the reader may not perhaps observe the central poin=
t or pivot of the Great=20

Electioneering Trick which it is my intention now to explain.  My man had o=
ccasion to address one=20

of the vendors of the franchise to the following effect. He explained that =
the law against bribery=20

was rather severe; and Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps, Esq., was a gentleman o=
f extremely=20

delicate sensibilities, then creep northward and die there. But will they l=
ive again, those chilled air-

mothers? Yes; they must live again. For all things move forever: and not ev=
en ghosts can rest.=20

=E2=80=9CThe corpses of their sisters piling on them from above, press them=
 onward, press them southward=20

toward the sun once more, across the floes, and round the icebergs--weeping=
 tears of snow and=20

sleet--while men hate their wild, harsh voices, and shrink before their bit=
ter breath. They know not=20

that the cold bleak snow-storms, as they hurtle from the black northeast, b=
ear back the ghosts of=20

the soft air-mothers, as penitents, to their father, the great sun.  =E2=80=
=9CBut as they fly southward warm=20

life thrills them, and they drop their loads of sleet and snow, and meet th=
eir young live sisters from=20

the south, and greet them with flash and thunderpeal. Men call them the sou=
thwest wind, those=20

air-mothers: and their ghosts, the northeast trade; and value them, and rig=
htly; because they bear=20

the traders out and back across the sea.=E2=80=9D  So they live, and so the=
y die, those beautiful air-

mothers--for life is evermore fed by death. And in their wayward course the=
y bring the early and=20

the latter rain: that so long as time shall be, seed-time and harvest and s=
ummer and winter shall=20

not fail. And men love them, and welcome each in their turn, whether laden =
with the pure white=20

snow, or the cooling moisture of the distant sea; for man is a fickle creat=
ure, and remains constant=20

to none. In summer he sings of the Arctic winds; and in winter, he longs fo=
r the breath of the south;=20

for like the air-mothers, his course is ever onward, seeking that which he =
has not. Yet, sometimes=20

in his discontent, he would curse the soft air-mothers: but without them he=
 could not live. But the=20

bard knows them all, and will sing of their deeds till the sun waxes cold w=
ith the weight of years.=20

CHAPTER II.  CONSTANT WINDS.      =E2=80=9CUp from the sea I sprang, O voya=

punishment (which indeed there was), all must be free and above board,--or =

entary Commissioners,=20

_
upright, righteous, and wealthy man, the "popular candidate" himself. The a=
gent went on to say=20

that he came down to the town with the gentleman whom he had the honour to =
serve. He could=20

not have supposed that the state of the borough would have entailed upon hi=
m the necessity of=20

doing things which he saw were essential to the success of Mr. Fipps, but y=
et, being in it, he was=20

determined to go on and secure a triumph for the distinguished and generous=
-hearted man he=20

represented at that interview. As for money, that did not matter. Mr. Fipps=
 was rich enough in all=20

conscience. Any thing they might have to pay would not hurt him--not a bit =
of it; but his character=20

must be above reproach at the clubs and in his own eyes. One way out of the=
 difficulty, my man=20

went on to observe, had occurred to him, and he had already resolved to pur=
sue that course, or to=20

withdraw his candidate at once before any money worth mentioning had been s=
pent; because=20

annual journey of the earth about the sun, the inclination of the earth=E2=
=80=99s axis to its orbit, and the=20

distance of any particular region in question, from the equator.  But the c=
hanges thus constantly=20

made are greatly modified by other factors. Chief among these agencies are =
the form and extent=20

of the continents, their position relative to each other and the water area=
s, and the currents of the=20

air and sea.  Men usually identify climate with atmospheric conditions. A w=
arm atmosphere is for=20

them the whole of a warm climate: it is really but one of its factors, at m=
ost: it is often to be=20

considered as a result, rather than a cause. On lofty plateaus, or in mount=
ainous regions, the heat=20

is not oppressive, even in the tropics; but here the moderate temperature i=
s due to the elevation.=20

France is as far north as Labrador; but there is no similarity whatever in =
climatic conditions, as=20

there should be, were climate dependent only on the heating of=20


_
enough, and more than enough, for every necessity, he did not like squander=
ing it, and losing the=20

object of his ambition also. At this suggestion of the removal of the candi=
date and his cash-box,=20

the leaders of the people looked somewhat blank or alarmed. They said a man=
 like Mr. Fipps was=20

sure to win if he went the right way about it, and they thought it a pity h=
e should run away after the=20

handsome manner in which he had been treated by all classes.  Some further =
parleying took=20

place, when it was agreed that late at night the several leaders of the peo=
ple atmosphere by the=20

rays of the sun. Who would think of instituting a comparison of sunny Rome =
or Madrid with the city=20

of New York? Yet the three are nearly on the same parallel: Rome furthest n=
orth. So there is little=20

resemblance between the warmth of sunny Florida and the scorching heat of t=
he Sahara: or=20

between the climates in those portions of our own Pacific and Atlantic coas=
ts that lie between the=20

same parallels. So we find that though there is a general relation between =
the climate of a region=20

and its distance from the equator, there are many other=20
