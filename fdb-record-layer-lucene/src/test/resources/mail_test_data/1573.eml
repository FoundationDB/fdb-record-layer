Jesus is made to utter the greatest       fallacy. What was Esoterically me=

is above       the material and astral man, the highest Principle (save the=
 Monad)       within man,=20

'temple.' " "If thou wilt be       perfect (_i.e._, an Adept and Initiate) =
go and sell that thou hast"=20

(_Matt._, xix. 21). Every man who desired to become a neophyte, a       che=
la, then, as now, had=20

to take the vow of poverty. The "Perfect,"       was the name given to the =
Initiates of every=20

denomination. Plato       calls them by that term. The Essenes had their "P=
erfect," and Paul=20

plainly states that they, the Initiates, can only speak before other       =
Adepts. "We speak wisdom=20

among them [only] that are perfect" (_I.       Cor._ ii. 6.)    officers, t=

have without breakfast. My=20

friend here, Monsieur du Vallon, shares my gratitude, for he was particular=

D'Artagnan. "I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already=

understand our disappointment when, arriving at a pretty little house on th=

at a distance had quite a gay appearance, with its red roof and green shutt=
