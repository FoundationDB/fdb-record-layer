now, from my car-seat, I could see Gershom surrounded by a multi-colored gr=
oup of little figures,=20

as he stopped to fix a strap-buckle on the school-bag of one of his pupils.=
 And as he stood there in=20

the slanting afternoon sunlight surrounded by his charges he suddenly made =
me think of the tall=20

old priest in Sorolla's _Triste Herencia_ surrounded by his floor, door or =
window. In this "rough,=20

rough," abode, his lanky, lean- visaged, awkward and somewhat pensive thoug=
h strong, hearty=20

and patient son Abraham had a "rough, rough" life, and underwent experience=
s which, if they were=20

not calculated to form a Pitt or a Turgot, were calculated to season an Ame=
rican politician, and=20

make him a winner in the tough=20


_
benignant and Lincoln-like from that raw-boned figure in the big-lensed eye=
-glasses and the=20

clothes that didn't quite fit him. And my respect for Gershom went up like =
a Chinook-fanned=20

thermometer. He took those children of his seriously. He liked them. He was=
 trying to give them=20

the best that was in him. And that solemn purpose saved him, redeemed him, =
ennobled his=20

baldness just as it ennobled the baldness of the four-square little frame b=
uilding behind him. I don't=20

know why it was, but for some reason or other that picture of the northern =
prairie and the gaunt=20

school-teacher surrounded by his pupils in the thinning afternoon sunlight =
became memorable to=20

me. It photographed itself on my mind, not sharply, but softened with a fri=
nging prism of feeling,=20

like a picture taken with what camera-men call a "soft-focus." It touched m=
y heart, in some way,=20

and threatened to bring a choke up into my foolish old throat.  It was Paul=
ine Augusta who saw me=20

first. She came toward the car with her strapped school-books and her lunch=
-box in her hand and=20

a prim little smile on her slightly freckled face. She impressed me as a st=
artingly shabby figure, in=20

the old sealskin coat which I had made over for her, worn clean to the hide=
 along the front, for=20

even those early autumn days found a chill in the air when the sun began to=
 get low. She had just=20

climbed in beside me when I caught sight of Dinkie. I saw him come down the=
 school-steps,=20

stuffing something into the pocket of his reefer-jacket as he came. He look=
ed startlingly tall, for a=20

boy of his years. He seemed deep in thought. There was, indeed, an air of r=
emoteness about him=20

which for a moment rather startled me, an air of belonging, not to me, but =
to the world into which=20

he was peering with such ardent young eyes. Then he caught sight of me, and=
 at the same=20

moment his face both lightened and brightened. He came faithful representat=
ion of whose aims,=20

sentiments, tastes, passions and prejudices was the one thing needful to qu=
alify him for obtaining=20

the prize of his ambition. "For two years Lincoln (the father) continued to=
 live alone in the old way.=20

He did not like to farm, and he never got much of his land under cultivatio=
n. His principal crop was=20

corn; and this, with the game which a rifleman so expert would easily take =
from the woods around=20

him, supplied his table." It does not appear that he employed any of his me=
chanical skill in=20

completing and furnishing his own cabin. It has already been stated that th=
e latter had no window,=20

door or floor. "But the furniture, if it might be called furniture, was eve=
n worse than the house.=20

Three-legged stools served for chairs. A bedstead was made of poles stuck i=
n the cracks of the=20

logs in one corner of the cabin, while the other end rested in the crotch o=
f a forked stick stuck in=20

the earthen floor. On these were laid some boards, and on the boards a shak=
e-down of leaves,=20

covered with skins and old petticoats. The table was a hewed puncheon suppo=
rted by four legs.=20

They had a few pewter and tin dishes to eat from, but the most minute inven=
tory of their effects=20

makes no mention of knives or forks. Their cooking utensils were a Dutch ov=
en and a skillet.=20

Abraham slept in the loft, to which he ascended by means of pins driven int=
o holes in the wall." Of=20

his father's disposition, Abraham seems to have inherited at all events the=
 dislike to labour, though=20

his sounder moral nature prevented him from being an idler. His tendency to=
 politics came from=20

the same element of character as his father's preference for the rifle. In =
after life we are told his=20

mind "was filled with gloomy forebodings and strong apprehensions of impend=
ing evil, mingled=20

with extravagant visions of personal grandeur and power." His melancholy,=
=20


_
twist of the body which overtakes him in his occasional moments of embarras=
sment, for it was=20

plain that he stood averse to any undue display of emotion before his playm=
ates. He merely said,=20

"Hello, Mummy" and smiled awkwardly. But after he had climbed up into the c=
ar and wormed=20

down between Pauline Augusta and me, and after I had tucked the old bear-ro=
be about them and=20

called out to Gershom that I'd carry my kiddies home, I could feel Dinkie's=
 arm push shyly in=20

behind my back and work its way as far around my waist as it was able to re=
ach. He didn't speak.=20

But his solemn little face gazed up at me, with its habitual hungry look, a=
nd I could see the hazel=20

specks in the brown iris of the friends as "terrible," was closely connecte=
d with the cravings of his=20

demagogic ambition, and the root of both was in him from a boy.  In the Ind=
iana cabin Abraham's=20

mother, whose maiden name was Nancy Hanks, died, far from medical aid, of t=
he epidemic called=20

milk sickness. She was preceded in death by her relatives, the Sparrows, wh=
o had succeeded the=20

Lincolns in the "camp," and by many neighbours, whose coffins Thomas Lincol=
n made out of=20

"green lumber cut with a whip saw." Upon Nancy's death he took to his green=
 lumber again and=20

made a box for her. "There were about twenty persons at her funeral. They t=
ook her to the summit=20

of a deeply wooded knoll, about half a mile south-east of the=20


_
me ridiculously happy. For I knew that my boy loved me. And I love him. I l=
ove him so much that it=20

brings a tapering spear-head of pain into my heart, and at the very moment =
I'm so happy I feel a=20

tear just under the surface.     _Sunday the Tenth_   I have been reading P=
eter's latest letter to=20

Dinkie, reading it for the second time. It is not so frolicsome as many of =
its fellows, but it=20

ceremonies, they were of the briefest. But it happened that a few months la=
ter an itinerant=20

preacher, named David Elkin, whom the Lincolns had known in Kentucky, wande=
red into the=20

settlement, and he either volunteered or was employed to preach a sermon, w=
hich should=20

commemorate the many virtues and pass over in silence the few frailties of =
the poor woman who=20

slept in the forest. Many years=20
