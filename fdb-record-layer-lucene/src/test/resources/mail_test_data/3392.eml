resembled a cauliflower. He would then arrange his tope or plaid of thick c=
otton cloth, and throw=20

one end over his left shoulder, while slung from the same shoulder his circ=
ular shield would hang=20

upon his back; suspended by a strap over the right shoulder would hang his =
long two-edged=20

broadsword.  Fat is the great desideratum of an Arab; his head, as I have d=
escribed, should be a=20

mass of grease; he rubs his body with oil or other ointment; his clothes, i=
.e. his one garment or=20

tope, is covered with grease, and internally he swallows as much as he can =
procure.  The great=20

Sheik Abou Sinn, who is upwards of eighty, as upright as a dart, a perfect =
Hercules, and whose=20

children and grandchildren are like the sand of the sea-shore, has always c=
onsumed daily=20

throughout his life two rottolis (pounds) of melted butter. A short time be=
fore I left the country he=20

married a new young wife about fourteen years of age. This may be a hint to=
 octogenarians.  The=20

fat most esteemed for dressing the hair is that of the sheep. This undergoe=
s a curious preparation,=20

which renders it similar in appearance to cold cream; upon the raw fat bein=
g taken from the animal=20

it is chewed in the mouth by an Arab for about two hours, being frequently =
taken out for=20

examination during that time, until it has assumed the desired consistency.=
 To prepare sufficient to=20

enable a man to appear in full dress, several persons must be employed in m=
asticating fat at the=20

same time. This species of pomade, when properly made, is perfectly white, =
and exceedingly light=20

and frothy. It may be imagined that when exposed to a burning sun, the beau=
ty of the head-dress=20

quickly disappears, but the oil then runs down the neck and back, which is =
considered quite=20

correct, should delight in having her for a sister-in-law, but the affair w=
ill require management. We=20

can make short work of getting home: steam to Marseilles, leave the yacht t=
here, and take the=20

railroad. I have half a mind to telegraph to Bertha to meet us there. She w=

CHAPTER 79 Lothair was delighted with Galilee, and particularly with the bl=
ue waters of its lake=20

slumbering beneath the surrounding hills. Of all its once pleasant towns, T=
iberias alone remains,=20

and that in ruins from a recent earthquake. But where are Chorazin, and Bet=
hsaida, and=20

Capernaum? A group of hovels and an ancient tower still bear the magic name=
 of Magdala, and all=20

around are green mounts and gentle slopes, the scenes of miracles that soft=
ened the heart of=20

man, and of sermons that never tire his ear. Dreams passed over Lothair of =
settling forever on the=20

shores of these waters, and of reproducing all their vanished happiness: re=
building their=20

memorable cities, reviving their fisheries, cultivating the plain of Gennes=
aret and the country of the=20

Gadarenes, and making researches in this cradle of pure and primitive Chris=
tianity.  The heritage=20

of Paraclete was among the oaks of Bashan, a lofty land, rising suddenly fr=
om the Jordan valley,=20

verdant and well watered, and clothed in many parts with forest; there the =
host of Lothair resided=20

among his lands and people, and himself dwelt in a stone and castellated bu=
ilding, a portion of=20

which was of immemorial antiquity, and where he could rally his forces and =
defend himself in case=20

of the irruption and invasion of the desert tribes. And here one morn arriv=
ed a messenger from=20

Jerusalem summoning Lothair back to that city, in consequence of the intend=
ed departure of his=20

friends.=20


_
thoroughly greased; the man is then perfectly anointed. We had seen an amus=
ing exanmple of this=20

when on the march from Berber to Gozerajup. The Turk, Hadji Achmet, had pre=
ssed into our=20

service, as a guide for a few miles, a dandy who had just been arranged as =
a cauliflower, with at=20

least half a pound of white fat upon his head. As we were travelling upward=
s of four miles an hour=20

in an intense heat, during which he was obliged to run, the fat ran quicker=
 than he did, and at the=20

end of a couple of hours both the dandy and his pomade were exhausted; the =
poor fellow had to=20

return to his friends with the total loss of personal appearance and half a=
 pound of butter.  Not only=20

are the Arabs particular in their pomade, but great attention is bestowed u=
pon perfumery,=20

especially by the women. Various perfumes are brought from Cairo by the tra=
velling native=20

merchants; among which those most in demand are oil of roses, oil of sandal=
wood, an essence=20

from the blossom of a species of mimosa, essence of musk, and the oil of cl=
oves. The women=20

have a peculiar method of scenting their bodies and clothes by an operation=
 that is considered to=20

be one of the necessaries of life, and which is repeated at regular interva=
ls. In the floor of the tent,=20

or The call was urgent, and was obeyed immediately with that promptitude wh=
ich the manners of=20

the East, requiring no preparation, admit. Paraclete accompanied his guest.=
 They had to cross the=20

Jordan, and then to trace their way till they reached the southern limit of=
 the plain of Esdraelon,=20

from whence they counted on the following day to reach Jerusalem. While the=
y were encamped=20

on this spot, a body of Turkish soldiery seized all their horses, which wer=
e required, they said, by=20

the Pacha of Damascus, who was proceeding to Jerusalem, attending a great T=
urkish general,=20

who was on a mission to examine the means of defence of Palestine on the Eg=
yptian side. This=20

was very vexatious, but one of those incidents of Eastern life against whic=
h it is impossible to=20

contend; so Lothair and Paraclete were obliged to take refuge in their pipe=
s beneath a huge and=20

solitary sycamore-tree, awaiting the arrival of the Ottoman magnificoes.  T=
hey came at last, a=20

considerable force of cavalry, then mules and barbarous carriages with the =
harem, all the riders=20

and inmates enveloped in what appeared to be winding-sheets, white and shap=
eless; about them=20

eunuchs and servants. The staff of the pachas followed, preceding the grand=
ees who closed the=20

march, mounted=20


_
excavated sufficiently large to contain a common-sized champagne bottle: a =
fire of charcoal, or of=20

simply glowing enmbers, is made within the hole, into which the woman about=
 to be scented=20

throws a handful of various drugs; she then takes off the cloth or tope whi=
ch forms her dress, and=20

crouches naked over the fumes, while she arranges her robe to fall as a man=
tle from  Paraclete=20

and Lothair had been obliged to leave the grateful shade of the sycamore-tr=
ee, as the spot had=20

been fixed on by the commander of the advanced guard for the resting-place =
of the pachas. They=20

were standing aside and watching the progress of the procession, and contem=
plating the earliest=20

opportunity of representing their grievances to high authority, when the=20
