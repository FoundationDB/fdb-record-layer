allowing a _regency_ to continue three     or four thousand years. In volum=

Researches_, we are told that: "Paricshit, the great nephew and     success=

allowed without controversy to have     reigned in the interval between the=
 _brazen and earthen_,=20

or Cali     Ages, and to have died at the setting-in of the Cali Yug." Here=
 we     find an=20

_interregnum_ at the _end_ of the _brazen_ age, and     _before_ the settin=

and as there can be but     one brazen or Treta Yug, _i.e._, the third age,=
 in a Maha Yuga of=20

1,080,000 years: the reign of this Paricshit must have been in the     seco=
nd Maha Yuga, when the=20

pole had returned to its original     position, which must have taken 2,160=
,000 years: and this is=20

what     the Hindus call the Prajanatha Yuga. Analogous to this custom is  =
   that of some nations=20

more modern, who, fond of even numbers, have     made the common year to co=
nsist of  "Oh, mon=20

He continued:  "So I was going away, but he called me back.  "'You have had=

Porthos, "that was very good of him, it seems to me."  "'A thousand pistole=

pistoles!" Porthos exclaimed. "Oh! oh! that is a large sum. If he knew anyt=

would dispute the price."  "Faith! he was very much inclined to do so, the =
