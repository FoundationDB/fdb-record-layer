the musical intervals on mathematical principles. These vessels are arranged with a view to 

musical concords or harmony, and apportioned in the compass of the fourth, the fifth, and the 

octave, and so on up to the double octave, in such a way that when the voice of an actor falls in 

unison with any of them its power is increased, and it reaches the ears of the audience with 

greater clearness and sweetness. Water organs, too, and the other instruments which resemble 

them cannot be made by one who is without the principles of music.  10. The architect should also 

have a knowledge of the study of medicine on account of the questions of climates (in Greek 

[Greek: klimata]), air, the healthiness and unhealthiness of sites, and the use of different waters. 

For without these considerations, the healthiness of a dwelling cannot be assured. And as for 

principles of law, he should know those which are necessary in the case of buildings having party 

walls, with regard to water dripping from the eaves, and also the laws about drains, windows, and 

water supply. And other things of this sort should be known to architects, so that, before they 

begin upon buildings, they may be careful not to leave disputed points for the householders to 

settle after the works are finished, and so that in drawing up contracts the interests of both 

employer and contractor may be wisely safe-guarded. For if a contract is skilfully drawn, each may 

obtain a release from the other without disadvantage. From astronomy we find the east, west, 

south, and north, as well as the theory of the heavens, the equinox, solstice, and courses of the 

stars. If one I scorn bribery.  If you will not aid me for the sake of a poor, helpless, infatuated girl, 

who is on the brink of ruin--"  "Missis Dashwood," said the Bloater, with a look of serio-comic 

dignity, "I scorns bribery as much as you does.  `No bribery, no c'rupt'ons, no Popery,' them's my 

mottoes--besides a few more that there's no occasion to mention.  W'ether or not I gives 'im up 

depends on circumstances. Now, I s'pose _you_ want's 'im took an' bagged, 'cause 'e ain't fit for 

your friend Martha Reading--we'll drop the `Miss' if you please.  Well, wot I want to know is, does 

Martha think as you does?"  "Of course not, boy.  No doubt she knows that he is an unworthy 

scoundrel, but she can't prevail on herself to forsake him; so, you see, I want to help her a little." 

"Ah, I see--yes--I see.  Well, missis, I'll take it into consideration. Come along, Jim."  Without 

waiting for a reply, the Bloater quitted the house abruptly, followed by his friend.  He walked very 

fast towards the City--so fast that Jim was compelled to trot--and was unusually silent.  He went 

straight to the abode of Martha Reading, and found her sewing and weeping.  "Ha! _he's_ bin with 

you, I see," said the Bloater.  "Did 'e ask you to let 'im 'ide 'ere?"  "Ye-es;" said Martha, hesitating; 

"but I refused to do it.  God knows how willing--how willing--I would be to shelter and save him if I 

could!"  "Would you shelter a _guilty_ man?" demanded the Bloater, sternly.  "I don't know that he 

is guilty," said Martha, evasively.  "But, tell me, what did Mrs Dashwood want with you?"  "That's a 

private matter," said the Bloater, frowning.  "You can't turn

Consequently, since this study is so vast in extent, embellished and enriched as it is with many 

different kinds of learning, I think that men have no right to profess themselves architects hastily, 

without having climbed from boyhood the steps of these studies and thus, nursed by the 

knowledge of many arts and sciences, having reached the heights of the holy ground of 

architecture.  12. But perhaps to the inexperienced it will seem a marvel that human nature can 

comprehend such a great number of studies and keep them in the memory. man over to justice?" 

"It is," replied Martha, wiping her eyes, "but it is also right to temper justice with mercy."  "I say, 

that's drawin' it rather fine, ain't it?" said the Bloater, screwing up one eyebrow and turning towards 

Little Jim; but that small youth was so touched with the poor girl's sorrow and so attracted by her 

countenance, that he had quite forgotten his patron for the moment. Going towards her, he laid his 

dirty little hand on her knee, and looked up in her face.  "God bless you, dear boy," she said, 

patting him on the head, "you are the first that has given me a look of sympathy for many--"  She
