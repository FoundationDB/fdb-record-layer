nothing.  The boys stared at each other in wonder, not unmixed with fright.=
  "Are there any big=20

eagles around here?" asked Jack, quickly turning to Long Gun.  But the Indi=
an did not seem to=20

hear. He was staring up into the black sky.  The noise passed on, the throb=
bing becoming fainter.=20

Then Long Gun cried out:  "Great spirit! Danger come! Bad luck!"  With a ho=
wl that did more to=20

frighten the boys than had the mysterious sound, the Indian made a dive for=
 the tent, and hid=20

himself under his blankets.     CHAPTER XXI  THE DEADLY GAS   Long Gun's ex=
ample and his=20

fright were contagious, to a certain degree. Seeing him run, Bony and Sam t=
urned also, for they=20

thought the Indian heard or recognized some danger. Then, as the noise ceas=
ed, they stopped in=20

their progress toward the tent.  "What in the world do you suppose that was=
?" asked Sam.=20

"You've got me," was Bony's answer, while, in his excitement, he cracked hi=
s knuckles on the=20

double-quick. "What do you think it was, Jack?"  "Blessed if I know. It sou=
nded like a big bird, or,=20

maybe, a whole lot of them. But Long Gun wouldn't be frightened of some bir=
ds, even if they were=20

eagles."  "Let's ask him," suggested Nat.  They went into the tent, which w=
as illuminated by a=20

couple of lanterns, and found Long Gun groveling among his rather be conten=
t with a crust of=20

bread and a drink of water than let my father or mother go to the workhouse=
. The idea of a=20

professing Christian doing such a thing! God have mercy on such a godless C=
hristianity as that! It=20

is a withered up thing, and the breath of heaven will drive it away. Don't =
profess to love God and=20

do a thing like that.  A friend of mine told me of a poor man who had sent =
his son to school in the=20

city. One day the father was hauling some wood into the city, perhaps to pa=
y his boy's bills. The=20

young man was walking down the street with two of his school friends, all d=
ressed in the very=20

height of fashion. His father saw him, and was so glad that he left his woo=
d, and went to the=20

sidewalk to speak to him. But the boy was ashamed of his father, who had on=
 his old working=20

clothes, and spurned him, and said:  "I don't know you."  Will such a young=
 man ever amount to=20

anything? Never!  I remember a very promising young man whom I had in the S=
unday school in=20

Chicago. His father was a confirmed drunkard, and his mother took in washin=
g to educate her four=20

children. This was her eldest son, and I thought that he was going to redee=
m the whole family. But=20

one day a thing happened that made him go down in my estimation.  The boy w=
as in the high=20

school, and was a very bright scholar. One day he stood with his mother at =
the cottage door--it=20

was a poor house, but=20

"What was that, Long Gun?" asked Jack.  The Indian murmured something in hi=
s own tongue.=20

"Were they birds?" went on Jack. "What's the matter with you?"  "Long Gun '=
fraid," was the reply.=20

"No like sound in dark night. Long Gun 'fraid."  "But what sound was it?" p=
ersisted Jack.  "Dunno.=20

Great Spirit, mebby. Bad sound. Trouble come."  "That's all nonsense," said=
 Jack, as he saw that=20

his chums looked worried. "It was probably the wind."  "But there isn't any=
 wind," declared Nat. "It's=20

as still as can be."  "Maybe there is a wind in the upper currents of air,"=
 suggested Jack. "You=20

must remember we're among the mountains, and the air is different here."  "=
It isn't different=20

enough to make a noise like that," was Sam's opinion. children, and hire a =
very good house too,=20

out of her earnings. When they were talking a young man from the high schoo=

and this boy walked away from his mother. Next day the young man said:  "Wh=

you talking to yesterday?"  "Oh, that was my washerwoman."  I said: "Poor f=
ellow! He will never=20

down, down, down, and now he is just a miserable wreck. Of course he would =
go down. Ashamed=20
