imilar objection to Sir Joshua Reynolds or Gainsborough that they did not e=
xtract their pigments from the natural vegetables _
of the kings of Castile, receiving the Emperor, as King of Spain,       for=
 their supreme and=20

universal sovereign; and they made some sinas,       like signatures, which=
 I have in my=20

possession, together with the       attestations of the said friars. 23.23.=
 Just when this growth of=20

faith inspired the friars with great joy       and hope of drawing to Jesus=
 Christ the still numerous=20

people of       that kingdom who survived the murders and unjust wars, eigh=
teen       Spanish=20

tyrants on horse entered a certain part of the country with       twelve ot=
hers on foot, which makes=20

thirty, and they brought with       them many loads of idols taken from the=
 Indians in other=20

provinces. 24.24. And the captain of the said thirty summoned a lord of the=
 country       where he=20

had entered, and told him that he must take those loads of       idols and =
distribute them=20

throughout his country, trading each idol       for an Indian man or woman,=
 to make them slaves; he=20

threatened to       make war on the chief if he refused. 25.25. Forced by f=
ear, the said lord=20

distributed the idols throughout all       this territory and commanded all=
 his vassals that they=20

should accept       and adore them, and give him Indian men and women as sl=
aves for the=20

Spaniards.  In alarm, the Indians who had two children gave one of       th=
em, and those who had=20

three gave two; and in this way they       concluded that sacrilegious comm=
erce and the lord, or=20

prince       satisfied the Spaniards. 26.26. One of these impious and infer=
nal bandits, called Juan=20

Garcia, when       ill and near death, had under his bed two loads of idols=
 and he       commanded=20

an Indian woman who served him, to be very careful not to       exchange th=
ose idols for fowls, but=20

each one for a slave because       they were very valuable.  And finally wi=
th this testament and=20

occupied with this thought the unhappy man died.  And who doubts       that=
 he is buried in hell?=20

27.27. Consider therefore of what profit are the religion and the examples =
      of Christianity of the=20

Spaniards who go to the Indies; what honour       they procure for God; how=
 they work that he may=20

be known and adored       by those people; what care they take that His hol=
y faith be sown,=20

grow and expand in those souls.  And judge whether this be a less       sin=
 than Jeroboam's qui=20

peccare fecit Israel by making two golden       calves, for the people to a=
dore.  Or whether it equals=20

that of Judas       or causes more scandal. 28.28. These then are the deeds=
 of the Spaniards who=20

go to the Indies; in       their desire for gold they have numberless times=
 sold, and do sell,       and=20

have forsworn Jesus Christ. 29.29. When the Indians saw that the promise th=
e monks made them=20

that the       Spaniards should not enter those provinces did not come true=
, and       that the same=20

Spaniards brought their idols from other countries to       sell, after the=
y had given all their own=20

gods to the monks to be       burned, so that they might adore the one true=
 God, they became=20

tumultuous and the whole country was enraged with the friars, to       whom=
 they said: 30.30. Why=20

have you lied and deceived sober clock which only records ordinary time.  T=
his French influence=20

was world-wide. By the courtesy of the authorities of the Metropolitan Muse=
um of Art, New York,=20

an American clock is illustrated (p. 193), the makers being Savin and Dyer,=
 of Boston. This is in=20

date 1780 to 1800. It is of fine proportions, and the lyre ornament is kept=
 in due reticence.  As=20

exemplifying the far-reaching effect that French design had on this country=
, we reproduce an=20

interesting illustration of a cottager's clock of the early nineteenth cent=
ury (p. 195). It is really a=20

vase of earthenware made in Staffordshire. On one side is painted in blue a=
 Chinese scene, on=20

the other is a clock-face in imitation of a French dial. But the hands perp=
etually mark seventeen=20

minutes past eight. In copper lustre-ware this vase with its sham dial serv=
ed the cottager as=20

something ornamental, although not useful. It is a replica in homely Englis=
h earthenware of French=20



_finesse_, a cottage echo of the vase-clocks of Sevres in the apartments at=
 Versailles. The=20

cottager's desire to have a clock was satisfied by the Staffordshire potter=
.  [Illustration: BRACKET=20

Width, 10 in. Depth, 6-1/2 in.]  Many clocks of the last quarter of the eig=
hteenth century show the=20

lingering styles of the earlier decades. It is impossible to lay down any d=
efinite rule in furniture, in=20

silver, or in old clocks, that in such a year a certain style ends. Approxi=
mately, one may determine=20

periods and by close application discover slight indications of new styles =
beginning to take the=20

town. Now and again one comes across examples a great many years behind the=
 time, especially=20

in provincial makers, where fashions in cases were not so frequently change=
d.  Illustrated on p.=20

199 are two clocks; one, in date 1770, by Alexander Cumming, is only 14 inc=
hes in height; the=20

other, 1800, having no maker's name, is 15-3/4 inches high. A new and very =
pleasing form is=20

introduced. We see the dial in process of losing its lunette. It makes its =
ascent on the case to take=20

its place as in later styles. This raising of the dial affected the top of =
the case, which became of=20

circular form. The transitional period is shown by the ornament remaining i=
n the right-hand clock in=20

the lower spandrels. The case-maker had not quite assimilated the changing =
form. It is interesting=20

to note that in both these clocks the handles of the early portable clock a=
re reintroduced.  At the=20

beginning of the nineteenth century the circular dial had become establishe=
d. An interesting=20

transitional clock by Barraud (p. 201), in date 1805, shows that the case-m=
aker was averse to=20

parting with the lunette. He accordingly places the dial in the centre of t=
he case and has a=20


_
enter this country?  And why have you burnt our gods when your       Christ=
ians bring gods from=20

other provinces to sell to us?  Were       perhaps our gods not better than=
 those of other nations?=20

31.31. The friars having nothing to reply, calmed them as best they could. =
      They sought out the=20

thirty Spaniards, telling them the harm they had       done and beseeching =
them to depart, but they=20

would not go; on the       contrary they gave the Indians to understand, th=
at it was the friars=20

themselves who had made them come there,--which was the height of all      =
 malice. 32.32. At last=20

the Indians determined to kill the friars; being warned by       some India=
n, the latter escaped one=20

night.  And when the friars had       left, and the Indians perceived their=
 innocence and virtue and=20

the       malice of the Spaniards, they sent messengers a distance of fifty=
       leagues after them,=20

praying them to return, and asking their pardon       for the anxiety they =
had caused them. 33.33.=20

The friars, being servants of God and zealous for those souls, gave       t=
hem credence, and=20

returned to the country where they were received       like angels, the Ind=
ians rendering them a=20

thousand services; and       they stayed there four or five months longer. =
34.34. As that country=20

was so distant from New Spain, the Viceroy's       efforts to expel those C=
hristians from it were=20

fruitless, and they       persisted in remaining there although he had them=
 proclaimed       traitors;=20

and because they never ceased their outrages and habitual       oppression =
of the Indians, it=20

seemed to the monks that, sooner or       later the natives would become di=
sgusted with such=20

perverse works,       and that perhaps the evil consequences would fall on =
them,       especially as=20

the evil deeds of the Spaniards constantly disturbed       the Indians and =
prevented them from=20

preaching to them in tran-       quillity.  They therefore determined to ab=
andon the kingdom. 35.35.=20

Thus the country was left without the light and help of doctrine;       and=
 those souls were=20

abandoned to the obscurity of ignorance and       misery, in which they for=
merly were.  The Indians=20

were deprived,       till better times should come, of assistance and the d=
iffusion of       the=20

knowledge of God, which they had been already receiving with       eagernes=
s; it was just as=20

though we were to deprive plants of water       a few days after planting t=
hem: and this was brought=20

about by the       inexpiable fault and consummate malice of those Spaniard=
s.=20

The Province of Santa Maria      1. The province of Santa Marta was a count=
ry where the Indians=20

had a       great deal of gold because both it and the places round about h=
ave       rich mines which=20

were diligently worked.  And for this reason, from       the year 1498 till=
 the present 1542,=20

numberless Spanish tyrants have       continually gone there with ships to =
ravage and kill those=20

people       and to steal their gold.  They afterwards returned in the ship=
s with       which they made=20

numerous expeditions, murdering and massacring, with       notorious cruelt=
y; this commonly=20

occurred along the seacoast and a       few leagues inland, till the year 1=
523.  2.2. In the year 1523=20

some Spanish tyrants went to take up their abode       here. And because th=
e country, as has been=20

said, was rich, divers       captains succeeded one metal-worker from the C=
hinese potter. Of the=20

same date is a provincial clock by Strowbridge, of Dawlish. Here the maker =
has boldly adopted the=20

circular top, and the result is a case of pleasing proportions.  Restlessne=
ss of design characterized=20

this period. The old square dial was rarely if ever used. The arched-top ca=
se is another form, as=20

illustrated (p. 205), where the maker, Biddell, refrained from following th=
e line of the circular dial in=20

his case. The adjacent example, in date 1800 to 1815, shows the circular di=
al surmounting the=20

pediment of the case. After its vicissitudes it has at length triumphed in =
becoming the dominant=20

note in the design.  As illustrating the varied attempts to make the table =
clock an imposing=20



ornament and deal with its decoration in an elaborate manner, the fine cloc=
k in ebony case inlaid=20

with blue and white Wedgwood medallions is a remarkable example (illustrate=
d p. 207). An=20

especially noteworthy feature in this clock is the beaded ornamentation aro=
und the dial and the=20

medallions and the other portions of the case of cut steel.  The series of =
table clocks illustrated=20

should indicate to the reader the salient features of such clocks, which ar=
e sought after by=20

collectors and carefully prized by those who love the fine work of the old =
English clockmakers.=20

great deal of attention has been paid by collectors to clocks by well-known=
 London makers and too=20

little examination has been given to fine examples by those of the province=
s. In the present=20

chapter an attempt is made to fill a hiatus in this respect, and by the kin=
dness of those interested=20

in the various localities certain data are presented which may stimulate th=
e student to continue his=20

researches on the lines here indicated.  The metropolis attracted noteworth=
y makers, but they had=20

their origin and often their early training in the provinces.  The followin=
g are among the great=20

London clockmakers, but they were not Londoners. They come from all parts o=
f the country.=20

Joseph Knibb (about 1670) was an Oxfordshire man. The famous Thomas Tompion=
, born in 1638,=20

came from Bedfordshire. George Graham (1673-1751) tramped to London from Cu=
mberland.=20

Thomas Earnshaw, who perfected the marine chronometer, his additions being =
still in use, was=20

born at Ashton-under-Lyne in 1750 and served his apprenticeship there. Henr=
y Jones, who was=20

the pupil of Edward East, was the son of a vicar at Southampton. Charles II=
 had a clock made by=20

him. Thomas Mudge was the son of a schoolmaster and was born at Exeter in 1=
715. Another=20

Exeter man was Jacob Lovelace, who took over thirty years to construct a re=
markable clock. The=20

celebrated John=20


_
that it seemed as though each had made a vow to practise more       exorbit=
ant evils and cruelty=20

than the other, in verification of the       rule we have given above.  3.3=
. In the year 1529 there=20

arrived a great tyrant accompanied by many       men, devoid of any fear of=
 God or any mercy on=20

mankind; so great       were the massacres, slaughter and impiety he perpet=
rated, that he=20

surpassed all his predecessors.  During the space of six, or seven carpente=
r on an estate at=20

Pontefract. It was he who competed for the Government gratuity offered for =
a nautical timekeeper,=20

for which he finally received L10,000, after repeated tests in voyages to t=
he West Indies by himself=20

and his son. We think of his early struggles, when he travelled up to Londo=
n after he was forty,=20

only to find that he had to return to the provinces and continue his vocati=
on as clock-mender in=20

ordinary and inventor extraordinary. There=20


_
years that he lived, he and his men stole much treasure. (96)  4.4. He died=
 without sacraments=20

after also avoiding the commission of       investigation met on his accoun=
t; and afterwards, other=20

murderous       and thieving tyrants succeeded, who continued to destroy th=
ose       people who=20

had survived the treatment and cruel swords of their       predecessors.  5=
.5. They marched far=20

inland, ruining and exterminating large and       numerous wooden wheels an=
d pinions by him in=20

the Guildhall Museum, London.  The list is by no means complete. There was =
John Ellicott, who=20

was born at Bodmin, and another Cornishman from the same town is John Arnol=
d, who was=20

apprenticed to his father, a watchmaker there. Arnold continued what Harris=
on had begun in the=20

chronometer. We must not exclude the great Dr. Hooke, who was born at Fresh=
water, Isle of=20

Wight, who invented the anchor escapement for clocks and=20


_
the ways above told of the others, putting lords and their vassals       to=
 grievous tortures to force=20

them to disclose the gold and the town       where it was to be had: as has=
 been said they=20

surpassed, both in       number and quality, the operations of all their pr=
edecessors so that=20

from the said year 1529, till to-day, they have devastated in those       p=
arts more than four=20

hundred leagues of country, which was as       densely peopled as the other=
.  6.6. I truthfully=20

declare that if I had to relate singly the evil, the       massacres, the d=
estruction, injustice, violence,=20

slaughter, and the       great sins the Spaniards have committed in this Ki=
ngdom of Santa     of the=20

balance spring in watches with Huygens.  =3DNames of Clockmakers found on C=
locks in the=20

Provinces.=3D--It has been suggested that in some cases the name of a local=
 maker does not=20

necessarily determine, when found on the dial or elsewhere, that such clock=
 has been made by=20

the person whose name it bears. It has also been advanced that the name of =
the owner was=20

sometimes put on the dial. This last theory can be dismissed as being of so=
 infrequent use as to=20

be practically negligible in recording lists of makers. The other conjectur=
e may possibly have=20

sufficient truth in it to disconcert collectors of examples of local crafts=
. Of course, it is a statement=20

that cannot be proved, nor can=20


_
nations, I would compose a very long history; I shall relate all       this=
 however in due time, if God=20

gives me life.  7.7. Here I wish only to quote some few of the words that t=
he lord bishop       of that=20

province now writes to the King: and the date of his letter       is the 20=
th of May, 1541, in which=20

among other words he says thus:  in the eighteenth and early nineteenth cen=
turies, when=20

clockmaking was something more than selling or mending clocks that other pe=
ople made, did not=20

deliberately set up business and, in a small town where secrecy was impossi=
ble, make a practice=20

of putting his name on work he did not execute. That he did not make all th=
e parts himself is=20

admitted.=20
