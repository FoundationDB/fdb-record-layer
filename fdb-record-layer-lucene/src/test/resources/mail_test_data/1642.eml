[Sidenote: MAKING ACQUAINTANCES]  A man may, if he chooses, make acquaintan=
ces on a=20

journey, and a woman also, though with less frequency and freedom. The exig=
encies of travel may=20

sometimes make it pleasant for her to render or receive aid from another wo=
man or possibly a=20

man; and this may be the starting-point for acquaintance. As a usual thing,=
 it is best for a young=20

girl traveling alone, to avoid all communication with strangers, as she can=
 not know into what=20

complications it may lead her.         *       *       *       *       *  [=
