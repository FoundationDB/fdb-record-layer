s came up, however, it was again brought into play, to enable the firemen t=
o get up with their "branches" to the upper windows.  "Try that window, Das=
hwood," said the officer of the station to which Joe belonged, pointing to =
a window on the second floor.  "There ain't much smoke coming _
them, and the ammunition would be a great drawback. This should be divided =
into packets of ten=20

cartridges each, which should be rolled up in flannel and hermetically seal=
ed in separate tin=20

canisters. Thus arranged, they would be impervious to damp, and might be ca=
rried conveniently.=20

But I should decidedly provide myself with four double-barrelled muzzle-loa=
ding No. 10's as my=20

regular battery; that, if first class, would never get out of order. Nothin=
g gives such confidence to=20

the gun-bearers as the fact of their rifles being good slayers, and they qu=
ickly learn to take a pride=20

in their weapons, and to strive in the race to hand the spare rifles. Dust =
storms, such as I have=20

constantly witnessed in Africa, would be terrible enemies to breech-loaders=
, as the hard sand, by=20

grating in the joints, would wear away the metal, and destroy the exactness=
 of the fittings.  A small=20

handy double rifle, such as my little Fletcher 24, not exceeding eight poun=
ds and a half, is very=20

necessary, as it should seldom be out of the hand. Such a rifle should be a=
 breech-loader, as the=20

advantage of loading quickly while on horseback is incalculable. Hunting-kn=
ives should be of soft=20

steel, similar to butchers' knives; but one principal knife to be worn dail=
y should be of harder steel,=20

with the back of the blade roughed and case-hardened like a butcher's steel=
, for sharpening other=20

knives when required.  All boxes for rough travelling should be made of str=
ong metal, japanned.=20

These are a great comfort, as they are proof both against insects and weath=
er, and can be towed=20

with their contents across a river.  Travelling is now so generally underst=
ood, that it is hardly=20

necessary to give any instructions for the exploration of wild countries; b=
ut a few hints may be=20

acceptable upon points that, although not absolutely essential, tend much t=
o the comfort of the=20

traveller. A couple of large carriage umbrellas with double lining, with sm=
all rings fixed to the=20

extremities of the ribs, and a spike similar to that of a fishing-rod to sc=
rew into the handle, will form=20

an instantaneous shelter from sun or rain during a halt on the march, as a =
few strings from the=20

rings will secure it from the wind, if pegged to the ground. Waterproof cal=
ico sheeting should be=20

taken in large quantities, and a tarpaulin to protect the baggage during th=
e night's bivouac. No=20

vulcanised India-rubber should be employed in tropical climates; it rots, a=
nd becomes useless. A=20

quart syringe for injecting brine into fresh meat is very necessary. In hot=
 climates, the centre of the=20

joint will decompose before the salt can penetrate to the interior, but an =
injecting syringe will=20

thoroughly preserve the meat in a few minutes. A few powerful fox-traps are=
 useful for catching=20

night-game in countries where there is no large game for the rifle: also wi=
re is useful for making=20

springs.  Several sticks of Indian-ink are convenient, as sufficient can be=
 rubbed up in a few=20

moments to write up the note-book during the march. All journals and note-b=
ooks should be of=20

tinted paper, green, as the glare of white paper in the intense sunlight of=
 the open sky is most=20

trying to the eyes. Burning glasses and flint and steels are very necessary=
. Lucifer matches are=20

dangerous, as they may ignite and destroy your baggage in dry weather, and =
become utterly=20

useless in the damp.  A large supply of quicksilver should be taken for the=
 admixture with lead for=20

hardening bullets, in addition to that required for the artificial horizon;=
 the effect of this metal is far=20

greater than a mixture of tin, as the specific gravity of the bullet is inc=
reased.  Throughout a long=20

experience in wild sports, although I admire the velocity of conical projec=
tiles, I always have=20

retained my opinion that, in jungle countries, where in the absence of dogs=
 you require either to=20

disable your game on the spot, or to produce a distinct blood-track that is=
 easily followed, the old-

fashioned two-groove belted ball will bag more game than modern bullets; bu=
t, on the other hand,=20

the facility of loading a conical bullet already formed into a cartridge is=
 a great advantage. The=20



shock produced by a pointed projectile is nothing compared to that of the o=
ld belted ball, unless it=20

is on the principle of Purday's high velocity expanding bullet, which, alth=
ough perfection for deer-

shooting, would be useless against thick-skinned animals, such as buffalo a=
nd rhinoceros. In=20

Africa, the variety of game is such, that it is impossible to tell, when lo=
ading, at what animal the=20

bullet will be fired; therefore, it is necessary to be armed with a rifle s=
uitable for all comers. My little=20

Fletcher was the Enfield bore, No. 24, and, although a most trusty weapon, =
the bullets generally=20

failed to penetrate the skull of hippopotami, except in places where the bo=
ne was thin, such as=20

behind the ear, and beneath the eyes. Although I killed great numbers of an=
imals with the Enfield=20

bullet, the success was due to tolerably correct shooting, as I generally l=
ost the larger antelopes if=20

wounded by that projectile in any place but the neck, of this fire in Ladbr=
oke Square was reported=20

"unknown."  Of the other eight, the supposed causes were, in one case, "esc=
ape of gas," in=20

another, "paraffin-lamp upset," in another "intoxication," in another, "spa=
rk from fire," in another,=20

"candle," in another, "children playing with matches," and so on; but in th=
is mansion none of these=20

causes were deemed probable.  The master of the house turned off the gas re=
gularly every night=20

before going to bed, therefore it could not have been caused by escape of g=
as.  Paraffin-lamps=20

were not used in the house.  Candles were; but they were always carefully h=
andled and guarded.=20

As to intoxication, the most suspicious of mortals could not have dreamed o=
f such a cause in so=20

highly respectable a family.  The fires were invariably put out at night, a=
nd guards put on in every=20

room, therefore, no spark could have been so audacious as to have leaped in=
to being and on to=20

the floor.  There were, indeed, "matches" in the house, but there were no c=
hildren, except one old=20

lady, who, having reached her second childhood, might perhaps have been reg=
arded as a child.  It=20

is true there was a certain Betty, a housemaid, whose fingers were reported=
 by the cook to be "all=20

thumbs," and who had an awkward and incurable tendency to spill, and break,=
 and drop, and fall=20

over things, on whom suspicion fastened very keenly at first; but Betty, wh=
o was young and rather=20

pretty, asserted so earnestly that she had been unusually happy that night =
in having done nothing=20

whatever of a condemnable nature, and backed her asseverations with such fl=
oods of tears, that=20

she was exonerated, and, as we have said, the cause was reported "unknown."=
  It was not,=20

however, so completely unknown as was at first supposed. There was a certai=
n grave, retiring,=20

modest individual who knew the gentleman of the house and his doings a litt=
le more thoroughly=20

than was agreeable to the said gentleman, and who had become aware, in some=
 unaccountable=20

way, which it is impossible to explain, that he, the said gentleman, had ve=
ry recently furnished the=20

house in a sumptuous style, and had insured it much beyond its value.  The =
said individual's=20

knowledge ultimately resulted in the said gentleman being convicted and tra=
nsported for arson!=20

But with all this we have nothing to do.  Whatever the uncertainty that aft=
erwards arose as to the=20

cause of the fire, there could be no uncertainty as to the fire itself at t=
he time.  It blazed and roared=20

so furiously, that the inside of the house resembled a white-hot furnace. F=
lames spouted from the=20

windows and chimneys, glaring fiercely on the spectators, who assembled rap=
idly from all=20

quarters, as if defying them all, and daring the firemen to do their worst.=
  Sparks enough to have=20

shamed all the Roman candles ever made in or out of Rome were vomited forth=
 continuously, and=20

whirled away with volumes of dense black smoke into the wintry sky.  "It's =
well alight," observed a=20

chimney-sweep to a policeman.  The policeman made no reply, although it did=
 seem as if it would=20

have been quite safe, even for a policeman, to admit that the sweep was tho=
roughly correct.  It=20



_was_ "well alight," so well, that it seemed absolutely ridiculous to suppo=
se that the firemen could=20

make any impression on it at all.  But the firemen did not appear to think =
the attempt ridiculous.=20

"Never give in" was, or might have been, their motto.  It was their maxim t=
o attack the enemy with=20

promptitude and vigour, no matter what his strength might be.  When he crep=
t out like a sneaking=20

burglar from under a hearth-stone, or through an over-heated flue, they wou=
ld "have at him" with=20

the hand-pumps and quench him at once.  When he came forth like a dashing p=
arty of=20

skirmishers, to devastate a wood-yard, or light up a music-hall with unusua=
l brilliancy, they sent an=20

engine or two against him without delay, and put him down in an hour or two=
.  When he attacked=20

"in force," they despatched engine after engine--manuals and steamers-- to =
the front, until he was=20

quelled, and if the prey already seized could not be wrenched from his gras=
p, they, at all events,=20

killed him before he could destroy more.  When he boldly and openly declare=
d war, attacking the=20

great combustible warehouses of Tooley Street, threatening a descent on the=
 shipping, and almost=20

setting the Thames on fire, they sent out the whole available army from eve=
ry quarter of the=20

metropolis with all their engines of war--manuals, steamers, and floating b=
atteries, or spouteries,=20

and fought him tooth and nail, till he gave in.  They might be terribly ove=
r-matched--as in the case=20

of the great fire when the gallant Braidwood fell--they might lose men, and=
 might have to fight day=20

and night for weeks, but they would "never say die," until the enemy had di=
ed and left them, tired=20

and torn, but still tough and triumphant victors on the field of battle.  B=
efore the engine from=20

Regent Street came on the ground, two manual engines from Kensington and No=
tting Hill had=20

arrived, and opened water on the foe.  At first their shot fell harmlessly =
on the roaring furnace;=20


_
therefore it was next to impossible to follow up the blood-track; thus a la=
rge proportion of wounded=20

animals escaped.  I saw, and shot, thirteen varieties of antelopes while in=
 Africa. Upon arrival at=20

Khartoum, I met Herr von Heuglin, who commanded the expedition in search of=
 Dr. Vogel; he was=20

an industrious naturalist, who had been many years in the Soudan and in Aby=
ssinia. We=20

compared notes of all we had seen and done, and he very kindly supplied me =
with a list of all the=20

antelopes that he had been able to trace as existing in Abyssinia and the S=
oudan; he now=20

included my maarif, which he had never met with, and which he agreed was a =
new species. In=20

effect was beginning to be produced.  When this great gun, so to speak, beg=
an to play, and sent a=20

thick continuous stream through the windows, like an inexhaustible water mi=
trailleuse, clouds of=20

white steam mingled with the black smoke, and varied the aspect of the fire=
, but did not appear to=20

lessen its fury in any degree.  Just then another manual engine dashed into=
 the square at full=20

gallop, and formed up.  Before it had well taken a position, another "steam=
er," with three horses,=20

came swinging round the corner, and fell into the ranks.  The panting steed=
s were unharnessed,=20
