nite extending for about=20

225 square miles; though that which is known as Dartmoor Forest (never a fo=
rest in our accepted=20

meaning of the word) is considerably smaller, having been much encroached u=
pon by tillage and=20

enclosure. There is a further protrusion of granite on the Bodmin Moors, an=
d again as far west as=20

Scilly; while Lundy, in the Bristol Channel, belongs almost entirely to the=
 same formation. Beneath=20

clay, which is worked productively to the south of the moors, ye what we'll=

 down there?'  'There's not=20

much hope there either--for the water's low the now; but we might by chance=
 get a little wind, or=20

there are some broken bits in the stream--  'But you mean with a fly--how c=
ould I throw a fly?' she=20

exclaimed.  'Ye'll never learn younger,' was the quiet answer.  'It there's=
 no change to-morrow I'll=20

take ye up the river myself--and at least ye can get some practice in casti=

Cornwall. The average height of the moorland is about 1500 feet, rising in =
places to a little over=20

2000. This elevation is exceeded in Wales, in the Lake District, and in Sco=
tland; and nowhere=20

does Dartmoor appear actually mountainous, one reason being that the platea=
u from which we=20

view its chief eminences is always well over 1000 feet above sea level, and=
 thus a great portion of=20

the height is not realized. But we realize it to some extent when we notice=
 the speed of the=20

moorland rivers; they do not linger and dally like Midland streams, they ru=
n and dash and make a=20

perpetual music of their motion. In winter they are strong enough to make p=
laythings of the rough=20

lichened boulders that confront their course; and in the hottest summers th=
ey never run dry--the=20

mother-breast of Dartmoor has always ample nourishment. Though there is a l=
essening in the=20

body of the rivers, and perhaps a surface-drought of the bogs, the moors ar=
e never really parched;=20

drovers from the Eastern counties sometimes bring their flocks hither in a =
summer of great heat, to=20

feed on Dartmoor turfs when their own home-pastures would be arid. Yet the =
central moor is more=20

like a desolate waste than a pasture. Its rugged turfy surface is scattered=
 with small and large=20

fragments of granite, sometimes "clitters" of weather-worn boulders, someti=
mes masses that look=20

as though prehistoric giants had been playing at bowls. Often strange and f=
antastic in shape, as=20

twilight steals on, or the weird gloom of moorland fog, they seem to become=
 animated; they are=20

pixies, brownies, the ghosts of old vanished peoples; wherever we gaze they=
 start before us;=20

prying figures seem to be hiding behind them, ill-wishing us, or eager to l=
ure us into desolate=20

solitudes. The wind sighs with solitary tone through the rough grasses and =
tussocks; at this height=20

its evening breath is chill even in summer. Some of the stones are shattere=
d monuments of dead=20

men; some perhaps had a religious significance that the world has forgotten=
. The loneliness of the=20

moor is often a charm, but it can become oppressive and terrible if our moo=
d is not buoyant. In=20

places like these the strongest mind might yield to superstition. We seem t=
o be in a region of the=20

primal world, where ploughshare has never passed nor kindly grain sprung fo=
rth for the=20

nourishment of man.    [Illustration: WISTMAN'S WOOD                  (_Pag=
e 13_)]  But we he--and=20

she understood by his manner that he was 'putting his foot down,' in which =
case she knew she=20

might just as well give in at once. 'But I warn ye that it's a dour river a=
t the best, and not likely to be=20

in good ply; however, we might just happen on one.'  And then he added, by =
way of explanation, 'If=20

we should, it will have to be sent to Lord Ailine, ye understand.'  'Why?' =
 'Because the river doesna=20

belong to your fishing; it goes with the shooting.'  'Oh,' said she, somewh=
at coldly.  'And so, when=20

Lord Ailine gives any one a day's fishing he claims whatever fish they may =
catch?'  'When his=20

lordship gives a day's fishing he does not; but when the keeper does--that'=
s different,' was the=20

perfectly simple and respectful answer.  'Oh, I beg your pardon,' said she =
hastily, and sincerely=20

hoping she had said nothing to wound his feelings. Apparently she had not, =
for he proceeded to=20

warn her about the necessity of her putting on a thick pair of boots; and h=
e also gently hinted that=20

she might wear on her head something less conspicuous than the bright orang=
e Tam o' Shanter of=20

which she seemed rather fond.  Accordingly, next morning, instead of sendin=
g him a message that=20

she was ready, she walked along to the cottage, accoutred for a thorough st=
iff day's work.  The=20

outer door was open, so she entered without ceremony; and then tapped at th=
e door of the little=20

parlour, which she proceeded to open also.  She then found that Ronald was =
not alone; there was=20

a young man sitting there, who instantly rose as she made her appearance. S=
he had but a=20

momentary glimpse of him, but she came to the conclusion that the gamekeepe=
rs in this part of=20



the world were a good-looking race, for this was a strongly-built young fel=
low, keen and active,=20

apparently, with a rather pink and white complexion, closely-cropped head, =
bright yellow=20

moustache, and singularly clear blue eyes.  He wore a plain tweed suit; and=
 as he rose he picked=20

up a billycock hat that was lying on the table.  'I'll see you to-night, Ro=
nald,' said he, 'I'm going off=20

by the mail again to-morrow.'  And as he passed by Miss Carry, he said, ver=
y modestly and=20

respectfully--  'I hope you will have good sport.'  'Thank you,' said she, =
most civilly, for he seemed=20

a well-mannered young man, as he slightly bowed to her in passing, and made=
 his way out.=20

Ronald had everything ready for the start.  'I'm feared they'll be=20


_
England; for these we must go to Kent's Cavern, Torquay, or to Brixham, not=
 to the moors. Tokens=20

of habitation on Dartmoor only begin with Neolithic times, and are by no me=
ans continuous. At one=20

time there must have been a thick population; but Celt and Saxon have left =
little trace on the=20

moors, and the Romans none at all. Though the Celts may have conquered the =
Iberian tribes=20

here, they probably neither exterminated nor entirely dispossessed them. Th=
ey were content with=20

the fringes of the wilderness, leaving the rest to the mists, the wolves, a=
nd the lingering older race.=20

It was man of the New Stone Age who first peopled this upland, leaving rema=
ins of his hut-

dwellings, his pounds, dolmens, and menhirs, his kistvaens and his cooking-=
holes. Numerous as=20

the remains are still, they were once far more so; they have been broken up=
 or carted away for=20

road-mending, for gateposts and threshold stones, for building, for "new-ta=
ke" or other walls, and=20

for any other purpose to which granite can be applied. This central highlan=
d may have become a=20

refuge of the later Stone-men against invaders of better equipment: all the=
 day,' said he, as he put=20

his big fly-book in his pocket.  'And there's been no rain to let the fish =
get up.'  'Oh I don't mind=20

about that,' said she, as he held the door open, and she went out, 'it will=
 be more interesting than=20

the lake.  However, I've nothing to say against the lake fishing, for it ha=
s done such wonders for=20

my father.  I have not seen him so well for years.  Whether it is the quiet=
 life, or the mountain air, I=20

don't know, but he sleeps perfectly, and he has entirely given up the bromi=
de of potassium.  I do=20

hope he will take the shooting and come back in the autumn.'  'His lordship=
 was saying there were=20

two other gentlemen after it,' remarked Ronald significantly.  'Who was say=
ing?'  'His lordship--that=20

was in the house the now when ye came in.'  'Was that Lord Ailine?' she sai=
d--and she almost=20

paused in their walk along the road.  'Oh yes.'  'You don't say!  Why, how =
did he come here?'  'By=20

the mail this morning.'  'With the country people?'  'Just like anybody els=
e,' he said.  'Well, I=20

declare!  I thought he would have come with a coach and outriders--in state=
, you know----'  'What=20

for?' said he=20


_
borders, defensive against an external enemy; within is no sign of anything=
 but peaceful pastoral=20

occupation and tin-streaming.  Place names, of field or of farm, enable us =
to infer the former=20

existence of primitive relics: wherever there is a Shilstone (shelf stone) =
or a Bradstone (broad=20

stone) we may be sure there was once a dolmen or cromlech; wherever there i=
s a Langstone or=20

Longstone we guess at a menhir or standing-stone. These early inhabitants o=
f the bag and a=20

waterproof.  It's different in the autumn, of course, when all the gentleme=
n come up, and there's=20

luggage and the rifles and the cartridge-boxes--then they have to have a br=
ake or a waggonette.'=20

'And that was Lord Ailine,' she said, half to herself; and there was no fur=
ther speaking between=20

them until they had gone past the Doctor's cottage and over the bridge and =
were some distance=20

up 'the strath that Mudal laves'--to quote her companion's own=20


_
built themselves low circular huts, generally clustered within pounds (encl=
osures whose chief=20

purpose here seems to have been the protection of cattle; some of the pound=
s were clearly for=20

cattle alone). At Grimspound, near Hookner Tor, are traces of twenty-four h=
uts, enclosed in a=20

double wall 1500 feet in circumference. The huts had low doorways, and usua=
lly  'Now,' said he,=20

as he stooped and began to put together the slender grilse-rod, 'we'll just=
 let ye try a cast or two on=20

this bit of open grass--and we'll no trouble with a fly as yet.'  He fasten=
ed on the reel, got the line=20

through the rings, and drew out a few yards' length.  Then he gave her the =
rod; showed her how to=20

hold it; and then stood just behind her, with=20


_
hearthstones and cooking-holes. The food to be cooked was placed in the hol=
e, sometimes in a=20

coarse clay pot, sometimes without, together with red-hot stones from the h=
earth. Near Postbridge=20

as many as fifteen pounds can be traced, while at Whit Tor are other numero=
us traces. Those at=20

Grimspound evidently belong to the Bronze Age; like different periods of ar=
chitecture, the Stone=20

and Metal Ages very much overlapped.  At first the burial  'Now,' said he, =
'keep your left hand just=20

about as steady as ye can--and don't jerk--this way--  Of course it was rea=
lly he who was making=20

these few preliminary casts, and each time the line ran out and fell straig=
ht and trembling on the=20

grass.  'Now try it yourself.'  At first she made a very bad job of it--esp=
ecially when she tried to do it=20

by main force; the line came curling down not much more than the rod's leng=
th in front of her,=20
