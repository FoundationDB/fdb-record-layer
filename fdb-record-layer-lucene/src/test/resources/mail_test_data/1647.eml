philodendron monstera don't need me," declared Fred Hatfield, doggedly.  "I don't believe a mother ever had so many children that she didn't sorely miss the one who was absent," declared Mr. behaved in the most princely manner; nothing could be more gratifying," Lord Lindores said.

"I don't believe a mother ever had so many children that she didn't sorely miss the one who was absent," declared Mr. behaved in the most princely manner; nothing could be more gratifying," Lord Lindores said.  Carry sat motionless in her chair, and took no notice--her white hands clasped _
mess of gruel, for I believe he's hungry."  "Who is he, Aunt Alviry?" asked the gentleman. Aunt 

Alvirah Boggs was "everybody's Aunt Alviry," although she really had no living kin, and Mr. Jabez 

Potter had brought her from the almshouse ten years or more before to act as his housekeeper. 

"Dunno," said Aunt Alvirah, shaking her head in answer to Mr. Cameron's question. "Ain't the first 

idee. You kin go in and talk to him, sir."  With the wallet in his hand and the three young folk at his 

heels, both their interest and their curiosity aroused, Mr. Cameron went into the passage and so 

came to the open door of the bedroom. Mr. Potter slept in a big, four-post bedstead, which was 

heaped high at this time of year with an enormous feather bed. Rolled like a mummy in the 

blankets, and laid on this bed, the feathers had plumped up about the vagabond boy and almost 

buried him. But his eyes were wide open--pale blue eyes, with light lashes and eyebrows, which 

gave his thin, white countenance a particularly blank expression.  Then Lord Lindores came in with 

much subdued dignity of demeanour, like an ambassador approaching a crowned head. He went 

up to Carry, who lay back in a great easy-chair beside the fire with her hands clasped, pursuing 

the thoughts which she was not permitted to express, and gave her a formal kiss on the forehead: 

not that he was cold or unsympathetic as a father, but he had been a little afraid of her since her 

marriage, and she had not welcomed the condolences he had addressed to her when he saw her 

first after Tinto's death.  "My dear," he said, "this is not a moment for congratulations: and yet there 

is something to a woman in having earned the entire confidence of her husband, which must be a 

subject of satisfaction----"  Carry scarcely moved in her stillness. She looked at him without 

understanding what he meant. "It would be better, perhaps," she said, "father, not to speak of the 

circumstances."  "I hope I am not likely to speak in a way that could wound your feelings, Carry. 

Poor Patrick--has done you noble

name is Jonas Hatfield, of Scarboro; is it?"  "No; sir; that was my father's name, sir," returned the 

boy in bed, weakly. "My name is Fred."  And then a brilliant flush suddenly colored his pale face. 

He half started up in bed, and the pale blue eyes flashed with an entirely different expression. He 

demanded, in a hoarse, unnatural voice:  "How'd' you find me out?"  Mr. Cameron shook his head 

knowingly, and laughed.  "That was a bit of information you were keeping to yourself--eh? Well, 

why did you carry your father's old wallet about with you, if you did not wish to be identified? 

Come, son!  A hysterical desire to laugh seized poor Lady Car. Lord Lindores himself was a little 

confused by the name he had coined on the spot for his dead son-in-law. He had felt that to call 

him Torrance would be cold, as his wish was to express the highest approval; and Pat was too 

familiar. But his "Poor Patrick" was not successful. And Carry knew that, even in the midst of her 

family, she must not laugh that day, whatever might happen. She stopped herself convulsively, but 

cried, "Papa, for heaven's sake, don't talk to me any more!"  "Do you not see, Robert, that she is 

exhausted?" said Lady 


_
our knowing who you are?"  Fred Hatfield sank back in the feathers and weakly rolled his head 

from side to side. The blood receded from his cheeks, leaving him quite as pale as before. He 

whispered:  "I ran away."  "Yes. That's what I supposed," said Mr. Cameron, easily. "What for?"  "I-

-I "She thinks nothing of the will. She is worn out with--all she has had to go through. Let her alone 

till she has had time to recover a little."  His wife's interposition always irritated Lord Lindores. "I 

may surely be permitted to speak to Carry without an interpreter," he said, testily. 


_
"What did you do?"  "I didn't say I did anything. I just got sick of it up there, and came away," the 

boy said, sullenly.  "Your father is dead?" asked the gentleman, shrewdly.  "Yes, sir."  "Got a 

mother?"  "Yes, sir."  "Doesn't she need you?"  "No, sir."  "Why not?"  "She's got Ez, and Peter, 

and 'Lias to work the farm. They're all could make up----Torrance has behaved nobly, poor fellow! 

It must be gratifying to us all to see the confidence he had in her. You have the control of 

everything during your boy's minority, Carry. Everything is in your hands. Of course it was 

understood that you would have the support of your family. But you are hampered by no 

conditions:
