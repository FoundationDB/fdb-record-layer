philodendron monstera together here and now a number of them are lying "som=
ewhere in France."  The jam-making firm of Tickler was awarded a huge contr=
act for the supply of "Tommy's" daily four ounces of jam; either plum and a=
pple were the cheapest combination or else the crop of these two fruits mus=
t have been enormous, because every single tin of jam that went to the  _Pr=
ehnite_--in greenstone, Deerfield, encrusting the columns and in radiated m=
asses, but rarely crystallized. The veins of it, when in place, are nearly =
perpendicular.  _Zeolite_--in same place, not abundant. Some good specimens=
 of the radiated variety are found.  _Chabasie_--in same place, considerabl=
y abundant. No crystals have yet been found whose philodendron monstera tog=
ether here and now a number of them are lying "somewhere in France."  The j=

mmy's" daily four ounces of jam; either plum and apple were the cheapest co=
mbination or else the crop of these two fruits must have been enormous, bec=
ause every single tin of jam that went to the  _Prehnite_--in greenstone, D=

--in same place, not abundant. Some good specimens of the radiated variety =
are found.  _Chabasie_--in same place, considerably abundant. No crystals h=
ave yet been found whose _
they become moulded to the feet they are fine. Of course they are not prett=
y, but they keep the=20

wet out.  We have had new tunics issued to us of the regular English patter=
n, much more=20

comfortable than our other original ones, and then instead of the hard cap =
we now have a soft=20

one, something like a big golf cap with the flap on to pull down over the e=
ars. These are much=20

more comfortable. They have one great advantage over the old kind--we can s=
leep in them. We=20

can now lie down in our complete outfits even to our hats. Once I considere=
d it a hardship to sleep=20

in my clothes. Now to go to bed we don't undress; we put on clothes.  I man=
aged to get a pass to=20

Salisbury on Saturday and went to the local vaudeville show. In the row in =
front of me were several=20

young officers of the British Army, and it was striking what a clean-cut lo=
t they were. England is=20

certainly giving of her best. They were not very much different from any ot=
hers, but at the same=20

time they are the type of Englishmen who have done things in the past and w=
ill do things again.=20

They are  _Amethyst_--in Greenstone, Deerfield: the colour is not deep, but=
 delicate.=20

_Chalcedony_--in same place--considerably abundant, but generally in small =
masses.=20

_Carnelian_--in same place, not plenty. The chalcedony, in some specimens, =
seems to be passing=20

into cacholong, and the carnelian into sardonyx.  _Agate_--in same place. I=
t is made up of=20

chalcedony, carnelian, and quartz. They are generally small, but some are e=
legant.  _Jasper_, red,=20

and yellow--found in rolled masses on the banks of Deerfield river and in L=
eyden. Some have=20

been found imperfectly striped. It occurs frequently as it was formed by th=
e aboriginals into barbs=20

for pikes and arrows.  _Petrosilex_--on the banks of Deerfield river--not g=
ood specimens.=20

_Feldspar_--the red variety occurs in puddingstone, Deerfield. It is not ne=
cessary to mention any=20

other locality of a mineral so common.  _Hornblende_--very abundant--mostly=
 black in this vicinity.=20

_Mica_--this is very abundant on the east side of Connecticut river. Some c=
rystals of it have been=20

found in Amherst.  _Talc_--in=20


_
Kitchener's Army. Thousands of men who have never been in the army before t=
hrew up everything=20

to go in the ranks. You see side by side professors, laborers, lawyers, doc=
tors, stevedores,=20

carters, all classes, rich and poor, a great democratic army, drilling to f=
ight so that this may be a=20

decent world to live in.  At present it is almost impossible to use each ma=
n in his own profession=20

as they do in Germany, but sometimes the non-commissioned officers work it =
out in this way.=20

Sergeant to squad of recruits:--  "Henybody 'ere know anythink abart cars?"=
  "Yes; I do. I own a=20

Rolls Royce."  "Olright; fall out and clean the major's motor bike."  One p=
atriotic mother who had a=20

son who was a butcher did her best to get him to join the Royal Army Medica=
l Corps, because he=20

was proficient at cutting up meat and would feel quite at home assisting at=
 amputations.=20

-------------------------------------  Now that we are approaching the time=
 for our departure to France we=20

are hearing that favorite farewell to all men going to the front, "Good-bye=
, I'll look every day for=20

your name in the casualty list."  The "Princess Pats" have already been in =
action. They had a hard=20

fight and many of them have been put out of business. We envied them when t=
hey went away and=20

still do, although it only seems yesterday that we were lying  _Steatite._ =
The localities of this are=20

seen on the section. The aboriginals formed many articles from this mineral=
, as pots, pipes, &c.=20

_Chlorite_--in Shutesbury: also in amygdaloid, Deerfield. In Deerfield acad=
emy there are some=20

Indian pipes of this mineral, well wrought.  _Green Earth_--in small quanti=
ties, in amygdaloid,=20

Deerfield.  _Schorl_--the black variety occurs in Pelham, Shutesbury, and O=
range, Mass., and in=20

Brattleborough, Vermont.  _Epidote_--in Deerfield, Shutesbury, Leyden, and =
Pelham, and in Athol,=20

Worcester county. The specimens poor.  _Tremolite_--in the west part of Ley=
den, near Green=20

river. The rock in this region is chiefly mica slate, and the quantity of t=
remolite is very great. Tons=20

of it might be easily collected.  _Cyanite_, or _Sappare_--in Deerfield, in=
 mica slate; discovered by=20

Dr. S. W. Williams.  _Actynolite_--rare, found in Shutesbury.  _Serpentine_=
--found in Leyden in=20

rolled masses. Some of the specimens admit a fine polish, and the ground is=
 handsomely=20

variegated. It has not been noticed _in situ_.  _Asbestus_--compact, in Pel=
ham.  _Garnets_--very=20

plenty in Conway, Deerfield, Shelburne, &c. Good specimens of the melanite =
occur in Conway.=20

_Native Alum_--in Leyden, in small quantities, efflorescing on argillaceous=
 slate.  _Sulphur_--in=20

Conway, Shelburne, and Warwick, efflorescing on mica=20
