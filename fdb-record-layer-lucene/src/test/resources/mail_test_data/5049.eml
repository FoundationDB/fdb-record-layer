some good news: what is it? "The Allies have attacked; the front between Soissons and Chateau 

Thierry is all crumpled up: the Germans cannot hold the salient."  Smash after smash: it is our turn 

now; in Flanders, in Picardy, in Champagne, in Lorraine: by Britain, by France, by America, singly, 

doubly, and all together; each day a new victory headlined; the military lines approaching the 

French boundary; the thumbtacks moved each day on the war maps; St. Mihiel salient wiped out; 

Rheims freed of bombardment; Argonne Wood, our present day battle of the wilderness, takes 

time and its awful toll of human lives, but yields, for the first time in history, to an attack by 

American troops; Grand Pr and open country beyond. Forward again, until a great railroad line is 

cut, and Sedan, the catastrophe of 1870, becomes the final triumph of 1918. How we watched the 

telegraphic bulletins! How we studied the maps! Until, after one false report of an armistice, the 

real armistice came, and our peace-loving people, joint victors in the greatest war of all time, 

turned into a horde of lunatics.  What a day it was, that eleventh of November! I was in Boston to 

attend the wedding of a nephew, a Colonel of Artillery, who had commanded his regiment at 

Cantigny and had later been ordered to this country in connection with organization and training of 

troops. The guests had to walk, as no vehicle could thread the crowd. Late editions of the papers 

contained the armistice terms in full, and, as our somewhat numerous family was gathered for five 

o'clock tea, one member was deputed to read the terms aloud, and there were attentive listeners. 

After he had finished, no one spoke for a moment; and then a voice said, "That seems to cover the 

ground."  Truly we have much to thank God for, this Fourth of July. We have left undone some 

things that we ought to have done, and we have done some things that we ought not to have 

done; but I cannot say now that there is no health in us. Once again we have had a new birth of 

freedom; once again are kept, and indulged so much, that they cannot be taken abroad to search 

their Physick; while those of the larger kind take their way abroad, in the Mornings, at their 

pleasure. This, Sir, I send you with some other Receipts, because Dogs are not a little useful 

about a Farm, and the little ones are no less agreeable to their Keepers. And I am sure, if you 

publish these, they will prove very acceptable to many Ladies, and Gentlemen, who are Admirers 

of these faithful Creatures.     _I am, &c._     J. L.     _Lisbon_ or _Portugal-Cakes._ From the

Mix this with a Pound of fine Flour; then rub into these a Pound of fresh or new Butter, till your 

Sugar and Flour looks like Bread-Crumbs; then add, two or three spoonfulls of Orange-Flower-

Water, and about ten spoonfuls of Canary-Wine: then beat ten Eggs, till their Whites are whipt to 

Snow, and mix the Eggs, with the rest, with a quarter of a Pound of blanched Almonds beaten in a 

Marble Mortar, with some Orange-Flower Water; and when you have butter'd your Pans well, fill 

them half full with this Mixture, and bake them, if you make them without Currans, or else fill the 

Pans fuller, first plumping the Currans, which should be in proportion, as you please.    _Imperial 

Florentine._ From _Mr. Byecorf_ at _Augsburgh._  Cut the leanest part of a Leg of Veal, in thin 

Slices, and beat them with the Back of a Knife, as you would do _Scots_ Collups; then season the 

Cutlets with Cloves, Pepper beaten fine to powder, some Pepper and Salt, with some Nutmeg 

grated, a little dry'd sweet Marjoram powder'd, or some sweet Basil. Lay this Mixture pretty thick 

upon them, and roll them up with a little Piece of fat Bacon, in the middle; then lay in your Paste to 

the Dish, and over the Bottom strew a little Pepper, Salt, and Nutmeg, with some Balls of farced 

Meat, with bits of Butter, placed here and there. Put in then your rolls of Veal, with some Cocks-

Be Considered in Injunction Case_.   [NOTE--The following case on picketing is so important, 

being the latest and a final decision of the highest Court in the United States on a matter which 

has been treated differently by various Courts, that we reproduce the opinion here, as published in 

the "New York Times."--EDITOR].   TAFT, Ch. Justice: This is a picketing case. Only two men in 

the employ of the Foundries had responded to the calling of the strike by the Tri-City Council. They 

were picketers, were defendants, and were enjoined. Only one of them was a member of a union 

of that council. The case involves, as to them, the application of Section 20 of the Clayton Act, of 

which the provisions material here are those which forbid an injunction in behalf of Mortar, with as 

much Fat of the Kidney of Veal; and then put some Pepper, Salt, Cloves, Nutmeg, Powder of dry'd 

sweet Marjoram, and some Mushrooms, chopt as you please; then add as many Eggs, beaten as 

you think proper, with some grated Bread, to make it into a Paste, and roll this Mixture into Balls. 

Some instead of the Kidney-Fat of Veal, will chop the same quantity of fat Bacon.    To make a 

Tart of white _Beet-Cards._ From the same.  Take some white Beet-Cards, (or Leaves) as much 

Spinach-Leaves, and the same quantity of _French_ Sorrel, which has a round Leaf. Chop these 

small, or if you beat them all together in a Marble Mortar, it is better; then strain out the Juice, and 

put it amongst the same proportion, or quantity, of the same Herbs, fresh cut, that is, put the
