courtiers, argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which D'Artagnan wo=

accomplishment of her project. It was one of the Gascon's artifices to hide=
 his deep cunning=20

occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty.  "Has the queen any furt=

around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him. But it was=
 so placed on the=20

desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed.  "You come from the qu=
