 country.  One of the=20

largest rivers on the American continent, with many important tributaries, =
it drains a territory equal=20

to five times the area of the state of Washington. By a series of cataracts=
, falls, cascades, and=20

bold turns, it flows nearly 1,400 miles with a total drop of 2,500 feet, be=
fore finally delivering the=20

waters gathered from many sources to the great Pacific ocean.  Like other g=
reat rivers, some=20

portions have needed vast expenditures to increase its value as a navigable=
 stream. Near=20

Stevenson the government has built locks at a cost of several million dolla=
rs, enabling large=20

vessels to reach The Dalles, at present the head of navigation. At Celilo, =
two hundred miles from=20

its mouth, where, in twelve miles distance, the river falls eighty-one feet=
 at low tide, other locks are=20

being constructed. When these are completed, merchant vessels can go direct=
 from the sea as far=20

as Priest Rapids, a distance of over four hundred miles. As many miles addi=
tional are navigable,=20

but broken in places by rapids and falls.  [Illustration: INDIAN CANOE RACE=
.]  Important as this=20

river is from a commercial and geographic standpoint, the greatest interest=
 by far centers in the=20

phenomena that are of its own creation, visible every mile from its mouth t=
o its source. A journey=20

upon its surface rivals one along the historic Rhine, the picturesque Hudso=
n, or the beautiful St.=20

Lawrence. The panorama includes besides the wilder grandeurs, economic scen=
es suggesting the=20

fecundity of the earth and the industry of the husbandman. To enumerate and=
 describe these ever=20

so briefly would require an entire volume. This short chapter is a suggesti=

  "Is that better?" she=20

 one big tear on=20

Tony's cheek.  "It's nice and cool, that stuff. _Why_ does it hurt so, Aunt=
ie Jan? It looks so kind=20

and pretty."  "It is kind and pretty, only we mustn't go too near. Will you=
 be sure and tell Fay how it=20

can hurt?"  "I'll _tell_ her," he promised, but he didn't seem to have much=
 hope of the news acting=20

as a deterrent.  When at bed-time Jan announced that Tony could not possibl=
y bathe Fay because=20

he mustn't get his hand wet or disturb the dressing, she and Meg tremblingl=
y awaited the awful=20

fuss that seemed bound to follow.  But Fay was always unexpected. "Then Med=
 muss wass me,"=20

she remarked calmly. The good custom was established and Meg began to perk =
up again.=20

 only way to make=20

liked paying the books=20

herself, for she always suspected Jan of not counting the change.  Jan was =
alone in the flat and=20

was laying tea for the children in the dining-room when "ting" went the ele=
ctric bell. She opened=20

the door to find upon the threshold an exceedingly tall young man; a well-s=
et-up, smart young man=20

with square shoulders, who held out his hand to her, saying in a friendly v=
oice: "You may just=20

happen to remember me, Miss Ross, but probably not. Colonel Walcote's my un=
cle, and he's living=20



in your house, you know. My name's Middleton ... I _hope_ you remember me, =
for I've come to=20

ask a favour."  As he spoke he gave Jan his card, and on it was "Captain Mi=
les Middleton, R. H.=20

A.," and the addresses of two clubs.  She led him to the little drawing-roo=
m, bracing herself the=20

while to be firm in her refusal if the Walcotes wanted the house any longer=
, good tenants though=20

they were.  She was hopelessly vague about her guest, but felt she had met =
him somewhere. She=20

didn't like to confess how slight her recollection was, for he looked so bi=
g and brown and friendly it=20

seemed unkind.  He sat down, smoothed his hat, and then with an engaging sm=

vaguely. "What dog?"  "Well, he's my dog at present, but I want him to be y=
