M.A.    HIS SECOND WIFE  CHAPTER I  On a train speeding toward New York, in=
 one of the=20

parlour cars two young women sat facing each other, talking and smiling, de=
eply absorbed. They=20

took little apparent notice of any one else in the car, but most of the peo=
ple near them kept=20

throwing curious glances their way.  These glances differed vastly, as did =
the thoughts behind=20

them. A tall, genial Westerner, who looked as though he had come from a ran=
ch, smiled frankly=20

and hungrily on the pair and told himself with emphasis, "Those two girls a=
re fifty-fifty. I'd like a=20

dozen of each brand." And a slim college boy with fresh, eager eyes kept da=
rting quick looks from=20

time to time at the older of the two, the blonde. He asked himself confused=
ly, "How'd I start in with=20

a woman like her?" And exciting pictures rose in his mind. In the meantime =
an elderly lady, with a=20

sharp, inquisitive air, had put down the ages of the girls at twenty-two an=
d thirty.  "They're sisters,"=20

she decided, but then she nearly changed her mind. They were such recording=
 his diploma in the=20

office of the judge of probate of the county (_ib._, s. 1,298).  A license =
issued by the last-

mentioned board must be recorded in the office of the judge of probate of t=
he county (_ib._, s.=20

1,299). The license or diploma, after record, is evidence of authority; if =
the original be lost, a=20

certified copy of the record is sufficient evidence (_ib._, s. 1,300). With=
out a certificate of=20

qualification from the board provided for in sec. 1,301, except as above pr=
ovided, no person can=20

lawfully practise medicine in any of its branches or departments as a profe=
ssion or means of=20

livelihood (_ib._, s. 1,302). The standard of qualification, method or syst=
em, and subjects of=20

examination are prescribed by the medical association of the State (_ib._, =
s. 1,303).  The board of=20

medical examiners, on application, must examine an applicant for a certific=
ate of qualification as a=20

practitioner of medicine, and if he be found qualified, and of good moral c=
haracter must issue a=20

certificate (_ib._, s. 1,304).  Physicians having a license as above before=
 the organization in a=20

county of a board, are on application thereto entitled to a certificate wit=
hout examination and to be=20

registered as licensed practitioners of medicine (_ib._, s. 1,305).  The ce=
rtificate is a license=20

throughout the State. It must be recorded in the office of the judge of pro=
bate of the county in=20

which the person resides at the time of issue. Upon recording it, the judge=
 must indorse a=20

certificate of record and sign it and affix the seal of the court (_ib._, s=
. 1,306). Such certificate, or, if=20

lost, a certified copy of the record, is evidence (_ib._, s. 1,307).  PENAL=
TY.=E2=80=94A contract for the=20



services of a physician or surgeon is void unless he has authority to pract=
ise; proof of authority is=20

not required at trial except on two days=E2=80=99 notice (_ib._, s. 1,318).=
  Practising medicine or surgery=20

without a certificate is a misdemeanor under a penalty of a fine of from $2=
5 to $100. This provision=20

is not applicable to physicians practising medicine in Alabama in 1890, who=
 are graduates of a=20

respectable medical college and have complied with the law by having their =
diplomas recorded by=20

the judge of probate in the county where they practise; nor to a physician =
who has practised in the=20

State for the past five years (Act 1890-91, c. 376);=20


_
and moneyed elegance, with carefully undulated hair, a rounded bust, and pr=
etty features smooth=20

and plump, with a retrousse nose and rich, full lips, and a manner of easy =
assurance. The brunette=20

was younger and less developed, slim and lithe, her curling black hair rebe=
llious, her features=20

more clean-cut and clear, with wide, eager lips and warm brown eyes set wid=
e apart.=20

"Nevertheless, they are sisters," the little lady firmly concluded. "The fa=
mily resemblance is quite=20

unmistakable." And frowning in perplexity, "But if they are sisters," she w=
ent on, "why is only one=20

in mourning?" She looked at the younger of the practising midwifery (Code 1=
887, s. 1,308).=20

FEES.=E2=80=94The statutory fees are as follows:  To judge of probate, for =
record of diploma, or license or=20

certificate, $1 (_ib._, s. 1,298, 1,299, 1,306).  To board of medical exami=
ners, for examination,=20

actual expenses (_ib._, s. 1,304).   ARIZONA.  QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94It is=
 unlawful for any person to=20

practise medicine, surgery, or other obstetrics unless he have a diploma re=
gularly issued by a=20

medical college lawfully organized under the laws of the State wherein it i=
s located, or a license=20

issued and authorized by a board of medical examiners under and by virtue o=
f the laws of any=20


_
in black; and then at the blonde, whose sable cloak put back from her shoul=
ders revealed a stylish=20

travelling suit. "And why is one rich and the other poor?"  Meanwhile a you=
ng woman nearby, with=20

a fat, discontented face, regarded the blonde with envy and thought:  "She'=
s an actress with her=20

maid. Why can't Harry allow me a maid, a real clever one like that? Men see=
 these actresses on=20

the stage and get to expecting things from their wives--without being willi=
ng to pay for it! Think=20

what that girl could make of me!"  A quiet, able-looking woman sitting just=
 Territory. The diploma=20

must state that the person named is qualified to practise medicine and surg=
ery in all of its=20

departments (Penal Code, 1887, s. 617, as amended Act of April 11th, 1893).=
  A diploma granted=20

for moneyed consideration or other article of value alone, or revoked or ca=
ncelled by the college=20

by which it was issued or by act of the legislature, is not a sufficient qu=
alification (_ib._, s. 618).=20
