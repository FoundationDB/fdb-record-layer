teamer, and a few minutes later a cloud of _
the light of the softly shaded hall lantern served to heighten the artistic=
 effect of her red house-

gown, stood a woman--a lady, and evidently the mistress of the Georgian man=
sion. She was small=20

and dark, with brown eyes that were almost childlike in their winsomeness; =
a woman who might be=20

twenty, or thirty, or any age between. Beautiful she was not, Blount decide=
d, comparing her=20

instantly, as he did all women, with Patricia Anners; but--He was not given=
 time to add the=20

qualifying phrase or to prepare himself for what was coming.  "What is it, =
Barto?" the little lady=20

asked, turning to the man with the gun.  The reply was direct and straight =
to the purpose.  "Excuse=20

_me_; but I jest wanted to ask if you know this here young feller. He's bee=
n allowin' to me th't he=20

is--"  "Of course," she said quickly, and stepping forward she gave her han=
d and a welcome to the=20

dazed one. "Please come in; we have been expecting you." Then again to the =
man with the not=20

open wide its gates to those who fell in the commission of crime.  The boat=
 lost its headway, and=20

became motionless at a distance of twenty feet from the Maud, with the rifl=
es still pointed at its=20

crew. If the pirate chief had a revolver in his pocket, this was the time t=
o use it; but he did not even=20

produce it. He could not help seeing that if he fired a shot, it would imme=
diately cause half a dozen=20

bullets to be sent into the boat; and he had good reason to believe that he=
 would himself be the=20

first victim.  "What are you about?" he demanded in angry tones.  "About to=
 fire if you come any=20

nearer," replied Captain Scott.  "Can't you see that we are unarmed? Do you=
 mean to shoot us=20

down like dogs?"  "That depends upon you, Captain Mazagan. But you are so v=
ery polite while=20

you act as a pirate, that I think it is proper for me to say, with your per=
mission, that my crew can=20

fire thirty-six balls without stopping to load again. If you persist in=20


_
Barto, for showing the gentleman the way to Wartrace Hall."  It was all don=
e so quietly that Blount=20

was still unconsciously holding the hand of welcoming while his late captor=
s were riding away=20

down the cottonwood-shaded avenue. When he realized what he was doing he wa=
s as nearly=20

embarrassed as a self-contained young lawyer could well be. But his impromp=
tu hostess quickly=20

set him at ease.  "You needn't make any explanations," she hastened to say,=
 smiling up at him=20

and gently disengaging the hand which he was only now remembering that he h=
ad forgotten to=20

relinquish. "Naturally, I inferred that you were in trouble, and that your =
safety depended in some=20

sense upon my answer. Were you in trouble?"  Blount perceived immediately h=
ow utterly=20

impossible it would be to make her, or any one else, understand the boyish =
impulse which had=20

prompted him to leave his train, or the curious difficulty into which the i=
mpulse had precipitated=20

him. So his explanation scarcely explained.  "I was on my way to a ranch--t=
hat is, to the capital--

when these men held me up," he stammered. "They--they mistook me for some o=
ne else, I think,=20

and for reasons best known to themselves they brought me here. If you could=
 direct me to some=20

place where I can get a night's lodging--"  "There is nothing like a tavern=
 within twenty miles of=20

here," she broke in; "nor is there any house within that radius which would=
 refuse you a night's=20

shelter, Mr.--"  Blount made a quick dive for his card-case, found it, and =
hastened to introduce=20

himself by name. She took the bit of pasteboard, and, since she scarcely gl=
anced at the engraved=20

line on it, he found himself wholly unable to interpret her smile.  "The ca=
rd is hardly necessary,"=20

she said; and then, to his complete bewilderment: "You are very much like y=
our father, Mr. Blount."=20

"You know my father?" he exclaimed.  She laughed softly. "Every one knows t=
he senator," she=20

returned, "and I can assure you that his son is heartily welcome under this=
 roof. Uncle Barnabas"--

to the ancient serving-man who was still hovering in the background--"have =
Mr. number will ever=20

get on board of the Fatime again," added the captain of the Maud, as decide=
d as before; but the=20

politeness of the pirate and Louis had amused him at such a time, and he wa=
s disposed to imitate=20

them.  "If you mean to murder us all, I cannot help myself just now," howle=
d Mazagan, furiously=20

mad at the disappointment which had suddenly overtaken him; and he seemed l=
ike an angry child=20

who had been denied a piece of candy, and resented it with tears and yells.=
  "All you have to do is=20

to pull back to your ship, and we shall not take the trouble to follow you,=
" answered Scott. "This=20

difficulty is not of our seeking."  "I came to you peaceably, unarmed, with=
 a fair proposition"--  "A=20

most impudent and presumptuous proposition!" shouted Captain Scott.  "I hav=
e been respectful=20

and polite to you, and you threaten to shoot me and my men."  "You have pla=
inly announced your=20

intention to take Mr. Belgrave on board of your steamer by force. Do you ca=
ll that respectful and=20

polite?"  "But I gave him a polite invitation to take possession of my cabi=
n without the use of force,=20

and he declined to accept it," argued Captain Mazagan, somewhat mollified i=
n his tone and=20

manner.  "Which he had a perfect right to do. You proposed to rob him of th=
e sum of two hundred=20

thousand francs; and you invite him to become a prisoner on board of your s=
hip in the capacity of=20

a hostage for the payment of the money of which you propose to rob him."  "=
What is the use of=20

arguing the question with him, Captain Scott?" interposed Louis, who retain=
ed his place in the=20

ranks. "His position is absurd, and the fellow is a fool as well as a knave=
."  "I have distinctly stated=20

that my claim is to be indemnification for the injury done to my noble mast=
er," replied the pirate, in=20

reply to Scott's last remark. "I do not propose to rob you."  "Call it blac=
kmail then, if you please."  "I=20

do not know what that means."  "Mr. Belgrave has nothing to do with your cl=
aim. He has not=20



insulted or assaulted your ignoble master; and, in United States dialect, y=
ou 'have taken the wrong=20

pig by the=20


_
ready."  Blount followed his still unnamed hostess obediently when she led =
the way to the lighted=20

library in the wing of the great house.  "Uncle Barnabas will come for you =
in a little while," she told=20

him, playing the part of the gracious lady to the line and letter. "In the =
meantime you must let me=20

make you a cup of tea. I am sure you must be needing it after having ridden=
 so far. Take the easy-

chair, and we can talk comfortably while the kettle is boiling. Are you new=
 to the West, Mr. Blount,=20

or is this only a return to your own? The senator is always talking about y=
ou, you know; but he is=20

so inordinately proud of you that he forgets to tell us all the really inte=
resting things that we want to=20

know."  The serving-man took his own time about coming back; so long a time=
 that Blount forgot=20

that it was past midnight, that he was a guest in a strange house, and that=
 he still had not learned=20

the name of his entertainer. For all this forgetfulness the little lady wit=
h the dark-brown eyes was=20

directly responsible. Almost before he realized it, Blount found himself ch=
atting with her as if have=20

nothing more to say," added Captain Scott, as he turned his back to the cla=
imant.  "I have=20

something more to say," returned Mazagan, bristling up with anger again. "M=
y boat is unarmed;=20

but I have not come up here without being prepared to meet you. I wish to b=
e fair and just, and I=20

will state the truth to you."  "I don't believe you know how to do it!" exc=
laimed Scott.  "I would not=20

irritate him any more than is necessary," said Louis in a whisper.  "I have=
 lost all patience with=20

him," replied the captain; and his manner indicated that he spoke the truth=
.  "You will find before=20

you have done with me that I can and do speak the truth, Captain Scott. Whe=
n I made my first=20

attempt to obtain satisfaction for my noble master in the Archipelago, I fa=
iled because your large=20

ship was armed with cannon, and she disabled my felucca. When my noble mast=
er offered me the=20

command of the Fatime, to be used in carrying out his wishes, I stipulated =
that she should be=20

armed with two twelve-pounders, with a supply of ammunition. I may add that=
 I have served as an=20

officer in the Turkish navy. Now,=20


_
making rapid strides on the way to confidence and finding her alertly respo=
nsive in whatever field=20

the talk happened to fall. Apparently she knew the world--his world--better=
 than he knew it himself:=20

she had summered on the North Shore and wintered in Washington. She knew Pa=
ris, and when=20

the conversation touched upon the Italian art-galleries he was led to wonde=
r if he had gone=20

through Italy with his eyes shut. At the next turn of the talk he was force=
d to admit that not even=20

Patricia herself could speak more intelligently of the English social probl=
em; and when it came to=20

the vital questions of the American moment he gasped again and wondered if =
he were awake--if it=20

could be possible that this out-of-place Georgian mansion and its charming =
mistress could be part=20

and parcel of the West nothing more to say from this boat, and the next tim=
e I speak it will be with=20

twelve-pounders; and my last word is that the Fatime will not go out of thi=
s bay till she leaves with=20

Mr. Belgrave on board of her."  "Adieu!" shouted Scott in mocking tones.  "=
Do you suppose the=20

villain spoke the truth, Captain?" asked Louis.  "Very likely he did, thoug=
h he is not in the habit of=20

doing so," replied Scott, laughing; but he was accustomed to put the best f=
ace upon an awkward=20

situation.  The boat was pulling away from the Maud, and the danger of an a=
ttack was removed for=20

the present. Mazagan appeared to be urging his men to pull with all their m=
ight, and they were=20

doing so. He evidently had a purpose before him, born of his failure to acc=
omplish anything by his=20

visit to the Maud.  It seemed to be=20
