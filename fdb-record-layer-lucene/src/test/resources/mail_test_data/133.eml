But some _
"What's that?" demanded the spokesman.  Blount repeated his assertion, addi=
ng jocularly:=20

"Perhaps you'd better call up headquarters and ask your boss if he wants yo=
u to kill the son of his=20

boss."  At this the gun-holder came around the fire to stand before his pri=
soner.  "Say, pal--this=20

ain't my night for kiddin', and it hadn't ort to be your'n," he remarked gr=
imly. "The boss didn't say=20

you was to be rubbed out--they never do. But I reckon it would save a heap =
o' trouble if you _was_=20

rubbed out."  "On the contrary, I'm inclined to think it would make a heap =
of trouble--for you and=20

your friends, and quite probably for the man or men who sent you to waylay =
me. But, apart from all=20

that, you've got hold of the wrong man, as I told you a moment ago."  "No, =
by grapples! I hain't. I=20

saw you in daylight. If there's been any fumblin' done, I hain't done it. S=
o you see it ain't any o' my=20

funeral."  "Think not?" said Blount.  "I know it ain't. Orders is orders, a=
nd you don't git over into=20

them woods on Upper Lost Creek with no papers to serve on nobody: see?"  It=
 was just here that=20

the light of complete understanding dawned upon Blount; and with it came th=
e disconcerting chill=20

of a conviction overthrown. As a theorist he had always scoffed at the idea=
 that a corporation,=20

which is a creature of the law, could afford to be an open law-breaker. But=
 here was a very striking=20

refutation of the charitable assumption. His smoking-room companion of the =
Pullman car was=20

doubtless one of the timber-pillagers who had been cutting on the public do=
main. To such a man=20

an agent of the National Forest Service was an enemy to be hoodwinked, if p=
ossible, or, in the last=20

resort, to be disposed of as expeditiously as might be, and Blount saw that=
 he had only himself to=20

blame for his present predicament, since he had allowed the man to believe =
that he was a=20

Government emissary. Having this clew to the mystery, his course was a litt=
le easier to steer.  "I=20

have no papers of the kind you think I have, as you can readily determine b=
y searching me," he=20

said. "My name is Blount, and I am the son of ex-Senator David Blount, of t=
his State. Now what=20

are you going to do with me?"  "What's that you say?" grated the outlaw.  "=
You heard what I said.=20

Go ahead and heave me into the canyon if you are willing to stand for it af=
terward."  The hard-

faced man turned without replying and went back to the other two at the fir=
e. Blount caught only a=20

word now and again of the low-toned, wrangling argument that followed. But =
from the overheard=20

word or two he gathered that there were still some leanings toward the soun=
d old maxim which=20

declares that "dead men tell no tales." When the decision was finally reach=
ed, he was left to guess=20

its purport. Without any explanation the thongs were taken from his wrists =
and ankles, and he was=20

helped upon his horse. After his captors were mounted, the new status was d=
efined by the=20

spokesman in curt phrase.  "You go along quiet with us, and you don't make =
no bad breaks, see? I=20

more'n half believe you been lyin' to me, but I'm goin' to give you a chanc=
e to prove up. If you don't=20

prove up, you pass out--that's all. Now git in line and hike out; and if yo=
u're countin' on makin' a=20

assaulted by Captain Ringgold, who has so far declined to make any apology =
or reparation such=20

as one gentleman has the right to require of another. Can you deny this sta=
tement?"  "Proceed,=20

Captain Mazagan; I have nothing to say," repeated Louis.  "You will not spe=
ak?"  "If you desire it, I=20

will; but simply to suggest that you wait on Captain Ringgold with your gri=
evance."  "That he has=20

tried to do, and called upon him in Constantinople for that purpose; but Ca=
ptain Ringgold is a=20

coward, a poltroon! He keeps himself shut up in his cabin, and refuses to g=
ive my noble master=20

any satisfaction."  It was with a struggle that Louis maintained his dignit=
y and preserved his=20

silence.  "Finding all the avenues to any satisfaction closed against him, =
my noble master, one of=20

the most exalted dignitaries of the Empire to which he is an honor, employe=
d me to obtain the=20



redress to which he is honorably entitled. So far I have not been successfu=
l. My noble master has=20

been graciously pleased to modify the terms and conditions upon which he wi=
ll consent to=20

discontinue his efforts to obtain adequate satisfaction for the insults hea=
ped upon him. He will=20

accept the atonement of two hundred thousand francs for the injury done him=
, assured that this=20

penalty would be the severest punishment that could be inflicted upon a cow=
ardly and penurious=20

American like Captain Ringgold."  "Why don't you send in your bill to him f=
or the boodle?" asked=20

Louis, who thought somebody must have written out the speech of Mazagan for=
 him.  "He would=20

not notice the claim," replied the pirate.  "I don't think he would," said =
Louis, inclined to laugh.  "I=20

intend to make the matter sure this time. If you will do me the favor to co=
me on board of the=20

Fatime, and remain with me in the cabin, which is quite as luxurious as you=
r own on board of your=20

large steam-yacht, until the money is paid, it will save all trouble and se=
ttle the matter at once,"=20

continued the Pacha's representative with a suavity creditable to his Frenc=
h education.  "If you=20

please, Captain Mazagan, we will not settle it in just that way; and withou=
t any disrespect to you=20

personally, I object to taking up my quarters in the cabin of the Fatime," =
replied Louis blandly.=20

"Then I must take you by force!" exclaimed the pirate.  He gave the order f=
or his men to pull.=20

Captain Scott called out his force.     CHAPTER X  "JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE,=
 MOTHER"=20

Morris Woolridge did not make use of any military forms, for he did not cla=
im to understand them;=20

but he simply came on the forecastle himself, followed by the other four of=
 his party; for Louis had=20

joined it when directed to do so by his superior. Captain Scott took the ri=
fle he had reserved for his=20

own use from the pilot-house. Those who had been waiting for the order had =
only to move a few=20

feet, and not a second of delay had been made.  A boat large enough to cont=
ain six men, as did=20

the pirate's, does not overcome its inertia and shoot ahead forty feet with=
out any apparent lapse of=20

time, like a bullet shot from a rifle. Morris and his men were in position =
before the boat had made=20

ten feet.  Morris gave no orders according to the manual of the soldier, bu=
t he ranged his=20

command on the forecastle,=20


_
ricollect that a chunk o' lead out of a Winchester kin travel a heap faster=
 thern your cayuse."  If=20

Blount had not already lost all sense of familiarity with his surroundings,=
 the devious mountain trail=20

taken by his captors would soon have convinced him that the boyhood memorie=
s were no longer=20

to be trusted. Up and down, the trail zigzagged and climbed, always penetra=
ting deeper and=20

deeper into the heart of the mountains. At times Blount lost even the sense=
 of direction; lost it so=20

completely that the high-riding moon seemed to be in the wrong quarter of t=
he heavens.  For the=20

first few miles the trail was so difficult that speed was out of the questi=
on; but later, in crossing a=20

high-lying valley, the horses were pushed. Beyond the valley there were mor=
e mountains, and=20

half-way through this second range the trail plunged into a deep, cleft-lik=
e canyon with a brawling=20

torrent for its pathfinder. Once more Blount lost the sense of direction, a=
nd when the canyon trail=20

came out upon broad uplands and became a country road with bordering ranche=
s watered by=20

irrigation canals, into which the mountain torrent was diverted, there were=
 no recognizable=20

landmarks to tell him whither his captors were leading him.  As he was able=
 to determine by=20

holding his watch, face up, to the moonlight, it was nearly midnight when t=
he silent cavalcade of=20

four turned aside from the main road into an avenue of spreading cottonwood=
 trees. At its head=20

the avenue became a circular driveway; and fronting the driveway a stately =
house, guns were all=20

loaded, and every one of the party had had some experience in the use of th=
e weapon, so that=20

none of them had to be taught how to fire it.  "Aim at the boat," said the =
first officer in a quiet tone;=20

and all the rifles were directed to the enemy.  It was a fact which came ou=
t afterwards, that every=20

one of them aimed at Mazagan, not only because he was the most prominent ma=
rk as he stood in=20

the standing-room, but he was regarded as the biggest villain of the assail=
ants, and they could=20

shoot him with less compunction than the Moors in his train. He was the rep=
resentative of the=20

villain behind the scenes, and all the mischief seemed to come out of him. =
 "Stop where you are,=20

or I shall order my men to fire!" shouted Captain Scott, as soon as the rif=
les were all aimed at the=20

boat. "Say that in Arabic to them, Don!"  The engineer translated the warni=
ng for the benefit of=20

those who were back to the Maud, and perhaps did not see the weapons that w=
ere pointed at the=20

boat. But Mazagan could see the six rifles, including the one in the hands =
of the captain; and=20

before Don could finish his Arabic sentence, he had given the order to ceas=
e rowing. At least it=20

was supposed he had done so, for the Moors dropped their oars, some of them=
 into the water.=20

The boat's crew were in a panic without any doubt, and Captain Scott was in=
clined to feel that "the=20

coon had come down." Mazagan spoke to them in a savage tone, as though he w=
as reproving=20

them for their cowardice; but they plainly did not relish the idea of=20


_
colonnaded portico, flung its shadow across the white gravel of the carriag=
e approach.  There=20

were lights in one wing of the house, and another appeared behind the fan-l=
ight in the entrance-

hall when the leader of the three highbinders had tramped up the steps and =
touched the bell-push.=20

Blount had a fleeting glimpse of a black head with a fringe of able to make=
 any resistance, for=20

there was nothing that looked like a musket to be seen in the boat.  [Illus=
tration: "STOP WHERE=20

YOU ARE OR I SHALL ORDER MY MEN TO FIRE!" Page 92.]  After his recent exper=
ience in=20

Cairo, probably Captain Mazagan was provided with a revolver; but he did no=
t exhibit it, and in the=20

face of half a dozen breech-loaders,=20
