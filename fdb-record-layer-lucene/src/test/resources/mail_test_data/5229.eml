grew only there.  He went directly to the little pond where he had first se=
en the bull moose, and=20

had arrived within a few rods of the shore when his keen ear caught a sligh=
t sound.  It was a=20

sound of pain, half-groan and half-moan.  Something was in distress.  Distr=
ess in the wilderness=20

usually till he was gone. I was myself thinking of once more trying Switzer=
land, but the obstacles=20

are great; and, in truth, I was at the darkest moment when Jenny brought me=
 the light of your=20

name.=E2=80=9D  The general, who had bivouacked on a group of small chairs,=
 his leg on one, his elbow on=20

another, took his=20


_
cautiously forward.  Soon the wind brought moose-scent to the bear's nostri=
ls and he was filled=20

with fear and tempted to flee, but still he could hear deep groans and sigh=
s.  Coming to the edge=20

of the water he peered out through the bushes and discovered the mighty moo=
se helpless and=20

impotent, mired in a treacherous spring bog.  His legs were entirely buried=
 in the mud, which came=20

up on his sides.  He was covered with foam and sweat, and so weak with thra=
shing and=20

wrenching, that he could hardly hold up his great head.  At the sight, hate=
 glowed hot in the small=20

red eyes of Black Bruin.  It was this monster who had so beaten and humilia=
ted him.  Now he=20

would punish him, so he crept cautiously forward.  But the strong wind blew=
 the moose-scent in his=20

nostrils and fear kept him at bay.  Finally the moose also scented the bear=
 and made frantic efforts=20

to free himself, feeling that he was now helpless and at the mercy of all; =
but his efforts were futile=20

and he laid his head wearily down in the mud when he had ceased struggling.=
  For a whole day=20

Black Bruin watched him, before he could overcome his fear; then he crept c=
autiously out and=20

sprang upon the bull's rear. The great brute was by that time so spent that=
 he hardly moved while=20

Black Bruin lacerated his flanks.  The only sign of pain that he gave was e=
xpressed in deep groans=20

and sighs which seemed fairly to come from his breaking heart.  Soon the co=
nqueror crept along=20

the back to his neck, and biting and striking at the vertebrae, quickly ext=
inguished the strong life in=20

the great frame and the huge head gradually sank in the mire.  For several =
days Black Bruin came=20

and gorged himself upon the carcass and did not desist until it had entirel=
y disappeared in the bog.=20

CHAPTER XIII  THE BEAR WITH A COLLAR  It may interest the reader to know ju=
st how Black=20

Bruin looked in this, his seventh year, when he had acquired his full statu=
re, which was enormous=20

for a black bear.  The California grizzly occasionally reaches a thousand p=
ounds, while the=20

enormous brown Kadiak bears, the largest carnivorous animals in the world, =
reach two thousand=20

pounds; but the black bear usually averages about two hundred.  Black Bruin=
 had far himself of a=20

volume of smoke, and then said dryly: =E2=80=9CThings may not be so bad as =
they seem, comrade. Your=20

efforts have not been without fruit. I have traced them in many quarters, a=
nd, indeed, it is about=20

their possible consequences that I have come over to consult with you.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIdle words, I know, never=20

escape those lips,=E2=80=9D said Mirandola; =E2=80=9Cspeak on.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said the general, =E2=80=9Cyou see that people are=
=20

a little exhausted by the efforts of last year; and it must be confessed th=
at no slight results were=20

accomplished. The freedom of Venice=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA French in=
trigue,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Mirandola. =E2=80=9CThe freedom=20

of Venice is the price of the slavery of Rome. I heard of it with disgust.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, we do not differ=20

much on that head,=E2=80=9D said the general. =E2=80=9CI am not a Roman as =
you are, but I view Rome, with=20

reference to the object of my life, with feelings not less ardent and absor=
bing than yourself, who=20

would wish to see it again the empress of the world. I am a soldier, and lo=
ve war, and, left to=20

myself, would care little perhaps for what form of government I combated, p=
rovided the army was=20

constituted on the principles of fraternity and equality; but the passion o=
f my life, to which I have=20

sacrificed military position, and perhaps,=E2=80=9D he added in a lower ton=
e, =E2=80=9Cperhaps even military fame,=20

has been to destroy priestcraft, and, so long as the pope rules in Rome, it=
 will be supreme.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe=20

have struck him down once,=E2=80=9D said Mirandola.  =E2=80=9CAnd I hope we=
 shall again, and forever,=E2=80=9D said the=20

general, =E2=80=9Cand it is about that I would speak. You are in error in s=
upposing that your friends do not=20

sympathize with you, or that their answers are dilatory or evasive. There i=
s much astir; the old=20

spirit is not extinct, but the difficulties are greater than in former days=
 when we had only the=20

Austrians to encounter, and we cannot afford to make another failure.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CThere could be no failure=20



if we were clear and determined. There must be a hundred thousand men who w=
ould die for our=20

metropolis, our natural frontiers, and true liberty. The mass of the pseudo=
-Italian army must be=20

with us. As for foreign interference, its repetition seems to me impossible=
. The brotherhood in the=20

different countries, if well guided, could=20


_
contemporaries in size and prowess.  In the fall of his seventh year he wei=
ghed upon the scales=20

four hundred and two pounds, which fairly earned him the title of King.  Hi=
s coat was long, thick,=20

and glossy and black in color.  He was not as high upon the shoulders as on=
e might expect for so=20

large a beast.  A wolf that stands thirty or thirty-two inches at the shoul=
der will weigh one hundred=20

and twenty-five pounds and is a large wolf.  Black Bruin was probably thirt=
y-five or forty inches=20

high at the shoulder, but considerably higher in the middle of the back, wh=
ich also sloped off at the=20

rear, where he was quite rotund.  His tail was so insignificant as to be ha=
rdly noticed at all at a=20

distance.  His head was rather small for so large an animal.  His eyes were=
 also small and looked=20

weak.  His claws, which were non-retractile, were not rakishly long as are =
the grizzly's, but=20

protruded slightly beyond the long hair upon his feet.  So altogether Black=
 Bruin was most=20

imposing for an eastern bear.  He was sleek and well-groomed, with the exce=
ption of two or three=20

months in the early summer when he shed his coat.  Living as he now did wit=
hin easy reach of the=20

abode of man, he went more and more often to the farmhouses and took toll o=
f the farmers. His=20

wariness in regard to men, which he had learned partly of White Nose and pa=
rtly from sad=20

experience, gradually wore away and his old life with Pedro helped him to f=
orget how strange and=20

fearful a creature man is, when dealing with wild beasts.  So while he came=
 and went much more=20

recklessly than he would otherwise have done, yet his knowledge of man's wa=
ys stood him in=20

good stead.  He knew that man was a creature of the day, doing his work in =
broad daylight, while=20

the bear is a night prowler.  He knew that at morning and evening man came =
and went from the=20

fields to his den, where he always stayed at night.  He knew at just what h=
ours the man-beast=20

would be sleeping, and when he would come forth and tend his creatures.  He=
 had often followed=20

his own master in the old cubhood days at the farmhouse, from outbuilding t=
o outbuilding,=20

watching him do the morning chores.  Man's thunder and lightning he also kn=
ew and feared more=20

than all his other powers.  Dogs he despised and he also hated them, for th=
ey often interrupted=20

him in his thieving.  One Sunday morning early in June Black Bruin had been=
 prowling about a=20

little Canadian the peoples. They have become absorbed in money-grubbing an=
d what they call=20

industry. The external life of a nation is its most important one. A nation=
, as an individual, has=20

duties to fulfil appointed by God and His moral law; the individual toward =
his family, his town, his=20

country; the nation toward the country of countries, humanity=E2=80=94the o=
utward world. I firmly believe=20

that we fail and renounce the religious and divine element of our life when=
ever we betray or=20

neglect those duties. The internal activity of a nation is important and sa=
cred because it prepares=20

the instrument for its appointed task. It is mere egotism if it converges t=
oward itself, degrading and=20

doomed to expiation=E2=80=94as will be the fate of this country in which we=
 now dwell,=E2=80=9D added Mirandola=20

in a hushed voice. =E2=80=9CEngland had a mission; it had belief, and it ha=
d power. It announced itself the=20

representative of religious, commercial, and political freedom, and yet, wh=
en it came to action, it=20

allowed Denmark to be crushed by Austria and Prussia, and, in the most nefa=
rious transaction of=20

modern times, uttered the approving shriek of =E2=80=98Perish Savoy!=E2=80=
=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy dear Mirandola,=E2=80=9D said the=20

general, trimming his cigar, =E2=80=9Cthere is no living man who appreciate=
s your genius and your worth=20

more than myself; perhaps I might say there is no living man who has had eq=
ual opportunities of=20

estimating them. You formed the mind of our country; you kindled and kept a=
live the sacred flame=20

when all was gloom, and all were without heart. Such prodigious devotion, s=
o much resource and=20

pertinacity and patience, such unbroken spirit, were never before exhibited=
 by man; and, whatever=20



may be said by your enemies, I know that in the greatest hour of action you=
 proved equal to it; and=20

yet at this moment, when your friends are again stirring, and there is a ho=
pe of spring, I am bound=20

to tell you that there are only two persons in the world who can effect the=
 revolution, and you are=20

not one of them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am ardent, my general, perhaps too sa=
nguine, but I have no self-love, at least=20

none when the interests of the great cause are at stake. Tell me, then, the=
ir names, and count, if=20

required, on my cooperation.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGaribaldi and Mary-Anne.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA Polchinello and a Bayadere!=E2=80=9D=20

exclaimed Mirandola, and, springing from his seat, he impatiently paced the=
 room.  =E2=80=9CAnd yet,=E2=80=9D=20

continued the general calmly, =E2=80=9Cthere is no manner of doubt that Gar=
ibaldi is the=20


_
hen-turkey, which he had happened to discover sitting far from home. He was=
 returning to his=20

mountain, when, in crossing one of those broad paths in which men always tr=
aveled, he so far=20

forgot his usual precautions as nearly to run into a team carrying a half-w=
itted French boy to early=20

mass, that was being celebrated in the little French Catholic church near b=
y.  Upon seeing the=20

enormous black bear at such close quarters, the boy's hair fairly stood up =
with fright and whipping=20

up his horse he was soon at the church.  Throwing the lines upon at any giv=
en point in Italy; while=20

in France, though her influence is mythical, the name of Mary-Anne is a nam=
e of magic. Though=20

never mentioned, it is never forgotten. And the slightest allusion to it am=
ong the initiated will open=20

every heart. There are more secret societies in France at this moment than =
at any period since=20

=E2=80=9885, though you hear nothing of them; and they believe in Mary-Anne=
, and in nothing else.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou=20

have been at Caprera?=E2=80=9D said Mirandola.  =E2=80=9CI have been at Cap=
rera.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd what did he say?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe=20

will do nothing without the=20
