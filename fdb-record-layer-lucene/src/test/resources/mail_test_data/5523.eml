=82=B6=E3=80=81=E6=82=B6=E3=80=82=E6=88=B2=E9=A1=8C faithful. As for earth,=
 there is no land so gay or so dear as _la douce France_. The Emperor is ab=
ove all the servant and protector of the Church. As the influence of the gr=
eat feudal lords increased, they are magnified often at the expense of the =
monarchy; yet even when in high rebellion, they secretly feel the duty of l=
oyalty. The recurring poetic epithet and phrase of formula found in the _ch=
ansons de geste_ often indicate rather than veil a defect of imagination. E=
pisodes _
lives of contemporary saints, by far the most remarkable is that of our Eng=
lish Becket by Garnier=20

de Pont-Sainte-Maxence. Garnier had himself known the archbishop; he obtain=
ed the testimony of=20

witnesses in England; he visited the places associated with the events of B=
ecket's life; his work=20

has high value as an historical document; it possesses a personal accent, r=
are in such writings; a=20

genuine dramatic vigour; and great skill and harmonious power in its stanza=
s of five rhyming lines.=20

A body of short poems, inspired by religious feeling, and often telling of =
miracles obtained by the=20

intercession of the Virgin or the saints, is known as _Contes pieux_. Many =
of these were the work=20

of Gautier de Coinci (1177-1236), a Benedictine monk; he translates from La=
tin sources, but with=20

freedom, adding matter of his own, and in the course of his pious narrative=
s gives an image, far=20

from flattering, of the life and manners of his own time. It is he who tell=
s of the robber who, being=20

accustomed to commend himself in his adventures to our Lady, was supported =
on the gibbet for=20

three days by her white hands, and received his pardon; and of the illitera=
te monk who suffered=20

shame because he knew no more than his _Ave Maria_, but who, when dead, was=
 proved a holy=20

man by the five roses that came from his mouth in honour of the five letter=
s of Maria's name; and=20

of the nun who quitted her convent to lead a life of disorder, yet still ad=
dressed a daily prayer to=20

the Virgin, and who, returning after long years, found that the Blessed Mar=
y had filled her place,=20

and that her absence was unknown. The collection known as _Vies des Peres_ =
exhibits the same=20

naivete of pious feeling and imagination. Man is weak and sinful; but by su=
pernatural aid the=20

humble are exalted, sinners are redeemed, and the suffering innocent are av=
enged. Even=20

Theophile, the priest who sold his soul to the devil, on repentance receive=
s back from the Queen=20

of Heaven the very document by which he had put his salvation in pawn. The =
sinner (_Chevalier=20

au barillet_) who endeavours for a year to fill the hermit's little cask at=
 running streams, and=20

endeavours in vain, finds it brimming the moment one tear of true penitence=
 falls into the vessel.=20

Most exquisite in its feeling is the tale of the _Tombeur de Notre-Dame_--a=
 poor acrobat--a=20

jongleur turned monk--who knows not even the _Pater noster_ or the _Credo_,=
 and can only offer=20

before our Lady's altar his tumbler's feats; he is observed, and as he sink=
s worn-out and faint=20

before the shrine, the Virgin is seen to descend, with her angelic attendan=
ts, and to wipe away the=20

sweat from her poor servant's forehead. If there be no other piety in such =
a tale as this, there is at=20

least the piety of human pity.   II THE NATIONAL EPIC  Great events and per=
sons, a religious and=20

national spirit, and a genius for heroic narrative being given, epic litera=
ture arises, as it were,=20

inevitably. Short poems, partly narrative, partly lyrical, celebrate victor=
ies or defeats, the=20

achievements of conquerors or defenders, and are sung to relieve or to sust=
ain the passion of the=20

time. The French epopee had its origin in the national songs of the Germani=
c invaders of Gaul,=20

adopted from their conquerors by the Gallo-Romans. With the baptism of Clov=
is at Reims, and the=20

acceptance of Christianity by the Franks (496), a national consciousness be=
gan to exist--a=20

national and religious ideal arose. Epic heroes--Clovis, Clotaire, Dagobert=
, Charles Martel--

became centres for the popular imagination; an echo of the Dagobert songs i=
s found in=20

_Floovent_, a poem of the twelfth century; eight Latin lines, given in the =
_Vie de Saint Faron_ by=20

Helgaire, Bishop of Meaux, preserve, in their ninth-century rendering, a fr=
agment of the songs=20

which celebrated Clotaire II. Doubtless more and more in these lost _cantil=
enes_ the German=20

element yielded to the French, and finally the two streams of literature--F=
rench and German--

separated; gradually, also, the lyrical element yielded to the epic, and th=
e _chanson de geste_=20



was developed from these songs.  In Charlemagne, champion of Christendom ag=
ainst Islam, a=20

great epic figure appeared; on his person converged the epic interest; he m=
ay be said to have=20

absorbed into himself, for the imagination of the singers and the people, t=
he persons of his=20

predecessors, and even, at a later time, of his successors; their deeds bec=
ame his deeds, their=20

fame was merged in his; he stood forth as the representative of France. We =
may perhaps regard=20

the ninth century as the period of the transformation of the _cantilenes_ i=
nto the _chansons de=20

geste_; in the fragment of Latin prose of the tenth century--reduced to pro=
se from hexameters, but=20

not completely reduced--discovered at La Haye (and named after the place of=
 its discovery), is=20

found an epic episode of Carlovingian war, probably derived from a _chanson=
 de geste_ of the=20

preceding century. In each _chanson_ the _gesta_,[1] the deeds or achieveme=
nts of a heroic=20

person, are glorified, and large as may be the element of invention in thes=
e poems, a certain=20

historical basis or historical germ may be found, with few exceptions, in e=
ach. Roland was an=20

actual person, and a battle was fought at Roncevaux in 778. William of Oran=
ge actually=20

encountered the Saracens at Villedaigne in 793. Renaud de Montauban lived a=
nd fought, not=20

indeed against Charlemagne, but against Charles Martel. Ogier, Girard de Ro=
ussillon, Raoul de=20

Cambrai, were not mere creatures of the fancy. Even when the narrative reco=
rds no historical=20

series of events, it may express their general significance, and condense i=
nto itself something of=20

the spirit of an epoch. In the course of time, however, fantasy made a conq=
uest of the historical=20

domain; a way for the triumph of fantasy had been opened by the incorporati=
on of legend into the=20

narrative, with all its wild exaggerations, its reckless departures from tr=
uth, its conventional types=20

of character, its endlessly-repeated incidents of romance--the child nouris=
hed by wild beasts, the=20

combat of unrecognised father and son, the hero vulnerable only in one poin=
t, the vindication of=20

the calumniated wife or maiden; and by the over-labour of fantasy, removed =
far from nature and=20

reality, the epic material was at length exhausted.  [Footnote 1: _Gestes_ =
meant (1) deeds, (2)=20

their history, (3) the heroic family.]  The oldest surviving _chanson de ge=
ste_ is the SONG OF=20

ROLAND, and it is also the best. The disaster of Roncevaux, probably first =
sung in _cantilenes_,=20

gave rise to other chansons, two of which, of earlier date than the survivi=
ng poem, can in a=20

measure be reconstructed from the Chronicle of Turpin and from a Latin _Car=
men de proditione=20

Guenonis_. These, however, do not detract from the originality of the noble=
 work in our=20

possession, some of the most striking episodes of which are not elsewhere f=
ound. The oldest=20

manuscript is at Oxford, and the last line has been supposed to give the au=
thor's name--Touroude=20

(Latinised "Turoldus")--but this may have been the name of the jongleur who=
 sang, or the=20

transcriber who copied. The date of the poem lies between that of the battl=
e of Hastings, 1066,=20

where the minstrel Taillefer sang in other words the deeds of Roland, and t=
he year 1099. The poet=20

was probably a Norman, and he may have been one of the Norman William's fol=
lowers in the=20

invasion of England.  More than any other poem, the _Chanson de Roland_ des=
erves to be=20

named the Iliad of the Middle Ages. On August 15, 778, the rearguard of Cha=
rlemagne's army,=20

returning from a successful expedition to the north of Spain, was surprised=
 and destroyed by=20

Basque mountaineers in the valley of Roncevaux. Among those who fell was Hr=
odland (Roland),=20

Count of the march of Brittany. For Basques, the singers substituted a host=
 of Saracens, who,=20

after promise of peace, treacherously attack the Franks, with the complicit=
y of Roland's enemy,=20

the traitor Ganelon. By Roland's side is placed his companion-in-arms, Oliv=
ier, brave but prudent,=20



brother of Roland's betrothed, _la belle Aude_, who learns her lover's deat=
h, and drops dead at=20

the feet of Charlemagne. In fact but thirty-six years of age, Charlemagne i=
s here a majestic old=20

man, _a la barbe=20


_
his great lords--Duke Naime, the Nestor of this Iliad; Archbishop Turpin, t=
he warrior prelate; Oger=20

the Dane; the traitor Ganelon. And overhead is God, who will send his angel=
s to bear=20

heavenwards the soul of the gallant Roland. The idea of the poem is at once=
 national and=20

religious--the struggle between France, as champion of Christendom, and the=
 enemies of France=20

and of God. Its spirit is that of the feudal aristocracy of the eleventh ce=
ntury. The characters are in=20

some degree representative of general types, but that of Roland is clearly =
individualised; the=20

excess of soldierly pride which will not permit him, until too late, to sou=
nd his horn and recall=20

Charlemagne to his aid, is a glorious fault. When all his comrades have fal=
len, he still continues=20

the strife; and when he dies, it is with his face to the retreating foe. Hi=
s fall is not unavenged on the=20

Saracens and on the traitor. The poem is written in decasyllabic verse--in =
all 4000 lines--divided=20

into sections or _laisses_ of varying length, the lines of each _laisse_ be=
ing held together by a=20

single assonance.[2] And such is the form in which the best _chansons de ge=
ste_ are written. The=20

decasyllabic line, derived originally from popular Latin verse, rhythmical =
rather than metrical, such=20

as the Roman legionaries sang, is the favourite verse of the older chansons=
. The alexandrine,[3]=20

first seen in the _Pelerinage de Jerusalem_ of the early years of the twelf=
th century, in general=20

indicates later and inferior work. The _laisse_, bound in one by its identi=
cal assonance, might=20

contain five lines or five hundred. In chansons of late date the full rhyme=
 often replaces=20

assonance; but inducing, as it did in unskilled hands, artificial and feebl=
e expansions of the sense,=20

rhyme was a cause which co-operated with other causes in the decline of thi=
s form of narrative=20

poetry.  [Footnote 2: _Assonance_, _i.e._ vowel-rhyme, without an agreement=
 of consonants.]=20

[Footnote 3: Verse of twelve syllables, with cesura after the sixth accente=
d syllable. In the=20

decasyllabic line the cesura generally followed the fourth, but sometimes t=
he sixth, tonic syllable.]=20

Naturally the chansons which celebrated the achievements of one epic person=
age or one heroic=20

family fell into a group, and the idea of cycles of songs having arisen, th=
e=20


_
subjects to enter into the so-called cycle of the king (Charlemagne), or th=
at of William of Orange,=20

or that of Doon of Mayence. The second of these had, indeed, a genuine cycl=
ic character: it told of=20

the resistance of the south of France to the Mussulmans. The last cycle to =
develop was that of the=20

Crusades. Certain poems or groups of poems may be distinguished as _gestes_=
 of the provinces,=20

including the _Geste des Lorrains_, that of the North (_Raoul de Cambrai_),=
 that of Burgundy, and=20

others.[4] Among these may be placed the beautiful tale of _Amis et Amiles_=
, a glorification of=20

friendship between man and man, which endures all trials and self-sacrifice=
s. Other poems, again,=20

are unconnected with any of these cycles; and, indeed, the cyclic division =
is more a convenience=20

of classification than a fact in the spontaneous development of this form o=
f art. The entire period of=20

the evolution of epic song extends from the tenth or eleventh to the fiftee=
nth century, or, we might=20

say, from the _Chanson de Roland_ to the _Chronique de Bertrand Duguesclin_=
. The eleventh=20

century produced the most admirable work; in the twelfth century the chanso=
ns are more=20

numerous, but nothing was written of equal merit with the Song of Roland; a=
fter the death of Louis=20

VII. (1180) the old epic material was rehandled and beaten thin--the decade=
nce was already in=20

progress.  [Footnote 4: The epopee composed in Provencal, sung but not tran=
scribed, is wholly=20

lost. The development of lyric poetry in the South probably checked the dev=
elopment of the epic.]=20

The style in which the _chansons de geste_ are written is something traditi=
onal, something=20

common to the people and to the time, rather than characteristic of the ind=
ividual authors. They=20

show little of the art of arranging or composing the matter so as to produc=
e an unity of effect: the=20

narrative straggles or condenses itself as if by accident; skill in transit=
ions is unknown. The study=20

of character is rude and elementary: a man is either heroic or dastard,=20


_
a traitor; wholly noble, or absolutely base. Yet certain types of manhood a=
nd womanhood are=20

presented with power and beauty. The feeling for external nature, save in s=
ome traditional=20

formulae, hardly appears. The passion for the marvellous is everywhere pres=
ent: St. Maurice, St.=20

George, and a shining company, mounted on white steeds, will of a sudden be=
ar down the hordes=20

of the infidel; an angel stands glorious behind the throne of Charlemagne; =
or in narrative of Celtic=20

origin angels may be mingled with fays. God, the great suzerain, to whom ev=
en kings owe=20

homage, rules over all; Jesus and Mary are watchful of the soldiers of the =
cross; Paradise receives=20
