PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK 

OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU 

FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES 

EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  1.F.3.  LIMITED 

RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 

90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The person or entity 

that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a 

refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose 

to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the

fix the problem.  1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 

1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,

and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone 

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and 

any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and position. Things look so different 

when you've done it--from what they do when some one else has done it. There are so many 

things to be taken into consideration. Punishment is not the same to all; it might ruin one, and not 

do much harm to another. A man might feel justified, or at least there would be excuses for him, if 

he let another bear the punishment which would not hurt _him_ much, but would be destructive to 

himself. Of course it would be his business to make it up somehow."  "Lord Rintoul, this is dreadful 

doctrine!" said Nora; "if it were carried out, then you might do any wickedness you wished, and 

hire somebody to be punished instead of you." She laughed half nervously, shaking off the graver 

turn the conversation had taken. "But this is absurd," she said; "of course you don't mean that. I 

think I know what you mean;--but I must not delay longer, I must tell Miss Barbara."  "Don't disturb 

her now," said Rintoul, eagerly. "Besides, I really have not time. If you would say that it is 

unfortunately true--that Erskine is--detained till there can be a full investigation. I am hurrying off to 

get bail for him, for of course they must accept bail--and it will only be for a few days. The 

investigation--at which we shall all be examined," he said, with a nervous tremor,--"will clear up 

everything, I hope."  "I hope so, with all my heart," said Nora, waving her hand to him as he 

hurried away. Rintoul had reached the garden door on his way out, when he suddenly paused, 

and came back to her, and took that hand, holding it for a moment between his own.  "All this is 

very hard upon me," he said, incoherently; "it gives me a great deal of misery. Feel for me--stand 

by me. Will you, Nora? I don't care for the rest, if you----"  And he wrung her hand almost violently, 



dropped it, and hurried away. The girl stood looking after him with wonder and dismay, and yet 

with a gush of a different kind of feeling, which filled her heart with a confusing warmth. "A great 

deal of misery!" Was it the tenderness of his heart for his sister, for the unfortunate man who had 

been summoned out of the world so abruptly--though he did not

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly 

from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project 

Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-

tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project 

Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works 

in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and 

new computers.  It exists because of who was unjustly accused, which made Rintoul say this? But 

anyhow, Nora was not capable of resisting such an appeal. Poor Rintoul: though he did not show it 

to any one, how tender he was, how full of sympathy! John Erskine (against whom she could not 

help entertaining a little grudge) died out of her mind altogether. She was so much more sorry for 

the other, who felt it so deeply though it was not his concern.     CHAPTER XXXIV.   Beaufort 

drove home on that eventful afternoon by himself. He had left his friend in the county jail, in a state 

in which surprise was still perhaps the predominant feeling. John had said little 


_
people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the 

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the 

Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the 

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent 

future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future to point out, with something which perhaps bore the 

character of bravado, the new features of the landscape beyond Dunearn. "It is an opportunity for 

you to see a little more of the country," he said, with a smile. Something of the same indignant 

amusement which had been his first apparent sensation on hearing the sheriff's decision was still 

in his manner now. He held his head high and a little thrown back, his nostrils were
