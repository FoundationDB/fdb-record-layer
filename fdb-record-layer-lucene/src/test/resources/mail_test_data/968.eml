The manufactories which were once at the mines of the Ephesians have now be=
en transferred to=20

Rome, because this kind of ore was later discovered in Spain. The clods are=
 brought from the=20

mines there, and treated in Rome by public contractors. These manufactories=
 are between the=20

temples of Flora and Quirinus.  5. Cinnabar is adulterated by mixing lime w=
ith it. Hence, one will=20

have to proceed as follows, if one wishes to prove that it is unadulterated=
. Take an iron plate, put=20

the cinnabar upon it, and lay it on the fire until the plate gets red hot. =
When the glowing heat=20

makes the colour change and turn black, remove the plate from the fire, and=
 if the cinnabar when=20

cooled returns to its former colour, it will be proved to be unadulterated;=
 but if it keeps the black=20

colour, it will show that it has been adulterated.  6. I have now said all =
that I could think of about=20

cinnabar. Malachite green is brought from Macedonia, and is dug up in the n=
eighbourhood of=20

copper mines. The names Armenian blue and India ink show in what places the=
se substances are=20

found.     CHAPTER X  ARTIFICIAL COLOURS. BLACK   1. I shall now pass to th=
ose substances=20

which by artificial treatment are made to change their composition, and to =
take on the properties of=20

colours; and first I shall treat of black, the use of which is indispensabl=

that the fixed of pine-wood. Often I admire a boy and girl, both flaxen-hea=
ded and ragged, who=20

clamber on the fence and laugh at my baldness. In their shining little eyes=
 I read, "Go up, go up,=20

thou baldhead!" They are almost the only people who care nothing for my cel=
ebrity or my rank.=20

Visitors do not come to me every day now. I will only mention the visits of=
 Nikolay and Pyotr=20

Ignatyevitch. Nikolay usually comes to me on holidays, with some pretext of=
 business, though=20

really to see me. He arrives very much exhilarated, a thing which never occ=
urs to him in the winter.=20

"What have you to tell me?" I ask, going out to him in the hall.  "Your Exc=
ellency!" he says,=20

pressing his hand to his heart and looking at me with the ecstasy of a love=
r--"your Excellency! God=20

be my witness! Strike me dead on the spot! _Gaudeamus egitur juventus!_"  A=
nd he greedily=20

kisses me on the shoulder, on the sleeve, and on the buttons.  "Is everythi=
ng going well?" I ask=20

him.  "Your Excellency! So help me God!..."  He persists in grovelling befo=
re me for no sort of=20

reason, and soon bores me, so I send him away to the kitchen, where they gi=
ve him dinner.  Pyotr=20

Ignatyevitch comes to see me on holidays, too, with the special object of s=
eeing me and sharing=20

his thoughts with me. He usually sits down near my table, modest, neat, and=
 reasonable, and does=20

not venture to cross his legs or put his elbows=20
