while the most important allegories in _Genesis_ are found recorded on Babylonian tiles centuries 

B.C.; while the Egyptian sarcophagi yearly yield proofs of the origin of the doctrines borrowed and 

copied by the Jews; yet the Monotheism of the Jews is exalted and thrown into the teeth of all the 

Pagan nations, and the so-called Christian Revelation is placed above all others, like the sun 

above a row of street gas-lamps. Yet it is perfectly well known, having been ascertained beyond 

doubt or cavil, that no manuscript, whether Kabalistic, Talmudistic, or Christian, which has reached 

our present generation, is of earlier date than the first centuries of our era, whereas this can 

certainly never be said of the Egyptian papyri including how to make donations to the Project 

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to 

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.                             TWENTY YEARS
