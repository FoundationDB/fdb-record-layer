philodendron monstera name of "Isaacs." It was perplexing to him to see how=
 many persons in London bore it; how should he choose between them? Ned ran=
 his finger down the closely printed column till he came to the name of "Re=

streets. "I'm like a blind man steering amongst shoals," muttered the one-a=
rmed sailor. Twenty=20

times had he to ask his way, "veering about and tacking to half the points =
in the compass," as he=20

afterwards laughingly told his wife, and it was not till after the lapse of=
 several hours that Ned=20

found himself, much heated, tired, and with a racking headache, at the door=
 of Isaacs' old lodging=20

at last.  Here little comfort was to be obtained. The shrewish-looking land=
lady who had unwittingly=20

quitted her supper to answer the sailor's impatient and repeated summons, s=
eemed half-inclined=20

to shut the door in his face, and told him that she knowed nothing, not she=
, of Benjamin Isaacs. A=20

working jeweller with a boy and a blind girl had lived there once, she owne=
d, when more closely=20

questioned by Ned; but they had gone long since, she could not tell whither=
; if they were alive or if=20

they were dead, she didn't know and she didn't care! Slamming the door, the=
 woman went back to=20

her supper, grumbling at being "bothered by impudent fellows like that comi=
ng to hunt up old=20

lodgers."  "Where am I to turn up now?" thought poor Franks, almost through=
 before Mr. Dundas=20

can be released; but English influence is at work in high quarters, and aft=
er what you have told=20

me, I think he will not much longer be under restraint. Besides, I may as w=
ell inform you, dear lady,=20

that not ten minutes before you arrived this morning I received satisfactor=
y news of the arrest of=20

two Englishmen at Frankfort, who seem to have been concerned in this busine=
ss in the Rue de la=20

Fille Sauvage. They certainly travelled with the murdered man; and a friend=
 of his called Gestre,=20

just back from Marseilles, has sworn that these persons were formerly partn=
ers of Janson, the=20

deceased. If Janson stole the necklace from Monsieur du Laurier, with this =
pair as accomplices,=20

and then tried to cheat them, a motive for the crime is evident. And we are=
 getting at Janson's=20

record, which seems to be a bad one--a notorious one throughout Europe, if =
he proves to be the=20

man we think. I hope, really, that in a very few days Mr. Dundas may be abl=
e to thank you in=20

person for what you've done for him, and--to tell you what has become of th=
ose letters."  "What=20

good will their destruction do me, though, if you are=20


_
and a little discouraged by the result of his search. The street lamps were=
 lighted, the public=20

houses flaring, night was coming on; but it seemed as if to London and its =
suburbs night would=20

bring no interval of quiet or repose. The village school-master longed for =
food, sleep, and rest.=20

"But I won't give up my chase yet," Ned said to himself. "Knowing Sophy and=
 Isaacs by sight, I'm=20

much more likely to find them out than a stranger would be; besides, I put =
more heart into the=20

business than that grand, sleepy-looking gentleman in black, who seemed not=
 to care the turning=20

of a straw whether the money found its way into Sophy's pocket or into the =
sea."  A thought=20

occurred to Ned Franks as he stood in perplexity leaning against a lamp-pos=
t. "I'll step into one of=20

the post-offices, and ask for a sight of one of the big red books that hold=
 all kinds of addresses.=20

Though Isaacs' will not be put down there, I may light upon some relation o=
f his; and if I merciful?"=20

"I intend to be, for I can combine mercy with justice. Dear Mademoiselle, M=
onsieur du Laurier=20

need never know the circumstances you have told to me, or that the Englishm=
an's alibi has been=20

proved by you. The arrest of these two men in Frankfort will, I feel sure, =
help the police to keep=20

your secret as you would keep it yourself. Now, will that assurance make it=
 easier for you to put=20

your whole soul into your part to-night?"  "If you will accept that box," I=
 said, letting him kiss my=20

hand, and feeling inclined to kiss his.  Then I drove home, with my heart s=
inging, for I felt almost=20

sure that I had trumped Godensky's last trick now.  When I reached home Mis=
s Forrest was there.=20

She had brought the diamonds in the brocade bag. Oddly enough, the ribbons =
which fastened it=20

were torn out, as if there had been a struggle for the possession of the ba=
g. But Miss Forrest did=20

not explain this, or even allude to it at all.  I thanked her for coming=20


_
I may manage to follow out the clue."  After a little more of inquiring his=
 way along those noisy=20

streets, where no one seemed at leisure to answer a question, Franks found =
a post-office, which=20

he entered. The shopman was putting up the shutters, and at first desired t=
he sailor to wait till=20

Monday; but, perhaps struck by the worn, weary looks of the inquirer, he go=
od-naturedly let him=20

have a sight of the directory, which he took down from a shelf, bidding the=
 sailor, however, make=20

haste.  Franks hurriedly turned over the leaves by gas-light, promise," I s=
aid. "The man you love=20

will be free in a few days. Will you let me say that I think you are a very=
 noble pair, and I hope you=20

will be happy together."  "I shall try to make up to him for--my hateful su=
spicions and--everything,"=20

she said, like a repentant child. "I love him so much!"  "And he you. You a=
lmost broke his heart by=20

throwing him over; I saw that. But how gloriously you will mend it again!" =
 "Oh, I hope so!" she=20

cried. "And you--have I really spoiled your life by forcing you to make tha=
t promise? I pray that I=20

haven't."=20
