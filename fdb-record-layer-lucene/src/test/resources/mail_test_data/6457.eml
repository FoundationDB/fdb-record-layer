s a woman not easily to be _
Some of the boys were near enough to see the woodchuck make for the two map=
les at the head=20

of the ravine, and Bob Hicks tumbled over Andy Thompson while he was shouti=
ng:  "Catch him,=20

Quib!"  After they got past those two maple trees there was no more fast ru=
nning to be done.=20

Down, down, deeper and rockier and rougher every rod of it, the rugged chas=
m opened ahead of=20

them, to become cosier and cosier, and also more luxurious, more of a ritua=
listic ceremony. And to=20

avoid the trouble and danger of going through a cold passage to the kitchen=
, she arranged matters=20

so that the entire operation could be performed with comfort and decency in=
 the sitting-room itself.=20

Priam was rolling cigarettes, many of them, and placing them, as he rolled =
them, in=20


_
boys to mind their steps. It was a place where a woodchuck or a small dog c=
ould get around a=20

good deal faster than any boy, but they all followed Quib in a way that wou=
ld have scared their=20

mothers if they had been there.  "It's grand fun!" said Mart Penniman. "Fin=
est woodchuck you ever=20

saw!"  "Come on, boys!" shouted Abe Selover, away ahead. "We'll get him, th=
is time."  Abe had a=20

way of being just the next boy behind the dog in any kind of chase, and the=
y all clambered after=20

him in hot haste.  On went Quib, and even Abe Selover could not see him mor=
e than half the time,=20

for he had an immense deal of dodging to do, in and out among the rocks and=
 trees, and it was=20

dreadfully shady at the bottom of that ravine.  The walls of rock, where Ab=
e was, rose more than=20

sixty feet high on either side, and the glen was only a few rods wide at th=
e widest place.  "He's=20

holed him! He's holed him! Come on! we've got him, now!"  Quib was scratchi=
ng and yelping like=20

an insane dog at the bottom of what looked like a great crack between two r=
ocks, in the left-hand=20

side of the glen as you went down. The crack was only an inch or so wide at=
 the bottom, and=20

twisted a good deal as it went up, for the rock was of the kind known as "p=
udding-stone." There=20

was a hole, just there, large enough for a woodchuck, but too small for a d=
og.  "Dig, boys! Dig!"=20

"Dig yourself," said Pete Corry. "Who's going to dig a rock, I'd like to kn=
ow?"  "Let Quib in, anyhow.=20

He'll drive him out."  Abe was prying at that hole with a dead branch of a =
tree, and, almost while he=20

was speaking, a great piece of the loose pudding-stone fell off and came th=
umping down at his=20

feet.  "A cave, boys, a cave! Just look in!"  Quib did not wait for anybody=
 to look in, but bounded=20

through the opening with a shrill yelp, and Abe Selover squeezed after him.=
  Pete Corry felt a little=20

nervous when he saw how dark it was, but he followed Abe; and the other boy=
s came on as fast=20

as the width of the hole would let them.  That is, they crept through, one =
boy at a time.  What=20

surprised them was, that the moment they had crawled through that hole they=
 could stand up=20

straight.  "Where's the woodchuck?" asked Bob Hicks.  "Woodchuck? Why, boys=
, this is a regular=20

cave," replied Abe.  "Quib's in there, somewhere," said Mart Penniman. "Jus=
t hear him yelp!"=20

"Hold on," said Cole Thomas--"there's more light coming in. We shall be abl=
e to see, in a minute."=20

The fact was that it took a little time for their eyes to get accustomed to=
 the small amount of light=20

there was in that cave.  The cave itself couple, one would judge from the r=
ichness of the tea, with=20

no immediate need of money. Over two years, however, had passed since the c=
atastrophe to=20

Cohoon's, and Cohoon's had in no way recovered therefrom. Yet money had bee=
n regularly found=20

for the household. The manner of its finding was soon to assume importance =
in the careers of=20

Priam and Alice. But, ere that moment, an astonishing and vivid experience =
happened to them.=20

One might have supposed that, in the life of Priam Farll at least, enough o=
f the astonishing and the=20

vivid had already happened. Nevertheless, what had already happened was as =
customary and=20

unexciting as addressing envelopes, compared to the next event.  The next e=
vent began at the=20

instant when Alice was sticking the long fork into a round of bread. There =
was a knock at the front=20

door, a knock formidable and reverberating, the knock of fate, perhaps, but=
 fate disguised as a=20

coalheaver.  Alice answered it. She always answered knocks; Priam never. Sh=
e shielded him from=20

every rough or unexpected contact, just as his valet used to do. The gas in=
 the hall was not=20

lighted, and so she stopped to light it, darkness having fallen. Then she o=
pened the door, and saw,=20

in the gloom, a short, thin woman standing on the step, a woman of advanced=
 middle-age,=20

dressed with a kind of shabby neatness. It seemed impossible that so frail =
and unimportant a=20

creature could have made such a noise on the door.  "Is this Mr. Henry Leek=
's?" asked the visitor,=20



in a dissatisfied, rather weary tone.  "Yes," said Alice. Which was not qui=
te true. 'This' was=20

assuredly hers, rather than her husband's.  "Oh!" said the woman, glancing =
behind her; and=20

entered nervously, without invitation.  At the same moment three male figur=
es sprang, or rushed,=20

out of the strip of front garden, and followed the woman into the hall, lun=
ging up against Alice, and=20

breathing loudly. One of the trio was a strong, heavy-faced heavy-handed, l=
ouring man of some=20

thirty years (it seemed probable that he was the knocker), and the others w=
ere curates, with the=20

proper physical attributes of curates; that is to say, they were of ascetic=
 habit and clean-shaven=20

and had ingenuous eyes.  The hall now appeared like the antechamber of a Ma=
y-meeting, and as=20

Alice had never seen it so peopled before, she vented a natural exclamation=
 of surprise.  "Yes,"=20

said one of the curates, fiercely. "You may say 'Lord,' but we were determi=
ned to get in, and in we=20

have got. John, shut the door. Mother, don't put yourself about."  John, be=
ing the heavy-faced and=20

heavy-handed man,=20


_
It grew wider for about twenty feet from the hole they came in by, and the =
floor, which was covered=20

with bits of rock, sloped upward like the roof of a house, only not quite s=
o abruptly.  In the middle it=20

was more than a rod wide. Then it grew narrower, and steeper, and darker wi=
th every step. But=20

"Where is Mr. Henry Leek?" demanded the other curate.  Now Priam, whose cur=
iosity had been=20

excusably excited by the unusual sounds in the hall, was peeping through a =
chink of the sitting-

room door, and the elderly woman caught the glint of his eyes. She pushed o=
pen the door, and,=20

after a few seconds'=20
