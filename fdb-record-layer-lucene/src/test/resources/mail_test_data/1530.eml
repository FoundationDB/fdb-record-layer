e remained, the center of=20

general attraction, with a hundred pair of blazing eyes leveled at him from=
 every side.  "Come!"=20

said Ned Harris, in a low tone, tapping him on the shoulder--"come, pardner=
; let's git out of this, for=20

times will be brisk soon. You've wounded one of the biggest card-devils in =
the Hills, and he'll be=20

rearin' pretty quick. Look! d'ye see that feller comin' yonder, who was pre=
achin' from on top of the=20

barrel, a bit ago? Well, that is Catamount Cass, an' he's a pard of Chet Di=
amond, the feller you=20

salted, an' them fellers behind him are his gang. Come! follow me, Henry, a=
nd I'll nose our way out=20

of here."  Redburn signified his readiness, and with a cocked six-shooter i=
n either hand Ned Harris=20

led the way.     CHAPTER IV.  SAD ANITA--THE MINE LOCATER--TROUBLE   Straig=
ht toward=20

the door of the saloon he marched, the muzzles of the grim sixes clearing a=
 path to him; for Ned=20

Harris had become notorious in Deadwood for his coolness, courage and audac=
ity. It had been=20

said of him that he would "just es lief shute a man as ter look at 'im," an=
d perhaps the speaker was=20

not far from right.  Anyway, he led off through the savage-faced audience w=
ith a composure that=20

was remarkable, and, strange to say, not a hand was raised to stop him unti=
l he came face to face=20

with Catamount Cass and his gang; here was where the youth had expected mol=
estation and=20

hindrance, if anywhere.  Catamount Cass was a rough, illiterate "tough" of =
the mountain species,=20

and possessed more brute courage than the general run of his type of men, a=
nd a bull-dog=20

determination that made him all the more dangerous as an enemy.  Harry Redb=
urn kept close at=20

Ned Harris' heels, a cocked "six" in either hand ready for any emergency.  =
It took but a few=20

moments before the two parties met, the "Cattymount" throwing out his foot =
to block the path.=20

"Hello!" roared the "tough," folding his huge knotty arms across his partia=
lly bared breast; "ho! ho!=20

whoa up thar, pilgrims! Don' ye go ter bein' so fast. Fo'kes harn't so much=
 in a hurry now-'days as=20

they uster war. Ter be sure ther Lord manyfactered this futstool in seven d=
ays; sum times I think=20

he did, an' then, ag'in, my geological ijees convince me he didn't."  "What=
 has that to do with us?"=20

demanded Ned, sternly. "I opine ye'd better spread, some of you, if you don=
't want me to run a=20

canyon through your midst. Preach to some other pilgrim than me; I'm in a h=
urry!"  "Haw! haw!=20

Yas, I obsarve ye be; but if ye're my meat, an' I think prob'ble ye be, I a=
in't a-goin' fer ter let yer off=20

so nice and easy. P'arps ye kin tell who fired the popgun, a minnit ago, w'=
at basted my ole pard?"=20

"I shall not take trouble to tell!" replied Ned, fingering the trigger of h=
is left six uneasily. "Ef you=20

want to know who salted Chet Diamond, the worst blackleg, trickster and car=
d-player in Dakota, all=20

you've got to do is to go and ask him!"  "Hold!" cried Harry Redburn, stepp=
ing out from behind=20

Harris; "I'll hide behind no man's shoulder. _I_ salted the gambler--if you=
 call shooting salting--and=20

I'm not afraid to repeat the action by salting a dozen more just of his par=
ticular style."  Ned Harris=20

was surprised.  He had set Redburn down as a faint-hearted, dubious-courage=
d counter-jumper=20

from the East; he saw now that there was something of him, after all.  "Com=
e on, young man!" and=20

the young miner stepped forward a pace; "are you with me?"  "To the ears!" =
replied Harris, grimly.=20

The next instant the twain leaped forward and broke the barrier, and mid th=
e crack of pistol-shots=20

and shouts of rage, they cleared the saloon. Once outside, Ned Harris led t=
he way.  "Come along!"=20

he said, dodging along the shadowy side of the street; "we'll have to scrat=
ch gravel, for them up-

range 'toughs' will follow us, I reckon. They're a game gang, and 'hain't t=
he most desirable kind of=20

enemies one could wish for. I'll take you over to my coop, and you can lay =
low there until this=20

jamboree blows over. You'll have to promise me one thing, however, ere I ca=
n admit you as a=20



member of my household."  "Certainly. What is it?" and Harry Redburn redoub=
led his efforts in=20

order to keep alongside his swift-footed guide.  "Promise me that you will =
divulge nothing, no=20

matter what you may see or hear. Also that, should you fall in love with on=
e who is a member of=20

my family, you will forbear and not speak of love to her."  "It is a woman,=
 then?"  "Yes--a young=20

lady."  "I will promise;--how can I afford to do otherwise, under the exist=
ing circumstances. But, tell=20

me, why did you force me to shoot that gambler?"  "He was a rascal, and che=
ated you."  "I know;=20

but I did not want his life; I am averse to bloodshed."  "So I perceived, a=
nd that made me all the=20

more determined you should salivate him. You'll find before you're in the H=
ills long that it won't do=20

to take lip or lead from any one. A green pilgrim is the first to get salte=
d; I illustrated how to serve=20

'em!"  Redburn's eyes sparkled. He was just beginning to see into the diffe=
rent phases of this wild=20

exciting life.  "Good!" he exclaimed, warmly. "I have much to thank you for=
. Did I kill that card-

sharp?"  "No; you simply perforated him in the right side. This way."  They=
 had been running=20

straight up the main street. Now they turned a corner and darted down one t=
hat was dark and=20

deserted.  A moment later a trim boyish figure stepped before them, from ou=
t of the shadow of a=20

new frame building; a hand of creamy whiteness was laid upon the arm of Ned=
 Harris.  "This way,=20

pilgrims," said a low musical voice, and at the same instant a gust of wind=
 lifted the jaunty=20

sombrero from the speaker's head, revealing a most wonderful wealth of long=
 glossy hair; "the=20

'toughs' are after you, and you cannot find a better place to coop than in =
here." The soft hand drew=20

Ned Harris inside the building, which was finished, but unoccupied, and Red=
burn followed, nothing=20

loth to get into a place of safety. So far, Deadwood had not impressed him =
favorably as being the=20

most peaceable city within the scope of a continent.  Into an inner room of=
 the building they went,=20

and the door was closed behind them. The apartment was small and smelled of=
 green lumber. A=20

table and a few chairs comprised the furniture; a dark lantern burned suspe=
nded from the ceiling=20

by a wire. Redburn eyed the strange youth as he and Harris were handed seat=
s.  Of medium hight=20

and symmetrically built; dressed in a carefully tanned costume of buck-skin=
, the vest being fringed=20

with the fur of the mink; wearing a jaunty as he reached out once more for =
the pen.  "Well, then,=20

would you mind if I gave you a letter for him?  I have something to send hi=
m."  Sly but kindly old=20

gentleman!  The "something" he had to send Longfellow was Edward himself, a=
lthough the boy did=20

not see through the subterfuge at that time.  "And now, if you are going, I=
'll walk along with you if=20

you don't mind, for I'm going down to Park Street to thank my publishers fo=
r these little books, and=20

that lies along your way to the Cambridge car."  As the two walked along Be=
acon Street, Doctor=20

Holmes pointed out the residences where lived people of interest, and when =
they reached the=20

Public Garden he said:  "You must come over in the spring some time, and se=
e the tulips and croci=20

and hyacinths here.  They are so beautiful.  "Now, here is your car," he sa=
id as he hailed a coming=20

horse-car. "Before you go back you must come and see me and tell me all the=
 people you have=20

seen, will you?  I should like to hear about them.  I may not have more boo=
ks coming in, but I=20

might have a very good-looking photograph of a very old-looking little man,=
" he said as his eyes=20

twinkled.  "Give my love to Longfellow when you see him, and don't forget t=
o give him my letter,=20

you know.  It is about a very important matter."  And when the boy had ridd=
en a mile or so with his=20

fare in his hand he held it out to the conductor, who grinned and said:  "T=
hat's all right.  Doctor=20

Holmes paid me your fare, and I'm going to keep that nickel if I lose my jo=
b for it."     CHAPTER V=20

GOING TO THE THEATRE WITH LONGFELLOW  When Edward Bok stood before the home=
 of=20



Longfellow, he realized that he was to see the man around whose head the bo=
y's youthful reading=20

had cast a sort of halo.  And when he saw the head itself he had a feeling =
that he could see the=20

halo.  No kindlier pair of eyes ever looked at a boy, as, with a smile, "th=
e white Mr. Longfellow," as=20

Mr. Howells had called him, held out his hand.  "I am very glad to see you,=
 my boy," were his first=20

words, and with them he won the boy.  Edward smiled back at the poet, and i=
mmediately the two=20

were friends.  "I have been taking a walk this beautiful morning," he said =
next, "and am a little late=20

getting at my mail.  Suppose you come in and sit at my desk with me, and we=
 will see what the=20

postman has brought.  He brings me so many good things, you know."  "Now, h=
ere is a little girl,"=20

he said, as he sat down at the desk with the boy beside him, "who wants my =
autograph and a=20

'sentiment.'  What sentiment, I wonder, shall I send her?"  "Why not send h=
er 'Let us, then, be up=20

and doing'?" suggested the boy. "That's what I should like if I were she." =
 "Should you, indeed?"=20

said Longfellow.  "That is a good suggestion. Now, suppose you recite it of=
f to me, so that I shall=20

not have to look it up in my books, and I will write as you recite.  But sl=
owly; you, know I am an old=20

man, and write slowly."  Edward thought it strange that Longfellow himself =
should not know his=20

own great words without looking them up.  But he recited the four lines, so=
 familiar to every=20

schoolboy, and when the poet had finished writing them, he said:  "Good!  I=
 see you have a=20

memory.  Now, suppose I copy these lines once more for the little girl, and=
 give you this copy?=20

Then you can say, you know, that you dictated my own poetry to me."  Of cou=
rse Edward was=20

delighted, and Longfellow gave him the sheet on which he had written:    Le=
t us, then, be up and=20

doing,     With a heart, for any fate;   Still achieving, still pursuing,  =
   Learn to labor and to wait.=20

HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.  Then, as the fine head bent down to copy the lines on=
ce more,=20

Edward ventured to say to him;  "I should think it would keep you busy if y=
ou did this for every one=20

who asked you."  "Well," said the poet, "you see, I am not so busy a man as=
 I was some years=20

ago, and I shouldn't like to disappoint a little girl, should you?"  As he =
took up his letters again, he=20

discovered five more requests for his autograph.  At each one he reached in=
to a drawer in his=20

desk, took a card, and wrote his name on it.  "There are a good many of the=
se every day," said=20

Longfellow, "but I always like to do this little favor.  It is so little to=
 do, to write your name on a card;=20

and if I didn't do it some boy or girl might be looking, day by day, for th=
e postman and be=20

disappointed.  I only wish I could write my name better for them.  You see =
how I break my letters?=20

That's because I never took pains with my writing when I was a boy.  I don'=
t think I should get a=20

high mark for penmanship if I were at school, do you?"  "I see you get lett=
ers from Europe," said=20

the boy, as Longfellow opened an envelope with a foreign stamp on it.  "Yes=
, from all over the=20

world," said the poet.  Then, looking at the boy quickly, he said: "Do you =
collect postage-stamps?"=20

Edward said he did.  "Well, I have some right here, then;" and going to a d=
rawer in a desk he took=20

out a bundle of letters, and cut out the postage-stamps and gave them to th=
e boy.  "There's one=20

from the Netherlands.  There's where I was born," Edward ventured to say.  =
"In the Netherlands?=20

Then you are a real Dutchman.  Well!  Well!" he said, laying down his pen. =
 "Can you read Dutch?"=20

The boy said he could.  "Then," said the poet, "you are just the boy I am l=
ooking for."  And going to=20

a bookcase behind him he brought out a book, and handing it to the boy, he =
said, his eyes=20

laughing: "Can you read that?"  "Yes, indeed," said Edward.  "These are you=
r poems in Dutch."=20

"That's right," he said.  "Now, this is delightful.  I am so glad you came.=
  I received this book last=20

week, and although I have been in the Netherlands, I cannot speak or read D=
utch.  I wonder=20



whether you would read a poem to me and let me hear how it sounds."  So Edw=
ard took "The Old=20

Clock on the Stairs," and read it to him.  The poet's face beamed with deli=
ght.  "That's beautiful,"=20

he said, and then quickly added: "I mean the language, not the poem."  "Now=
," he went on, "I'll tell=20

you what we'll do: we'll strike a bargain.  We Yankees are great for bargai=
ns, you know.  If you will=20

read me 'The Village Blacksmith' you can sit in that chair there made out o=
f the wood of the old=20

spreading chestnut-tree, and I'll take you out and show you where the old s=
hop stood.  Is that a=20

bargain?"  Edward assured him it was.  He sat in the chair of wood and leat=
her, and read to the=20

poet several of his own poems in a language in which, when he wrote them, h=
e never dreamed=20

they would ever be printed.  He was very quiet.  Finally he said: "It seems=
 so odd, so very=20


_
leather, with tops reaching to the knees; a face slightly sun-burned, yet s=
howing the traces of=20

beauty that even excessive dissipation could not obliterate; eyes black and=
 piercing; mouth firm,=20

resolute, and devoid of sensual expression: hair of raven color and of rema=
rkable length;--such=20

was the picture of the youth as beheld by Redburn and Harris.  "You can rem=
ain here till you think=20

it will be safe to again venture forth, gentlemen," and a smile--evidently =
a stranger hear something=20

you know so well sound so strange."  "It's a great compliment, though, isn'=
t it, sir?" asked the boy.=20

"Ye-es," said the poet slowly.  "Yes, yes," he added quickly.  "It is, my b=
oy, a very great=20

compliment."  "Ah," he said, rousing himself, as a maid appeared, "that mea=
ns luncheon, or rather,=20

it means dinner, for we have dinner in the old New England fashion, in the =
middle of the day.  I am=20

all alone to-day, and you must keep me company, will you?  Then afterward=
=20


_
about the speaker's lips. "Good-evening!" "Good-evening!" nodded Harris, wi=
th a quizzical stare.=20

The next moment the youth was gone.  "Who was that chap?" asked Redburn, no=
t a little=20

bewildered.  "That?--why that's Calamity Jane!"  "Calamity Jane? _What_ a n=
ame."  "Yes, she's an=20

odd one. Can ride like the wind, shoot like a sharp-shooter, and swear like=
 a trooper. Is here, there=20

and everywhere, seemingly all at one time. Owns this coop and two or three =
other lots in=20

Deadwood; a herding ranch at Laramie, an interest in a paying placer claim =
near Elizabeth City,=20

and the Lord only knows how walk, and I'll show you Cambridge.  It is such =
a beautiful old town,=20

even more beautiful, I sometimes think, when the leaves are off the trees."=
  [Illustration: Edward=20

Bok's birthplace at Helder, Netherlands.  In the foreground is one of the t=
ypical Dutch canals; at=20

the end of the garden in the rear is one of the famous Dutch dykes and just=
 beyond is the North=20

Sea.  The house now belongs to the Dutch Government.]  "Come," he said, "I'=
ll take you up-stairs,=20

and you can wash your hands in the room where George Washington slept.  And=
 comb your hair,=20

too, if you want to," he added; "only it=20


_
"But it is not a _woman_?"  "Reckon 'tain't nothin' else."  "God forbid tha=
t a child of mine should=20

ever become so debased and--"  "Hold! there are yet a few redeeming qualiti=
es about her. She=20

was _ruined_--" and here a shade dark as a thunder-cloud passed over Ned Ha=
rris' face--"and set=20

adrift upon the world, homeless and friendless; yet she has bravely fought =
her way through the=20

storm, without asking anybody's assistance. True, she may not now have a he=
art; that was=20

trampled upon, years ago, but her character has not suffered blemish since =
the day a foul wretch=20

stole away her honor!"  "What is her real name?"  "I do not know; few in De=
adwood do. It is said,=20

To the boyish mind it was an historic breaking of bread, that midday meal w=
ith Longfellow.  "Can=20

you say grace in Dutch?" he asked, as they sat down; and the boy did.  "Wel=
l," the poet declared,=20

"I never expected to hear that at my table. I like the sound of it."  Then =
while the boy told all that he=20

knew about the Netherlands, the poet told the boy all about his poems.  Edw=
ard said he liked=20

"Hiawatha."  "So do I," he said.  "But I think I like 'Evangeline' better. =
 Still, neither one is as good=20

as it should be.  But those are the things you see afterward so much better=
 than you do at the=20

time."  It was a great event for Edward when, with the poet nodding and=20
