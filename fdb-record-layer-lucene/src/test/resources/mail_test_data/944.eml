gives an order to the waiter, and pays another visit to the smiling little =
Jew. Their business is=20

rapidly transacted; Lamb redeems some half-dozen I O U's which he had previ=
ously given to the=20

steward, hurriedly signs a formal-looking instrument, which is duly witness=
ed, and stuffs into his=20

breast-pocket a big roll of notes, which he does not even stop to count. "I=
 do hope you'll be careful,=20

sir," remarks the steward to Lamb in an affectionate whisper, and in the to=

to her favourite child. Lamb returns to his seat at the table; he has lost =
eight hundred pounds=20

already, but the bulgey lump in his breast-pocket is another five thousand =
pounds. The waiter=20

places by his side a small gueridon on which is a little _carafe_ of green =
Chartreuse and a liqueur-

glass; he also hands to the young fellow a box of big full-flavoured cigars=

"Dutch courage, Lammy, my boy," remarked Spunyarn, as he calmly helps himse=

youth's cigars.  "You'd be doing the same, Shirtings, if you'd been hit at =
this beast of a game as I=20

have."  "Shirtings" was the playful name bestowed on the noble lord, in ref=
erence to the well-

known fact that the Spunyarn money had been made in a Manchester cotton mil=
