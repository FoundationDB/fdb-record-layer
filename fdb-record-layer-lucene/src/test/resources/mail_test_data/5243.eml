philodendron monstera offered such an affront as they did through Mr. Drive=
r to his bumptious nation.  The Yankee merchant and citizen, as I have said=
, didn't surrender to his adjudication in obedience to a printed and writte=
n summons, which he received. He treated that "big broad slip of paper" the=
 harbor, lies about the center of the town, with a long strip of sandy beac=
h before it.  For some weeks the weather had been gloomy and capricious. Th=
e time of the vernal equinox was at hand, and a low area storm of unusual v=
iolence might be expected at any time. During the philodendron monstera off=

however, be extended to 3000_l._ or 4000_l._, instead of 2000_l._; and noth=

representative of their exiled king. The few American residents and frequen=
ters of the islands=20

approved this, deeming the act of the Germans one of unjustifiable aggressi=

At the outset, Tamasese=E2=80=99s strong=20

accidents against which no human foresight can guard; and if the bright ple=
asant road to ruin gets=20

you to a judge, and a=20

prison, or a hulk. That I take to be one of the inevitable contingencies wh=
ich any swindler will look=20

fairly in the face--avoid it, if he can; and if not, then meet it with calm=
ness and resignation.  The=20

Yankee did not, however, as I am told, understand this practical method of =
commercial swindling,=20

and he would have inevitably come to grief if he had been an Englishman. Th=
e reader may as well=20

bear that little fact in mind. A great man once observed that, although man=
y persons resolved to=20

live by their wits, the vast majority of those who tried the experiment got=
 half starved by a scarcity=20

of the material for that sort of existence.  The penal clauses of the New B=
ankruptcy Act are also to=20

be kept in view as things to avoid, for I see by the Old-Bailey intelligenc=
e they are being enforced=20

with terrible severity. If caught and discovered offending against any of t=
he primary canons of=20

mercantile jurisprudence, the weight of punishment is heavy. The reader mus=

holding horses at the West End of the metropolis, hawking ballads, vending =
penny and the fear of=20

German interference, gave him a very large party. But in the half-dozen fie=
rce battles that were=20

fought he was decidedly worsted, and, forced to flee from the capital, Apia=
, he shut himself up in a=20

native fortress eight miles distant.  The Germans had in the meantime activ=
ely espoused his=20

cause, and went so far as to bombard several native villages. Still they di=
d not come into direct=20

personal collision with the natives until December, 1888. A body of Germans=
 landed a few miles=20

from Apia, and assaulted Mataafa=E2=80=99s forces.  The island blood was up=
. The battle was stubbornly=20

contested. The Germans were utterly routed and driven back to their vessels=
 with a loss of fifty=20

killed and wounded.  This is precisely the sort of pretext a =E2=80=9Cprote=
cting=E2=80=9D power desires. In great=20

indignation at the pesky people who had failed to allow themselves to be th=
rashed, the Germans=20

formally declared war, and began a series of high-handed seizures and aggre=
ssions. The interests=20

of other nations in Samoa were endangered. There was but one American man-o=
f-war in the=20

harbor.  As soon as the War Department learned of the state of affairs, rei=
nforcements were sent=20

out, and it seemed highly probable that a collision between America and Ger=
many might be=20

precipitated at any moment. Thus, there were collected in the harbor the Am=
erican warship=20

_Trenton_, the flag-ship of Rear-Admiral Kimberly, and one of the largest v=
essels in the navy, N.=20

H. Farquhar, Commander: the _Nipsic_, Commander D. W. Mullan; and the _Vand=
alia_,=20

Commander C. M. Schoonmaker. The Germans were represented by the warship _O=
lga_, and the=20

cruisers _Eber_ and _Adler_. England had sent the man-of-war _Calliope_. In=
 addition, there were=20



in the harbor ten or twelve schooners and trading vessels. Such was the for=
ce assembled at Apia,=20

March 15, 1889.  The news does not travel rapidly from that portion of the =
world. During the spring=20

a report reached America that the looked-for collision between the assemble=
d forces had=20

occurred, and that the _Nipsic_ had been sunk by the _Olga_. There was much=
 suppressed=20

excitement; but as the report was not officially confirmed, this soon cease=
d.  No one was prepared=20

for the actual occurrence, or the magnitude of the calamity.  The town of A=
pia, the Samoan capital,=20

lies around a small circular bay. Across the mouth of the harbor,=20

or a life of idleness in a union workhouse.  But I am moralising, preaching=
, or sermonising, instead=20

of telling my story.  Well. Mr. Abraham Driver had run his career in ten mo=
nths. During this time it=20

was believed that he had, however, to use a vulgar term, "made a purse," or=
 "feathered his nest."=20

He had realised considerable sums by hypothecating and selling goods, getti=
ng advances on bills=20

of lading, &c. Where the money had gone to, his creditors were anxious to k=
now. They believed he=20

could pay 20_s._ in the pound. As a matter of fact, he didn't pay 1_s._ in =
the pound.  Abraham=20

Driver, merchant, dealer, and chapman, as he was described in legal process=
es, was adjudicated=20

a bankrupt. He didn't surrender. Perhaps, if his creditors had had an adequ=
ate idea of the dignity=20

of American citizenship, or the sanctity of the stars and stripes, or the r=
eef, which is visible at low=20

water. A break in the reef a quarter of a mile in width forms the entrance =
to the harbor. Only a=20

small portion of the latter is available for anchorage, as the eastern part=
 is quite shallow, and on=20

the west the bay has a small fringing reef well out from the shore. It will=
 be seen that the crowded=20

condition of the harbor rendered it peculiarly perilous. The war vessels we=
re anchored in the deep=20

water, the _Eber_ and _Nipsic_ being nearest the shore. The schooners and l=
ighter craft were in=20

the shoal water next to the fringing reef on the west side of the harbor.  =

cottages, built after the native pattern: low, of elastic materials, and bo=
und well together; so that=20

the low houses, swaying easily with the wind, are not so easily blown away =
as structures of stiffer=20

and more pretentious build. The=20
