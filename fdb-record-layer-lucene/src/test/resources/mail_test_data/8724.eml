to the oars. Had the raft gone to pieces half an hour sooner, he would have=
 been in a dangerous=20

position; for it is doubtful if he could have clung to one of the logs long=
 enough to drift to the shore=20

without becoming totally exhausted.  The boys on the island did not witness=
 the end of Harry's raft,=20

for it was too far away when the accident occurred for them to see anything=
 but a little black dot on=20

the water. They became, however, very anxious about him as the hours went b=
y and he did not=20

come back. Tom was especially uneasy, and blamed himself for permitting Har=
ry to audience, till=20

at last the singing and the frequent glasses of Carlon made payador and neg=
ro feel that the time=20

had come to leave off contrapunto and decide which was most talented in mus=
ic, with their facons.=20

A personal allusion to the colour of the negro=E2=80=99s skin, a retort cal=
ling in question the nice conduct of=20

the sister of the payador, and then two savages foaming at the mouth, their=
 ponchos wrapped=20

round their arms, their bodies bent so as to protect their vitals, and thei=
r knives quivering like=20

snakes, stood in the middle of the room.  The company withdrew=20

He thought of making another raft and going in search of Harry; but there w=
ere no more strings=20

with which to fasten logs together, and he did not quite like to tear up hi=
s clothes and use them for=20

that purpose. He did, however, resolve that, if Harry did not come in sight=
 within another hour, he=20

would take a small log, and, putting it under his arms, try to swim to the =
mainland and borrow a=20

boat, if one could be found, in which to search for his comrade. He was spa=
red this hazardous=20

experiment; for toward the end of the afternoon Harry and the _Whitewing_ c=
ame in sight, and=20

were welcomed with a tremendous cheer.  Tom took the boat and went for prov=
isions, and when=20

he returned the _Whitewing_ was not only dragged on shore, but fastened to =
two different trees=20

with two distinct ropes. The boys were determined that she should not escap=
e again; and when=20

Joe proposed that somebody should sit up with her all night, so that she co=
uld not cut the ropes=20

and run away, Tom seriously considered the proposal. The next day a snug li=
ttle dock was built, in=20

which she seemed quite contented, and from which she could not escape witho=
ut climbing over a=20

stone breakwater--a feat of which there was no reason to believe that she w=
as capable.  [TO BE=20

aded urchins=20

were sitting round the table chattering like so many magpies. The tall cloc=
k in the corner insisted=20

on talking too.    "Tick-tock--tick-tock.   'Tis eight--o'clock;   Come, bo=
ys--cease noise,   Quick=20

tread--to bed;   'Tis eight--o'clock.   Tick-tock--tick-tock."  That is wha=
t it said.  Then it rang out=20

eight clear strokes, and and at the door the faces of the women looked in d=
elight, whilst the=20

 and whilst outside the=20

practising all the tricks they knew, as kicking their adversary=E2=80=99s h=
orse in the chest, riding beside=20

their opponent and trying to lift him from his seat by placing their foot u=
nderneath his and pushing=20

upwards, an aged Gaucho had gradually become the centre figure of the scene=
.  Seated alone he=20

dead for twenty years.  Tall and with straggling iron-grey locks hanging do=
wn his back, a broad-

brimmed plush hat kept in its place by a black ribbon with two tassels unde=
r his chin, a red silk=20

Chinese handkerchief tied loosely round his neck and hanging with a point o=

moon seemed to wink waggishly at the children.  "Hurry! scurry! Here it is =
eight o'clock, going on=20

nine--next comes ten--eleven--twelve. Half the night gone, and you not in b=
ed yet."  How its eyes=20

twinkled! It nearly burst its fat cheeks laughing at its own joke.  Out the=
 door, up the uncarpeted=20

stairs, clattered the boys--Solomon and Isaac, Elias and John, Philemon and=
 the hind-leg of a=20
