While the Hurons and their ministering Jesuits were living in fancied security in their corner of the west, the French in Quebec and Three Rivers were in constant _
summons that the door trembled, and Tom started to his feet in some alarm.  "Hello there!" he 

cried. "Don't break the door, Koku!" and then he laughed. "No one but my giant would knock like 

that," he said to himself. "He never does seem able to do things gently. But I wonder why he is 

knocking. I told him to get the engine out of the airship, and Eradicate said he'd be around to 

answer the telephone and bell. I wonder if anything has happened?"  Tom shoved back his chair, 

pushed aside the mass of papers over which he had been puzzling, and strode to the door. 

Flinging it open he confronted a veritable giant of a man, nearly every obstacle, and established a 

mission at Thonatiria, on Georgian Bay.  At first the Jesuits were opposed by the tribe, who 

foolishly regarded all their sacraments and services as the deeds of sorcerers. Whenever any evil 

happened to any of them, when the crops were frost-bitten, or even when a child fell ill, the Hurons

Say, I couldn't hear anything else!" exclaimed Tom. "Did you think you had to arouse the whole 

neighborhood just to let me know you were at the door? Jove!  I thought you'd have it off the 

hinges."  "If me break, me fix," said Koku, who, from his appearance and from his imperfect 

command of river emptying into Matchedash Bay, they founded other missions, St. Louis, St. 

Jean, St. Michael, St. Joseph, in all the country round about.  In course of a very few years the 

missionaries came almost to be the rulers of all the tribes there settled.  But the Iroquois hate 

against the Hurons was fast fanning into flame.  Having sworn vengeance upon them because of 

their alliance {60} with the French, sooner or later they would find them out, and then, alas, the
