CHAPTER VII  THE GREEK HOUSE   1. The Greeks, having no use for atriums, do=
 not build=20

them, but make passage-ways for people entering from the front door, not ve=
ry wide, with stables=20

on one side and doorkeepers' rooms on the other, and shut off by doors at t=
he inner end. This=20

place between the two doors is termed in Greek [Greek: thyroreion]. From it=
 one enters the=20

peristyle. This peristyle has colonnades on three sides, and on the side fa=
cing the south it has two=20

antae, a considerable distance apart, carrying an architrave, with a recess=
 for a distance one third=20

less than the space between the antae. This space is called by some writers=
 "prostas," by others=20

"pastas."  [Illustration: PLAN OF VITRUVIUS' GREEK HOUSE ACCORDING TO BECKE=
R]  2.=20

Hereabouts, towards the inner side, are the large rooms in which mistresses=
 of houses sit with=20

their wool-spinners. To the right and left of the prostas there are part in=
 private theatricals, and the=20

upshot of it all was that when she left school she came to me and announced=
 that she was born to=20

be an actress.  I had never shared Katya's inclinations for the theatre. To=
 my mind, if a play is=20

good there is no need to trouble the actors in order that it may make the r=
ight impression; it is=20

enough to read it. If the play is poor, no acting will make it good.  In my=
 youth I often visited the=20

theatre, and now my family takes a box twice a year and carries me off for =
a little distraction. Of=20

course, that is not enough to give me the right to judge of the theatre. In=
 my opinion the theatre=20

has become no better than it was thirty or forty years ago. Just as in the =
past, I can never find a=20

glass of clean water in the corridors or foyers of the theatre. Just as in =
the past, the attendants fine=20

me twenty kopecks for my fur coat, though there is nothing reprehensible in=
 wearing a warm coat=20

in winter. As in the past, for no sort of reason, music is played=20
