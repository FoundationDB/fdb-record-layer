philodendron monstera it would be horizontally half in and half out of the thing, held fast in the vain endeavour to get away. So he waited for the next "arrive" to come with commendable fortitude. And then it came. It sounded like the old grand-daddy of young parrots in their nests, and in eating makes use of its hands like the monkeys and the maniveris, or kinkajous. They call it the guachi; it is, no doubt, a coati, perhaps the Viverra nasua, which I saw wild in Mexico.

some American Ambulance boys on the French Front, when we noticed the arrives were landing 

regularly so we knew that the Germans were after something in the neighbourhood--perhaps a big 

gun, perhaps an ammunition dump. We were speculating upon the nature of the target when we 

whirled around a corner and saw it. It was a cross-road. Four roads forked there; the Germans, of 

course, had it marked. It was getting its afternoon pour parler; for they believed that the 

ammunition trains would be passing that cross-road at that time. And as we looked out of the 

windows of the ambulance our hearts jumped--at least Henry's and mine jumped--as we saw that 

between us and the forks of the road a great French camion had skidded and stalled, with two 

wheels over the embankment that raised the road from the swamp about us, effectually blocking 

our way. "This," said Major Murphy, animal, but easily tamed. Its long and stout beak serves to 

defend it at a distance. It makes itself master of the house, steals whatever it can come at, and 

loves to bathe often and fish on the banks of the river. The toucan we had bought was very young; 

yet it took delight, during the whole voyage, in teasing the cusicusis, or nocturnal monkeys, which 

are melancholy and irritable. I did not observe what has been related in some works of natural 

history, that the toucan is forced, from the structure of its beak, to swallow its food by throwing it 

up into the air. It raises it indeed with some difficulty from the ground, but, having once seized it 

with the point of its enormous beak, it has only to lift it up by throwing back its head, and holding it 

perpendicularly whilst in the act of swallowing. This bird makes extraordinary gestures when 

preparing to drink. The

dangerous place." As the word "place" escaped him he was on the ground. He had slid through a 

window of the ambulance. The ambulance drivers--Singer and Hughes--neglecting to unlock the 

ambulance doors, ran up the road and began working with the drivers of the camion to get the 

great van on the road again. The other occupants of the ambulance also hurried to the camion--

through the windows of the ambulance; no one was left to unbutton the thing for Henry and me. 

Henry insists that he was there alone; that he was afraid to follow me through the window for fear 

of sticking in it. He had not been avoiding fats, sugars and say that it makes the sign of the cross 

upon the water; and this popular belief has obtained for the toucan, from the creoles, the singular 

name of diostede.* (* Dios te de, God gives it thee.)  Most of our animals were confined in small 

wicker cages; others ran at full liberty in all parts of the boat. At the approach of rain the macaws 

sent forth noisy cries, the toucan wanted to reach the shore to fish, and the little monkeys (the titis) 

went in search of Father Zea, to take shelter in the large sleeves of his Franciscan habit. These 

incidents sometimes amused us so much that we forgot the torment of the mosquitos.

girlish lines in his figure. And the arrives were certainly bouncing in rather brashly. The rest of us 

were out in the open where we could duck and perhaps avoid the spray of shrapnel. But an 

ambulance was no more protection against fifty pounds of German junk than an umbrella. And 

there sat Henry in the ambulance wistfully looking through the window of the vehicle and realizing 

that his exposure was less in a our provisions, in the centre; then our instruments, and the cages 

of our animals; our hammocks were suspended around the cages, and beyond were those of the 

Indians. The exterior circle was formed by the fires which are lighted to keep off the jaguars. Such 

was the order of our encampment on the banks of the Cassiquiare. The Indians often spoke to us 

of a little nocturnal animal, with a long nose, which surprises
