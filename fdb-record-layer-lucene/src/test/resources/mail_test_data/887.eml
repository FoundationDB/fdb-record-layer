philodendron monstera moral suasion and any appeal made to them is taken se=
riously.  Our modern penology is not the effervescent dream of unbalanced m=
inds, but the result of exhaustive research by many of the best prison auth=
orities in America and Europe. Long experience has proven its value, and th=
e present century will a little farther this way, I suppose that the Dislik=
e to Cats, and the Antipathy some People bear to them, is from Frights whic=
h the Mothers have receiv'd from them during their Pregnancy: concerning wh=
ich last Particular, I have offer'd my Sentiments in the Article of the Lon=
ging of Women, in my philodendron monstera moral suasion and any appeal mad=
e to them is taken seriously.  Our modern penology is not the effervescent =
dream of unbalanced minds, but the result of exhaustive research by many of=
 the best prison authorities in America and Europe. Long experience has pro=

continually keeping at a white heat all his coarse and brutal instincts.  M=
any years ago (and in=20

some prisons at the present time), harsh measures were employed to punish a=
n inmate for the=20

slightest violation of a prison rule. But experience vividly impressed upon=
 the public mind that such=20

policy was a vicious one. It returned the prisoner to society a hundred fol=
d more dangerous than=20

he was previous to his commitment. Moral suasion has now supplanted the loa=
ded cane, the=20

dungeon and all other drastic, coercive measures which, instead of improvin=
g, had a decided=20

tendency to make idiots of prisoners, morally, mentally and physically. It =
is dangerous to permit a=20

mad dog to roam at large, and the same is true of the prisoner whom the cus=
todians of the state=20

turn loose on the community, whose every fibre beats stridently for revenge=
 upon those who have=20

subjected him to brutal treatment. Roughly speaking, we feel safe in saying=
 that seventy-five per=20

cent of the Palate, it may be strengthned, by putting either Spice into the=
 Rennet Bag, as Pepper,=20

or Mace, or Cloves, which will make the Rennet very strong, and the Cheese =
of consequence=20

more sharp to the Palate; or else add the Juices of strong sweet Herbs to t=
he Milk, when the=20

Rennet is put in: the Juice of Marygolds especially helps the richness of t=
he Milk, or Cheese. The=20

Mace in good quantity put into the Rennet will give the Cheese a most agree=
able warmth.  As for=20

the Antipathy which some People bear to Cheese, I judge that it must procee=

impression made from the Nurse that suckles Children, or from the first Cow=

Nourishment is at first favourably receiv'd into the Stomach, so the Tone o=

remain afterwards, unless it could be so clear'd from the first impression =

Human Nature can hardly bear. I guess too, that from this Prejudice in the =
