dracaena marginata bruised, battered, crushed, lay poor little dead Marcus Aurelius. Thus tragically had all his travels ended.  "It's our snake!" cried Oscar, making a Priam chosen not to take off his collar. People said, naturally, that imprisonment for bigamy would have included the taking-off of collars; but then dracaena marginata bruised, battered, crushed, lay poor little dead Marcus Aurelius. Thus tragically had all his travels ended.  "It's our snake!" cried Oscar, making a Priam chosen not to take off his collar. People said, naturally, that imprisonment for bigamy would have included the taking-off of collars; but then _
hastily made a prison, then sallied out to find his captive some mice. They were not the easiest 

thing in the world to get, requiring considerable seeking and talking. He did not venture to tell why 

he wanted mice; and he overheard the housekeeper grumble: "Most extraordinary boys, those 

Americans! Do you expect he wants to _cat_ them?"  By this time Nora was ready; he had hardly 

replaced the snake in the box before he heard her knock at the door. It was a charming day and 

drive, yet I fear he saw little of the scenery. Alas, that it must be confessed, a wicked thought had 

crept into his brain. He coveted Lady Margaret's snake. He coveted it so ardently that he began to 

imagine how easy it would be for him to keep it. There was a man in London who sold snakes. 

Edmund had been up buying some snakes from him which the man was to keep until he should 

want them. What more easy than to send Marcus Aurelius to this saurian boarding-house? Ah, 

what an ugly temptation for Edmund who had been called a good boy from his cradle. He would 

have no more of it. But it came back again and finally, when he reached the inn, he had almost 

decided to keep the snake. "Anyhow I'll take it to Tomlin's" (Tomlin was the snake man), he said to 

himself; "there's no hurry." Yet in his secret soul he knew that once taken to Tomlin's, Marcus 

Aurelius would never return to Lady Margaret. Thus thinking, he went toward the box. The snake 

was gone! Yes, gone, vanished absolutely, leaving no trace either in the box or in the room. Vainly 

and long Edmund searched; either the cover had not fitted exactly, or Marcus, the intelligent 

Marcus, had managed to remove it; in either case he had evidently set off anew on his travels. 

Edmund began to feel he had been a wicked boy. He stood in the centre of the room, trying to 

collect his wits. Oscar's room adjoined his; he could hear Oscar moving about, whistling out of 

tune. Should he go in and search there? Standing irresolute, he heard a loud cry from his cousin. 

"Sloped! gone!" Then followed a muffled sound which Edmund rightly interpreted to be Oscar 

poking under the bed with an umbrella; and, then, came a thundering rap on the door. "Say, Ned," 

called Oscar, entering immediately, "I'm in an awful scrape! Your snake's gone!"  "My snake," 

repeated Edmund, feebly.  "Yes; the one you bought to-day. I saw it in the glass box on your 

table."  Edmund remembered that he had left the box in full view when he went for mice. His face 

grew red. "Did you let it out?" said he.  "Of course I didn't," Oscar answered. "Did you think I'd do 

such a thing? I opened the door to speak to you and I saw it on the table and I remembered you'd 

been talking of buying some snakes, so I knew it was yours. I didn't go into the room at all, but this 

afternoon when I came into my own room, Ned, its little green head was sticking out of my 

overcoat pocket--ugh! I pretty near put my hand on it! I'd have called you, but you'd gone, and it 

wasn't any use calling Aunt Nellie--she'd just jump on the bed and scream; so I didn't know what to 

do, for I can't handle those things like you, marry each other. It was a piece of wild folly on his part; 

but, in the eyes of an impartial person, folly could not excuse his desertion of her, his flight from 

her intellectual charms. His gaze pierced her veil. No, she was not quite so old as Alice. She was 

not more plain than Alice. She certainly knew more than Alice. She could talk about pictures 

without sticking a knife into his soul and turning it in the wound. She was better dressed than Alice. 

And her behaviour on the present occasion, candid, kind, correct, could not have been surpassed 

by Alice. And yet... Her demeanour was without question prodigiously splendid in its ignoring of all 

that she had gone through. And yet... Even in that moment of complicated misery he had enough 

strength to hate her because he had been fool enough to make love to her. No excuse whatever 

for him, of course!  "I was in India when I first heard of this case," Lady Sophia continued. "At first I 



thought it must be a sort of Tichborne business over again. Then, knowing you as I did, I thought 

perhaps it wasn't."  "And as Lady Sophia happens to be in London now," put in Mr. Oxford, "she is 

good enough to give her invaluable evidence on my behalf."  "That is scarcely the way to describe 

it," said Lady Sophia coldly. "I am only here because you compel me to be here by subpoena. It is 

all due to your acquaintanceship with my aunt."  "Quite so, quite so!" Mr. Oxford agreed. "It 

naturally can't be very agreeable to you to have to go into the witness-box and submit to cross-

examination. Certainly not. And I am the more obliged to you for your kindness, Lady Sophia." 

Priam comprehended the situation. Lady Sophia, after his supposed death, had imparted to 

relatives the fact of his engagement, and the unscrupulous scoundrel, Mr. Oxford, had got hold of 

her and was forcing her to give evidence for him. And after the evidence, the joke of every man in 

the street would be to the effect that Priam Farll, rather than marry the skinny spinster, had 

pretended to be dead.  "You see," Mr. Oxford added to him, "the important point about Lady 

Sophia's evidence is that in Paris she saw both you and your valet--the valet obviously a servant, 

and you obviously his master. There can, therefore, be no question of her having been deceived 

by the valet posing as the master. It is a most fortunate thing that by a mere accident I got on the 

tracks of Lady Sophia in time. In the nick of time. Only yesterday afternoon!"  No reference by Mr. 

Oxford to Priam's obstinacy in the matter of collars. He appeared to regard Priam's collar as a 

phenomenon of nature, such as the weather, or a rock in the sea, as something to be accepted 

with resignation! No sign of annoyance with Priam! He was the prince of diplomatists, was Mr. 

Oxford.  "Can I speak to you a minute?" said Lady Sophia to Priam.  Mr. Oxford stepped away with 

a bow.  And Lady Sophia looked steadily at Priam. He had to admit again that she was 

stupendous. She was his capital mistake; but she was stupendous.  At their last interview he had 

embraced her. She had attended his funeral in Westminster 


_
Ned, so I pushed its head down with my tooth brush and pinned up the pocket with my scarf pin. 

Then I waited a while for you, and I thought it had gone into a torpid condition like you read of, and 

Jack Dale came for me to go to see a Punch-and-Judy and when I got back the little deceitful 

beggar had cleared out! I'm awful sorry, Ned."  Edmund from red, had turned pale; he did not lift 

his eyes from the floor; he was feeling more ashamed of himself than he eyes! She could stand 

there calm and urbane in her acceptance of the terrific past. Apparently she forgave.  Said Lady 

Sophia simply, "Now, Mr. Farll, shall I have to give evidence or not? You know it depends on 

you?"  The casualness of her tone was sublime; it was heroic; it made her feet small.  He had 

sworn to himself that he would be cut in pieces before he would aid the unscrupulous Mr. Oxford 

by removing his collar in presence of those dramatic 


_
thought to feel in his life. Poor blundering Oscar whom he had despised had conquered his horror 

of snakes to do a service to a boy who had never given him a pleasant word; while he--_he_ had 

tried to steal Lady Margaret's pet! Now Oscar was avowing his carelessness without a thought of 

concealment, while he could not summon courage to tell the truth.  "It may be in the rooms 

somewhere," he managed to say finally; "and never mind, Oscar, you did your best to keep him." 

"I'm awful sorry, I am, for a fact," said Oscar; "but of course it's my fault. You're good not to row 

me, Ned!"  "Don't!" said Edmund quickly.  "Why"--began Oscar; but his words were drowned by a 

tumult that suddenly arose outside; shrieks, maltreated, and exploited. The entire world had 

meddled with his private business, and he would be cut in pieces before he would display those 

moles which would decide the issue in an instant.  Well, she had cut him in pieces.  "Please don't 

worry," said he in reply. "I will attend to things."  At that moment Alice, who had followed him by a 

later train, appeared.  "Good-morning, Lady Sophia," he said, raising his hat, and left her. 

_Thoughts on Justice_   "Farll takes his collar off." "Witt _v_. Parfitts. Result." These and similar 

placards flew in the Strand breezes. Never in the history of empires had the removal of a starched 

linen collar (size 16-1/2) created one-thousandth part of the sensation caused by 


_
"They've found Marcus! They're killing him!" cried Oscar.  Both boys flew out of the room. "Don't 

kill him!" called Edmund.  "He is our snake!" shouted Oscar.  People opened doors in all directions 

as the boys raced past. One timid woman put her head out of her window, screaming, "Police!" 

until quite a small collar. It was an epoch-making act. It finished the drama of Witt _v_. Parfitts. 

The renowned artistes engaged did not, of course, permit the case to collapse at once. No, it had 

to be concluded slowly and majestically, with due forms and expenses. New witnesses (such as 

doctors) had to be called, and old ones 


_
Another of bolder stamp thought the hotel was on fire and rushed to the rescue with her water jug. 

"Don't kill him!" Oscar and Edmund kept crying, a cry not calculated to reassure the nervous. 

Down the hall dashed the boys. At the far end an instance, had to be recalled, and if the situation 

was ignominious for Priam it was also ignominious for Duncan. Duncan's sole advantage in his 

defeat was that the judge did not skin him alive in the summing up, nor the jury in their verdict. 

England

brooms and umbrellas, was gathered about a fainting chambermaid supported in the arms of a 

waiter and fanned by another chambermaid with a brush broom. Just behind her stood the head 

waiter in his immaculate dress suit, disgust painted on his countenance and a dustpan held aloft in 

his hand.  Something very like a groan burst from Edmund's lips; for, there, on was finally over and 

the renowned artistes engaged had withdrawn enveloped in glory. The truth was that England, so 

proud of her systems, had had a fright. Her judicial methods had very nearly failed to make a man 

take his collar off in public. They had really failed, but it had all come right in the end, and so 

England pretended that they had only just missed
