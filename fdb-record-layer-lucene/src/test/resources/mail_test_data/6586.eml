The two substitutes above mentioned took but little part in affairs. [155]  Several general measures 

enacted by the Cortes touch the Philippines incidentally. [156] The first matter, however, 

specifically connected with the Philippines was the receipt by the Cortes (March 16, 1811) of the 

report of the governor of the Philippines (dated August 8, 1809) in regard to the French vessel 

"Mosca," which had been captured by the parish priest of Batangas (Fray Melchor Fernandez), 

and the despatches carried on that vessel. The reading on April 26, 1812, of the proposed decree 

prescribing the manner of holding elections in the regular Cortes to be convened in 1813, aroused 

lengthy discussion. [157] On May 6, Reyes moved that a special form of election be granted for 

the Philippines because of their distance and the character of their inhabitants. The islands had 

neither the funds nor the men to send by which equality of representation would be justified, and 

he requested that it only be declared that they must not send less than two. An amendment 

offered by the committee on the Constitution proposed that to the instructions regarding the 

elections in Ultramar be added a clause to meet Reyes's wishes, but the matter was hotly 

contested by the American representatives who feared that such a clause might sometime lead to 

the cutting down of their own representation, and as a consequence the proposal of the committee 

was not voted on. [158]  In January, 1813, after recommendation by the committee on Ultramar, it 

was resolved to grant the petition of the board (mesa) of the Misericordia of Manila (which had 

been hanging fire in the Cortes since September 25, forfeit happiness or life,--mistakes not of 

themselves alone, but mistakes of others. The sin or the error belongs to one man; the weight of 

the suffering often falls to another. Even our benevolence seems to be punished; for quite 

frequently the effort to help others brings disaster to ourselves--to our fortunes, to our families, our 

lives. Seeking to rescue another from fire or water, from the assassin or the robber; from the 

domestic tyrant or the foreign invader, we lose life, and, for lack of our help, our children are 

uneducated, exposed to moral evil, neglected, turned out of doors. The very tramp whom, for pity, 

we took in from the street, robs us, or murders us. Meanwhile the Supernatural beholds and 

makes no sign--gives no indication that it is at all concerned.  The suffering which comes through 

unavoidable ignorance, or which is visited upon the innocent through the deeds of the guilty, is, in 

its sum total, appalling and unspeakable. It is a dark and fathomless ocean, whose waves have 

been incessantly beating on the shores of this dreary world since time began. Every drop of this 

mighty ocean has been wrung out through the operation of natural law. An omniscient eye, every 

hour of the day and night, through countless ages, has gazed into these waters of anguish, and 

has declined to lessen their quantity by a single atom. No order from the Supernatural has gone 

forth to countermand any decree of Nature. Man has stood alone, grappling with his antagonist; 

and though he has cried incessantly, heaven has left him to his fate. Could there be a more awful 

demonstration of the supremacy of natural law?  Nature slays in babyhood one-third of all the 

children that are born into the world, just because they have not strength to resist

[159] On January 6, 1813, the proposed ordinances for the hospice for the poor at Manila (the 

establishment of which was provided for by royal order of December 27, 1806), were declared 

unconstitutional by the committee on Ultramar, [160] and that committee's report was adopted. A 

minute in the records of March 11, 1813, shows that the suppression of the brandy monopoly had 

been meanwhile she carefully preserves such tyrants as Tiberius to finish their three score years 

and ten, though every added year means the murder of a thousand of the best men and women to 

be found in a wide empire. Why does not the Supernatural rise up from his place and smite the 

tyrant to the earth? Is it not plain that we are dealing with natural forces alone?  For six thousand 

years--God knows how long--Africa has been a hell, than which perhaps no man need ever fear a

most important measure affecting the Philippines, however, was the suppression of the Acapulco 

galleon. [161] The discussion on the matter was lengthy and bitter, and arose over one of twelve 

propositions submitted by Reyes on February 11, 1813, to the effect that the determined 

suppression of the Acapulco galleon be published, and in its place those engaged in that 

commerce be allowed to fit up private vessels at their own a sinner that as a result of his ways he 

shall be turned black, body and soul, and sent to Africa, there perpetually to renew his life as often 

as it is extinguished by the superstition and fiendishness of his fellows, and the said sinner do not

horrible theater of action perhaps 600,000,000 of human beings have been projected in every 

century, coming without their will to a heritage of nakedness and superstition and
