and the _
calamities, he said, "My soul takes refuge in Thee" (lvii. 1.) "My shield" =
carries us back to the=20

ancient promise, fresh after so many centuries, and fulfilled anew in every=
 age, "Fear not, Abram, I=20

am thy shield," and to his own trustful words at a time when trust was wait=
ing at home on purpose.=20

"Well, old fellow, I think I have got a borough for you, after all. It stup=
idly did not occur to me=20

before, but you are just the man for the constituency."  "I thought you had=
 been to Lady=20

Broadhem's, and were to bring me back some good news,"=20


_
of this glowing series, links on to the hope breathed in the first song of =
his exile, "God is my=20

defence" (the same expression); "Thou hast been my defence in the day of tr=
ouble" (lix. 9, 16).=20

And then he sums up his whole past in one general sentence, which tells his=
 habitual resource in=20

his troubles, and the blessed help which he has ever found, "I call on Jeho=
vah, who is worthy to be=20

praised;[R] and from my enemies am I saved" (verse 3).  [R] The old English=
 word "the worshipful"=20

comes near the form and meaning of the phrase.  No comment can heighten, an=
d no translation=20

can adequately represent, while none can altogether destroy the unapproacha=
ble magnificence of=20

the description which follows, of the majestic coming forth of God in answe=
r to his cry. It stands at=20

the very highest point, even when compared with the other sublime passages =
of a like kind in=20

Scripture. How pathetically he paints his sore need in metaphors which agai=
n bring to mind the=20

songs of the outlaw:--    The snares of death compassed me,   And floods of=
 destruction made me=20

afraid;   The snares of Sheol surrounded me,   The toils of death surprised=
 me.  As he so often=20

likened himself to some wild creature in the nets, so here Death, the hunte=
r, has cast his fatal=20

cords about him, and they are ready suddenly to close on the unsuspecting p=
rey. Or,  "So I have,"=20

I replied, "but I am bound to secrecy for another twenty-four hours; meanti=
me, listen! I am going to=20

retire from Dunderhead. I wrote my address a few days ago, but did not send=
 it. They are therefore=20

quite unprepared. I will retire to-morrow; the nomination is to be in two o=
r three days; and what=20

with the suddenness of the affair and my influence, your return is certain.=
"  "You going to retire!"=20

said Grandon, astounded. "Why, you never told me of this. When did you make=
 up your mind?"  "It=20

made itself up, as it always does," I said, laughing. "It never puts me in =
the painful position of=20

having to decide, but takes its own line at once. I am going to America by =
the next steamer." Now,=20

when I tell my readers that when I began to talk to Grandon I had no intent=
ion whatever of going to=20

America, they will be able to form some idea, if they have not done so alre=
ady, of what a funny=20

mind mine is. It came upon me with the irresistible force of an inspiration=
, and from that moment I=20

was morally booked and bound at all hazards to go.  Grandon knew me so well=
 that he was less=20

surprised than he might have been, and only sighed deeply. He felt at that =
moment that there was=20

something hopelessly wrong about me. He had been so often encouraged by a c=
ertain steadiness=20

which I maintained for some time, and which led him=20
