two had followed me down to the residence of the stickleback family. They m=

reception, however, and, to avoid making trouble, the next day I went to th=
e willow first. But no=20

sooner had the bell begun to ring, than I saw a lot of ripples coming down,=
 and in a second the two=20

factions were in mortal combat. The sticklebacks were fighting not only for=
 breakfast, but for their=20

nests, which were near by; and they made sad work of the poor minnows, who,=
 though smart in=20

some things, did not know when they were whipped, and so kept up the fight,=
 though losing one of=20

their number nearly every morning. The bell now and then rang violently, bu=

sounding an appeal from a voracious stickleback whose appetite had got the =
better of his rage.=20

So it went on every morning. The minnows had learned what the bell meant, a=

defeated in the fight, they in reality had their betters as servants to rin=

meals. Finally, they succeeded, by force of great numbers, in driving away =
their pugnacious little=20

rivals, and the bell hung silent; for, strange to say, they knew what the s=
ound meant, but I could=20

never teach them to ring it, when they could rise and steal the worm from m=
y hand without. But I=20

am inclined to think it was more laziness than inability to learn, as they =
afterward picked up readily=20

some much more difficult tricks. I taught them to leap from the water into =

was Mr. Duncan Farll who, quite unintentionally, supplied the first relief.=
  Duncan pooh-poohed the=20

possibility of Priam being Priam. He detailed all the circumstances that fo=
llowed the death in=20

Selwood Terrace, and showed in fifty ways that Priam could not have been Pr=
iam. The man now=20

masquerading as Priam was not even a gentleman, whereas Priam was Duncan's =
cousin! Duncan=20

was an excellent witness, dry, precise, imperturbable. Under cross-examinat=
ion by Crepitude he=20

had to describe particularly his boyish meeting with Priam. Mr. Crepitude w=
as not inquisitive.  "Tell=20

us what occurred," said Crepitude.  "Well, we fought."  "Oh! You fought! Wh=
at did you two naughty=20

boys fight about?" (Great laughter.)  "About a plum-cake, I think."  "Oh! N=
ot a seed-cake, a plum-

cake?" (Great laughter.)  "I think a plum-cake."  "And what was the result =
of this sanguinary=20

encounter?" (Great laughter.)  "My cousin loosened one of my teeth." (Great=
 laughter, in which the=20

court joined.)  "And what did you do to him?"  "I'm afraid I didn't do much=
. I remember tearing half=20

his clothes off." (Roars of laughter, in which every one joined except Pria=
m and Duncan Farll.)=20

"Oh! You are sure you remember that? You are sure that it wasn't he who tor=
e _your_ clothes=20

off?" (Lots of hysteric laughter.)  "Yes," said Duncan, coldly dreaming in =
the past. His eyes had the=20

'far away' look, as he added, "I remember now that my cousin had two little=
 moles on his neck=20

below the collar. I seem to remember seeing them. I've just thought of it."=
