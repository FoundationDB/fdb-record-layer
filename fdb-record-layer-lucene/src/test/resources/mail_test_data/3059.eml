"Donnez moi some soap here and be mighty blame toot sweet about it!"  Eight inches short in one 

waistband is a catastrophe  One of our party climbed to the roof of the dugout  "Come on! Let's go 

to the abri!"  So we went back--me holding those khaki trousers up by sheer force of will and both 

hands!  He had some trouble lighting his cigarette and was irritated for a second at his 

inconvenience  "Oh, yes," answered the Eager Soul to our enquiring eyes. "Mrs. Chessman--this 

is practically her hospital"  He was a rare bird; this American going on a big drunk on water  Henry 

puffed on his dreadnaught pipe and left the lady from Oklahoma City to me  And he sat cross-

legged  As we sat in the car he came down the street beating a snare drum  They were standing 

on the running board all this time with the train going forty miles an hour  "What part of the States 

do you Canadians come from?"  He told us what happened impersonally as one who is listening to 

another man's story in his own mouth  A fat man can't wear the modern American army uniform 

without looking like a sack of meal  He wore a scarlet coat of unimaginable vividness, a cutaway 

coat of glaring scarlet broadcloth  We thought he might be testing us out as potential spies  And 

we felt like prize boobs suddenly kidnapped from a tacky party and dropped into a grand ball 

"Well now, sir, you wouldn't be wearing those brown shoes to Lord Bryce's tea, would you, Mr. 

White?"     THE MARTIAL ADVENTURES OF HENRY AND ME    CHAPTER I  IN WHICH WE 

BEGIN OUR by the name of the expedition of Solano, the whole country between the missions of 

Javita and San Balthasar was regarded as dependent on Brazil. The Portuguese had advanced 

from the Rio Negro, by the portage of the Cano Pimichin, as far as the banks of the Temi. An 

Indian chief of the name of Javita, celebrated for his courage and his spirit of enterprise, was the 

ally of the Portuguese. He pushed his hostile incursions from the Rio Jupura, or Caqueta, one of 

the great tributary streams of the Amazon, by the rivers Uaupe and Xie, as far as the black waters 

of the Temi and the Tuamini, a distance of more than a hundred leagues. He was furnished with 

letters patent, which authorised him to bring the Indians from the forest, for the conquest of souls. 

He availed himself amply of this permission; but his incursions had an object which was not 

altogether spiritual, that of making slaves to sell to the Portuguese. When Solano, the second chief 

of the expedition of the boundaries, arrived at San Fernando de Atabapo, he had Javita seized, in 

one of his incursions to the banks of the Temi. He treated him with gentleness, and succeeded in 

gaining him over to the interests of the Spanish government by promises that were not fulfilled. 

The Portuguese, who had already formed some stable settlements in these countries, were driven 

back as far as the lower part of the Rio Negro; and the mission of San Antonio, of which the more 

usual name is Javita, so called after its Indian founder, was removed farther north of the

By rights Henry, being the hero of this story, should be introduced in the first line. But really there 

isn't so much to say about Henry--Henry J. Allen for short, as we say in Kansas--Henry J. Allen, 

editor and owner of the Wichita Beacon. And to make the dramatis personae complete, we may 

consider me as the editor of the Emporia Gazette, and the two of us as short, fat, bald, middle-

aged, inland Americans, from fresh water colleges in our youth and arrived at New York by way of 

an often devious, yet altogether happy route, leading through politics where it was rough going 

and unprofitable for years; through business where we still find it easy to it is now established. 

This captain, Javita, was still living, at an advanced age, when we proceeded to the Rio Negro. He 

was an Indian of great vigour of mind and body. He spoke Spanish with facility, and preserved a 

certain influence over the neighbouring nations. As he attended us in all our herborizations, we 

obtained from his own mouth information so much the more useful, as the missionaries have great 

confidence in his veracity. He assured us that in his youth he had seen almost all the Indian tribes 

that inhabit the vast regions between the Upper Orinoco, the Rio Negro, the Inirida, and the 

Jupura, eat human flesh. The Daricavanas, the
