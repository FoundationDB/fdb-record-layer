"They would have carried him to Greenwich," he _
attached, as the visitor may prove by examining it at his leisure.       It=
 represents a moonlit=20

landscape, but the moon is not at all       motionless and dead; quite the =
reverse, for, according to=20

the Abbe,       one would say that our moon herself, or at least her living=
 double,       lighted the=20

picture. Each phase, each aspect, each movement of our       satellite, is =
repeated in her facsimile,=20

in the movement and       progress of the moon in the sacred picture. "You =
see this planet in=20

the out of prison and take him to Greenwich, where a vessel was waiting."  =
"And knowing all that,=20

your honor remained here, far from the city, tranquil and inactive."  "Tran=
quil, yes," replied=20

Cromwell. "But who told you I was inactive?"  "But--if the plot had succeed=
ed?"  "I wished it to do=20

so."  "I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles I. as a mi=
sfortune necessary to=20

the welfare of England."  "Yes, his death; but it would have been more seem=
ly not upon the=20

scaffold."  "Why so?" asked Mordaunt.=20

"Impossible; my precautions were taken."  "And does your honor know the fou=

undertook to rescue him?"  "The four Frenchmen, of whom two were sent by th=
e queen to her=20

husband and two by Mazarin to me."  "And do you think Mazarin commissioned =
them to act as=20

they have done?"  "It is possible. But he will not avow it."  "How so?"  "B=
ecause they failed."  "Your=20

honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting=
 for Charles I. Now=20

"Take them," said Cromwell.  Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant fero=

d by no means=20

penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell's.  "I was so situated as to hear a=

answered.  It was now Cromwell's turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt, and Mord=
aunt to make himself=20

impenetrable.  "It appears," said Cromwell, "that this improvised execution=
er did his duty=20

remarkably well. The blow, so they tell me at least, was struck with a mast=
er's hand."  Mordaunt=20

remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account, and h=
e was now quite=20

convinced that the general had been present at the execution, hidden behind=
 some screen or=20

curtain.  "In fact," said Mordaunt, with a calm voice and immovable counten=
ance, "a single blow=20

sufficed."  "Perhaps it was some one in that occupation," said Cromwell.  "=
Do you think so, sir? He=20

did not look like an executioner."  "And who else save an executioner would=
 have wished to fill that=20

horrible office?"  "But," said Mordaunt, "it might have been some personal =
enemy of the king, who=20
