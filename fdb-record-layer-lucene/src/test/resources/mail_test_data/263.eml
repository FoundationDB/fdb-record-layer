he spirit, if spirit it=20

was, is able to convey to you the secret it's been          trying to get o=
ff its mind for hundreds of=20

years.          You've saved me from the bankruptcy court, and it's        =
  a debt of gratitude you'll=20

find I shan't lightly          forget.'           "It was a very jovial Chr=
istmas which we spent          that=20

day, for the news of the find got abroad at          daylight, and we were =
promptly visited by the=20

butcher and baker, bringing stores of good cheer          and profuse apolo=
gies for past=20

misunderstandings;          even the severe old servant relapsed into smile=
s as          she bore in a=20

smoking sirloin of beef. Jack's          spirits rose to the wildest pitch,=
 and little          Bessie, who=20

persisted in calling me the savior of          the family credit, could sca=
rcely do enough to show=20

her gratitude. Jack wanted me to share the best of          the jewels with=
 him, and was so annoyed=20

at my          refusal that I could only gain peace by a hint that         =
 I should sometime ask him for=20

something more          valuable still. And I got my way, for my unexpected=
          visit lengthened=20

out to a stay of some weeks,          during which pretty Bessie's gratitud=
e had time to          ripen=20

into a warmer feeling. So in the end it was          quite a different trea=
sure which I bore away from=20

Dacrepool Grange, and I feel equally with Jack that          I have cause t=
o remember that strange=20

Christmas          Eve, and to render my thanks to old Sir Godfrey,        =
  who now sleeps soundly in=20

his grave, secure in the          accomplishment of his mission, having rid=
 his soul          of the=20

burden of his secret and restored luck to          Dacrepool."  "Is it true=
?" asked Sheila, as Canon=20

Clark folded up his manuscript.  "Well, I can hardly call it a personal rem=
iniscence, but you must=20

allow for author's license. Old historic houses sometimes have secret hidin=
g-places, and dreams=20

are undoubtedly strange things. It's all founded upon legends which I have =
heard. Mrs. Clark and I=20

first met in an ancient grange not at all unlike of the Meta, that their he=
ight is only forty or fifty=20

toises above the level of the sea. The fall of the rivers is extremely gent=
le, often nearly=20

imperceptible; and therefore the least wind, or the swelling of the Orinoco=
, causes a reflux in those=20

rivers that flow into it. The Indians believe themselves to be descending d=
uring a whole day, when=20

navigating from the mouths of these rivers to their sources. The descending=
 waters are separated=20

from those that flow back by a great body of stagnant water, in which, the =
equilibrium being=20

disturbed, whirlpools are formed very dangerous for boats.  The chief chara=
cteristic of the=20

savannahs or steppes of South America is the absolute want of hills and ine=
qualities--the perfect=20

level of every part of the soil. Accordingly the Spanish conquerors, who fi=
rst penetrated from Coro=20

to the banks of the Apure, did not call them deserts or savannahs, or meado=
ws, but plains (llanos).=20

Often within a distance of thirty square leagues there is not an eminence o=
f a foot high. This=20

resemblance to the surface of the sea strikes the imagination most powerful=
ly where the plains are=20

altogether destitute of palm-trees; and where the mountains of the shore an=
d of the Orinoco are so=20

distant that they cannot be seen, as in the Mesa de Pavones. A person would=
 be tempted there to=20

take the altitude of the sun with a quadrant, if the horizon of the land we=
re not constantly misty on=20

account of the variable effects of refraction. This equality of surface is =
still more perfect in the=20

meridian of Calabozo, than towards the east, between Cari, La Villa del Pao=
, and Nueva=20

Barcelona; but it extends without interruption from the mouths of the Orino=
co to La Villa de Araure=20

and to Ospinos, on a parallel of a hundred and eighty leagues in length; an=
d from San Carlos to=20

the savannahs of Caqueat, on a meridian of two hundred leagues. It particul=
arly characterises the=20

New Continent, as it does the low steppes of Asia, between the Borysthenes =
and the Volga,=20



between the Irtish and the Obi. The deserts of central Africa, of Arabia, S=
yria, and Persia, Gobi,=20

and Casna, present, on the contrary, many inequalities, ranges of hills, ra=
vines without water, and=20

rocks which pierce the sands.  The Llanos,=20


_
we didn't find treasure behind the paneling we certainly ought to have done=
 so. Now I'm extremely=20

sorry to have to hurry you, but I promised Miss Morley that you should be b=
ack at school by half=20

past six, and I undertook to escort you through the town. I hope you'll all=
 come and have tea with=20

us some afternoon next term and we'll have another competition. Don't say g=
ood-by to Mrs. Clark.=20

Give the Italian 'A rivederci' instead, because that means not a parting gr=
eeting but 'May we see=20

one another again.'"     CHAPTER XV  Peachy's Birthday   Delia Watts, walki=
ng one afternoon=20

along the lemon pergola, came across a small group of Camellia Buds ensconc=
ed in a cozy corner=20

at the foot of the steps by the fountain.  "Hello! You've found a dandy pla=
ce here. You look so=20

comfy. May I join on?" she chirped.  "Sure_lee_!" said Jess cordially, push=
ing Irene farther along=20

to make room. "Come and squat down, dearie, and add your voice to the powwo=
w. We're just=20

discussing something fearfully urgent and important. Do you know it'll be P=
eachy's birthday next=20

week?"  "Of course I know. Nobody could room with Peachy and not hear about=
 that. She's the=20

most excited girl on earth. She's been promised a gold wrist-watch and a mo=
rocco hand-bag, and I=20

can't tell you what else, and she's just living till she gets them. I wish =
it was my birthday. I'm=20

jealous!"  "Don't be such a pig," responded Jess. "You got your fun in the =
holidays. You can't have=20

things twice over. What we were talking about was this--the sorority ought =
to rally somehow and=20

give Peachy a surprise. Can't we get up a special stunt?"  "Rather! Put me =
on the committee,=20

please! Couldn't we get leave for a dormitory tea? I know Miss Rodgers rath=
er frowned on them=20

last term, but perhaps if we wheedled Miss Morley she'd say 'yes.' We'd pro=
mise to clear up and=20

not make any mess, and to finish promptly before prep time. That ought to c=
ontent her. What=20

votes?"  Every hand ascended with enthusiasm.  "Good for you, Delia!" compl=
imented Jess. "We=20

haven't had a dormitory tea for just ages; not, in fact, since Aggie upset =
the spirit-lamp. I think Miss=20

Morley's forgotten that now, though. You must do the asking yourself. You'r=
e our champion=20

wheedler. If anybody can soften Miss Morley's hard heart it will be you. Te=
ll her Peachy will be=20

homesick, and we feel it'll be our duty to cheer her up a little."  "I'll p=
itch it as strong as I can," said=20

Delia, "but of course it's no use going too far. Peachy doesn't look a home=
sick subject in need of=20

cheering. I'm afraid Miss Morley may snort if I put it on that score. I'd b=
etter just explain we want to=20

have a stunt. I believe she'll catch on. Leave it to me and I'll try my bes=
t to manage her."  "Right-o!=20

We give you carte blanche!"  "Then I'll waddle off now."  Delia's success m=
ostly depended upon=20

tact. She judged that if she asked Miss Morley, tired at the end of a busy =
morning, she would=20

probably meet with a curt refusal, but that if she found her, seated in her=
 own bed-sitting-room,=20

soothed with afternoon tea and reading a delectable book, her sympathy woul=
d be much more=20

readily aroused. On this occasion Delia's judgment was correct. After a per=
fectly harmonious=20

interview with the Principal she scurried back to her fellow Camellia Buds,=
 her face one satisfied=20

grin.  "She said, 'Certainly, my dear!' We may ask Elvira for a special tea=
pot and a plate of bread=20

and butter, and we may give Antonio three lira apiece to buy us cakes. We m=
ay do what we like so=20

long as the room is tidy again before prep. She'll send a prefect at 5.45 s=
urface, present two kinds=20

of inequalities, which cannot escape the observation of the traveller. The =
first is known by the=20

name of banks (bancos); they are in reality shoals in the basin of the step=
pes, fractured strata of=20

sandstone, or compact limestone, standing four or five feet higher than the=
 rest of the plain. These=20

banks are sometimes three or four leagues in length; they are entirely smoo=
th, with a horizontal=20

surface; their existence is perceived only by examining their margins. The =
second species of=20



inequality can be recognised only by geodesical or barometric levellings, o=
r by the course of rivers.=20

It is called a mesa or table, and is composed of small flats, or rather con=
vex eminences, that rise=20

insensibly to the height of a few toises. Such are, towards the east, in th=
e province of Cumana, on=20

the north of the Villa de la Merced and Candelaria, the Mesas of Amana, of =
Guanipa, and of=20

Jonoro, the direction of which is south-west and north-east; and which, in =
spite of their=20

inconsiderable elevation, divide the waters between the Orinoco and the nor=
thern coast of Terra=20

Firma. The convexity of the savannah alone occasions this partition: we the=
re find the dividing of=20

the waters (divortia aquarum* (* "C. Manlium prope jugis [Tauri] ad divorti=
a aquarum castra=20

posuisse." Livy lib. 38 c. 75.)), as in Poland, where, far from the Carpath=
ian mountains, the plain=20

itself divides the waters between the Baltic and the Black Sea. Geographers=
, who suppose the=20

existence of a chain of mountains wherever there is a line of division, hav=
e not failed to mark one=20

in the maps, at the sources of the Rio Neveri, the Unare, the Guarapiche, a=
nd the Pao. Thus the=20

priests of Mongol race, according to ancient and superstitious custom, erec=
t oboes, or little=20

mounds of stone, on every point where the rivers flow in an opposite direct=
ion.  The uniform=20

landscape of the Llanos; the extremely small number of their inhabitants; t=
he fatigue of travelling=20

beneath a burning sky, and an atmosphere darkened by dust; the view of that=
 horizon, which=20

seems for ever to fly before us; those lonely trunks of palm-trees, which h=
ave all the same aspect,=20

and which we despair of reaching, because they are confounded with other tr=
unks that rise by=20

degrees on the visual horizon; all these causes combine to make the steppes=
 appear far more=20

extensive than they are in reality. The planters who inhabit the southern d=
eclivity of the chain of=20

the coast see the steppes extend towards the south, as far as the eye can r=
each, like an ocean of=20

verdure. They know that from the Delta of the Orinoco to the province of Va=
rinas, and thence, by=20

traversing the banks of the Meta, the Guaviare, and the Caguan, they can ad=
vance three hundred=20

and eighty leagues* (* This is the distance from Timbuctoo to the northern =
coast of Africa.) into the=20

plains, first from east to west, and then from north-east to south-east bey=
ond the Equator, to the=20

foot of the Andes of Pasto. They know by the accounts of travellers the Pam=
pas of Buenos Ayres,=20

which are also Llanos covered with fine grass, destitute of trees, and fill=
ed with oxen and horses=20

become wild. They suppose that, according to the greater part of our maps o=
f America, this=20

continent has only one chain of mountains, that of the Andes, which stretch=
es from south to north;=20

and they form a vague idea of the contiguity of all the plains from the Ori=
noco and the Apure to the=20

Rio de la Plata and the Straits of Magellan.  Without stopping here to give=
 a mineralogical=20

description of the transverse chains which divide=20


_
place is in a muddle it'll be the last time, so we'd better be careful, for=
 I could see she meant that."=20

"We're in luck!" cried Irene, giving a bounce of rapture.  "It's great!"  "=
Yummy!"  "I thought you'd=20

congratulate me," smirked Delia. "Now let's get busy and decide what sort o=
f a stunt we mean to=20

have. Is Peachy to know, or is it to be a surprise?"  "That's the question!=
 She'll have to be told and=20

invited and all the rest of it, but she needn't hear any details beforehand=
. I vote we all arrange to=20

come in fancy costume--that would really be a stunt."  "We shall have to te=
ll Peachy _that_!"  "No,=20

you mustn't. We'll have a costume all ready prepared for her, like the wedd=
ing garment in the=20

parable. She'll have nothing to do but slip it on."  If Peachy was looking =
forward to her own=20

birthday, her friends were anticipating the happy event with enthusiasm. Th=
ey had decided to hold=20

the festivities in her dormitory, but had required her to give a solemn ple=
dge not to enter the room=20

after 2 p.m. so as to give them a free hand. During the half-hour before dr=
awing-class they met,=20

and held a "Decoration Bee." Nine determined girls, who have prepared their=
 materials, can work=20

wonders in a short time, and in ten hurried minutes they accomplished a vas=
t amount.  "Mary, lend=20

a hand, and help me stand on the dressing table."  "She won't know the plac=
e when she sees it!"=20

"Aren't we all busy bees!"  "It begins to look rather nice, doesn't it?"  "=
Don't tug this chain! It's=20

tearing! Now you've done it!"  "I flatter myself she'll get the surprise of=
 her life!"  "_Ra_-ther!"  With=20

flags, paper chains, and garlands of flowers, the decorators contrived to m=
ake dormitory 13 look=20

absolutely _en fete_. They borrowed a table from another bedroom, placed th=
e two together,=20

covered them with a cloth, and spread forth the cakes which Antonio had bee=
n commissioned to=20

buy.  "Elvira will fetch us the teapot and the bread and butter at four. We=
 can yank into sufficient to=20

notice the general structure of a continent, the extremities of which, thou=
gh situated in climates=20

little analogous, nevertheless present several features of resemblance. In =
order to have an exact=20

idea of the plains, their configuration, and their limits, we must know the=
 chains of mountains that=20

form their boundaries. We have already described the Cordillera of the coas=
t, of which the highest=20

summit is the Silla de Caraccas, and which is linked by the Paramo de las R=
osas to the Nevada=20

de Merida, and the Andes of New Grenada. We have seen that, in the tenth de=
gree of north=20

latitude, it stretches from Quibor and Barquesimeto as far as the point of =
Paria. A second chain of=20

mountains, or rather a less elevated but much larger group, extends between=
 the parallels of 3=20

and 7 degrees from the mouths of the Guaviare and the Meta to the sources o=
f the Orinoco, the=20

Marony, and the Essequibo, towards French and Dutch Guiana. I call this cha=
in the Cordillera of=20

Parime, or of the great cataracts of the Orinoco. It may be followed for a =
length of two hundred and=20

fifty leagues; but it is less a chain, than a collection of granitic mounta=
ins, separated by small=20

plains, without being everywhere disposed in lines. The group of the mounta=
ins of Parime narrows=20

considerably between the sources of the Orinoco and the mountains of Demera=
ra, in the Sierras of=20

Quimiropaca and Pacaraimo, which divide the waters between the Carony and t=
he Rio Parime, or=20

Rio de Aguas Blancas. This is the scene of the expeditions which were under=
taken in search of El=20

Dorado, and the great city of Manoa, the Timbuctoo of the New Continent. Th=
e Cordillera of=20

Parime does not join the Andes of New Grenada, but is separated from them b=
y a space eighty=20

leagues broad. If we suppose it to have been destroyed in this space by som=
e great revolution of=20

the globe (which is scarcely probable) we must admit that it anciently bran=
ched off from the Andes=20

between Santa Fe de=20


_
time. Don't let Miss Darrer keep you dawdling about the studio," urged Agne=
s.  "No fear of that.=20

The moment the bell goes it will be 'down pencils.' She can hold forth to t=
he others to-day if she=20

wants to talk after school. By the by, everybody's _so_ jealous of us!"  "I=
 know! The seniors are=20

grumbling like anything because they didn't think of having a bedroom tea f=
or Phyllis. It's their own=20

fault. They haven't another birthday amongst them this term. That's the gri=
evance. And Miss=20

Morley won't give leave for a dormitory stunt unless it's somebody's birthd=
ay. She's firm on that=20

point. We've certainly all the luck."  The Camellia Buds pursued their art =
studies that afternoon=20

with a certain abstraction. Peachy worked with her left wrist poised, so th=
at she could obtain a=20

perpetual view of the new gold watch that had arrived by post that morning;=
 Delia frittered her time=20

shamelessly; Esther was guilty of writing surreptitious messages to Joan up=
on This remark serves=20

to fix more easily in the memory of the reader the geographical position of=
 a Cordillera till now very=20

imperfectly known. A third chain of mountains unites in 16 and 18 degrees s=
outh latitude (by Santa=20

Cruz de la Sierra, the Serranias of Aguapehy, and the famous Campos dos Par=
ecis) the Andes of=20

Peru, to the mountains of Brazil. It is the Cordillera of Chiquitos which w=
idens in the Capitania de=20

Minas Geraes, and divides the rivers flowing into the Amazon from those of =
the Rio de la Plata,* (*=20

There is only a portage or carrying-place of 5322 bracas between the Guapor=
e (a branch of the=20

Marmore and of the Madeira), and the Rio Aguapehy (a branch of the Jaura an=
d of the=20

Paraguay).) not only in the interior of the country, in the meridian of Vil=
la Boa, but also at a few=20
