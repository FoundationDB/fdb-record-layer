Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends 

upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission 

of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in 

machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. 

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status 

with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and 

charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not 

uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received 

written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance 

for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit 

contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no 

prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in Bread sifted, some Flour, some 

Pepper and Salt, some Mace and Nutmeg powder'd, with some sweet Herbs powder'd, with a little 

Sage shred small, and the Brains cut in pieces, and dip'd in thick Batter; then cover the Head with 

some bits of Butter, and pour in the Pan some White-Wine and Water, with as much Gravey, and 

cover it close. Then bake it in a quick Oven, and when you serve it, pour on some strong Gravey, 

and garnish with Lemon sliced, red Beet-Root pickled and sliced, and some fry'd Oysters, and fry'd 

Bread.    To make Spirit of _Lilley_ of the _Valley._ From _Norway._ N.B. This serves in the room

Stalks; then put a Quarter of a Pint of them into a Quart of Brandy, and so in proportion, to infuse 

six or eight Days; then distil it in a cold Still, marking the Bottles, as they are drawn off, which is 

first, second and third, _&c_. When you have distill'd them, take the first, and so on to the third or 

fourth, and mix them together, till you have as strong as you desire; and then bottle them, and cork 

them well, putting a lump of Loaf-Sugar into each Bottle.    Things to be provided, when any great 

Family is going into the Country, for a Summer. From Mr. _R. S._

works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a 

library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced 

and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are 

confirmed as not the Country, many of these Things may be forgot, and it is sometimes the Case, 

that one must send a Mile or two for what is wanted of them.     _I am Yours,_     R. S.     To salt a 

_Ham_ in imitation of _Westphalia,_ &c.  Take an Ham of young Pork, and sprinkle it with Salt for 

one Day, that the Blood may come out; then wipe it dry, and rub it with the following Mixture.  Take 

a Pound of brown Sugar, a quarter of a Pound of Salt-Petre, half a Pint of Bay-Salt, and three 

Pints of common Salt. Mix all these together, and stir them in an Iron Pan, over the Fire, till they 

are pretty
