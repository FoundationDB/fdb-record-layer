it may be we shall be delayed to look after them."  Forgetting her effort t=
o enter the little house,=20

Sonya at this instant moved away from Dr. Raymond to rejoin the other Red C=
ross nurses.  In=20

French fashion some of the old peasants were kissing the hands of their all=
ies. Miss Blackstone=20

and a physician had already unwound a dirty bandage from the arm of an Amer=
ican soldier and=20

were examining his wound. Sonya had no desire to be left out of the little =
crowd of French and=20

American friends.  Within fifteen minutes, however, she had again returned =
to the little house. This=20

time she was accompanied by an old French peasant woman to whom she had exp=
lained the=20

situation, inquiring if the farmhouse was in truth uninhabited.  At present=
 it was the French woman=20

who hammered, not gently but with the utmost firmness upon the closed door.=
  "It may not be=20

possible, madame, that we enter in at the front door," she explained. "It i=
s my impression that la=20

petite Louisa has never once unfastened this door since she opened it to th=
e German soldiers who=20

afterwards took away her mother and older sister. She has been here ever si=
nce all alone, as her=20

father and brother were of course with the army. La petite Louisa has since=
 that time been distrait,=20

not you understand exactly in her right senses, but harmless. It is not tha=
t her French neighbors=20

have neglected her. I have myself tried to take her home to be with me, but=
 always she comes=20

back to the little grey house."  The old peasant shrugged her shoulders, as=
 she continued banging=20

on the door and talking at the same time.  "There have been so many things =
to endure. One more=20

forsaken, half starved child! What would you do? Her family was not well kn=
own in our village; they=20

had moved here from Paris a short time before the war and were said to have=
 been wealthy=20

people who had fallen into misfortune. So after a time, it may not seem kin=
d, but life has been too=20

hard some of the days even for kindness, so finally we left the little girl=
 alone. Neighbors have=20

given her food when there was food to give. Even a few of the enemy soldier=
s have sometimes=20

tried to make friends and persuade her to eat, but always she would rush aw=
ay from them with the=20

great fear."  Not altogether sure of what the old French peasant was trying=
 to make plain to her,=20

yet convinced enough of the tragedy of the story, Sonya laid her hand on th=
e old woman's arm.=20

"Don't you think we had best not frighten the little girl then by trying to=
 enter her house. Some one=20

else in the village I feel sure will offer us hospitality. And yet somethin=
g should be done for=20

heard footsteps drawing near the closed door. The next moment the door part=

disclosing the most pathetic child's figure she had ever seen.  The little =
girl was perhaps twelve=20

years old and did not look like the usual French child, for though her hair=
 was coal black, her eyes=20

were a violet blue, fringed by the blackest lashes, her skin almost an unea=
