n on me, and I can't fight=20

him as well as you."  "That's so," said Mike, who had rather a high idea of=
 his own prowess, and=20

felt pleased with the compliment. "I'm a match for him."  "Of course you be=
," said Jim, artfully, "and=20

he knows it."  "Of course he does," said Mike, boastfully. "I can lick him =
with one hand."  Jim had=20

serious doubts of this, but he had his reasons for concurring in Mike's est=
imate of his own powers.=20

"We'd better start now," said Jim. "I'm awful hungry."  "Come along, then."=
  They walked up Liberty=20

street, as far as Nassau. On reaching the corner they saw their unconscious=
 victim at his usual=20

place. It was rather a public place for an assault, and both boys would hav=
e hesitated had they not=20

been incited by a double motive--the desire of gain and a feeling of hostil=
ity.  They sauntered=20

along, and Mike pressed in close by Paul.  "What do you want?" asked Paul, =
not liking the vicinity.=20

"What's that to you?" demanded Mike.  "Quit crowdin' me."  "I ain't crowdin=
'. I've got as much right=20

to be here as you."  "Here's your prize packages!" exclaimed Paul, in a bus=
inesslike tone.  "Maybe=20

I'll buy one if you'll give me credit till to-morrow," said Mike.  "Your cr=
edit isn't good with me," said=20

Paul. "You must pay cash down."  "Then you won't trust me?" said Mike, pres=
sing a little closer.=20

"No, I won't," said Paul, decidedly.  "Then, take that, you spalpeen!" said=
 Mike, suddenly pulling=20

Paul's hat over his eyes.  At the same time Jim, to whom he had tipped a wi=
nk, snatched the=20

basket, which Paul held loosely in his hand, and disappeared round the corn=
er.  The attack was so=20

sudden and unexpected that Paul was at first bewildered. But he quickly rec=
overed his presence=20

of mind, and saw into the trick. He raised his hat, and darted in pursuit o=
f Mike, not knowing in=20

what direction his basket had gone.  "That's a mean trick!" he exclaimed, i=
ndignantly. "Give me=20

back my basket, you thief!"  "I ain't got no basket," said Mike, facing rou=
nd.  "Then you know=20

where it is."  "I don't know nothin' of your basket."  "You pulled my hat o=
ver my eyes on purpose to=20

steal my basket."  "No, I didn't. You insulted me, that's why I did it."  "=
Tell me where my basket is,=20

or I'll lick you," said Paul, incensed.  "I ain't nothin' to do with your b=
asket."  "Take that, then, for=20

pulling my hat over my eyes," and Paul, suiting the action to the word, dea=
lt Mike a staggering=20

blow in the face.  "I'll murder you!" shouted Mike, furiously, dashing at P=
aul with a blow which=20

might have leveled him, if he had not fended it off.  Paul was not quarrels=
ome, but he knew how to=20

fight, and he was prepared now to fight in earnest, indignant as he was at =
the robbery which=20

entailed upon him a loss he could ill sustain.  "I'll give you all you want=
," he said, resolutely, eyeing=20

Mike warily, and watching a chance to give him another blow.  The contest w=
as brief, being=20

terminated by the sudden and unwelcome arrival of a policeman.  "What's thi=
s?" he asked=20

authoritatively, surveying the combatants; Paul, with his flushed face, and=
 Mike, whose nose was=20

bleeding freely from a successful blow of his adversary.  "He pitched into =
me for nothin'," said=20

Mike, glaring at Paul, and rubbing his bloody nose on the sleeve of his rag=
ged coat.  "That isn't=20

true," said Paul, excitedly. "He came up while I was selling prize packages=
 of candy in front of the=20

post office, and pulled my hat over my eyes, while another boy grabbed my b=
asket."  "You lie!"=20

said Mike. "I don't know nothin' of your basket."  "Why did you pull his ha=
t over his eyes?" asked=20

the policeman.  "Because he insulted me."  "How did he insult you?"  "He wo=
uldn't trust me till to-

morrow."  "I don't blame him much for that," said the policeman, who was aw=
are of Mike's shady=20

reputation, having on a former occasion been under the necessity of arresti=
ng him. Even without=20

such acquaintance, Mike's general appearance would hardly have recommended =
him to Officer=20

Jones.  "I'll let you go this time," he said, "but if I catch you fighting =
again on my beat I'll march you=20



off to the station-house."  Mike was glad to escape, though he would almost=
 have been willing to=20

be arrested if Paul could have been arrested also.  The officer walked away=
, and Mike started=20

down the street.  Paul followed him.  That didn't suit Mike's ideas, as he =
was anxious to meet Jim=20

and divide the spoils with him.  "What are you follerin' me for?" he demand=
ed, angrily.  "I have my=20

reasons," said Paul.  "Then you'd better stay where you are. Your company a=
in't wanted."  "I know=20

that," said Paul, "but I'm going to follow you till I find my basket."  "Wh=
at do I know of your basket?"=20

"That's what I want to find out."  Mike saw, by Paul's resolute tone, that =
he meant what he said.=20

Desirous of shaking him of, he started on a run.    CHAPTER VI  PAUL AS AN =
ARTIST  Paul was=20

not slow in following Mike. He was a good runner, and would have had no dif=
ficulty in keeping up=20

with his enemy if the streets had been empty. But to thread his way in and =
out among the=20

numerous foot passengers that thronged the sidewalks was not so easy. He ke=
pt up pretty well,=20

however, until, in turning a street corner, he ran at full speed into a ver=
y stout gentleman, whose=20

scanty wind was quite knocked out of him by the collision. He glared in ang=
er at Paul, but could=20

not at first obtain breath enough to speak.  "I beg your pardon, sir," said=
 Paul, who, in spite of his=20

desire to overtake Mike, felt it incumbent upon him to stop and offer an ap=
ology.  "What do you=20

mean, sir," exploded the fat man, at last, "by tearing through the streets =
like a locomotive? You've=20

nearly killed me."  "I am very sorry, sir."  "You ought to be. Don't you kn=
ow better than to run at=20

such speed? You ought to be indicted as a public nuisance.  "I was trying t=
o catch a thief," said=20

Paul.  "Trying to catch a thief? How's that?" asked the stout gentleman, hi=
s indignation giving way=20

to curiosity.  "I was selling packages in front of the post office when he =
and another boy came up=20

and stole my basket."  "Indeed! What were you selling?"  "Prize packages, s=
ir."  "What was in=20

them?"  "Candy."  "Could you make much that way?"  "About a dollar a day." =
 "I'd rather have=20

given you a dollar than had you run against me with such violence. I feel i=
t yet."  "Indeed, sir, I'm=20

very sorry."  "Well, I'll forgive you, under the circumstances. What's your=
 name?"  "Paul Hoffman."=20

"Well, I hope you'll get back your basket. Some time, if you see me in the =
street, come up and let=20

me know. Would you know me again?"  "I think I should, sir."  "Well, good-m=
orning. I hope you'll=20

catch the thief."  "I thank you, sir."  They parted company, but Paul did n=
ot continue the pursuit.=20

had had plenty of time to find a refuge, and there would be no use in follo=
wing him.  So Paul went=20

home.  "You are home early, Paul," said his mother. "Surely you haven't sol=
d out by this time."=20

"No, but all my packages are gone."  "How is that?"  "They were stolen."  "=
Tell me about it."  So=20

Paul told the story.  "That Mike was awful mean," said Jimmy, indignantly. =
"I'd like to hit him."  "I=20

don't think you would hurt him much, Jimmy," said Paul, amused at his littl=
e brother's vehemence.=20

"Then I wish I was a big, strong boy," said Jimmy.  "I hope you will be, so=
me time."  "How much=20

was your loss, Paul?" asked his mother.  "There were nearly forty packages.=
 They cost me about=20

a dollar, but if I had sold them all they would have brought me in twice as=
 much. I had only sold ten=20

packages."  "Shall you make some more?"  "No, I think not," said Paul. "I'v=
e got tired of the=20

business. It's getting poorer every day. I'll go out after dinner, and see =
if I can't find something else=20

to do."  "You ain't going out now, Paul?" said Jimmy.  "No, I'll stop and s=
ee you draw a little while."=20

"That's bully. I'm going to try these oxen."  "That's a hard picture. I don=
't think you can draw it,=20

Jimmy."  "Yes, I can," said the little boy, confidently. "Just see if I don=
't."  "Jimmy has improved a=20

good deal," said his mother.  "You'll be a great artist one of these days, =
Jimmy," said Paul.  "I'm=20

going to try, Paul," said the little boy. "I like it so much."  Little Jimm=
y had indeed made surprising=20

progress in drawing. With no instruction whatever, he had succeeded in a ve=
ry close and accurate=20

imitation of the sketches in the drawing books Paul had purchased for him. =
It was a great delight to=20

the little boy to draw, and hour after hour, as his mother sat at her work,=
 he sat up to the table, and=20

worked at his drawing, scarcely speaking a word unless spoken to, so absorb=
ed was he in his=20

fascinating employment.  Paul watched him attentively.  "You'll make a bull=
y artist, Jimmy," he=20

said, at length, really surprised at his little brother's proficiency. "If =
you keep on a little longer, you'll=20

beat me."  "I wish you'd draw something, Paul," said Jimmy. "I never saw an=
y of your drawings."  "I=20

am afraid, if you saw mine, it would discourage you," said Paul. "You know,=
 I'm older and ought to=20

draw better."  His face was serious, but there was a merry twinkle of fun i=
n his eyes.  "Of course, I=20

know you draw better," said Jimmy, seriously.  "What shall I draw?" asked P=
aul.  "Try this horse,=20

Paul."  "All right!" said Paul. "But you must go away; I don't want you to =
see it till it is done."  Jimmy=20

left the table, and Paul commenced his attempt. Now, though Paul is the her=
o of my story, I am=20

bound to confess that he had not the slightest talent for drawing, though J=
immy did not know it. It=20

was only to afford his little brother amusement that he now undertook the t=
ask.  Paul worked away=20

for about five minutes.  "It's done," he said.  "So quick?" exclaimed Jimmy=
, in surprise. "How fast=20

you work!"  He drew near and inspected Paul's drawing. He had no sooner ins=
pected it than he=20

burst into a fit of laughter. Paul's drawing was a very rough one, and such=
 a horse as he had=20

drawn will never probably be seen until the race has greatly degenerated.  =
"What's the matter,=20

Jimmy?" asked Paul. "Don't you like it?"  "It's awful, Paul," said the litt=
le boy, almost choking with=20

mirth.  "I see how it is," said Paul, with feigned resentment. "You're jeal=
ous of me because you=20

can't draw as well."  "Oh, Paul, you'll kill me!" and Jimmy again burst int=
o a fit of merriment. "Can't=20

you really draw any better?"  "No, Jimmy," said Paul, joining in the laugh.=
 "I can't draw any better=20

than an old cow. You've got all the talent in the family in that line."  "B=
ut you're smart in other=20

ways, Paul," said Jimmy, who had a great admiration of Paul, notwithstandin=
g the discovery of his=20

artistic inferiority.  "I'm glad there's one that thinks so, Jimmy," said P=
aul. "I'll refer to you when I=20

want a recommendation."  Jimmy resumed his drawing, and was proud of the pr=
aises which Paul=20

freely bestowed upon him.  "I'll get you a harder drawing book when you've =
got through with=20



these," said Paul; "that is, if I don't get reduced to poverty by having my=
 stock in trade stolen=20

again."  After a while came dinner. This meal in Mrs. Hoffman's household u=
sually came at twelve=20

o'clock. It was a plain, frugal meal always, but on Sunday they usually man=
aged to have=20

something a little better, as they had been accustomed to do when Mr. Hoffm=
an was alive.  Paul=20

was soon through.  He took his hat from the bureau, and prepared to go out.=
  "I'm going out to try=20

my luck, mother," he said. "I'll see if I can't get into something I like a=
 little better than the prize-

package business."  "I hope you'll succeed, Paul."  "Better than I did in d=
rawing horses, eh,=20

Jimmy?"  "Yes, I hope so, Paul," said the little boy.  "Don't you show that=
 horse to visitors and=20

pretend it's yours, Jimmy."  "No danger, Paul."  Paul went downstairs and i=
nto the street. He had=20

no definite plan in his head, but was ready for anything that might turn up=
. He did not feel anxious,=20

for he knew there were plenty of ways in which he could earn something. He =
had never tried=20

blacking boots, but still he could do it in case of emergency. He had sold =
papers, and succeeded=20

fairly in that line, and knew he could again. He had pitted himself against=
 other boys, and the result=20

had been to give him a certain confidence in his own powers and business ab=
ilities. When he had=20

first gone into the street to try his chances there, it had been with a deg=
ree of diffidence. But=20

knocking about the streets soon gives a boy confidence, sometimes too much =
of it; and Paul had=20

learned to rely upon himself; but the influence of a good, though humble ho=
me, and a judicious=20

mother, had kept him aloof from the bad habits into which many street boys =
are led.  So Paul,=20

though his stock in trade had been stolen, and he was obliged to seek a new=
 kind of business,=20

was by no means disheartened. He walked a little way downtown, and then, cr=
ossing the City Hall=20

Park, found himself on Broadway.  A little below the Astor House he came to=
 the stand of a=20

sidewalk-merchant, who dealt in neckties. Upon an upright framework hung a =
great variety of ties=20

of different colors, most of which were sold at the uniform price of twenty=
-five cents each.  Paul=20

was acquainted with the proprietor of the stand, and, having nothing else t=
o do, determined to stop=20

and speak to him.    CHAPTER VII  A NEW BUSINESS  The proprietor of the nec=
ktie stand was a=20

slender, dark-complexioned young man of about twenty-five, or thereabouts. =
 His name was=20

George Barry. Paul had known him for over a year, and whenever he passed hi=
s stand was=20

accustomed to stop and speak with him.  "Well, George, how's business?" ask=
ed Paul.  "Fair,"=20

said Barry. "That isn't what's the matter."  "What is it, then?"  "I'm sick=
. I ought not to be out here=20

to-day."  "What's the matter with you?"  "I've caught a bad cold, and feel =
hot and feverish. I ought=20

to be at home and abed."  "Why don't you go?"  "I can't leave my business."=
  "It's better to do that=20

than to get a bad sickness."  "I suppose it is. I am afraid I am going to h=
ave a fever. One minute=20

I'm hot, another I'm cold. But I can't afford to close up my business."  "W=
hy don't you get=20

somebody to take your place?"  "I don't know anybody I could get that I cou=
ld trust. They'd sell my=20

goods, and make off with the money."  "Can you trust me?" asked Paul, who s=
aw a chance to=20

benefit himself as well as his friend.  "Yes, Paul, I could trust you, but =
I'm afraid I couldn't pay you=20

enough to make it worth while for you to stand here."  "I haven't got anyth=
ing to do just now," said=20

Paul. "I was in the prize-package business, but two fellows stole my stock =
in trade, and I'm not=20

going into it again. It's about played out. I'm your man. Just make me an o=
ffer."  "I should like to=20

have you take my place for a day or two, for I know you wouldn't cheat me."=
  "You may be sure of=20

that."  "I am sure. I know you are an honest boy, Paul. But I don't know wh=
at to offer you."  "How=20

many neckties do you sell a day?" asked Paul, in a businesslike tone.  "Abo=
ut a dozen on an=20



average."  "And how much profit do you make?"  "It's half profit."  Paul ma=
de a short calculation.=20

Twelve neckties at twenty-five cents each would bring three dollars. Half o=
f this was a dollar and a=20

half.  "I'll take your place for half profits," he said.  "That's fair," sa=
id George Barry. "I'll accept your=20

offer. Can you begin now?"  "Yes."  "Then I'll go home and go to bed. It's =
the best place for me."=20

"You'd better. I'll come round after closing up, and hand over the money." =
 "All right! You know=20

where I live?"  "I'm not sure."  "No. -- Bleecker street."  "I'll come up t=
his evening."  George Barry=20

walked away, leaving Paul in charge of his business.  He did so with perfec=
t confidence. Not every=20

boy in Paul's circumstances can be trusted, but he felt sure that Paul woul=
d do the right thing by=20

him.  I may as well say, in this connection, that George Barry had a mother=
 living. They occupied=20

two rooms in a lodging-house in Bleecker street, and lived very comfortably=
. Mrs. Barry had an=20

allowance of two hundred dollars a year from a relation. This, with what sh=
e earned by sewing,=20

and her son by his stand, supported them very comfortably, especially as th=
ey provided and=20

cooked their own food, which was, of course, much cheaper than boarding. St=
ill, the loss of the=20

young man's earnings, even for a short time, would have been felt, though t=
hey had a reserve of a=20

hundred dollars in a savings bank, from which they might draw if necessary.=
 But George did not=20

like to do this. The arrangement which he made with Paul was a satisfactory=
 one, for with half his=20

usual earnings they would still be able to keep out of debt, and not be com=
pelled to draw upon the=20

fund in the bank. Of course, something depended on Paul's success as a sale=
sman, but he would=20

not be likely to fall much below the average amount of sales. So, on the wh=
ole, George Barry went=20

home considerably relieved in mind, though his head was throbbing, and he f=
elt decidedly sick.=20

Arrived at home, his mother, who understood sickness, at once took measures=
 to relieve him.=20

"Don't mind the loss of a few days, George," she said, cheerfully; "we shal=
l be able to get along=20

very well."  "It'll only be part loss, mother," he said. "I've got Paul Hof=
fman to take my place for half=20

the profits."  "Paul Hoffman! Do I know him?"  "I don't think he has ever b=
een here but I have=20

known him for a year."  "Can you trust him?"  "Yes, I'm not at all afraid. =
He is a smart boy, and as=20

honest as he is smart. I think he will sell nearly as much as I would."  "T=
hat is an excellent=20

arrangement. You needn't feel uneasy, then."  "No, the business will go on =
right."  "I should like to=20

see your salesman."  "You'll see him to-night, mother. He's coming round th=
is evening to let me=20

know how he's got along, and hand over the money he's taken."  "You'd bette=
r be quiet now,=20

George, and go to sleep, if you can. I'll make you some warm tea. I think i=
t'll do you good."=20

Meanwhile Paul assumed charge of George Barry's business. He was sorry his =
friend was sick,=20

but he congratulated himself on getting into business so soon.  "It's more =
respectable than selling=20

prize packages," thought Paul. "I wish I had a stand of my own."  He was st=
ill a street merchant,=20

but among street merchants there are grades as well as among merchants whos=
e claim to higher=20

respectability rests upon having rent to pay. Paul felt that it was almost =
like having a shop of his=20

own. He had always looked up to George Barry as standing higher than himsel=
f in a business way,=20

and he felt that even if his earnings should not be as great, that it was a=
 step upward to have sole=20

charge of his stand, if only for a day or two.  Paul's ambition was aroused=
. It was for his interest to=20

make as large sales as possible. Besides, he thought he would like to prove=
 to George Barry that=20

he had made a good selection in appointing him his substitute.  Now, if the=
 truth must be told,=20

George Barry himself was not possessed of superior business ability. He was=
 lacking in energy=20

and push. He could sell neckties to those who asked for them, but had no pa=
rticular talent for=20



attracting trade. He would have been a fair clerk, but was never likely to =
rise above a very=20

moderate success. Paul was quite different. He was quick, enterprising, and=
 smart. He was a boy=20

likely to push his way to success unless circumstances were very much again=
st him.  "I'd like to=20

sell more than George Barry," he said to himself. "I don't know if I can, b=
ut I'm going to try."  The=20

day was half over, and probably the most profitable, so far as business was=
 concerned. Paul had=20

only four or five hours left.  "Let me see," he said to himself. "I ought t=
o sell six neckties to come=20

up to the average of half a day's sale. I wonder whether I can do it."  As =
his soliloquy ended, his=20

quick eye detected a young man glancing at his stock, and he observed that =
he paused=20

irresolutely, as if half inclined to purchase.  "Can't I sell you a necktie=
 to-day?" asked Paul,=20

promptly.  "I don't know," said the other. "What do you charge?"  "You can =
have your choice for=20

twenty-five cents. That is cheap, isn't it?"  "Yes, that's cheap. Let me lo=
ok at them."  "Here's one=20

that will suit your complexion," said Paul.  "Yes, that's a pretty one. I t=
hink I'll take it."  "You have to=20

pay twice as much in the shops," continued Paul, as he rolled it up. "You s=
ee, we have no rent to=20

pay, and so we can sell cheap. You'll save money by always buying your neck=
ties here."  "The=20

only objection to that is that I don't live in the city. I am here only for=
 a day. I live about fifty miles in=20

the country."  "Then I'll tell you what you'd better do," said Paul. "Lay i=
n half a dozen, while you are=20

about it. It'll only be a dollar and a half, and you'll save as much as tha=
t by doing it."  "I don't know=20

but you are right," said his customer, whom the suggestion impressed favora=
bly. "As you say, it's=20

only a dollar and a half, and it'll give me a good stock."  "Let me pick th=
em out for you," said Paul,=20

briskly, "unless there's something you see yourself."  "I like that one."  =
"All right. What shall be the=20

next?"  Finally, the young man selected the entire half-dozen, and deposite=
d a dollar and a half in=20

Paul's hands.  "Come and see me again," said Paul, "and if you have any fri=
ends coming to the=20

city, send them to me."  "I will," said the other.  "Tell them it's the fir=
st stand south of the Astor=20

House. Then they won't miss it."  "That's a good beginning," said Paul to h=
imself, with satisfaction.=20

"Half a day's average sales already, and I've only been here fifteen minute=
s. Let me see, what will=20

my profits be on that? Three shillings, I declare. That copying, distributi=

Paul had reason to be satisfied with himself. If he had not spoken, the you=
ng man would very=20

probably have gone on without purchasing at all, or, at any rate, remained =
content with a single=20

necktie. Paul's manner and timely word had increased his purchase sixfold. =
That is generally the=20

difference between a poor salesman and one of the first class. Anybody can =
sell to those who are=20

anxious to buy; but it takes a smart man to persuade a customer that he wan=
ts what otherwise he=20

would go without. The difference in success is generally appreciated by dea=
lers, and a superior=20

salesman is generally paid a handsome salary.  "I don't believe George Barr=
y would have sold that=20

man so many ties," thought Paul. "I hope I shall have as good luck next tim=
e."  But this, of course,=20

was not to be expected. It is not every customer who can be persuaded to bu=
y half-a-dozen ties,=20

even by the most eloquent salesman. However, in the course of an hour more,=
 Paul had sold three=20

more to single customers. Then came a man who bought two. Then there was a =
lull, and for an=20

hour Paul sold none at all. But business improved a little toward the close=
 of the afternoon, and=20

when it was time to close up, our young merchant found that he had disposed=
 of fifteen.  "My=20

share of the profits will be ninety-three cents," thought Paul, with satisf=
action. "That isn't bad for an=20

afternoon's work."    CHAPTER VIII  A STROKE OF ILL LUCK  Paul transferred =
his frame of=20

goods to a neighboring office at the end of the afternoon, the arrangement =
having been made by=20

George Barry, on first entering into business as a street merchant. This sa=
ved a good deal of=20

trouble, as otherwise he would have been compelled to carry them home every=
 night and bring=20

them back in the morning.  "Well, Paul," asked his mother, when he returned=
 to supper, "have you=20

found anything to do yet?"  "I have got employment for a few days," said Pa=
ul, "to tend a necktie=20

stand. The man that keeps it is sick."  "How much does he pay you, Paul?" a=
sked Jimmy.  "Half=20

the profits. How much do you think I have made this afternoon?"  "Forty cen=
ts."  "What do you say=20

to ninety-three cents? Just look at this," and Paul displayed his earnings.=
  "That is excellent."  "I=20

had good luck. Generally, I shan't make more in a whole day than this."  "T=
hat will be doing very=20

well."  "But I shall make more, if I can. One fellow bought six neckties of=
 me this afternoon. I wish=20

everybody would do that. Now, mother, I hope supper is most ready, for sell=
ing neckties has made=20

me hungry."  "Almost ready, Paul."  It was a humble meal, but a good one. T=
here were fresh rolls=20

and butter, tea and some cold meat. That was all; but the cloth was clean, =
and everything looked=20

neat. All did justice to the plain meal, and never thought of envying the t=
housands who, in their rich=20

uptown mansions, were sitting down at the same hour to elaborate dinners co=
sting more than their=20

entire week's board.  "Are you going out, Paul?" asked Mrs. Hoffman, notici=
ng that he took his hat.=20

"Yes, I must go and see George Barry, and carry the money I have received f=
or sales."  "Where=20

does he live?"  "In Bleecker street. I shan't be gone long."  Paul reached =
the number which had=20

been given him. It was a large, four-story house, with the appearance of a =
barracks.  "Mr. Barry,"=20

said the servant, in answer to his question--"he lives upstairs on the four=
th floor. Room on the=20

right."  Paul plodded his way upstairs, and found the room without difficul=
ty.  On knocking, the door=20

was opened by Mrs. Barry, who looked at him inquiringly.  "Does George Barr=
y live here?" asked=20

Paul.  "Yes. Are you the one he left in charge of his business?"  Paul answ=
ered in the affirmative,=20

adding, "How is he?"  "He seems quite feverish. I am afraid he is going to =
have a fever. It's=20

fortunate he came home. He was not able to attend to his business."  "Can I=
 see him?"  "Come in,"=20

said Mrs. Barry.  The room was covered with a worn carpet, but looked neat =
and comfortable.=20

There was a cheap sewing-machine in one corner, and some plain furniture. T=
here was a=20



bedroom opening out of this room, and here it was that George Barry lay upo=
n the bed.  "Is that=20

Paul Hoffman, mother?" was heard from the bedroom.  "Yes," said Paul, answe=
ring for himself.=20

"Go in, if you like," said Mrs. Barry. "My son wishes to see you.  "How do =
you feel now, George?"=20

asked Paul.  "Not very well, Paul. I didn't give up a minute too soon. I th=
ink I am going to have a=20

fever."  "That is not comfortable," said Paul. "Still, you have your mother=
 to take care of you."  "I=20

don't know how I should get along without her. Can you look after my busine=
ss as long as I am=20

sick?"  "Yes; I have nothing else to do."  "Then that is off my mind. By th=
e way, how many ties did=20

you sell this afternoon?"  "Fifteen."  "What!" demanded Barry, in surprise.=
 "You sold fifteen?"=20

"Yes."  "Why, I never sold so many as that in an afternoon."  "Didn't you?"=
 said Paul, gratified.=20

"Then you think I did well?"  "Splendidly. How did you do it?"  "You see, t=
here was a young man=20

from the country that I persuaded to buy six, as he could not get them so c=
heap at home. That was=20

my first sale, and it encouraged me."  "I didn't think you'd sell more than=
 six in the whole=20

afternoon."  "Nor did I, when I started; but I determined to do my best. I =
don't expect to do as well=20

every day."  "No, of course not. I've been in the business more than a year=
; and I know what it is.=20

Some days are very dull."  "I've got the money for you. The fifteen ties ca=
me to three dollars and=20

seventy-five cents. I keep one-fourth of this as my commission. That leaves=
 two dollars and eighty-

two cents."  "Quite correct. However, you needn't give me the money. You ma=
y need to change a=20

bill, or else lose a sale. It will do if you settle with me at the end of t=
he week."  "I see you have=20

confidence in me, George. Suppose I should take a fancy to run away with th=
e money?"  "I am not=20

afraid."  "If I do, I will give you warning a week beforehand."  After a li=
ttle more conversation, Paul=20

withdrew, thinking he might worry the sick man. He offered to come up the n=
ext evening, but=20

George Barry said, "It would be too much to expect you to come up every eve=
ning. I shall be=20

satisfied if you come up every other evening."  "Very well," said Paul. "Th=
en you may expect me=20

Saturday. I hope I shall have some good sales to report, and that I shall f=
ind you better."  Paul=20

descended to the street, and walked slowly homeward. He couldn't help wishi=
ng that the stand=20

was his own, and the entire profits his. This would double his income, and =
enable him to save up=20

money. At present this was hardly possible. His own earnings had been, and =
were likely to=20

continue, very fluctuating.  Still, they constituted the main support of th=
e family. His mother made=20

shirts for an establishment on Broadway at twenty-five cents each, which wa=
s more than some=20

establishments paid. She could hardly average more than one shirt a day, in=
 addition to her=20

household work, and in order to accomplish this, even, she was obliged to w=
ork very steadily all=20

day. Jimmy, of course, earned nothing. Not that he was too young. There wer=
e plenty of little=20

newsboys who were as small as he--perhaps smaller. I have seen boys, who di=
d not appear to be=20

more than four years old, standing at the corners, crying the news in their=
 childish treble. But Paul=20

was not willing to have Jimmy sent out into the streets to undergo the roug=
h discipline of street life.=20

He was himself of a strong, robust nature, and did not shrink from the roug=
h and tumble of life. He=20

felt sure he could make his way, and give as well as receive blows. But Jim=
my was shy and=20

retiring, of a timid, shrinking nature, who would suffer from what would on=
ly exhilarate Paul, and=20

brace him for the contest. So it was understood that Jimmy was to get an ed=
ucation, studying at=20

present at home with his mother, who had received a good education, and tha=
t Mrs. Hoffman and=20

Paul were to be the breadwinners. "I wish mother didn't have to sit so stea=
dily at her work,"=20

ctics are fallen into=20

contempt.  No word of outworks, ravelins, of mamelons, of counter-scarps, o=
f glacis, fascines;=20

none of the terms by means of which Vauban obscured his art, are even menti=
oned.  Armies fall to=20

and blow such brains as they may have out of each other=E2=80=99s heads wit=
hout so much as a salute.=20

And so of literature, your =E2=80=9Cfew first words,=E2=80=9D your =E2=80=
=9Cavant-propos,=E2=80=9D your nice approaches to the=20

reader, giving him beforehand some taste of what is to follow, have also fa=
llen into disuse.  The=20

man of genius (and in no age has self-dubbed genius called out so loud in e=
very street, and been=20

accepted at its own appraisement) stuffs you his epoch-making book full of =
the technicalities of=20

some obscure or half-forgotten trade, and rattles on at once, sans introduc=
tion, twenty knots an=20

hour, like a torpedo boat.  No preface, dedication, not even an apology _pr=
o existenti=C3=A2 ejus_=20

intervening betwixt the bewildered public and the full power of his wit.  A=
 graceless way of doing=20

things, and not comparable to the slow approach by =E2=80=9Cprefatory words=
,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ccensura,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cdedication,=E2=80=9D by=20

means of which the writers of the past had half disarmed the critic ere he =
had read a line.  I like to=20

fancy to myself the progress of a fight in days gone by, with marching, cou=
ntermarching,=20

manoeuvring, so to speak, for the weather-gauge, and then the general engag=
ement all by the=20

book of arithmetic, and squadrons going down like men upon a chessboard aft=
er nice calculation,=20

and like gentlemen.  Who, hidden in a wood, watching a nymph about to bathe=
, would care to see=20

her strip off her =E2=80=9Cduds=E2=80=9D like an umbrella-case, and bounce =
into the river like a water-rat?=E2=80=94a lawn=20

upon the grass, a scarf hung on a bush, a petticoat rocked by the wind upon=
 the sward, then the=20

shy trying of the water with the naked feet, and lastly something flashing =
in the sun which you=20

could hardly swear you had seen, so rapidly it passed into the stream, woul=
d most enchant the=20

gaze of the rapt watcher hidden behind his tree.  And so of literature, whe=
edle me by degrees,=20



your reader to your book, as did the giants of the past in graceful preface=
, dedication, or what do=20

you call it, that got the readers, so to speak, into the book before they w=
ere aware.  It seems to=20

me, a world all void of grace must needs be cruel, for cruelty and grace go=
 not together, and=20

perhaps the hearts of the pig-tailed, pipe-clayed generals of the past were=
 not more hard than are=20

the hearts of their tweed-clad descendants who now-a-days blow you a thousa=
nd savages to=20

paradise, and then sit down to lunch.  Let there be no mistake; the writer =
and the reader are sworn=20

foes.  The writer labouring for bread, or hopes of fame, from idleness, fro=
m too much energy, or=20

from that uncontrollable dance of St. Vitus in the muscles of the wrist whi=
ch prompts so many men=20

to write (the Lord knows why), works, blots, corrects, rewrites, revises, a=
nd improves; then=20

publishes, and for the most part is incontinently damned.  Then comes the r=
eader cavalierly, as=20

the train shunts at Didcot, or puffs and snorts into Carlisle, and gingerly=
 examining the book says it=20

is rubbish, and that he wonders how people who should have something else t=
o do, find time to=20

spend their lives in writing trash.  I take it that there is a modesty of m=
ind as deep implanted in the=20

soul of man as is the supergrafted post-Edenian modesty of the body; which =
latter, by the way, so=20

soon is lost, restraints of custom or convention laid aside.  Who that woul=
d strip his clothes off, and=20

walk down Piccadilly, even if the day were warm (the police all drunk or ab=
sent), without some=20

hesitation, and an announcement of his purpose, say, in the columns of the =
_Morning Post_?=20

Therefore, why strip the soul stark naked to the public gaze without some h=
esitation and due=20

interval, by means of which to make folk understand that which you write is=
 what you think you=20

feel; part of yourself, a part, moreover, which once given out can never be=
 recalled?  So of the=20

sketches in this book, most of them treat of scenes seen in that magic peri=
od, youth, when things=20

impress themselves on the imagination more sharply than in after years; and=
 the scenes too have=20

vanished; that is, the countries where they passed have all been changed, a=
nd now-a-days are full=20

of barbed-wire fences, advertisements, and desolation, the desolation born =
of imperfect progress.=20

The people, too, I treat of, for the most part have disappeared; being born=
 unfit for progress, it has=20

passed over them, and their place is occupied by worthy men who cheat to be=
tter purpose, and=20

more scientifically.  Therefore, I, writing as a man who has not only seen =
but lived with ghosts,=20

may perhaps find pardon for this preface, for who would run in heavily and =
dance a hornpipe on=20

the turf below which sleep the dead?  And if I am not pardoned for my hesit=
ation, dislike, or call it=20

what you will, to give these little sketches to the world without preamble,=
 after my fashion, I care=20

not overmuch.  In the phantasmagoria we call the world, most things and men=
 are ghosts, or at the=20

best but ghosts of ghosts, so vaporous and unsubstantial that they scarcely=
 cast a shadow on the=20

grass.  That which is most abiding with us is the recollection of the past,=
 and . . . hence this=20

The next morning Paul=20

started out after breakfast for the street stand, wondering what success he=
 was destined to meet=20

with.  About the middle of the forenoon Mrs. Hoffman prepared to go out.  "=
Do you think you can=20

stay alone for an hour or two, Jimmy?" she asked.  "Yes, mother," answered =
Jimmy, who was=20

deep in a picture which he was copying from one of the drawing-books Paul h=
ad bought him.=20

"Where are you going mother?"  "To carry back some work, Jimmy. I have got =
half-a-dozen shirts=20

done, and must return them, and ask for more."  "They ought to pay you more=
 than twenty-five=20

cents apiece, mother. How long has it taken you to make them?"  "Nearly a w=
eek."  "That is only a=20

dollar and a half for a week's work."  "I know it, Jimmy; but they can get =

Jimmy said no more, and Mrs. Hoffman, gathering up her bundle, went out.  S=
he had a little more=20

than half a mile to go. This did not require long. She entered the large do=
or, and advanced to the=20

counter behind which stood a clerk with a pen behind his ear.  "How many?" =
he said, as she laid=20

the bundle upon the counter.  "Six."  "Name?"  "Hoffman."  "Correct. I will=
 look at them."  He=20

ng from a drawer the=20

stipulated sum, paid for them.  "Can I have some more?" asked Mrs. Hoffman,=
 anxiously.  "Not to-

day. We're overstocked with goods made up. We must contract our manufacture=
."  This was=20

unexpected, and carried dismay to the heart of the poor woman. What she cou=
ld earn was very=20

little but it was important to her.  "When do you think you can give me som=
e more work?" she=20

asked.  "It may be a month or six weeks," he answered, carelessly.  A month=
 or six weeks! To=20

have her supply of work cut off for so long a time would, indeed, be a dire=
 misfortune. But there=20

was nothing to say. Mrs. Hoffman knew very well that no one in the establis=
hment cared for her=20

necessities. So, with a heavy heart, she started for home, making up her mi=
nd to look elsewhere=20

for work in the afternoon. She could not help recalling, with sorrow, the t=
ime when her husband=20

was living, and they lived in a pleasant little home, before the shadow of =
bereavement and=20

pecuniary anxiety had come to cloud their happiness. Still, she was not utt=
erly cast down. Paul=20

had proved himself a manly and a helpful boy, self-reliant and courageous, =
and, though they might=20

be pinched, she knew that as long as he was able to work they would not act=
ually suffer.=20

CHAPTER IX  A NEW PATRON  Mrs. Hoffman went out in the afternoon, and visit=
ed several large=20

establishments in the hope of obtaining work. But everywhere she was met wi=
th the stereotyped=20

reply, "Business is so dull that we are obliged to turn off some who are ac=
customed to work for us.=20

We have no room for new hands."  Finally she decided that it would be of no=
 use to make any=20

further applications, and went home, feeling considerably disheartened.  "I=
 must find something to=20

do," she said to herself. "I cannot throw upon Paul the entire burden of wh=
ole place feel eerie and=20

ghostlike as the trees creak, groan and labour, like a ship at sea, I take =
the scrap-book down.  In it=20

are many things more interesting by far to me at certain times than books o=
r papers, or than the=20

conversation of my valued friends; almost as great a consolation as is toba=
cco to a bruised mind;=20

and then I turn the pages over with delight tinged with that melancholy whi=
ch is the best part of=20

remembrance.  So amongst tags of poetry as Joaquim Miller=E2=80=99s lines =
=E2=80=9CFor those who fail,=E2=80=9D the=20

advertisement for my fox-terrier Jack, the =E2=80=9Ccondemndest little buff=
ler=E2=80=9D the Texans called him,=20

couched in the choicest of Castilian, and setting forth his attributes, col=
our and name, and offering=20

five dollars to any one who would apprehend and take him to the Callejon de=
l Espiritu Santo,=20

Mexico, curious and striking outsides of match-boxes, one entire series ill=
ustrating the =E2=80=9CPromessi=20

Sposi=E2=80=9D; of scraps, detailing news of Indian caciques long since dea=
d, a lottery-ticket of the State of=20

Louisiana, passes on =E2=80=9Cbusted=E2=80=9D railways, and the like, is th=
is same coffee-coloured card.  I cannot=20

remember that I was a great dealer at the emporium, the glories of which th=
e card sets forth,=20

except for cigarettes and =E2=80=9CRapadura=E2=80=9D; that is, raw sugar in=
 a little cake done up in maize-leaves,=20

matches, and an occasional glass of white Brazilian rum.  Still during two =
long months the place=20

stood to me in lieu of club, and in it I used to meet occasional German =E2=
=80=9CFazenderos,=E2=80=9D merchants=20

from Surucaba, and officers on the march from San Paulo to Rio Grande; and =
there I used to=20

lounge, waiting for customers to buy a =E2=80=9CCaballada=E2=80=9D of some =
hundred horses, which a friend and I=20



had brought with infinite labour from the plains of Uruguay.  Thinking upon=
 the strange and curious=20

types I used to meet, clad for the most part in loose black Turkish trouser=
s, broad-brimmed felt=20

hats kept in their place by a tasselled string beneath the chin, in real or=
 sham vicu=C3=B1a ponchos,=20

high patent-leather boots, sewn in patterns with red thread; upon the horse=
s with silver saddles=20

and reins, securely tied to posts outside the door, and on the ceaseless ra=
ttle of spurs upon the=20

bare brick floors which made a sort of obligato accompaniment to the monoto=
nous music of the=20

guitar, full twenty years fall back.  Yet still the flat-roofed town, capit=
al of the district in=20


_
But it was not easy to decide what to do. There are so few paths open to a =
woman like Mrs.=20

Hoffman. She was not strong enough to take in washing, nor, if she had been=
, would Paul, who=20

was proud for his mother, though not for himself, have consented to her doi=
ng it. She determined=20

to think it over during the evening, and make another attempt to get work o=
f some kind the next=20

day.  "I won't tell Paul till to-morrow night," she decided. "Perhaps by th=
at time I shall have found=20

something to do."  All that day, the first full day in his new business, Pa=
ul sold eighteen ties. He=20

was not as successful proportionately as the previous afternoon. Still his =
share of the profits=20

amounted to a dollar and twelve cents, and he felt quite satisfied. His sal=
es had been fifty per cent.=20

more than George Barry's average sales, and that was doing remarkably well,=
 considering that the=20

business was a new one to him.  The next morning about ten o'clock, as he s=
tood behind his=20

stand, he saw a stout gentleman approaching from the direction of the Astor=
 House. He=20

remembered him as the one with whom he had accidentally come in collision w=
hen he was in=20

pursuit of Mike Donovan. Having been invited to speak to him, he determined=
 to do so.  "Good-

morning, sir," said Paul, politely.  "Eh? Did you speak to me?" inquired th=
e stout gentleman.  "Yes,=20

sir; I bade you good-morning."  "Good-morning. I don't known as Encima de l=
a Sierra, the=20

stopping-place for the great droves of mules which from the Banda Oriental =
and Entre Rios are=20

driven to the annual fair at Surucaba; the stodgy Brazilian countrymen so d=
ifferent from the=20

Gauchos of the River Plate; the negroes at that time slaves; the curious ve=
getation, and the feeling=20

of being cut off from all the world, are fresh as yesterday.  Had but the v=
enture turned out well, no=20

doubt I had forgotten it, but to have worked for four long months driving t=
he horses all the day=20

through country quite unknown to me, sitting the most part of each night up=
on my horse on guard,=20

or riding slowly round and round the herd, eating jerked beef, and sleeping=
, often wet, upon the=20

ground, to lose my money, has fixed the whole adventure on my memory for li=
fe.  Failure alone is=20

interesting.  Successful generals with their hands scarce dry from the bloo=
d of half-armed foes;=20

financiers, politicians; those who rise, authors whose works run to a dozen=
 editions in a year: the=20

men who go to colonies with or without the indispensable half-crown and com=
e back rich, to these=20

we give our greetings in the market-place; we make them knights, marking th=
eir children with the=20

father=E2=80=99s bourgeois brand: we marvel at their fortune for a brief sp=
ace, and make them doctors of=20

civil law, exposing them during the process to be insulted by our undergrad=
uates, then they=20

?"  "Oho! you're the=20

boy, then. You nearly knocked the breath out of me."  "I am very sorry, sir=

 sick."  race.  But those=20
