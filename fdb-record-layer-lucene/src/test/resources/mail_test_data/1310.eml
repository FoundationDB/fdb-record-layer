had to construct a more progressive policy. Yet whatever might be the arguments of the critics of 

the South to prove that the enlightenment of Negroes was not a danger, it was clear after the 

Southampton insurrection in 1831 that two factors in Negro education would for some time

Meade was a native of Virginia, long noted for its large element of benevolent slaveholders who 

never lost interest in their Negroes. He was fortunate in finishing his education at Princeton, so 

productive then of leaders who fought the institution of slavery.[4] Immediately after his ordination 

in the Protestant Episcopal Church, Bishop Meade assumed the role of a reformer. He took up the
