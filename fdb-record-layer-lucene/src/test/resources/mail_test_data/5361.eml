"There he is!" laughed Tom, opening the door to disclose the eccentric gentleman  In the meantime you must bear in mind that by water more than a thousand miles separated Port Royal from Quebec.  Communication was slow and difficult.  There was no high-road, and consequently the _
valise, and a small steamer trunk belonging to Tom, as easily as though they weighed nothing, the 

trunk being under one arm.  "I guess they don't see men of his size outside of circuses," 

commented the contractor. "We can pretty nearly, though not quite match him, down in Peru 

though, Tom. Some of the Indians are big fellows."  "We'll get up a wrestling match between one 

of them and Koku," suggested Tom. "Come on!" he called to the giant, who was surrounded by a 

crowd.  Koku pushed his way through as easily as a bull might make his way through a throng of 

puppies about his heels, and as Tom, Mr. Titus and the giant were entering the hotel corridor, the 

chauffeur of the taxicab called out with a Governor was installed, who made the settlers 

understand that no harm or oppression should befall them.  When these things happened, in the 

year 1654, De la Tour was long past his prime.  After waiting a year he began to see how 

hopeless it was to expect that France would do anything to save Acadia.  He crossed the ocean, 

this time to England.  As Sir Charles de la Tour he obtained audience of the Lord Protector and 

stated his case fully and frankly.  "I am the man for that country, {101} my Lord.  For more than 

sixty years I have laboured there, and settlers and Indians know me.  With me it may prosper; 

without me it is nothing." Cromwell was a keen judge of character.  He liked De la Tour's 


_
"I say, boss, don't you think you ought to pay double rates on that chap," and he nodded in the 

direction of the giant.  "That's right!" added some one in the crowd with a laugh.  "He might have 

broken the springs."  "All right," assented Tom, good-naturedly, tossing the chauffeur a coin. "Here 

you are, have a cigar on the giant."  There was more laughter, and even Koku grinned, though it is 

doubtful if he knew what about, for he could not understand much unless Tom spoke to him in a 

sort of code they had arranged between them.  "Sorry to have hastened your departure," began 

Mr. Titus when he and Tom sat in the English Company was formed, consisting of De la Tour, 

Thomas Temple, one of Cromwell's colonels, and a Puritan minister named William Crowne, to 

take over the whole of Acadia, both the peninsula of Nova Scotia and the mainland.  The partners 

were given besides the usual trading monopoly.  Great projects were planned, and so firm was 

Temple's belief in Acadia's future that he spent his whole fortune in developing the estate.  Long 

before his death, in 1666, Charles de la Tour sold out his interests to his partners.  He divined 

further trouble, for the Restoration of Charles the Second put a new aspect on the situation.

looking out at what to him were the marvelous wonders of the New York streets.  "It didn't make 

any difference," replied the young inventor. "I was about ready to come anyhow. I just had to 

hustle a little," and he thought of how he had had to send Mary's present to her instead of taking it 

himself. As yet he was all unaware of the commotion it had caused.  "Did you get the powder 

shipment off all right?"  "Yes, and it will be there almost as soon as we. Other shipments will follow 

as we need them. My father will see to that."  "I'm glad you hit on the right kind of powder," went 

on the contractor. "I guess I didn't make any mistake in coming to you, Tom."  "Well, I hope not. Of 

course the explosive worked for peace and quiet.  But the worst he did not live to see.  A year after 

De la Tour died, King Charles put his royal hand to the disgraceful Treaty of Breda, by which all 

Acadia, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, was given back to France, and 

Temple became a ruined man.  For forty-three years did Nova Scotia remain in the possession of 

the French.  At length in 1713, by the Treaty of Utrecht, it passed to Great Britain, and in British 

possession it remains to this day.  The New Englanders never ceased to regard French Acadia 

with jealousy. There were constant quarrels about the boundary-line between it and New England, 

{102} and many deadly raids on both sides.  Among the chief characters

actual conditions, and in big service charges."  "Oh, I've no doubt it will work all right."  "What time 

do we leave here?" Tom asked.  "At two-thirty this afternoon. We have just was a French noble 

who flung off the mantle of civilisation when he arrived in Canada with the Carignan-Callires 

regiment, and, marrying a squaw, took up his residence with the Indians.  St. Castin dwelt in a 

strong fort on the Penobscot River and made himself lord and master

and have our baggage transferred to the Chicago limited. In less than a week we ought to be in 

San Francisco and aboard the steamer. I hope Mr. Damon arrives on time."  "Oh, you can 

generally depend on him," said Tom. "I telephoned him, just before I started from Shopton, and he 

said--"  "Bless my carpet slippers!" English of Maine and Massachusetts.  During this long period, 

while Frontenac was ruling far away in Quebec, the population of Acadia slowly increased. 

Settlement was made at Chignecto and in the district called the Basin of Minas.  It was the 

descendants of these settlers whose opposition to British rule caused them
