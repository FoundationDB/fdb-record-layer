or heard tell of any knight who could compare with you in all admirable qua=
lities." He had Bayard's=20

body embalmed, and returned it to his friends, after having solemn service =
for him two days; and=20

the dead hero was carried home to Grenoble. Half a league from the city the=
 bier was met by all=20

the dignitaries of the place. He was buried in the convent of Minims, and F=
rance mourned publicly=20

for him for a month. Of all the vast sums he had obtained from his prisoner=
s by way of ransom he=20

left none behind, having dowered over one hundred orphan maidens, and succo=

watched some small children at play--               At play--     As he wat=
ched some small children at=20

play.    He pondered awhile, and a hungering smile     Revealed the extent =
of his jaw;   He was=20

Like a saw--     And his teeth were arranged like a saw.    He used every w=
ile their hearts to=20

beguile,     As toward them he stealthily stole;   He balanced each scale, =
and waggled his tail,=20

Then gobbled those children up whole--               Up whole--     Then go=
bbled those children up=20

whole.    And such is the style of this old crocodile,     He sheds bitter =
tears o'er his prey;   He was=20

The day--     And he wept all the rest of the day.     A FRESH WATER AQUARI=
UM.  BY A. W.=20

ROBERTS.   Many fresh-water plants have a tendency to grow above the surfac=
e. When this=20

takes place, the leaves become so different in shape that they can hardly b=
e recognized as=20

belonging to the same plant. Therefore care must be taken to keep all plant=
s submerged that are=20

intended to supply air for the fish.  [Illustration: MERMAID-WEED.]  One of=
 the most common=20

plants is the mermaid-weed (_Proserpinaca_). I have drawn it submerged and =
out of water, to=20

show the change in the leaf. It grows along the margins of ponds that parti=
ally dry up in summer.=20

[Illustration: WATER-THYME.]  Water-thyme (_Anacharis canadensus_) grows in=
 slow-flowing=20

streams. It requires coaxing to establish it in an aquarium, but when once =
rooted, is apt to grow=20

too fast, requiring thinning out. Heap plenty of gravel on the root ends. D=
o not tie the bunch with=20

string, as it will cause it to decay.  [Illustration: NITELLA.]  _Nitella f=
lexis_ is almost a rootless=20

plant, and will grow without any care. It is found growing in shady parts o=
f cool ponds, streams,=20

and lakes.  [Illustration: FONTINALIS.]  _Fontinalis antipyretica_ grows in=
 springs and cool, shady=20

ponds. It resembles a very fine and long moss. In color it is of a beautifu=
l light green. I have often=20

stored up quantities of this plant during summer (it becoming perfectly dry=
), that I might have it for=20

winter use, and when placed in an aquarium it started out as fresh as ever.=
  [Illustration: DUCK-

WEED.]  Duck-weed, or duck's-meat, is a small floating plant, covering the =
surfaces of ponds and=20

lakes in shady places. It is one of the best surface plants for producing s=
hade, or for cutting off=20

light that enters from the top of the water. Its thousands of rootlets affo=
rd hiding-places for=20

numerous small aquatic animals, such as the hydra, crimson water-spider, an=
d the brick-maker.  A=20

small stone should be tied to each bunch of plants, to anchor them till the=
y take root.  After your=20

aquarium has been in operation a few days, a green coating will begin to fo=
rm on the glass. This is=20

a minute plant that is developed by the action of light. It can be removed =
by means of a swab. In=20

all other parts of your aquarium allow it to grow, as it is the favorite fo=
od of gold-fish and snails.=20



[Illustration: SNAILS.]  I have given drawings of the two best kinds of sna=
ils. One is shown with its=20

broad foot expanded, by which it moves along the surface of the water, or o=
n the glass when=20

eating the green coating spoken of. Snails also eat decaying their faith an=
d turn Mohammedans=20

are ever watched amongst the Arab race. But in his darkest hour fate smiled=
 upon him, and the=20

head chief wanting an agent in the islands sent him to Lanzarote, and in th=
e little town of Arrecife it=20

seemed to him that he had found a resting-place at last. Once more he dress=
ed himself in=20

European clothes, he handled goods, saw now and then a Spanish newspaper a =
fortnight old;=20

talked much of politics, lounged in the Alameda, and was the subject of muc=
h curiosity amongst=20

the simple dwellers in the little town.  Some said he had denied his God am=
ongst the heathen;=20

others again that he suffered much for conscience=E2=80=99 sake; whilst he =
attended mass occasionally,=20

going with a sense of doing something wrong, and feeling more enjoyment in =
the service than in=20

the days of his belief.  His wife dressed in the Spanish fashion, wore a ma=
ntilla, sometimes indeed=20

a hat, and looked not much unlike an island woman, and was believed by all =
to have thrown off the=20

errors of her faith and come into the fold.  But notwithstanding all the am=
enities of the island life,=20

the unlimited opportunities for endless talk (so dear to Syrians), the half=
-malignant pleasure he=20

experienced in dressing up his wife in Christian guise, sending for monstro=
us hats bedecked with=20

paroquets from Cadiz, and gowns of the impossible shades of apple-green and=
 yellow which in=20

those days were sent from Paris to Spain and to her colonies, he yet was du=
ll.  And curiously=20

enough, now that he was a double renegade his youthful dreams haunted him o=
nce again.  He=20

saw himself (in his mind=E2=80=99s eye) mounted upon his horse, flying acro=
ss the sands, and stealthily=20

and half ashamed he used to dress himself in the Arab clothes and sit for h=
ours studying the=20

Koran, not that he believed its teachings, but that the phraseology enchant=
ed him, as it has=20

always, both in the present and the past, bewitched all Arabs, and perhaps =
in his case it spoke to=20

him of the illusory content which in the desert life he sought, but had not=
 found.  He read the=20

=E2=80=9CTarik-es-Sudan,=E2=80=9D and learned that Allah marks even the liv=
es of locusts, and that a single pearl=20

does not remain on earth by him unweighed.  The Djana of Essoyuti, El Ibtih=
aj, and the scarce=20

=E2=80=9CChoice of Marvels=E2=80=9D written in far Mossul by the learned Ab=
u Abdallah ibn Abderrahim (he of=20

Granada in the Andalos), he read; and as he read his love renewed itself fo=
r the old race whose=20

blood ran in his veins.  He read and dreamed, and twice a renegade in pract=
ice, yet remained a=20

true believer in the aspirations of his youth.  He sailed in schooners, run=
ning from island port to=20

island port down the trade winds; landed at little towns, and hardly marked=
 the people in the rocky=20

streets, Spanish in language, and in type quite Guanche, and but a step mor=
e civilized than the=20

wild tribesmen from the coast that he had left.  Then thinking maybe of his=
 sojourn in London, and=20

its music-halls, frequented uninterestedly the house of Rita, Rita la Jerez=
ana; sat in the courtyard=20

under the fig-tree with its trunk coated with white-wash, and listened to t=
he =E2=80=9CCante Hondo,=E2=80=9D saw=20

the girls dance Sevillanas; and drinking zarzaparilla syrup, learned that o=
f all the countries in the=20

world Spain is the richest, for there even the =E2=80=9Cwomen of the life=
=E2=80=9D cast their accounts in ounces.=20

Then growing weary of their chatter and their tales of woe, each one of the=
m being, according to=20

herself, fallen from some high estate, he wandered to the convent of the Fr=
anciscan friars.  They=20

saw a convert in him, and put out all their theologic powers; displayed, as=
 they know how, the=20

human aspect of their faith, keeping the dogma out of sight; for well they =
knew, in vain the net is=20

spread in the sight of any man, if the fires of hell are to be clearly seen=
.  Long hours Mohanna=20



talked with them, enjoying argument for its own sake after the Scottish and=
 the Eastern way; the=20

friars were mystified at the small progress that they made, but said the re=
negade spoke =E2=80=9Cas he had=20

a nest of nightingales all singing in his mouth.=E2=80=9D  And all the time=
 his wife, an Arab of the Arabs,=20

sighed for the desert, in her Spanish clothes.  The =E2=80=9CVelo de toalla=
=E2=80=9D and the high-heeled shoes, the=20

pomps and miseries of stays, and all the circumstance and starch of Europea=
n dress, did not=20

console her for the loss of the black tents, the familiar camels kneeling i=
n the=20


_
For keeping the water very clear, introduce a small-sized fresh-water musse=
l. Give him at least=20

two inches of sand, in depth, in a corner of the tank, to burrow in, but wa=
tch him well, for if he dies=20

without your knowledge your aquarium will be ruined.  [Illustration: CADDIS=
-WORMS.]  In the=20

illustration are figured three kinds of caddis-worms. These worms are usefu=
l for consuming=20

decaying animal matter. When a "cad" has grown too large for his house, he =
makes a little case of=20

silk, which he covers at each end with pieces of leaves, wood, or straw, bi=
ting them to the right=20

length; some fasten on small bits of stone and shells. However rough the ou=
tsides of their houses=20

may be, the insides are smooth, and lined with silk. When he changes into a=
 chrysalis, he crawls=20

up a plant, and closes up both ends of his house with a strong net-work of =
silk, which allows the=20

water to pass through, but prevents the entrance of enemies. As he has take=
n care to place=20

himself near the surface of the water, he easily escapes when he comes fort=
h a four-winged insect=20

resembling a small moth.  [Illustration: APPLE-SMELLERS.]  Apple-smellers, =
or merry-go-rounds,=20

are very interesting. They are of an intense shining black in color, and ge=
nerally school together,=20

moving in circles, with great rapidity, on the surface of the water. They a=
re called apple-smellers=20

on account of the strong odor they possess, resembling that of apples or qu=
inces, and merry-go-

rounds on account of their merry circling motions around one another. Young=
 apple-smellers live=20

on the bottoms of ponds, and look like centipedes. When the time comes for =
them to change into=20

real apple-smellers, they climb up a plant, and make small bags of gray pap=
er, into which they=20

fasten themselves till they get their swimming legs and shining black new c=
lothes, after which they=20

burst open the paper bags, and swim off to join their friends gliding so me=
rrily on the surface of the=20

pond. When an apple-smeller dives to the bottom of a pond to take a rest or=
 to feed, he attaches a=20

globule of air to his tail (see cut); this he breathes while under water.  =
[Illustration:=20

STICKLEBACKS.]  The nine and the three spined sticklebacks are, without dou=
bt, the most=20

wonderful fish for their size that are common to our waters. They will live=
 well in either fresh or salt=20

water aquaria, building nests and raising their young under all discouragem=
ents. The male builds=20

the nest for the female to lay her eggs in. The nest is composed of plants =
cemented together with=20

a glue provided by the male, who also carries sand and small stones to the =
nest in his mouth, with=20

which he anchors it. During the breeding season the male assumes the most b=
rilliant hues of blue,=20

orange, and green; previous to this season he is of a dull silvery color. W=
hen an enemy=20

approaches the nest, be he large or small, he will attack him, inflicting w=
ounds with his sharp=20

spines. Nor will he allow the mother of the young sticklebacks to come near=
, as she is so fond of=20

her babies that she often forgets herself and eats them up. When the young =
"tittlebacks," as they=20

are often called, swim too far from the nest, the male takes them in his mo=
uth and brings them=20

back, throwing them out with such force that they make goats skipping about=
 the =E2=80=9Csudra=E2=80=9D bushes;=20

and the church bells made her but long more keenly for the call to prayers,=
 rising at evening from=20

the straw-thatched mosque.  Her children, left with the tribe, called to he=
r from the desert, and she=20

too found neither resting-place nor rest in the quiet island life.  At last=
 Maron Mohanna turned=20

again to trade, and entered into partnership with one Benito Florez; bought=
 a schooner, and came=20

and went between the islands and the coast.  All things went well with him,=
 and in the little island=20

town =E2=80=9Cel renegado=E2=80=9D rose to be quite a prosperous citizen, t=
ill on a day he and his partner quarrelled=20

and went to law.  The law in every country favours a man born in the land a=
gainst a foreigner; and=20

the partnership broke up, leaving Mohanna almost penniless.  Whether one of=
 those sudden furies=20



which possess the Arabs, turning them in a moment and without warning from =
sedate well-

mannered men to raving maniacs frothing at the mouth, came over him, he nev=
er told; but what is=20

certain is that, having failed to slay his partner, he with his wife went o=
ff by night to where his=20

schooner lay, and instantly induced his men to put to sea, and sailed towar=
ds the coast.  Mohanna=20

drew a perhaps judicious veil of mystery over what happened on his arrival =
at the inlet where his=20

wife=E2=80=99s tribe happened to be encamped.  One of the islanders either =
objecting to the looting of the=20

schooner upon principle, or perhaps because his share of loot was insuffici=
ent, got himself killed;=20

but what is a =E2=80=9CCharuta=E2=80=9D more or less, except perhaps to his=
 wife and family in Arrecife or in some=20

little dusty town in Pico or Gomera?  Those who assented or were too fright=
ened to protest found=20

themselves unmolested, and at liberty to take the schooner back.  Maron Moh=
anna and his wife,=20

taking the boat rowed by some Arabs, made for the shore, and what ensued he=
 subsequently=20

related to a friend.  =E2=80=9CWhen we get near the shore my wife she throw=
 her hat.=E2=80=9D  One sees the=20

hideous Cadiz hat floating upon the surf, draggled and miserable, and its b=
unch of artificial fruit, of=20

flowers or feathers, bobbing about upon the backwash of the waves.  =E2=80=
=9CShe throw her boots, and=20

then she take off all her clothes I got from Seville, cost me more than a h=
undred =E2=80=98real=E2=80=99; she throw=20

her parasol, and it float in the water like a buoy, and make me mad.  I pay=
 more than ten real for it.=20

After all things was gone she wrap herself in Arab sheet and step ashore ju=
st like an Arab girl, and=20

all the clothes I brought from Cadiz, cost more than a hundred real, all wa=
s lost.=E2=80=9D  What happened=20

after their landing is matter of uncertainty. Whether Mohanna found his chi=
ldren growing up semi-

savages, whether his wife having thus sacrificed to the Graces, and made a =
holocaust of all her=20

Cadiz clothes, regretted them, and sitting by the beach fished for them sad=
ly with a cane, no man=20

can tell.  Years passed away, and a certain English consul in Morocco trave=
lling to the Court=20

stopped at a little town.  Rivers had risen, tribes had cut the road, our L=
ord the Sultan with his=20

camp was on a journey and had eaten up the food upon the usual road, or som=
e one or another of=20

the incidents of flood or field which render travel in Morocco interesting =
had=20


_
Sticklebacks are the smallest known fish when first hatched out of the egg,=
 being nearly invisible.=20

[Illustration: DRAGON-FLY.]  Here is the dragon-fly, as he looks before he =
gets his wings. He lives=20

on the bottoms of ponds when he is young; but at a certain age he ascends t=
o the surface, and=20

crawling out of his old clothes, comes forth an unmistakable darning-needle=
. When he lived under=20

the water he had very large and long jaws, folded up on the under side of h=
is head. If a fish came=20

within reach, he would dart out this curious trunk, and seizing it, convey =
it to his mouth. He also=20

has the power of taking in and squirting out water from his tail; this acti=
on forms a current, which=20

draws small insects within his reach. The taking in of the water is also hi=
s method of breathing,=20

and the ejecting of it with force propels him through the water.  [Illustra=
tion: BOAT-FLIES.]  Water-

boatmen, or boat-flies, are so named from their resemblance to tiny boats w=
ith oars. As they have=20

to swim on their backs, they are provided with large and very observing eye=
s. When they breathe=20

they come to the surface, and by a quick diving motion, and the assistance =
of numerous stout=20

hairs on the hind parts of their bodies, they entangle a mass of air, which=
, as they descend,=20

spreads, giving their bodies a bright silvery color.  It is best to keep th=
ese aquatic insects by=20

themselves, as they are all voracious feeders, and fierce in their habits. =
They are not so beautiful=20

in form, color, and motions as fish, but possess a much greater interest as=
 they pass through their=20

many transformations. As most of them can fly, the aquarium should be provi=
ded with a close-

fitting frame covered with mosquito netting.  [Illustration: CRIMSON-SPOTTE=
D NEWT.]  The=20

crimson-spotted newt is one of the most inoffensive of all animals for the =
aquarium, and is=20

valuable from the fact that he does not breathe water, but rises to the sur=
face to breathe. Every=20

The town lay off the beaten track close to the territory of a half-wild tri=
be.  Therefore upon arrival at=20

the place the consul found himself received with scowling looks; no one pro=
ceeded to hostilities,=20

but he remained within his tent, unvisited but by a soldier sent from the G=
overnor to ask whether=20

the Kaffir, son of a Kaffir, wished for anything. People sat staring at him=
, motionless except their=20

eyes; children holding each other=E2=80=99s hands stood at a safe distance =
from his tent, and stared for=20

hours at him, and he remarked the place where he was asked to camp was near=
 a mound which=20

from time immemorial seemed to have been the common dunghill of the town.  =
The night passed=20

miserably, the guards sent by the Governor shouting aloud at intervals to s=
how their vigilance,=20

banished all chance of sleep.  Cursing the place, at break of day the consu=
l struck his camp,=20

mounted his horse, and started, leaving the sullen little town all wrapped =
in sleep.  But as he=20

jogged along disconsolately behind his mules, passing an angle of the =E2=
=80=9CKasbah=E2=80=9D wall, a figure,=20

rising as it seemed out of the dunghill=E2=80=99s depths, advanced and stoo=
d before him in the middle of=20

the way.  Its hair was long and matted and its beard ropy and grizzled, and=
 for sole covering it had=20

a sack tied round its waist with a string of camel=E2=80=99s hair; and as t=
he consul feeling in his purse was=20

just about, in the English fashion, to bestow his alms to rid himself of tr=
ouble, it addressed him in=20

his native tongue.  =E2=80=9CGood-morning, consul, how goes the world with =
you?  You=E2=80=99re the first Christian=20

I have seen for years.  My name was once Mohanna, now I am Sidi bu Zibbala,=

ore brilliant than ever.=20

[Illustration: TADPOLE.]  An aquarium without tadpoles, from which to obtai=
n a supply of small=20

frogs, is not much of an aquarium; and as they are also surface breathers, =
you can use them=20

freely.  The rock-fish is a very safe fish for the aquarium, as it does not=
 breathe the water, but rises=20

to the surface, and stores away a supply of air, with which it descends to =
the bottom, remaining for=20

half an hour before it rises for a new supply.  All fresh-water fish (excep=
ting the trout family) can be=20

kept in a fresh-water aquarium. Select the very smallest specimens; have al=
l of an equal size, to=20

prevent their quarrelling; feed on shreds of raw beef, or earth-worms that =
have been freed of all=20

earthy matter by placing them in damp moss or grass overnight. _Look out fo=
