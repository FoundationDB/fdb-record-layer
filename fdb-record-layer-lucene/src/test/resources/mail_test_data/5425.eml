 fact.]     CHAPTER VII.  DEADWOOD DICK ON THE ROAD.   Rumbling noisily thr=
ough the black canyon road to Deadwood, at an hour long past midnight, came=
 the stage from Cheyenne, loaded down with passengers, and full five hours =
late, on account of a broken shaft, which had to be replaced on the road. T=
here were six plunging, snarling horses attached, whom the veteran Jehu on =
the box, managed with the skill of a circusman, and but Edward did not succ=
eed in drawing out the advice he hoped for.  "At least," reasoned Edward, "=
he knew of my intention; and if he considered it a violation of confidence =
he would have said as much."  Construing the financier's silence to mean at=
 least not a prohibition, Edward went to his Sunday-school teacher, who was=
 a member of a Wall Street brokerage firm, laid the facts before him, and a=
sked him if he would buy for him some Western Union _
that we still hold possession above any one else."  "True enuff. Ye war fir=
st ter diskiver this place=20

ye orter hev yer say about it."  "Well, then, perhaps we can come to a barg=
ain. You can state your=20

prices for locating and opening up this mine, and we will consider."  "Wal,=
 let me see. Ef the mine=20

proves to be ekal ter the one thet I located on Spring creek, I'll take in =
a third fer my share uv the=20

divys. Ef 'tain't good's I expect, I'll take a quarter."  Redburn turned to=
 Anita.  "From what little=20

experience I have had, I think it is a fair offer. What is your view of the=
 matter and do you believe=20

your brother will be satisfied?"  "Oh! yes, sir. It will surprise and pleas=
e him, to return and find his=20

Paradise has been turned into a gold-mine."  "All right; then, we will go a=
head and get things to=20

shape. We will have to get tools, though, before we can accomplish much of =
anything."  "My=20

brother has a miner's outfit here," said Anita. "That will save you a trip =
to Deadwood, for the=20

present."  And so it was all satisfactorily arranged. During the remainder =
of the day the old=20

"General" and Redburn wandered about through the flower-meadows of the pock=
et, here and=20

there examining a little soil now chipping rock among the rugged foothills,=
 then "feeling" in the bed=20

of the creek. But, not a sign of anything like gold was to be found, and wh=
en night called them to=20

shelter, Redburn was pretty thoroughly convinced that Nix was an enormous "=
sell," and that he=20

could put all the gold they would find in his eye. The "General," that they=
 decided to sell out their=20

theatre-programme interests and devote themselves to the magazine and its r=
apidly increasing=20

circulation.  All of Edward's editorial work had naturally to be done outsi=
de of his business hours,=20

in other words, in the evenings and on Sundays; and the young editor found =
himself fully occupied.=20

He now revived the old idea of selecting a subject and having ten or twenty=
 writers express their=20

views on it.  It was the old symposium idea, but it had not been presented =
in American journalism=20

for a number of years. He conceived the topic "Should America Have a Westmi=
nster Abbey?" and=20

induced some twenty of the foremost men and women of the day to discuss it.=
  When the=20

discussion was presented in the magazine, the form being new and the theme =
novel, Edward was=20

careful to send advance sheets to the newspapers, which treated it at lengt=
h in reviews and=20

editorials, with marked effect upon the circulation of the magazine.  All t=
his time, while Edward Bok=20

was an editor in his evenings he was, during the day, a stenographer and cl=
erk of the Western=20

Union Telegraph Company.  The two occupations were hardly compatible, but e=
ach meant a=20

source of revenue to the boy, and he felt he must hold on to both.  After h=
is father passed away,=20

the position of the boy's desk--next to the empty desk of his father--was a=
 cause of constant=20

depression to him.  This was understood by the attorney for the company, Mr=
. Clarence Cary, who=20

sought the head of Edward's department, with the result that Edward was=20


_
former discoveries and exploits.  Anita prepared an evening meal that was b=
oth tempting and=20

sumptuous, and all satisfied their appetites after which Harry took down th=
e guitar, suspended=20

from the wall, tuned it up, and sung in a clear mellow voice a number of ba=
llads, to which the=20

"General," much to the surprise of both Redburn and Anita, lent a rich deep=
 bass--a voice of=20

superior culture.  The closing piece was a weird melody--the lament of a he=
art that was broken,=20

love-blasted--and was rendered in a style worthy of a professional vocalist=
. The last mournful=20

strains filled the cabin just as the last lingering rays of sunlight disapp=
eared from the mountain top,=20

and shadows came creeping down the rugged walls of rock to concentrate in t=
he Flower Pocket,=20

as Anita had named her valley home. Redburn rose from his seat at the windo=
w, and reached the=20

instrument to its accustomed shelf, darting a glance toward sad Anita, a mo=
ment later. To his=20

surprise he perceived that her head was bowed upon her arm that lay along t=
he window-ledge--

that she was weeping, softly, to herself.  Acting the gentlemanly part, the=
 young miner private=20

stenographer.  Edward had been much attracted to Mr. Cary, and the attorney=
 believed in the boy,=20

and decided to show his interest by pushing him along.  He had heard of the=
 dual role which=20

Edward was playing; he bought a copy of the magazine, and was interested.  =
Edward now worked=20

with new zest for his employer and friend; while in every free moment he re=
ad law, feeling that, as=20

almost all his forbears had been lawyers, he might perhaps be destined for =
the bar.  This=20

acquaintance with the fundamental basis of law, cursory as it was, became l=
ike a gospel to=20

Edward Bok.  In later years, he was taught its value by repeated experience=
 in his contact with=20

corporate laws, contracts, property leases, and other matters; and he deter=
mined that, whatever=20

the direction of activity taken by his sons, each should spend at least a y=
ear in the study of law.=20

The control of the Western Union Telegraph Company had now passed into the =
hands of Jay=20

Gould and his companions, and in the many legal matters arising therefrom, =
Edward saw much, in=20

his office, of "the little wizard of Wall Street."  One day, the financier =
had to dictate a=20


_
follow him, and they both retired to the outside of the cabin to lounge on =
the grass and smoke, and=20

thus Anita was left alone with her grief and such troubles as were the caus=
es thereof.  Certain it=20

was that she had a secret, but what it was Redburn could not guess.  About =
ten o'clock he and Nix=20

re-entered the cabin and went to bed in a room allotted to them, off from t=
he little parlor. Both went=20

to sleep at once, and it was well along toward morning when contract, and, =
coming into Mr. Cary's=20

office, decided to dictate it then and there.  An hour afterward Edward del=
ivered the copy of the=20

contract to Mr. Gould, and the financier was so struck by its accuracy and =
by the legibility of the=20

handwriting that afterward he almost daily "happened in" to dictate to Mr. =
Cary's stenographer.=20

Mr. Gould's private stenographer was in his own office in lower Broadway; b=
ut on his way down-

town in the morning Mr. Gould=20


_
by being rudely shaken by "General" Nix, who was up and dressed, and held a=
 torch in his hand.=20

"Come! come!" he said in a husky whisper, and a glance convinced Harry that=
 he was still asleep,=20

although his eyes were wide open and staring.  Without a word the young man=
 leaped from bed,=20

donned his garments, and the old man then led the way out of the cabin.  In=
 passing through the=20

kitchen, Redburn Western Union Building, at 195 Broadway; and the habit res=
ulted in the=20

installation of a private office there.  He borrowed Edward to do his steno=
graphy.  The boy found=20

himself taking not only letters from Mr. Gould's dictation, but, what inter=
ested him particularly, the=20

financier's orders to buy and sell stock.  Edward watched the effects on th=
e stock-market of these=20

little notes which he wrote=20


_
waiting.  "Come!" he said, seizing a hatchet and stake, "we are about to di=
scover the gold-mine,=20

and our fortunes;" with a merry laugh.  Then both followed in the wake of t=
he sleep walker, and=20

were led to near the center of the valley, which was but a few steps in the=
 rear of the cabin. Here=20

was a bed of sand washed there from an overflow of the stream, and at this =
the "General" pointed,=20

as he came to a halt.  "There! _there_ is the gold--millions of it deep dow=
n--twenty or thirty feet--in=20

sand--easy to get! dig! DIG! DIG!"  Redburn marked the spot by driving the =
stake in the ground.  It=20

now only remained to dig in the soil to verify the truth of the old man's G=
ould's brokers.  Naturally,=20

the results enthralled the boy, and he told Mr. Cary about his discoveries.=
  This, in turn, interested=20

Mr. Cary; Mr. Gould's dictations were frequently given in Mr. Cary's own of=
fice, where, as his desk=20

was not ten feet from that of his stenographer, the attorney heard them, an=
d began to buy and sell=20

according to the magnate's decisions.  Edward had now become tremendously i=
nterested in the=20

stock game which he saw constantly played by the great financier; and havin=
g a little money saved=20

up, he concluded that he would follow in the wake of Mr. Gould's orders.  O=
ne day, he naively=20

mentioned his desire to Mr. Gould, when the financier=20
