the few hours daily during which the steamer from Naples visited Capri, wit=
h promenade deck=20

filled with tourists, the little island was wonderfully quiet, and by keepi=
ng away from the Marina=20

Grande or the highroads it was possible to avoid other holiday-makers. If t=
hey were not on the sea=20

"the clan," as the whole party liked to call themselves, generally went up =
the hills to escape=20

civilization. The natives had begun to know them, and though they might be =
offered oranges, figs,=20

or dates by street vendors they were not continually pestered to take carri=
ages, engage guides or=20

donkeys, or buy picture post-cards or long strings of coral. Irene loved oc=
casional excursions into=20

the white town on the rock. The strict rules and convent seclusion of the V=
illa Camellia had given=20

her no opportunity of sampling shops at Fossato, so, except for her half-te=
rm holiday at Naples,=20

this was her first experience of marketing in Italy. The unfamiliar money a=
nd measures were of=20

course confusing, but the quaint little cakes, the lollipops wrapped in fri=
nged tissue paper of gay=20

colors, the sugar hearts, the plaited baskets, the inlaid boxes, the mosaic=
 brooches, the beads,=20

and the hundred and one cheap trifles spread forth on stalls or in windows =
fascinated her, and=20

drew many lire from her purse. She only knew a few words of colloquial Ital=
ian, but she used these=20

to the best advantage, and made up the rest with nods and smiles, a languag=
e well understood by=20

the kindly people of Capri, to whom a gesture is as eloquent as a whole sen=
tence. Vincent, whose=20

talents ran more towards prowess at football than a gift for languages, wou=
ld often escort his=20

sister, and conducted his bargaining by pointing to what he wanted and coun=
ting the price in lire=20

on his five fingers, an operation that caused fits of amusement to the shop=
keepers, with whom the=20

fair young Englishman became quite a wherever there are excavations of some=
 feet deep, the=20

geological constitution of the Llanos. A formation of red sandstone (ancien=
t conglomerate) covers=20

an extent of several thousand square leagues. We shall find it again in the=
 vast plains of the=20

Amazon, on the eastern boundary of the province of Jaen de Bracamoros. This=
 prodigious=20

extension of red sandstone in the low grounds stretching along the east of =
the Andes, is one of the=20

most striking phenomena I observed during my examination of rocks in the eq=
uinoctial regions.=20

The red sandstone of the Llanos of Caracas lies in a concave position, betw=
een the primitive=20

mountains of the shore and of Parime. On the north it is backed by the tran=
sition-slates,* (* At=20

Malpaso and Piedras Azules.) and on the south it rests immediately on the g=
ranites of the Orinoco.=20

We observed in it rounded fragments of quartz (kieselschiefer), and Lydian =
stone, cemented by an=20

olive-brown ferruginous clay. The cement is sometimes of so bright a red th=
at the people of the=20

country take it for cinnabar. We met a Capuchin monk at Calabozo, who was i=
n vain attempting to=20

extract mercury from this red sandstone. In the Mesa de Paja this rock cont=
ains strata of another=20

quartzose sandstone, very fine-grained; more to the south it contains masse=
s of brown iron, and=20

fragments of petrified trees of the monocotyledonous family, but we did not=
 see in it any shells.=20

The red sandstone, called by the Llaneros, the stone of the reefs (piedra d=
e arrecifes), is=20

everywhere covered with a stratum of clay. This clay, dried and hardened in=
 the sun, splits into=20

separate prismatic pieces with five or six sides. Does it belong to the tra=
p-formation of Parapara?=20

It becomes thicker, and mixed with sand, as we approach the Rio Apure; for =
near Calabozo it is=20

one toise thick, near the mission of Guayaval five toises, which may lead t=

ted if he tried to explain=20

himself. One day his mother, having run short of methylated spirit, for her=
 teakettle, sent him with a=20

bottle to buy some more. He looked the words up in a dictionary, entered a =
chemist's, and=20

demanded "alcohol for burning" in his best Italian. The assistant seemed my=
stified, Pavones little=20

nodules of blue iron-ore disseminated in the clay.  A dense whitish-gray li=
mestone, with a smooth=20

fracture, somewhat analogous to that of Caripe, and consequently to that of=
 Jura, lies on the red=20

sandstone between Tisnao and Calabozo.* (* Does this formation of secondary=
 limestone of the=20

Llanos contain galena? It has been found in strata of black marl, at=20

ed about, and in much=20

triumph produced an "Alcock's porous plaster," which he vehemently assured =

and expense, and=20

certain to cure the ailment from which he was suffering. How Vincent would =
have got out of the=20

her places, for instance=20

in the Mesa de San Diego, and between Ortiz and the Mesa de Paja,* (* Also =
near Cachipe and=20

San Joacquim, in the Llanos of Barcelona.) we find above the limestone lame=
llar gypsum=20

alternating with strata of marl. Considerable quantities of this gypsum are=
 sent to the city of=20

Caracas,* which is situated amidst primitive=20
