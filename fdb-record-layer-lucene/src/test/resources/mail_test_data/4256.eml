a clatter of exhausts, while the three girls went back to Ye Olde Spinning =
Wheel.  "Who do you=20

suppose they could be--those two fellows?" asked Bess.  "Haven't the least =
idea," her sister=20

assured her.  "It couldn't have been Paul Hastings, could it?"  "Of course =
not!" declared Cora.=20

"Paul isn't given to playing such jokes. Besides, he's in the auto business=
 you know, and he=20

doesn't believe in taking chances with the cars of others. It may be a joke=
, as Jack says, and some=20

of our numerous friends may have tried to scare us, or it may be----"  "Don=
't say your lovely car is=20

really _stolen_!" interrupted Bess, impulsively.  "Well, I'd have to say it=
 if it were," declared the=20

practical Cora. "And the sooner we find out the better, in order to get the=
 police after the thieves."=20

Wearily they trudged back to the tea room, which they had left so suddenly.=
  "Let's have some=20

more ice cream while we're waiting," suggested Bess.  They had nearly finis=
hed their second=20

plates when the honking of a horn warned them of the approach of some one. =
Eagerly they looked=20

out to see Jack and Walter returning.  "We lost the trail!" Jack called. "I=
 saw the tire marks, Cora,=20

for a little way, then they disappeared. We'll have to notify the police. Y=
our car's stolen all right."=20

"Oh, Jack!"  "Might as well realize it first as last, Sis! Where's a teleph=
one?" he asked the waitress.=20

CHAPTER III--TWO STRANGE MEN   "What are you going to do, Jack?" asked Cora=
.  "Notify the=20

Chelton police, and also the authorities here. They will send out a general=
 alarm better than we=20

can. Now who saw these chaps, and how did they look?"  "Belle saw them."  L=
eg at C, through the=20

Ribs, passing close by the Blade-Bone, to keep that up tight, and another t=
hrough the Point of the=20

same Branch, as at D, which finishes the Upper-Part. Then bend in both Legs=
 between the=20

Haunches, so that their Points meet under the Scut, and skewer them fast, w=
ith two Skewers, as=20

at O O.    A Fowl trussed for Boiling. From Mr. _W. N._ Poulterer, &c.  [Il=
lustration: Fig. 11]  When=20

it is drawn, twist the Wings till you bring the Pinnion under the Back; and=
 you may, if you will,=20

enclose the Liver and Gizzard, one in each Wing, as at A, but they are comm=
only left out. Then=20

beat down the Breast Bone, that it does not rise above the fleshy Part; the=
n cut off the Claws of=20

the Feet, and twist the Legs, and bring them on the out-side of the Thigh, =
towards the Wing, as at=20

B, and cut an Hole on each side the Apron, just above the Sides-man, and pu=
t the Joints of the=20

Legs into the Body of the Fowl, as at C: so this is trussed without a Skewe=
r.    To Truss a=20

_Pheasant_ or _Partridge._ From the same.  [Illustration: Fig. 12]  Both th=
e Pheasant and=20

Partridge are trussed the same way, only the Neck of the Partridge is cut o=
ff, and the Neck and=20

Head of the Pheasant is left on: the Plate above shews the Pheasant trussed=
. When it is drawn,=20

cut off the Pinnions, leaving only the stump-bone next the Breast, and pass=
 a Skewer through its=20

Point, and through the Body near the Back, and then give the Neck a turn; a=
nd passing it by the=20

Back, bring the Head on the outside of the other Wing-Bone, as at A, and ru=
n the Skewer through=20

both, with the Head landing towards the Neck, or the Rump, which you please=
: B is where the=20


_
these villainous characters."  "I wouldn't call them particularly villainou=
s looking," said the tall girl.=20

"In fact we thought for a time it was you two, and----"  "I see," interrupt=
ed Walter. "Belle, I thank=20

you for your good opinion."  "Come on, get down to business!" exclaimed Jac=
k Kimball. "I want to=20

know how these fellows looked so I can tell the police. Were they young or =
old?"  "Two young=20

men," answered Belle. "They were about your age, Jack."  "But, unfortunatel=
y, they did not have=20

his angelic disposition," mocked Walter. "Bouquets are coming your way fast=
, Jack."  "I'll dispense=20

with them. Come on now, Belle. Anything else except that they were young?" =
 Belle thought for a=20

moment. She had had such a momentary glimpse of the two that, really, it wa=
s hard to describe=20

them adequately for the purposes of police detection.  "Why not describe th=
e car?" asked Cora.=20

"No matter who is in my machine they haven't a right to it, and they should=
 be arrested on sight."=20

"Good idea!" agreed Jack. "I can describe the car right enough."  "And give=
 the license numbers,"=20

said Bess.  "Of course. Good girl. Let me have them, Cora."  They were the =
only ones in the tea=20

room at this time, and the excitement was only communicated to the help. Th=
e waitress showed=20

Jack where the telephone booth was, and while Cora, Walter and the girls ex=
plained to the girl=20

cashier at the desk what had happened, Jack got the Chelton police over the=
 telephone and asked=20

them to send out an alarm, and also to be on the lookout for the thieves.  =
The tea room was in=20

Pepack, the township next to Chelton, and Jack also called up the town hall=
 and notified the=20

authorities there, who promised to do what they could.  the Joints together=
, so as to press the=20

lower Part of the Breast, then press them down between the Sides-men, and p=
ass a Skewer=20

through all, as at C. Remember a Partridge must have its Neck cut off, or e=
lse in every thing is=20

trussed like a Pheasant.    To boil an artificial _Pheasant,_ with _Sellary=
._ From Mrs. _Johnson,=20

Devereux-Court_ near _Temple-Bar._  Prepare a Rabbit in the same manner as =
above directed,=20

only it must not be larded; then boil it, and give it the following Sauce. =
Take six or seven Roots of=20

Sellary, and boil them, when they are well clean'd from Dirt, till they are=
 tender, then cut them into=20

pieces of about two Inches long, and toss them up with strong Gravey thicke=
n'd with burnt Butter.=20

Pour this over the artificial Pheasant, and serve it hot, well impregnated =
with Spice. Then garnish it=20

with Lemon sliced, or sliced Orange, and some fry'd Bread, and some Slices =
of pickled red Beet-

Roots; or round the Edges of the Dish, strew some sifted raspings of Bread.=

"But they may have taken any of half a dozen roads leading out of here," Wa=

Cora.  She knew, slightly, the girl who sat at the cash register, for Ye Ol=
