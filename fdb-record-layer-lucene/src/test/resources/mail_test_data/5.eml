mpliment from the=20

appreciative ragamuffins on the pavement. "_Ah! che ragazza bellisima._" "_=
Che figlia=20

incomparabile._" And as an antithesis to this flowery Italian praise, said =
one British 'Arry to another=20

British 'Arry in the crowd, "Did you see her ankles, George? Do you know wh=
o that lady is?"=20

Certainly the white satin dress of the Watteau costume that the lady whom H=
aggard was escorting=20

wore, disclosed an undeniable instep, and 'Arry's favourable criticism was =
not undeserved. "I know=20

one thing," said his friend, "there was no humbug in the single stone brill=
iants she wore as ear-

rings." The pair disappeared among the glittering and gaily-dressed crowd t=
hat thronged the=20

portico.  M. Barbiche, formerly of the French Embassy to the Court of St. J=
ames's, his eyeglass=20

tightly screwed into one of his wicked little eyes, was lolling against one=
 of the pillars of the=20

_foyer_. He was criticizing the arrivals to Lord Spunyarn, who yawned by hi=
s side, evidently=20

thinking the whole affair a bore.  "Our Haggard, my friend, is what you cal=
l an old fox, I fear. Who=20

was the charming girl in the blue domino he was dancing with? I failed to r=
ecognize her. She is no=20

_habitue_ here. He intrigues me, this Haggard of ours."  "Pooh!" replied th=
e philosophic lord, as he=20

drove an unusually large volume of cigarette smoke through both nostrils; "=
some milliner's=20

apprentice probably, got up regardless of expense."  "No, my friend, the sh=
epherdess was too well=20

_chausee_ for that; besides, her mask hides her face too well. Your milline=
r would not be so=20

_farouche_ as to hide her face, unless, _ma foi_, she had perchance a bad c=
omplexion; but our=20

Haggard is too great a connoisseur for that. However, he shall introduce me=
 to this mystery, and=20

we shall see."  "I wouldn't try if I were you, Barbiche."  "And why not, my=
 friend? Why not, if you=20

please? Is this Haggard, this English Adonis of yours, with the manners of =
a prize-fighter, is he to=20

_croquer_ all to himself all the pretty girls of Rome? Is it not enough tha=
t he shall have the prettiest=20

wife in Rome? No, I wrong that angel, the most beautiful and the most virtu=
ous of her sex. Is it not=20

enough that this man shall every morning sit down to breakfast with the lov=
ely Mees Lucy? Ah!=20

when I think of Mees Lucy, I remember myself once more, and I think of thos=
e happy days in the=20

Quartier Latin, before my uncle does me the honour to die, and I embark mys=
elf in the diplomatic=20

career. I study your language in your Dickens, in your Thackeray; at last I=
 attain proficiency. You=20

see it for yourself, no Englishman ever shall suspect me, when we shall con=
verse, of being other=20

than a Briton. It is the same thing with the charming Mees Lucy. I, a Frenc=
hman, feel my heart=20

beat in sympathy with hers; she is to me a _compatriote_. We speak to each =
other as I used to=20

speak to Cascadette in those old happy times. _Vlan ca y est._ This Haggard=
 of yours he shall=20

have his most beautiful wife, her most lovely cousin, but what shall he wan=
t with this little=20

shepherdess in the blue domino. Bah," said the indignant man as he stamps h=
is foot and settles=20

himself down into his enormous collar, "I say he _shall_ introduce me. Thin=
k you, my friend, that I=20

fear this 'la-out?' No, I am of the first force, my Shirtings, at the _sava=
te_."  "What's that?" said=20

Lord Spunyarn stolidly.  "My friend, _nous autres_, we do not box like you,=
 but we use the=20

_savate_. Behold, then, what is the _savate_." And here M. Barbiche suddenl=
y threw himself into=20

the attitude of an enraged and aggressive monkey. "A ruffian, he strike me,=
 P-r-r-r-r-r," and here=20

M. Barbiche his side.  =E2=80=9CA strange scene this!=E2=80=9D said the par=
asite.  =E2=80=9CIs it unusual?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair.=20

=E2=80=9CSuch a medley! How can they can be got together, I marvel=E2=80=94=
priests and philosophers,=20

legitimists, and carbonari! Wonderful woman, Mrs. Putney Giles!=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CShe is very entertaining,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand seems to me clever.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CRemarkably so,=
=E2=80=9D said the parasite, who had been on the point=20



of satirizing his hostess, but, observing the quarter of the wind, with rap=
idity went in for praise. =E2=80=9CAn=20

extraordinary woman. Your lordship had a long talk with the cardinal.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CI had the honor of some=20

conversation with Cardinal Grandison,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, drawing up.  =
=E2=80=9CI wonder what the cardinal=20

would have said if he had met Mazzini here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMazzini! Is =
he here?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot now; but I have seen=20

him here,=E2=80=9D said the parasite, =E2=80=9Cand our host such a Tory! Th=
at makes the thing so amusing;=E2=80=9D and=20

then the parasite went on making small personal observations on the surroun=
ding scene, and=20

every now and then telling little tales of great people with whom, it appea=
red, he was intimate=E2=80=94all=20

concerted fire to gain the very great social fortress he was now besieging.=
 The parasite was so full=20

of himself, and so anxious to display himself to advantage, that with all h=
is practice it was some=20

time before he perceived he did not make all the way he could wish with Lot=
hair; who was=20

courteous, but somewhat monosyllabic and absent.  =E2=80=9CYour lordship is=
 struck by that face?=E2=80=9D said the=20

parasite.  Was Lothair struck by that face? And what was it?  He had exchan=
ged glances with that=20

face during the last ten minutes, and the mutual expression was not one of =
sympathy but curiosity=20

blended, on the part of the face, with an expression, if not of disdain, of=
 extreme reserve.  It was=20

the face of a matron, apparently of not many summers, for her shapely figur=
e was still slender,=20

though her mien was stately. But it was the countenance that had commanded =
the attention of=20

Lothair: pale, but perfectly Attic in outline, with the short upper lip and=
 the round chin, and a=20

profusion of dark-chestnut hair bound by a Grecian fillet, and on her brow =
a star.  =E2=80=9CYes I am struck=20

by that face. Who is it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf your lordship could only get=
 a five-franc piece of the last French=20

Republic, 1850, you would know. I dare say the money-changers could get you=
 one. All the artists=20

of Paris, painters, and sculptors, and medallists, were competing to produc=
e a face worthy of=20

representing =E2=80=98La R publique fran aise;=E2=80=99 nobody was satisfie=
d, when Oudine caught a girl of not=20

seventeen, and, with a literal reproduction of Nature, gained the prize wit=
h unanimity.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd,=20

though years have passed, the countenance has not changed; perhaps improved=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is a=20

countenance that will bear, perhaps even would require, maturity,=E2=80=9D =
said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut she is no=20

longer =E2=80=98La R=C3=A9publique fran=C3=A7 aise;=E2=80=99 what is she no=
w?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShe is called Theodora, though married, I=20

believe, to an Englishman, a friend of Garibaldi. Her birth unknown; some s=
ay an Italian, some a=20

Pole; all sorts of stories. But she speaks every language, is ultra-cosmopo=
litan, and has invented a=20

new religion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA new religion!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWould y=
our lordship care to be introduced to her? I know her=20

enough for that. Shall we go up to her?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have made so m=
any now acquaintances to-day,=E2=80=9D said,=20

Lothair, as it were starting from a reverie, =E2=80=9Cand indeed heard so m=
any new things, that I think I had=20

better say good-night;=E2=80=9D and he graciously retired.       CHAPTER 9 =
About the same time that=20

Lothair had repaired to the residence of Mr. Giles, Monsignore Berwick, who=
se audience of the=20

cardinal in the morning had preceded that of the legal adviser of the trust=
ees, made his way=20

toward one of the=20


_
sprang suddenly high in air, and with one adroit and well-directed kick kno=
cked off the hat of the=20

astonished Spunyarn.  In the tohu bohu at Papayani's this singular action o=
f M. Barbiche excited=20

not the slightest surprise; he simply received a vociferous round of applau=
se from the bystanders=20

in his immediate neighbourhood. Excited by the success of his achievement, =
Barbiche for the=20

moment forgot the Embassy, the Duc de la Houspignolle, and the proprieties;=
 he had been wound=20

up by Papayani's music, and by more than one glass of Papayani's champagne.=
 The Frenchman=20

became for the moment once more Le petit Furibon, the darling of the Closer=
ie de Lilas, the=20

champion of the Quartier Latin, the Elisha upon whose worthy shoulders had =
descended the=20

mantle of the prophet, the vanished Caouchouc.  At this moment the strains =
of Arditi's immortal=20

waltz, "Il Bacio," resounded through the place. The head of M. Barbiche kep=
t time to the music,=20

and he regarded the dancers with a scrutinizing gaze; his eye evidently sou=
ght Haggard and the=20

mysterious shepherdess. As the ring of maskers which surrounded the space s=
et apart for the=20

dancers thinned, as numerous couples joined in the waltz, the watchful Fren=
chman was rewarded.=20

"_La voila, mon ami_," he said, for Barbiche, when excited, forgot the Engl=
ish of which he was so=20

proud.  Directly opposite Lord Spunyarn and his French friend stood Haggard=
 and his=20

shepherdess. She nestled at his side, clinging to his arm and gazing up int=
o his eyes. The hood of=20

the pale blue silk domino was now thrown back, disclosing a magnificent hea=
d of powdered hair;=20

the complexion of the lady's neck and shoulders was dazzling, and evidently=
 natural; her rounded=20

arms had more of the Venus than the Juno about them; her figure, as she gaz=
ed up into=20

Haggard's face, was seen to be perfection. The little foot beat time to the=
 music of the waltz. But a=20

black silk mask with a heavy fall of lace hid every feature, save a rounded=
 chin and a pair of=20

magnificent eyes, which seemed to be pleading to Haggard, and the shell-lik=
e ears in which=20

blazed the diamond solitaires which had attracted the attention of the Brit=
ish "'Arry" in the street.=20

Haggard's face was suddenly lit up with pleasure, his arm slipped round the=
 little waist, the left=20

hand of the shepherdess was confidingly placed on the shoulder of her champ=
ion; they started=20

and joined the numerous pairs whirling round to the music of "Il Bacio." So=
on the couple excited=20

attention, of which both seemed to be wholly unaware. Haggard, though he wa=
s a married man,=20

was still a good dancer, and even here in a foreign ball-room, where, as a =
rule, the dancing=20

Englishman is an object of ridicule, he distinguished himself. For Haggard,=
 unlike most of the=20

dancers present (at all events those of the male sex), was perfectly sober;=
 not that the proverbially=20

moderate Italians had exceeded in the use of their light but notoriously na=
sty wines, but an Italian=20

easily becomes intoxicated, exalted, exhilarated, beside himself under the =
combined influences of=20

a Carnival ball, the lights, the perfumes, the music, the dancing, and abov=
e all the eyes of his=20

_inamorata_. Can we blame Petrarch for being cheerful when Laura smiles? Bu=
t no Italian present=20

was in so exalted a state as M. Barbiche of the French Embassy, once so wel=
l known as Le petit=20

Furibon, of the Latin Quarter.  As the pairs gradually dropped out, Haggard=
 and his partner=20

became the cynosure of every eye. In vain did Pasquino whirl his Contadina =
with the ruddled=20

cheeks, varying his saltatory gymnastics with an occasional scream; in vain=
 did young Mr. Simon=20

E. Brown, that very rough diamond from New York city, who had come to Europ=
e for polish, and=20

was undergoing the process (in the costume of one of the Wise Men of Gotham=
 who went to sea=20

in a bowl) at the hands of the Signorina Esperanza, of the Scala, or any of=
 the motley crew,=20

attempt to attract the public gaze: every eye was riveted with admiration o=
n the shepherdess, that=20



is to say, every male eye; the female organs of vision turned from her in d=
isgust, to admire or=20

criticize her partner, and in the end to feel dissatisfied with their own p=
eculiar victims. For if the=20

resided Lord St. Jerome.  It was a mild winter evening; a little fog still =
hanging about, but=20

vanquished by the cheerful lamps, and the voice of the muffin-bell was just=
 heard at intervals; a=20

genial sound that calls up visions of trim and happy hearths. If we could o=
nly so contrive our lives=20

as to go into the country for the first note of the nightingale, and return=
 to town for the first note of=20

the muffin-bell, existence, it is humbly presumed, might be more enjoyable.=
  Monsignore Berwick=20

was a young man, but looking younger from a countenance almost of childhood=
; fair, with light-

blue eyes, and flaxen hair and delicate features. He was the last person yo=
u would have fixed=20

upon as a born Roman; but Nature, in one of the freaks of race, had resolve=
d that his old Scottish=20

blood should be reasserted, though his: ancestors had sedulously blended it=
, for, many=20

generations, with that of the princely houses of the eternal city. The mons=
ignore was the greatest=20

statesman of Rome, formed and favored by Antonelli and probably his success=
or.  The mansion of=20

Lord St. Jerome was a real family mansion, built by his ancestors a century=
 and a half ago, when=20

they believed that, from its central position, its happy contiguity to the =
court, the senate, and the=20

seats of government, they at last, in St. James=E2=80=99s Square, had disco=
vered a site which could defy=20

the vicissitudes of fashion, and not share the fate of the river palaces, w=
hich they had been=20

obliged in turn to relinquish. And in a considerable degree they were right=
 in their anticipation; for,=20

although they have somewhat unwisely, permitted the clubs to invade too suc=
cessfully their=20

territory, St. James=E2=80=99s Square may be looked upon as our Faubourg St=
. Germain, and a great=20

patrician residing there dwells in the heart of that free and noble life of=
 which he ought to be a part.=20

A marble hall and a marble staircase, lofty chambers with silk or tapestrie=
d hangings, gilded=20

cornices, and painted ceilings, gave a glimpse of almost Venetian splendor,=
 and rare in our=20

metropolitan houses of this age; but the first dwellers in St. James=E2=80=
=99s Square had tender and=20

inspiring recollections of the Adrian bride, had frolicked in St. Mark=E2=
=80=99s, and glided in adventurous=20

gondolas. The monsignore was ushered into a chamber bright with lights and =
a blazing fire, and=20

welcomed with extreme cordiality by his hostess, who was then alone. Lady S=
t. Jerome was still=20

the young wife of a nobleman not old. She was the daughter of a Protestant =
house, but, during a=20

residence at Rome after her marriage, she had reverted to the ancient faith=
, which she professed=20

with the enthusiastic convictions of a convert. Her whole life was dedicate=
d to the triumph of the=20

Catholic cause; and, being a woman of considerable intelligence and of an a=
rdent mind, she had=20

become a recognized power in the great confederacy which has so much influe=
nced the human=20

race, and which has yet to play perhaps a mighty part in the fortunes of th=
e world.  =E2=80=9CI was in great=20

hopes that the cardinal would have met you at dinner,=E2=80=9D said Lady St=
. Jerome, =E2=80=9Cbut he wrote only=20

this afternoon to say unexpected business would prevent him, but he would b=
e here in the=20

evening, though late.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt must be something sudden, for I=
 was with his eminence this morning,=20

and he then contemplated our meeting here.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNothing from =
abroad?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI should think not, or it=20

would be known to me. There is nothing new from abroad this afternoon: my t=
ime has been spent=20

in writing, not receiving, dispatches.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd all well, I h=
ope?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThis Scotch business plagues us. So=20

far as Scotland is concerned, it is quite ripe; but the cardinal counsels d=
elay on account of this=20

country, and he has such a consummate knowledge of England, that=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=9D  At this moment Lord St=20

Jerome entered the room=E2=80=94a grave but gracious personage, polished bu=
t looking silent, though he=20



immediately turned the conversation to the weather. The monsignore began de=
nouncing English=20

fogs; but Lord St. Jerome maintained that, on the whole, there were not mor=
e fogs in England than=20

in any other country; =E2=80=9Cand as for the French,=E2=80=9D he added, =
=E2=80=9CI like their audacity, for, when they=20

revolutionized the calendar, they called one of their=20


_
shepherdess turned the heads of most of those present, Haggard was undeniab=
ly the best-looking=20

man in the vast arena. But even the strength of a muscular English dancing =
man must give way at=20

length to the power of an Italian waltz played fast at past midnight. As fo=
r his partner, I believe she=20

could have gone on for ever, but she had perceived that they were attractin=
g attention; she=20

discreetly drew the hood of her pale blue silk domino over her head and hid=
 herself in the recesses=20

of that mysterious garment. As ill luck would have it, the pair pulled up c=
lose to the excited=20

Furibon.  "_Ah, mon vieux_," cried the Frenchman, advancing with extended h=
ands, "you have=20

rejoiced our eyes. _Ah, gredin_," whispered Furibon, as he indiscreetly pok=
ed his friend in the ribs.=20

"Ta ta, old man, I must be off," replied Haggard with a frown, as the sheph=
erdess clung in evident=20

trepidation to his arm. "For God's sake, Shirtings, take him away, or there=
'll be a row," muttered=20

Haggard to his friend below his breath, his white teeth showing beneath his=
 black  Then came in=20

one of his lordships chaplains, who saluted the monsignore with reverence, =
and immediately=20

afterward a beautiful young lady, his niece, Clare Arundel.  The family wer=
e living in a convenient=20

suite of small rooms on the ground-floor, called the winter-rooms so dinner=
 was announced by the=20

doors of an adjoining chamber being thrown open, and there they saw, in the=
 midst of a chamber=20

hung with green silk and adorned with some fine cabinet-pictures, a small r=
ound table, bright and=20

glowing.  It was a lively dinner. Lord St. Jerome loved conversation, thoug=
h he never conversed.=20

=E2=80=9CThere must be an audience,=E2=80=9D he would say, =E2=80=9Cand I a=
m the audience.=E2=80=9D The partner of his life, whom=20

he never ceased admiring, had originally fascinated him by her conversation=
al talents; and, even if=20

Nature had not impelled her, Lady St. Jerome was too wise a woman to relinq=
uish the spell. The=20

monsignore could always, when necessary, sparkle with anecdote or blaze wit=
h repartee; and all=20

the chaplains, who abounded in this house, were men of bright abilities, no=
