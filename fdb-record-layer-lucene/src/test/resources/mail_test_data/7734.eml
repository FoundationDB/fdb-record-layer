war, soldiers have dreamed high dreams of their rewards. But they have not =

because their dreams were impractical, somewhat because the dreams that wer=

for two decades the labour problem has been carefully thought out. Labour i=

population, living in great part beyond the tropics, and in the same latitu=

pastoral tribes of central Asia? If the Chinese have ever been a pastoral p=
eople, how have they=20

lost the tastes and habits so intimately connected with that state, which p=
recedes agricultural=20

institutions? These questions are interesting with respect both to the hist=
ory of the nations of=20

oriental Asia, and to the ancient communications that are supposed to have =
existed between that=20

part of the world and the north of Mexico.  We went down the Orinoco in two=
 days, from Carichana=20

to the mission of Uruana, after having again passed the celebrated strait o=
f Baraguan. We stopped=20

several times to determine the velocity of the river, and its temperature a=
t the surface, which was=20

27.4 degrees. The velocity was found to be two feet in a second (sixty-two =
toises in 3 minutes 6=20

seconds) in places where the bed of the Orinoco was more than twelve thousa=
nd feet broad, and=20

from ten to twelve fathoms deep. The slope of the river is in fact extremel=

 formulate a demand=20

for a place in the directorate of industries. This place in the directorate=
 of industries is demanded=20

that labour may have an intelligent knowledge of the profits of a business =
so that labour honestly=20

may share those profits with capital. That this condition is coming in Euro=

who will refuse to be over-taxed. During our visit to the front the soldier=
s were forever saying to=20

Henry and me: "We have offered our lives. Those who stayed at home must giv=
e up their riches."=20

And as we went about in England we were always hearing about the wisdom of =
a heavy=20

confiscatory tax. difference of height might be determined by approximation=
, by measuring from=20

time to time the velocity of the stream, and the extent of the section in b=
readth and depth. We had=20

some observations of the stars at Uruana. I found the latitude of the missi=
on to be 7 degrees 8=20

minutes; but the results from different stars left a doubt of more than 1 m=
inute. The stratum of=20

mosquitos, which hovered over the ground, was so thick that I could not suc=
ceed in rectifying=20

properly the artificial horizon. I tormented myself in vain; and regretted =
that I was not provided with=20

a mercurial horizon. On the 7th of June, good absolute altitudes of the sun=
 gave me 69 degrees 40=20

minutes for the longitude. We had advanced from Esmeralda 1 degree 17 minut=
es toward the=20

west, and this chronometric determination merits entire confidence on accou=
nt of the double=20

observations, made in going and returning, at the Great Cataracts, and at t=
he confluence of the=20

Atabapo and of the Apure.  The situation of the mission of Uruana is extrem=

little Indian village stands at the foot of a lofty granitic mountain. Rock=
s everywhere appear in the=20

form of pillars above the forest, rising higher than the tops of the talles=
t trees. The aspect of the=20

Orinoco is nowhere more majestic than when viewed from the hut of the missi=
onary, Fray Ramon=20

g that immediately after=20

the war a tax-measure should be passed which would at once confiscate a cer=
tain portion of the=20

property of the country--one hears different per cents discussed; some decl=
are that ten per cent is=20

enough, while others hold that it will require 25 per cent. This confiscato=
ry tax is to be collected=20

when any piece of the river; the two banks are parallel, and we cannot call=
 it divided into different=20

branches. The mission is inhabited by the Ottomacs, a tribe in the rudest s=
tate, and presenting=20

one of the most extraordinary physiological phenomena. They eat earth; that=
 is, they swallow=20

every day, during several months, very considerable quantities, to appease =
hunger, and this=20

practice does not appear to have any injurious=20


_
is to be used for paying off the national debt, or a considerable portion o=
f it at once. The situation=20

is completely changed from that which followed the Napoleonic wars, where w=
ar taxes fell largely=20

upon labour. So in self-preservation, capital is considering turning over a=
 part of its property to the=20

state to avoid the slow and disintegrating grind that otherwise inevitably =
must come.  A curious=20

side light on the way in which democracy is conducting this war is found in=
 the way by which it=20

finances the war. The great debt of the war, piled up mountain high, is of =
course, converted into=20

bonds. These bonds, similar to our Liberty Bonds, have been purchased not e=
xclusively by the=20

bankers as in former one day at Uruana, this short space of time sufficed t=
o make us acquainted=20

with the preparation of the poya, or balls of earth. I also found some trac=
es of this vitiated appetite=20

among the Guamos; and between the confluence of the Meta and the Apure, whe=
re everybody=20

speaks of dirt-eating as of a thing anciently known. I shall here confine m=
yself to an account of=20

what we ourselves saw or heard from the missionary, who had been doomed to =
live for twelve=20

years among the savage and turbulent tribe of the Ottomacs.  The inhabitant=
s of Uruana belong to=20
