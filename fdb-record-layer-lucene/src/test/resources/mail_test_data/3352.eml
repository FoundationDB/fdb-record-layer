cannot tell you all the happiness of the change, that God has been pleased =

by these means. And I have been benefited both temporally and spiritually b=

better done, and my people are more faithful, contented, and obedient than =
before; and I have the=20

comfort of thinking that when my Lord and master shall call me to account f=

Dialogues," etc., in the Appendix of Thomas Bacon's _Sermons Addressed to M=

Servants_.   A TRUE ACCOUNT OF have been. While the one was the official ca=
pital, the other=20

was the real heart of the old Muscovite empire. Here the Czars were baptize=
d, were crowned,=20

were buried; here were heaped all the treasures, were concentrated all the =
glories of their past. It=20

was their holy city, their Jerusalem. No one knew as yet that its destructi=
on had been a signal act=20

of patriotism and self-sacrifice; almost all the world, including the Czar =
himself, believed that the=20

French had consummated their atrocities by setting fire to the city. Nor co=
uld he or others foresee=20

the future, or discern at once amidst the dust and smoke of the conflict th=

was won. The final hour of=20


_
(Written about 1800)  Some years ago an English gentleman had occasion to b=
e in North America,=20

where, among other adventures, the following circumstances occurred to him =
which are related in=20

his own words.  "Every day's observation convinces me that the children of =
God, viz. those who=20

believe in him, and on such terms are accepted by him through Jesus Christ,=
 are made so by his=20

own especial grace and power inclining them to what is good, and, assisting=
 them when they=20

endeavor to be and continue so.  "In one of my excursions, while I was in t=
he province of New=20

York, I was walking by myself over a considerable plantation, amused with i=
ts husbandry, and=20

comparing it with that of my own country, till I came within a little dista=
nce of a middle aged negro,=20

who was tilling the ground. I felt a strong inclination to converse with hi=
m. After asking him some=20

little questions about his work, which he answered very sensibly, I wished =
him to tell me, whether=20

his state of slavery was not disagreeable to him, and whether he would not =
gladly exchange it for=20

his to friend nor foe; and to Alexander and to Russia the day that saw the =
fall of Moscow seemed=20

the darkest that had ever dawned upon them.  In the heart of Alexander it l=
eft =E2=80=9Ca profound and=20

bitter sorrow,=E2=80=9D which neither time, nor victory, nor glory could ev=
er wholly obliterate. Long=20

afterwards, when conquered France offered the conqueror pecuniary compensat=
ion, he answered=20

with proud sadness, =E2=80=9CGold can never give me Moscow back again.=E2=
=80=9D Yet not for one moment did=20

his courage fail or his determination falter. His wife implored him with te=
ars to make peace, or to=20

allow her to leave the empire. His mother, less submissive, actually prepar=
ed to go. He gently=20

dissuaded her from a course so injurious to the interests of the country, a=
nd at last, when she=20

refused to listen, he said firmly, =E2=80=9CI have entreated you as a son; =
I now command you as your=20

sovereign. You shall not go.=E2=80=9D Amidst the universal panic he alone s=
tood firm. Naturally susceptible,=20

tender-hearted, perhaps even irresolute, the hour of trial found him undaun=
ted as the fiercest of=20

his barbarian=20

"Massah," said he, looking seriously upon me, "I have wife and children; my=
 massah takes care of=20

them, and I have no care to provide anything; I have a good massah, who tea=
ch me to read; and I=20

read good book, that makes me happy." "I am glad," replied I, "to hear you =
say so; and pray what=20

is the good book you read?" "The Bible, massah, God's own good book." "Do y=
ou understand,=20

friend, as well as read this book? for many can read the words well, mainsp=
ring of some=20

complicated machine which sustains a pressure that would shatter a bar of i=
ron, so this fine=20

sensitive nature assumed the best attributes of strength, and bore up trium=
phantly against a world=20

in arms.  Amongst the first words which he addressed to his people after th=
e fall of Moscow were=20

these:--=E2=80=9CAn oppressed world looks to us for encouragement, and can =
we shrink from the=20

honourable mission? Let us kiss the hand that selected us=20


_
true and good sense." "O massah," says he, "I read the book much before I u=
nderstand; but at last=20

I found things in the book which made me very uneasy." "Aye," said I, "and =
what things were=20

they?" "Why massah, I found that I was a sinner, massah, a very great sinne=
r, I feared that God=20

would destroy me, because I was wicked, and done nothing as I should do. Go=
d was holy, and I=20

was very vile and naughty; so I could have nothing from him but fire and br=
imstone in hell, if I=20

continued in this state." In short, he fully convinced me that he was thoro=
ughly sensible of his=20

errors, and he told me what scriptures came to his mind, which he had read,=
 that both probed him=20

to the bottom of his sinful heart, and were made the means struggle for ind=
ependence, and=20

contend with courage and constancy to obtain a durable peace, not only for =
ourselves, but for=20

those unhappy countries forced by the tyrant to fight in his quarrel: it is=
 glorious, it is worthy of a=20

great nation, to _render good for ill_.=E2=80=9D The proclamation ends with=
 a prayer:--=E2=80=9CAlmighty God, is the=20

cause for which we are battling not just? Cast an eye of compassion on our =
holy Church. Preserve=20

to this people its courage and constancy. Suffer it to triumph over its adv=
ersary and thine. May it=20

be in thy hand the instrument of his destruction; and in delivering itself,=
 redeem the independence=20

of nations and of kings.=E2=80=9D  Here we recognize the secret of Alexande=
r=E2=80=99s strength. He knew himself=20
