be found, it would. She was as sure as of the fact of her existence (and of=
 this, as she had never=20

heard the Berkleyian theory propounded, she had not the slightest shadow of=
 a doubt), that it=20

would secure her the reward of long and meritorious servitude. The relative=

were not justified by the document when it turned up. The clerk was also ze=
alous in searching for it=20

ither will nor draft of a=20

will could, however, be found. The office and the house were ransacked. The=

cases, drawers, and bundles of papers, were critically examined without suc=

 to many millions.=20

Perhaps only the Chicago fire could compare with it in this respect. Anothe=
r great year of high=20

water was 1882: but the damage done was smaller, as the levees had been hei=

strengthened.  But the floods of this year, in area submerged, in long dura=
tion, in height of water,=20

of several.  The=20

father, was the=20

 order to accommodate=20
