Adepts, and it is this which helps the Mystic to become one. One must first=
 of all recognise one's=20

own immortal Principle, and then only can one conquer, or take the Kingdom =
of Heaven by=20

he third--man, the last=20

one being of dust. Nor can the second man, the "Son"--on this plane, as his=
 "Father" is the Son on=20

"Father." But to succeed=20

 for the better=20

comprehension of the non-initiated. But this is not all, for the Delphic in=
junction has to be fulfilled:=20
