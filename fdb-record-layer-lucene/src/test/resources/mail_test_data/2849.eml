civilization both girls and boys assured good Mr. Cameron that they had had=
 a most delightful=20

time. They traveled as far as Cheslow together, where Heavy and Belle and L=
luella went to their=20

homes for a day or two, to finish out the tag-end of the vacation, while th=
e Steeles and Isadore=20

went home with the Camerons, and Ruth returned to the Red Mill.  And how gl=
ad Aunt Alvirah was=20

to see Ruth! Uncle Jabez didn't display his feelings so openly; but Ruth ha=
d learned how to take=20

the miller, and how to understand him. She helped him with his accounts, ma=
de out his bills for the=20

year, and otherwise made herself of use to him.  "You just wait, Uncle Jabe=
z," she told him,=20

earnestly. "I'm going to make your investment in my schooling at Briarwood =
pay you the biggest=20

dividend of anything you ever speculated in--you see."  "I'm sure I hope so=
, Niece Ruth," he=20

grumbled. "I don't much expect it, though. They teach you too many folderol=
s up there. What's=20

_this_ now?" he asked, pointing his stubbed forefinger to the little gold a=
nd black enamel pin she=20

wore on her blouse.  "'S. B.'"  "Is them the letters?"  "Yes, sir. My socie=
ty emblem. We're the=20

Sweetbriars, of Briarwood Hall. And you wait! we're going to be the most po=
pular club in the=20

school before long. We've had Mrs. Tellingham, the Preceptress, at one of o=
ur meetings."  "What=20

good is that?" he demanded, shaking his grizzled head.  "Fraternity--fellow=
ship--helpfulness--

hope--oh! it stands for lots of things. And then, Uncle Jabez, I am learnin=
g to sing and happened. I=20

canna well give an account o't to myself. That I should been such an eediot=
, and you----maybe no'=20

so keen about your honour as your lordship's friends might desire." Here he=
 made a pause, as=20

sometimes a schoolmaster will do, to see his victim writhe and tempt him to=
 rebellion. But Rintoul=20

was cowed, and made no reply.  "And ye have much to answer for, my lord," R=
olls continued, "on=20

my account, though ye maybe never thought me worth a thought. Ye've led me =
to take a step that=20

it will be hard to win over--that has now no justification and little excus=
e. For my part, I canna see=20

my way out of it, one way or another," he added, with a sigh; "for you'll a=
llow that it's but little claim=20

you, or the like of you, for all your lordship, have upon me."  "I have no =
claim," said Rintoul, hastily;=20

and then he added, in a whisper of intense anxiety, "What are you going to =
do?"  Rolls rose up=20

from his bed to answer this question. He went to the high window with its i=
ron railings across the=20

light, from which he could just see the few houses that surrounded the gate=
s, and the sky, above=20

them. He gave a sigh, in which there was great pathos and self-commiseratio=
n, and then he said,=20

with a tone of bewilderment and despair, though his phraseology was not, pe=
rhaps, dignified,--"I'm=20

in a hobble that I cannot see how to get out of. A man cannot, for his ain =
credit, say one thing one=20

afternoon and another the next day."  "Rolls," said Rintoul, with new hope,=
 coming a little closer,=20

"we are not rich: but if=20


_
Maybe before long I can open the old cottage organ you've got stowed away i=
n the parlor and play=20

for you."  "That won't lower the price of wheat, or raise the price of flou=
r," he grumbled.  "How do=20

you know it won't, until we've tried it?" she answered him, gaily.  And so =
she made the old mill,=20

and the farmhouse adjoining, a much brighter, gayer, pleasanter place while=
 she was in it. Her=20

cheerfulness and sweetness were contagious. Aunt Alvirah complained less fr=
equently of her back=20

and bones when Ruth was about, and in spite of himself, the old miller's st=
ep grew lighter.  "Ah,=20

Jabez," Aunt Alvirah said, as they watched Ruth get into the Cameron automo=
bile to be whisked=20

away to the station, and so to Briarwood for her second half, "that's where=
 our endurin' comfort an'=20

hope is centered anyhow----"  "Hold your peace, my lord," said the old man =
testily--"hold your=20

peace. Speak o' the vulgar!" he added to himself, in an undertone of angry =
scorn. "Maybe you=20

think I did it for siller--for something I was to get!" Then he returned to=
 his bed and sat down again,=20

passing Rintoul as if he did not see him. "But the lad is young," he said t=
o himself, "and it would be=20

shairp, shairp upon the family, being the son-in-law and a'. And to say I d=
id it, and then to say I=20

didna do it, wha would put ony faith in me? I'm just committed to it one wa=
y or another. It's not=20

what I thought, but I'll have to see it through. My Lord Rintoul," said Rol=
ls, raising his head, "you've=20

gotten me into a pretty pickle, and I canna see my way out of it. I'm just =
that way situate that I=20

canna contradict=20


_
"She's a mighty expensive piece of property," snarled the old man.  "Ye don=
't mean it, Jabez, ye=20

don't mean it," she returned, softly. "You're thawin' out--and Ruth Fieldin=
g is the sun that warms up=20

your cold old heart!"  But this last was said so low that Jabez Potter did =
not hear it as he stumped=20

away toward the Red Mill.  In the automobile the young folks were having a =
gay time. Helen was=20

with Ruth, and Tom was on the front seat.  "Say, we sure did have some exci=
tement in Snow=20

Camp as well as fun," came from Tom.  "And that catamount!" gasped Helen.  =
"And Ruth's shot!"=20

broke in her twin brother. "Ruth, you ought to try for a marksmanship badge=
!"  "And wasn't it fine=20

how it came out about Fred," said Ruth, her face beaming with satisfaction.=
 "I am so glad to know=20

he is no longer a homeless wanderer!"  "All due to you," said Tom. "Ruth, y=
ou're a wonder!" he=20

added, admiringly.  "Oh, Tom!" she answered. Nevertheless, she looked much =
with an angry little=20

stamp of his foot. "They may say I'm a homicide, but no man shall say I'm a=
 leear. It would make=20

more scandal if I were to turn round upon you and convict ye out of your ai=
n mouth, than if I were=20

just to hold my tongue, and see what the High Court of Justeeciary will say=
."  "Rolls!" Rintoul could=20

not believe his ears in the relief and joy. He wanted to burst forth into a=
 thousand thanks, but=20

dared not speak lest he should offend rather than please. "Rolls! if you wi=
ll do me such a kindness,=20

I shall never forget it. No words can tell what I feel. If I can do anythin=
g--no, no, that is not what I=20

mean--to please you--to show my gratitude----"  "I am not one to flatter," =
said Rolls. "It would be for=20

none of your sake--it would be just for myself, and my ain credit. But ther=
e are twa-three things.=20

You will sign me a paper in your ain hand of write, proving that it was you=
, and no' me. I will make=20

no use o't till a's=20
