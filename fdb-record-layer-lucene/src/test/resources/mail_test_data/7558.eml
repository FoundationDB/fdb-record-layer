A sweet faced girl who has journeyed all the way from Seattle to take her b=
rother back with her,=20

finds that the law could not pardon an offender because his sister believes=
 in him and loves him.=20

The board must be shown that the punishment was too severe for the crime or=
 that life at home=20

will serve better to make the offender a useful citizen than doing penance =
at the prison.  To an=20

aged father and mother of a boy serving a thirty-month sentence for stealin=
g $56 worth of grain,=20

the sad news is meted out that their son must serve out his sentence. They =
had trusted with the=20

blind faith that the board would release him because they needed him. "The =
farm is running down=20

and Charlie ought to be home to help care for things. He had always been a =
good boy," they said.=20

Scathing lectures are often given those asking pardon for the undeserving, =
by the members of the=20

board. "Do you think fifteen months is too much for a man who shot his wife=
? It was not his fault=20

she did not die," the chief justice recently told some friends of a man who=
 had hunted up and shot=20

a wife who had left him. "If my sister were outraged by a man, shooting wou=
ld be none too good=20

for him," the governor recently told a smooth- tongued attorney who was mak=
ing a plea for a man=20

serving a long sentence for a heinous crime.  So it goes. There is mercy fo=
r a few; there is the=20

stern and unrelenting law tor the many.                          [decoratio=

NOTICES.                                    MORE LIGHT.   Mr. Heilbron's bo=
ok on Convict Life at the=20

Minnesota State Prison should obtain a wide circulation. The world outside =
regards the world=20

inside much as it would regard another planet, and is curious accordingly. =
As a general rule, the=20

"heroes" of this work of art are saying nothing and spinning twine and when=
 they get back to=20

Civilization they keep up the habit. While apt to examine books of this kin=
d in a decidedly critical=20

light, the heroes aforesaid will find in this one no misstatements of fact =
and no flights of fancy. The=20

illustrations too are excellent, the one of No. 1055's back being a speakin=
g likeness. Another first-

class picture is the one which reproduces the magnificent polish on Mr. Nel=
son's counter in the=20

tailor shop. The bindery, too, that smoothly running one-man department, ha=
s quite a palatial=20

appearance. The "chiel amang us takin'" flashlights is to be congratulated.=
 It may be doubted=20

whether a copy of this little book will hereafter be found in every home in=
 the state, but it would not=20

do any harm. Maybe when Horace was hesitating about signing papa's name in =
papa's=20

checkbook, the family copy would strike his eye and induce him to--go ahead=

Prison" Published by Mr. W. C. Heilbron of St. Paul.  "Convict Life at the =
Minnesota State Prison,"=20

of which Mr. W. C. Heilbron, assistant public examiner, St. Paul, is the au=

neat only we have not always those Conveniencies.    The _Smoking-Closets,_=
  It is to be=20

observ'd, from your own Writings, That the Smoking-Closets are of great use=
 in curing of Hams;=20

and they are no less useful in drying of Tongues. I have, in a place, in th=
e Country, one of them in=20

a Garret, where we enclose a Room of ten foot Square, where is a Chimney, i=
nto which, by a=20

Register, we let in the Smoke from the Fire, which is made on a Hearth, on =
the ground Floor; so=20

that the Smoke then does not come too hot on the Tongues, and so preserves =
them from turning=20

rusty. This is much the best way of curing them, and one may cure, in such =
a Room, fourscore=20

dozen at a time. This Place, likewise, we cure our Hung-Beef in. We have tr=
y'd some Sheeps=20

Tongues, salted only in a Brine of common Salt, and dry'd in such a Room; a=
nd they are very red,=20

and well tasted, though there is no Salt-Petre used in the Pickle.    A _Ca=
rp_ Pye. From Mrs.=20

_Mary Gordon._  Put to a quartern of Flour a pound and a half of Butter, ru=
bbing a third part in;=20



and make it into a Paste with Water: then roll in the rest of the Butter, a=
t two or three times, and=20

lay your Paste in the Dish, putting some bits of Butter, on the bottom Past=
e, with some Salt and=20

Pepper, at discretion.  Then scale and gut your Carp, and wash it with Vine=
gar, and dry it well; and=20

make the following Pudding for the Belly of the Carp: _viz._ Take the Flesh=
 of an Eel, and mince it=20

very small; add some grated Bread, some dry'd sweet Marjoram powder'd, two =
butter'd Eggs, a=20

small Anchovy minced, a little Nutmeg grated, and some Salt and Pepper; mix=
 this well, and fill the=20

Belly of the Carp with it; and for the remaining Part, make it into Balls. =
Then cut off the Tail and=20

Fins of the Carp, and lay it in the Crust, with the Balls about it; some Mu=
shroom Buttons, Oysters=20

with their Fins taken off, and some Shrimps, a few Slices of Lemon, and som=
e thin Slices of fat=20

Bacon, a little Mace and some bits of Butter: then close it, and before you=
 put it into the Oven,=20

pour in half a Pint of Claret. Serve this Pye hot.    To make Biscuits of _=
Potatoes._ From the same.=20

Boil the Roots of Potatoes, till they are tender; then peel them, and take =
their weight of fine Sugar,=20

finely sifted; grate some Lemon-Peel on the Sugar; and then beat the Potato=
es and Sugar=20

together, in a Stone Mortar, with some Butter, a little Mace, or Cloves, fi=
nely sifted, and a little=20

gar, finely sifted;=20

some Butter; the Yolks of hard Eggs, a little Flower; some Spice, finely be=
aten, and some Orange-

Flower-Water, and a little Lemon-Juice. When they are well mix'd, and reduc=
ed to a Paste, make=20

them into Cakes, and dry them in a slow Oven.    To=20

incidents of this institution, occupying 134 pages of text, including pictu=

remarkably good likeness of Hon. Henry Wolfer, the warden, under whose guid=

penitentiary, "Convict Life at the Minnesota State Prison" affords an accur=
ate and sustained story=20

from start to finish. In this book is given a detailed description of the r=
eception of the prisoner, the=20

manner in which he is handled, clothed, fed, assigned to duty and governed =
by the resident=20

officials, with excellent sidelights upon the situation.  The illustrations=
 are numerous and give=20

interior views of buildings, shops, departments and hospital, together with=
 interesting scenes of=20

parades, drills and other matters of moment to the reader.  Citizens--even =
those who have visited=20

penal institutions--obtain but a very scant conception of the method and ma=
nner in which they are=20

conducted by a casual observance upon the occasion of a visit. "Convict Lif=
e at the Minnesota=20

State Prison," however, is written so that all may gain a proper conception=
 by reading it, you think=20

fit, till you come to the white Part, and then bruise them, if you will, an=
d toss them up with Cream=20

or Butter, if you use them with boil'd Rabbits, or under a roasted Turkey; =
but in the last Case, this=20

Sauce should be serv'd in Basons, or on Plates. You may also bruise them, a=
nd strain them=20

through a Cullendar, and then put Cream to them; which is esteem'd the nice=
st way for a Turkey;=20

or if you keep them whole, you may warm them in strong Gravey, well drawn, =
with Spice and=20

sweet Herbs; and when that is done, thicken the Gravey with burnt Butter, a=
dding a little Claret, or=20

White Wine; or, for want of that, a little Ale. This is a Sauce for a Turke=
y roasted, or roast Mutton,=20

or Lamb.    _Hungary-Water._ From Mrs. _Du Pont,_ of _Lyons;_ which is the =
same, which has=20
