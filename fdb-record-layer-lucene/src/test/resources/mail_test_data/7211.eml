philodendron monstera one another. The intersection of the circle _ii_ and _cc_ is very slight, while the friction in unlocking begins within 1deg. of half the total movement of the fork from Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the philodendron monstera one another. The intersection of the circle _ii_ and _cc_ is very slight, while the friction in unlocking begins within 1deg. of half the total movement of the fork from Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the _
fork, which describes an arc of a circle, therefore the acting length is only the radius of that circle 

and must be multiplied by two in order to get the diameter. The acting length of fork = 4.5 mm., 

what is the amount of shake when the ruby pin passes the acting corner? 4.5 x 2 x 3.1416 / 

360deg. = .0785 x 1.25 = .0992 mm. The shake of the ruby pin in the slot of the fork must be as 

slight as possible, consistent with perfect freedom of action. It varies from 1/4deg. to 1/2deg., 

according to length of fork and shape of ruby pin. A square ruby pin requires more shake than any 

other kind; it enters the fork and receives the impulse in a diagonal direction on the jewel, in which 

position it is illustrated at Z, Fig. 20. This ruby pin acts on a knife edge, but for all that the engaging 

friction during the unlocking action is considerable.  Our reasoning tells us it matters not if a ruby 

pin be wide or narrow, it must have _the same_ freedom in passing the acting edge of the fork, 

therefore, to have the impulse radius on the distributing or creating derivative works based on this

A'X with AW, Fig. 17, we would require a _very_ narrow ruby pin. With 1deg. of freedom at the 

edge, and 1/2deg. in the slot, we could only have a ruby pin of a width of 1 1/2deg. Applying it to 

the preceding example it would only have an actual width of .0785 x 1.5 = .1178 mm., or the size 

of an ordinary balance pivot. At _n_, Fig. 17, we illustrate such a ruby pin; the theoretical and real 

impulse radius   are located before using this ebook.  1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm
