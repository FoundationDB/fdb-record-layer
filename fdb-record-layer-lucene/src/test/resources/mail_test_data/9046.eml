earth, through some of which all must pass, and through all of which the di=
sciple must pass, on his=20

way to Adeptship. Everyone passes through the lower Lokas, but not necessar=
ily through the=20

corresponding Talas. There are two poles in everything: seven states in eve=
ry state.  Vitala=20

represents a sublime as well as an infernal state. That state which for the=
 mortal is a complete=20

separation of the Ego from the personality is for a Buddha a mere temporary=
 separation. For the=20

Buddha it is a Kosmic state.  The Brahmans and Buddhists regard the Talas a=
s hells, but in reality=20

the term is figurative. We are in hell whenever we are in misery, suffer mi=
sfortune and so on.=20

Forms In The Astral Light.   The Elementals in the Astral light are reflect=
ions. Everything on earth=20

is reflected there. It is from these that photographs are sometimes obtaine=
d through mediums. The=20

mediums unconsciously produce them as forms. The  "No, no! I have fought to=
o long; they have=20

sold me, they shall give me up, and the eternal shame of treble treason sha=
ll fall on their heads."=20

"Sire," said Athos, "perhaps a king should act thus, but not a husband and =
a father. I have come in=20

the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in Lo=
ndon, and I say to you,=20

'Live, sire,'--it is the will of Heaven."  The king raised himself, buckled=
 on his belt, and passing his=20

handkerchief over his moist forehead, said:  "Well, what is to be done?"  "=
Sire, have you in the=20

army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely?"  "Winter," said the ki=
ng, "do you believe in=20

the fidelity of yours?"  "Sire, they are but men, and men are become both w=
eak and wicked. I will=20

not answer for them. I would confide my life to them, but I should hesitate=
 ere I trusted them with=20

your majesty's."  "Well!" said Athos, "since you have not a regiment, we ar=
e=20


_
a process that may be compared to the focussing of rays of light by a burni=
ng glass.    States Of=20

Consciousness.   Bhurloka is the waking state in which we normally live; it=
 is the state in which=20

animals also are, when they sense food, a danger, etc. To be in Svarloka is=
 to be completely=20

abstracted on this plane, leaving only instinct to work, so that on the mat=
erial plane you would=20

behave as an animal. Yogis are known who have become crystallized in this s=
tate, and then they=20

must be nourished by others. A Yogi near Allahabad had been for fifty-three=
 years sitting on a=20

stone; his Chelas plunge him into the river every night and then replace hi=
m. During the day his=20

consciousness returns to Bhurloka, and he talks and teaches. A Yogi was fou=
nd on an island near=20

Calcutta round whose limbs the roots of trees had grown. He was cut out, an=
d in the endeavour to=20

awaken him so many outrages were inflicted on him that he died.  _Q. Is it =
possible to be in more=20

than one state of consciousness at once?_  _A._ The consciousness cannot be=
 entirely on two=20

planes at once. The higher and lower states are not wholly incompatible, bu=
t if you are on the=20

higher you will wool-gather on the lower. In order to remember the higher s=
tate on returning to the=20

lower, the memory must be carried upwards to the higher. An Adept may appar=
ently enjoy a dual=20

consciousness; when he desires not to see he can abstract himself: he may b=
e in a higher state=20

and yet return answers to questions addressed to him. But in this case he w=
ill momentarily return=20

to the material plane, shooting up again to the higher plane. This is his o=
nly salvation in adverse=20

conditions.  The lower you go in the Talas the more intellectual you become=
 and the less spiritual.=20

You may be a morally good man but not spiritual. Intellect may remain very =
closely related to=20

Kama. A man may be in a Loka and visit one and all the Talas, his condition=
 depending on the=20

Loka to which he belongs. Thus a man in Bhurloka only may pass into the Tal=
as and go to the=20

devil. If he dwells in Bhuvarloka he cannot become as bad. If he has reache=
d the Satya state he=20

can go into any Tala without men. It is enough. Let your majesty mount on h=
orseback and place=20

yourself in the midst of us; we will cross the Tyne, reach Scotland, and yo=
u will be saved."  "Is this=20

your counsel also, Winter?" inquired the king.  "Yes, sire."  "And yours, M=
onsieur d'Herblay?"=20

"Yes, sire."  "As you wish, then. Winter, give the necessary orders."  Wint=
er then left the tent; in=20

the meantime the king finished his toilet. The first rays of daybreak penet=
rated the aperture of the=20

tent as Winter re-entered it.  "All is ready, sire," said he.  "For us, als=
o?" inquired Athos.  "Grimaud=20

and Blaisois are holding your horses, ready saddled."  "In that case," excl=
aimed Athos, "let us not=20

lose an instant, but set off."  "Come," added the king.  "Sire," said Arami=
s, "will not your majesty=20

acquaint some of your friends of this?"  "Friends!" answered Charles, sadly=
, "I have but three--one=20

of twenty years, who has never forgotten me, and two of a week's standing, =
whom I shall never=20

forget. Come, gentlemen, come!"  The king quitted his tent and found his ho=
rse ready waiting for=20

him. It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of whic=
h he was very fond.  The=20

horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him.  "Ah!" said the king, "I was unj=
ust; here is a creature=20

that loves me. You at least will be faithful to me, Arthur."  The horse, as=
 if it understood these=20

words, bent its red nostrils toward the king's face, and parting his lips d=
isplayed all its teeth, as if=20

with pleasure.  "Yes, yes," said the king, caressing it with his hand, "yes=
, my Arthur, thou art a fond=20

and faithful creature."  After this little scene Charles threw himself into=
 the saddle, and turning to=20

Athos, Aramis and Winter, said:  "Now, gentlemen, I am at your service."  B=
ut Athos was standing=20

with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne an=
d seemed to extend=20

double the length of the camp.  "What is that line?" cried Athos, whose vis=
ion was still rather=20



obscured by the uncertain shades and demi-tints of daybreak. "What is that =
line? I did not observe=20

it yesterday."  "It must be the fog rising from the river," said the king. =
 "Sire, it=20


_
by his own purity he can never be engulfed. The Talas are brain intellect s=
tates, while the Lokas--

or more accurately the three higher--are spiritual.  Manas absorbs the ligh=
t of Buddhi. Buddhi is=20

Arupa, and can absorb nothing. When the Ego takes all the light of Buddhi, =
it takes that of Atma,=20

Buddhi being the vehicle, and thus the three become one. This done, the _fu=
ll_ Adept is one=20

spiritually, but has a body. The fourfold Path is finished and he is one. T=
he Masters' bodies are, as=20

far as they are concerned, illusionary, and hence do not grow old, become w=
rinkled, etc.  The=20

student, who is not naturally psychic, should fix the fourfold consciousnes=
s in a higher plane and=20

nail it there. Let him make a bundle of the four lower and pin them to a hi=
gher state. He should=20

centre on this higher, trying not to permit the body and intellect to draw =
him down and carry him=20

away. Play ducks and drakes with the body, eating, drinking and sleeping, b=
ut living always on the=20

ideal.    Mother-Love.   Mother-love is an instinct, the same in the human =
being and in the animal,=20

and often stronger in the latter. The continuance of this love in human bei=
ngs is due to association,=20

to blood magnetism and to psychic affinity. Families are sometimes formed o=
f those who have=20

lived together before, but often not. The causes at work are very complex a=
nd have to be=20

balanced. Sometimes when a child with very bad Karma is to be born, parents=
 of a callous type=20

are chosen, or they may die before the Karmic results appear. Or the suffer=
ing through the child=20

may be their own Karma. Mother-love as an instinct is between Rasatala and =
Talatala.  The=20

Lipikas keep man's Karmic record, and impress it on the Astral Light.  Vaci=
llating people pass from=20

one state of consciousness to another.  Thought arises before desire. The t=
hought acts on the=20

brain, the brain on the organ, and then desire awakes. It is not the outer =
stimulus that arouses the=20

organ. Thought therefore must be slain ere desire can be extinguished. The =
student must guard=20

his thoughts. Five minutes' thought may undo the work of five years; and th=
ough the five years'=20

work will be run through more rapidly the second time,  "Indeed!" said Wint=
er, "it appears to me=20

like a bar of red color."  "It is the enemy, who have made a sortie from Ne=
wcastle and are=20

surrounding us!" exclaimed Athos.  "The enemy!" cried the king.  "Yes, the =
enemy. It is too late.=20

Stop a moment; does not that sunbeam yonder, just by the side of the town, =
glitter on the=20

Ironsides?"  This was the name given the cuirassiers, whom Cromwell had mad=
e his body-guard.=20

"Ah!" said the king, "we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betraye=
d me or not."  "What=20

are you going to do?" exclaimed Athos.  "To give them the order to charge, =
and run down these=20

miserable rebels."  And the king, putting spurs to his horse, set off to th=
e tent of Lord Leven.=20

"Follow him," said Athos.  "Come!" exclaimed Aramis.  "Is the king wounded?=
" cried Lord Winter. "I=20

see spots of blood on the ground." And he set off to follow the two friends=
.  He was stopped by=20

Athos.  "Go and call out your regiment," said he; "I can foresee that we sh=
all have need of it=20

directly."  Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on. It had tak=
en but two minutes for the=20

king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander; he dismounted and entered=
.  The general was=20

there, surrounded by the more prominent chiefs.  "The king!" they exclaimed=
, as all rose in=20

bewilderment.  Charles was indeed in the midst of them, his hat on his head=
, his brows bent,=20

striking his boot with his riding whip.  "Yes, gentlemen, the king in perso=
n, the king who has come=20

to ask for some account of what has happened."  "What is the matter, sire?"=
 exclaimed Lord=20

Leven.  "It is this, sir," said the king, angrily, "that General Cromwell h=
as reached Newcastle; that=20

you knew it and I was not informed of it; that the enemy have left the town=
 and are now closing the=20

passages of the Tyne against us; that our sentinels have seen this movement=
 and I have been left=20



unacquainted with it; that, by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two =
hundred thousand=20

pounds to Parliament. Of this treaty, at least, I have been warned. This is=
 the matter, gentlemen;=20

answer and exculpate yourselves, for I stand here to accuse you."  "Sire," =
said Lord Leven, with=20

hesitation, "sire, your=20


_
Consciousness.   H. P. B. began by challenging the views of consciousness i=
n the West,=20

commenting on the lack of definition in the leading Philosophies. No distin=
ction was made between=20

consciousness and self-consciousness, and yet in this lay the difference be=
tween man and the=20

animal. The animal was conscious only, not self-conscious; the animal does =
not know the Ego as=20

Subject, as does man. There is therefore an enormous difference between the=
 consciousness of=20

the bird, the insect, the deceived by false reports."  "My own eyes have se=
en the enemy extend=20

itself between myself and Scotland; and I can almost say that with my own e=
ars I have heard the=20

clauses of the treaty debated."  The Scotch chieftains looked at each other=
 in their turn with=20

frowning brows.  "Sire," murmured Lord Leven, crushed by shame, "sire, we a=
re ready to give you=20

every proof of our fidelity."  "I ask but one," said the king; "put the arm=
y in battle array and face the=20

enemy."  "That cannot be, sire," said=20


_
But the full consciousness of man is self-consciousness--that which makes u=
s say, "_I_ do that." If=20

there is pleasure it must be traced to some one experiencing it. Now the di=
fference between the=20

consciousness of man and of animals is that while there is a Self in the an=
imal, the animal is not=20

conscious of the Self. Spencer reasons on consciousness, but when he comes =
to a gap he merely=20

jumps over it. So again Hume, when he says that on introspection he sees me=
rely feelings and=20

can never find any "I," forgets that without an "I" no seeing of feelings w=
ould be possible. What is it=20

that studies the feelings? The animal is not conscious of the feeling "I am=
 I." It has instinct, but=20

instinct is not self-consciousness. Self- consciousness is an attribute of =
the mind, not of the soul,=20

the _anima_, whence the very name _animal_ is taken. Humanity had no self-c=
onsciousness until=20

the coming of the Manasaputras in the Third Race. Consciousness, brain-cons=
ciousness, is the=20

field of the light of the Ego, of the Auric Egg, of the Higher Manas. The c=
ells of the leg are=20

conscious, but they are the slaves of the idea; they are not self-conscious=
, they cannot originate=20

an idea, although when they are tired they can convey to the brain an uneas=
y sensation, and so=20

give rise to the idea of fatigue. Instinct is the lower state of consciousn=
ess. Man has=20

consciousness running through the four lower keys of his septenary consciou=
sness; there are=20

seven scales of consciousness in his consciousness, which is none the less =
essentially and pre-

eminently one, a unit. There are millions and millions of states of conscio=
usness, as there are=20

millions and millions of leaves; but as you cannot find two leaves alike, s=
o you cannot find two=20

states of consciousness alike; a state is never exactly repeated.  Is memor=
y a thing born in us that=20

it can give birth to the Ego? Knowledge, feeling, volition, are colleagues =
of the mind, not faculties=20

of it. Memory is an artificial thing, an adjunct of relativeness; it can be=
 sharpened or left dull, and it=20

depends on the condition of the brain-cells which store all impressions; kn=
owledge, feeling,=20

volition, cannot be correlated, do what you will. They are not produced fro=
m each other, nor=20

produced from mind, but are principles, colleagues. You cannot have knowled=
ge without memory,=20

for memory stores all  "How, cannot be? What hinders it?" exclaimed the kin=
g.  "Your majesty is=20

well aware that there is a truce between us and the English army."  "And if=
 there is a truce the=20

English army has broken it by quitting the town, contrary to the agreement =
which kept it there.=20

Now, I tell you, you must pass with me through this army across to Scotland=
, and if you refuse you=20

may choose betwixt two names, which the contempt of all honest men will bra=
nd you with--you are=20

either cowards or traitors!"  The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire; and, as =
often happens on such=20

occasions, from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans adva=
nced upon the king.=20

"Yes," said they, "we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from hi=
m who for the last=20

five-and-twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and England=
. We have promised=20

and we will keep our promise. Charles Stuart, you are our prisoner."  And b=
oth extended their=20

hands as if to seize the king, but before they could touch him with the tip=
s of their fingers, both had=20

fallen, one dead, the other stunned.  Aramis had passed his sword through t=
he body of the first=20

and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol.  Then=
, as Lord Leven and=20

the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue, which seemed t=
o come from Heaven=20

for the prince they already thought was their prisoner, Athos and Aramis dr=
agged the king from the=20

perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured, and throwing t=
hemselves on=20

horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent.  On their ro=
ad they perceived Lord=20

Winter marching at the head of his regiment. The king motioned him to accom=
pany them.     56.=20



The Avenger.   They all four entered the tent; they had no plan ready--they=
 must think of one.  The=20

king threw himself into an arm-chair. "I am lost," said he.  "No, sire," re=
plied Athos. "You are only=20

betrayed."  The king sighed deeply.  "Betrayed! yes betrayed by the Scotch,=
 amongst whom I was=20

born, whom I have always loved better than the English. Oh, traitors that y=
e are!"  "Sire," said=20

Athos, "this is not a moment for recrimination, but a time to show yourself=
 a king and a gentleman.=20

Up, sire! up! for you have here at least three men who will not betray you.=
 Ah! if we had been five!"=20

murmured Athos, thinking of D'Artagnan and=20


_
teach a child nothing, it will know nothing. Brain-consciousness depends on=
 the intensity of the=20

light shed by the Higher Manas on the Lower, and the extent of affinity bet=
ween the brain and this=20

light. Brain-mind is conditioned by the responsiveness of the brain to this=
 light; it is the field of=20

consciousness of the Manas. The animal has the Monad and the Manas latent, =
but its brain=20

cannot respond. All potentialities are there, but are dormant. There are ce=
rtain accepted errors in=20

the West which vitiate all their theories.  How many impressions can a man =
receive simultaneously=20

into his consciousness and record? The Westerns say one: Occultists say nor=
mally seven, and=20

abnormally fourteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, up to forty-nine, imp=
ressions can be=20

simultaneously received. Occultism teaches that the consciousness always re=
ceives a sevenfold=20

impression and stores it in the memory. You can prove it by striking at onc=
e the seven notes of the=20

musical scale: the seven sounds reach the consciousness simultaneously, but=
 the untrained ear=20

can only recognize them one after another, and if you choose you can measur=
e the intervals. The=20

trained ear will hear the seven notes at once, simultaneously. And experime=
nt has shown that in=20

two or three weeks a man may be trained to receive seventeen or eighteen im=
pressions of colour,=20

the intervals decreasing with practice.  Memory is acquired for this life, =
and can be expanded.=20

Genius is the greatest responsiveness of the brain and brain-memory to the =
Higher Manas.=20

Impressions on any sense are stored in the memory.  Before a physical sense=
 is  "What do you=20

say?" inquired Charles, rising.  "I say, sire, that there is now but one wa=
y open. Lord Winter=20

answers for his regiment, or at least very nearly so--we will not split str=
aws about words--let him=20

place himself at the head of his men, we will place ourselves at the side o=
f your majesty, and we=20

will mow a swath through Cromwell's army and reach Scotland."  "There is an=
other method," said=20

Aramis. "Let one of us put on the dress and mount the king's horse. Whilst =
they pursue him the=20

king might escape."  "It is good advice," said Athos, "and if the king will=
 do one of us the honor we=20

shall be truly grateful to him."  "What do you think of this counsel, Winte=
r?" asked the king, looking=20

with admiration at these two men, whose chief idea seemed to be how they co=
uld take on their=20

shoulders all the dangers that assailed him.  "I think the only chance of s=
aving your majesty has=20

just been proposed by Monsieur d'Herblay. I humbly entreat your majesty to =
choose quickly, for=20

we have not an instant to lose."  "But if I accept, it is death, or at leas=
t imprisonment, for him who=20

takes my place."  "He will have had the glory of having saved his king," cr=
ied Winter.  The king=20

looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes; undid the Order of the Sai=
nt Esprit which he wore, to=20

honor the two Frenchmen who were with him, and passed it around Winter's ne=
ck, who received=20

on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign's confidence and friendsh=
ip.  "It is right," said=20

Athos; "he has served your majesty longer than we have."  The king overhear=
d these words and=20

turned around with tears in his=20
