He told her briefly the history of the past few days.  "Tony did not take my warning seriously 

enough," he concluded with a sigh; "he ought never to have allowed his wife out of his sight." 

Marguerite had not interrupted him while he spoke. At first she just lay in his arms, quiescent and 

listening, nerving herself by a supreme effort not to utter one sigh of misery or one word of appeal. 

Then,  "That wasn't much," remarked Little Bill, innocently.  "Ay, but I soon saw something," 

continued Archie, with increasing solemnity; "I saw Kateegoose coming slinking round among the 

carts, as if he wanted not to be seen.  I saw him only for a moment--gliding past like a ghost."  "It's 

a serious thing," said Little Bill, musing gravely, "to charge a man with tryin' to kill another man, if 

that's

her knees shook under her, she sank back into a chair by the hearth and he knelt beside her with 

his arms clasped tightly round her shoulders, his cheek pressed against hers. He had no need to 

tell her that duty and friendship called, that the call of honour was once again--as it so often has 

been in the world--louder than that of love.  She understood and she knew, and he, with that 

supersensitive instinct of his, understood the heroic effort which she made.  "Your love, dear 

heart," he whispered, "will draw me back safely home as it hath so often done before. You believe 

that, do you not?"  And she had the supreme courage to murmur: "Yes!"     CHAPTER VIII  THE 

ROAD TO PORTISHEAD for you know it's a way the Red-skins have of always glidin' about as if 

they was for ever after mischief."  "But that's not all, Little Bill," returned his brother, "for I'm almost 

certain that I saw a little smoke comin' out o' the muzzle of his gun as he passed--though I couldn't 

exactly swear to it."  Archie had overrated his brother's powers in the way of advice, for, although 

they talked the matter over for some time, they failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. 

Meanwhile Okematan, having entered the camp, was met by Dechamp, and led by him to a retired 

part.  "You have an enemy here, Okematan," he said, inquiringly.  "It would seem so," returned the 

Indian gravely.

I  It was not until Bath had very obviously been left behind that Yvonne de Kernogan--Lady 

Anthony Dewhurst--realised that she had been trapped.  During the first half-hour of the journey 

her father had lain back against the cushions of the carriage with eyes closed, his face pale and 

wan as if with great suffering. Yvonne, her mind a prey to the gravest anxiety, sat beside him, 

holding his limp cold hand in hers. Once or twice she ventured on a timid question as to his health 

and he invariably murmured a feeble assurance that he felt well, only very tired and disinclined to 

talk. Anon she suggested--diffidently, for she did not mean to disturb him--that the each other's 

horses; and if the poor horse had not tossed his head when the shot was fired, his rider would 

have bit the dust."  "I fear it looks something like that," said Dechamp; "but I hope Okematan 

believes that _I_ know nothing of the matter--nor can I tell who the cowardly villain is that did it." 

"Okematan knows that," answered the Indian, sternly.  "No half-breed fired the shot."  "There is no 

Indian in the camp but Kateegoose," rejoined the other, quickly; "surely you don't think that a man 

of your own tribe would try to kill you?"  "I know not.  Kateegoose hates me.  No other man in the 

camp hates me."  "It is strange--unaccountable," returned
