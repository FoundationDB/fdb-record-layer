philodendron monstera At this spring, there is an epigram in Greek verses i=
nscribed on stone to the effect that the water is unsuitable for bathing, a=
nd also injurious to vines, because it was at this spring that Melampus cle=
ansed the daughters of Proetus of their madness by sacrificial rites, and r=
estored those maidens to their former sound state of mind. The inscription =
runs as written below:      Swain, over lengthways and crossways, as though=
 he meant to put hoops round me like a barrel; then he spent a long time no=
ting down my measurements with a thick pencil on a bit of paper, and ticked=
 off all the measurements with triangular signs. When he had finished with =
me he set to work on my tutor, Yegor Alexyevitch Pobyedimsky. My beloved tu=
tor was then at the stage when young men watch philodendron monstera At thi=

ect that the water is unsuitable for bathing, and also injurious to vines, =
because it was at this spring that Melampus cleansed the daughters of Proet=
us of their madness by sacrificial rites, and restored those maidens to the=

Swain, over lengthways and crossways, as though he meant to put hoops round=

th a thick pencil on a bit of paper, and ticked off all the measurements wi=
th triangular signs. When he had finished with me he set to work on my tuto=
r, Yegor Alexyevitch Pobyedimsky. My beloved tutor was then at the stage wh=
en young men watch _
"Water of the Styx," and no vessel, whether of silver, bronze, or iron, can=
 stand it without flying to=20

pieces and breaking up. Nothing but a mule's hoof can keep it together and =
hold it, and tradition=20

says that it was thus conveyed by Antipater through his son Iollas into the=
 province where=20

Alexander was staying, and that the king was killed by him with this water.=
  17. Among the Alps in=20

the kingdom of Cottius there is a water those who taste of which immediatel=
y fall lifeless. In the=20

Faliscan country on the Via Campana in the Campus Cornetus is a grove in wh=
ich rises a spring,=20

and there the bones of birds and of lizards and other reptiles are seen lyi=
ng.  Some springs are=20

acid, as at Lyncestus and in Italy in the Velian country, at Teano in Campa=
nia, and in many other=20

places. These when used as drinks have the power of breaking up stones in t=
he bladder, which=20

form in the human body.  18. This seems to be due to natural causes, as the=
re is a sharp and acid=20

juice contained in the soil there, which imparts a sharpness to these sprin=
gs as they issue from it;=20

and so, on entering the body, they disperse all the deposits and concretion=
s, due to the use of=20

other waters, which they find in the body. Why such things are broken up by=
 acid waters we can=20

see from the following experiments. If an egg is left for some time in vine=
gar, its shell will soften=20

and dissolve. Again, if a piece of lead, which is very flexible and heavy, =
is put in a vase and=20

vinegar poured over it, and the vase covered and sealed up, the lead will b=
e dissolved and turn=20

into white lead.  19. On the same principle, copper, which is naturally mor=
e solid, will disperse and=20

turn into verdigris if similarly treated. So, also, a brothers: one Gundaso=
v had died as a baby;=20

another had gone to the war, and he, too, was dead; the third, without offe=
nce to him be it said,=20

was an actor; the fourth...  "The fourth has risen far above us," my mother=
 brought out tearfully.=20

"My own brother, we grew up together; and I am all of a tremble, all of a t=
remble!... A privy=20

councillor with the rank of a general! How shall I meet him, my angel broth=
er? What can I, a=20

foolish, uneducated woman, talk to him about? It's fifteen years since I've=
 seen him!=20

Andryushenka," my mother turned to me, "you must rejoice, little stupid! It=
's a piece of luck for you=20

that God is sending him to us!"  After we had heard a detailed history of t=
he Gundasovs, there=20

followed a fuss and bustle in the place such as I had been accustomed to se=
e only before=20

Christmas and Easter. The sky above and the water in the river were all tha=
t escaped; everything=20

else was subjected to a merciless cleansing, scrubbing, painting. If the sk=
y had been lower and=20

smaller and the river had not flowed so swiftly, they would have scoured th=
em, too, with bath-brick=20

and rubbed them, too, with tow. Our walls were as white as snow, but they w=
ere whitewashed; the=20

floors were bright and shining, but they were washed every day. The cat Bob=
tail (as a small child I=20

had cut off a good quarter of his tail with the knife used for chopping the=
 sugar, and that was why=20

he was called Bobtail) was carried off to the kitchen and put in charge of =
Anisya; Fedka was told=20

that if any of the dogs came near the front-door "God would punish him." Bu=
t no one was so badly=20

treated as the poor sofas, easy-chairs, and rugs! They had never, before be=
en so violently beaten=20

as on this occasion in preparation=20


_
dissolve, split into pieces and dissolve when heated with fire and then spr=
inkled with vinegar.=20

Hence, since we see these things taking place before our very eyes, we can =
infer that on the same=20

principle even patients with the stone may, in the nature of things, be cur=
ed in like manner by=20

means of acid waters, on account of the sharpness of the potion.  20. Then =
there are springs in=20

which wine seems to be mingled, like the one in Paphlagonia, the water of w=
hich intoxicates those=20

who drink of the spring alone without wine. The Aequians in Italy and the t=
ribe of the Medulli in the=20

Alps have a kind of water which causes swellings in the throats of those wh=
o drink it.  21. In=20

Arcadia is the well-known town of Clitor, in whose territory is a cave with=
 running water which=20

makes people who drink of it abstemious. the sticks, and were continually f=
lying up into the sky.=20

The tailor Spiridon, the only tailor in the whole district who ventured to =
make for the gentry, came=20

over from Novostroevka. He was a hard-working capable man who did not drink=
 and was not=20

without a certain fancy and feeling for form, but yet he was an atrocious t=
ailor. His work was ruined=20

by hesitation.... The idea that his cut was not fashionable enough made him=
 alter everything half a=20

dozen times, walk all the way to the town simply to study the dandies, and =
in the end dress us in=20

suits that even a caricaturist would have called _outre_ and grotesque. We =
cut a dash in=20

impossibly narrow trousers and in such short jackets that we always felt qu=
ite abashed in the=20

presence of young ladies.  This Spiridon spent a long time taking my measur=
e. He=20
