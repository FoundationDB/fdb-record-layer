dracaena marginata leaves it and all its peaceful tasks for ever. The dramatic story of the duel with Goliath needs no second telling. His arrival at the very crisis of the war, the eager courage with which he leaves his baggage in the hands of the guard and runs down the valley to the ranks of the army, the dracaena marginata leaves it and all its peaceful tasks for ever. The dramatic story of the duel with Goliath needs no second telling. His arrival at the very crisis of the war, the eager courage with which he leaves his baggage in the hands of the guard and runs down the valley to the ranks of the army, the _
it must have been especially strong. We may therefore fairly take the tone of this song of the 

Shepherd God as expressing the characteristic of his godliness in the happy early years. In his 

solitude he was glad. One happy thought fills the spirit; one simple emotion thrills the chords of his 

harp. No doubts, or griefs, or remorse throw their shadows upon him. He is conscious of 

dependence, but he is above want and fear. He does not ask, he has--he possesses God, and is 

at rest in Him. He is satisfied with that fruition which blesseth all who hunger for God, and is the 

highest form of communion with Him. As the present has no longings, the future has no terrors. All 

the horizon is clear, all the winds are still, the ocean at rest, "and birds of peace sit brooding on the 

charmed wave." If there be foes, God holds them back. If there lie far off among the hills any 

valley of darkness, its black portals cast no gloom over him, and will not when he enters. God is 

his Shepherd, and, by another image, God is his Host. The life which in one aspect, by reason of 

its continual change, and occupation with outward things, may be compared to the journeyings of 

a flock, is in another aspect, by reason of its inward union with the stability of God, like sitting ever 

at the table which His hand has spread as for a royal banquet, where the oil of gladness glistens 

on every head, and the full cup of Divine pleasure is in every hand. For all the outward and 

pilgrimage aspect, the psalmist knows that only Goodness and Mercy--these two white-robed 

messengers of God--will follow his steps, however long may be the term of the days of his yet 

young life; for all the inward, he is sure that, in calm, unbroken fellowship, he will dwell in the 

house of God, and that when the twin angels who fed and guided him all his young life long have 

finished their charge, and the days of his journeyings are ended, there stretches beyond a still 

closer union with his heavenly Friend, which will be perfected in His true house "for ever." We look 

in vain for another example, even in David's psalms, of such perfect, restful trust in God. These 

clear notes are perhaps the purest utterance ever given of "the peace of God which passeth all 

understanding."  Such were the thoughts and hopes of the lad who kept his father's sheep at 

Bethlehem. He lived a life of lofty thoughts and lowly duties. He heard the voice of God amidst the 

silence of the backward in this century than in any former one."  "Boys!" said Broadhem, 

indignantly; "there are no boys in the 'Century;' the 'Century' is a club that meets twice a-week. I 

don't go on Sunday nights myself; but some Thursday night I will take you," and Broadhem 

plunged back into the correspondence in which I had interrupted him, while I strolled home down 

Piccadilly moralising on--the Century.  I don't frequent balls now, but I went to Bodwinkle's for a 

variety of reasons. One was, that I knew I should see everybody, and have an opportunity of 

informing the public correctly about my own affairs. Another, that I should be able to talk over 

some business matters with Bodwinkle, at a moment when he might possibly be more pliant than I 

usually found him in the City.  Every soul was at Bodwinkle's--coroneted carriages filled the 

square; a crowd of draggled men and women formed a line six or eight deep on each side of the 

awning, and between them fine ladies hurried across the pavement, encouraged and 

complimented by familiar linkmen, and very particular that the 'Morning Post' reporter, seated at a 

table in the hall, should take down their names accurately. The stairs were so crowded that 

Bodwinkle, who looked like one of his own footmen, and stood at the top of them, facing his wife, 

was red and apoplectic from pressure. His "lady," as I heard one of his City friends call her, had 

achieved the greatest object of her ambition in this life, which consisted in grinning vacantly, and 

curtsying perpetually to people she had never seen in her life before, and every one of whom 



despised her for entertaining them.  "Curious idea of the climax of earthly enjoyment," I remarked 

to Lady Veriphast, who was so tightly wedged between the banisters and a rather highly-scented 

ambassador from Central Asia, that she spoke with difficulty; "I suppose it must be a pleasure to 

be at the top of one's own ladder, like our hostess there, when so many are trying to climb it."  "Do 

_not_ philosophise in that ridiculous way; don't you see I am suffering agonies?" said Lady 

Veriphast, in a tone of suppressed anguish. "Pinch this horrid barbarian in front of me or I shall 

faint."  "Madam," I overheard a well-known voice say in a nasal tone close to me, "allow me to 

remark, that for a hand, arm, and wrist, I have not seen anything since I have been in England like 

that owned by your daughter Mary;" and Mr Wog complacently edged 


_
notes of his harp echoed the deep tones. He learned courage as well as tenderness from his daily 

tasks, and patience from the contrast between them and the high vocation which Samuel's 

mysterious anointing had opened before him. If we remember how disturbing an influence the 

consciousness of it might have wrought in a soul less filled with God, we may perhaps accept as 

probably correct the superscription which refers one sweet, simple psalm to him, and may venture 

to suppose that it expresses the contentment, undazzled by visions of coming greatness, that 

calmed his heart. "Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself 

in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I have smoothed and quieted my soul: like a 

weanling on his Mundane to that of the daughter he had eulogised, and who audibly asked 

Scraper to get between her and that horrid man.  "Just what one deserves for coming to such a 

place," said Lady Mundane furiously, who, by the way, had repeatedly asked Wog to her own 

parties.  "I have often remarked, sir," said Mr Wog, who I think overheard this observation, turning 

to me, "that the ladies in your country allow quite a singular effect to be produced in their hair. If 

you will cast your eye down the stair you will observe a young person on the landing, the parting of 

whose hair, for the space of one inch on either side, is black, while the two large bunches on her 

temples are red. That, sir, is a phenomenon I have not remarked in my own country."  "Don't you 

know how it happens?"

cxxxi.) So lying in God's arms, and content to be folded in His embrace, without seeking anything 

beyond, he is tranquil in his lowly lot.  It does not fall within our province to follow the course of the 

familiar narrative through the picturesque events that led him to fame and whose eyes twinkled 

with malice as she explained to Mr Wog that, when the hair had been thoroughly dyed it could only 

recover its natural colour by this slow process, but that usually the effect was concealed by a 

_postiche_; and she looked hard at Lady Veriphast, whose hair was 


_
which we have already referred, is remarkably brought out in his double introduction to Saul, once 

as soothing the king's gloomy spirit with the harmonies of his shepherd's harp, once as bringing 

down the boasting giant of Gath with his shepherd's sling. On the first occasion his residence in 

the palace seems to have been ended by Saul's temporary recovery. He returns to Bethlehem for 

an suspiciously _crepe_, and who wished it to be supposed that she blushed because she was 

still under the pressure of the Asiatic ambassador.  "What is the exact meaning of the term 

_postiche_?" asked Mr Wog, who observed Lady Veriphast's confusion, and whose thirst for 

information seemed to increase with his powers of making himself disagreeable; "I guess it must 

mean some kind of wig."
