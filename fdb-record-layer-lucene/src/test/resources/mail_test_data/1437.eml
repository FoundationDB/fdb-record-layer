o bore so _
empty sarcophagus in the Pyramid, where the initiatory rites took place. In=
 India and Central Asia,=20

he was bound on a lathe, and when his body had become like that of one dead=
 (entranced), he=20

was carried into the crypt. Then the Hierophant kept watch over him "guidin=
g the apparitional soul=20

(astral body) from this world of Samsara (or delusion) to the _nether_ king=
doms, from which, if=20

successful, he had the right of releasing _seven suffering souls_" (Element=
aries). Clothed with his=20

Anandamayakosha, the body of bliss--the Srotapanna remained there where we =
have no right to=20

follow him, and upon returning--received the _Word_, with or without the "h=
eart's blood" of the=20

Hierophant.(509)  Only in truth the Hierophant was never killed--neither in=
 India nor elsewhere, the=20

murder being simply feigned--unless the Initiator had chosen the Initiate f=
or his successor and had=20

decided to pass to him the last and supreme Word, after which he had to die=
--only one man in a=20

nation having the right to know that word. Many are those grand Initiates w=
ho have thus passed=20

out of the world's sight, disappearing       As mysteriously from the sight=
 of men as Moses from the=20

top of     Mount Pisgah (_Nebo_, oracular Wisdom), after he had laid his   =
  hands upon Joshua,=20

who thus became "full of the spirit of wisdom,"     _i.e._, initiated.   Bu=
t he died, he was not killed.=20

For killing, if really done, would belong to black, not to divine Magic. It=
 is the transmission of light,=20

rather than a transfer of life, of life spiritual and divine, and it is the=
 shedding of Wisdom, not of=20

blood. But the uninitiated inventors of theological Christianity took the a=
llegorical language _a la=20

lettre_; and instituted a dogma, the crude, misunderstood expression of whi=
ch horrifies and repels=20

the spiritual "heathen."  All these Hierophants and Initiates were types of=
 the Sun and of the=20

Creative Principle (spiritual potency) as were Vishvakarma and Vikarttana, =
from the origin of the=20

Mysteries. Ragon, the famous Mason, gives curious details and explanations =
with regard to the=20

Sun rites. He shows that the biblical Hiram, the great hero of Masonry (the=
 "widow's son") a type=20

taken from Osiris, is the Sun-God, the inventor of arts, and the "architect=
," the name Hiram=20

meaning the _elevated_, a title belonging to the Sun. Every Occultist knows=
 how closely related to=20

Osiris and the Pyramids are the narratives in _Kings_ concerning Solomon, h=
is Temple and its=20

construction; he knows also that the whole of the Masonic rite of Initiatio=
n is based upon the=20

Biblical allegory of the construction of that Temple, Masons conveniently f=
orgetting, or perhaps=20

ignoring, the fact that the latter narrative is modelled upon Egyptian and =
still earlier symbolisms.=20

Ragon explains it by showing that the three companions of Hiram, the "three=
 murderers," typify the=20

three last months of the year; and that Hiram stands for the Sun--from its =
summer solstice=20

downwards, when it begins decreasing--the whole rite being an astronomical =
allegory.       During=20

the summer solstice, the Sun provokes songs of gratitude     from all that =
breathes; hence Hiram,=20

who represents it, can give     to whomsoever has the right to it, the sacr=
ed Word, that is to say=20

life. When the Sun descends to the inferior signs all Nature     becomes mu=
te, and Hiram can no=20

longer give the sacred Word to the     companions, who represent the three =
inert months of the=20

year. The     first companion strikes Hiram feebly with a rule twenty-four =
    inches long, symbol of=20

the twenty-four hours which make up each     diurnal revolution; it Believe=
 me, it is only the evil-

minded who deny friendship; they cannot understand it. And Aramis?"  "I hav=
e seen him also,"=20

said D'Artagnan; "but he seemed to me cold."  "Ah, you have seen Aramis?" s=
aid Athos, turning on=20

D'Artagnan a searching look. "Why, it is a veritable pilgrimage, my dear fr=
iend, that you are making=20

to the Temple of Friendship, as the poets would say."  "Why, yes," replied =
D'Artagnan, with=20

embarrassment.  "Aramis, you know," continued Athos, "is naturally cold, an=
d then he is always=20



involved in intrigues with women."  "I believe he is at this moment in a ve=
ry complicated one," said=20

D'Artagnan.  Athos made no reply.  "He is not curious," thought D'Artagnan.=
  Athos not only failed=20

to reply, he even changed the subject of conversation.  "You see," said he,=
 calling D'Artagnan's=20

attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour'=
s walk, "we have made a=20

tour of my domains."  "All is charming and everything savors of nobility," =
replied D'Artagnan.  At=20

this instant they heard the sound of horses' feet.  "'Tis Raoul who has com=
e back," said Athos;=20

"and we can now hear how the poor child is."  In fact, the young man appear=
ed at the gate,=20

covered with dust, entered the courtyard, leaped from his horse, which he c=
onsigned to the charge=20

of a groom, and then went to greet the count and D'Artagnan.  "Monsieur," s=
aid Athos, placing his=20

hand on D'Artagnan's shoulder, "monsieur is the Chevalier D'Artagnan of who=
m you have often=20

heard me speak, Raoul."  "Monsieur," said the young man, saluting again and=
 more profoundly,=20

"monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example wheneve=
r he wished to=20

speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman."  That little compliment could=
 not fail to move=20

D'Artagnan. He extended a hand to Raoul and said:  "My young friend, all th=
e praises that are=20

given me should be passed on to the count here; for he has educated me in e=
verything and it is=20

not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions. But =
he will make it up in you I am=20

sure. I like your manner, Raoul, and your politeness has touched me."  Atho=
s was more delighted=20

than can be told. He looked at D'Artagnan with an expression of gratitude a=
nd then bestowed on=20

Raoul one of those strange smiles, of which children are so proud when they=
 receive them.=20

"Now," said D'Artagnan to himself, noticing that silent play of countenance=
, "I am sure of it."  "I=20

hope the accident has been of no consequence?"  "They don't yet know, sir, =
on account of the=20

swelling; but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured."  At this =
moment a little boy, half=20

peasant, half foot-boy, came to announce supper.  Athos led his guest into =
a dining-room of=20

moderate size, the windows of which opened on one side on a garden, on the =
other on a hot-

house full of magnificent flowers.  D'Artagnan glanced at the dinner servic=
e. The plate was=20

magnificent, old, and appertaining to the family. D'Artagnan stopped to loo=
k at a sideboard on=20

which was a superb ewer of silver.  "That workmanship is divine!" he exclai=
med.  "Yes, a chef=20

d'oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini," replied Atho=
s.  "What battle does it=20

represent?"  "That of Marignan, just at the point where one of my forefathe=
rs is offering his sword=20

to Francis I., who has broken his. It was on that occasion that my ancestor=
, Enguerrand de la=20

Fere, was made a knight of the Order of St. Michael; besides which, the kin=
g, fifteen years=20

afterward, gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen form=
erly in my house,=20

also a lovely=20


_
after the exaltation of the mighty star, feebly assails his     existence, =
giving him the first blow. The=20

second companion strikes     him with an _iron square_, symbol of the last =
season, figured by=20

the intersections of two right lines, which would divide into four     equa=
l parts the Zodiacal circle,=20

whose centre symbolises Hiram's     heart, where it touches the point of th=
e four squares=20

representing     the four seasons: second distribution of time, which at th=
at     period strikes a=20

heavier blow at the solar existence. The third     companion strikes him mo=
rtally on his forehead=20

with a heavy blow     of his mallet, whose cylindrical form symbolises the =
year, the     ring or circle:=20

third distribution of time, the accomplishment of     which deals the last =
blow to the existence of the=20

_expiring_ Sun.     From this interpretation it has been inferred that _Hir=
am_, a     _founder_ of=20

metals, the hero of the new legend with the title of     _architect_, is Os=
iris (the Sun) of modern=20

initiation; that     _Isis_, his widow, is the _Lodge_, the emblem of the E=
arth (_loka_     in Sanskrit,=20

the world) and that _Horus_, son of Osiris (or of     light) and the widow'=
s son, is the _free Mason_,=20

that is to say,     the _Initiate_ who inhabits the terrestrial lodge (_the=
 child of     the Widow, and of=20

Light_.)(510)   And here again, our friends the Jesuits have to be mentione=
d, for the above rite is=20

of their making. To give one instance of their success in throwing dust int=
o the eyes of ordinary=20

individuals to prevent their seeing the truths of Occultism, we will point =
out what they did in what is=20

now called Freemasonry.  This Brotherhood does possess a considerable porti=
on of the=20

symbolism, formulae, and ritual of Occultism, handed down from time immemor=
ial from the=20

primeval Initiations. To render this Brotherhood a mere harmless negation, =
the Jesuits sent some=20

of their most able emissaries into the Order, giants in those times," said =
Athos; "now we are=20

pigmies in comparison. Let us sit down to supper. Call Charles," he added, =
addressing the boy=20

who waited.  "My good Charles, I particularly recommend to your care Planch=
et, the laquais of=20

Monsieur D'Artagnan. He likes good wine; now you have the key of the cellar=
. He has slept a long=20

time on a hard bed, so he won't object to a soft one; take every care of hi=
m, I beg of you." Charles=20

bowed and retired.  "You think of everything," said D'Artagnan; "and I than=
k you for Planchet, my=20

dear Athos."  Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to =
be quite sure that it=20

was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed.  "That name sounds strange to yo=
u," said Athos,=20

smiling; "it was my nom de guerre when Monsieur D'Artagnan, two other galla=
nt friends and myself=20

performed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle, under the decease=
d cardinal and=20

Monsieur de Bassompierre. My friend is still so kind as to address me by th=
at old and well beloved=20

appellation, which makes my heart glad when I hear it."  "'Tis an illustrio=
us name," said the=20

lieutenant, "and had one day triumphal honors paid to it."  "What do you me=
an, sir?" inquired=20

Raoul.  "You have not forgotten St. Gervais, Athos, and the napkin which wa=
s converted into a=20

banner?" and he then related to Raoul the story of the bastion, and Raoul f=
ancied he was listening=20

to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry, so gloriously =
recounted by Tasso and=20

Ariosto.  "D'Artagnan does not tell you, Raoul," said Athos, in his turn, "=
that he was reckoned one=20

of the finest swordsmen of his time--a knuckle of iron, a wrist of steel, a=
 sure eye and a glance of=20

fire; that's what his adversary met with. He was eighteen, only three years=
 older than you are,=20

Raoul, when I saw him set to work, pitted against tried men."  "And did Mon=
sieur D'Artagnan come=20

off the conqueror?" asked the young man, with glistening eye.=20


_
lost with Hiram Abiff; and then induced them to put this belief into their =
formularies. They then=20

invented specious but spurious higher degrees, pretending to give further l=
ight upon this lost=20

secret, to lead the candidate on and amuse him with forms borrowed from  "I=
 killed one man, if I=20

recollect rightly," replied D'Artagnan, with a look of inquiry directed to =
Athos; "another I disarmed=20

or wounded, I don't remember which."  "Wounded!" said Athos; "it was a phen=
omenon of skill."=20

The young man would willingly have prolonged=20


_
containing no substance, and all artfully contrived to lead the aspiring Ne=
ophyte to nowhere. And=20

yet men of good sense and abilities, in other respects, will meet at interv=
als, and with solemn face,=20

zeal and earnestness, go through the mockery of revealing the night, but At=
hos pointed out to him=20

that his guest must need repose. D'Artagnan would fain have declared that h=
e was not fatigued,=20

but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber, conducted thither by Rao=
ul.     15. Athos as a=20

Diplomatist.   D'Artagnan=20


_
instead of the real thing.  If the reader turns to a very remarkable and ve=
ry useful work called _The=20

Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia_, Art. "Rosicrucianism," he will find its author,=
 a high and learned=20

Mason, showing what the Jesuits have done to destroy Masonry. Speaking of t=
he period when=20

heard that evening. Being naturally goodhearted, and having had once a liki=
ng for Athos, which=20

had grown into a sincere friendship, he was delighted at thus meeting a man=
 full of intelligence=20

and moral strength, instead of a drunkard. He admitted without annoyance th=
