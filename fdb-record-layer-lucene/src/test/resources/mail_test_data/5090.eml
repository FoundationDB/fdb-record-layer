"That's what."  But the bucks and the rams did not seem to be on view that =
day, and after riding=20

about all the morning the three boys stopped to rest near a spring and eat =
their lunch.  "I tell you=20

what we'll do," suggested Jack as they prepared to resume their journey. "L=
et's leave the horses=20

here and work up that mountain," and he pointed to the steep sides of a tow=
ering peak, at the foot=20

of which they had halted.  "I'm with you," agreed Nat.  "'Stoomuchwork," an=
nounced Budge as he=20

turned over on his back and began chewing some fresh gum. "I'll stay here u=
ntil you come back."=20

They tried to get him to come with them, but he would not, so Jack and Nat =
started off alone. They=20

had not gone more than a mile before Jack, who was slightly in advance, cam=
e to a sudden halt=20

and motioned to Nat to make no noise.  "There he is," whispered Jack, when =
Nat had joined him,=20

and he pointed to a distant boulder that jutted out from the side of the mo=
untain, a short distance=20

away.  Nat looked, and saw something that made the blood leap in his veins.=
 It was a big=20

mountain ram, with a massive pair of horns--a fine specimen. The animal's b=
ack was toward them,=20

and it seemed to be viewing the valley spread out below it.  "You shoot fir=
st, and if you miss I'll=20

take him," directed Jack in a whisper, wishing to give his chum the first c=
hance.  Fixing his eyes on=20

the ram, Nat brought forward his gun, cocked it, and aimed. Then for some u=
naccountable reason=20

his hand began to tremble. It was his first shot at big game, and he was ne=
rvous.  "I--I can't shoot,"=20

he whispered, lowering his rifle.  "Nonsense! You've got to," said Jack ste=
rnly, and this brought=20

Nat to himself. Once more he raised his weapon. Jack was in readiness with =
his in case his chum=20

should miss.  There was a moment of breathless suspense, and then Nat fired=
. Instantly the ram=20

wheeled about and stood facing the spot where the two lads were. He must ha=
ve seen them, for=20

the floating cloud of smoke drew his gaze.  "I've missed! You fire!" exclai=
med Nat.  And, indeed,=20

he had missed the ram cleanly. Jack threw his gun to his shoulder, and inst=
antly it cracked out.=20

"You hit him! I saw him jump!" cried Nat excitedly. "Come on! We'll get him=
!"  Without a word Jack=20

pumped another cartridge into the chamber, and fired again. But just as he =
did so the ram gave a=20

leap and disappeared from the rock.  "We've got him! We've got him!" yelled=
 Nat excitedly. "Come=20

on!"  "No use," said Jack quietly, placing a restraining hand on Nat's arm.=
  "No use? Why?"  Jack=20

pointed to a bare spot below the rock and some distance to the right. Along=
 it the ram was running=20

at full speed.  "Guess I  HONOR THY MOTHER.  It has been pointed out as wor=
thy of notice that=20

this commandment enjoins honor for _the mother_, and yet in eastern countri=
es to the present day=20

woman is held of little account. When I was in Palestine a few years ago, t=
he prettiest girl in=20

Jericho was sold by her father in exchange for a donkey. In many ancient na=
tions, just as in=20

certain parts of heathendom today, the parents are killed off as soon as th=
ey become old and=20

feeble. Can't we see the hand of God here, raising the woman to her rightfu=
l position of honor out=20

of the degradation into which she had been dragged by heathenism?  "Honor t=
hy father and thy=20

mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God givet=
h thee." I believe that=20

we must get back to the old truths. You may make light of it, and laugh at =
it, young man, but=20

remember that God has given this commandment, and you cannot set it aside. =
If we get back to=20

this law, we shall have power and blessing.  TEMPORAL BLESSING OR CURSE.  I=
 believe it to=20

be literally true that our temporal condition depends on the way we act upo=
n this commandment.=20

"Honor thy father and mother, (which is the first commandment with promise)=
, that it may be well=20

with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the earth." "Honor thy father =
and thy mother, as the=20

Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that =
it may go well with=20



thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." "Cursed is he that s=
etteth light by his father=20

or mother." "Whoso curseth his father or mother, his lamp shall be put out =
in obscure darkness." It=20

would be easy to multiply texts from the Bible to prove this truth. Experie=
nce teaches the same=20

thing. A good, loving son generally turns out better than a refractory son.=
 Obedience and respect=20

at home prepare the way for obedience to the employer, and are joined with =
other virtues that help=20

toward a prosperous career, crowned with a ripe, honored old age. Disobedie=
nce and disrespect=20

for parents are often the first steps in the downward track. Many a crimina=
l has testified that this is=20

the point where he first went astray. I have lived over sixty years, and I =
have learned one thing if I=20

have learned nothing else--that no man or woman who dishonors father or mot=
her ever prospers.=20

Young man, young woman, how do you treat your parents? Tell me that, and I =
will tell you how=20

you are going to get on in life. When I hear a young man speaking contemptu=
ously of his grey-

haired father or mother, I say he has sunk very low indeed. When I see a yo=
ung man as polite as=20

any gentleman can be when he is out in society, but who snaps up his mother=
 and=20


_
like that."  "Side-splitting sandpaper!" exclaimed Nat. "That's tough luck.=
 Why did I miss?"  "That's=20

nothing. I missed him, too. We can't hit everything we aim at, or it wouldn=
't be any fun--especially=20

for the animals."  "Let's trail him," proposed Nat.  "No, it's too late. We=
'd better get back to camp."=20

They found Budge with the horses, and the gum-chewing lad did not appear to=
 have moved, but=20

three big dead jack-rabbits at his side showed that he had not been idle.  =
"Well, you had some=20

luck," observed Jack.  "'Stooeasy--killin' them," remarked Budge. "They are=
 almost tame."  "Well,=20

they'll make good eating," observed Nat. "I hope the others did better than=
 we did."  And when=20

they were back at camp, which Long Gun, Sam and Bony reached shortly after =
they did, they=20

found that Sam had killed a fine deer, and Bony a small sheep, which gave t=
hem plenty of fresh=20

meat.  It was very dark that night, for it was cloudy, and the moon and sta=
rs were obscured.=20

Outside the circle of light from the camp fire, there was blackness so deep=
 that it seemed my=20

finger for his religion. If there is any man or woman on earth that ought t=
o be treated kindly and=20

tenderly, it is that loving mother or that loving father. If they cannot ha=
ve your regard through life,=20

what reward are they to have for all their care and anxiety? Think how they=
 loved you and=20

provided for you in your early days.  A MOTHER'S LOVE.  Let your mind go ba=
ck to the time when=20

you were ill. Did your mother neglect you? When a neighbor came in and said=
, "Now, mother, you=20

go and lie down; you have been up for a week; I will take your place for a =
night"--did she do it? No;=20

and if the poor worn body forced her to it at last, she lay watching, and i=
f she heard your voice, she=20

was at your side directly, anticipating all your wants, wiping the perspira=
tion away from your brow.=20

If you wanted water, how soon you got it! She would gladly have taken the d=
isease into her own=20

body to save you. Her love for you would drive her to any lengths. No matte=
r to what depths of=20

vice and misery you have sunk, no matter how profligate you have grown, she=
=20
