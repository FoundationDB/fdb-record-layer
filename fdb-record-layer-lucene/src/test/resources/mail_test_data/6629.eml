dracaena marginata  "Kind, merciful!" murmured Norah.  "'But how,' I asked,=
 'can we know whether she sincerely regrets her fault?' 'The surest sign of=
 true repentance,' replied my husband, 'is _amendment_. Go and question Nor=

not hear them; she did not notice how richly perfumed came the breeze from =
the hawthorn full in=20

flower; there was that on her mind which shut out surrounding objects. Brie=
fly, but as clearly and=20

truthfully as she had told her tale to Ned Franks, she now confessed all to=
 Mrs. Curtis, without=20

attempting to make the slightest excuse for her fault. Norah closed her acc=
ount with a deep sigh,=20

and stood as if awaiting with humble submission the rebuke which she knew m=
ust follow.  But Mrs.=20

Curtis uttered no word of reproach; her voice when she spoke was more kindl=
y and cheering than=20

it had been when she had first addressed Norah Peele on that bright evening=
 in May.  "I am very=20

thankful, my child, that you have made a statement so frank and truthful, o=
ne which so perfectly=20

accords with what your last mistress has written." Mrs. Curtis drew a note =
from her pocket, and=20

Norah at once recognized the familiar handwriting of Mrs. Lowndes. "Before =
speaking to you of the=20

situation in my household, I thought it well to write to London, to ascerta=
in facts from the lady=20

whom you had about an engagement, I shall believe that he doesn't care a ra=
p about Maxine de=20

Renzie."  I said no more, but leaned back against the cushions, my heart be=
ating as if it were in=20

my throat, and my brain throbbing in time with it. I could not think, or ar=
gue with myself what was=20

really right and wise to do. I could only give myself up, and drift with ci=
rcumstances.  "A man has=20

just come round the far corner," whispered Lisa. "Is it Ivor? I can't make =
out. He doesn't look our=20

way."  "Thank Heaven we're too far off for him to see our faces! I would ra=
ther die than have Ivor=20

know we're here," I broke out.  "I don't think it is Ivor," Lisa went on. "=
He's hidden himself in the=20

shadow, as if he were watching. It's _that_ house he's interested in. Who c=
an he be, if not Ivor? A=20

detective, perhaps."  "Why should a detective watch Mademoiselle de Renzie'=
s house?" I asked,=20

in spite of myself.  Lisa seemed a little confused, as if she had said some=
thing she regretted.  "I=20

don't know, I'm sure," she answered hastily. "Why, indeed? It was just a th=
ought. The man seems=20

so anxious=20


_
I must give up all idea of engaging you in my service. But I consulted the =
vicar, and he took a=20

different view of the question. 'The young girl,' he said, 'has no doubt co=
mmitted a serious fault,=20

but she may at this moment be sincerely repenting it; if so, let us give he=
r an opportunity of Di,=20

don't look out for an instant, till he's passed. Ivor is coming now. He's w=
alking in a great hurry.=20

There! he can't see you. He's far enough away for you to peep, and see for =
yourself. He's at=20

Maxine de Renzie's gate."  It was all over, then, and no more hope. His eye=
s when they gave me=20
