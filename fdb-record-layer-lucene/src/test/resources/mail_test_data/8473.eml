to-day engaged, intellectual, commercial, and mechanical, the     painstaki=
ng exactitude=20

everywhere practiced will be found to be     a growing subject of wonder an=
d admiration. The=20

secret of this     lies in the fact that perfection in any department of bu=
siness     not only enlarges=20

that business but also enriches those engaged     in it. For example: there=
 are perhaps ten times=20

as many watches     manufactured in the world to-day as at any other period=
 in its     history. It is a=20

profitable business, or men would not engage in     it, and the superhuman =
effort that is being=20

continually put     forth to increase the value, by making as perfect an ar=
ticle as     human power=20

can produce, establishes conclusively the assertion     that there is alway=
s a profit in doing well. I=20

am glad to     observe that in the cheese industry of the United States and=
     Canada, the light of=20

this truth has to some extent aroused the     slumbering dairymen. To quote=
 from the Utica Herald=20

of Sept. 11,     1883: "It is estimated that about 700,000 men are employed=
 in     this business, in=20

one capacity or another, and that about     15,000,000 cows are used to fur=
nish the one product of=20

milk. The     returns from this product are over $800,000,000. The total   =
  amount of capital=20

invested in dairying in the United States is     estimated to reach the eno=
rmous sum of=20

$2,000,000,000." In     consulting these figures we hope there is no person=
 so dense of=20

understanding as to entertain for a moment the idea that had the     old sy=
stem of every man his=20

own cheese-maker prevailed that     anything approaching this grand result =
would ever have been=20

attained. Never. The concert or effort attained in the factory     system i=
s the key note to this grand,=20

soul-inspiring chorus.      But an experience of twenty-five years in the d=
airy industry     leads me to=20

the conclusion that in the music of our business     there is yet much disc=
ord. The dairymen and=20

factorymen fail to     understand the spirit of the piece we are attempting=
 to perform,     and fail to=20

catch the idea that individual profit and prosperity     depend upon the su=
ccess of the business as=20

a whole. No chain is     stronger than its weakest link, and so long as the=
re remains a     slovenly=20

dairyman in the business just so long our system will     be incomplete and=
 the working of co-

operation remain imperfect.     Perfect concert of effort, unbroken unity o=
f hand with hand, in     all=20

the various details of the business, reaching down to the     most unimport=
ant items in the=20

production of milk and the making     of cheese, will produce in the long r=
un the most profitable and=20

permanent results to the individual as well as to the community.      "But,=
" say some, "there is too=20

much of the millennium, too much     of theory, too much of the unattainabl=
e, in all this." To such I=20

answer that there is much of the millennium, much of theory, and     much o=
f the unattainable in=20

the Sermon on the Mount, and yet our     Divine Master preached it, neverth=
eless.      It may=20

perhaps be considered chimerical and theorizing to talk     of a time when =
there will be no such=20

persons among dairymen as     what are known to the cheese-maker as a skimm=
er or stripper, but=20

we hope such a time will come, nevertheless.      To what purpose do A., B.=
, and C., and a score=20

of other     industrious, honest, painstaking fellows, exert themselves to =
    collect a model dairy,=20

sparing neither time nor expense in     providing themselves with perfect s=
ets of improved=20

appurtenances     for those dairies, from rich, well-watered pastures down =
to     good, substantial=20

three-legged milking stools, and labor     incessantly from sunrise until s=
undown, that their barns=20

may be     in perfect order and everything connected with the business neat=
     and clean, in order=20

that their material may come into the hands     of the manufacturer in a pe=
rfect condition--if=20

heedless, lazy,     shiftless, dishonest, ignorant, good-for-nothing D. kee=
ps about     him a herd of=20

sick, disconsolated racks-of-bones, to wander over     his arid and desolat=
e fields in search of food=20



and drink in     summer, or with backs humped up, hover together for shelte=
r     under the lea of a=20

wheat-straw stack, their only food in winter,     and using a kit of dairyi=
ng tools, the very best article=20

of     which is an old, water-soaked, dirty wooden pail, drawing his     wh=
ey from the factory in the=20

old, rusty, time-embattled milk     cans, in which it is allowed to stand u=
ntil the next milking,     and=20

which, after an imperfect washing, and refilled and returned     to the fac=
tory, freighted with a=20

compound sufficiently poisoned     to nullify and undo the best efforts of =
a hundred A., B., and=20

C's. It may be as the _R. dimidiata, L._ has long been familiar to the sout=
hern botanists. Whether=20

this be the _dimidiata_ found also on the sandy shores of India, or the _co=
mpressa_ of the same=20

country, as suggested by _Mr. Elliott_, or a species distinct from either, =
I am not prepared to=20

determine. But I have collected this plant in the Bermudian Isles, at Rio d=
e Janeiro, and Bahia, on=20

the Brazilian coast, and lastly on the island of Flores, near one hundred m=
iles from the mouth of=20

the Rio de la Plata, as well as on the main in the Banda Oriental.     ART.=

_of Deerfield._     _To Professor Silliman._    SIR,  Any thing which has a=
 tendency to elicit facts=20

with regard to the climate of a country must be interesting. I believe that=
 observations upon the=20

time of the germination, foliation, florification, and fructification of pl=
ants, afford a much more=20

correct criterion respecting climate than thermometrical, or other meteorol=
ogical journals. They=20

should be made at the same time in various parts of the country, and for se=
veral years in=20

succession. I send you a Calendarium Flor=C3=A6, with miscellaneous remarks=
, made in Deerfield,=20

_
the spirit of co-operation shall have driven such fellows out of     the da=
irying business, to betake=20

themselves with a pick-ax and     spade to the ditch, but that such a time =
may come ought to be=20

the earnest prayer of every thorough-going friend of     co-operation in th=
e land.      It may seem=20

like castle building and an unprofitable waste of     time to indulge in th=
eories and construct plans=20

by which the     rivalry among factorymen may be kept within a limit suffic=
iently     circumscribed to=20

prevent the fear of loss of patronage from     interfering with, and loweri=
ng the standard of, our=20

cheese. It     is too often the case, nowadays, that factorymen are deterre=
d     from a full and=20

complete discharge of their duty to themselves,     their patrons, and the =
world in general, by a=20

fear, by no means     groundless, that a bold and upright course with regar=
d to the     material=20

brought to them will result in a damaging, if not     entire loss, of their=
 occupation.      The unwise=20

extent to which men have gone in the erection of     cheese factories, has =
increased competition to=20

an extent     decidedly prejudicial to the interest of the cheese-consuming=
     world. A., having=20

invested his entire capital in the     construction and equipment of a fact=
ory, will be quite likely,=20

when B., C., and D. erect factories in his immediate     neighborhood, to h=
old his peace when=20

sundry varieties of swill     milk are offered at his door, of the country =
than has been felt for three=20
