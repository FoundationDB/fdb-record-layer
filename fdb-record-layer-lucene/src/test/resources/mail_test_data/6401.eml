on to a broad expanse of water with a windmill and a white bath-house: this=
 was Sofino, where Alehin lived.  The watermill was at work, drowning _
the cord, was made to descend. As the weight fell into the narrow limits of=
 the pipe, it naturally=20

compressed the enclosed air, and, as its fall was rapid, it forced the mass=
 of compressed air=20

through the outlet into the open air, thus producing a distinct sound by th=
e concussion.  4. Hence,=20

Ctesibius, observing that sounds and tones were produced by the contact bet=
ween the free air and=20

that which was forced from the pipe, made use of this principle in the cons=
truction of the first water=20

organs. He also devised methods of raising water, automatic contrivances, a=
nd amusing things of=20

many kinds, including among them the construction of water clocks. He began=
 by making an=20

orifice in a piece of gold, or by perforating a gem, because these substanc=
es are not worn by the=20

action of water, and do not collect dirt so as to get stopped up.  5. A reg=
ular flow of water through=20

the orifice raises an inverted bowl, called by mechanicians the "cork" or "=
drum." To this are=20

attached a rack and a revolving drum, both fitted with teeth at regular int=
ervals. These teeth, acting=20

upon one another, induce a measured revolution and movement. Other racks an=
d other drums,=20

similarly toothed and subject to the same motion, give rise by their revolu=
tion to various kinds of=20

motions, by which figures are moved, cones revolve, pebbles or eggs fall, t=
rumpets sound, and=20

other incidental effects take place.  6. The hours are marked in these cloc=
ks on a column or a=20

pilaster, and a figure emerging from the bottom points to them with a rod t=
hroughout the whole=20

day. Their decrease or increase in length with the different days and month=
s, must be adjusted by=20

inserting or withdrawing wedges. The shutoffs  "Well, you are off on anothe=
r tack now, Ivan=20

Ivanovitch," said the schoolmaster. "Let us go to sleep!"  And ten minutes =
later Burkin was asleep.=20

But Ivan Ivanovitch kept sighing and turning over from side to side; then h=
e got up, went outside=20

again, and, sitting in the doorway, lighted his pipe.      GOOSEBERRIES  TH=
E whole sky had been=20

overcast with rain-clouds from early morning; it was a still day, not hot, =
but heavy, as it is in grey=20

dull weather when the clouds have been hanging over the country for a long =
while, when one=20

expects rain and it does not come. Ivan Ivanovitch, the veterinary surgeon,=
 and Burkin, the high-

school teacher, were already tired from walking, and the fields seemed to t=
hem endless. Far=20

ahead of them they could just see the windmills of the village of Mironosit=
skoe; on the right=20

stretched a row of hillocks which disappeared in the distance behind the vi=
llage, and they both=20

knew that this was the bank of the river, that there were meadows, green wi=
llows, homesteads=20

there, and that if one stood on one of the hillocks one could see from it t=
he same vast plain,=20

telegraph-wires, and a train which in the distance looked like a crawling c=
aterpillar, and that in=20

clear weather one could even see the town. Now, in still weather, when all =
nature seemed mild=20

and dreamy, Ivan Ivanovitch and Burkin were filled with love of that countr=
yside, and both thought=20

how great, how beautiful a land it was.  "Last time we were in Prokofy's ba=
rn," said Burkin, "you=20

were about to tell me a story."  "Yes; I meant to tell you about my brother=
."  Ivan Ivanovitch heaved=20

 moment the rain began.=20

or slowly into the vessels. According to these rules, and by this mechanism=
, water clocks may be=20

constructed for use in winter.  7. But if it proves that the shortening or =

in agreement with the later heavy rain came down, covering the sky, and it =
was hard to tell when it=20

would be over. Ivan Ivanovitch and Burkin stopped in hesitation; the dogs, =
already drenched,=20

stood with their tails between their legs gazing at them feelingly.  "We mu=
st take shelter=20

somewhere," said Burkin. "Let us go to Alehin's; it's close by."  "Come alo=
ng."  They turned aside=20

and walked through mown fields, sometimes going straight forward,=20
