I should like to become rich for their sake."  "So you have a mother and a =
brother. Where do they=20

live?"  Paul told him.  "And you help support them?"  "Yes, sir."  "That's =
a good boy," said the=20

gentleman, approvingly. "Is your mother able to earn anything?"  "Not much,=
 sir. She makes shirts=20

for a Broadway store, but they only pay her twenty-five cents apiece."  "Th=
at's very small. She can=20

sew well, I suppose?"  "Oh, yes, sir; no fault is ever found with her work.=
"  "Do you think she would=20

make me a dozen shirts?"  "She would be glad to do so," said Paul, quickly,=
 for he knew that his=20

new acquaintance would pay far more liberally than the Broadway firm.  "I w=
ill give the price I=20

usually pay--ten shillings apiece."  Ten shillings in New York currency amo=
unt to a dollar and a=20

quarter, which would be five times the price Mrs Hoffman had been accustome=
d to receive. A=20

dozen shirts would come to fifteen dollars, which to a family in their circ=
umstances would be a=20

great help.  "Thank you, sir," said Paul. "My mother will accept the work t=
hankfully, and will try to=20

suit you. When shall I come for the cloth?"  "You may come to my house this=
 evening, and I will=20

give you a pattern, and an order for the materials on a dry goods dealer in=
 Broadway."  "Where do=20

you live, sir?"  "No. ---- Madison avenue, between Thirty-fourth and Thirty=
-fifth streets. My name is=20

Preston. Can you remember it?"  "Yes, sir; but I will put it down to make s=
ure."  "Well, good-

morning."  "Good-morning, sir. I suppose you don't want a tie this morning?=
"  "I don't think you=20

keep the kind I am accustomed to wear," said Mr. Preston, smiling. "I stick=
 to the old fashions, and=20

wear a stock."  The old gentleman had scarcely gone, when two boys of twelv=
e or thirteen paused=20

before the stand.  "That's a bully tie, Jeff!" said George, the elder of th=
e two. "I have a good mind=20

to buy it."  "It won't cost much," said Jeff. "Only twenty-five cents. But =
I like that one better."  "If you=20

buy one, I will."  "All right," said Jeff, whose full name was Jefferson. "=
We can wear them to=20

dancing-school this afternoon."  So the two boys bought a necktie, and this=
, in addition to previous=20

sales, made six sold during the morning.  "I hope I shall do as well as I d=
id yesterday," thought=20

Paul. "If I can make nine shillings every day I won't complain. It is bette=
r than selling prize-

packages."  Paul seemed likely to obtain his wish, since at twelve o'clock,=
 when he returned home=20

to dinner, he had sold ten ties, making rather more than half of the previo=
us day's sales.  Mrs.=20

Hoffman had been out once more, but met with no better success than before.=
 There seemed to=20

be no room anywhere for a new hand. At several places she had seen others, =
out of employment=20

like herself, who were also in quest of work. The only encouragement she re=
ceived was that=20

probably in a month or six weeks business might so far improve that she cou=
ld obtain work. But to=20

Mrs. Hoffman it was a serious matter to remain idle even four weeks. She re=
flected that Paul's=20

present employment was only temporary, and that he would be forced to give =
up his post as soon=20

as George Barry should recover his health, which probably would be within a=
 week or two. She=20

tried in vain to think of some temporary employment, and determined, in cas=
e she should be=20

unsuccessful in the afternoon, which she hardly anticipated, to consult Pau=
l what she had better=20

do.  Paul noticed when he came in that his mother looked more sober and tho=
ughtful than usual.=20

"Have you a headache, mother?" he inquired.  "No, Paul," she said, smiling =
faintly.  "Something=20

troubles you, I am sure," continued Paul.  "You are right, Paul," said Mrs.=
 Hoffman, "though I didn't=20

mean to tell you till evening."  "What is it?" asked Paul, anxiously.  "Whe=
n I carried back the last=20

shirts I made for Duncan & Co., they told me I couldn't have any more for a=
 month or six weeks."=20

"That will give you some time to rest, mother," said Paul, who wanted to ke=
ep back his good news=20

for a while.  "But I can't afford to rest, Paul."  "You forget that I am ea=
rning money, mother. I am=20



sure I can earn a dollar a day."  "I know you are a good, industrious boy, =
Paul, and I don't know=20

how we should get along without you. But it is necessary for me to do my pa=
rt, though it is small."=20

"Don't be anxious, mother; I am sure we can get along."  "But I am not will=
ing that the whole=20

burden of supporting the family should come upon you. Besides, you are not =
sure how long you=20

can retain your present employment."  "I know that, mother; but something e=
lse will be sure to turn=20

up. If I can't do anything else, I can turn bootblack, though I would prefe=
r something else. There is=20

no chance of my being out of work long."  "There are fewer things for me to=
 do," said his mother,=20

"but perhaps you can think of something. I shall go out this afternoon, and=
 try my luck once more.=20

If I do not succeed, I will consult with you this evening."  "Suppose I tel=
l you that I have work for=20

you, enough to last for two or three weeks, that will pay five times as wel=
l as the work you have=20

been doing; what would you say to that?" asked Paul, smiling.  "Are you in =
earnest, Paul?" asked=20

his mother, very much surprised.  "Quite in earnest, mother. There's a gent=
leman up-town that=20

wants a dozen shirts made, and is willing to pay ten shillings apiece."  "T=
en shillings! Why, that's a=20

dollar and a quarter."  "Of course it is. I told him I thought you would ac=
commodate him."  "You are=20

sure I can get the work to do?"  "Certainly. I am to go up to his house thi=
s evening and get the=20

pattern and an order for the materials."  "It seems too good to be true," s=
aid his mother. "Why, I=20

can earn at least a dollar a day."  "Then you will be doing as well as I am=
."  "Tell me how you=20

heard of it, Paul," said Mrs. Hoffman.  Paul told the story of the manner i=
n which he formed Mr.=20

Preston's acquaintance.  "It's lucky you ran into him, Paul," said Jimmy.  =
"He didn't think so at the=20

time," said Paul, laughing. "He said I nearly knocked the breath out of him=
."  "You won't go out this=20

afternoon, mother, will you?" asked Jimmy.  "No, it will not be necessary n=
ow; I didn't think this=20

morning that such a piece of good luck was in store for, me."    CHAPTER X =
 ANOTHER LOSS=20

After supper Paul brushed his clothes carefully and prepared to go to the a=
ddress given him by Mr.=20

Preston. He decided to walk one way, not up immortal in a new world on the =
same pattern as the=20

world that they have left.  After a wretched passage down the coast, we tou=
ched at Rio, and in the=20

Rua Direita, no doubt now called Rio Primero de Mayo or some other revoluti=
onary date, we saw a=20

Rio Grandense soldier on a fine black horse. As we were going to the River =
Plate to make our=20

fortunes, my companion asked me what such a horse was worth, and where the =
Brazilian=20

Government got their remounts.  I knew no horses of the kind were bred near=
er than Rio Grande,=20

or in Uruguay, and that a horse such as the trooper rode, might in the latt=
er country be worth an=20

ounce.  We learned in Rio that his price was eighty dollars, and immediatel=
y a golden future rose=20

before our eyes.  What could be easier than in Uruguay, which I knew well a=
nd where I had many=20

friends (now almost to a man dead in the revolutions or killed by rum), to =
buy the horses and drive=20

them overland to the Brazilian capital?  We were so confident of the soundn=
ess of our scheme that=20

I believe we counted every hour till the boat put to sea.  Not all the glor=
ies of the Tijuca with its=20

view across the bay straight into fairyland, the red-roofed town, the myria=
d islets, the tall palm-tree=20

avenue of Botafogo, the tropic trees and butterflies, and the whole wondrou=
s panorama spread at=20

our feet, contented us.  During the voyage to the River Plate we planned th=
e thing well out, and=20

talked it over with our friends.  They, being mostly of our age, found it w=
ell reasoned, and envied=20

us, they being due at banks and counting-houses, and other places where no =
chance like ours of=20

making money, could be found.  Arrived in Buenos Ayres, a cursed chance cal=
led us to Bahia=20

Blanca upon business, but though we had a journey of about a thousand miles=
 to make through=20



territory just wasted by the Indians and in which at almost every house a m=
an or two lay dead, we=20

counted it as nothing, for we well knew on our return our fortunes were ass=
ured.  And so the=20

autumn days upon the Arroyo de los Huesos seemed more glorious than autumn =
days in general,=20

even in that climate perhaps the most exhilarating of the world.  Horses we=
nt better, =E2=80=9Cmat=C3=A9=E2=80=9D was=20

hotter in the mouth, the pulperia ca=C3=B1a seemed more tolerable, and the =
=E2=80=9CChina=E2=80=9D girls looked more=20

desirable than usual, even to philosophers who had their fortunes almost as=
 good as made.  Our=20

business in the province of Buenos Ayres done, and by this time I have forg=
otten what it was, we=20

sold our horses, some of the best I ever saw in South America, for whatever=
 they would fetch, and=20

in a week found ourselves in Durazno, a little town in Uruguay, where in th=
e camps surrounding,=20

horses and mules were cheap.  About a league outside the town, and in a woo=
ded elbow of the=20

river Yi, lived our friend Don Guillermo.  I myself years before had helped=
 to build his house; and in=20

and out of season, no matter if I arrived upon a =E2=80=9Cpingo=E2=80=9D sh=
ining with silver gear, or on a =E2=80=9Cmancaron=E2=80=9D=20

with an old saddle topped by a ragged sheepskin, I was a welcome guest.  Ah=
! Don Guillermo, you=20

and your brother Don Tomas rise also through the mist of twenty years.  Cat=
holics, Scotchmen,=20

and gentlemen, kindly and hospitable, bold riders and yet so religious that=
, though it must have=20

been a purgatory to them as horsemen, they used to trudge on foot to mass o=
n Sunday, swimming=20

the Yi when it was flooded, with their clothes and missals on their heads, =
may God have pardoned=20

you.  Not that the sins of either of them could have been great, or of the =
kind but that the briefest=20

sojourn in purgatory should not have wiped them out.  To those rare Catholi=
c families in Scotland=20

an old-world flavour clings. When Knox and that =E2=80=9Clewid monk,=E2=80=
=9D the Regent Murray, all agog for=20

progress and so-called purer worship, pestered and bothered Scotland into a=
 change of faith,=20

those few who clung to Catholicism seemed to become repositories of the tra=
ditions of an older=20

world.  Heaven and hell, no resting-place for the weaker souls between, hav=
e rendered Scotland a=20

hard place for the ordinary man who wants his purgatory, even if by another=
 name.  Surely our=20

Scottish theologians had done well, although they heated up our hell like a=
 glass furnace, to leave=20

us purgatory; that is if =E2=80=9CGlesca=E2=80=9D be not purgatory enough e=
ven for those who, like North Britons,=20

have no doubt on any subject either in heaven above, or in the earth below.=
  So to the house of=20

Don Guillermo=E2=80=94even the name has now escaped me, though I see it, mu=
d-built and thatched with=20

=E2=80=9Cpaja,=E2=80=9D standing on a little sandy hill, surrounded on two =
sides by wood, on the others looking=20

straight out upon the open =E2=80=9Ccamp=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94hot foot we came.=
  Riding upon two strayed horses known as=20

=E2=80=9Cajenos,=E2=80=9D bought for a dollar each in Durazno, we arrived, =
carrying our scanty property in saddle-

bags, rode to the door, called out =E2=80=9CHail, Mary!=E2=80=9D after the =
fashion of the country and in deference to=20

the religion of our hosts, which was itself of so sincere a caste that ever=
y one attempted to=20

conform to it, as far as possible, whilst in their house; received the answ=
er =E2=80=9CWithout sin=20

conceived=E2=80=9D; got off, and straightway launched into a discussion of =
our plan.  Assembled in the=20

house were Wycherley, Harrington and Trevelyan, and other commentators, who=
se names have=20

slipped my mind.  Some were =E2=80=9Cestancieros,=E2=80=9D that is cattle o=
r sheep farmers; others again were=20

loafers, all mostly men of education, with the exception of Newfoundland Ja=
ck, a sailor, who had=20

left the navy in a hurry, after some peccadillo, but who, once in the camp,=
 took a high place=20

amongst men, by his knowledge of splicing, making turks=E2=80=99 heads, and=
 generally applying all his=20

acquired sea-lore to saddlery, and from a trick he had of forcing home his =
arguments with a short=20

knife, the handle fixed on with a raw cow=E2=80=99s tail, and which in usin=
g he threw from hand to hand,=20



and generally succeeded in burying deeply in his opponent=E2=80=99s chest. =
 Our friends all liked the=20

scheme, pronounced it practical and businesslike, and, to show goodwill, de=
spatched a boy to=20

town to bring a demijohn of ca=C3=B1a back at full speed, instructing him t=
o put it down to our account,=20

not to delay upon the way, and to be careful no one stole it at the crossin=
g of the Yi.  Long we sat=20

talking, waiting for the advent of the boy, till at last, seeing he would n=
ot come that night, and a=20

thick mist rising up from the river having warned us that the night was wea=
ring on, we=20


_
The distance was considerable, and it was nearly eight o'clock when he arri=
ved at his destination.=20

Paul found himself standing before a handsome house of brown stone. He asce=
nded the steps,=20

and inquired, on the door being opened, if Mr. Preston was at home.  "I'll =
see," said the servant.=20

She returned in a short time, and said: "He says you may come upstairs."  P=
aul followed the=20

servant, who pointed out a door at the head of the first staircase.  Paul k=
nocked, and, hearing=20

"Come in" from within, he opened the door and entered.  He found himself in=
 a spacious chamber,=20

handsomely furnished. Mr. Preston, in dressing-gown and slippers, sat befor=
e a cheerful, open=20

fire.  "Come and sit down by the fire," he said, sociably.  "Thank you, sir=
, I am warm with walking,"=20

and Paul took a seat near the door.  "I am one of the cold kind," said Mr. =
Preston, "and have a fire=20

earlier than most people. You come about the shirts, I suppose?"  "Yes, sir=
."  "Will your mother=20

undertake them?"  "With pleasure, sir. She can no longer get work from the =
shop."  "Business dull,=20

I suppose?"  "Yes, sir."  "Then I am glad I thought of giving her the commi=
ssion. How's business=20

with you to-day, eh?"  "Pretty good, sir."  "How many neckties did you sell=
?"  "Nineteen, sir."  "And=20

how much do you get for that?"  "Nine shillings and a half--a dollar and ei=
ghteen cents."  "That's=20

pretty good for a boy like you. When I was of your age I was working on a f=
arm for my board and=20

clothes."  "Were you, sir?" asked Paul, interested.  "Yes, I was bound out =
till I was twenty-one. At=20

the end of that time I was to receive a hundred dollars and a freedom suit =
to begin the world with.=20

That wasn't a very large capital, eh?"  "No, sir."  "But the death of my em=
ployer put an end to my=20

apprenticeship at the age of eighteen. I hadn't a penny of money and was th=
rown upon my own=20

resources. However, I had a pair of good strong arms, and a good stock of c=
ourage. I knew=20

considerable about farming, but I didn't like it. I thought I should like t=
rade better. So I went to the=20

village merchant, who kept a small dry-goods store, and arranged with him t=
o supply me with a=20

small stock of goods, which I undertook to sell on commission for him. His =
business was limited,=20

and having confidence in my honesty, he was quite willing to intrust me wit=
h what I wanted. So I=20

set out with my pack on my back and made a tour of the neighboring villages=
."  Paul listened with=20

eager interest. He had his own way to make, and it was very encouraging to =
find that Mr. Preston,=20

who was evidently rich and prosperous, was no better off at eighteen than h=
e was now.  "You will=20

want to know how I succeeded. Well, at first only moderately; but I think I=
 had some tact in=20

adapting myself to the different classes of persons with whom I came in con=
tact; at any rate, I was=20

always polite, and that helped me. So my sales increased, and I did a good =
thing for my employer=20

as well as myself. He would have been glad to employ me for a series of yea=
rs, but I happened to=20

meet a traveling salesman of a New York wholesale house, who offered to obt=
ain me a position=20

similar to his own. As this would give me a larger field and larger profits=
, I accepted gladly, and so=20

changed the nature of my employment. I became very successful. My salary wa=
s raised from time=20

to time, till it reached five thousand dollars. I lived frugally and saved =
money, and at length bought=20

an interest in the house by which I had been so long employed. I am now sen=
ior partner, and, as=20

you may suppose, very comfortably provided for.  "Do you know why I have to=
ld you this?" asked=20

Mr. Preston, noticing the eagerness with which Paul had listened.  "I don't=
 know, sir; but I have=20

been very much interested."  "It is because I like to give encouragement to=
 boys and young men=20

who are now situated as I used to be. I think you are a smart boy."  "Thank=
 you, sir."  "And, though=20

you are poor, you can lift yourself to prosperity, if you are willing to wo=
rk hard enough and long=20

enough."  "I am not afraid of work," said Paul, promptly.  "No, I do not be=
lieve you are. I can tell by=20



a boy's face, and you have the appearance of one who is willing to work har=
d. How long have you=20

been a street peddler?"  "About a year, sir. Before that time my father was=
 living, and I was kept at=20

school."  "You will find the street a school, though of a different kind, i=
n which you can learn=20

valuable lessons. If you can get time in the evening, however, it will be b=
est to keep up your school=20

studies."  "I am doing that now, sir."  "That is well. And now, about the s=
hirts. Did your mother say=20

how long it would take her to make them?"  "About three weeks, I think, sir=
. Will that be soon=20

enough?"  "That will do. Perhaps it will be well, however, to bring half th=
e number whenever they=20

are finished."  "All right, sir."  "I suppose your mother can cut them out =
if I send a shirt as a=20

pattern?"  "Yes, sir."  Mr. Preston rose, and, going to a bureau, took ther=
efrom a shirt which he=20

handed to Paul. He then wrote a few lines on a slip of paper, which he also=
 handed our hero.=20

"That is an order on Barclay & Co.," he explained, "for the requisite mater=
ials. If either you or your=20

mother presents it, they will be given you."  "Very good, sir," said Paul. =
 He took his cap, and=20

prepared to go.  "Good-evening, Mr. Preston," he said.  "Good-evening. I sh=
all expect you with the=20

shirts when they are ready."  Paul went downstairs and into the street, thi=
nking that Mr. Preston=20

was very sociable and agreeable. He had fancied that rich men were generall=
y "stuck up," but=20

about Mr. Preston there seemed an absence of all pretense. Paul's ambition =
was aroused when=20

he thought of the story he had heard, and he wondered whether it would be p=
ossible for him to=20

raise himself to wealth and live in as handsome a house as Mr. Preston. He =
thought what a=20

satisfaction it would be if the time should ever come when he could free hi=
s mother from the=20

necessity of work, and give little Jimmy a chance to develop his talent for=
 drawing. However, such=20

success must be a long way off, if it ever came.  He had intended to ride h=
ome, but his mind was=20

so preoccupied that he forgot all about it, and had got some distance on hi=
s way before it occurred=20

to him. Then, not feeling particularly tired, he concluded to keep on walki=
ng, as he had=20

commenced.  "It will save me six cents," he reflected, "and that is somethi=
ng. If I am ever going to=20

be a prosperous merchant, I must begin to save now."  So he kept on walking=
. Passing the=20

Cooper Institute, he came into the Bowery, a broad and busy street, the hum=
ble neighbor of=20

Broadway, to which it is nearly parallel.  He was still engaged in earnest =
thought, when he felt a=20

rude slap on the back. Looking round, he met the malicious glance of Mike D=
onovan, who=20

probably would not have ventured on such a liberty if he had not been accom=
panied by a boy a=20

head taller than himself, and, to judge from appearances, of about the same=
 character.  "What did=20

you do that for, Mike?" demanded Paul.  "None of your business. I didn't hu=
rt you, did I?" returned=20

Mike, roughly.  "No, but I don't care to be hit that way by you."  "So you'=
re putting on airs, are=20

you?"  "No, I don't do that," returned Paul; "but I don't care about having=
 anything to do with you."=20

"That's because you've got a new shirt, is it?" sneered Mike.  "It isn't mi=
ne."  "That's what I thought.=20

Who did you steal it from?"  "Do you mean to insult me, Mike Donovan?" dema=
nded Paul, angrily.=20

"Just as you like," said Mike, independently.  "If you want to know why I d=
on't want to have=20

anything to do with you, I will tell you."  "Tell ahead."  "Because you're =
a thief."  "If you say that=20

again, I'll lick you," said Mike, reddening with anger.  "It's true. You st=
ole my basket of candy the=20

other day, and that isn't the only time you've been caught stealing."  "I'l=
l give you the worst licking=20

you ever had. Do you want to fight?" said Mike, flourishing his fist.  "No,=
 I don't," said Paul. "Some=20

time when I haven't a bundle, I'll accommodate you."  "You're a coward!" sn=
eered Mike, gaining=20

courage as he saw Paul was not disposed for an encounter.  "I don't think I=
 am," said Paul, coolly.=20



"I'll hold your shirt," said Mike's companion, with a grin, "if you want to=
 fight."  Paul, however, did=20

not care to intrust the shirt to a stranger of so unprepossessing an appear=
ance.  He, therefore,=20

attempted to pass on. But Mike, encouraged by his reluctance, stepped up an=
d shook his fist=20

within an inch of Paul's nose, calling him at the same time a coward. This =
was too much for Paul's=20

self-restraint. He dropped the shirt and pitched into Mike in so scientific=
 a manner that the latter=20

was compelled to retreat, and finally to flee at the top of his speed, not =
without having first=20

received several pretty hard blows.  "I don't think he will meddle with me =
again," said Paul to=20

himself, as he pulled down the sleeves of his jacket.  He walked back, and =
looked for the shirt=20

which he had laid down before commencing the combat. But he looked in vain.=
 Nothing was to be=20

seen of the shirt or of Mike's companion. Probably both had disappeared tog=
ether.    CHAPTER XI=20

BARCLAY & CO.  The loss of the shirt was very vexatious. It was not so much=
 the value of it that=20

Paul cared for, although this was a consideration by no means to be despise=
d by one in his=20

circumstances; but it had been lent as a pattern, and without it his mother=
 would be unable to=20

make Mr. Preston's shirts. As to recovering it, he felt that there was litt=
le chance of this. Besides, it=20

would involve delay, and his mother could not afford to remain idle. Paul f=
elt decidedly=20

uncomfortable. Again Mike Donovan had done him an injury, and this time of =
a more serious=20

nature than before.  What should he do?  There seemed but one answer to thi=
s question. He must=20

go back to Mr. Preston, explain the manner in which he had lost his shirt, =
and ask him for another,=20

promising, of course, to supply the place of the one lost. He was not sure =
whether Mr. Preston=20

would accept this explanation. He might think it was only an attempt to def=
raud him. But, at any=20

rate, it seemed the only thing to do, and it must be done at once. He enter=
ed a passing car, for it=20

was too late to walk.  "I wish I had taken the car down," thought Paul. "Th=
en I shouldn't have lost=20

the shirt."  But it was too late for regrets now. He must do the best that =
remained to him.  It was=20

nearly ten o'clock when Paul once more stood before the door of Mr. Preston=
's boarding-place. He=20

rang the bell and asked to see him.  "You have been here before this evenin=
g?" said the servant.=20

"Yes."  "Then you know the room. You can walk right up."  Paul went upstair=
s and knocked at Mr.=20

Preston's room. He was bidden to come in, and did so.  Mr. Preston looked u=
p with surprise.  "I=20

suppose you are surprised to see me," said Paul, rather awkwardly.  "Why, y=
es. I did not anticipate=20

that pleasure quite so soon," said Mr. Preston, smiling.  "I am afraid it w=
on't be a pleasure, for I=20

bring bad news."  "Bad news?" repeated the gentleman, rather startled.  "Ye=
s; I have lost the shirt=20

you gave me."  "Oh, is that all?" said Mr. Preston, looking relieved. "But =
how did you lose it?"  "I=20

was walking home down the Bowery, when two fellows met me. One of them, Mik=
e Donovan,=20

forced me into a fight. I gave him a licking," added Paul, with satisfactio=
n; "but when it was all over,=20

I found the other fellow had run off with the shirt."  "I don't believe it =
will fit him," said Mr. Preston,=20

laughing.  As the speaker probably weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, it=
 was, indeed, rather=20

doubtful. Paul couldn't help laughing himself at the thought.  "You were ce=
rtainly unlucky," said Mr.=20

Preston. "Did you know the boy you fought with?"  "Yes, sir; he once before=
 stole my stock of=20

candy, when I was in the prize-package business."  "That was the day we got=
 acquainted,"=20

remarked Mr. Preston.  "Yes, sir."  "He doesn't seem to be a very particula=
r friend of yours."  "No;=20

he hates me, Mike does, though I don't know why. But I hope you won't be an=
gry with me for=20

losing the shirt?"  "No; it doesn't seem to be your fault, only your misfor=
tune."  "I was afraid you=20

might think I had made up the story, and only wanted to get an extra shirt =
from you."  "No, my=20



young friend; I have some faith in physiognomy, and you have an honest face=
. I don't believe you=20

would deceive me."  "No, I wouldn't," said Paul, promptly. "If you will tru=
st me with another shirt,=20

mother will make you an extra one to make up for the one I have lost."  "Ce=
rtainly you shall have=20

the extra shirt, but you needn't supply the place of the one lost."  "It is=
 only fair that I should."=20

"That may be, and I am glad you made the offer, but the loss is of little i=
mportance to me. It was no=20

fault of yours that you lost it, and you shall not suffer for it."  "You ar=
e very kind, sir," said Paul,=20

gratefully.  "Only just, Paul."  Mr. Preston went to the bureau, and drew o=
ut another shirt, which he=20

handed to Paul.  "Let me suggest, my young friend," he said, "that you ride=
 home this time. It is=20

late, and you might have another encounter with your friend. I should like =
to see him with the shirt=20

on," and Mr. Preston laughed heartily at the thought.  Paul decided to foll=
ow his patron's advice.=20

He had no idea of running any more risk in the matter. He accordingly walke=
d to Fourth avenue=20

and got on board the car.  It was nearly eleven o'clock when he reached hom=
e. As it was never his=20

habit to stay out late, his mother had become alarmed at his long absence. =
 "What kept you so=20

late, Paul?" she asked.  "I'll tell you, pretty soon, mother. Here's the sh=
irt that is to serve as a=20

pattern. Can you cut out the new shirts by it?"  Mrs. Hoffman examined it a=
ttentively.  "Yes," she=20

said; "there will be no difficulty about that. Mr. Preston must be a pretty=
 large man."  "Yes, he is big=20

enough for an alderman; but he is very kind and considerate, and I like him=
. You shall judge for=20

yourself when I tell you what happened this evening."  It will not be neces=
sary to tell Paul's=20

adventure over again. His mother listened with pardonable indignation again=
st Mike Donovan and=20

his companion.  "I hope you won't have anything to do with that bad boy, Pa=
ul," she said.  "I shan't,=20

if I can help it," said Paul. "I didn't want to speak to him to-night, but =
I couldn't help myself. Oh, I=20

forgot to say, when half the shirts are ready, I am to take them to Mr. Pre=
ston."  "I think I can make=20

one a day."  "There is no need of working so steadily, mother. You will be =
well paid, you know."=20

"That is true; and for that reason I shall work more cheerfully. I wish I c=
ould get paid as well for all=20

my work."  "Perhaps Mr. Preston will recommend you to his friends, and you =
can get more work=20

that way."  "I wish I could."  "I will mention it to him, when I carry back=
 the last half dozen."  "Is he=20

going to send the cloth?"  "I nearly forgot that, too. I have an order on B=
arclay & Co. for the=20

necessary amount of cloth. I can go up there to-morrow morning and get it."=
  "That will take you=20

from your work, Paul."  "Well, I can close up for a couple of hours."  "I d=
on't think that will be=20

necessary. I will go up myself and present the order, and get them to send =
it home for me."  "Will=20

they do that?"  "It is their custom. Or, if the bundle isn't too large. I c=
an bring it home myself in the=20

car."  "That's all right, then. And now, mother, as it's past eleven o'cloc=
k, I think we may as well=20

both go to bed."  The next day Paul went as usual to his business, and Mrs.=
 Hoffman, after=20

clearing away the breakfast, put on her bonnet and shawl, and prepared to g=
o for the materials for=20

the shirts.  The retail store of Barclay & Co. is of great size, and ranks =
among the most important=20

in New York. It was not so well filled when Mrs. Hoffman entered as it woul=
d be later. She was=20

directed to the proper counter, where she presented the order, signed by Mr=
. Preston. As he was a=20

customer of long standing, there was no difficulty about filling the order.=
 A bundle was made up,=20

which, as it contained the materials for twelve shirts, necessarily was of =
considerable size.  "Here=20

is your bundle, ma'am," said the clerk.  Mrs. Hoffman's strength was slende=
r, and she did not feel=20

able to carry the heavy bundle offered her. Even if she took the car, she w=
ould be obliged to carry=20

it a portion of the way, and she felt that it would overtask her strength. =
 "Don't you send bundles?"=20



she asked.  "Sometimes," said the clerk, looking saddles on the floor, and =
went to sleep.  At=20

daybreak, cold and miserable, the boy appeared, bringing the ca=C3=B1a in a=
 demijohn, and to our=20

questions said he had passed the river, hit the =E2=80=9Crincon,=E2=80=9D a=
nd heard the dogs bark in the mist; but=20

after trying for an hour could never find the house.  Then, thinking that h=
is horse might know the=20

way, laid down the reins, and the horse took him straight to the other hors=
es, who, being startled=20

at the sudden apparition of their friend saddled and mounted in the dead of=
 night, vanished like=20

spectres into the thickest of the fog. Then tired of riding, after an hour =
or two, took off his saddle,=20

and had passed the night, as it appeared at daybreak, not a quarter of a mi=
le away.  Between the=20

town and Don Guillermo=E2=80=99s house there ran a river called the Yi; jus=
t at the pass a =E2=80=9Cbalsa=E2=80=9D plied,=20

drawn over by stout ropes.  On either side the =E2=80=9Cpass=E2=80=9D stood=
 pulperias, that is camp-stores, where=20

gin and sardines, Vino Carlon, Yerba, and all the necessaries of frontier l=
ife could be procured.=20

Horses and cattle, mules and troops of sheep passed all the day, and gamble=
rs plied their trade,=20

whilst in some huts girls, known as =E2=80=9CChinas,=E2=80=9D watched the p=
assers-by, loitering in deshabille before=20

their mare=E2=80=99s hide doors, singing =E2=80=9Ccielitos,=E2=80=9D or the=
 =E2=80=9Cgato,=E2=80=9D to the accompaniment of a guitar, or=20

merely shouting to the stranger, =E2=80=9CChe, si quieres cosa buena vente =
por ac=C3=A1.=E2=80=9D  A half-Arcadian,=20

half-Corinthian place the crossing was; fights there were frequent, and a =
=E2=80=9CGuapeton,=E2=80=9D that is, a=20

pretty handler of his knife, once kept things lively for a month or two, ch=
allenging all the passers-by=20

to fight, till luckily a Brazilian, going to the town, put things in order =
with an iron-handled whip.  The=20

owner of the =E2=80=9Cbalsa,=E2=80=9D one Eduardo Pe=C3=B1a, cherished a ha=
lf-romantic, half-antagonistic friendship for=20

Don Guillermo, speaking of him as =E2=80=9Cmuy Catolico,=E2=80=9D admiring =
his fine seat upon a horse, and yet=20

not understanding in the least the qualities which made him a man of mark i=
n all the =E2=80=9Cpagos=E2=80=9D from=20

the Porongos to the Arazati.  =E2=80=9CCatolico,=E2=80=9D with Pe=C3=B1a, w=
as but a matter of pure faith, and going to=20

mass a work of supererogation; and conduct such as the eschewal of the Chin=
a ladies at the pass,=20

with abstinence from all excess in square-faced gin, dislike to mont=C3=A9,=
 even with =E2=80=9CSota en la=20

puerta,=E2=80=9D and the adversary with all his money staked upon another c=
ard, seemed to him bigotry;=20

for bigotry is after all not so much mere excess of faith or want of tolera=
nce, but a neglect to fall=20

into the vices of our friends.  So, mounted on our two =E2=80=9Cagenos,=E2=
=80=9D one a jibber, the other a kicker at=20

the stirrup, and extremely hard to mount, we scoured the land.  Gauchos, Br=
azilians, negroes,=20

troperos, cattle-farmers, each man in the whole =E2=80=9Cpago=E2=80=9D had =
at least a horse to sell.  Singly, driven,=20

led, pulled unwillingly along in raw-hide ropes, and sitting back like lapd=
ogs walking in the park,=20

the horses came.  We bought them all after much bargaining, and then began =
to hunt about at=20

farms, estancias, and potreros, and to inquire on every side where horses c=
ould be got.  All the=20

=E2=80=9Cdead beats,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Csancochos,=E2=80=9D buck-jumpers, wa=
ll-eyed and broken-backed, we passed in a review.=20

An English sailor rode up to the place, dressed as a Gaucho, speaking but l=
ittle English, with a=20

west-country twang.  He, too, had horses, which we bought, and the deal ove=
r, launched into the=20

story of his life.  It seemed that he had left a man-of-war some fifteen ye=
ars ago, married a native=20

girl and settled down, and for ten years had never met an Englishman.  In E=
nglish, still a sailor, but=20

in Spanish, a gentleman, courteous and civil, and fit to take his place wit=
h any one; full of fine=20

compliments, and yet a horse-coper; selling us three good horses, and one, =
that the first time I=20

mounted him kicked like a zebra, although our friend had warranted him quit=
e free from vice, well=20

bitted, and the one horse he had which he reserved in general for the saddl=
e of his wife.  In a few=20

days we had collected sixty or seventy, and to make all complete, a man arr=
ived, saying that=20



specially on our account, thirteen wild horses, or horses that had run wild=
, had been enclosed.  He=20

offered them on special terms, and we, saddling at once, rode twelve or thi=
rteen leagues to see=20

them; and after crossing a river, wading through a swamp, and winding in an=
d out through a thick=20

wood for several miles, we reached his house.  There, in a strong corral, t=
he horses were, wild-

eyed and furious, tails sweeping to the ground, manes to their knees, sweat=
ing with fear, and=20

trembling if any one came near.  One was a piebald dun, about eight years o=
f age, curly all over=20

like a poodle; one Pampa, that is, black with a head as if it had been pain=
ted white to the ears;=20

behind them, coal-black down to his feet, which, curiously enough, were all=
 four white.  A third,=20

Overo Azulejo, slate-coloured and white; he was of special interest, for he=
 had twisted in his mane=20

a large iron spur, and underneath a lump as large as an apple, where the sp=
ur had bumped upon=20

his neck for years during his gallop through the woods and plains.  Each ho=
rse had some=20

peculiarity, most had been tame at one time, and were therefore more to be =
dreaded than if they=20

had been never mounted in their lives.  As it was late when we arrived we t=
ied our horses up and=20

found a ball in progress at the house.  Braulio Islas was the owner=E2=80=
=99s name, a man of some position=20

in the land, young and unmarried, and having passed some years of his life =
in Monte Video,=20

where, as is usual, he had become a doctor either of law or medicine; but t=
he life had not allured=20

him, and he had drifted back to the country, where he lived, half as a Gauc=
ho, half as a=20

=E2=80=9CDotorcito,=E2=80=9D riding a wild horse as he were part of him, an=
d yet having a few old books, quoting dog=20

Latin, and in the interim studying international law, after the fashion of =
the semi-educated in the=20

River Plate.  Fastening our horses to long twisted green-hide ropes, we pas=
sed into the house.=20

=E2=80=9CCarne con cuero=E2=80=9D (meat cooked with the hide) was roasting =
near the front-door on a great fire of=20

bones.  Around it men sat drinking mat=C3=A9, smoking and talking, whilst t=
ame ostriches peered into=20

the fire and snapped up anything within their reach; dogs without hair, loo=
king like pigs, ran to and=20

fro, horses were tied to every post, fire-flies darted about the trees; and=
, above all, the notes, sung=20

in a high falsetto voice of a most lamentable Paraguayan =E2=80=9Ctriste,=
=E2=80=9D quavered in the night air and set=20

the dogs a-barking, when all the company at stated intervals took up the re=
frain, and chanted=20

hoarsely or shrilly of the hardships passed by Lopez in his great camp at P=
iray=C3=BA.  Under the straw-

thatched sheds whole cows and sheep were hung up; and every one, when he fe=
lt hungry, cut a=20

collop off and cooked it in the embers, for in those days meat had no price=
, and if you came up=20

hungry to a house a man would say: =E2=80=9CThere is a lazo, and the cattle=
 are feeding in a hollow half a=20

league away.=E2=80=9D  A harp, two cracked guitars, the strings repaired wi=
th strips of hide, and an=20

accordion, comprised the band.  The girls sat in a row, upon rush-seated ch=
airs, and on the walls=20

were ranged either great bowls of grease in which wicks floated, or homemad=
e candles fixed on to=20

nails, which left them free to gutter on the dancers=E2=80=99 heads.  The m=
en lounged at the door, booted=20

and spurred, and now and then one walked up to the girls, selected one, and=
 silently began to=20

dance a Spanish valse, slowly and scarcely moving from the place, the hands=
 stretched out in=20

front, and the girl with her head upon his shoulder, eyes fast closed and l=
ooking like a person in a=20

trance.  And as they danced the musicians broke into a harsh, wild song, th=
e dancers=E2=80=99 spurs=20

rattled and jingled on the floor, and through the unglazed and open windows=
 a shrill fierce neigh=20

floated into the room from the wild horses shut in the corral.  =E2=80=9CDu=
lces,=E2=80=9D that is, those sweetmeats=20

made from the yolk of eggs, from almonds, and from nuts, and flavoured with=
 cinnamon and=20

caraways brought by the Moors to Spain, and taken by the Spaniards to the I=
ndies, with sticky=20



cakes, and vino seco circulated amongst the female guests.  The men drank g=
in, ate bread (a=20

delicacy in the far-off =E2=80=9Ccamp=E2=80=9D), or sipped their mat=C3=A9,=
 which, in its little gourds and silver tube, gave=20

them the appearance of smoking some strange kind of pipe.  =E2=80=9CQue bai=
len los Ingleses,=E2=80=9D and we=20

had to acquit ourselves as best we could, dancing a =E2=80=9Cpericon,=E2=80=
=9D as we imagined it, waving our=20

handkerchiefs about to the delight of all the lookers-on.  Fashion decreed =
that, the dance over, the=20

=E2=80=9Ccavalier=E2=80=9D presented his handkerchief to the girl with whom=
 he danced.  I having a bad cold saw=20

with regret my new silk handkerchief pass to the hand of a mulatto girl, an=
d having asked her for=20

her own as a remembrance of her beauty and herself, received a home-made co=
tton cloth, stiff as=20

a piece of leather, and with meshes like a sack.  Leaving the dance, as Bra=
ulio Islas said, as more=20

=E2=80=9Cconformable=E2=80=9D to Gauchos than to serious men we started bar=
gaining.  After much talking we=20

agreed to take the horses for three dollars each, upon condition that in th=
e morning Islas and all=20

his men should help us drive a league or two upon the road.  This settled, =
and the money duly=20

paid, we went to bed, that is, lay down upon our saddles under the =E2=80=
=9Cgalpon.=E2=80=9D  To early morning the=20

guitars went on, and rising just about day-break we found the revellers sad=
dling their horses to=20

depart in peace.  We learned with pleasure there had been no fight, and the=
n after a mat=C3=A9 walked=20

down to the corral.  Knowing it was impossible to drive the horses singly, =
after much labour we=20

coupled them in twos.  I mounted one of them, and to my surprise, he did no=
t buck, but after three=20

or four plunges went quietly, and we let the others out.  The bars were sca=
rcely down when they=20

all scattered, and made off into the woods.  Luckily all the drivers were a=
t hand, and after three or=20

four hours=E2=80=99 hard galloping we got them back, all except one who nev=
er reappeared; and late in the=20

evening reached Don Guillermo=E2=80=99s house and let our horses into a pad=
dock fenced with strong=20

posts of =C3=B1andubay or Tala and bound together with pieces of raw hide. =
 So for a week or two we=20

passed our lives, collecting horses of every shade and hue, wild, tame and =
bagualon, that is,=20

neither quite wild nor tame, and then, before starting, had to go to =E2=80=
=9CLa Justicia=E2=80=9D to get a passport=20

with their attributes and marks.  I found the Alcalde, one Quintin Perez, s=
itting at his door,=20

softening a piece of hide by beating on it with a heavy mallet of =C3=B1and=
ubay.  He could not read, but=20

was so far advanced towards culture as to be able to sign his name and rubr=
icate.  His rubric was=20

most elaborate, and he informed me that a signature was good, but that he t=
hought a rubric more=20

authentic.  Though he could not decipher the document I brought for signatu=
re, he scrutinized the=20

horses=E2=80=99 marks, all neatly painted in the margin, discussed each one=
 of them, and found out=20

instantly some were from distant =E2=80=9Cpagos,=E2=80=9D and on this accou=
nt, before the signature or rubric was=20

appended, in addition to the usual fee, I was obliged to =E2=80=9Cspeak a l=
ittle English to him,=E2=80=9D which in the=20

River Plate is used to signify the taking and receiving of that conscience =
money which causes the=20

affairs of justice to move pleasantly for all concerned.  Meanwhile my part=
ner had gone to town=20

(Durazno) to arrange about the revision of the passport with the chief auth=
orities.  Nothing moved=20

quickly at that time in Uruguay; so after waiting one or two days in town, =
without a word, he quietly=20

let loose his horse in a by-street at night to save his keep, and casting a=
bout where he should=20

leave his saddle, thought that the cloak-room of the railway-station might =
be safe, because the=20

station-master was an Englishman.  The saddle, having silver stirrups and g=
ood saddle-cloths and=20

silver-mounted reins and bit, was worth more than the horse, which, being a=
 stray, he had bought=20

for a couple of dollars, and was not anxious to retain.  After a day or two=
 of talk, and =E2=80=9Cspeaking=20

English,=E2=80=9D he wanted his saddle, and going to the station found it g=
one.  Not being up at that time in=20



the ways of the Republic, he informed the police, waited a day, then two da=
ys, and found nothing=20

done.  Luckily, just at that time, I came to town and asked him if he had o=
ffered a reward.  Hearing=20

he had not, we went down to see the Commissary of Police, and found him sit=
ting in his office=20

training two cocks to fight.  A rustle and the slamming of a door just mark=
ed the hurried exit of a=20

lady, who must have been assisting at the main.  Compliments duly passed, c=
igarettes lighted and=20

mat=C3=A9 circulating, =E2=80=9Cserved=E2=80=9D by a negro soldier in a rag=
ged uniform with iron spurs upon his naked=20

feet who stood attention every time he passed the gourd in which the mat=C3=
=A9 is contained to either of=20

us, we plunged into our talk.  =E2=80=9CTen dollars, Comissario.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CNo, se=C3=B1or, fifteen, and a slight=20

gratification to the man who brings the saddle back.=E2=80=9D  We settled a=
t thirteen, and then the=20

Commissary winked slowly, and saying, =E2=80=9CThis is not Europe,=E2=80=9D=
 asked for a little something for=20

himself, received it, and calling to the negro, said=E2=80=94  =E2=80=9CTio=
 Gancho, get at once to horse, take with=20

you one or two men, and scour the =E2=80=98pago=E2=80=99 till you bring thi=
s saddle back.  See that you find it, or I=20

will have your thumbs both broken as your toes are, by San Edovige and by t=
he Mother of our=20

Lord.=E2=80=9D  A look at Tio Gancho showed both his big toes had been brok=
en when a slave in Brazil,=20

either to stop him walking, or, as the Commissary thought, to help him to c=
atch the stirrup, for he=20

was a noted rider of a redomon. {20}  Duly next day the saddle was brought =
(so said the=20

Commissary) into the light of justice, and it then appeared one of the silv=
er stirrups had been lost.=20

The Commissary was much annoyed, reproached his men, being, as he said he w=
as: =E2=80=9CUn hombre=20

muy honrado.=E2=80=9D  After thinking the case well out, he returned me two=
 and a half dollars out of the=20

thirteen I had agreed to pay.  Honour no doubt was satisfied upon both side=
s, and a new silver=20

stirrup cost ten dollars at the least; but as the saddle was well worth six=
ty, we parted friends.  That=20

is, we should have parted so had not the =E2=80=9CHombre muy honrado=E2=80=
=9D had another card to play.  =E2=80=9CHow=20

long do you want the thief detained?=E2=80=9D he asked.  And we, thinking t=
o be magnanimous and to=20

impress him with our liberal ideas, said loftily=E2=80=94  =E2=80=9CA month=
 will do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll right,=E2=80=9D he answered, =E2=80=9Cthen=
 I=20

must trouble you for thirty dollars more for the man=E2=80=99s maintenance,=
 and for the gaoler=E2=80=99s fee.=E2=80=9D  This=20

was a stopper over all, and I said instantly=E2=80=94  =E2=80=9CBeing ignor=
ant of your laws, perhaps we have=20

looked at the man=E2=80=99s offence too hardly, a week will do.=E2=80=9D  S=
o after paying five dollars down, we=20

invited the Commissary to drink, and left him well knowing that we should n=
ot be out of sight=20

before the man would be released, and the five dollars be applied strictly =
towards the up-keep of=20

=E2=80=9Cjustice=E2=80=9D in the Partido of the Yi.  Months afterwards I he=
ard the culprit worked two days cutting=20

down weeds with a machete in the public square; then, tired of it, being =
=E2=80=9Cun hombre de =C3=A1 caballo,=E2=80=9D=20

had volunteered to join the army, was received into the ranks, and in a few=
 weeks=E2=80=99 time rose to be=20

sergeant, for he could sign his name.  All being ready, and some men (one a=
 young Frenchman=20

born in the place) being found with difficulty, the usual revolution having=
 drained off the able-

bodied men, we made all ready for the start.  We bid good-bye to Don Guille=
rmo, and to Don=20

Tomas, giving them as an addition to their library (which consisted of some=
 lives of saints and an=20

odd volume of =E2=80=9Cel culto al Falo,=E2=80=9D which was in much request=
), our only book the =E2=80=9CFeathered Arrow,=E2=80=9D=20

either by Aimard or by Gerstaeker, and mounting early in the morning after =
some trouble with the=20

wilder of our beasts, we took the road.  For the first few leagues Don Guil=
lermo rode with us, and=20

then, after a smoke, bade us goodbye and rode away; his tall, lithe figure =
dressed in loose black=20

merino trousers tucked into his boots, hat tied beneath his chin, and Pampa=
 poncho, fading out of=20

sight, and by degrees the motion of his right arm touching his horse up, Ga=
ucho fashion, at every=20



step, grew slower, then stood still, and lastly vanished with the swaying f=
igure of the rider, out of=20

sight.  Upon what Pampa he now gallops is to me unknown, or whether, where =
he is, horses=20

accompany him; but I would fain believe=20


_
of the poor widow, and mentally deciding that she was not entitled to much =
consideration. Had she=20

been richly dressed, he would have been very obsequious, and insisted on se=
nding home the=20

smallest parcel. But there are many who have two rules of conduct, one for =
the rich, and quite a=20

different one for the poor, and among these was the clerk who was attending=
 upon Mrs. Hoffman.=20

"Then," said Mrs. Hoffman, "I should like to have you send this."  "It's a =
great deal of trouble to=20

send everything," said the clerk, impertinently.  "This bundle is too heavy=
 for me to carry," said the=20

widow, deprecatingly.  "I suppose we can send it," said the clerk, ill-natu=
redly, "if you insist upon=20

it."  Meanwhile, though he had not observed it, his employer had approached=
, and heard the last=20

part of the colloquy. He was considered by some as a hard man, but there wa=
s one thing he=20

always required of those in his employ; that was to treat all purchasers wi=
th uniform courtesy,=20

whatever their circumstances.  "Are you objecting to sending this lady's bu=
ndle?" said Mr. Barclay,=20

sternly.  The clerk looked up in confusion.  "I told her we would send it,"=
 he stammered.  "I have=20

heard what passed. You have been deficient in politeness. If this happens a=
gain, you leave my=20

employ."  "I will take your address," see him as he disappeared that day sw=
aying to every motion=20

of his horse as they had been one flesh.  =E2=80=9CAdios, Don Guillermo,=E2=
=80=9D or perhaps =E2=80=9Chasta luego,=E2=80=9D you=20

and your brother Don Tomas, your hospitable shanty, and your three large ca=
ts, =E2=80=9CYanish=E2=80=9D and=20

=E2=80=9CYanquetruz,=E2=80=9D with one whose name I cannot now recall, are =
with me often as I think on times=20

gone by; and still to-day (if it yet stands), upon the darkest night I coul=
d take horse outside=20

Durazno, cross the Yi, not by the =E2=80=9Cbalsa,=E2=80=9D but at the ford =
below, and ride without a word to any one=20

straight to your house.  Days followed one another, and nights still caught=
 us upon horseback,=20

driving or rounding up our horses, and nothing interested us but that =E2=
=80=9Cel Pangare=E2=80=9D was lame; =E2=80=9Cel=20

Gargantillo=E2=80=9D looked a little thin, or that =E2=80=9Cel Zaino de la =
hacinda=E2=80=9D was missing in the morning from the=20

troop.  Rivers we passed, the Paso de los Toros, where the horses grouped t=
ogether on a little=20

beach of stones refused to face the stream.  Then sending out a yoke of oxe=
n to swim first, we=20

pressed on them, and made them plunge, and kept dead silence, whilst a nake=
d man upon the=20

other bank called to them and whistled in a minor key; for horses swimming,=
 so the Gauchos say,=20

see nothing, and head straight for a voice if it calls soothingly.  And whi=
lst they swam, men=20


_
Mrs. Hoffman gave it, and left the store, thankful for the interference of =
the great merchant who=20

had given his clerk a lesson which the latter, as he valued his situation, =
found it advisable to bear=20

in mind.    CHAPTER XII  THE BARREL THIEF  While Mike Donovan was engaged i=
n his contest=20

with Paul, his companion had quietly walked off with the shirt. It mattered=
 very little to him which=20

party conquered, as long as he carried off the spoils. His conduct in the p=
remises was quite as=20

unsatisfactory to Mike as it was to Paul. When Mike found himself in danger=
 of being=20

overpowered, he appealed to his companion for assistance, and was incensed =
to see him coolly=20

disregarding the appeal, and selfishly appropriating the booty.  "The mane =
thafe!" he exclaimed=20

after the fight was over, and he was compelled to retreat. "He let me be ba=
te, and wouldn't lift his=20

finger to help me. I'd like to put a head on him, I would."  Just at that m=
oment Mike felt quite as=20

angry with his friend, Jerry McGaverty, as with his late opponent.  "The sh=
irt's mine, fair," he said=20

to himself, "and I'll make Jerry give it to me."  But Jerry had disappeared=
, and Mike didn't know=20

where to look for him. In fact, he had entered a dark alleyway, and, taking=
 the shirt from the paper=20

in which it was wrapped, proceeded to examine his prize.  The unusual size =
struck him.  "By the=20

powers," he muttered, "it's big enough for me great-grandfather and all dri=
fting, and others=20

swimming by their side splashed water in their faces if they tried to turn.=
  The sun beat on the=20

waste calling out the scent of flowers; kingfishers fluttered on the water=
=E2=80=99s edge, herons stood=20

motionless, great vultures circled overhead, and all went well till, at the=
 middle of the stream, a=20

favourite grey roan mare put up her head and snorted, beat the water with h=
er feet, and then sank=20

slowly, standing quite upright as she disappeared.  Mountains and plains we=
 passed, and rivers=20

fringed with thick, hard thorny woods; we sweltered in the sun, sat shiveri=
ng on our horses during=20

the watches of the night, slept fitfully by turns at the camp fire, ate =E2=
=80=9Ccharqui=E2=80=9D and drank mat=C3=A9, and=20

by degrees passing the Paso de los Novillos, San Fructuoso, and the foot-hi=
lls of Haedo and the=20

Cuchilla de Peralta with its twin pulperias, we emerged on to the plain, wh=
ich, broken here and=20

there by rivers, slopes toward the southern frontier of Brazil.  But as we =
had been short-handed=20

from the first, our =E2=80=9Ccaballada=E2=80=9D had got into bad ways.  A n=
othing startled them, and the malign=20

example of the group of wildlings brought from Braulio Islas, led them astr=
ay, and once or twice=20

they separated and gave us hours of work to bring them back.  Now as a =E2=
=80=9Ccaballada=E2=80=9D which has=20

once bolted is in the future easily disposed to run, we gave strict orders =
no one was to get off,=20

though for a moment, without hobbling his horse.=20


_
make it. But I'll wear it, anyway."  Jerry was not particular as to an exac=
t fit. His nether garments=20

were several sizes too large for him, and the shirt would complete his cost=
ume appropriately. He=20

certainly did need a new shirt, for the one he had on was the only article =
of the kind he possessed,=20

and was so far gone that its best days, if it ever had any, appeared to dat=
e back to a remote=20

antiquity. It had been bought cheap in Baxter street, its previous history =
being unknown.  Jerry=20

decided to make the change at once. The alley afforded a convenient place f=
or making the=20

transfer. He accordingly pulled off the ragged shirt he wore and put on the=
 article he had purloined=20

from Paul. The sleeves were too long, but he turned up the cuffs, and the a=
mple body he tucked=20

inside his pants.  "It round a fire, cooking some sausages, flavoured with =
Chile pepper, over a fire=20

of leaves, one of our men who had been on horseback watching all the night,=
 drew near the fire,=20

and getting off, fastened his reins to a heavy-handled whip, and squatted o=
n them, as he tried to=20

warm his hands. My horse, unsaddled, was fastened by a lasso to a heavy sto=
ne, and luckily my=20

partner and the rest all had their horses well secured, for a =E2=80=9Ccoat=
i=E2=80=9D dived with a splash after a fish=20

into the river.  In a moment the horses all took fright, and separating, da=
shed to the open country=20

with heads and tails erect, snorting and kicking, and left us looking in de=
spair, whilst the horse with=20

the whip fastened to the reins joined them, and mine, tied to the stone, pl=
unged furiously, but gave=20

me time to catch him,=20


_
the exchange. "I could let out the half of it, and have enough left for mes=
elf. Anyhow, it's clane,=20

and it came chape enough."  He came out of the alley, leaving his old shirt=
 behind him. Even if it=20

had been worth carrying away, Jerry saw no use in possessing more than one =
shirt. It was his=20

habit to wear one until it was ready to drop off from him, and then get ano=
ther if he could. There is=20

a practical convenience in this arrangement, though there are also objectio=
ns which will readily=20

occur to the reader.  On the whole, though the shirt fitted him too much, a=
s he expressed it, he=20

regarded himself complacently. about nightfall brought the =E2=80=9Ccaballa=
da=E2=80=9D back to the camp, and=20

driving them into an elbow of the river, lighted great fires across the mou=
th of it, and went to sleep,=20

taking it conscientiously in turns to curse the man who let his horse escap=
e.  Five leagues or so=20

upon the road the frontier lay, and here the Brazilian Government had guard=
s, but we being=20

business men smuggled our horses over in the night, led by a noted smuggler=
, who took us by=20

devious paths, through a thick wood, to a ford known to him, only just prac=
ticable, and this we=20

passed swimming and wading, and struggling through the mud.  The river woun=
d=20
