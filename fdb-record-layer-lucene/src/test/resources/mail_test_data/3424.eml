Durant collided as they were about to tackle the Jefferson captain and the =
result was a twenty-

yard gain which placed the ball again within the shadow of the Ridgley goal=
 posts. Straight line=20

plunges in which all of the Jefferson backs shared brought the ball to the =
Ridgley five-yard line for=20

first down. Here the team that represented the school on the hill made a st=
and for three downs, but=20

on the fourth attempt Norris, unexpectedly trying the end when a line plung=
e was anticipated,=20

gained across the Ridgley goal line and brought the score to 13.  "Make it =
a lucky number," Teeny-

bits heard the Jefferson captain say to Whipple who was preparing to kick t=
he goal.  The Jefferson=20

player followed the instructions of his captain to the letter,--and the man=
 at the Scoreboard put up=20

the number 14.  Certain weak spirits in the Ridgley stands now looked at ea=
ch other with faces=20

which showed plainly that hope had fled from them, that they now knew that =
the Jefferson menace=20

which had been built up week after week by rumor and also by fact, as repre=
sented in scores, was=20

real,--that the purple team was invincible, that Ridgley had met the irresi=
stible force and could not=20

by any alchemy of spirit turn defeat into victory.  Old football players, b=
e considered as specific.=20

The Copper-belly is a very distinct species. If the _S. cupreus_ is, notwit=
hstanding the above=20

observations, considered a distinct species, it would gratify those who cul=
tivate natural history, to=20

have some good discriminative characters of it.  Much has been said and wri=
tten about antidotes=20

to the venomous bites of snakes, and Mr. Rafinesque enumerates over again s=
everal plants which=20

have been said to be, and which he appears to believe to be specifics. If t=
he case was my own, I=20

would be very unwilling to rely upon either of the 20 or 30 medicinal plant=
s, dubiously mentioned=20

by the late Professor Barton, as reputed antidotes for this poison. It woul=
d be more prudent to=20

resort unhesitatingly to a more certain remedy, in the ligature, and immedi=
ate excision of the part,=20

where such an operation was practicable, or to cauterization, if the part c=
ould not be removed by=20

the knife.  In conversation with Professor Cooper upon this subject, he inf=
ormed me that in his=20

domestic medical practice he applied common chalk to the wounds occasioned =
by the stings of=20

hymenopterous insects. That in consequence of this mode of treatment, the p=
ain was immediately=20

allayed, and the consequent inflammation and intumescence were=20


_
down admiringly on the finely-polished team-work of the Jefferson eleven an=
d said to themselves=20

that this was _good football_ judged by _any_ standard.  A few minutes afte=
r the kick-off following=20

the second score of the Jefferson team, the quarter came to an end and the =
teams exchanged=20

goals. In the short rest period Neil Durant gathered his players about him =
and said a few things=20

that every member of the eleven long remembered.  "Is there any one here," =
he asked, "who=20

hasn't _more_ fight in him than he has shown yet?"  No answer.  "We've just=
 _begun_ this game=20

and we haven't had our chance to show them what we can do when we carry the=
 ball. We're going=20

to _hold_ them first and then we're going to _show_ them something they've =
never learned."  They=20

were commonplace words, but they came from the bottom of Neil Durant's hear=
t and were=20

delivered in such a manner that every member of the team gained fresh confi=
dence and put back=20

out of the realm of his thoughts the growing fear of defeat.  The ball was =
in Jefferson's possession=20

at the middle of the field. On the very next play the purple left-half fumb=
led, and Neil Durant=20

swooped down on the bouncing ball like a hawk on a sparrow.  The error seem=
ed to "rattle" the=20

Jefferson team. Dean called for an end run by Neil Durant and the captain r=
esponded by dashing=20

forward result was induced by the supposition that the venomous liquid migh=
t be an acid, which=20

opinion was, in some degree, justified by the event.[34] Upon the same neut=
ralizing principle it=20

must be supposed that any alkali would be beneficial. The learned Professor=
 supposed, that the=20

venom of the poisonous reptilia may, in like manner, be an acid secretion, =
and recommends this to=20

be ascertained by experiments upon the liquid itself.  If this inference pr=
oves correct, the same=20

alkaline remedy may be employed to neutralize, or so modified as to stimula=
te, in case, as is=20

supposed by some, the poison produces upon the system a typhoid action.  An=
 instance however=20

is related in the Trans. Royal Soc. of Lond. of the unsuccessful administra=
tion of the vol. alkali in=20

case of the bite of a Rattle-snake; and an intelligent physician of Georgia=
 informed me, that he had=20

applied the same stimulant in vain for the cure of the bites of poisonous s=
nakes, but that being=20

once stung by a Scorpion, he was instantaneously relieved by the topical us=
e of this liquid. He=20

further related to me a cure performed under his observation, by means of t=
he singular antidote,=20

which has often been resorted to in case of snake bites, that of the applic=
ation of a living domestic=20

fowl or other bird directly to the wound; three fowls were applied in this=
=20


_
fifteen-yard gain. Stillson then added five, and Teeny-bits, who was called=
 upon to carry the ball=20

for the first time, wriggled and dodged through the Jefferson team to the f=
ifteen-yard line before he=20

was stopped. In an attempt to surprise the enemy, Dean called upon Teeny-bi=
ts again, but this=20

time the half-back was stopped almost before he was under way. Stillson, wh=
o carried the ball=20

next, did better and reached the ten-yard line. Neil Durant then made a lin=
e plunge through an=20

opening that the reliable Tom Curwood created and planted the oval five yar=
ds from the goal line=20

for a first down. Jefferson made a strong stand, but in four tries the Ridg=
ley team advanced the=20

ball until it rested a few inches over that last white line, the crossing o=
f which spelled a score.  The=20

old-timers in the stands now settled into comfortable positions and said to=
 each other: "This _is_ a=20

game!"  Neil Durant's trusty toe sent the ball between the uprights and the=
 game stood 14 to 7.=20

Through the rest of the second quarter the red team and the purple a few mi=
nutes, it was=20

supposed, by the poison extracted from the wound. This account, from an obs=
ervant medical=20

professor, (who may nevertheless have been deceived) acquires some addition=
al title to=20

consideration by a similar event which lately occurred at Schooley's Mounta=
in, New-Jersey. We=20

are informed from a respectable source, that a boy was there bitten by a Co=
pper-head, (Scytale=20

mockeson.)[35] The part was immediately painful, became swollen and inflame=
d, and the sufferer=20

had every appearance of having received a dangerous wound. A portion of the=
 breast of a fowl=20

was denudated of feathers, and applied to the wound; in a few minutes the f=
owl died, without=20

having experienced any apparent violence or injurious pressure, from the ha=
nd of the applicant,=20

the breast exhibiting a livid appearance. Another living fowl was then laid=
 open by the knife, and=20

the interior of the body placed upon the wound. The wound was subsequently =
scarified, and=20

variously administered to. The boy however recovered, and his cure was gene=
rally attributed, at=20


_
to break the defense of the other and when the whistle sounded for the clos=
e of the first half they=20

were fighting on equal terms in the center of the field.  While the stands =
were singing their songs=20

and exchanging cheers between the halves the two teams rested in the locker=
 building and=20

listened to what their respective coaches had to say.  Coach Murray made hi=
s remarks short and=20

to the point. He was entirely satisfied with the way the team had been play=
ing; he knew that they=20

could win. He warned them to watch Norris on every play and at the same tim=
e to beware of the=20

Jefferson half-backs, who had proved their ability to carry the ball. He on=
ce more repeated one as=20

any one from relying implicitly upon this mode of treatment, and would only=
 resort to it when the=20

part bitten could not be extirpated, and when a cautery was not at hand. Ye=
t it must be confessed,=20

that from the numerous attestations to its efficacy we should be almost led=
 to suppose a very=20

strong affinity to exist between the venom and the animal thus applied.  Th=
at so numerous a=20

catalogue of plants have gained credit with the uninformed as specifics, wi=
ll not be surprising,=20

when we know that the reservoir of the venom is very readily exhausted and =
slowly replenished.=20

When this reservoir is vacated, the reptile is of course innoxious, and the=
 most inert plant=20
