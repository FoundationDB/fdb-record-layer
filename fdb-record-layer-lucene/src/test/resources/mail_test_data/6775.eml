come to measure and dig and conjecture, the artist, the poet, the lover of nature will find many 

other things to allure. The sportsman will also come here, especially the angler, who finds 

excellent trout, though the fish are not often large. Perhaps happily, only the few main roads are 

available for motor traffic, but during the summer these are much frequented; there are also many 

excursion cars and chars-a-bancs to the more popular beauty-spots, starting from places like 

Moreton, Chagford, Bovey Tracey, or coming from towns far beyond the moor borders. The cyclist 

who does not mind dismounting at times has a wider area, and cycling on Dartmoor is not so bad 

as its reputation. There are some really fine stretches of road; what the rider needs is 

discrimination and good brakes. But he who truly wins the freedom of the moors is the pedestrian--

a species not quite extinct, though discredited and often discomforted. He should come here on 

what we may call the divine adventure, the quest of beauty; and even on lonely Dartmoor he will 

find the human touch not absent.    [Illustration: A DARTMOOR STREAM]  Whoever comes, if his 

eyes be open, will see tracts of primitive mother earth, untamed and unsophisticated. He will see 

what Devon was before it was cultivated; he will be in a haunt of strange traditions, lingering 

superstitions, wild fancies. Perhaps when cold clammy fogs blot out the undulations and tors, a 

chill will strike to the heart; Dartmoor is no kindly nurse to those who have lost their way or those 

who are overtaken by snowfall. He who comes here must lean on his own resources; he will not 

be pampered and guided; he must fend for himself. Nature, as Jefferies was fond of saying, does 

not care for man; he is an alien, exiled by the very civilization of which he is so proud; he can do 

less for himself than the birds and beasts. Yet the illusion that nature does care is at times very 

strong; we cannot thrust it wholly from our hearts, and if we regard the earth as but the outward 

symbol, a mood, a thought, of some inscrutable power, we are not wrong in deeming that she 

responds to our deepest impulses and cravings. It is glorious poetry and it need not be bad 

philosophy to dream of a Being "whose dwelling is the light of setting suns"; and he who has seen 

a sunset flaming across Dartmoor has seen the heavens opened. He can learn also the 

insignificance of any single individual or race, and yet the undying importance of each if all are a 

part of the Godhead. Peoples have lived and died here long centuries since, leaving no memorial 

but grey stones; but the heather and ling with the stars.  On such a night the wide and vacant 

spaces can readily become peopled; phantoms issue from the shadows of the woods and grow 

white in the open; an unknown wind may arise, bringing with it strange singing from the northern 

seas. And if he forgot the immediate purpose of the verses that he wanted; if he forgot that he 

must not mention the name of Meenie; if he saw only the little cottage, and the moonlit loch, and 

the giant bulk of Clebrig that was keeping guard over the sleeping hamlet, and watching that no 

sprites or spectres should work their evil charms within reach of Meenie's half-listening ear--well, it 

was all a fire in his blood and his brain, and he could not stay to consider.  The phantom-world 

was revealed; the silence now was filled as with a cry from the lone seas of the far north; and, all 

impatient and eager and half bewildered, he seemed to press forward to seize those visions and 

that weird music ere both should vanish and be mute:--  _The moonlight lies on Loch Naver,_ 

_And the night is strange and still;_ _And the stars are twinkling coldly_   _Above the Clebrig hill._ 

_And there by the side of the water,_   _O what strange shapes are these!_ _O these are the wild 

witch-maidens_   _Down from the northern seas._  _And they stand in a magic circle,_   _Pale in 

the moonlight sheen;_ _And each has over her forehead_   _A star of golden green._  _O what is 



their song?--of sailors_   _That never again shall sail;_ _And the music sounds like the sobbing_ 

_And sighing that brings a gale._  _But who is she who comes yonder?--_   _And all in white is 

she;_ _And her eyes are open, but nothing_   _Of the outward world can she see._  _O haste you 

back, Meenie, haste you,_   _And haste to your bed again;_ _For these are the wild witch-

maidens_   _Down from the northern main._  _They open the magic circle;_   _They draw her into 

the ring;_ _They kneel before her, and slowly_   _A strange, sad song they sing--_  _A strange, 

sad song--as of sailors_   _That never again shall sail;_ _And the music sounds like the sobbing_ 

_And sighing that brings a gale._  _O haste you back, Meenie, haste you,_   _And haste to your 

bed again;_ _For these are the wild witch-maidens_   _Down from the northern main._  _'O come 

with us, rose-white Meenie,_   _To our sea-halls draped with green:_ _O come with us, rose-white 

Meenie,_   _And be our rose-white queen!_  _'And you shall have robes of splendour,_   _With 

shells and pearls bestrewn;_ _And a sceptre olden and golden,_   _And a rose-white coral 

throne._  _'And by day you will hear the music_   _Of the ocean come

still wonderful, the gorse runs in patches of gold, the rivers sing perpetually among their lichen-

stained boulders, and the soul of beauty that is ever mysterious is undying.  Such is Dartmoor, one 

of the few remaining tracts of uncultivated England; a region not easy to tame, offering small 

reward to the farmer, but rich repayment to the lovers of beauty, wildness, antiquity. There is 

nothing quite like it elsewhere, unless it be the Bodmin Moors of Cornwall, _And by night you will 

see your palace_   _Ablaze with phosphor fire._  _'O come with us, rose-white Meenie,_   _To our 

sea-halls draped with green;_ _O come with us, rose-white Meenie,_   _And be our rose-white 

queen!'_  _But Clebrig heard; and the thunder_   _Down from his iron hand sped;_ _And the band 

of the wild witch-maidens_   _One swift shriek uttered, and fled._  _And Meenie awoke, and 

terror_   _And wonder were in her eyes;_ _And she looked at the

There is loveliness of a different sort on the moors of Yorkshire and around the Peak--on the 

Wiltshire, Dorset, and Sussex Downs, on the high lands or in the New Forest of Hampshire, and at 

spots like Hindhead in Surrey. There is still a different beauty in the fen country and the land of the 

Broads. But Dartmoor has its own character, which it does not surrender to a casual acquaintance; 

it has a reserve and depth of individuality, to be won only by slow confidence. There are strong 

characteristics also among the moor folk; but here a change has been in progress. It is useless to 

come now expecting to find a superstitious and credulous peasantry. When a district is haunted by 

tourist and artist, when cars and brakes unload crowds of chattering sightseers, something of the 

outside world comes with them; and modernism has other more subtle avenues of approach. The 

cheap daily paper penetrates to these solitudes, and brings with it other things that are cheap. It 

may leave its readers still credulous and still ignorant; but the nature of the ignorance and the 

credulity have altered--and perhaps not wholly for the better. There is loss as well as gain. The old 

traditions have passed   _And she looked to the starlit skies._  _O haste you back, Meenie, haste 

you,_   _And haste to your bed again;_ _For these are the wild witch-maidens_   _Down from the 

northern main._  _O hear you not yet their singing_   _Come faintly back on the breeze?--_ _The 

song of the wild witch-sisters_   _As they fly to the Iceland seas._  _O hark--'tis a sound like the 

sobbing_   _And sighing that brings a gale:_ _A low, sad song--as of sailors_   _That never again 

shall sail!_   Slowly he pulled in to the shore again, and fastened up the boat; and slowly he 

walked away through the silent and moonlit landscape, revolving these verses in his mind, but not 

trying in the least to estimate their value, supposing them to have any at all.  Even when he had 

got home, and in the stillness of his own room--for by this time Maggie had gone to bed--was 

writing out the lines, with apparent ease enough, on a large sheet of paper, it was with no kind of 

critical doubt or anxiety.  He could not have written them otherwise; probably he knew he was not 

likely to make them any better by over-refining them.  And the reason why he put them down on 

the large sheet of paper was that Meenie's name occurred in

of the people to the guidebooks. Pixies and wish-hounds and spells are now usually only 

mentioned in jest where they were formerly whispered of in grim earnest. But the beauty of the 

moorland changes not, and it is its beauty that is our real concern. We can spare the traditions 

while the loveliness remains.       End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dartmoor, by Arthur L. to 

appear in her album; he would fold the sheet of paper and place it in the book, and she could let it 

remain there or burn it as she chose. And then he went and had his supper, which Maggie had left 

warm by the fire, and thereafter lit a pipe--or rather two or three pipes, as it befel, for this was the 

last night before his leaving Inver-Mudal, and there were many dreams
