ornamental, and some of the women are much disfigured by such marks upon th=
eir arms and=20

backs; even the men, without exception, are scarified upon their cheeks. Th=
e inhabitants of=20

Kordofan and Darfur, who are generally prized as slaves, are invariably mar=
ked, not only with=20

simple scars, but by cicatrices raised high above the natural surface by me=
ans of salt rubbed into=20

the wounds; these unsightly deformities are considered to be great personal=
 attractions. The Arab=20

women are full of absurd superstitions; should a woman be in an interesting=
 condition, she will=20

creep under the body of a strong camel, believing that the act of passing b=
etween the fore and=20

hind legs will endue her child with the strength of the animal. Young infan=
ts are scored with a razor=20

longitudinally down the back and abdomen, to improve their constitutions.  =
I engaged six strong=20

Tokrooris--natives of Darfur--who agreed to accompany me for five months. T=
hese people are a=20

tribe of Mahometan negroes, of whom I shall speak more hereafter; they are =
generally very=20

powerful and courageous, and I preferred a few men of this race to a party =
entirely composed of=20

Arabs. Our great difficulty was to procure a slave woman to grind the corn =
and to make the bread=20

for the people. No proprietor would let his slave on hire to go upon such a=
 journey, and it was=20

impossible to start without one; the only resource was to purchase the free=
dom of some woman,=20

and to engage her as a servant for the trip. Even this was difficult, as sl=
aves were scarce and in=20

great demand: however, at last I heard of a man who had a Galla slave who w=
as clever at making=20

bread, as it had been her duty to make cakes for sale in the bazaar upon ma=
rket days. After some=20

delays I succeeded in obtaining an interview with both the master and slave=
 at the same time; the=20

former was an Arab, hard at dealing, but, as I did not wish to drive a barg=
ain, I agreed to the price,=20

thirty-five dollars, 7l. The name of the woman was Barrake; she was about t=
wenty-two years of=20

age, brown in complexion, fat, and strong; rather tall, and altogether she =
was a fine powerful-

looking woman, but decidedly not pretty; her hair was elaborately dressed i=
n hundreds of long=20

narrow curls, so thickly smeared with castor oil that the grease had covere=
d her naked shoulders;=20

in addition to this, as she had been recently under the hands of the hairdr=
esser, there was an=20

amount of fat and other nastiness upon her head that gave her the appearanc=
e of being nearly=20

grey.  I now counted out thirty-five dollars, which I placed in two piles u=
pon the table, and through=20

the medium of Mahomet I explained to her that she was no longer a slave, as=
 that sum had=20

purchased her freedom; at the same time, as it was a large amount that I ha=
d paid, I expected she=20

would remain with us as a servant until our journey should be over, at whic=
h time she should=20

receive a certain sum in money, as wages at the usual rate. Mahomet did not=
 agree with this style=20

of address to a slave, therefore he slightly altered it in the translation,=
 which I at once detected.=20

The woman looked frightened and uneasy at the conclusion; I immediately ask=
ed Mahomet what=20

he had told her. "Same like master tell to me!" replied the indignant Mahom=
et. "Then have the=20

kindness to repeat to me in English what you said to her;" I replied. "I te=
ll that slave woman same=20

like master's word; I tell her master one very good master, she Barrake one=
 very bad woman; all=20

that good dollars master pay, too much money for such a bad woman. Now she'=
s master's slave;=20

she belong to master like a dog; if she not make plenty of good bread, work=
 hard all day, early=20

morning, late in night, master take a big stick, break her head."  This was=
 the substance of a=20

translation of my address tinged with Mahomet's colouring, as being more ad=
apted for the ears of=20

a slave!I My wife was present, and being much annoyed, we both assured the =
woman that=20

Mahomet was wrong, and I insisted upon his explaining to her literally that=
 "no Englishman could=20



hold a slave; that the money I had paid rendered her entirely free; that sh=
e would not even be=20

compelled to remain with us, but she could do as she thought proper; that b=
oth her mistress and I=20

should be exceedingly kind to her, and we would subsequently find her a goo=
d situation in Cairo;=20

ranslate literally. The=20

effect was magical; the woman, who had looked frightened and unhappy, sudde=
nly beamed with=20

smiles, and without any warning she ran towards me, and in an instant I fou=
nd myself embraced in=20

her loving arms; she pressed me to her bosom, and smothered me with castor =
oily kisses, while=20

her greasy ringlets hung upon my face and neck. How long this entertainment=
 would have lasted I=20

cannot tell, but I was obliged to cry "Caffa! Caffa!" (enough! enough!) as =
it looked improper, and=20

the perfumery was too rich; fortunately my wife was present, but she did no=
t appear to enjoy it=20

more than I did; my snow-white blouse was soiled and greasy, and for the re=
st of the day I was a=20

disagreeable compound of smells, castor oil, tallow, musk, sandal-wood, bur=
nt shells, and=20

Barrake.  Mahomet and Barrake herself, I believe, were the only people who =
really enjoyed this=20

little event. "Ha!" Mahomet exclaimed, "this is your own fault! You insiste=
d upon speaking kindly,=20

and telling her that she is not a slave, now she thinks that she is one of =
your WIVES!" This was the=20

real fact; the unfortunate Barrake had deceived herself; never having been =
free, she could not=20

understand the use of freedom unless she was to be a wife. She had understo=
od my little address=20

as a proposal, and of course she was disappointed; but, as an action for br=
each of promise cannot=20

be pressed in the Soudan, poor Barrake, although free, had not the happy ri=
ghts of a free-born=20
