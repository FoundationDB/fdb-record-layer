or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any 

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  Section 2. Information about the 

Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of 

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, 

middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and 

donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 

with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring 

that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 

2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and 

permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the 

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see 

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org    Section 3. 

Information about the Project in the Pocket without Inconvenience. We are to use this by boiling 

about a Pint of Water, and pouring it upon a piece of the Glue or Cake, of the bigness of a small 

Walnut, and stirring it with a Spoon till the Cake dissolves, which will make very strong good Broth. 

As for the Seasoning Part, every one may add Pepper and Salt as they please, for there must be 

nothing of that kind put among the Veal when we make the Glue, for any thing of that sort would 

make it mouldy. Some of this sort of Cake-Gravey has lately been sold, as I am inform'd, at some 

of the Taverns near _Temple-Bar_, where, I suppose, it may now be had. As I have observ'd 

above, that there is nothing of Seasoning in this Soup, so there may be always added what we 

desire, either of Spices or Herbs, to make it savoury to the Palate; but it must be noted, that all the 

Herbs that are used on this occasion, must be boiled tender in plain Water, and that Water must 

be used to pour upon the Cake Gravey instead of simple Water: so may a Dish of good Soup be 

made without trouble, only allowing the Proportion of Cake-Gravey answering to the abovesaid 

Direction. Or if Gravey be wanted for

Person of Honour, that upon this Foundation, there has been made a Cake-Gravey of Beef, which 

for high Sauces and strong Stomachs, is still of good use; and therefore I shall here give the 

Method of it.    To make Cake-Soup of Beef, &c.  Take a Leg, or what they call in some Places a 

Shin of Beef, prepare it as prescribed above for the Leg of Veal, and use the muscular Parts only, 

as directed in the foregoing Receipt; do every thing as abovemention'd, and you will have a Beef-

Glue, which, for Sauces, may be more desirable in a Country-House, as Beef is of the strongest 

nature of any Flesh. Some prescribe to add to the Flesh of the Leg of Beef, the Flesh of two old 

Hares, and of old Cocks to strengthen it the more; this may be done at pleasure, but the 

Foundation of all these Cake Graveys or Glues is the first. These indeed are good for Soups and 

Sauces, and may be enrich'd by Cellary,
