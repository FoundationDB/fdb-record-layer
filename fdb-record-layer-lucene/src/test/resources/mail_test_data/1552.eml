philodendron monstera we're following him."  "Shall we show ourselves?" Dan=
 demanded.  "No need to yet, Dan. The minute we do, he'll either defy us or=
 start to run. We'll just keep him in sight until Mr. Hatfield catches up."=
  "Sure, that's what he told us to do," Midge said nervously. "No telling h=
ow the kid may react." then, ag'in, they can be too mean."  That night, whi=
le grandmother was getting supper, we opened the package Mrs. Shimerda had =
given her. It was full of little brown chips that looked like the shavings =
of some root. They were as light as feathers, and the most noticeable thing=
 about them was their philodendron monstera we're following him."  "Shall w=

 Hatfield catches up."  "Sure, that's what he told us to do," Midge said ne=

"Why, you conceited--" Red began, but Dan checked him with a hard kick in t=
he ankle.  "Maybe we=20

are sort of dumb," Brad said, falling in with Jack's mood. "You're probably=
 right, we don't know=20

what's going on around here. That's because we're not on the scene much of =
the time. You're=20

roaming the woods and the marsh every day. I suppose you've seen things we =
haven't."  "You're=20

darn right I have," Jack boasted. "I could tell you something about that bl=
ack dress, if I had a mind=20

to! What's more, I could tell you about the money box--"  The boy broke off=
, suddenly aware that=20

he was talking entirely too much.  "What about the money box?" Mr. Hatfield=
 asked quietly.  Jack,=20

however, started off through the woods.  "Wait!" Dan called after him.  Jac=
k turned around, but his=20

eyes were unfriendly and defiant.  "You won't get anything out of me!" he t=
aunted the Cubs. "I=20

could tell you a lot if I wanted to. But I won't! I'm not forgetting that i=
t was the Cubs who took me=20

back to the Child Study Institute!"                                    CHAP=

Log   Jack Phillip's hint that he was in possession of vital information re=
lative to the missing money=20

box amazed the Cubs.  Even Mr. Hatfield was so taken by surprise that for t=
he moment he made=20

no attempt to detain the boy.  "Say, are we going to let him get away again=
?" Brad demanded. "He=20

knows what became of that money box!"  "He took it himself, that's why!" mu=
ttered Chips. "Who=20

does he think he is, anyhow? Someone that doesn't have to obey the law?"  "=
Jack does have a=20

few things to explain," Mr. Hatfield said quietly. "Now, take it easy, boys=
. He'll not elude us."  "He's=20

heading for the road now!" Red said excitedly. "If we don't the spring; he =
and Ambrosch had=20

already split the logs for it, but the logs were all buried in the snow, al=
ong the creek where they=20

had been felled.  While grandmother encouraged and gave them advice, I sat =
down on the floor=20

with Yulka and let her show me her kitten. Marek slid cautiously toward us =
and began to exhibit his=20

webbed fingers. I knew he wanted to make his queer noises for me--to bark l=
ike a dog or whinny=20

like a horse,--but he did not dare in the presence of his elders. Marek was=
 always trying to be=20

agreeable, poor fellow, as if he had it on his mind that he must make up fo=
r his deficiencies.  Mrs.=20

Shimerda grew more calm and reasonable before our visit was over, and, whil=
e Antonia=20

translated, put in a word now and then on her own account. The woman had a =
quick ear, and=20

caught up phrases whenever she heard English spoken. As we rose to go, she =
opened her=20

wooden chest and brought out a bag made of bed-ticking, about as long as a =
flour sack and half=20

as wide, stuffed full of something. At sight of it, the crazy boy began to =
smack his lips. When Mrs.=20

Shimerda opened the bag and stirred the contents with her hand, it gave out=
 a salty, earthy smell,=20

very pungent, even among the other odors of that cave. She measured a teacu=
p full, tied it up in a=20

bit of sacking, and presented it ceremoniously to grandmother.  "For cook,"=
 she announced. "Little=20

now; be very much when cook," spreading out her hands as if to indicate tha=
t the pint would swell=20

to a gallon. "Very good. You no have in this country. All things for eat be=
tter in my country."=20

"Maybe so, Mrs. Shimerda," grandmother said drily. "I can't say but I prefe=
r our bread to yours,=20

myself."    [Illustration: Mrs. Shimerda gathering mushrooms in a Bohemian=

him quick, he'll slip away and we may never see him again!"  "We'll head hi=
m off," the Cub leader=20

replied, undisturbed. "Brad, you and Dan and Midge start through the hollow=
 which is shorter than=20

the path he's taken. The rest of us will come up from the rear."  "Sure!" B=
rad said eagerly. "We'll=20

get him!"  "Just circle in and don't use any force. In fact, don't try to h=
old him until I get there. He=20

has a rifle, you know. It may or may not be loaded, but we're taking no cha=
nces."  "We'll be=20

Antonia undertook to explain. "This very good, Mrs. Burden,"--she clasped h=
er hands as if she=20

could not express how good,--"it make very much when you cook, like what my=
 mama say. Cook=20

with rabbit, cook with chicken, in the gravy,--oh, so good!"  All the way h=
ome grandmother and=20

Jake talked about how easily good Christian people could forget they were t=
heir brothers' keepers.=20

Dan.  At a fast lope, the three boys followed the low ground. For a conside=
rable distance they=20

were unable to see the boy they pursued.  However, as they came presently t=
o a rise of ground,=20

they glimpsed him off to the right not far from the main road.  "He's takin=
g it easy," Brad said in=20

relief. "I guess and most of all in horse-sense. Nobody can give 'em that, =
I guess. Jimmy, here, is=20

about as able to take over a homestead as they are. Do you reckon that boy =
Ambrosch has any=20

real push in him?"  "He's a worker, all right, mam, and he's got some ketch=
-on about him; but he's=20

a mean one. Folks can be mean=20
