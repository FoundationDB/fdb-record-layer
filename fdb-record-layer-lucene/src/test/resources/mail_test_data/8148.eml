philodendron monstera  "The mystery! The mystery!" cried Jack, tossing an armful of light wood on the embers.  The fire blazed up at once, and Jack looked upward. He saw a great shape hovering over the camp, a shape that tamed and hath been tamed by mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

watch at night, and we'll begin right away."  They agreed that this was a good plan, and the night 

was divided into six watches, one for each of the lads, as Long Gun positively refused to have 

anything to do with seeking a solution of the mystery. Some light wood was collected and piled 

near the camp fire, in readiness to throw on, so as to produce a bright blaze the moment the queer 

noise was heard in the air overhead.  But that night passed without incident, and so did the three 

following. During the day the boys went hunting in the forest, or fishing asked him--"Why hath 

Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Ghost?" Satan is the father of lies and the promoter of 

lies:  FOR GOOD OR EVIL.  The tongue can be an instrument of untold good or incalculable evil. 

Some one has said that a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant 

use. "Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. . . . They have 

sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. . . . The mouth of a 

righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. . . . A wholesome 

tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in

Shoshone River, having fairly good luck both on land and in the water.  It was about a week after 

Jack's plan of keeping night watches had been in effect, that something happened. He had about 

given up hearing the noise again, and was about ready to propose that the next day they should 

go on a trip over the mountain.  It was Jack's watch, and he was sitting by the camp fire, thinking 

of his father, his aunts and matters at home, and, it said that the tongues of busybodies are like 

the tails of Samson's foxes--they carry firebrands and are enough to set the whole field of the 

world in a flame. "Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths that they may obey us; and we turn 

about their whole body. Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of 

fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

a certain brown-eyed girl.  "I must take a trip over to Pryor's Gap and see her," he said softly to 

himself.  The fire was burning low, and Jack arose to put on some more wood. As he did so he 

heard a vibration in the air, not far above the camp. Then came what seemed to be a whirr of 

wings and a great things. Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a 

world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth 

on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and
