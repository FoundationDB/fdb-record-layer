"Accounts of outrages committed _
the master of the house, with a deadly sort of intentness.  "I don't want you to do that," I quavered, 

wondering why my words, even as I uttered them, should seem so inadequate.  "Of course you 

don't," mocked my husband. "But this is the limit. And what you want isn't going to count!"  "I don't 

want you to do that," I repeated. Something in my voice, I suppose, must have arrested him, for he 

stood there, staring at me, with a little knot coming and going on one side of his skull, just in front 

of his upper ear-tip.  "And why not?" he asked, still with that hateful rough ironic note in his voice. 

"Because you don't know what you're punishing this child for," I told him with all the quietness I 

could command. "And because you're in no fit condition to do it."  "You needn't worry about my 

condition," he cried out--and I could see by the way he said it that he was still blind with rage. 

"Come here, you!" he called to Dinkie.  It was then that the fatal little bell clanged somewhere at 

the back of my head, the bell that rings down the curtain on all the slowly accumulated civilization 

the centuries may have brought to us. I not only faced my husband with a snort of scorn, but I 

tightened my grip on the child's hand. I tightened my grip on his hand and backed slowly and 

deliberately away until I came to the door of my sewing-room. Then, still facing my husband, I 

opened that door and said: "Go inside, Dinkie." I could not see the boy, but I knew that he had 

done as I told him. So I promptly slammed the door shut and stood there facing the gray-lipped 

man with the riding-quirt in his hand. He took two slow steps toward me. His chin was thrust out in 

a way that made me think of a fighting-cock's beak. He had not shaved that morning, and his 

squared jaw looked stubbled and blue and ugly.  "You can't pull that petticoat stuff this time," he 

said in a hard and throaty tone which I had never heard from him before. "Get out of my way!" 

"You will not beat that child!" And however, Mr. Lincoln showed forecast, if not conscientious 

independence. He stepped forth in advance of the sentiments of his party, and to his political 

friends appeared rash in the extreme.  Lincoln's first attempt to get elected to the State Legislature 

was unsuccessful. It however brought him the means of "doing something for his country," and 

partly averting the "death-struggle of the world," in the shape of the postmastership of New Salem. 

The business of the office was not on a large scale, for it was carried on in Mr. Lincoln's hat--an 

integument of which it is recorded, that he refused to give it to a conjurer to play the egg trick in, 

"not from respect for his own hat, but for the conjurer's eggs." The future President did not fail to 

signalize his first appearance as an administrator by a sally of the jocularity which was always 

struggling with melancholy in his mind. A gentleman of the place, whose education had been 

defective, was in the habit of calling two or three times a day at the post-office, and ostentatiously 

inquiring for letters. At last he received a letter, which, being unable to read himself, he got the 

postmaster to read for him before a large circle of friends. It proved to be from a negro lady 

engaged in domestic service in the South, recalling the memory of a mutual attachment, with a 

number of incidents more delectable than sublime. It is needless to say that the postmaster, by a 

slight extension of the sphere of his office, had written the letter as well as delivered it.  In a 

second candidature the aspirant was more successful, and he became one of nine representatives 

of Sangamon County, in the State Legislature of Illinois, who, being all more than six feet high, 

were called "The Long Nine." With his Brobdingnagian colleagues Abraham plunged at once into 

the "internal improvement system," and distinguished himself above his fellows by the 

unscrupulous energy and strategy with which he urged through the Legislature a series of 


_
very pretty picture as I flung that challenge up in his teeth.  "Get out of my way," he repeated. He 

did not shout it. He said it almost quietly. But I knew, even before he reached out a shaking hand 

to thrust me aside, that he was in deadly earnest, that nothing I could say would hold him back or 

turn him aside. And it was then that my eye fell on the big Colt in its stained leather holster, 

hanging up high over one corner of the book-cabinet, where it had been put beyond the reach of 

the children.  I have no memory of giving any thought to the matter. My reaction must have been 

both immediate and automatic. I don't think I even intended to bunt my husband in the short-ribs 

the way I did, for the impact of my body half twisted him about and sent him staggering back 

several steps. All I know is that holster and belt came tumbling down as I sprang and caught at the 

Colt handle. And I was back at the door before I had even shaken the revolver free. I was back 

just in time to hear my husband say, rather foolishly, for the third time: "Get out of my way!"  "You 

stay back there!" I called, quite as foolishly, for by this time I had the Colt balanced in my hand and 

was pointing it directly at his body.  He stopped short, with a vacuous look in his eyes.  "_You 

fool!_" he said, in a sort of strangled whisper. But it was my face, and not the weapon, that he was 

staring at all the while.  "Stay back!" I said again, with my eyes fixed on his.  He hesitated, for a 

moment, and made a sound that was like the short bark of a laugh. It was too hard and horrible, 

though, ever to be taken for laughter. And I knew that he was not going to do what I had said. 

"Stay back!" I warned him still again. But he stepped forward, with a grim sort of deliberation, with 

his challenging gaze locked on mine. I could hear a thousand warning voices, somewhere at the 

back of my brain, and at the same time I could hear a thousand singing devils in my blood trying to 

drown out those voices. I could see my husband's narrowed eyes slowly widen, slowly open like 

the gills of a dying fish, for the hate that he must have seen on my face obviously arrested him. It 

arrested him, but it arrested him only for a moment. He dropped his eyes to the Colt in my hand. 

Then he moved deliberately forward until his body was almost against the barrel-end. I must have 

known what it meant, just as he must have known what it meant. It was his final challenge. And I 

must have met that challenge. For, without quite knowing it, I shut my eyes and pulled the trigger. 

There had been something awful, I know, in that momentary silence. And there was something 

awful in the sound that came after it, though it was not the sound my subconscious mind was 

waiting for. It was distinct enough and significant enough, heaven knows. But instead of the 

explosion of a shell it was the sharp snap of steel against steel.  The revolver was empty. It was 

empty-had been empty for weeks. But the significant fact remained that I had deliberately pulled 

the trigger. I had stood ready, in my moment of madness, to kill the man that I lived with....  Had a 

ball of lead gone through that man's body, I don't think he could have staggered back with a more 

startled expression on his face. He looked more than bewildered; he looked vaguely humiliated, 

oddly and wordlessly affronted, as he stood leaning against the table-edge, breathing hard, his 

skin a mottled blue-white to the very lips. He made an effort to speak, but no sound came from 

him. For a moment the dreadful thought raced through me that I had indeed shot him, that in some 

mysterious way he was mortally hurt, without this particular bullet announcing itself as bullets 

usually do. I looked at the revolver, stupidly. It seemed to have grown heavy, as heavy as a cook-

stove in my hand.  "You'd do that?" whispered my husband, very slowly, with a stricken light in his 

eyes which I couldn't quite understand. I intended to put the Colt on the table. But something must 

have been wrong with my vision, for the loathsome thing fell loathsomely to the floor. I felt sick and 



shaken and a horrible misty feeling of homelessness settled down about me, of a sudden, for I 

remembered how closely I had skirted the black gulf of murder.  "Oh, Dinky-Dunk!" I blubbered, 

weakly, as I groped toward him. He must have thought that I was going to fall, for he put out his 

arm and held me up. He held me up, but there wasn't an atom of warmth in his embrace. He held 

me up about the same as he'd hold up an open wheat-sack that threatened to tumble over on his 

granary and other improvements, especially improvements of river navigation, were voted out of 

all proportion to the means or credit of the then thinly-peopled State. To set these little matters in 

motion, a loan of eight millions of dollars was authorized, and to complete the canal from Chicago 

to Peru, another loan of four millions of dollars was voted at the same session, two hundred 

thousand dollars being given as a gratuity to those counties which seemed to have no special 

interest in any of the foregoing projects. Work on all these roads was to commence, not only at the 

same time, but at both ends of each road and at all the river- crossings. There were as yet no 

surveys of any route, no estimates, no reports of engineers, or even unprofessional viewers. 

"Progress was not to wait on trifles; capitalists were supposed to be lying in wait to catch these 

precious bonds; the money would be raised in a twinkling, and being applied with all the skill of a 

hundred De Witt Clintons--a class of gentlemen at that time extremely numerous and obtrusive--

the loan would build railroads, the railroads would build cities, cities would create farms, foreign 

capital would rush in to so inviting a field, the lands would be taken up with marvellous celerity, 

and the land tax going into a sinking fund, that, with some tolls and certain sly speculations to be 

made by the State, would pay principal and interest of debt without even a cent of taxation upon 

the people. In short, everybody was to be enriched, while the munificence of the State in selling its 

credit and spending the proceeds, would make its empty coffers overflow with ready money. It was 

a dark stroke of statesmanship, a mysterious device in finance, which, whether from being 

misunderstood or mismanaged, bore from the beginning fruits the very reverse of those it had 

promised." We seem here to be reading the history of more than one great railway enterprise 

undertaken by politicians without the red tape preliminaries of surveying or framing estimates, 

progress not deigning to wait upon trifles. This system of policy gave fine scope for the talents of 

the "log-roller," here defined as an especially wily and persuasive person, who could depict the 

merits of his scheme with roseate but delusive eloquence, and who was said to carry a gourd of 

"possum fat"--wherewith he "greased and swallowed" his prey. One of the largest of these gourds 

was carried by "honest Abe," who was especially active in "log-rolling" a bill for the removal of the 

seat of government from Vandalia to Springfield, at a virtual cost to the State of about six millions 

of dollars, which we were told would have purchased all the real estate in the town three times 

over. "Thus by log-rolling on the loud measure, by multiplying railroads, by terminating these roads 

at Alton, that Alton might become a great city in opposition to St. Louis; by distributing money to 

some of the counties to be wasted by the County Commissioners, and by giving the seat of 

government to Springfield--was the whole State bought up and bribed to approve the most 

senseless and disastrous policy which ever crippled the energies of a young country." We are told, 

and do not doubt, that Mr. Lincoln shared the popular delusion; but we are also told, and are 

equally sure, that "even if he had been unhappily afflicted with individual scruples of his own he 

would have deemed it but simple duty to obey the almost unanimous voice of his constituency." In 

other words, he would have deemed it his duty to pander to the popular madness by taking a part 



in financial swindling. Yet he and his principal confederates obtained afterwards high places of 

honour and trust. A historian of Illinois calls them "spared monuments of popular wrath, evincing 

how safe it is to be a politician, but how disastrous it may be to the country to keep along with the 

present fervour of the people." It is instructive as well as just to remember that all this time the 

man was strictly, nay sensitively, honourable in his private dealings, that he was regarded by his 

fellows as a paragon of probity, that his word was never questioned, that of personal corruption 

calumny itself, so far as we are aware, never dared to accuse him. Politics, it seems, may be a 

game apart, with rules of its own which supersede morality.  Considering that, as we said before, 

this man was destined to preside over the most tremendous operations in the whole history of 

finance, it is especially instructive to see what was the state of his mind on economical subjects. 

He actually proposed to pass a 


_
don't know what reaction it was that took my strength away from me, but I clung to his shoulders 

and sobbed there. I felt as alone in the gray wastes of time as one of Gershom's lost stars. And I 

knew that my Dinky-Dunk would never bend down now and whisper into my ear any word of 

comfort, any word of forgiveness. For, however things may have been at the first, I was the one 

who was now so hopelessly in the wrong, _I_ was the big offender. And that knowledge only 

added to my misery as I stood there clinging to my husband's shoulders and blubbering "Oh, 

Dinky-Dunk!"  It must have grown distasteful to him, my foolish hanging on to him as though he 

were a hitching-post, for he finally said in a remote voice: "I guess we've had about enough of 

this." He led me rather ceremoniously to a chair, and slowly let me down in it. Then he crossed 

over to the old leather holster and picked it up, and stooped for the revolver, and pushed it down in 

the holster and buckled the cover-flap and tossed the whole thing up to the top of the book-cabinet 

again. Then, without speaking to me, he walked slowly out of the room.  I was tempted to call him 

back, but I knew, on second thought, that it would be no use. I merely sat there, staring ahead of 

me. Then I shut my eyes and tried to think. I don't know why, but I was thinking about the bigness 

of Betelgeuse, which was arrived, it appears, at the sage conviction that while to pay the current 

rent for the use of a house or the current fee for the services of a lawyer is perfectly proper, to pay 

the current price for money is to "allow a few individuals to levy a direct tax on the community." But 

this is an ordinary illusion. Abraham Lincoln's illusions went far beyond it. He actually proposed so 

to legislate that in cases of extreme necessity there might "always be found means to cheat the 

law, while in all other cases it would have its intended effect." He proposed in fact absurdity 

qualified by fraud, the established practice of which would, no doubt, have had a most excellent 

effect in teaching the citizens to reverence and the Courts to uphold the law. As President, when 

told that the finances were low, he asked whether the printing machine had given out, and he 

suggested, as a special temptation to capitalists, the issue of a class of bonds which should be 

exempt from seizure for debt. It may safely be said that the burden of the United States debt was 

ultimately increased fifty per cent through sheer ignorance of the simplest principles of economy 

and finance on the part of those by whom it was contracted.  Lincoln's style, both as a speaker 

and a writer, ultimately became plain, terse, and with occasional faults of taste, caused by 

imperfect education, pure as well 


_
as our sun and which was going on through its millions of miles of space without knowing anything 

about Chaddie McKail and what had happened to her that morning. I was wondering if there were 

worlds between me and Betelgeuse with women on them, with women as alone as I was, when I 

felt a pair of small arms tighten about my knees and an adoring small voice whispered "Mummsy!" 

And I forgot about his State Papers are admirable in their way. Saving one very flat expression, 

the address has no superior in literature. But it was impossible that the oratory of a rising politician, 

especially in the West, should be free from spread-eagleism. Scattered through these pages we 

find such gems as the following:--  "All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all 

the treasure of the earth
