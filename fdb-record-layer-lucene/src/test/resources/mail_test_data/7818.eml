HIPPIAS: Very true.  SOCRATES: And would you rather have a horse of such a =
temper that you=20

may ride him ill voluntarily or involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: I would rather hav=
e a horse which I could=20

ride ill voluntarily.  SOCRATES: That would be the better horse?  HIPPIAS: =
Yes.  SOCRATES:=20

Then with a horse of better temper, vicious actions would be produced volun=
tarily; and with a=20

horse of bad temper involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: Certainly.  SOCRATES: And that=
 would be true of a=20

dog, or of any other animal?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: And is it better to =
possess the mind of=20

an archer who voluntarily or involuntarily misses the mark?  HIPPIAS: Of hi=
m who voluntarily=20

misses.  SOCRATES: This would be the better mind for the purposes of archer=
y?  HIPPIAS: Yes.=20

SOCRATES: Then the mind which involuntarily errs is worse than the mind whi=
ch errs voluntarily?=20

HIPPIAS: Yes, certainly, in the use of the bow.  SOCRATES: And what would y=
ou say of the art of=20

medicine;--has not the mind which voluntarily works harm to the body, more =
of the healing art?=20

HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: Then in the art of medicine the voluntary is bette=
r than the=20

involuntary?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: Well, and in lute-playing and in flu=
te-playing, and in all=20

arts and sciences, is not that mind the better which voluntarily does what =
is evil and=20

dishonourable, and goes wrong, and is not the worse that which does so invo=
luntarily?  HIPPIAS:=20

That is evident.  SOCRATES: And what would you say of the characters of sla=
ves? Should we not=20

prefer to have those who voluntarily do wrong and make mistakes, and are th=
ey not better in their=20

mistakes than those who commit them involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES=
: And should we=20

not desire to have our own minds in the best state possible?  HIPPIAS: Yes.=
  SOCRATES: And=20

will our minds be better if they do wrong and make mistakes voluntarily or =
involuntarily?  HIPPIAS:=20

O, Socrates, it would be a monstrous thing to say that those who do wrong v=
oluntarily are better=20

than those who do wrong involuntarily!  SOCRATES: And yet that appears to b=
e the only=20

inference.  HIPPIAS: I do not think so.  SOCRATES: But I imagined, Hippias,=
 that you did. Please=20

to answer once more: Is not justice a power, or knowledge, or both? Must no=
t justice, at all events,=20

be one of these?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: But if justice is a power of the=
 soul, then the soul=20

which has the greater power is also the more just; for that which has the g=
reater power, my good=20

friend, has been proved by us to be the better.  HIPPIAS: Yes, that has bee=
n proved.=20

SOCRATES: And if justice is knowledge, then the wiser will be the juster so=
ul, and the more=20

ignorant the more unjust?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES: But if justice be power=
 as well as=20

knowledge--then will not the soul which has both knowledge and power be the=
 more just, and that=20

which is the more ignorant be the more unjust? Must it not be so?  HIPPIAS:=
 Clearly.=20

SOCRATES: And is not the soul which has the greater power and wisdom also b=
etter, and better=20

able to do both good and evil in every action?  HIPPIAS: Certainly.  SOCRAT=
ES: The soul, then,=20

which acts ill, acts voluntarily by power and art--and these either one or =
both of them are elements=20

of justice?  HIPPIAS: That seems to be true.  SOCRATES: And to do injustice=
 is to do ill, and not=20

to do injustice is to do well?  HIPPIAS: was a formidable sight, perhaps ne=
ver equalled: those lines=20

of huge, menacing, and yet protecting fighting machines stretching down the=
 river for miles, all=20

conveying the single thought of the power and extent of the British Navy an=
d its formidable=20

character as a fighting unit.  [Illustration: Where Edward Bok is happiest:=
 in his garden.]  It was=20

upon his return to London that Bok learned, through the confidence of a mem=
ber of the British=20

"inner circle," the amazing news that the war was practically over: that Bu=
lgaria had capitulated=20

and was suing for peace; that two of the Central Power provinces had indica=
ted their strong desire=20



that the war should end; and that the first peace intimations had gone to t=
he President of the=20

United States. All diplomatic eyes were turned toward Washington.  Yet not =
a hint of the=20

impending events had reached the public.  The Germans were being beaten bac=
k, that was=20

known; it was evident that the morale of the German army was broken; that F=
och had turned the=20

tide toward victory; but even the best-informed military authorities outsid=
e of the inner diplomatic=20

circles, predicted that the war would last until the spring of 1919, when a=
 final "drive" would end it.=20

Yet, at that very moment, the end of the war was in sight!  Next Bok went t=
o France to visit the=20

battle-fields.  It was arranged that the party should first, under guidance=
 of British officers, visit=20

back of the British lines; and then, successively, be turned over to the Am=
erican and French=20

Governments, and visit the operations back of their armies.  It is an amusi=
ng fact that although=20

each detail of officers delegated to escort the party "to the front" receiv=
ed the most explicit=20

instructions from their superior officers to take the party only to the qui=
et sectors where there was=20

no fighting going on, each detail from the three governments successively b=
rought the party=20

directly under shell-fire, and each on the first day of the "inspection."  =
It was unconsciously done:=20

the officers were as much amazed to find themselves under fire as were the =
members of the party,=20

except that the latter did not feel the responsibility to an equal degree. =
 The officers, in each case,=20

were plainly worried: the editors were intensely interested.  They were dep=
ressing trips through=20

miles and miles of devastated villages and small cities.  From two to three=
 days each were spent=20

in front-line posts on the Amiens-Bethune, Albert-Peronne, Bapaume-Soissons=
, St. Mihiel, and=20

back of the Argonne sectors.  Often, the party was the first civilian group=
 to enter a town=20

evacuated only a week before, and all the horrible evidence of bloody warfa=
re was fresh and plain.=20

Bodies of German soldiers lay in the trenches where they had fallen; wired =
bombs were on every=20

hand, so that no object could be touched that lay on the battle-fields; the=
 streets of some of the=20

towns were still mined, so that no automobiles could enter; the towns were =
deserted, the streets=20

desolate.  It was an appalling panorama of the most frightful results of wa=
r.  The picturesqueness=20

and romance of the war of picture books were missing.  To stand beside an E=
nglish battery of=20

thirty guns laying a barrage as they fired their shells to a point ten mile=
s distant, made one feel as=20

if one were an actual part of real warfare, and yet far removed from it,=20


_
SOCRATES: And will not the better and abler soul when it does wrong, do wro=
ng voluntarily, and=20

the bad soul involuntarily?  HIPPIAS: Clearly.  SOCRATES: And the good man =
is he who has the=20

good soul, and the bad man is he who has the bad?  HIPPIAS: Yes.  SOCRATES:=
 Then the good=20

man will voluntarily do wrong, "sausage observation"; then the shells from =
the enemy fired a return=20

salvo, and the better part of valor was discretion a few miles farther back=
.  Bok was standing=20

talking to the commandant of one of the great French army supply depots one=
 morning.  He was a=20

man of forty; a colonel in the regular French army.=20


_
involuntarily, if the good man is he who has the good soul?  HIPPIAS: Which=
 he certainly has.=20

SOCRATES: Then, Hippias, he who voluntarily does wrong and disgraceful thin=
gs, if there be=20

such a man, will be the good man?  HIPPIAS: There I cannot agree with you. =
 SOCRATES: Nor=20

can I agree with myself, Hippias; and yet that seems to be the conclusion w=
hich, as far as we can=20

see at present, must follow from our argument. As I was saying before, I am=
 all abroad, and being=20

in perplexity am always changing my opinion. Now, that I or any ordinary ma=
n should wander in=20

perplexity is not surprising; but if you wise men also wander, and we canno=
t come to you and rest=20

and mustache, and who wore the single star of a subaltern on his sleeve, ca=
me up, saluted,=20

delivered a message, and then asked:  "Are there any more orders, sir?"  "N=
o," was the reply.  He=20

brought his heels together with a click, saluted again, and went away.  The=
 commandant turned to=20

Bok with a peculiar smile on his face and asked:  "Do you know who that man=
 is?"  "No," was the=20

reply.  "That is my father," was the answer.  The father was then exactly s=
eventy-two years old.=20

He was a retired business man when the war broke out.  After two years of t=
he heroic struggle he=20

decided that he couldn't keep out of it.  He was too old to fight, but afte=
r long=20
