in diameter, and enclosed the ends of the architraves in the wheels. In the ends he fixed pivots 

and rings in the same way. So when the four-inch frames were drawn by oxen, the wheels turned 

on the pivots enclosed in the rings, and the architraves, which were enclosed like axles in the 

wheels, soon reached the building, in the same way as the shafts. The rollers used for smoothing 

the walks in palaestrae will serve as an example of this method. But it could not have been 

employed unless the distance had been short; for it feet--reminded them that those very people 

who were now looking down from their frames had once moved about, sat, drunk tea in this room, 

and the fact that lovely Pelagea was moving noiselessly about was better than any story.  Alehin 

was fearfully sleepy; he had got up early, before three o'clock in the morning, to look after his 

work, and now his eyes were closing; but he was afraid his visitors might tell some interesting 

story after he had gone, and he lingered on. He did not go into the question whether what Ivan

from the stone-quarries to the temple, and there is no hill, but an uninterrupted plain.  13. In our 

own times, however, when the pedestal of the colossal Apollo in his temple had cracked with age, 

they were afraid that the statue would fall and be broken, and so they contracted for the cutting of 

a pedestal from the same quarries. The contract was taken by one Paconius. This pedestal was 

twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and six feet high. Paconius, with confident pride, did not transport 

it by the method of Metagenes, but determined to make a machine of a different sort, though on 

the same principle.  14. He made wheels of about fifteen feet in diameter, and in these wheels he 

enclosed the ends of the stone; then he fastened two-inch crossbars from wheel to wheel round 

the stone, encompassing it, so that there was an interval of not more than one foot between bar 

and bar. Then he coiled a rope round the bars, yoked up his oxen, and began to draw on the rope. 

Consequently as it uncoiled, it did indeed cause the wheels to turn, but it could not draw them in a 

line straight along the road, but kept swerving out to one side. Hence it was necessary to draw the 

machine back again. Thus, by this drawing to and fro, Paconius got into such financial 

embarrassment that he became insolvent.  15. I will digress a bit and explain how these stone-

quarries were discovered. Pixodorus was a shepherd who lived in that vicinity. When the people of 

Ephesus were not talk of groats, nor of hay, nor of tar, but of something that had no direct bearing 

on his life, and he was glad and wanted them to go on.  "It's bed-time, though," said Burkin, getting 

up. "Allow me to wish you good-night."  Alehin said good-night and went downstairs to his own 

domain, while the visitors remained upstairs. They were both taken for the night to a big room 

where there stood two old wooden beds decorated with carvings, and in the corner was an ivory 

crucifix. The big cool beds, which had been made by the lovely Pelagea, smelt agreeably of clean 

linen.  Ivan Ivanovitch undressed in silence and got into bed.  "Lord forgive us sinners!" he said, 

and put his head under the quilt.  His pipe lying on the table smelt strongly of stale tobacco, and 

Burkin could not sleep for a long while, and kept wondering where the oppressive smell came 

from.  The rain was pattering on the window-panes all night.      ABOUT LOVE  AT lunch next day 

there were very nice pies, crayfish, and mutton cutlets; and while we were eating, Nikanor, the 

cook, came up to ask what the visitors would like for dinner. He was a man of medium height, with 

a puffy face and little eyes; he was close-shaven, and it looked as though his moustaches had not 

been shaved, but had been pulled out by the roots. Alehin told us that the beautiful Pelagea was in 

love with this cook. As he drank and was of a violent character, she did not want to marry him, but 

was willing to live

marble, and debating whether to get the marble from Paros, Proconnesus, Heraclea, or Thasos, 

Pixodorus drove out his sheep and was feeding his flock in that very spot. Then two rams ran at 

each other, and, each passing the other, one of them, after his charge, struck his horns against a 

rock, from which a fragment of extremely white colour was dislodged. So devout, and his religious 

convictions would not allow him to "live in sin"; he insisted on her marrying him, and would consent 

to nothing else, and when he was drunk he used to abuse her and even beat her. Whenever he 

got drunk she used to hide upstairs and sob, and on such occasions Alehin and the servants 

stayed in the house to be ready to defend her in
