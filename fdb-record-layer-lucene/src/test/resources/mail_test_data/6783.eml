old earth is going back on you!"  "On the contrary," said Gershom as he put=
 down his telescope, "I=20

know nothing more conducive to serenity than the study of astronomy. It has=
 a tendency to teach=20

you, in the first place, just how insignificant you are in the general sche=
me of things. The naked=20

eye, in clear air like this, can see over eight thousand stars. The larger =
telescopes reveal a=20

hundred million company, and they strictly obeyed his orders at a word. His=
 company was all=20

young men, and full of sport." The assertion as to the strict and uniform o=
bedience of the company=20

at its captain's word, requires, as we have seen, some qualification in a d=
emocratic sense.=20

Whether Lincoln was ever beaten in wrestling is also one of the moot points=
 of history.  In the=20

course of this campaign one Mr. Thompson,=20


_
shown that there are several thousands of millions which can be definitely =
recorded. So that you=20

and I are not altogether the whole works. And to remember that, when we are=
 feeling a bit=20

important, is good for our Ego!"  I didn't answer him, for I was busy just =
then studying the Milky=20

Way. And I couldn't help feeling that it must have been on a night like thi=
s that a certain young=20

shepherd watching his flocks on the uplands of Canaan sat studying the infi=
nite stairways of star-

dust that "sloped through darkness up to God" and was moved to say: "When I=
 consider the=20

heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast or=
dained, what is man=20

that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him?"  "=
Yes, Gershom, it's=20

horribly humiliating," I said as I squinted up at those serene heavens. "Th=
ey last forever. And we=20

come and go out, and nobody knows why!"  "Pardon me," corrected the literal=
-minded Gershom.=20

"They do not last forever. They come and go out, just as we do. Only wrestl=
er was great=20

throughout the west, accepted Lincoln's challenge. Great excitement prevail=
ed, and Lincoln's=20

company and backers "put up all their portable property and some perhaps no=
t their own,=20

including knives, blankets, tomahawks, and all the necessary articles of a =
soldier's outfit." As soon=20

as Lincoln laid hold of his antagonist he found that he had got at least hi=
s match, and warned his=20

friends of that unwelcome fact. He was thrown once fairly, and a second tim=
e fell with Thompson=20

on the top of him. "We were taken by surprise," candidly says Mr. Green, "a=
nd being unwilling to=20

put with our property and lose our bets, got up an excuse as to the result.=
 We declared the fall a=20

kind of a dog-fall--did so apparently angrily." A fight was about to begin,=
 when Lincoln rose up and=20

said, "Boys, the man actually threw me once fair, broadly so; and the secon=
d time, this very fall, he=20

threw me fairly, though not so apparently so." This quelled the disturbance=
.  On the same authority=20

we are told that Lincoln=20


_
Consider the Dipper up there, for instance. A hundred thousand years from n=
ow that Dipper will be=20

perceptibly altered, for we know the lateral movement of Dubhe and Benetnas=
ch will give the outer=20

line of the bowl a greater flare and make the crook of the handle a save th=
e life of a poor old Indian=20

who had thrown himself on the mercy of the soldiers, and whom, notwithstand=
ing that he had a=20

pass, they were proceeding to slay. The anecdote wears a somewhat melodrama=
tic aspect; but=20

there is no doubt of Lincoln's humanity, or of=20


_
sharper. Even a thousand years would show change enough for instruments to =
detect. And a=20

million years will probably show the group pretty well broken up. But the o=
ne regrettable feature, of=20

course, is that we will not be here to see it."  "Where will we be?" I aske=
d Gershom.  "I don't=20

know," he finally admitted, after an unexpectedly long silence.  "But will =
it all go on, forever and=20

forever and forever?"  "To do so is not in the nature of things," was Gersh=
om's quiet-toned reply.=20

"It is the destiny of our protest against oppression and cruelty when they =
actually fell under his=20

notice. It was also in keeping with his character to insist firmly on the r=
ight of his militiamen to the=20

same rations and pay as the regulars, and to draw the legal line sharply an=
d clearly when the=20

regular officers exceeded their authority in the exercise of command.  Retu=
