I saw the space behind his shoulder, prayed that my bullet might miss his r=
ibs, summoned the last=20

force at my almost dead hand, and fired.  A little drift of air blew the sm=
oke aside so quickly that I=20

could see the fur fly. He bit savagely at his side, but he crawled on witho=
ut stopping. From my=20

numb hand the revolver fell without noise in the snow--my fight was finishe=
d. He came on; he was=20

only fifteen feet away from me, when he stopped and coughed. Would he sink,=
 unable to move=20

farther?  No; he started again! Although his legs dragged behind him, imped=
ing, although he left a=20

red trail on the snow, and each step forced a snarl from him, he came on. W=
ith glittering eyes and=20

hoarse breath, he forced arguing with a haughty female aristocrat behind a =
post-office counter, or=20

of passing a shop where we owe money. As for blushing or hanging back, or e=
ven looking=20

awkward, when faced with any such simple, everyday acts, the idea of conduc=
t so childish would=20

not occur to us. We behave naturally under all circumstances--for why shoul=
d a sane man behave=20

otherwise? Priam Farll was different. To call the world's attention visuall=
y to the fact of his own=20

existence was anguish to him. But in a letter he could be absolutely brazen=
. Give him a pen and=20

he was fearless.  Now he knew that he would have to go and open the front d=
oor. Both humanity=20

and self-interest urged him to go instantly. For the visitant was=20


_
passed before he was close enough to touch me.  Ah! Even as he turned towar=
d my hand to seize=20

it, even as I waited to see, rather than feel, the crunching of my senseles=
s arm, his head drooped.=20

He raised it once more, but his power was gone. He laid his head, once so p=
owerful, upon my=20

hand, rested his body against the stone, that stood high enough to support =
him, and glared at me=20

with his fierce, malignant eyes.  Then the fire changed in his eyes, cloude=
d, flickered, glowed--

went out. The last breath was expelled with a wheeze. He was dead.  Then my=
 own powers sank,=20

and I thought that I was dying, too. Somewhere in the midst of my faintness=
 I had a sense as if I=20

felt, rather than heard, hasty, heavy footsteps on the bank above me. As so=
on upstairs. The sick=20

man was Henry Leek, and Henry Leek was Priam Farll's bad habit. While somew=
hat of a rascal=20

(as his master guessed), Leek was a very perfect valet. Like you and me, he=
 was never shy. He=20

always did the natural thing naturally. He had become, little by little, in=
dispensable to Priam Farll,=20

the sole means of living communication between Priam Farll and the universe=
 of men. The=20

master's shyness, resembling a deer's, kept the pair almost entirely out of=
 England, and, on their=20

continuous travels, the servant invariably stood between that sensitive dif=
fidence and the world.=20

Leek saw every one who had to be seen, and did everything that involved per=
sonal contacts. And,=20

being a bad habit, he had, of course, grown on Priam Farll,=20
