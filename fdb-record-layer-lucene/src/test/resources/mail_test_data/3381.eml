After all, it was Spain's business to keep order on the frontier; and the U=
nited States waited a year=20

and a half for the Madrid Government to give evidence of intent to do so. B=
ut, as nothing but vain=20

promises were forthcoming, some American troops engaged in building a fort =
on the Apalachicola,=20

just north of the boundary line, marched down the river in July, 1816, bomb=
arded Nicholls's Negro=20

Fort, blew up its magazine, and practically exterminated the Negro and Indi=
