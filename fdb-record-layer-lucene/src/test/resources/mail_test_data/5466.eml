exclamations. Jasmine became nearly as excited over the new bonnets as her =

draw up short on blame for what those boys have done," declared Elizabeth e=
mphatically. "What=20

did we do to keep them from going out and organizing as they have?"  "No do=

mistakes in the beginning, but our errors do not atone for their sins."  "B=

sprang up from her place and ran to the dining-room=20

the cathedral; "we must forget the beautiful bonnets, and those dear little=
 tight-fitting jackets, and=20

those muslin dresses. We must forget the little story we made up of imagini=

we must forget the vanities now. It has always been one of my dreams to com=

Poppy." Jasmine clasped her companion's hand, and her excitable little face=
 grew white--the=20

magnitude of the great door just as a tall young man bounded through. He ca=

of the stranger.  "Harold!" cried Elizabeth. "When did you come?"  "Just no=
