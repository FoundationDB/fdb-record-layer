dracaena marginata of the King's Pie, which Harold was to read to the War-L=
ord on that day. All gave a great cheer when the gate was unbarred; and all=
 the little girls waved their handkerchiefs when with a gay shake of his ha=
nd Harold stepped out into the danger zone.  Red Rex received him as usual,=
 sitting upon the green hillock. Harold manner seemed to puzzle, and make h=
er nervous.  "Oh, it is not at all 'original,'" said I. "Whatever other mer=
it it possesses, it can't claim originality--it is the commonest thing in t=
he world; but I think it is an acquired taste at first--it grows upon you l=
ike caviar or olives. I remember some years ago, in Australia, dracaena mar=
ginata of the King's Pie, which Harold was to read to the War-Lord on that =
day. All gave a great cheer when the gate was unbarred; and all the little =
girls waved their handkerchiefs when with a gay shake of his hand Harold st=
epped out into the danger zone.  Red Rex received him as usual, sitting upo=
n the green hillock. Harold manner seemed to puzzle, and make her nervous. =
 "Oh, it is not at all 'original,'" said I. "Whatever other merit it posses=
ses, it can't claim originality--it is the commonest thing in the world; bu=
t I think it is an acquired taste at first--it grows upon you like caviar o=

window!"  It did not seem possible that the thief could do this, it was suc=
h a tiny window. But, sure=20

enough! when the door was opened, and Harold and his mother crowded into th=
e pantry, they=20

were but just in time to seize the hem of the old woman's shawl, as her las=
t leg squeezed through=20

the casement. Harold held on to the shawl tightly, however, and off it came=
 in his hands. It was a=20

very nice shawl.  "Who ever heard of a thief in Kisington!" exclaimed the m=
other. "Who could it be?=20

I never saw a shawl like this. Let us examine what she has taken, the wicke=
d old creature!"=20

Harold got a candle, and presently returned to the pantry, where his mother=
 was groping among=20

the smashed crockery for some other clue to the thief. When the light flick=
ered on the pantry=20

shelves the mother gave a scream of surprise and anger. "My six beautiful p=
ies!" she exclaimed.=20

"The thief has stolen my six beautiful apple pies! Oh, what a wicked old so=
ul!"  "Those lovely pies!"=20

groaned Harold. "See, Mother, she has gobbled one and left the empty plate.=
 The others she has=20

taken away with her."  "I wish they may choke her!" cried the mother angril=
y. "Now you will have=20

none to take to your Red King to-morrow. I was going to save the finest of =
all for him, in the hope=20

that it would soften his hard heart."  "It will never soften his heart nor =
please his stomach now,=20

Mother," said Harold ruefully. "And still more I regret the other five pies=
 which I know you meant for=20

me. When shall we ever see such pies again?"  "They were made from the last=
 of the flour and=20

apples and sugar sent you in gratitude by the Leading Citizens," said Harol=
d's mother sadly. "I am=20

sorry your reward is thus wasted, my poor boy! What spiteful neighbor could=
 have spied them=20

through the pantry window and planned this midnight raid at our expense?"  =
Harold shook his=20

head mournfully. "I do not know any one in Kisington whom I could suspect,"=
 he said. "Come,=20

Mother, let us go back to bed. To-morrow we will look further into the matt=
er. We have at least this=20

handsome shawl as one clue, which if it does not find us the thief will be =
very nice for you to=20

wear."  They went to bed again, and slept until morning.  Now in the mornin=
g before school Harold=20

took the shawl and went to his friend the Librarian and told him what had h=
appened during the=20

night. The Librarian was greatly shocked to hear of a theft in town and wen=
t with Harold straight to=20

the Lord Mayor.  The Mayor examined the shawl carefully and shook his head.=
 "This is very=20

strange!" he said. "This is no shawl made in Kisington, or in our Kingdom. =
It is a strange foreign=20

shawl, and very valuable. I am glad to believe that the thief must have bee=
n a foreigner, or a=20

gypsy, or a vagrant of some sort. But how did she find her way into our gua=
rded city? I must look=20

into this! Meanwhile, my lad, since you have suffered loss and damage to yo=
ur pantry and to your=20

feelings the Leading Citizens will see that you are made whole at their exp=
ense; I will answer for=20

their gratitude to you."  "My Lord," said the Librarian, patting Harold aff=
ectionately on the head,=20

"our boy has done so well already in handling this savage King, may we not =
expect still more from=20

him now that the time is so critical? King Victor should soon be coming to =
our aid. If we can but=20

postpone the siege for at least another day! Suppose Harold should invite R=
ed Rex, under a flag=20

of truce, to visit and inspect our Library?"  "Good!" cried the Mayor. "Whe=
n you go to Red Rex this=20

afternoon, Harold, my boy, see what you can do further in the matter."  "I =
will try, my Lord Mayor,"=20

said Harold. "But Red Rex is growing very impatient. I fear that I cannot m=
uch longer keep him=20

amused with our tales."  "Clever lad! You have already done right well," sa=
id the Librarian,=20

embracing Harold proudly. "And I dare say you will be able to do yet more. =
Now, run along to=20

school; for we must not forget our everyday duties, even in these times of =
excitement and danger."=20

So Harold went to school, and you can imagine how many questions he had to =
answer at recess=20



time. The Librarian went to his for your daughter's welfare is only equalle=
d by the fervour of my=20

affection for her. Shall we say L100,000 in stock, and Flityville Park as a=
 dower-house?"  "What=20

stock, Lord Frank?" asked her ladyship, as she subsided languidly into a ch=
air; "not Mexicans or=20

Spanish passives, I do most fervently trust."  "No," said I, maliciously; "=
nearly all in Confederate=20

and Greek loans."  "Oh!" she ejaculated, with a little scream, as if someth=
ing had stung her.  "What=20

is the matter, Lady Broadhem?" and she looked so unhappy and disconcerted t=
hat I had=20

compassion on her. "I was only joking; you need be under no apprehension as=
 to the securities--

they are as sound as your own theology, and would satisfy the Lord Chancell=
or quite as well."=20

"Oh, it was not that! Perhaps some day when you and dear Ursula are married=
, I will tell you all=20

about it; for you have my full consent; and I need not say what an escape I=
 think she has had from=20

that black man. _Entre nous_, as it is most important you should understand=
 exactly the situation, I=20

must correct one error into which you have fallen; she is not in love with =
you, Lord Frank; you must=20

expect a little opposition at first; but that will only add zest to the pur=
suit, and my wishes will be=20

paramount in the end. The fact is, but this is a profound secret, your frie=
nd Lord Grandon has=20

behaved most improperly in the matter. He came down on some pretence of ins=
tilling his ridiculous=20

notions into Broadhem, who took a fancy to him when we were all staying at =
Lady Mundane's, and=20

I strongly opposed it, as I fancied, even then, he was paying Ursula too mu=
ch attention; but she=20

has such influence with Broadhem that she carried her point, because, she s=
aid, her brother could=20

only get good from him. What exactly passed at Broadhem I don't know; but I=
 was so angry at the=20

idea of an almost penniless Irish peer taking advantage of his opportunitie=
s as a visitor to entrap=20

my girl's affections, that I told him I expected some people, and should wa=
nt his bedroom. He left=20

within an hour, and Ursula declares he never uttered a word which warranted=
 this decisive=20

measure; but people can do a good deal without 'uttering,' as she calls it;=
 and I am quite=20

determined not to let them see anything of each other during the season. Fo=
rtunately Lord=20

Grandon scarcely ever goes out, and Broadhem, whose eyes are opened at last=
, has promised to=20

watch him. Whoever Ursula marries must do something for Broadhem."  Althoug=
h I am able to=20

record this speech word for word, I am quite unable to account for the curi=
ous psychological fact,=20

that it has become engraven on my memory, while, at the time, I was unconsc=
ious of listening to it.=20

The pattern of the carpet, a particular curl of Lady Broadhem's "front," th=
e fact that the clock struck=20

one, are all stamped upon the plate of my internal perceptive faculties wit=
h the vividness of a=20

photograph. The vision of happiness which I had conjured up was changing in=
to a hideous=20

contrast, and reminded me of the Diorama at the Colosseum in my youth, wher=
e a fairy landscape,=20

with a pastoral group at lunch in the foreground, became gradually converte=
d into a pandemonium=20

of flames and devils.  I felt borne along by a mighty torrent which was swe=
eping me from elysian=20

fields into some fathomless abyss. Love and friendship both coming down tog=
ether in one mighty=20

crash, and the only thing left standing--Lady Broadhem--right in front of m=
e--a very stern reality=20

indeed. I don't the least know the length of time which elapsed between the=
 end of her speech and=20

when I returned to consciousness--probably not many seconds, though it seem=
ed an age. I=20

gasped for breath, so she kindly came to my relief.  "My dear Lord Frank," =
she said, "after all it=20

might have been worse. Supposing that Lord Grandon had not been your friend=
, or had not had=20

the absurd Quixotic ideas which I understand he has of the duties of friend=
ship, he might have=20

given you immense trouble; as it is, I am sure he has only to know the exac=
t state of the case to=20



retire. I know him quite well enough for that. I look upon it as providenti=
al. Had it=20


_
Mayor to his desk. And Harold's mother went down on her knees, cleaning up =
the wrecked pantry.=20

But where was the strange old woman all this time?    XV: THE BANDAGED HAND=
  As soon as=20

school was over on Thursday afternoon, Harold started once more on his erra=
nd to the War-Lord.=20

As usual, he was accompanied to the city gate by a crowd of schoolboys and =
girls who envied him=20

his luck and wished that they could go all the way Mr Chundango, Grandon wo=
uld most probably=20

have persevered. Now he is quite capable of doing all he can to help you wi=
th Ursula."  I groaned=20

in spirit. How well had Lady Broadhem judged the character of the man to wh=
om she would not=20

give her daughter!  "I am so glad to think, Lady Broadhem," said I, with a =
bitter laugh, "that you do=20

not suspect me of such a ridiculous exaggeration of sentiment. So far from =
it, it seems to=20


_
City Fathers would not permit. One boy carried Harold's coat, and another h=
is strap of=20

schoolbooks. A third brought the basket with Harold's luncheon, while Rober=
t carried the flag of=20

truce,--proud boy! But Richard, Harold's special chum, was the proudest of =
all. For he was trusted=20

with the pursuit when success is only possible at the sacrifice of another'=
s happiness; and when=20

that other is one's oldest friend, there is a refinement of emotion, a sort=
 of pleasurable pain, which=20

is quite irresistible. To what element in our nature do you attribute this?=
"  "To original sin, I am=20
