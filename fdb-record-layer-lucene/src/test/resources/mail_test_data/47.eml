THIS WORK  To protect the Project herself. No Eleanor of Guienne have we he=
re, masquerading=20

in tinsel armor at the head of a troop of stage amazons, but a gallant lady=
 charging her foes sword=20

in hand. One cannot read her story without enthusiasm; and yet one would gl=
adly know more of=20

the woman before bestowing unreserved praise upon the countess "who was wor=
th a man in the=20

fight," and "who had the heart of a lion."  With all the brilliance and the=
 heroism of these wars=20

between England and France, the glory is not untarnished; for the very patt=
erns of chivalry were=20

too often guilty of most atrocious cruelties. Charles, the saintly Count of=
 Blois, cutting off the heads=20

of the Breton knights and throwing them over the walls of Nantes; Philippe =
VI. inviting the Bretons=20



to a tourney, and then seizing and executing them; the Count de Lisle hurli=
ng from a catapult, over=20

the walls of Auberoche, the miserable servant who had ventured to bear lett=
ers from the garrison=20

through his lines; these, and more than these, are the sort of things one f=
inds even in the pages of=20

Froissart, who was so careful to conceal the unpleasant and to bring into t=
he light of genius the=20

chivalrous episodes in his chronicle of the wars. For the weak and the fall=
en there is little of pity; a=20

word as some brave knight falls, a word of the sorrow of those dependent up=
on him, and on we go=20

to fresh fields, fresh knightly exploits and pageants. Though the very spir=
it of chivalry is in the air,=20

how little thought is given to woman! It is only the rare masculine qualiti=
es of a Jeanne de Montfort=20

that can win her grudging notice from Froissart.  When such is the spirit a=
nimating the great=20

chronicler of the age, it is rather remarkable that we find even three or f=
our women winning such=20

fame as to be remembered. The great war will in time bring forth the greate=
st heroine of France;=20

yet it may be questioned whether Jeanne d'Arc would have received even fair=
 treatment at the=20

hands of Froissart, if the knight-chronicler had lived to see the glory of =
this wonderful peasant girl=20

illumine all France. We may guess that Jeanne the saint, even Jeanne the va=
liant warrior (he=20

loved warriors better than saints), would have been for him but Jeanne the =
peasant, the miserable=20

child of some more miserable Jacques Bonhomme, to whom the courtly chronicl=
er would have=20

referred with contempt, scorn, or brutal hate.  The horrors of war are not =
allowed on the scene in=20

the chronicles from which we draw most of our information about Jeanne de M=
ontfort; but it is=20

pleasant to find in these same pages at least one recognition of the higher=
 and better role of=20

woman, as intercessor for the distressed. We allude, of course, to the famo=
us and beautiful story=20

of Philippa of Hainault saving the citizens of Calais, a story which we sha=
ll venture to sketch once=20

more, in order to bring before our readers a famous character and a famous =
scene in history.  For=20

eight months the English army had lain before Calais, while the king stubbo=
rnly persevered in his=20

determination to reduce the town and the garrison as stubbornly determined =
to resist to the death.=20

Edward had built for his camp a regular town about Calais, and starvation h=

prisals on the part of the=20
