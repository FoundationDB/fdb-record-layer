another round, after he had taken mine.  [Illustration: And we felt like pr=
ize boobs suddenly=20

kidnapped from a tacky party and dropped into a grand ball]  "That's your a=
llowance, sir," said the=20

waitress, and money would buy no more.  He noticed a cube of sugar by his c=
offee cup; that was=20

his allowance of sugar. We went out to lunch. Henry ordered the roast beef =
of old England at the=20

best club in London and got a pink shaving, escorted in by two boiled potat=
oes and a hunk of=20

green cabbage, boiled without salt or pork. And for dessert we had a sugarl=
ess, lardless whole-

wheat-flour tart! It puckered his mouth like a persimmon. It fell to me to =
explain to Mr. H. G. Wells,=20

who gave the luncheon, that Henry had just come from the continent, where h=
e had scorned the=20

food, and one could see from the twinkle in Mr. Wells's eyes that he was go=
ing to put Henry in a=20

book. And he certainly was a hero during those London days--the hero of a g=
reat disillusion. Of=20

course the British cooking was good. The English are splendid cooks, and th=
ey were doing their=20

best; but Henry's picture of the great boar's head triumphantly borne into =
the hall on the shoulders=20

of four stout butlers, and his notion of the blazing plum pudding as large =
as a hassock, and his=20

preconceived idea of England as Dickens's fat boy forever stuffing and goin=
g to sleep again, had=20

to be entirely revised. For if the English are proud of the way they concea=
l the bitterness of their=20

sorrow in this war, also they have a vast pride in the way they are sacrifi=
cing their creature=20

comforts for it. In Latin countries there is more or less special privilege=
. But in England, the law is=20

the law and men glory in its rigours by obeying it in proud self-sacrifice.=
 If our dinners sometimes=20

were Spartan in simplicity we found the talk ample, refreshing and filling.=
 We, however, had some=20

trouble with our "Who's Who." One evening they sat me opposite a handsome m=
ilitary man who=20

talked of airships and things most wonderfully and it took me three odorife=
rous vanilla and=20

festoons of bignonia decorated the entrance; and above, on the summit of th=
e hill, the arrowy=20

branches of the palm-trees waved murmuring in the air. We descended towards=
 the river, to take=20

the road to the mission, where we arrived late in the night. Our imaginatio=
n was struck by all we=20

had just seen. Occupied continually by the present, in a country where the =
traveller is tempted to=20

regard human society as a new institution, he is more powerfully interested=
 by remembrances of=20

times past. These remembrances were not indeed of a distant date; but in al=
l that is monumental=20

antiquity is a relative idea, and we easily confound what is ancient with w=
hat is obscure and=20

problematic. The Egyptians considered the historical remembrances of the Gr=
eeks as very recent.=20

If the Chinese, or, as they prefer calling themselves, the inhabitants of t=
he Celestial Empire, could=20

have communicated with the priests of Heliopolis, they would have smiled at=
 those pretensions of=20

the Egyptians to antiquity. Contrasts not less striking are found in the no=
rth of Europe and of Asia,=20

in the New World, and in every region where the human race has not preserve=
d a long=20

consciousness of itself. The migration of the Toltecs, the most ancient his=
torical event on the=20

tableland of Mexico, dates only in the sixth century of our era. The introd=
uction of a good system=20

of intercalation, and the reform of the calendars, the indispensable basis =
of an accurate=20

chronology, took place in the year 1091. These epochs, which to us appear s=
o modern, fall on=20

fabulous times, when we reflect on the history of our species between the b=
anks of the Orinoco=20

and the Amazon. We there see symbolic figures sculptured on the rocks, but =
no tradition throws=20

light upon their origin. In the hot part of Guiana we can go back only to t=
he period when the=20

Castilian and Portuguese conquerors, and more recently peaceful monks, pene=
trated amid so=20



many barbarous nations.  It appears that to the north of the Cataracts, in =
the strait of Baraguan,=20

there are caverns filled with bones, similar to those I have just described=
: but I=20

learn that he was the authority on air fighting in Europe! He was a Lord of=
 somewhere, and Earl of=20

something and a Duke of somewhat--all rolled into one. Henry hooted at me f=
or two days. But=20

finally he gave me some comfort. "At least," he said, "you are as well-know=
n in London as your=20

Duke's mixture is in Emporia, and London is a our Indian pilots did not men=
tion it when we landed=20

at the strait. These tombs no doubt have given rise to a fable of the Ottom=
acs, according to which=20

the granitic and solitary rocks of Baraguan, the forms of which are very si=
ngular, are regarded as=20

the grandfathers, the ancient chiefs of the tribe. The custom of separating=
 the=20


_
bigger town!" Then it came Henry's turn. At our very grandest dinner they s=
at Henry between Lord=20

Bryce and one of the most distinguished men of contemporary English letters=
. Henry shone that=20

night as he never shone before and when Henry turns on his talk he is a wiz=
ard. Meredith=20

Nicholson, who has heard Henry talk at a dinner, in a recent number of Scri=
bner's magazine, said=20

of him: "He's the best talker I've ever heard. It was delightful to listen =
to discourse so free, so=20

graphic in its characterization, so coloured and flavoured with the very so=
il," and that night at the=20

English dinner, all of Henry's cylinders were hitting and he took every gra=
de without changing=20

gears. But my ears were eager for the man on Henry's right. He told some st=
ories; my neck craned=20

toward them. Henry returned the Scotch stories with Kansas stories and held=
 the table.  Then=20

going home in the taxi Henry, recalling his dinner companion, said: "Bill, =
who was that little man on=20

my left, that man they called from the bones, very anciently practised by t=
he Massagetes, is still=20

known among several hordes of the Orinoco. It is even asserted, and with so=
me probability, that=20

the Guaraons plunge their dead bodies under water enveloped in nets; and th=
at the small caribe-

fishes, of which we saw everywhere an innumerable quantity, devour in a few=
 days the muscular=20

flesh, and thus prepare the skeleton. It may be supposed that this operatio=
n can be practised only=20

in places where crocodiles are not common. Some tribes, for instance the Ta=
manacs, are=20

accustomed to lay waste the fields of a deceased relative, and cut down the=
 trees which he has=20

planted. They say that the sight of objects which belonged to their relatio=
n makes them=20

melancholy. They like better to efface than to preserve remembrances. These=
 effects of Indian=20

sensibility are very detrimental to agriculture, and the monks oppose with =
energy these=20

superstitious practices, to which the natives converted to Christianity sti=
ll adhere in the=20
