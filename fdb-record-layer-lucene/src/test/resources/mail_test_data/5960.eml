 How long is it since=20

dirks were laid aside, because useless, in Scotland? When men cannot appeal=

magistrate, they appeal to themselves. Duels too are another kind of appeal=

[58] "At Manila, therefore, a doctor [of law] is a species of phenomenon, a=
nd many years pass=20

without one of them being seen; in two universities there is no doctor, whi=
le in 1767 there was but=20

one competitor for the doctoral of the cathedral. Yet it must be noted that=
 this competitor was a=20

Mexican, and was not born in Manila. Of what use, therefore, are two univer=
sities in this city?=20

Would not a single one be more than enough? One who knows Latin is greatly =
esteemed keep=20

beyond a few hours, unless partially cooked.  I struck away towards the lef=
t with the intention of=20

making the mangroves as soon as possible, where I knew I should find plenty=
 of birds.  The walk=20

of the day previous had made me a little stiff; but I felt lightly clad, wi=
thout the heavy blanket, which=20

I had left in camp; and, by way of getting rid of the stiffness, I started =
off at a run and soon reached=20

my destination, where I sat down until there was sufficient daylight to ena=
ble me to see the game.=20

As I rested on the root of a tree, perfectly motionless, I saw something la=
rge moving among the=20

mangroves; but the dawn was as yet so uncertain that I could not distinguis=
h whether it was a=20

human being or not.  "If that is a black fellow," I=20

in Manila, because that language is not common there, in spite of the two u=
niversities which I have=20

just mentioned; what is learned in those institutions is very poor, and is =
only imperfectly=20

understood. When I arrived there, a great many persons asked me if I knew L=
atin, and when I=20

answered that I knew a little of it they apparently had after that more res=
pect for me. All the ancient=20

prejudices of the schools seem to have abandoned us of Europe only to take =
refuge at Manila,=20

where certainly they have long remained, for the ancient doctrine is there =
in too good hands to=20

give place to sound ideas of physics. Don Feliciano Marqus often honestly c=
onfessed to me that in=20

Spain they were a hundred years behind France, in the sciences; and that at=
 Manila they were a=20

hundred years behind Spain. One can judge, by that, of the together, and I'=
ll wait quietly to try and=20

capture him," for the object I saw was moving in the direction my companion=
s had taken; and if it=20

were a native, he would be certain to return by the road he had come, when =
he heard the firing.=20

Sitting still, waiting for anything or anybody, when waited on yourself by =
hungry mosquitoes, may=20

be agreeable enough to Mr. Fenimore Cooper's typical Red Indian, but I can =
safely say that it is=20

anything but pleasant work to a thin-skinned Englishman. Daylight had now f=
ully come, and I was=20

beginning to hesitate as to whether I had not better bag some of the birds =
that were fluttering over=20

my head, and get out of the swamp as fast as I could, when I heard the dist=
ant report of a gun,=20

and said to myself, "Well, I'll give the nondescript five minutes more, and=
 if it doesn't turn up by=20


_
two universities. In that city electricity is known only by name, and the H=
oly Office of the Inquisition=20

has prohibited experiments in that line. I knew there a Frenchman, a surgeo=
n by profession, a man=20

of parts and of inquiring mind, who was threatened with blaze away at the p=
igeons."  Half the=20

allotted time had barely elapsed, when another report broke the stillness o=
f the morning, and=20

immediately afterwards I heard a rustling among the mangrove-leaves, and a =
slight crackling, as=20

t really drew upon him=20

this ill-fortune was the experiment of the "little friar." [This simple exp=
eriment in physics was made=20

with a little figure resembling a friar; it had never before been seen in M=
anila, and everybody ran to=20

look at it and laugh.] "This experiment of the surgeon, who made his little=
 friar dance, and=20

sometimes sink to the bottom of the vial by way of correcting him, drew upo=
n him the displeasure=20

of the entire body of religious with whom Manila swarms; there was talk of =
the Holy Office, and it=20

was said that the surgeon's experiment was a case for the Inquisition. The =
surgeon, therefore--

whose only intention in the experiment was to vex the friars who had preven=
ted him from making=20

his experiments in electricity--was compelled to cease his pleasantry, and =
Manila had to express=20

its detestation of the pleasure that it had taken in seeing the experiment.=
" [The author was visited=20

by many people at his roots.  I stayed quiet, almost breathless, as the noi=
se came nearer and=20

nearer, and, turning my head, I peered through the bush behind which I had =
taken up my quarters,=20

and saw a fine-looking black gliding cautiously from one to another of the =
interlaced mangroves.=20

He was evidently quite unsuspicious of any danger in front, and kept all hi=
s faculties concentrated=20

on the direction in which he had heard the carbine-shots, which now followe=
d each other rapidly,=20

as the two gunners fired at the birds as fast as they could load.  "Now," t=
hought I, "if I can only cut=20

you off so as to keep you between me and them, I am pretty certain to captu=
re you, my friend;"=20

and, judging my time, I rushed from behind my bush, and was within ten yard=
s of him before he=20

saw me.  In his amazement he dropped the long fish-spear with which he was =
armed, stood one=20

moment undetermined, and then made his way, with the greatest agility, from=
 tree to tree, not back=20

towards my friends, as I had fondly hoped, but straight for=20
