based the week of the Jews and the septenary Hierarchies of the Lord of Hosts.    Sounds.   _Q. 

Sound is an attribute of Akasha; but we cannot cognize anything on the Akashic plane; on what 

plane then do we recognize sound? On what plane is sound produced by the physical contact of 

bodies? Is there sound on seven planes, and is the physical plane one of them?_  _A._ The 

physical plane is one of them. You cannot see Akasha, but you can sense it from the Fourth Path. 

You may not be fully conscious of it, and yet you may sense it. Akasha is at the root of the  There 

was no more to be had in Saint Germain. This foraging did not occupy more than half an hour. 

Mousqueton, duly instructed, was put at the head of this sudden and new business. He was 

cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss, and they intrusted to him 

straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis. D'Artagnan, taking with him three trusses of 

straw, returned to the chateau, where everybody, freezing with cold and more than half asleep, 

envied the king, the queen, and the Duke of Orleans, on their camp beds. The lieutenant's 

entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing-room; but he did not appear 


_
sounds. Sound is the expression and manifestation of that which is behind it, and which is the 

parent of many correlations. All Nature is a sounding-board; or rather Akasha is the sounding-

board of Nature. It is the Deity, the one Life, the one Existence. (Hearing is the vibration of 

molecular particles; the order is seen in the sentence, "The disciple feels, hears, sees.")  Sound 

can have no end. H. P. B. remarked with regard to a tap made by a pencil on the table: "By this 

time it has affected the whole universe. The particle which has had its wear and tear destroys 

something which passes into something else. It is eternal in the Nidanas it produces." A sound, if 

not previously produced on the Astral Plane, and before that on the Akashic, could not be 

produced at all. Akasha is the bridge between nerve cells and mental powers.  _Q. __"__Colours 

are psychic, and sounds are spiritual.__"__ What, assuming that these are vibrations, is the 

successive order (these corresponding to sight and hearing) of the other senses?_  _A._ This 

phrase was not to be taken out of its context, otherwise confusion would arise. All are on all 

planes. The First Race had touch all over like a sounding board; this touch differentiated into the 

other senses, which developed with the Races. The "sense" of the First Race was that of touch, 

meaning the power of their atoms to vibrate in unison with external atoms. The "touch" would be 

almost the same as sympathy.  The senses were on a different plane with each Race; _e.g._, the 

Fourth Race had very much more developed senses than general attention, but began to arrange, 

with so much cleverness, nicety and gayety, his straw bed, that the mouths of all these poor 

creatures, who could not go to sleep, began to water.  "Straw!" they all cried out, "straw! where is 

there any to be found?"  "I can show you," answered the Gascon.  And he conducted them to 

Mousqueton, who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece. It was thought rather 

dear, but people wanted to sleep, and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours 

of sound sleep?  D'Artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it, making it over about a 

dozen times; and since he was supposed to have paid, like the others, a louis for his truss of 

straw, he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour. At five o'clock in the morning 

the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had.  D'Artagnan had taken 

the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use. He put in his pocket the key of the room 

where he had hidden them, and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton, 

who, naively, and like the worthy steward that he was, handed them four hundred and thirty louis 

and kept one hundred for himself.  Mousqueton, who knew nothing of what was going on in the 

chateau, wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner. D'Artagnan put the gold in his 

hat, and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos, each of them had cleared 

two hundred and fifteen louis.  Porthos, however, found that he had no straw left for himself. He

plane. It was also a very material Race. The sixth and seventh senses will merge into the Akashic 

Sound. "It depends to what degree of matter the sense of touch relates itself as to what we call it." 

Prana.   _Q. Is Prana the production of the countless __"__lives__"__ of the human repaired to 

D'Artagnan, who, thanks to his four trusses of straw, was in the act of making up and tasting, by 

anticipation, the luxury of a bed so soft, so well stuffed at the head, so well covered at the foot, 

that it would have excited the envy of the king himself, if his majesty 


_
body, and therefore, to some extent, of the congeries of the cells or atoms of the body?_  _A._ No; 

Prana is the parent of the "lives." As an example, a sponge may be immersed in an ocean. The 

water in the sponge's interior may be compared to Prana; outside is Jiva. Prana is the motor-

principle in life. The "lives" leave Prana; Prana does not leave not been fast asleep in his own. 

D'Artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos, but for a 

consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it, he consented that Porthos should share his 

couch with him. He laid his sword at the head, his pistols by his side, stretched his cloak over his 

feet, placed his 


_
from the water, and it becomes dry, thus symbolizing death. Every principle is a differentiation of 

Jiva, but the life-motion in each is Prana, the "breath of life." Kama depends on Prana, without 

which there would be no Kama. Prana wakes the Kamic germs to life; it makes all desires vital and 

living.    The Second Spinal Cord.   _Q. With reference to the answer to the hat on the top of his 

cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw, which rustled under him. He was already 

enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis, 

made in a quarter of an hour, when a voice was heard at the door of the hall, which made him stir. 

"Monsieur d'Artagnan!" it cried.  "Here!" cried Porthos, "here!"
