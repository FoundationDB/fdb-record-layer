But that efficient labor was out of the question now. The tunnel camp was a=
 deserted place.=20

"Come on, Koku, we'll go hunting," said Tom one day.  "There's no use hangi=
ng around here, and=20

some venison wouldn't go bad on the table."  "I'll come, too," said Mr. Dam=
on. "I haven't anything=20

to do."  The Titus brothers had gone to a distant village, on the forlorn h=
ope of getting laborers, so=20

Tom was left to his own devices, and he decided to go hunting with his elec=
tric rifle.  The taruco, or=20

native deer, had been plentiful in the vicinity of the tunnel until the pre=
sence of so many men and=20

the frequent blasts had driven them farther off, and it was not until after=
 a tramp of several miles=20

that Tom saw one.  Then, after stalking it a little way, he managed to kill=
 it with the electric rifle.=20

Koku hoisted the animal to his big shoulders, and, as this would provide me=
at enough for some=20

time, Tom started back for camp.  As he and Mr. Damon, with Koku in the rea=
r, passed through a=20

little clearing, they saw, on the far side, a native hut.  And from it rush=
ed a woman, who=20

approached Tom, casting herself on her knees, while she pressed his free ha=
nd to her head.=20

"Bless my scarf pin!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "What does this mean, Tom?"  "Oh=
, this is the mother=20

of the child I saved from the condor," said  And so the curious episode cal=
led "The Planting of the=20

Leaden Plates" began.     {181}  CHAPTER XII  THE ACADIANS ARE BANISHED FRO=

The French had really no grounds for their claims to sovereignty over the v=
alley of the Ohio except=20

in the explorations of La Salle in the previous century.  All the country s=
outh of Lake Erie was=20

almost unknown to the French Canadians.  The regions in the vicinity of the=
 Ohio River were=20

generally regarded as belonging to the English colonies of Pennsylvania, Vi=
rginia, and New York.=20

If you will look at the old maps of America, you will see that the map-make=
rs never gave any=20

boundary-line on the west of the thirteen colonies.  There was no boundary-=
line.  At this time, as=20

was said in the last chapter, English traders had crossed the Alleghany Mou=
ntains on their fur-

trading expeditions, and the Indians, in turn, had visited the people livin=
g in the three provinces I=20

have named.  But Galissonire had a special reason for wanting the whole Ohi=
o valley in French=20

possession.  Canada and Acadia were not the only French colonies on the Nor=
th American=20

continent.  Far to the south there was Louisiana, which since La Salle's ti=
me had grown and=20

flourished exceedingly.  A Canadian, De Bienville, one of the sons of Charl=
es le Moine, had even=20

been {182} sent to govern it.  So, you see, it was of the utmost importance=
 to the French way of=20

thinking that Canada and=20

baby?" he asked in the Indian tongue, for he was a fair master of it by now=
.  "The baby is well. Will=20

the mighty hunter permit himself to enter my miserable hovel and partake of=
 some milk and=20

cakes?"  "What do you say, Mr. Damon?" Tom asked. "She's clean and neat, an=
d she makes a=20

drink of goat's milk that isn't bad.  She bakes some kind of meal cakes tha=
t are good, too. I'm=20

hungry."  "All right, Tom, I'll do as you say."  A little later they were p=
artaking of a rude, but none=20

the less welcome, lunch in the woman's hut, while the baby whose life Tom h=
ad saved cooed in=20

the rough log cradle.  "Say, Masni," asked Tom, addressing the woman by nam=
e, "don't you know=20

where we can get some men to work the tunnel?" Of course Tom spoke the Fren=
ch flag.  It would=20

be fatal for Louisiana to be cut off from Canada by English colonies, or ev=
en forts and trading=20

posts.  For this reason Galissonire now set about proclaiming French sovere=
ignty over the entire=20

Ohio valley, as this region was called.  In the French service there was a =
captain named Clron, a=20

Chevalier of the Order of St. Louis.  This officer the Government despatche=
d in the summer of=20

1749 with a small force of some 200 French soldiers, Canadian bushrangers, =
and Indians.  With=20

him Clron carried a large stock of leaden plates with engraved inscriptions=
.  These plates were=20

eleven inches long and seven and a half inches wide, and Clron was ordered =
to bury them at the=20

foot of certain trees marking=20
