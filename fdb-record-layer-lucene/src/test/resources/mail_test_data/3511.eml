dracaena marginata in felling them for timber, they will last a long time a=

marginata in felling them for timber, they will last a long time and be ver=
y useful in buildings.  5. Trees vary and are unlike one another in their q=
ualities. Thus it is with the oak, elm, poplar, cypress, fir, and the other=
s which are most suitable to use in abroad.... Why should you live here and=
 waste your golden days? You are young, wealthy, and healthy.... Yes.... Ah=
, if I were younger I would whisk away like a hare, and snap my fingers at =
everything."  III  My wife's outburst reminded me of our _
accommodations within the city walls being thus multiplied as a result of t=
he many floors high in=20

the air, the Roman people easily find excellent places in which to live.  1=
8. It has now been=20

explained how limitations of building space necessarily forbid the employme=
nt of brick walls within=20

the city. When it becomes necessary to use them outside the city, they shou=
ld be constructed as=20

follows in order to be perfect and durable. On the top of the wall lay a st=
ructure of burnt brick,=20

about a foot and a half in height, under the tiles and projecting like a co=
ping. Thus the defects=20

usual in these walls can be avoided. For when the tiles on the roof are bro=
ken or thrown down by=20

the wind so that rainwater can leak through, this burnt brick coating will =
prevent the crude brick=20

from being damaged, and the cornice-like projection will throw off the drop=
s beyond the vertical=20

face, and thus the walls, though of crude brick structure, will be preserve=
d intact.  19. With regard=20

to burnt brick, nobody can tell offhand whether it is of the best or unfit =
to use in a wall, because its=20

strength can be tested only after it has been used on a roof and exposed to=
 bad weather and time-

-then, if it is good it is accepted. If not made of good clay or if not bak=
ed sufficiently, it shows itself=20

defective there when exposed to frosts and rime. Brick that will not stand =
exposure on roofs can=20

never be strong enough to carry its load in a wall. Hence the strongest bur=
nt brick walls are those=20

which are constructed out of old roofing tiles.  20. As for "wattle and dau=
b" I could wish that it had=20

never been invented. The more it saves in time and gains in space, the grea=
ter and the more=20

general is the disaster that it may cause; for it is made to catch fire, li=
ke torches. It seems better,=20

therefore, to spend on walls of burnt brick, and be at expense, than to sav=
e with "wattle and daub,"=20

and be in danger. And, in the stucco covering, too, it makes cracks from th=
e inside by the=20

arrangement of its studs and girts. For these swell with moisture as they a=
re daubed, and then=20

contract as they dry, and, by their shrinking, cause the solid stucco to sp=
lit. But since some are=20

obliged to use it either to save time or money, or for partitions on an uns=
upported span, the proper=20

method of construction is as and how many people they ruined! Yes... Why, o=
ver the affair at the=20

Klotchkovs' tavern eleven men were sent to the disciplinary battalion. Yes.=
... And now, look, it's the=20

same thing. Anisyin, the investigating magistrate, stayed the night with me=
 last Thursday, and he=20

told me about some landowner.... Yes.... They took the wall of his barn to =
pieces at night and=20

carried off twenty sacks of rye. When the gentleman heard that such a crime=
 had been committed,=20

he sent a telegram to the Governor and another to the police captain, anoth=
er to the investigating=20

magistrate!... Of course, every one is afraid of a man who is fond of litig=
ation. The authorities were=20

in a flutter and there was a general hubbub. Two villages were searched."  =
"Excuse me, Ivan=20

Ivanitch," I said. "Twenty sacks of rye were stolen from me, and it was I w=
ho telegraphed to the=20

Governor. I telegraphed to Petersburg, too. But it was by no means out of l=
ove for litigation, as you=20

are pleased to express it, and not because I bore them a grudge. I look at =
every subject from the=20

point of view of principle. From the point of view of the law, theft is the=
 same whether a man is=20

hungry or not."  "Yes, yes..." muttered Ivan Ivanitch in confusion. "Of cou=
rse... To be sure, yes."=20

Natalya Gavrilovna blushed.  "There are people..." she said and stopped; sh=
e made an effort to=20

seem indifferent, but she could not keep it up, and looked into my eyes wit=
h the hatred that I know=20

so well. "There are people," she said, "for whom famine and human suffering=
 exist simply that they=20

may vent their hateful and despicable temperaments upon them."  I was confu=
sed and shrugged=20

my shoulders.  "I meant to say generally," she went on, "that there are peo=
ple who are quite=20

indifferent and completely devoid of all feeling of sympathy, yet who do no=
t pass human suffering=20



by, but insist on meddling for fear people should be able to do without the=
m. Nothing is sacred for=20

their vanity."  "There are people," I said softly, "who have an angelic cha=
racter, but who express=20

their glorious ideas in such a form that it is difficult to distinguish the=
 angel from an Odessa=20

market-woman."  I must confess it was not happily expressed.  My wife looke=
d at me as though it=20

cost her a great effort to hold her tongue. Her sudden outburst, and then h=
er=20


_
it a high foundation so that it may nowhere come in contact with the broken=
 stone-work composing=20

the floor; for if it is sunk in this, it rots in course of time, then settl=
es and sags forward, and so=20

breaks through the surface of the stucco covering.  I have now explained to=
 the best of my ability=20

the subject of walls, and the preparation of the different kinds of materia=
l employed, with their=20

advantages and disadvantages. Next, following the guidance of Nature, I sha=
ll treat of the=20

framework and the kinds of wood used in it, showing how they may be procure=
d of a sort that will=20

not give way as time goes on.     CHAPTER IX  TIMBER   1. Timber should be =
felled between=20

early Autumn and the time when Favonius begins to blow. For in Spring all t=
rees become=20

pregnant, and they are all employing their natural vigour in the production=
 of leaves and of the=20

fruits that return every year. The requirements of that season render them =
empty and swollen, and=20

so they are weak and feeble because of their looseness of texture. This is =
also the case with=20

women who have conceived. Their bodies are not considered perfectly healthy=
 until the child is=20

born; hence, pregnant slaves, when subject of my desire to help the famine-=
stricken peasants,=20

were, to say the least, out of place; when I had invited her to come upstai=
rs I had expected quite a=20

different attitude to me and my intentions. I cannot say definitely what I =
had expected, but I had=20

been agreeably agitated by the expectation. Now I saw that to go on speakin=
g about the famine=20

would be difficult and perhaps stupid.  "Yes..." Ivan Ivanitch muttered ina=
ppropriately. "Burov, the=20

merchant, must have four hundred thousand at least. I said to him: 'Hand ov=
er one or two=20

thousand to the famine. You can't take it with you when you die, anyway.' H=
e was offended. But=20

we all have to die, you know. Death is not a potato."  A silence followed a=
gain.  "So there's nothing=20

left for me but to reconcile myself to loneliness," I sighed. "One cannot f=
ight single-handed. Well, I=20

will try single-handed. Let us hope that my campaign against the famine wil=
l be more successful=20

than my campaign against indifference."  "I am expected downstairs," said N=
atalya Gavrilovna.=20

She got up from the table and turned to Ivan Ivanitch.  "So you will look i=
n upon me downstairs for=20

a minute? I won't say good-bye to you."  And she went=20


_
are not warranted sound, because the fetus as it grows within the body take=
s to itself as=20

nourishment all the best qualities of the mother's food, and so the stronge=
r it becomes as the full=20

time for birth approaches, the less compact it allows that body to be from =
which it is produced.=20

After the birth of the child, what was heretofore taken to promote the grow=
th of another creature is=20

now set free by the delivery of the newborn, and the channels being now emp=
ty and open, the=20

body will take it in by lapping up its juices, and thus becomes compact and=
 returns to the natural=20

strength which it had before.  2. On the same principle, with the ripening =
of the fruits in Autumn the=20

leaves begin to wither and the trees, taking up their sap from the earth th=
rough the roots,  Ivan=20

Ivanitch was now drinking his seventh glass of tea, choking, smacking his l=
ips, and sucking=20

sometimes his moustache, sometimes the lemon. He was muttering something dr=
owsily and=20

listlessly, and I did not listen but waited for him to go. At last, with an=
 expression that suggested=20

that he had only come to me to take a cup of tea, he got up and began to ta=
ke leave. As I saw him=20

out I said:  "And so you have given me no advice."  "Eh? I am a feeble, stu=
pid old man," he=20

answered. "What use would my advice be? You shouldn't worry yourself.... I =
really don't know why=20

you worry yourself. Don't disturb yourself, my dear fellow! Upon my word, t=
here's no need," he=20

whispered genuinely and affectionately, soothing me as though I were a chil=
d. "Upon my word,=20

there's no=20


_
solid texture. But the strong air of winter compresses and solidifies them =
during the time above=20

mentioned. Consequently, if the timber is felled on the principle and at th=
e time above mentioned,=20

it will be felled at the proper season.  3. In felling a tree we should cut=
 into the trunk of it to the very=20

heart, and then leave it standing so that the sap may drain out drop by dro=
p throughout the whole=20

of it. In this way the useless liquid which is within will run out through =
the sapwood instead of=20

having to die in a mass of decay, thus spoiling the quality of the timber. =
Then  "No need? Why, the=20

peasants are pulling the thatch off their huts, and they say there is typhu=
s somewhere already."=20

"Well, what of it? If there are good crops next year, they'll thatch them a=
gain, and if we die of=20

typhus others will live after us. Anyway, we have to die--if not now, later=
. Don't worry yourself, my=20

dear."  "I can't help worrying myself," I said irritably.  We were standing=
 in the dimly lighted=20

vestibule. Ivan Ivanitch suddenly took me by the elbow, and, preparing to s=
ay something evidently=20

very important, looked at me in silence for a couple of minutes.=20


_
till then, the tree being drained dry and the sap no longer dripping, let i=
t be felled and it will be in=20

the highest state of usefulness.  4. That this is so may be seen in the cas=
e of fruit trees. When=20

these are tapped at the base and pruned, each at the proper time, they pour=
 out from the heart=20

through the and dark eyes there was a gleam of the expression for which he =
had once been=20

famous and which was truly charming. "Pavel Andreitch, I speak to you as a =
friend: try to be=20

different! One is ill at ease with you, my dear fellow, one really is!"  He=
 looked intently into my face;=20

the charming expression faded away,=20


_
corrupting fluid which they contain, and thus the draining process makes th=
em durable. But when=20

the juices of trees have no means of escape, they clot and rot in them, mak=
ing the trees hollow=20

and good for nothing. Therefore, if the draining process does not exhaust t=
hem while they are still=20

alive, there is no doubt that, if the eyes grew dim again, and he sniffed a=
nd muttered feebly:  "Yes,=20

yes.... Excuse an old man.... It's all nonsense... yes."  As he slowly desc=
ended the staircase,=20

spreading out his hands to balance himself and showing me his huge, bulky b=
ack and red neck, he=20

gave me the unpleasant impression of a sort of crab.  "You ought to go away=
,=20
