together in order to make four. The chartering of a smuggler's craft--aristos on board her--her 

ostensible destination Holland--her real objective Le Croisic.... Le Croisic is now the port seized 

Old Peg, but there was nothing hysterical in her nature.  Calm, cool, calculating courage 

dominated her every thought and feeling, but the idea of what she was driven to in her old age had 

tickled her fancy. Leading the big cart-horse close up to a bank, she prepared to mount

for the object of providing them with a feather-bed and a competence, what?"  "And," retorted 

Martin-Roget quietly, "if your surmises are correct, citizen Chauvelin, what then?"  "Oh, nothing!" 

replied the other indifferently. "Only ... take care, citizen ... that is all."  "Take care of what?"  "Of 

the man who brought me, Chauvelin, to ruin and disgrace."  "Oh! I have heard of that legend 

before now," said Martin-Roget with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. "The man they call 

the Scarlet Pimpernel you mean?"  "Why, yes!"  "What have I to do with him?"  "I neighbouring

lady's position on horseback by sight, of course, but not by practice.  To attempt it even with a 

side-saddle would have been impossible; but Elephant was barebacked.  Fortunately he was fat 

and broad, and without a visible back-bone.  Old Peg at once made up her mind, and, climbing the 

bank, scrambled on his back in gentleman's position.  It was more comfortable than she had dared 

to hope.  But now an unexpected difficulty met her.  Elephant declined to move!

here in England; that twice he slipped through my fingers when I thought I held him so tightly that 

he could not possibly escape and that twice in consequence I was brought to humiliation and to 

shame. I am a marked man now--the guillotine will soon claim me for her future use. Your affairs, 

citizen, are no concern of mine, but I have marked that Scarlet Pimpernel for mine own. I won't 

have any blunderings on your part give him yet She pulled at his bridle, and he turned sluggishly, 

but he would not advance.  Peg administered a sounding whack with the switch.  She might as 

well have hit a neighbouring tree.  Elephant's hide was like that of his namesake, and he had no 

feelings to speak of that could be touched, or hurt, or worked upon.  In this dilemma the old 

woman had recourse to a weapon with which her broad bosom was at all times furnished.  She 

drew a large

Once more Martin-Roget swore one of his favourite oaths.  "By Satan and all his brood, man," he 

cried in a passion of fury, "have done with this interference. Have done, I say. I have nothing to do, 

I tell you, with your _satane_ Scarlet Pimpernel. My concern is with...."  "With the duc de 

Kernogan," broke in Chauvelin calmly, "and with his daughter; I know that well enough. You want 

to be even with them over the murder of your father. I know that too. All that is your affair. But 

beware, I tell you. To begin with, the secrecy of your identity is absolutely essential to the success 

of your plan. What?"  "Of the point into Elephant's flank.  The result was instantaneous.  Up went 

his hindquarters, and Peg found herself sprawling on his bushy mane. She held on to that, 

however, and, gradually working her way back, regained her old position--thankful that she had 

not been thrown to the ground.  Another result was that Elephant condescended to walk.  But this 

was not enough.  Escape at such a pace was impossible.  Old Peg prodded him again--this time 

on the shoulder, for she rightly conjectured that he could not well kick up with his fore-legs.  But he 

might rear!  The thought caused her to grasp the bushy mane with

"But nevertheless, your identity is known to the most astute, the keenest enemy of the Republic." 

"Impossible," asserted Martin-Roget hotly.  "The duc de Kernogan...."  "Bah! He had never the 

slightest suspicion of me. Think you his High and Mightiness in those far-off days ever looked 

twice at a village lad so that he would know him again four years later? I came into this He did not 

rear, but he trotted, and poor Old Peg came to the conclusion that there were disagreeable 

novelties in life, even for her.  When Elephant at length burst out of the fringe of wood and gained 

the track that followed the course of the river, she was immediately seen by the plunderers, who 

laughed at the strange rider but did not follow her, with the exception of one
