ery Buddha, and=20

there are _six_ Bhikshus and but one Buddha in each mendicant. What       a=
re the _seven_? The=20

seven branches of complete knowledge. What are       the _six_? The six org=
ans of sense. What=20

are the five? The five       elements of illusive being. And the One which =
is also ten? He is a=20

true Buddha who develops in him the ten forms of holiness and       subject=
s them all to the One."=20

Which means that every principle in       the Buddha was the highest that c=
ould be evolved on this=20

earth;       whereas in the case of other men who attain to Nirvana this is=
 not       necessarily the=20

case. Even as a mere human (Manushya) Buddha Gautama       was a pattern fo=
r all men. But his=20

Arhats were not necessarily so.    671 See _Isis Unveiled_, ii., 132.    67=

Buddha he must be a Bodhisattva; before       evolving into a Bodhisattva h=
e must be a Dhyani-

Buddha.... A       Bodhisattva is the way and Path to his Father, and thenc=
e to the One=20

Supreme Essence" (_Descent of Buddhas_, p. 17, from Aryasanga). "I       am=
 the Way, the Truth,=20

and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father       but by me" (_St. John_, x=
iv. 6). The "way" is not=20

the goal. Nowhere       throughout the _New Testament_ is Jesus found calli=
ng himself God,       or=20

anything higher than "a son of God," the son of a "Father" common       to =
all, synthetically. Paul=20

never said (I. _Tim._, iii. 10), "God       was manifest in the flesh," but=
 "He who was manifested in=20

the flesh"       (Revised Edition). While the common herd among the Buddhis=
ts--the       Burmese=20

especially--regard Jesus as an incarnation of Devadatta, a       relative w=
ho opposed the teachings=20

of Buddha, the students of       Esoteric Philosophy see in the Nazarene Sa=
ge a Bodhisattva with=20

eel, the precious stone,=20

the       royal consort, the best treasurer, the best horse, the elephant, =
the       best leader." After=20

this one can little wonder if "besides a Dhyani-       Buddhi and a Dhyani-=
Bodhisattva" each human=20

Buddha is furnished with       "a female companion, a Shakti"--when in trut=
h "Shakti" is simply the=20

Soul-power, the psychic energy of the God as of the Adept. The       "royal=
 consort," the third of the=20

"seven precious gifts," very       likely led the learned Orientalist into =
this ludicrous error.    677 A=20

Bodhisattva can reach Nirvana and live, as Buddha did, and after       deat=
h he can either refuse=20

objective reincarnation or accept and use       it at his convenience for t=

whom he can       instruct in various ways while he remains in the Devachan=
ic regions       within=20

Nirvana without remains"-

-the highest Dharmakaya       condition, in which state he remains entirely=
 outside of every=20

earthly condition--he will return no more until the commencement of a      =
 new Manvantara, since=20

he has crossed beyond the cycle of births.    678 Tulpa is the voluntary in=
carnation of an Adept=20

into a living body,       whether of an adult, child, or new-born babe.    =
679 Ku-sum is the triple form=20

of the Nirvana state and its respective       duration in the "cycle of Non=
-Being." The number seven=20

here refers       to the seven Rounds of our septenary System.    680 _Budd=
hism in Tibet_, p. 52.=20

This same generic use of a name is found       among Hindus with that of Sh=
ankaracharya, to take=20

but one instance.       All His successors bear his name, but are not reinc=
arnations of Him.       So=20

with the "Buddhas."    681 [The words within brackets are supplied to intro=
duce the following=20

statements that are confused and contradictory as they stand, and       whi=
ch H. P. B. had probably=20



intended to Gascon anxious.  "Come, come," cried D'Artagnan, "we must finis=
h with this," and in=20

his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard, who continued to lose ground, but eviden=
tly on purpose and=20

without letting his sword leave the line for a moment. However, as they wer=
e fighting in a room and=20

had not space to go on like that forever, Mordaunt's foot at last touched t=
he wall, against which he=20

rested his left hand.  "Ah, this time you cannot lose ground, my fine frien=
d!" exclaimed D'Artagnan.=20

"Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall? No. Well, then, y=
ou shall see it now."=20

In a second D'Artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt, all of =
which touched, but only=20

pricked him. The three friends looked on, panting and astonished. At last D=
'Artagnan, having got=20

up too close, stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust, but the moment when,=
 after a fine, quick=20

feint, he was attacking as sharply as lightning, the wall seemed to give wa=
y, Mordaunt=20

disappeared through the opening, and D'Artagnan's blade, caught between the=
 panels, shivered=20

like a sword of glass. D'Artagnan sprang back; the wall had closed again.  =
Mordaunt, in fact, while=20

defending himself, had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which C=
romwell had left,=20

had felt for the knob with his left hand, pressed it and disappeared.  The =
Gascon uttered a furious=20

imprecation, which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the ir=
on panel.  "Help me,=20

gentlemen," cried D'Artagnan, "we must break in this door."  "It is the dev=
il in person!" said Aramis,=20

hastening forward.  "He escapes us," growled Porthos, pushing his huge shou=
lder against the=20

hinges, but in vain. "'Sblood! he escapes us."  "So much the better," mutte=
red Athos.  "I thought as=20

much," said D'Artagnan, wasting his strength in useless efforts. "Zounds, I=
 thought as much when=20

the wretch kept moving around the room. I thought he was up to something." =
 "It's a misfortune, to=20

which his friend, the devil, treats us," said Aramis.  "It's a piece of goo=
d fortune sent from Heaven,"=20

said Athos, evidently much relieved.  "Really!" said D'Artagnan, abandoning=
 the attempt to burst=20

open the panel after several ineffectual attempts, "Athos, I cannot imagine=
 how you can talk to us=20

in that way. You cannot understand the position we are in. In this kind of =
game, not to kill is to let=20

one's self be killed. This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iro=
n-sided beasts who will=20

pick us off like sparrows in this place. Come, come, we must be off. If we =
stay here five minutes=20

more there's an end of us."  "Yes, you are right."  "But where shall we go?=
" asked Porthos.  "To=20

the hotel, to be sure, to get our baggage and horses; and from there, if it=
 please God, to France,=20

where, at least, I understand the architecture of the houses."  So, suiting=
 the action to the word,=20

D'Artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard, picked up his=
 hat and ran down the=20

stairs, followed by the others.     70. The Skiff "Lightning."   D'Artagnan=
 had judged correctly;=20

Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose, and he lost none. He knew the ra=
pidity of decision and=20

action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to=
 that. This time the=20

musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them.  After closing the door=
 carefully behind=20

him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage, sheathing on the way his=
 now useless sword,=20

and thus reached the neighboring house, where he paused to examine himself =
and to take breath.=20

"Good!" he said, "nothing, almost nothing--scratches, nothing more; two in =
the arm and one in the=20

breast. The wounds that I make are better than that--witness the executione=
r of Bethune, my uncle=20

and King Charles. Now, not a second to lose, for a second lost will perhaps=
 save them. They must=20

die--die all together--killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in defaul=
t of God's. They must=20

disappear, broken, scattered, annihilated. I will run, then, till my legs n=
o longer serve, till my heart=20

bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do."  Mordaunt proceeded a=
t a rapid pace to the=20



nearest cavalry barracks, about a quarter of a league distant. He made that=
 quarter of a league in=20

four or five=20


_
extent, as they are written two or three times with different       sentenc=
es following them. The MS.=20

is exceedingly confused, and       everything H. P. B. said is here pieced =
together, the addition=20

above       made being marked in brackets to distinguish it from hers.--A. =
B.]    682 King=20

Suddhodana.    683 There are several names marked simply by asterisks.    6=
84 Shankaracharya=20

died also at thirty-two years of age, or rather       disappeared from the =
sight of his disciples, as the=20

legend goes.    685 Does "Tiani-Tsang" stand for Apollonius of Tyana? This =
is a simple=20

surmise. Some things in the life of that Adept would seem to tally       wi=
th the hypothesis--others=20

to go against it.    686 According to Esoteric teaching Buddha lived one hu=
ndred years in=20

reality, though having reached Nirvana in his eightieth year he took the be=
st horse in the stables,=20

mounted and gained the high road. A quarter of an hour later he was at Gree=
nwich.  "There is the=20

port," he murmured. "That dark point yonder is the Isle of Dogs. Good! I am=
 half an hour in=20

advance of them, an hour, perhaps. Fool that I was! I have almost killed my=
self by my needless=20

haste. Now," he added, rising in the stirrups and looking about him, "which=
, I wonder, is the=20

Lightning?"  At this moment, as if in reply to his words, a man lying on a =
coil of cables rose and=20

advanced a few steps toward him. Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pock=
et, and tying a knot=20

at each corner--the signal agreed upon--waved it in the air and the man cam=
e up to him. He was=20

wrapped in a large rough cape, which concealed his form and partly his face=
.  "Do you wish to go=20

on the water, sir?" said the sailor.  "Yes, just=20

regarded as one dead to the world of the living. See article       "Shakyam=
uni's Place in History" in=20

_Five Years of Theosophy_.    687 It is a _secret_ rite, pertaining to high=
 Initiation, and has the=20

same significance as the one to which Clement of Alexandria alludes       w=
hen he speaks of "the=20

token of recognition being in common with us,       as by cutting off Chris=
t" (Strom., 13).=20

Schlagintweit wonders what       it may be. "The typical representation of =
a hermit," he says, "is=20

always that of a man with long, uncut hair and beard.... A rite very       =
often selected, though I am=20

unable to state for what reason, is that       of Chod ('to cut' or 'to des=
troy') the meaning of which is=20

anxiously       kept a profound secret by the Lamas." (_Buddhism in Tibet_,=
 p. 163.)    688 Hlun-

Chub is the divining spirit in man, the highest degree of       seership.  =
  689 The secret meaning of=20

this sentence is that Karma exercises its sway       over the Adept as much=
 as over any other man;=20

"Gods" can escape it       as little as simple mortals. The Adept who, havi=
ng reached the Path=20

and won His Dharmakaya--the Nirvana from which there is no return       unt=
il the new grand=20

Kalpa--prefers to use His right of choosing a       condition inferior to t=
hat which belongs to Him, but=20

that will leave       him free to return whenever He thinks it advisable an=
d under       whatever=20

personality He may select, must be prepared to take all the       chances o=
f failure--possibly--and a=20

lower condition than was His       lot--for a certainty--as it is an occult=
 law. Karma alone is absolute=20

justice and infallible in its selections. He who uses his rights       with=
 it (Karma) must bear the=20

consequences--if any. Thus Buddha's       first reincarnation was produced =
by Karma--and it led=20

Him higher than       ever; the two following were "out of pity" and * * *.=
    690 The Universe of=20

Brahma (Sien-Chan; Nam-Kha) is Universal Illusion,       or our phenomenal =
world.    691 Akasha.=20

It is next to impossible to render the mystic word "Tho-og"       by any ot=
her term than "Space," and=20

yet, unless coined on purpose,        "And perhaps you have a preference fo=
r one boat more than=20

another. You would like one that sails as rapidly as----"  "Lightning," int=
errupted Mordaunt.  "Then=20

mine is the boat you want, sir. I'm your man."  "I begin to think so, parti=
cularly if you have not=20

forgotten a certain signal."  "Here it is, sir," and the sailor took from h=
is coat a handkerchief, tied at=20

each corner.  "Good, quite right!" cried Mordaunt, springing off his horse.=
 "There's not a moment to=20

lose; now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel." =
 "But," asked the=20

sailor, "where are your companions? I thought there were four of you."  "Li=
sten to me, sir. I'm not=20

the man you take me for; you are in Captain Rogers's post, are you not? und=
er orders from=20

General Cromwell. Mine, also, are from him!"  "Indeed, sir, I recognize you=
; you are Captain=20

Mordaunt."  Mordaunt was startled.  "Oh, fear nothing," said the skipper, s=
howing his face. "I am a=20

friend."  "Captain Groslow!" cried Mordaunt.  "Himself. The general remembe=
red that I had=20

formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition=
. Is there anything=20

new in the wind?"  "Nothing."  "I thought, perhaps, that the king's death--=
--"  "Has only hastened=20

their flight; in ten minutes they will perhaps be here."  "What have you co=
me for, then?"  "To=20

embark with you."  "Ah! ah! the general doubted my fidelity?"  "No, but I w=
ish to have a share in=20

my revenge. Haven't you some one who will relieve me of my horse?"  Groslow=
 whistled and a=20

sailor appeared.  "Patrick," said Groslow, "take this horse to the stables =
of the nearest inn. If any=20

one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman.=
"  The sailor departed=20

without reply.  "Now," said Mordaunt, "are you not afraid that they will re=
cognize you?"  "There is=20

no danger, dressed as I am in this pilot coat, on a night as dark as this. =
Besides even you didn't=20

recognize me; they will be much less likely to."  "That is true," said Mord=
aunt, "and they will be far=20



from thinking of you. Everything is ready, is it not?"  "Yes."  "The cargo =
on board?"  "Yes."  "Five=20

full casks?"  "And fifty empty ones."=20


_
Occultist. The term "Aditi" is also translated "Space," and there is       =
a world of meaning in it.=20

692 Dang-ma, a purified soul, and Lha, a freed spirit within a living      =
 body; an Adept or Arhat. In=20

the popular opinion in Tibet, a Lha is a       disembodied spirit, somethin=
g similar to the Burmese=20

Nat--only       higher.    693 Kwan-yin is a synonym, for in the original a=
nother term is used, but=20

the meaning is identical. It is the divine voice of Self, or the       "Spi=
rit-voice" in man, and the same=20

as Vachishvara (the "Voice-       deity") of the Brahmans. In China, the Bu=
ddhist ritualists have=20

degraded its meaning by anthropomorphizing it into a Goddess of the       s=
ame name, with one=20

thousand hands and eyes, and they call it Kwan-       shai-yin-Bodhisat. It=
 is the Buddhist=20

"daimon"-voice of Socrates.    694 Sangharama is the _sanctum sanctorum_ of=
 an ascetic, a cave=20

or any       place he chooses for his meditation.    695 Amitabha Buddha is=
 in this connection the=20

"boundless light" by which       things of the subjective world are  "We ar=
e carrying port wine to=20

Anvers."  "Excellent. Now take me aboard and return to your post, for they =
will soon be here."  "I=20

am ready."  "It is important that none of your crew should see me."  "I hav=
e but one man on board,=20

and I am as sure of him as I am of myself. Besides, he doesn't know you; li=
ke his mates he is=20

ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan."  "Very well; let us =
go."  They then went=20

down to the Thames. A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a =
stake. Groslow=20

jumped in, followed by Mordaunt, and in five minutes they were quite away f=
rom that world of=20

houses which then crowded the outskirts of London; and Mordaunt could disce=
rn the little vessel=20

riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs. When they reached the side of this =
felucca, Mordaunt,=20

dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance, seized a rope and climbed up the =
side of the vessel=20

with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen. He went with Groslow =
to the captain's=20

berth, a sort of temporary cabin of planks, for the chief apartment had bee=
n given up by Captain=20

Rogers to=20

696 Esoterically, "the unsurpassingly merciful and enlightened heart,"     =
  said of the "Perfect=20

Ones," the Jivan-muktas, collectively.    697 These six worlds--seven with =
us--are the worlds of=20

Nats or Spirits,       with the Burmese Buddhists, and the seven higher wor=
lds of the       Vedantins.=20

698 Two things entirely distinct from each other. The "faculty is not      =
 distinguished from the=20

subject" only on this material plane, while       thought generated by our =
physical brain, one that=20

has never       impressed itself at the same time on the spiritual counterp=
art,       whether through=20

the atrophy of the latter or the intrinsic weakness       of that thought, =
can never survive our body;=20

this much is sure.    699 _Vedanta Sara_, translated by Major Jacob, p. 123=

teaching forms       no part of his doctrine, and that it is wholly wrong t=
o suppose that       Nirvana=20

means annihilation." (Trubner's _Amer. and Oriental Lit.       Rec._, Oct. =
16th, 1869.)    711 See=20

713 Sephir, or Aditi (mystic Space). The Sephiroth, be it understood,      =
 are identical were to be=20

accommodated at the other end of the boat.  "They will have nothing to do, =
then at this end?" said=20

Mordaunt.  "Nothing at all."  "That's a capital arrangement. Return to Gree=
nwich and bring them=20

here. I shall hide myself in your cabin. You have a longboat?"  "That in wh=
ich we came."  "It=20

appeared light and well constructed."  "Quite a canoe."  "Fasten it to the =
poop with a rope; put the=20

oars into it, so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing =
to do except to cut the cord.=20

Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen; should the night=
 happen to be stormy=20

they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with."  "Con=
sider all this done. Do=20

you wish to see the powder-room?"  "No. When you return I will set the fuse=
 myself, but be careful=20

to conceal your face, so that you cannot be recognized by them."  "Never fe=
ar."  "There's ten=20

o'clock striking at Greenwich."  Groslow, then, having given the sailor on =
duty an order to be on=20

the watch with more than usual vigilance, went down into the longboat and s=
oon reached=20

Greenwich. The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted, as he approached=
 it; but he had no=20

sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road=
.  These horsemen=20

were our friends, or rather, an avant garde, composed of D'Artagnan and Ath=
os. As soon as they=20

arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped, as if guessing that h=
e was the man they=20



wanted. Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corn=
er, whilst=20

D'Artagnan, ever cautious, remained on horseback, one hand upon his pistol,=
 leaning forward=20

watchfully.  On seeing the appointed signal, Groslow, who had at first crep=
t behind one of the=20

cannons planted on that spot, walked straight up to the gentlemen. He was s=
o well wrapped up in=20

his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the ni=
ght had not been so dark=20

as to render precaution superfluous; nevertheless, the keen glance of Athos=
 perceived at once it=20

was not Rogers who stood before them.  "What do you want with us?" he asked=
 of Groslow.  "I=20

wish to inform you, my lord," replied Groslow, with an Irish accent, feigne=
d of course, "that if you=20

are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find him. He fell down this mor=
ning and broke his leg.=20

But I'm his cousin; he told me everything and desired me to watch instead o=
f him, and in his place=20

to conduct, wherever they wished to go, the gentlemen who should bring me a=
 handkerchief tied at=20

each corner, like that one which you hold and one which I have in my pocket=
."  And he drew out=20

the handkerchief.  "Was that all he said?" inquired Athos.  "No, my lord; h=
e said=20


_
Esoteric Buddhism, the Zoroastrian Amshaspends, and finally with the       =
Elohim--the "Seven=20

Angels of the Presence" of the Roman Catholic       Church.    714 Accordin=
g to the Eastern idea,=20

the All comes out from the One, and       returns to it again. Absolute ann=
ihilation is simply=20

unthinkable.       Nor can eternal Matter be annihilated. Form may be annih=
ilated: co-       relations=20

may change. That is all. There can be no such thing as       annihilation--=
in the European sense--in=20

the Universe.    715 _Isis Unveiled_, i. 289.    716 The Secret Law, the "D=
octrine of the Heart," so=20

called in contrast       to the "Doctrine of the Eye," or exoteric Buddhism=
.    717 "Illusive matter in=20

its triple manifestation in the earthly, and the       astral or fontal Sou=
l (the body), and the Platonian=20

dual Soul--the       rational and the irrational one."    718 _Isis Unveile=
d_, i. 289.    719 _Isis=20

Unveiled_, i. 290.    720 It is from the texts of all these works that the =
Secret Doctrine has       been=20

given. The original matter would not make a small pamphlet, but       the e=
xplanations and notes=20

from the Commentaries and Glossaries       might be worked into ten volumes=
 as large as _Isis=20

Unveiled_.    721 The monk Della Penna makes considerable fun in his _Memoi=
rs_ (see=20

Markham's _Tibet_) of certain statements in the Books of Kiu-te. He       b=
rings to the notice of the=20

Christian public "the great mountain       160,000 leagues high" (a Tibetan=
 league consisting of five=20

miles) in       the Himalayan Range. "According to their law," he says, "in=
 the west       of this world=20

is an eternal world ... a paradise, and in it a Saint       called Hopahma,=
 which means 'Saint of=20

Splendour and Infinite Light.'       This Saint has many disciples who are =
all Chang-chub," which=20

means,       he adds in a footnote, "the Spirits of those who, on account o=
f       their perfection, do=20

not care to become saints, and train and       you safe and sound at Boulog=
ne or any other port=20

you choose in France."  "What do you think of all this?" said Athos, in a l=
ow tone to D'Artagnan,=20

after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in English.  "It=
 seems a likely story to=20

me."  "And to me, too."  "Besides, we can but blow out his brains if he pro=
ves false," said the=20

Gascon; "and you, Athos, you know something of everything and can be our ca=
ptain. I dare say=20

you know how to navigate, should he fail us."  "My dear friend, you guess w=
ell. My father meant=20

me for the navy and I have some vague notions about navigation."  "You see!=
" cried D'Artagnan.=20

They then summoned their friends, who, with Blaisois, Mousqueton and Grimau=
d, promptly joined=20

them, leaving Parry behind them, who was to take back to London the horses =
of the gentlemen=20

and of their lackeys, which had been sold to the host in settlement of thei=
r account with him.=20

Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away w=
ith them a sum of=20

money which, if not large, was sufficient as a provision against delays and=
 accidents.  Parry parted=20

from his friends regretfully; they had proposed his going with them to Fran=
ce, but he had=20

straightway declined.  "It is very simple," Mousqueton had said; "he is thi=
nking of Groslow."  It was=20

Captain Groslow, the reader will remember, who had broken Parry's head.  D'=
Artagnan resumed=20

immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him. He found t=
he wharf too completely=20

deserted, the night too dark, the captain too accommodating. He had reporte=
d to Aramis what had=20

taken place, and Aramis, not less distrustful than he, had increased his su=
spicions. A slight click of=20

the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascon's uneasiness.  "W=
e have no time now=20

for suspicions," said Athos. "The boat is waiting for us; come."  "Besides,=
" said Aramis, "what=20

prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time? We can wa=
tch=20


_
the living." Which means that the presumably "dead" Yang-Chhub (not       "=
Chang-chub") are=20

simply living Bodhisattvas, some of those known as       Bhante ("the Broth=
ers"). As to the=20

"mountain 160,000 leagues high,"       the _Commentary_ which gives the key=
 to such statements=20

explains       that according to the code used by the writers, "to the west=
 of the       'Snowy=20

Mountain' 160 leagues [the cyphers being a blind] from a       certain spot=
  "And if he doesn't go=20

straight I will crush him, that's all."  "Well said, Porthos," replied D'Ar=
tagnan. "Let us go, then. You=20

first, Mousqueton," and he stopped his friends, directing the valets to go =
first, in order to test the=20

plank leading from the pier to the boat.  The three valets passed without a=
ccident. Athos followed=20

them, then Porthos, then Aramis. D'Artagnan went last, still shaking his he=
ad.  "What in the devil is=20

the matter with you, my=20


_
'Seat of the Brothers'], the residence of Maha-Chohan ..." etc. This       =
is the real meaning. The=20

"Hopahma" of Della Penna is--the       Maha-Chohan, the Chief.    722 In so=
me MSS. notes before=20

us, written by Gelung (priest) Thango-pa       Chhe-go-mo, it "Upon my word=
 you would make=20

Caesar afraid."  "The matter is," replied D'Artagnan, "that I can see upon =
this pier neither inspector=20

nor sentinel nor exciseman."  "And you complain of that!" said Porthos. "Ev=
erything goes as if in=20

flowery paths."  "Everything goes=20
