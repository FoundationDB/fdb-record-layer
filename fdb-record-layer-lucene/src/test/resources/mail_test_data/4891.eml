faith! I hope that this is the end, for soon I must eat something, or I shall become a cannibal!" 

"Your Majesty!" protested the Queen, faintly.  But the King interrupted her.  "What comes here?" 

he cried. "This looks sensible!" It was Rafe and the pretty maid bringing up the rear of the 

procession. Side by side they walked in cap and apron, he bearing the small, delicately browned 

pie, she with a jug of yellow cream. No one paid any attention to them, but closed in around them, 

following Roger's chariot.  When Rafe and Meg came opposite the King and Queen, they turned 

and Rafe bowed low, holding up the pie as high as he could. The pretty maid curtsied gracefully, 

and offered the cream-jug with a winsome smile. The crowd was fain to hustle them on; but the 

King struck the floor with his staff and pointed eagerly at the pie.  "Hold!" he cried. "What have you 

there?" Every one stopped and began to stare. Rafe bowed again.  "'T is a pie, Your Majesty," 

said Rafe simply,--"an apple pie."  "With cream for the top," lisped the little maid, curtsying again. 

"Apple pie!" cried the King. "Who ever heard of an apple pie! A pie should be of savory meat. But 

of apples!" Words failed to express his astonishment.  "Butter and sugar, Sire, go to the for the 

world in general, and did not know what to say to him in particular. At length, feeling that I owed 

him an explanation, I wrote as follows:--      "FLITYVILLE, _March 19_.  "You are doubtless 

surprised, my dear fellow," I began, "at my turning myself into a hermit at this most inopportune 

season of the year; but the fact is, that shortly after you left Dickiefield, I became so deeply 

impressed with the responsibility of the great work I had undertaken, that I perceived that a period 

of retirement and repose was absolutely necessary with a view to the elaboration of some system 

which should enable me to grapple with the great moral and social questions upon which I am 

engaged.  "Diverting my anxious gaze from Christendom generally, I concentrated it upon my own 

country, in the hope that I might discover the root of its disease. Morbid activity of the national 

brain, utterly deranged action of the national heart. Those were the symptoms--unmistakable. 

Proximate cause also not difficult to arrive at. Due to the noxious influence of tall chimneys upon 

broad acres, whereby the commercial effluvium of the Plutocracy has impregnated the upper 

atmosphere, and overpowered the enfeebled and enervated faculties of the aristocracy; lust of 

gain 


_
wondrous nut. Will you taste it, Sire?" Rafe held out the pie temptingly.  "With thick cream to pour 

on the top--yellow, sweet, rich, thick cream!" said Meg, lingering over each word as if it melted on 

her lips.  "Give hither that pie!" almost shouted the hungry King. "I will look into this matter." And, 

drawing a dagger from his girdle, he seized and stabbed the pie to the heart. Sniffing at it eagerly, 

his eyes grew round, and he smacked his lips. "It is good, I wager my scepter!" he cried. "Hand me 

the cream, fair maid."  The little maid stepped up and daintily poured cream upon the shattered 

pie, and without more ado the King began to eat with his dagger. (This was not considered bad 

manners in those days.) After the first mouthful he stopped only to say: "Food of the Fairies! Pie of 

the Pixies! Cook, you are a magician!" He went on at a rate which threatened not to leave a 

mouthful.  But the Queen pulled at his sleeve. "A bite for me, Your Majesty," she begged.  And, 

with an apology, the King handed her what was left, watching her wistfully till she ate the last 

crumb.  "Delicious! I never tasted anything finer!" she cried. "I must have the recipe."  "I must have 

the cook!" cried the King, turning to Rafe, with a broad grin on his merry, fat face. "You must come 

with me and cook such pies for every meal. Yes, I will have them for breakfast, too," he insisted, in 

response to a protest from the Queen.  Just then up stepped Hugh, the Lord Mayor.  "Sire," said 

he, bowing low, "will Your Majesty deign to point out to me the pie which has best pleased you, 

that I may have it set in the place of honor, and give the prize to the maker?"  "That I cannot do," 

said the King, "for the pie no longer exists. I have eaten it!" And he slapped his generous 

waistband. "But give whatever prize there may be to this worthy fellow, whom I now dub Baron 

Applepy. Baron, wear this ring in token of my pleasure in your pie." He drew a fine ruby from his 

finger and gave it to Rafe.  "And this is for the little maid," said the Queen, taking a beautiful pearl 

necklace and tossing it over Meg's curls.  But Roger, the master cook, stood by and tore his hair 

when he saw what was happening.  Then up came the yoke of white oxen drawing the cart 

bearing the prize. And the Lord Mayor gave a goad into Rafe's hands, with words of 

congratulation.  "Now, mount and come with me," said the King.  But Rafe hesitated.  "Your 

Majesty," he replied, "I see no way to make another pie like this which has pleased you. For I have 

no more of the magic nuts wherewith to flavor a second."  The King frowned. "What! No more pie! 

Is this to be the first and the last? Sirrah, I am not pleased!"  Then little Meg stepped forth. "The 

magic nut is the nutmeg," said she. "My name is Meg, and Granny called the magic nuts after me. 

I know where is hidden a store of them. These are my dower."  She emptied her pockets of the 

nuts which they held, and they were a precious handful.  "Ha!" cried the King eagerly, "you must 

marry supervened upon love of ease. Hence the utter absence of those noble and generous 

impulses which are the true indications of healthy national life. Expediency has taken the place of 

principle; conscience has been crushed out of the system by calculation. The life-blood of the 

country, instead of bounding along its veins, creeps sluggishly through them, till it threatens to 

stagnate altogether, and congestion becomes imminent.  "Looked at from what I may term 

'externals,' we simply present to the world at large the ignoble spectacle of a nation of usurers 

trembling over our money-bags; looked at from internals, I perceive that we are suffering from a 

moral opiate, to the action of which I attribute the unhappy complaints that I have endeavoured to 

describe. This pernicious narcotic has been absorbed by us for hundreds of years unsuspected 

and unperceived under the guise of a popular theology. We have become so steeped in the 

insane delusion, now many centuries old, that we are a Christian nation, that I anticipate with 



dread the reaction which will take place when men awaken to the true character of the religious 

quackery with which they have been duped, and, overlooking in their frenzy the distinction which 

exists between ancient and modern Christianity, will repudiate the former with horror, which, after 

all, does not deserve to be condemned, for it has never yet been tried as a political system in any 

country. Individuals only profess to be theoretically governed by it. Nor would it be possible, as 

society is at present constituted, for any man to carry out its principles in daily life. That any 

statesman would be instantly ruined who should openly announce that he intended to govern the 

country on purely Christian principles, may be made clear to the simplest comprehension. For 

instance, imagine our Foreign Minister getting up in the House of Commons and justifying his last 

stroke of foreign policy upon the ground that we should 'love our neighbours better than ourselves, 

or penning a despatch to any power that we felt 'persecuted' by blessing it. When do we even do 

good to anybody in our national capacity, much less to them 'that hate us'? We certainly pray like 

Chinamen when we want to propitiate an angry Deity about the cattle-plague; but who ever heard 

of 'a form of prayer to be used' for nations 'who despitefully use us.' Fancy the Chancellor of the 

Exchequer informing us that instead of laying up for the nation treasures upon earth, he proposed 

realising all that the country possessed and giving it to the poor. Christian Churchmen and 

statesmen do not therefore sufficiently believe in the power and efficacy of the Christian moral 

code to trust the nation to it alone. Hence they have invented ecclesiastical organisations and 

theological dogmas as anodynes; and the people have been lulled into security by the singular 

notion, that if they supported the one and professed to believe in the other, they were different 

from either Mohammedans or Bhuddists. In a word, 


_
use your dower in our behalf."  Rafe and the maid looked sidewise at one another.  "You are 

willing, my dear?" said the Queen, smiling upon Meg.  "Yes," whispered she, with red-apple 

cheeks.  "Yes, indeed!" cried Rafe when the Queen looked at him.  But again he seemed troubled. 

"Your Majesty," he said, "I cannot leave my poor neighbors. There will be no one to cook for them 

at my intellect can see truths which its heart will not embody. The more I think of it the more I am 

disposed to risk the assertion, that if, as is supposed, the moral code called Christian is divine, it is 

only not practicable, literally, by the nation for lack of national heart-faith. I tell you this in 

confidence, for I am already considered so wild and visionary upon all these matters, and 


_
"You shall have your own price from me," said the King.  Rafe bowed low. "You do me great 

honor," he said humbly. "But I cannot leave my poor people, my house and my cow and my apple 

tree; indeed, I cannot."  The King looked very angry and raised his staff with a gesture of wrath. 

But the Queen laid her hand upon his arm.  "Why may he not live where he will and yet cook the 

pies for us?" she said. "A messenger on a fleet horse can bring them to us every day. We shall 

then have pies like that first delicious one, made of fresh apples from that very same red-apple 

tree of should not like it to be generally known, for fear of its injuring my political prospects. In the 

mean time it will very much assist me in arriving at some of my conclusions, if you will kindly 

procure for me, from any leading member of the Legislature, lay or clerical, answers to the 

following questions:--  "First, Whether Jonah could possibly have had anything to say to Nineveh 

which would not apply with equal force to this Christian metropolis?--and if so, What?  "Second,
