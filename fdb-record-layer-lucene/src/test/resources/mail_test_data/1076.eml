to introduce the testimony of himself or another physician as to the facts =

patient.[319]  In Iowa it has been held that the testimony of a patient reg=

escribe.[321] But it=20

has been held that waiver as to one physician is not waiver as to another r=
egarding a different=20

time.[322]  In Missouri, the calling of a physician by the patient as a wit=
ness to testify as to=20

information acquired while attending, is a waiver.[323] But offering one ph=
ysician as a witness is=20

not a waiver of the privilege with reference to another.[324] An applicant =
for insurance may, by an=20

express waiver in his application, make an efficient waiver, binding upon a=
ny one claiming under=20

the contract of insurance.[325]  In Nevada a waiver has been implied from t=
he testimony of the=20

patient and her mother, where the patient was an infant seven years of age.=
[326] And it was said=20

that the parents of such an infant may make the waiver.  In New York it has=
 been held that=20

reference to a family physician when answering questions on an application =
for insurance, is not a=20

waiver;[327] nor is the presence of a third person, in aid of the patient;[=
328] nor is the bringing of=20

an action for damages for an injury;[329] nor is the examination of the phy=
sician in a former trial by=20

the opposing party;[330] but where the ban of secrecy is once removed in an=
 action and the=20

information once lawfully made public, at the instance of the patient, it c=
annot be restored, and the=20

disclosure may then be compelled in any subsequent action;[331] it would se=
em, too, that a=20

physician who becomes a witness to his patient=E2=80=99s last will and test=
ament at the patient=E2=80=99s request is=20

then subject to a thorough examination on all points involving the patient=
=E2=80=99s testamentary=20

capacity.[332]  Where the patient testified herself and called an attending=
 physician to prove her=20

physical condition, this was not a consent to the examination of another at=
tending physician, and it=20



was said that the opposite party by tactics on cross-examination could not =
compel the patient to=20

abandon a privilege which she refused to waive.[333] Fish, J., in deliverin=
g the opinion of the Court=20

in the last-mentioned case, said of the operation of the statute, that it a=
llows the patient to use the=20

testimony of the attending physician if he thinks his evidence will benefit=
 his case, and to object=20

and exclude it in case he thinks it will not benefit him; he may call to hi=
s aid the testimony of any=20

one whose views he approves and exclude that of another whose testimony mig=
ht tend to=20

controvert that given with the consent of the patient; that in this case th=
e excluded witness was the=20

best witness and could=20

The Theory of the Recoil of he knew, while here the waiver of the excluded =

had been constantly withheld.  A decision which seems to be at variance wit=
h _Record v. Village=20

of Saratoga Springs_ is _Treanor v. Manhattan Railway Company_,[335] where =
it was said that=20

the patient cannot promulgate and uncover his maladies and infirmities in c=
ourt and keep his=20

physician under obligations to silence, and that he cannot, to mulct anothe=
r in damages, inflame a=20

jury with a false or exaggerated story of his injuries and sufferings and p=
reclude the physician from=20

making a truthful statement of the case.  But where the patient testifies a=
s to what passed between=20

him and his physician, the physician may testify on the same subject, as a =
waiver is inferred from=20

the circumstances; for the reason, that the patient, having gone into the p=
rivileged domain to get=20

evidence on his own behalf, cannot prevent the other party from assailing s=
uch evidence by the=20

only testimony available, and the rule is no longer applicable when the pat=
ient himself pretends to=20

give the circumstances of the privileged interview.[336] The requirement th=
at a physician file with a=20

board of health a certificate of the cause of death does not abrogate the p=
rivilege in a judicial=20

proceeding.[337]   THE EVIDENCE EXCLUDED.  =E2=80=9C_Information._=E2=80=9D=
