But his feeling of self-condemnation immediately gave way to an entirely different emotion, for a 

swiftly moving pair of legs incased in the Ridgley red and white came within the range of his vision. 

He glanced up and saw that it was Neil Durant. Two Wilton players were after the ball also, but the 

Ridgley captain was before them; he scooped it up and ran swiftly down the field. While the stands 

roared in a frenzy of delight, Neil crossed the goal line and circled round till he placed the ball 

squarely behind the posts. Tom Curwood  "No event in human history ever shed a more salutary 

influence over the destinies of so great a mass of mankind: the wisdom of no political act was ever
