dracaena marginata appreciate very much, helping wonderfully to break the dull, routine monotony of prison life.

and his recapture will probably be "only a question of time."                               BREAKING INTO 

PRISON   We have just related some cases where men have broken out of prison, and it is in 

order to state the facts regarding a robbery that took place at the prison. A man actually broke into 

prison for the purpose of stealing. He had procured a rope ladder and scaled one of the rear walls, 

made his way to the Western Shoe company's factory and selected the finest case of shoes he 

could find. He then retraced his way to the wall, tied a rope to the case of shoes, climbed up and 

went away as though the act of stealing shoes from a penitentiary was an every-day 

accomplishment for him. He was also captured, and it was then discovered that he had been a 

former inmate, accounting for his familiarity with the grounds. The place is constantly patroled by 

two night watchmen, and it is still a mystery how he managed to evade them. This act might have 

been performed out of a spirit of reckless bravado to demonstrate to the other inmates that he was 

fully capable. His little stunt, however, cost him another residence of three and one-half years at 

the prison.                                THE PAROLE SYSTEM   The state of Minnesota was one of the 

first to introduce the grading and parole systems in its prison. Speaking of this feature, Warden 

Wolfer says:  "We have paroled 934 prisoners since the parole law went into effect in 1894. We 

now have 72 prisoners on parole, three of whom are females. Of those paroled 716 were 

committed on a definite sentence, and 218 on Reformatory Plan."  "The grading and parole law 

continues to work satisfactorily and gives much promise and encouragement for the future. We are 

often disappointed by the failure of promising parole men to make good, but on the other hand, we 

are as often encouraged by the less promising who have made good beyond our most sanguine 

expectations. All of which demonstrates the limitation of human judgment and the difficulty of 

'reading the human heart aright.' Most of those who break parole are carried over the line by some 

weakness, usually intemperance, a weakness that they do not seem able to control."  "We are 

glad to be able to say that our expedience with the grading and parole system gives us growing 

encouragement and hope for the future, because we believe we have hopeful and satisfying 

evidence that few men break their parole because of the desire to do wrong. As a rule, the parole 

breaker heartily regrets his misstep, and frequently will make good if given another chance."  "The 

parole embodies those ethical principles of conduct that make for normal life and good character. 

Rationally and constructively applied, it builds up and encourages manhood and at the same time 

it discourages a disposition to yield to weakening impulses that lead to wrongdoing. Every possible 

effort should be made to apprehend and return the fugitive parole breaker, for if allowed to remain 

at large he is almost sure to become a confirmed criminal. Therefore, a more thorough supervision 

of paroled prisoners is necessary, and a more accurate system for the apprehension and 

identification of parole breakers seems imperative in every state, and throughout the country, 

wherever the parole system is in vogue."  "Of the 934 prisoners paroled 59 per cent were finally 

discharged by reason of expiration of definite sentence; 13 2-3 per cent, who were committed on 

the Reformatory Plan, were discharged by the board after having given satisfactory evidence of a 

desire and purpose to live honestly and become good citizens; 19 2-3 per cent of the whole 

number paroled violated their paroles; 17 1-3 per cent of the whole number were returned to 

prison to serve unexpired sentences, leaving 2 1-3 per cent parole violators now at large."  This 

system has had a marked tendency to improve the discipline of the prison, for it impels inmates to 

bend every effort to merit this consideration at the hands of the state authorities. The state law 



governing the parole of prisoners from the penitentiary is as follows:                                  THE 

PAROLE LAW   Parole of Prisoners,--The State Board of Control may parole any prisoner: 

Provided,     1. No convict shall be paroled who has been previously convicted of a       felony 

other than the one for which he is serving sentence, either       in this state or elsewhere.    2. No 

convict serving a time sentence shall be paroled until he shall       have served at least one-half of 

his full term, not reckoning good       time.    3. No convict serving a life sentence shall be paroled 

until he has       served thirty-five years, less the diminution which would have been       allowed for 

good conduct had his sentence been for thirty-five       years, and then only by unanimous 

consent, in writing, of the       members of the Board of Pardons.    4. Such convicts while on 

parole shall remain in the legal custody and       under control of the Board of Control, subject at 

any time to be       returned to the prison or reformatory, and the written order of said       board, 

certified by the Warden, shall be a sufficient warrant to any       officer to retake and return to 

actual custody any such convict.       Geographical limits wholly within the state may be fixed in 

each       case, and the same enlarged or reduced according to the conduct of       the prisoners. 

5. In considering applications for parole said board shall not       entertain any petition, receive any 

written communication, or bear       any argument from any attorney or other person not connected 

with       said prison, in favor of the parole of any prisoner, but it may       institute inquiries by 

correspondence or otherwise as to the       previous history or character of such prisoner.  At the 

present time nearly all the states have inaugurated the parole and grading system similar to the 

law in operation in this state, and some are considering the advisability of introducing the system. 

This law is one of the best measures of the so-called modern penology and one in which the 

leading authorities on such matters feel the most pride.                       [Dynamited Safe, Stephen, 

Minn.]   This cut shows the condition of the safe and office of the State Bank of  Stephen, Minn., 

after being wrecked by dynamite.  This was done by three men.  One escaped, one gave state's 

evidence and the other is now serving                   a term at the Minnesota State Prison. 

[Warden's Office]                               Warden's Office                              DIMINUTION OF 

SENTENCE   The following law will give the reader an idea of the "good time" the prisoner earns 

during imprisonment, and is another powerful incentive toward good conduct. Few prisoners 

permit themselves to commit violations of rules, the gravity of which subjects them to punishment. 

A man may be deprived of good time for refusing to obey an order, fighting, insolence to guard, 

foreman or fellow-prisoner.  Diminution of Sentence.--Every convict sentenced for a definite term 

other than life, whether confined in the state prison or on parole therefrom, may diminish such 

term as follows:     1. For each month, commencing on the day of his arrival, during which       he 

has not violated any prison rule or discipline, and has labored       with diligence and fidelity, five 

days.    2. After one year of such conduct, seven days for each month.    3. After two years of such 

conduct, nine days for each month.    4. After three years, ten days for each month for the entire 

time       thereafter.  Said board, in view of the aggravated nature and frequency of offenses, may 

take away any or all of the good time previously gained, and, in consideration of mitigating 

circumstances or ignorance on the part of the convict, may afterwards restore him, in whole or in 

part, to the standing he possessed before such good time was taken away. Whenever a convict 

shall pass the entire period of his imprisonment without an unexcused violation of the rules or 

discipline, upon his discharge he shall be restored to his rights and privileges forfeited by 



conviction, and receive from the governor a certificate, under the seal of the state, as evidence of 

such restoration                               DISCHARGE ALLOWANCE   In some states there is little or 

no provision for aiding the discharged prisoner, and in some states when parole is granted his 

prospective employer must first send railroad fare before he is released. In many states the 

discharged man is given five dollars in money, while in others he is permitted to earn money 

during his imprisonment. The following is the law that governs in the state of Minnesota:  Upon 

discharge the Warden, at the expense of the state, shall furnish each convict released with one 

good, serviceable suit of clothing and underclothing, and, when released between October 1 and 

March 31 following, with a good, serviceable overcoat; and he shall pay to each convict, when 

released, $25 in money drawn from the current expense fund.                      [Decoration: Keys, Ball 

and Chain]                              THE CELLHOUSE BUILDING   Within the cellhouse building there 

are 664 cells, ranged tier upon tier, there being six in all. The building is constructed entirely of iron 

and stone, and the walls are nearly three feet thick. It is safe to say that in this solidly built building 

more human sorrow is represented than anywhere else in the state. If an authentic record could 

be made of the tragedies that take place behind these grim, unsympathetic stone walls it would fill 

volumes. However, it would require the enviable intellect of a Victor Hugo or Charles Read to 

vividly picture the utter despair and blasted hopes of the many thousands who have been 

imprisoned within these cheerless walls since the construction of the building. It is absolutely 

fireproof, but quite antiquated, the sanitation and ventilation being extremely poor. About fifteen 

prisoners are employed in the cell house, sweeping cells, galleries, passing out water, holystoning 

the flags in the corridor and keeping the place as clean as possible. Two men are constantly 

employed in whitewashing the cells and the interior of the cell house, and another's time is wholly 

occupied in exterminating bedbugs, which are quite plentiful and possess large appetites.  The 

captain makes a tour of the galleries each morning and inspects each cell to see that everything is 

in order. If a cell floor or other articles are in a slovenly condition the inmate is reported to the 

deputy warden, whose duty it is to administer a reprimand for negligence. While making this four 

of inspection he delivers all incoming letters addressed to prisoners. All incoming and outgoing 

mail is carefully scrutinized before delivery. On Sunday morning material for writing letters is 

issued to all prisoners who are permitted to write, and the distribution of tobacco is also made at 

this time. The upper tiers of the galleries used to be the rendezvous for inmates possessing 

suicidal inclinations, not a few of whom, having lost all courage and lacking the determination to 

live, chose this method of ending their woes. We use the words "used to be" advisedly, for a little 

time over the Fire; then let this Mixture stand still upon the Fire till it rises ready to boil over; at 

which time, you must take it off, and pour it into the Jelly-Bag, and as it runs thro' into a Pan set to 

receive it, pour it again into the Jelly-Bag for three or four times till it comes clear, and then let it 

drop into Jelly-Glasses. Sometimes, the above Gentleman told me, he has put a little White-Wine 

into the Liquor while the Meats were boiling in it, which he thinks helps it.         *       *       *       * 

*  SEPTEMBER.  As this Month produces great numbers of Mushrooms in the Fields, it is now 

chiefly that we ought to provide ourselves with them for making of Ketchup, and Mushroom 

Gravey: And it is also a proper Season for pickling them. Indeed, where we have Mushroom-Beds, 

we may do these Works at any time of the Year. It is to be remark'd, that the best Mushrooms 

have their Gills of a Flesh Colour, even while the Mushrooms are in button; and as they tend to 



spread in their Head, or to open their Cap, the Gills turn redder, till at length, when their Heads are 

fully spread open, they will become quite black. These large-flap Mushrooms are still good for 

stewing or broiling, so long as they have no Worms in them, and the Gills are then in the best state 

for making Ketchup, or Mushroom-Gravey; altho' the red Gills will do, but the smaller Buttons are 

what most People covet for Pickling.  In the gathering of Mushrooms, we are sure to meet with 

some of all sizes; the very small for pickling, the large Buttons for stewing or making Mushroom-

Loaves, and Mushroom-Gravey, and the large Flaps for broiling or making of Ragous, or stewing, 

and Ketchup: therefore to follow the common way, we should make two or three Parcels of them. 

The cleaning of Mushrooms, or preparing them for any of the above Uses, will afford us nothing 

but what is useful; the Parings should be saved by themselves, to be wash'd, towards the making 

of what is called Mushroom Gravey; the Gills must be saved by themselves for making either 

Ketchup, or Mushroom-Gravey; and the Parts towards the Roots, and the Roots themselves, must 

be kept to dry in the Sun, or a warm Room, to raise Mushrooms from, especially if they are of a 

large good sort that has red Gills, for those which have white Gills, prove oftentimes 

unwholesome, and are apt to turn yellow when they are cut and put in Water: however, some 

People eat of this sort, and I have eaten of such a sort myself; but as there are some with white 

Gills that are deadly, it is dangerous for unskilful Persons to meddle with any of that fort: and 

therefore I thought it convenient when I was in _France_, to learn the Method of raising them in 

Beds, that we might be sure of our sort, and have them all the Year about: The Method of doing 

which, is in my _Appendix_ to my _New Improvements of Planting and Gardening_, printed for Mr. 

_Mears_, at _Temple-Bar_.  The following Receipts for making of Mushroom-Ketchup, and 

Mushroom-Gravey, I had from a Gentleman named _Garneau_, whom I met at _Brussels_, and by 

Experience find them to be very good.    To make Mushroom Ketchup.  Take the Gills of large 

Mushrooms, such as are spread quite open, put them into a Skellet of Bell-Metal, or a Vessel of 

Earthen-Ware glazed, and set them over a gentle Fire till they begin to change into Water; and 

then frequently stirring them till there is as much Liquor come out of them as can be expected, 

pressing them often with a Spoon against the side of the Vessel; then strain off the Liquor, and put 

to every Quart of it about eighty Cloves, if they are fresh and good, or half as many more, if they 

are dry, or have been kept a long time, and about a Drachm of Mace: add to this about a Pint of 

strong red _Port_ Wine that has not been adulterated, and boil them all together till you judge that 

every Quart has lost about a fourth Part or half a Pint; then pass it thro' a Sieve, and let it stand to 

cool, and when it is quite cold, bottle it up in dry Bottles of Pints or Half-Pints, and cork them close, 

for it is the surest way to keep these kind of Liquors in such small quantities as may be used 

quickly, when they come to be exposed to the Air, for fear of growing mouldy: _but I have had a 

Bottle of this sort of Ketchup, that has been open'd and set by for above a, Year, that has not 

received the least Damage_; and some Acquaintance of mine have made of the same sort, and 

have kept it in Quart-Botles to use as occasion required, and have kept it good much longer than I 

have done. A little of it is very rich in any Sauce, and especially when Gravey is wanting: 

Therefore it may be of service to Travellers, who too frequently meet with good Fish, and other 

Meats, in Britain, as well as in several other parts of Europe, that are spoiled in the dressing; but it 

must be consider'd, that there is no Salt in this, so that whenever it is used, Salt, Anchovies, or 

other such like relishing things, may be used with it, if they are agreeable to the Palate, and so 



likewise with the Mushroom Gravey in the following Receipt.    Of Mushroom Gravey.  When you 

clean your Mushrooms, save the Parings, and wash them well from the Dirt, and then put to them 

the Gills that have been scraped from the large Buttons, and with a very little Water put them in a 

Saucepan, and stir them frequently till you have got all the juice from them; then strain the Liquor 

from them, and set it by to cool, or else till you have stew'd the Mushrooms that they were taken 

from, and then add the Liquor of the stew'd Mushrooms to the aforesaid Liquor, and boil them both 

together, with about 80 Cloves, about a Drachm of Mace, and two Drachms of whole Pepper to 

each Quart of Liquor, which will be lit to take off the Fire when it has lost about a third part by 

boiling; then pass it thro' a dry Sieve, into a dry earthen Pan, and let it stand till it be quite cold 

before you bottle it, observing then that the Bottles be very dry, for if they happen to be wet, it will 

soon turn mouldy. When the Bottles are fill'd, cork them well with sound new Corks, and tye a 

piece of Bladder, that has been softened in warm Water, over every Cork as tight as possible, and 

set the Bottles in a dry Place; with this management it will keep a long time.  What I learn'd else 

from the above mention'd Gentleman, concerning the preparing of Mushrooms for eating, was, 

that they should be always used when they are fresh gather'd, and then only such as are without 

Worms, which may be easily perceived by cutting their Stems cross-wise; and also that as soon as 

the Peel is pared off, and the Gills, let the large Mushrooms be cut into pieces, of the bigness of 

Nutmegs, and thrown into Water, as well the Stems as the Caps, for they are both good; then 

wash them well, and stew them a Sauce-pan, without putting any Liquor to them, or Spice, or Salt, 

till they have discharged a great deal of their own Liquor, and, begin to grow tender; you will then 

find them shrink into a very narrow compass, and must have the greatest part of the Liquor poured 

from them, with which you may make the Mushroom-Gravey abovemention'd. The Mushrooms 

being thus prepared, put to them a Seasoning of Pepper, Salt, Mace, and such other Ingredients 

as will not rob the Mushrooms too much of their own natural Flavour, and stir them frequently till 

they are enough; then put a little White-wine and Butter to them, and they will make an excellent 

good Dish: or else they may be made brown with some burned Butter, or be made into a Ragout. 

As for the broiling of the Caps of the large Mushrooms, the same Person's Receipt directs to rub 

the Caps with Butter on both sides, and strew Pepper and Salt on them, and broil them till they are 

quite hot through, turning them two or three times on the Fire, they will make their own Sauce 

when they come to be cut. Another way which he directs, is to make a pretty thick Batter of 

Flower, Water, or Milk and Eggs beaten together with some Salt and Pepper, to dip them in, and 

then fry them like Tripe; and for their Sauce, he recommends Butter, a little White-wine, and some 

of the Mushroom-Gravey, to be well mix'd together.  Some of my Acquaintance, who have try'd 

these Directions, approve of them; and, for my own part, I think them as agreeable as any that I 

have eaten: but as the Taste is not alike in every one, I shall add an Observation or two more of 

Monsieur _Garneau's_, concerning the Mushroom, which I think not unworthy our notice. The 

Mushroom, says that Gentleman, is not only a good Groundwork for all high Sauces, but itself a 

good Meat to be dress'd after any manner, either to compose a white or brown Fricassee, or fry'd 

or broil'd, or baked in Pyes with common Seasoning, and stands in the room of Flesh better than 

any thing that has yet been found out.  This Month is likewise a good time, if it is not over-wet, to 

gather Mushroooms for drying; but they should chiefly be such as are newly open'd in their Caps, 

before the Gills turn black. For this end, take off the Gills very clean, and wipe the Caps with wet 



Flannel, and as soon as they are a little dry, run a String through them, and hang them at some 

distance from the Fire, turning them now and then till they are dry enough to be reduced to 

Powder. When they are thus dry'd, keep them in dry Bottles with wide Necks, close stopp'd, till you 

have occasion to use them in Sauces. Keep this in a dry place. Some dry them in Ovens after the 

Bread is drawn, but an Oven in its full heat will be too strong for them.    To pickle Mushrooms 

White.  Take a Quart of small Buttons of Mushrooms, cut off their Roots, and wash them well with 

a Flannel dipt in Water, and then fling them into clean Water, to remain there about two hours. In 

the next place, get ready some fresh Water in a well-tinn'd Vessel, or glaz'd Vessel, to which put 

your Mushrooms, and let them boil a little to soften; which being done, take out your Mushrooms, 

and presently put them into cold Water, and let them remain there till they are quite cold; after this, 

free them from the Water, and dry them well in a linnen Cloth, then put them either into a wide-

neck'd Bottle, or glaz'd Earthen-Vessel, disposing here and there among them three or four Bay-

leaves to a Quart, two Nutmegs cut in quarters, about a quarter of an Ounce of Mace, and boil as 

much White-Wine and Vinegar, in equal quantities, as will serve to cover the Mushrooms. This 

Pickle must be put to them cold, and the Bottle, or Earthen-Vessel, close stopt and ty'd down with 

a wet Bladder. The reason why the Spice should not be boiled with the Pickle, is, because the 

Mushrooms would change black by means of the boil'd Spices; and if this plain Pickle was to be 

pour'd upon the Mushrooms hot, it would immediately draw a Colour from the Spices, which would 

darken the Colour of the Mushrooms: therefore to fill up the glasses in the manner here related, is 

the best way to have your Mushrooms look clean and white.  This Month is the proper time to 

pickle Onions, which make an agreeable Pickle if they are prepared after the following manner. 

To pickle Onions, from Mrs. _A. W._  When your Onions are dry enough to be laid up in the 

House, take the smallest of them, such as are about the bigness of a small Walnut, and of that 

sort 


_
failure to accomplish the result occurred to an inmate who a short time ago took the plunge from 

the upper tier. In an hour or so he was at work as if nothing unusual had happened. Heretofore a 

plunge from the upper tiers to the stone flags always meant a call for the undertaker.

CHAUTAUQUA CIRCLE   There is in existence in the Minnesota State Prison a Chautauqua 

circle, being a branch of the main organization, conducted entirely by the inmates and the 

presiding officers elected from the members thereof.  Election of officers occurs once a year. 

Meetings are held fortnightly in the prison chapel, at which time several papers are read and 

discussed by the members. At the conclusion of the meeting a critic chosen from the circle reviews 

the program, points out various errors in composition papers or commends them as the case may 

be.  The membership of this unique organization numbers about thirty, and as old members 

withdraw new ones are selected from the better educated prisoners. Meetings are always 

conducted in an orderly manner, not a snigle serious violation of the rules having occurred since 

the organization--about twenty years ago. flavour'd as the _Strasburgh_ Onions; take off only the 

outward dry Coat, and boil them in one Water without shifting, till they begin to grow tender; then 

take them off the Fire, lay them in a Sieve or Cullendar to drain and cool; and as soon as they are 

quite cold, take off two other Coats or Skins from each, and rub them gently in a linnen Cloth to 

dry. When this is done, put them into wide-mouth'd Glasses, with about six or eight fresh Bay-

leaves to a Quart, a quarter of an Ounce of Mace, two large Rases of Ginger sliced. All these 

Ingredients must be interspersed here and there in the Glasses among the Onions, and then boil 

your Vinegar with about two Ounces of Bay-Salt to each Quart, taking off the Scum as it rises, and 

letting it stand to be cold; pour it into the Glasses, and cover them close with wet Bladders, and tie 

them down; they will eat well, and look very white.  About the end of this Month, if the Season has 

been tolerable, the Grapes in our _English_ Vineyards will be ripe, and then we must be careful to 

gather them in dry Weather, that the Wine may keep the better. I have already mention'd, in my 

other Works, the curious Vineyard near _Bath_, and that belonging to Mr. _John Warner_ at 

_Rotherhith_, where good Wines are made every year; and also that at _Darking_ in _Surrey_, 

belonging to Mr. _Howard_, which is a very good one: but as some years are less favourable than 

others to the Grape, as well with us as abroad, it will not be unnecessary to take notice of a few 

Particulars, which I have observ'd this year 1726, concerning the management of Vines, which I 

have only communicated to a 


_
exceedingly spirited, especially if a paper is read that attacks the pet hobbies of the several 

members.  As an educational feature of the institution the Chautauqua circle is accomplishing 

excellent work and deserves the sincere patronage and commendation of the prison authorities. 

BAND AND ORCHESTRA   Like the majority of the better-class prisons, Minnesota's penitentiary 

has the honor of having within its walls a well-equipped band and making of Wine, which have not 

been hitherto mention'd in any of my Works, or by Mr. _Evelyn_, or Mr. _Mortimer_.  As to the first, 

we are to observe, that the Situation of our Island occasions our Seasons to be more uncertain 

than on the Continent, or between the Tropics. The cold and wet Summer, 1725, prevented the 

ripening of our later kind of Grapes; and indeed I did not meet anywhere with a Grape that had its 

perfect Flavour, unless the Vines were forced; but yet there were 


_
have made remarkable progress since organization. About nineteen members compose the band, 

mostly men who have a long time to serve.  The orchestra provides music for the services in the 

prison chapel, and when entertainments are given provides the musical very few Grapes, and 

those are likely to be very good, some being already ripe against common Walls, without Art; such 

as the white Muscadine the 24th of _July_, and black Cluster-Grape. And at Sir _Nicholas 

Garrard_'s Garden in _Essex_, I eat some of the black 


_
Of late years it has attained a degree of efficiency that has been commended very highly by 

prominent visitors to the institution.  The band gives a concert each morning during the summer 

months and also during drill exercises, which take place in the yard every Sunday immediately 

after chapel service. Concerts are also given in the park on holidays, when the men are enjoying 

perfection, at the same time; and then the grisly and white _Frontiniack_ Grapes, which are the 

latest kinds, were transparent, and within a little of being fit to gather: which is a Novelty so great, 

that has not been observ'd in _England_ in my time; for the _Frontiniack_ Grapes seldom ripen till 

the end of _September_, and then in a bad Year we cannot expect them without Art.
