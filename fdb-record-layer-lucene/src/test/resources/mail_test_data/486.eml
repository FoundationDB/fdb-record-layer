trees. Upon arrival at this spot, the aggageers, who appeared to know every=
 inch of the country,=20

declared that, unless the elephants had gone far away, they must be close a=
t hand, within the=20

forest. We were speculating upon the direction of the wind, when we were su=
rprised by the sudden=20

trumpet of an elephant, that proceeded from the forest already declared to =
be the covert of the=20

herd. In a few minutes later, a fine bull elephant marched majestically fro=
m the jungle upon the=20

large area of sand, and proudly stalked direct towards the river.  At that =
time we were stationed=20

under cover of a high bank of sand that had been left by the retiring river=
 in sweeping round an=20

angle; we immediately dismounted, and remained well concealed. The question=
 of attack was=20

quickly settled; the elephant was quietly stalking towards the water which =
was about three hundred=20

paces distant from the jungle: this intervening space was heavy dry sand, t=
hat had been thrown up=20

by the stream in the sudden bend of the river, which, turning from this poi=
nt at a right angle, swept=20

beneath a perpendicular cliff of conglomerate rock formed of rounded pebble=
s cemented=20

sanctified.  If a newly married couple wished to do things very grandly (an=
d they generally do),=20

they were not only married at home by their own priest, but they made a pil=
grimage to Glogova in=20

order to join hands once more under the sacred umbrella. And that, to them,=
 was the real=20

ceremony. The bell-ringer held it over their heads, and in return many a pi=
ece of silver found its=20

way into his pocket. And as for the priest, money and presents simply poure=
d in upon him. At first=20

he fought against all this superstition, but after a while even he began to=
 believe that the red=20

umbrella, which day by day got more faded and shabby, was something out of =
the common. Had it=20

not appeared on the scene as though in answer to his prayer, and was it not=
 the source of all his=20

good fortune?  "Oh, Lord!" he had prayed, "unless Thou workest a miracle, h=
ow am I to bring up=20

the child?"  And lo and behold, the miracle had been worked! Money, food, a=
ll the necessaries of=20

life flowed from that ragged old umbrella. Its fame spread to higher circle=
s too. The Bishop of=20

Besztercebanya heard of it and sent for Father Janos and the umbrella; and =
after having=20


_
I proposed that we should endeavour to stalk the elephant, by creeping alon=
g the edge of the river,=20

under cover of a sand bank about three feet high, and that, should the rifl=
es fail, the aggageers=20

should come on at full gallop, and cut off his retreat from the jungle; we =
should then have a chance=20

for the swords.  Accordingly, I led the way, followed by Hadji Ali, my head=
 Tokroori, with a rifle,=20

while I carried the "Baby." Florian accompanied us. Having the wind fair, w=
e advanced quickly for=20

about half the distance, at which time we were within a hundred and fifty y=
ards of the elephant,=20

who had just arrived at the water, and had commenced drinking. We now crept=
 cautiously towards=20

him; the sand bank had decreased to a height of about two feet, and afforde=
d very little shelter.=20

Not a tree nor bush grew upon the surface of the barren sand, which was so =
deep that we sank=20

nearly to the ankles at every footstep. Still we crept forward, as the elep=
hant alternately drank, and=20

then spouted the water in a shower over his colossal form; but just as we h=
ad arrived within about=20

fifty yards, he happened to turn his head in our direction, and immediately=
 perceived us. He=20

cocked his enormous ears, gave a short trumpet, and for an instant he waver=
ed in his=20

determination whether to attack or fly; but as I rushed towards him with a =
shout, he turned towards=20

the jungle, and I immediately fired a steady shot at the shoulder with the =
"Baby." As usual, the=20

fearful recoil of the rifle, with a half-pound shell and twelve drachms of =
powder, nearly threw me=20

backwards; but I saw the mark upon the elephant's shoulder, in an excellent=
 line, although rather=20

high. The only effect of the shot was to send him off at great speed toward=
s the jungle; but at the=20

same moment the three aggageers came galloping across the sand like greyhou=
nds in a course,=20

and, judiciously keeping parallel with the jung]e, they cut and heard the w=
hole story, he crossed=20

his hands on his breast and exclaimed: "Deus est omnipotens." Which was equ=
ivalent to saying he=20

believed in it.  A few weeks later he went still further, and sent orders f=
or the umbrella to be kept in=20

the church, instead of in the priest's room. Upon which Father Janos answer=
ed that in reality the=20

umbrella belonged to his little sister, who was still a minor, so that he h=
ad no right to it, nor to give=20

it away. But he was sure, as soon as Veronica was of age, she would make a =
present of it to the=20

church. But the umbrella not only brought good fortune to the priest, who s=
oon started a small=20

farm, and in a few years built himself a new house, and kept a horse and tr=
ap, but it made a great=20

difference in Glogova too. Every summer numbers of ladies came from the sma=
ll watering-places=20

round about, very often countesses too (mostly old countesses), in order to=
 say a prayer under the=20

umbrella, and for these an inn was built opposite the priest's house, calle=
d the "Miraculous=20

Umbrella." In fact, Glogova increased in size and importance from day to da=
y.  In time the villagers=20

began to feel ashamed of the simple wooden belfry, and had a tower built to=
 the church, and hung=20

two bells in it from Besztercebanya. Janos Sranko had a splendid statue of =
the Holy Family=20

erected in front of the church, to commemorate his resurrection from the de=
ad. The governess (for=20

a time Father Janos had a governess for little Veronica) filled the priest'=
s garden with dahlias,=20

fuchsias, and other flowers which the inhabitants of Glogova had never yet =
seen.  Everything=20

improved and was beautified (except Widow Adamecz, who got uglier day by da=
y), and the=20

villagers even went so far as to discuss on Sunday afternoons the advisabil=
ity of building a chapel=20

f pilgrimage and=20

 charged straight at the=20

enemy; but now came the very gallant, but foolish, part of the hunt. Instea=
d of leading the elephant=20

by the flight of one man and horse, according to their usual method, all th=
e aggageers at the same=20

moment sprang from their saddles, and upon foot in the heavy sand they atta=
cked the elephant=20

The Gregorics Family  PART II     CHAPTER I.  THE TACTLESS MEMBER OF THE FA=
MILY.=20

Many years before our story begins, there lived in Besztercebanya a man of =
the name of Pal=20

Gregorics, who was always called a tactless man, whereas all his life was s=
pent in trying to please=20

others. Pal Gregorics was always chasing Popularity, and instead of finding=
 it came face to face=20

with Criticism, a=20


_
In the way of sport, I never saw anything so magnificent, or so absurdly da=
ngerous. No gladiatorial=20

exhibition in the Roman arena could have surpassed this fight. The elephant=
 was mad with rage,=20

and nevertheless he seemed to know that the object of the hunters was to ge=
t behind him. This he=20

avoided with great dexterity, turning as it were upon a pivot with extreme =
quickness, and charging=20

months after his father's death, an act of tactlessness which gave rise to =
plenty of gossip, and=20

much unpleasantness to his mother, who was a thoroughly good, honest woman.=
 If he had only=20

arrived a little earlier ... but after all _he_ could not help it. As far a=
s the other Gregorics were=20

concerned, he had better not have been born at all, for of course the estat=
es were cut up more=20

than they=20


_
assailants, while he blew clouds of sand in the air with his trunk, and scr=
eamed with fury. Nimble=20

as monkeys, nevertheless the aggageers could not get behind him. In the fol=
ly of excitement they=20

had forsaken their horses, which had escaped from the spot. The depth of th=
e loose sand was in=20

 sickly, and his=20

 mother, who had died=20

during his minority and left him her whole fortune; whereas the children of=
