magistrates to make complaint, for he knows that instead of doing him justi=
ce they would, after=20

making him spend much money, sentence him to pay the costs and exculpate th=
e Indian,=20

regarding the latter as a neophyte. Still less does he say a word about the=
 rape, in order not to=20

make public his own dishonor. Let it not be supposed that this occurs only =
among private persons;=20

for there have been persons in authority who have experienced in their own =
houses similar acts of=20

insolence from these vicious and immoral neophytes. After these evil deeds,=
 they disappear, as I=20

have said; and in a very short time they are seen returning from Ilocos, Ca=
marines, and Ceb,=20

ordained as clerics, with what sort of character may be understood--now cle=
ansed from all their=20

crimes, and absolved from guilt and penalty, to continue their studies in t=
he colleges. Thus they=20

graduate as bachelors and doctors, and secure curacies, in which they commi=
t the acts of folly=20

which may easily be inferred, and which it would be tedious to explain here=
; and with their corrupt=20

behavior they set an example to their parishioners of dissoluteness, impiet=
y, and slothfulness.=20

[The writer then enumerates the good qualities of this people, so far as th=
ey go. They are inclined=20

to the arts and sciences, and learn quickly, and their deficiencies therein=
 are due only to their lack=20

of books for their instruction, and tools with which to finish off their wo=
rk; this is mainly due to their=20

improvidence, "for an Indian, even though he is a doctor and a cura, is una=
ble to save one cuarto=20

for purchasing those things, no matter how cheap they may be; on the other =
hand, he will, if he=20

needs money for his vices, pledge his breviary or sell his missal." "Nevert=
heless, they exercise all=20

the occupations except those of silversmith, tailor, and watch-maker, for n=
o one would trust them=20

[in these];" but lack of tools prevents them from doing as good work as Eur=
opeans. They have=20

taste in the fine arts, and almost all the buildings are planned by them. T=
hey are excellent=20

artillerists, and a French naval commander (in 1798) thought them better th=
an his own; and are=20

useful in naval fights, on account of their courage and agility. An Indian =
will in a few days' practice=20

understand as much of seamanship as a European would gain in twenty years; =
and many of them=20

have migrated from the islands as seamen on the ships. But they resent bein=
g called "negroes,"=20

and in several cases where they have been thus affronted they have mutinied=
, killed the=20

Europeans, and fled with the ship and cargo. So great has been this migrati=
on that in the other=20

colonies of Asia rigorous measures have been taken to stop it, and "in all =
the ports of India, the=20

entrances and roads are full of gibbets on which men from Manila are hanged=
, for a warning; but,=20

seeing that this had no effect, all the owners and captains of merchant shi=
ps have been compelled=20

by law not to receive on their vessels more than four or six of these India=
ns." The Taglos are free=20

with their money, and readily lend to any European whatever they may posses=
s. They take great=20

care of their fighting cocks ("who are for them actual idols"), are very te=
mperate in eating and=20

drinking, and are never seen intoxicated. They are often devoted to agricul=
tural labor, and will do=20

well in it when they are supplied with better methods and appliances.]  [So=
me account is given of=20

the Negritos and other wild tribes of Luzn; and it is stated that any colon=
ist who wishes to settle=20

among them will be able to succeed in any agricultural or other enterprise =
which he may=20

undertake, if he will obtain the consent of the chiefs, pay the savages who=
m he may employ=20

exactly what he has agreed to give, and not annoy them with matters of reli=
gion. As for the=20

civilized Taglos, their women are entirely different from the men; they are=
 kind, hospitable, and=20

industrious, and, although coquettish, are very modest and decorous in beha=
vior. They sow the=20

rice, and gather all the crops; roll cigars, and weave beautiful fabrics of=
 cotton and abac; and=20



embroider beautifully, besides making hats, mats, and many other articles. =
In      To daunt him; her=20

forces dispute his command;      Her snows fall to freeze him; her suns bur=
n to brand;      Her seas=20

yawn to engulf him; her rocks rise to crush;      And the lion and leopard,=
 allied, lurk to rush        On=20

their startled invader. * * * * * * * *      Not a truth has to art or to s=
cience been given,      But brows=20

have ached for it, and souls toiled and striven;      And many have striven=
, and many have failed,=20

And many died, slain by the truth they assailed.=E2=80=9D   The original co=
ndition of the human race was=20

not one of knowledge. When the first man and the first monkey were created =
and finished, the=20

monkey knew as much as the man. Both found themselves in a world of forces,=
 of the nature of=20

which, beyond what was revealed to their native instincts, they knew nothin=
g at all. The man=E2=80=99s=20

superiority lay not in knowledge, but in capacity to know.  Man learned the=
 forces and facts of=20

Nature by experience. He learned them at the cost to himself of fear and pa=
in and toil and death.=20

He plucked one fruit and found it wholesome; another, and found it bitter; =
another, and found it=20

deadly. The surviving son learned to avoid the mistakes of his father.  Man=
 was not long in gaining=20

a knowledge of his environment, enough at least, if he would not be too ven=
turesome, to conserve=20

in some degree his happiness and life. He learned that fire will burn, that=
 water will drown, that=20

storms will blow, that floods will overwhelm, that winter will come, and th=
at his life is dependent on=20

continual quest and avoidance. But Nature held innumerable secrets which he=
 did not know;=20

many, which, even to-day, he has not learned. In proportion as he should be=
come acquainted with=20

these, he would be master of a situation, which, at the first, so nearly ma=
stered him. He might=20

acquire a magnificent fortune, if he would only work for it; accordingly, w=
e are told that his Maker=20

admonished him to =E2=80=9Csubdue and have dominion.=E2=80=9D  Whether man =
has been six thousand years, or=20

sixty thousand, in learning the little that he now knows, no one can tell; =
but during these years of=20

his primary tuition he could not through knowledge have the mastery of Natu=
re, for knowledge was=20

too meager. It was well, therefore, that he should, in the meanwhile, have =
a partial mastery=20

through faith. Ignorant of natural forces, or without means of avoidance, i=
s it any wonder that he=20

should fly for refuge to the Supernatural? Accordingly, God was his =E2=80=
=9Crefuge and strength, a very=20

present help in trouble.=E2=80=9D Believing himself watched and defended by=
 infinite power and love, he=20

could =E2=80=9Crun through a troop or leap over a wall;=E2=80=9D he could f=
ancy himself =E2=80=9Cimmortal till his work was=20

done,=E2=80=9D safe on the battle-field as in his chamber; he was not afrai=
d of the =E2=80=9Cpestilence that walketh=20

in darkness, nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday;=E2=80=9D of ea=
rthquake and storm and fire he=20

was not afraid, for these were the ministers of Heaven=E2=80=99s will--if n=
ot to be avoided, then to be=20

accepted with submission and trust.  Such faith in the presence and interpo=
sition of the=20

Supernatural was instructive to the young world, and as necessary as its mo=
ther=E2=80=99s milk is to a=20

babe. It gave comfort and repose and strength, for its subject felt that =
=E2=80=9Cunderneath and round=20

about him were the everlasting arms.=E2=80=9D It made heroes of cowardly me=
n on battle-fields; heroines of=20

weak women in humble homes. It produced the sublimest characters of history=
; it vanquished=20

death. Sustained by it, it is literally true that men =E2=80=9Csubdued king=
doms, wrought righteousness,=20

stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edg=
e of the sword; out of=20

weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the arm=
ies of the aliens.=E2=80=9D  The=20

sudden loss of this faith from earth would be a calamity. It would be as th=
ough the sun and moon=20

had been darkened, and the stars had gone out in the sky. Till men know mor=
e of Nature, they=20

must continue to lean on the Supernatural. They may never do this less than=
 they do it now; but=20



they will do it more intelligently.  As the child, with growing strength, i=
s weaned from the breast, so=20

increasing knowledge=20


_
all the men and leave only the women, or rather unite them to other men who=
 would possess their=20

good qualities and think as they do, Filipinas would come to be the most we=
althy and fortunate=20

country in the universe." It is certain that agriculture would be the best =
mode of life for the Indians,=20

and they ought to be urged to engage in it, after the examples furnished by=
 the Jesuits in=20

Paraguay, the Quakers in America, and other successful colonists. The write=
r suggests various=20

means to stimulate the Indians to greater industry (especially as the Spani=
ards cannot undertake=20

work in the fields), and for the formation and management of agricultural e=
nterprises; he would=20

have them well treated, promptly and justly paid, and supplied with house, =
land, and suitable=20

amusements. It has been a great mistake to prohibit the alcaldes-mayor and =
other provincial as a=20

law that, other things being equal, faith in the manifestation of the Super=
natural--in the miraculous-

-is most facile to him who knows the least. Accordingly, the men of highest=
 attainments have=20

commonly the least of this kind of faith. They still believe in something b=
ack of Nature; some cause=20

of Nature--in the Supernatural--but they expect nothing from it outside the=
 lines of natural law.=20

They know nothing of miracle or special providence. They see everywhere cau=
se and effect; the=20

one not present without the other; the perpetual grinding of machinery and =
the wretch mangled=20

who is caught between the wheels; the wisest and best of men, pillars of st=
ate or prophets of the=20

Lord, crushed as surely as the vilest and the meanest. All the prayers of G=
od=E2=80=99s people will not=20

make rivers flow back to their fountains, nor turn the Sahara into a sea; n=
or thaw the=20
