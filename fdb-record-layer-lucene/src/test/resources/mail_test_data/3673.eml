g sale for so large a sum as five pounds, of a picture done in the attic by=
 her Henry, had enlarged her ideas of Henry's skill. She could no longer re=
gard his painting as the caprice of a gentle _
between a bark and scream, and I could think of nothing but young hawks as =
the authors of it. So I=20

set at work to find the nest, but my search was in vain, while the sharp sq=
ueaking seemed to=20

multiply and to come from a dozen different quarters. By this time I had cr=
awled down the rough=20

face of the cliff, and had reached the heaps of fallen rock. There I caught=
 a glimpse of a little head=20

with two black eyes, like a prairie-dog's, peering out of a crevice, and I =
was just in time to see him=20

open his small jaws and say _"shink" _--about as a rusty hinge would pronou=
nce it. I whipped my=20

revolver out of my belt and fired, but the little fellow dodged the bullet =
and was gone. Echoes=20

rattled about among the rocks, wandered up and down the canon, and hammered=
 away at half a=20

dozen stone walls before ceasing entirely. But when they had died away, not=
 another sound was=20

to be heard. Every little rascal had hid.  So I sat down and waited. In abo=
ut five minutes a tiny,=20

timid squeak broke the stillness, then a second a trifle louder, then one a=
way under my feet in=20

some subterranean passage. Hardly daring to breathe, I waited and watched. =
Finally the chorus=20

became as loud as before, and I caught sight of one of the singers only abo=
ut ten yards away,=20

head and shoulders out of his hole, doubtless commenting to his neighbor in=
 no complimentary=20

way upon the strange intruder. Slowly lifting my pistol, I pulled the trigg=
er. I was sure he had not=20

seen me, yet a chip of rock flying from where he had stood was my only sati=
sfaction; he had=20

dodged again.  I had seen enough, however, to know that the noisy colony wa=
s a community of=20

Little Chief hares (_Lagomys princeps,_ as they are named in the textbooks)=
, or "conies," as the=20

silver miners call them. They are related to the woodchucks as well as to t=
he hare, and they live=20

wholly at or above timber-line, burrowing among the fallen and decomposing =
rocks which crown=20

the summits of all the mountains. Not every peak, by any means, harbors con=
ies; on the contrary,=20

they are rather uncommon, and are so difficult to shoot that their skins ar=
e rare in museums, and=20

their ways are little known to naturalists. During the middle of the day th=
ey are asleep and quiet;=20

but in the evening and all night when the moon shines they leave their rock=
y retreats and forage in=20

the neighboring meadows, meeting the yellow-footed marmot and other neighbo=
rs. About the only=20

enemies they have, I fancy, are the rattlesnake and weasel, excepting when =
a wild-cat may=20

pounce upon one, or an owl swoop down and snatch up some rambler. In the co=
ld season, of=20

course, their burrows are deep in snow; but then the little fellows are tak=
ing their long winter sleep,=20

and neither know nor care what the weather may be.  An Indian will eat a co=
ny,--if he can catch it.=20

He likes to use its fur, also, for braiding his locks into those long plait=
s which delight his soul; but=20

the lively little rodents are pretty safe from all human foes, even one wit=
h a Colt's revolver!    THAT=20

SLY OLD WOODCHUCK  By William O. Stoddard  "Deah me! Dey's jes' one moah ro=
w ob taters.=20

I's hoein' de bes' I know."  Julius leaned on his hoe for a  "Please, pleas=
e don't bother about=20

money. We shall have _heaps_. There's no occasion for you to bother, and I =
won't _have_ you=20

bothering."  "What are you crying for?" he asked in a murmur.  "It's only--=
only because I think it's=20

so nice of you trying to earn money like that," she lied. "I'm not really c=
rying."  And she ran away,=20

downstairs, really crying. It was excessively comic, but he had better not =
follow her, lest he might=20

cry too....   _A Patron of the Arts_   A lull followed this crisis in the a=
ffairs of No. 29 Werter Road.=20

Priam went on painting, and there was now no need for secrecy about it. But=
 his painting was not=20

made a subject of conversation. Both of them hesitated to touch it, she fro=
m tact, and he because=20

her views on the art seemed to him to be lacking in subtlety. In every marr=
iage there is a topic--

there are usually several--which the husband will never broach to the wife,=
 out of respect for his=20



respect for her. Priam scarcely guessed that Alice imagined him to be on th=
e way to lunacy. He=20

thought she merely thought him queer, as artists _are_ queer to non-artists=
. And he was=20

accustomed to that; Henry Leek had always thought him queer. As for Alice's=
 incredulous attitude=20

towards the revelation of his identity, he did not mentally accuse her of t=
reating him as either a liar=20

or a madman. On reflection he persuaded himself that she regarded the story=
 as a bad joke, as=20

one of his impulsive, capricious essays in the absurd.  Thus the march of e=
volution was apparently=20

arrested in Werter Road during three whole days. And then a singular event =
happened, and=20

progress was resumed. Priam had been out since early morning on the riversi=
de, sketching, and=20

had reached Barnes, from which town he returned over Barnes Common, and so =
by the Upper=20

Richmond Road to High Street. He was on the south side of Upper Richmond Ro=
ad, whereas his=20

tobacconist's shop was on the north side, near the corner. An unfamiliar pe=
culiarity of the shop=20

caused him to cross the street, for he was not in want of tobacco. It was t=
he look of the window=20

that drew him. He stopped on the refuge in the centre of the street. There =
was no necessity to go=20

further. His picture of Putney Bridge was in the middle of the window. He s=
tared at it fixedly. He=20

believed his eyes, for his eyes were the finest part of him and never decei=
ved him; but perhaps if=20

he had been a person with ordinary eyes he would scarce have been able to b=
elieve them. The=20

canvas was indubitably there present in the window. It had been put in a ch=
eap frame such as is=20

used for chromographic advertisements of ships, soups, and tobacco. He was =
almost sure that he=20

had seen that same frame, within the shop, round a pictorial announcement o=
f Taddy's Snuff. The=20

tobacconist had probably removed the eighteenth-century aristocrat with his=
 fingers to his nose,=20

from the frame, and replaced him with Putney Bridge. In any event the frame=
 was about half-an-

inch too long for the canvas, but the gap was scarcely observable. On the f=
rame was a large=20

notice, 'For sale.' And around it were the cigars of two hemispheres, from =
Syak Whiffs at a penny=20

each to precious Murias; and=20


_
turned a little anxiously toward the front fence. Over in the road beyond t=
hat there stood a white=20

boy, of about his own size, and he was calling:  "Quib! Quib! Come here!"  =
"Dar he goes!" said=20

Julius. "Dey'e got him agin. He's de bes' dog for woodchucks, he is! An' I =
can't go 'long. Tell you=20

wot, dough, if I'd ha' t'ought he'd run away 'fore I'd hoed dese taters, I'=
d nebber hab gibben him dat=20

big bone. De rascal! He's jes' hid it away, somewhar, down 'mong de cabbage=
s."  That was what=20

Quib had done with his precious bone; but now his little, lean, yellow legs=
 were carrying him=20

rapidly down the road, with half a dozen very noisy boys behind him.  "Pete=
! Pete Corry! Where=20

was it you saw that woodchuck?"  "Finest woodchuck you ever saw in all your=
 life!" was Pete's=20

reply.  "He'll get away from us!"  "No, he won't. Abe Selover is watching f=
or him. That woodchuck=20

is in the stone-heap at the corner of old Hamburger's pasture-lot."  Quib m=
ust have understood=20

what Mart Penniman said, for he did not halt for one second till he reached=
 the bars that led=20

multitudinous fragments of all advertised tobaccos; and meerschaums and bri=
ars, and patent=20

pipes and diagrams of their secret machinery; and cigarette-and cigar-holde=
rs laid on plush; and=20

pocket receptacles in aluminium and other precious metals.  Shining there, =
the picture had a most=20

incongruous appearance. He blushed as he stood on the refuge. It seemed to =
him that the mere=20

incongruity of the spectacle must inevitably attract crowds, gradually bloc=
king the street, and that=20

when some individual not absolutely a fool in art, had perceived the qualit=
y of the picture--well,=20

then the trouble of public curiosity and of journalistic inquisitiveness wo=
uld begin. He wondered=20

that he could ever have dreamed of concealing his identity on a canvas. The=
 thing simply shouted=20

'Priam Farll,' every inch of it. In any exhibition of pictures in London, P=
aris, Rome, Milan, Munich,=20

New York or Boston, it would have been the cynosure, the target of ecstatic=
 admirations. It was=20

just such another work as his celebrated 'Pont d'Austerlitz,' which hung in=
 the=20


_
very field. It was more than a quarter of a mile from the potato-patch, but=
 Quib had barked all the=20

way--probably out of respect for the size and importance of the coming wood=
chuck.  Mart=20

Penniman and Abe Selover had started their great "game" on the way home fro=
m driving their=20

cows. They had raced him across the pasture and along the fence, into the s=
tone-heap, and then=20

Abe had staid to keep watch while Mart went after Julius Davis's dog. That =
meant also, of course,=20

as large a crowd of boys as he could pick up in going and coming.  It was a=
 sad thing for Julius=20

that his mother had set him at the potato-patch, and that Quib had broken h=
is contract with the=20

bone.  Quib was not usually so treacherous, but he happened to be on friend=
ly terms with every=20

boy of that hunting-party.  They had all helped him chase woodchucks at one=
 time or another, and=20

he had great confidence in them, but that was nothing at all to their confi=
dence in him.  The=20

pasture bars did not stop a single one of the woodchuck-hunters. All the bo=
ys went over while=20

Quib was wriggling under, through a hole he knew, and there, almost right b=
efore them was the=20

stone-heap. It was quite a large one, and it was thickly overgrown with wil=
d raspberry vines.  "Abe-

-is he there?"  "He didn't get away, did he?"  "Are you sure he is in there=
?"  "Quib! Quib!" shouted=20

Abe. "Woodchucks! Quib, woodchucks! Right in here. Find 'em!"  Quib was dan=
cing around in a=20

quiver of noisy excitement, for he had caught a sniff of something under th=
e first bush he sprang=20

into.  How he did bark and yelp and scratch, for about a minute!  "Poys! Po=
ys! Vat is all dis? Vat=20

you want vis mein stone-heap, eh?"  It was old Hamburger himself climbing t=
he fence, and he=20

looked longer and leaner just then, and had more pipe in his mouth, than th=
e boys thought they=20

had ever seen before.  "The finest woodchuck you ever saw, Mr. Hamburger," =
began Cole=20

Thomas, by way of an apology.  "Vootchuck! Dat's it! Ant so you puts a tog =
into mein stone-heap,=20

and you steps onto mein grass, ant you knock ober all mein beautiful mullei=
n-stalks and mein=20

thistles and mein scoke-veeds!"  Puff! puff! came the great clouds of smoke=
 from the grim lips of=20

the old German, but it struck Cole Thomas 'chemical gold,' nor the extremel=
y variegated coloration=20

of the other merchandise on sale could kill it.  However, there were no sig=
ns of a crowd. People=20

passed to and fro, just as though there had not been a masterpiece within t=
en thousand miles of=20

them. Once a servant girl, a loaf of bread in her red arms, stopped to glan=
ce at the window, but in=20

an instant she was gone, running.  Priam's first instinctive movement had b=
een to plunge into the=20

shop, and demand from his tobacconist an explanation of the phenomenon. But=
 of course he=20

checked himself. Of course he knew that the presence of his picture in the =
window could only be=20

due to the enterprise of Alice.  He went slowly home.  The sound of his lat=
chkey in the keyhole=20

brought her into the hall ere he had opened the door.  "Oh, Henry," she sai=
d--she was quite=20

excited--"I must tell you. I was passing Mr. Aylmer's this morning just as =
he was dressing his=20

window, and the thought struck me that he might put your picture in. So I r=
an in and asked him. He=20

said he would if he could have it at once. So I came and got it. He found a=
 frame, and wrote out a=20

ticket, and asked after you. No one could have been kinder. You must go and=
 have a look at it. I=20

shouldn't be at all surprised if it gets sold like that."  Priam answered n=
othing for a moment. He=20

could not.  "What did Aylmer say about it?" he asked.  "Oh!" said his wife =
quickly, "you can't expect=20

Mr. Aylmer to understand these things. It's not in his line. But he was gla=
d to oblige us. I saw he=20

arranged it nicely."  "Well," said Priam discreetly, "that's all right. Sup=
pose we have lunch?"=20

Curious--her relations with Mr. Aylmer! It was she who had recommended him =
to go to Mr.=20

Aylmer's when, on the first morning of his residence in Putney, he had dema=
nded, "Any decent=20



tobacconists in this happy region?" He suspected that, had it not been for =
Aylmer's beridden and=20

incurable wife, Alice's name might have been Aylmer. He suspected Aylmer of=
 a hopeless passion=20

for Alice. He was glad that Alice had not been thrown away on Aylmer. He co=
uld not imagine=20

himself now without Alice. In spite of her ideas on the graphic arts, Alice=
 was his air, his=20

atmosphere, his oxygen; and also his umbrella to shield him from=20


_
himself was on the watch for that woodchuck.  Bow-wow-yow-yelp! and Mart sh=
outed:  "There he=20

goes!"  "Hi! We'll get him!" screamed Abe.  "Take him, Quib! Take him!"  Qu=
ib had started a=20

woodchuck.  There was never a stone-heap piled up that had room in it for c=
ircumstances.=20

Curious--the process of love! It was the power of love that had put that pi=
cture in the tobacconist's=20

window.  Whatever power had put it there, no power seemed strong enough to =
get it out again. It=20

lay exposed in the window for weeks and never=20


_
a dog and a woodchuck.  Mr. Hamburger took the pipe out of his mouth, which=
 was a thing nobody=20

could remember ever having seen him do.  "Dose poys! Dat vootchuck! De tog =
is a goot von. Dey=20

vill preak dare little necks. Joost see how dey run! But de tog is de pest =
runner of dem poys,=20

egsept de vootchuck."  Mr. Hamburger did not run. Nobody had ever seen him =
do any such thing=20

as that.  But he walked on across the pasture-lot, toward the deep ravine t=
hat cut through the side=20

of the hill to the valley.  All crowd, nor caused a sensation of any kind! =
Not a word in the=20

newspapers! London, the acknowledged art-centre of the world, calmly went i=
ts ways. The sole=20

immediate result was that Priam changed his tobacconist, and the direction =
of his promenades.  At=20

last another singular event happened.  Alice beamingly put five sovereigns =
into Priam's hand one=20

evening.  "It's been sold for five guineas," she said, joyous. "Mr. Aylmer =
didn't want to keep=20

anything for himself, but I insisted on his having the odd=20
