distinguished himself during the conquest of Mexico by his rashness and cru=

 no doubt, the=20

impression the appearance of the cacique Enrique had produced in Santo Domi=

suited the cacique perfectly, and he began to make arrangements for his jou=

considerable pomp with a numerous following of warriors. To this Las Casas =
objected, foreseeing=20

the difficulty he would have in keeping such a large number from too famili=
ar contact with=20

Spaniards, from which quarrels and troubles would inevitably ensue.  He suc=
ceeded in convincing=20

Don Juan that such a display was unnecessary, and sent notice of the approa=

Guatemala, where Father Ladrada built more rooms onto the convent for the r=
eception of the=20

guests and laid in an extra supply of provisions to regale them.  The Bisho=

visit from the cacique upon his arrival, went at once to the convent to see=
 him and, as he spoke=20

 school-fellow of the=20

that an oar or a stake fell on his fingers."  "Is it possible!"  cried the =
Regent.  "And quite a=20

youngster laid hands on him," continued the officer.  "My people told me ev=

 tone of regret. "Your=20
