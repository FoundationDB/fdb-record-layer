e with during the early part=20

of the year, I have recently mounted as a simple equatorial. And although I=
 have had but few=20

opportunities at present of using the same, they have been sufficiently num=
erous to prove, beyond=20

doubt, the great excellence of the mirror.  On the evening of the 3rd Septe=
mber, I had some=20

beautiful views of Jupiter and Saturn. In the former the deep coppery hue o=
f the equatorial belts,=20

and of the large spot, at present visible on his southern hemisphere, were =
strikingly conspicuous,=20

as were many minute details of his surface. In the case of Saturn, the grad=
ations of light on the=20

rings, and the delicately tinted belts on the planet itself, also the sharp=
ly defined shadow of the=20

planet on the rings were easily seen.  Its definition of the most minute po=
rtions of the moon=E2=80=99s=20

surface, leaves nothing to be desired, whilst its performance on double sta=
rs is equally=20

I happened to observe=20

Jupiter, when a black shadow of a satellite was beautifully notching the li=
mb, at the same time a=20
