"Utterly unfit!" cried the lawyer.  "Disgracefully incompetent!" chimed in the student.  "I suppose," 

said Sir Lacy, in his insolent manner, "that school-masters, like footmen, expect their masters to 

give a month's warning. What day is this?--the sixth of July. Well, on the sixth of August you will 

bundle yourself off, my fine fellow, and I'll take precious good care not to consult the old parson as 

to whom your successor should be. He might, in his wisdom, recommend some saint from the Idiot

Poultry, are many; but as the use of them for the Table is the same, I shall only take notice of such 

as are of the large Dunghill kind, or of the _Hamburgh_ sort, of the Game kind, and of the small 

_Dutch_ kind; which last is admired by some for the fineness of their Flesh, and for being great 

Layers, especially in the Winter: But it is certain that the larger sort sell the best at Market, and lay 

the largest Eggs, and therefore should be the most cultivated about a Farm. As for the Game 

Breed, some fancy that their Flesh is more white and tender

aghast at the sudden dismissal of their master, Sir Lacy sauntered out of the school-room, 

accompanied by the lawyer and medical student.  There were a few moments of silence after they 

had left, during which the ticking of the large school-clock sounded almost painfully loud. It was 

broken by Ned Franks himself, contributes to make themselves and their Brood weak.  Where we 

propose to raise a large Stock of Poultry, we should be careful to secure our Hen-House from 

Vermin of all sorts, and keep it dry and clean, allowing also as much Air as possible; for if it is not 

often clean'd, the scent of the Dung will give your

Persis felt while Sir Lacy was in the school-room; very anxiously she watched the porch, in hopes 

of seeing him and his visitors quit it. She could hear from beneath the sound of laughter; but it was 

laughter which raised in her soul a very opposite feeling to that of mirth. She listened intently; but 

her baby was fretful from cutting teeth, and his crying soon drowned every other noise. Persis 

easy Convenience for perching of the Fowls, disposed in such a manner, that the Perches be not 

placed over any of the Hen's Nests, which must always lie dry and clean, bedded with Straw, for 

Hay is apt to make the sitting Hens faint and weak. When we design to set a Hen, we should save 

her Eggs in dry Bran, and when she clucks, put no more in her Nest than she can well cover; for 

as to certain numbers to be more lucky in hatching, there is nothing in that: And if we fat Fowls, 

then use the Method prescribed in my _Country Gentleman and Farmer's Monthly Director_, in the

porch. She did not, however, like their looks, still less the laughter which followed words of which 

she could not catch the exact meaning, but which she was certain had none which was good. 

Persis watched the three men till they disappeared down a turn in the road, and then heaved a 

long, anxious sigh. Lessons were evidently going on as usual below,--Persis knew _that_ from the 

hum of voices from the school-room. She had to wait in restless expectation till the school In the 

choice of Fowls for eating, those which are white feather'd and white legg'd, are much tenderer 

and finer in their Flesh than those of other Colours, and are much weaker; for which reason, those 

who understand Cocking, do not approve of such as happen to be white feather'd: and those 

which are black feather'd, are accounted the hottest and most fiery, and their Flesh is coarser than 

in other Fowls. But let us now come to the use of the Flesh of these Fowls, which is either eaten
