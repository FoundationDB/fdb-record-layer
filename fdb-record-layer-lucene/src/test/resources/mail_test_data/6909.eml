dracaena marginata not follow too fast, he said, "Here, Hecla, good dog," i=
ndicating the beast's track in the snow.  "Sic, Si-c-c-c-c."  As the strong=
 bear scent fumed into the old hound's nostrils, the hair rose upon her nec=
k and she stood uncertain.  "Si-c-c-c-c," repeated the man sternly.  Reluct=
antly the hound took the arrangements. Lothair really must confer with his =
guardians. They were both now in town, the Scotch uncle having come up to a=

"Sic, Si-c-c-c-c."  As the strong bear scent fumed into the old hound's nos=
trils, the hair rose upon her neck and she stood uncertain.  "Si-c-c-c-c," =
repeated the man sternly.  Reluctantly the hound took the arrangements. Lot=
hair really must confer with his guardians. They were both now in town, the=
 Scotch uncle having come up to attend Parliament. Could they be brought to=
gether? Was it indeed impossible? If so, who was to give the necessary inst=
ructions?  It was much more than a year since Lothair had met his _
keen, gray eyes.  "Mary," he said, almost roughly, "stop taking on so and l=
isten to me. I am going=20

after our child and with God's help I will bring him back." The realization=
 of the hopelessness of it=20

all nearly choked him, but he had to say something to quiet the look of mis=
ery and terror in his=20

wife's eyes.  "I want you to stay right here until I come back.  I am a str=
ong man and a good shot=20

and no harm will come to me.  No matter how long I am gone, or how lonely y=
ou get, you are not=20

to stir from the house.  Do you hear?"  The young mother looked at him in a=
 dazed manner as=20

though she but half comprehended, but and vigilance she guided him in the r=
ight direction.=20

Nevertheless, St. Aldegonde was sometimes in scrapes; but then he always we=
nt and told his best=20

friend, whose greatest delight was to extricate him from his perplexities a=
nd embarrassments.=20

CHAPTER 22 Although Lothair was not in the slightest degree shaken in his c=
onviction that life=20

should be entirely religious, he was perplexed by the inevitable obstacles =
which seemed=20

perpetually to oppose themselves to the practice of his opinions. It was no=
t merely pleasure in its=20

multiform appearances that he had to contend against, but business began im=
periously to=20


_
into her eyes.  "I am going too," she said.  The man had foreseen and feare=
d this and had tried to=20

forestall it.  "No," he said, roughly, "you cannot go.  Stay right in this =
room until I return."  As he=20

spoke he took down an old double-barreled gun, and drawing the shot in one =
barrel, rammed=20

home a Minie ball that just fitted the bore. This was a rude makeshift for =
a rifle, but it was the best=20

he could do.  Hastily slipping on his overcoat and cap, and tenderly kissin=
g his wife, he passed out=20

into the darkness, on his hazardous and almost hopeless mission.  But befor=
e taking the trail, he=20

went to the shed and aroused an old hound who was sleeping upon a door-mat =
inside.  "Here,=20

Hecla," he called.  "Come along.  You may be of some help to me to-night." =
 Then tying a long=20

piece of rope to the hound's collar, that him nearer to his majority, and t=
he frequent letters from Mr.=20

Putney Giles now began to assume the pressing shape of solicitations for pe=
rsonal interviews. He=20

had a long conversation one morning with Father Coleman on this subject, wh=
o greatly relieved=20

him by the assurance that a perfectly religious life was one of which the s=
overeign purpose was to=20

uphold the interests of the Church of Christ, the father added after a mome=
ntary pause. Business,=20

and even amusement, were, not only compatible with such a purpose, but migh=
t even be=20

conducive to its fulfilment.  Mr. Putney Giles reminded Lothair that the at=
tainment of his majority=20

must be celebrated, and in a becoming manner. Preparation, and even conside=
rable preparation,=20

was necessary. There were several scenes of action=E2=80=94some very distan=
