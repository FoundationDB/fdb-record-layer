Ben would not have understood the motives of one who, like his Master, coul=

sinners whilst abhorring their sin.  "If you've any idea of _converting_ Na=

continued, laughing at the idea as utterly absurd, "you might as replied.  =
Was it a bluff, or did he=20

know--not merely suspect--something?  "I don't understand you," I said quie=
tly, though my lips=20

were dry.  "Shall I mention the word--_document?_" he hinted. "Really, I'm =
sure you won't regret it=20

if you let me drive=20

my old lathe into a lady's piano-forte! Why the woman's just passed this on=
 her way to the=20

 back sober, why, I'm a=20

Dutchman, that's all!"  Franks was more vexed than surprised at the news. H=
e quickened his=20

steps, and overtook Nancy when she had almost reached the door of the "Cheq=
uers." "On with=20

you, my lads," cried Ned to his boys, "I'll be after you in a twinkling; se=
e if you can be sharp=20

enough as to finish that bit of clearing before I join you." He then walked=
 up to Nancy, and laid his=20

hand on her arm.  "Mrs. Sands, just you come on with us, and see me and my =
crew at work."=20

There was nothing in the words, but much in the manner, that conveyed an  "=
I can't do that," I=20

answered. "And I can't take you into my carriage here. But I'll stop for yo=

well," he agreed. "But send your maid home in a cab; I can not talk before =
her."  "Yes, you can.=20

She knows no language except French--and a little English. She always drive=

This was true. But if I had been talking to Raoul, I would perhaps have giv=
en the dear old woman=20

her first experience of being sent off by herself. In that case, she would =
not have minded, for she=20

likes Raoul, admires him as a "dream of a young man," and already suspected=
 what I hadn't yet=20

told her--that we were engaged.=20

"I will, presently; I must just step in here first," said Nancy, looking re=
stless and annoyed.  "Mrs.=20

Sands, you joined us last night in the prayer, _lead us not into temptation=
_; are you not steering=20

right into the middle of it now?"  Nancy's face flushed very red; there was=
 anger, but also some=20

irresolution. She stood for a moment as if she could not make up her mind, =
when a shrill voice was=20

heard from the open window of the tap-room, "I say, Nancy Sands, I've been =
wondering what has=20

ront seat.  "Now," I=20

exclaimed. "Please begin quickly."  "Don't force me to be too abrupt," he s=

I could. You speak as if you grudged me every moment with you. Yet I am her=
