boilers being cylindrical,=20

with an inside flue for fuel, two or three are placed close together, and s=
et in the following manner:=20

First, cross-bars of iron are laid on the timbers, a platform of sheet-iron=
 is laid on these bars,=20

coated over with clay mortar, or cemented, to keep out the air. Upon the sh=
eet-iron, and over the=20

bars below, are placed cast-iron blocks in shape to fit the curve of the bo=
iler, so as to raise it three=20

or four inches above the platform. The sheet-iron is continued up the outsi=
des of the outer boilers,=20

so as to enclose them; and at one end, between the boilers, there are small=
 grates for coal or=20

other fuel.  The tar vessel or vessels, as the case may be, are lodged in t=
he space between and=20

upon the boilers, and a small fire may be made under them, if necessary. A =
pipe leads steam in at=20

 lead out the tar and=20
