SE     CHAPTER I--

AN UNPLEASANT AWAKENING   "Look where you are steering, Cora Kimball! You n=
early ran=20

over a chicken that time."  "Yes, and avoiding the chicken on that side, yo=
u nearly hit a child on=20

this side. Such a dear little boy--or was it a girl? I never can tell when =
they're so young."  "Two=20

misses are as good as two miles," misquoted the bronzed girl at the wheel f=
irst cut in small pieces,=20

into a Puff-Paste, and tye it up in a Cloth. These must be sweeten'd with _=
Lisbon_-Sugar, when=20

they are taken up, and melted Butter pour'd in: for if you use Loaf-Sugar, =
though it is powder'd,=20

some of it will be harsh in the Mouth; and the _Lisbon_-Sugar, which is the=
 fattest sort of Sugar,=20

will not, but will give a good flavour to your Fruit.    An _Hog_ barbecued=
, or broil'd whole. From=20

_Vaux-Hall, Surrey._  Take an Hog of five or six Months old, kill it, and t=
ake out the Inwards, so=20

that the Hog is clear of the Harslet; then turn the Hog upon its Back, and =
from three Inches below=20

the place where it was stuck, to kill it, cut the Belly in a strait Line do=
wn to the Bottom, near the=20

joining of the Gammons; but not so far, but that the whole Body of the Hog =
may hold any Liquor=20

we would put into it.  Then stretch out the Ribs, and open the Belly, as wi=
de as may be; then strew=20

into it what Pepper and Salt you please.  After this, take a large Grid-Iro=
n, with two or three Ribs in=20

it, and set it upon a stand of Iron, about three Foot and a half high, and =
upon that, lay your Hog,=20

open'd as above, with the Belly-side downwards, and with a good clear Fire =
of Charcoal under it.=20

Broil that side till it is enough, flouring the Back at the same time often=
. _Memorandum_, This=20

should be done in a Yard, or Garden, with a Covering like a a Tent over it.=
  When the Belly-part of=20

the Hog is enough, and turn'd upwards, and well fix'd, to be steady upon th=

road, where the trees met in a green archway overhead, and where the golden=
 shadows flitted in=20

the dust like so many little chickens running to cover, away from the fat-t=
ired wheels.  "Why are=20

you in such a hurry, Cora?" asked Bess Robinson, as she tucked back a stray=
ing lock of brown=20

hair. "It's too perfect a day to do much Salt as you will, with some Sage c=
ut small; adding the Peels=20

of six or eight Lemons, and an Ounce of fresh Cloves whole.  Then let it br=
oil till it is enough, which=20

will be, from the beginning to the end, about seven or eight Hours; and whe=
n you serve it, pour out=20

the Sauce, and lay it in a Dish, with the Back upwards.=20


_
"Bess doesn't believe in doing _anything_ in a hurry," lazily droned her si=
ster Belle, from the rear=20

seat. "That's why she's so fat."  "Don't dare use that objectionable word!"=
 stormed Bess, turning=20

about so suddenly that she sent Cora's elbow against the plunger of the hor=
n, must not be cut=20

before you lay it on the Gridiron, to keep in the Gravey; neither should an=
y of the Skin be cut,=20

when you have any Pork roasted for the same Reason.    _Beef,_ or _Pork,_ t=
o be salted for=20

"Oh!" exclaimed Bess. "Did we run into something again?"  "Again?" demanded=
 Cora. "Come, I=20

like that--not! We haven't run into _anything_ yet."  "That chicken," murmu=
red Belle, even more=20

lazily. "Yes?"  "Was a good fifty feet out of danger!" declared Cora indign=
antly.  "And what of the it=20

fresh from the Shambles, or Market, and salt it very well, just before you =
put it into the Pot; then as=20

soon as your Meat is salted, take a coarse Linnen Cloth, and flour it very =
well, and then put the=20

Meat into it, and tye it up close. Put this into a Kettle of boiling Water,=
 and=20
