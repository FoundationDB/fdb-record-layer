1890.  NOZALEDA, BERNARDINO, O.P.--Native of Asturas, of rustic parentage; originally a 

professor in Manila; takes possession of his diocese, Oct. 29, 1890; Apr. 28, and May 8, 1898, 

issues circulars to the Filipinos urging them to repel the American invaders; resides about 26 

years in Philippines; relinquishes archbishopric, June, 1903; returns to Spain after the transfer of 

the Philippines to the United States; there nominated archbishop of Valencia, [187] but the citizens 

refuse to receive him, because of evil reports about him. [188]         NOTES   [1] "Originally, when 

the port of the capital of Filipinas was visited only by vessels from the Asiatic nations and a few 

Spanish ships, the exaction of duties was in the hands of the royal officials, according to the laws 

of the Indias. In 1779 Basco y Vargas ordained that those functionaries should attend only to 

collecting duties from the ships which navigated to the coasts of Coromandel, Malabar, Bengala, 

Java, Cantn, Acapulco, feet deep, and bury them.  In a month or so, they may be taken up, and 

will be found quite clean, free from smell, and as bright in hue as during life.  I have tried boiling 

them, heaping them in the sun, and various other methods, but this is undoubtedly the best. 

[Illustration--SATIN BOWER-BIRDS]  Should it ever fall to the lot of any of my readers to have to 

cook periwinkles--and there are many worse things, when you are certain of their freshness--let 

them remember that they should be boiled in 'salt water'.  This is to give them toughness; if fresh 

water is used, however expert the operator may be with his pin, he will fail to extract more than a 

moiety of the curly delicacy.  These little facts, though extraneous to our subject, are always worth 

knowing.  At one end of Garden Island, and distant from it about 200 yards, stands a very singular 

rock, of a whitish hue, and when struck at a certain angle by the sun, so much resembling the 

canvas of a vessel, that it was named the "Sail Rock."  At low tide this could be reached by 

wading, the water being little more than knee-deep.  Its base was literally covered with oysters of 

the finest quality.  The mere task of getting there was one of considerable difficulty, for the rock 

was as slippery as glass,

entrance or outgo of products and commodities in the inter-island commerce should be in charge 

of the director of alcabala. From this originated the foundation of the custom-house, it being 

completed by royal decrees of 1786 and 1788, from which time it was provided with the necessary 

force of men for collecting the import and export duties." (Note by Montero y Vidal.)  [2] Cf. 

Forrest, Voyage to New Guinea, p. 368: "They believe the deity pleased with human victims. An 

Idaan or Maroot [a tribe in northern Borneo] must, for once at least, in his life, have imbued his 

hands in a fellow creature's blood; the rich are said to do it often, adorning their houses with sculls 

and teeth, to show how much they have honored their author, and laboured to avert his 

chastisement. Several in low circumstances will club to buy a Bisayan Christian average every five 

minutes--bleeding hands and jagged knees bore testimony to a couch of growing bivalves being 

anything but as soft as a feather bed; also the oysters cling so fast that they might be taken for 

component parts of the rock, and only a cold chisel and mallet will induce them to relinquish their 

firm embrace.  Three or four of the party had ventured out, and we had secured a large sackful, 

after which we all retired to the tent, except one of our number, who, having a lady-love in 

Cardwell with an inordinate affection for shell-fish, lingered to fill a haversack for his 'inamorata'. 

We were comfortably smoking our pipes and watching with satisfaction the tide rising higher and 

higher, when a faint "coo-eh" from the direction of the rock reached us, followed by another and 

another and another, each one more shrill than the

that is to be sold cheap; that all may partake the benefit of the execution. So at Kalagan, on 

Mindano, as Rajah Moodo informed me, when the god of the mountain gives no brimstone, they 

sacrifice some old slave, to appease the wrath of the deity. Some also believe, those they kill in 

this world, are to serve them in the next, as Mr. Dalrymple observes." He also says (p. 271), that 

they pay "perhaps five or six Kangans" for an old slave, and that the above mountain is "in the 

district of  "By Jove, Wordsworth's in some trouble!" exclaimed one of our party, and, snatching up 

our carbines, we hurried to the end of the island at which stood the Sail Rock.  The tide had now 

risen considerably, and the water between the rock and ourselves was over four feet deep, and 

increasing in depth each moment.  We saw poor Wordsworth clinging on to the slippery wall, as 

high up as the smooth mass afforded hand-hold.  "Come along, old fellow!" we shouted; "it's not 

up to your neck yet."  "He
