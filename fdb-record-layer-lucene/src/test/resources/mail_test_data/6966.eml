art. 28, Glossary.    820 The references to "Nature's Finer Forces" which follow, have respect 

to the eight articles which appeared in the pages of the       _Theosophist_ and not to the fifteen 

essays and the translation of a       chapter of the Shivagama which are contained in the book 

called       _Nature's Finer Forces_. The _Shivagama_ in its details is purely       Tantric, and 

nothing but harm can result from any practical       following of its precepts. I would most strongly 

dissuade any       student from attempting any of these Hatha Yoga practices, for he       will either 

ruin himself entirely, or throw himself so far back that       it will be almost impossible to regain the 

lost ground in this       incarnation. The translation referred to has been considerably 

expurgated, and even now is hardly fit for publication. It       recommends Black Magic of the worst 

kind, and is the very antipodes       of spiritual Raja Yoga. Beware, I say.    821 Prana, on earth at 

any rate, is thus but a mode of life, a constant       cyclic motion from within outwardly and back 

again, an out-breathing       and in-breathing of the ONE LIFE, or Jiva, the synonym of the 

Absolute and Unknowable Deity. Prana is not absolute life, or Jiva,       but its aspect in a world of 

delusion. In the _Theosophist_, May,       1888, p. 478, Prana is said to be "one stage finer than 

the gross       matter of the earth."    822 Remember that our re-incarnating Egos are called the 

Manasaputras,       "Sons of Manas" (or Mahat), Intelligence, Wisdom.    823 It is erroneous to call 

the fourth human principle "Kama Rupa." It       is no Rupa or form at all until after death, but 

stands for the       Kamic elements in man, his animal desires and passions, such as       anger, 

lust, envy, revenge, etc., the progeny of selfishness and       matter.    824 Here the world of 

effects is the Devachanic state, and the world of       causes, earth life.    825 It is this Kama Rupa 

alone that can _materialize_ in mediumistic       seances, which occasionally happens when it is 

not the Astral Double       or Linga Sharira, of the medium himself which appears. How, then, 

can this vile bundle of passions and terrestrial lusts, resurrected       by, and gaining 

consciousness only through the organism of the       medium, be accepted as a "departed angel" 

or the Spirit of a once       human body? As well say of the microbic pest which fastens on a 

person, that it is a sweet departed angel.    826 This is accomplished in more or less time, 

according to the degree       in which the personality (whose dregs it now is) was spiritual or 

material. If spirituality prevailed, then the  "Yes."  "What is it?"  "Have you confidence in me?" 

"Give your orders," said the three musketeers.  "Very well; come this way."  D'Artagnan went 

toward a very small, low window, just large enough to let a man through. He turned it gently on its 

hinges.  "There," he said, "is our road."  "The deuce! it is a very cold one, my dear friend," said 

Aramis.  "Stay here, if you like, but I warn you 'twill be rather too warm presently."  "But we cannot 

swim to the shore."  "The longboat is yonder, lashed to the felucca. We will take possession of it 



and cut the cable. Come, my friends."  "A moment's delay," said Athos; "our servants?"  "Here we 

are!" they cried.  Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight 

which D'Artagnan, in raising the shutters, had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the 

window.  Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn, 

more striking, than the raging sea, rolling, with its deafening roar, its dark billows beneath the pale 

light of a wintry moon.  "Gracious Heaven, we are hesitating!" cried D'Artagnan; "if we hesitate 

what will the servants do?"  "I do not hesitate, you know," said Grimaud.  "Sir," interposed Blaisois, 

"I warn you that I can only swim in rivers."  "And I not at all," said Mousqueton.  But D'Artagnan 

had now slipped through the window.  "You have decided, friend?" said Athos.  "Yes," the Gascon 

answered; "Athos! you, who are a perfect being, bid spirit triumph over body. Do you, Aramis, 

order the servants. Porthos, kill every one who stands in your way."  And after pressing the hand 

of Athos, D'Artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward, so that he had only to 

plunge into the water, which was already up to his waist.  Athos followed him before the felucca 

rose again on the waves; the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising 

out of the sea.  D'Artagnan swam to it and held it, suspending himself by this rope, his head alone 

out of water.  In one second Athos joined him.  Then they saw, as the felucca turned, two other 

heads peeping, those of Aramis and Grimaud.  "I am uneasy about Blaisois," said Athos; "he can, 

he says, only swim in rivers."  "When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere. To the boat! 

to the boat!"  "But Porthos, I do not see him."  "Porthos is coming--he swims like Leviathan."  In 

fact, Porthos did not appear; for a scene, half tragedy and half comedy, had been performed by 

him with Mousqueton and Blaisois, who, frightened by the noise of the sea, by the whistling of the 

wind, by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them, shrank back instead of 

going forward.  "Come, come!" said Porthos; "jump in."  "But, monsieur," said Mousqueton, "I can't 

swim; let me stay here."  "And me, too, monsieur," said Blaisois.  "I assure you, I shall be very 

much in the way in that little boat," said Mousqueton.  "And I know I shall drown before reaching 

it," continued Blaisois.  "Come along! I shall strangle you both if you don't get out," said Porthos at 

last, seizing Mousqueton by the throat. "Forward, Blaisois!"  A groan, stifled by the grasp of 

Porthos, was all the reply of poor Blaisois, for the giant, taking him neck and heels, plunged him 

into the water headforemost, pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank.  "Now, 

Mousqueton," he said, "I hope you don't mean to desert your master?"  "Ah, sir," replied 

Mousqueton, his eyes filling with tears, "why did you re-enter the army? We were all so happy in 

the Chateau de Pierrefonds!"  And without any other complaint, passive and obedient, either from 

true

fade out very soon; but if the personality was very materialistic,       the Kama Rupa may last for 

centuries and--in some, though very       exceptional cases--even survive with the help of some of 

its       scattered Skandhas, which are all transformed in time into       Elementals. See the _Key to 

Theosophy_, pp. 141 _et seq._, in which       work it was impossible to go into details, but where 

the Skandhas       are spoken of as the germs of Karmic effect.    827 _Key to Theosophy_, p. 141 

828 Following _Shivagama_, the said author enumerates the       correspondences in this wise; 

Akasha, Ether, is followed by Vayu,       Gas; Tejas, Heat; Apas, Liquid; and Prithivi, Solid.    829 

See Fitz-Edward Hall's notes on the _Vishnu Purana_.    830 The pair which we refer to as the 

One Life, the Root of All, and       Akasha in its pre-differentiating period answers to the Brahma 

devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois, Mousqueton leaped into the sea 

headforemost. A sublime action, at all events, for Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead. But 

Porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant, and when Mousqueton rose above the water, 

blind as a new-born puppy, he found he was supported by the large hand of Porthos and that he 

was thus enabled, without having occasion even to move, to advance toward the cable with the 

dignity of a very triton.  In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions, who were already 

in the boat; but when, after they had all got in, it came to his turn, there was great danger that in 

putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel. Athos was the last 

to enter.  "Are you all here?" he asked.  "Ah! have you your sword, Athos?" cried D'Artagnan. 

"Yes."  "Cut the cable, then."  Athos drew a sharp
