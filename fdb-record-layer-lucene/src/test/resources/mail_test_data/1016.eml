Engstrand.  REGINA. For if I--  MANDERS. Will you be so good as to tell you=
r mistress I am here?=20

REGINA. I will, at once, sir. [She goes out to the left.]  MANDERS. [Paces =
the room two or three=20

times, stands a moment in the background with his hands behind his back, an=
d looks out over the=20

garden. Then he returns to the table, takes up a book, and looks at the tit=
le-page; starts, and looks=20

at several books.] Ha--indeed!  [MRS. ALVING enters by the door on the left=
; she is followed by=20

REGINA, who immediately goes out by the first door on the right.]  MRS. ALV=
ING. [Holds out her=20

hand.] Welcome, my dear Pastor.  MANDERS. How do you do, Mrs. Alving? Here =
I am as I=20

promised.  MRS. ALVING. Always punctual to the minute.  MANDERS. You may be=
lieve it was not=20

so easy for me to get away. With all the Boards and Committees I belong to-=
-  MRS. ALVING.=20

That makes it all the kinder of you to come so early. Now we can get throug=
h our business before=20

dinner. But where is your portmanteau?  MANDERS. [Quickly.] I left it down =
at the inn. I shall sleep=20

there to-night.  MRS. ALVING. [Suppressing a smile.] Are you really not to =
be persuaded, even=20

now, to pass the night under my roof?  MANDERS. No, no, Mrs. Alving; many t=
hanks. I shall stay=20

at the inn, as usual. It is so conveniently near the landing-stage.  MRS. A=
LVING. Well, you must=20

have your own way. But I really should have thought we two old people--  MA=
NDERS. Now you=20

are making fun of me. Ah, you're naturally in great spirits to-day--what wi=
th to-morrow's festival=20

and Oswald's return.  MRS. ALVING. Yes; you can think what a delight it is =
to me! It's more than=20

two years since he was home last. And now he has promised to stay with me a=
ll the winter.=20

MANDERS. Has he really? That is very nice and dutiful of him. For I can wel=
l believe that life in=20

Rome and Paris has very different attractions from any we can offer here.  =
MRS. ALVING. Ah, but=20

here he has his mother, you see. My own darling boy--he hasn't forgotten hi=
s old mother!=20

MANDERS. It would be grievous indeed, if absence and absorption in art and =
that sort of thing=20

were to blunt his natural feelings.  MRS. ALVING. Yes, you may well say so.=
 But there's nothing of=20

that sort to fear with him. I'm quite curious to see whether you know him a=
gain. He'll be down=20

presently; he's upstairs just now, resting a little on the sofa. But do sit=
 down, my dear Pastor.=20

MANDERS. Thank you. Are you quite at liberty--?  MRS. ALVING. Certainly. [S=
he sits by the=20

table.]  MANDERS. Very well. Then let me show you--[He goes to the chair wh=
ere his travelling-

bag lies, takes out a packet of papers, sits down on the opposite side of t=
he table, and tries to find=20

a clear space for the papers.] Now, to begin with, here is--[Breaking off.]=
 Tell me, Mrs. Alving, how=20

do these books come to be here?  MRS. ALVING. These books? They are books I=
 am reading.=20

MANDERS. Do you read this sort of literature?  MRS. ALVING. Certainly I do.=
  MANDERS. Do=20

you feel better or happier for such reading?  MRS. ALVING. I feel, so to sp=
eak, more secure.=20

MANDERS. That is strange. How do you mean?  MRS. ALVING. Well, I seem to fi=
nd explanation=20

and confirmation of all sorts of things I myself have been thinking. For th=
at is the wonderful part of=20

it, Pastor Manders--there is really nothing new in these books, nothing but=
 what most people think=20

and believe. Only most people either don't formulate it to themselves, or e=
lse keep quiet about it.=20

MANDERS. Great heavens! Do you really believe that most people--?  MRS. ALV=
ING. I do,=20

indeed.  MANDERS. But surely not in this country? Not here among us?  MRS. =
ALVING. Yes,=20

certainly; here as elsewhere.  MANDERS. Well, I really must say--!  MRS. AL=
VING. For the rest,=20

what do you object to in these books?  MANDERS. Object to in them? You sure=
ly do not suppose=20

that I have nothing better to do than to study such publications as these? =
 MRS. ALVING. That is=20



to say, you know nothing of what you are condemning?  MANDERS. I have read =
enough about=20

these writings to disapprove of them.  MRS. ALVING. Yes; but your own judgm=
ent--  MANDERS.=20

My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions in life when one must rely up=
on others. Things are=20

so ordered in this world; and it   New Orleans, a victory which, like the e=
ffect of the blockade=20

throughout the war, was a weighty demonstration of the influence   of sea p=
ower upon history.=20

After Farragut had cleared the lower   river, it was practically Vicksburg =
alone which remained to=20

unite   the eastern and western territory of the Confederacy. But in the   =
East there had been a=20

series of Northern disasters, culminating in   Chancellorsville.--EDITOR.  =
 When the defeated=20

Federals recrossed the Rappahannock, May 5, 1863, after Chancellorsville, t=
he fortunes of the=20

North were at the lowest ebb. Then came the turning of the tide, and in an =
unexpected quarter.=20

General Grant had shot up into fame through his capture of Fort Donelson, e=
arly in 1862, but had=20

done little thereafter to confirm his reputation. Though in responsible com=
mand in northern=20

Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee, the few successes there which the c=
ountry could=20

appreciate went to the credit of his subordinate, Rosecrans. The world reme=
mbered his=20

shiftlessness before the war, and began to believe that his success had bee=
n accidental. All things=20

considered, it is strange that Grant had been kept in place. The pressure f=
or his removal had been=20

great everywhere, but his superiors stood by him faithfully, though Lincoln=
=E2=80=99s persistence was=20

maintained in the midst of misgivings.  In the fall of 1862, Grant, in comm=
and of fifty thousand=20

men, purposed to continue the advance southward through Mississippi, flanki=
ng Vicksburg, which=20

then must certainly fall. His supplies must come over the Memphis & Charles=
ton road and the two=20

weak and disabled lines of railroad, the Mississippi Central and the Mobile=
 & Ohio. To guard one=20

hundred and fifty miles of railroad in a hostile country the army must nece=
ssarily be scattered, as=20

every bridge, culvert, and station needed a detail. From Washington came un=
wise interference;=20

but he moved on with vigor. As winter approached, he pushed into Mississipp=
i toward Jackson. If=20

that place could be seized, Vicksburg, fifty miles west, must become untena=
ble, and to this end=20

Grant desired to unite his whole force. He was overruled, and the troops di=
vided: while he=20

marched on Jackson, Sherman, with thirty-two thousand, was to proceed down =
the river from=20

Memphis. Grant=E2=80=99s hope was that he and Sherman, both near Vicksburg,=
 and supporting each=20

other, might act in concert.  Complete failure attended this beginning. For=
rest, operating in a=20

friendly country, tore up the railroads in Grant=E2=80=99s rear for scores =
of miles, capturing his detachments=20

and working destruction. On December 20th, also, Van Dorn, now a cavalry le=
ader, surprised=20

Holly Springs, Grant=E2=80=99s main depot in northern Mississippi, carrying=
 off and burning stores to the=20

amount of $1,500,000.[227] Grant=E2=80=99s movement southward became imposs=
ible: the army stood=20

stripped and helpless, saving itself only by living off the country, an exp=
erience rough at the time,=20

but out of which, later, came benefit.[228] Co-operation with Sherman could=
 no longer be thought=20

of. Nor could news of the disaster be sent to Sherman, who, following his o=
rders, punctually=20

embarked and steamed down to the mouth of the Yazoo; this he entered, and o=
n December 29th,=20

believing that the garrison of Vicksburg had been drawn off to meet Grant, =
he flung his divisions=20

against the Confederate lines at Chickasaw Bayou, with a loss of eighteen h=
undred men and no=20

compensating advantage.[229]  The difficulty and disaster in the Mississipp=
i campaign were=20

increased by a measure which strikingly reveals the effect in war of politi=
cal pressure at the=20

capital. At the outbreak of the war, John A. McClernand was a member of Con=
gress from Illinois,=20



and later commanded a division at Donelson and Shiloh. Returning to Washing=
ton, he stood out=20

as a War Democrat, a representative of a class whose adherence to the admin=
istration was=20

greatly strained by the Emancipation Proclamation, and whose loyalty Lincol=
n felt it was almost=20

vital to preserve. When, therefore, he laid before Lincoln a scheme[230] to=
 raise by his own=20

influence a large force in the West, over which he was to have military com=
mand, with the=20

intention of taking Vicksburg, Lincoln and Stanton yielded, the sequel show=
ing that McClernand=20

was a soldier of little merit....  McClernand went West, and kept his promi=
se=20


_
well that they are. Otherwise, what would become of society?  MRS. ALVING. =
Well, well, I daresay=20

you're right there.  MANDERS. Besides, I of course do not deny that there m=
ay be much that is=20

attractive in such books. Nor can I blame you for wishing to keep up with t=
he intellectual=20

movements that are said to be going on in the great world-where you have le=
t your son pass so=20

much of his life. But--  MRS. ALVING. But?  MANDERS. [Lowering his voice.] =
But one should not=20

talk about it, Mrs. Alving. One is certainly not bound to account to everyb=
ody for what one reads=20

and thinks within one's own four walls.  MRS. ALVING. Of course not; I quit=
e agree with you.=20

MANDERS. Only think, now, how you are bound to consider the interests of th=
is Orphanage,=20

which you decided on founding at a time when--if I service, chiefly through=
 his personal influence,=20

some thirty regiments, a welcome recruitment in those dark days. With this =
new army McClernand=20

appeared at the mouth of the Yazoo just at the moment when Sherman emerged =
from the swamps=20

with his crestfallen divisions. McClernand assumed command, Sherman subsidi=
ng into a=20

subordinate place; but he had influence enough with his new superior to per=
suade him to proceed=20

at once to an attack upon Arkansas Post, not far away.[231] This measure pr=
oved successful, the=20

place capitulating January 11, 1863, with five thousand men and seventeen g=
uns. Though the=20

victory was due in great part to the navy, Sherman alone in the army having=
 rendered conspicuous=20

service, yet before the country the credit went to McClernand, nominally th=
e commander, giving=20

him an=20
