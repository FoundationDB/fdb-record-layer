  He had read of such philodendron monstera to its liking.  The bear was sn=
iffing about as usual, poking his nose into all the holes and bushes, when =
a low humming in the grass near by caught his ear.  It was a sound that has=
 made bears smile ever since the first bear licked up his first taste of ho=
ney.  So  It was a rich twilight as they drove home, the lady leaning back =
in the carriage silent. Lothair sat opposite to her, and gazed upon a count=
enance on which the moon began to glisten, and which seemed unconscious of =
all human observation.  He had read of such _
master, as by the cub.  When May came, and it was warmer, so that the doors=
 leading to the=20

wood-shed and the porch were left open, the little bear's world grew apace.=
  Before, his horizon=20

had been the four walls of the kitchen; now he could go and come as he plea=
sed, about the yard=20

and in the outbuildings.  He made the acquaintance of Hecla, the old hound,=
 while he was still a=20

prisoner in the kitchen, but they came to know each other better when the c=
ub got out of doors.  At=20

first, the dog was inclined to attack the small bundle of bear-meat, but he=
r master calmed her=20

anger, and explained to her, as best he could, that Black Bruin was one of =
the family and should=20

be treated with respect and consideration.  So finally she became reconcile=
d to his presence, but=20

she never could get over his scent, which always filled her with suspicion.=
  When the cub got out=20

of doors where he could run about and exercise, he began to grow very rapid=
ly in stature.  Before,=20

he had been a football or a bundle of fur, but now he began to put on the s=
emblance of a bear.  He=20

also developed a great genius for mischief.  If I should tell of all the th=
ings he overturned or upset,=20

this chapter would be endless.  A naturalist, who has reared several bear-c=
ubs, says, "If you have=20

an enemy, give him a bear-cub.  His punishment will be adequate, no matter =
what his offense."=20

But the young farmer and his wife did not think so, and as for the baby who=
 was now learning to=20

walk, "Bar-Bar," as he called the young bruin, was a never-ending source of=
 delight.  He would=20

bury his wee hands in the fuzzy hair of the cub and pull with all his might=
, and the cub would growl=20

with make-believe fury, but it seemed to know that the baby did not intend =
to hurt it, and did not=20

offer to bite.  When the baby pulled its ears too hard, it would simply run=
 away.   =E2=80=9CTheodora,=E2=80=9D said=20

the colonel, who was a little in advance with the professor, and turning ro=
und his head, =E2=80=9Cthis=20

reminds me of Mirabel,=E2=80=9D and he pointed to the undulating banks cove=
red with rare shrubs, and=20

touching the waters of the lake.  =E2=80=9CAnd where is Mirabel?=E2=80=9D s=
aid Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt was a green island in the=20

Adriatic,=E2=80=9D said the lady, =E2=80=9Cwhich belonged to Colonel Campia=
n; we lost it in the troubles. Colonel=20

Campian was very fond of it. I try to persuade him that our home was of vol=
canic origin, and has=20

only vanished and subsided into its native bed.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd were=
 not you fond of it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI never think of=20

the past,=E2=80=9D said the lady.  =E2=80=9COxford is not the first place w=
here I had the pleasure of meeting you,=E2=80=9D=20

Lothair ventured at length to observe.  =E2=80=9CYes, we have met before, i=
n Hyde Park Gardens. Our=20

hostess is a clever woman, and has been very kind to some friends of mine.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd have you seen=20

her lately?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CShe comes to see us sometimes. We do not liv=
e in London, but in the vicinity. We=20

only go to London for the opera, of which we are devotees. We do not at all=
 enter general society;=20

Colonel Campian only likes people who interest or amuse him, and he is fort=
unate in having rather=20

a numerous acquaintance of that kind.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CRare fortune!=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CColonel Campian lived a=20

great deal at Paris before we marred,=E2=80=9D said the lady, =E2=80=9Cand =
in a circle of considerable culture and=20

excitement. He is social, but not conventional.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd you=
=E2=80=94are you conventional?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I live=20

only for climate and the affections,=E2=80=9D said the lady =E2=80=9CI am f=
ond of society that pleases me, that is,=20

accomplished and natural and ingenious; otherwise I prefer being alone. As =
for atmosphere, as I=20

look upon it as the main source of felicity, you may be surprised that I sh=
ould reside in your=20

country. I should myself like to go to America, but that would not suit=20


_
geese, at first the cub was rather shy, for the gobbler turkey, the gander =
and the rooster all set=20

upon him and drove him whining into the woodshed; but he soon learned that =
all were afraid of his=20

paws, when he stood upon his hind legs and really hit out with them, so aft=
er that discovery, he=20

was master of all the feathered folk about the farmhouse.  All about the fa=
rm-buildings the little=20

bear followed his master.  But best of all he liked to go to the stable and=
 watch the milking, for in=20

one corner was a small dish, into which he knew a pint of warm milk would b=
e poured as soon as=20

milking was done.  One morning the farmer heard a great noise in the hen-ho=
use.  Europe, we=20

must live in England. It is not pleasant to reside in a country where, if y=
ou happen to shelter or=20

succor a friend, you may be subject to a domiciliary visit.=E2=80=9D  The p=
rofessor stopped to deliver a=20

lecture or address on the villa of Hadrian. Nothing could be more minute or=
 picturesque than his=20

description of that celebrated pleasaunce. It was varied by portraits of th=
e emperor and some of=20

his companions, and, after a rapid glance at the fortunes of the imperial p=
atriciate, wound up with=20

some conclusions favorable to communism. It was really very clever, and wou=
ld have made the=20

fortune of a literary society.  =E2=80=9CI wonder if they had gravel-walks =
in the=20


_
were kedacuting for dear life and he hastened to the scene of the disturban=
ce.  What he=20

discovered was both ludicrous and annoying, for there by one of the nests w=
as his small bear in=20

the act of pawing out an egg, while the empty shell of another upon the gro=
und told only too plainly=20

that he had discovered the use of eggs.  After that the hen-house was never=
 quite safe from him.=20

Whenever he was caught inside, he was punished, but hens' nests that he fou=
nd out-of-doors=20

were considered his natural plunder.  June came, and the latter part of the=
 month the bear-shadow=20

followed its master into the hayfield.  Here it the colonel. =E2=80=9CWhat =
I admire most in your country, my=20

lord, are your gravel-walks, though that lady would not agree with me that =
matter.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou are=20

against gravel-walks,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, I cannot bring=
 myself to believe that they had gravel-

walks in the garden of Eden,=E2=80=9D said the lady.  They had a repast at =
Woodstock, too late for=20

luncheon, too early for dinner, but which it was agreed should serve as the=
 latter meal.  =E2=80=9CThat suits=20

me exactly,=E2=80=9D said the lady; =E2=80=9CI am a great foe to dinners, a=
nd indeed to all meals. I think when the=20

good time comes we shall give up eating in public, except perhaps fruit on =
a green=20
