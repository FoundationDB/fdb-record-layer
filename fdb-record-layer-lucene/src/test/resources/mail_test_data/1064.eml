assured me that these people would do me no harm...." But now when the woman had ceased 

speaking there was a general murmur of:  "Throw her out! Spy or aristo we don't want her here!" 

whilst some of the men added significantly: "I am sure that she is one of Carrier's spies and in 

league with his Marats! We shall have those devils in here in a moment if we don't look out! Throw 

her out before she can signal to the Marats!"  Ugly faces charged with hatred and virulence were 

thrust threateningly forward--one or two of the women were obviously looking forward to joining in 

the scramble, when this "stuck-up wench" would presently be hurled out into the street.  "Now 

then, my girl, out you get," concluded the woman Lemoine, as with an expressive gesture she 

proceeded to roll her sleeves higher up her arm. She was about to lay her dirty hands on Yvonne, 

and the poor girl was nearly sick with horror, when one of the men--a huge, coarse giant, whose 

muscular torso, covered with grease and care for releegion, for I don't believe in it, but you may 

read if you like--it may amuse me, an' will help to make the time pass--whatever."  Thus the 

custom was established.  It was plain that the old woman counted much on the influence of the 

simple Word of God, without comment, for every time she opened the Bible she shut her eyes and 

her lips moved in silent prayer before she began to read.  The invalid was greatly tickled with this 

little preliminary prayer, and would have laughed aloud if he had not been too weak to do so.  As 

time went on, however, he became interested in the Gospel narratives in spite of himself, and he 

began to experience some sort of relish for the evening reading--chiefly because, as he carefully 

explained to Elspie, "the droning o' the old wumman's voice" sent him to sleep.  Meanwhile the 

other invalid--Duncan senior--progressed as slowly as did his son.  The nursing of him was 

undertaken chiefly by Jessie Davidson-- the sympathetic Jessie--who was

arm and dragged her back a step or two away from Yvonne.  "Don't be a fool, _petite mere_," he 

said, accompanying this admonition with a blasphemous oath. "Slut or no, the wench may as well 

pay you something for the privilege of staying here. Look at that cloak she's wearing--the shoe-

leather on her feet. Aren't _pro tem_, for that very purpose.  She was ably seconded--during part 

of each day--by Billie Sinclair, between whom and the old Highlander there grew up at that time a 

strong friendship.  For many weeks poor old McKay was confined to his bed, and then, when 

allowed to rise, he could only walk across his room with the aid of the strong arm of his stalwart 

son Fergus.  To sit at his open window and look out at
