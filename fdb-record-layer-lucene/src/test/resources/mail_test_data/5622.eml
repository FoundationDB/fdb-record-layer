The real reason why Paul is shown as "abrogating the law" can be found only=
 in India, where to=20

this day the most ancient customs and privileges are preserved in all their=
 purity, notwithstanding=20

the abuse levelled at the same. There is only one class of persons who can =
disregard the law of=20

Brahmanical institutions, caste included, with impunity, and that is the _p=
erfect_ "Svamis," the=20

Yogis--who have reached, or are supposed to have reached, the first step to=
wards the Jivanmukta=20

state--or the full Initiates. And Paul was undeniably an Initiate. We will =
quote a passage or two=20

from _Isis Unveiled_, for we can say now nothing better than what was said =
then:       Take Paul,=20

read the little of original that is left of him in the     writings attribu=
ted to this brave, honest, sincere=20

man, and see     whether which is generally in form an action for a tortiou=
s act, or neglect, the=20

physician cannot plead the performance of services and the non-payment of h=
is bill as a counter-

claim or recoupment, because that arises on a contract. If there is any exc=
eption to this rule it will=20

be found to grow out of the language of sections 549 and 550 of the Code of=
 Civil Procedure of the=20

State of New York, and of similar enactments in other States, which permit =
counter-claims arising=20

out of the same subject-matter as the cause of action, to be pleaded in tha=
t action. In New York=20

State, however, any effect of that kind is negatived by the general provisi=
on that the actions must=20

not only arise out of the same subject-matter but be of the same kind and c=
lass.  [178] The degree=20

of care and skill required to be shown to entitle=20


_
the word Christ anything more than the abstract ideal of the     personal d=
ivinity indwelling in man.=20

For Paul, Christ is not a     person, but an embodied idea. "If any man is =
in Christ he is a new=20

creation," _he is reborn_, as after initiation, for the Lord is     spirit-=
-the spirit of man. Paul was the=20

only one of the apostles     who had understood the secret ideas underlying=
 the teachings of=20

Jesus, although he had never met him.   But Paul himself was not infallible=
 or perfect.       Bent=20

upon inaugurating a new and broad reform, one embracing the     whole of hu=
manity, he sincerely=20

set his own doctrines far above     the wisdom of the ages, above the ancie=
nt Mysteries and final=20

revelation to the Epoptae.      Another proof that Paul belonged to the cir=
cle of the "Initiates"     lies=20

in the following fact. The apostle had his head shorn at     Ceuchreae, whe=
re Lucius (_Apuleius_)=20

was initiated, because "he had     a vow." The Nazars--or set apart--as we =
see in the Jewish=20

Scriptures, had to cut their hair, which they wore long, and which     "no =
razor touched" at any=20

other time, and sacrifice it on the     altar of initiation. And the Nazars=
 were a class of Chaldaean=20

Theurgists or Initiates.   It is shown in _Isis Unveiled_ that Jesus belong=
ed to this class.       Paul=20

declares that: "According to the grace of God which is given     unto me, a=
s a wise _master-

builder_, I have laid the foundation."     (_I. Corinth._, iii. 10.)      T=
his expression, master-builder,=20

used only _once_ in the whole     _Bible_, and by Paul, may be considered a=
s a whole revelation.=20

In     the Mysteries, the third part of the sacred rites was called     Epo=
pteia, or revelation, reception=20

into the secrets. In substance     it means the highest stage of clairvoyan=
ce--the divine; ... but the=20

real significance of the word is "overseeing," from {~GREEK SMALL LETTER OM=
ICRON WITH=20

same meaning     originally, though now it is understood as meaning "to    =
 obtain."(224)      The=20

[181] The conservatism=20

of lawyers is proverbial. It is hard to convince them that forms that have =
been long in use and have=20

been found to serve a useful purpose in the past, are not applicable to new=
 conditions as they=20

arise; for instance, that the methods of procuring the attendance and of ex=
amining ordinary=20

witnesses do not fit the necessities of expert testimony. But the question =
as to the defects of the=20

system as it now exists has been brought to public attention in the journal=
s of the day, in papers=20

read before medical societies and bar associations, and in arguments in leg=
islative bodies, and it=20

is hoped and believed that ere long a reform, something of the character in=
dicated, may be=20

brought about in this very important matter.  [182] It has been a matter of=
 great discussion whether=20

an expert is compellable to testify on matters of opinion, without compensa=
tion, the weight of the=20

decisions being that he is not bound to do so. 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, =C2=

he title of master-mason,=20

in Freemasonry, is derived     from this, in the sense used in the Mysterie=
s. Therefore, when=20

Paul entitles himself a "master-builder," he is using a word pre-     emine=
ntly kabalistic, theurgic,=20

and masonic, and one which no     other apostle uses. He thus declares hims=
