Ted realized that he was about to exchange his blue fish for a shark.  The =
shark swallowed the=20

fish, hook and all. At once Ted felt the line shoot through his fingers. Gr=
ipping desperately, he=20

checked the line. He felt his raft being towed rapidly through the water.  =
The shark went down. The=20

raft tilted at a dangerous angle. A hundred thoughts sped through the boy's=
 mind. He might be lost=20

for days, perhaps weeks. Without food he must perish. No line, no fish, no =
food. But if the raft went=20

over? What then? Soaked to the skin, he would in the end be obliged to yiel=
d his line. Then a=20

happy thought struck him. In his emergency kit were other hooks, and in his=
 parachute many lines.=20

parts (Plate II.).  Chambert[719] concludes that in living bodies and in de=
ad bodies within twenty-

four hours after death blisters can be produced, and that less heat will de=
velop them in the living.=20

He specially emphasizes the difference, in the albuminous character of the =
contents, of a blister=20

formed ante mortem and of one formed post mortem.  Jastrowitz[720] emphasiz=
es the difference=20

between blisters formed during life and those occurring in =C5=93dematous c=
onditions.  Blisters are to=20

be distinguished from the bull=C3=A6 arising from putrefaction. There is li=
ttle danger of confounding=20

such cases. In conditions of putrefaction no redness or line of demarcation=
 exists, and the green=20

discoloration and other conditions of the skin will suffice to establish th=
e diagnosis.=20
