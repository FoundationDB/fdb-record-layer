was not through idleness but physical weakness. They are small men, and the=
y are a class who=20

are not well fed. They live entirely on vegetable food, and they scarcely e=

natural to suppose that the want of meat is the cause of their inefficiency=
. Yet the common farm=20

labourer in England, who does a very hard and long day's work, hardly taste=
s meat, in many=20

counties, the year round.  In the case of the Crimean railway, private ente=

memorable manner, to the assistance of a government overwhelmed by administ=
rative difficulties.=20

A forty years peace had rusted the machinery of the war department, while t=
he machinery of=20

railway construction was in the highest working order. Sir John Burgoyne, t=
he chief of the=20

engineering staff, testified that it was impossible to overrate the service=
s rendered by the railway,=20

or its effects in shortening the time of the siege, and alleviating the fat=

 temporary, as was=20

Updated editions will replace the period of the Crimean war itself, when th=
e British army was well=20

supplied, while the French administration broke down. On the other hand the=
 resources of private=20

industry, on which the embarrassed government drew, are always there; and t=
heir immense=20

auxiliary power would be at once manifested if England should become involv=
ed in a dangerous=20

war. It should be remembered, too, that the crushing war expenditure in tim=
e of peace, which=20

alarmists always advocate, would prevent the growth of those resources, and=
 deprive England of=20

the "sinews of war."  The Danish railways brought the British navvy again i=
nto comparison with his=20

foreign rivals. Mr. Rowan, the agent of Messrs. Peto and Brassey, was great=

Danish labourers, but, on being pressed, said, "No man is equal to the Brit=
ish navvy; but the Dane,=20

from his steady, constant labour, is a good workman, and a first-class one =
will do nearly as much=20

work in a day as an Englishman." The Dane takes time: his habit is in summe=
r to begin work at=20

four in the morning, and continue till eight in the evening, taking five in=
tervals of rest.  The Danish=20

engineers, in Mr. Rowan's judgment, are over-educated, and, as a consequenc=
