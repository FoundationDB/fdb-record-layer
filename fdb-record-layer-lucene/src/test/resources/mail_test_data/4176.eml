the "Spirits of the Departed."(848) So far is this from being the case, tha=
t in dreams, though=20

Antahkarana is there, the personality is only half awake; therefore, Antahk=
arana is said to be=20

_drunk_ or _insane_ during our normal sleeping state. If such is the case d=
uring the periodical=20

death, or sleep, of the living body, one may judge what the consciousness o=
f Antahkarana is like=20

when it has been transformed after the "eternal sleep" into Kama Rupa.  But=
 to return. In order not=20

to confuse the mind of the Western student with the abstruse difficulties o=
f Indian metaphysics, let=20

him view the lower Manas, or Mind, as the personal Ego during the waking st=
ate, and as=20

Antahkarana only during those moments when it aspires towards its Higher Eg=
o, and thus=20

becomes the medium of communication between the two. It is for this reason =
that it is called the=20

"Path." Now, when a limb or organ belonging to the physical organism is lef=
t in disuse, it becomes=20

weak and finally atrophies. So also is it with mental faculties; and hence =
the atrophy of the lower=20

mind-function, called Antahkarana, becomes comprehensible in both completel=
y materialistic and=20

depraved natures.  According to Esoteric Philosophy, however, the teaching =
is as follows: Seeing=20

that the faculty and function of Antahkarana is as necessary as the medium =
of the ear for hearing,=20

or that of the eye for seeing; then so long as the feeling of Ahankara, tha=
t is, of the personal "I" or=20

selfishness, is not entirely crushed out in a man, and the lower mind not e=
ntirely merged into and=20

become one with the Higher Buddhi-Manas, it stands to reason that to destro=
y Antahkarana is like=20

destroying a bridge over an impassable chasm; _the traveller can never reac=
h the goal on the=20

other shore_. And here lies the difference between the exoteric and Esoteri=
c teaching. The former=20

makes the Vedanta state that so long as Mind (the lower) clings through Ant=
ahkarana to Spirit=20

(Buddhi-Manas) it is impossible for it to acquire true Spiritual Wisdom, Gn=
yana, and that this can=20

only be attained by seeking to come _en rapport_ with the Universal Soul (A=
tma); that, in fact, it is=20

by ignoring the Higher Mind altogether that one reaches Raja Yoga. We say i=
t is not so. No single=20

rung of the ladder leading to knowledge can be skipped. No personality can =
ever reach or bring=20

itself into communication with Atma, except through Buddhi-Manas; to try an=
d become a=20

Jivanmukta or a Mahatma, before one has become an Adept or even a Narjol (a=
 sinless man) is=20

like trying to reach Ceylon from India without crossing the sea. Therefore =
we are told that if we=20

destroy Antahkarana before the personal is absolutely under the control of =
the impersonal Ego, we=20

risk to lose the latter and be severed for ever from it, unless indeed we h=
asten to re-establish the=20

communication by a supreme and final effort.  It is only when we are indiss=
olubly linked with the=20

essence of the Divine Mind, that we have to destroy Antahkarana.       Like=
 as a solitary warrior=20

pursued by an army, seeks refuge in a     stronghold; to cut himself off fr=
om the enemy, he first=20

destroys     the drawbridge, and then only commences to destroy the pursuer=
; so     must the=20

Srotapatti act before he slays Antahkarana.   Or as an Occult axiom has it:=
       _The Unit becomes=20

Three, and Three generate Four. It is for the     latter [the Quaternary] t=
o rebecome Three, and for=20

the Divine     Three to expand into the Absolute One._   Monads, which beco=
me Duads on the=20

differentiated plane, to develop into Triads during the cycle of incarnatio=
ns, even when incarnated=20

know neither space nor time, but are diffused through the lower Principles =
of the Quaternary,=20

being omnipresent and omniscient in their nature. But this omniscience is i=
nnate, and can manifest=20

its reflected light only through that which is at least semi-terrestrial or=
 material; even as the=20

physical brain which, in its turn, is the vehicle of the lower Manas enthro=
ned in Kama Rupa. And it=20

is this which is gradually annihilated in cases of "second death."  But suc=
h annihilation--which is in=20



reality the absence of the slightest trace of the doomed Soul from the eter=
nal MEMORY, and=20

therefore signifies annihilation in eternity--does not mean simply disconti=
nuation of human life on=20

earth, for earth is Avitchi, and the worst Avitchi possible. Expelled for e=
ver from the consciousness=20

of the Individuality, the reincarnating Ego, the physical atoms and psychic=
 vibrations of the now=20

separate personality are immediately reincarnated on the same earth, only i=
n a lower and still=20

more abject creature, a human being only in form, doomed to Karmic torments=
 during the whole of=20

its new life. Moreover, if it persists in its criminal or debauched course,=
 out. Ten minutes elapsed,=20

during which D'Artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelop=
e what was written on=20

the second. But he did not succeed.  Mazarin returned, pale, and evidently =
thoughtful. He seated=20

himself at his desk and D'Artagnan proceeded to examine his face, as he had=
 just examined the=20

letter he held, but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as =
impenetrable as that=20

which covered the letter.  "Ah!" thought the Gascon; "he looks displeased. =
Can it be with me? He=20

meditates. Is it about sending me to the Bastile? All very fine, my lord, b=
ut at the very first hint you=20

give of such a thing I will strangle you and become Frondist. I should be c=
arried home in triumph=20

like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus. It wo=
uld be exceedingly=20

droll."  The Gascon, with his vivid imagination, had already seen the advan=
tage to be derived from=20

his situation. Mazarin gave, however, no order of the kind, but on the cont=
rary began to be=20

insinuating.  "You were right," he said, "my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, and =
you cannot set out yet.=20

I beg you to return me that dispatch."  D'Artagnan obeyed, and Mazarin asce=
rtained that the seal=20

was intact.  "I shall want you this evening," he said "Return in two hours.=
"  "My lord," said=20

D'Artagnan, "I have an appointment in two hours which I cannot miss."  "Do =
not be uneasy," said=20

Mazarin; "it is the same."  "Good!" thought D'Artagnan; "I fancied it was s=
o."  "Return, then, at five=20

o'clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you. Only, leave him =
in the ante-room, as I=20

wish to speak to you alone."  D'Artagnan bowed, and thought: "Both at the s=
ame hour; both=20

commands alike; both at the Palais Royal. Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hun=
dred thousand=20

francs for such a secret!"  "You are thoughtful," said Mazarin, uneasily.  =
"Yes, I was thinking=20

whether we ought to come armed or not."  "Armed to the teeth!" replied Maza=
rin.  "Very well, my=20

lord; it shall be so."  D'Artagnan saluted, went out and hastened to repeat=
 to his friend Mazarin's=20

flattering promises, which gave Porthos an indescribable happiness.     51.=
 The Flight.   When=20

D'Artagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five o'clock, it presented, in s=
pite of the excitement=20

which reigned in the town, a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing. Nor was t=
hat surprising. The=20

queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore=
 nothing to fear,=20

since the people had nothing more just then to ask for. The return, also, o=
f the conqueror of Lens=20

was the pretext for giving a grand banquet. The princes and princesses were=
 invited and their=20

carriages had crowded the court since noon; then after dinner the queen was=
 to have a play in her=20

apartment. Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that d=
ay--radiant with grace=20

and wit. Mazarin disappeared as they rose from table. He found D'Artagnan w=
aiting for him=20

already at his post in the ante-room.  The cardinal advanced to him with a =
smile and taking him by=20

the hand led him into his study.  "My dear M. d'Artagnan," said the ministe=
r, sitting down, "I am=20

about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give=
 an officer."  "I hope,"=20

said D'Artagnan, bowing, "that you give it, my lord, without hesitation and=
 with the conviction that I=20

am worthy of it."  "More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend; there=
fore I apply to you. We=20



are about to leave this evening," continued Mazarin. "My dear M. d'Artagnan=
, the welfare of the=20

state is deposited in your hands." He paused.  "Explain yourself, my lord, =
I am listening."  "The=20

queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germai=
n."  "Aha!" said=20

D'Artagnan, "that is to say, the queen wishes to leave Paris."  "A woman's =
caprice--you=20

understand."  "Yes, I understand perfectly," said D'Artagnan.  "It was for =
this she summoned you=20

this morning and that she told you to return at five o'clock."  "Was it wor=
th while to wish me to=20

swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one?" muttere=
d D'Artagnan. "Oh,=20

women! women! whether queens or not, they are always the same."  "Do you di=
sapprove of this=20

journey, my dear M. d'Artagnan?" asked Mazarin, anxiously.  "I, my lord?" s=
aid D'Artagnan; "why=20

should I?"  "Because you shrug your shoulders."  "It is a way I have of spe=
aking to myself. I neither=20

approve nor disapprove, my lord; I merely await your commands."  "Good; it =
is you, accordingly,=20

that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain=
."  "Liar!" thought=20

D'Artagnan.  "You see, therefore," continued the cardinal, perceiving D'Art=
agnan's composure,=20

"that, as I have told you, the welfare of the state is placed in your hands=
."=20


_
series of immediate reincarnations.  Here two questions present themselves:=
 (1) What becomes of=20

the Higher Ego in such cases? (2) What kind of an animal is a human creatur=
e born soulless?=20

Before answering these two very natural queries, I have to draw the attenti=
on of all of you who are=20

born in Christian countries to the fact that the romance of the vicarious a=
tonement and the mission=20

of Jesus, as it now stands, was drawn or borrowed by some too liberal Initi=
ates from the=20

mysterious and weird tenet of the earthly experience of the reincarnating E=
go. The latter is indeed=20

the sacrificial victim of, and through, its own Karma in previous Manvantar=
as, which takes upon=20

itself voluntarily the duty of saving what would be otherwise soulless men =
or personalities. Eastern=20

truth is thus more philosophical and logical than Western fiction. The Chri=
stos, or Buddhi-Manas of=20

each man is not quite an innocent and sinless God, though in one sense it i=
s the "Father," being of=20

the same essence with the Universal Spirit, and at the same time the "Son,"=
 for Manas is the=20

second remove from the "Father." By incarnation the Divine Son makes itself=
 responsible for the=20

sins of all the personalities which it will inform. This it can do only thr=
ough its proxy or reflection,=20

the lower Manas. The only case in which the Divine Ego can escape individua=
l penalty and=20

responsibility as a guiding Principle, is when  "You accept, however?"  "I =
always accept."  "Do you=20

think the thing possible?"  "Everything is possible."  "Shall you be attack=
ed on the road?"=20

"Probably."  "And what will you do in that case?"  "I shall pass through th=
ose who attack me."=20

"And suppose you cannot pass through them?"  "So much the worse for them; I=
 shall pass over=20

them."  "And you will place the king and queen in safety also, at Saint Ger=
main?"  "Yes."  "On your=20

life?"  "On my life."  "You are a hero, my friend," said Mazarin, gazing at=
 the musketeer with=20

admiration.  D'Artagnan smiled.  "And I?" asked Mazarin, after a moment's s=
ilence.  "How? and=20

you, my lord?"  "If I wish to leave?"  "That would be much more difficult."=
  "Why so?"  "Your=20

eminence might be recognized."  "Even under this disguise?" asked Mazarin, =
raising a cloak which=20

covered an arm-chair, upon which lay a complete dress for an officer, of pe=
arl-gray and red,=20

entirely embroidered with silver.  "If your eminence is disguised it will b=
e almost easy."  "Ah!" said=20

Mazarin, breathing more freely.  "But it will be necessary for your eminenc=
e to do what the other=20

day you declared you should have done in our place--cry, 'Down with Mazarin=
!'"  "I will: 'Down with=20

Mazarin'"  "In French, in good French, my lord, take care of your accent; t=
hey killed six thousand=20

Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian badly. Take care that th=
e French do not take=20


_
psychic and astral vibrations, is then, by the very intensity of its combin=
ations, placed beyond the=20

control of the Ego. Apophis, the Dragon, having become the conqueror, the r=
eincarnating Manas,=20

separating itself gradually from its tabernacle, breaks finally asunder fro=
m the psycho- animal=20

Soul.  Thus, in answer to the first question, I say:  (1) The Divine Ego do=
es one of two things:=20

either (_a_) it recommences immediately under its own Karmic impulses a fre=
sh series of=20

incarnations; or (_b_) it seeks and finds refuge in the bosom of the Mother=
, Alaya, the Universal=20

Soul, of which the Manvantaric aspect is Mahat. Freed from the life-impress=
ions of the personality,=20

it merges into a kind of Nirvanic interlude, wherein there can be nothing b=
ut the eternal Present,=20

which absorbs the Past and Future. Bereft of the "labourer," both field and=
 harvest now being lost,=20

the Master, in the infinitude of his thought, naturally preserves no recoll=
ection of the finite and=20

evanescent illusion which had been his last personality. And then, indeed, =
is the latter annihilated.=20

(2) The future of the lower Manas is more terrible, and still more terrible=
 to humanity than to the=20

now animal man. It sometimes happens that after the separation the exhauste=
d Soul, now become=20

supremely animal, fades out in Kama Loka, as do all other animal souls. But=
 seeing that the more=20

material is the human mind, the longer it lasts, even in the intermediate s=
tage, it frequently=20

happens that after the present life of the soulless man is ended, he is aga=
in and again=20

reincarnated into new personalities, each one more abject than the other. T=
he impulse of _animal=20

life_ is too strong; it cannot wear itself out in one or two lives only. In=
 rarer cases, however, when=20

the lower Manas is doomed to exhaust itself by _starvation_; when there is =
no longer hope that=20

even a remnant of a lower light will, owing to favourable conditions--say, =
even a short period of=20

spiritual aspiration the Sicilian vespers."  "I will do my best."  "The str=
eets are full of armed men,"=20

continued D'Artagnan. "Are you sure that no one is aware of the queen's pro=
ject?"  Mazarin=20

reflected.  "This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor, my lo=
rd; the chance of being=20

attacked would be an excuse for everything."  Mazarin shuddered, but he ref=
lected that a man who=20

had the least intention to betray would not warn first.  "And therefore," a=
dded he, quietly, "I have=20

not confidence in every one; the proof of which is, that I have fixed upon =
you to escort me."  "Shall=20

you not go with the queen?"  "No," replied Mazarin.  "Then you will start a=
fter the queen?"  "No,"=20

said Mazarin again.  "Ah!" said D'Artagnan, who began to understand.  "Yes,=
" continued the=20

cardinal. "I have my plan. With the queen I double her risk; after the quee=
n her departure would=20

double mine; then, the court once safe, I might be forgotten. The great are=
 often ungrateful."  "Very=20

true," said D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes, in spite of himself, on the queen'=
s diamond, which Mazarin=20

wore on his finger. Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently t=
urned the hoop of the=20

ring inside.  "I wish," he said, with his cunning smile, "to prevent them f=
rom being ungrateful to=20

me."  "It is but Christian charity," replied D'Artagnan, "not to lead one's=
 neighbors into temptation."=20

"It is exactly for that reason," said Mazarin, "that I wish to start before=
 them."  D'Artagnan smiled--

he was just the man to understand the astute Italian. Mazarin saw the smile=
 and profited by the=20

moment.  "You will begin, therefore, by taking me first out of Paris, will =
you not, my dear M.=20

d'Artagnan?"  "A difficult commission, my lord," replied D'Artagnan, resumi=
ng his serious manner.=20

"But," said Mazarin, "you did not make so many difficulties with regard to =
the king and queen."=20

"The king and the queen are my king and queen," replied the musketeer, "my =
life is theirs and I=20

must give it=20


_
Ego, and Karma leads the Higher Ego back to new incarnations, then somethin=
g far more dreadful=20

may happen. The Kama-Manasic spook may become that which is called in Occul=
tism the=20

"Dweller on the Threshold." This Dweller is not like that which is describe=
d so graphically in=20

_Zanoni_, but an actual fact in Nature and not a fiction in romance, howeve=
r I to say?"  "That is=20

true," murmured Mazarin, in a low tone, "but as thy life is not mine I supp=
ose I must buy it, must I=20

not?" and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside agai=
n. D'Artagnan smiled.=20

These two men met at one point and that was, cunning; had they been actuate=
d equally by=20

courage, the one would have done great things for=20
