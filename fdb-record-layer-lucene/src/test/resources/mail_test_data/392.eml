isking, indeed, the possession of New _
my colleague's adherents! People would be only too ready to interpret our a=
ction as a sign that=20

neither you nor I had the right faith in a Higher Providence.  MRS. ALVING.=
 But for your own part,=20

my dear Pastor, you can at least tell yourself that--  MANDERS. Yes, I know=
--I know; my=20

conscience would be quite easy, that is true enough. But nevertheless we sh=
ould not escape=20

grave misinterpretation; and that might very likely react unfavourably upon=
 the Orphanage.  MRS.=20

ALVING. Well, in that case--  MANDERS. Nor can I entirely lose sight of the=
 difficult--I may even=20

say painful--position in which _I_ might perhaps be placed. In the leading =
circles of the town,=20

people take a lively interest in this Orphanage. It is, of course, founded =
partly for the benefit of the=20

town, as well; and it is to be hoped it will, to a considerable extent, res=
ult in lightening our Poor=20

Rates. Now, as I have been your adviser, and have had the business arrangem=
ents in my hands, I=20

cannot but fear that I may have to bear the brunt of fanaticism--  MRS. ALV=
ING. Oh, you mustn't=20

run the risk of that.  MANDERS. To say nothing of the attacks that would as=
suredly be made upon=20

me in certain papers and periodicals, which--  MRS. ALVING. Enough, my dear=
 Pastor Manders.=20

That consideration is quite decisive.  MANDERS. Then you do not wish the Or=
phanage to be=20

insured?  MRS. ALVING. No. We will let it alone.  MANDERS. [Leaning back in=
 his chair.] But if,=20

now, a disaster were to happen? One can never tell--Should you be able to m=
ake good the=20

damage?  MRS. ALVING. No; I tell you plainly I should do nothing of the kin=
d.  MANDERS. Then I=20

must tell you, Mrs. Alving--we are taking no small responsibility upon ours=
elves.  MRS. ALVING.=20

Do you think we can do otherwise?  MANDERS. No, that is just the point; we =
really cannot do=20

otherwise. We ought not to expose ourselves to misinterpretation; and we ha=
ve no right whatever=20

to give offence to the weaker brethren.  MRS. ALVING. You, as a clergyman, =
certainly should not.=20

MANDERS. I really think, too, we may trust that such an institution has for=
tune on its side; in fact,=20

that it stands under a special providence.  MRS. ALVING. Let us hope so, Pa=
stor Manders.=20

MANDERS. Then we will let it take its chance?  MRS. ALVING. Yes, certainly.=
  MANDERS. Very=20

well. So be it. [Makes a note.] Then--no insurance.  MRS. ALVING. It's odd =
that you should just=20

happen to mention the matter to-day--  MANDERS. I have often thought of ask=
ing you about it--=20

MRS. ALVING.--for we very nearly had a fire down there yesterday.  MANDERS.=
 You don't say=20

so!  MRS. ALVING. Oh, it was a trifling matter. A heap of shavings had caug=
ht fire in the=20

carpenter's workshop.  MANDERS. Where Engstrand works?  MRS. ALVING. Yes. T=
hey say he's=20

often very careless with matches.  MANDERS. He has so much on his mind, tha=
t man--so many=20

things to fight against. Thank God, he is now striving to lead a decent lif=
e, I hear.  MRS. ALVING.=20

Indeed! Who says so?  MANDERS. He himself assures me of it. And he is certa=
inly a capital=20

workman.  MRS. ALVING. Oh, yes; so long as he's sober--  MANDERS. Ah, that =
melancholy=20

weakness! But, he is often driven to it by his injured leg, he says. Last t=
ime he was in town I was=20

really touched by him. He came and thanked me so warmly for having got him =
work here, so that=20

he might be near Regina.  MRS. ALVING. He doesn't see much of her.  army, G=
rant had a=20

powerful auxiliary in the fleet, which now numbered seventy craft, large an=
d small, manned by fifty-

five hundred sailors and commanded by David D. Porter, an indefatigable chi=
ef.  Grant at the=20

outset could, of course, have no fixed plan. Throughout February and March =
his operations were=20

tentative; and though the country murmured at his =E2=80=9Cinactivity,=E2=
=80=9D never did general or army do harder=20

work. Might not Vicksburg perhaps be isolated on the west, and a way be fou=
nd beyond the reach=20

of its cannon to that vantage-ground south of it which seemed so inaccessib=
le? Straightway the=20



army tried, with spade, pick, and axe, to complete the cut-off which Willia=
ms had begun the=20

previous summer; also to open a tortuous and embarrassed passage far round =
through Lake=20

Providence and the Tensas and Washita rivers. Might not some insufficiently=
 guarded approach=20

be found through the Yazoo bottom[233] to Haines=E2=80=99 Bluff, the height=
 dominating Vicksburg from=20

the northeast, which Sherman had sought to seize at Chickasaw Bayou? Straig=
htway there were=20

enterprises seldom attempted in war.[234] The levee at Yazoo Pass was cut, =
far up the river, so=20

that the swollen Mississippi flooded the wide region below. Through the cre=
vasse plunged gunboat=20

and transport, to engage in amphibious warfare; soldiers wading in the mire=
 or swimming the=20

bayous; divisions struggling to _terra firma_, only to find that Pemberton =
was there before them=20

behind unassailable parapets; gunboats wedged in ditches, unable to turn, w=
ith hostile axemen=20

blocking both advance and retreat by felling trees across the channel; Port=
er sheltering himself=20

from sharpshooters within a section of broken smokestack and meditating the=
 blowing-up of his=20

boats; Sherman now paddling in a canoe, now riding bareback, now joining th=
e men of a rescue-

party in a double-quick--all in cypress forests draped with funereal moss, =
as if Death had made=20

ready for a calamity that seemed certain.  April came, and nothing had been=
 accomplished on the=20

north or west. To try again from the east meant summary removal for the com=
mander. Was an=20

attack from the south, after all, out of the question, as all his lieutenan=
ts urged? Grant resolved to=20

try; the river-bank to the west was so far dried that the passage of a colu=
mn through the swamp-

roads became possible. Porter was willing to attempt to run the batteries, =
though sure that, if once=20

below, he could never return. The night of April 16th was one of wild excit=
ements. The fleet was=20

discovered as soon as it got under way, and conflagrations, blazing right a=
nd left, clearly revealed=20

it as it swept down the stream. The Confederate fire could not be concentra=
ted,[235] and hence=20

the injury was small to the armored craft; and even the transports in their=
 company, protected only=20

by baled hay or cotton, escaped with one exception. A few days later transp=
orts and barges again=20

passed down.[236] The column, toiling along the swampy road, was met, when =
at last it reached a=20

point well below the town, by an abundance of supplies and ample means for =
placing it on the=20

other bank. April 29th, Grand Gulf, the southern outpost of Vicksburg, was =
cannonaded, with ten=20

thousand men on transports at hand for an assault, if the chance came. High=
 on its bluff, it defied=20

the bombardment, as the main citadel had done. Then it was that Grant turne=
d to his last=20

resource.=20


_
himself.  MRS. ALVING. Well, it may be so.  MANDERS. He feels so acutely th=
at he needs some=20

one to keep a firm hold on him when temptation comes. That is what I cannot=
 help liking about=20

Jacob Engstrand: he comes to you so helplessly, accusing himself and confes=
sing his own=20

weakness. The last time he was talking to me--Believe me, Mrs. Alving, supp=
osing it were a real=20

necessity for him to have Regina home again--  MRS. ALVING. [Rising hastily=
.] Regina!=20

MANDERS.--you must not set yourself against it.  MRS. ALVING. Indeed I shal=
l set myself against=20

it. And besides--Regina is to have a position in the Orphanage.  MANDERS. B=
ut, after all,=20

remember he is her father--  MRS. ALVING. Oh, I know very well what sort of=
 a father he has been=20

to her. No! She shall never go to him with my goodwill.  MANDERS. [Rising.]=
 My dear lady, don't=20

take the matter so warmly. You sadly misjudge poor Engstrand. You seem to b=
e quite terrified--=20

MRS. ALVING. [More quietly.] It makes no difference. I have taken Regina in=
to my house, and=20

there she shall stay. [Listens.] Hush, my dear Mr. Manders; say no more abo=
ut it. [Her face lights=20

up with gladness.] Listen! there is Oswald coming downstairs. Now we'll thi=
nk of no one but him.=20

[OSWALD ALVING, in a light overcoat, hat in hand, and smoking a large meers=
chaum, enters by=20

the door on the left; he stops in the doorway.]  OSWALD. Oh, I beg your par=
don; adopted could=20

succeed. First, the watchful Pemberton was bewildered and misled as to the =
point of attack. About=20

the time the batteries were run, Grierson, an Illinois officer, starting wi=
th seventeen hundred=20

cavalry from La Grange, Tennessee, raided completely through Mississippi, f=
rom north to south,=20

so skilfully creating an impression of large numbers, so effectively wrecki=
ng railroads and=20

threatening incursion now here and now there, that the back-country was thr=
own into a panic, and=20

Pemberton thought an attack in force from that direction possible. Followin=
g close upon Grierson=E2=80=99s=20

raid, Sherman demonstrated with such noise and parade north of the city tha=
t Pemberton sent=20

troops to meet a possible assault there. Meantime, the Thirteenth and Seven=
teenth corps were=20

ferried rapidly across the river below Grand Gulf, and, a footing on the up=
land having been=20

obtained unopposed, Grant stood fairly on the left bank. He now sent word t=
o Halleck that he felt=20

this battle was more than half won.[237]  [Illustration: SIEGE OF VICKSBURG=
]  The event proved=20

that Grant was not oversanguine. An easy victory at Port Gibson, over a bra=
ve but inferior force,=20

gave him Grand Gulf. Joined now by Sherman, he plunged with his three corps=
 into the interior,=20

cutting loose from his river base, and also from his hampering connection w=
ith Washington. The=20

previous fall he had learned to live off=20


_
forward.] Good-morning, Pastor Manders.  MANDERS. [Staring.] Ah--! How stra=
nge--!  MRS.=20

ALVING. Well now, what do you think of him, Mr. Manders?  MANDERS. I--I--ca=
n it really be--?=20

OSWALD. Yes, it's really the Prodigal Son, sir.  MANDERS. [Protesting.] My =
dear young friend--=20

OSWALD. Well, then, the Lost Sheep Found.  MRS. ALVING. Oswald is thinking =
of the time when=20

you were so much opposed to his becoming a painter.  MANDERS. To our human =
eyes many a=20

step seems dubious, which afterwards proves--[Wrings his hand.] But first o=
f all, welcome,=20

welcome home! Do not think, my dear Oswald--I suppose I may call you by you=
r Christian name?=20

OSWALD. What else should you call me?  MANDERS. Very good. What I wanted to=
 say was this,=20

my dear Oswald you must not think that I utterly condemn the artist's calli=
ng. I have no doubt there=20

are many who can keep their inner self unharmed in that profession, as in a=
ny other.  OSWALD.=20

Let us hope so.  MRS. ALVING. [Beaming with delight.] I know one who has ke=
pt both his inner=20

and his outer self unharmed. Just look at him, Mr. Manders.  OSWALD. [Moves=
 restlessly about=20

the room.] Yes, yes, my dear mother; let's say no more about it.  MANDERS. =
Why, certainly--that=20

is undeniable. And you have begun to make a name for yourself already. The =
newspapers have=20

often spoken of you, most favourably. Just lately, by-the-bye, I fancy I ha=
ven't seen your name=20

quite so often.  OSWALD. [Up in the conservatory.] I haven't been able to p=
aint so much lately.=20

MRS. ALVING. Even a painter needs a little rest now and then.  MANDERS. No =
doubt, no doubt.=20

And meanwhile he can be preparing himself and mustering his forces for some=
 great work.=20

OSWALD. Yes.--Mother, will dinner soon be ready?  MRS. ALVING. In less than=
 half an hour. He=20

has a capital appetite, thank God.  MANDERS. And a taste for tobacco, too. =
 OSWALD. I found=20

my father's pipe in my room--  MANDERS. Aha--then that accounts for it!  MR=
S. ALVING. For=20

what?  MANDERS. When Oswald appeared there, in the doorway, with the pipe i=
n his mouth, I=20

could have sworn I saw his father, large as life.  OSWALD. No, really?  MRS=
. ALVING. Oh, how=20

can you say so? and Jackson, gave him the state capital, and placed him, fu=
lly concentrated,=20

between the armies of Pemberton and Johnston. The number of his foes was sw=
elling fast--from=20

Port Hudson, from South Carolina, from Tennessee; but Grant did not let sli=
p his advantage.=20

Johnston, not yet recovered from his Fair Oaks wound, was not at his best. =
Pemberton, confused=20

by an adversary who could do so unmilitary a thing as to throw away his bas=
e, vacillated and=20

blundered. A heavy battle at Champion=E2=80=99s Hill, May 16th, in which th=
e completeness of Grant=E2=80=99s=20

victory was prevented by the bad conduct of McClernand, nevertheless result=
ed in Pemberton=E2=80=99s=20

precipitate flight. Next day the Federals seized the crossing of the Big Bl=
ack River, after which all=20

the outposts of Vicksburg, from Haines=E2=80=99 Bluff southward, fell witho=
ut further fighting, and=20

Pemberton, with the army that remained to him, was shut up within the works=
. The Federals held=20

all outside, looking down from those heights, which for so long had seemed =
to them impregnable,=20

upon the great river open to the north. Supplies and reinforcements could n=
ow come unhindered=20

and were already pouring in. The fall of Vicksburg was certain....  The sie=
ge once begun, the=20

fortress was doomed without recourse. Pemberton, to be sure, did not lose h=
eart, and drove back=20

the repeated Federal assaults with skill and courage. Johnston, from the re=
ar, mustered men as=20

he could, tried to concert with the besieged army a project of escape, and =
at last advanced to=20

attack. But within the city supplies soon failed, and outside no resources =
were at hand for the city=E2=80=99s=20

succor. Johnston=E2=80=99s request for twenty thousand men, lying idle in A=
rkansas had been=20

slighted;[238] there was no other source of supply. Kirby Smith and Dick Ta=
ylor attempted a=20



diversion on the west bank of the river; and still later, at Helena, Arkans=
as, a desperate push was=20

made to afford relief. It was all in vain. The North, made cheerful by long=
-delayed success, poured=20

forth to Grant out of its abundance both men and means. His army was in siz=
e nearly doubled;=20

food and munitions abounded. The starving defenders were inexorably encircl=
ed by=20


_
MANDERS. Yes, but there is an expression about the corners of the mouth--so=
mething about the=20

lips--that reminds one exactly of Alving: at any rate, now that he is smoki=
ng.  MRS. ALVING. Not in=20

the least. Oswald has rather a clerical curve about his mouth, I triumphant=
 foes. Grant=E2=80=99s assaults,=20

bold and bloody though they were, had little effect in bringing about the r=
esult; the close=20

investment would have sufficed.[239] On July 4th came the unconditional sur=
render. The=20

Confederate losses before the surrender were=20


_
MANDERS. Yes, yes; some of my colleagues have much the same expression.  MR=
S. ALVING.=20

But put your pipe away, my dear boy; I won't have smoking in here.  OSWALD.=
 [Does so.] By all=20

means. I only wanted to try it; for I once smoked it when I was a child.  M=
RS. ALVING. You?=20

OSWALD. Yes. I was quite small at the time. I recollect I came up to father=
's room one evening=20

when he was in great spirits.  MRS. ALVING. Oh, you can't recollect anythin=
g of those times.=20

OSWALD. Yes, I recollect it distinctly. He took me on his knee, and gave me=
 the pipe. "Smoke,=20

boy," he said; "smoke away, boy!" And I smoked as hard as I could, until I =
felt I was growing quite=20

pale, and the perspiration stood in great drops on my forehead. Then he bur=
st out laughing=20

heartily--  MANDERS. That was most extraordinary.  MRS. ALVING. My dear 29,=
491, became=20

prisoners, while in the fortress were 170 cannon and 50,000 small arms. Gra=
nt=E2=80=99s loss during the=20

whole campaign was 9362.[240]  To this triumph, a week later, was added the=
 fall of Port=20

Hudson,[241] which, with a depleted garrison, held out stubbornly for six w=
eeks against the=20

Federals. N.=C2=A0P. Banks, who after his tragical Virginia experiences suc=
ceeded, in December, 1862,=20

Butler in Louisiana, was set, as in the valley, to meet a difficult situati=
on with inadequate means.=20

With an army of little more than thirty thousand, in part nine-months men, =
he was expected to hold=20

New Orleans and such of Louisiana as had been conquered, and also to co-ope=
rate with Grant in=20

opening the Mississippi. When his garrisons had been placed he had scarcely=
 fifteen thousand=20

men left for service in the field, a number=20
