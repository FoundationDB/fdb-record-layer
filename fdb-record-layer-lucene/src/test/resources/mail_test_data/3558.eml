and enervated in temper, ground-hugging, grey and flat; if we have moods wh=
ich such writing=20

adequately represents, we have other moments more cheerful and creative, wh=
ich our architecture=20

and our engineering manage to express, but which cannot be guessed at in ou=

much as say that there is the least justification or excuse for these attem=
pts to defame Jeanne=20

d'Arc; to condemn her as a common virago because she sometimes uttered her =
commands with=20

too little regard for propriety in speech would be like condemning Washingt=
on because he could=20

and did, on=20


_
courage, and though they often represent photographically the machine of ci=
vilization which builds=20

up around us, and which now is the raw material on which our art is to oper=
ate, they do not even=20

attempt to portray the spirit of the artist which actually pervades the lan=
d, the joy in putting the=20

machine to human uses, the almost divine ecstasy in having made so much of =
nature subject=20

already to the mind. This mood of confidence in art is as much a fact in ou=
r national life as the=20

number of gallons that flow over Niagara each hour, but the poets and novel=
ists seem to have=20

taken fright.  In both verse and prose, in style as well as subject, the cu=
lt of the natural has limited=20

our writers to a few individualistic attitudes, and has taken from them the=
 power to speak with=20

authority on all subjects for us all. We have no American poet, no American=
 novelist; each is the=20

poet or novelist of Vermont or Boston or Maine or Chicago=E2=80=94whatever =
scene is to him by birth or=20

habit his natural world. To find a universal utterance of universal experie=
nce is the aim and the=20

tendency of art, but the cult of nature compels us to return each in what s=
tate he came. The=20

counsel to use the language of ordinary speech limits us to the speech of s=
ome locality; and such=20

limitation is a fatal handicap for great poetry. The advice to use only the=
 natural word-order limits=20

us to the d'Arc against Shakespeare and Voltaire is neither to vilify them =
nor to obscure the human=20

side of her character and exalt her to something altogether faultless and d=
ivine, something=20

altogether "too bright and good for human nature's daily food."  With or wi=
thout the poetic praises=20

of biographers, Jeanne d'Arc deserves her place as, all things considered, =
one of the most=20

remarkable figures in the world's history. In spite of human defects, she i=
s "the one pure figure=20

which rises out of the greed, the lust, the selfishness and unbelief of the=
 time." How can we draw=20

our sketch to a conclusion better than in the words of a great Englishman, =
himself in some things=20

the arch-prophet of divine enthusiasm? In his comment upon Schiller's _Jung=
frau von Orleans_,=20

Carlyle says: "Feelings so deep and earnest as hers can never be an object =
of ridicule: whoever=20

pursues a purpose of any sort with such fervid devotedness is entitled to a=
waken emotions, at=20

least of a serious kind, in the hearts of others. Enthusiasm puts on a diff=
erent shape in every=20

different age: always in some degree sublime, often it is dangerous; its ve=
ry essence is a tendency=20

to error and exaggeration; yet it is the fundamental quality of strong soul=
s; the true nobility of=20

blood, in which all greatness of thought or action has its rise. Quicquid v=
ult valde vult is ever the=20

first and surest test of=20


_
the contrary, if we make any claim to mastery in literature, to enlarge our=
 vocabulary even beyond=20

the words our family and our neighbors made natural to us, and to cultivate=
 all the variety of word-

order our speech permits, that we may enrich and refine our style, and rend=
er our meaning more=20

precise. The temptation to get along with a small vocabulary and a meagre c=
hange of mental=20

capability. This peasant girl, who felt within her such fiery vehemence of =
resolution that she could=20

subdue the minds of kings and captains to her will and lead armies on to ba=
ttle, conquering, till her=20

country was cleared of its invaders, must evidently have possessed the elem=
ents of a majestic=20

character.... Jeanne d'Arc must have been a creature of shadowy yet far-gla=
ncing=20


_
this premeditated urging to a still greater poverty. Hitherto the best reme=
dy for a narrow equipment=20

in language has been to read constantly in the great writers; it was they w=
ho extended the powers=20

of speech and laid upon each tongue the shape and cadence which to the ill-=
informed might seem=20

the gift of 'thoughts that wandered through eternity.' Who can tell the tri=
als and the triumphs, the=20

splendors and the terrors, of which her simple spirit was the scene!... Her=
s were errors, but errors=20

which a generous soul alone could have committed, and which generous souls =
would have done=20

more than pardon. Her darkness=20


_
shrink to the measure of the conversation he is used to, how shall our nobl=
er moments find=20

expression? Not even in reading old authors, for by the contemporary doctri=
ne of naturalness the=20

old masters are artificial. =E2=80=9CWhither thou goest, I will go, and whe=
re thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy=20

people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Where thou diest, will I die=

ds are gilded by the=20

orient light into something more beautiful than azure itself."  Great and p=
ure and noble was thy=20

faith, Maid of Orleans! And of a truth it wrought miracles, for thy brave a=
nd steadfast heart divined=20

what was to be done and faltered not by the wayside. And yet, adoring thee =
