dracaena marginata I don't want you sliding off into the water."  As Bianca=
 made no answer, Carlo turned from her to look out over the river. Today th=
e water was dark and muddy with a strong current flowing.  "Bianca," Carlo =
asked, "have you ever read the story of the Rheingold in the Ring of the Ni=
belung? One has had a horror of Germany for so long that one has preferred =
to forget German music. Yet since we arrived in Germany I have been reading=
 the legends of the Rheingold and they seem to me to Atomic Power Authority=

 organization will have to disavow his action, because he'll be calling the=
 strike against his own contract."  "Well, I hope so." Leighton's tone indi=
cated that the hope was rather dim. "I wish you luck; you're going to need =
it."         *       *       *       *       *  Within the hour, Crandall a=

Crandall arrived at _
of some thin material, a bright sash and black slippers and stockings. Her =
red hair formed a=20

brilliant spot of color.  Carlo was in uniform.  Their dance was probably a=
n Irish folk dance,=20

although it was comparatively simple yet the effect was charming.  Sonya be=
lieved she had never=20

seen two more graceful persons than Thea and Carlo as they advanced toward =
each other and=20

receded, later forming an arch with their hands above their heads and circl=
ing slowly in and out.=20

Sonya had known nothing of Carlo as more than an ordinary dancer, but evide=
ntly he and Thea=20

must have been practicing together for the afternoon's entertainment. Natur=
ally, Carlo's musical=20

gifts would make him a more successful dancer than anyone without a sense o=
f rhythm and time.=20

In any case the effect was charming and the applause at the close enthusias=
tic.  As soon as the=20

dance was ended, Carlo came directly over to where Sonya and her husband we=
re seated. Bianca=20

and Dr. Raymond were standing close beside them.  "Carlo, you have not aske=
d Bianca to dance,=20

you won't forget, will you?" Sonya murmured evaluating the completed tests;=
 after dinner, she=20

intended going over the written portions of the uncompleted tests.  "How'd =
the finished tests come=20

out?" Melroy asked her.  "Better than I'd expected. Only two washouts," she=
 replied. "Harvey=20

Burris and Julius Koffler."  "Oh, _no_!" Keating wailed. "The I.F.A.W. stew=
ard, and the loudest-

mouthed I-know-my-rights boy on the job!"  "Well, wasn't that to be expecte=
d?" Melroy asked. "If=20

you'd seen the act those two put on--"  "They're both inherently stupid, in=
fantile, and deficient in=20

reasoning ability and judgment," Doris said. "Koffler is a typical adolesce=
nt problem-child show-off=20

type, and Burris is an almost perfect twelve-year-old schoolyard bully. The=
y both have inferiority=20

complexes long enough to step on. If the purpose of this test is what I'm l=
ed to believe it is, I can't,=20

in professional good conscience, recommend anything but that you get rid of=
 both of them."  "What=20

Bob's getting at is that they're the very ones who can claim, with the best=
 show of plausibility, that=20

the test is just a pretext to fire them for=20


_
overheard. "I am afraid you have hurt her, but please don't let her guess I=
 have spoken to you."=20

Carlo flushed slightly.  "I am sorry my dear lady," he returned, which had =
been one of his old time=20

titles for Sonya. "I am afraid I have neglected Bianca. Miss Thompson is su=
ch a wonderful dancer,=20

she is apt to make one forget any other partner."  But although Sonya smile=
d upon Carlo and=20

forgave him, declining the honor of dancing herself, Bianca was not to be a=
ppeased.  "I suppose=20

Sonya asked you to invite me to dance, since you waited until she arrived b=
efore you thought of=20

me. Thank you just the same but I'd rather not," Bianca said later in answe=
r to his invitation.=20

Afterwards, although Carlo pleaded for her favor and returned several times=
 with a fresh request,=20

nevertheless Bianca continued firm.  Then, a few moments before going back =
to the hospital with=20

Sonya and Dr. Clark, she waltzed for a short time with Dr. Raymond, in spit=
e of the fact that she=20

had been right in declaring that he was a conspicuously poor dancer.     CH=
APTER XIII  _A Walk=20

Along the River Bank_   SOME time later Bianca and Carlo Navara, not having=
 seen each other=20

alone since New Year's eve, left the hospital early in the afternoon for a =
walk together.  As a=20

matter of fact Carlo's conscience had not been altogether easy concerning h=
is neglect of Bianca=20

since their days together at Chateau-Thierry. And certainly before those da=
ys he had reason to be=20

grateful to Bianca and fond of her as well! Moreover, a little private talk=
 with Sonya on this they're=20

the only ones."  "Maybe we can scrub out a couple more on the written tests=
 alone. Then they'll=20

have company," Keating suggested.  "No, I can't do that." Doris was firm on=
 the point. "The written=20

part of the test was solely for ability to reason logically. Just among the=
 three of us, I know some=20

university professors who'd flunk on that. But if the rest of the tests sho=
w stability, sense of=20

responsibility, good judgment, and a tendency to think before acting, the s=
ubject can be classified=20

as a safe and reliable workman."  "Well, then, let's don't say anything til=
l we have the tests all=20

finished," Keating proposed.  "No!" Melroy cried. "Every minute those two a=
re on the job, there's a=20

chance they may do something disastrous. I'll fire them at oh-eight-hundred=
 tomorrow."  "All right,"=20

Keating shook his head. "I only work here. But don't say I didn't warn you.=
"         *       *       *       *=20

*  By 0930 the next morning, Keating's forebodings began to be realized. Th=
e first intimation came=20

with a phone call to Melroy from Crandall, who accused him of having used t=
he psychological tests=20

as a fraudulent pretext for discharging Koffler and Burris for union activi=
ties. When Melroy rejected=20

his demand that the two men be reinstated, Crandall demanded to see the rec=
ords of the tests.=20

"They're here at my office," Melroy told him. "You're welcome to look at th=
em, and hear recordings=20

of the oral portions of the tests. But I'd advise you to bring a profession=
al psychologist along,=20

because unless you're a trained=20


_
vanity, had quickened his resolution. Curious, Sonya had said, that the art=
ist so seldom considers=20

loyalty an essential trait of his own character when he demands so much loy=
alty from others! And=20

yet one knows that without loyalty no human character has any real value!  =
Yet Carlo was not=20

thinking of these ideas in detail when he and Bianca started out.  It was a=
 February day with the=20

faintest suggestion of spring in the damp, cold air.  Nevertheless, Bianca =
herself had chosen that=20

they walk along the river bank, following a path until they reached the pro=
menade which extended=20

along a portion of the Rhine at Coblenz like the famous board walk of Atlan=
tic City.  Holding tight=20

to Carlo's hand, they slipped down the hill from behind the hospital until =
reaching this path.  But=20

once on fairly level ground, Bianca deliberately removed her hand from her =
companion's and=20

began walking sedately beside him several feet away.  "Why not walk as we h=
ave many times with=20

my hand in your's to keep you from slipping, Bianca?" Carlo inquired with a=
 teasing inflection in his=20

voice and manner. "I thought you and I to you."  "Oh, sure!" Crandall retor=
ted. "They'd have to be=20

unintelligible to ordinary people, or you couldn't get away with this frame=
-up! Well, don't worry, I'll=20

be along to see them."  Within ten minutes, the phone rang again. This time=
 it was Leighton, the=20

Atomic Power Authority man.  "We're much disturbed about this dispute betwe=
en your company=20

and the I.F.A.W.," he began.  "Well, frankly, so am I," Melroy admitted. "I=
'm here to do a job, not=20

play Hatfields and McCoys with this union. I've had union trouble before, a=
nd it isn't fun. You're the=20

gentleman who called me last evening, aren't you? Then you understand my po=
sition in the=20

matter."  "Certainly, Mr. Melroy. I was talking to Colonel Bradshaw, the se=
curity officer, last=20

evening. He agrees that a stupid or careless workman is, under some circums=
tances, a more=20

serious threat to security than any saboteur. And we realize fully how dang=
erous those Doernberg-

Giardanos are, and how much more dangerous they'd be if these cybernetic co=
ntrols were=20

improperly assembled. But this man Crandall is talking about calling a stri=
ke."  "Well, let him. In=20
