_Floridon_, a tale by Segrais. The heroine of _Mithridate_ (1673), the nobl=

 belong to Charudatta?=20

_Charudatta._ Never!  _Gild-warden and Clerk._ To whom then?  [153.12. S.  =

 truth in this matter.=20

For you must remember,      Truth brings well-being in its train;       Thr=

The French Iphigenia is enamoured of Achilles, and death means for her not =
only departure from=20

the joy of youth and the light of the sun, but the loss of love. Here, as e=
lsewhere, Racine=20

complicates the moral situation with cross and counter loves: Eriphile is c=
reated to be the jealous=20

rival of Iphigenie, and to be her substitute in the sacrifice of death. The=
 ingenious transpositions,=20

which were necessary to adapt a Greek play to Versailles in the second half=
 of the seventeenth=20
