him, and sent him down with the other two to the borough of N---- that nigh=
t.  I parted company=20

with my friends at the Euston Station. They proceeded a little more than a =
hundred miles to the=20

populous town of H---- by railway, and there alighted. From this point the =
journey was performed in=20

toll-bar, always locked at night, and the keeper of which was not renowned =
for his vigilance or=20

wakefulness. The party found a trifle of real difficulty in gaining admissi=
on to the borough. It was=20

some time before the man at the toll-house, rubbing his eyes, opened his li=
ttle wicket, and came=20

forth to unlock the gate. As he did so, he was startled by the sight of a v=
ehicle with three persons=20

in it, and heavily laden.  The man's sagacity penetrated, as he thought, th=
e whole secret. He=20

winked, and nodded, and grinned significantly. He saw in one of the party a=
nother candidate for=20

the franchise of the free and independent electors; and in the other two hi=
s agents. His acute=20

vision dived through the keyhole of that box, and there beheld a weight of =
gold, which he defined,=20

in conversation next day, as "such a sight as he never saw in his life befo=
re even at an election."=20

My man kept up the delusion well, by throwing two half-crowns to the fellow=
; and each of his=20

companions tossed a handful of small coin at him, as he closed the gate aft=
er them.  Away rolled,=20

at a slow pace, the heavily-laden vehicle, the horses throbbing and panting=
, and the riders=20

chuckling to their hearts' content.  At length the town of N---- was reache=
d. As quietly and=20

mysteriously as possible the vehicle was driven by the strangers, its occup=
ants, up to the hotel of=20

our opponent; and, after ringing the bell, refusing to accept the servants'=
 answer, and insisting=20

upon awakening the host, my man tried to strike a bargain with the hotel-ke=
eper (putting him under=20

confidence) to let his      Gazing in reverie at the distant sails,      Th=
at skimmed the surface of the=20

glassy deep,      Unvexed by blasts of Eurus=E2=80=99 boisterous whims.    =
  The restless winds in leash=20

about their lord      Full often murmuring, plucked his floating robe,     =
 Or stirred his tangled tresses=20

with their breath,      Impatient at the lack of wilder liberty.=E2=80=9D  =
 So sang the bard of the fabled cave of=20

the winds. Thus the old Romans and Greeks have taught us to think and to sp=
eak of the spirits of=20

the air. Thus the very name of =E2=80=9Cspirit=E2=80=9D was originally iden=
tical with =E2=80=9Cbreath=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cwind.=E2=80=9D Those poetic=
=20

old Hellenes! They contrived to find something delightfully human in all th=
e phenomena of nature.=20

The woods were peopled with fauns and dryads. Around the bend of yonder rus=
hy stream, a wary=20

woodsman found a bathing nymph. Beyond that rock Act=C3=A6on saw the chaste=
 Diana sporting in the=20

crystal pool. Here is the spot where baffled Ph=C5=93bus found his Daphne c=
hanged into a laurel tree.=20

See you those stately poplars by the side of Italy=E2=80=99s stream? There =
Pha=C3=ABthon=E2=80=99s mourning sisters=20

changed their fleshly robes for those green spires. From their waving bough=
s the cry of the=20

kingfisher Alcyone reminds us that  [Illustration: CAVE OF THE WINDS.]  hal=
cyon days may yet be=20

in store for the most unfortunate. The response hurled back from yonder cli=
ff warns us to drop a=20

tear for the poor nymph Echo, whose unrequited love caused her to pine away=
 till only a voice was=20

left. To this day she answers every call, hoping to yet meet her love. That=
 flaunting yellow flower is=20

sprung from that=20

"independent candidate." Boniface was proof against temptation. He had let =
his house to Mr.=20

Sallow Twitch, the Whig candidate, and he was "not a-going to break his eng=
agement--not he." He=20

never had done such a thing in his life, and never would. They must go else=
where, he said; and=20

the interview was closed by the irate landlord sheering off to bed, telling=
 them he didn't want to=20

have no more to do with them.  Next the party went to the hotel where Mr. J=
ollefat was staying,=20

and in which he held his quarters. A similar interview with Mr. Bung, at th=
at establishment, ended=20

not unlike the conference with Mr. Boniface.  At last a solitary medieval-l=
ooking policeman was=20

observed torpidly creeping along the Market-place, and for a consideration =
he undertook, in the=20

first place, to find the best quarters now available, and in who was so han=
dsome he fell in love with=20

himself. Ten thousand egotistic beauties of later days have not met so happ=
y a fate.  Hark! was=20

that the sea-shell of Triton? Neptune approaches with his Naiad train. You =
may see the plunge of=20

his dolphin steeds. And see! what vision of incomparable loveliness is that=
? It is Aphrodite,=20

goddess of love--sprung from the foam of the sea--as fragile as the fleecy =
mass from whence she=20

came; as inconstant as the tossing wave on which she dances. How can love b=
e otherwise, since=20

she is its queen? In the sky above you see the beautiful Andromeda with the=
 radiant Perseus.=20

There Hercules yet wields his club and wears his lion-skin. And there--  It=
 is vanished. The=20

disenchantment is complete. Modern civilization has replaced the nymph with=
 the peasant, and the=20

faun with the brigand. The pipe=20
