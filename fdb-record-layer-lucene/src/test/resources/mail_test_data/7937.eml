 an opportunity to be _
the Monument. How happy and proud he had appeared. For half his life old Co=
lonel Knight had=20

exhorted his fellow townsmen and painted dark the shame of their town: "The=
 only county seat in=20

Ohio with no soldiers' monument, sir!" He had held countless meetings, he h=
ad gone begging to=20

his neighbours, and every dollar he himself could save had gone into that d=
ream of his. At last he=20

had triumphed; and after all the excitement of his final victory, the old s=
oldier had made his=20

speech, and died.  Around him and the monument and the old frame house on R=
iver Street, the=20

lazy, shallow river, the high school near the court house, Demley's Tavern =
across the square, the=20

line of shops on either side, the new "movie" theatre of pink tile, and the=
 old yellow church on the=20

corner--the pictures of her life trooped by, the pictures of her last few y=
ears--with the miracle, the=20

discovery that she herself, Ethel Knight, who had always been considered "p=
lain," was slowly now=20

developing into a beautiful woman. That brought memories which thrilled--va=
rious faces of men,=20

young and old, looks and glances, words overheard, and countless small atte=
ntions. But these=20

came in mere fragments, rising only to be whirled back again into the past,=
 as the train sped on=20

toward the city.  She was going to live in New York with her married sister=
, Amy Lanier. And from=20

looking out of the car window, Ethel would turn quickly, throw a swift glan=
ce at her sister and=20

smile. Amy seemed quite wonderful--Amy with her elegance, her worldly assur=
ance, her smiling=20

good-humour and knowledge of "life," her apparent content, her sense of wel=
l being, of duty of the=20

clerk of the county court, when a diploma is offered for record, to make in=
quiry of the Secretary of=20

the State where the said college exists as to its reputability and requirem=
ents for graduation, and if=20

the said clerk shall find that the said college does not conform to the req=
uirements of this article,=20

he shall not receive the diploma and the holder shall not be allowed to pra=
ctise in the State. The=20

aggrieved applicant may apply to the State board of medical examiners, whos=
e decision shall=20

govern the clerk in his action (_ib._, s. 4).  If after recording any diplo=
ma it shall come to the=20

knowledge of the clerk making the record, or any other judicial or executiv=
e officer of the State,=20

that the record was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, it shall be his=
 duty to institute before=20

the said court of record proceedings to have such record reversed, and the =
holder of the diploma=20

shall be judged guilty of a misdemeanor (_ib._, s. 5).  EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=
=94The act does not affect the=20

standing of any one practising at the time of its passage by virtue of a li=
cense under the then=20

existing law, nor any one then legally engaged in the practice of medicine =
and surgery, nor does it=20

prevent midwives from practising their calling or any one else from giving =
such simple domestic=20

remedies as they are in the habit of using (_ib._, s. 6).  EXAMINATIONS.=E2=
=80=94The constituted State=20

board of medical examiners is authorized to examine persons having no diplo=
ma from a medical=20

college, and if found qualified to practise medicine and surgery issue a ce=

holder to practise in this State (_ib._, s. 7).=20

spent money like water, Amy with dash and beauty and style.  "New York just=
 fairly shimmering in=20

everything she wears!" thought Ethel.  Amy's sable cloak was long. She had =
worn it at the funeral,=20

with a black skirt and a heavy veil. But the veil she had put into her bag =
as soon as they had left=20

the town, and the cloak thrown back revealed rich colours, the glitter and =
glint of a  SYSTEMS,=20

no more mourning. Amy didn't believe in that; she was good-humouredly argui=
ng her young sister=20

out of it. And Ethel, smiling back at her, saw how sensible it was. She fel=
t death and sadness=20

slipping away, and the life in the city opening.  Since Amy's marriage five=
 years ago, Ethel had=20

only seen her twice--once when Amy had come home, appearing resplendent wit=
h Joe her=20

husband in a large new touring car, and had sent a wave of excitement throu=
gh the quiet little=20

town; and again when she had asked Ethel to visit her for a week in New Yor=

glamourous week,  FEES.=E2=80=94To the county clerk, for recording, $1.50. =

UALIFICATION.=E2=80=94Every=20

person practising medicine or surgery in any of its departments must presen=
t his diploma to the=20

board of examiners with affidavits. If the board finds all facts required t=
o be stated in the affidavit to=20

be true, it issues a certificate conclusive in any part of the State (Act 1=
877-78, c. 576; amending=20

Act 1875-76, c. 518).  The secretary of the board receives applications. Th=

repeated. For nearly three years they had not met. In that time had come th=
e change in Ethel's=20

own appearance. And glancing now at Amy, she read in those clear, smiling e=
yes that Amy was=20

relieved and pleased and surprised at the striking beauty which had come to=
 her young sister.=20

There was even a tone of expectancy in Amy's talk of their life in New York=
.  "She thinks I'll get on=20

finely!" This exciting thought kept rising repeatedly in Ethel's mind. And =
with it came the sturdy=20

resolve, "I mustn't be too humble now, or too dependent on her. I must show=
 her I'm somebody all=20

by myself--that I won't be a burden on her hands. I've got to make a life o=
f my own--find work=20

perhaps--or marry!"  Then all such resolutions would merge in the images vi=
vid and new, which=20

kept rising in her mind, of the life she would have in the city.  She had a=
 good voice. Old Mr. Riggs,=20

the organist in the yellow church at home, had planted that idea deep in he=
r mind. If only her voice=20

could be brought out! She hadn't much money for teachers, but how she would=
 work if she got a=20

chance! In her heart she knew she had no good standing (Act 1875-76, c. 518=
, s. 3).  The medical=20

society of the State, the eclectic medical society of the State, and the St=
ate hom=C5=93opathic medical=20

society each appoint annually a board of seven examiners who must be regula=
r graduates (Act=20

1877-78, c. 576; amending Act 1875-76, c. 518).  The board examines diploma=
s as to=20

genuineness. The affidavit accompanying the diploma must state that the app=
licant is its lawful=20

possessor, and the person therein named; that the diploma was procured in t=
he regular course of=20

medical instruction and without fraud or misrepresentation of any kind, and=
 that the medical=20

institution granting it had, at the time of granting the same, a full corps=
 of medical instructors, and=20

was at said time a legally incorporated institution, actually and in good f=
aith engaged in the=20

business of medical education, and in good standing as a medical institutio=
n, and that the=20

applicant had complied with all the requirements of said institution. The a=
ffidavit may be taken=20

before any person authorized to administer oaths, and must be attested unde=
r the hand and=20

official seal of=20


_
voice, but gaily she let her fancy go and pictured herself on the stage. . =
. . This image passed and=20

was replaced by a platform in an immense auditorium crowded with cheering w=
omen and girls.=20

Suffrage banners were all about, and she was speaking to the crowd. Her voi=
ce rang clear and=20

resolute. . . . There were other dreams and pictures--of dances in New York=
 cafes, of theatre=20

parties, trips to Paris, hosts of friends. And the vague thought flashed in=
to her mind:  "What=20

possibilities for life--in me--me--Ethel Knight!"  She went on listening, b=
uilding. She took in=20

fragments of what Amy said and mingled them with things she had read and pi=
ctures she'd seen in=20

books, magazines and Sunday papers; or with things that she had heard in th=
e long discussions in=20

her club of testimony as they deem proper to hear as to the verification of=
 the diploma or the=20

identity of the person, or the manner in which the diploma was procured, an=
d if it appears that any=20

fact stated in the affidavit is untrue, the application is rejected. No boa=
rd entertains an application=20

rejected by another; a rejected application cannot be renewed for at least =
one year (_ib._, s. 4, as=20

amended by Act 1877-78, c. 918); no certificates are granted except to pers=
ons presenting=20

diplomas or licenses from legally chartered medical institutions in good st=
anding (_ib._, s. 5).=20

Certificates must be recorded in the county of residence and the record ind=
orsed thereon. A=20

person removing to another county to practise must procure an indorsement t=
o that effect on his=20

certificate=20
