Miss Slowcum, and Mrs. Mortlock, and we said, 'At any rate give us their address, Mrs. Flint--we 

take an interest in them--they are pretty-spoken young ladies, and they were a credit to the 

establishment.' But Mrs. Flint only frowned and bit her lips, and colored. Then Mrs. Mortlock put 

her foot in it as far as Miss Slowcum was concerned, for she said 'I'm sorry the girls from the 

country have departed, and that they found us so disagreeable that they had to do it unbeknown 

and quiet, for it was a real pleasure for ancient females like ourselves to have young and bonny 

creatures about us.'  "Miss Slowcum got very stiff at this, for she apes youth, my dear, in a way 

that's past belief, and Mrs. Mortlock had her little fling on purpose. Well, dear, and how are you? 

You look thin to what you were, and a bit pale. How is that pretty little sister of yours who wanted 

the cheap lodgings, that was to be so clean you might eat on the floor?"  "We are all fairly well, 

Mrs. Dredge," replied Primrose, when she could edge in a word--for Mrs. Dredge was extremely 

voluble--"we are fairly well, only Daisy has been suffering from cold. We have got clean rooms too, 

thank you, Mrs. Dredge."  "Well now, dear, I'm glad to hear it; that pretty child amused me when 

she spoke of cheapness and cleanliness going hand in hand. Bless her little heart! little she knew. 

"We have learned a great many things we knew nothing about six months ago Mrs. Dredge," 

answered Primrose, a tinge of sadness in her voice. "Yes, I am very glad  "But, when there are 

those who threaten to wreck your whole life and your work, what are you going to do?"  "That is 

the time when one needs to summon every ounce of self-control he possesses. It is when the 

other man is seeking to land a knock-out blow that one needs to keep his head the coolest, for 

unless he does he can't make his best calculations."  "Oh, Mr. McGowan! You'll keep that way in 

this trouble, and not let any of them get in that kind of blow?"  "Yes, if you will only help me."  "I 

help you? But I can't!"  "No one else can."  "Oh!" cried the girl, beginning to take in the meaning of 

his words.  "Elizabeth----"  "Don't say it, please!" Her fingers went to her lips in a hurt gesture. "You 

may spoil everything."  "I must speak. I love you! I have loved you from the first day beneath that 

old elm-tree on the Captain's place."  "Oh!"--she sprang to her feet and faced him,--"now, you 

have made it impossible for me to help you, where before I might have done something!"  "Only if 

you say so."  "I did so want to help you! You seem so alone in this trouble! I thought you were 

going to give me an opportunity. I thought you would tell me how!" Her mobile lips puckered as the 

shadow of pain flitted across the light of her eyes.  "Elizabeth!" he called, holding out his hand. 

"Why did you say that to me?" she cried, her youthful face deeply furrowed as though she had 

grown suddenly very tired.  "Because I could not help it. I've known so little of love in my life that 

since this has come to me it

ladies at Penelope Mansion."  "Oh, my dear, they'll be glad to hear I met you--even Miss Slowcum 

will, though she's a little bitter on the subject of age; and as to that poor Sarah Maria, or Sarah 

Martha--I forget which she is, only I know she's Sarah, with something tacked to the end of it--why, 

she'll be fairly skipping with delight. That poor girl, she just worships the ground you three young 

I've never been accustomed to human care like other men. Had I been, I should have been able to 

hide my feelings behind the screen of pretense. You asked me a while ago why I do not love and 

hate like other men. I do love, and I hate! I have been schooled all my life to hide my hates, but 

experience neglected me with the other. Elizabeth----"  She drew farther from him.  "I don't think I
