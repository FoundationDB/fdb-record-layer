it seemed that love and war had always gone hand in hand, and at least the girls she had cared 

for had kept themselves free from unfortunate entanglements. The soldiers they had chosen for 

their friends were fine and generous. But with the little Luxemburg countess, Sonya felt it might be 

difficult to guess what her future might hold. She was wilful, beautiful and unhappy, with perhaps 

but few congenial friends among her former associates.  At this instant the Countess Charlotta 

shook her head, smiling.  "No, I don't think it would do any good for you to talk to my father, Mrs. 

Clark. As a matter of fact, it would make things more difficult for me to have him discover I have 

discussed my private affairs with a comparative stranger. I shall probably say goodby to you 

tomorrow and go back home, but I want you to realize, Mrs. Clark, how much I have appreciated 

everybody's kindness to me here and how much I like and admire American girls. Indeed, I would 

not have added to your work if I had not been so anxious for their acquaintance. You will soon be 

going away from Luxemburg to join the American Army of Occupation on the Rhine. May I wish 

you all good fortune?"  The little countess held out her hand and Sonya took it in her own for a 

moment and then leaned over and kissed her.  "May I write you after we go away and tell you 

where we are to be stationed? Surely there could be no objection to this. And, my dear, some day 

I may be able to prove myself your friend, even if I am forced to seem unfriendly now. Goodnight." 

And Sonya went away, curiously depressed.  In a few days the temporary Red Cross hospital in 

Luxemburg would close and she would probably never see the little Countess Charlotta again. The 

soldiers who had been ill were now sufficiently recovered either to rejoin their regiments, by this 

time approaching the German frontier, or else to return to convalescent hospitals in France.  The 

reigning family of the little duchy of Luxemburg had been courteous but none too friendly, and 

personally Sonya was anxious to rejoin her husband and the remainder of their Red Cross unit 

and to find themselves established with the American Army of Occupation.  Gossip in Luxemburg 

at the present time insisted that the Grand Duchess Marie Adelaide would probably be deposed 

and her exact. I'm afraid of fools, and the chance that I have one working for me, here, affects me 

like having a cobra crawling around my bedroom in the dark. I want you to locate any who might 

be in a gang of new men I've had to hire, so that I can get rid of them."         *       *       *       *       * 

"And just how do you define the term 'fool', Mr. Melroy?" she asked. "Remember, it has no 

standard meaning. Republicans apply it to Democrats, and vice versa."  "Well, I apply it to people 

who do things without considering possible consequences. People who pepper distinguished 

Austrian psychologists in the pants-seat with turkey-shot, for a starter. Or people who push 

buttons to see what'll happen, or turn valves and twiddle with dial-knobs because they have 

nothing else to do with their hands. Or shoot insulators off power lines to see if they can hit them. 

People who don't know it's loaded. People who think warning signs are purely ornamental. People 

who play practical jokes. People who--"  "I know what you mean. Just day-before-yesterday, I saw 

a woman toss a cocktail into an electric heater. She didn't want to drink it, and she thought it would 

just go up in steam. The result was slightly spectacular."  "Next time, she won't do that. She'll 

probably throw her drink into a lead-ladle, if there's one around. Well, on a statistical basis, I'd 

judge that I have three or four such dud rounds among this new gang I've hired. I want you to put 

the finger on them, so I can bounce them before they blow the whole plant up, which could happen 

quite easily."  "That," Doris Rives said, "is not going to be as easy as it sounds. Ordinary 

intelligence-testing won't be enough. The woman I was speaking of has an I.Q. well inside the 



meaning of normal intelligence. She just doesn't use it."  "Sure." Melroy got a thick folder out of his 

desk and handed it across. "Heydenreich thought of that, too. He got this up for me, about five 

years ago. The intelligence test is based on the new French Surete test for mentally deficient 

criminals. Then there's a memory test, and tests for judgment and discrimination, semantic 

reactions, temperamental and emotional makeup, and general mental attitude."  She took the 

folder and leafed through it. "Yes, I see. I always liked this Surete test. And this 


_
in her place. Sonya was hoping to be away from the duchy before this occurred, and as this did 

not actually take place until early in January and it was now December, the American Red Cross 

unit had not to meet this political change.  Left to herself the little Countess Charlotta did not go 

immediately to bed, although Bianca Zoli had helped her to undress some time before and she 

now wore only her rose-colored velvet dressing gown over her night gown.  Until it was midnight 

and the big house had grown quiet she sat alone. Her future was at present no clearer before her 

than upon the day when in a spirit of utter recklessness and foolhardiness she had deliberately 

flung herself from her horse. Yet at least she would never be so stupid again or perhaps so 

wicked!  Finally getting up she lighted a candle and wandered first about the old room and then out 

into the wide hall.  She had an idea of going to Bianca Zoli's room and of asking Bianca if it were 

possible that she could make her a gift, an unusual gift perhaps. The little countess desired one of 

Bianca's cast-off Red Cross uniforms.  But then Bianca did not sleep alone and would certainly be 

startled by such an extraordinary request.  Moreover, Charlotta would have no reasonable 

explanation to offer for her request not being entirely clear in her own mind as to why she desired 

this possession.  Later she tiptoed back into her own room and climbed into bed.  Next day 

probably she would make her singular demand. If she had no such opportunity at some time, 

when the American Red Cross had departed from Luxemburg, she would come back to her own 

house, since there she might find what she wished.  If it became necessary and she did finally 

decide to leave home she would require some disguise which her friends might unwittingly leave 

behind them.     CHAPTER XI  _The Journey to Coblenz_   "I WANT a doughboy and not an 

officer to be first across that bridge."  This command from an American officer was issued one 

morning in December, just as the sun broke through the grey mist. A little later, the American Army 

of Occupation, which had been led to victory by General Pershing, crossed the Moselle river. 

Beyond lay Germany.  There was no loud cheering, no blare of bands, or signs of the conquering 

hero, when the American soldiers set foot on the land they had crossed the ocean to conquer, only 

before their eyes floating in the morning breeze were the stars and stripes.  The advanced guard 

continued the ascent over winding roads and past villages onward toward the Rhine. First 

marched the infantry, then followed the artillery, engineers, signal battalions and last the hospital 

units. And accompanying one of the final units was Sonya Clark and her Red Cross group.  Never 

were any of them to forget their journey into the city of Coblenz, which, situated midway between 

Mayence and Cologne, just where the Moselle flows into the Rhine, was to form the chief city for 

the American Army of Occupation.  As a matter of fact Sonya and her Red Cross unit had not 

dreamed of being able to form a part of the army on their first approach to the Rhine, believing that 

the time spent by them in Luxemburg would delay them too seriously. But, because the German 

army was slower in accomplishing its retreat than had been anticipated, the Third American Army 

did not draw near the city of Coblenz until the close of the second week of December.  It was 

Sunday when they started their victorious march from the French country, it was Sunday when 

they entered the valley of the Rhine.  Every acre of the valley appeared to be under cultivation; 

there were fields of winter wheat and walled vineyards lining the roads. Beyond, the hills were 

covered with dense forests, farther on were the tall summits of the ancient castles of the Rhine. 

Varying impressions the journey into Germany made upon this particular group of American girls. 

"I declare it is unendurable to me to see how prosperous and peaceful the German county 



appears in comparison with the French!" Nona Davis exclaimed, staring out of the window of their 

Red Cross automobile, as their car drove through one of the small towns not far from the larger 

city.  Not many grown persons were in sight, but children were swarming everywhere and blonde 

heads were sticking out of the windows of nearly all the little houses along the road.  "I don't think 

the children look nearly as hungry as we had been led to expect," she added with a bitterness of 

tone unlike Nona's usual attitude of mind. But then she had been nursing in Europe for four years, 

since the very outbreak of the war and had been an eyewitness to untold suffering and privation. 

"I don't think I would be resentful about the German children, Miss Davis," Nora Jamison argued 

unexpectedly, as she rarely took part in any general conversation among the Red Cross girls. 

Nona glanced in her direction. Sitting next Nora was the little French girl, Louisa, who had been in 

her care ever since their withdrawal from France. There had been no one along the way to whom 

they could entrust the child.  In the little French girl's expression at the moment there was 

something which seemed to Nona to justify her point of view. Her face was white and her lips 

trembling as she too gazed out at the little German village.  At the instant she had beheld a former 

German soldier walking along one of the streets. On his head was a round civilian cap and he had 

on a pair of civilian trousers, the rest of his costume was an old German uniform. And it was the 

sight of the uniform which had brought the terror to the child's face.  Sonya saw the look and 

understood it at the same moment. In order that there might be no further argument she said 

gently:  "Girls, I don't often preach, but perhaps I shall make the effort now. We are going into an 

extraordinary new experience for which I sometimes wonder if we are either mentally or spiritually 

prepared. During the past four years we have felt an intense bitterness against everything 

German; they represented for us all the forces of evil against which we were fighting. Now we are 

going to live among them and I suppose must not feel the same degree of hatred. Yet it will be 

difficult to change, impossible at first. I think it may be a number of years before we can learn to 

accept them as our friends. And yet I do not wish any of us to stir up fresh antagonism. One has 

always heard that the soldiers who have done the actual fighting have never the same hatred 

toward each other as the noncombatants, and perhaps we Red Cross workers stand somewhere 

in between the two. And yet Germany has only herself to thank that she has earned the distrust of 

the civilized world!"  As no one replied, after remaining silent a moment, Sonya went on: "You 

know our soldiers have been given the order that they are to be as polite as possible and not to 

make trouble, but also they are not to fraternize with the Germans, even if living in their homes. I 

think the same order holds good with us."  At this instant Bianca Zoli who had appeared to be 

almost asleep opened her eyes and yawned.  "But I thought fraternizing meant becoming like 

brothers," she remarked irritably. "I don't see how there is any danger of our becoming too 

brotherly with the Germans, Sonya."  The laugh at Bianca's speech, although annoying to her, 

helped to clear the atmosphere.  In truth at the time the Red Cross girls were weary and anxious 

to reach the end of their journey, in order that they might establish their Red Cross headquarters. 

Bianca was in a particularly discouraged frame of mind. She was distinctly grieved at saying 

goodby to the little Luxemburg countess, whom she happened to have liked more than any girl she 

had ever known; she also cherished a grievance against Sonya Clark, because Sonya had 

refused to consent to bring Charlotta away with them secretly.  Moreover, Bianca was anxious to 

have some word of Carlo Navara. Not a line, no news of any kind had she been able to receive 



since Carlo's regiment began its march toward the Rhine. And Bianca had never a very 

comfortable sense of Carlo's enduring friendship. It was only when she had been able to help 

Carlo in the past that he had seemed especially fond of her. She did not blame him particularly; he 

was a good deal older than she was, and his gift of a wonderful voice made other people spoil 

him, beside adding to his own vanity. He had once thought he would always care more for Sonya 

Clark than any one in the world, but Bianca had seen in the last weeks they were together in the 

hospital near Chateau-Thierry that Carlo was becoming far more reasonable upon this subject. 

Sonya's marriage had of course made all the difference, although in his absurd fashion Carlo had 

protested that it could never alter his affection.  With a little sigh, Bianca now made an effort to go 

to sleep again.  She was not in the least interested in continuing to stare out the car window as the 

other girls were. She had been doing nothing else for days.  Whether she slept or not, Bianca did 

not realize. But suddenly she heard Sonya murmur.  "Don't go to sleep again, Bianca dear. We are 

just about to enter Coblenz and I want you to remember it all your life. See it is a splendid, 

prosperous city along the bank of the Rhine."  But Bianca would not rouse herself until their 

automobile had entered the centre of the city and gone by the Coblenzhof, one of the finest hotels 

in the city, and then past the mammoth statue of Wilhelm I the grandfather of the deposed Kaiser. 

Then Bianca decided to display a mild interest in her surroundings.  Coblenz is known as one of 

the most beautiful cities in the world and the German defeat had dimmed none of its outward 

glory.  Finally the Red Cross three squawking geese, four corpulent porpoises, five Limerick 

oysters, six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers....' I'd like to see some of these memory-course boys 

trying to make visual images of six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers. And I'm going to make a copy 

of this word-association list. It's really a semantic reaction test; Korzybski would have loved it. And, 

of course, our old friend, the Rorschach Ink-Blots. I've always harbored the impious suspicion that 

you can prove almost anything you want to with that. But these question-suggestions for personal 

interview are really crafty. Did Heydenreich get them up himself?"  "Yes. And we have stacks and 

stacks of printed forms for the written portion of the test, and big cards to summarize each subject 

on. And we have a disk-recorder to use in the oral tests. There'll have to be a pretty complete 

record of each test, in case--"         *       *       *       *       *  The office door opened and a bulky 

man with a black mustache entered, beating the snow from his overcoat with a battered porkpie 

hat and commenting blasphemously on the weather. He advanced into the room until he saw the 

woman in the chair beside the desk, and then started to back out.  "Come on in, Sid," Melroy told 

him. "Dr. Rives, this is our general foreman, Sid Keating. Sid, Dr. Rives, the new dimwit detector. 

Sid's in direct charge of personnel," he continued, "so you two'll be working together quite a bit." 

"Glad to know you, doctor," Keating said. Then he turned to Melroy. "Scott, you're really going 

through with this, then?" he asked. "I'm afraid we'll have trouble, then."  "Look, Sid," Melroy said. 

"We've been all over that. Once we start work on the reactors, you and Ned Puryear and Joe Ricci 

and Steve Chalmers can't be everywhere at once. A cybernetic system will only do what it's been 

assembled to do, and if some quarter-wit assembles one of these things wrong--" He left the 

sentence dangling; both men knew what he meant.  Keating shook his head. "This union's going to 

bawl like a branded calf about it," he predicted. "And if any of the dear sirs and brothers get 

washed out--" That sentence didn't need to be completed, either.  "We have a right," Melroy said, 

"to discharge any worker who is, quote, of unsound mind, deficient mentality or emotional 



instability, unquote. It says so right in our union contract, in nice big print."  "Then they'll claim the 

tests are wrong."  "I can't see how they can do that," Doris Rives put in, faintly scandalized. 

"Neither can I, and they probably won't either," Keating told her. "But they'll go ahead and do it. 

Why, Scott, they're pulling the Number One Doernberg-Giardano, tonight. By oh-eight-hundred, it 

ought to be cool enough to work on. Where will we hold the tests? Here?"  "We'll have to, unless 

we can get Dr. Rives security-cleared." Melroy turned to her. "Were you ever security-cleared by 

any Government agency?"  "Oh, yes. I was with Armed Forces Medical, Psychiatric Division, in 

Indonesia in '62 and '63, and I did some work with mental fatigue cases at Tonto Basin Research 

Establishment in '64."  Melroy looked at her sharply. Keating whistled.  "If she could get into Tonto 

Basin, she can get in here," he declared.  "I should think so. I'll call Colonel Bradshaw, the security 

officer."  "That way, we can test them right on the job," Keating was saying. "Take them in relays. 

I'll talk to Ben about it, and we'll work up some kind of a schedule." He turned to Doris Rives. 

"You'll need a wrist-Geiger, and a dosimeter. We'll furnish them," he told her. "I hope they don't try 

to make you carry a pistol, too."  "A pistol?" For a moment, she must have thought he was using 

some technical-jargon term, and then it dawned on her that he wasn't. "You mean--?" She cocked 

her thumb and crooked her index finger.  "Yeah. A rod. Roscoe. The Equalizer. We all have to." 

He half-lifted one out of his side pocket. "We're all United States deputy marshals. They don't 

bother much with counterespionage, here, but they don't fool when it comes to countersabotage. 

Well, I'll get an order cut and posted. Be seeing you, doctor."         *       *       *       *       *  "You 

think the union will make trouble about these tests?" she asked, after the general foreman had 

gone out.  "They're sure to," Melroy replied. "Here's the situation. I have about fifty of my own men, 

from Pittsburgh, here, but they can't work on the reactors because they don't belong to the 

Industrial Federation of Atomic Workers, and I can't just pay their initiation fees and union dues 

and get union cards for them, because admission to this union is on an annual quota basis, and 

this is December, and the quota's full. So I have to use them outside the reactor area, on 

fabrication and assembly work. And I have to hire through the union, and that's handled on a 

membership seniority basis, so I have to take what's thrown at me. That's why I was careful to get 

that clause I was quoting to Sid written into my contract.  "Now, here's what's going to happen. 

Most of the men'll take the test without protest, but a few of them'll raise the roof about it. Nothing 

burns a moron worse than to have somebody question his fractional intelligence. The odds are 

that the ones that yell the loudest about taking the test will be the ones who get scrubbed out, and 

when the test shows that they're deficient, they won't believe it. A moron simply cannot conceive of 

his being anything less than perfectly intelligent, any more than a lunatic can conceive of his being 

less than perfectly sane. So they'll claim we're framing them, for an excuse to fire them. And the 

union will have to back them up, right or wrong, at least on the local level. That goes without 

saying. In any dispute, the employer is always wrong and the worker is always right, until proven 

otherwise. And that takes a lot of doing, believe me!"  "Well, if they're hired through the union, on a 

seniority basis, wouldn't they be likely to be experienced and competent workers?" she asked. 

"Experienced, yes. That is, none of them has ever been caught doing anything downright 

calamitous ... yet," Melroy replied. "The moron I'm afraid of can go on for years, doing routine work 

under supervision, and nothing'll happen. Then, some day, he does something on his own lame-

brained initiative, and when he does, it's only at the whim of whatever gods there be that the result 



isn't a wholesale catastrophe. And people like that are the most serious threat facing our 

civilization today, atomic war not excepted."  Dr. Doris Rives lifted a delicately penciled eyebrow 

over that. Melroy, pausing to relight his pipe, grinned at her.  "You think that's the old obsession 

talking?" he asked. "Could be. But look at this plant, here. It generates every kilowatt of current 

used between Trenton and Albany, the New York metropolitan area included. Except for a few 

little storage-battery or Diesel generator systems, that couldn't handle one tenth of one per cent of 

the barest minimum load, it's been the only source of electric current here since 1962, when the 

last coal-burning power plant was dismantled. Knock this plant out and you darken every house 

and office and factory and street in the area. You immobilize the elevators--think what that would 

mean in lower and midtown Manhattan alone. And the subways. And the new endless-belt 

conveyors that handle eighty per cent of the city's freight traffic. And the railroads--there aren't a 

dozen steam or Diesel locomotives left in the whole area. And the pump stations for water and gas 

and fuel oil. And seventy per cent of the space-heating is electric, now. Why, you can't imagine 

what it'd be like. It's too gigantic. But what you can imagine would be a nightmare.  "You know, it 

wasn't so long ago, when every home lighted and heated itself, and every little industry was a self-

contained unit, that a fool couldn't do great damage unless he inherited a throne or was placed in 

command of an army, and that didn't happen nearly as often as our leftist social historians would 

like us to think. But today, everything we depend upon is centralized, and vulnerable to blunder-

damage. Even our food--remember that poisoned soft-drink horror in Chicago, in 1963; three 

thousand hospitalized and six hundred dead because of one man's stupid mistake at a bottling 

plant." He shook himself slightly, as though to throw off some shadow that had fallen over him, 

and looked at his watch. "Sixteen hundred. How did you get here? Fly your own plane?"  "No; I 

came by T.W.A. from Pittsburgh. I have a room at the new Midtown City hotel, on Forty-seventh 

Street: I had my luggage sent on there from the airport and came out on the Long Island subway." 

"Fine. I have a room at Midtown City, myself, though I sleep here about half the time." He nodded 

toward a door on the left. "Suppose we go in and have dinner together. This cafeteria, here, is a 

horrible place. It's run by a dietitian instead of a chef, and everything's so white-enamel antiseptic 

that I swear I smell belladonna-icthyol ointment every time I go in the place. Wait here till I change 

clothes."         *       *       *       *       *  At the Long Island plant, no one was concerned about 

espionage--neither the processes nor the equipment used there were secret--but the 

countersabotage security was fantastically thorough. Every person or scrap of material entering 

the reactor area was searched; the life-history of every man and woman employed there was 

known back to the cradle. A broad highway encircled it outside the fence, patrolled night and day 

by twenty General Stuart cavalry-tanks. There were a thousand soldiers, and three hundred 

Atomic Power Authority police, and only God knew how many F.B.I, and Central

entered a large court yard. On a hill beyond the courtyard rose an old castle which was to be the 

new American Red Cross hospital.  The building itself was grim and forbidding with its square, 

serrated towers and heavy, dark stone walls.  Bianca gave an instinctive shiver.  "The castle looks 

more like a dungeon than a hospital," she whispered to Sonya, "I wish they had given us a more 

cheerful place for our headquarters. Perhaps our soldiers will not mind, but I should hate to be ill in 

such a dismal place. Yes, I know the outlook supervisor and inspector and salaried technician was 

an armed United States deputy marshal. And nobody, outside the Department of Defense, knew 

how much radar and counter-rocket and fighter protection the place had, but the air-defense zone 

extended from Boston to Philadelphia and as far inland as Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The Long 

Island Nuclear Power Plant, Melroy thought, had all the invulnerability of Achilles--and no more. 

The six new Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactors clustered in a circle inside a windowless 

concrete 


_
magnificent but just the same it depresses me."  Then Bianca's manner and expression changed. 

Standing in the yard before the castle were a group of their friends waiting to receive them.  Dr. 

Clark had arrived in Coblenz a number of hours before his wife and had already taken command 

of the new Red Cross hospital for American soldiers. He and his wife had not seen each other in 

nearly a month, as they had made the journey to the Rhine with different portions of the army. 

With Dr. Clark were other members of his Red Cross staff and several representatives of the 

German Red Cross, who were to turn over certain supplies.  Unexpectedly a private soldier 

formed one of the group, who must have received permission from his superior officer to share in 

the welcome to his their primary purpose of plutonium production, they furnished heat for the sea-

water distillation and chemical extraction system, processing the water that was run through the 

steam boilers at the main power reactors, condensed, redistilled, and finally pumped, pure, into 

the water mains of New York. Safe outside the shielding, in a corner of a high-ceilinged room, was 

the plyboard-screened on-the-job office of the Melroy Engineering Corporation's timekeepers and 

foremen. Beyond, along the far wall, were the washroom and locker room and lunch room of the 

workmen.  Sixty or seventy men, mostly in white coveralls and all wearing identification badges 

and carrying dosimeters in their breast pockets and midget Geigers strapped to their wrists, were 

crowded about the 


_
The young man was Carlo Navara.  Bianca extended her hand like a child for Carlo to assist her 

out of the car.  "I was never so glad to see you before," she announced. "I don't care what the 

other Red Cross girls may say, but I have found the journey to the Rhine since we left Luxemburg 

extremely tiresome."     CHAPTER XII  _New Year's Eve in Coblenz_   THERE was no great 

difficulty in establishing the American Red Cross hospital at Coblenz. Dr. Clark had a large and 

efficient staff who were accustomed to working with him and naturally the demands were not so 

severe as in time of war.  Indeed Dr. Clark had no idea of asking the same degree of energy and 

devotion which the last six months of fighting had required of every human being in any way 

engaged in the great struggle in Europe. A reasonable amount of work and of discipline was as 

necessary for the hospital staff as for the soldiers and officers of the American Army of Occupation 

engaged in their new duty of policing the Rhine. Yet whenever it was possible opportunity was 

given for freedom and pleasure.  There were but few of the expected difficulties between the 

Americans and the Germans which the people of both nations had feared. A certain friction of 

course and suspicion and gossip about secret plots, but no open quarreling or dissension.  The 

new Red Cross hospital occupied an old castle which had formerly been used as a German 

hospital, although the last German wounded had been removed before the arrival of the American 

army.  The castle itself stood on a hill with a drop of a hundred feet to the bank of the Rhine, a 

path led down the hill to the river's edge. Crowning the summit were two old Roman towers which 

commanded a wonderful view; through the windows one could see many miles up and down the 

historic stream and on either side other castles famous in ancient legends long before the 

foundation of the modern German empire.  Within view of the American Red Cross hospital was 

the famous German fortress of Ehrenbreitstein across the river from voices--some perplexed or 

angry, but mostly good-humored and bantering. As Melroy and Doris Rives approached, the 

talking died out and the men turned. In the sudden silence, one voice, harshly strident, continued: 

"... do they think this is, anyhow? We don't hafta take none of that."  Somebody must have nudged 

the speaker, trying without success to hush him. The bellicose voice continued, and Melroy 

spotted the speaker--short, thick-set, his arms jutting out at an angle from his body, his heavy 

features soured with anger.  "Like we was a lotta halfwits, 'r nuts, 'r some'n! Well, we don't hafta 

stand for this. They ain't got no right--"  Doris Rives clung tighter to Melroy's arm as he pushed a 

way for himself and her through the crowd and into the temporary office. Inside, they were met by 

a young man with a deputy marshal's badge on his flannel shirt and a .38 revolver on his hip. 

"Ben Puryear: Dr. Rives," Melroy introduced. "Who's the mouthy character outside?"  "One of the 

roustabouts; name's Burris," Puryear replied. "Wash-room lawyer."  Melroy nodded. "You always 

get one or two like that. How're the rest taking it?"  Puryear shrugged. "About how you'd expect. A 

lot of kidding about who's got any intelligence to test. Burris seems to be the only one who's trying
