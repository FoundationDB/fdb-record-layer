covered with scales like a tarpon's. But all she had was   beach-shoes tied with silk ribbons, and I 

preferred watching the   water. For when I watch the ocean I always feel like Mr. Hood and   wish I 

was at least three small boys, so that I could pull off my   three pairs of shoes and stockings and 

go paddling up to my six   bare knees and let the rollers slap against my three startled   little 

tummies and have thirty toes to step on the squids and   star-fish with. And when I went back to 

the board-walk and watched   all the gulls (I don't think I ever saw so many of 'em in one   place at 

once) I couldn't help thinking it was too bad the Pilgrim   Fathers didn't wait for three centuries and 

land at a bright and   lively place like this, since it would have made them so much   jollier and 

fizzier. They'd probably have turned the _Mayflower_   into a diving-float and we'd never have had 

any Blue Laws to break   and that curious thing known as The New England Conscience to keep 

us from being as happy as we feel we ought to be."     _Sunday the Twenty-Fourth_   Harvest is 

on us, and Casa Grande hums like a beehive. There are three extra "hands" to feed, and Whinnie 

is going about with a moody eye because Struthers is directing more attention than necessary 

toward one of the smooth-spoken cutthroats now nesting in our bunk-house. His name is Cuba 

Sebeck and in times of peace he professes to be a horse-wrangler. Struthers, intent on showing 

Whinnie that he is not the only man in her world, is placidly but patiently showering the lanky Cuba 

with a barrage of her fluffiest pastries. She has also given her hair an extra strong wash of sage-

tea, which is Struthers' pet and particular way of putting on war-paint. Whinnie, I notice, shuts 

himself up after supper with that copy of Burns' poems we gave him last Christmas, morosely 

exiling himself from all the laughing and gaming and pow-wowing which takes place in the long 

cool twilights, just outside the bunk-house. Cuba undertook to serenade the dour one by donning 

certain portions of Struthers' apparel and playing had was picked up afterwards by himself. His 

appetite for mental food, however, was always strong, and he devoured all the books, few and not 

very select, which could be found in the neighbourhood of "Pigeon Creek." Equally strong was his 

passion for stump oratory, the taste for which pervades the American people, even in the least 

intellectual districts, as the taste for church festivals pervades the people of Spain, or the taste for 

cricket the people of England. Abe's neighbour, John Romine, says, "he was awful lazy. He 

worked for me; was always reading and thinking; used to get mad at him. He worked for me in 

1829, pulling fodder. I say Abe was awful lazy, he would laugh and talk, and crack jokes all the 

time, didn't love work, but did dearly love his pay." He liked to lie under a shade tree, or up in the 

loft of the cabin and read, cipher, or scribble. At night he ciphered by the light of the fire on the 

wooden fire shovel. He practised stump oratory by repeating the sermons, and sometimes by 

preaching himself to his brothers and sister. His gifts in the rhetorical line were high; when it was 

announced in the harvest field that Abe had taken the stump, work was at an end. The lineaments 

of the future politician distinctly appear in the dislike of manual labour as well as in the rest. We 

shall presently have Lincoln's own opinion on that point.  Abe's first written composition appears to 

have been an essay against cruelty to animals, a theme the choice of which was at once indicative 

of his kindness of heart and practically judicious, since the young gentlemen in the neighbourhood 

were in the habit of catching terrapins and putting hot coals upon their backs. The essay appears 

not to have been preserved, and we cannot say whether its author succeeded in explaining that 

ethical mystery--the love of cruelty in boys.  In spite of his laziness, Abe was greatly in demand at 

hog-killing time, notwithstanding, or possibly in consequence of which, he contracted a peculiarly 



tender feeling towards swine, and in later life would get off his horse to help a 


_
banjo under his window. Whinnie quietly retaliated by emptying his bath-water on the musician's 

head--and the language was indescribable. I have been forced to speak to Dinky-Dunk, in fact, 

about the men's profanity before my children. It is something I will not endure. My husband, on the 

other hand, refuses to take the matter very seriously. But I have been keeping a close eye over my 

kiddies--and woe betide the horse-wrangler who uses unseemly language within their hearing. So 

far they seem to have gone through it unscathed, about the same as a child can go through the 

indecorous moments of _The Arabian Nights_, which stands profoundly wicked to only Arabs and 

old gentlemen.     _Wednesday the Twenty-Eighth_   Summer is slipping away. The days are 

shortening and there have been light frosts at night, but not enough to hurt pig from the jaws of an 

unnatural mother.  Society in the neighbourhood of Pigeon Creek was of the thorough backwoods 

type; as coarse as possible, but hospitable and kindly, free from cant and varnish, and a better 

school of life than of manners, though, after all, the best manners are learnt in the best school of 

life, and the school of life in which Abe studied was not the worst. He became a leading favourite, 

and his appearance, towering above the other hunting shirts, was always the signal for the fun to 

begin. His nature seems to have been, like many others, open alike to cheerful and to gloomy 

impressions. A main source of his popularity was the fund of stories to which he was always 

adding, and to which in after life, he constantly went for solace, under depression or responsibility, 

as another man would go to his cigar 


_
which he has been watching with a worried eye. There is a saber-blade edge to the evening air 

now and we have been having some glorious displays of Northern Lights. I can't help feeling that 

these Merry Dancers of the Pole, as some one has called them, make up for what the prairie may 

lack in diversity. Dusk by dusk they drown our world in color, they smother our skies in glory. They 

are terrifying, sometimes, to the tenderfoot, giving him the feeling that his world is on fire. Poor old 

Struthers, during an especially active display, invariably gets out her Bible. Used to them as I am, I 

find they can still touch me with awe. They make me lonesome. They seem like the search-lights 

of God, showing up my human littlenesses of soul. They are Armadas of floating glory reminding 

me there are seas I can never traverse. And the farther north one goes, of course, the more 

magnificent the displays.  Last night we watched the auroral bands gather and grow in a cold 

green sky, straight to the north of us, and then waver and deepen until they reached the very 

zenith, where they hung, swaying curtains of fire. No wonder the redskins call that wild pageantry 

of color the ghost-dance of their gods. Even as we watched them, opal and gold and rose and 

orange and green, we could see them come wheeling down on our little world like an army of 

angels with incandescent swords. It made one imagine that the very heavens were aflame, going 

up in quivering veils of white and red and green. And when it was over I listened to a long 

argument about the Aurora Borealis, or the Aurora Polaris, as Gershom insisted it should be 

called.  Dinky-Dunk contended that one could _hear_ these Northern Lights overhead, on a clear 

night. He described the sound as sometimes a faint crackling, like that of a comb drawn through 

your hair, and sometimes as a soft rustling noise, like the rustling of a silk petticoat heard through 

a closed door, coming closer and closer as the display wavered farther and farther toward the 

south.  Gershom was disposed to dispute this, so our old Klondiker, Whinstane Sandy, was called 

in to give evidence. He did so promptly and positively, saying he'd heard the Lights many a night 

in the Far North. Gershom is still unconvinced, but intends to look up his authorities on the matter. 

He attributes them to sun-spots and asserts it's a well-known fact they often put the telephone and 

telegraph wires out of commission. He has proposed that we sit up and study them individual but 

local, and natural to keen-witted people who had no other food for their wits. In those circles "the 

ladies drank whiskey-toddy, while the men drank it straight." Lincoln was by no means fond of 

drink, but in this, as in every thing else, he followed the great law of his life as a politician, by 

falling in with the humour of the people. One cold night be and his companions found an 

acquaintance lying dead-drunk in a puddle. All but Lincoln were disposed to let him lie where he 

was, and freeze to death. But Abe "bent his mighty frame, and taking the man in his long arms, 

carried him a great distance to Dennis Hanks' cabin. There he built a fire, warmed, rubbed and 

nursed him through the entire night, his companions having left him alone in his merciful task." His 

real kindness of heart is always coming out in the most striking way, and it was not impaired even 

by civil war.  Though sallow-faced, Lincoln had a very good constitution, but his frame hardly 

bespoke great strength: he was six feet four and large-boned, but narrow chested, and had almost 

a consumptive appearance. His strength, nevertheless, was great. We are told that harnessed 

with ropes and straps he could lift a box of stones weighing from a thousand to twelve hundred 

pounds. But that he could raise a cask of whiskey in his arms standing upright, and drink out of the 

bung-hole, his biographer does not believe. The story is no doubt a part of the legendary halo 

which has gathered round the head of the martyr. In wrestling, of which he was very fond, he had 



not his match near Pigeon Creek, and only once found him anywhere else. He was also 

formidable as a pugilist. But he was no bully; on the contrary, he was peaceable and chivalrous in 

a rough way. His chivalry once displayed itself in a rather singular fashion. He was in the habit, 

among other intellectual exercises, of writing satires on his neighbours in the form of chronicles, 

the remains of which, unlike any known writings of Moses, or even of Washington, are "too 

indecent for publication." In one of these he assailed the Grigsbys, who had failed to invite him to 

a brilliant wedding. The Grigsby blood took fire, and a fight was arranged. But when they came to 

the ring, Lincoln, deeming the Grigsby champion too much overmatched, magnanimously 

substituted for himself his less puissant stepbrother, John Johnston, who was getting well 

pounded when Abe, on pretence of foul play, interfered, seized Grigsby by the neck, 


_
bottom of his trunk....  My lord and master is going about with a less clouded eye, for he has 

succeeded in selling the Harris Ranch, and selling it for thirty-five hundred dollars more than he 

had expected. It is to go, eventually, to some tenderfoot out of the East, to some tenderfoot who 

can have very little definite knowledge of land-values in this jumping-off place on the edge of the 

world. But may that tenderfoot, whoever he is, be happy in his new home! Dinky-Dunk is now 

forever figuring up what he will get for his grain. He's preoccupied with his plans for branching out 

in the business world. His heart is ring. He then "swung a whiskey bottle over his head, and swore 

that he was the big buck of the lick,"--a proposition which it seems, the other bucks of the lick, 

there assembled in large numbers, did not feel themselves called upon to dispute.  That Abraham 

Lincoln should have said, when a bare-legged boy, that he intended to be President of the United 

States, is not remarkable. Every boy in the United States says it; soon, perhaps, every girl will be 

able to say it, and then human happiness will be complete. But Lincoln was really carrying on his 

political education. Dennis Hanks is asked how he and Lincoln 


_
sometimes feel that we're all merely accidents in his life. And that feeling leaves me with a heart 

so heavy that I have to keep busy, or I'd fall to luxuriating in that self-pity which is good for neither 

man nor beast.  Yet Dinky-Dunk is not all hardness. He surprises me, now and then, by disturbing 

little gestures of boyishness. He announced to me the other night that the only way to get any use 

out of a worn-out husband was to revamp him, with the accent on the vamp. I understood what he 

meant, and I think I actually changed color sight, scent and hearing. We heard all that was said, 

and talked over and over the questions heard; wore them slick, greasy and threadbare. Went to 

political and other speeches and gatherings, as you do now; we would hear all sides and opinions, 

talk them over, discuss them, agreeing or disagreeing. Abe, as I said before, was originally a 

Democrat after the order of Jackson; so was his father, so we all were.... He preached, made 

speeches, read for us, explained to us, &c.... Abe was a cheerful boy, a witty boy; was humorous 

always,
