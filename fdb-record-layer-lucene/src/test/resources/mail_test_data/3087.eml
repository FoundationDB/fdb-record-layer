"_I_ care, Dad," said Lorna. "I'm only fifteen and I can't understand everything, but if you'll let me 

the least little bit take Mother's place, may I try? I'm not much, but perhaps I'm better than nobody, 

and we two seem all alone in the world."  For the first time in five years the barrier between them 

was down, and Lorna was hugging her father as in the old happy childish days. To know all is to 

forgive all, and her resentment against his treatment of her turned into a deep pitying love. She 

would never be frightened of him again. A new impulse seemed to have come to her. If she could 

in any way comfort him for what he had suffered, it would be something to live for.  "He's my 

father, and I'll stick to him through thick and thin," she said to herself fiercely, as she went to bed 

that night. "I don't know who this enemy is, but if ever I meet him I'll hate him and all belonging to 

him. I say it, and I don't go back on my word. I'll be my own witness as nobody else is present. 

Lorna Carson, you've taken up a feud and you've got to carry it through. May all the bad luck in the 

world come down upon you if you break your oath."     CHAPTER VIII  At Pompeii   Lorna

peculiar to the new continent. How many plants of the straits of Magellan, of Chile, and the 

Cordilleras of Quito have formerly been confounded with the productions of the northern 

temperate zone, owing to their analogy in form and appearance.  The inhabitants of the valleys of 

Aragua often inquire why the southern shore of the lake, particularly the south-west part towards 

los Aguacotis, is generally more shaded, and exhibits fresher verdure than the northern side. We 

saw, in the month of February, many trees stripped of their foliage, near the Hacienda de Cura, at 

Mocundo, and at Guacara; while to the south-east of Valencia everything presaged the approach 

of the rains. I believe that in the early part of the year, when the sun has southern declination, the 

hills around Valencia, Guacara, and Cura are scorched by the heat of the solar rays, while the 

southern shore receives, along with the breeze when it enters the valley by the Abra de Porto

crisis. The short week-end and its revelation seemed to have added years to her life. She had 

never been a typical specimen of "sparkling girlhood," but her new knowledge made her more 

sedate than ever. It brought her both gain and loss: gain in the fact that she now shared her 

father's confidence, and could help him to bear his heavy burden, and loss in the sense of a yet 

wider division between herself and her schoolmates. She realized now, only too bitterly, why her 

father so persistently shunned all English people. It would surely have been better to have placed 

her at an Italian school than among girls of her own nationality. Lorna, naturally morbid and over-

sensitive, shrank yet deeper into her shell, and became more sphinx-like than ever. Her one bright 

spot at the Villa Camellia was her devotion to her buddy. Half a dozen other girls had at various 

periods tried to "take Lorna up," but all had promptly dropped her, declaring that they could not get 

any further, and that she was a solitary "hermit-crab." Irene, after one or two ventures, realized 

that Lorna was utterly reserved and uncommunicative, but was content to continue the friendship 

on a one-sided basis, giving confidences, but receiving none in return. She was a little laughed at 

in certain quarters on the subject of her chum.  "Hope you like crab sauce."  "We're tickled to bits 

at the pair of you."  "It won't last long."  "Shall we give you an oyster-opener for a birthday 

present?"  "You've got the champion chestnut-bur of the school--aren't you full of prickles?"  "Go 

on!" smiled Irene calmly. "I've been teased all my life by my brother, so I'm pretty well bomb-proof. 

Say just what you like. I'm sure I don't care."  It really did not trouble Irene that Lorna should cling 

to this habit of closeness. She had so many affairs of her own in which to be interested. She had 

spent a glorious half-term holiday with her family in their flat at Naples, and was delighted to 

describe every detail of her experiences. She chatted about her relations till Lorna knew Mr. and 

Mrs. Beverley and Vincent absolutely well by hearsay, though she had never met them in the 

flesh. The accounts of their doings gave her a peep of home life such as she had not hitherto 

realized.  "Lovely to be you," she ventured once.  "You must come and see us," replied Irene 

impulsively. "I'll get Mother to ask you some day. Don't look so scared. They wouldn't eat you. 

Don't you like paying visits? Oh well, of course, if you don't want to come I won't worry you. No, I'm 

not offended. Why should I be? Let everybody please herself is my motto. Oh, _don't_ apologize, 

for it really doesn't matter in the very least! I'd far rather people were frank and said what they 

thought."  "I'm going with you to Pompeii to-morrow at any rate," said Lorna. "I'm glad they've put 

us both down together for that excursion."  It was part of the educational scheme of Miss Rodgers 

and Miss Morley that the girls should be taken to certain places of interest in the neighborhood. 

They were carefully prepared in class beforehand, so that they should thoroughly understand what 

they were going to see. All the school studied Greek and Roman history, and since Christmas 

there had been special lectures by Miss Morley on the buried city of Pompeii, illustrated by lantern-

slides. But photography, however excellent, is a poor substitute for reality when the latter can be 

obtained. Had the Villa Camellia been situated in England or America no doubt the pupils would 

have considered those views a tremendous asset to their history class, but being in the near 

neighborhood of Naples they were able to "go one better," and have actual expeditions to Pompeii 

itself. A dozen of the girls, personally conducted by Miss Morley, were to start on Thursday, take 

their lunch, and make a day of it. Most of those chosen were comparative newcomers to the 

school, or for some reason had not done the excursion before, so it would be a fresh experience to 

nearly all of them. Six seniors and six members of the Transition made up the party, with little 



Desiree Legrand tagged on at the last as a mascot, because Stella and Carrie had pointed out that 

twelve pupils and one mistress would make thirteen at table if they had tea together, and though 

Miss Morley had scoffed at such ridiculous superstition, she took Desiree all the same to break the 

possible bad luck. They had the satisfaction of assembling in the hall for the start exactly as their 

companions were filing into classrooms.  "Got your nose-bag?" asked Delia, indicating her lunch 

satchel. "It wouldn't do to leave those behind. I always feel famished when I'm out sightseeing. 

Hope I shan't eat my lunch before the picnic. Renie, it's no use lugging that camera with you. You 

won't be allowed to take any photos inside the ruins, so I warn you."  "Miss Morley's taking hers," 

objected Irene, loath to relinquish the object in question.  "Miss Morley has a special government 

permit to sketch or photo in Pompeii. Nobody may take the slightest snap-shot or drawing without. 

I've been once before, so I know, Madam Doubtful. You'll see ever so many officials will ask to 

look at Miss Morley's ticket. Why? Because the place would get choked up with artists I suppose. 

And also they want to sell their own photos. You'll be pestered to buy post-cards outside the 

gates."  "I'd adore to get just one or two snaps," persisted Irene. "I won't take this big camera, but 

I'll slip my wee one inside my pocket, and see if I find a chance."  "Are you ready, girls?" came 

Miss Morley's voice from the porch, and the waiting thirteen formed into double line and marched. 

They were to go by the electric tram from Fossato to Castellamare, from which it was only a 

comparatively short drive to Pompeii. The jogging, jolting, little tramcar ran along the coast, linking 

up several towns and villages and conveying people intent on either business or pleasure. There 

were many visitors anxious to make the excursion to-day, but the contingent from the Villa 

Camellia had posted themselves by the statue of Garibaldi in the square, and scrambled for the 

car as soon as it arrived, boarding it with three hatless Italian girls, two women with orange 

baskets, a sailor carrying a little boy, and a stout old padre, who apologized prettily for pushing. 

"We did those folks from the Hotel Royal," chuckled Delia, sitting on Irene's knee for lack of further 

accommodation. "Did you ever see a tram fill up quicker? I'm afraid I'm heavy. I know I'm an awful 

lump. We'll take it in turns, and I'll nurse you after a while. I call this rather priceless. Everybody's 

good-tempered even if they do hustle. They don't seem to mind people treading on their toes. It's 

infectious. I catch myself smiling, and I'd jolly well frown as a rule if any one yanked a basket into 

my back."  "I think it's the climate," remarked Irene. "In a London tram most faces don't look too 

cheerful, but with this sky overhead people are simply chirping like crickets. It's like a perpetual 

summer holiday."  The car was rattling along the steep coast road through miles of glorious 

scenery. On the left was an ultramarine sea, with white-sailed boats, and to the right lay cliffs and 

olive groves. Some of the trees were covered with catkins, and others had already burst into green 

leaf; gorgeous yellow genistas clothed the hillsides, and the banks were dappled with blue borage 

and marigolds. There were so many things to look at from either window of the tram; goats were 

feeding along the crags, and a gray businesslike battle-ship was wending its way across the 

harbor in the direction of Naples. They passed through several small towns or villages, getting a 

vivid impression of the lives of the inhabitants, who, on sunny days, seemed to do much of their 

domestic work out of doors, and to peel potatoes, wash salads, cook on charcoal braziers, sew, 

mend shoes, make lace, and pursue many other vocations on the pavements in front of the 

houses, and so far from being disturbed by onlookers, would smile and even wave friendly hands 

at the strangers on the tramcar.  "That darling old soul in the green apron blew me a kiss," 



chuckled Delia. "She looks as happy as a queen, though she's probably living on about ten cents a 

day."  "Did you see them dressing the baby on the pavement?" squealed Stella. "They were 

winding it round and round in yards of bandages _exactly_ like old Italian pictures. I didn't know it 

was done nowadays."  "Oh! Look at the carts drawn by bullocks."  "And the lamb with its fleece all 

combed out and tied with blue ribbons."  "That's because it's Mid-Lent."  "Don't you see the baby 

donkey? There! Quick!"  In her efforts to watch everything at once Delia craned her neck through 

the window of the car and away went her school hat, sailing over a bridge and down into a deep 

ravine below, lost forever so far as she was concerned, as the tram certainly would not stop and 

wait while she searched for it.  "You've come down a peg in life, old sport, that's all," laughed 

Carrie. "In Italy wearing a hat is a sign of gentility. No work-girl ever has one on her head even on 

Sundays. I offered a cast-off of mine to the _bonne_ at a hotel once, and she eyed it longingly, but 

said she daren't wear it if she took it, her friends would think it such swank."  "What do they have 

on in church then?" asked Delia.  "Handkerchiefs, of course. Every Neapolitan has one handy to 

slip round her head at the church door. It must save millinery bills."  "And they all have the most 

beautiful hair. Hello! Here we are at the terminus. What a crowd of beggars. They look like 

brigands waiting to pounce on us. Help!"  Once out of the shelter of the tramcar the girls made the 

unpleasant discovery that in Italy begging is not forbidden, but quite a recognized profession with 

certain of the poorer classes. They were immediately surrounded by a ragged rabble, some of 

whom exhibited sores or other unsightly afflictions to compel compassion, and all of whom held 

out dirty hands and persistently clamored for money. The blind, the halt, and the maimed were 

there, evidently regarding tourists as their legitimate prey, and bent upon claiming all the charity 

they could get.  "Don't give them anything," commanded Miss Morley, anxiously keeping her little 

flock in tow, and shepherding them towards the piazza where the carriages could be hired. "Just 

say _Niente_, and shake your heads. Hold a safe hand on your purses and stick together. Don't 

get separated on any account."  With considerable difficulty they forced their way across the 

square, and thankfully took refuge in several waiting landaus, whose drivers, feeling sure of their 

patronage, promptly raised their terms high above the ordinary tariff. It was only after much 

bargaining on the part of Miss Morley that they consented to fix a reasonable sum for the 

excursion to Pompeii.  "Miss Morley talks Italian like a native, so they can't 'do' her," rejoiced Stella 

proudly. "Aren't they the absolute limit? No, I _don't_ want to buy a comb, or corals, or brooches, 

or post-cards, or anything. They seem to think we're made of money. Why can't they let us alone? 

There, thank goodness, we're off at last and can leave the whole persuasive crew of them behind 

us!"  The five-mile drive from Castellamare was part of the fun of the excursion, but Pompeii was, 

of course, the main object, and there was much excitement when they at last drew up at the great 

iron gate. Miss Morley bought tickets for the party, and they were assigned a guide, a smiling 

Italian of superlative politeness, bearing a badge with the number 24 upon it.  "I asked for one who 

could speak English, but they're all out with other visitors," explained Miss Morley. "Never mind. 

It's a good opportunity of testing your Italian, and I can interpret if you don't understand."  In spite 

of the lantern-slides which they had previously been shown, the girls had come with varying 

expectations of what they were to see. Some imagined they would walk into a Roman city exactly 

as it stood when buried by the ashes of the great eruption of A.D. 79; others thought there would 

be a few interesting things peeping up here and there amid mounds of cinders. None had 



imagined it would be so large.  As a matter of fact the remains are simply the bare ruins of a town 

destroyed by burning ashes, which have been extricated from the rubbish accumulated during 

more than seventeen centuries. The paved streets and the roofless and broken walls of the 

houses still remain, with here and there some building that by a fortunate chance escaped, either 

in whole or in part, the general catastrophe, and suffice to show the general style and beauty of 

the Graeco-Roman architecture of the first century. The guide marshaled his party along, pointing 

out to them the various objects of interest that had been excavated, the beautiful marble drinking-

fountain, the marble counters of the shops, identical with those still used in Southern Italy, the 

wine jars of red earthenware, the hand-mills for grinding corn, the brick ovens, or the vaults where 

wine had been stored. They went into the site of the ancient market, and the Forum and several 

temples, and walked up long flights of steps and admired rows of broken columns, and saw the 

public swimming-baths with their tasteful wall decorations and the niches where the bathers had 

placed their clothes, and they admired the law-courts, and marveled at the great theater that had 

been wont to hold five thousand spectators.  The general impression was one of utter desolation. 

The mighty ruins lay in the bright Italian sunshine, and, close above, Vesuvius frowned over the 

scene, as if still watching the result of his deadly handiwork. Who had lived in those blackened 

fire-swept houses, and walked in those grass-grown streets? It was difficult to imagine the busy 

thronging crowds that once must have peopled all these silent haunts, where the only signs of life 

were the little green lizards that darted over the crumbling walls.  Certain of the best houses were 

railed round and kept carefully locked, and inside these could be seen what was left of the 

domestic life of civilized Pompeii. The girls enjoyed looking at the rooms in the Casa Dei Vettii, 

with the exquisite paintings of cupids still left upon the scarlet walls, they laughed at the quaint 

mosaic of the chained dog with its warning _Cave Canem_ (Beware of the dog!), and they went 

into ecstasies over the lovely little statue of the Dancing Faun and some terracottas of Venus and 

Mercury. One link with the past was left in the fact that a few of the houses still preserved the 

names and even the portrait-busts of their former owners.  "My! Doesn't he look boss of the place 

still? I wonder if I ought to leave my visiting card for him," declared Delia, staring at the green 

marble representation of Cecilius Giscondis, a banker by profession.  The others laughed. They 

had all been feeling rather oppressed, and were glad to break the ice.  "I'm so tired, I should think 

we must have walked miles," groaned Lorna.  "And I'm on the point of famishing," protested Irene, 

slapping her lunch-bag with a resounding smack.  Miss Morley turned round at the sound, and 

possibly caught the remark, for she spoke hastily to the guide, then suggested that the girls should 

sit in a row on a fallen column and consume their provisions.  "You all need a rest and something 

to eat now. Then we'll go on with our sightseeing, and have tea at the restaurant when we've 

finished," she decreed.  Never were ham sandwiches and oranges so acceptable. Viewing ruins 

may be extremely interesting, but it is a highly fatiguing occupation, and Delia at least had reached 

the stage of the over-burdened camel.  "I guess I don't like anything B.C. It's too depressing. Give 

me Paris!" she declared tragically.  "Cheer up, old sport!" consoled Irene. "I'm going to take a 

snap-shot of some of us when the guide isn't looking. You shall be in it. You'd like to send some 

prints to your friends in America, wouldn't you?"  "Rather! They'd burst with envy to see me 

photographed inside Pompeii. Where are you going to take us? I've finished my lunch. Let's get 

busy quick, before the guide comes round the corner."  Delia was prancing with eagerness. She 



flitted about like a butterfly, bent on choosing the best position for the desired snap-shot. Blanche, 

Mabel, and Elsie came hurrying up anxious to join the group, and fixed themselves in elegant 

poses.  "Oh, I can't put in such a crowd," objected Irene. "You block out the whole of the view. I 

only want Delia and Lorna, and yes, I'll have Desiree, but nobody else. Please clear out of the 

way."  "Well, really!"  "You mean thing!"  "We don't want to be in your old photo!"  Irene had felt 

cross and was possibly impolite, but she was not prepared for the Nemesis that descended upon 

her head. She had just congratulated herself that Blanche, Mabel, and Elsie had beaten a retreat 

and that she had been able to take her snap-shot so successfully, when who should make his 

unwelcome appearance but the guide, catching her in the very act of winding on her film. He 

sighed sorrowfully, and spread out his hands with a dramatic Italian gesture.  "Signorina! Non e 

permesso!" he objected.  [Illustration: "'SIGNORINA! IT IS NOT PERMITTED!'"  --Page 105]  "I'm 

awfully sorry. I won't do it again, really," murmured Irene, cramming the little camera back into her 

pocket.  But this apology did not content No. 24. He very courteously, but quite firmly, insisted 

upon temporarily confiscating the prohibited article. Miss Morley, who hurried up at the sound of 

the altercation, took the side of the authorities.  "Who brought a camera? _Irene!_ You knew it was 

not allowed. Yes, you must let the guide have it. He'll give it back to you at the gate. I hope there 

won't be any trouble about it. I believe you can be fined. It was very naughty of you to do such a 

thing."  Much crestfallen Irene retired into the rear of the party, and bewailed the fate of her snap-

shots.  "It was hard luck the guide should pop round the corner that exact minute," she groaned. 

"Mabel fetched him," squeaked Desiree. "I could see over the railing, and I watched her go. She 

was mad that you wouldn't put her in the photo."  "What a sneaking trick to play. She's the 

_meanest_ girl. I wouldn't have told about _her_. I hope No. 24 won't take the spool out of the 

camera, because there are three undeveloped snaps of the Villa Camellia on it, and I shall be wild 

if I lose them. He couldn't be so heartless. If I only knew Italian better I'd try and coax him."  The 

guide had obligingly waited while the girls ate lunch, but he now waxed impatient, and hurried his 

party on to the House of Pansa. This must have been quite a palatial residence, and showed such 

perfect examples of the arrangement of the various rooms in a Roman mansion that they lingered 

a long time looking at the _atrium_, the _tablinum_, the peristyle, and the kitchen with its curious 

mosaics of snakes. Now, though it was all very interesting, it was certainly tiring, and some of the 

girls grew weary of listening to the guide's descriptions in Italian or Miss Morley's explanations. 

"I'm bored stiff," has crossed the lake, and is loaded with aqueous vapour. On this southern shore, 

near Guaruto, are situated the finest plantations of tobacco in the whole province.  Among the 

rivers flowing into the lake of Valencia some owe their origin to thermal springs, and deserve 

particular attention. These springs gush out at three points of the granitic Cordillera of the coast; 

near Onoto, between Turmero and Maracay; near Mariara, north-east of the Hacienda de Cura; 

and near Las Trincheras, on the road from Nueva Valencia to Porto Cabello. I could examine with 

care only the physical and geological relations of the thermal waters of Mariara and Las 

Trincheras. In going up the small river Cura towards its source, the mountains of Mariara are seen 

advancing into the plain in the form of a vast amphitheatre, composed of perpendicular rocks, 

crowned by peaks with rugged summits. The central point of the amphitheatre bears the strange 

name of the Devil's Nook (Rincon del Diablo). The range stretching to the east is called El 

Chaparro; that to the west, Las Viruelas. These ruin-like rocks command the plain; they are 



composed of a coarse-grained granite, nearly porphyritic, the yellowish white feldspar crystals of 

which are more than an inch and a half long. Mica is rare in them, and is of a fine silvery lustre. 

Nothing can be more picturesque and solemn than the aspect of this group of mountains, half 

covered with vegetation. The Peak of Calavera, which unites the Rincon del Diablo to the 

Chaparro, is visible from afar. In it the granite is separated by perpendicular fissures into prismatic 

masses. It would seem as if the primitive rock were crowned with columns of basalt. In the rainy 

season, a considerable sheet of water rushes down like a cascade from these cliffs. The 

mountains connected on the east with the Rincon del Diablo, are much less lofty, and contain, like 

the promontory of La Cabrera, and the little detached hills in the plain, gneiss and mica-slate, 

including garnets.  In these lower mountains, two or three miles north-east of Mariara, we find the 

ravine of hot waters called Quebrada de Aguas Calientes. This ravine, running north-west 75 

degrees, contains several small basins. Of these the two uppermost, which have no 

communication with each other, are only eight inches in diameter; the three lower, from two to 

three feet. Their depth varies from three to fifteen inches. The temperature of these different 

funnels (pozos) is from 56 to 59 degrees; and what is remarkable, the lower funnels are hotter 

than the upper, though the difference of the level is only seven or eight inches. The hot waters, 

collected together, form a little rivulet, called the Rio de Aguas Calientes, which, thirty feet lower, 

has a temperature of only 48 degrees. In seasons of great drought, the time at which we visited 

the ravine, the whole body of the thermal waters forms a section of only twenty-six square inches. 

This is considerably augmented in the rainy season; the rivulet is then transformed into a torrent, 

and its heat diminishes for it appears that the hot springs themselves are subject only to 

imperceptible variations. All these springs are slightly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen 

gas. The fetid smell, peculiar to this gas, can be perceived only by approaching very near the 

springs. In one of these wells only, the temperature of which is 56.2 degrees, bubbles of air are 

evolved at nearly regular intervals of two or three minutes. I observed that these bubbles 

constantly rose from the same points, which are four in number; and that it was not possible to 

change the places from which the gas is emitted, by stirring the bottom of the basin with a stick. 

These places correspond no doubt to holes or fissures on the gneiss; and indeed when the 

bubbles rise from one of the apertures, the emission of gas follows instantly from the other three. I 

could not succeed in inflaming the small quantities of gas that rise above the thermal waters, or 

those I collected in a glass phial held over the springs, an operation that excited in me a nausea, 

caused less by the smell of the gas, than by the excessive heat prevailing in this ravine. Is this 

sulphuretted hydrogen mixed with a great proportion of carbonic acid or atmospheric air? I am 

doubtful of the first of these mixtures, though so common in thermal waters; for example at Aix la 

Chapelle, Enghien, and Bareges. The gas collected in the tube of Fontana's eudiometer had been 

shaken for a long time with water. The small basins are covered with a light film of sulphur, 

deposited by the sulphuretted hydrogen in its slow combustion in contact with the atmospheric 

oxygen. A few plants near the springs were encrusted with sulphur. This deposit is scarcely visible 

when the water of Mariara is suffered to cool in an open vessel; no doubt because the quantity of 

disengaged gas is very small, and is not renewed. The water, when cold, gives no precipitate with 

a solution of nitrate of copper; it is destitute of flavour, and very drinkable. If it contain any saline 

substances, for example, the sulphates of soda or magnesia, their quantities must be very 



insignificant. Being almost destitute of chemical tests,* (* A small case, containing acetate of lead, 

nitrate of silver, alcohol, prussiate of potash, etc., had been left by mistake at Cumana. I 

evaporated some of the water of Mariara, and it yielded only a very small residuum, which, 

digested with nitric acid, appeared to contain only a little silica and extractive vegetable matter.) 

we contented ourselves with filling at the spring two bottles, which were sent, along with the 

nourishing milk of the tree called palo de vaca, to MM. Fourcroy and Vauquelin, by the way of 

Porto Cabello and the Havannah. This purity in hot waters issuing immediately from granite 

mountains is in Europe, as well as in the New Continent, a most curious phenomenon.* (* Warm 

springs equally pure are found issuing from the granites of Portugal, and those of Cantal. In Italy, 

the Pisciarelli of the lake Agnano have a temperature equal to 93 degrees. Are these pure waters 

produced by condensed vapours?) How can we explain the origin of the sulphuretted hydrogen? It 

cannot proceed from the decomposition of sulphurets of iron, or pyritic strata. Is it owing to 

sulphurets of calcium, of magnesium, or other earthy metalloids, contained in the interior of our 

planet, under its rocky and oxidated crust?  In the ravine of the hot waters of Mariara, amidst little 

funnels, the temperature of which rises from 56 to 59 degrees, two species of aquatic plants 

vegetate; the one is membranaceous, and contains bubbles of air; the other has parallel fibres. 

The first much resembles the Ulva labyrinthiformis of Vandelli, which the thermal waters of Europe 

furnish. At the island of Amsterdam, tufts of lycopodium and marchantia have been seen in places 

where the heat of the soil was far greater: such is the effect of an habitual stimulus on the organs 

of plants. The waters of Mariara contain no aquatic insects. Frogs are found in them, which, being 

probably chased by serpents, have leaped into the funnels, and there perished.  South of the 

ravine, in the plain extending towards the shore of the lake, another sulphureous spring gushes 

out, less hot and less impregnated with gas. The crevice whence this water issues is six toises 

higher than the funnel just described. The thermometer did not rise in the crevice above 42 

degrees. The water is collected in a basin surrounded by large trees; it is nearly circular, from 

fifteen to eighteen feet diameter, and three feet deep. The slaves throw themselves into this bath 

at the end of the day, when covered with dust, after having worked in the neighbouring fields of 

indigo and sugar-cane. Though the water of this bath (bano) is habitually from 12 to 14 degrees 

hotter than the air, the negroes call it refreshing; because in the torrid zone this term is used for 

whatever restores strength, calms the irritation of the nerves, or causes a feeling of comfort. We 

ourselves experienced the salutary effects of the bath. Having slung our hammocks on the trees 

round the basin, we passed a whole day in this charming spot, which abounds in plants. We found 

near the bano of Mariara the volador, or gyrocarpus. The winged fruits of this large tree turn like a 

fly-wheel, when they fall from the stalk. On shaking the branches of the volador, we saw the air 

filled with its fruits, the simultaneous fall of which presents the most singular spectacle. The two 

membranaceous and striated wings are turned so as to meet the air, in falling, at an angle of 45 

degrees. Fortunately the fruits we gathered were at their maturity. We sent some to Europe, and 

they have germinated in the gardens of Berlin, Paris, and Malmaison. The numerous plants of the 

volador, now seen in hot-houses, owe their origin to the only tree of the kind found near Mariara. 

The geographical distribution of the different species of gyrocarpus, which Mr. Brown considers as 

one of the laurineae, is very singular. Jacquin saw one species near Carthagena in America.* (* 

The Gyrocarpus Jacquini of Gartner, or Gyrocarpus americanus of Willdenouw.) This is the same 



which we met with again in Mexico, near Zumpango, on the road from Acapulco to the capital.* (* 

The natives of Mexico called it quitlacoctli. I saw some of its young leaves with three and five 

lobes; the full-grown leaves are in the form of a heart, and always with three lobes. We never met 

with the volador in flower.) Another species, which grows on the mountains of Coromandel,* (* 

This is the Gyrocarpus asiaticus of Willdenouw.) has been described by Roxburgh; the third and 

fourth* grow in the southern hemisphere, on the coasts of Australia. (* Gyrocarpus sphenopterus, 

and G. rugosus.)  After getting out of the bath, while, half-wrapped in a sheet, we were drying 

ourselves in the sun, according to the custom of the country, a little man of the mulatto race 

approached us. After bowing gravely, he made us a long speech on the virtues of the waters of 

Mariara, adverting to the numbers of invalids by whom they have been visited for some years past, 

and to the favourable situation of the springs, between the two towns Valencia and Caracas. He 

showed us his house, a little hut covered with palm-leaves, situated in an enclosure at a small 

distance, on the bank of a rivulet, communicating with the bath. He assured us that we should 

there find all the conveniences of life; nails to suspend our hammocks, ox-leather to stretch over 

benches made of reeds, earthern vases always filled with cool water, and what, after the bath, 

would be most salutary of all, those great lizards (iguanas), the flesh of which is known to be a 

refreshing aliment. We judged from his harangue, that this good man took us for invalids, who had 

come to stay near the spring. His counsels and offers of hospitality were not altogether 

disinterested. He styled himself the inspector of the waters, and the pulpero* (* Proprietor of a 

pulperia, or little shop where refreshments are sold.) of the place. Accordingly all his obliging 

attentions to us ceased as soon as he heard that we had come merely to satisfy our curiosity; or 

as they express it in the Spanish colonies, those lands of idleness, para ver, no mas, to see, and 

nothing more. The waters of Mariara are used with success in rheumatic swellings, and affections 

of the skin. As the waters are but very feebly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, it is 

necessary to bathe at the spot where the springs issue. Farther on, these same waters are 

employed for the irrigation of fields of indigo. A wealthy landed proprietor of Mariara, Don Domingo 

Tovar, had formed the project of erecting a bathing-house, and an establishment which would 

furnish visitors with better resources than lizard's flesh for food, and leather stretched on a bench 

for their repose.  On the 21st of February, in the evening, we set out from the beautiful Hacienda 

de Cura for Guacara and Nueva Valencia. We preferred travelling by night, on account of the 

excessive heat of the day. We passed by the hamlet of Punta Zamuro, at the foot of the high 

mountains of Las Viruelas. The road is bordered with large zamang-trees, or mimosas, the trunks 

of which rise to sixty feet high. Their branches, nearly horizontal, meet at more than one hundred 

and fifty feet distance. I have nowhere seen a vault of verdure more beautiful and luxuriant. The 

night was gloomy: the Rincon del Diablo with its denticulated rocks appeared from time to time at 

a distance, illumined by the burning of the savannahs, or wrapped in ruddy smoke. At the spot 

where the bushes were thickest, our horses were frightened by the yell of an animal that seemed 

to follow us closely. It was a large jaguar, which had roamed for three years among these 

mountains. He had constantly escaped the pursuits of the boldest hunters, and had carried off 

horses and mules from the midst of enclosures; but, having no want of food, had not yet attacked 

men. The negro who conducted us uttered wild cries, expecting by these means to frighten the 

tiger; but his efforts were ineffectual. The jaguar, like the wolf of Europe, follows travellers even 



when he will not attack them; the wolf in the open fields and in unsheltered places, the jaguar 

skirting the road and appearing only at intervals between the bushes.  We passed the day on the 

23rd in the house of the Marquis de Toro, at the village of Guacara, a very considerable Indian 

community. An avenue of carolineas leads from Guacara to Mocundo. It was the first time I had 

seen in the open air this majestic plant, which forms one of the principal ornaments of the 

extensive conservatories of Schonbrunn.* (* Every tree of the Carolinea princeps at Schonbrunn 

has sprung from seeds collected from one single tree of enormous size, near Chacao, east of 

Caracas.) Mocundo is a rich plantation of sugar-canes, belonging to the family of Toro. We there 

find, what is so rare in that country, a garden, artificial clumps of trees, and on the border of the 

water, upon a rock of gneiss, a pavilion with a mirador, or belvidere. The view is delightful over the 

western part of the lake, the surrounding mountains, and a forest of palm-trees that separates 

Guacara from the city of Nueva Valencia. The fields of sugar-cane, from the soft verdure of the 

young reeds, resemble a vast meadow. Everything denotes abundance; but it is at the price of the 

liberty of the cultivators. At Mocundo, with two hundred and thirty negroes, seventy-seven 

tablones, or cane-fields, are cultivated, each of which, ten thousand varas square,* (* A tablon, 

equal to 1849 square toises, contains nearly an acre and one-fifth: a legal acre has 1344 square 

toises, and 1.95 legal acre is equal to one hectare.) yields a net profit of two hundred or two 

hundred and forty piastres a-year. The creole cane and the cane of Otaheite* are planted in the 

month of April, the first at four, the second at five feet distance. (* In the island of Palma, where in 

the latitude of 29 degrees the sugar-cane is said to be cultivated as high as 140 toises above the 

level of the Atlantic, the Otaheite cane requires more heat than the Creole cane.) The cane ripens 

in fourteen months. It flowers in the month of October, if the plant be sufficiently vigorous; but the 

top is cut off before the panicle unfolds. In all the monocotyledonous plants (for example, the 

maguey cultivated at Mexico for extracting pulque, the wine-yielding palm-tree, and the sugar-

cane), the flowering alters the quality of the juices. The preparation of sugar, the boiling, and the 

claying, are very imperfect in Terra Firma, because it is made only for home consumption; and for 

wholesale, papelon is preferred to sugar, either refined or raw. This papelon is an impure sugar, in 

the form of little loaves, of a yellow-brown colour. It contains a mixture of molasses and 

mucilaginous matter. The poorest man eats papelon, as in Europe he eats cheese. It is believed to 

have nutritive qualities. Fermented with water it yields the guarapo, the favourite beverage of the 

people. In the province of Caracas subcarbonate of potash is used, instead of lime, to purify the 

juice of the sugar-cane. The ashes of the bucare, which is the Erythrina corallodendrum, are 

preferred.  The sugar-cane was introduced very late, probably towards the end of the sixteenth 

century, from the West India Islands, into the valleys of Aragua. It was known in India, in China, 

and in all the islands of the Pacific, from the most remote antiquity; and it was planted at 

Khorassan, in Persia, as early as the fifth century of our era, in order to obtain from it solid sugar.* 

(* The Indian name for the sugar-cane is sharkara. Thence the word sugar.) The Arabs carried this 

reed, so useful to the inhabitants of hot and temperate countries, to the shores of the 

Mediterranean. In 1306, its cultivation was yet unknown in Sicily; but was already common in the 

island of Cyprus, at Rhodes, and in the Morea. A hundred years after it enriched Calabria, Sicily, 

and the coasts of Spain. From Sicily the Infante Don Henry transported the cane to Madeira: from 

Madeira it passed to the Canary Islands, where it was entirely unknown; for the ferulae of Juba, 



quae expressae liquorem fundunt potui ucundum, are euphorbias (the Tabayba dulce), and not, as 

has been recently asserted,* sugar-canes. (* On the origin of cane-sugar, in the Journal de 

Pharmacie 1816 page 387. The Tabayba dulce is, according to Von Buch, the Euphorbia 

balsamifera, the juice of which is neither corrosive nor bitter like that of the cardon, or Euphorbia 

canariensis.) Twelve sugar-manufactories (ingenios de azucar) were soon established in the 

island of Great Canary, in that of Palma, and between Adexe, Icod, and Guarachico, in the island 

of Teneriffe. Negroes were employed in this cultivation, and their descendants still inhabit the 

grottos of Tiraxana, in the Great Canary. Since the sugar-cane has been transplanted to the West 

Indies, and the New World has given maize to the Canaries, the cultivation of the latter has taken 

the place of the cane at Teneriffe and the Great Canary. The cane is now found only in the island 

of Palma, near Argual and Tazacorte,* where it yields scarcely one thousand quintals of sugar a 

year. (* "Notice sur la Culture du Sucre dans les Isles Canariennes" by Leopold von Buch.) The 

sugar-cane of the Canaries, which Aiguilon transported to St. Domingo, was there cultivated 

extensively as early as 1513, or during the six or seven following years, under the auspices of the 

monks of St. Jerome. Negroes were employed in this cultivation from its commencement; and in 

1519 representations were made to government, as in our own time, that the West India Islands 

would be ruined and made desert, if slaves were not conveyed thither annually from the coast of 

Guinea.  For some years past the culture and preparation of sugar has been much improved in 

Terra Firma; and, as the process of refining is prohibited by the laws at Jamaica, they reckon on 

the fraudulent exportation of refined sugar to the English colonies. But the consumption of the 

provinces of Venezuela, in papelon, and in raw sugar

arm. "If I have any more information crammed into my head it will burst. I know quite enough about 

ancient customs already. All I can say is I'm thankful I'm living now instead of then. Renie, if you 

love me, take me out of ear-shot of Miss Morley and let me chatter and frivol."  "Poor old sport!" 

laughed Irene. "Let's slip away and take another turn round the garden while the guide finishes 

haranguing. I'm out of friends with him since he stole my camera. He doesn't deserve anybody to 

listen to him. I've a few chocs left in this package. You shall have some to cheer you up. They're 

modern at any rate."  "You mascot!" murmured Delia. "Stella says I'm a Goth, but why _need_ I 

like old things? Did the Pompeians take their schoolgirls to look at buried Greek cities, or were 

they satisfied with their own times? How soon do you think we shall have tea? These chocs have 

saved my life, but I'm longing for bread and butter and buns."  "Why, we haven't finished lunch 

very long."  "I ate more than half of mine in the carriage, so I hadn't much left. Hello! Where have 

the others been? I didn't know there was a way up there."  The rest of the party were clattering 

down a flight of wooden steps with many expressions of admiration for what they had seen at the 

top.  "Perfectly beautiful! The finest view of all," purred Miss Morley. "Renie and Delia, didn't you 

go up? You silly girls. You've missed a treat. No, I'm afraid we can't wait now. The guide is 

anxious to take us on. We haven't seen the House of Sallust yet or the Street of Tombs. I want to 

ask him whether they've been doing any more excavations near the Herculaneum Gate."  Miss 

Morley, deep in conversation with No. 24, passed on, in the full belief that all her flock were 

following behind her. Irene and Delia, however, were determined to have just one peep at the view 

from the top of the wall, so both made a dash up the wooden staircase. From here there was a 

glorious prospect of the entire city with its arches and columns and broken temples, its cypress 

trees, and its somber background of smoking mountain. They could see exactly the way they had 

come from the entrance, and could tell which was the Street of Fortune and which the Street of 

Abundance. It was so fascinating that they lingered rather longer than they intended.  "They'll be 

waiting for us," ventured Irene at last.  "Oh, bother! So they will," exclaimed Delia, rushing down 

prepared for a scolding.  But the others had not waited. They had all simply walked on, and the 

custodian had locked the gate behind them. It was fast closed, and no amount of shaking would 

move it.  "We're shut in," gasped Irene. "Where's the porter? He ought to be somewhere about 

with the key."  The custodian, quite oblivious of the fact that anybody had been left inside the 

House of Pansa, was reading a newspaper and eating bread and garlic under his wooden shed 

farther down the street, where he would remain till the next guide came along with a party and 

requested admission. So he did not hear, though the girls thumped and called and made a very 

considerable noise. They were both horribly frightened.  "Shall we have to stay here all night?"  "I'd 

be scared to death."  "Think of the spooks!"  "Why the whole place must be simply _chock-full_ of 

ghosts after sunset."  "Couldn't we jump from the wall?"  "I wish I'd never come. Oh, I hate things 

B.C.! I shall have fits in a minute."  Fortunately for Delia's nerves they were not kept long in 

durance vile. Lorna very soon discovered the loss of her buddy, drew Miss Morley's attention to 

the matter, and the whole party hastened back to look for them. The custodian was fetched from 

his wooden shelter and unlocked the door, loudly disclaiming any responsibility on his part, and 

blaming the guide.  "It's your own fault," scolded Miss Morley. "You really _must_ keep with the 

party. I can't have any of you wandering off alone. You can't expect me to count you every time we 

come out of a building. I put you on your parole not to get separated again."  "We won't indeed, 



_indeed_! We don't like being lost," promised the delinquents earnestly.  Everybody, including the 

Principal, was very tired by this time, and not altogether sorry when the guide finished his tour of 

the ruins, and conducted them safely back again to the entrance.  "It's glorious, but you want days 

to see it in, instead of only a few hours," sighed Phyllis.  "And cast-iron backs and legs," agreed 

Sybil. "I shall enjoy thinking it over when I'm home, but I'm ready to drop at the present moment." 

"What about my camera?" asked Irene anxiously.  The guide had not forgotten it; he produced it 

from his pocket, and--perhaps in consideration of the tip he had received from Miss Morley--he did 

not confiscate the spool, but handed it over intact with a polite gesture and a cryptic smile. 

"Grazie molto--_molto_!" murmured Irene, which meant "Thanks awfully," and was one of the very 

few Italian phrases which she knew.  Everybody was extremely glad to adjourn to the restaurant, 

where tea had been ordered for their party, and a table reserved for them. The big room was full of 

visitors and rather noisy; a band of musicians in the center rendered Neapolitan songs to an 

accompaniment of mandolins and guitars, and occasionally the audience joined the choruses. The 

performance was not of the highest quality, but it was tuneful and interesting to those who had not 

before heard the folk-songs of Southern Italy. After tea the girls made a rush to buy post-cards and 

other mementoes of Pompeii, which were on sale in a room next to the restaurant, and would have 

spent half an hour over their purchases had not Miss Morley collected her flock and insisted on a 

homeward start. Poor little Desiree slept all the way back in the tramcar, with her head on Stella's 

shoulder, and most of the party were in much more sober spirits than when they had started. All 

felt, however, that it was a never-to-be-forgotten experience.  "I'd adore to making chocolate and 

sweetmeats (dulces) is so enormous, that the exportation has been hitherto entirely null. The 

finest plantations of sugar are in the valleys of Aragua and of the Tuy, near Pao de Zarate, 

between La Victoria and San Sebastian, near Guatire, Guarenas, and Caurimare. The first canes 

arrived in the New World from the Canary Islands; and even now Canarians, or Islenos, are placed 

at the head of most of the great plantations, and superintend the labours of cultivation and refining. 

It is this connexion between the Canarians and the inhabitants of Venezuela, that has given rise to 

the introduction of camels into those provinces. The Marquis del Toro caused three to be brought 

from Lancerote. The expense of conveyance was very considerable, owing to the space which 

these animals occupy on board merchant-vessels, and the great quantity of water they require 

during a long sea-voyage. A camel, bought for thirty piastres, costs between eight and nine 

hundred before it reaches the coast of Caracas. We saw four of these animals at Mocundo; three 

of which had been bred in America. Two others had died of the bite of the coral, a venomous 

serpent very common on the banks of the lake. These camels have hitherto been employed only 

in the conveyance of the sugarcanes to the mill. The males, stronger than the females, carry from 

forty to fifty arrobas. A wealthy landholder in the province of Varinas, encouraged by the example 

of the Marquis del Toro, has allotted a sum of 15,000 piastres for the purpose of bringing fourteen 

or fifteen camels at once from the Canary Islands. It is presumed these beasts of burden may be 

employed in the conveyance of merchandise across the burning plains of Casanare, from the 

Apure and Calabozo, which in the season of drought resemble the deserts of Africa. How 

advantageous it would have been had the Conquistadores, from the beginning of the sixteenth 

century, peopled America with camels, as they have peopled it with horned cattle, horses, and 

mules. Wherever there are immense distances to cross in uninhabited lands; wherever the 



construction of canals becomes difficult (as in the isthmus of Panama, on the table-land of Mexico, 

and in the deserts that separate the kingdom of Quito from Peru, and Peru from Chile), camels 

would be of the highest importance, to facilitate inland commerce. It seems the more surprising, 

that their introduction was not encouraged by the government at the beginning of the conquest, as, 

long after the taking of Grenada, camels, for which the Moors had a great predilection, were still 

very common in the south of Spain. A Biscayan, Juan de Reinaga, carried some of these animals 

at his own expense to Peru. Father Acosta saw them at the foot of the Andes, about the end of the 

sixteenth century; but little care being taken of them, they scarcely ever bred, and the race soon 

became extinct. In those times of oppression and cruelty, which have been described as the era of 

Spanish glory, the commendatories (encomenderos) let out the Indians to travellers like beasts of 

burden. They were assembled by hundreds, either to carry merchandise across the Cordilleras, or 

to follow the armies in their expeditions of discovery and pillage. The Indians endured this service 

more patiently, because, owing to the almost total want of domestic animals, they had long been 

constrained to perform it, though in a less inhuman manner, under the government of their own 

chiefs. The introduction of camels attempted by Juan de Reinaga spread an alarm among the 

encomenderos, who were, not by law, but in fact, lords of the Indian villages. The court listened to 

the complaints of the encomenderos; and in consequence America was deprived of one of the 

means which would have most facilitated inland communication, and the exchange of productions. 

Now, however, there is no reason why the introduction of camels should not be attempted as a 

general measure. Some hundreds of these useful animals, spread over the vast surface of 

America, in hot and barren places, would in a few years have a powerful influence on the public 

prosperity. Provinces separated by steppes would then appear to be brought nearer to each other; 

several kinds of inland merchandize would diminish in price on the coast; and by increasing the 

number of camels, above all the species called hedjin, or the ship of the desert, a new life would 

be given to the industry and commerce of the New World.  On the evening of the 22nd we 

continued our journey from Mocundo by Los Guayos to the city of Nueva Valencia. We passed a 

little forest of palm-trees, which resembled, by their appearance, and their leaves spread like a 

fan, the Chamaerops humilis of the coast of Barbary. The trunk, however, rises to twenty-four and 

sometimes thirty feet high. It is probably a new species of the genus corypha; and is called in the 

country palma de sombrero, the footstalks of the leaves being employed in weaving hats 

resembling our straw hats. This grove of palm-trees, the withered foliage of which rustles at the 

least breath of air--the camels feeding in the plain--the undulating motion of the vapours on a soil 

scorched by the ardour of the sun, give the landscape an African aspect. The aridity of the land 

augments as the traveller approaches the town, after passing the western extremity of the lake. It 

is a clayey soil, which has been levelled and abandoned by the waters. The neighbouring hills, 

called Los Morros de Valencia, are composed of white tufa, a very recent limestone formation, 

immediately covering the gneiss. It is again found at Victoria, and on several other points along the 

chain of the coast. The whiteness of this tufa, which reflects the rays of the sun, contributes greatly 

to the excessive heat felt in this place. Everything seems smitten with sterility; scarcely are a few 

plants of cacao found on the banks of the Rio de Valencia; the rest of the plain is bare, and 

destitute of vegetation. This appearance of 


_
Pompeian lamp, which her chum had given her for a souvenir.  "So would I," agreed Irene. "Miss 

Morley calls this 'part of our education,' and I think it's a very sensible way of teaching things. I 

hope she'll take us to other places."  "You'll get Vesuvius if your conduct sheet is all right."  "Oh, 

lovely! I'd rather go there than even to Pompeii."  "The same this child," chipped in Delia. "Renie, I 

guess you and I will have to shake ourselves up and reform for a week or two. We were in Miss 

Morley's black book to-day, and if we don't take care we shall be left out of the next excursion." 

"I'll be an absolute saint," promised Irene. "You'll see me sprouting wings. I'm going to draw a 

physical map of the world and mark in all the principal volcanoes, and then show it to Miss Morley. 

She'll think it so brainy of me and be so glad I'm interested in the subject. She'd really feel I ought 

to see Vesuvius after that."  "You schemer! It's not a bad idea though, and perhaps I'll do the 

same, though I hate drawing maps. Hello! Is this the piazza? I'd no idea we'd got back to Fossato 

so soon. Yes, it's been a 'happy day,' but I feel all I want now is supper and bed."     CHAPTER IX 

Reprisals   It was immediately after this that Peachy, who was always doing imprudent things and 

running risks, went a little too far and caught a severe chill. She was moved into the sanatorium, a 

room at the top of the house, and spent three quite happy days in bed, reading books and 

magazines, and drinking hot lemonade, which was Miss Rodgers' favorite remedy for a cold. 

When she was certified as free from any infection, a few of her special chums were allowed to visit 

her. She petitioned specially for Jess, Delia, and Irene. They found her propped up with pillows, 

and looking very charming in a pale pink dressing-jacket and her hair tied back with a broad 

ribbon.  "Thanks very much. I'm sitting up and taking nourishment," she grinned, in reply to their 

commiserations. "I'm going to have everywhere in the valleys of Aragua, to the cultivation of 

indigo; which, according to the planters, is, of all plants, that which most exhausts (cansa) the 

ground. The real physical causes of this phenomenon would be an interesting inquiry, since, like 

the effects of fallowing land, and of a rotation of crops, it is far from being sufficiently understood. I 

shall only observe in general, that the complaints of the increasing sterility of cultivated land 

become more frequent between the tropics, in proportion as they are near the period of their first 

breaking-up. In a region almost destitute of herbs, where every plant has a ligneous stem, and 

tends to raise itself as a shrub, the virgin soil remains shaded either by great trees, or by bushes; 

and under this tufted shade it preserves everywhere coolness and humidity. However active the 

vegetation of the tropics may appear, the number of roots that penetrate into the earth, is not so 

great in an uncultivated soil; while the plants are nearer to each other in lands subjected to 

cultivation, and covered with indigo, sugar-canes, or cassava. The trees and shrubs, loaded with 

branches and leaves, draw a great part of their nourishment from the ambient air; and the virgin 

soil augments its fertility by the decomposition of the vegetable substances which progressively 

accumulate. It is not so in the fields covered with indigo, or other herbaceous plants; where the 

rays of the sun penetrate freely into the earth, and by the accelerated combustion of the hydrurets 

of carbon and other acidifiable principles, destroy the germs of fecundity. These effects strike the 

imagination of the planters the more forcibly, as in lands newly inhabited they compare the fertility 

of a soil which has been abandoned to itself during thousands of years, with the produce of 

ploughed fields. The Spanish colonies on the continent, and the great islands of Porto-Rico and 

Cuba, possess remarkable advantages with respect to the produce of 


_
before I pop off! Joking apart, I've had the time of my life here. It's been blissful just reading and 

resting, with a big jug of lemonade at my elbow."  "We've been talking about you downstairs. Didn't 

your ears burn?" asked Jess.  "Not more than usual. What were you saying about poor little me?" 

"We had a special meeting of the Camellia Buds, and passed a vote of sympathy, for one thing. I 

suppose I ought to 'convey' it to you in the orthodox fashion."  "Highly gratified, I'm sure," chirped 

Peachy. "How do I return thanks, please? I can't get up in bed and bow. What next?"  "Well, the 

next is that nobody can think of anything original for the Transition to do at the carnival, and 

everybody said 'Ask Peachy,' so we've come to you for a suggestion."  "Whew! That's a big order," 

groaned the invalid. "We've had almost every kind of stunt that's practically possible. What are the 

seniors getting up this time?"  "Something musical, to judge from the practicing we hear. It sounds 

like operetta. And the juniors are having a fairy play. Miss Morgan is teaching them. What we want 

is something utterly and entirely different."  "Exactly!" agreed Peachy, taking a drink of lemonade. 

"If you don't have a brain-throb we shall have to descend to an ordinary concert."  "Or a scene 

from Shakespeare."  "Or a _tableau vivant_."  "And those have been done simply dozens of 

times."  "I know," frowned Peachy. "We had 'The Trial Scene' from _The Merchant of the lesser 

West India islands. The former, from their extent, the variety of their scenery, and their small 

relative population, still bear all the characters of a new soil; while at Barbadoes, Tobago, St. 

Lucia, the Virgin Islands, and the French part of St. Domingo, it may be perceived that long 

cultivation has begun to exhaust the soil. If in the valleys of Aragua, instead of abandoning the 

indigo grounds, and leaving them fallow, they were covered during several years, not with corn, 

but with other alimentary plants and forage; if among these plants such as belong to different 

families were preferred, and which shade the soil by their large leaves, the amelioration of the 

fields would be gradually accomplished, and they would be restored to a part of their former 

fertility.  The city of Nueva Valencia occupies a considerable extent of ground, but its population 

scarcely amounts to six or seven thousand souls. The streets are very broad, the market place, 

(plaza mayor,) is of vast dimensions; and, the houses being low, the disproportion between the 

population of the town, and the space that it occupies, is still greater than at Caracas. Many of the 

whites, (especially the poorest,) forsake their houses, and live the greater part of the year in their 

little plantations of indigo and cotton, where they can venture to work with their own hands; which, 

according to the inveterate prejudices of that country, would be a disgrace to them in 


_
again. Oh, don't bother me! Let me think. How can I get ideas when you're all talking at once?" 

Peachy put her fingers in her ears and buried her head temporarily in the pillow, from which she 

appeared to draw inspiration, for in a few moments she sprang up with a bounce of rapture.  "Got 

Nueva Valencia, founded in 1555 under the government of Villacinda, by Alonzo Diaz Moreno, is 

twelve years older than Caracas. Valencia was at first only a dependency of Burburata; but this 

latter town is nothing now but a place of embarkation for mules. It is regretted, and perhaps
