"Sir," said Mr. Green, "I am an honest and upright man. I don't think I am =
wrong; but if you can=20

show me that I am wrong, I am the man to confess so, and to make every repa=
ration in my=20

power."  "No doubt, sir; but you must pardon my caution. Gentlemen when sur=
prised are not=20

always so discreet as on ordinary occasions; and it must be an unpleasant t=
hing to feel that you=20

have been made a party to the punishment of an innocent person for a thief'=
s crime."  Mr. Green=20

had before this seriously looked at the possibility of its turning out that=
 his servant had been=20

injured by him. He had comforted himself by the notion that, as he had acte=
d _bona fide_, no great=20

blame could attach to him; and if such discovery were made, he had determin=
ed to pursue the=20

honourable course of restoring the injured girl, as far as he could, to her=
 place in society. He=20

assured me again of that fact.  "Then," I continued, "you will place yourse=
lf entirely in my hands=20

pending this investigation. I shall ask you to let me search this house fro=
m top to bottom, and in=20

every nook and cranny."  Mr. Green scarcely liked that. I somewhat surprise=
d him, and threw him=20

for a moment in embarrassment.  "I hardly think that necessary," he said.  =
"I do," I said; "and you=20

know I have had much      The bark they hail;--in many a groan       The be=

But bellowing shrouds respond alone;--       No voice returns the cry.     =

"Then I will again ask you to fortify yourself against the discovery of any=
 thing surprising; to act=20

with reserve; and I would implore you not to get up a scene in my presence.=
