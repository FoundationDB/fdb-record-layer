Ned Franks and his wife knew nothing of this secret subscription. The most =
active agent in=20

collecting it was Nancy Sands, who went from cottage to cottage gathering t=
he pence given with=20

willing hearts by the children, and the little offerings freely bestowed ev=
en by the old tenants of the=20

a Batter of Eggs, Milk, and Wheat-Flower, and dip small parcels of the Farc=
e into it to fry for=20

garnishing. You may make a Sauce to these farced Fowls with stew'd Mushroom=
s toss'd up with=20

Cream; the same may be done with Turkeys, Pheasants, _&c_.    To make a bro=
wn or white=20

Fricassee of Chickens. From the same.  Strip the Chickens of their Skins as=
 soon as they are=20

kill'd, and when they are=20


_
Hollow. Had the power of the villagers to give been equal to their will, Ne=
d would have been the=20

wealthiest man in Colme; but it needs a great weight in copper to make up a=
 single sovereign's=20

worth, and even the vicar, whose charity never left him a full purse, was u=
nable to contribute=20

largely, though he gave with all his heart.     XXXVI.  A Struggle.   Two, =
three, almost four weeks=20

passed, every week bringing fresh disappointments to Franks and his wife. T=
he vicar sent over to=20

them every morning the advertisement sheet of the _Times_; and anxiously we=
re the columns of=20

the paper searched and searched over again each day, and many were the lett=
ers written by Ned,=20

or by Persis to his dictation, to take advantage of what they fondly hoped =
might be openings to=20

some new sphere of work. But few of these letters brought any reply, and th=
ere was not one of an=20

encouraging nature. Ned always frankly stated the facts that he had passed =
no regular=20

examination, and that he had lost his left arm; and one or other of these d=
isqualifications seemed=20

ever to bar his way to obtaining any employment.  Isaacs had exerted himsel=
f greatly in his friend's=20

behalf in London, but hitherto without any success. He them a little in Hog=
's-Lard; after which, put=20

them to stew with a little Butter and Gravy, for a brown Fricassee, or Butt=
er and Water for a white=20

Fricassee; to either of these add a Glass of White Wine, with a Seasoning o=
f Salt, Pepper,=20

Nutmeg, Cherville cut small, and three or four young Onions whole, that the=
y may be withdrawn=20

when the Fricassee is enough: Then brown the Sauce with some of the same La=
rd the Chickens=20

were fry'd in, and thicken it with burnt Flower; to this you may add fry'd =
or stew'd Mushrooms. But=20

for a white Fricassee, instead of the browning with the Lard and burnt Flow=
er, thicken the Sauces=20

with three or four Yolks of Eggs, and a little Verjuice; or else when the F=
ricassee is stew'd enough,=20

take off the Fat as much as possible, and toss it up with Cream; this will =
serve to fricassee=20

Rabbits.  In Lent, and on Fast-days, I have eaten very good Soups abroad, t=
hat were made=20

without any Flesh. And as that is not very common in _England_, I thought i=
t convenient to bring=20

over the Receipts with me, that we may know how to make the best of every t=
hing about a Farm.=20

To make Fish-Gravy for Soups.  To make this Fish-Gravy, which may serve for=
 a Foundation of all=20

Fish Soups, take=20


_
making his way would be greater were he himself on the spot, and sent a pre=
ssing invitation in the=20

name of Sophy to the family of the Frankses. It was arranged that Ned, Pers=
is, and their baby=20

should travel up to London on the succeeding Thursday, the day on which the=
ir dear home must=20

be given up to a stranger.  The new school-master had already arrived at th=
e Hall, and was=20

constantly showing himself in the Outsides scour'd well with Salt; then pul=
l out their Gills, and put=20

them in a Kettle with Water, Salt, a bunch of sweet Herbs, and an Onion stu=
ck with Cloves; boil=20

these an hour and a half, and then strain off the Liquor thro' a Cloth: add=
 to this the Peelings of=20

Mushrooms well wash'd, or Mushrooms themselves cut small; boil these togeth=
er, and strain the=20

Liquor thro' a Sieve into a Stew-Pan, upon some burnt=20


_
at church, where, on the first Sunday in August, the vicar had come to retu=
rn thanks for recovery=20

after his long and dangerous illness. The irreverent manner of the school-m=
aster-elect, who looked=20

like--what he was--a low sharper, likely to teach the boys little but how t=
o play, or to cheat at cards,=20

made a very painful which will soon render it of a good Colour, and delicat=
e Flavour, fit for Soups,=20

which may be varied according to the Palate, by putting in Pot-Herbs and Sp=
ices to every one's=20

liking; this will keep good some time. When you make any of this into Soup,=
 remember to put a=20

Glass of white Wine into your Soup a little before you=20
