In a five months' campaign Jackson had established peace on the border, had=
 broken the power=20

of the hostile Indians, and had substantially conquered Florida. Not a whit=
e man in his army had=20

been killed in battle, and not even the most extravagant eulogist could ave=
r that the war had been=20

a great military triumph. None the less, the people--especially in the West=
 and South--were=20

intensely pleased. Life in the frontier regions would now be safer; and the=
 acquisition of the=20

coveted Florida country was brought appreciably nearer. The popular sentime=
nt on the latter=20

subject found characteristic expression in a toast at a banquet given at Na=
shville in honor of the=20

returning conqueror: "Pensacola--Spanish perfidy and Indian barbarity rende=
red its capture=20

necessary. May our Government never surrender it from the fear of war!"  It=
 was easy enough for=20

Jackson to "take" Florida and for the people to rejoice in the exploit. To =
defend or explain away the=20

irregular features of the act was, however, quite a different matter; and t=
hat was the task which fell=20

to the authorities at Washington. "The territory of a friendly power had be=
en invaded, its officers=20

deposed, its towns and fortresses taken possession of; two citizens of anot=
her friendly and=20

powerful nation had been executed in scandalously summary fashion, upon sus=
picion rather than=20

universal charity, this century which is undertaking the task of righting a=
ll the wrongs accumulated=20

from the past, one can find apologists for the enemy of mankind himself. Th=
e moral of this homily=20

is--it may be apparent to some of my readers--that if you are either very g=
ood or very bad you get=20

much talked about in history: there will be some to defend you no matter ho=
w bad you are, and=20

some to denounce you no matter how good you are. But if you simply do your =
duty, without fear=20

and without advertisement, little will be said of you; history, at least in=
 traditions still partly ruling,=20

does not dignify with the epithet "great" the steady day-laborers who go ab=
out their task and=20

complete it in silence. This, I would imply, is partly the reason why Blanc=
he de Castille has never=20

been heralded as great, and why her work in the upbuilding of the French mo=
narchy is taken as a=20

matter of course, and not praised like, for example, the more brilliant exp=
loits of the "Grande=20

Monarque" who was to do so much to undermine the power of that monarchy.  T=
he fame of the=20

mother is eclipsed by the peculiar glory of the son; but would it not be fa=
ir to ask how much of the=20

excellence of Louis the man, how much of the glory of Louis the king, was d=
ue to Blanche de=20

Castille? It cannot be questioned that she found France in a condition most=
=20


_
Monroe and his Cabinet were therefore given many anxious days and sleepless=
 nights. They=20

wanted to buy Florida, not conquer it. They had entertained no thought of a=
uthorizing the things=20

that Jackson had done. They recognized that the Tennesseean's crude notions=
 of international law=20

could not be upheld in dealings with proud European States. Yet it was born=
e in upon them from=20

every side that the nation approved what had been the royal power. A glance=
 at the history of her=20

career will show that she not only averted this danger, but that the crown =
was stronger when she=20

began to relinquish her authority than it had been under Louis VIII. She re=
duced her rebellious=20

vassals to submission; she more than held her own against England; she ende=
d the war against=20

Raymond of Toulouse, and reserved for France the control, immediate or ulti=
mate, of the greater=20

But the controversy spread beyond the Cabinet circle. During the winter of =
1818-19 Congress took=20

it up, and a determined effort was made to carry a vote of censure. The deb=
ate in the House--with=20

galleries crowded to suffocation, we are informed by the National force, bu=
t by wise and patient=20

policy. Louis IX. owed his crown to Blanche's care as regent; it is not imp=
robable that he owed her=20

as much during the years when he himself was on the throne and she but a co=
unsellor. History is=20

silent on many points in this connection, but it=20
