movements were watched until he landed at the port of ----. Here, as no ins=

on the Continent were given me, he was left.  The principal creditors of th=

follow him. He was now an outlaw. The time for his surrender had expired. A=
 warrant that would=20

run into hold.  The wind increased steadily, blowing from the same quarter =
continuously. Though=20

the only recorded observations are at this one point, its proximity to the =
equator, the steadiness of=20

the wind and the length of time it blew indicate a cyclonic tempest of unus=

the wind was a strong gale: not too strong in the harbor for small boats, h=

no risks.  An hour later immense rollers were coming in from the ocean, fin=

removal to this country. The requisite processes--or those which able lawye=
rs thought sufficient--

were obtained, and placed in my hands.  I went over myself, and one of the =
Liverpool gentlemen=20

was my agreeable companion.  In obedience to the wishes of my employer and =
associate, I=20

consented to go with him to the office of the British consul.  The British =
consul was a high and=20

mighty man in his own esteem, and he snuffed me out in the grandest style. =
I could not help=20

was falling. The wind still increased. The vessels were pitching fearfully.=
 At this time the _Eber_,=20

nearest the shore, began dragging her anchors, and was compelled to aid the=

At one o=E2=80=99clock the _Vandalia_, also, was compelled to use her engin=
es. Should the wind increase,=20

their case was truly desperate.  The rain poured in torrents; fiercer grew =
the gale. By three o=E2=80=99clock=20

every vessel in the harbor was dragging her anchors. There might be a colli=
sion, or a wreck, at=20

any time. Every able-bodied man was=20

differently in France to what they do in England, sir, I can tell you. Now,=
 leave the matter all to me,=20

sir, till the fellow's captured, and you have him again in England."  I and=
 my friend retired to the=20

passage of the consul's office (which was one small room) to confer on the =
subject. The consul=20

also had a conference in his office with his man of all work, whose name I =
afterwards ascertained=20

to be Boggy. At this conference I agreed to allow the consul to take his ow=
n course of action in=20

France, and I was to merely assist when asked to render that any emergency =
might be met.=20

Neither officer nor private could think of sleep.  Those on shore realized =
the peril of the situation.=20

Accustomed to heavy gales, the natives slept soundly for a time in their lo=
w huts. At length, the=20

crash of falling trees and the tearing away of roofs began to be heard in t=
he storm. Little knots of=20

people crept about in the darkness, seeking shelter from the tempest. Sand =
and pebbles, gathered=20

up from the beach, were hurled by the wind with cutting force. The tide was=
 rising, and the gale=20

brought it into the streets, a hundred feet above the usual high water mark=

"Well, my man Boggy shall go and see whether the fellow is at this moment i=

 night.  Long=20

themselves were measurably safe. But those in the harbor!  There was little=
