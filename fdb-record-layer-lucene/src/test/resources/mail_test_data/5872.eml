philodendron monstera of depression with the Federal Reserve Board at Washi=

OF THE MONSTER   HERE'S the idea. Were you one of a coterie of multi-millio=
naires lusting for the control of American industry and finance--exclusivel=
y for pillage--you would, if necessary, join in providing any amount of cap=
ital necessary to obtain the result. You could afford party of twenty sent =
from Boston to Brookfield to parley with them. Attacking Brookfield itself,=
 they burned it, except one fortified house. The inhabitants were saved by =
Major Willard, who, on information of their danger, came with a troop of ho=
rse from Lancaster, thirty miles through the woods, to their rescue. A body=
 of troops presently arrived from the eastward, and were stationed for some=
 time at philodendron monstera of depression with the Federal Reserve Board=

of this monster abhorred the idea of a "Central Bank." It was the furthest =
possible from their pure=20

thoughts of altruistic finance! They were going to have twelve banks, each =
one established in a=20

center of industry and catering to and upbuilding the industries in its reg=
ional zone. Each one was=20

going to be a separate and distinct corporation absolutely disconnected fro=
m its eleven brethren.=20

This idea was advertised, adulated, and saccharinely paeanized until Americ=
a was lulled to sleep.=20

For month after month this cone of chloroform was held over American citize=
ns until the anesthetic=20

took effect. Then came forth what was known as the Glass-Owen bill. The smo=
othness of its head=20

sponsors' name was symbolic. The ground had been prepared for its reception=
. Propaganda seed=20

had been diligently sown. Years of the most astute scheming and plotting of=
 the brainiest=20

schemers who ever schemed bore its fruit in the Glass-Owen bill. On rails g=
reased by years of=20

propaganda it slid into the legislative hopper, came through in an oil bath=
 and went to President=20

Wilson. Whether he was the deceived or the deceiver none but himself knows.=
 But he painted the=20

Federal Reserve System with his most magnificent verbal rainbow colors, pra=
ted of it as "the=20

emancipator of credit," signed it in the midst of a coterie of sycophantic =
Pecksniffs and the pen=20

whose strokes made it a law was religiously preserved!  Its real authors--w=
ho had spent years in=20

weaving its phrases and scores of thousands of dollars in propagandizing fo=
r its passage--winked,=20

smiled in their sleeves and prepared for pillage. The Federal Reserve Syste=
m was born with a=20

caul--concealing its grin of greed--and was brought into being by the most =
astute coterie of=20

legislative accoucheurs who ever delivered a babe of legislation.  Here and=
 now read just two of=20

the sample promises made by the Money Masters at the birth of their monster=
. They told you that=20

the Federal Reserve System would "prevent unfair and undue constriction of =
credits with its=20

consequent paralyzing effect on business and on the productive energies of =
the nation." They told=20

you that "men will not be thrown out of then, confident of their superiorit=
y, and comparing=20

themselves to the Lord=E2=80=99s chosen people driving the heathen out of t=
he land, they rushed eagerly=20

into the contest, without a single effort at the preservation of peace. Ind=
eed, their pretensions=20

hardly admitted of it. Philip was denounced as a rebel in arms against his =
lawful superiors, with=20

whom it would be folly and weakness to treat on any terms short of absolute=
 submission.  A body=20

of volunteers, horse and foot, raised in Massachusetts, marched under Major=
 Savage, in June,=20

1675, four days after the attack on Swanzey, to join the Plymouth forces. A=
fter one or two slight=20

skirmishes, they penetrated to the Wampanoag villages at Mount Hope, but fo=
und them empty and=20

deserted. Philip and his warriors, conscious of their inferiority, had aban=
doned their homes. If the=20

Narragansets, on the opposite side of the bay, did not openly join the Wamp=
anoags, they would,=20

at least, be likely to afford shelter to their women and children. The troo=
ps were therefore ordered=20

into the Narraganset country, accompanied by commissioners to demand assura=
nces of peaceful=20

intentions, and a promise to deliver up all fugitive enemies of the colonis=
ts--pledges which the=20

Narragansets felt themselves constrained to give.  Arrived at Taunton on th=
eir return from the=20

Narraganset country, news came that Philip and his warriors had been discov=
ered by Church, of=20

Plymouth colony, collected in a great swamp at Pocasset, now Tiverton, the =
southern district of the=20

Wampanoag country, whence small parties sallied forth to burn and plunder t=
he neighboring=20

settlements. After a march of eighteen miles, having reached the designated=
 spot, the soldiers=20

found there a hundred wigwams lately built, but empty and deserted, the Ind=
ians having retired=20

deep into the swamp. The colonists followed; but the ground was soft; the t=
hicket was difficult to=20



penetrate; the companies were soon thrown into disorder. Each man fired at =
every bush he saw=20

shake, thinking an Indian might lay concealed behind it, and several were t=
hus wounded by their=20

own friends. When night came on, the assailants retired with the loss of si=
xteen men.=20


_
financial and commercial panic, but finance and commerce will be steady. Hu=
ndreds and=20

thousands of men will not suddenly be thrown out of employment during these=
 national waves of=20

depression nor undue feverish buoyancy." Peg these specious promises in you=
r brainery and=20

compare them later on with the actual performances of swamp continued to be=
 watched and=20

guarded, but Philip broke through, not without some loss, and escaped into =
the country of the=20

Nipmucks, in the interior of Massachusetts. That tribe had already commence=
d hostilities by=20

attacking Mendon. They waylaid and killed Captain Hutchinson, a son of the =
famous Mrs.=20

Hutchinson, and=20
