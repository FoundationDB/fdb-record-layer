 so badly, after all.=20

"Yes, yes!" the "General" was remarking, as he gazed at the string of mules=
 that alternately issued=20

from and re-entered the fissure on the opposite side of the valley; "yes, y=

the shaft is more than paying off the hands," replied Redburn, seating hims=
elf upon a bowlder, and=20

staring vacantly at the dense column of smoke ejected from the smoke-stack =
in the roof of the=20

crusher building.  "I was looking up accounts last evening, and after deduc=
ting what you paid for=20

the machinery, and what wages are due the Utes, we have about a thousand do=
llars and he=20

wanted to be sure that he had opened a sufficient number of productive news=
 channels to ensure=20

a continuous flow of readable literary information.  Occasionally he sent t=
o an editor here and=20

there what he thought was a particularly newsy letter just "for his informa=
tion, not for sale." The=20

editor of the _Philadelphia Times_ was the first to discover that his paper=
 wanted the letter, and=20

the _Boston Journal_ followed suit. Then the editor of the _Cincinnati Time=
s-Star_ discovered the=20

letter in the _New York Star_, and asked that it be supplied weekly with th=
e letter.  These=20

newspapers renamed the letter "Bok's Literary Leaves," and the feature star=

career.     CHAPTER X  THE CHANCES FOR SUCCESS  Edward Bok does not now rem=

"Exactly. Now, that's w'at I call fair to middling. Of course thar'll be mo=

dispute every step that a young man should take; and that favoritism only c=
ould bring one to the=20

top.  After Bok had been in the world of affairs, he wondered where were th=
ese choked avenues,=20

these struggling masses, these competitors for every inch of vantage.  Then=
 he gradually=20

discovered that they did not exist.  In the first place, he found=20


_
"Ho!" Redburn interrupted, suddenly, leaping to his feet; "they say the dev=
il's couriers are ever=20

around when you are talking of them. Look! invaders already."  He pointed t=
oward the east, where=20

the passage led out of the valley into the gorge beyond.  Out of this passa=
ge two persons on=20

horseback had just issued, and now they came and certainly not overpeopled.=
  He was surprised=20

how few there were who really stood in a young man's way.  He found that fa=
voritism was not the=20

factor that he had been led to suppose.  He realized it existed in a few is=
olated cases, but to these=20

every one had pointed and about these every one had talked until, in the pu=
blic mind,=20

out before them.  No sooner did the "General" clap his eyes on the pair tha=
n he uttered a cry of=20

astonishment, mingled with joy.  "It's thet scarlet chap, Fearless Frank!" =
he announced, hopping=20

about like a pig on a hot griddle "w'at I war tellin' ye about; the same cu=
