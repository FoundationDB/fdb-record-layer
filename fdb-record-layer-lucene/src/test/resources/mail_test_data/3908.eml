I put my hand down, and up they came, and got one worm apiece; and as I raised my hand, down they rushed, and Crepitude, K.C., forced her to admit that on first meeting Priam in his house in Werter Road she had not been quite sure of his identity, she replied--  "It's all come over me since.

Muskie, whose mounted body is now in the private office of Mr. Cameron himself, where Lee 

Henly sees it every day.    TEACHING FISH TO RING BELLS  By C. F. Holder  A certain pond in 

the country was once peopled with a number of turtles, frogs, and fishes which I came to consider 

my pets, and which at last grew so tame that I fed them from my hands. Among them, however, 

were four or five little sticklebacks that lived under the shade of a big willow, and these were so 

quarrelsome that I generally fed them apart from the rest. But sometimes all met, and then the 

feast usually was ended by the death of a minnow. For, shocking to say, whenever there was a 

dispute for the food, some one of the little fishes was almost sure entire world! As Henry Leek he 

married, and as Henry Leek he recommenced the art of painting--in Putney; he carried on the 

vocation several years without arousing the suspicions of a single person; and then--by a curious 

coincidence immediately after my client threatened an action against the defendant--he displayed 

himself in his true identity as Priam Farll. Such is the simple explanation," said Pennington, K.C., 

and added, "which you will hear presently from the defendant. Doubtless it will commend itself to 

you as experienced men of the world. You cannot but have perceived that such things are 

constantly happening in real life, that they are of daily occurrence. I am almost ashamed to stand 

up before you and endeavour to rebut a story so plausible and so essentially convincing. I feel that 

my task is well-nigh

hungry sticklebacks.  These stickleback-and-minnow combats, after a while, came to be of daily 

occurrence, and the reason for this was a singular one, which I must explain.  Under the willow 

shade, and from one of the branches, I had hung a miniature "belfry," containing a tiny brass bell, 

and had led the string into the water, letting it go down to a considerable depth. At first, I tied a bait 

at intervals upon the line, and the sticklebacks, of course, seized upon it, and thus rang the bell. 

Generally the ringing was done in a very grave and proper way, Nevertheless, I must do my best." 

And so on.  It was one of his greatest feats in the kind of irony that appeals to a jury. And the 

audience deemed that the case was already virtually decided.  After Whitney C. Witt and his 

secretary had been called and had filled the court with the echoing twang of New York (the 

controlled fury of the aged Witt was highly effective), Mrs. Henry Leek was invited to the witness-

box. She was supported thither by her two curates, who, however, could not prevent her from 

weeping at the stern voice of the usher. She related 


_
although sometimes, when the bait was too tightly tied, the quick peals sounded like a call to a fire. 

I kept up this system of baiting the string for about a week, until I thought they understood it, and 

then replaced the worms by bits of stone. As I expected, the next morning, as I looked through the 

grass and down into the water, tinkle!  "Is that your husband?" demanded Vodrey, K.C. (who had 

now assumed the principal _role_, Pennington, K.C., being engaged in another play in another 

theatre), pointing with one of his well-conceived dramatic gestures to Priam Farll.  "It is," sobbed 

Mrs. Henry Leek.  The unhappy creature believed what she said, and the curates, though silent, 

made
