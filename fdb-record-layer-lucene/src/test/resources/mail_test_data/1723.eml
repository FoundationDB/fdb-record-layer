Telzey felt a quick, angry stirring begin about her, felt her face whiten. =
 "All right," she said "I'll give=20

you proof! I'll have to now. But that'll be it. Once they've tipped their h=

about thirty seconds left to make the right move. I hope you remember that!=
"  He cleared his=20

throat. "I--"  "NOW!" Telzey said.  Along the walls of the balcony garden, =
beside the ornamental=20

flower stands, against the edges of the rock pool, the crest cats appeared.=
 Perhaps thirty of them.=20

None quite as physically impressive as Iron Thoughts who stood closest to t=
he Moderator; but=20

none very far from it. Motionless as rocks, frightening as gargoyles, they =
waited, eyes glowing with=20

hellish excitement.  "This is _their_ council, you see," Telzey heard herse=
lf saying.  The=20

Moderator's face had also paled. But he was, after all, an old shikari and =
a senior diplomat. He=20

took an unhurried look around the circle, said quietly, "Accept my profound=
 apologies for doubting=20

you. Miss Amberdon!" and reached for the desk communicator.  Iron Thoughts =
swung his demon=20

head in Telzey's direction. For an instant, she picked up the mental impres=
sion of a fierce yellow=20

stopped.  =E2=80=9CHuman thought will never guide you; and very justly, whe=

truth. You are now your own master; go at once to its fountain-head; go to =

Rome.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 46 There can be little doubt, generally speaki=
ng, that it is more satisfactory=20

to pass Sunday in the country than in town. There is something in the essen=
tial stillness of=20

country-life, which blends harmoniously with the ordinance of the most divi=
ne of our divine laws. It=20

is pleasant, too, when the congregation breaks up, to greet one=E2=80=99s n=
eighbors; to say kind words to=20

kind faces; to hear some rural news profitable to=20

"... An open transmitter line to Orado," the Moderator was saying into the =
communicator. "The=20

Council. And snap it up! Some very important visitors are waiting."  The of=
fices of Jontarou's=20

Planetary Moderator became an extremely busy and interesting area then. Qui=
te two hours=20

passed before it occurred to anyone to ask Telzey again whether she knew wh=
ere her aunt was at=20

present.  Telzey smote her forehead.  "Forgot all about that!" she admitted=
, fishing the sportscar's=20

keys out of the pocket of her sunbriefs. "They're out on the parking platfo=
rm...."         *       *       *=20

e Hub and the new=20

Affiliated Species of the Planet of Jontarou were formally ratified two som=
etimes prevents others=20

from doing some harm. A quiet, domestic walk, too, in the afternoon, has it=
s pleasures; and so=20

numerous and so various are the sources of interest in the country, that, t=
hough it be Sunday,=20

there is no reason why your walk should not have an object.  But Sunday in =
the country, with your=20

house full of visitors, is too often an exception to this general truth. It=
 is a trial. Your guests cannot=20

always be at church, and, if they could, would not like it. There is nothin=
g to interest or amuse=20

them; no sport; no castles or factories to visit; no adventurous expedition=
s; no gay music in the=20

morn, and no light dance in the evening. There is always danger of the day =
becoming a course of=20

heavy meals and stupid walks, for the=20

the Champagne Hall of the Shikaris' Club.  Telzey was able to follow the ev=
ent only by news=20

viewer in her ship-cabin, she and Halet being on the return trip to Orado b=
y then. She wasn't too=20

interested in the treaty's details--they conformed almost exactly to what s=
he had read out to Iron=20

Thoughts and his co-chiefs and companions in the park. It was the smooth br=
idging of the wide=20

language gap between the contracting parties by a row of interpreting machi=
nes and a handful of=20

human xenotelepaths which held her attention.  As she switched off the view=
er, Halet came=20

wandering in from the adjoining cabin.  "I was watching it, too!" Halet obs=
erved. She smiled. "I was=20

hoping to see dear Tick-Tock."  Telzey looked over at her. teeming circumst=
ances, natural and=20

human, though full of concern to you, are to your visitors an insipid blank=
.  How did Sunday go off=20

at Muriel Towers?  In the first place, there was a special train, which, at=
 an early hour, took the=20

cardinal and his suite and the St. Jerome family to Grandchester, where the=
y were awaited with=20

profound expectation. But the Anglican portion of the guests were not witho=
ut their share of=20

ecclesiastical and spiritual excitement, for the bishop was to preach this =
day in the chapel of the=20

Towers, a fine and capacious sanctuary of florid Gothic, and his lordship w=
as a sacerdotal orator=20

of repute.  It had been announced that the breakfast-hour was to be somewha=
