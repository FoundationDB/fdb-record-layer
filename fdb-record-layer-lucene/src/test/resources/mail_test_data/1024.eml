will endeavor to give an accurate account of the prisoner's mode of occupation, his ideals, hopes 

and aspirations and follow him from the day he entered the prison, from his initiation into the 

various departments, to the day of his final discharge. One of our celebrated poets has truly said: 

A prison is a house of care,     A place where few can thrive,     A touchstone true to try a friend, 

But a grave to one alive.   This stanza sums up the situation very nicely, although prison life is not 

the horrible nightmare that many authors have depicted. Most writers seem to get their ideas from 

the comic papers, wherein the prisoner is absurdly cartooned with close-cropped hair, low-browed 

and villainous looks, dressed in striped clothing of grotesque fit, and in many cases he is pictured 

chained to the floor by a huge ball and chain. This may have been an authentic description of the 

average prisoner years ago, but is not true today. It is a far cry from the time when Diogenes 

walked the streets of ancient Athens with a lighted lantern in the day time looking for an honest 

man. There were no prisons at that period of the world's history. If a man committed a serious 

crime against the state or an individual the authorities ordered the lictor to strike off his head. If the 

offense was a minor one the offender was sold into slavery. This mode of procedure required only 

a few moments to execute, for in those days there were no protracted trials or clever attorneys to 

seek technicalities through which to free their clients. This condition of affairs prevailed for many 

centuries, and it often happened that a greater injustice was done the wrongdoer than he had 

committed against the state.  Fortunately, however, it remained for Victor Hugo to cry a halt 

against the then inhuman treatment accorded prisoners. In "Les Miserables" he paints a vivid 

picture that profoundly awakened public conscience, which still causes the world to shudder as it 

thinks of the injustice society did to to make the Figures regular; these will be fit to eat in about 

eight Months.    To make Cheese in imitation of _Cheshire_ Cheese.  When your Milk is set, and 

the Curd is come, it must not be broken with a Dish, as is usual in the making of other Cheeses, 

but drawn together by the Hands to one side of the Vessel, gently and regularly broken; for if it is 

roughly press'd, a great deal of the richness of the Milk will go into the Whey. As you thus gather 

your Curd, put it into the Vat or Cheese Mote till it is full, then press it and turn it often, salting it at 

several times. It is to be noted, that the Cheeses should be six or eight Inches thick, and will be fit 

to eat in a Year; they must be frequently turn'd and shifted upon the Shelf, and rubb'd often with a 

dry coarse Cloath, and at the Year's end may have a hole bored in the middle, so as to contain a 

quarter Pint of Sack, which must be pour'd into it, and then the hole stopp'd close with some of the 

same Cheese, and the Cheese set in a Wine Cellar for six Months to mellow; at the end of which 

time, the Sack will be all lost, and the hole will be in a manner clos'd up.    To make Cheese in 

imitation of those made in _Gloucestershire._  These Cheeses are to be about two Inches thick, 

and the Vats or Cheese Motes must be provided accordingly; set your Milk as directed in the 

former Receipts, and breaking it as equally and tenderly as possible, put it in a Cloth into the Vat, 

and set it in the press for an Hour; then take it out of the Press, and cut it in small Pieces, as big 

as Nutmegs, into a Pan of scalding Water, taking them again soon out of the Water, and sprinkle 

them with Salt at your pleasure, and return them again to the Vat or Cheese Mote, and keep them 

in the Press till the next Morning, and after that turn them and wipe them often, till they come to be 

very dry; or else when you have let one of these Cheeses press about two Hours, salt it on the 

upper side, and turn it at Night, and salt the side that lies uppermost,

starving.  There is today a more broad, more tolerant and a decidedly more civilized sentiment 

towards the inmates of penal institutions. It is universally recognized that the prisoner of today 

becomes the citizen of tomorrow; this fact must be conceded. Every effort is, therefore, made to 

assist them who have a keen desire to lead an honest life. in the Press till Morning; but the first 

way of cutting and salting it is much the best. These Cheeses will be fit to cut when they have 

been made eight Months; it is to be observ'd, that if we salt them in the manner first mention'd, that 

is, by cutting the Cheese, such Cheeses will be smooth-coated.    To make Slip-Coat Cheese,

inclined to go around with a "chip on his shoulder," so to speak, he will undoubtedly find as much 

trouble inside as he will outside of a prison. If he behaves himself, complies with the rules and 

performs his work in a conscientious manner he will have no more difficulty than he would 

anywhere else.  Modern penology has many bright _London_ Cream Cheese. From the Farm 

call'd the _Vaises_ in _Essex._  Take six Quarts of new Milk, and a Pint of Cream, put it together 

with a Spoonful of Rennet just warm, and let it stand till the Curd is come; then lay a Cloath in your 

Cheese Vat, and with a Skimming-Dish cut out the Curd, and lay it in the Vat till it is full,

"modern penology" is that era which ushered in the good-time law, whereby a prisoner is enabled 

by meritorious conduct to reduce his original sentence to a marked degree; the parole and grading 

system, which permits the release of a first offender at the expiration of half his sentence; the 

establishing of prison and as the Curd settles, lay more on, till you have laid on all. When the 

Whey is drain'd out, turn the Cheese into a dry Cloath, and then lay a weight of a Pound upon it; at 

Night turn it into another dry Cloath, and the next Morning salt it a little, then make a Bed of Nettles 

or Ash-Leaves to lay it on, and cover
