creature with a bushy tail attracted his attention.  It was about the size =
of a cat but the body scent=20

was not that of a cat.  Whatever it was, it was small and slow, and could b=
e easily caught and=20

killed.  Whether or not it was good to eat could be determined later, so th=
e hunter hurried after the=20

small black and white creature that looked so harmless.  A few that had emi=
grated to England from=20

France in the reign of Louis XIV. Unquestionably they had mixed their blood=
 frequently during the=20

interval and the vicissitudes of their various life; but, in Gaston Phoebus=
, Nature, as is sometimes=20

her wont, had chosen to reproduce exactly the original type. He was the Gas=
con noble of the=20

sixteenth century, with all his=20


_
within striking distance, his heavy paw went up, but at that moment the woo=
d pussy arched his=20

back and delivered his own best defense full in the bear's nose and eyes.  =
With a loud "ugh," and=20

a grunt and squeal of pain, Black Bruin retreated into the nearest thicket.=
  It seemed as though=20

liquid fire had been dashed in his eyes, and of all the obnoxious smells th=
at ever disgusted his=20

nostrils, this was the worst.  His eyes smarted and burned, and the more he=
 rubbed them the=20

worse they became.  He was nearly blinded and so had to go groping and stum=
bling through the=20

woods to the nearest brook, to which his wild instinct guided him in some m=
iraculous manner.=20

Here he plunged in his face up to his ears and was slightly relieved.  For =
an hour he repeated the=20

operation over and over, plunging his head under and keeping it there as lo=
ng as he could hold his=20

breath.  At last the burning, smarting fluid was partly washed from both ey=
es and nostrils, and=20

Black Bruin went upon his way a wiser and sorrier beast.  It was two or thr=
ee days before the=20

inflammation entirely left his eyes and his nostrils got back their old sur=
e power of discriminating=20

between the many scents of the forest.  He had learned his first lesson in =
and eccentric,=20

accomplished in all the daring or the graceful pursuits of man, yet nursed =
in the philosophy of our=20

times.  =E2=80=9CIt is presumption in my talking about such things,=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut might I venture to ask=20

what you may consider the true principles of art?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CARYAN =
principles,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus; =E2=80=9Cnot=20

merely the study of Nature, but of beautiful Nature; the art of design in a=
 country inhabited by a=20

first-rate race, and where the laws, the manners, the customs, are calculat=
ed to maintain the=20

health and beauty of a first-rate race. In a greater or less degree, these =
conditions obtained from=20

the age of Pericles to the age of Hadrian in pure Aryan communities, but Se=
mitism began then to=20

prevail, and ultimately triumphed. Semitism has destroyed art; it taught ma=
n to despise his own=20

body, and the essence of art is to honor the human frame.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CI am afraid I ought not to talk about=20

such things,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut, if by Semitism you mean r=
eligion, surely the Italian painters=20

inspired by Semitism did something.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CGreat things,=E2=80=

fter this, whenever=20

Black Bruin even scented a skunk, he kept at a discreet distance and conten=
ted himself with=20

chipmunks and mice.  One morning he surprised a fox eating a rabbit which i=
t had just caught in a=20

briar-patch, and made such a sudden rush Reformation, and swept all away. W=
hen Leo the Tenth=20

was pope, popery was pagan; popery is now Christian, and art is extinct.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI cannot enter into=20

such controversies,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CEvery day I feel more a=
nd more I am extremely ignorant.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDo=20

not regret it,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus. =E2=80=9CWhat you call ignorance =

in hot haste, leaving the rabbit for the bear.  In this way Black Bruin lea=
rned that rabbit was good=20

to eat, even as palatable as squirrel, and after that he hunted rabbits whe=
never opportunity=20

offered.  Sometimes he would find a gray rabbit's hole and with much labor =
dig the poor rabbit out.=20

More frequently he would watch at the mouth of a rabbit-burrow, where he ha=
d seen a rabbit enter,=20

until bunny reappeared, sticking his head out cautiously to reconnoitre, wh=
en one swift stroke of=20

the heavy paw bagged the game.  It was one day after having watched for sev=
eral hours at the=20

mouth of a rabbit-burrow, that Black Bruin discovered a queer creature, thr=
ee fatal; they are the=20

curse of the human race. Nine-tenths of existing books are nonsense, and th=
e clever books are=20

the refutation of that nonsense. The greatest misfortune that ever befell m=
an was the invention of=20

printing. Printing has destroyed education. Art is a great thing, and Scien=
ce is a great thing; but all=20

that art and science can reveal can be taught by man and by his attributes=
=E2=80=94his voice, his hand,=20

his eye. The essence of education is the education of the body. Beauty and =
health are the chief=20

sources of happiness. Men should live in the air; their exercises should be=
 regular, varied,=20

scientific. To render his body strong and supple is the=20


_
four times the size of a rabbit, walking leisurely along through the woods,=
 and went in hot pursuit.=20

By this time, the experience with the skunk had lost its old terror, and he=
 was again the curious,=20

keen hunter.  Whatever it was, the newcomer did not seem to be much afraid =
of him, and that was=20

strange.  Most of the wild creatures he knew fled at his first approach, an=
d it was with difficulty that=20

he got completely master the whole muscular system. What I admire in the or=
der to which you=20

belong is that they do live in the air; that they excel in athletic sports;=
 that they can only speak one=20

language; and that they never read. This is not a complete education, but i=
t is the highest=20

education since the Greek.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat you say I feel encouragi=
ng,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, repressing a smile,=20
