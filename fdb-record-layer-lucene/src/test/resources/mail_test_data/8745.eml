and the reasons are given why Europeans have been unable to engage in agric=
ulture with=20

success. The mineral products of the islands are enumerated. Commerce is, l=
ike agriculture, still=20

undeveloped; our author attributes this to the Acapulco trade, to the prohi=
bitory system pursued by=20

Spain and to the monopoly allowed to the Philippine Company, and criticises=
 Spain's policy toward=20

her colonies. He then describes the condition of Philippine commerce, with =
statistics of 1818; and=20

the difficulties under which it labors--especially the insecurity of proper=
ty and contracts, the=20

fraudulent dealings of the Chinese merchants; and the neglect of government=
 to prevent=20

smuggling or to make suitable provision for rexportation of goods--which ha=
ve prevented Manila=20

from being one of the great centers of Oriental trade.  The second part of =
these "Remarks" is=20

devoted to Manila; a description of the city, its fortifications (which our=
 writer considers very=20

inefficient on the side next to Pasig River), streets, public buildings, mo=
de of constructing houses,=20

and the public cemetery; and social conditions there, which are unfavorable=
 to morality and the=20

development of character. The author criticises the colonial policy of Spai=
n, and regards her=20

tenure of rule over Filipinas as precarious, especially as discontent and i=
deas of political freedom=20

are spreading among the Indians.  Of unusual interest and value is a memori=
al written (April 26,=20

1827) by Manuel Bernaldez Pizarro, on the "causes which antagonize the secu=
rity and progress of=20

the Filipinas Islands," and which bring about their backward condition, wit=
h the measures which he=20

judges desirable for their correction. As a high official in Filipinas duri=
ng seventeen years, his=20

opinions are of much importance, especially as he was evidently a clear-sig=
hted and upright=20

statesman, a keen observer, and a  There were professional thieves who ente=
red the morgues=20

and identified, with expressions of sorrow, their dear departed dead, stran=
gers never seen before,=20

in order that they might secure the valuables found on their persons. There=
 were others who=20

offered their services for the recovery of the dead, and who were placed up=
on the details sent out=20

for that purpose, and plundered many corpses before the arrival of Mann=E2=
=80=99s detectives pointed=20

them out as the worst of thieves and robbers.  Besides these there were sle=
ek scoundrels, too=20

base and black for respectability even in the pit, who approached weeping, =
orphaned, beautiful=20

young girls with alluring offers of jewelry and fine clothes and delightful=
 homes, in great cities.=20

Their object has no need to be stated.  It is pleasant to turn from these f=
ew ghoulish and degraded=20

human reptiles to the mighty army of noble men and women who succored Johns=
town.  The story=20

of the help rendered, how much, by whom, and in what ways can not be detail=
ed in this place. It=20

will be enough to give a brief and general statement, while for full partic=
ulars, even to the long list=20

of the dead, known and unknown, the reader must be referred to Dr. Beale=E2=
=80=99s most interesting=20

book.  The faults and evils of government have been conspicuous since man w=
as upon the earth.=20

The contemplation of these has turned some shallow-brained people into anar=
chists, who think the=20

ideal state of the race must be one in which there is no government at all.=
  There was no=20

government in Johnstown while the flood was sweeping it away. All human law=
s were then=20

suspended, for there was no human power that could enforce them. It is curi=
ous and instructive, in=20

a condition of complete anarchy, to note the spontaneous movements towards =
organized=20

government--movements simply evoked by the popular need. Government was int=
roduced into=20

Alma Hall almost=20


_
officials, still much under the sway of autocratic and regalistic notions--=
and was fertile in ideas and=20

projects for improving the condition of Filipinas. The memorial is methodic=
ally arranged in sections=20

relating to military affairs, Moro piracies, land-titles, Spanish vs. nativ=
e clerics, the residence of=20

foreigners in the islands, character of government officials, administratio=
n of justice, taxes and=20

revenue, commerce, agriculture, manufactures, etc.  On each of these subjec=
ts he presents a=20

concise statement of present conditions and tendencies, followed by his rec=
ommendations for=20

change, reform, or suppression. In the army, the principal difficulty lies =
in the corps of officers,=20

partly Peninsular and partly native or American, with Indian subalterns; th=
ese classes have almost=20

nothing in common, and the latter are dangerously near to the Indians, or a=
re spoiled by the=20

tendencies of the country. Provision should be made, therefore, for sending=
 officers from Spain to=20

fill all posts of command. Instead of enlarging the military force, a centr=
al location (afterward=20

indicated as Cavite) should be selected, and rendered day. Two hundred and =
sixty-four men,=20

women and children, from various directions clambering out of the debris, h=
ad been gathered=20

there. They were wretched enough already, but disorder would only add to th=
eir woes, and for the=20

sake of order, and to feel that the strongest and wisest were at the helm, =
they were ready to=20

submit themselves to command. Accordingly, a meeting was at once called on =
the stairway to=20

elect a director to control the whole building and one of the stories, and =
two subordinates to take=20

charge of the other two stories. Orders were at once issued that there shou=
ld be no lights, lest the=20

escaping natural gas should explode, and that all persons having spirituous=
 liquors should=20

surrender them to the directors. These orders were cheerfully obeyed.  As t=
his company was=20

wending its mournful way the next morning to Adam street, Dr. Beale saw a m=
an taking some=20

valuables, and ordered him to put them down. With this hint as to the capab=
ilities of bad men, he=20

sent a boy a little later to the nearest telegraph station with a message t=
o Governor Beaver to send=20

the military. The response came soon in the presence of the=20
