philodendron monstera asleep, and then----"  "Yes, and then if Jack and Nat hadn't come along you'd be sleeping yet," added Sam.  "'Sright," admitted Budge.  They helped him back to camp, and he was soon feeling better, but he registered a firm resolve not to go too near philodendron monstera asleep, and then----"  "Yes, and then if Jack and Nat hadn't come along you'd be sleeping yet," added Sam.  "'Sright," admitted Budge.  They helped him back to camp, and he was soon feeling better, but he registered a firm resolve not to go too near _
animals. But there's the tree where Budge ought to be. I s'pose he's asleep."  As they approached 

nearer the unpleasant odor became more pronounced. Then, as they topped a little mound, they 

looked down and saw their friend reclining on the ground near a dead cottonwood tree.  "Sure 

enough, he's asleep," remarked Jack. "Come on, we'll wake him up. Get close, and then we'll yell 

like wild Indians and scare him."  They crept softly closer to the outstretched Budge. He did not 

stir. Then they united their voices in a terrorizing yell.  But instead of Budge sitting up suddenly he 

remained in the same position, his gun by his side, and a couple of dead rabbits at his feet. 

"That's queer," remarked Jack. "He's certainly sleeping sound."  He tiptoed up to his chum, and 

bending over looked closely at him. He was struck by the paleness of his face and the fact that 

Budge did not seem to breathe.  "Nat!" called Jack quickly, "he's dead! He's fallen asleep and 

been killed by those poisonous gases!"  Nat ran up. It did seem as if Budge was dead.  "We must 

carry him away from here," said Jack sadly.  "I--I begin to feel rather faint myself," said Nat as he 

sat down on the ground.     CHAPTER XXII  AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER   Jack glanced at 

Nat. The lad was pale, and Jack himself began to feel the effect of the poisonous gas. But he 

made up his mind he would not give in.  "Brace up, Nat!" he cried. "We must get Budge out of 

here. Maybe he's only fainted. Brace up! It will only take us a minute, and then we'll get where 

there is better air."  "I will," said Nat faintly.  He stood up, and by a strong effort fought off the 

feeling of faintness. Then he and Jack reached down and took hold of Budge, lifting him by his 

head and feet. His gun was strapped over his shoulder.  "There's what did the mischief," said 

Jack, and he nodded toward a spring, about five feet in diameter, near which Budge had been 

sitting when he had been overcome.  The poor lad's body was limp, and it was hard to carry him, 

but Nat and Jack strained and staggered along. As they went on, the effect of the deadly gas 

became less, and soon they could breathe better.  "Do you--do you think he's dead?" faltered Nat. 

"I hope not," answered Jack, but his voice was serious. "It depends on how long he has breathed 

that gas. I heard Tanker Ike say he once saw a grizzly bear killed by it, so it must be pretty 

powerful."  "Have we got to carry him back to camp?"  "No, we'll take him out of the reach of the 

vapor, and then one of us can run back and get the medicine chest. I'll try some strong ammonia 

on home and regulate your conduct toward your parents.    Sixth Commandment  "Thou shalt not 

kill."  I used to say: "What is the use of taking up a law like this in an audience where, probably, 

there isn't a man who ever thought of, or ever will commit murder?" But as one gets on in years, 

he sees many a murder that is not outright killing. I need not kill a person to be a murderer. If I get 

so angry that I wish a man dead, I am a murderer in God's sight. God looks at the heart and says 

he that hateth his brother is a murderer.  First let us see what this commandment does not mean. 

It does not forbid the killing of animals for food and for other reasons. Millions of rams and lambs 

and turtle-doves must have been killed every year for sacrifices under the Mosaic system. Christ 

Himself ate of the Passover lamb, and we are told definitely of cases where He ate fish Himself 

and provided it for His disciples and the people to eat.  It does not forbid the killing of burglars, 

etc., in self-defence. Directly after the giving of the Ten Commandments, God laid down the 

ordinance that if a thief be found breaking in and be smitten that he die, it was pardonable. Did not 

Christ justify this idea of self-defence when He said: "If the goodman of the house had known in 

what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house 

to be broken up?"  It does not forbid capital punishment. God Himself set the death penalty upon 



violations of each of the first seven commandments, as well as for other crimes. God said to Noah 

after the deluge--"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed;" and the reason 

given is just as true to-day as it was then--"for in the image of God made He man."  What it does 

forbid is the wanton, intentional taking of human life under wrong motives and circumstances. Man 

is made in God's image. He is built for eternity. He is more than a mere animal. His life ought 

therefore to be held sacred. Once taken, it can never be restored. In heathen lands human life is 

no more sacred than the life of animals; even in Christian lands there are heartless and selfish 

men who hold it cheap; but God has invested it with a high value. An infidel philosopher of the 

eighteenth century said: "In the sight of God every event is alike important; and the life of a man is 

of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster." "Where is the crime," he asked, 

"of turning a few ounces of blood out of their channel?" Such language needs no answer.  THE 

VALUE OF A MAN.  Let me give you a passage from H. L.

him. That may revive him--if he isn't dead."  A little later they staggered with the limp body of 

Budge out on a clear place, where the fumes of the gas could not be noticed.  "I'll wait here with 

him until you run to camp," said Jack, and when Nat, who had recovered from his faintness, had 

started off, Jack chafed Budge's hands, and running to the river filled his cap with cold water, 

which he dashed into the face of the unconscious lad.  This treatment was effective in a measure, 

for Budge opened his eyes. Then he exclaimed:  "Don't--don't drown me!"  "Budge! Budge!" cried 

Jack. "Do you feel better?"  But the lad's eyes closed again, and Jack feared that it was but a 

momentary reviving. He chafed the lad's hands again, and tried to force some cold water from the 

river between his set teeth.  Then Nat came running back, bearing a medicine box, which Mr. 

Ranger had insisted that Jack take with him. Long Gun, Sam and Bony followed.  Jack took out a 

bottle of ammonia, and held it beneath the nose of Budge. The powerful liquid fumes made Budge 

gasp, and he struggled to sit up.  "Hi! quit!" he called. "Don't burn me!" For the ammonia stung 

him.  "Oh, he isn't dead!" cried Nat, much relieved.  "Pretty soon be all right," said Long Gun, who 

had been told what had happened. "Plenty much fresh air make um visited the Fiji Islands in 1844, 

and what do you suppose an infidel was worth there then? You could buy a man for a musket, or if 

you paid money, for seven dollars, and after you had bought him you could feed him, starve him, 

work him, whip him, or eat him--they generally ate them, unless they were so full of tobacco they 

could not stomach them! But if you go there to-day you could not buy a man for seven million 

dollars. There are no men for sale there now. What has made the difference in the price of 

humanity? The twelve hundred Christian chapels scattered over that Island tell the story. The 

people have learned to read that Book which says: 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things 

as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ'; and since they learned that lesson, no 

man is for sale there."  Men tell me that the world is getting so much better. We talk of our 

American civilization. We forget the alarming increase of crime in our midst. It is said that there is 

no civilized country on the globe where murder is so frequently committed and so seldom 

punished.  SUICIDE.  There is that other kind of murder that is increasing at an appalling rate 

among us--suicide. There have been infidels in all ages who have advocated it as a justifiable 

means of release from trial and difficulty; yet 


_
And he seemed to be right, for presently Budge sat up, opened his eyes, and began feeling in his 

pockets.  "What do you want?" asked Jack.  "Where'smygum?" was what Budge wanted to know, 

and his companions laughed.  "I guess you're all right when you can chew gum," spoke Jack. "But 

what made you go over by that sulphur spring?"  "I was shooting jack-rabbits," explained Budge, 

"and I thought that would be a good place. I condemned it as cowardly and unjustifiable under any 

conditions. No man has a right to take his own life from such motives any more than the life of 

another.  It has been pointed out that the Jewish race, the people of God, always counted length 

of days as a blessing. The Bible does not mention one single instance of a good man committing 

suicide. In the four thousand years of Old Testament history it records only four
