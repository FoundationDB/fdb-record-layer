dracaena marginata     as a hawk, an angel, a lotus-flower, a heron, a stor=

 of such     a progress was far from being satisfactory,   argues De Mirvil=

 The Occult Doctrine teaches that Karma waits at the  "Stay there," said Ar=
amis; "I shall return immediately."  The two friends went toward the shed. =
At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses.  "That is good =
to see," said Aramis. "There is a servant active and vigilant, not like tha=
t lazy fellow Bazin, who is no longer good for anything since he became con=
nected with the church. Follow us, Planchet; we shall continue our conversa=
tion to the end of the village."  They traversed the width of the village, =
talking of dracaena marginata     as a hawk, an angel, a lotus-flower, a he=
ron, a stork, a swallow,     a serpent, and a crocodile: one sees that the =
consolation of such     a progress was far from being satisfactory,   argue=
s De Mirville, in his work on the Satanic character of the Gods of Egypt.(4=
58) Again, a simple suggestion may throw on this a great light. Are the Ori=
entalists quite sure they have read correctly the "metempsychosis during 3,=
000 years"? The Occult Doctrine teaches that Karma waits at the  "Stay ther=
e," said Aramis; "I shall return immediately."  The two friends went toward=
 the shed. At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses.  "Th=
at is good to see," said Aramis. "There is a servant active and vigilant, n=
ot like that lazy fellow Bazin, who is no longer good for anything since he=
 became connected with the church. Follow us, Planchet; we shall continue o=
ur conversation to the end of the village."  They traversed the width of th=
e village, talking of _
meaning. The Indian Yogi who, in an _exoteric_ work, is invited to drink a =
certain intoxicating=20

liquor till he loses his senses, was also regarded as a drunkard representi=
ng his sect and class,=20

until it was found that the Esoteric sense of that "spirit" was quite diffe=
rent: that it meant divine=20

light, and stood for the ambrosia of Secret Wisdom. The symbols of the dove=
 and the lamb which=20

abound now in Eastern and Western Christian Churches may also be exhumed lo=
ng ages hence,=20

and speculated upon as objects of present-day worship. And then some "Occid=
entalist" in the=20

forthcoming ages of high Asiatic civilization and learning, may write karmi=
cally upon the same as=20

follows: "The ignorant and superstitious Gnostics and Agnostics of the sect=
s of 'Pope' and 'Calvin'=20

(the two monster Gods of the Dynamite-Christian period) adored a pigeon and=
 a sheep!" There will=20

be portable hand-fetishes in all and every age for the satisfaction and rev=
erence of the rabble, and=20

the Gods of one race will always be degraded valleys; he is lord of the hil=
l and the plain and is now=20

carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon!"  "Go=
od," said D'Artagnan to=20

himself. "That's what I wanted to know. Porthos is in Picardy."  Then aloud=
:  "And he has taken his=20

ancient name of Vallon?"  "To which he adds that of Bracieux, an estate whi=
ch has been a barony,=20

by my troth."  "So that Porthos will be a baron."  "I don't doubt it. The '=
Baroness Porthos' will sound=20

particularly charming."  And the two friends began to laugh.  "So," D'Artag=
nan resumed, "you will=20

not become a partisan of Mazarin's?"  "Nor you of the Prince de Conde?"  "N=
o, let us belong to no=20

party, but remain friends; let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists."  =
"Adieu, then." And=20

D'Artagnan poured out a glass of wine.  "To old times," he said.  "Yes," re=
turned Aramis.=20

"Unhappily, those times are past."  "Nonsense! They will return," said D'Ar=
tagnan. "At all events, if=20

you want me, remember the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette."  "And I=
=20

the depths of Lethe, and Karma shall reach Europe as it has Asia and her re=
ligions.  Nevertheless,=20

This grand and dignified language [in the _Book of the Dead_],     these pi=
ctures full of majesty,=20

this orthodoxy of the whole     evidently proving a very precise doctrine c=
oncerning the=20

immortality of the soul and its personal survival,   as shown by De Rouge a=
nd the Abbe Van Drival,=20

have charmed some Orientalists. The psychostasy (or judgment of the Soul) i=
s certainly a whole=20

poem to him who can read it eight at night come by the door. From eight in =
the evening until six in=20

the morning come in by the window."  "Adieu, dear friend."  "Oh, I can't le=
t you go so! I will go with=20

you." And he took his sword and cloak.  "He wants to be sure that I go away=
," said D'Artagnan to=20

himself.  Aramis whistled for Bazin, but Bazin was asleep in the ante-chamb=
er, and Aramis was=20

obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him.  Bazin stretched his arms, ru=
bbed his eyes, and=20

tried to go to sleep again.  "Come, come, sleepy head; quick,=20

therein. In that picture we see Osiris, the horned, with his sceptre hooked=
 at the end--the original=20

of the pastoral bishop's crook or crosier--the Soul hovering above, encoura=
ged by Tmei, daughter=20

of the Sun of Righteousness and Goddess of Mercy and Justice; Horus and Anu=
bis, weighing the=20

deeds of the soul. One of these papyri shows the Soul found guilty of glutt=
ony sentenced to be re-

born on earth as a hog; forthwith comes the learned conclusion of an Orient=
alist, "This is an=20

indisputable proof of belief in _metempsychosis_, of transmigration _into a=
nimals_," etc.=20

Perchance the Occult law of Karma might  "But," said Bazin, yawning portent=
ously, "the ladder is=20

still at the window."  "The other one, the gardener's. Didn't you see that =
Monsieur d'Artagnan=20

mounted with difficulty? It will be even more difficult to descend."  D'Art=
agnan was about to assure=20

Aramis that he could descend easily, when an idea came into his head which =
silenced him.  Bazin=20

uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder. Presently a go=
od, solid, wooden ladder=20

was placed against the window.  "Now then," said D'Artagnan, "this is somet=
hing like; this is a=20

means of communication. A woman could go up a ladder like that."  Aramis's=
=20


_
may, for all our Orientalists know, refer to the physiological vice in stor=
e for the Soul when re-

incarnated--a vice that will lead that personality into a thousand and one =
scrapes and=20

misadventures.       Tortures to begin with, then metempsychosis bottom of =
his heart, but=20

D'Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity. B=
esides, at that moment=20

he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent. In a=
 moment he was on the=20

ground. Bazin remained at the=20
