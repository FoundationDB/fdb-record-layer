of the _Metamorphoses_ (before 1305) by a Franciscan monk, Chretien Legouai=

Maure, with appended interpretations, scientific, historical, moral, or rel=

fables. Ovid's _Art of Love_, of which more than one rendering was made, ai=
ded in the formation=20

or development of the mediaeval theory of love and the amorous casuistry fo=
unded upon that=20

theory.   IV ROMANCES OF LOVE AND COURTESY  Under the general title of the =
_Epopee=20

courtoise_--the Epopee of Courtesy--may be grouped those romances which are=
 either works of=20

pure imagination or of uncertain origin, or which lead us back to Byzantine=
 or to Celtic sources.=20

They include some of the most beautiful and original poems of the Middle Ag=
es. Appearing first=20

about the opening of the twelfth century, later in date than the early _cha=
nsons de geste_, and=20

contemporary with the courtly lyric poetry of love, they exhibit the chival=
ric spirit in a refined and=20

graceful aspect; their marvels are not gross wonders, but often surprises o=
f beauty; they are bright=20

in colour, and varied in the play of life; the passions which they interpre=
t, and especially the=20

passion of love, are felt with an exquisite delicacy and a knowledge of the=
 workings of the heart.=20

They move lightly in their rhymed or assonanced verse; even when they passe=
d into the form of=20

prose they retained something of their charm. Breton harpers wandering thro=
ugh France and=20

England made Celtic themes known through their _lais_; the fame of King Art=
hur was spread=20

abroad by these singers and by the _History_ of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Frenc=
h poets welcomed=20

the new matter of romance, infused into it their own chivalric spirit, made=
 it a receptacle for their=20

ideals of gallantry, courtesy, honour, grace, and added their own beautiful=
 inventions. With the=20

story of King Arthur was connected that of the sacred vessel--the graal--in=
 which Joseph of=20

Arimathea at the cross had received the Saviour's blood. And thus the rude =
Breton _lais_ were=20

elevated not only to a chivalric but to a religious purpose.  The romances =
of Tristan may certainly=20

be named as of Celtic origin. About 1150 an Anglo-Norman poet, BEROUL, brou=
ght together the=20

scattered narrative of his adventures in a romance, of which a large fragme=
nt remains. The secret=20

loves of Tristan and Iseut, their woodland wanderings, their dangers and es=
capes, are related with=20

fine imaginative sympathy; but in this version of the tale the fatal love-p=
hiltre operates only for a=20

period of three years; Iseut, with Tristan's consent, returns to her husban=
d, King Marc; and then a=20

second passion is born in their hearts, a passion which is the offspring no=
t of magic but of natural=20

attraction, and at a critical moment of peril the fragment closes. About tw=
enty years later (1170)=20

the tale was again sung by an Anglo-Norman named THOMAS. Here--again in a f=
ragment--we=20

read of Tristan's marriage, a marriage only in name, to the white-handed Is=
eut of Brittany, his=20

fidelity of heart to his one first love, his mortal wound and deep desire t=
o see the Queen of=20

Cornwall, the device of the white or black sails to announce the result of =
his entreaty that she=20

should come, his deception, and the death of his true love upon her lover's=
 corpse. Early in the=20

thirteenth century was composed a long prose romance, often rehandled and e=
xpanded, upon the=20

same subject, in which Iseut and Tristan meet at the last moment and die in=
 a close embrace.  _Le=20

Chevrefeuille_ (The Honeysuckle), one of several _lais_ by a twelfth-centur=
y poetess, MARIE,=20

living in England, but a native of France, tells gracefully of an assignati=
on of Tristan and Iseut, their=20

meeting in the forest, and their sorrowful farewell. Marie de France wrote =
with an exquisite sense=20

of the generosities and delicacy of the heart, and with a skill in narrativ=
e construction which was=20

rare among the poets of her time. In _Les Deux Amants_, the manly pride of =
passion, which in a=20

trial of strength declines the adventitious aid of a reviving potion, is re=
warded by the union in death=20



of the lover and his beloved. In _Yonec_ and in _Lanval_ tales of love and =
chivalry are made=20

beautiful by lore of fairyland, in which the element of wonder is subdued t=
o beauty. But the most=20

admirable poem by Marie de France is unquestionably her _Eliduc_. The Breto=
n knight Eliduc is=20

passionately loved by Guilliadon, the only daughter of the old King of Exet=
er, on whose behalf he=20

had waged battle. Her tokens of affection, girdle=20


_
though her passion is returned, he has left in Brittany, unknown to Guillia=
don, a faithful wife. Very=20

beautiful is the self-transcending love of the wife, who restores her rival=
 from seeming death, and=20

herself retires into a convent. The lovers are wedded, and live in charity =
to the poor, but with a=20

trouble at the heart for the wrong that they have done. In the end they par=
t; Eliduc embraces the=20

religious life, and the two loving women are united as sisters in the same =
abbey.  Wace, in his=20

romance of the _Brut_ (1155), which renders into verse the _Historia_ of Ge=
offrey of Monmouth,=20

makes the earliest mention of the Round Table. Whether the Arthurian legend=
s be of Celtic or of=20

French origin--and the former seems probable--the French romances of King A=
rthur owe but the=20

crude material to Celtic sources; they may be said to begin with CHRETIEN D=
E TROYES, whose=20

lost poem on Tristan was composed about 1160. Between that date and 1175 he=
 wrote his _Erec=20

et Enide_ (a tale known to us through Tennyson's idyll of Geraint and Enid,=
 derived from the=20

Welsh _Mabinogion_), _Cliges_, _Le Chevalier de la Charrette_, _Le Chevalie=
r au Lion_, and=20

_Perceval_. In _Cliges_ the maidenhood of his beloved Fenice, wedded in for=
m to the Emperor of=20

Constantinople, is guarded by a magic potion; like Romeo's Juliet, she slee=
ps in apparent death,=20

but, happier than Juliet, she recovers from her trance to fly with her love=
r to the court of Arthur.=20

The _Chevalier de la Charrette_, at first unknown by name, is discovered to=
 be Lancelot, who,=20

losing his horse, has condescended, in=20


_
disregard of the conventions of knighthood, to seat himself in a cart which=
 a dwarf is leading. After=20

gallant adventures on the Queen's behalf, her indignant resentment of his u=
nknightly conduct,=20

estrangement, and rumours of death, he is at length restored to her favour.=
[6] While _Perceval_=20

was still unfinished, Chretien de Troyes died. It was continued by other po=
ets, and through this=20

romance the quest of the holy graal became a portion of the Arthurian cycle=
. A _Perceval_ by=20

ROBERT DE BORON, who wrote in the early part of the thirteenth century, has=
 been lost; but a=20

prose redaction of the romance exists, which closes with the death of King =
Arthur. The great=20

_Lancelot_ in=20
