A crowd of strange thoughts passed through his mind. Are these Englishmen c=
owards? He drew=20

himself up more stiffly than before, as he declined the offer.  "Have you b=
reakfasted?" said his=20

hospitable lordship, ignoring the gesture.  "Lord Spunyarn," replied the Fr=
enchman, "I come to you=20

this morning purely as the emissary of my insulted friend; not to accept of=
 your kindness, or to=20

trespass on your hospitality."  "Oh, of course I understand that; but you s=
ee we English don't fight=20

duels as a rule. Of course I should be sorry to balk you, but can't it be a=
rranged?"  "Lord=20

Spunyarn, you are aware that my friend was struck. In my country, no gentle=
man receives a blow=20

without avenging it. Least of all a them back. =E2=80=9CWe will return,=E2=
=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cto our friends immediately,=20

but I want to say one word to you both.=E2=80=9D  He made them sit down. =
=E2=80=9CI am a little restless,=E2=80=9D he said,=20

and stood before the fire. =E2=80=9CSomething interesting has happened; not=

Do not pitch your expectations too high=E2=80=94but still of importance, an=

much interested.  =E2=80=9CAnd what is he like?=E2=80=9D inquired the monsi=
gnore.  =E2=80=9CAll that one could wish.=20

Extremely good-looking, highly bred, and most ingenuous; a considerable int=
elligence, and not=20

untrained; but the most absolutely unaffected person I ever=20

journalist or a diplomate. My friend Monsieur Barbiche was one, and is the =
other. In speaking of=20

arrangement, milor, I would suggest that we are wasting time."  "But I don'=
t quite see that,"=20

persisted Spunyarn, strong in his idea that the man who fights a duel is a =
fool. "You see there was=20

a lady in the matter, and your friend insulted her. Why man, he actually to=
uched her, I saw him do=20

it."  "Milor, ladies who go to masked balls  =E2=80=9CAh! if he had been tr=
