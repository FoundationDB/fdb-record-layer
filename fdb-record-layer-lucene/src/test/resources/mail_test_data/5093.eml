  But it was only for a=20

second.  His strong nerves soon restored him, and he stooped and picked up =
the baby, although=20

he was so blinded with glad tears that he had to grope for the precious bun=
dle.  What a miracle it=20

was, he thought; only the watchful care of a special Providence could have =
steadied his hand for=20

that desperate shot.  The more he considered, the more miraculous it seemed=
, and with a heart=20

welling up with praise and gratitude, he silently thanked God for the deliv=
erance, then woke the=20

leafless forest with a glad, "Halloo."  This was intended for the old hound=
, and she at once=20

responded with a quick succession of joyous barks.  The man had been a litt=
le uncertain of the=20

direction home, as he had followed the trail feverishly, but the dog's gree=
ting at once set him right.=20

Shielding the baby in his arms, and picking out as good footing as he could=
 in the uncertain light,=20

he made all haste back to his faithful canine, whose whines and barks guide=
d him from the House=20

of Commons.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSo do I,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with a sigh;=
 =E2=80=9Cbut I have come into every thing ready-made. I=20

begin to think it very unfortunate.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat are you going t=
o do with yourself to-day? If you be=20

disengaged, I vote we dine together at White=E2=80=99s, and then we will go=
 down to the House. I will take=20

you to the smoking-room and introduce you to Bright, and we will trot him o=
ut on primogeniture.=E2=80=9D=20

At this moment the servant brought Lothair two letters: one was an epistle =
from Father Coleman,=20

meeting Lothair=E2=80=99s objections to becoming a patron of the Roman Cath=
olic Bazaar, in a very=20

unctuous and exhaustive manner; and the other from his stud-groom at Oxford=
, detailing some of=20

those disagreeable things which will happen with absent masters who will no=
t answer letters.=20

Lothair loved his stable, and felt particularly anxious to avoid the threat=
ened visit of Father=20

Coleman on the morrow. His decision was rapid. =E2=80=9CI must go down, thi=
s afternoon to Oxford, my=20

dear fellow. My stable is in confusion. I shall positively return to-morrow=
, and I will=20

"It's all right, Hecla, old girl, I've got him," he cried as soon as he cam=
e within speaking distance of=20

the dog.  The father's joy was so great that he had to impart it to some on=
e.  He lost no time in=20

untying the dog and with her as a guide they were able to follow the homewa=
rd trail through the=20

darkest places in safety. He must make all possible haste, for he remembere=
d the look of mute=20

agony in his wife's eyes, as she stood at the door watching his departure. =
 "Home, home, Hecla!"=20

he cried, each time they plunged into deeper gloom than usual.  "We must hu=
rry."  But the good=20

dog needed no urging.  Out and in, unerringly, she led him, until the open =
pasture lot was reached.=20

Then with a glad bark she bounded over the stone wall and House of Commons =

ree miles from Oxford. They were a=20

rather considerable establishment, in which he had taken much interest, and=
, having always=20

intended to return to Oxford in the early part of the year, although he had=
 occasionally sent for a=20

hack or two to London, his stud had been generally maintained.  The morning=
 after his arrival, he=20

rode over to the stables, where he had ordered his drag to be ready. About =
a quarter of a mile=20

before he reached his place of destination, he observed at some little dist=
ance a crowd in the road,=20

and, hastening on, perceived as he drew nearer a number of men clustered ro=
und a dismantled=20

vehicle, and vainly endeavoring to=20

 and anything to relieve=20

the suspense at home was desirable.  While the two had been floundering thr=
ough the deep=20

woods upon their seemingly hopeless quest, the grief-stricken mother had pa=
ced the kitchen floor,=20

wringing her hands and moaning.  Occasionally, as the moments dragged slowl=
y by, she would go=20

to the piazza and listen until it seemed that her ear-drums would burst wit=
h the intensity of her=20

effort, but only the moaning of the wind, and the usual night sounds came t=
o her ears.  At last, in=20

aside and held by a boy. Somewhat apart stood a lady alone. Lothair immedia=
tely dismounted and=20

approached her, saying, =E2=80=9CI fear you are in trouble, madam. Perhaps =
I may be of service?=E2=80=9D  The=20

lady was rather tall, and of a singularly distinguished presence. Her air a=
nd her costume alike=20

intimated high breeding and fashion. She seemed quite serene amid the tumul=
t and confusion,=20

and apparently the recent danger. As Lothair spoke, she turned her head to =
him, which had been=20

at first a little averted, and he beheld a striking countenance, but one wh=
