dracaena marginata could feel fear, and that in Caesar, too, fear was mean. Dr Mommsen throws himself heartily into Caesar's antipathy, and can scarcely speak of Cato without something like loss of temper. The least uncivil thing which he says of him, is that he was a Don Quixote, with dracaena marginata could feel fear, and that in Caesar, too, fear was mean. Dr Mommsen throws himself heartily into Caesar's antipathy, and can scarcely speak of Cato without something like loss of temper. The least uncivil thing which he says of him, is that he was a Don Quixote, with _
horn of his saddle, and vanish in a cloud of dust, while Struthers was turning Casa Grande into a 

faro-hall and my two kiddies were busy holding up the Elk Crossing stage-coach.  But life, alas, 

isn't so dramatic as we dream it. It cross-hobbles us and hog-ties us and leaves us afraid of our 

own wilted impulses. I have a terror of failure. And it's plain enough I have only one mission on 

God's green footstool. I'm a home-maker, and nothing more. I'm a home-maker confronted by the 

last chance to make good at my one and only calling. And whatever it costs, I'm going to make my 

husband recognize me as a patient and long-suffering Penelope....  But enough of the rue! To-

morrow I'm going snow-shoeing with Peter. I'm praying that the weather will be propitious. I want 

one of our sparkling-burgundy days with the sun shining bright and a nip in the air like a stiletto 

buried in rose leaves. For it may be the last time in all my life I unlimited command of men and 

money, are the common dreams of every Nebuchadnezzar. What we know if we know anything of 

his intentions is that he was about to set out on a campaign against the Parthians in whose plains 

this prototype of Napoleon might perhaps have found a torrid Moscow. No great advance of 

humanity can take place without a great moral effort excited by higher moral desires. The masters 

of the legions can only set in action by their fiat material forces. Even these they often misdirect; 

but if the empire could have given every man Nero's golden house the inhabitants might still have 

been as unhappy as Nero.  It is not doubtful that Caesar was a type of the sensuality of his age. 

His worshippers even feel it necessary to gird at characters deficient in sensual passion with a 

friskiness which is a little amusing when you connect it with the spectacles and the blameless life 

of a learned professor. So gifted a nature

Ketley. The page is going to be turned over, the candle snuffed out, and the singing birds of my 

freedom silenced. I have met my Rubicon, and it must be crossed. But last night, for the first time 

in a month, I plastered enough cold cream on my nose to make me look like a buttered muffin, and 

rubbed enough almond-oil meal on my arms to make them look like a miller's. And I've been 

asking myself if I'm the sedate old lady life has been trying to make me. There are certain Pacific 

Islands, Gershom tells me, where the climate is so stable that the matter of weather is never even 

mentioned, where the people who bathe in that eternal calm are never conscious of the conditions 

surrounding them. That's the penalty, I suppose, that humanity pays for constancy. There are no 

lapses to record, no deviations to be accounted for, no tempests to send us tingling into the 

shelters of wonder. And I can't yet be quite sure whether this rebellious old heart of mine wants to 

be a vice, it is true, but a sensualist could hardly be a pure and noble organ of humanity. In this I 

have the Positivists with me. Even in Caesar's lifetime the world had a taste of the vicissitudes of 

empire while he was revelling in the palace of Cleopatra and leaving affairs to Antony and 

Dolabella. Perhaps the satiety of the voluptuary had something to do with the recklessness with 

which at the last he neglected to guard his life. He was the greatest patron of gladiatorial shows 

and signalized his accession to power by magnificent scenes of carnage in the arena--a strange 

dawn for the day of a new civilization. Must we not a little doubt the consistency of his policy and 

even his insight when we find him after all this enacting sumptuary laws?  Still Caesar was a very 

great man and he played a dazzling part, as all men do who come just at the fall of an old system, 

when society is as clay in the hands of the potter, and found a new system in its place, while the 


_
_Monday the Twenty-Seventh_   Peter and I have had our tramp in the snow. It wasn't a sunny 

day, as I had hoped. It was one of those intensely cold northern days without wind or sun, one of 

those misted days which Balzac somewhere describes as a beautiful woman born blind. It was 

fifty-three below zero when we left the house, with the smoke going up in the gray air as straight 

and undisturbed as a pine-tree and the drifts crunching like dry charcoal under our snow-shoes. 

We were woolened and mittened and capped and furred up to the eyes, however, and I was 

warmer than I've been many a time on Boston Common in March, even though we did look like a 

couple of deep-sea divers and steamed like fire-engines when we breathed.  We tramped until we 

were tired, swung back to Casa Grande, and Peter came in for a cup of tea and then trudged off to 

Alabama Ranch again. And that was the lee and the long of it, as the Irish say. What did we talk 

about? Heaven knows what we didn't talk about! Peter told me about a rancher named Bidwell, 

north of The Crossing, being found frozen to death in a snow-drift, frozen stiff, with the horse still 

standing and the rider still sitting upright in the saddle. He said there was a lot of rot talked about 

the great clean outdoors. The sentimentalists found that they naturally felt a bit niftier in fresh air, 

but the great outdoors, according to Peter, is an arena of endless murder and rapine and and 

industry, and of restoring the shattered allegiance of a people to its institutions, descends upon 

unlaurelled heads. But that the men of his time were bound to recognise in him a Messiah, to use 

the phrase of the Emperor of the French, and that those who opposed him were Jews crucifying 

their Saviour, is an impression which I venture to think will in time subside. No golden scales were 

hung out in heaven to shew the republicans that the balance of Divine will had turned, and that 

their duty was submission. "Momentumque fuit mutatus Curio rerum--" The only sign vouchsafed 

to them was the conversion of an unprincipled debauchee.  They have, therefore, a fair claim to be 

judged each upon the merits of his case, and not in the lump as enemies of the human race; and 

to judge them fairly is a good exercise in historical morality. The three principal names in the party 

are those of Cato, Cicero, and Marcus Brutus. Pompey, though the nominal chief of the 

republicans, may rather, as Dr Mommsen truly says, be called the first military monarch of Rome. 

There is a vigorous portrait of him, from the republican point of view, by Lucan, who, though 

detestable as an epic poet, sometimes in his political passages, and especially in his characters, 

shews himself the countryman of Tacitus. Pompey is there described with truth as combining the 

desire of supreme power with a lingering respect for the constitution. The great aristocrat 


_
or prairie under the sun somewhere has its stains of blood and its record of cruelty. We talked 

about Susie and the negative phrasing of the ten moral laws and the Horned Dinosaur from Sand 

Hill Creek (whose bones Peter reckoned to be at least three million years old) and the marriage 

customs of the Innuits. And we talked about Matzenauer and Kreisler and the best cure for 

chilblains and about Gershom and Poppsy and Dinkie--but most of all about Dinkie.  Peter asked 

me if I'd seen Dinkie's school essays on _The Flag_ and _The life, and his household as 

uncorrupted by the fortunes of its lord--the last relics of the control imposed by the spirit of the 

republic on private luxury, which was soon to be released by the Empire from all restraint and 

carried to the most revolting height.  Marcus Cato was the one man whom, living and dead, 

Caesar evidently dreaded. The Dictator even assailed his memory in a brace of pamphlets entitled 

Anti-Cato, of the quality of which we have one or two specimens, in Plutarch, from which we 

should infer that they were
