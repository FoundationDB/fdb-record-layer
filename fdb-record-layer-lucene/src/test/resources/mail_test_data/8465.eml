For this abuse there is, in our estimation, a remedy however     theoretica=
l and visionary it may=20

appear, and that is concert of     action and co-operation among factorymen=
. Men in all branches=20

of     business, nowadays, associate with each other, and form     themselv=
es into bodies for the=20

purpose of closer union and     mutual protection, and when this is done fo=
r the general good,     as=20

well as individual advancement, the purpose is laudable and     universally=
 successful.      We=20

know of no business in which the necessity of combination is     so great a=
s that of cheese-making,=20

and, what, let me ask, could     be more desirable and praiseworthy than an=

consumption.      We have an idea that such an association might be success=
fully     formed, and=20

that, when once in effectual operation, it might ask     the legislative bo=
dy of its country to enact a=20

law, entitled "An     Act for the suppression of swill milk, and for the ge=
neral good     of mankind," in=20

which it should be provided, among other things,     that in every case whe=

factory on     account of having had his milk rejected for cause traceable =
to     his negligence, that=20

in all such cases, the factory or factory     company knowingly receiving t=
he milk of such rejected=20

party,     shall be liable to some appropriate penalty.      The extreme se=
nsitiveness of milk in the=20

absorption of taint     from the atmosphere, or any substance with which it=
 comes in     contact,=20

ought to be thoroughly understood by all persons     engaged in handling it=

Vegetation has put forth more=20

to appearance in three days past than in all the spring before. Nature seem=

May has been more=20

that the month of April,=20

old style, was never known to terminate without producing apple-blossoms, h=
as by no means been=20

verified this year, they being now (June 1st.) in full flower. The snow upo=

Mrs. Thomas Cuddebach, in     whose family there have been several typhoid =
cases, holding that=20

the milk conveyed the disease germs. Nearly all of the parties     now sick=
 had used milk from the=20

farm."      "A dairyman from Dundee has been apprehended and fined for     =
allowing his wife and=20

child     suffering from scarlet fever. No less than nineteen cases of     =
fever, four of which resulted=20
