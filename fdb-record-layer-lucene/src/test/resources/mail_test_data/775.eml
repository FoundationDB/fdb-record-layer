bullock-cart! He is attractive not only to the ears of men, but also to their eyes. Thank heaven! I am 

safe.  _Charudatta._ [_Enters the bullock-cart and discovers Aryaka._] Who then is this?      As 

trunk of elephant his arms are long,     His chest is full, his shoulders broad and strong,       His 

great eyes restless-red;[71]     Why should this man be thus enforced to fight--     So noble he--

with such ignoble plight,       His foot to fetters wed?                                   5  P. 180.14]  Who are 

you, sir?  _Aryaka._ I am one who seeks your protection, Aryaka, by birth a herdsman. 

_Charudatta._ Are you he whom King Palaka took from the hamlet where he lived and thrust into 

prison?  _Aryaka._ The same.  _Charudatta._      'T is fate that brings you to my sight;     May I be 

reft of heaven's light,     Ere I desert you in your hapless plight.                     6  [_Aryaka manifests 

his joy._]  _Charudatta._ Vardhamanaka, remove the fetters from his foot.  _Vardhamanaka._ Yes, 

sir. [_He does so._] Master, the fetters are removed.  _Aryaka._ But you have bound me with yet 

stronger fetters of love.  _Maitreya._ Now you may put on the fetters yourself. He is free anyway. 

And it 's time for us to be going.  _Charudatta._ close. _Saint Genest_ (1645), which is derived, 

but in no servile fashion, from Lope de Vega, recalls _Polyeucte_; an actor of the time of 

Diocletian, in performing the part of a Christian martyr, is penetrated by the heroic passion which 

he represents, confesses his faith, and receives its crown in martyrdom. The tragi-comedy _Don 

Bernard de Cabrere_ and the tragedy _Venceslas_ of the following year exhibit the romantic and 

passionate sides of Rotrou's genius. The intemperate yet noble Ladislas has rashly and in error 

slain his brother; he is condemned to death by his father Venceslas, King of Poland, and he 

accepts his doom. The situation is such as Corneille might have imagined; but Rotrou's young 

hero in the end is pardoned and receives the kingdom. If their careless construction and unequal 

style in general forbade the dramas of Rotrou to hold the stage, they remained as a store from 

which greater artists than he could draw their material. His death was noble: the plague having 

broken out at Dreux, he hastened from Paris to the stricken town, disregarding all affectionate 

warnings, there to perform his duty as a magistrate; within a few days the inhabitants followed 

Rotrou's coffin to the parish church.  THOMAS CORNEILLE, the faithful and tender brother of "le 

grand Corneille," and his successor in the Academy, belongs to

_Aryaka._ Charudatta, my friend, I entered your cart somewhat unceremoniously. I beg your 

pardon.  _Charudatta._ I feel honored that you should use no ceremony with me.  _Aryaka._ If you 

permit it, I now desire to go.  _Charudatta._ Go in peace.  _Aryaka._ Thank you. I will alight from 

the cart.  _Charudatta._ No, my friend. The fetters have but this moment been removed, and you 

will find walking difficult. In this spot where men seek pleasure, a bullock-cart will excite no 

suspicion. Continue your journey then in the cart.  [110.4. S.  _Aryaka._  I thank you, sir. 

_Charud._  Seek now thy kinsmen. Happiness be thine!  _Aryaka._  Ah, I have found thee, 

blessed kinsman mine!  _Charud._  Remember me, when thou hast cause to speak.  _Aryaka._ 

Thy name, and not mine own, my words shall seek.  _Charud._  May the immortal gods protect thy 

ways!  _Aryaka._  Thou didst protect me, in most perilous days.  _Charud._  Nay, it was fate that 

sweet protection lent.  _Aryaka._  But thou wast chosen as fate's instrument.            7

_Aryaka._ generation. He was born in 1625, and did not die until near the close of the first decade 

of the eighteenth century. As an industrious playwright he imitated his brother's manner, and 

reproduced his situations with a feebler hand. Many of his dramas are of Spanish origin, comic 

imbroglios, tragic extravagances; they rather diverted dramatic art from its true way than aided its 

advance. Perhaps for this reason they were the more popular. His _Timocrate_ (1656), drawn 

from the romance of _Cleopatre_, and itself a romance written for the stage, had a success rarely 

equalled during the century. The hero is at once the enemy and the lover of the Queen of Argos; 

under one name he besieges her, under another he repels his own attack; he is hated and adored, 

the conquered and the conqueror. The languors of conventional love and the plaintive accents of 

conventional grief suited the powers of the younger Corneille. His _Ariane_ (1672) presents a 

heroine, Ariadne, abandoned by Theseus, who reminds us of one of Racine's women, drawn with 

less certain lines and fainter colours. In _Le Comte d'Essex_ history is transformed to a romance.

_Charud._      From royal wrath I now have much to fear;     It were unwise for me to linger here. 

Then throw the fetters in the well; for spies     Serve to their king as keen, far-seeing eyes.

have not seen whom I love best,     My left eye twitches; and as an Academician became the 

occasion for a just and eloquent tribute to the genius of his brother uttered by Racine, when the 

bitterness of rivalry was forgotten and the offences of Racine's earlier years were nobly repaired. 

CHAPTER IV SOCIETY AND PUBLIC LIFE IN LETTERS   Before noticing the theories of classical 

poetry in the writings of its master critic, Boileau, we

became each a master in literary craft, as it were, by an irresistible instinct. Memoirs, maxims, 

epistolary correspondence, the novel, in their hands took a distinguished place in the hierarchy of 

literary art.  FRANCOIS VI., DUC DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, Prince de Marsillac, was born in 

1613, of one of the greatest families of France. His life is divided into two periods--one of
