September, 1898, President McKinley appointed a _
brown hair, rather extraordinary black eyes and an olive skin.  The young s=
inger, an American of=20

Italian ancestry, had first fought among the snow-clad hills of Italy. Woun=
ded, he had afterwards=20

returned to the United States, where a great career as a singer was opening=
 before him. Then the=20

desire to fight in France had driven him to surrender his art and to serve =
as a volunteer in the=20

marine corps.  A moment later the two men disappeared within their tents. A=
n automobile with the=20

Red Cross insignia soon after drove up before one of the entrances to the c=
amp where a sentry=20

stood guard.  Stepping out of it first came a woman, youthful of face and f=
orm, but whose hair was=20

nearly white, her eyes a deep blue with dark lashes, and her color a bright=
 crimson from her drive=20

through the winter air.  Following her immediately was a young girl, scarce=
ly eighteen years old,=20

who was small and fair with pale blonde hair and surprisingly dark brown ey=
es. Both the woman=20

and girl were wearing heavy fur coats and small hats fitting close down ove=
r their hair.  The older=20

woman was Mrs. David Clark, the wife of the chief surgeon of the Red Cross =
hospital which was=20

situated a few miles from the present camp. Before her marriage which had t=
aken place only a=20

little more than six months before, she had been Sonya Valesky.  The young =
girl was her ward,=20

Bianca Zoli.  "I declare, Sonya, I don't see how you always manage to get a=
head of the rest of us=20

considering your advanced years," another girl exclaimed, jumping out of th=
e car and slipping on=20

the icy ground until her older Shafter=E2=80=99s command was by this time i=
n a serious state of health and=20

anxious to return home. Malarial fevers had so weakened the men that an epi=
demic of yellow-

fever, which had appeared sporadically throughout the command, was greatly =
feared. The=20

situation was desperate, and the War Department apparently deaf to all repr=
esentations of the=20

case. Under these circumstances the division and brigade commanders and the=
 surgeons met at=20

General Shafter=E2=80=99s headquarters early in August and signed a round-r=
obin addressed to the=20

secretary of war urging the immediate removal of the corps to the United St=
ates. This action was=20

much criticised at the time, but it had the desired effect, and on August 4=
th orders were given to=20

remove the command to Montauk Point, Long Island. The movement was begun at=
 once and=20

completed before the end of the month.  [Illustration: THE LAST OF CERVERA=

 3415 men, mostly=20

volunteers, convoyed by a fleet under the command of Captain Higginson, and=
 landed at Guanica=20

of his brigade and=20
