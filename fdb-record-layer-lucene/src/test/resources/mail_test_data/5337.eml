philodendron monstera  "Surely," said Persis, very softly, "it is the Holy Spirit alone that can convince of sin; it is only God himself who can open the eyes of the blind."  "Then to God we must turn for the blessing, After that, I'll tell you where to go next."  "Is this your 'inspiration'?" I asked.  "I'm not sure yet. Why?" and her voice was rather sharp.

Self-Reproach.   "Are you going to see poor Stone to-morrow?" said Persis Franks to her husband 

on the evening of that same Saturday.  "Ay, Sunday is the only day when I can find time now to 

visit a sick friend."  "I am sure that in this case it is 'the better day the better deed,'" observed 

Persis, as her fingers briskly plied the needle, while the pile of unmended stockings on her right 

hand was gradually growing small, as pair after pair, neatly darned and folded, were transferred to 

the left. "Mrs. Stone was saying to me to-day how much her husband enjoys your calls. You will 

never regret these visits, Ned."  "Now it's odd enough, wife, that at the moment when you spoke to 

me I was thinking of these same visits of mine to poor Stone, and thinking of them _with_ regret. I 

might use a stronger word," continued Franks, as his wife glanced up with mild surprise; "I've been 

taking myself to task for these same Sunday visits."  "Surely, dearest, _it is lawful to do good on 

the Sabbath day_; that is what our Lord himself has told us."  "Ay, _to do good_," repeated 

Franks; "but I'm not clear that I've not rather done Ben Stone harm. You and I are alone, wifie, and 

I don't mind saying to you what I wouldn't say to any one else." Franks lowered his voice as he 

went on. "Stone's voyage through life has been a very easy one; it seems almost as if his vessel 

had been one that could guide itself without any pilot at all; he has never met a storm that I've 

heard of,--all has been smooth sailing with him. And yet, wifie, I fear that Stone has not had his 

eye fixed on the Pole-Star, nor his finger tracing the right course on the Bible-chart. Self-

righteousness is a sunken rock, none the less dangerous for being sunken, and if a poor bark go 

to pieces upon it, we know that it's just as surely lost as if it had gone down in the whirlpool of 

drunkenness, or of any other open vice."  "But I do not exactly see what _you_ have to reproach 

yourself with if poor Stone think himself a better Christian than he actually is," observed Persis. 

feel exactly the same way. Your eyes are as big as half-crowns, and as black as ink."  "I _am_ a 

little nervous," I confessed. And I couldn't help thinking it odd that Lisa and I should both be feeling 

that electrical sensation at the same time. "Perhaps it's in the air. Maybe there's going to be a 

thunder-storm. There are clouds over the stars, and a wind coming up."  "Maybe it's partly that, 

maybe not," said she. "But there's one thing I'm sure of. _Something's going to happen._"  "Do you 

feel that, too?" I broke out before I'd stopped to think. Then I wished I hadn't. But it was too late to 

wish. Lisa caught me up quickly.  "Ah, I _knew_ you did!" she cried, looking as eerie and almost as 

haggard as a witch. "Something _is_ going to happen. Come. Go with me and be in it, whatever it 

is."  "No," I said. "And you mustn't go either." But she was weird. She seemed to lure me, like a 

strange little siren, with all a siren's witchery, though without her beauty. My voice sounded 

undecided, and I knew it.  "Of course I'm not asking you to wander with me in the night, hand in 

hand through the streets of Paris, like the Two Orphans," said Lisa. "I'm going to have a closed 

carriage--a motor-brougham, one belonging to the hotel, so it's quite safe. It's ordered already, and 

I shall first drive and drive until my nerves stop jerking and my head throbbing. If you won't drive 

with me I shall drive alone. But there'll be no harm in it, either way. I didn't know you were so 

conventional as to think there could be. Where's your brave, independent American spirit?"  "I'm 

not conventional," I said.  "Yes, you are. Living in England has spoiled you. You're afraid of things 

you never used to be afraid of."  "I'm not afraid of things, and I'm not a bit changed," I said. "You 

only want to 'dare' me."  "I want you to go with me. It would be so much nicer than going alone," 



she begged. "Supposing I got ill in a hired cab? I might, you know; but I _can't_ stay indoors, 

whatever happens. If we were together it would be an adventure worth remembering."  "Very well," 

I said, "I'll go with you, not for the adventure, but rather than have you make a fuss because I try to 

keep you in, and rather than you should go alone."  "Good girl!"

"Don't you see I've a kind of credit in the village for hanging out my colors boldly, and trying at 

least to sail by the chart? When I go Sunday after Sunday and sit with a sick, I fear a dying man, 

and join with him in cheerful talk, as if I'd never an object but to make the time pass pleasantly, I 

only cause him to think, 'There's Ned Franks, a dreadfully strict and precise old tar; he must be 

sure that I'm steering all right, for if he saw danger he'd be certain to bid me _sheer off_.'"  "But I 

have no doubt that your conversation often takes a religious turn," observed Persis.  "A religious 

turn!" repeated Franks, in a rather sarcastic tone; "ay, a kind of sop to my conscience, and, 

perhaps, poor fellow, to his. We talk, maybe, of the sermon, and the way in which busy hands are 

getting on with repairing the almshouses, and what a good minister the vicar is, and how glad we 

shall be if the Lord lets him fill the pulpit again. There's a text put in here and there, and Stone 

says something about being thankful for having no pain, and having been given a good wife and a 

comfortable home, and such peace in his mind. But I know that such conversations as these held 

with one who, in a few months, will probably suffer that great change for which I cannot in charity 

think him prepared, is but a kind of idle beating and tacking about; it is not had got her way; though 

if I'd refused she would probably have cried. She is terrifying when she cries. Great, deep sobs 

seem almost to tear her frail little body to pieces. She goes deadly white, and sometimes ends up 

by a fit of trembling as if she were in an ague.  "Have you really ordered a motor cab?" I asked. 

"Yes," said she. "I rang for a waiter, and sent him down to tell the big porter at the front door to get 

me one. Then I gave him five francs, and said I did not want anybody to know, because I must visit 

a poor, sick friend who had written to say she was in great trouble, but wished to tell no one except 

me that she'd come to Paris."  "I shouldn't have thought such an elaborate story necessary to a 

waiter," I remarked, tossing up my chin a little, for I don't like Lisa's subterranean ways. But this 

time she didn't even try to defend herself.  "Let's get ready at once," she said. "I'm going to put on 

my long travelling cloak, to cover up this dress, and wear my black toque, with a veil. I suppose 

you'll do the same? Then we can slip out, and down the 'service' stairs. The carriage is to wait for 

us at the side entrance."  I looked at her, trying to read her secretive little face. "Lisa, are you 

planning to go somewhere in particular, do something you want to 'spring' on me when it's too late 

for me to get out of it?"  "How horrid

himself when I leave him, 'Am I in the right course? Is this peace of which I talk the peace of a 

converted or of a dead soul? What shall I plead when I stand, as I soon must, in the immediate 

presence of a heart-searching God?'" Franks rose from his seat, and paced up and down his little 

room, as he was wont to do when anything disturbed or perplexed him.  "Do you intend then," 

asked Persis, laying down her work, "to speak faithfully to our poor friend I haven't had an 

inspiration yet, so I can't make a plan. But it will come; I know it will. I shall _feel_ where we ought 

to go, to be in the midst of an adventure--oh, without being mixed up in it, so don't look horrified! I 

told you that something was going to happen, and that I wanted to be in it. Well, I mean to be, 

when the inspiration comes."  We put on our dark hats and long travelling cloaks. I pinned on 

Lisa's veil, and my own. Then she peeped to

Ned passed his hand through his curly hair; he looked perplexed and undecided. "I wish I were fit 

for such speaking," said he. "If Mr. Curtis were able to get about, he'd go right to the point with 

Stone at once; but I don't think there's anything in life so hard as to convince a self-righteous man 

that he's a sinner in need of was nobody in the corridor. We hurried out, and as Lisa already knew 

where to find the 'service' stairs, we were soon on the way down. At the side entrance of the hotel 

the motor-cab was waiting, and when we were both seated inside, Lisa spoke in French to the 

driver, who waited for orders.  "I think you might take us to the Rue
