dracaena marginata rabbit finishes cooking. It's done now, I guess."  The b=
oy removed the rabbit from the spit, and salted it, using a shaker which th=
e Cubs were certain had come from Mrs. Jones' home.  "Have some?" he invite=

ing  Grandmother sighed. "Sure enough, where _would_ you sleep, dear! I don=
't doubt you're warm there. You'll have a better house after while, Antonia=
, and then you'll forget these hard times."  Mr. Shimerda made grandmother =
sit down on the only chair and pointed his wife to a stool dracaena margina=

only chair and pointed his wife to a stool _
warning glance. "If you didn't swipe 'em--"  "Well, I didn't and you better=
 not accuse me! I've been=20

right here for the last forty minutes."  "You're using Mrs. Jones' rifle!" =
Red accused, refusing to be=20

checked.  "Why not? She never touched it. A rifle was meant to be used not =
left to rust."  "Mrs.=20

Jones thinks you've been taking things from her."  "That's a black lie!"  "=
Cord wood for instance."=20

"What would I steal wood for, when I have to keep chopping more to replace =
it?" Jack shouted=20

furiously. "Use your head, or haven't you got one?"  At this point, Mr. Hat=
field warned Red to drop=20

the argument.  "Sorry," the boy mumbled.  Jack however, was not willing to =
allow the matter to=20

pass.  "What else did Mrs. Jones say I took?" he demanded.  "I don't recall=
 that she accused you,"=20

Mr. Hatfield answered. "She merely was disturbed because of the wood and a =
few other trifles."=20

"Someone else had been taking that wood. What else did she say was very dar=
k, too. A lighted=20

lantern, hung over the stove, threw out a feeble yellow glimmer.  Mrs. Shim=
erda snatched off the=20

covers of two barrels behind the door, and made us look into them. In one t=
here were some=20

potatoes that had been frozen and were rotting, in the other was a little p=
ile of flour. Grandmother=20

murmured something in embarrassment, but the Bohemian woman laughed scornfu=
lly, a kind of=20

whinny-laugh, and catching up an empty coffee-pot from the shelf, shook it =
at us with a look=20

positively vindictive.  Grandmother went on talking in her polite Virginia =
way, not admitting their=20

stark need or her own remissness, until Jake arrived with the hamper, as if=
 in direct answer to Mrs.=20

Shimerda's reproaches. Then the poor woman broke down. She dropped on the f=
loor beside her=20

crazy son, hid her face on her knees, and sat crying bitterly. Grandmother =
paid no heed to her, but=20

called Antonia to come and help empty the basket. Tony=20


_
missing?"  "A black dress," Dan answered. "One with jet buttons."  "Of cour=
se we don't think you'd=20

have any use for a woman's dress," Dan went on, watching the boy intently. =
 Jack made no reply.=20

After a long while, he said:  "I didn't take that dress. If I were a mind t=
o though, I could tell you=20

something about it!"  "Suppose you do just that," Mr. Hatfield encouraged h=
im.  Jack smiled in a=20

superior, insolent way. The wave of friendliness which he briefly had displ=
ayed, now was entirely=20

gone. Once more he seemed the arrogant, defiant runaway.  "Why should her c=
orner reluctantly. I=20

had never seen her crushed like this before.  "You not mind my poor mamenka=
, Mrs. Burden. She=20

is so sad," she whispered, as she wiped her wet hands on her skirt and took=
 the things=20

grandmother handed her.  The crazy boy, seeing the food, began to make soft=
, gurgling noises=20

and stroked his stomach. Jake came in again, this time with a sack of potat=
oes. Grandmother=20

looked about in perplexity.  "Have n't you got any sort of cave or cellar o=
utside, Antonia? This is no=20

place to keep vegetables. How did your potatoes get frozen?"  "We=20


_
"Because it's the right thing to do, Jack. We have a particular reason for =
being interested in what=20

became of that black silk dress."  "You've accused me of being a thief."  "=
No, Jack. The Cubs were=20

a bit abrupt perhaps. They believe in being square and honest. Naturally it=
 made them sore to=20

think you might have taken the biscuits."  "I told you, I don't know nothin=
' about 'em!"  "And we=20

accept your word, Jack."  "Then you said I took wood and the Widow's black =
dress."  "No, Jack,=20

we merely were telling you what she said. Unfortunately, when one has a pas=
t record, it's apt to=20

plague one unjustly."  "Sure, I'm a bad kid! I know!" Jack said, his eyes f=
lashing. "Okay! Send me=20

to an industrial school! But try to keep me there! I'll run away a thousand=
 times!"  "You're talking=20

wildly now, Jack. No one wants to send you away. Quite the opposite. Mrs. p=
otatoes, Mrs.=20

Burden," Tony admitted mournfully.  When Jake went out, Marek crawled along=
 the floor and=20

stuffed up the door-crack again. Then, quietly as a shadow, Mr. Shimerda ca=
me out from behind=20

the stove. He stood brushing his hand over his smooth gray hair, as if he w=
ere trying to clear away=20

a fog about his head. He was clean and neat as usual, with his green neckcl=
oth and his coral pin.=20

He took grandmother's arm and led her behind the stove, to the back of the =
room. In the rear wall=20

was another little cave; a round hole, not much bigger than an oil barrel, =
scooped out in the black=20

earth. When I got up on one of the stools and peered into it, I saw some qu=
ilts and a pile of straw.=20

The old man held the lantern. "Yulka," he said in a low, despairing voice, =
"Yulka; my Antonia!"=20

Grandmother drew back. "You mean they sleep in there,--your=20


_
keep you with her."  "She's been pretty decent to me," Jack admitted, softe=
ning again. "I did take=20

food out of the ice box without asking her. Not very much though. Just enou=
gh so I could get along=20

out here in the woods."  "She's worried about you now, Jack. She asked me t=
o send you home, if I=20

saw you."  "Oh, I'll go," bowed his head.  Tony slipped under his arm. "It =
is very cold on the floor,=20

and this is warm like the badger hole. I like for sleep there," she insiste=
d eagerly. "My mamenka=20

have nice bed, with pillows from our own geese in Bohemie. See, Jim?" She p=
ointed to the narrow=20

bunk which Krajiek had built against the wall for=20
