the author, being an ex-Rabbi, thoroughly versed in Hebrew, and in the mysteries of the _Zohar_, 

ought to know the value of words; and as, moreover, in writing this, he was bent upon reconciling 

"the seeming contradictions," as he puts it, between Judaism and Christianity--the fact becomes 

quite evident.  But all this pertains to questions and problems which will be solved naturally and in 

the course of the development of the doctrine. The Roman Catholic Church stands accused, not of 

worshipping under other names the Divine Beings worshipped by all nations in antiquity, but of 

declaring idolatrous, not only the Pagans ancient and modern, but every Christian nation that has 

freed itself from the Roman yoke. The accusation brought against herself by more than one man 

of Science, of worshipping the stars like true Sabaeans of old, stands to this day uncontradicted, 

yet no star- worshipper has ever addressed his adoration to the material stars and planets, as will 

be shown before the last page of this work is written; none the less is it true that those 

Philosophers alone who studied Astrology and Magic knew that the last word of those sciences 

was to be sought in, and expected from, the Occult forces emanating from those constellations. 

SECTION XXIV. MODERN KABALISTS IN SCIENCE AND OCCULT ASTRONOMY.   There is a 

physical, an astral, and a super-astral Universe in the three chief divisions of the _Kabalah_; as 

there are terrestrial, super- terrestrial, and spiritual Beings. The "Seven Planetary Spirits" may be 

ridiculed by Scientists to their hearts' content, yet the need of intelligent ruling and guiding Forces 

is so much felt to this day that scientific men and specialists, who will not hear of Occultism or of 

ancient systems, find themselves obliged to generate in their inner consciousness some kind of 

semi-mystical system. Metcalf's "sun-force" theory, and that of Zaliwsky, a learned Pole, which 

made Electricity the Universal Force and placed its storehouse in the Sun,(400) were revivals of 

the Kabalistic teachings. Zaliwsky tried to prove that Electricity, producing "the most powerful, 

attractive, calorific, and luminous effects," was present in the physical constitution of the Sun and 

explained its peculiarities. This is very near the Occult teaching. It is only by admitting the gaseous 

nature of the Sun-reflector, and the powerful Magnetism and Electricity of the solar attraction and 

repulsion, that one can explain (_a_) the evident absence of any waste of power and luminosity in 

the Sun--inexplicable by the ordinary laws of combustion; and (_b_) the behaviour of the planets, 

so often contradicting every accepted rule of weight and gravity. And Zaliwsky makes this "solar 

electricity" "_differ from anything known on earth_."  Father Secchi may be suspected of having 

sought to introduce       _Forces of quite a new order_ and quite foreign to gravitation,     which he 

had discovered in Space,(401)   in order to reconcile Astronomy with theological Astronomy. But 

Nagy, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, should like to have three sons; I should 

make the first a nobleman, like Athos; the second a good soldier, like Porthos; the third an 

excellent abbe, like Aramis. Faith! that would be a far better life than I lead now; but Monsieur 

Mazarin is a mean wretch, who won't dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor."  On entering 

the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house. 

"Oho!" said he, "is the hotel on fire?" On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found, however, that 

it was in front of the next house the mob was collected. The people were shouting and running 

about with torches. By the light of one of these torches D'Artagnan perceived men in uniform.  He 

asked what was going on.  He was told that twenty citizens, headed by one man, had attacked a 

carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal's bodyguard; but a reinforcement having 

come up, the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to 



his lodgings; the house was now being searched.  In his youth D'Artagnan had often headed the 

bourgeoisie against the military, but he was cured of all those hot-headed propensities; besides, 

he had the cardinal's hundred pistoles in his pocket, so he went into the hotel without a word. 

There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the 

evening, but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a 

bottle of good Burgundy.  He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom. He had 

been contented, for the convenience of the house, to lodge in the fourth story; and truth obliges us 

even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof. His first care on 

entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money, and then as soon as 

supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table.  Not to reflect 

on what had passed, as one might fancy. No, D'Artagnan considered that things are never well 

done when they are not reserved to their proper time. He was hungry; he supped, he went to bed. 

Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with 

it. In the night he slept, but in the morning, refreshed and calm, he was inspired with his clearest 

views of everything. It was long since he had any reason for his morning's inspiration, but he 

always slept all night long. At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room.  "In '43," he 

said, "just before the death of the late cardinal, I received a letter from Athos. Where was I then? 

Let me see. Oh! at the siege of Besancon I was in the trenches. He told me--let me think--what 

was it? That he was living on a small estate--but where? I was just reading the name of the place 

when the wind blew my letter away, I suppose to the Spaniards; there's no use in thinking any 

more about Athos. Let me see: with regard to Porthos, I received a letter from him, too. He invited 

me to a hunting party on his property in 


_
develops a theory on the necessity of intelligent Forces whose complacency "would lend itself to 

all the whims of the comets." He suspects that:       Notwithstanding all the actual researches on 

the rapidity of     light--that _dazzling product of an unknown force_ ... which we see     too 

frequently to understand--_that light is motionless_ in     reality.(402)   C. E. Love, the well-known 

railway builder and engineer in France, September, 1646. Unluckily, as I was then in Bearn, on 

account of my father's death, the letter followed me there. I had left Bearn when it arrived and I 

never received it until the month of April, 1647; and as the invitation was for September, 1646, I 

couldn't accept it. Let me look for this letter; it must be with my title deeds."  D'Artagnan opened an 

old casket which stood in a corner of the room, and which was full of 


_
of blind forces, made all the (then) "imponderable agents"--now called "forces"--subordinates of 

Electricity, and declares the latter to be an       Intelligence--albeit molecular in nature and 

material.(403)   In the author's opinion these Forces are atomistic agents, endowed with 

intelligence, spontaneous will, and motion,(404) and he thus, like the Kabalists, makes the causal 

Forces substantial, while the Forces that act on this plane are only the effects of the former, as 

with him matter is eternal, and the Gods also;(405) so is the Soul likewise, though it has inherent 

in itself a still higher Soul [Spirit], preexistent, endowed with memory, and superior to Electric 

Force; the latter is subservient to the higher Souls, those superior Souls forcing it to act according 

to the eternal two hundred years lost to his family. He uttered an exclamation of delight, for the 

large handwriting of Porthos was discernible, and underneath some lines traced by his worthy 

spouse.  D'Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter; it was dated from the Chateau 

du Vallon.  Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary; in his pride he fancied 

that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon.  "Devil take the vain fellow," said D'Artagnan. 

"However, I had better find him out first, since he can't want money. Athos must have become an 

idiot by this time from drinking. Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by 

constant genuflexion."  He cast his eyes again on the letter. There was a postscript:  "I write by the 

same courier to our worthy friend 


_
lines. Moreover, the system proposed is entirely pantheistic, and is worked out in a purely 

scientific volume. Monotheists and Roman Catholics fall foul of it, of course; but one who believes 

in the Planetary Spirits and who endows Nature with living Intelligences, must always expect this. 

In this connection, however, it is curious that after the moderns have so laughed at the ignorance 

of the ancients,       Who, knowing only of seven planets [yet having an ogdoad which     _did not_ 

include the earth!], invented therefore convent."  "In his convent! What convent? There are about 

two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France; and then, perhaps, on entering the convent he 

changed his name. Ah! if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to 

dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits, when we were at 

Crevecoeur; I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he 

has adopted as his patron.  "Well, suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a 


_
fit in with the number,   Babinet should have vindicated the "superstition" unconsciously to himself. 

In the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ this eminent French Astronomer writes:       The ogdoad of the 

Ancients included the earth [which is an error],     _i.e._, eight or seven according to whether or not 

the earth was     comprised in the number.(406)   De Mirville assures his readers that:       M. 

Babinet was telling me but a few days ago that we had in     reality only eight big planets, including 

the earth, and so many     small ones between Mars and Jupiter.... Herschel offering to call     all 

those beyond the seven primary planets asteroids!(407)   There is a problem to be solved in this 

connection. How do Astronomers know that Neptune is a planet, or even that it is a body 

belonging to our system? Being found on the very confines of our Planetary World, so called, the 

latter was arbitrarily expanded to receive it; but what really mathematical and infallible proof have 

Astronomers that it is (_a_) a planet, and (_b_) one of _our_ planets? None at all! It is at such an 

immeasurable distance from us, the       Apparent diameter of the sun being to Neptune but one-

fortieth of     the sun's apparent all the convents one can find, even into the nunneries? It would be 

a curious idea, and maybe I should find my friend under the name of Achilles. But, no! I should 

lose myself in the cardinal's opinion. Great people only thank you for doing the impossible; what's 

possible, they say, they can effect themselves, and they are right. But let us wait a little and reflect. 

I received a letter from him, the dear fellow, in which he even asked me for some small service, 

which, in fact, I rendered him. Yes, yes; but now what did I do with that letter?"  D'Artagnan 

thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes. He looked for his 

doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits, he found it hanging on its nail. He felt in the 

pocket and drew from it a paper; it was the letter of Aramis:  "Monsieur D'Artagnan: You know that 

I have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman, who has given me an appointment for this evening 

in the Place Royale. As I am of the church, and the affair might injure me if I should share it with 

any other than a sure friend like you, I write to beg that you will serve me as second.  "You will 

enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine; under the second lamp on the 


_
and it is so dim and hazy when seen through the best telescope that it looks like an astronomical 

romance to call it one of our planets. Neptune's heat and light are reduced to 1/900 part of the 

heat and light received by the earth. His motion and that of his satellites have always looked 

suspicious. They do not agree--in appearance, at least--with those of the other planets. His system 

is retrograde, etc. But even the latter abnormal fact resulted only in the creation of new 

hypotheses by our the third.  "Wholly yours,  "Aramis."  D'Artagnan tried to recall his 

remembrances. He had gone to the rendezvous, had encountered there the adversary indicated, 

whose name he had never known, had given him a pretty sword-stroke on the arm, then had gone 

toward Aramis, who at the same time came to meet him, having already finished his affair. "It is 

over," Aramis had said. "I think I have killed the insolent fellow. But, dear friend, if you ever need 

me you know that I am entirely devoted to you." 


_
collision with another body, etc. Was Adams' and Leverrier's discovery so welcomed because 

Neptune was as necessary as was Ether to throw a new glory upon astronomical prevision, upon 

the certitude of modern scientific data, and principally upon the power of mathematical analysis? It 

would so appear. A new planet that widens our planetary domain by more than four hundred 

million leagues is worthy of annexation. Yet, as in the case of terrestrial annexation, scientific 

authority may be proved him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades.  So, 

then, he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were, and the affair was 

becoming a matter of great perplexity, when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room 

window. He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping. He 

was not mistaken; as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window.  "Ah! you 

scoundrel!" cried D'Artagnan, taking the man for a
