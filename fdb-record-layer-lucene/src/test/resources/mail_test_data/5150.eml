portion of a Sanskrit drama is not narrative; it is sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: 

each stanza sums up the emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue has made 

upon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form of the rhymed stanza; and so, 

although rhymed verse is very rarely employed in classical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate 

vehicle for the translation of the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we occasionally find 

stanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank verse, and, more frequently, stanzas which 

are so prosaic as not to deserve a rendering in everything that impressed his imagination, and 

gathering with delight the testimony of those who had themselves been actors in the events of the

Clarence to Milan. The death of Queen Philippa, in 1369, was ruinous to his prospects. For a time 

he supported himself as a trader in his native place. Then other patrons, kinsfolk of the Queen, 

came to his aid. The first revised redaction of the first book of his Chronicles was his chief 

occupation while cure of Lestinnes; it is a record of events from 1325 to the death of Edward III., 

and its brilliant narrative of events still recent or contemporary insured its popularity with

translation may be regarded as in some sort an experiment, I have preferred to hold rigidly to the 

distinction found in the original between simple prose and types of stanza which seem to me to 

correspond to English rhymed verse.  It is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into 

rhymed verse, cannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this disadvantage I have used my 

brother-in-law, Robert of Namur, it is English in its sympathies and admirations. Unhappily 

Froissart was afterwards moved by his patron, Gui de Blois, to rehandle the book in the French 

interest; and once again in his old age his work was recast with a view to effacing the large debt 

which he owed to his predecessor, Jean le Bel. The first redaction is, however, that which won and

may be said that nothing of real moment has been omitted from the verses; and where lack of 

metrical skill has compelled expansion, I have striven to make the additions as insignificant as 

possible.  There is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to imitate the original; this 

is the difference in the dialects used by the various characters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other 

Indian dramas, some of the If his patron induced Froissart to wrong his earlier work, he made 

amends, for it is to Gui de Blois that we owe the last three books of the history, which bring the 

tale of events down to the assassination of Richard II. Still the cure of Lestinnes and the canon of 

Chimai pursued his early method of travel--to the court of Gaston, Count of Foix, to Flanders, to 

England--ever eager in his interrogation of witnesses. It is
