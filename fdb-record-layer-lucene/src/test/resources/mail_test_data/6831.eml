onclusion was reached that the piece of iron which we found was in reality =
a part of one of Captain Kidd's chests, which had become rust-eaten and cru=

t iron. Nothing more could be found. We gathered round the worn sheet of me=
tal, and held a solemn consultation.  The conclusion was reached that the p=
iece of iron which we found was in reality a part of one of Captain Kidd's =
chests, which had become rust-eaten and crumbled, and which had been torn h=
is horses.  'I've brought ye two or three golden plover to take with ye, Mi=

ngly pleased to find that he had not neglected her, nay, that he had been e=
specially thinking of her and her departure.  But what should she do with t=
hese birds _
an unsuspicious manner, as if we had just happened to stop at the Island wi=
thout any definite=20

motive. This should work as a capital ruse, and, we felt confident, it woul=
d initiate a connection on=20

our part with the mysterious search.  That point settled, we concluded to i=
nvestigate the tent and=20

its occupants as well as we might under the cover of darkness, and we promp=
tly set out upon that=20

project. We approached within a hundred feet of the tent, and saw the men s=
till sitting in the light=20

of the fire at the tent door; but there was no discovery of importance. The=
y were merely talking=20

quietly and carelessly about some ship that one of them seemed to be intere=
sted in. We could=20

hear their conversation distinctly, and we were also able to take a good ob=
servation of their=20

appearance.  One of them was a man upwards of sixty, of robust build and gr=
ay hair and beard.=20

He had a kind face, which bore the aspect of one accustomed only to the qui=
eter walks of life,=20

unfamiliar with adventure and ill-suited to an enterprise such as they were=
 now apparently=20

engaged upon. The other man had a weather-beaten face with a long nose, and=
 a swagger of=20

manner which betokened the sailor. This, we afterwards learned, had been hi=
s occupation. We=20

watched them for about an hour; but finally withdrew in the hope of making =
a better acquaintance=20

in the morning.  Soon after daylight we began eagerly to watch for the boat=
, which appeared=20

around a bend in the Sound after the lapse of an hour or so and headed stra=
ight for the Island. We=20

loitered about the yard a little while longer, and then made ready our yach=
t without any=20

appearance of haste.  On setting sail, we made for the beach; but, upon rea=
ching there, turned=20

back at once and sailed for Money Island in an indirect course. We many wei=
rd stories and=20

poetical legends behind them; and what I say is that you want to come over =
and breathe this=20

atmosphere of tradition and romance, and see the places, before you can qui=
te understand the=20

charm of all that kind of literature.  And perhaps you don't find much in t=
hese verses about the=20

poor people who have been driven away from their native strath?  Well, they=
 don't claim to be=20

much.  They were never meant for you to see.  But yes, I do think you will =
like them; and anyhow=20

Jack Huysen has got to like them, and treat them hospitably, unless he is a=
nxious to have his hair=20

raised.  'Gracious me, I think I must hire a hall.  I have just read this s=
crawl over.  Sounds rather=20

muzzy, don't it? But it's this poor brain of mine that has got full of conf=
usion and cobwebs and=20

theories of equality, when I wasn't attending to it.  My arms had the whole=
 day's work to do--as=20

they remind me at this minute; and the Cerebral Hemispheres laid their head=
s, or their half-heads=20

together, when I was busy with the salmon; and entered into a conspiracy ag=
ainst me; and began=20

to make pictures--ghosts, phantom earls, and romantic shepherds and peasant=
-poets, and I don't=20

know what kind of dreams of a deer stalker walking down Wabash Avenue.  But=
, as I said, to-

morrow I start for Paris, thank goodness; and in that calmer atmosphere I h=
ope to come to my=20

senses again; and I will send you a long account of Lily Selden's marriage-=
-though your last letter=20

to me was a fraud: what do I care about the C.M.C.A.?  _This_ letter, anyho=
w, you must burn; I=20

don't feel like reading it over again myself, or perhaps I would save you t=
he trouble; but you may=20

depend on it that the one I shall send you from Paris will be quite sane.  =

you must manage Jack=20


_
reached there and stepped upon the shore. The men immediately dropped their=
 implements. They=20

returned our salutation pleasantly. We observed with much surprise the dist=
urbed state of the=20

ground and the holes which had been dug; and then began to make inquiries a=
s innocently as we=20

could as to their object. Our plans of the night before began to work succe=
ssfully.  By sheer force=20

of persistence, we won our way into their confidence, and worked with them =
until late in the=20

afternoon. For they were indeed on a determined search for Captain Kidd's b=
uried treasure.  We=20

were in constant expectation of discovering the chests of gold--two iron ch=
ests, which Mr.=20

Landstone, the elder gentleman, assured us he felt positive were there. But=
 the discovery was not=20

made, and they said this had been the fourth day of labor on the Island.  T=
he conclusion was=20

reached that, either the surrounding water had encroached upon that portion=
 of the Island where=20

the treasure had been buried, and had thus imposed an almost impossible bar=
rier to its being=20

unearthed; or that the chests had become imbedded beneath the massive roots=
 of two dwarfed old=20

oaks which stood gnarled and storm-worn in the centre of the island. To the=
 task of removing=20

these trees the men felt entirely unequal after their days of work; and, th=
erefore, it was decided to=20

wait a day or two, and approach the task of doing so, if at all, with renew=
ed spirit.  Upon invitation,=20

we boys accompanied the men to their camp and had supper with them. We were=
 entertained by=20

stories of adventure and travel, of sea voyage, of Indian warfare; and, fin=
ally, after several=20

requests of Mr. Landstone, with the story of Money Island. He said he would=
 tell it upon condition=20

that its secrecy would be kept inviolate, at least for many years. So, in t=
he weird light of a large=20

pine-wood fire among the trees, we had the story of Money Island, told in t=
he living voice of a=20

capital story-teller, in almost the same words as are used in the MS he gav=
e me that night, and=20

which has now been publicly printed.  When Mr. Landstone finished, we boys =
sat in breathless=20

amazement, overcome by the glamour of romance which the story had thrown ar=
ound the=20

mysterious little island.  The old sailor forgot his pipe, which turned ove=
r and dropped its contents=20

to the ground. "Aye, sir," he exclaimed, "we will surely uproot those trees=
 in the morning!" And that=20

became the decision of us all.  I remember that, after a long pause, I aske=
d, to reassure myself,=20

"Mr. Landstone, do you really believe that story?" He laughed and said, "We=
ll, you see I am on an=20

undertaking I have had in mind for nearly fifty years. Yes, I believe those=
 chests are there."  That=20

was enough. I did not discretion.  I don't want to be drawn into it any mor=
e than I can help; I mean,=20

I would just hate to write to him direct and ask him for a particular favou=
r; but this is a very little=20

one, and you know him as well as any of us.  And mind you burn this letter-=
-instantly--the moment=20

you have read it--for it is just full of nonsense and wool-gathering; and _=
it will not occur again.=20

Toujours a toi_.  C.H.'  'What have you been writing all this time?' her fa=
ther said, when she rose.=20

'A letter--to Emma Kerfoot.'  'It will make her stare.  You don't often wri=
te long letters.'  'I do not,'=20

said she, gravely regarding the envelope; and then she added solemnly: 'But=
 this is the record of a=20

chapter in my life that is now closed for ever--at least, I hope so.'      =
                            *CHAPTER=20

III.*                               *HESITATIONS.*   The waggonette stood a=
t the door; Miss Carry's luggage=20

was put in; and her father was waiting to see her off.  But the young lady =
herself seemed unwilling=20

to take the final step; twice she went back into the inn, on some pretence =
or another; and each=20

time she came out she looked impatiently around, as if wondering at the abs=
ence of some one.=20

'Well, ain't you ready yet?' her father asked.  'I want to say good-bye to =
Ronald,' she said half=20

angrily.  'Oh, nonsense--you are not going to America.  Why, you will be ba=
ck in ten days or a=20



fortnight.  See here, Carry,' he added, 'are you sure you don't want me to =
go part of the way with=20

you?'  'Not at all,' she said promptly.  'It is impossible for Mary to mist=
ake the directions I wrote to=20

her; and I shall find her in the Station Hotel at Inverness all right.  Don=
't you worry about me,=20

pappa.'  She glanced along the road again, in the direction of the keeper's=
 cottage; but there was=20

no one in sight.  'Pappa dear,' she said, in an undertone--for there were o=
ne or two onlookers=20

standing by--'if Ronald should decide on giving up his place here, and tryi=
ng what you suggested,=20

you'll have to stand by him.'  'Oh yes, I'll see him through,' was the comp=
lacent answer.  'I should=20

take him to be the sort of man who can look after himself; but if he wants =
any kind of help--well,=20

here I am; I won't go back on a man who is acting on my advice.  Why, if he=
 were to come out to=20

Chicago----'  'Oh no, not Chicago, pappa,' she said, somewhat earnestly, 'n=
ot to Chicago.  I am=20

sure he will be more at home--he will be happier--in his own country.'  She=
 looked around once=20

more; and then she stepped into the waggonette.  'He might have come to see=
 me off,' she said, a=20

little proudly. 'Good-bye, pappa dear--I will send you a telegram as soon a=
s I get to Paris.'  The=20

two horses sprang forward; Miss Carry waved=20


_
morning we were early at the task of searching for the treasure. And a stup=
endous undertaking it=20

proved to be. All day we labored at one tree. The roots were massive and wi=
de-spread, and the=20

work of cutting and removing them required the utmost exertion. Finally, ju=
st before sunset, we=20

completed the task, and began to dig for the treasure in the earth below.  =
Already water had begun=20

to percolate into the hole, and ere we had gone much deeper, it flooded it =
so that we found it=20

impossible to continue the excavation. Then we resorted to our sounding rod=
 again for a last ray of=20

hope, and almost immediately it struck something hard! Our spirits rose wit=
hin us.  I tore off my=20

clothes, and jumped into the water. After working for some time, with the a=
id of a shovel, I brought=20

to the surface a piece set to work to make herself comfortable with wraps a=
nd rugs, for the=20

morning was chill.  She thought it was very unfriendly of Ronald not to hav=
e come to say good-

bye.  And what was the reason of it?  Of course he could know nothing of th=
e nonsense she had=20

written to her friend in Chicago.  'Have you not seen Ronald about anywhere=
?' she asked of the=20

driver.  'No, mem,' answered that exceedingly shy youth, 'he wass not about=
 all the morning.  But I=20

heard the crack of a gun; maybe he wass on the hill.'  And presently he sai=
d--  'I'm thinking that's=20

him along the road--it's two of his dogs whatever.'  And indeed this did tu=
rn out to be Ronald who=20

was coming striding along the road, with his gun over his shoulder, a brace=
 of setters at his heels,=20

and something dangling from his left hand.  The=20
