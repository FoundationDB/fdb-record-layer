philodendron monstera people who had suffered by it; he thinks of it in rel=
ation to God. He had been guilty of crimes against Bathsheba and Uriah, and=
 even the rough soldier whom he made his tool, as well as against his whole=
 subjects; but, dark as these were, they assumed their true character only =
when they were discerned as done against God. "Sin," in its full sense, imp=
lies "God" as its correlative. We transgress against each other, but we sin=
 against Him.  Nor does the psalmist stop here. He has acknowledged the tan=
gled multiplicity and dreadful unity of his evil, he has seen its inmost ch=
aracter, he has learned to bring his deed into connection with God; what re=
mains still to be confessed? He laments, and that not as extenuation (thoug=
h it be explanation), but as aggravation, the sinful nature in which he had=
 been born. The deeds had come from a source--a bitter fountain had welled =
out this blackness. He himself is evil, therefore he has done evil. The sin=
 is his; he will not contest his full responsibility; and its foul characte=
ristics declare the inward foulness from which it has flowed--and that foul=
ness is himself. Does he therefore think that he is less to blame? By no me=
ans. His acknowledgment of an evil nature is the very deepest of his confes=
sions, and leads not to a palliation of his guilt, but to a cry to Him who =
alone can heal the inward wound; and as He can purge away the transgression=
s, can likewise stanch their source, and give him to feel within "that he i=
s healed from that plague."  The same intensity of feeling expressed by the=
 use of so many words for sin is revealed also in the reiterated synonyms f=
or pardon. The prayer comes from his lips over and over again, not because =
he thinks that he shall be heard for his much speaking, but because of the =
earnestness of his longing. Such repetitions are signs of the persistence o=
f faith, while others, though they last like the prayers of Baal's priests,=
 "from morning till the time of the evening sacrifice," indicate only the s=
uppliant's doubt. David prays that his sins may be "blotted out," in which =
petition they are conceived as recorded against him in the archives of the =
heavens; that he may be "washed" from them, in which they are conceived as =
foul stains upon himself, needing for their removal hard rubbing and beatin=
g (for such is, according to some commentators, the force of the word); tha=
t he may be "cleansed"--the technical word for the priestly cleansing of th=
e leper, and declaring him clear of the taint. He also, with similar recurr=
ence to the Mosaic symbols, prays that he may be "purged with hyssop." Ther=
e is a pathetic appropriateness in the petition, for not only lepers, but t=
hose who had become defiled by contact with a dead body, were thus purified=
; and on whom did the taint of corruption cleave as on the murderer of Uria=
h? The prayer, too, is even more remarkable in the original, which employs =
a verb formed from the word for "sin;" "and if in our language that were a =
word in use, it might be translated, 'Thou shalt un-sin me.'"[W]  [W] Donne=
's Sermons, quoted in Perowne, _in. loc._  In the midst of these abased con=
fessions and cries for pardon there comes with wonderful force and beauty t=
he bold prayer for restoration to "joy and gladness"--an indication surely =
of more than ordinary confidence in the full mercy of God, which would effa=
ce all the consequences of his sin.  And following upon them are petitions =
for sanctifying, reiterated and many-sided, like those that have preceded. =
Three pairs of clauses contain these, in each of which the second member of=
 the clause asks for the infusion into his spirit of some grace from God--t=
hat he may possess a "steadfast spirit," "Thy Holy Spirit," "a willing spir=
it." It is perhaps not an accident that the central petition of the three i=
s the one which most clearly expresses the thought which all imply--that th=
e human spirit can only be renewed and hallowed by the entrance into it of =
the Divine. We are not to commit the theological anachronism which has been=
 applied with such evil effect to the whole Old Testament, and suppose that=
 David meant by that central clause in his prayer for renewal all that we m=
ean by it; but he meant, at least, that his spiritual nature could be made =
to love righteousness and hate iniquity by none other power than God's brea=
thing on it. If we may venture to regard this as the heart of the series, t=
he other two on either side of it may be conceived as its consequences. It =
will then be "a right spirit," or, as the word means, a steadfast spirit, s=
trong to resist, not swept away by surges of passion, nor shaken by terrors=
 of remorse, but calm, tenacious, and resolved, pressing on in the path of =
holiness, and immovable with changing places so fast, make it so lively for=
 me," she went on.  "I think of the number of people who _can_ go where the=
y wish, on their business, or their pleasure; I remember that the puffs mak=
e signs to me that they are actually going while I look; and that enlivens =
the prospect with abundance of company, if I want company.  There is the gr=
eat Junction, too.  I don't see it under the foot of the hill, but I can ve=
ry often hear it, and I always know it is there.  It seems to join me, in a=
 way, to I don't know how many places and things that _I_ shall never see."=
  With an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined himself to=
 something he had never seen, he said constrainedly: "Just so."  "And so yo=
u see, sir," pursued Phoebe, "I am not the invalid you thought me, and I am=
 very well off indeed."  "You have a happy disposition," said Barbox Brothe=
rs: perhaps with a slight excusatory touch for his own disposition.  "Ah!  =
But you should know my father," she replied.  "His is the happy disposition=
!--Don't mind, sir!"  For his reserve took the alarm at a step upon the sta=
irs, and he distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome intruder=
.  "This is my father coming."  The door opened, and the father paused ther=
e.  "Why, Lamps!" exclaimed Barbox Brothers, starting from his chair.  "How=
 do you do, Lamps?"  To which, Lamps responded: "The gentleman for Nowhere!=
  How do you DO, sir?"  And they shook hands, to the greatest admiration an=
d surprise of Lamps's daughter.  "I have looked you up, half a dozen times =
since that night," said Barbox Brothers, "but have never found you."  "So I=
've heerd on, sir, so I've heerd on," returned Lamps.  "It's your being not=
iced so often down at the Junction, without taking any train, that has begu=
n to get you the name among us of the gentleman for Nowhere. No offence in =
my having called you by it when took by surprise, I hope, sir?"  "None at a=
ll.  It's as good a name for me as any other you could call me by.  But may=
 I ask you a question in the corner here?"  Lamps suffered himself to be le=
d aside from his daughter's couch, by one of the buttons of his velveteen j=
acket.  "Is this the bedside where you sing your songs?"  Lamps nodded.  Th=
e gentleman for Nowhere clapped him on the shoulder; and they faced about a=
gain.  "Upon my word, my dear," said Lamps then to his daughter, looking fr=
om her to her visitor, "it is such an amaze to me, to find you brought acqu=
ainted with this gentleman, that I must (if this gentleman will excuse me) =
take a rounder."  Mr. Lamps demonstrated in action what this meant, by pull=
ing out his oily handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball, and giving h=
imself an elaborate smear, from behind the right ear, up the cheek, across =
the forehead, and down the other cheek to behind his left ear.  After this =
operation he shone exceedingly.  "It's according to my custom when particul=
ar warmed up by any agitation, sir," he offered by way of apology.  "And re=
ally, I am throwed into that state of amaze by finding you brought acquaint=
ed with Phoebe, that I--that I think I will, if you'll excuse me, take anot=
her rounder." Which he did, seeming to be greatly restored by it.  They wer=
e now both standing by the side of her couch, and she was working at her la=
ce-pillow.  "Your daughter tells me," said Barbox Brothers, still in a half=
 reluctant shamefaced way, "that she never sits up."  "No, sir, nor never h=
as done.  You see, her mother (who died when she was a year and two months =
old) was subject to very bad fits, and as she had never mentioned to me tha=
t she _was_ subject to fits, they couldn't be guarded against.  Consequentl=
y, she dropped the baby when took, and this happened."  "It was very wrong =
of her," said Barbox Brothers, with a knitted brow, "to marry you, making a=
 secret of her infirmity."  "Well, sir," pleaded Lamps, in behalf of the lo=
ng-deceased.  "You see, Phoebe and me, we have talked that over too.  And L=
ord bless us!  Such a number on us has our infirmities, what with fits, and=
 what with misfits, of one sort and another, that if we confessed to 'em al=
l before we got married, most of us might never get married."  "Might not t=
hat be for the better?"  "Not in this case, sir," said Phoebe, giving her h=
and to her father.  "No, not in this case, sir," said her father, patting i=
t between his own.  "You correct me," returned Barbox Brothers, with a blus=
h; "and I must look so like a Brute, that at all events it would be superfl=
uous in me to confess to _that_ infirmity.  I wish you would tell me a litt=
le more about yourselves.  I hardly know how to ask it of you, for I am con=
scious that I have a bad stiff manner, a dull discouraging way with me, but=
 I wish you would."  "With all our philodendron monstera people who had suf=
fered by it; he thinks of it in relation to God. He had been guilty of crim=
es against Bathsheba and Uriah, and even the rough soldier whom he made his=

their venom into her sarcasm. Taunts provoke taunts; the husband feels that=
 the wife is in heart a=20

partisan of the fallen house of her father, and a despiser of the Lord and =
of His worship; her words=20

hiss with scorn, his flame with anger and rebuke--and so these two that had=
 been so tender in the=20

old days part for ever. The one doubtful act that stained his accession was=
 quickly avenged. Better=20

for both that she had never been rent from that feeble, loving husband that=
 followed her weeping,=20

and was driven back by a single word, flung at him by Abner as if he had be=
en a dog at their=20

heels! (2 Sam. iii. 16).  The gladness and triumph, the awe, and the memori=
es of victory which=20

clustered round the dread symbol of the presence of the Lord of Hosts, are =
wonderfully expressed=20

in the choral twenty-fourth psalm. It is divided into two portions, which E=
wald regards as being=20

originally two independent compositions. They are, however, obviously conne=
cted both in form=20

and substance. In each we have question and answer, as in psalm xv., which =
belongs to the same=20

period. The first half replies to the question, "Who shall ascend the hill =
of the Lord, and who shall=20

stand in His holy place?"--an echo of the terror-struck exclamation of the =
people of Bethshemesh,=20

already quoted. The answer is a description of the _men who dwell with God_=
. The second half=20

deals with the correlative inquiry, "Who is the King of Glory?" and describ=
es the _God who comes=20

to dwell with men_. It corresponds in substance, though not in form, with D=
avid's thought when=20

Uzzah died, in so far as it regards God as drawing near to the worshippers,=
 rather than the=20

worshippers drawing near to Him. Both portions are united by a real interna=
l connection, in that=20

they set forth the mutual approach of God and man which leads to communion,=
 and thus=20

constitute the two halves of an inseparable whole.  Most expositors recogni=
se a choral structure in=20

the psalm, as in several others of this date, as would be natural at the ti=
me of the reorganization of=20

the public musical service. Probably we may gain the key to its form by sup=
posing it to be a=20

processional hymn, of which the first half was to be sung during the ascent=
 to the city of David,=20

and the second while standing before the gates. We have then to fancy the l=
ong line of=20

worshippers climbing the rocky steep hill-side to the ancient fortress so r=
ecently won, the Levites=20

bearing the ark, and the glad multitude streaming along behind them.  First=
 there swells forth from=20

all the singers the triumphant proclamation of God's universal sovereignty,=
 "The earth is the Lord's=20

and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein. For He hath=
 founded it upon the=20

seas and established it upon the floods." It is very noteworthy that such a=
 thought should precede=20

the declaration of His special dwelling in Zion. It guards that belief from=
 the abuses to which it was=20

of course liable--the superstitions, the narrowness, the contempt of all th=
e rest of the world as=20

God-deserted, which are its perversion in sensuous natures. If Israel came =
to fancy that God=20

belonged to them, and that there was only one sacred place in all the world=
, it was not for want of=20

clear utterances to the contrary, which became more emphatic with each fres=
h step in the=20

development of the specializing system under which they lived. The very gro=
und of their peculiar=20

relation to God had been declared, in the hour of constituting it to be--"a=
ll the earth is Mine" (Exod.=20

xix. 5). So now, when the symbol of His presence is to have a local habitat=
ion in the centre of the=20

national life, the psalmist lays for the foundation of his song the great t=
ruth, that the Divine=20

presence is concentrated in Israel, but not confined there, and concentrate=
d in order that it may be=20

diffused. The glory that lights the bare top of Zion lies on all the hills;=
 and He who dwells between=20

the cherubim dwells in all the world, which His continual presence fills wi=
th its fulness, and upholds=20

above the floods.  Then, as they climb, a single voice perhaps chants the s=
olemn question, "Who=20



shall ascend the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in the place of His h=
oliness?"  And the full-

toned answer portrays the men who shall dwell with God, in words which begi=
n indeed with=20

stringent demands for absolute purity, but wonderfully change in tone as th=
ey advance, into=20

gracious assurances, and the clearest vision that the moral nature which fi=
ts for God's presence is=20

God's gift. "The clean-handed, and pure-hearted, who has not lifted up his =
soul to vanity, nor=20

sworn deceitfully;" there is the eternal law which nothing can ever alter, =
that to abide with God a=20

man must be like God--the law of the new covenant as of the old, "Blessed a=
re the pure in heart,=20

for they shall see God." But this requirement, impossible of fulfilment, is=
 not all. If it were, the=20

climbing procession might stop. But up and up they rise, and once again the=
 song bursts forth in=20

deeper and more hopeful words, "He shall _receive_ the blessing from Jehova=
h, and=20

righteousness from the God of his salvation." Then that righteousness, a co=
nstant state of change.=20

_
such requirements will soon find that he does not possess, is to be receive=
d from above, not=20

elaborated from within; is a gift from God, not a product of man's toils. G=
od will make us pure, that=20

we may dwell with Him. Nor is this all. The condition of receiving such a g=
ift has been already=20

partially set forth in the preceding clause, which seems to require righteo=
usness to be possessed=20

as the preliminary to receiving it. The paradox which thus results is insep=
arable from the stage of=20

religious knowledge attained under the Mosaic Law. But the last words of th=
e answer go far=20

beyond it, and proclaim the special truth of the gospel, that the righteous=
ness which fits for=20

dwelling with God is given on the simple condition of _seeking_ Him. To thi=
s designation of the=20

true worshippers is appended somewhat abruptly the one word "Jacob," which =
need neither be=20

rendered as in the English version as an invocation, nor as in the margin, =
with an unnecessary=20

and improbable supplement, "O God of Jacob;" but is best regarded as in app=
osition with the other=20

descriptive clauses, and declaring, as we have found David doing already in=
 previous psalms, that=20

the characters portrayed in them, and these only, constituted the true Isra=
el.    This is the=20

generation of them that seek Him,   That seek Thy face--(this is) Jacob.  A=
nd so the first question=20

is answered, "Who are the men who dwell with God?"--The pure, who receive r=
ighteousness, who=20

seek Him, the true Israel.  And now the procession has reached the front of=
 the ancient city on the=20

hill, and stands before the very walls and weather-beaten gates which Melch=
izedek may have=20

passed through, and which had been barred against Israel till David's might=
 had burst them.=20

National triumph and glad worship are wonderfully blended in the summons wh=
ich rings from the=20

lips of the Levites without: "Lift up your heads, O ye gates! and be ye lif=
t up, ye doors (that have=20

been from) of old!" as if even their towering portals were too low, "and th=
e King of glory shall come=20

in." What force in that name here, in this early song of the King! How clea=
rly he recognises his=20

own derived power, and the real Monarch of whom he is but the shadowy repre=
sentative! The=20

newly-conquered city is summoned to admit its true conqueror and sovereign,=
 whose throne is the=20

ark, which was emphatically named "the glory,"[S] and in whose train the ea=
rthly king follows as a=20

subject and a worshipper. Then, with wonderful dramatic force, a single voi=
ce from within the=20

barred gates asks, like some suspicious warder, "Who then is the King of gl=
ory?" With what a=20

shout of proud confidence and triumphant memories of a hundred fields comes=
, ready and full, the=20

crash of many voices in the answer, "Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mig=
hty in battle!" How=20

vividly the reluctance of an antagonistic world to yield to Israel and Isra=
el's King, is represented in=20

the repetition of the question in a form slightly more expressive of ignora=
nce and doubt, in answer=20

to the reiterated summons, "Who is He, then, the King of glory?" With what =
deepened intensity of=20

triumph there peals, hoarse and deep, the choral shout, "The Lord of Hosts,=
 He is the King of=20

glory." That name which sets Him forth as Sovereign of the personal and imp=
ersonal forces of the=20

universe--angels, and stars, and terrene creatures, all gathered in ordered=
 ranks, embattled for His=20

service--was a comparatively new name in Israel,[T] and brought with it tho=
ughts of irresistible=20

might in earth and heaven. It crashes like a catapult against the ancient g=
ates; and at that=20

proclamation of the omnipotent name of the God who dwells with men, they gr=
ate back on their=20

brazen hinges, and the ark of the Lord enters into its rest.  [S] "And she =
named the child I-chabod=20

(Where is the glory?) saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because th=
e ark of God was=20

taken."--1 _Sam._ iv. 21.  [T] It has been asserted that this is the first =
introduction of the name.=20

("Psalms Chronologically Arranged by Four Friends," p. 14). But it occurs i=
n Hannah's vow (1=20



Sam. i. 11); in Samuel's words to Saul (xv. 2); in David's reply to Goliath=
 (xvii. 45). We have it also=20

in Psalm lix. 5, which we regard as his earliest during his exile. Do the a=
uthors referred to consider=20

these speeches in 1 Sam. as not authentic?     XII.--THE KING--_CONTINUED_.=
   The second=20

event recorded as important in the bright early years is the great promise =
of the perpetuity of the=20

kingdom in David's house. As soon as the king was firmly established and fr=
ee from war, he=20

remembered the ancient word which said, "When He giveth you rest from all y=
our enemies round=20

about, so that ye dwell in safety, then there shall be a place which the Lo=
rd your God shall choose=20

to cause His name to dwell there" (Deut. xii. 10, 11). His own ease rebukes=
 him; he regards his=20

tranquillity not as a season for selfish indolence, but as a call to new fo=
rms of service. He might=20

well have found in the many troubles and vicissitudes of his past life an e=
xcuse for luxurious=20

repose now. But devout souls will consecrate their leisure as their toil to=
 God, and will serve Him=20

with thankful offerings in peace whom they invoked with earnest cries in ba=
ttle. Prosperity is=20

harmless only when it is accepted as an opportunity for fresh forms of devo=
tion, not as an=20

occasion for idle self-indulgence. So we read, with distinct verbal referen=
ce to the words already=20

quoted, that "when the Lord had given him rest round about from all his ene=
mies, the king said=20

unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark=
 of God dwelleth in=20

curtains." The impulse of generous devotion, which cannot bear to lavish mo=
re upon self than it=20

gives to God, at first commended itself to the prophet; but in the solitude=
 of his nightly thoughts the=20

higher wisdom speaks in his spirit, and the word of God gives him a message=
 for the king. The=20

narrative in 2 Sam. makes no mention of David's warlike life as unfitting h=
im for the task, which we=20

find from 2 Chron. was one reason why his purpose was set aside, but brings=
 into prominence the=20

thought that David's generous impulse was outrunning God's commandment, and=
 that his ardour=20

to serve was in some danger of forgetting his entire dependence on God, and=
 of fancying that God=20

would be the better for him. So the prophetic message reminds him that the =
Lord had never,=20

through all the centuries, asked for a house of cedar, and recalls the past=
 life of David as having=20

been wholly shaped and blessed by Him, while it pointedly inverts the king'=
s proposal in its own=20

grand promise, "The Lord telleth thee that He will make thee an house." The=
n follows the=20

prediction of a son of David who should build the house, whose kingdom shou=
ld be perpetual,=20

whose transgressions should be corrected indeed, but never punished as thos=
e of the unhappy=20

Saul; and then, in emphatic and unmistakable words, the perpetuity of David=
's house, his=20

kingdom, and his throne, is reiterated as the close of the whole.  The wond=
erful burst of praise=20

which sprang from David's heart in answer cannot be dealt with here; but cl=
early from that time=20

onwards a new element had been added to his hopes, and a new object present=
ed to his faith.=20

The prophecy of the Messiah enters upon a new stage, bearing a relation, as=
 its successive=20

stages, always unmistakably did, to the history which supplies a framework =
for it. Now for the first=20

time can he be set forth as the king of Israel; now the width of the promis=
e which at first had=20

embraced the seed of the woman, and then had been narrowed to the seed of A=
braham, and=20

thereafter probably to the tribe of Judah, is still further defined as to b=
e fulfilled in the line of the=20

house of David; now the personal Messiah Himself begins to be discerned thr=
ough the words=20

which are to have a preparatory fulfilment, in itself prophetic, in the col=
lective Davidic monarchs=20

whose very office is itself also a prophecy.  Many echoes of this new messa=
ge ring through the=20

later psalms of the king. His own dominion, his conquests, and his office, =
gradually became to=20



himself a solemn prophecy of a mysterious descendant who should be really a=
nd fully all that he=20

was in shadow and in part. As the experience of the exile, so that of the v=
ictorious monarch=20

supplied the colours with which the spirit of prophecy in him painted "befo=
rehand the sufferings of=20

Christ and the glory that should follow." In both classes of psalms we have=
 two forms of the=20

Messianic reference, the typical and the purely prophetic. In the former th=
e events of David's own=20

biography and the feelings of his own soul are so portrayed and expressed a=
s to suggest his=20

greater Son. In the latter, the personality of the psalmist retreats into t=
he background, and is at=20

most only the starting-point for wails of sorrow or gleams of glory which f=
ar transcend anything in=20

the life of the singer. There are portions, for instance, of the xxii. and =
lxix. psalms which no=20

torturing can force into correspondence with any of David's trials; and in =
like manner there are=20

paeans of victory and predictions of dominion which demand a grander interp=
retation than his own=20

royalty or his hopes for his house can yield. Of course, if prophecy is imp=
ossible, there is no more=20

to be said, but that in that case a considerable part of the Old Testament,=
 including many of=20

David's psalms, is unintelligible.  Perhaps the clearest instance of distin=
ct prophecy of the=20

victorious dominion of the personal Messiah is the 110th psalm. In it we do=
 see, no doubt, the=20

influence of the psalmist's own history, shaping the image which rises befo=
re his soul. But the=20

attributes of that king whom he beholds are not his attributes, nor those o=
f any son of his who wore=20

the crown in Israel. And whilst his own history gives the form, it is "the =
Spirit of Christ that was in"=20

him which gives the substance, and transfigures the earthly monarchy into a=
 heavenly dominion.=20

We do not enter upon the question of the Davidic authorship of this psalm. =
Here we have not to=20

depend upon Jewish superscriptions, but on the words of Him whose bare asse=
rtion should be "an=20

end of all strife." Christ says that David wrote it. Some of us are far eno=
ugh behind the age to=20

believe that what He said He meant, and that what He meant is truth.  This =
psalm, then, being=20

David's, can hardly be earlier than the time of Nathan's prophecy. There ar=
e traces in it of the=20

influence of the history of the psalmist, giving, as we have said, form to =
the predictions. Perhaps=20

we may see these in Zion being named as the seat of Messiah's sovereignty a=
nd in the reference=20

to Melchizedek, both of which points assume new force if we suppose that th=
e ancient city over=20

which that half-forgotten name once ruled had recently become his own. Poss=
ibly, too, his joy in=20

exchanging his armour and kingly robe for the priest's ephod, when he broug=
ht up the ark to its=20

rest, and his consciousness that in himself the regal and the sacerdotal of=
fices did not blend, may=20

have led him to meditations on the meaning of both, on the miseries that se=
emed to flow equally=20

from their separation and from their union, which were the precursors of hi=
s hearing the Divine=20

oath that, in the far-off future, they would be fused together in that migh=
ty figure who was to repeat=20

in higher fashion the union of functions which invested that dim King of Ri=
ghteousness and Priest=20

of God in the far-off past. He discerns that _his_ support from the right h=
and of God, _his_ sceptre=20

which he swayed in Zion, _his_ loyal people fused together into a unity at =
last, _his_ triumphant=20

warfare on the nations around, are all but faint shadows of One who is to c=
ome. That solemn form=20

on the horizon of hope is his Lord, the true King whose viceroy he was, the=
 "bright consummate=20

flower" for the sake of which the root has its being. And, as he sees the m=
ajestic lineaments=20

shimmering through the facts of his own history, like some hidden fire toil=
ing in a narrow space ere=20

it leaps into ruddy spires that burst their bonds and flame heaven high, he=
 is borne onwards by the=20

prophetic impulse, and the Spirit of God speaks through his tongue words wh=
ich have no meaning=20



unless their theme be a Divine ruler and priest for all the world.  He begi=
ns with the solemn words=20

with which a prophetic message is wont to be announced, thus at the outset =
stamping on the=20

psalm its true character. The "oracle" or "word of Jehovah unto my Lord," w=
hich he heard, is a new=20

revelation made to him from the heavens. He is taken up and listens to the =
Divine voice calling to=20

His right hand, to the most intimate communion with Himself, and to wieldin=
g the energies of=20

omnipotence--Him whom David knew to be his lord. And when that Divine voice=
 ceases, its=20

mandate having been fulfilled, the prophetic spirit in the seer hymns the c=
oronation anthem of the=20

monarch enthroned by the side of the majesty in the heavens. "The sceptre o=
f Thy strength will=20

Jehovah send out of Zion. Rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies." In sing=
ular juxtaposition are=20

the throne at God's right hand and the sceptre--the emblem of sovereignty--=
issuing from Zion, a=20

dominion realised on earth by a monarch in the heavens, a dominion the cent=
re of which is Zion,=20

and the undefined extent universal. It is a monarchy, too, established in t=
he midst of enemies,=20

sustained in spite of antagonism not only by the power of Jehovah, but by t=
he activity of the=20

sovereign's own "rule." It is a dominion for the maintenance of which devou=
t souls will burst into=20

prayer, and the most powerful can bring but their aspirations. But the visi=
on includes more than the=20

warrior king and his foes. Imbedded, as it were, in the very heart of the d=
escription of the former=20

comes the portraiture of his subjects, for a witness how close is the union=
 between Him and them,=20

and how inseparable from His glories are those who serve Him. They are char=
acterised in a=20

threefold manner. "Thy people (shall be) willing in the day of Thine array.=
" The army is being=20

mustered.[U] They are not mercenaries, nor pressed men. They flock gladly t=
o the standard, like=20

the warriors celebrated of old in Deborah's chant of victory, who "willingl=
y offered themselves."=20

The word of our psalm might be translated "freewill offerings," and the who=
le clause carries us into=20

the very heart of that great truth, that glad consecration and grateful sel=
f-surrender is the one bond=20

which knits us to the Captain of our salvation who gave Himself for us, to =
the meek Monarch=20

whose crown is of thorns and His sceptre a reed, for tokens that His domini=
on rests on suffering=20

and is wielded in gentleness. The next words should be punctuated as a sepa=
rate clause, co-

ordinate with the former, and adding another feature to the description of =
the army. "In the=20

beauties of holiness" is a common name for the dress of the priests: the id=
ea conveyed is that the=20

army is an army of priests, as the king himself is a priest. They are cloth=
ed, not in mail and warlike=20

attire, but in "fine linen clean and white," like the armies which a later =
prophet saw following the=20

Lord of lords. Their warfare is not to be by force and cruelty, nor their c=
onquests bloody; but while=20

soldiers they are to be priests, their weapons purity and devotion, their m=
erciful struggle to bring=20

men to God, and to mirror God to men. Round the one image gather all ideas =
of discipline,=20

courage, consecration to a cause, loyalty to a leader; round the other, all=
 thoughts of gentleness,=20

of an atmosphere of devotion calm and still as the holy place, of stainless=
 character. Christ's=20

servants must be both soldiers and priests, like some of those knightly ord=
ers who bore the cross=20

on helmet and shield, and shaped the very hilts of their swords into its li=
keness. And these soldier-

priests are described by yet another image, "From the womb of the morning t=
hou hast the dew of=20

thy youth," where we are to regard the last word as used in a collective se=
nse, and equivalent to=20

"Thy young warriors." They are like the dew sparkling in infinite globelets=
 on every blade of grass,=20

hanging gems on every bit of dead wood, formed in secret silence, reflectin=
g the sunlight, and,=20

187    BARBOX BROTHERS   I   "Guard!  What place is this?"  "Mugby Junction=
, sir."  "A windy=20

place!"  "Yes, it mostly is, sir."  "And looks comfortless indeed!"  "Yes, =
it generally does, sir."  "Is it=20

a rainy night still?"  "Pours, sir."  "Open the door.  I'll get out."  "You=
'll have, sir," said the guard,=20

glistening with drops of wet, and looking at the tearful face of his watch =
by the light of his lantern=20

as the traveller descended, "three minutes here."  "More, I think.--For I a=
m not going on."=20



"Thought you had a through ticket, sir?"  "So I have, but I shall sacrifice=
 the rest of it.  I want my=20

luggage."  "Please to come to the van and point it out, sir.  Be good enoug=
h to look very sharp, sir.=20

Not a moment to spare."  The guard hurried to the luggage van, and the trav=
eller hurried after him.=20

The guard got into it, and the traveller looked into it.  "Those two large =
black portmanteaus in the=20

corner where your light shines.  Those are mine."  "Name upon 'em, sir?"  "=
Barbox Brothers."=20

"Stand clear, sir, if you please.  One.  Two.  Right!"  Lamp waved.  Signal=
 lights ahead already=20

changing.  Shriek from engine. Train gone.  "Mugby Junction!" said the trav=
eller, pulling up the=20

woollen muffler round his throat with both hands.  "At past three o'clock o=
f a tempestuous morning!=20

So!"  He spoke to himself.  There was no one else to speak to.  Perhaps, th=
ough there had been=20

any one else to speak to, he would have preferred to speak to himself.  Spe=
aking to himself, he=20

spoke to a man within five years of fifty either way, who had turned grey t=
oo soon, like a neglected=20

fire; a man of pondering habit, brooding carriage of the head, and suppress=
ed internal voice; a=20

man with many indications on him of having been much alone.  He stood unnot=
iced on the dreary=20

platform, except by the rain and by the wind.  Those two vigilant assailant=
s made a rush at him.=20

"Very well," said he, yielding.  "It signifies nothing to me, to what quart=
er I turn my face."  Thus, at=20

Mugby Junction, at past three o'clock of a tempestuous morning, the travell=
er went where the=20

weather drove him.  Not but what he could make a stand when he was so minde=
d, for, coming to=20

the end of the roofed shelter (it is of considerable extent at Mugby Juncti=
on) and looking out upon=20

the dark night, with a yet darker spirit-wing of storm beating its wild way=
 through it, he faced about,=20

and held his own as ruggedly in the difficult direction, as he had held it =
in the easier one.  Thus,=20

with a steady step, the traveller went up and down, up and down, up and dow=
n, seeking nothing,=20

and finding it.  A place replete with shadowy shapes, this Mugby Junction i=
n the black hours of the=20

four-and-twenty.  Mysterious goods trains, covered with palls and gliding o=
n like vast weird=20

funerals, conveying themselves guiltily away from the presence of the few l=
ighted lamps, as if their=20

freight had come to a secret and unlawful end.  Half miles of coal pursuing=
 in a Detective manner,=20

following when they lead, stopping when they stop, backing when they back. =
 Red hot embers=20

showering out upon the ground, down this dark avenue, and down the other, a=
s if torturing fires=20

were being raked clear; concurrently, shrieks and groans and grinds invadin=
g the ear, as if the=20

tortured were at the height of their suffering.  Iron-barred cages full of =
cattle jangling by midway,=20

the drooping beasts with horns entangled, eyes frozen with terror, and mout=
hs too: at least they=20

have long icicles (or what seem so) hanging from their lips.  Unknown langu=
ages in the air,=20

conspiring in red, green, and white characters.  An earthquake accompanied =
with thunder and=20

lightning, going up express to London.  Now, all quiet, all rusty, wind and=
 rain in possession, lamps=20

extinguished, Mugby Junction dead and indistinct, with its robe drawn over =
its head, like Caesar.=20

Now, too, as the belated traveller plodded up and down, a shadowy train wen=
t by him in the gloom=20

which was no other than the train of a life.  From whatsoever intangible de=
ep cutting or dark tunnel=20

it emerged, here it came, unsummoned and unannounced, stealing upon him and=
 passing away=20

into obscurity.  Here, mournfully went by, a child who had never had a chil=
dhood or known a=20

parent, inseparable from a youth with a bitter sense of his namelessness, c=
oupled to a man the=20

enforced business of whose best years had been distasteful and oppressive, =
linked to an=20

ungrateful friend, dragging after him a woman once beloved.  Attendant, wit=
h many a clank and=20

wrench, were lumbering cares, dark meditations, huge dim disappointments, m=
onotonous years, a=20



long jarring line of the=20


_
freshening the thirsty world. So, formed by an unseen and mysterious power,=
 one by one=20

insignificant, but in the whole mighty, mirroring God and quickening and be=
autifying the worn=20

world, the servants of the priest-king are to be "in the midst of many peop=
le like the dew from the=20

Lord."  [U] The word translated "power" in our version, has the same double=
 meaning as that has=20

in old English, or as "force" has now, sometimes signifying "strength" and =
sometimes an "army."=20

The latter is the more appropriate here. "The day of Thine army" will then =
be equivalent to the day=20

of mustering the troops.  Another solemn word from the lips of God begins t=
he second half of the=20

psalm. "Jehovah swears," gives the sanction and guarantee of His own nature=
, puts in pledge His=20

own being for the fulfilment of the promise. And that which He swears is a =
new thing in the earth.=20

The blending of the royal and priestly offices in the Messiah, and the eter=
nal duration in Him of=20

both, is a distinct advancement in the development of Messianic prophecy. T=
he historical occasion=20

for it may indeed be connected with David's kingship and conquest of Melchi=
zedek's city; but the=20

real source of it is a direct predictive inspiration. We have here not mere=
ly the devout psalmist=20

meditating on the truths revealed before his day, but the prophet receiving=
 a new word from God=20

unheard by mortal ears, and far transcending even the promises made to him =
by Nathan. There is=20

but one person to whom it can apply, who sits as a priest upon his throne, =
who builds the temple=20

of the Lord (Zech. vi. 12, 13).  As the former Divine word, so this is foll=
owed by the prophet's=20

rapturous answer, which carries on the portraiture of the priest-king. Ther=
e is some doubt as to the=20

person addressed in these later verses. "The Lord at thy right hand crushes=
 kings in the day of His=20

wrath." Whose right hand? The answer generally given is, "The Messiah's." W=
ho is the Lord that=20

smites the petty kinglets of earth? The answer generally given is, "God." B=
ut it is far more=20

dramatic, avoids an awkward abruptness in the change of persons in the last=
 verse, and brings out=20

a striking contrast with the previous half, if we take the opposite view, a=
nd suppose Jehovah=20

addressed and the Messiah spoken of throughout. Then the first Divine word =
is followed by the=20

prophetic invocation of the exalted Messiah throned at the right hand and e=
xpecting till His=20

enemies be made His footstool. The second is followed by the prophetic invo=
cation of Jehovah,=20

and describes the Lord Messiah at God's right hand as before, but instead o=
f longer waiting He=20

now flames forth in all the resistless energy of a conqueror. The day of Hi=
s array is succeeded by=20

the day of His wrath. He crushes earth's monarchies. The psalmist's eye see=
s the whole earth one=20

great battle-field. "(It is) full of corpses. He wounds the head over wide =
lands," where there may=20

possibly be a reference to the first vague dawning of a hope which God's me=
rcy had let lighten on=20

man's horizon--"He shall bruise thy head," or the word may be used as a col=
lective expression for=20

rulers, as the parallelism with the previous verse requires. Thus striding =
on to victory across the=20

prostrate foe, and pursuing the flying relics of their power, "He drinks of=
 the brook in the way,=20

therefore shall He lift up the head," words which are somewhat difficult, h=
owever interpreted. If,=20

with the majority of modern commentators, we take them as a picturesque emb=
odiment of eager=20

haste in the pursuit, the conqueror "faint, yet pursuing," and stooping for=
 a moment to drink, then=20

hurrying on with renewed strength after the fugitives, one can scarcely hel=
p feeling that such a=20

close to such a psalm is trivial and liker the artificial play of fancy tha=
n the work of the prophetic=20

spirit, to say nothing of the fact that there is nothing about pursuit in t=
he psalm. If we fall back on=20

the older interpretation, which sees in the words a prophecy of the sufferi=
ngs of the Messiah who=20

tastes death and drinks of the cup of sorrows, and therefore is highly exal=
ted, we get a meaning=20



which worthily crowns the psalm, but seems to break somewhat abruptly the s=
equence of thought,=20

and to force the metaphor of drinking of the brook into somewhat strained p=
arallelism with the very=20

different New Testament images just named. But the doubt we must leave over=
 these final words=20

does not diminish the preciousness of this psalm as a clear, articulate pro=
phecy from David's lips=20

of David's Son, whom he had learned to know through the experiences and fac=
ts of his own life.=20

He had climbed through sufferings to his throne. God had exalted him and gi=
ven him victory, and=20

surrounded him with a loyal people. But he was only a shadow; limitations a=
nd imperfections=20

surrounded his office and weakened himself; half of the Divine counsel of p=
eace could not be=20

mirrored in his functions at all, and death lay ahead of him. So his glory =
and his feebleness alike=20

taught him that "one mightier than" he must be coming behind him, "the latc=
het of whose shoes he=20

was not worthy to unloose"--the true King of Israel, to bear witness to who=
m was his highest=20

honour.  The third characteristic of the first seventeen years of David's r=
eign is his successful wars=20

with surrounding nations. The gloomy days of defeat and subjugation which h=
ad darkened the=20

closing years of Saul are over now, and blow after blow falls with stunning=
 rapidity on the amazed=20

enemies. The narrative almost pants for breath as it tells with hurry and p=
ride how, south, and=20

east, and north, the "lion of the tribe of Judah" sprang from his fastness,=
 and smote Philistia,=20

Edom, Moab, Ammon, Amalek, Damascus, and the Syrians beyond, even to the Eu=
phrates; and=20

the bounding courage of king and people, and the unity of heart and hand wi=
th which they stood=20

shoulder to shoulder in many a bloody field, ring through the psalms of thi=
s period. Whatever=20

higher meaning may be attached to them, their roots are firm in the soil of=
 actual history, and they=20

are first of all the war-songs of a nation. That being so, that they should=
 also be inspired hymns for=20

the church in all ages will present no difficulty nor afford any consecrati=
on to modern warfare, if the=20

progressive character of revelation be duly kept in mind. There is a whole =
series of such psalms,=20

such as xx., xxi., lx., and probably lxviii. We cannot venture in our limit=
ed space on any analysis of=20

the last of these. It is a splendid burst of national triumph and devout pr=
aise, full of martial ardour,=20

throbbing with lofty consciousness of God's dwelling in Israel, abounding w=
ith allusions to the=20

ancient victories of the people, and world-wide in its anticipations of fut=
ure triumph. How strange=20

the history of its opening words has been! Through the battle smoke of how =
many a field they have=20

rung! On the plains of the Palatinate, from the lips of Cromwell's Ironside=
s, and from the poor=20

peasants that went to death on many a bleak moor for Christ's crown and cov=
enant, to the Doric=20

music of their rude chant--    "Let God arise, and scattered     Let all Hi=
s enemies be;   And let all=20

those that do Him hate,     Before His presence flee."  The sixtieth psalm =
is assigned to David after=20

Joab's signal victory over the Edomites (2 Sam. viii.). It agrees very well=
 with that date, though the=20

earlier verses have a wailing tone so deep over recent disasters, so great =
that one is almost=20

inclined to suppose that they come from a later hand than his. But after th=
e first verses all is=20

warlike energy and triumph. How the glad thought of ruling over a united pe=
ople dances in the=20

swift words, "I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valle=
y of Succoth;" he has, as it=20

were, repeated Joshua's conquest and division of the land, and the ancient =
historical sites that fill=20

a conspicuous place in the history of his great ancestor are in his power. =
"Gilead is mine, and=20

Manasseh is mine, Ephraim also is the defence of my  "--Yours, sir?"  The t=
raveller recalled his=20

eyes from the waste into which they had been staring, and fell back a step =
or so under the=20

abruptness, and perhaps the chance appropriateness, of the question.  "O!  =
My thoughts were not=20



here for the moment.  Yes.  Yes.  Those two portmanteaus are mine.  Are you=
 a Porter?"  "On=20

Porter's wages, sir.  But I am Lamps."  The traveller looked a little confu=
sed.  "Who did you say=20

you are?"  "Lamps, sir," showing an oily cloth in his hand, as further expl=
anation.  "Surely, surely.=20

Is there any hotel or tavern here?"  "Not exactly here, sir.  There is a Re=
freshment Room here,=20

but--"  Lamps, with a mighty serious look, gave his head a warning roll tha=
t plainly added--"but it's=20

a blessed circumstance for you that it's not open."  "You couldn't recommen=
d it, I see, if it was=20

available?"  "Ask your pardon, sir.  If it was--?"  "Open?"  "It ain't my p=
lace, as a paid servant of the=20

company to give my opinion on any of the company's toepics," he pronounced =
it more like=20

toothpicks, "beyond lamp-ile and cottons," returned Lamps, in a confidentia=
l tone; "but speaking as=20

a man, I wouldn't recommend my father (if he was to come to life again) to =
go and try how he'd be=20

treated at the Refreshment Room. Not speaking as a man, no, I would _not_."=
  The traveller=20

nodded conviction.  "I suppose I can put up in the town? There is a town he=
re?"  For the traveller=20

(though a stay-at-home compared with most travellers) had been, like many o=
thers, carried on the=20

steam winds and the iron tides through that Junction before, without having=
 ever, as one might=20

say, gone ashore there.  "O yes, there's a town, sir.  Anyways there's town=
 enough to put up in.=20

But," following the glance of the other at his luggage, "this is a very dea=
d time of the night with us,=20

sir.  The deadest time.  I might a'most call it our deadest and buriedest t=
ime."  "No porters about?"=20

"Well, sir, you see," returned Lamps, confidential again, "they in general =
goes off with the gas.=20

That's how it is.  And they seem to have overlooked you, through your walki=
ng to the furder end of=20

the platform. But in about twelve minutes or so, she may be up."  "Who may =
be up?"  "The three=20

forty-two, sir.  She goes off in a sidin' till the Up X passes, and then sh=
e," here an air of hopeful=20

vagueness pervaded Lamps, "doos all as lays in her power."  "I doubt if I c=
omprehend the=20

arrangement."  "I doubt if anybody do, sir.  She's a Parliamentary, sir.  A=
nd, you see, a=20

Parliamentary, or a Skirmishun--"  "Do you mean an Excursion?"  "That's it,=
 sir.--A Parliamentary,=20

or a Skirmishun, she mostly _doos_ go off into a sidin'.  But when she _can=
_ get a chance, she's=20

whistled out of it, and she's whistled up into doin' all as," Lamps again w=
ore the air of a highly=20

sanguine man who hoped for the best, "all as lays in her power."  He then e=
xplained that porters=20

on duty being required to be in attendance on the Parliamentary matron in q=
uestion, would=20

doubtless turn up with the gas.  In the meantime, if the gentleman would no=
t very much object to=20

the smell of lamp-oil, and would accept the warmth of his little room.--The=
 gentleman being by this=20

time very cold, instantly closed with the proposal.  A greasy little cabin =
it was, suggestive to the=20

sense of smell, of a cabin in a Whaler.  But there was a bright fire burnin=
g in its rusty grate, and on=20

the floor there stood a wooden stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps, re=
ady for carriage=20

service.  They made a bright show, and their light, and the warmth, account=
ed for the popularity of=20

the room, as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on =
a form by the fire,=20

and many rounded smears and smudges of stooping velveteen shoulders on the =
adjacent wall.=20

Various untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and oil-cans, and a=
lso a fragrant=20

collection of what looked like the pocket-handkerchiefs of the whole lamp f=
amily.  As Barbox=20

Brothers (so to call the traveller on the warranty of his luggage) took his=
 seat upon the form, and=20

warmed his now ungloved hands at the fire, he glanced aside at a little dea=
l desk, much blotched=20

with ink, which his elbow touched.  Upon it, were some scraps of coarse pap=
er, and a=20

superannuated steel pen in very reduced and gritty circumstances.  From gla=
ncing at the scraps of=20



paper, he turned involuntarily to his host, and said, with some roughness--=
  "Why, you are never a=20

poet, man!"  Lamps had certainly not the conventional appearance of one, as=
 he stood modestly=20

rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so exceedingly oily, that he mig=
ht have been in the act=20

of mistaking himself for one of his charges.  He was a spare man of about t=
he Barbox Brothers'=20

time of life, with his features whimsically drawn upward as if they were at=
tracted by the roots of his=20

hair.  He had a peculiarly shining transparent complexion, probably occasio=
ned by constant=20

oleaginous application; and his attractive hair, being cut short, and being=
 grizzled, and standing=20

straight up on end as if it in its turn were attracted by some invisible ma=
gnet above it, the top of his=20

head was not very unlike a lamp-wick.  "But to be sure it's no business of =
mine," said Barbox=20

Brothers.  "That was an impertinent observation on my part.  Be what you li=
ke."  "Some people,=20

sir," remarked Lamps, in a tone of apology, "are sometimes what they don't =
like."  "Nobody knows=20

that better than I do," sighed the other.  "I have been what I don't like, =
all my life."  "When I first=20

took, sir," resumed Lamps, "to composing little Comic-Songs-like--"  Barbox=
 Brothers eyed him=20

with great disfavour.  "--To composing little Comic-Songs-like--and what wa=
s more hard--to singing=20

'em afterwards," said Lamps, "it went against the grain at that time, it di=
d indeed."  Something that=20

was not all oil here shining in Lamps's eye, Barbox Brothers withdrew his o=
wn a little disconcerted,=20

looked at the fire, and put a foot on the top bar.  "Why did you do it, the=
n?" he asked, after a short=20

pause; abruptly enough but in a softer tone.  "If you didn't want to do it,=
 why did you do it?  Where=20

did you sing them?  Public-house?"  To which Mr. Lamps returned the curious=
 reply: "Bedside."  At=20

this moment, while the traveller looked at him for elucidation, Mugby Junct=
ion started suddenly,=20

trembled violently, and opened its gas eyes. "She's got up!" Lamps announce=
d, excited.  "What=20

lays in her power is sometimes more, and sometimes less; but it's laid in h=
er power to get up to-

night, by George!"  The legend "Barbox Brothers" in large white letters on =
two black surfaces, was=20

very soon afterwards trundling on a truck through a silent street, and, whe=
n the owner of the=20

legend had shivered on the pavement half an hour, what time the porter's kn=
ocks at the Inn Door=20

knocked up the whole town first, and the Inn last, he groped his way into t=
he close air of a shut-up=20

house, and so groped between the sheets of a shut-up bed that seemed to hav=
e been expressly=20

refrigerated for him when last made.    II   "You remember me, Young Jackso=
n?"  "What do I=20

remember if not you?  You are my first remembrance.  It was you who told me=
 that was my name.=20

It was you who told me that on every twentieth of December my life had a pe=
nitential anniversary=20

in it called a birthday.  I suppose the last communication was truer than t=
he first!"  "What am I like,=20

Young Jackson?"  "You are like a blight all through the year, to me.  You h=
ard-lined, thin-lipped,=20

repressive, changeless woman with a wax mask on.  You are like the Devil to=
 me; most of all when=20

you teach me religious things, for you make me abhor them."  "You remember =
me, Mr. Young=20

Jackson?"  In another voice from another quarter.  "Most gratefully, sir.  =
You were the ray of hope=20

and prospering ambition in my life.  When I attended your course, I believe=
d that I should come to=20

be a great healer, and I felt almost happy--even though I was still the one=
 boarder in the house=20

with that horrible mask, and ate=20


_
pastoral uplands across the Jordan, whose inhabitants had been but loosely =
attached to the=20

western portion of the nation, and triumphs in knowing that Gilead and Mana=
sseh own his sway.=20

The foremost tribes on this side the river are to him like the armour and e=
quipments of a=20

conqueror; he wears the might of Ephraim, the natural head of the northern =
region, as his helmet,=20

and he grasps the power of Judah as his baton of command or sceptre of king=
ly rule (Gen. xlix.=20

10).  Thus, strong in the possession of a united kingdom, his flashing eye =
turns to his enemies,=20

and a stern joy, mingled with contempt, blazes up as he sees them reduced t=
o menial offices and=20

trembling before him. "Moab (is) my washing-basin; to Edom will I fling my =
shoe; because of me,=20

Philistia, cry out" (in fear). The three ancestral foes that hung on Israel=
's southern border from east=20

to west are subdued. He will make of one "a vessel of dishonour" to wash hi=
s feet, soiled with=20

battle; he will throw his shoes to another the while, as one would to a sla=
ve to take care of; and the=20

third, expecting a like fate, shrieks out in fear of the impending vengeanc=
e. He pants for new=20

victories, "Who will bring me into (the) strong city?" probably the yet uns=
ubdued Petra, hidden=20

away in its tortuous ravine, with but one perilous path through the gorge. =
And at last all the triumph=20

of victory rises to a higher region of thought in the closing words, which =
lay bare the secret of his=20

strength, and breathe the true spirit of the soldier of Jehovah. "In God we=
 shall do valiantly; and=20

He, even He, shall tread down our enemies."  The twentieth psalm, another o=
f these stirring war-

songs, is in that choral manner which we have already seen in psalm xxiv., =
and the adoption of=20

which was probably connected with David's careful organization of "the serv=
ice of song." It is all=20

ablaze with the light of battle and the glow of loyal love.  The army, read=
y drawn up for action, as=20

we may fancy, prays for the king, who, according to custom, brings sacrific=
es and offerings before=20

the fight. "Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of=
 Jacob defend thee,=20

send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion, remembe=
r all thine offerings,=20

and accept thy burnt sacrifice." Then, as they wave their standards in the =
sunshine, or plant before=20

the ranks of each tribe its cognizance, to be defended to the death, the ho=
arse shout rises from=20

the files, "In the name of our God we will set up (or wave) our banners." T=
hen the single voice of=20

the king speaks, rejoicing in his soldiers' devotion, which he accepts as a=
n omen that his sacrifice=20

has not been in vain: "Now know I that Jehovah saveth His anointed. He will=
 hear him from the=20

heaven of His holiness with the strength of the salvation of His right hand=
;" not merely from a God=20

dwelling in Zion, according to language of the previous prayer, but from in=
 silence and constraint=20

with the mask before me, every day.  As I had done every, every, every day,=
 through my school-

time and from my earliest recollection."  "What am I like, Mr. Young Jackso=
n?"  "You are like a=20

Superior Being to me.  You are like Nature beginning to reveal herself to m=
e.  I hear you again, as=20

one of the hushed crowd of young men kindling under the power of your prese=
nce and knowledge,=20

and you bring into my eyes the only exultant tears that ever stood in them.=
"  "You remember Me,=20

Mr. Young Jackson?"  In a grating voice from quite another quarter.  "Too w=
ell.  You made your=20

ghostly appearance in my life one day, and announced that its course was to=
 be suddenly and=20

wholly changed.  You showed me which was my wearisome seat in the Galley of=
 Barbox Brothers.=20

(When _they_ were, if they ever were, is unknown to me; there was nothing o=
f them but the name=20

when I bent to the oar.)  You told me what I was to do, and what to be paid=
; you told me=20

afterwards, at intervals of years, when I was to sign for the Firm, when I =
became a partner, when I=20

became the Firm.  I know no more of it, or of myself."  "What am I like, Mr=
. Young Jackson?"  "You=20



are like my father, I sometimes think.  You are hard enough and cold enough=
 so to have brought=20

up an unacknowledged son.  I see your scanty figure, your close brown suit,=
 and your tight brown=20

wig; but you, too, wear a wax mask to your death.  You never by a chance re=
move it--it never by a=20

chance falls off--and I know no more of you."  Throughout this dialogue, th=
e traveller spoke to=20

himself at his window in the morning, as he had spoken to himself at the Ju=
nction over-night.  And=20

as he had then looked in the darkness, a man who had turned grey too soon, =
like a neglected fire:=20

so he now looked in the sunlight, an ashier grey, like a fire which the bri=
ghtness of the sun put out.=20

The firm of Barbox Brothers had been some offshoot or irregular branch of t=
he Public Notary and=20

bill-broking tree.  It had gained for itself a griping reputation before th=
e days of Young Jackson,=20

and the reputation had stuck to it and to him.  As he had imperceptibly com=
e into possession of=20

the dim den up in the corner of a court off Lombard-street, on whose grimy =
windows the inscription=20

Barbox Brothers had for many long years daily interposed itself between him=
 and the sky, so he=20

had insensibly found himself a personage held in chronic distrust, whom it =
was essential to screw=20

tight to every transaction in which he engaged, whose word was never to be =
taken without his=20

attested bond, whom all dealers with openly set up guards and wards against=
.  This character had=20

come upon him through no act of his own.  It was as if the original Barbox =
had stretched himself=20

down upon the office-floor, and had thither caused to be conveyed Young Jac=
kson in his sleep,=20

and had there effected a metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him.  =
The=20


_
the Lord in the heavens, will the strength come. Then again the chorus of t=
he host exclaims, as=20

they look across the field to the chariots and cavalry of the foe--forces w=
hich Israel seldom used--

"These (boast[V]) of chariots, and those of horses, and we, of the name of =
Jehovah, our God, do=20

we boast." Ere a sword has been drawn, they see the enemy scattered. "They =
are brought down=20

and fallen; and we, we are risen and stand upright." Then one earnest cry t=
o God, one more=20

thought of the true monarch of Israel, whom David would teach them to feel =
he only shadowed;=20

and with the prayer, "Jehovah! save! Let the King hear us in the day when w=
e cry," ringing like the=20

long trumpet blast that sounds for the charge, they dash forth to victory! =
 [V] Lit. "make mention of"=20

or "commemorate."     XIII.--THE TEARS OF THE PENITENT.   Adversity had tau=
ght David self-

restraint, had braced his soul, had driven him to grasp firmly the hand of =
God. And prosperity had=20

seemed for nearly twenty years but to perfect the lessons. Gratitude had fo=
llowed deliverance, and=20

the sunshine after the rain had brought out the fragrance of devotion and t=
he blossoms of glad=20

songs. A good man, and still more a man of David's age at the date of his g=
reat crime, seldom falls=20

so low, unless there has been previous, perhaps unconscious, relaxation of =
the girded loins, and=20

negligence of the untrimmed lamp. The sensitive nature of the psalmist was =
indeed not unlikely to=20

yield to the sudden force of such a temptation as conquered him, but we can=
 scarcely conceive of=20

its having done so without a previous decay of his religious life, hidden m=
ost likely from himself.=20

And the source of that decay may probably be found in self-indulgence, fost=
ered by ease, and by=20

long years of command. The actual fall into sin seems to have been begun by=
 slothful abdication=20

of his functions as captain of Israel. It is perhaps not without bitter emp=
hasis that the narrative=20

introduces it by telling us that, "at the time when kings go forth to battl=
e," David contented himself=20

with sending his troops against Ammon, and "tarried still at Jerusalem." At=
 all events, the story=20

brings into sharp contrast the levy _en masse_, encamped round Rabbath, and=
 their natural head,=20

who had once been so ready to take his share of blows and privations, loite=
ring behind, taking his=20

quiet siesta in the hot hours after noon, as if there had been no soldiers =
of his sweltering in their=20

armour, and rising from his bed to stroll on his palace roof, and peer into=
 the household privacies=20

below, as if his heart had no interest in the grim tussle going on behind t=
he hills that he could=20

almost see from his height, as they grew purple in the evening twilight. He=
 has fallen to the level of=20

an Eastern despot, and has lost his sense of the responsibilities of his of=
fice. Such loosening of=20

the tension of his moral nature as is indicated in his absence from the fie=
ld, during what was=20

evidently a very severe as well as a long struggle, prepared the way for th=
e dismal headlong=20

plunge into sin.  The story is told in all its hideousness, without palliat=
ion or reserve, without=20

comment or heightening, in that stern judicial fashion so characteristic of=
 the Bible records of its=20

greatest characters. Every step is narrated without a trace of softening, a=
nd without a word of=20

emotion. Not a single ugly detail is spared. The portraiture is as vivid as=
 ever. Bathsheba's willing=20

complicity, her punctilious observance of ceremonial propriety while she is=
 trampling under foot=20

her holiest obligations; the fatal necessity which drags sin after sin, and=
 summons up murder to=20

hide, if it be possible, the foul form of adultery; the stinging rebuke in =
the conduct of Uriah, who,=20

Hittite as he was, has a more chivalrous, not to say devout, shrinking from=
 personal ease while his=20

comrades and the ark are in the field, than the king has; the mean treason,=
 the degradation=20

implied in getting into Joab's power; the cynical plainness of the murderou=
s letter, in which a=20

hardened conscience names his purposed evil by its true name; the contemptu=
ous measure of his=20



master which Joab takes in his message, the king's indifference to the loss=
 of his men so long as=20

Uriah is out of the way; the solemn platitudes with which he pretends to co=
nsole his tool for the=20

check of his troops; and the hideous haste with which, after her scrupulous=
 "mourning" for one=20

week, Bathsheba threw herself again into David's arms;--all these particula=
rs, and every particular=20

an aggravation, stand out for ever, as men's most hidden evil will one day =
do, in the clear,=20

unpitying, unmistakable light of the Divine record. What a story it is!  Th=
is saint of nearly fifty years=20

of age, bound to God by ties which he rapturously felt and acknowledged, wh=
ose words have been=20

the very breath of devotion for every devout heart, forgets his longings af=
ter righteousness, flings=20

away the joys of Divine communion, darkens his soul, ends his prosperity, b=
rings down upon his=20

head for all his remaining years a cataract of calamities, and makes his na=
me and his religion a=20

target for the barbed sarcasms of each succeeding generation of scoffers. "=
All the fences and their=20

whole its turn by the deceit of the only woman he had ever loved, and the d=
eceit of the only friend=20

he had ever made: who eloped from him to be married together--the discovery=
, so followed up,=20

completed what his earliest rearing had begun.  He shrank, abashed, within =
the form of Barbox,=20

and lifted up his head and heart no more.  But he did at last effect one gr=
eat release in his=20

condition.  He broke the oar he had plied so long, and he scuttled and sank=
 the galley.  He=20

prevented the gradual retirement of an old conventional business from him, =
by taking the initiative=20

and retiring from it.  With enough to live on (though after all with not to=
o much), he obliterated the=20

firm of Barbox Brothers from the pages of the Post-office Directory and the=
 face of the earth,=20

leaving nothing of it but its name on two portmanteaus.  "For one must have=
 some name in going=20

about, for people to pick up," he explained to Mugby High-street, through t=
he Inn-window, "and=20

that name at least was real once.  Whereas, Young Jackson!--Not to mention =
its being a sadly=20

satirical misnomer for Old Jackson."  He took up his hat and walked out, ju=
st in time to see,=20

passing along on the opposite side of the way, a velveteen man, carrying hi=
s day's dinner in a=20

small bundle that might have been larger without suspicion of gluttony, and=
 pelting away towards=20

the Junction at a great pace.  "There's Lamps!" said Barbox Brother.  "And =
by-the-by--"=20

Ridiculous, surely, that a man so serious, so self-contained, and not yet t=
hree days emancipated=20

from a routine of drudgery, should stand rubbing his chin in the street, in=
 a brown study about=20

Comic Songs.  "Bedside?" said Barbox Brothers, testily.  "Sings them at the=
 bedside? Why at the=20

bedside, unless he goes to bed drunk?  Does, I shouldn't wonder.  But it's =
no business of mine.=20

Let me see.  Mugby Junction, Mugby Junction.  Where shall I go next?  As it=
 came into my head=20

last night when I woke from an uneasy sleep in the carriage and found mysel=
f here, I can go=20

anywhere from here.  Where shall I go?  I'll go and look at the Junction by=
 daylight.  There's no=20

hurry, and I may like the look of one Line better than another."  But there=
 were so many Lines.=20

Gazing down upon them from a bridge at the Junction, it was as if the conce=
ntrating Companies=20

formed a great Industrial Exhibition of the works of extraordinary ground-s=
piders that spun iron.=20

And then so many of the Lines went such wonderful ways, so crossing and cur=
ving among one=20

another, that the eye lost them.  And then some of them appeared to start w=
ith the fixed intention=20

of going five hundred miles, and all of a sudden gave it up at an insignifi=
cant barrier, or turned off=20

into a workshop.  And then others, like intoxicated men, went a little way =
very straight, and=20

surprisingly slued round and came back again.  And then others were so choc=
k-full of trucks of=20

coal, others were so blocked with trucks of casks, others were so gorged wi=
th trucks of ballast,=20



others were so set apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cotton-reels=
: while others were so=20

bright and clear, and others were so delivered over to rust and ashes and i=
dle wheelbarrows out of=20

work, with their legs in the air (looking much like their masters on strike=
), that there was no=20

beginning, middle, or end, to the bewilderment.  Barbox Brothers stood puzz=
led on the bridge,=20

passing his right hand across the lines on his forehead, which multiplied w=
hile he looked down, as=20

if the railway Lines were getting themselves photographed on that sensitive=
 plate.  Then, was=20

heard a distant ringing of bells and blowing of whistles.  Then, puppet-loo=
king heads of men=20

popped out of boxes in perspective, and popped in again.  Then, prodigious =
wooden razors set up=20

on end, began shaving the atmosphere.  Then, several locomotive engines in =
several directions=20

began to scream and be agitated.  Then, along one avenue a train came in.  =
Then, along another=20

two trains appeared that didn't come in, but stopped without.  Then, bits o=
f trains broke off. Then, a=20

struggling horse became involved with them.  Then, the locomotives shared t=
he bits of trains, and=20

ran away with the whole.  "I have not made my next move much clearer by thi=
s.  No hurry.  No=20

need to make up my mind to-day, or to-morrow, nor yet the day after.  I'll =
take a walk."  It fell out=20

somehow (perhaps he meant it should) that the walk tended to the platform a=
t which he had=20

alighted, and to Lamps's room.  But Lamps was not in his room.  A pair of v=
elveteen shoulders=20

were adapting themselves to one of the impressions on the wall by Lamps's f=
ireplace, but=20

otherwise the room was void.  In passing back to get out of the station aga=
in, he learnt the cause=20

of this vacancy, by catching sight of Lamps on the opposite line of railway=
, skipping along the top=20

of a train, from carriage to carriage, and catching lighted namesakes throw=
n up to him by a=20

coadjutor.  "He is busy.  He has not much time for composing or singing Com=
ic Songs this=20

morning, I take it."  The direction he pursued now, was into the country, k=
eeping very near to the=20

side of one great Line of railway, and within easy view of others. "I have =
half a mind," he said,=20

glancing around, "to=20


_
and his own past had reared, "one cunning sin sweeps quite away." Every obl=
igation of his office,=20

as every grace of his character, is trodden under foot by the wild beast ro=
used in his breast. As=20

man, as king, as soldier, he is found wanting. Lust and treason, and craft =
and murder, are goodly=20

companions for him who had said, "I will walk within my house with a perfec=
t heart. I will set no=20

wicked thing before mine eyes." Why should we dwell on the wretched story? =
Because it teaches=20

us, as no other page in the history of God's church does, how the alchemy o=
f Divine love can=20

extract sweet perfumes of penitence and praise out of the filth of sin; and=
 therefore, though we=20

turn with loathing from David's sin, we have to bless God for the record of=
 it, and for the lessons of=20

hope that come from David's pardon.  To many a sin-tortured soul since then=
, the two psalms (li.,=20

xxxii.), all blotted with tears, in which he has sobbed out his penitence, =
have been as footsteps in a=20

great and terrible wilderness. They are too familiar to need, and too sacre=
d to bear, many words=20

here, but we may briefly note some points connected with them--especially t=
hose which assist us=20

in forming some image of the psalmist's state of mind after his transgressi=
on. It may be observed=20

that of these two psalms, the fifty-first is evidently earlier than the thi=
rty-second. In the former we=20

see the fallen man struggling up out of the "horrible pit and miry clay;" i=
n the latter he stands upon=20

the rock, with a new song in his mouth, even the blessedness of him "whose =
sin is covered." It=20

appears also that both must be dated after the sharp thrust of God's lancet=
 which Nathan drove=20

into his conscience, and the healing balsam of God's assurance of forgivene=
ss which Nathan laid=20

upon his heart. The passionate cries of the psalm are the echo of the Divin=
e promise--the effort of=20

his faith to grasp and keep the merciful gift of pardon. The consciousness =
of forgiveness is the=20

basis of the prayer for forgiveness.  Somewhere about a year passed between=
 the crime and the=20

message of Nathan. And what sort of a year it was the psalms tell us. The c=
oarse satisfactions of=20

his sin could not long content him, as they might have done a lower type of=
 man. Nobody buys a=20

little passing pleasure in evil at so dear a rate, or keeps it for so short=
 a time as a good man. He=20

cannot make himself as others. "That which cometh into your mind shall not =
be at all, in that ye=20

say, We will be as the families of the nations, which serve wood and stone.=
" Old habits quickly=20

reassert their force, conscience soon lifts again its solemn voice; and whi=
le worse men are=20

enjoying the strong-flavoured meats on sin's table, the servant of God, who=
 has been seduced to=20

prefer them for a moment to the "light bread" from heaven, tastes them alre=
ady bitter in his mouth.=20

He may be far from true repentance, but he will very soon know remorse. Mon=
ths may pass before=20

he can feel again the from this point, by saying, 'I'll take this set of ra=
ils, or that, or t'other, and stick=20

to it.'  They separate themselves from the confusion, out here, and go thei=
r ways."  Ascending a=20

gentle hill of some extent, he came to a few cottages. There, looking about=
 him as a very reserved=20

man might who had never looked about him in his life before, he saw some si=
x or eight young=20

children come merrily trooping and whooping from one of the cottages, and d=
isperse.  But not until=20

they had all turned at the little garden gate, and kissed their hands to a =
face at the upper window:=20

a low window enough, although the upper, for the cottage had but a story of=
 one room above the=20

ground.  Now, that the children should do this was nothing; but that they s=
hould do this to a face=20

lying on the sill of the open window, turned towards them in a horizontal p=
osition, and apparently=20

only a face, was something noticeable.  He looked up at the window again.  =
Could only see a very=20

fragile though a very bright face, lying on one cheek on the window-sill. T=
he delicate smiling face=20

of a girl or woman.  Framed in long bright brown hair, round which was tied=
 a light blue band or=20



fillet, passing under the chin.  He walked on, turned back, passed the wind=
ow again, shyly glanced=20

up again.  No change.  He struck off by a winding branch-road at the top of=
 the hill--which he must=20

otherwise have descended--kept the cottages in view, worked his way round a=
t a distance so as to=20

come out once more into the main road and be obliged to pass the cottages a=
gain.  The face still=20

lay on the window-sill, but not so much inclined towards him.  And now ther=
e were a pair of=20

delicate hands too.  They had the action of performing on some musical inst=
rument, and yet it=20

produced no sound that reached his ears.  "Mugby Junction must be the madde=
st place in=20

England," said Barbox Brothers, pursuing his way down the hill.  "The first=
 thing I find here is a=20

Railway Porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside.  The second=
 thing I find here is=20

a face, and a pair of hands playing a musical instrument that don't play!" =
 The day was a fine bright=20

day in the early beginning of November, the air was clear and inspiriting, =
and the landscape was=20

rich in beautiful colours.  The prevailing colours in the court off Lombard=
-street, London city, had=20

been few and sombre.  Sometimes, when the weather elsewhere was very bright=
 indeed, the=20

dwellers in those tents enjoyed a pepper-and-salt-coloured day or two, but =
their atmosphere's=20

usual wear was slate, or snuff colour.  He relished his walk so well, that =
he repeated it next day.=20

He was a little earlier at the cottage than on the day before, and he could=
 hear the children up-

stairs singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their ha=
nds.  "Still, there is no=20

sound of any musical instrument," he said, listening at the corner, "and ye=
t I saw the performing=20

hands again, as I came by. What are the=20


_
himself and with his sin will quickly fill his soul. No more vivid picture =
of such a state has ever been=20

drawn, than is found in the psalms of this period. They tell of sullen "sil=
ence;" dust had settled on=20

the strings of his harp, as on helmet and sword. He will not speak to God o=
f his sin, and there is=20

nothing else that he can speak of. They tell of his "roaring all the day lo=
ng"--the groan of anguish=20

forced from his yet unsoftened spirit. Day and night God's heavy hand weigh=
ed him down; the=20

consciousness of that power, whose gentleness had once holden him up, crush=
ed, but did not=20

melt him. Like some heated iron, its heaviness scorched as well as bruised,=
 and his moisture--all=20

the dew and freshness of his life--was dried up at its touch and turned int=
o dusty, cracking drought,=20

that chaps the hard earth, and shrinks the streamlets, and burns to brown p=
owder the tender=20

herbage (Ps. xxxii.). Body and mind seem both to be included in this wonder=
ful description, in=20

which obstinate dumbness, constant torture, dread of God, and not one softe=
ning drop of=20

penitence fill the dry and dusty heart, while "bones waxing old," or, as th=
e word might be rendered,=20

"rotting," sleepless nights, and perhaps the burning heat of disease, are h=
inted at as the=20

accompaniments of the soul-agony. It is possible that similar allusions to =
actual bodily illness are=20

to be found in another psalm, probably referring to the same period, and pr=
esenting striking=20

parallelisms of expression (Ps. vi.), "Have mercy upon me, Jehovah, for I l=
anguish (fade away);=20

heal me, for my bones are affrighted. My soul is also sore vexed. I am wear=
y with my groaning;=20

every night make I my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears." The sim=
ilar phrase, too, in=20

psalm fifty-one, "The bones which Thou hast broken," may have a similar app=
lication. Thus, sick in=20

body and soul, he dragged through a weary year--ashamed of his guilty dalli=
ance, wretched in his=20

self-accusations, afraid of God, and skulking in the recesses of his palace=
 from the sight of his=20

people. A goodly price he had sold integrity for. The bread had been sweet =
for a moment, but how=20

quickly his "mouth is filled with gravel" (Proverbs xx. 17). David learned,=
 what we all learn (and the=20

holier a man is, the more speedily and sharply does the lesson follow on th=
e heels of his sin), that=20

every transgression is a blunder, that we never get the satisfaction which =
we expect from any sin,=20

or if we do, we get something with it which spoils it all. A nauseous drug =
is added to the exciting,=20

intoxicating drink which temptation offers, and though its flavour is at fi=
rst disguised by the=20

pleasanter taste of the sin, its bitterness is persistent though slow, and =
clings to the palate long=20

after that has faded utterly.  Into this dreary life Nathan's message comes=
 with merciful rebuke.=20

The prompt severity of David's judgment against the selfish sinner of the i=
nimitable apologue may=20

be a subtle the multiplication-table!"  They were though, and with infinite=
 enjoyment.  The=20

mysterious face had a voice attached to it which occasionally led or set th=
e children right. Its=20

musical cheerfulness was delightful.  The measure at length stopped, and wa=
s succeeded by a=20

murmuring of young voices, and then by a short song which he made out to be=
 about the current=20

month of the year, and about what work it yielded to the labourers in the f=
ields and farm-yards.=20

Then, there was a stir of little feet, and the children came trooping and w=
hooping out, as on the=20

previous day.  And again, as on the previous day, they all turned at the ga=
rden gate, and kissed=20

their hands--evidently to the face on the window-sill, though Barbox Brothe=
rs from his retired post=20

of disadvantage at the corner could not see it.  But as the children disper=
sed, he cut off one small=20

straggler--a brown faced boy with flaxen hair--and said to him:  "Come here=
, little one.  Tell me=20

whose house is that?"  The child, with one swarthy arm held up across his e=
yes, half in shyness,=20

and half ready for defence, said from behind the inside of his elbow:  "Pho=
ebe's."  "And who," said=20



Barbox Brothers, quite as much embarrassed by his part in the dialogue as t=
he child could=20

possibly be by his, "is Phoebe?"  To which the child made answer: "Why, Pho=
ebe, of course."  The=20

small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely, and had taken his=
 moral measure.  He=20

lowered his guard, and rather assumed a tone with him: as having discovered=
 him to be an=20

unaccustomed person in the art of polite conversation.  "Phoebe," said the =
child, "can't be=20

anybobby else but Phoebe.  Can she?"  "No, I suppose not."  "Well," returne=
d the child, "then why=20

did you ask me?"  Deeming it prudent to shift his ground, Barbox Brothers t=
ook up a new position.=20

"What do you do there?  Up there in that room where the open window is. Wha=
t do you do there?"=20

"Cool," said the child.  "Eh?"  "Co-o-ol," the child repeated in a louder v=
oice, lengthening out the=20

word with a fixed look and great emphasis, as much as to say: "What's the u=
se of your having=20

grown up, if you're such a donkey as not to understand me?"  "Ah!  School, =
school," said Barbox=20

Brothers.  "Yes, yes, yes.  And Phoebe teaches you?"  The child nodded.  "G=
ood boy."  "Tound it=20

out, have you?" said the child.  "Yes, I have found it out.  What would you=
 do with twopence, if I=20

gave it you?"  "Pend it."  The knock-down promptitude of this reply leaving=
 him not a leg to stand=20

upon, Barbox Brothers produced the twopence with great lameness, and withdr=
ew in a state of=20

humiliation.  But, seeing the face on the window-sill as he passed the cott=
age, he acknowledged=20

its presence there with a gesture, which was not a nod, not a bow, not a re=
moval of his hat from=20

his head, but was a diffident compromise between or struggle with all three=
.  The eyes in the face=20

seemed amused, or cheered, or both, and the lips modestly said:=20


_
conscience, which fancies some atonement for his own sin in stern repressio=
n of that of others; for=20

consciousness of evil may sometimes sting into harshness as well as soften =
to lenity, and sinful=20

man is a sterner judge than the righteous God. The answer of Nathan is a pe=
rfect example of the=20

Divine way of convincing of sin. There is first the plain charge pressed ho=
me on the individual=20

conscience, "Thou art the man." Then follows, not reproach nor further deep=
ening of the blackness=20

of the deed, but a tender enumeration of God's great benefits, whereon is b=
uilt the solemn=20

question, "Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do =
evil in His sight?"=20

The contemplation of God's faithful love, and of the all-sufficient gifts w=
hich it bestows, makes=20

every transgression irrational as well as ungrateful, and turns remorse, wh=
ich consumes like the=20

hot wind of the wilderness, into tearful repentance which refreshes the sou=
l. When God has been=20

seen loving and bestowing ere He commands and requires, it is profitable to=
 hold the image of the=20

man's evil in all its ugliness close up to his eyes; and so the bald facts =
are repeated next in the=20

fewest, strongest words. Nor can the message close until a rigid law of ret=
ribution has been=20

proclaimed, the slow operation of which will filter bitterness and shame th=
rough all his life. "And=20

David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord." Two words (in the =
Hebrew) make the=20

transition from sullen misery to real though shaded peace. No lengthened ou=
tpouring, no=20

accumulation of self-reproach; he is too deeply moved for many words, which=
 he knows God does=20

not need. More would have been less. All is contained in that one sob, in w=
hich the whole=20

frostwork of these weary months breaks up and rolls away, swept before the =
strong flood. And as=20

brief and simple as the confession, is the response, "And Nathan said unto =
David, The Lord also=20

hath put away thy sin." How full and unconditional the blessing bestowed in=
 these few words; how=20

swift and sufficient the answer! So the long estrangement is ended. Thus si=
mple and Divine is the=20

manner of pardon. In such short compass may the turning point of a life lie=
! But while confession=20

and forgiveness heal the breach between God and David, pardon is not impuni=
ty, and the same=20

sentence which bestows the remission of sin announces the exaction of a pen=
alty. The judgments=20

threatened a moment before--a moment so far removed now to David's consciou=
sness that it=20

would look as if an age had passed--are not withdrawn, and another is added=
, the death of=20

Bathsheba's infant. God loves His servants too well to "suffer sin upon the=
m," and the freest=20

forgiveness and the happiest consciousness of it may consist with the lovin=
g infliction and the=20

submissive bearing of pains, which are no longer the strokes of an avenging=
 judge, but the=20

chastisements of a gracious father.  The fifty-first psalm must, we think, =
be conceived of as=20

following soon after Nathan's mission. There may be echoes of the prophet's=
 stern question,=20

"Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in Hi=
s sight?" and of the=20

confession, "I have sinned against the Lord," in the words, "Against Thee, =
Thee only have I=20

sinned, and done evil in Thy sight" (ver. 4), though perhaps the expression=
s are not so peculiar as=20

to make the allusion certain. But, at all events, the penitence and prayers=
 of the psalm can=20

scarcely be supposed to have preceded the date of the historical narrative,=
 which clearly implies=20

that the rebuke of the seer was the first thing that broke up the dumb mise=
ry of unrepented sin.=20

Although the psalm is one long cry for pardon and restoration, one can disc=
ern an order and=20

progress in its petitions--the order, not of an artificial reproduction of =
a past mood of mind, but the=20

instinctive order in which the emotion of contrite desire will ever pour it=
self forth. In the psalm all=20

begins, as all begins in fact, with the grounding of the cry for favour on =
"Thy loving-kindness," "the=20



multitude of Thy tender mercies;" the one plea that avails with God, whose =
love is its own motive=20

and its own measure, whose past acts are the standard for all His future, w=
hose to you, sir."  "I find=20

I must stick for a time to Mugby Junction," said Barbox Brothers, with much=
 gravity, after once=20

more stopping on his return road to look at the Lines where they went their=
 several ways so=20

quietly.  "I can't make up my mind yet, which iron road to take.  In fact, =
I must get a little=20

accustomed to the Junction before I can decide."  So, he announced at the I=
nn that he was "going=20

to stay on, for the present," and improved his acquaintance with the Juncti=
on that night, and again=20

next morning, and again next night and morning: going down to the station, =
mingling with the=20

people there, looking about him down all the avenues of railway, and beginn=
ing to take an interest=20

in the incomings and outgoings of the trains.  At first, he often put his h=
ead into Lamps's little=20

room, but he never found Lamps there.  A pair or two of velveteen shoulders=
 he usually found=20

there, stooping over the fire, sometimes in connexion with a clasped knife =
and a piece of bread=20

and meat; but the answer to his inquiry, "Where's Lamps?" was, either that =
he was "t'other side the=20

line," or, that it was his off-time, or (in the latter case), his own perso=
nal introduction to another=20

Lamps who was not his Lamps.  However, he was not so desperately set upon s=
eeing Lamps=20

now, but he bore the disappointment.  Nor did he so wholly devote himself t=
o his severe=20

application to the study of Mugby Junction, as to neglect exercise.  On the=
 contrary, he took a walk=20

every day, and always the same walk.  But the weather turned cold and wet a=
gain, and the=20

window was never open.    III   At length, after a lapse of some days, ther=
e came another streak of=20

fine bright hardy autumn weather.  It was a Saturday.  The window was open,=
 and the children=20

were gone.  Not surprising, this, for he had patiently watched and waited a=
t the corner, until they=20

_were_ gone.  "Good day," he said to the face; absolutely getting his hat c=
lear off his head this=20

time.  "Good day to you, sir."  "I am glad you have a fine sky again, to lo=
ok at."  "Thank you, sir.  It=20

is kind of you."  "You are an invalid, I fear?"  "No, sir.  I have very goo=
d health."  "But are you not=20

always lying down?"  "O yes, I am always lying down, because I cannot sit u=
p.  But I am not an=20

invalid."  The laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great mistake.  "Wo=
uld you mind taking the=20

trouble to come in, sir?  There is a beautiful view from this window.  And =
you would see that I am=20

not at all ill--being so good as to care."  It was said to help him, as he =
stood irresolute, but=20

evidently desiring to enter, with his diffident hand on the latch of the ga=
rden gate.  It did help him,=20

and he went in.  The room up-stairs was a very clean white room with a low =
roof.  Its only inmate=20

lay on a couch that brought her face on a level with the window. The couch =
was white too; and her=20

simple dress or wrapper being light blue, like the band around her hair, sh=
e had an ethereal look,=20

and a fanciful appearance of lying among clouds.  He felt that she instinct=
ively perceived him to be=20

by habit a downcast taciturn man; it was another help to him to have establ=
ished that=20

understanding so easily, and got it over.  There was an awkward constraint =
upon him,=20

nevertheless, as he touched her hand, and took a chair at the side of her c=
ouch.  "I see now," he=20

began, not at all fluently, "how you occupy your hands. Only seeing you fro=
m the path outside, I=20

thought you were playing upon something."  She was engaged in very nimbly a=
nd dexterously=20

making lace.  A lace-pillow lay upon her breast; and the quick movements an=
d changes of her=20

hands upon it as she worked, had given them the action he had misinterprete=
d.  "That is curious,"=20

she answered, with a bright smile.  "For I often fancy, myself, that I play=
 tunes while I am at work."=20

"Have you any musical knowledge?"  She shook her head.  "I think I could pi=
ck out tunes, if I had=20



any instrument, which could be made as handy to me as my lace-pillow.  But =
I dare say I deceive=20

myself. At all events, I shall never know."  "You have a musical voice.  Ex=
cuse me; I have heard=20

you sing."  "With the children?" she answered, slightly colouring.  "O yes.=
  I sing with the dear=20

children, if it can be=20


_
more than the sum of our transgressions, though these be "more than the hai=
rs of our head."=20

Beginning with God's mercy, the penitent soul can learn to look next upon i=
ts own sin in all its=20

aspects of evil. The depth and intensity of the psalmist's loathing of self=
 is wonderfully expressed=20

in his words for his crime. He speaks of his "transgressions" and of his "s=
in." Looked at in one=20

way, he sees the separate acts of which he had been guilty--lust, fraud, tr=
eachery, murder: looked=20

at in another, he sees them all knotted together, in one inextricable tangl=
e of forked, hissing=20

tongues, like the serpent locks that coil and twist round a Gorgon  Barbox =
Brothers glanced at the=20

two small forms in the room, and hazarded the speculation that she was fond=
 of children, and that=20

she was learned in new systems of teaching them?  "Very fond of them," she =
said, shaking her=20

head again; "but I know nothing of teaching, beyond the interest I have in =
it, and the pleasure it=20

gives me when they learn.  Perhaps your overhearing my little scholars sing=
 some of their lessons,=20

has led you so far astray as to think me a grand teacher?  Ah! I thought so=
!  No, I have only read=20

and been told about that system.  It seemed so pretty and pleasant, and to =
treat them so like the=20

merry Robins they are, that I=20


_
common root, and the whole is matted together like the green growth on a st=
agnant pond, so that,=20

by whatever filament it is grasped, the whole mass is drawn towards you. An=
d a profound insight=20

into the essence and character of sin lies in the accumulated synonyms. It =
is "transgression," or,=20

as the word might be rendered, "rebellion"--not the mere breach of an imper=
sonal law, not merely=20

an infraction of "the constitution of our nature"--but the rising of a subj=
ect will against its true king,=20

disobedience to a person as well as contravention of a standard. It is "ini=
quity"--perversion or=20

distortion--a word which expresses the same metaphor as is found in many la=
nguages, namely,=20

crookedness as descriptive of deeds which depart from the perfect line of r=
ight. It is "sin," _i.e._,=20

"missing one's aim;" in which profound word is contained the truth that all=
 sin is a blunder,=20

shooting wide of the true goal, if regard be had to the end of our being, a=
nd not less wide if regard=20

be had to our happiness. It ever misses the mark; and the epitaph might be =
written over every=20

sinner who seeks pleasure at the price of righteousness, "Thou fool."  Nor =
less pregnant with=20

meaning is the psalmist's emphatic acknowledgment, "Against Thee, Thee only=
 have I sinned." He=20

is not content with looking upon little way mine is, sir," she added, with =
a glance at the small forms=20

and round the room.  All this time her hands were busy at her lace-pillow. =
 As they still continued=20

so, and as there was a kind of substitute for conversation in the click and=
 play of its pegs, Barbox=20

Brothers took the opportunity of observing her.  He guessed her to be thirt=
y.  The charm of her=20

transparent face and large bright brown eyes, was, not that they were passi=
vely resigned, but that=20

they were actively and thoroughly cheerful. Even her busy hands, which of t=
heir own thinness=20

alone might have besought compassion, plied their task with a gay courage t=
hat made mere=20

compassion an unjustifiable assumption of superiority, and an impertinence.=
  He saw her eyes in=20

the act of rising towards his, and he directed his towards the prospect, sa=
ying: "Beautiful indeed!"=20

"Most beautiful, sir.  I have sometimes had a fancy that I would like to si=
t up, for once, only to try=20

how it looks to an erect head.  But what a foolish fancy that would be to e=
ncourage!  It cannot look=20

more lovely to any one than it does to me."  Her eyes were turned to it as =
she spoke, with most=20

delighted admiration and enjoyment.  There was not a trace in it of any sen=
se of deprivation.  "And=20

those threads of railway, with their puffs of smoke=20
