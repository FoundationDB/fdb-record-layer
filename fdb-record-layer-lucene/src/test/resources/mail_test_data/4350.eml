=80=9CHere is a solitary spot. We shall meet no one. The view is charming, =
and the air is soft.=E2=80=9D And he placed his hand gently on the arm of L=
othair, and, as it were, drew him out of the carriage.  The sun was bright,=
 and _
was a knowledge of the language.  After a delay of some days, I obtained si=
xteen camels from the=20

sheik. I had taken the precaution to provide water-barrels, in addition to =
the usual goat-skins; and,=20

with a trustworthy guide, we quitted Korosko on the 16th May, 1861, and lau=
nched into the desert.=20

The route from Korosko across the Nubian desert cuts off the chord of an ar=
c made by the great=20

westerly bend of the Nile. This chord is about 230 miles in length. Through=
out this barren desert=20

there is no water, except at the half-way station, Moorahd (from moorra, bi=
tter); this, although salt=20

and bitter, is relished by camels. During the hot season in which we unfort=
unately travelled, the=20

heat was intense, the thermometer ranging from 106 degrees to 114 degrees F=
ahr. in the shade.=20

The parching blast of the simoom was of such exhausting power, that the wat=
er rapidly evaporated=20

from the closed water-skins. It was, therefore, necessary to save the suppl=
y by a forced march of=20

seven days, in which period we were to accomplish the distance, and to reac=
h Abou Hammed, on=20

the southern bend of the welcome Nile.  During the cool months, from Novemb=
er until February,=20

the desert journey is not disagreeable; but the vast area of glowing sand e=
xposed to the scorching=20

sun of summer, in addition to the withering breath of the simoom, renders t=
he forced march of 230=20

miles in seven days, at two and a half miles per hour, the most fatiguing j=
ourney that can be=20

endured.  Farewell gushing sounds of heavenly melody. And absorbed in these=
 feelings it was not=20

immediately observed by him that on the altar, behind the dazzling blaze of=
 tapers, was a picture=20

of the Virgin, and identically the same countenance as that he had recogniz=
ed with emotion in the=20

drawing of Raffaelle.  It revived perplexing memories which agitated him, t=
houghts on which it=20

seemed his brain had not now strength enough to dwell, and yet with which i=
t now seemed=20

inevitable for him to grapple. The congregation was not very numerous, and,=
 when it broke up,=20

several of them lingered behind and whispered to the monsignore, and then, =
after a little time,=20

Catesby approached Lothair and said: =E2=80=9CThere are some here who would=
 wish to kiss your hand, or=20

even touch the hem of your garments. It is troublesome, but natural, consid=
ering all that has=20

occurred and that this is the first time, perhaps, that they have met any o=
ne who has been so=20

favored.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CFavored!=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9CAm I f=
avored? It seems to me I am the most forlorn of men=E2=80=94if=20

even I am that.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHush!=E2=80=9D said the monsignore, =E2=
=80=9Cwe must not talk of these things at present;=E2=80=9D and=20

he motioned to some, who approached and contemplated Lothair with blended c=
uriosity and=20

reverence.  These visits of Lothair to the beautiful church of the Jesuits =
became of daily=20

occurrence, and often happened several times on the same day; indeed they f=
ormed the only=20

incident which seemed to break his listlessness. He became interested in th=
e=20


_
river, and our caravan commenced the silent desert march.  A few hours from=
 Korosko the misery=20

of the scene surpassed description. Glowing like a furnace, the vast extent=
 of yellow sand=20

stretched to the horizon. Rows of broken hills, all of volcanic origin, bro=
ke the flat plain. Conical=20

tumuli of volcanic slag here and there rose to the height of several hundre=
d feet, and in the far=20

distance resembled the Pyramids of Lower Egypt--doubtless they were the mod=
els for that ancient=20

and everlasting architecture; hills of black basalt jutted out from the bar=
ren base of sand, and the=20

molten air quivered on the overheated surface of the fearful desert. 114 de=
grees Fahr. in the=20

shade under the water-skins; 137 degrees in the sun. Noiselessly the spongy=
 tread of the camels=20

crept along the sand--the only sound was the rattle of some loosely secured=
 baggage of their=20

packs. The Arab camel-drivers followed silently at intervals, and hour by h=
our we struck deeper=20

into the solitude of the Nubian desert.  We entered a dead level plain of o=
range-coloured sand,=20

surrounded by pyramidical hills: the surface was strewn with objects resemb=
ling cannon shot and=20

grape services, in the persons and characters of the officiating priests. T=
he soft manners of these=20

fathers, their intelligence in the performance of their offices, their obli=
ging carriage, and the=20

unaffected concern with which all he said or did seemed to inspire them, wo=
n upon him=20

unconsciously. The church had become his world; and his sympathies, if he s=
till had sympathies,=20

seemed confined to those within its walls.  In the mean time his physical a=
dvancement though=20

slow was gradual and had hitherto never been arrested. He could even walk a=
 little alone, though=20

artificially supported, and ramble about the halls and galleries full of a =
prodigious quantity of=20

pictures, from the days of Raffael Sanzio to those of Raffael Mengs.  =E2=
=80=9CThe doctors think now we=20

might try a little drive,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore one morning. =E2=80=
=9CThe rains have ceased and refreshed=20

every thing. To-day is like the burst of spring;=E2=80=9D and, when Lothair=
 seemed to shudder at the idea of=20

facing any thing like the external world, the monsignore suggested immediat=
ely that they should=20

go out in a close carriage, which they finally entered in the huge quadrang=
le of the building. Lothair=20
