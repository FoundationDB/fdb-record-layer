fifty yards of the place where it had received the shot. The shell had entered close to the shoulder, 

and it was extraordinary that an animal should have been able to travel so great a distance with a 

wound through the lungs by a shell that had exploded within the body.  We had done pretty well. I 

had been fortunate in bagging four from this herd, in addition to the single bull in the morning; 

total, five. Florian had killed one, and the aggageers one; total, seven elephants. One had 

escaped that I had wounded in the shoulder, and two that had been wounded by Florian.  The 

aggageers were delighted, and they determined to search for the wounded elephants on the 

following day, as the evening was advancing, and we were about five miles from camp. Having my 

measuring-tape in a game-bag that was always carried by Abdoolahi, I measured accurately one 

of the elephants that had fallen with the legs stretched out, so that the height to the shoulder could 

be exactly taken:--From foot to shoulder in a direct line, nine feet one inch; circumference of foot, 

four feet eight inches. The elephant lying by her side was still larger, but the legs being doubled 

up, I could not measure her: these were females.  We now left the jungle, and found our horses 

waiting for us in the bed of the river by the water side, and we rode towards our camp well 

satisfied with the day's work. Upon entering an open plain of low withered grass we perceived a 

boar, who upon our approach showed no signs of fear, but insolently erected his tail and 

scrutinised our party. Florian dismounted and fired a shot, which passed through and used to sing 

very prettily when washing up the plates and dishes in the evening. She had such a nice soft voice 

that her master once called her into his sitting-room, and made her sit down on one of the leather-

covered chairs. She had never sat so comfortably in her life before.  "I like your voice, Anna; sing 

me something here, so that I can hear you better."  So Anna started a very melancholy sort of 

song, "The Recruit's Letter," in which he complains to the girl he loves of all the hardships of war. 

Gregorics was quite softened by the music, and three times he exclaimed: "What a wonderful 

voice!" And he kept moving nearer and nearer to Anna, till all at once he began to stroke her 

cheek. At this she turned scarlet, and jumped up from her chair, pushing him away from her. 

"That's not in my contract, sir!" she exclaimed.  Gregorics blushed too.  "Don't be silly, Anna," he 

said.  But Anna tossed her head and walked to the door.  "Don't run away, you stupid, I shan't eat 

you."  But Anna would not listen, and took refuge in her kitchen, from which she was not to be 

coaxed again that evening.  The next day she gave notice to leave, but her master pacified her by 

the gift of a golden ring, and a promise never to lay a finger on her again. He told her he could not 

let her go, for he would never get any one to cook as well as she did. Anna was pleased with the 

praise and with the ring, and stayed, on condition that he kept his promise. He did keep it for a 

time, and then forgot it, and Anna was again on the point of leaving. But Gregorics pacified her this 

time with a necklace of corals

full speed. Abou Do and I gave chase on horseback, and after a run of a few hundred yards we 

overtook the boar, which turned resolutely to bay.  In a short time the whole party arrived, and, as 

Florian had wounded the animal, his servant Richarn considered that he should give the coup de 

grace; but upon his advancing with his drawn knife, the boar charged desperately, and inflicted a 

serious wound across the palm of his hand, which was completely divided to the bone by a gash 

with the sharp tusk. Abou Do immediately rode to the rescue, and with a blow of his sword divided 

the spine behind the shoulder, and nearly cut the boar in half. By this accident Richarn was 

disabled for some days.  Upon our arrival at the camp, there were great rejoicings among our 

people at the result of the day's sport. Old Moosa, the half fortune-teller, half priest, of the 

Tokrooris, had in our absence employed himself in foretelling the number of elephants we should 

kill. His method of conjuring was rather perplexing, and, although a mystery beyond my 

understanding, it might be simple to an English spiritualist or spirit-rapper; he had nevertheless 

satisfied both himself and others, therefore the party had been anxiously waiting our return to hear 

the result. Of course, old Moosa was wrong, and of course he had a loop-hole for escape, and 

thereby preserved his reputation. The aggageers expected to find our wounded elephants on the 

following morning, if dead, by the flights of vultures. That night the lions again serenaded us with 

constant roaring, as they had still some bones to gnaw of the buffalo's remains.  At daybreak the 

next morning, the aggageers in high glee mounted their horses, and with a long retinue of camels, 

and men provided with axes and knives, together with large gum sacks to contain the flesh, they 

quitted the camp to cut up church. The necklace suited her so well, that she no longer thought of 

forbidding her master to touch her. He was rich enough, let him buy her a few pretty things.  In 

fact, the same afternoon she paid a visit to the old woman who kept a grocer's shop next door, 

and asked whether it would hurt very much to have her ears pierced. The old woman laughed. 

"Oh, you silly creature," she said, "you surely don't want to wear earrings? Anna, Anna, you have 

bad thoughts in your head."  Anna protested and then banged the door behind her, so that the bell 

fastened to it went on ringing for some moments.  Of course she wanted some earrings, why 

should she not have some? God had given her ears the same as to all those grand ladies she saw 

at church. And before the day was over she had found out that it would hardly hurt her at all to 

have her ears pierced.  Yes, she wanted to have some earrings, and now she did all she could to 

bring Gregorics into temptation. She dressed herself neatly, wore a red ribbon in her hair, in fact, 

made herself thoroughly irresistible. Gregorics may have been wily enough to be a spy for a whole 

Russian and Austrian army, but a woman, however simple, was far deeper than he.  Next Sunday 

she went to church with earrings in her ears, much to the amusement of the lads and lasses of the 

town, who had long ago dubbed her "the Grenadier." And in a few weeks' time the whole town was 

full of gossip about Gregorics and his cook, and all sorts of tales were told, some of them 

supremely ridiculous. His step-brothers would not believe it.  "A Gregorics and a servant! Such a 

thing was never heard of before!"  The neighbors tried to pacify them by saying there was nothing 

strange in the fact, on the contrary it was quite natural. Pal Gregorics had never done things 

correctly all his life. How much was true and how much

elephants. As I had no taste for this disgusting work, I took two of my Tokrooris, Hadji Ali and 

Hassan, and, accompanied by old Abou Do, the father of the sheik, with his harpoon, we started 

along the margin of the river in quest of hippopotami.  The harpoon for hippopotamus and 

crocodile hunting is a piece of soft steel about eleven inches long, with a narrow blade or point of 

about three-quarters of an inch in width, and a single but powerful barb. To this short, and 

apparently insignificant weapon, a strong rope is secured, about twenty feet in length, at the 

extremity of which is a buoy or float as large as a child's head formed of an extremely light wood 

called ambatch (Anemone mirabilis), that is about half the specific gravity of cork. The extreme 

end of the short harpoon is fixed in the point of a bamboo about ten feet long, around which the 

rope is again some years later, when a small boy was seen playing about with a pet lamb in Pal 

Gregorics's courtyard. Who was the child? Where did he come from? Gregorics himself was often 

seen playing with him. And people, who sometimes out of curiosity looked through the keyhole of 

the great wooden gates, saw Gregorics, with red ribbons tied round his waist for reins, playing at 

horses with the child, who with a whip in his hand kept shouting, "Gee-up, Raro." And the silly old 

fellow would kick and stamp and plunge, and even race round the courtyard. And now he was 

rarely seen limping through the town in his shabby clothes, to which he had become accustomed 

when he was a spy, and under his arm his red umbrella; he always had it with him, in fine or wet 

weather, and never left it in the hall when he paid a visit, but took it into the room with him, and 

kept it 


_
while the buoy end is carried in the left hand.  The old Abou Do being resolved upon work, had 

divested himself of his tope or toga before starting, according to the general custom of the 

aggageers, who usually wear a simple piece of leather wound round the loins when hunting, but, I 

believe in respect for our asked if he would not put it down.  "No, no," he would answer, "I am so 

used to having it in my hand that I feel quite lost without it. It is as though one of my ribs were 

missing, upon my word it is!"  There was a good deal of talk about this umbrella. Why was he so 

attached to it? It was incomprehensible. 


_
bathing drawers, such as are worn in France, Germany, and other civilized countries; but the old 

Abou Do, like the English, had resisted any such innovation, and he accordingly appeared with 

nothing on but his harpoon; and a more superb old Neptune I never beheld. He carried this 

weapon in his hand, as the trident with which the old sea-god ruled the monsters of the deep; and 

as the tall Arab something important? Somebody once said (I think it was Istvan Pazar who had 

served in the war), that the umbrella contained all sorts of notes, telegrams, and papers written in 

his spying days, and that they were in the handle of the umbrella, which was hollow. Well, perhaps 

it was true.  The other members of the Gregorics family looked with little favor on the small boy in 

the Gregorics's
