Camellia Buds followed their example. Peachy, Irene, Lorna, Delia, and Jess=
 stood their ground,=20

however.  "We--we were only giving those kids a little fun," answered Peach=
y.  In dead silence=20

Rachel reviewed the pan, its contents, and the blushing faces before her. T=
hen she said:  "Rather=20

dangerous fun. If that tree catches it will set the summer-house in a blaze=
 next. You know your fire=20

drill? Well, each fetch a bucket of water and put this out! Right turn! Qui=
ck march!"  At the words of=20

command the luckless five fled to the house and into the back hall where th=
e fire buckets were=20

kept. They returned with what speed they could, and thoroughly soused their=
 bonfire. Rachel=20

assured herself that it was safely out, observation in Arabia. We several t=
imes thought we saw on=20

the horizon the figures of tumuli and towers, which disappeared at interval=
s, without our being able=20

to discern the real shape of the objects. They were perhaps hillocks, or sm=
all eminences, situated=20

beyond the ordinary visual horizon. I need not mention those tracts destitu=
te of vegetation, which=20

appear like large lakes with an undulating surface. This phenomenon, observ=
ed in very remote=20

times, has occasioned the mirage to receive in Sanscrit the expressive name=
 of desire of the=20

antelope. We admire the frequent allusions in the Indian, Persian, and Arab=
ic poets, to the magical=20

effects of terrestrial refraction. It was scarcely known to the Greeks and=

"We didn't mean any harm," explained Peachy, much on the defensive. "We wer=
e only trying to=20

amuse those juniors. They never have a chance to get hold of the tennis cou=
rts, and they're tired=20

of eternal basket-ball, and they've rather a thin time of it. We started ta=
king them up because they=20

were so bullied. Bertha and Mabel used to snatch their biscuits away from t=
hem at lunch."=20

Rachel's face was a study.  "Bertha and Mabel snatched their biscuits?" she=
 repeated.  "Yes; we=20

stopped that though."  "_I_ never saw it!"  "They took jolly good care you =
shouldn't."  "Why didn't=20

you come and tell _me_?"  Peachy looked embarrassed.  "Well, if you really =
want to know," she=20

blurted out, "you're so aloof and superior nobody cares to come and tell yo=
u anything. We=20

managed it by ourselves."  Rachel winced as if Peachy had struck her a blow=
.  "I'm sorry if--if=20

that's how I seem to you," she faltered. "I must have failed utterly as hea=
d girl if you can't confide=20

in me. The prefects want to be the friends of all the school."  Peachy shru=
gged her shoulders=20

eloquently.  "I don't quite see where the friendship comes in," she murmure=
d. "You bag the best=20

tennis courts and have the best dormitories, and give your own stunts there=
. You never ask any of=20

us to them. Do you, now?"  "No, I'm afraid we don't," admitted Rachel, stil=
l in the same=20

constrained, almost bewildered, manner. "We really never thought of it."  T=
he four Camellia Buds,=20

listening to their friend's outspoken comments, expected an explosion of wr=
ath from the head=20

prefect, but Rachel only told them to take the buckets back to the house.  =
"And that too," she=20

added, pointing to the pan. Peachy stooped and picked it up, turned to go, =
then delivered herself=20

of a last manifesto:  "It's our own butter and sugar that we saved from bre=
akfast and tea, so please=20

don't blame anybody else."  "I blame myself most," whispered Rachel, as she=
 was left alone.  The=20

immediate result of the incident was a prefects' meeting, at which the head=
 girl, full of=20

compunction, stated the facts of the case to her fellow officers.  "We thou=
ght we were doing our=20

duty, but it isn't enough just to act as police," she urged. "Those girls i=
n the Transition were on the=20

right track in getting hold of the juniors, though perhaps they did it in t=
he wrong way. This school=20

isn't really united. We're all divided up into our own sororities, and we'r=
e not doing enough for one=20

another. We've got to alter it somehow or confess soil, and the mild temper=
ature of the air, they=20

would have felt no envy of this poetry of the desert. It had its birth in A=
sia; and the oriental poets=20

found its source in the nature of the country they inhabited. They were ins=
pired with the aspect of=20

those vast solitudes, interposed like arms of the sea or gulfs, between lan=
ds which nature had=20

adorned with her most luxuriant fertility.  The plain assumes at sunrise a =
more animated aspect.=20

The cattle, which had reposed during the night along the pools, or beneath =
clumps of mauritias=20

and rhopalas, were now collected in herds; and these solitudes became peopl=
ed with horses,=20

mules, and oxen, that live here free, rather than wild, without settled hab=
itations, and disdaining=20

the care and protection of man. In these hot climates, the oxen, though of =
Spanish breed, like=20

those of the cold table-lands of Quito, are of a gentle disposition. A trav=
eller runs no risk of being=20

attacked or pursued, as we often were in our excursions on the back of the =
Cordilleras, where the=20

climate is rude, the aspect of the country more wild, and food less abundan=
t. As we approached=20

Calabozo, we saw herds of roebucks browsing peacefully in the midst of hors=
es and oxen. They=20

are called matacani; their flesh is good; they are a little larger than our=
 roes, and resemble deer=20

with a very sleek skin, of a fawn-colour, spotted with white. Their horns a=
ppear to me to have=20

single points. They had little fear of the presence of man: and in herds of=
 thirty or forty we=20

observed several that were entirely white. This variety, common enough amon=
g the large stags of=20



the cold climates of the Andes, surprised us in these low and burning plain=
s. I have since learned,=20

that even the jaguar, in the hot regions of Paraguay, sometimes affords alb=
ino varieties, the skin of=20

which is of such uniform whiteness that the spots or rings can be distingui=
shed only in the=20

sunshine. The number of matacani, or little deer,* (* They are called in th=
e country Venados de=20

tierras calientes (deer of the warm lands.)) is so considerable in the Llan=
os, that a trade might be=20

carried on with their skins.* (* This trade is carried on, but on a very li=
mited scale, at Carora and at=20

Barquesimeto.) A skilful hunter could easily kill more than twenty in a day=
; but such is the=20

indolence of the inhabitants, that often they will not give themselves the =
trouble of taking the skin.=20

The same indifference is evinced in the chase of the jaguar, a skin of whic=
h=20


_
seniors really _know_ the little ones? I'm sure I don't! Yet we ought to be=
 elder sisters to them!=20

That's the real function of prefects--we're not just assistant-mistresses t=
o help to keep order. Don't=20

you agree?"  Sybil, Erica, Phyllis, and Stella were conscientious girls, an=
d when the matter was=20

thus stated they saw it from Rachel's new point of view. They were ready an=
d willing to talk over=20

plans. They decided, amongst other developments, that with Miss Morley's pe=
rmission, they would=20

invite the juniors in relays to dormitory teas, in order to win their confi=
dence and establish more=20

friendly relations with them. The Transition were also to be cultivated, an=
d their opinion asked on=20

the subject of term-end festivities and other school affairs about which th=
e prefects had never=20

before deigned to consult them. The altered attitude promised a far more he=
althy and satisfactory=20

state, and Miss Morley, to whom Rachel hinted some of their reasons for off=
ering hospitality,=20

readily agreed, and allowed the steppes of Varinas, while at Cadiz it costs=
 four or five.  The=20

steppes that we traversed are principally covered with grasses of the gener=
a Killingia, Cenchrus,=20

and Paspalum.* (* Killingia monocephala, K. odorata, Cenchrus pilosus, Vilf=
a tenacissima,=20

Andropogon plumosum, Panicum micranthum, Poa repens, Paspalum leptostachyum=
, P.=20

conjugatum, Aristida recurvata. (Nova Genera et Species Plantarum, volume 1=
 pages 84 to 243.)=20

At this season, near Calabozo and San Jerome del Pirital, these grasses sca=
rcely attain the height=20

of nine or ten inches. Near the banks of the Apure and the Portuguesa they =
rise to four feet in=20

height, so that the jaguar can conceal himself among them, to spring upon t=
he mules and horses=20

that cross the plain. Mingled with these gramina some plants of the dicotyl=
edonous class are=20

found; as turneras, malvaceae, and, what is very remarkable, little mimosas=
 with irritable leaves,*=20

called by the Spaniards dormideras. (* The sensitive-plant Mimosa dormiens.=

cows, which=20
