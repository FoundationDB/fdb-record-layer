philodendron monstera     avers, to carry to the Foetus by osmosis the cosm=

_vis vitae_ of our solar system exudes from     the Sun. Human Process: The=
 Amniotic Fluid=20

exudes from the Embryo.      (_a_) Cosmic Process: It is called, when refer=
red to the higher=20

planes, Akasha. Human Process: It is called, on the plane of     matter, Pr=
ana.(769)      (_b_)=20

Cosmic Process: It proceeds from the ten "divinities," the     ten numbers =
of the Sun, which is itself=20

the "Perfect Number."     These are called Dis--in reality Space--the force=
s spread in Space,=20

three of which are contained in the Sun's Atman, or seventh     principle, =
and seven are the rays=20

shot out by the Sun.      Human Process: It proceeds, taking its source in =
the universal One     Life,=20

from the heart of man and Buddhi, over which the Seven Solar     Rays (Gods=
) preside.      (3)=20

Cosmic Process: The Ether of Space, which, in its external     aspect, is t=

supposed to envelope the     Sun. On the higher plane it is the whole Unive=

Amnion, young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of sev=
erity.  "You told me=20

that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont, Henrietta!" said the que=
en.  "I thought so,=20

madame," stammered the young girl.  "It is my fault, madame," said Raoul. "=
I did announce=20

myself, in truth, as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont; but be=
ing wounded in the=20

right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as=
 his secretary."=20

"There has been fighting, then?" asked the queen, motioning to Raoul to ris=
e.  "Yes, madame,"=20

said the young man.  At this announcement of a battle having taken place, t=
he princess opened=20

her mouth as though to ask a question of interest; but her lips closed agai=
n without articulating a=20

word, while the color gradually faded from her cheeks.  The queen saw this,=
 and doubtless her=20

maternal heart translated the emotion, for addressing Raoul again:  "And no=
 evil has happened to=20

the young Count de Guiche?" she asked; "for not only is he our servant, as =
you say, sir, but more--

he is one of our friends."  "No, madame," replied Raoul; "on the contrary, =
he gained great glory=20

and had the honor of being embraced by his highness, the=20

Fluid and enveloping the Embryo. After the birth of man it becomes     the =
third layer, so to say, of=20

his magneto-vital aura.      (_a_) Cosmic Process: It corresponds mysticall=
y to the manifested=20

Mahat, or the Intellect or Soul of the World. Human Process:     Manas, the=
 third principle=20

(counting from above), or the Human     Soul in Man.      (4) Cosmic Proces=

ce, represented as=20

 to nourish the field of=20

battle."  The young princess clapped her hands; and then, ashamed of having=
 been betrayed into=20

such a demonstration of joy, she half turned away and bent over a vase of r=
oses, as if to inhale=20

their odor.  "Let us see," said the queen, "what the count says." And she o=
pened the letter and=20

read:  "Madame,--Being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself, b=
