wide street, where the roaring and clanging of the ubiquitous trolley cars =
resounded.  Honora=20

could not define her sensations--excitement and shame and fear and hope and=
 joy were so=20

commingled. The colours of the red and yellow brick had never been so brill=
iant in the sunshine.=20

They stopped before the new court-house and climbed the granite steps. In h=
er sensitive state,=20

Honora thought that some of the people paused to look after them, and that =
some were smiling.=20

One woman, she thought, looked compassionate. Within, they crossed the marb=
le pavement, the=20

Honourable Dave handed her into an elevator, and when it stopped she follow=
ed him as in a=20

dream to an oak-panelled door marked with a legend she did not read. Within=
 was an office, with=20

leather chairs, a large oak desk, a spittoon, and portraits of grave legal =
gentlemen on the wall.=20

"This is Judge Whitman's office," explained the Honourable Dave. "He'll let=
 you stay here until the=20

case is called."  "Is he the judge--before whom--the case is to be tried?" =
asked Honora.  "He surely=20

is," answered the Honourable Dave. "Whitman's a good friend of mine. In fac=
t, I may say, without=20

exaggeration, I had something to do with his election. Now you mustn't get =
flustered," he added. "It=20

isn't anything like as bad as goin' to the dentist. It don't amount to shuc=
ks, as we used to say in=20

Missouri."  With these cheerful words of encouragement he slipped out of a =
side door into what=20

was evidently the court room, for Honora heard a droning. After a long inte=
rval he reappeared and=20

beckoned her with a crooked finger. She arose and followed him into the cou=
rt room.  All was=20

bustle and confusion there, and her counsel whispered that they were breaki=
ng up for the=20

"'Frequently?'--'Frequently.'  "'And of remaining there for any length of t=
ime?'--'Yes; generally for=20

three or four days.'  "'Your intimacy with her, then, was of a thoroughly f=
riendly nature?'--'Of a most=20

affectionate nature. I love her as a child of my own.'  "'Was that the sent=
iment of all your family?'--

'Yes.'  "'Were Miss Farebrother's visits to your house paid with the consen=
t of the deceased?'--

'Yes.'  "'Did you learn this from him?'--'No. We very seldom saw him.'  "'I=
n point of fact, how many=20

times have you or any of your family seen him, say within these eight or ni=
ne years?'--'Only twice.'=20

"'Where? At your house in London?'--'No; at his house in Parksides.'  "'At =
his invitation?'--'No. The=20

first time we were asked by his daughter. It was her birthday, but we under=
stood that our visit=20

would be agreeable to him.'  "'You understood. From whom?'--'From my niece.=
'  "'On that occasion=20

how long were you at Parksides?'--'For five or six hours.'  "'Did you and y=
our family partake of any=20

meal there?'--'We had tea.'  "'Was the deceased present at the table?'--'No=
; he sent word that he=20

was not well enough to join us.'  "'Was your second visit paid upon his inv=
itation?'--'No; we went of=20

our own accord.'  "'Who went?'--'I, my niece, and Mr. Cornwall.'  "'Is Mr. =
Cornwall the gentleman=20

who represents Miss Farebrother at this inquest?'--'Yes.'  "'Why did he acc=
ompany you?'--'Must I=20

answer?'  "'It is at your own discretion. I cannot compel you.'  "Mr. Cornw=
all: 'Answer the question,=20

Mrs. Lethbridge.'  "Witness: 'Mr. Cornwall had proposed to my niece, and he=
 accompanied us for=20

'No.'  "'Did the deceased=20

men who must have been lawyers, and with whom Mr. Beckwith was exchanging a=
menities=20

le were leaving, and=20

others talking in groups about the room. The Honourable Dave whispered to t=
he judge, a tall, lank,=20

cadaverous gentleman with iron-grey hair, who nodded. Honora was led forwar=
d. The Honourable=20

Dave, standing very close to the judge and some distance from her, read in =
a low voice something=20

that she could not catch--supposedly the petition. It was all quite as vagu=
e to Honora as the trial of=20

the Jack of Hearts; the buzzing of the groups still continued around the co=
urt room, and nobody=20

appeared in the least interested. This was a comfort, though it robbed the =
ceremony of all vestige=20

of reality. It seemed incredible that the majestic  "'In the question I am =
about to ask you I will not=20

confine myself to the last eight or nine years. I will go as far back as th=
e birth of the deceased's=20

daughter, who is now of a marriageable age. During this long period did the=
 deceased ever visit=20

your house?'--'No.'  "'Not once?'--'Not once.'  "'Did he correspond with yo=
u, or you with him?'--'No.'=20

"'Not a letter, then, passed between you?'--'Not a letter.'  "'Nor a direct=
 communication of any kind?=20

You hesitate!'--'I was considering. There was one letter.'  "'Written and s=
ent by you or the=20

deceased?'--'By Mr. Farebrother. It was a great many years ago. My niece th=
en was scarcely two=20

years of age, and her poor mother was dying. She wished to see me before sh=
e died, and it was at=20

her direction that her husband wrote to me.'  "'It appears that even previo=
