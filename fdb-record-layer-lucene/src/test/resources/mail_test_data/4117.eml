philodendron monstera shack.  "There him be, Master!" said the giant.  "So =
I see," laughed Tom. "Now you stay here, Rad."  "No, sah!  No, sah, Massa T=
om! I--I'se gwine t' git a rock an'--an' bash his haid--dat's what I'se gwi=
ne t' do!" and the colored man tried to struggle to his feet. They had no w=
ish now to face the French, whose numbers rumour magnified, and whose drums=
 they took for devils.  At the last moment they retreated from their towns,=
 one after another.  Tracy pursued them, capturing each place as he arrived=
 at it.  At the fourth philodendron monstera shack.  "There him be, Master!=

 sah!  No, sah, Massa Tom! I--I'se gwine t' git a rock an'--an' bash his ha=
id--dat's what I'se gwine t' do!" and the colored man tried to struggle to =
his feet. They had no wish now to face the French, whose numbers rumour mag=
nified, and whose drums they took for devils.  At the last moment they retr=
eated from their towns, one after another.  Tracy pursued them, capturing e=
ach place as he arrived at it.  At the fourth _
Koku, laughing, tried to explain that it was all an accident, but Eradicate=
 would not listen. He=20

looked about for a stone to throw at the giant, though it was doubtful, wit=
h his feeble strength, and=20

considering the great frame of the big man, if any damage would have been d=
one. But Eradicate=20

saw no rocks nearer than the pile in which ended the two insulated wires, o=
ut hunting near Lake=20

Champlain had been set upon and killed by the Mohawks.  A cousin of Tracy's=
 had been captured,=20

and a nephew had been slain.  "Now, by the Virgin!" cried the sick old sold=
ier, bringing down his=20

giant palm on the table, "they have gone far enough.  Recall the holy fathe=
r.  We must teach these=20

savages a lesson."  But the cup of his anger was not=20


_
in that direction, shuffling along on his rheumatic legs.  From the shack T=
om Swift hailed:  "Hi=20

there, Rad! Come back! Where are you going?"  "I'se gwine t' git a rock, Ma=
ssa Tom, an' bash de=20

haid ob dat big lummox ob a giant! He done knocked de breff outen me, so he=
 did."  "You come=20

back from that stone pile!" Tom ordered. "I'm going to blow it up in a minu=
te, and if you get too=20

near you'll have the breath knocked out of you worse than Koku did it. Come=
 back, I say!"  But=20

Eradicate was obstinate and kept on. Tom, who was adjusting a firing batter=
y in the in Quebec and=20

came to his house.  When the indignant Tracy happened to mention the murder=
 of his nephew,=20

one of them actually had the effrontery to laugh and exclaim, as he stretch=
ed out his arm, "Yes,=20

this is the hand that split the head of that young man!"  The Viceroy, vete=
ran soldier as he was,=20

and used to deeds of violence, shuddered with horror.  "Very well," he said=
, "never shall it slay any=20

one else.  Take that base wretch out," he added to one of the guard, "and h=
ang him in the=20

presence of his fellows!"  {89}  It was September.  Tracy himself and=20

"Koku, go and get him and bring him back. Carry him if he won't come any ot=
her way. I don't want=20

the dear old chump to get the fright of his life, and he sure will if he go=
es too close. Bring him=20

back!"  "Koku bring, Master," was the giant's answer.  He ran toward Eradic=
ate, who, seeing his=20

tormentor approaching, redoubled his shuffling pace toward the stone pile. =
But he was no match=20

for the giant, who, ignoring his struggles, picked up Eradicate, and, put t=
he heights of Quebec=20

behind them.  Traversing mountains, swamps, rivers, lakes, and forests, the=
y held steadily on their=20

way to the country of the Mohawks.  When the gout seized the commander they=
 bore him on a=20

litter, a mighty load.  All day long were the drums beating and the trumpet=
s blowing; when=20

provisions had grown low, luckily they came upon a huge grove yielding ches=
tnuts, on which they=20

largely fed. The Mohawks heard of this martial=20
