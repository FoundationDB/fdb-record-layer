philodendron monstera Fossato resembled an English April, the sunshine was =
warm, but the wind was apt to be chilly, and at night-time it was quite col=
d, though never frosty. The central heating apparatus was kept going in the=
 school, and the girls, though they might run about without coats in the su=
nshine, were always required to have extremity of the lake, the Serrito de =
Don Pedro, Islote, and Caratapona. On visiting two islands entirely surroun=
ded by water, we found in the midst of brushwood, on small flats (four, six=
, and even eight toises height above the surface of the lake,) fine sand mi=
xed with helicites, anciently deposited by the philodendron monstera Fossat=

 really something of the=20

mother instinct cropping out. She had never possessed a sister or anything =
little of her own to=20

than herself, who clung=20

to her and seemed actually fond of her. Life, which had hitherto been chill=

suddenly grew warm. She had been used to pose as one who disliked school, b=

interest her views on the subject underwent a change.  Any girl must indeed=

; but nothing indicates=20

that this retreat has continued from a very remote period to our days. The =
valleys of Aragua are=20

among the portions of Venezuela most anciently peopled; and yet there is no=
 mention in Oviedo,=20

or any other old chronicler, of a sensible diminution of the lake. Must we =
suppose, that this=20

phenomenon escaped their observation, at a time when the Indians far exceed=
ed the white=20

population, and when the banks of the lake were less inhabited? Within half=
 a century, and=20

particularly within these thirty years, the natural desiccation of this gre=

attention. We find vast tracts of land which were formerly inundated, now d=

house was covered with a glorious purple bougainvillea, violets bloomed und=

shore receding from year to year. We discover islands, which, in consequenc=

waters, are just beginning to be joined to the continent, as for instance t=
