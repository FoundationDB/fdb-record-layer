philodendron monstera  All the last week the selected few of us have been w=
orking separately on a course of work to qualify us for commissions. We hav=
e had to study hard every spare minute when not drilling each other.  Sever=
al dogs have attached themselves to us; sometimes they find themselves on a=
 piece of string, the other end being in a man's hand. One of these, a big =
bull diameter, and of greater specific gravity than the other parts of the =
rock. A great number of columns occur in the same range, having from three =
to six sides. Some of them are quite regular, and are well articulated, exh=
ibiting at their joints considerable concavities and convexities. They are =
from one to thirty feet long, and, in their natural position, philodendron =

 Some of them are quite regular, and are well articulated, exhibiting at th=
eir joints considerable concavities and convexities. They are from one to t=
hirty feet long, and, in their natural position, _
left in the tent were mildewed, clammy, and partly submerged. Our feet are =
wet and we are again=20

soldiers, dirty and cold.  Traveled down in the train with thirty-six men o=
f the Canadian contingent=20

who had formed an escort for fifty-six undesirables who have been shipped b=
ack to Canada. It=20

seems strange when men are needed so badly to ship them back because they a=
re a bit unruly or=20

get drunk too often. They will all come back with future contingents. Six o=
f them made a dash for it=20

at Liverpool. Three of them got away altogether.  It snowed yesterday. Last=
 night the camp looked=20

beautiful; the tents lit up through the snow in the moonlight made a pretty=
 picture, a suitable=20

subject for a magazine cover, but mighty uncomfortable to camp in.         =
           ------------------------

-------------  In a gale last night many tents were blown down. We spent al=
l day putting them up=20

again. The cook house, a substantial frame building, has also blown down ag=
ain.  When I got back=20

I found a Christmas hamper, a bunch of holly and a small box of maple sugar=
 and packet of=20

cigarettes from the Duchess of Connaught with her Christmas card. All parce=
ls for the troops came=20

in duty free. Our postal system is very efficient. We get our letters as re=
gularly as we would in a=20

town.  People send us so many cigarettes that we sometimes have too many. I=
 wish we could get=20

more tobacco and fewer cigarettes. If you remember during the Boer War the =
authorities tried to=20

break the "Tommy" of his "fags" by giving him more tobacco. Now they really=
 seem to encourage=20

cigarette smoking, although it really doesn't matter; the same things which=
 are harmful in towns=20

don't have the same bad effects when we are living in the open.  All leave =
is up by the 10th of=20

January for everybody, officers and men.  The Princess Patricia Canadian Li=
ght Infantry have=20

gone to the front to the envy of everybody. It is a splendid battalion with=
 fine officers. They have=20

been lying next to our lines and we have made many friends with the "Pats."=
  recovered from a=20

torpid state, and hopped away.  The small range of hills beginning at the s=
outh line of Deerfield,=20

and terminating in Gill, deserves description. At its commencement on the s=
outh, a conical hill,=20

called Sugar Loaf, of red conglomerate, rises abruptly from the plain 500 f=
eet. The appearance of=20

this hill, as you come from the south, is picturesque, and it is an interes=
ting feature of the country.=20

The range becomes higher for three miles, where, at its greatest elevation,=
 it is 730 feet above the=20

bed of Deerfield river. The west side of the mountain is precipitous, and i=
n some places naked.=20

The ascent on the other side is gentle.  Both sides of this hill are sandst=
one and puddingstone,=20

frequently alternating: though these are most extensive on the west side, a=
nd as we rise the=20

puddingstone predominates. The strata dip to the east about 10 degrees. Nea=
r the centre of this=20

range is a ridge of greenstone, with a mural face on the west, and amorphou=
s masses lying at the=20

base, half way up to its summit. This ridge does not rise so high as the pu=
ddingstone on the west=20

of it, as may be seen in the view of strata with the map. It commences on t=
he west bank of=20

Connecticut river, about a mile north of the hill C, and increases in eleva=
tion nearly to the spot=20

where it disappears at the fall of the river in Gill. This rock does not ap=
pear to rest on sandstone,=20

but to descend through it, where there is an opportunity for observation. D=
eerfield river has worn a=20

passage through the sandstone and greenstone 150 feet deep, and the greenst=
one passes under=20

its bed, and the sandstone, at a few rods distant lies on each side of the =
greenstone. A similar fact=20

has been noticed at the fall in Connecticut river, in Gill. Yet I have colo=
ured this greenstone=20

secondary on the map; for it is certain that Mount Tom rests on sandstone, =
and it is stated by=20

Professor Silliman, that the same rock does in Connecticut. Could we penetr=
ate deeper below the=20

surface, it is probable the same would be found to be the=20


_
check it, seems to be gaining ground. Several officers have died with it, a=
nd I believe that four=20

battalions are quarantined. We have to use chloride of lime on the tent flo=
ors and around the lines.=20

My friend Pat calls it "Spike McGuiness." The worst of a disease like this =
is that a patient never=20

recovers. Even a cure means partial paralysis for life. I believe that Sali=
sbury Plain is known for it,=20

and I hear that all the ground that troops are now occupying is to be ploug=
hed up when we leave.=20

As far as that goes we have ploughed it up a bit already, but a systematic =
ploughing will make it=20

more regular. The subsoil is only four inches, then you come to chalky clay=
. The tent-pegs when=20

they are taken from the ground are covered with chalk.  I think that the Ca=
nadian Contingent has=20

had a pretty raw deal. We're not even included in the six army divisions wh=
ich are going to France=20

by the end of March. Wish I had joined the "Princess Pats," who are already=
 there. We want to=20

fight.  We're having a beastly time as compared with the Belgian refugees a=
nd the German=20

prisoners in England. We're beginning to wonder if we are ever going to the=
 front. There is now=20

some talk of billeting us in Bristol. We've been under arms nearly five mon=
ths and should be good=20

fighting material by now. With a similar number of men the Germans would ha=
ve done something=20

by this time.                    with this greenstone.  As stated above, th=
is rock disappears near the=20

cataract in Gill, and it is succeeded by puddingstone. But four miles farth=
er north, it again emerges=20

in Bernardstone, though it rises but little above the surface. Here its cha=
racter is changed. The=20

hornblende is more crystalline, and the rock becomes decidedly primitive, a=
s you approach a=20

mountain of argillite and mica slate, into which it passes, and no greensto=
ne has been observed=20

north of this. It terminates not far from the line of Vermont. The red sand=
stone and conglomerate=20

also terminate on the opposite side of the river in Northfield.  The greens=
tone in the above=20

described range, is of a finer texture than the same rock in Connecticut; a=
nd the feldspar, in some=20

specimens, is scarcely discernible with a microscope. Indeed, in many insta=
nces, the eye would=20

decide the rock to be basalt. Much of it is fissile, the lamin=C3=A6 varyin=
g from half an inch to a foot in=20

thickness. This is most perceptible among the loose masses; but it exists a=
lso in that in place.=20

Whether this circumstance be accidental, I will not attempt to decide.  A l=
arge proportion of the=20

greenstone of our vicinity constitutes the base of amygdaloid. The imbedded=
 substances are=20

calcareous spar, quartz, chalcedony, analcime, prehnite, &c. as will be mor=
e particularly=20

mentioned hereafter. Globular concretions of greenstone are common in this =
amygdaloid, several=20

inches in=20
