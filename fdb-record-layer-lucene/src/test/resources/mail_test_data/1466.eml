  In his own account of his love story Abelard says that he was attracted b=
y the beauty, the youth, and the mental attainments of Heloise, the niece o=
f _
and his nobles, and they acted unjustly with respect to them, _disbelieving=
 in the signs_: but see=20

what was the end of the corrupt doers. And Moses said, O Pharaoh, verily I =
am an apostle from=20

the Lord of the worlds _unto thee_. _But he charged him with falsehood: so =
he said, I am_ right=20

not to say of God aught but the truth. I have come unto you with a proof fr=
om your Lord: therefore=20

send with me _to Syria_ the children of Israel.--_Pharaoh_ said _unto him_,=
 If thou hast come with=20

a Dame.  During the three or four years that followed this signal triumph o=
ver his old master,=20

Abelard enjoyed a popularity and a reputation for learning almost without p=
arallel. He was of=20

handsome presence, polished and winning in manners, accomplished even in th=
e little arts and=20

graces of the society of the period. All this would account for his persona=
l popularity; but his was=20

really a brilliant mind, fascinatingly if dangerously logical, and straight=
forward in dealing with vexed=20

be of those who speak truth, So he cast down his rod; and lo, it was a mani=
fest serpent.[271] And=20

he drew forth his hand _from his bosom_; and lo, it was white _and radiant_=
 unto the=20

beholders.[272] The nobles of the people of Pharaoh said, Verily this is a =
knowing enchanter: he=20

desireth to expel you from your land. What then do ye command?--They answer=
ed, Put off for a=20

time him and his brother, and send unto the cities collectors [of the of ph=
ilosophy and theology.=20

And with all his learning he knew how to meet the difficulties of ordinary =
minds, to present his=20

arguments in a style not only simple but lucid and entertaining. He brought=
 to his work a precious=20

quality--enthusiasm. From all parts of Europe students flocked to him, by h=
undreds, by thousands;=20

and with the offerings they brought he was rich. Then it was that pride pre=
pared his ruin. "Believing=20

myself henceforth the=20

hall we surely=20

have a reward if we be the party who overcome? He answered, Yea; and verily=
 ye shall be of=20

those who are admitted near [unto my person]. They said, O Moses, either do=
 thou cast down _thy=20

rod_, or we will cast down _what we have with us_. He replied, Cast ye. And=
 when they cast down=20

_their cords and their rods_, they enchanted the eyes of the men, _divertin=
g them from the true=20

perception of them_; and they terrified them; _for they imagined them to be=
 serpents running_;=20

and they I had no more opposition to encounter or accusation to fear, I com=
menced to give rein to=20

advanced in the paths=20

of philosophy and theology, the further I was getting, by my impure life, f=
rom philosophers and=20

etence, exaggeration,=20

and vain rhetoric, we cannot say. It is an unfortunate fact that what is re=
cognized as the language=20

of religion is so highly colored, so tropical, so manifestly not to be take=
