 In some countries=20

they are not even contented with the natural colour of the hair, either if =
black or blonde, but they=20

use a pigment that turns it red. I only noticed this among the Somauli trib=
e; and that of the Nuehr,=20

some of the wildest savages of the White Nile, until I returned to England,=
 where I found the=20

custom was becoming general among the civilized, and that ladies were adopt=
ing the lovely tint of=20

the British fox. The Arab women do not indulge in fashions; strictly conser=
vative in their manners=20

and customs, they never imitate, but they simply vie with each other in the=
 superlativeness of their=20

own style; thus the dressing of the hair is a most elaborate affair, which =
occupies a considerable=20

portion of their time. It is quite impossible for an Arab woman to arrange =
her own hair; she=20

therefore employs an assistant, who, if clever in the art, will generally o=
ccupy about three days=20

before it is satisfactorily concluded. First, the hair must be combed with =
a long skewer-like pin;=20

then, when well divided, it becomes possible to use an exceedingly coarse w=
ooden comb. When=20

the hair is reduced to reasonable order by the latter process, a vigorous h=
unt takes place, which=20

occupies about an hour, according to the amount of game preserved; the spor=
t concluded, the hair=20

is rubbed with a mixture of oil of roses, myrrh, and sandal-wood dust mixed=
 with a powder of=20

cloves and cassia. When well greased and rendered somewhat stiff by the sol=
ids thus introduced,=20

it is plaited into at least two hundred fine plaits; each of these plaits i=
s then smeared with a mixture=20

of sandal-wood dust and either gum water or paste of dhurra flour. On the l=
ast day of the=20

operation, each tiny plait is carefully opened by the long hair-pin or skew=
er, and the head is=20

ravissante. Scented and frizzled in this manner, with a well-greased tope o=
r robe, the Arab lady's=20

toilet is complete, her head is then a little larger than the largest sized=
 English mop, and her=20

perfume is something between the aroma of a perfumer's shop and the monkey-=
house at the=20

Zoological Gardens. This is considered "very killing," and I have been quit=
e of that opinion when a=20

crowd of women have visited my wife in our tent, with the thermometer at 95=
 degrees, and they=20

have kindly consented to allow me to remain as one of the party. It is hard=
ly necessary to add, that=20

the operation of hair-dressing is not often performed, but that the effect =
is permanent for about a=20

week, during which time the game become so excessively lively, that the cre=
atures require stirring=20

up with the long hair-pin or skewer whenever too unruly; this appears to be=
 constantly necessary=20

from the vigorous employment of the ruling sceptre during conversation. A l=
evee of Arab women in=20

the tent was therefore a disagreeable invasion, as we dreaded the fugitives=
; fortunately, they=20

appeared to cling to the followers of Mahomet in preference to Christians. =
 The plague of lice=20

brought upon the Egyptians by Moses has certainly adhered to the country ev=
er since, if "lice" is=20

the proper translation of the Hebrew word in the Old Testament: it is my ow=
n opinion that the=20

insects thus inflicted upon the population were not lice, but ticks. Exod. =
viii. 16, "The dust became=20

lice throughout all Egypt;" again, Exod. viii. 17, "Smote dust . . . it bec=
ame lice in man and beast."=20

Now the louse that infects the human body and hair has no connexion whateve=
r with "dust," and if=20

subject to a few hours' exposure to the dry heat of the burning sand, it wo=
uld shrivel and die; but=20

the tick is an inhabitant of the dust, a dry horny insect without any appar=
ent moisture in its=20

composition; it lives in hot sand and dust, where it cannot possibly obtain=
 nourishment, until some=20

wretched animal should lie down upon the spot, and become covered with thes=
e horrible vermin. I=20

have frequently seen desert places so infested with ticks, that the ground =
was perfectly alive with=20

them, and it would have been impossible to have rested on the earth; in suc=
h spots, the passage=20



in Exodus has frequently occurred to me as bearing reference to these vermi=
n, which are the=20

greatest enemies to man and beast. It is well known that, from the size of =
a grain of sand in their=20

natural state, they will distend to the size of a hazel-nut after having pr=
eyed for some days upon=20

the blood of an animal. The Arabs are invariably infested with lice, not on=
ly in their hair, but upon=20

their bodies and clothes; even the small charms or spells worn upon the arm=
 in neatly-sewn=20

leathern packets are full of these vermin. Such spells are generally verses=
 copied from the Koran=20

by the Faky, or priest, who receives some small gratuity in exchange; the m=
en wear several of=20

such talismans upon the arm above the elbow, but the women wear a large bun=
ch of charms, as a=20

sort of chatelaine, suspended beneath their clothes round the waist. Althou=
gh the tope or robe,=20

loosely but gracefully arranged around the body, appears to be the whole of=
 the costume, the=20

women wear beneath this garment a thin blue cotton cloth tightly bound roun=
d the loins, which=20

descends to a little above the knee; beneath this, next to the skin, is the=
 last garment, the rahat--

the latter is the only clothing of young girls, and may be either perfectly=
 simple or adorned with=20

beads and cowrie shells according to the fancy of the wearer; it is perfect=
ly effective as a dress,=20

and admirably adapted to the climate.  The rahat is a fringe of fine dark b=
rown or reddish twine,=20

fastened to a belt, and worn round the waist. On either side are two long t=
assels, that are generally=20

ornamented with beads or cowries, and dangle nearly to the ankles, while th=
e rahat itself should=20

descend to a little above the knee, rather shorter than a Highland kilt. No=
thing can be prettier or=20

more simple than this dress, which, although short, is of such thickly hang=
ing fringe, that it=20

perfectly answers the purpose for which it is intended. Many of the Arab gi=
rls are remarkably good-

looking, with fine figures until they become mothers. They and exact nothin=
g from me; and if I had=20

any religion except Madre Natura, I am not sure I would not prefer Islamism=
; which is at least=20

simple, and as little sacerdotal as any organized creed can be. The Porte m=
ade me a liberal offer,=20

and I accepted it. It so happened that, the moment I entered their service,=
 I was wanted. They had=20

a difficulty on their Dalmatian frontier; I settled it in a way they liked.=
 And now I am sent here with=20

full powers, and am a pacha of the highest class, and with a prospect of so=
me warm work. I do not=20

know what your views are, but, if you would like a little more soldiering, =
I will put you on my staff;=20

and, for aught I know, we may find your winter-quarters at Grand Cairo=E2=
=80=94they say a pleasant place=20

for such a season.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy soldiering has not been very fortu=
nate,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand I am not quite=20

as great an admirer of the Turks as you are, general. My mind is rather on =
the pursuits of peace,=20

and twenty hours ago I had a dream of settling on the shores of the Sea of =
Galilee.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhatever=20

you do,=E2=80=9D said the general, =E2=80=9Cgive up dreams.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI think you may be right in that,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, with=20

half a sigh.  =E2=80=9CAction may not always be happiness,=E2=80=9D said th=
e general; =E2=80=9Cbut there is no happiness=20

without action. If you will not fight the Egyptians, were I you, I would re=
turn home and plunge into=20

affairs. That was a fine castle of yours I visited one morning; a man who l=
ives in such a place must=20

be able to find a great deal to do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI almost wish I were=
 there, with you for my companion,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThe wheel may turn,=E2=80=9D said the general; =E2=80=9C=
but I begin to think I shall not see much of=20

Europe again. I have given it some of my best years and best blood; and, if=
 I had assisted in=20

establishing the Roman republic, I should not have lived in vain; but the o=
ld imposture seems to=20

me stronger than ever. I have got ten good years in me yet; and, if I be we=
ll supported and in luck,=20

for, after all, every thing depends on fortune, and manage to put a couple =
of hundred thousand=20

men in perfect discipline, I may find some consolation for not blowing up S=
t. Peter=E2=80=99s, and may do=20



something for the freedom of mankind on the banks of the Danube.=E2=80=9D  =
     CHAPTER 80 Mrs.=20

Putney Giles, in full toilet, was standing before the mantel-piece of her d=
rawing-room in Hyde Park=20

Gardens, and watching, with some anxiety, the clock that rested on it. It w=
as the dinner-hour, and=20

Mr. Putney Giles, particular in such matters, had not returned. No one look=
ed forward to his=20

dinner, and a chat with his wife, with greater zest than Mr. Putney Giles; =
and he deserved the=20

gratification which both incidents afforded him, for he fairly earned it. F=
ull of news and bustle,=20

brimful of importance and prosperity, sunshiny and successful, his daily re=
turn home=E2=80=94which, with=20

many, perhaps most, men, is a process lugubriously monotonous=E2=80=94was i=
n Hyde Park Gardens,=20

even to Apollonia, who possessed many means of amusement and occupation, a =
source ever of=20

interest and excitement.  To-day too, particularly, for their great client,=
 friend, and patron, Lothair,=20

had arrived last night, from the Continent, at Muriel House, and had direct=
ed Mr. Putney Giles to=20

be in attendance on him on the afternoon of this day.  Muriel House was a f=
amily mansion in the=20

Green Park. It was built of hewn stone, during the last century=E2=80=94a P=
alladian edifice, for a time=20

much neglected, but now restored and duly prepared for the reception of its=
 lord and master by the=20

same combined energy and taste which had proved so satisfactory and success=
ful at Muriel=20

Towers.  It was a long room, the front saloon at Hyde Park Gardens, and the=
 door was as remote=20

as possible from the mantel-piece. It opened suddenly, but only the panting=
 face of Mr. Putney=20

Giles was seen, as he poured forth in hurried words: =E2=80=9CMy dear, drea=
dfully late, but I can dress in=20

five minutes. I only opened the door in passing, to tell you that I have se=
en our great friend;=20

wonderful man! but I will tell you all at dinner, or after. It was not he w=
ho kept me, but the Duke of=20

Brecon. The duke has been with me two hours. I had a good mind to bring him=
 home to dinner,=20

and give him a bottle of my =E2=80=9848. They like that sort of thing, but =
it will keep,=E2=80=9D and the head=20

vanished.  The Duke of Brecon would not have dined ill, had he honored this=
 household. It is a=20

pleasant thing to see an opulent and prosperous man of business, sanguine a=
nd full of health, and=20

a little overworked, at that royal meal, dinner. How he enjoys his soup! An=
d how curious in his fish!=20

How critical in his entr=C3=A9e, and how nice in his Welsh mutton! His exha=
usted brain rallies under the=20

glass of dry sherry, and he realizes all his dreams with the aid of claret =
that has the true flavor of=20

the violet.  =E2=80=9CAnd now, my dear Apollonia,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Putney =
Giles, when the servants had retired,=20

and he turned his chair and played with a new nut from the Brazils, =E2=80=
=9Cabout our great friend. Well, I=20

was there at two o=E2=80=99clock, and found him at breakfast. Indeed, he sa=
id that, had he not given me an=20

appointment, he thought he should not have risen at all. So delighted he wa=
s to find himself again=20

in an English bed. Well, he told me every thing that had happened. I never =
knew a man so=20

unreserved, and so different from what he was when I first knew him, for he=
 never much cared=20

then to talk about himself. But no egotism, nothing of that sort of thing=
=E2=80=94all his mistakes, all his=20

blunders, as he called them. He told me every thing, that I might thoroughl=
y understand his=20

position, and that he might judge whether the steps I had taken in referenc=
e to it were adequate.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CI suppose about his religion,=E2=80=9D said Apollonia. =E2=80=9CWh=
at is he, after all?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAs sound as you are. But=20

you are right; that was the point on which he was most anxious. He wrote, y=
ou know, to me from=20

Malta, when the account of his conversion first appeared, to take all neces=
sary steps to contradict=20

the announcement, and counteract its consequences. He gave me carte blanche=
, and was=20

anxious to know precisely what I had done. I told him that a mere contradic=
tion, anonymous, or=20

from a third person, however=20


_
age of thirteen or fourteen, but frequently at twelve, or even earlier. Unt=
il married, the rahat is their=20

sole garment. Throughout the Arab tribes of Upper Egypt, chastity is a nece=
ssity, as an operation=20

is performed at the early age of from three to five years that thoroughly p=
rotects all females, and=20

which renders them physically proof against incontinency.  There is but lit=
tle love-making among=20

the Arabs. The affair of matrimony usually commences by a present to the fa=
ther of the girl, which,=20

if accepted, is followed by a similar advance to the girl herself, and the =
arrangement is completed.=20

All the friends of both parties are called together for the wedding; pistol=
s and guns are fired off, if=20

possessed. There is much feasting, and the unfortunate bridegroom undergoes=
 the ordeal of=20

whipping by the relations of his bride, in order to test his courage. Somet=
imes this punishment is=20

exceedingly severe, being inflicted with the coorbatch or whip of hippopota=
mus hide, which is=20

cracked vigorously about his ribs and back. If the happy husband wishes to =
be considered a man=20

worth having, he must receive the chastisement with an expression of enjoym=
ent; in which case=20

the crowds of women again raise their thrilling cry in admiration. After th=
e rejoicings of the day are=20

over, the bride is led in the evening to the residence of her husband, whil=
e a beating of drums and=20

strumming of guitars (rhababas) are kept up for some hours during the night=
, with the usual=20

discordant idea of singing.  There is no divorce court among the Arabs. The=
y are not sufficiently=20

advanced in civilization to accept a pecuniary fine as the price of a wife'=
s dishonour; but a stroke=20

of the husband's sword, or a stab with the knife, is generally the ready re=
medy for infidelity.=20

Although strictly Mahometans, the women are never veiled; neither do they a=
dopt the excessive=20

reserve assumed by the Turks and Egyptians. The Arab women are generally id=
le; and one of the=20

conditions of accepting a suitor is, that a female slave is to be provided =
for the special use of the=20

wife. No Arab woman will engage herself as a domestic servant; thus, so lon=
g as their present=20

customs shall remain unchanged, slaves are creatures of necessity. Although=
 the law of Mahomet=20

limits the number of wives for each man to four at one time, the Arab women=
 do not appear to=20

restrict their husbands to this allowance, and the slaves of the establishm=
ent occupy the position=20

of concubines.  The customs of the Arabs in almost every detail have remain=
ed unchanged. Thus,=20

in dress, in their nomadic habits, food, the anointing with oil (Eccles. ix=
. 8, "Let thy garments be=20

always white, and let thy head lack no ointment"), they retain the habits a=
nd formalities of the=20

distant past, and the a detailed narrative, like that in all the papers, of=
 his walking in procession=20

and holding a lighted taper, and all that sort of thing. What I did was thi=
s. I commenced building, by=20

his direction, two new churches on his estate, and announced in the local j=
ournals, copied in=20

London, that he would be present at the consecration of both. I subscribed,=
 in his name, and=20

largely, to all the diocesan societies, gave a thousand pounds to the Bisho=
p of London=E2=80=99s fund, and=20

accepted for him the office of steward, for this year, for the Sons of the =
Clergy. Then, when the=20

public feeling was ripe, relieved from all its anxieties, and beginning to =
get indignant at the=20

calumnies that had been so freely circulated, the time for paragraphs had a=
rrived, and one=20

appeared stating that a discovery had taken place of the means by which an =
unfounded and=20

preposterous account of the conversion of a distinguished young English nob=
leman at Rome had=20

been invented and circulated, and would probably furnish the occasion for a=
n action for libel. And=20

now his return and appearance at the Chapel Royal, next Sunday, will clinch=
 the whole business.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CAnd he was satisfied?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMost satisfied; a little =
anxious whether his personal friends, and=20

particularly the Brentham family, were assured of the truth. He travelled h=
ome with the duke=E2=80=99s son=20



and Lord St. Aldegonde, but they came from remote parts, and their news fro=
m home was not very=20

recent.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd how does he look?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery we=
ll; never saw him look better. He is handsomer than=20

he was. But he is changed. I could not conceive in a year that any one coul=
d be so changed. He=20

was young for his years; he is now old for his years. He was, in fact, a bo=
y; he is now a man; and=20

yet it is only a year. He said it seemed to him ten.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe =
has been through a fiery furnace,=E2=80=9D said=20

Apollonia.  =E2=80=9CWell, he has borne it well,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Giles. =
=E2=80=9CIt is worth while serving such a client, so=20

cordial, so frank, and yet so full of thought. He says he does not in the l=
east regret all the money=20

he has wasted. Had he remained at home, it would have gone to building a ca=
thedral.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd a=20

popish one!=E2=80=9D said Apollonia. =E2=80=9CI cannot agree with him,=E2=
=80=9D she continued, =E2=80=9Cthat his Italian campaign=20

was a waste of money. It will bear fruit. We shall still see the end of the=
 =E2=80=98abomination of=20

desolation.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery likely,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Gile=
s; =E2=80=9Cbut I trust my client will have no more to do with such=20

questions either way.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd did he ask after his friends?=
=E2=80=9D said Apollonia.  =E2=80=9CVery much: he asked=20

after you. I think he went through all the guests at Muriel Towers except t=
he poor Campians. He=20

spoke, to me about the colonel, to whom it appears he has written; but Theo=
dora he never=20

mentioned, except by some periphrasis, some allusion to a great sorrow, or=
=20


_
but the exact picture of those periods which are historically recorded in t=
he Old Testament. The=20

perfumery of the women already described, bears a resemblance to that prepa=
red by Moses for=20

the altar, which was forbidden to be used by the people. "Take thou also un=
to thee principal=20

spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so m=
uch, even two=20

hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty sheke=
ls, and of cassia five=20

hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin=
: and thou shalt make it=20

an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apotheca=
ry: it shall be an holy=20

anointing oil."--Exod. xxx. 23-25.  The manner of anointing by the ancients=
 is exhibited by the=20

Arabs at the present day, who, as I have already described, make use of so =
large a quantity of=20

grease at one application that, when melted, it runs down over their person=
s and clothes. In Ps.=20

cxxxiii. 2, "It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down =
upon the beard, even=20

Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments."  In all hot c=
limates, oil or other fat is=20

necessary to the skin as a protection from the sun, where the body is eithe=
r naked or very thinly=20

clad. I have frequently seen both Arabs and the negro tribes of Africa suff=
er great discomfort when=20

for some days the supply of grease has been exhausted; the skin has become =
coarse, rough,=20

almost scaly, and peculiarly unsightly, until the much-loved fat has been o=
btained, and the general=20

appearance of smoothness has been at once restored by an active smearing. T=
he expression in=20

Ps. civ. 15, "And oil to make his face to shine," describes the effect that=
 was then considered=20

beautifying, as it is at the present time.  The Arabs generally adhere stri=
ctly to their ancient=20

customs, independently of the comparatively recent laws established by Maho=
met. Thus,=20

concubinage is not considered a breach of morality; neither is it regarded =
by the legitimate wives=20

with jealousy. They attach great importance to the laws of about the St. Je=
romes, and said more=20

than once that he owed his life to Miss Arundel. He dwelt a good deal upon =
this. He asked also a=20

great deal about the Brentham family. They seem the people whom he most aff=
ects. When I told=20

him of Lady Corisande=E2=80=99s approaching union with the Duke of Brecon, =
I did not think he half liked=20

it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut is it settled?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe same as=E2=
=80=94. The duke has been with me two hours to-day about his=20

arrangements. He has proposed to the parents, who are delighted with the ma=
tch, and has=20

received every encouragement from the young lady. He looks upon it as certa=
in.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wish our kind=20

friend had not gone abroad,=E2=80=9D said Apollonia.  =E2=80=9CWell, at any=
 rate, he has come back,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Giles;=20

=E2=80=9Cthat is something. I am sure I more than once never expected to se=
e him again.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe has every=20

virtue, and every charm,=E2=80=9D said Apollonia, =E2=80=9Cand principles t=
hat are now proved. I shall never forget=20

his kindness at the Towers. I wish he were settled for life. But who is wor=
thy of him? I hope he will=20

not fall into the clutches of that popish girl. I have sometimes, from what=
 I observed at Muriel, and=20

other reasons, a dread misgiving.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 81 It was the firs=
t night that Lothair had slept in=20

his own house, and, when he awoke in the morning, he was quite bewildered, =
and thought for a=20

moment he was in the Palazzo Agostini. He had not reposed in so spacious an=
d lofty a chamber=20

since he was at Rome. And this brought all his recollection to his Roman li=
fe, and every thing that=20

had happened there. =E2=80=9CAnd yet, after all,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=
=9Chad it not been for Clare Arundel, I should never=20

have seen Muriel House. I owe to her my life.=E2=80=9D His relations with t=
he St. Jerome family were=20

doubtless embarrassing, even painful; and yet his tender and susceptible na=
ture could not for a=20

moment tolerate that he should passively submit to an estrangement from tho=
se who had=20

conferred on him so much kindness, and whose ill-considered and injurious c=
ourses, as he now=20



esteemed them, were perhaps, and probably, influenced and inspired by exalt=
ed, even sacred=20

motives.  He=20


_
to the customs of their forefathers; neither can they understand the reason=
 for a change of habit in=20

any respect where necessity has not suggested the reform. The Arabs are cre=
atures of necessity;=20

their nomadic life is compulsory, as the existence of their flocks and herd=
s depends upon the=20

pasturage. Thus, with the change of seasons they must change their localiti=
es, according to the=20

presence of fodder for their cattle. Driven to and fro by the accidents of =
climate, the Arab has been=20

compelled to become a wanderer; and precisely as the wild beasts of the cou=
ntry are driven from=20

place to place either by the arrival of the fly, the lack of pasturage, or =
by the want of water, even so=20

must the flocks of the Arab obey the law of necessity, in a country where t=
he burning sun and total=20

absence of rain for nine months of the year convert the green pastures into=
 a sandy desert. The=20

Arabs and their herds must follow the example of the wild beasts, and live =
as wild and wandering a=20

life. In the absence of a fixed home, without a city, or even a village tha=
t is permanent, there can=20

be no change of custom. There is no stimulus to competition in the style of=
 architecture that is to=20

endure only for a few months; no municipal laws suggest deficiencies that o=
riginate improvements.=20

The Arab cannot halt in one spot longer than the pasturage will support his=
 flocks; therefore his=20

necessity is food for his beasts. The object of his life being fodder, he m=
ust wander in search of=20

the ever-changing supply. His wants must be few, as the constant changes of=
 encampment=20

necessitate the transport of all his household goods; Should he call, or sh=
ould he write? He wished=20

he could do something to show to Miss Arundel how much he appreciated her k=
indness, and how=20

grateful he was. She was a fine creature, and all her errors were noble one=
s; enthusiasm, energy,=20

devotion to a sublime cause. Errors, but are these errors? Are they not, on=
 the contrary, qualities=20

which should command admiration in any one? and in a woman=E2=80=94and a be=
autiful woman=E2=80=94more=20

than admiration?  There is always something to worry you. It comes as regul=
arly as sunrise. Here=20

was Lothair under his own roof again, after strange and trying vicissitudes=
, with his health=20

restored, his youth little diminished, with some strange memories and many =
sweet ones; on the=20

whole, once more in great prosperity, and yet his mind harped only on one v=
exing thought, and=20

that was his painful and perplexed relations with the St. Jerome family.  H=
is thoughts were a little=20

distracted from this harassing theme by the novelty of his house, and the p=
leasure it gave him. He=20

admired the double staircase and the somewhat heavy, yet richly-carved ceil=
ings; and the look into=20

the park, shadowy and green, with a rich summer sun, and the palace in the =
distance. What an=20

agreeable contrast to his hard, noisy sojourn in a bran-new, brobdingnagian=
 hotel, as was his=20

coarse fate when he was launched into London life! This made him think of m=
any comforts for=20

which he ought to be grateful, and then he remembered Muriel Towers, and ho=
w completely and=20

capitally every thing was there prepared and appointed, and while he was th=
inking over all=20

this=E2=80=94and kindly of the chief author of these satisfactory=20


_
minimum the domestic furniture and utensils. No desires for strange and fre=
sh objects excite his=20

mind to improvement, or alter his original habits; he must limit his impedi=
menta, not increase them.=20

Thus with a few necessary articles he is contented. Mats for his tent, rope=
s manufactured with the=20

hair of his goats and camels, pots for carrying fat; water-jars and instanc=
es in which that individual=20

had shown, not merely professional dexterity and devotion, but some of the =
higher qualities that=20

make life sweet and pleasant=E2=80=94Mr. Putney Giles was announced, and Lo=
thair sprang forward and=20

gave him his hand with a cordiality which repaid at once that perfect but l=
arge-hearted lawyer for=20

all his exertions, and some anxieties that he had=20


_
water-skins for the desert, and sheep-skin bags for his clothes,--these are=
 the requirements of the=20

Arabs. Their patterns have never changed, but the water-jar of to-day is of=
 the same form that was=20

carried to the well by the women of thousands of years ago. The conversatio=
n of the Arabs is in=20

the exact style of the Old Testament. The name of God is coupled with every=
 trifling incident in life,=20

and they believe in the continual action of Divine special interference. Sh=
ould a famine afflict the=20

country, it is expressed in the stern language of the Bible--"The Lord has =
sent a grievous famine=20

upon the land;" or,  Nothing in life is more remarkable than the unnecessar=
y anxiety which we=20

endure, and generally, occasion ourselves. Between four and five o=E2=80=99=
clock, having concluded his=20

long conference with Mr. Putney Giles, Lothair, as if he were travelling th=
e principal street of a=20

foreign town, or rather treading on tiptoe like a prince in some enchanted =
castle, ventured to walk=20

down St. James Street, and the very first person he met was Lord St. Jerome=
!  Nothing could be=20

more unaffectedly hearty than his greeting by that good man and thorough ge=
ntleman. =E2=80=9CI saw, by=20

the Post, you had arrived,=E2=80=9D said Lord St. Jerome, =E2=80=9Cand we=
=20


_
a famine, and it came upon the land." Should their cattle fall sick, it is =
considered to be an affliction=20

by Divine command; or should the flocks prosper and multiply particularly d=
uring one season, the=20

prosperity is attributed to special interference. Nothing can happen in the=
 usual routine of daily life=20

without a direct connexion with the hand of God, according to the Arab's be=
lief.  This striking=20

similarity to the descriptions of the Old Testament is exceedingly interest=
ing to a be to see you=20

again. And looking so well! Quite yourself! I never saw you looking better.=
 You have been to Egypt=20

with Lord St. Aldegonde, I think? It was the wisest thing you could do. I s=
aid to Gertrude, when you=20

went to Sicily, =E2=80=98If I were Lothair, I would go a good deal farther =
than Sicily.=E2=80=99 You wanted change of=20

scene and air, more than any man I know.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd how are the=
y all?=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cmy first visit will=20

be to them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd they will be delighted to see you. Lady =
St. Jerome is=20
