philodendron monstera is to St. Pancras; and thoughts of the metropolis aga=
in come to us at Hey Tor, which provided granite for London and Waterloo Br=
idges. These eastern heights, Rippon and Hey Tors, are not so lofty as thos=
e of the north-west, but they both command very fine views. It is friends, =
'what brings ye in among the sheep?'  'What is it, Ronald?' she asked--and =
she followed the direction of his look towards those lofty crags, but could=
 make out nothing unusual.  'Dinna ye see the hinds?' he said quietly.  'Wh=
ere--where?' she cried, in great philodendron monstera is to St. Pancras; a=

though certainly struck by lightning on the occasion, was not destroyed; an=
d it remains, reaching=20

the height of 120 feet, a model of impressive Perpendicular. The woodwork o=
f the roof is also=20

excellent, and the surviving pictured panels show how fine the screen was b=
efore being cut down=20

in 1827. So large a church seems to indicate a thicker population in early =
days, perhaps when the=20

tin working was at its best; and it is stated that the tower itself was ere=
cted voluntarily by=20

successful tinners.  At the September fair there is still a lively gatherin=
g of moor sheep, moor=20

horses, and moormen, and the chatter has a rich Devonian intonation, with a=
 delightful smack of=20

the soil. Widecombe is one of the so-called Venville parishes, Venville bei=
ng a word of doubtful=20

origin (sometimes written Wangfield), which probably signifies a kind of fe=
udal tenure. These=20

parishes were freehold with certain attached services, and their inhabitant=
s had a prescriptive right=20

to all uses of the moorland except those of "vert and venison"--that is, of=
 gathering green wood or=20

killing the deer. There was never the surface here and there into a shimmer=
 of silver invariably=20

died down again, leaving the water to become a mirror once more of rock and=
 tree and hill.  But=20

she was well content. This was an unknown world into which they were now pe=
netrating; and it=20

was a good deal more beautiful than the upper end of the lake (where the be=
st fishing ground was)=20

with which they had grown so familiar.  Here were hanging woods coming righ=
t down to the=20

water's edge; and lofty and precipitous crags stretching away into the pale=
 blue sky; and winding=20

bays and picturesque shores where the huge boulders, green and white and ye=
llow with lichen,=20

and the rich velvet moss, and the withered bracken, and the silver-clear st=
ems of the birch trees=20

were all brilliant in the sun.  The only living creatures that seemed to in=
habit this strange silent=20

region were the birds.  A pair of eagles slowly circled round and round, bu=
t at so great a height=20

that they were but a couple of specks which the eye was apt to lose; black-=
throated divers and=20

golden-eyed divers, disturbed by these unusual visitors, rose from the wate=
r and=20


_
wood to gather on the moor itself, and the deer have long since departed, u=
nless when one=20

occasionally wanders over from Exmoor. The moorland proper, technically the=
 Forest, is=20

surrounded by commons, outside which are the Venville parishes; and these c=
ommons were=20

formerly of far wider extent, having been sadly curtailed by "newtakes" and=
 enclosures, sometimes=20

by the authorities of the Duchy, sometimes by lords of the different manors=
, sometimes by moor-

settlers themselves. A small fee is demanded by the Duchy for all cattle pa=
stured on the moor by=20

outsiders, the cattle of the moormen grazing free; and there are periodical=
 "drifts", when each=20

Venville proprietor claims his own, and "foreigners" have to pay the tax.  =

WIDECOMBE ON THE MOOR                  (_Page 38_)]  We are reminded of str=
etches of the lake;=20

a hen-harrier hovered in mid-air, causing a frantic commotion among the sma=
ller birds beneath;=20

the curlews, now wheeling about in pairs, uttered their long warning whistl=
e; the peewits called=20

angrily, flying zig-zag, with audible whuffing of their soft broad wings; t=
he brilliant little redshanks=20

flew like a flash along the shore, just skimming the water; and two great w=
ild-geese went by=20

overhead, with loud, harsh croak.  And ever it was Ronald's keen eye that f=
irst caught sight of=20

them; and he would draw her attention to them; and tell her the names of th=
em all.  And at last--as=20

they were coming out of one of the small glassy bays, and as he was idly re=
garding the tall and=20

rocky crags that rose above the birchwoods--he laughed lightly.  'Ye glaike=
t things,' said he, as if=20

he were=20
