The appearance of Mr. Albert Newton at the window elicited a shriek from th=
e women and girls,=20

and a corresponding cry of alarm from the men below.  "My God!" exclaimed M=
r. Albert Newton,=20

"our place is on fire."  As he spoke, the flames burst through the lower wi=
ndows in a dense mass;=20

and although the part of the building in which the manufacturer and his gue=
st were standing was=20

considerably to the east of that part on which the fire had taken its princ=
ipal hold, there was=20

sufficient palpable cause of danger to whiten the cheeks of both men, and t=
o cause the proprietor--

who had, of course, far less experience in such matters than the surveyor, =
Mr. Phillimore--to=20

betray a degree of confusion which gave that worthy gentleman perhaps more =
anxiety than the fire=20

alone could have done.  With a degree of calmness and self-possession worth=
y of the crisis, Mr.=20

Phillimore asked Mr. Newton what means of escape they had, and implored him=
 to be calm, as it=20

might need all their self-possession as well as their courage to extricate =
themselves.  "Shall we=20

leap out of the window?" exclaimed the embarrassed man.  "No," was the firm=
 reply.  "Do you=20

think we can safely descend the staircase?"  "Let us try."  The party then =
descended one flight of=20

stairs, but found a dense vapour issuing up the staircase,--an impassable d=
ifficulty.  "We are lost!"=20

exclaimed Mr. Newton.  The surveyor's countenance betrayed understood: yet,=
 so long as they=20

are beyond the control of man, they will retain for him an eerie uncanny fa=
scination. The pigmy=20

has harnessed the steam and chained the lightning: but when the storm cloud=
s lower and the=20

forests moan, the sea roars and the lightning glows, he stands in fear and =
awe before a power=20

whose might he but vaguely comprehends. He may know of the winds, whence an=
d whither=20

bound; but when the Stygian darkness has passed on, leaving wreck and ruin,=
 want and woe,=20

desolation and despair, shattered homes and hopes, and bleeding hearts, thi=
s knowledge of law=20

is, for the nonce, forgotten, and the hurricane is transformed, in his diso=
rdered vision, into a=20

demon of wrath, or caprice; or he speaks, hesitatingly it may be, of the my=
sterious dispensation of=20

an inscrutable providence. But in the mighty wind, as in the soughing breez=
e, there is only=20

obedience to universal law. But when the Author of law displays his power, =
man=E2=80=99s instinct,=20

however unwilling his reason, acknowledges a God.     CHAPTER V.  THE LOUIS=
VILLE=20

TORNADO.      =E2=80=9CAt eve along the calm resplendent west      I marked=
 a cloud alive with fairy light,=20

So warmly pure, so sweetly, richly bright,      It seemed a spirit of ether=
, floating blest,      In its own=20

happy empire! While possest      With admiration of the marvelous light,   =
   Slowly its hues, opal=20

and chrysolite,      Waned on the shadowy=20

that the terrified man's ejaculation involved an awful truth.  "Let us seek=
 the roof. Have you any=20

rope at hand?"  "Yes," returned Mr. Newton.  Silently and rapidly they flew=
 rather than ran up the=20

stairs, Newton leading the way to where a quantity of stout hempen rope, of=
 a quarter of an inch=20

diameter, was lying in a corner of a room devoted to empty packages and was=
te.  The surveyor's=20

experienced eye measured the extent and capacity of this medium of escape w=
ith considerable=20

accuracy, and saw that it would suffice for the purpose of liberating them,=
 if they had the discretion=20

to wisely use the means at their disposal.  Scarcely a word was exchanged b=
etween the two men.=20

In almost total silence Mr. Phillimore drew out the first piece of rope and=
 fastened it adroitly round=20

the waist and under the arms of the proprietor of the establishment, and th=
en fastened another=20

length of the cord to the one which encircled his terrified companion. The =
third end was joined in=20

the same manner.  "That will, I think, serve our purpose," were the first w=
ords uttered, and these=20

were spoken by the surveyor.  Mr. Newton may be excused for the selfishness=
 which allowed him=20

to avail himself of this means of escape,      The cloud became a terror, w=
hose dark womb,=20

Throbbed with keen lightnings, by destruction hurled,      Red bolt on bolt=
, while a drear ominous=20

gloom      Enveloped Nature: o=E2=80=99er the startled world--      A deep =
alarum--burst the thunder boom=20

And the swift Storm his coal-black wings unfurled!=E2=80=9D   There is a pe=
rspective of news as well as of=20

art, which requires that such features in a view as are supposed to be near=
est to the observer=20

must be given larger detail. It is a natural consequence of the fact that a=
 small object near by may=20

conceal from view a mountain in the distance.  So in the news world a dog r=
un over on=20

Washington avenue takes rank with a wreck in the Indian Ocean. A fight in a=
 neighboring saloon=20

gets ten inches: a strike in Germany ten lines. Your neighbor=E2=80=99s new=
 barn is a good item for the=20

county paper whose editor cares nothing for the new bank in Boston. The Wid=
ow Jones gets a puff=20

for whitewashing her fence; the refitting of the White House gets a line. A=
 million of people who=20

have heard of George Washington, never heard of Alfred the Great.  Now, not=
 a few will think that=20

there is injustice in this. Doubtless the tendency of the time is to exagge=
rate perspective to=20


_
saviour. Few men under the like circumstances would have acted otherwise th=
an he did. It is only=20

in such cases as a ship on fire at sea that heroism, which is ordinarily sl=
ow in its manifestations,=20

rises to the height of that generosity which seeks the preservation of anot=
her rather startling=20

effects. Caricature is characteristic of the age. And yet, there was never =
before a time when so=20

many people took interest in things that lay beyond their own narrow circle=
; even if that interest be=20

from mere curiosity.  Sometimes this self-centered condition of humanity ha=
s=20


_
qualities of our nature. Domestic affections are the most rapid in generati=
ng a spirit of self-denial=20

or self-sacrifice. Brother may yield the boon or privilege of life to his b=
rother, the husband to his=20

wife, or the mother to her child; but strangers, or casual acquaintances, a=
re not given to the=20

manifestation of those sublime virtues, self-abnegation and self-sacrifice.=
  Perhaps, however, Mr.=20

Phillimore might not have parted with the first chance of aspect: as if one=
 should imagine the earth=20

terminated with his own apparent horizon. Some South Sea Islanders called t=
he first white men=20

who visited them, =E2=80=9Csky-breakers.=E2=80=9D The reason is simple. Dwe=
lling on their little islets, mere specks=20

in the deep, and in all their myths and legends having no account of any ot=
her race, they=20

supposed themselves to be the only people in the world. Their sky was a vas=
t wall of blue stones=20

raised by one of their mythical=20
