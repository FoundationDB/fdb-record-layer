philodendron monstera only to look at the soldiers and dance and prink; and=

We have no time to think about war or soldiers or killing."  "Strange!" mut=
tered Red Rex. "I was tempted to go myself into that great building and see=
 if any book might be found with a message in it for me. But  "There was no=
 great number of them fell at Wilmington."  "How stupid I am!" she said; "m=
y poor mind gets quite bewildered. I was thinking of stock, not men; they w=
ent down again three more yesterday, and my broker declines altogether to c=
arry them on from one account to another any more. I bought at 60, and they=
 have done nothing but go down ever since. I generally go by Lord Staggerto=
n's advice, and he recommended me to sell a bear some months ago; but that =
stupid little Spiffy philodendron monstera only to look at the soldiers and=

 go by Lord Staggerton's advice, and he recommended me to sell a bear some =
months ago; but that stupid little Spiffy _
to do it?" asked Harold curiously.  "Aha!" The Red King tried to appear eas=
y and unconscious. "It=20

is my turn now to tell a story, is it? Oho! You want to hear how the old wo=
man got into your=20

careless town, do you? And how she went along your unguarded streets, do yo=
u? And how she=20

crept into your unbolted cottage, do you? And how she found the goodly row =
of pies sitting on the=20

pantry shelf? Ah! I shall never look upon their like again!"  "Nor I," said=
 Harold promptly. "And one=20

was yours, Your Majesty."  Red Rex cast down his eyes. "That is the thing t=
hat chiefly troubles=20

me," he said. "I am sorry I did not know the fact. Your mother was very tho=
ughtful, Harold."=20

"Please tell me all about it, Your Majesty?" begged Harold, settling himsel=
f comfortably on the=20

grass before the War-Lord. "I want to hear the story. It is your turn now. =
You owe me that, at=20

least."  "Well," said Red Rex choosing his words slowly. "You see, I had to=
 have those pies. Kings=20

may take what they choose, because,--well, because they are Kings. That is =
reason enough,--say=20

I! After that first bite you gave me, I felt that I needed more to make me =
happy. A King has a right=20

to be happy, whatever happens to another,--say I. I had brought disguises w=
ith me; for we have=20

ever found them useful in making war. Last night I dressed up as an old wom=
an, in petticoat and=20

apron, bonnet and shawl. None of my men knew. As soon as it was dark I went=
 to the gate of your=20

town, pretending to be a countrywoman returning to Kisington from a visit b=
eyond the frontier, who=20

had not heard of the siege, and begged the guard to let me in quickly out o=
f danger's way. Oh!=20

You are such she will ally the young lady to an affluent native of Bombay. =
So much is known. On=20

the following points I am still in the dark:--  First, What on earth does L=
ady Broadhem mean by=20

telling me to come immediately, as delay may be fatal?--to whom? to me or t=
o Lady Ursula, or=20

herself? My knowledge of her ladyship induces me to incline towards the lat=
ter hypothesis; the=20

suspense is, however, none the less trying.  Second, Does Lady Ursula imagi=
ne that I know how=20

she and Grandon feel towards each other?  Third, Is Grandon under the impre=
ssion that I have=20

actually proposed and been accepted by Lady Ursula?  Fourth, Does my conduc=
t occasionally=20

amount to something more than eccentricity or not?  Fifth--and this was ver=
y unpleasant--Shall I=20

find Grandon at our joint abode? And if so, what shall I say to him?  Sixth=
, Have Grandon and=20

Lady Ursula met, and did anything pass between them?  Thank goodness Grando=
n was at the=20

House. So, after a hurried toilet, I went on to Grosvenor Square. The young=
 ladies were both out.=20

Lady Bridget had taken advantage of the _chaperonage_ of a newly-married ra=
ther fast female=20

cousin, to go to a ball. Lady Ursula had gone to a solitary tea with a crab=
bed old aunt. Lady=20

Broadhem was in her own sitting-room, lying on a couch behind a table cover=
ed with papers. She=20

looked wearily up when I entered, and held out a thin hand for me to do wha=
t I liked with. "How=20

good of you to come, dear Frank!" she said. It was the first time she had e=
ver called me Frank,=20

and I knew she expected me to acknowledge it by pressing her fingers, so I =
squeezed them=20

affectionately. "Broadhem said if I wanted to make sure of you I ought=20


_
me, and let me in because I seemed old and it was late, and they pitied me.=
 The fools! Pity is out=20

of place in war-time. A city so ill-defended deserves to be taken and haras=
sed,--say I!"  "We are=20

trustful in our town because our own hearts are truthful and kind," said Ha=
rold.  "When the warders=20

had let me in," went on Red Rex, "I passed along the main street toward the=
 market-place, with my=20

basket on my arm; and no one noticed me, for it was dark. I knew my way; yo=
u told me yesterday=20

how the streets lay. Presently I came to a great, handsome building with a =
ruined porch,--upon my=20

word, huge as my summer palace by the sea!--out of which people passed in a=
 constant stream,=20

with books under their arms."  "It was our library," said Harold proudly.  =
"So I judged," went on the=20

Red King. "I concealed myself in an angle of the building until it should b=
e darker, mother's would=20

do as well."  "What does the----" I am afraid I mentally said 'old girl'--"=
want, I wonder? It must be=20

really serious, or she would have shammed agitation. There is something abo=
ut this oily calm=20

which is rather portentous. Then she has taken care to have every member of=
 the family out of the=20

house. What is she ringing the bell for now?"  "Tell Lady Ursula when she c=
omes home that I am=20

engaged particularly, and will come up and see her in her bedroom before sh=
e goes to bed," said=20

Lady Broadhem to the servant who answered it.  "Does not Lady Ursula know o=
f my having come=20

to town in answer to your summons?" I asked.  "No, dear child; why should I=
 inflict my troubles=20

upon her? Even Broadhem, to whom I was obliged to speak more openly, only s=
uspects the real=20

state of the case. I have reserved my full confidence for my future son-in-=
law."  I lifted=20


_
came out of that library, who in my country would be playing at war with gu=
ns and toy cannon. Old=20

men and women, whom I should expect to see caring only to smoke and mumble =
and gossip=20

about past wars, brought out books which they hugged lovingly. Young maids,=
 such as in my land=20

care paper-knife. She wanted me to help her on with an obvious remark, whic=
h I declined to make;=20

so, after a pause, she went on, with a deep sigh,----  "What sad news we ke=
ep on getting of those=20

poor dear Confederates, Frank!"  "Let us hope they will recover," said I, e=
ncouragingly.=20
