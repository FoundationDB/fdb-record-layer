o soon, for the child it was too late. In fact, _
to the wrist to such an extent, that by degrees the fragments had sloughed =
away, and the arm had=20

become shrivelled and withered. It now resembled a mass of dried leather, t=
wisted into a=20

deformity, without the slightest shape of an arm; this was about fourteen i=
nches in length from the=20

shoulder; the stiff and crippled hand, with contracted fingers, resembled t=
he claw of a vulture.  In=20

spite of his maimed condition, Roder Sherrif was the most celebrated leader=
 in the elephant hunt.=20

His was the dangerous post to ride close to the head of the infuriated anim=
al and provoke the=20

charge, and then to lead the elephant in pursuit, while the aggageers attac=
ked it from behind; it=20

was in the performance of this duty that he had met with the accident, as h=
is horse had fallen over=20

some hidden obstacle, and was immediately caught. Being an exceedingly ligh=
t weight he had=20

continued to occupy this important position in the hunt, and the rigid fing=
ers of the left hand served=20

as a hook, upon which he could hang the reins.  My battery of rifles was no=
w laid upon a mat for=20

examination; they were in beautiful condition, and they excited the admirat=
ion of the entire party.=20

The perfection of workmanship did not appear to interest them so much as th=
e size of the bores;=20

they thrust their fingers down each muzzle, until they at last came to the =
"Baby," when, finding that=20

two fingers could be easily introduced, they at once fell in love with that=
 rifle in particular. My men=20

explained that it was a "Jenna el Mootfah" (child of a cannon). "Sahe, Jenn=
a el Mootfah kabeer,"=20

they replied (it is true, it is the child of a very big cannon). Their deli=
ght was made perfect by the=20

exhibition of the half-pound explosive shell, the effects of which were dul=
y explained. I told them=20

that I was an old elephant hunter, but that I did not hunt for the sake of =
the ivory, as I wished to=20

explore the country to discover the cause of the Nile inundations, therefor=
e I wished to examine=20

carefully the various Abyssinian rivers; but as I had heard they were wonde=
rful sportsmen, I should=20

like them to join my party, and we could both hunt and explore together. Th=
ey replied that they=20

knew every nook and corner of the entire country as far as Mek Nimmur's and=
 the Base, but that in=20

the latter country we must be prepared to fight, as they made a practice of=
 showing no quarter to=20

the Base, because they received none from them; thus we should require a st=
rong party. I pointed=20

to my rifles, which I explained were odds against the Base, who were withou=
t fire-arms; and we=20

arranged to start together on the 17th of December.  In the interval I was =
busily engaged in making=20

bullets for the journey, with an admixture of one pound of quicksilver to t=
welve of lead. This=20

hardens the bullet at the same time that it increases the weight, but great=
 caution must be=20

observed in the manufacture, as the mercury, being heavier than the lead, w=
ill sink to the bottom,=20

unless stirred with a red-hot iron when mixed. The admixture must take plac=
e in small quantities,=20

otherwise the quicksilver will evaporate if exposed to a great heat. Thus t=
he molten lead should be=20

kept upon the fire in a large reservoir, while a portion of quicksilver sho=
uld be added regularly to=20

every ladleful taken for immediate use. This should be well stirred before =
it is poured into the=20

mould. Bullets formed of this mixture of metals are far superior to any oth=
ers.  My preparations for=20

the journey were soon completed. We had passed a most agreeable time at Wat=
 el Negur.=20

Although I had not had much shooting, I gained much experienee in the count=
ry, having made=20

several extensive journeys in the neighbourhood, and our constant conversat=
ions with the sheik=20

had somewhat improved my Arabic. I had discovered several plants hitherto u=
nknown to me,--

among others, a peculiar bulb, from which I had prepared excellent arrowroo=
t. This produced=20

several tubers resembling sweet potatoes, but exceedingly long and thin; it=
 was known by the=20

Arabs as "baboon." I pierced with a nail a sheet of tin from the lining of =
a packing case, and I=20



quickly improvised a grater, upon which I reduced the bulb to pulp. This I =
washed in water, and=20

when strained through cotton cloth, it was allowed to settle for several ho=
urs. The clear water was=20

then poured off; and the thick sediment, when dried in the sun, became arro=
wroot of the best=20

quality. The Arabs had no idea of this preparation, but simply roasted the =
roots on the embers.  On=20

the 17th of August, 1861, accompanied by the German Florian, we started fro=
m Wat el Negur, and=20

said good-bye to our very kind friend, Sheik Achmet, who insisted upon pres=
enting us with a=20

strong but exceedingly light angarep (bedstead), suitable for camel travell=
ing, and an excellent=20

water-skin, that we should be constantly reminded of him, night and day.  F=
lorian was in a weak=20

condition, as he had suffered much from fever throughout the rainy season. =
He started under=20

disadvantageous circumstances, as he had purchased a horse that was a bad b=
argain. The Arabs,=20

who are sharp practitioners, had dealt hardly with him, as they had sold hi=
m a wretched brute that=20

could make no other use of its legs than to kick. Of course they had impose=
d upon poor Florian a=20

long history of how this horse in a giraffe hunt had been the first at the =
death, &c. &c., and II.=20

Mikszath, perhaps the most purely national, certainly, after Jokai, the mos=
t popular of all the=20

Magyar novelists, was born at Szklabonya, in the county of Nograd, on Janua=
ry 16th, 1849.=20

Educated at Rimaszombath and Pest, he adopted the legal profession, and set=
tled down as a=20

magistrate in his native county, where his family had for generations lived=
 the placid, patriarchal=20

life of small country squires. A shrewd observer, with a strong satirical b=
ent and an ardent love of=20

letters, the young advocate made his _debut_ as an author, at the age of tw=
enty-five, with a=20

volume of short stories, which failed, however, to catch the public taste. =
Shortly afterward he flitted=20

to Szeged, and contributed to the leading periodical there a series of sket=
ches, whose piquant=20

humor and perfection of style attracted so much notice as to encourage a bo=
okseller in the famous=20

city on the Theiss to publish, in 1881, another volume of tales, the epoch-=
making "Tot Atyafiak,"=20

which was followed, four months later, by a supplementary volume, entitled =
"A jo paloczok." Critics=20

of every school instantly hailed these two little volumes as the finished m=
asterpieces of a new and=20

entirely original _genre_, the like of which had hitherto been unknown in H=
ungary. The short story=20

had, indeed, been previously cultivated, with more or less of success, by e=
arlier Magyar writers;=20

but these first attempts had, for the most part, been imitations of foreign=
 novelists, mere exotics=20



which struck no deep root in the national literature. Mikszath was the firs=
t to study from the life the=20

peculiarities and characteristics of the peasantry among whom he dwelt, the=
 first to produce real,=20

vivid pictures of Magyar folk-life in a series of humoresks, dramas, idylls=
--call them what you will--

of unsurpassable grace and delicacy, seasoned with a pleasantly pungent hum=
or, but never=20

without a sub-flavor of that tender melancholy which lies at the heart of t=
he Hungarian peasantry.=20

And these exquisite miniatures were set in the frame of a lucid, pregnant, =
virile style, not unworthy=20

of Maupassant or Kjelland. Henceforth Mikszath was sure of an audience. In =
1883 he removed to=20

Pest, and in the following year a fresh series of sketches, "A tisztelt haz=
bol," appeared in the=20

columns of the leading Hungarian newspaper, the "Pesti Hirlap," which estab=
lished his reputation=20

once for all. During the last twelve years Mikszath has published at least =
a dozen volumes, and, so=20

far, his productivity shows no sign of exhaustion. The chief literary socie=
ties of his native land,=20

including the Hungarian Academy, have all opened their doors to him, and si=
nce 1882 he has=20

been twice, unanimously, elected a member of the Hungarian Parliament, in t=
he latter case, oddly=20

enough, representing a constituency vacated by his illustrious compeer and =
fellow-humorist,=20

Maurus Jokai. Fortunately for literature, he has shown no very remarkable a=
ptitude for politics.=20

When I add that in 1873 Mikszath married Miss Ilona Mauks, and has two chil=
dren living, who=20

have frequently figured in his tales, I have said all that need be said of =
the life-story of this=20

charming and interesting author.  As already implied, the _forte_ of Miksza=
th is the _conte_, and=20

as a _conteur_ he has few equals in modern literature. "A jo paloczok," in =
particular, has won a=20

world-wide celebrity, and been translated into nearly every European langua=
ge except English, the=20

greater part of the Swedish version being by the accomplished and versatile=
 pen of King Oscar.=20

But Mikszath has also essayed the romance with eminent success, and it is o=
ne of his best=20

romances that is now presented to the reader. "Szent Peter esernyoeje," to =
give it its Magyar title,=20

is a quaintly delightful narrative in a romantic environment of out-of-the-=
world Slovak villages, with=20

a ragged red Umbrella and a brand-new brass=20


_
the deceived, had promised to shoot a hippopotamus to give them in barter. =
This he had already=20

done, and he had exchanged a river horse, worth twenty dollars, for a terre=
strial horse, worth=20

twenty piastres.  Florian had never mounted a horse in his lifetime as his =
shooting had always=20

been on foot. This he now explained to us, although the confession was quit=
e unnecessary, as his=20

first attempt at mounting was made upon the wrong side.  Throughout his jou=
rney to Geera on the=20

Settite, there was a constant difference of opinion between him and his new=
 purchase, until we=20

suddenly heard a heavy fall. Upon looking back, I perceived Florian like a =
spread eagle on his=20

stomach upon the ground, lying before the horse, who was Umbrella, which is=
 worth a king's=20

ransom, is sold for a couple of florins to the "white Jew" of the district,=
 becomes the tutelary deity--

or shall I say the fetish?--of half a dozen parishes, and is only recovered=
, after the lapse of years,=20

by its lawful owner, when, by a singular irony of fate, it has become absol=
utely valueless--from a=20

pecuniary point of view. The Caldron, on the other hand, which is erroneous=
ly supposed to contain=20

countless treasures, and is the outcome of a grimly practical joke, proves =
a regular box of=20

Pandora, and originates a famous lawsuit which lasts ten years and ruins th=
ree families--who=20

deserve no better fate. How the Umbrella and the Caldron first come into th=
e story the reader must=20

be=20


_
new master. On another occasion, I heard a torrent of abuse expressed in Ge=
rman, and upon=20

turning round I found him clinging to the neck of his animal, having lost b=
oth stirrups, while his rifle=20

had fallen to the ground. He was now cursing his beast, whom he accused of =
wilful murder, for=20

having replied by a kick to a slight tap he had administered with a stick. =
I could not help suggesting=20

that he would find it awkward himself. Suffice it to say that grouped aroun=
d them are very many=20

pleasant and--by way of piquant contrast--a sprinkling of unpleasant person=
ages, whose=20

adventures and vicissitudes will, I am convinced, supply excellent entertai=
nment to all lovers of=20
