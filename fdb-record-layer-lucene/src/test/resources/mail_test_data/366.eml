the matter, the tradition has certainly the basis of respectable antiquity =
to rest on. Bishop J. Taylor=20

thus writes in his _Second Sermon upon St. Matthew_, xvi. 26. _ad finem_:--=
    "The Doctors of=20

the Jews report that when _Absalom hanged among   the oaks by the hair of t=

seemed to see under him Hell   gaping wide ready to receive him; and he _du=

arts of remedy were so=20

vain."      RT.    Warmington, Sept. 3, 1851.  _MS. Book of Sentences_ (Vol=
. iv., p. 188.).--The=20

name of the Durham monk referred to by W. S. W. is more probably "Swallwell=
" than "Wallwell,"=20

because the former is the name of a township or vill in Durham from the boy=

E. S.  _The Winchester Execution_ (Vol. iv., p. 191.).--The narrative relat=
ed from memory of M. W.=20

B. bears on its face strong indications of fiction: according to that state=
ment a sheepstealer was=20

"some years ago" condemned to death; a "warrant" for his execution was made=
 out, but mislaid,=20

by whom does not appear. After the lapse of years, during which the prisone=
r had been employed=20

in "executing commissions in distant places" for the gaoler, and in obtaini=
ng a high character for=20

his amiable and moral conduct, the fatal warrant arrives, and is "forwarded=
 to the high sheriff, and=20

to the delinquent himself," who is forthwith hanged.  Any one acquainted wi=

The prisoner is=20

legally in the custody of the sheriff when sentence is passed in court, and=
 he leaves the court in=20

that same custody. The judgment so pronounced is itself the warrant, though=
 a short=20

memorandum or note of it is officially made at the time; unless the judge r=
eprieves or suspends=20

the sentence, no sheriff waits for any further authority, and as for the un=
fortunate delinquent, no=20

judge, sheriff, or gaoler ever supposed that any copy of a warrant was to b=

prisoner himself! During the interval between sentence and execution, if th=

release from imprisonment by the authority of the executive, the prisoner i=

kept by the sheriff _in salva et arcta custodia_ in the county gaol. The id=
ea of an employment for=20

years in rambling about the country on the gaoler's errands, is a preposter=
ous figment, composed=20

by some novelist who was unacquainted with the needful machinery for giving=
 an air of=20

verisimilitude to his story. The legend seems to be a version of the fate o=
f Sir W. Raleigh adapted=20

to low life; as in his case the scene is laid at Winchester, but the machin=
ery and decorations are=20

not contrived with a due regard to probability.        "Quodcunque essendis=

wishes kept secret,=20

one must bear in mind the fact that other people may be annoyed while resti=

by fragmentary bits of conversation wafted to them. At the hotel table one =
must also bear this in=20
