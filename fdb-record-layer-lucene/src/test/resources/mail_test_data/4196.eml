dracaena marginata being dry----"  "And so they are," declared Ruth, strugg=
ling to her feet. "We must do something. A rousing fire against this rock w=
ill keep us warm. We can heat the rock and then draw the fire out and get b=
ehind it. It will be fine!"  "Oh, I can't move!" wailed Lluella.  "Luella d=
oesn't want to work," said Madge. "But you get up and do your share, Miss! =
If you freeze whom could he be so much interested as to play such a daring =
game?"  "Oh ay, sir, that's just the question," Bauby said composedly. From=
 time to time she put up her apron. The shock she had received was comprehe=
nsible, but not the consolation. To follow her in this was beyond her maste=
r's power.  "That is the question indeed," John said gravely. "I think you =
must be dracaena marginata being dry----"  "And so they are," declared Ruth=
, struggling to her feet. "We must do something. A rousing fire against thi=
s rock will keep us warm. We can heat the rock and then draw the fire out a=

Luella doesn't want to work," said Madge. "But you get up and do your share=
, Miss! If you freeze whom could he be so much interested as to play such a=
 daring game?"  "Oh ay, sir, that's just the question," Bauby said composed=
ly. From time to time she put up her apron. The shock she had received was =
comprehensible, but not the consolation. To follow her in this was beyond h=
er master's power.  "That is the question indeed," John said gravely. "I th=
ink you must be _
about each other's waists.  "What do you suppose will become of us, Ruthie?=
" Helen whispered.=20

"Why, how can we tell? Maybe the boys and Long Jerry are searching for us r=
ight now----"  "In this=20

dreadful storm? Impossible!" declared Helen.  "Well, that they _will_ searc=
h for us as soon as it=20

holds up, we can be sure," Ruth rejoined.  "But, in the meantime? They may =
be hours finding us.=20

And I am sure I would not know how to start for Snow Camp, if the storm sho=
uld stop."  "Quite=20

true, Helen."  "We won't an-n-ny of us start for Snow Camp again!" quavered=
 Lluella Fairfax. "We'll=20

be frozen dead--that's what'll happen to us."  "I _am_ dreadfully cold," sa=
id Madge. "How are you,=20

Heavy?"  "Stiff as a poker, thank you!" returned the irrepressible. "I have=
n't any feet at all now.=20

They've frozen and dropped off!"  "Don't talk so terribly!" wailed Belle. "=
We are freezing to death=20

here. I am sleepy. I've read that when folks get drowsy out in a storm like=
 this they are soon done=20

for. Now, isn't that a fact, Madge Steele?"  "Nonsense!" exclaimed the olde=
r girl; but Heavy broke=20

in with:  "It strikes me that now is the time to make use of Ruth's matches=
. Let's build a rousing=20

fire."  "How?" demanded Helen. "Where can we get fuel? It's all under the s=
now."  "There's plenty=20

of kindling right under _us_" declared Jennie Stone, vigorously. "And Ruth =
spoke about the under=20

branches of these joke, sir. Gentlemen will have their jokes."  "My joke!" =
cried John in horror; "do=20

you think it is anything to joke about? I cannot understand it any more tha=
n you can. But it is fact;--

it is himself that says so. He got hold of the bridle----"  "Na, Mr John; n=
a, na, sir. What is the good=20

of frightening a poor lone woman? The like of that could never happen. Na, =
na."  "But it is he=20

himself who has said it; no one else could have imagined it for a moment. I=
t is his own story----"=20

"And if it is," said Bauby--"mind ye, Mr John, I ken nothing about it; but =
I ken our Tammas,--if it is,=20

he's just said it to save--ithers: that's the way of it. I ken him and his =
ways----"  "To save--others?"=20

The suggestion bewildered John.  "Oh ay--it's just that," said Bauby again.=
 She dried her eyes=20

carefully with her apron, pressing a tear into each corner. "_Him_ pit fort=
h his hand upon a=20

gentleman, and a muckle man like Pat Torrance, and a muckle beast! Na, na, =
Mr John! But he=20

might think, maybe, that a person like him, no' of consequence--though he's=
 of awfu' consequence=20

to me," said Bauby, almost falling back into tears. She made an effort, how=
ever, and recovered=20

her smile. "It's just a thing I can very weel understand."  "I think you mu=
st be out of your mind,"=20

cried her master. "Such things are not done in our day. What! play with the=
 law, and take upon him=20

another man's burden?=20
