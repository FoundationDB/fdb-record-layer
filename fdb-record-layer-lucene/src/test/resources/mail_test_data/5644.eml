when the old boar turned and came charging back upstream. This time he made=
 no mistake. His=20

beady eyes were upon Stew.  As he lowered his ugly head preparing for a cha=
rge, Stew drew his=20

automatic, but Jack, swinging a knife that was a cross between a sheath kni=
fe and a machete,=20

struck the angry beast a cutting blow across his ugly snout.  With a loud s=
queal and an angry=20

grunt, the mad creature came on. Jack let him have it again, neatly carving=
 out a curled ivory tusk.=20

Before he could swing again the pig reared, gnashed its teeth, then tumbled=
 back into the stream,=20

to go rushing away.  "Boy! But that was close!" Stew exclaimed, when after =
a short wait they=20

resumed their journey upstream.  At the top of the brush canopy, to their s=
urprise they came upon=20

a tiny lake. All rimmed round with gray rocks, it was blue as the sky above=
, and in its clear water=20

many tropical fish were moving.  "Boy! Any rich man in America would give a=
 fortune to have this=20

in his back yard!" Jack exclaimed.  "Yeah, sure," Stew agreed. "But a fish =
is a fish and I'm having=20

some broiled for supper."  "Here's the line." Jack held it out to him. "Try=
 your luck. I'm going up=20

higher to find the spring."  A few yards farther up, the stream forked, and=
 at the head of the first=20

fork he sought and found a cool, bubbling spring. And beside that spring wa=
s the telltale mark of a=20

human foot.  "Must be a big village of natives," he told himself. "Sooner o=
r later, we'll have to cast=20

our lot with them, but I'm bound I'll have a look at them first."  Jack fil=
led his canteen and stood for=20

a time staring off at the sea. Once he imagined that he caught the scream o=
f that mysterious,=20

propellerless plane, but in the end he decided that it was a wild parrot's =
call.  At last his gaze was=20

fixed on one spot. Raising his binoculars he took a good look.  Something o=
ut there on the sea, all=20

right! he assured himself. Pretty far out. Looks like a raft or a partially=
 submerged plane. It's sure=20

to drift this way. Current and wind are both right. If it were only a plane=
 we could put in working=20

order.  When he returned to the small lake, he found Stew the proud possess=
or of a fine string of=20

fish.  "Grubs," he explained. "I got grubs out of a rotten log and used the=
m for bait."  "Come on,"=20

said Jack. "We have enough fish for this time. In this climate they won't k=
eep."  "Just one more,"=20

Stew begged as he cast in his line. He had the fish at once, so with a sigh=
 he gathered up his=20

catch, strung on a crotched stick. Then they were off.  "The thing that bur=
ns me up," said Jack, as=20

they made their way down the slope, "is that the old _Black Bee_ may at thi=
s very moment be=20

ganging up with a lot of other fighting ships for a whack at Mindanao."  "A=
nd if she is," Stew=20

groaned, "we'll miss the biggest show of the whole war."  "That's right," J=
ack agreed. "Biggest and=20

best."  "'Remember Pearl Harbor,'" Stew quoted. "How can we forget? We've j=
ust _got_ to get off=20

this island--even if we have to borrow that propellerless plane or walk rig=
ht in on the natives and=20

say, 'Here! Give us a lift in your canoes.'"  "We'll have to make haste slo=
wly," Jack replied=20

thoughtfully. "We probably couldn't fly that plane if those fellows gave it=
 to us as a present.=20

Imagine a plane that flies without a propeller!"  "I can't," said Stew.  "B=
ut you saw it, didn't you?"  "I=20

sure did, on the outside. Sometime I'll see the inside of it, too. You watc=
h my smoke!"  "I'll watch."=20

Jack laughed.  "But they may not come back."  "Something tells me they will=
. There's still enough=20

kerosene hidden away in that giant crevasse to take them round the world. L=
ooks like their base."=20

After that the boys tramped on in silence.  The fish, broiled over a fire o=
f coals, were delicious.=20

When they had devoured the whole string, Stew thought of dessert.  "How abo=
ut a banana?" he=20

suggested.  "They haven't had time to ripen yet," replied Jack. Stew sprang=
 to his feet, took one=20

look at the tree from which the bananas hung, then exclaimed in a whisper: =
 "Jeepers! Look who's=20

here!"  On top of the bunch, holding a banana, sat a small monkey with a dr=
ied-up manlike face.=20



"Wait!" Jack whispered. "I'll give him a surprise!" Creeping up very softly=
, he suddenly popped up=20

within five feet of the monkey.  Oddly enough, the monkey did not appear to=
 be the least bit=20

startled. Looking Jack in the eye, he stared at him solemnly for a space of=
 seconds, then with both=20

tiny hands gripping it, he held out the banana.  "Somebody's pet!" Stew exc=
laimed.  "He sure is!"=20

Jack agreed. "And look! There's a silver chain around his neck!"  "Here, mo=
nk!" Going closer, he=20

patted his shoulder, and said in a quiet voice:  "Jump, boy, jump!"  And th=
e monkey jumped. A=20

moment later the little monkey was nestled in Jack's arms.  "What do you kn=
ow about that!" Stew=20

exclaimed.  "And what do you know about this?" Jack echoed. "This chain on =
his neck is tagged.=20

Why, it's the identification disk of an Army nurse. What do you suppose tha=
t means?"  "Might=20

mean almost anything," said Stew. "Perhaps she came ashore here, shipwrecke=
d, or something,=20

and the natives ate her."  "That, in my estimation, is out," Jack said, str=
oking the monkey's head.=20

"How come?"  "If that were true, this monkey must have belonged to the nati=
ves. The theory would=20

be that they saved the tag and put it round the monkey's neck."  "What's wr=
ong with that?"  "Just=20

this. Monkeys are very particular about the company they keep. If this one =
belonged to the natives=20

he'd never make friends with a couple of plane-wrecked white men."  "All ri=
ght then, he belonged=20

to the nurse. The monkey escaped, but the nurse was eaten."  "I still think=
 you're wrong," Jack=20

insisted. "It will be dark in a short time," he added. "We'll just wander o=
ver for a look at the natives.=20

Then perhaps we'll know what to think."  "And perhaps we won't," Stew laugh=
ed softly. "Anyway,=20

it's worth trying."                                    CHAPTER X           =
                 "HIST THERE! YOU!"   Two=20

hours later, peering from a thicket of tall ferns and sprouting palms, the =
two boys were witnessing=20

one of the most fascinating moving pictures from real life that they had ev=
er chanced upon. About=20

a broad fire of coals was a group of thirty or forty natives. Some were sea=
ted on palm logs, and=20

some were standing. All were talking and laughing.  "Um-m-m! Lead me to it!=
" Stew whispered.=20

The object of his desire hung dripping over the glowing coals. A small pork=
er, bound to an iron rod=20

that slowly turned him over and over, had reached a shade of delicious, gol=
den brown.  "And=20

barbecued pork is the thing I am fondest of." Stew's whisper betrayed real =
agony.  "We'll barbecue=20

one some time," was Jack's only reply. He had been studying the group inten=
tly. They were a=20

motley throng. There were big, dark-skinned men in the group who could have=
 placed him across=20

a knee and broken his back. There were dark-eyed, laughing children that an=
yone could love.  The=20

men, for the most part, wore cotton trousers. Some of the women wore dresse=
s, some only cotton=20

skirts, and some were in native grass skirts.  "There's that tall, slim one=
 turning the roast," Jack=20

whispered.  "What tall, slim one?" Stew replied.  "Oh! I didn't tell you!" =
Jack laughed softly. "I've=20

seen her before."  "You would!" Stew mocked.  Over near one corner of the f=
ire two dusky=20

maidens were baking some sort of cakes and stacking them in appetizing pile=
s. The roasting of=20

the porker appeared to have been left to the tall, slim girl. She turned an=
d twisted it, prodded it with=20

a huge fork, then turned it again. At last, taking up a large knife, she cu=
t off a slice, held it up, and=20

blew on it to cool it.  At once from the throng rose an expectant murmur. S=
tew joined in.  "Keep=20

still, Stew!" Jack warned in a whisper.  Without really knowing why, Jack h=
ad brought the monkey=20

on his shoulder. Now the little fellow stirred uneasily.  The girl at last =
handed the slice of bronzed=20

pork to an old man with a long, wrinkled face.  Carving off a small portion=
, he put it in his mouth.=20

For a space of seconds his face was a study. Then it was lighted by a wide =
grin. He said a single=20

word. At that the crowd exploded with joyous anticipation.  "It's done. The=
 porker is roasted. And=20



we don't get even a bite," Stew groaned. "What a life!"  Then a strange thi=
ng happened. The crowd=20

lapsed into silence. Only the snapping of bursting coals could be heard as =
the natives bowed their=20

heads while the girl said a few words in a low tone.  "Grace before meat," =
Stew whispered. "What=20

more can you ask?"  "Plenty," was Jack's reply. "The Nazis and the Japs als=
o pray. Then they go=20

out to massacre women, children, and helpless prisoners of war. We'll wait =
and see."  As if this=20

scene awakened memories in his small brain, the monkey on Jack's shoulder s=
tirred, danced for a=20

second, then gave an immense leap that landed him almost in the center of t=
he throng.  "Now=20

we've got to beat it! They'll be looking for us! Let's scram!"  It was a di=
sconsolate Stew who=20

trudged along the native trail toward their camp. "Lot we gained by that!" =
he grumbled. "Just a look=20

at a grand feed! They were putting slices of pork between cakes when we lef=
t. Besides, we lost=20

our monkey!"  "We know more about the natives now," said Jack.  "Lot more. =
They say grace and=20

eat nurses!" Stew mocked.  "We couldn't prove that. Perhaps the nurse gave =
them her dog tag."=20

"Fine chance!" Stew lapsed into silence.  Jack was not thinking of the nati=
ves now, but of Ted,=20

Kentucky, and all the other fellows on the _Black Bee_. "If they attack Min=
danao before we get=20

back to the ship, I'll never recover," he thought.  "Hush!" Stew stopped to=
 listen.  Faint and far=20

away they caught a long-drawn wail like a bow drawn slowly over the C strin=
g of a violin.  "The=20

Howler is coming back to roost," said Stew.  "Sounds that way," Jack agreed=
.  "Boy! I'd like to=20

have one more look at that plane!" Stew said eagerly.  "We'll take a good l=
ook one of these times,"=20

Jack assured him. "We've seen enough for one day."  They stood there listen=
ing until the howl of=20

the rapidly approaching mystery plane had reached its height, then, as on t=
hat other night,=20

wavered and ceased.  "They're here all right," Stew said, as they paused on=
 a tall, barren rock to=20

look back. On the spot where the plane had been parked before, they caught =
the gleam of a=20

wavering light.  When they reached the beach, ready to start on the last qu=
arter mile of their walk,=20

they paused once more. The tide was coming in. Above the rushing sound of t=
he breakers on the=20

beach they had caught a _bump_--_bump_--_bump_. After ten seconds of listen=
ing, they heard a=20

loud crash.  "What's that?" Stew asked in surprise.  "Don't ask me. Let's g=
o see." Flashlight in=20

hand, Jack was clambering over the rocks.  "It's a life raft," he called ba=
ck a moment later. "Waves=20

threw it on the rocks. Come on! Let's grab it before a bigger wave carries =
it back."  It was a large=20

raft, wet and the surgeon the responsibility may not at least be shifted fr=
om the shoulders of the=20

accused. The law in this respect is explicit and regards such operation as =
the outcome of=20

necessity and a legitimate part of treatment, so that if it be undertaken i=
n good faith, with=20

reasonable care and skill, the accused will be held responsible, be the res=
ult what it may. The=20

question of necessity and the plan of operation are left to the judgment of=
 the surgeon in charge.=20

Considering the responsibility involved in such cases and the possibility o=
f a suit being raised, we=20

should always advise the operator to secure the counsel of other surgeons o=
r practitioners in his=20

vicinity. The verdict of such a counsel of talent will always stand. Accord=
ing to Lord Hale, when=20

death takes place from an unskilful operation under such circumstances, and=
 not from the wound,=20

the responsibility of the prisoner naturally ceases, but the burden of proo=
f that such has been=20

unskilfully performed rests naturally with the defence. It is much better a=
lso in these cases that the=20

primary responsibility be borne by one surgeon from the beginning of the ca=
se, though he may=20

associate with himself as many others as he chooses, since the ends of just=
ice have more than=20

once been defeated by a division of such responsibilities. Should it be mad=
e to appear that the=20



surgeon in charge has not availed himself of such means as are supposed to =
be in the hands of=20

every competent practitioner and has neglected ordinary antiseptic precauti=
ons, it would not be=20

difficult to show that the operation had been unskilfully performed, and th=
e prisoner would naturally=20

get the benefit of such defence. At the present date of writing there exist=
s a large class of the=20

profession who still continue to do surgery according to the views and prac=
tices of twenty or thirty=20

years ago, and who, while perhaps carrying out some of the forms of antisep=
tic surgery, are still=20

ignorant of its fundamental principles and consequently guilty of neglect, =
since there is now no=20

reason why all should not practise them. The writer holds to the view that =
if it can be shown that=20

these precautions were not adopted when others would have adopted them, it =
constitutes criminal=20

neglect.  On the other hand, circumstances may arise where a simple or a mo=
re serious operation=20

would have saved life, as, for instance, in cases of hemorrhage, and where =
a surgeon from timidity=20

or carelessness has failed to take the necessary steps. Such neglect as thi=
s should inure to the=20

benefit of the accused, but when at any time it can be shown that the possi=
ble benefits of=20

operation have been offered to the deceased before his death and have been =
declined, the=20

surgeon at least is relieved of all further responsibility. Among the dange=
rs of operations under=20

these circumstances are of course to be reckoned those pertaining to the us=
e of an=C3=A6sthetics. The=20

surgeon in charge, however, is responsible for the selection of his assista=
nts, at least when=20

assistants are at hand, and must be regarded as equally competent in this a=
s in other features of=20

the operation; and even though the patient die from collapse or the an=C3=
=A6sthetic, the burden of=20

proof must rest with the defence to show that it had been unskilfully admin=
istered.  NOTE.=E2=80=94The=20

assistance which the microscope may afford in the procurement of evidence i=
n cases of gunshot=20

wound is beautifully illustrated in the expert testimony reported by Dr. Ja=
mes, of St. Louis, in the=20

presidential address before the American Society of Microscopists, in Washi=
ngton, August, 1891,=20

printed in Vol. XIII. of its Transactions. It occurred in St. Louis, in the=
 case of The People _v._ Vail,=20

who had a pistol in his pocket at the instant when his wife fell from a wag=
on against him, knocking=20

him, as he claimed, against the wheel of the wagon, the pistol being discha=
rged by accident. By a=20

minute study of the fibres of the various textures making up his overcoat a=
nd of the effect of the=20

explosion of powder upon textile fabrics almost in contact with it, he was =
enabled to establish the=20

accident and secure the acquittal of the accused.       DEATH    BY HEAT AN=

he=20

production and regulation of heat in the body is a problem by no means eluc=
idated. We consider=20

heat production to be of internal origin, by a complex process involving ti=
ssue metamorphosis,=20

chemical changes in nutrient elements, muscular movements, etc. Heat regula=
tion is=20

accomplished, not only by variation in the loss of heat by the body, but by=
 what is more important,=20

variations in the amount of heat generated. It is an accepted physiological=
 conclusion that there=20

exists in the body a thermotaxic nervous mechanism which controls its norma=
l, as well as its=20

abnormal, manifestations of heat.  The average temperature of the body in h=
ealth is 37=C2=B0 C. (98.6=C2=B0=20



F.), in the axilla. Taken in the vagina or rectum, .9=C2=B0 C. (1.3=C2=B0 F=
.) higher is noted. The daily average=20

range of variation is about 1=C2=B0 C. (1.8=C2=B0 F.).  In disease or injur=
y considerable variations occur; very=20

high, as well as very low, temperatures are met. In severe neuroses and som=
e forms of malarial=20

disease a temperature of 42.2=C2=B0 C. (115=C2=B0 F.) has been recorded, an=
d after an injury 71=C2=B0 C. (122=C2=B0=20

F.).[688]  Very low temperatures are reported in several cases of acute alc=
oholism, accompanied=20

by exposure to cold, where a temperature of 28.8=C2=B0 C. (75=C2=B0 F.) in =
the rectum was noted, recovery=20

following.[689]  Such extreme temperatures, though authentic, are exception=
al.  Very high=20

temperatures in febrile conditions are borne because remitting; and low tem=
peratures, subject to=20

periods of elevation, are met in wasting and other conditions. Very high an=
d very low temperatures=20

are also noted, just before death, in acute diseases and conditions special=
ly involving the nervous=20

system.  The degree to which the temperature may be raised without destroyi=
ng life has been=20

investigated by Berger, Bernard, Chossat, and others.[690]  Their experimen=
ts show that if an=20

elevation of temperature of the body 7.20=C2=B0 C. (13=C2=B0 F.) be maintai=
ned for any length of time in=20

warm-blooded animals, death ensues. Depression of the temperature of warm-b=
looded animals=20

12=C2=B0 C. (20=C2=B0 F.), or even less than these degrees below the normal=
, results fatally. Portions of the=20

body may be frozen and yet, under appropriate treatment, recover. But freez=
ing of the whole body=20

must necessarily prove fatal.  Great differences in ability to endure extre=
mes of heat and cold=20

appear among different nations and in different individuals. The very young=
 and the very old are=20

unable to bear exposure to extreme cold. In both, the capacity for heat pro=
duction is low and the=20

vital powers are soon enfeebled to a critical degree. The healthy adult can=
, with proper=20

precautions, safely endure great extremes of heat and cold. The experience =
of arctic explorers in=20

the expeditions of Kane, Nares, Greely, and others has demonstrated the pow=
er of endurance, for=20

a considerable period, of a temperature from 90=C2=B0 to 100=C2=B0 F. below=
 the freezing-point. On the other=20

hand, laborers employed in pottery and other establishments, using ovens ra=
ised to 148=C2=B0 to 315=C2=B0=20

C. (300=C2=B0 to 600=C2=B0 F.) or higher, are often exposed for some time w=
ithout injury to temperatures=20

approaching these intense figures.   EFFECTS OF EXTREME COLD.  Legal inquir=
y into the=20

conditions of death from cold occurs almost entirely in cases of unintentio=
nal exposure. Cold has=20

been employed, however, with homicidal intent. The depressing influence of =
continued low=20

temperatures is observed in the death-rates of cities, in winters of protra=
cted severity, where the=20

proportionate mortality among infants, the aged and enfeebled shows marked =
increase. While age=20

is a prominent predisposing and contributing factor, other causes exist. Ex=
haustion from severe=20

and prolonged exertion, deprivation of food, intoxication, former illness, =
and other conditions of=20

depression lessen the powers of the body to resist cold. Thus an exposure w=
hich might be safely=20

borne in perfect health might result fatally in the same person in conditio=
ns of depression just=20

referred to (Case 1).  Investigation may be demanded in case of the death o=

ay be in the new-born or older=20

children.  In the _new-born_ exposure to cold soon causes death, as warmth =
is essential to the life=20

of the young being. The length of time necessary to a fatal issue is modifi=
ed by several conditions.=20

In the immature or prematurely born infant the resisting power is much less=
 than in the child born=20

at full term and otherwise healthy. In cases of suspected infanticide by ex=
posure the question of=20

the maturity of the child at birth is to be decided. Careful examination of=
 the place in which the=20

body was discovered should be made as to its lack of warmth; and the degree=
 of external cold at=20



the time of probable exposure should be recorded. The circumstances as to w=
hether the exposure=20

was inadvertent or accidental, as in cases of premature or unexpected deliv=
ery, or whether from=20

intentional and deliberate purpose or from culpable neglect, should be care=
fully considered. The=20

post-mortem examination should decide whether the appearances and condition=
s of the body are=20

those peculiar to death from cold (Case 2).  Death may occur from culpably =
careless exposure to=20

cold, as a contributory if not as a direct cause, in such conditions of enf=

they had the raft high and dry. They were soon to learn that it was worth t=
heir effort.  "It's a Jap=20

raft!" Stew exclaimed. He had discovered Japanese characters on a sealed me=
tal cannister.=20

"Must have come from a carrier," suggested Jack. "Too big for a cruiser or =
a destroyer."  "I'll bet it=20

came from that carrier we spotted!" Stew exploded, becoming greatly excited=
. "Boy! Oh boy! Our=20

bombers got them!"  Jack was not too sure of this. However, they soon estab=
lished the fact that=20

the raft was undamaged and had no broken lines attached to it, so it could =
not have been blown=20

from the carrier by a bomb. Then Jack was convinced that the Japs must have=
 lost the raft in=20

trying to launch it while under fire, and that the carrier must have been s=
unk.  "That's swell!" he=20

sighed. "Means we've been some use to our country. I hope Ted and all the r=
est got home safely."=20

"It's great news!" Stew agreed. "But that means our task force finished tha=
t job twenty-four hours=20

ago, so where are they now?"  "You tell me," Jack sighed.  "But say!" Stew =
exclaimed. "There are=20

three or four big sealed cans attached to the raft. Let's cut them loose an=
d take them in."  "Sure!=20

That's what we'll do!" Jack agreed. "Then we'll open them and see what kind=
 of luck we've had."=20

They carried away the three large cans, to open them later by the light of =
a small fire built among=20

huge rocks, where the glow would not show.  One can they found to be filled=
 with food--packages=20

of rice and tea, bars of bitter chocolate, and small tins of fish. They put=
 away these supplies=20

against some evil day.  The second can also contained some food. Besides th=
is there was a=20

quantity of first-aid material. Finding insane subject is usually indiffere=
nt to matters of temperature,=20

death from exposure to cold may call for special examination. Carelessness,=
 incompetence, or=20

wilful neglect on the part of nurses or keepers of insane hospitals, or del=
iberate criminal intent in=20

such or others having the care of or an interest in the death of an insane =
person may lead to a=20

judicial inquiry.  Sudden death has been reported as occurring, in several =
cases, _after the=20

ingestion of large quantities of cold water_ when the person was greatly he=
ated. It is somewhat=20

difficult to explain all such cases reported on a single line of causation.=
 Some observers have=20

attributed death to syncope or asthenia by the shock produced, in the sudde=
n effect of the cold=20

upon the sympathetic nervous system inducing heart failure. This seems the =
most natural=20

explanation.  Others consider the causative factor to be the formation of t=
hromboses in the=20

capillaries of the brain, lungs, and other organs, inducing active and obst=
ructive congestions=20

causing death by apn=C5=93a or coma. Others regard these cases as similar t=
o =E2=80=9Cheat apoplexy.=E2=80=9D=20

SYMPTOMS.  Under the influence of external cold, the vessels of the skin ar=
e contracted and the=20

internal splanchnic areas dilated. Thus the surface of the body contains le=
ss blood and the internal=20

organs a larger proportion. This vascular change is one of the important fa=
ctors in maintaining the=20

uniform temperature of the body. The thermometer, placed in the mouth, in s=
uch conditions=20

frequently indicates a rise of temperature. This is probably due, not only =
to the increased volume=20

of blood collected in the internal organs, but also to an increased product=
ion of heat through a=20

stowed it away carefully.  The last can promised to be the grand prize, pro=
vided they could figure it=20

out. It was a small radio sending set, powered by electricity generated by =
turning a crank.  "It's an=20

imitation of our American emergency radio," Jack declared after looking it =
over. "Take a lot of=20

doping out, but it's our best bet for getting in touch with our ship. We'll=
 get busy on it first thing in=20

the morning.  "And now," he added in a changed voice, "how would you like t=
o grab a few winks of=20

sleep while I guard camp and solve some of the problems of the universe?"  =
"Nothing would suit=20

me better." Stew yawned. "It's been a long day."  It was a gloomy little wo=
rld Jack watched over=20

that night. Dark clouds had come rolling in at sunset. They had thinned out=
 a little now, giving the=20

moon an occasional peek at him.  "Just enough to give some prowler a shot a=
t us in the night," he=20

grumbled to himself. He wished he knew who those men were with the propelle=
rless plane. How=20

was he to find out? Ask the natives? But were these natives to be trusted? =
Missionaries had=20

beyond a doubt been here, but they weren't here now. "How long does it take=
 these primitive=20

people to drop back into their old ways?" he asked himself. But he found no=
 answer.  "Things will=20

work themselves out," he reasoned hopefully.  After that he gave himself ov=
er to thoughts of the=20

folks at home. Dad and Mom seated by the fire--Patsy in the house next door=
, studying perhaps,=20

or entertaining one of the 4-H boys. How shadowy and far away it all seemed=
 now.  He was deep=20

in the midst of all this when suddenly, as the moon cast a patch of light o=
n his beach and the=20

cluster of palms not twenty yards away, he was startled by a voice at his v=
ery elbow.  "Hist there!=20

You!" it whispered.  Startled, but standing his ground, he gripped his auto=
matic, then in his=20

hoarsest whisper answered:  "Hist back to you!"                            =
        CHAPTER XI=20

NIGHT FIGHTERS   Jack's conclusions regarding the _Black Bee's_ fight with =
the Jap task force=20

were correct. After he and Stew had been driven from the scene of fighting =
and had abandoned=20

their plane on the sea, the U. S. dive bombers had come in for their deadly=
 work. Diving from=20

twelve thousand feet, they had released their bombs at a thousand feet. Som=
e bombs missed their=20

mark. Others made contact. One fell forward on the Jap carrier, killing a g=
un crew. Two fell almost=20

directly on the propeller, rendering it useless. While the carrier ran arou=
nd in wide circles, the=20

torpedo  In exposure for a time to severe cold the nose, ears, cheeks, hand=
s, feet, and other=20

portions of the body, after the first appearance of dusky lividity, become =
bloodless and white, lose=20

sensation, and become congealed; a condition known as =E2=80=9Cfrost-bite.=
=E2=80=9D From this, recovery without=20

injury is possible under appropriate treatment, by which the temperature is=
 gradually raised and=20

the circulation restored. Where the latter result is not secured, the part =
becomes gangrenous and=20

is ultimately removed by a process of inflammation and sloughing.  If the a=
pplication of cold be=20

protracted and the temperature extreme, the loss of heat becomes rapid and =
symptoms of=20

depression of the heart=E2=80=99s action appear. Painful sensations of the =
surface and other portions of the=20

body are experienced, succeeded by impaired sensation and an=C3=A6sthesia. =
The skin acquires a=20

dusky, reddish, and livid appearance, with the formation occasionally of ve=
sicles or blisters. With=20

the lessened sensation stiffness of the limbs appears, due to failing muscu=
lar contractility. The=20

congestion of the central portions of the nervous system induces a conditio=
n of advancing stupor,=20

resulting in complete coma with ultimate suspension of respiration and the =
heart=E2=80=99s action.  Death=20

from exposure to cold may be rapid or slow. In cases of recovery the period=
 of reaction is a critical=20

one. The depression of the heart is apt to continue, and gangrene of parts =
of the body is likely to=20

occur. Ulcers and sores healing with difficulty develop in some cases.   TR=

treatment of those who are suffering from the effects of extreme cold, the =
restoration of the=20

congealed or =E2=80=9Cfrost-bitten=E2=80=9D portions of the body should be =
gradually accomplished. Raising the=20

temperature rapidly is liable to induce the death and destruction of the af=
fected parts. Ice or snow=20

should, at first, be rubbed upon the frozen part, to be succeeded later by =
cold water. The patient=20

should be placed in a cool room and distant from the fire or source of heat=
. As soon as warmth=20

begins to return the part should be enveloped in wool, cotton, or some subs=
tance of poor=20

conducting powers. If the whole body be chilled, frictions of the surface w=
ith stimulating lotions are=20

of benefit, wrapping the person in woollen or fur coverings or garments aft=
erward.  Hot coffee or=20

alcoholic stimulants are of value as restoratives, but the latter are to be=
 avoided during an=20

 one side of the carrier=20

was blown away. Just as the Japs began abandoning ship, the carrier blew up=
.  A squadron of U.=20

S. dive bombers that had arrived too late to work on the carrier, went afte=
r the fleeing cruisers,=20

which did not pause to pick up their own men struggling in the water. Two c=
ruisers were sunk, and=20

one left in flames.  Ted had limped back to his own waters to make a crash =
landing in the sea=20

close to the _Black Bee_, and to be picked up by a PT boat. All in all it w=
as a glorious fight. One=20

U.S. fighter and his gunner were permanently lost. They had been seen to fa=

A service was read for these men by the chaplain.  The Commander lost no ti=
