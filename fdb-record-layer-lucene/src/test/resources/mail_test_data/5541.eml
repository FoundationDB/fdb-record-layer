philodendron monstera towards us, until it was at last so near as to be unpleasant: I looked behind me, and I saw by the expression of my men that they were thinking of retreat. I merely shook my fist, and frowned at them to give them confidence, and I waited finger, upon which she hastily drew it away and blushed furiously.  "It is very hot," she said, putting up her hand to her hot face, as though she had drawn it away for that purpose.  "Yes, the room has got quite hot," broke in Mrs. philodendron monstera towards us, until it was at last so near as to be unpleasant: I looked behind me, and I saw by the expression of my men that they were thinking of retreat. I merely shook my fist, and frowned at them to give them confidence, and I waited finger, upon which she hastily drew it away and blushed furiously.  "It is very hot," she said, putting up her hand to her hot face, as though she had drawn it away for that purpose.  "Yes, the room has got quite hot," broke in Mrs. _
Both fell for an instant; the tetel dead, shot through the neck; but my ostrich, that was a fine cock 

bird, immediately recovered, and went off with his wife as hard as their long legs could carry them. 

I was exceedingly disgusted; I had evidently fired too far behind, not having allowed sufficiently for 

the rapidity of their speed. However, to make amends, I snatched a spare single-rifle from Hassan, 

and knocked over another tetel that was the last of the herd. For about an hour I attempted to 

follow up the tracks of the ostrich, but among the rocky hills this was impossible. I therefore 

mounted Aggahr, and with my tracker, Taher Noor, and the Tokrooris as gun-bearers, I crossed 

the river and rode straight into the interior of the country. This was now thoroughly clear, as the fire 

had consumed the grass, and had left the surface perfectly black. Upon the ashes, the track of 

every animal could be seen distinctly.  I had ridden about four miles, followed, as usual, by two 

camels, with water, ropes, &c. when we observed in a perfectly open place, about three hundred 

yards from us, a rhinoceros standing alone. Fortunately, there was little or no wind, or, as we were 

to windward of him, he would instantly have perceived us. The moment that I saw him, I backed 

my horse and motioned to my people to retreat out of sight, which they did immediately. 

Dismounting, I gave them the horse, and, accompanied only by Taher Noor, who carried one of 

my spare rifles, I took a Reilly No. 10, and we made a circuit so as to obtain the wind, and to arrive 

upon the lee side of the rhinoceros. This was quickly accomplished, but upon arrival at the spot, 

he was gone. The black ashes of the recent fire showed his, foot-marks as clearly as though 

printed in ink, and as these were very close together, I knew that he had walked slowly off, and 

that he had not been disturbed, otherwise he would have started quickly. He had gone down wind; 

it would, therefore, be impossible to follow upon his tracks. Our only resource was to make 

another circuit, when, should his tracks not have crossed the arc, we should be sure that he was 

to windward. Accordingly, we described half a circle of about five hundred yards. No tracks had 

crossed our path; the ground was stony and full of hollows, in which grew a few scattered 

mimosas, while the surface of the earth was covered in many places with dark brown masses of 

basalt rock. We carefully stepped over this uneven ground, lest some falling stone might give the 

alarm, and we momentarily expected to be in view of the enemy as we arrived at the edge of each 

successive hollow. Sure enough, as I glanced down a sudden inclination covered with scorched 

mimosas, I perceived him standing on the slope beneath a tree within five-and-thirty paces; this 

was close enough, and I took a steady shot behind the shoulder. The instant that I fired, he 

whisked sharply round, and looked upon all sides for the cause of his wound. I had taken the 

precaution to kneel down immediately after firing, and I now crouched close to a rock about two 

feet high, with which my brown blouse matched exactly, as well as my skin-covered hunting-cap. 

For a few moments he sought upon all sides for an enemy, during which I remained like a block of 

stone, but with my finger on the trigger ready for the left-hand barrel should he charge. Taher Noor 

was lying on the ground behind a stone about five yards from me, and the rhinoceros, having 

failed to discover us, walked slowly past me within less than ten yards, and gained the summit of 

the inclination, where the ground was level. As he passed, I reloaded quickly, and followed behind 

him. I saw that he was grievously wounded, as he walked slowly, and upon arrival at a thickly-

spreading mimosa he lay down. We now advanced towards the tree, and I sent Taher Noor round 

to the other side in order to divert his attention should he be able to rise. This he quickly proved by 

springing up as I advanced; accordingly, I halted until Taher Noor had taken his stand about eighty 



paces beyond the tree. The rhinoceros now turned and faced him; this gave me the opportunity 

that I had expected, and I ran quickly to within thirty yards, just in time to obtain a good shoulder 

shot, as hearing my footsteps he turned towards me. Whiff! whiff! and he charged vigorously upon 

the shot; but just as I prepared to fire the remaining barrel, he ran round and round in a narrow 

circle, uttering a short, shrill cry, and fell heavily upon his side. I threw a stone at him, but he was 

already dead. Taher Noor returned for the people, who shortly arrived with the camels. I found that 

the last bullet of quicksilver and lead from my Reilly No. 10 had passed completely through the 

body, just behind the shoulder. The first shot was also a mortal wound, having broken one rib 

upon either side, and passed through the posterior portion of the lungs; the bullet was sticking 

under the skin on the opposite flank. The hide of the rhinoceros is exceedingly easy to detach from 

the body, as the quality is so hard and stiff that it separates from the flesh like the peel of a ripe 

orange.  In a couple of hours, the hide had been detached in sections for shields, and sufficient 

flesh was loaded upon the camel, together with the vicious-looking head, which was secured by 

ropes upon the saddle. We were en route for the camp, when we suddenly came upon fresh 

elephant tracks, upon following which, we discovered, after about an hour's march, the spoor of 

horses on the same path. At once the truth flashed upon me that, although Abou Do had promised 

to return direct home, he was somewhere in the neighbourhood, and he and his two companions 

were disturbing the country by hunting. I at once gave up the idea of following the elephants, as, in 

all probability, these aggageers had pursued them some hours ago. In a very bad humour I turned 

my horse's head and took the direction for the Settite river. As we descended from the hilly 

ground, after the ride of about four miles, we arrived upon an extensive plain, upon which I noticed 

a number of antelopes galloping as though disturbed; a few moments later I observed three 

horsemen, a camel, and several men on foot, steering in the same direction as ourselves for the 

river, but arriving from the high ground upon which we had seen the elephants. These were soon 

distinguished, and I rode towards them with my people; they were the aggageers, with some of the 

hippopotami hunters.  Upon our arrival among them, they looked exceedingly sheepish, as they 

were caught in the act. Suspended most carefully upon one side of the camel, in a network of 

ropes, was a fine young rhinoceros which they had caught, having hunted the mother until she 

forsook the calf. Johann Schmidt had offered forty dollars for any young animal of this species, for 

the Italian menageries, therefore to the aggageers this was a prize of great value. I had hardly 

directed my attention to the calf, when I noticed a rope that was forcibly placed under the throat to 

support the heavy head, the weight of which bearing upon the cord was evidently producing 

strangulation. The tongue of the animal was protruding, and the tail stiffened and curled 

convulsively above the back, while a twitching of the hind legs, that presently stretched to their full 

extent, persuaded me that the rhinoceros was in his last gasp. As I looked intently at the animal, 

while my Tokrooris abused Abou Do for having deceived us, I told the aggageers that they had not 

gained much by their hunt, as the rhinoceros was dead. For a moment Abou Do smiled grimly, 

and, quite unconscious of the real fact, Suleiman replied, "It is worth forty dollars to us." "Forty 

dollars for a dead rhinoceros calf!" I exclaimed; "who is fool enough to give it?"  Abou Do glanced 

at the rhinoceros; his expression changed; he jumped from his horse, and, assisted by the other 

aggageers, he made the camel kneel as quickly as possible, and they hastened to unstrap the 

unfortunate little beast, which, upon being released and laid upon its side, convulsively stretched 



out its limbs, and lay a strangled rhinoceros. The aggageers gazed with dismay at their departed 

prize, and, with superstitious fear, they remounted their horses without uttering a word, and rode 

away; they attributed the sudden death of the animal to the effect of my "evil eye." We turned 

towards our camp. My Tokrooris were delighted, and I heard them talking and laughing together 

upon the subject, and remarking upon the extremely "bad eye" of their master.  On the rising of the 

sun next day we had struck our camp, and were upon the march to Delladilla. On the way I shot a 

splendid buck mehedehet (R. Ellipsyprimna), and we arrived at our old quarters, finding no change 

except that elephants had visited them in our absence, and our cleanly swept circus was covered 

with the dung of a large herd. As this spot generally abounded with game, I took a single-barrelled 

small rifle, while the men were engaged in pitching the tent and arranging the camp, and with 

Taher Noor as my only companion, I strolled through the forest, expecting to obtain a shot at a 

nellut within a quarter of a mile. I had walked about that distance, and had just entered upon a 

small green glade, when I perceived, lying at full length upon the sand, a large lion, who almost 

immediately sprang up, and at the same moment received a bullet from my rifle as he bounded 

beneath a bush and crouched among some withered grass. I was unloaded, when, to my 

astonishment, Taher Noor immediately drew his sword, and, with his shield in his left hand, he 

advanced boldly towards the wounded lion. I reloaded as quickly as possible, just as this reckless 

Hamran had arrived within springing distance of the lion, who positively slunk away and declined 

the fight; retreating into the thick thorns, it disappeared before I could obtain a shot. Taher Noor 

explained, that his object in advancing towards the lion was to attract its attention; he had 

expected that it would have remained in a crouching position until I should have reloaded; but he 

ran the extreme risk of a charge, in which case he would have fared badly with simple sword and 

shield. Being close to the tent, I returned, and, in addition to my single-barrelled rifle, I took my two 

Reillys No. 10, with Hassan and Hadji Ali. In company with Taher Noor we searched throughout 

the bushes for the wounded lion, but without success. I now determined to make a cast, hoping 

that we might succeed in starting some other animal that would give us a better chance. The 

ground was sandy but firm, therefore we him.  After putting a few questions to the bystanders, he 

found Moricz Muencz, a short, stout man, his pock-marked face looking like a turkey's egg. He 

was as ugly as a Faun. His butcher's knife and steel hung from a belt round his waist, and on his 

arm was tattooed the head of an ox.  He was just bargaining for a cow, and its owner, a tanner, 

was swearing by heaven and earth that such a cow had never been seen in Babaszek before.  "It 

will eat straw," he assured him, "and yet give fourteen pints of milk a day!"  "Rubbish!" answered 

Moricz. "I'm not a calf, and don't intend to look upon this cow as my mother. I'm a butcher, and 

want to kill it and weigh it."  "That's true," said the honest tanner; and of his own free will he 

lowered the price by five florins.  Moricz did not seem to think that enough, and began poking at 

the ribs of the cow.  "What bones!" he exclaimed, and then pulled open its mouth to look at its 

teeth. "Why, it has not got a tooth in its head!"  "What do you want it to have teeth for?" asked the 

honest tanner. "I don't suppose you want to weigh its teeth too?"  "But it kicks!"  "Well, it won't kick 

once it is killed; and I don't suppose you want to weigh it before it is killed?"  The honest tanner 

laughed at his own wit, which had put him into such a good humor, that he again took five florins 

off the price. But Moricz was not yet satisfied, for he still gazed at the cow, as though trying to find 

more faults in her. And just at that moment Gyuri Wibra called out:  "Mr. Muencz, I should like to 



have a word with you."  The tanner, fearing to lose his purchaser, took five florins more off the 

price, and Moricz, being a sensible man, at once struck the bargain; he always bought of an 

evening from such as had not been able to sell their cattle during the day, and gave it for a low 

price to save their having to drive it home again.  "What can I do for you, sir?"  "I should like to buy 

something of you, which belongs neither to you nor to me."  "There are plenty of things in the 

world answering to that description," said Moricz, "and I can assure you, I will let you have it as 

cheap as possible."  "Let us move on a bit."  Gyuri led him out of the crowd to the village pump, 

near which grew an elder-tree. This tree, round which they had put some palings, was also a part 

of the future greatness of Babaszek, for the green, evil-smelling insects which housed in its 

branches, and which are used in various medicines (Spanish flies), induced them to believe that 

they might, once upon a time, have a chemist in Babaszek. The young girls of the town used to 

collect the insects, and sell them to the chemist at Zolyom for a few kreutzers; but that was 

forbidden now, for the people had decided: "Near that tree there will once be a chemist's shop, so 

we will not have the insects taken away."  They evidently considered them the foundation of the 

future chemist's store.  Gyuri told the Jew what he wanted; that he was interested in his father's 

favorite umbrella, and would buy it if he could find it. Did Moricz know anything about it?  "Yes, I 

do," was the disappointed answer, for now he knew what a trifle it was, he saw the price fall in 

proportion.  "I will give you fifty florins for any information that will lead to its discovery."  Moricz 

quickly took off his cap, which until now he had not considered it necessary to remove. Fifty florins 

for an old umbrella! Why, this young man must be the Prince of Coburg himself from Szent-Antal! 

Now he noticed for the first time how very elegantly he was dressed.  "The umbrella can be 

found," he said; and then added more doubtfully, "I think."  "Tell me all you know."  "Let me see, 

where shall I begin? It is now about fourteen years since my father disappeared, and I have 

forgotten most of the details, but this much I remember, that I started to look for him with my 

brother Sami, and in Podhragy I found the first trace of him, and following this up, I was told that 

when there he was still quite in his right mind, had sold a few trifles to the villagers, slept at the inn, 

and had bought a very old seal from a certain Raksanyi for two florins. He must have had all his 

senses about him then, for when we took him out of the Garam, he had the seal in his coat pocket, 

and we sold it for fifty florins to an antiquary, as it turned out to be the seal of Vid Mohorai, of the 

time of King Arpad."  "Yes, but these particulars have nothing to do with the subject in question," 

interrupted the young man.  "You will see, sir, that they will be useful to you."  "Well, perhaps so; 

but I don't see what they have to do with the umbrella."  "You will see in time, if you will listen to 

the rest of my tale. I heard in Podhragy that he went from there to Abelova, so I went there too. 

From what I heard, I began to fear that my father was beginning to lose his senses, for he had 

always inclined toward melancholy. Here they told us that he had bought a lot of 'Angel Kreutzers' 

(small coins, on which the crown of Hungary is represented, held by two angels; they were issued 

in 1867, and many people wear them as amulets, and believe they bring luck) from the villagers 

for four kreutzers each; but later on I found I was mistaken in my surmise."  "How was that? Was 

he not yet mad?"  "No, for a few days later, two young Jews appeared in Abelova, each bringing a 

bag of 'angel kreutzers,' which they sold to the villagers for three kreutzers each, though they are 

really worth four."  "So it is possible ..."  "Not only possible, but certain, that the two young cheats 

had been told by the old man to buy up all the 'angel kreutzers' they could, and he thus became 



their confederate without knowing it. So it is very probable he may have been mad then, or he 

would have had nothing to do with the whole affair. From Abelova he went through the Viszoka 

Hor forest to Dolinka, but we could find out nothing about his doings, though he spent two days 

there. But in the next village, Sztrecsnyo, the children ran after him, and made fun of him, like of 

the prophet Elijah, and he, unfastening his pack (not the prophet Elijah, but my poor father), began 

throwing the various articles he had for sale at them. In fifty years' time they will still remember that 

day in Sztrecsnyo, when soap, penknives, and pencils fell among them like manna from heaven. 

Since then it is a very common saying there: 'There was once a mad Jew in Sztrecsnyo.'"  "Bother 

Sztrecsnyo, let us return to our subject."  "I have nearly done now. In Kobolnyik my poor old father 

was seen without his pack; in one hand he had his stick, in the other his umbrella, with which he 

drove off the dogs which barked at him. So in Kobolnyik he still had his umbrella you see."  Tears 

were rolling down Moricz's pock-marked face, his heart was quite softened at the remembrance of 

all these incidents.  "After that we looked for a long time for traces of him, but only heard of him 

again in Lehota. One stormy summer night he knocked at the door of the watchman's house, the 

last in the village, but when they saw he was a Jew, they drove him away. They told me he had 

neither a hat nor an umbrella then, only the heavy, rough stick he used to beat us with when we 

were children."  "Now I begin to understand the drift of your remarks. You want to show that the 

umbrella was lost between Kobolnyik and Lehota."  "Yes."  "But that proves nothing, for your father 

may have lost it in the wood, or among the rocks, and if any one found it, they would probably 

make use of it to put in the arms of a scarecrow."  "No, that is not it, I know what happened. I 

heard it by chance, for I was not looking for the umbrella; what did I care for that! I wanted to find 

my father. Well, among the Kvet mountains I met a tinker walking beside his cart, a very chatty 

man he seemed to be. I asked him, as I did every one we met, if he had not seen an old Jew 

about there lately. 'Yes,' he answered, 'I saw him a few weeks ago in Glogova during a downpour 

of rain; he was spreading an umbrella over a child on the veranda of a small house, and when he 

had done so he moved on.'"  The lawyer sprang up hastily.  "Go on," he cried.  "There is nothing 

more to tell, sir. But from the description the tinker gave me, I am sure it was my father, and, 

besides, Glogova lies just between Lehota and Kobolnyik."  "Well, you have given me valuable 

information," exclaimed the lawyer, and, taking a fifty-florin note out of his pocketbook, he added: 

"Accept this as a slight return for your kindness. Good-by."  And off he went like a hound which 

has just found the scent; over some palings he vaulted, in order to get to his cart as quickly as 

possible. On he raced, but as he passed the gingerbread stall, Moricz Muencz stood before him 

again.  "Excuse me for running after you," he exclaimed breathlessly, "but it suddenly occurred to 

me that I might give you a word of advice, which is this. There are a good many people from 

Glogova here at the fair, so you really might get the crier to go round and find out if they know 

anything of the umbrella. If you would promise a reward for any information, in an hour's time you 

will have plenty, I am sure. In a small village like Glogova, every one knows everything."  "It is 

quite unnecessary," replied the lawyer, "for I am going to Glogova myself. Thanks all the same." 

"Oh, sir, it is I who have to thank you; you have behaved in a princely fashion. Fifty florins for such 

a trifle! Why, I would have done it for one florin."  The lawyer smiled.  "And I would willingly have 

given a thousand, Mr. Muencz."  And with that he walked away, past the stall where they were 

selling nuts, and onions tied up in strings. Moricz stood gazing after him till he was out of sight.  "A 



thousand florins!" he repeated, shaking his head. "If I had only known!"  And off he went, driving 

his cow before him.     CHAPTER IV.  THE EARRING.   From the inn opposite Schramek's house 

lively sounds proceeded. I beg pardon, I ought to call it "hotel," at least, that is the name the 

inhabitants of Babaszek delighted in giving it, and the more aristocratic of them always patronized 

it in preference to the other inns. The gypsies from Pelsoec were there, and the sound of their 

lively music could be heard far and wide through the open windows. Handsome Slovak brides in 

their picturesque dresses, with their pretty white headgear, and younger girls with red ribbons 

plaited into their hair, all run in to join the dance, and if the room is too full, late-comers take up 

their position in the street and dance there.  But curiosity is even stronger than their love of 

dancing, 


_
bounded upon two sides by the river, and separated from the main land by a ravine, the fire that 

had cleared the country of grass had spared this portion, which was an asylum for all kinds of 

game, as it afforded pasturage and cover. We had not continued our stroll for five minutes beyond 

the spot lately occupied by the lion, when we suddenly came upon two bull buffaloes, who were 

lying beneath a thick bush on the edge of a small glade: they sprang up as we arrived, and started 

off. I made a quick shot as they galloped across the narrow space, and dropped one apparently 

dead with a Reilly No. 10. My Tokrooris were just preparing to run in and cut the throat, as good 

Mussulmans, when the buffalo, that was not twenty yards distant, suddenly sprang to his feet and 

faced us. In another moment, with a short grunt, he determined upon a charge, but hardly was he 

in his first bound, when I fired the remaining barrel aimed at the point of the nose, as this was 

elevated to such a degree that it would have been useless to have fired at the forehead. He fell 

stone dead at the shot; we threw some clods of earth at him, but this time there was no mistake. 

Upon an examination of the body, we could only find the marks of the first bullet that had passed 

through the neck; there was no other hole in the skin, neither was there a sign upon the head or 

horns that he had been shot; at length I noticed blood issuing from the nose, and we found that the 

bullet had entered the nostril; I inserted a ramrod as a probe, and we cut to the extremity and 

found the bullet imbedded in the spine, which was shattered to pieces in a portion of the neck. As 

a souvenir of this very curious shot, I preserved the skull. My men now flayed the buffalo and took 

a portion of the meat, but I ordered them to leave the carcase as a bait for lions, with which this 

neighbourhood abounded, although it was exceedingly difficult to see them, as they were 

concealed in the dense covert of nabbuk bush. I left the buffalo, and strolled through the jungle 

towards the river. As I was leisurely walking through alternate narrow glades and thick jungle, I 

heard a noise that sounded like the deep snort of the hippopotamus. I approached the steep bank 

of the river, and crept carefully to the edge, expecting to see the hippo as I peered over the brink. 

Instead of the hippopotamus, a fine lion and lioness were lying on the sand about sixty yards to my 

left, at the foot of the bank. At the same instant they obtained our wind, and sprang up the high 

bank into the thick jungle, without giving me a better chance than a quick shot through a bush as 

they were disappearing.  I now returned home, determined to circumvent the lions if possible in 

this very difficult country. That night we were serenaded by the roaring of these animals in all 

directions, one of them having visited our camp, around which we discovered his footprints on the 

following morning. I accordingly took Taher Noor, with Hadji Ali and Hassan, two of my trusty 

Tokrooris, and went straight to the spot where I had left the carcase of the buffalo. As I had 

expected, nothing remained--not even a bone: the ground was much trampled, and tracks of lions 

were upon the sand; but the body of the buffalo had been dragged into the thorny jungle. I was 

determined, if possible, to get a shot, therefore I followed carefully the track left by the carcase, 

which had formed a path in the withered grass. Unfortunately the lions had dragged the buffalo 

down wind; therefore, after I had arrived within the thick nabbuk and high grass, I came to the 

conclusion that my only chance would be to make a long circuit, and to creep up wind through the 

thorns, until I should be advised by my nose of the position of the carcase, which would by this 

time lie in a state of putrefaction, and the lions would most probably be with the body. Accordingly, 

I struck off to my left, and continuing straight forward for some hundred yards, I again struck into 

the thick jungle, and came round to the wind. Success depended on extreme caution, therefore I 



advised my three men to keep close behind me with the spare rifles, as I carried my single-

barrelled Beattie. This rifle was extremely accurate, therefore I had chosen it for this close work, 

when I expected to get a shot at the eye or forehead of a lion crouching in the bush. Softly and 

with difficulty I crept forward, followed closely by my men; through the high withered grass, 

beneath the dense green nabbuk bushes; peering through the thick covert, with the nerves turned 

up to full pitch, and the finger on the trigger ready for any emergency. We had thus advanced for 

about half an hour, during which I frequently applied my nose to within a foot of the ground to 

catch the scent, when a sudden puff of wind brought the unmistakeable smell of decomposing 

flesh. For the moment I halted, and, looking round to my men, I made a sign that we were near to 

the carcase, and that they were to be ready with the rifles. Again I crept gently forward, bending, 

and sometimes crawling, beneath the thorns to avoid the slightest noise. As I approached, the 

scent became stronger, until I at length felt that I must be close to the cause. This was highly 

exciting. Fully prepared for a quick shot, I stealthily crept on. A tremendous roar in the dense 

thorns within a few feet of me suddenly brought my rifle to the shoulder: almost in the same instant 

I observed the three-quarter figure of either a lion or a lioness within three yards of me, on the 

other side of the bush, under which I had been creeping--the foliage concealed the head, but I 

could almost have touched the shoulder with my rifle. Much depended upon the bullet; and I fired 

exactly through the shoulder. Another tremendous roar! and a crash in the bushes as the animal 

made a bound forward, was succeeded immediately by a similar roar, as another lion took the 

exact position of the last, and stood wondering at the report of the rifle, and seeking for the cause 

of the intrusion. This was a grand lion with a shaggy mane; but I was unloaded, keeping my eyes 

fixed on the beast, while I stretched my hand back for a spare rifle; the lion remained standing, but 

gazing up wind with his head raised, snuffing in the air for a scent of the enemy. No rifle was put in 

my hand. I looked back for an instant, and saw my Tokrooris faltering about five yards behind me. 

I looked daggers at them, gnashing my teeth and shaking my fist. They saw the lion, and Taher 

Noor snatching a rifle from Hadji Ali, was just about to bring it, when Hassan, ashamed, ran 

forward--the lion disappeared at the same moment! Never was such a fine chance lost through the 

indecision of the gun-bearers! I made a vow never to carry a single-barrelled rifle again when 

hunting large game. If I had had my dear little Fletcher 24, I should have nailed the lion to a 

certainty.  However, there was not much time for reflection--where was the first lion? Some 

remains of the buffalo lay upon my right, and I expected to find the lion most probably crouching in 

the thorns somewhere near us. Having reloaded, I took one of my Reilly No. 10 rifles and listened 

attentively for a sound. Presently I heard within a few yards a low growl. Taher Noor drew his 

sword, and, with his shield before him, he searched for the lion, while I crept forward towards the 

sound, which was again repeated. A low roar, accompanied by a rush in the jungle, showed us a 

glimpse of the lion, as he bounded off within ten or twelve yards: but I had no chance to fire. Again 

the low growl was repeated, and upon quietly creeping towards the spot, I saw a splendid animal 

crouched upon the ground among the withered and broken grass. The lioness lay dying with the 

bullet wound in the shoulder. Occasionally, in her rage, she bit her own paw violently, and then 

struck and clawed the ground. A pool of blood lay by her side. She was about ten yards from us, 

and I instructed my men to throw a clod of earth at her (there were no stones), to prove whether 

she could rise, while I stood ready with the rifle. She merely replied with a dull roar, and I 



terminated her misery by a ball through the head. She was a beautiful animal; the patch of the 

bullet was sticking in the wound; she was shot through both shoulders, and as we were not far 

from the tent, I determined to have her brought to camp upon a camel as an offering to my wife. 

Accordingly I left my Tokrooris, while I went with Taher Noor to fetch a camel.  On our road 

through the thick jungle, I was startled by a rush close to me: for the moment I thought it was a 

lion, but almost at the same instant I saw a fine nellut dashing away before me, and I killed it 

immediately with a bullet through the back of the neck. This was great luck, and we now required 

two camels, as in two shots I had killed a lioness and a nellut (A. Strepsiceros).  We remained for 

some time at our delightful camp at Delladilla. Every day, from sunrise to sunset, I was either on 

foot or in the saddle, without rest, except upon Sundays, which I generally passed at home, with 

the relaxation of fishing in the beautiful river Settite. There was an immense quantity of large 

game, and I had made a mixed bag of elephants, hippopotami, buffaloes, rhinoceros, giraffes, and 

great numbers of the large antelopes. Lions, although numerous, were exceedingly difficult to bag; 

there was no chance but the extreme risk of creeping through the thickest jungle. Upon two or 

three occasions I had shot them by crawling into their very dens, where they had dragged their 

prey; and I must acknowledge that they were much more frightened of me than I was of them. I 

had generally obtained a most difficult and unsatisfactory shot at close quarters; sometimes I 

rolled them over with a mortal wound, and they disappeared to die in impenetrable jungle; but at 

all times fortune was on my side. On moonlight nights I generally lay in wait for these animals with 

great patience; sometimes I shot hippopotami, and used a hind-quarter as a bait for lions, while I 

watched in ambush at about twenty yards distance; but the hyaenas generally appeared like evil 

spirits, and dragged away the bait before the lions had a chance. I never fired at these 

scavengers, as they are most useful creatures, and are contemptible as game. My Arabs had 

made their fortune, as I had given them all the meat of the various animals, which they dried and 

transported to Geera, together with fat, hides, &c. It would be wearying to enumerate the happy 

hunting-days passed throughout this country. We were never ill for a moment; although the 

thermometer was seldom below 88 degrees during the day, the country was healthy, as it was 

intensely dry, and therefore free from malaria: at night the thermometer averaged 70 degrees, 

which was a delightful temperature for those who exist in the open air.  As our camp was full of 

meat, either dried or in the process of drying in festoons upon the trees, we had been a great 

attraction to the beasts of prey, who constantly prowled around our thorn fence during the night. 

One night in particular a lion attempted to enter, but had been repulsed by the Tokrooris, who 

pelted him with firebrands; my people woke me up and begged me to shoot him, but, as it was 

perfectly impossible to fire correctly through the hedge of thorns, I refused to be disturbed, but I 

promised to hunt for him on the following day. Throughout the entire night the lion prowled around 

the camp, growling and uttering his peculiar guttural sigh. Not one of my people slept, as they 

declared he would bound into the camp and take somebody, unless they kept up the watch-fires 

and drove him away with brands. The next day, before sunrise, I called Hassan and Hadji Ali, 

whom I lectured severely upon their cowardice on a former occasion, and I received their promise 

to follow me to death. I entrusted them with my two Reillys No. 10; and with my little Fletcher in 

hand, I determined to spend the whole day in searching every thicket of the forest for lions, as I felt 

convinced that the animal that had disturbed us during the night was concealed somewhere within 



the neighbouring jungle.  The whole day passed fruitlessly; I had crept through the thickest thorns 

in vain; having abundance of meat, I had refused the most tempting shots at buffaloes and large 

antelopes, as I had devoted myself exclusively to lions. I was much disappointed, as the evening 

had arrived without a shot having been fired, and as the sun had nearly set, I wandered slowly 

towards home. Passing through alternate open glades of a few yards width, hemmed in on all 

sides by thick jungle, I was carelessly carrying my rifle upon my shoulder, as I pushed my way 

through the opposing thorns, when a sudden roar, just before me, at once brought the rifle upon 

full cock, and I saw a magnificent lion standing in the middle of the glade, about ten yards from 

me: he had been lying on the ground, and had started to his feet upon hearing me approach 

through the jungle. For an instant he stood in an attitude of attention, as we were hardly visible; 

but at the same moment I took a quick but sure shot with the little Fletcher. He gave a convulsive 

bound, but rolled over backwards: before he could recover himself, I fired the left-hand barrel. It 

was a glorious sight. I had advanced a few steps into the glade, and Hassan had quickly handed 

me a spare rifle, while Taher Noor stood by me sword in hand. The lion in the greatest fury, with 

his shaggy mane bristled in the air, roared with death-like growls, as open-mouthed he 

endeavoured to charge upon us; but he dragged his hind-quarters upon the ground, and I saw 

immediately that the little Fletcher had broken his spine. In his tremendous exertions to attack, he 

rolled over and over, gnashing his horrible jaws, and tearing holes in the sandy ground at each 

blow of his tremendous paws, that would have crushed a man's skull like an egg-shell. Seeing that 

he was hors de combat, I took it coolly, as it was already dusk, and the lion having rolled into a 

dark and thick bush, I thought it would be advisable to defer the final attack, as he would be dead 

before morning. We were not ten minutes' walk from the camp, at which we quickly arrived, and 

my men greatly rejoiced at the discomfiture of their enemy, as they were convinced that he was 

the same lion that had attempted to enter the zareeba.  On the following morning, before sunrise, I 

started with nearly all my people and a powerful camel, with the intention of bringing the lion home 

entire. I rode my horse Tetel, who had frequently shown great courage, and I wished to prove 

whether he would advance to the body of a lion.  Upon arrival near the spot which we supposed to 

have been the scene of the encounter, we were rather puzzled, as there was nothing to distinguish 

the locality; one place exactly resembled another, as the country was flat and sandy, interspersed 

with thick jungle of green nabbuk; we accordingly spread out to beat for the lion. Presently Hadji 

Ali cried out: "There he lies dead!" and I immediately rode to the spot, together with the people. A 

tremendous roar greeted us, as the lion started to his fore-feet, and with his beautiful mane erect, 

and his great hazel eyes flashing fire, he gave a succession of deep short roars, and challenged 

us to fight. This was a grand picture; he looked like a true lord of the forest, but I pitied the poor 

brute, as he was helpless, and, although his spirit was game to the last, his strength was 

paralysed by a broken back.  It was a glorious opportunity for the horse. At the first unexpected 

roar, the camel had bolted with its rider; the horse had for a moment started on one side, and the 

men had scattered; but in an instant I had reined Tetel up, and I now rode straight towards the 

lion, who courted the encounter about twenty paces distant. I halted exactly opposite the noble-

looking beast, who, seeing me in advance of the party, increased his rage, and growled deeply, 

fixing his glance upon the horse. I now patted Tetel on the neck, and spoke to him coaxingly; he 

gazed intently at the lion, erected his mane, and snorted, but showed no signs of retreat. "Bravo! 



old boy!" I said, and, encouraging him by caressing his neck with my hand, I touched his flank 

gently with my heel; I let him just feel my hand upon the rein, and with a "Come along, old lad," 

Tetel slowly but resolutely advanced step by step towards the infuriated lion, that greeted him with 

continued growls. The horse several times snorted loudly, and stared fixedly at the terrible face 

before him; but as I constantly patted and coaxed him, he did not refuse to advance. I checked 

him when within about six yards from the lion. This would have made a magnificent picture, as the 

horse, with astounding courage, faced the lion at bay; both animals kept their eyes fixed upon 

each other, the one beaming with rage, the other with cool determination. This was enough--I 

dropped the reins upon his neck; it was a signal that Tetel perfectly understood, and he stood firm 

as a rock; for he knew that I was about to fire. I took aim at the head of the glorious but distressed 

lion, and a bullet from the little Fletcher dropped him dead. Tetel never flinched at a shot. I now 

dismounted, and having patted and coaxed the horse, I led him up to the body of the lion, which I 

also patted, and then gave my hand to the horse to smell. He snorted once or twice, and as I 

released my hold of the reins, and left him entirely free, he slowly lowered his head, and sniffed 

the mane of the dead lion: he then turned a few paces upon one side, and commenced eating the 

withered grass beneath the nabbuk bushes. My Arabs were perfectly delighted with this 

extraordinary instance of courage exhibited by the horse. I had known that the beast was disabled, 

but Tetel had advanced boldly towards the angry jaws of a lion that appeared about to spring. The 

camel was now brought to the spot and blindfolded, while we endeavoured to secure the lion upon 

its back. As the camel knelt, it required the united exertions of eight men, including myself, to raise 

the ponderous animal, and to secure it across the saddle.  Although so active and cat-like in its 

movements, a full-grown lion weighs about five hundred and fifty pounds. Having secured it, we 

shortly arrived in camp; the coup d'oeil was beautiful, as the camel entered the inclosure with the 

shaggy head and massive paws of the dead lion hanging upon one flank, while the tail nearly 

descended to the ground upon the opposite side. It was laid at full length before my wife, to whom 

the claws were dedicated as a trophy to be worn around the neck as a talisman. Not only are the 

claws prized by the Arabs, but the moustache of the lion is carefully preserved and sewn in a 

leather envelope, to be worn as an amulet; such a charm is supposed to protect the wearer from 

the attacks of wild animals.  In all probability, this was the lion that was in the habit of visiting our 

camp, as from that date, although the roars of such animals were our nightly music, we were 

never afterwards visited so closely.  As game was plentiful, the lions were exceedingly fat, and we 

preserved a large quantity of this for our lamps. When it was boiled down it was well adapted for 

burning, as it remained nearly liquid.  We had a large supply of various kinds of fat, including that 

of elephants, hippopotami, lions, and rhinoceros; but our stock of soap was exhausted, therefore I 

determined to convert a quantity of our grease into that very necessary article.  Soap-boiling is not 

so easy as may be imagined; it requires not only much attention, but the quality is dependent upon 

the proper mixture of the alkalis. Sixty parts of potash and forty of lime are, I believe, the 

proportions for common soap. I had neither lime nor potash, but I shortly procured both. The 

hegleek tree (Balanites Egyptiaca) was extremely rich in potash; therefore I burned a large 

quantity, and made a strong ley with the ashes; this I concentrated by boiling. There was no 

limestone; but the river produced a plentiful supply of large oyster-shells, that, if burned, would 

yield excellent lime. Accordingly I constructed a kiln, with the assistance of the white ants. The 



country was infested with these creatures, which had erected their dwellings in all directions; these 

were cones from six to ten feet high, formed of clay so thoroughly cemented by a glutinous 

preparation of the insects, that it was harder than sun-baked brick. I selected an egg-shaped hill, 

and cut off the top, exactly as we take off the slice from an egg. My Tokrooris then worked hard, 

and with a hoe and their lances, they hollowed it out to the base, in spite of the attacks of the ants, 

which punished the legs of the intruders considerably. I now made a draught-hole from the outside 

base, at right angles with the bottom of the hollow cone. My kiln was perfect. I loaded it with wood, 

upon which I piled about six bushels of oyster-shells, which I then covered with fuel, and kept it 

burning for twenty-four hours. This produced excellent lime, and I commenced my soap-boiling. 

We possessed an immense copper pot of Egyptian manufacture, in addition to a large and deep 

copper basin called a "teshti." These would contain about ten gallons. The ley having been boiled 

down to great strength, I added a quantity of lime, and the necessary fat. It required ten hours' 

boiling, combined with careful management of the fire, as it would frequently ascend like foam, 

and overflow the edge of the utensils. However, at length, having been constantly stirred, it turned 

to soap. Before it became cold, I formed it into cakes and balls with my hands, and the result of 

the manufacture was a weight of about forty pounds of most excellent soap, of a very sporting 

description, "Savon a la bete feroce." We thus washed with rhinoceros soap; our lamp was 

trimmed with oil of lions; our butter for cooking purposes was the fat of hippopotami, while our 

pomade was made from the marrow of buffaloes and antelopes, scented with the blossoms of 

mimosas. We were entirely independent, as our whole party had subsisted upon the produce of 

the rod and the rifle.  We were now destined to be deprived of two members of the party. Mahomet 

had become simply unbearable, and he was so impertinent that I was obliged to take a thin cane 

from one of the Arabs and administer a little physical advice. An evil spirit possessed the man, and 

he bolted off with some of the camel men who were returning to Geera with dried meat.*    * Some 

months afterwards he found his way to Khartoum,     where he was imprisoned by the Governor 

for having     deserted. He subsequently engaged himself as a soldier     in a slave-hunting 

expedition on the White Nile; and     some years later, on our return from the Albert N'yanza,     we 

met him in Shooa, on 3 degrees north latitude. He     had repented--hardships and discipline had 

effected a     change--and, like the prodigal son, he returned. I     forgave him, and took him with 

us to Khartoum, where     we left him a sadder but a wiser man. He had many near     relations 

during his long journey, all of whom had     stolen some souvenir of their cousin, and left him 

almost naked. He also met Achmet, his "mothers brother's     cousin's sister's mother's son," who 

turned up after     some years at Gondokoro as a slave-hunter; he had     joined an expedition, 

and, like all other blackguards,     he had chosen the White Nile regions for his career.     He was 

the proprietor of twenty slaves, he had assisted     in the murder of a number of unfortunate 

negroes, and     he was a prosperous and respectable individual.  Our great loss was Barrake. 

She had persisted in eating the fruit of the hegleek, although she had suffered from dysentery 

upon several occasions. She was at length attacked with congestion of the liver. My wife took the 

greatest care of her, and for weeks she had given her the entire produce of the goats, hoping that 

milk would keep up her strength; but she died after great suffering, and we buried the poor 

creature, and moved our camp.   CHAPTER XVII.  WE REACH THE ROYAN.  HAVING explored 

the Settite into the gorge of the mountain chain of Abyssinia, we now turned due south from our 



camp of Delladilla, and at a distance of twelve miles we reached the river Royan. The intervening 

country was the high and flat table-land of rich soil, that characterises the course of the Settite and 

Atbara rivers; this land was covered with hegleek trees of considerable size, and the descent to 

the Royan was through a valley, torn and washed by the rains, similar in appearance to that of the 

Settite, but upon a small scale, as the entire width did not exceed a mile.  Descending the rugged 

ground, we arrived at the margin of the river. At this season (February) the bed was perfectly dry 

sand, about ninety yards from bank to bank, and the high-water mark upon the perpendicular 

sides was a little above nine feet deep. The inclination was extremely rapid: thus the Royan during 

the rainy season must be a most frightful torrent, that supplies a large body of water to the Settite, 

but which runs dry almost immediately upon the cessation of the rains.  We descended the bank in 

a spot that had been broken down by elephants, and continued our course up stream along the 

sandy bed, which formed an excellent road. The surface was imprinted with the footsteps of every 

variety of once the general hopping and skipping ceases, as Janos Fiala, the town-servant and 

crier, appears on the scene, his drum hung round his neck and his pipe in his mouth. He stops in 

front of the "hotel," and begins to beat his drum with might and main. What can have happened? 

Perhaps the mayor's geese have strayed? Ten or twelve bystanders begin to ply him with 

questions, but Fiala would not for the world take his beloved pipe out of his mouth, nor would he 

divulge state secrets before the right moment came. So he first of all beat his drum the required 

number of times, and then with stentorian voice, shouted the following:  "Be it known to all whom it 

may interest, that a gold earring, with a green stone in it (how was he to know it was called an 

emerald?), has been lost, somewhere between the brickfield and the church. Whoever will bring 

the same to the Town Hall will be handsomely rewarded."  Gyuri paused a moment at the sound of 

the drum, listened to the crier's words, and then smiled at the look of excitement on the peasant 

girls' faces.  "I wouldn't give it back if I found it," said one.  "I'd have a hairpin made of it," said 

another.  "Heaven grant me luck!" said a third, turning her eyes piously heavenward.  "Don't look 

at the sky, you stupid," said another; "if you want to find it look at the ground."  But as chance 

would have it, some one found it who would rather not have done so, and that some one was 

Gyuri Wibra. He had only walked a few steps, when a green eye seemed to smile up at him from 

the dust under his feet. He stooped and picked it up; it was the lost earring with the emerald in it. 

How tiresome, when he was in such a hurry! Why could not one of those hundreds of people at 

the fair have found it? But the green eye looked so reproachfully at him, that he felt he could not 

give way to his first impulse and throw it back into the dust, to be trampled on by the cattle from 

the fair. Who wore such fine jewelry here? Well, whoever it belonged to, he must take it to the 

Town Hall; it was only a few steps from there after all.  He turned in at the entrance to the Town 

Hall, where some watering-cans hung from the walls, and a few old rusty implements of torture 

were exhibited (_sic transit gloria mundi!_), went up the staircase, and entered a room where the 

Senators were all assembled round a green baize-covered table, discussing a serious and difficult 

question.  A most unpleasant thing had happened. One of the watchmen in the Liskovina wood 

(the property of the town) had arrived there breathlessly not long before, with the news that a well-

dressed man had been found hanging on a tree in the wood; what was to be done with the body? 

This was what was troubling the worthy Senators, and causing them to frown and pucker their 

foreheads. Senator Konopka declared that the correct thing to do was to bring the body to the 



mortuary chapel, and at the same time give notice of the fact to the magistrate, Mr. Mihaly Gery, 

so that he could tell the district doctor to dissect the body.  Galba shook his head. He was nothing 

if not a diplomat, as he showed in the present instance. He said he considered it would be best to 

say nothing about it, but to remove the body by night a little further on, to the so-called Kvaka 

Wood, which was in the Travnik district, and let _them_ find the body. Mravucsan was undecided 

which of the two propositions to accept. He hummed and hawed and shook his head, and then 

complained it was hot enough to stifle one, that he had gout in his hand, and that one leg of the 

Senators' table was shorter than the others. This latter was soon remedied by putting some old 

deeds under the short leg. Then they waited to see which side would have the majority, and as it 

turned out it was on Galba's side. But the Galba party was again subdivided into two factions. The 

strict Galba faction wanted the dead man's body transported to the Travnik district. The moderated 

Galba faction, headed by Andras Kozsehuba, would have been contented with merely taking down 

the body, and burying it under the tree; they wanted, at all costs, to prevent its being carried 

through the village to the cemetery, which would certainly be the case if the magistrate were 

informed of the circumstances. For if a suicide were carried through a place, that place was 

threatened with damage by hail!  "Superstitious rubbish!" burst out Konopka.  "Of course, of 

course, Mr. Konopka, but who is to help it if the people are so superstitious?" asked Senator 

Fajka, of the Kozsehuba faction.  Konopka wildly banged the table with his fat, be-ringed hand, 

upon which every one was quiet.  "It is sad enough to hear a Senator say such a thing! I can 

assure you, gentlemen, that the Lord will not send His thunder-clouds in our direction just on 

account of that poor dead body. He will not punish a thousand just men because one unfortunate 

man has given himself to the devil, especially as the dead man himself would be the only one not 

hurt by the hail!"  Mravucsan breathed freely again at these wise words, which certainly raised 

one's opinion of the magistrates; he hastened to make use of the opportunity, and as once the tiny 

wren, sitting on the eagle's wings, tried to soar higher than the eagle, so did Mravucsan try to rise 

above the Senators.  "What is true is true," he said, "and I herewith beg to call your attention to the 

fact that there is nothing to be feared from hail if we bring the body through the town."  Up sprang 

Mr. Fajka at these words.  "That is all the same to us," he said; "if matters stand so, let us have 

hail by all means, for when once all the villagers are insured by the Trieste Insurance Company, I 

see no difference whether there is hail or not. In fact, it would be better if there were some, for, if I 

know the villagers well, they will immediately go and insure the harvest far beyond its worth if the 

dead body is taken through the village. So the hail would not be such a great misfortune, but the 

carriage of the corpse through the village would be."  He was a grand debater after all, that 

Senator Fajka, for he had again hit the right nail on the head, and at the same time enlightened 

the Galba and the Kozsehuba factions.  "What a brain!" they exclaimed.  The word brain reminded 

Galba of the dissecting part of the business--per _associationem idearum_--and he at once began 

to discuss the point.  "Why dissect the man? We know who he is, for it is as plain as pie-crust that 

he is an agent for some Insurance Company, and has hanged himself here in our neighborhood in 

order to make people insure their harvest. It's as clear as day!"  "You are mad, Galba," said 

Konopka crossly.  Upon which the Senators all jumped up from their places, and then the noise 

broke forth, or, as Fiala, the town-servant and crier, used to say, "they began to boil the town 

saucepan," and every eye was fixed on the mayor, the spoon which was to skim the superfluous 



froth. But the mayor drew his head down into the dark blue collar of his coat, and seemed quite to 

disappear in it; he gnawed his mustache, and stood there helplessly, wondering what he was to 

say and do now, when all at once the door opened, and Gyuri Wibra stood before them. In spite of 

all folks may say, the powers above always send help at the right moment.  At sight of the 

stranger, who, an hour or two before, had wanted to buy an old umbrella of Mrs. Muencz, the 

mayor suddenly pushed back his chair and hurried toward him (let the Senators think he had some 

important business to transact with the new arrival).  "Ah, sir," he said hurriedly, "you were looking 

for me, I suppose?"  "If you are the mayor, yes."  "Of course, of course!" (Who else could be 

mayor in Babaszek but Mravucsan, he wondered?)  "They have been crying the loss of an earring, 

and I have found it. Here it is."  The mayor's face beamed with delight.  "Now that is real honesty, 

sir. That is what I like. This is the first earring that has been lost since I have been in office, and 

even that is found. That's what I call order in the district."  Then turning to the Senators, he went 

on:  "It is only an hour since I sent the crier round the town, and here we have the earring. They 

couldn't manage that in Budapest!"  Just then he noticed that the stranger was preparing to leave. 

"Why, you surely don't mean to leave us already, sir? There is a reward offered for the finding of 

this earring."  "I do not want the reward, thank you."  "Oh, come, don't talk like that, young man, 

don't run away from luck when it comes in your way. You know the story of the poor man who 

gave his luck away to the devil without knowing it, and how sorry he was for it afterward?"  "Yes, 

he was sorry for it," answered the lawyer, smiling, as he remembered the fable, "but I don't think 

we can compare this case with that."  "I am sure you have no idea to whom the earring belongs?" 

"Not the slightest. Whose is it?"  "It belongs to the sister of the Glogova priest."  Gyuri screwed up 

his mouth doubtfully.  "Don't be too quick in your conclusions; just come here a minute; you won't 

repent it."  "Where am I to go?"  "Come into the next room."  The mayor wanted to keep him there 

at any cost, so as to gain time before deciding as to the dead man's future.  "But, my dear sir, I 

have important business to get through."  "Never mind, you must come in for a minute," and with 

that he opened the door and all but pushed the young man into the other room.  "My dear young 

lady," he called out over Gyuri's shoulder, "I have brought you your earring!"  At these words a 

young girl turned from her occupation of putting cold-water bandages on the shoulder of an elderly 

lady, lying on a sofa. Gyuri was not prepared for this apparition, and felt as confused and 

uncomfortable as though he had committed some indiscretion. The elder woman, partly 

undressed, was lying on a sofa, her wounded right shoulder (a remarkably bony one) was bare. 

The young man at the door stammered some apology, and turned to go, but Mravucsan held him 

back.  "Don't go," he said, "they won't bite you!"  The young girl, who had a very pretty attractive 

face, hastened to throw a cloak over her companion, and sprang up from her kneeling position 

beside the lady. What a figure she had! It seemed to Gyuri as though a lily, in all its simple 

grandeur, had risen before him.  "This gentleman has found your earring, and brought it you back, 

my dear."  A smile broke over her face (it was as though a ray of sunlight had found its way into 

the mayor's dark office), she blushed a little, and then made a courtesy, a real schoolgirl courtesy, 

awkward, and yet with something of grace in it.  "Thank you, sir, for your kindness. I am doubly 

glad to have found it, for I had given up all idea of ever seeing it again."  And taking it in her hand 

she gazed at it lovingly. She was a child still, you could see it in every movement. Gyuri felt he 

ought to say something, but found no suitable words.  This child disconcerted him, but there was 



something delightful in her artless manner which quite charmed him. There he stood, helpless and 

speechless, as though he were waiting for something. Was it the reward he wanted? The silence 

was getting painful, and the position awkward. At last the girl saw that the young man did not 

move, so she broke the silence.  "Oh dear! I had nearly forgotten in my delight that I had offered ... 

I mean ... how am I to say it?"  It now occurred to Gyuri that she was offering him the reward, so 

he thought it time to make known his name.  "I am Dr. Wibra," he said, "from Besztercebanya." 

"Oh, how lucky!" exclaimed the girl, clapping her hands gleefully. "We are just in want of a doctor 

for poor madame."  This little misunderstanding was just what was wanted. Gyuri smiled.  "I am 

very sorry, my dear young lady; I am not a doctor of medicine, but a doctor of law."  The young girl 

looked disappointed at this announcement, and blushed a little at her mistake; but Mravucsan was 

quite excited.  "What's that I hear? You are young Wibra, the noted lawyer? Well, that is nice! Who 

would have thought it? Now I understand. Of course, you are here to try and find out particulars 

about one of your cases. I might have thought of it when I met you at Mrs. Muencz's. Of course a 

gentleman like you must have some special reason for buying an old umbrella. Well, the fates 

must have sent you here now, for we are discussing such a very difficult question in the next room, 

that our minds are too small for it. How strange, Miss Veronica, that your earring should be found 

by such a renowned lawyer."  Veronica stole a look at the "renowned lawyer," and noticed for the 

first time how handsome he was, and how gentlemanly, and her heart began to beat at the thought 

that she had nearly offered him the five florins reward.  Mravucsan hastened to offer the lawyer a 

chair, and cast an anxious look round his office, and remarked with horror what an untidy state it 

was in; deeds lying about everywhere, coats and cloaks, belonging to the Senators, empty glasses 

and bottles, for they were in the habit of drinking a glass now and then when they had settled 

some particularly important business, which was quite right of them, for the truth that emanated 

from them must be replaced by a fresh supply, and as the Hungarians say: "There is truth in wine." 

The sight of that office would really have discouraged Mr. Mravucsan if his eye had not at that 

moment fallen on the portrait of Baron Radvanszky, the lord lieutenant of the county, hanging on 

the wall in front of him. That, after all, lent some distinction to the room. He wished from his heart 

that the baron were there in person to see what an illustrious guest they were harboring. But as 

the baron was not present, he felt it devolved on him to express his satisfaction at the fact.  "I am a 

poor man," he said, "but I would not accept a hundred florins in place of the honor that is done to 

my poor office to-day. It is worth something to have the most renowned lawyer in the county, and 

the prettiest young lady ..."  "Oh, Mr. Mravucsan!" exclaimed Veronica, blushing furiously.  "Well," 

said Mravucsan, "what's true is true. One need not be ashamed of being pretty. I was good-

looking myself once, but I was never ashamed of it. Besides, a pretty face is of great use to one, 

isn't it, Mr. Wibra?"  "Yes, it is a very lucky thing," answered Gyuri quickly.  Mravucsan shook his 

head.  "Let us simply say it is a great help, for luck can easily turn to misfortune, and misfortune to 

luck, as was the case now, for if it had not been for to-day's accident, I should not now have the 

pleasure of seeing you all here."  "What is that?" asked Gyuri. "An accident?"  Veronica was going 

to answer, but that talkative mayor put in his word again.  "Yes, there was an accident, but in a 

short time there will be no traces of it, for the earring is here, madame's shoulder is here, it will be 

blue for some days, but what the devil does that matter, it is not the color makes the shoulder. And 

the carriage will be all right, too, when the smith has mended it."  "So those horses that were 



running away with a broken carriage...?"  "Were ours," said Veronica. "They took fright near the 

brickfield, the coachman lost his hold of the reins, and when he stooped to gather them up, he was 

thrown out of the carriage. In our fright we jumped out too. I did not hurt myself, but poor madame 

struck her shoulder on something. I hope it will be nothing serious. Does it hurt very much, 

Madame Krisbay?"  Madame opened her small yellow eyes, which till then had been closed, and 

the first sight that met them was Veronica's untidy hair.  "Smooth your hair," she said in French in 

a low voice, then groaned once or twice, and closed her eyes again.  Veronica, greatly alarmed, 

raised her hand to her head, and found that one of her plaits was partly undone.  "Oh, my hair!" 

she exclaimed. "The hairpins must have fallen out when I jumped out of the carriage. What am I to 

do?"  "Let down the other plait," advised Mravucsan. "That's it, my dear; it is much prettier so, isn't 

it, Wibra?"  "Much prettier," answered Gyuri, casting an admiring glance at the two black, velvety 

plaits, with a lovely dark bluish tinge on them, which hung nearly down to the edge of her 

millefleurs skirt.  So that was the priest's sister. He could hardly believe it, for he had imagined a 

fat, waddling, red-faced woman, smelling of pomade. That is what parish priests' sisters are 

generally like. The lawyer thought it was time to start a conversation.  "I suppose you were very 

frightened?"  "Not very; in fact, I don't think I was startled at all. But now I begin to fear my brother 

will be anxious about me."  "The priest of Glogova?"  "Yes. He is very fond of me, and will be so 

anxious if we do not return. And yet I hardly know how we are to manage it."  "Well," said 

Mravucsan, consolingly, "we have the horses, and we will borrow a cart from some one." 

Veronica shuddered and shook her head.  "With those horses? Never again!"  "But, my dear 

young lady, you must never take horses seriously, they have no real character. You see, this is 

how it was. Near the brickfield there is that immense windmill, for of course every town must have 

one. The world is making progress, in spite of all Senator Fajka says. Well, as I said, there is the 

windmill. I had it built, for every one made fun of us because we had no water in the neighborhood. 

So I make use of the wind. Of course, the horses don't understand that; they are good mountain 

horses, and had never seen a beast with such enormous wings, turning in the air, so of course 

they were frightened and ran away. You can't wonder at it. But that is all over now, and they will 

take you quietly home."  "No, no, I'm afraid of them. Oh, how dreadful they were! If you had only 

seen them! I won't go a step with them. As far as I am concerned, I could walk home, but poor 

Madame Krisbay ..."  "Now that would be a nice sort of thing to do," remarked Mravucsan. "Fancy 

my allowing my best friend's little sister to walk all the way home with those tiny feet of hers! How 

she would stumble and trip over the sharp stones in the mountain paths! And his reverence would 

say: 'My friend Mravucsan is a nice sort of fellow to let my sister walk home, after all the good 

dinners and suppers I have given him.' Why, I would rather take you home on my own back, my 

dear, right into Glogova parish!"  Veronica looked gratefully at Mravucsan, and Gyuri wondered, if 

it came to the point, would Mravucsan be able to carry out his plan, or would he have to be carried 

himself. The mayor was an elderly man, and looked as though he were breaking up. He found 

himself glancing curiously at the old gentleman, measuring his strength, the breadth of his chest, 

and of his shoulders, as though the most important fact now were, who was to take Veronica on 

his back. He decided that Mravucsan was too weak to do it, and smiled to himself when he 

discovered how glad this thought made him.  Mravucsan's voice broke in upon his musings.  "Well, 

my dear," he was saying, "don't you worry yourself about it; take a rest first, and then we will see 



what is to be done. Of course it would be better to have other horses, but where are we to get 

them from? No one in Babaszek keeps horses, we only need oxen. I myself only keep oxen. For a 

mountain is a mountain, and horses are of no use there, for they can, after all, only do what an ox 

can, namely, walk slowly. You can't make a grand show here with horses, and let them gallop and 

prance about, and toss their manes. This is a serious part, yes, I repeat it, a serious part. The chief 

thing is to pull, and that is the work of an ox. A horse gets tired of it, and when it knows the 

circumstances it loses all pleasure in life, and seems to say: 'I'm not such a fool as to grow for 

nothing, I'll be a foal all my life.' And the horses round about here are not much bigger than a dog, 

and are altogether wretched-looking."  He would have gone on talking all night, and running the 

poor horses down to the ground, if Gyuri had not interrupted him.  "But I have my dog-cart here, 

Miss Veronica, and will take you home with pleasure."  "Will you really," exclaimed Mravucsan. "I 

knew you were a gentleman. But why on earth didn't you say so before?"  "Because you gave me 

no chance to put in a word edgeways."  "That is true," laughed Mravucsan good-humoredly. "So 

you will take them?"  "Of course, even if I were not going to Glogova myself."  "Are you really 

going there?" asked Veronica, surprised.  "Yes."  She looked at him thoughtfully for a minute, and 

then said:  "Don't try to deceive us."  Gyuri smiled.  "On my word of honor, I intended going to 

Glogova. Shall we all go together?"  Veronica nodded her head, and was just going to clap her 

hands like the child she was, when madame began to move on the sofa, and gave a deep sigh. 

"Oh dear," said Veronica, "I had quite forgotten madame. Perhaps after all I can't go with you." 

"And why not? The carriage is big enough, there will be plenty of room."  "Yes, but may I?"  "Go 

home? Who is to prevent it?"  "Why, don't you know?"  "What?" asked Gyuri, surprised.  "Why, 

etiquette, of course," she said shyly.  (Gyuri smiled. Oh, what a little simpleton she was!)  "Yes, 

yes," she assured them, seeing they were laughing at her, "it says in the book on etiquette: 'You 

must not accept the arm of a stranger.'"  "But a carriage is not an arm," burst out Mravucsan. "How 

could it be? If it were, I should have two carriages myself. My dear child, leave etiquette to look 

after itself. In Babaszek I decide what is etiquette, not the French mamselles. And _I_ say a 

carriage is not an arm, so there's an end of it."  "Of course you are right, but all the same, I must 

speak to madame about it."  "Just as you like, my dear."  Veronica again knelt down by the sofa, 

and a whispered conversation ensued, the result of which was, as Gyuri understood from the few 

words he could hear, that madame quite shared Mravucsan's view of the case, that a carriage is 

not an arm, and that if two people have been introduced to each other, they are not strangers, and 

consequently, in Madame Krisbay's opinion, they ought to accept the young man's offer. Besides, 

in times of danger there is no such thing as etiquette. Beautiful Blanche Montmorency on the 

occasion of a fire was saved by the Marquis Privadiere with nothing on but her nightgown, and yet 

the tower of Notre Dame is still standing!  Gyuri felt as impatient as a card-player when the cards 

are being dealt, and a large stake has been placed on one of them, until at length Veronica turned 

round.  "We shall be very thankful if you will take us in your carriage," she said, smiling, as she 

was sure Blanche Montmorency would have done under the same conditions.  Gyuri received the 

announcement with delight.  "I will go and see after the carriage," he said, taking up his hat. But 

Mravucsan stood in his way.  "Oh, no, you don't," he said. "_Pro primo_, even if Veronica can go, I 

am sure Madame Krisbay cannot start yet; it would be a sin to make her drive now; she must rest 

a bit first, after her fright and her bruises. If my wife puts some of her wonderful plaster on it to-



night, she'll be perfectly well in the morning. _Pro secundo_, you can't go because I won't allow 

you to. _Pro tertio_, because it is getting dark. Please look out of the window."  He was right; the 

sun had disappeared behind the dark blue lines of the Zolyom Hills, and the fir-trees in front of the 

Town Hall cast their long shadows down the road, right up to the Mravucsan garden, where a lean 

cat was performing its evening ablutions among the oleanders. All the same Gyuri began to plead 

(it was part of his business).  "It will be a quiet, warm night," he said. "Why should we not start? 

After all it can make no difference to madame whether she groans in bed or in the carriage."  "But 

it will be dark," objected Mravucsan, "and there are some very bad bits of road between here and 

Glogova, and two or three precipices. In spite of my being mayor, I cannot order moonlight for 

you."  "We don't need it; we can light the lamps."  Veronica seemed undecided, and glanced from 

one to the other of the gentlemen, till at length Mravucsan put in the finishing touch.  "There will be 

a storm to-night, for there is the dead body of a man hanging on a tree in the wood you have to 

pass through."  Veronica shuddered.  "I would not go through that wood by night for anything," she 

exclaimed.  That settled the question. Gyuri bowed, and received a bright smile in return, and 

Mravucsan rushed into the next room, and told Konopka to take his place (oh, his delight at getting 

rid of his responsibility!), as he had visitors, and had no time to think of other things; and then he 

whispered in the ears of some of the Senators (those who had on the best coats) that he would be 

pleased to see them to supper. Then off he trotted home, to announce the arrival of visitors, and 

give orders for their reception. On the staircase he caught sight of Fiala, and sent him to tell 

Wibra's coachman, who was waiting with the dog-cart outside Mrs. Muencz's shop, to go and put 

up in his courtyard.  After a few minutes, Mrs. Mravucsan appeared at the Town Hall to take the 

ladies home with her. She was a short, stout, amiable woman, whose broad, smiling face spoke of 

good temper and kindheartedness. She was dressed like all women of the middle class in that 

part, in a 


_
about two feet deep had been dug in the sand by the antelopes and baboons to procure water. 

Great numbers of the oterop, a small reddish-brown antelope without horns (Calotragus 

Montanus) were drinking at these little watering-places, and did not appear to heed us. We 

disturbed many nellut and tetel upon the banks, and after having marched about four miles along 

the river's bed, we halted at a beautiful open forest of large trees at the junction of Hor Mai Gubba. 

This was a considerable torrent, which is tributary to the Royan; at this spot it had cut through a 

white sandstone cliff, about eighty feet perpendicular: thus upon either side it was walled in. The 

word Gubba is Abyssinian for the nabbuk, therefore the torrent was the Nabbuk River: this flowed 

past the village of Mai Gubba, which is the head-quarters of Mek Nimmur, from which we were not 

twenty-five miles distant. We camped in a forest of the largest trees that we had as yet seen in 

Africa, and as we had observed the fresh tracks of horses, on the sand, some of my Arabs went in 

search of the aggageers of Taher Sheriff's party, whom they had expected to meet at this point. 

While they were gone, I took a few men to beat the low jungle within the forest for francolin 

partridge, numbers of which I had seen running through the covert. I went up the dry bed of the 

river at the junction of the Hor Gubba, while they drove towards me, and I was compelled to fire as 

fast as I could load, as these beautiful birds flew across the ravine. I shot five brace almost 

immediately. There is no better game bird than the francolin: the flesh is white, and of a most 

delicate and rich flavour. My shots had attracted the aggageers, and shortly after my return to 

camp they arrived with my Arabs, as they had been stationed on the opposite side of the Royan in 

a forest within a quarter of a mile of us. Taher Sheriff was delighted to see us free from the 

company of Abou Do. His party had killed several elephants, and had captured two young ones; 

also, two young rhinoceroses, three giraffes, and several young antelopes; these were to be sold 

to Johann Schmidt, who contracted to supply the Italian agent at Cassala. I agreed to have a long 

day's hunt with Taher Sheriff; we were to start before sunrise, as he wished to ride to a spot about 

twenty-five miles distant, up the course of the Royan, that was a favourite resort for elephants. 

That evening we had a delicious dinner of francolin partridges. This species is rather larger than 

the French partridge: it is dark brown, mottled with black feathers, with a red mark around the eye, 

and double spurs.  There was a small but deep pool of water in the bed of the river, beneath the 

high bank about two hundred paces from our camp; this was a mere hole of about twenty feet 

square, and I expected that large game might come to drink during the night. Accordingly, I 

determined to watch for elephants, as their tracks were numerous throughout the bed of the river. 

My wife and two gun-bearers accompanied me, and we sat behind an immense tree that grew on 

the bank, exactly about the drinking place. I watched for hours, until I fell asleep, as did my men 

likewise: my wife alone was awake, and a sudden tug at my sleeve attracted my attention. The 

moon was bright, and she had heard a noise upon the branches of the tree above us: there were 

no leaves, therefore I quickly observed some large animal upon a thick bough. My Tokrooris had 

awoke, and they declared it to be a baboon. I knew this to be impossible, as the baboon is never 

solitary, and I was just preparing to fire, when down jumped a large leopard within a few feet of us, 

and vanished before I had time to shoot. It must have winded our party, and quietly ascended the 

tree to reconnoitre. Nothing but hyaenas came to the pool, therefore we returned to camp. 

According to my agreement, I went to the aggageers' camp at 5 A.M. with Hadji Ali and Hassan, 

both mounted on my two horses, Aggahr and Gazelle, while I rode Tetel. Taher Sheriff requested 



me not to shoot at anything, as the shots might alarm and scare away elephants; therefore I 

merely carried my little Fletcher, in case of meeting the Base, who hunted in this country. The 

aggageers mounted their horses; each man carried an empty water-skin slung to his saddle, to be 

filled at the river should it be necessary to quit its banks. We started along the upward course of 

the Royan.  For seven hours we rode, sometimes along the bed of the river between lofty 

overhanging rocks, or through borders of fine forest-trees; at other times we cut off a bend of the 

stream, and rode for some miles through beautiful country diversified with hills, and abounding in 

enormous baobab-trees (Adansonia digitata). At length we entered the mountains at the foot of the 

great chain. Here the views were superb. The Royan was no longer a stream of ninety or a 

hundred yards in width, but it was reduced to a simple mountain torrent about forty yards across, 

blocked in many places by masses of rock, while at others it had formed broad pools, all of which 

were now perfectly dry, and exhibited a bed of glaring sand. Numerous mountain ravines joined 

the main channel, and as the inclination was extremely rapid, there could be little doubt that the 

violent storms of the rainy season, descending from the great chain of mountains, would, by 

concentrating in the Royan, suddenly give birth to an impetuous torrent, that would materially 

affect the volume of the Settite. The entire country bore witness to the effect of violent rains, as the 

surface was torn and water-worn.  We had ridden nearly thirty miles, having seen large quantities 

of game, including antelopes, buffaloes, giraffes, and rhinoceroses, none of which we had hunted, 

as we were in search of elephants. This was the country where the aggageers had expected, 

without fail, to find their game.  They now turned away from the Royan, and descended a sandy 

valley at the foot of the mountains, the bottom of which appeared to have been overflowed during 

the wet season. Here were large strips of forest, and numerous sandy watercourses, along the dry 

bed of which we quickly discovered the deep tracks of elephants. They had been digging fresh 

holes in the sand in search of water, in which welcome basins we found a good supply; we 

dismounted, and rested the horses for half an hour, while the hunters followed up the tracks on the 

bed of the stream. Upon their return, they reported the elephants as having wandered off upon the 

rocky ground, that rendered further tracking impossible. We accordingly remounted, and, upon 

arrival at the spot where they had lost the tracks, we continued along the bed of the stream. We 

had ridden about a mile, and were beginning to despair, when suddenly we turned a sharp angle 

in the watercourse, and Taher Sheriff, who was leading, immediately reined in his horse, and 

backed him towards the party. I followed his example, and we were at once concealed by the 

sharp bend of the river. He now whispered, that a bull elephant was drinking from a hole it had 

scooped in the sand, not far round the corner. Without the slightest confusion, the hunters at once 

fell quietly into their respective places, Taher Sheriff leading, while I followed closely in the line, 

with my Tokrooris bringing up the rear; we were a party of seven horses.  Upon turning the corner, 

we at once perceived the elephant, that was still drinking. It was a fine bull; the enormous ears 

were thrown forward, as the head was lowered in the act of drawing up the water through the 

trunk; these shaded the eyes, and, with the wind favourable, we advanced noiselessly upon the 

sand to within twenty yards before we were perceived. The elephant then threw up its head, and, 

with the ears flapping forward, it raised its trunk for an instant, and then slowly, but easily, 

ascended the steep bank, and retreated. The aggageers now halted for about a minute to confer 

together, and then followed in their original order up the crumbled bank. We were now on most 



unfavourable ground; the fire that had cleared the country we had hitherto traversed had been 

stopped by the bed of the torrent. We were thus plunged at once into withered grass above our 

heads, unless we stood in the stirrups; the ground was strewed with fragments of rock, and 

altogether it was ill-adapted for riding. However, Taher Sheriff broke into a trot, followed by the 

entire party, as the elephant was not in sight. We ascended a hill, and when near the summit, we 

perceived the elephant about eighty yards ahead. It was looking behind during its retreat, by 

swinging its huge head from side to side, and upon seeing us approach, it turned suddenly round 

and halted. "Be ready, and take care of the rocks!" said Taher Sheriff, as I rode forward by his 

side. Hardly had he uttered these words of caution, when the bull gave a vicious jerk with its head, 

and with a shrill scream it charged down upon us with the greatest fury. Away we all went, helter 

skelter, through the dry grass, which whistled in my ears, over the hidden rocks, at full gallop, with 

the elephant tearing after us for about a hundred and eighty yards at a tremendous pace. Tetel 

was a sure-footed horse, and, being unshod, he never slipped upon the stones. Thus, as we all 

scattered in different directions, the elephant became confused, and relinquished the chase; it had 

been very near me at one time, and in such ground I was not sorry when it gave up the hunt. We 

now quickly united, and again followed the elephant, that had once more retreated. Advancing at a 

canter, we shortly came in view. Upon seeing the horses, the bull deliberately entered a 

stronghold composed of rocky and uneven ground, in the clefts of which grew thinly a few leafless 

trees, the thickness of a man's leg. It then turned boldly towards us, and stood determinedly at 

bay.  Now came the tug of war! Taher Sheriff came close to me and said,	 "You had better shoot 

the elephant, as we shall have great difficulty in this rocky ground:" this I declined, as I wished to 

end the fight as it had been commenced, with the sword; and I proposed that he should endeavour 

to drive the animal to more favourable ground. "Never mind," replied Taher, "Inshallah (please 

God) he shall not beat us." He now advised me to keep as close to him as possible, and to look 

sharp for a charge.  The elephant stood facing us like a statue; it did not move a muscle beyond a 

quick and restless action of the eyes, that were watching all sides. Taher Sheriff and his youngest 

brother Ibrahim now separated, and each took opposite sides of the elephant, and then joined 

each other about twenty yards behind it; I accompanied them, until Taher advised me to keep 

about the same distance upon the left flank. My Tokrooris kept apart from the scene, as they were 

not required. In front of the elephant were two aggageers, one of whom was the renowned Roder 

Sheriff, with the withered arm. All being ready for action, Roder now rode slowly towards the head 

of the cunning old bull, who was quietly awaiting an opportunity to make certain of some one who 

might give him a good chance.  Roder Sheriff rode a bay mare, that, having been thoroughly 

trained to these encounters, was perfect at her work. Slowly and coolly she advanced towards her 

wary antagonist, until within about eight or nine yards of the elephant's head; the creature never 

moved, and the mise en scene was beautiful; not a word was spoken, and we kept our places 

amidst utter stillness, which was at length broken by a snort from the mare, who gazed intently at 

the elephant, as though watching for the moment of attack.  One more pace forward, and Roder 

sat coolly upon his mare, with his eyes fixed upon those of the elephant. For an instant I saw the 

white of the eye nearest to me "Look out, Roder! he's coming!" I exclaimed. With a shrill scream, 

the elephant dashed upon him like an avalanche!  Round went the mare as though upon a pivot, 

and away, over rocks and stones, flying like a gazelle, with the monkey-like form of little Roder 



Sheriff leaning forward, and looking over his left shoulder as the elephant rushed after him.  For a 

moment I thought he must be caught. Had the mare stumbled, all were lost; but she gained in the 

race after a few quick bounding strides, and Roder, still looking behind him, kept his distance so 

close to the elephant, that its outstretched trunk was within a few feet of the mare's tail.  Taher 

Sheriff and his brother Ibrahim swept down like falcons in the rear. In full speed they dexterously 

avoided the trees, until they arrived upon open ground, when they dashed up close to the hind-

quarters of the furious elephant, who, maddened with the excitement, heeded nothing but Roder 

and his mare, that were almost within its grasp. When close to the tail of the elephant, Taher 

Sheriff's sword flashed from its sheath, as grasping his trusty blade he leapt nimbly to the ground, 

while Ibrahim caught the reins of his horse; two or three bounds on foot, with the sword clutched in 

both hands, and he was close behind the elephant; a bright glance shone like lightning, as the sun 

struck upon the descending steel; this was followed by a dull crack, as the sword cut through skin 

and sinews, and settled deep in the bone, about twelve inches above the foot. At the next stride, 

the elephant halted dead short in the midst of its tremendous charge. Taher had jumped quickly on 

one side, and had vaulted into the saddle with his naked sword in hand. At the same moment, 

Roder, who had led the chase, turned sharp round, and again faced the elephant as before; 

stooping quickly from the saddle, he picked up from the ground a handful of dirt, which he threw 

into the face of the vicious-looking animal, that once more attempted to rush upon him. It was 

impossible! the foot was dislocated, and turned up in front like an old shoe. In an instant Taher 

was once more on foot, and again the sharp sword slashed the remaining leg. The great bull 

elephant could not move! the first cut with the sword had utterly disabled it; the second was its 

death blow; the arteries of the leg were divided, and the blood spouted in jets from the wounds. I 

wished to terminate its misery by a bullet behind the ear, but Taher Sheriff begged me not to fire, 

as the elephant would quickly bleed to death without pain, and an unnecessary shot might attract 

the Base, who would steal the flesh and ivory during our absence. We were obliged to return 

immediately to our far distant camp, and the hunters resolved to accompany their camels to the 

spot upon the following day. We turned our horses' heads, and rode direct towards home, which 

we did not reach until nearly midnight, having ridden upwards of sixty miles during the day.  The 

hunting of Taher Sheriff and his brothers was superlatively beautiful; with an immense amount of 

dash, there was a cool, sportsman-like manner in their mode of attack, that far excelled the 

impetuous and reckless onset of Abou Do; it was difficult to decide which to admire the most, 

whether the coolness and courage of him who led the elephant, or the extraordinary skill and 

activity of the aggahr who dealt the fatal blow.  On the following day, the hunters started to the 

dead elephant with camels and sacks, but they returned at night thoroughly disgusted; the nimble 

Base had been before them, most probably attracted to the carcase by the cloud of vultures that 

had gathered in the air. Nothing remained but the bones and skirt and black silk apron, and on her 

head she wore a black silk frilled cap.  She entered the room noisily, as such simple village folks 

do.  "Well, I never!" she exclaimed. "Mravucsan says you are going to be our guests. Is it true? 

What an honor for us! But I knew it, I felt it, for last night I dreamed a white lily was growing out of 

my basin, and this is the fulfilment of the dream. Well, my dear, get all your things together, and I'll 

carry them across, for I'm as strong as a bear. But I forgot to tell you the most important thing, 

which I really ought to have said at the beginning: I am Mrs. Mravucsan. Oh, my dear young lady, I 



should never have thought you were so pretty! Holy Virgin! Now I understand her sending down an 

umbrella to keep the rain off your pretty face! So the poor lady is ill, has hurt her shoulder? Well, 

I've got a capital plaster we'll put on it; come along. Don't give way, my dear, it has to be borne. 

Why, I had a similar accident once, Mravucsan was driving too. We fell into a ditch, and two of my 

ribs were broken, and I've had trouble with my liver ever since. Such things will happen now and 

then. Does it hurt you very much?"  "The lady does not speak Slovak," said Veronica, "nor 

Hungarian."  "Good gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Mravucsan, clasping her hands. "So old, and can't 

even speak Hungarian! How is that?"  And Veronica was obliged to explain that madame had 

come direct from Munich to be her companion, and had never yet been in Hungary; she was the 

widow of a French officer, she added, for Mrs. Mravucsan insisted on having full particulars. They 

had received a letter from her the day before yesterday, saying she was coming, and Veronica 

had wanted to meet her at the station.  "So that is how it is. And she can't even speak Slovak nor 

Hungarian! Poor unhappy woman! And what am I to do with her?--whom am I to put next her at 

table?--how am I to offer her anything? Well, it will be a nice muddle! Luckily the schoolmaster can 

speak German, and perhaps the young gentleman can too?"  "Don't you worry about that, Mrs. 

Mravucsan, I'll amuse her at supper, and look after her wants," answered Gyuri.  With great 

difficulty they got ready to go, Madame Krisbay moaning and groaning as they tried to dress her, 

after having sent Gyuri into the passage. Mrs. Mravucsan collected all the shawls, rugs, and 

cloaks, and hung them over her arm.  "We will send the servant for the lady's box," she said. 

Then she made madame lean on her, and they managed to get her downstairs. Madame was 

complaining, half in French, half in German, and the mayor's wife chatted continually, sometimes 

to the young couple walking in front, sometimes to madame, who, with her untidy hair, looked 

something like a poor sick cockatoo.  "This way, this way, my dear young lady. That is our house 

over there. Only a few more steps, my dear madame. Oh, the dog won't bite you. Go away, 

Garam! We shall be there directly. You will see what a good bed I will give you to sleep in to-night; 

such pillows, the softest you can imagine!"  It made no difference to her that Madame Krisbay did 

not understand a word of what she was saying. Many women talk for the sake of talking. Why 

should they not? They are probably afraid a spider might spin its web before their mouth.  "It hurts 

you, does it not? But it will hurt still more to-morrow; that is always the way with a bruise of that 

kind. Why, you will feel it in two weeks' time."  Then, casting a sly glance at the pair walking in 

front:  "They make a handsome couple, don't they?"  It was not far to the Mravucsans' house, and 

it would have been nearer still if there had not been an immense pool of water just in front of the 

Town Hall, to avoid which they had to go a good bit out of their way. But this pool was a necessity, 

for all the geese and ducks in the village swam on it, the pigs came and wallowed in the mud 

round it, and last, but not least, the firemen took their water from here in case of fire. Oh, I forgot to 

say that all the frogs from the whole neighborhood had taken up their abode in it, and gave 

splendid concerts to the villagers.  So, as I said before, they needed the pool and gladly put up 

with its presence, and it was considered common property. Once a civil engineer had been sent 

there by the county authorities, and he had called their attention to the fact that the pool ought to 

be filled up; but they just laughed at him, and left it as it was.  So now they had to go right round 

the pool to the "hotel," which strangers always named the "Frozen Sheep," in reference to the 

story I mentioned before. The gypsies were still playing inside, and outside several couples were 



turning in time to music, and some peasants were standing about drinking their glass of "palinka" 

(a kind of brandy), while a wagoner from Zolyom sat alone at a table drinking as hard as he could. 

He was already rather drunk, and was keeping up a lively conversation all by himself, gazing now 

and then with loving eyes at the lean horse harnessed to his cart, and which, with drooping head, 

was awaiting his master's pleasure to move on.  "My neighbor says," philosophized the wagoner 

aloud, "that my horse is not a horse. And why is it not a horse, pray? It was a horse in the time of 

Kossuth! What? It can't draw a load? Of course not, if the load is too heavy. It is thin, is it? Of 

course it is thin, for I don't give it any oats. Why don't I give it any? Why, because I have none, of 

course. What's that you say? The other day it couldn't drag my cart? No, because the wheel was 

stuck in the mud. My neighbor is a great donkey, isn't he?"  Upon which, up he got, and stumbled 

over to the dancers, requesting them to give their opinion as to whether his neighbor was a 

donkey or not. They got out of his way, so, like a mad dog, which sees and hears nothing, the 

wagoner rushed upon Madame Krisbay.  "Is mine a horse, or is it not?"  Madame was frightened, 

and the smell of brandy, which emanated from the good man, made her feel faint.  "_Mon Dieu!_" 

she murmured, "what a country I have come to!"  But Mrs. Mravucsan, gentle as she was 

generally, could also be energetic if necessary.  "I don't know if yours is a horse or not," she said, 

"but I can tell you you're a drunken beast!"  And with that she gave him a push which sent him 

rolling over on his back. He lay there murmuring:  "My neighbor says my horse is blind in one eye. 

Nonsense! He can see the road just as well with one eye as with two."  Then up he got, and began 

to follow them, and Madame Krisbay, leaving go of Mrs. Mravucsan's arm, and in her fright 

forgetting her wounded shoulder, took to her heels and ran. The dancers seeing her went into fits 

of laughter at the pair of thin legs she showed.  "How on earth can she run so fast with such thin 

legs?" they asked each other.  Still more surprised were Veronica and Gyuri (who had seen 

nothing of the incident with the wagoner); they could not imagine why the sick woman was running 

at the top of her speed.  "Madame! madame! What is the matter?"  She gave no answer, only 

rushed to the Mravucsans' house, where she again had a fright at the sight of three enormous 

watch-dogs, who received her with furious barks. She would have fallen in a faint on the floor, but 

at that moment Mravucsan appeared on the scene to receive his guests, so she fell into his arms 

instead. The good mayor just held her quietly, with astonished looks, for he had never yet seen a 

fainting woman, though he had heard they ought to be sprinkled with water, but how was he to go 

for water? Then he remembered he had heard that pinching was a good remedy, that it would, in 

fact, wake a dead woman; but in order to pinch a person, she must have some flesh, and Madame 

Krisbay had nothing but bones. So he waited with Christian patience till the others arrived on the 

scene, and then gave her up to their tender mercies.  "Phew!" he breathed, "what a relief!" 

Intellectual Society in Babaszek  PART IV     CHAPTER I.  THE SUPPER AT THE 

MRAVUCSANS'   I am not fond of drawing things out to too great a length, so will only give a short 

description of the Mravucsans' supper, which was really excellent, and if any one were 

discontented, it could only have been Madame Krisbay, who burned her mouth severely when 

eating of the first dish, which was lamb with paprika.  "Oh," she exclaimed, "something is pricking 

my throat!"  But the pudding she found still less to her taste (a plain paste rolled out very thin, and 

cut into squares, boiled and served up with curds and whey, and small squares of fried bacon). 

"_Mon Dieu!_" she said, "it looks like small bits of wet linen!"  Poor Mrs. Mravucsan was 



inconsolable at her guest's want of appetite.  "It is such a disgrace for me," she said.  Then it 

occurred to her to offer her some of her preserved fruit, and to this madame seemed to take a 

fancy, for she finished up the dish, and in proportion as her hunger was appeased, her liking for 

her surroundings increased.  She had the Lutheran clergyman, Samuel Rafanidesz, on her right, 

and the schoolmaster, Teofil Klempa, on her left, and to them was deputed the task of entertaining 

the unfortunate foreigner. Their invitations had been put in this form:  "You _must_ come, for there 

is to be a German lady at supper, whom you are to entertain."  And they did all they could to prove 

to the rest of the company how much at ease they were in good German society.  Madame 

Krisbay seemed very contented with her neighbors, especially when she discovered that the Rev. 

Samuel Rafanidesz was a bachelor. What! did clergymen marry there? (Perhaps, after all, she had 

not come to such a bad country!)  The schoolmaster was a much handsomer man, but he was 

older, and was, besides, married. He had an intelligent face, and a long, flowing black beard; he 

had, too, a certain amount of wit, which he dealt out in small portions. Madame Krisbay smiled at 

his sallies. Poor woman! She would have liked to have laughed at them, but did not dare to, for her 

throat was still burning from the effects of that horrid paprika. Now and then her face (which was 

otherwise like yellow wax) got quite red from the efforts she made to keep from coughing, which, 

besides being the forerunner of old age, she also considered very demeaning.  "Don't mind us, my 

dear," called out the mayor's wife, "cough away as much as you like. A cough and poverty cannot 

be hidden."  Madame began to feel more and more at home, for, as it turned out, the clergyman 

had been at school at Munich, and could tell a lot of anecdotes of his life there, in the Munich 

dialect, much to madame's delight. The Rev. Samuel Rafanidesz did not belong to the stiff, 

unpleasant order of clergymen, and there was a Slovak sentence composed by Teofil Klempa, 

often repeated by the good people of Babaszek, which bore reference to him, and which, if read 

backward, gave his name: "Szedi na fare, Rafanidesz" ("Stay in your parish, Rafanidesz".) But he 

never took this advice, and had already been sent away from one living (somewhere in Nograd) 

because of an entanglement with some lady in the parish. Mrs. Mravucsan knew the whole story, 

and even the lady, a certain Mrs. Baho. She must have been a silly woman, for it was she herself 

who let the cat out of the bag, to her own husband too; and she was not a beauty either, as we 

can see from Mrs. Mravucsan's words:  "Rafanidesz was a fool. You should never ask a kiss from 

an ugly woman, nor a loan from a poor man, for they immediately go and boast of it."  Thus Mrs. 

Mravucsan. It is true she added:  "But if any one were to call me as a witness, I should deny the 

whole thing."  So you see, I can't stand good for the truth of it either. But that is neither here nor 

there.  Madame Krisbay certainly enjoyed the company of her two neighbors, and those 

gentlemen soon raised the whole country in her estimation. But it was lucky she understood no 

Slovak, and could not hear the conversation carried on by the intelligence of Babaszek. Of course 

they were clever people too, in their way, and Veronica often smiled at the jokes made, for they 

were all new to her, though the natives of Babaszek knew them all by heart; for instance, the rich 

butcher, Pal Kukucska, always got up when the third course was on the table, and drank to his 

own health, saying:  "Long life to my wife's husband!"  It would really be waste of time to try and 

describe the supper, for nothing of any real importance happened. They ate, they drank, and then 

they went home. Perhaps they spoke of important matters? Not they! Only a thousand trifles were 

discussed, which it would be a pity to put in print; and yet the incidents of that supper were the talk 



of Babaszek for weeks after. For instance, Mr. Mravucsan upset a glass of wine with the sleeve of 

his coat, and while they were wiping it up, and strewing salt on the stain, Senator Konopka, turning 

to the lady of the house, exclaimed:  "That means a christening, madam!"  Of course Mrs. 

Mravucsan blushed, but Veronica asked in a most innocent tone:  "How can you know that?" (She 

was either a goose, that young girl, or she was a good actress.)  Now who was to answer her with 

a face as innocent as the Blessed Virgin's must have been when she was a girl in short frocks? 

They all looked at each other, but luckily the forester's wife, Mrs. Wladimir Szliminszky, came to 

the rescue with this explanation:  "You see, my dear, the stork which brings the children generally 

lets one know beforehand, and the knocking over a glass is one of the signs it gives."  Veronica 

thought for a bit, and then shook her head unbelievingly.  "But I saw the gentleman knock the 

glass over himself," she objected.  To this Mrs. Szliminszky had no answer ready, so, according to 

her usual custom, she turned to her husband and began worrying him.  "Wladin, cut the fat off that 

meat."  Wladin frowned.  "But, my dear, that is just the best bit."  "Never mind, Wladin, I can't allow 

it. Your health is the first consideration."  And Wladin obediently cut off the fat bits.  "Why is your 

coat unbuttoned? Don't you feel how cold it is? Button it up at once, Wladin."  The forester did as 

he was told, and with the pleasant feeling of having done his duty, turned his attention to his plate 

again.  "Not another bit, Wladin, you've had enough. We don't want you to dream of bulls to-night." 

Wladin obediently put down his knife and fork, and prepared to drink a glass of water.  "Give it me 

first," cried his wife excitedly. "I want to see that it is not too cold."  Wladin handed over his glass 

of water.  "You may drink a little of it, but not too much. Stop, stop, that will do!"  Poor Wladin! He 

was a martyr to conjugal love! For sixteen years he had suffered under this constant 

thoughtfulness, and though he was a strong man when he married, and had never been ill since, 

yet every minute of his life he expected some catastrophe; for, through constant warnings, the 

unfortunate Pole had worked himself up to the belief that a current of air or a drop of water could 

be disastrous to him. He felt that Nature had bad intentions toward him.  "Take care, Wladin, or 

the dog will bite your foot!"  One of the watch-dogs was under the table gnawing at a bone he had 

possessed himself of, and a little farther off the cat was looking on, longingly, as much as to say: 

"Give me some of that superfluous food."  Now began the so-called "amabilis confusio." Every one 

spoke at once, and every one about a different subject. The Senators 


_
the elephant, the flesh and the ivory had been stolen. The tracks of a great number of men were 

left upon the ground, and the aggageers were fortunate to return without an attack from 

overwhelming numbers.  After hunting and exploring for some days in this neighbourhood, I 

determined to follow the bed of the Royan to its junction with the Settite. We started at daybreak, 

and after a long march along the sandy bed, hemmed in by high banks, or by precipitous cliffs of 

sandstone, we arrived at the junction; this was a curious and frightful spot during the rainy season. 

The entire course of the Royan was extremely rapid, but at this extremity it entered a rocky pass 

between two hills, and leapt in a succession of grand falls into a circular basin of about four 

hundred yards diameter. This peculiar basin was surrounded by high cliffs, covered with trees; to 

the left was an island formed by a rock about sixty feet high; at the foot was a deep and narrow 

gorge through which the Settite river made its exit from the circle. This large river entered the 

basin through a rocky gap, at right angles with the rush of water from the great falls of the Royan, 

and as both streams issued from gorges which accelerated their velocity to the highest degree, 

their junction formed a tremendous whirlpool: thus, the basin which was now dry, with the 

exception of the single contracted stream of the Settite, was in the rainy season a most frightful 

scene of giddy waters. The sides of this basin were, for about fifty feet from the bottom, sheeted 

with white sand that had been left there by the centrifugal force of the revolving waters; the funnel-

shaped reservoir had its the important question of the corpse hanging in the wood; Mrs. 

Mravucsan complained that no one was eating anything, and looked as wretched as she could. 

Each one drank to the other's health, and during the quiet moment that followed, a voice was 

heard:  "Oh, Wladin, Wladin!"  It was Mrs. Szliminszky's voice; she evidently objected to her 

husband drinking, and her neighbor, Mr. Mokry, the lawyer's clerk, objected to her constant 

distractions, in spite of the interesting theme they were discussing.  "That strong cigar will harm 

you, Wladin; you had better put it down. Well, and why did you go to Besztercebanya, Mr. Mokry?" 

"I had a lot to do there, but, above all, I bought the suit I have on."  He looked admiringly at his 

dark blue suit for about the hundredth time that evening.  "It is a very nice suit. What did you pay 

for it?"  "I had it made to measure at Klener's, and went to try it on myself."  "What was the price?" 

"It is real Gacs cloth, and quite impervious to rain; you should see it by daylight!"  "Yes, of course, 

but what did it cost?" asked the Polish lady, her thoughts still occupied with her husband.  "I saw 

the piece of cloth myself; this was the first length cut off it. It has a peculiar look in the sunlight." 

"Yes, yes; but I asked the price of it."  But it was difficult to bring Mokry to think of other things 

when he was once launched on the subject of his new suit.  "Klener has a tailor working for him, a 

certain Kupek, who used to work at one of the court tailors' in Vienna, and he said to me: 'Don't 

grudge the money, Mr. Mokry, for this is such a durable stuff that your own skin will wear out first.' 

Please feel it."  "It's as 


_
depth beneath the mass of rock that formed a barrier before the mouth of the exit. From the 

appearance of the high-water mark upon the rock, it was easy to ascertain the approximate depth 

when the flood was at its maximum. We pitched our camp on the slope above the basin, and for 

several days I explored the bed of the river, which was exceedingly interesting at this dry season, 

when all the secrets of its depths were exposed. In many places, the rocks that choked its bed for 

a depth of thirty and forty feet in the narrow passes, had been worked into caverns by the constant 

attrition of the rolling pebbles. In one portion of the river, the bottom was almost smooth, as though 

it had been paved with flagstones; this was formed by a calcareous sediment from the water, 

which had hardened into stone; in some places this natural pavement had been broken up into 

large slabs by the places with me. You are in a draught there each time the door is opened. What 

are you making such a face for? You surely don't mean to argue with me? Over you come now!" 

The beloved martyr changed places with his wife, and now Mrs. Szliminszky was on the opposite 

side of the table, next to Wibra; but he was entirely taken up with Veronica, who was chattering to 

her heart's content. The clever young man, of whom it was said he would once be the first lawyer 

in Besztercebanya, was listening to the girl with as much attention as though a bishop were 

speaking, and would not for a moment have taken his eyes off her.  They spoke quietly, as though 

they were discussing very important questions, though they were in reality speaking of the most 

innocent things. What did Veronica do at home? She read a good deal, and took long walks. What 

did she read, and where did she walk? And 


_
of the current, where it had been undermined. This cement appeared to be the same that had 

formed the banks of conglomerate, which in some places walled in the river for a depth of ten or 

fifteen feet, with a concrete of rounded pebbles of all sizes from a nutmeg to a thirty-two pound 

shot.  I fired the grass on the west bank of the Royan, and the blaze extended with such rapidity, 

that in a few hours many miles of country were entirely cleared. On the following morning, the 

country looked as though covered with a pall of black velvet.  To my astonishment there were the 

fresh tracks of a rhinoceros within a quarter of a mile of the camp: this animal must have 

concealed itself in the bed of the Royan during the fire, and had wandered forth when it the titles of 

some books. Gyuri had read them all too, and they began exchanging notes regarding some of 

them, such as "Elemer the Eagle," "Ivan Berend," "Aranka Beldi." Gyuri considered Pal Beldi very 

stupid for not accepting the title of prince when it was offered him. Veronica thought it was better 

he had not done so, for if he had, the novel would never have been written.  Then Gyuri began to 

question her about Glogova. Was it very dull? Veronica looked at him, surprised. How could 

Glogova be dull? It was as though some ignorant person had asked if Paris were dull.  "Is there a 

wood there?"  "A beautiful one."  "Do you ever go there?"  "Of course."  "Are you not afraid?" 

"Afraid of what?"  "Well, you know, woods sometimes have inhabitants one 


_
Bacheet and two of my Tookrooris. In less than half a mile from the spot, I found it lying down 

behind a bush, and creeping under cover of an ant-hill, I shot it through the shoulder with a Reilly 

No. 10; it immediately galloped off, but after a run of a couple of hundred yards it lay down on the 

edge of thick thorny jungle that bordered the margin of of."  "Oh, but the inhabitants of our woods 

are more afraid of me than I of them."  "Can any one be afraid of you?"  "Oh, yes they are, 

because I catch them."  "The robbers?"  "Don't be so silly, or I shall be cross!"  "I should like to see 

what you look like when you are cross."  "Well, I shall be if you talk such rubbish again. I catch 

butterflies 


_
expectation that it would shortly die, but it suddenly rose, and walked slowly into the thorns. 

Determined to cut off its retreat, I pushed through the bushes, intending to reach the dry bed of the 

Royan and shoot the rhinoceros as it crossed from the narrow belt of the jungle, into which it had 

retreated; but I had hardly reached half way, when I heard a sound in the bush upon my right, and 

I saw the wounded beast coming straight for our position, but evidently unconscious of our 

presence, as we were to leeward. I immediately crouched down, as did my men likewise, lest the 

animal should observe us. Slowly, the wood."  "Are there pretty butterflies there? I had a collection 

when I was a student; I believe I have it still."  At this a desire for rivalry seized hold of Veronica. 

"You should see my collection," she said. "I have all kinds. Tigers, Admirals, Apollos; only, it is 

such a pity, my Apollo has lost one of its wings."  "Have you a Hebe?"  "Oh, yes, it is nearly as big 

as the palm of my hand."  "And how big is that? Let me see it."  Veronica spread out her hand on 

the table; it was not so very big after all, but fine and pink as a roseleaf. Gyuri took a match and 

began to measure it, and in doing so,
