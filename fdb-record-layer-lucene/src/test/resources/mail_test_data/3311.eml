the rhinoceros lay kicking upon the ground, and I thought he was bagged. No=
t a bit of it! the No. 24=20

bullet had not force to break the massive shoulder bone, but had merely par=
alysed it for the=20

moment; up he jumped and started off in full gallop. Now for a hunt! up the=
 hill he started, then=20

obliquely he chose a regular rhinoceros path, and scudded away, Tetel answe=
ring to the spur and=20

closing with him; through the trees; now down the hill over the loose rocks=
, where he gained=20

considerably upon the horse. 'Easy down the hill, gently over the stones, T=
etel,' and I took a pull at=20

the reins until I reached the level ground beneath, which was firm and firs=
t-rate. I saw the=20

rhinoceros pelting away about a hundred and twenty yards ahead, and spurrin=
g hard, I shot up to=20

him at full speed until within twenty yards, when round he came with astoni=
shing quickness and=20

charged straight at the horse. I was prepared for this, as was my horse als=
o; we avoided him by a=20

quick turn, and again renewed the chase, and regained our position within a=
 few yards of the=20

game. Thus the hunt continued for about a mile and a half, the rhinoceros o=
ccasionally charging,=20

but always cleverly avoided by the horse. Tetel seemed to enjoy the fun, an=
d hunted like a=20

greyhound. Nevertheless I had not been able to pass the rhinoceros, who had=
 thundered along at=20

a tremendous pace whenever I had attempted to close; however, the pace bega=
n to tell upon his=20

wounded shoulder; he evidently went lame, and, as I observed at some distan=
ce before us the=20

commencement of the dark-coloured rotten ground I felt sure that it would s=
hortly be a case of=20

'stand still.' In this I was correct, and, upon reaching the deep and crumb=
ling soil, he turned sharp=20

round, made a clumsy charge that I easily avoided, and he stood panting at =
bedroom, of the other=20

a storeroom.  Veronica was feeling as miserable as she could, and her one w=
ish at that moment=20

was to hear the two gentlemen's conversation, for everything depended on th=
at. Some demon who=20

had evidently never been to school, and had never learned that it was disho=
norable to listen at=20

doors or walls, whispered to her:  "Run quickly, Veronica, into the storero=
om, and if you press your=20

ear to the wall, you will be able to hear what they say."  Off went Veronic=
a like a shot. It is=20

incredible what an amount of honey a demon of that description can put into=
 his words; he was=20

capable of persuading this well-educated girl to take her place among the p=
ickled cucumbers,=20

basins of lard, and sacks of potatoes, in order to listen to a conversation=
 which was not meant for=20

her ears.  Not a sound was to be heard in the storeroom but the dripping of=
 the fat from a side of=20

bacon hanging from the rafters, and which the great heat there was causing =
it to melt. Some of it=20

even fell on her pretty dress, but what did she care for that just then?  "=
So you have found out all=20

about the umbrella," she heard Sztolarik say, "but have you seen it yet?"  =
"Why should I?" asked=20

Gyuri. "I cannot touch its contents till after the wedding."  "Why not soon=
er?"  "Because, for various=20

reasons, I do not wish the story of the umbrella known."  "For instance?"  =
"First of all, because=20

Father Janos would be the laughing-stock of the place."  "Why do you troubl=
e your head about the=20

priest?"  "Secondly, because it would give Veronica reason to think I am on=
ly marrying her for the=20

sake of the umbrella."  "But she will know it later on in any case."  "I sh=
all never tell her."  "Have=20

you any other reasons?"  "Oh, yes. I dare say they would not even give me t=
he check; it is=20

probably not made out=20


_
Gazelle; this was a very timid horse and was utterly useless as a hunter, b=
ut, as it reared and=20

plunged upon seeing the rhinoceros, that animal immediately turned towards =
it with the intention of=20

charging. Riding Tetel close to his flank, I fired both barrels of the litt=
le Fletcher into the shoulder;=20

he fell to the shots, and, stretching out his legs convulsively, he died im=
mediately."  This was a=20

capital termination to the hunt; as I had expected the death of my good hor=
se them that it is mine?=20

It really belongs to the person who has it in his possession. And perhaps t=
hey would not even give=20

me the girl, for if her fortune is as large as we think it, she can find as=
 many husbands as she has=20

fingers on her hands."  Veronica felt giddy. It was as though they were dri=
ving nails into her flesh.=20

She could not quite understand all they were talking about--of umbrellas, r=
eceipts, large fortunes.=20

What fortune? But this much she had begun to understand,=20


_
nearly horned him. The sun was like a furnace, therefore I rode straight to=
 camp, and sent men=20

and camels for the hides and flesh. As I passed the body of the first rhino=
ceros, I found a regiment=20

of vultures already collected around it, while fresh arrivals took place ev=
ery minute, as they=20

gathered from all quarters; they had already torn out the eyes, and dragged=
 a portion of flesh from=20

the bullet-wound in the shoulder; but the tough hide of the rhinoceros was =
proof against their=20

greedy beaks. A number of Marabou storks had also arrived, and were standin=
g proudly among=20

the crowd  "Well, well," began Sztolarik again after a short pause, "the af=
fair seems to be pretty=20

entangled at present, but there is still worse to come."  "What more can co=
me?" asked Gyuri in an=20

uncertain voice.  "Don't do anything at present. Let us find out first of a=
ll whether you love the girl."=20

Poor little Veronica was trembling like a leaf in her hiding-place. She shu=
t her eyes like a criminal=20

before his execution, with a sort of undefined feeling that the blow would =
be less painful so. What=20

would he answer?  "I think I love her," answered Gyuri, again in that uncer=
tain voice. "She=20

posed. Throughout=20

all the countries that I had traversed, these birds were in enormous number=
s. The question has=20

been frequently discussed whether the vulture is directed to his prey by th=
e sense of smell, or by=20

keenness of vision; I have paid much attention to their habits, and, althou=
gh there can be no=20

question that their power of scent is great, I feel  "Of course. But the qu=
estion is, would you in=20

other circumstances have asked her to marry you? Answer frankly!"  "I shoul=
d never have thought=20

of such a thing."  A sob was heard in the next room, and then a noise as th=
ough some pieces of=20

furniture had been thrown down.  Sztolarik listened for a few moments, and =
then, pointing to the=20

wall, asked:  "Do you know what is on the other side?"  "I think it is the =
storeroom."  "I thought I=20
