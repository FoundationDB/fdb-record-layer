dracaena marginata arose to look out upon a stillness like that of eternity=

 their heads, from pearl to silver grew the light, and comparison ended. Th=

Be sure you _are_ in time, Jeremiah!"  "I _will_ be sure!" said Jeremiah, a=
nd left the room.  The moment he closed _
no doubt. Mathilde, moreover, could read a certain kind of history if the p=
rint were large enough.=20

Honora looked in the glass again. Yes, she was beautiful. He had found her =
so, he had told her so.=20

And here was the testimony of her own eyes. The bloom on the nectarines tha=
t came every=20

morning from Mr. Chamberlin's greenhouse could not compare with the colour =
of her cheeks; her=20

hair was like the dusk; her eyes like the blue pools among the rocks, and t=
ouched now by the sun;=20

her neck and arms of the whiteness of sea-foam. It was meet that she should=
 be thus for him and=20

for the love he brought her.  She turned suddenly to the maid.  "Do you lov=
e me, Mathilde?" she=20

asked.  Mathilde was not surprised. She was, on the contrary, profoundly to=
uched.  "How can=20

madame ask?" she cried impulsively, and seized Honora's hand. How was it po=
ssible to be near=20

madame, and not love her?  "And would you go--anywhere with me?"  The scene=
 came back to=20

her in the night watches. For the little maid had wept and vowed eternal fi=
delity.  It was not--until=20

the first faint herald of the morning that Honora could bring herself to pr=
onounce the fateful thing=20

that stood between her and happiness, that threatened to mar the perfection=
 of a heaven-born=20

love --Divorce! And thus, having named it resolutely several times, the dem=
on of salvation began=20

gradually to assume a kindly aspect that at times became almost benign. In =
fact, this one was not=20

a demon at all, but a liberator: the demon, she perceived, stalked behind h=
im, and his name was=20

Notoriety. It was he who would flay her for coquetting with the liberator. =
 What if she were flayed?=20

Once married to Chiltern, once embarked upon that life of usefulness, once =
firmly established on=20

ground of her own tilling, and she was immune. And this led her to a consid=
eration of those she=20

knew who had been flayed. They were not few, and a surfeit of publicity is =
a sufficient reason for=20

not enumerating them here. And during this process of exorcism Notoriety be=
came a bogey, too:=20

he had been powerless to hurt them. It must be true what Chiltern had said =
that the world was=20

changing. The tragic and the ridiculous here joining hands, she remembered =
that Reggie Farwell=20

had told her that he had recently made a trip to western New York to inspec=
t a house he had built=20

for a "remarried" couple who were not wholly unknown. The dove-cote, he had=
 called it. The man,=20

in his former marriage, had been renowned all up and down tidewater as a ra=
ke and a brute, and=20

now it was an assist me in the misfortune which has overtaken me. I have no=
t robbed you=20

systematically; you do me an injustice, as you will learn when the accounta=
nt has gone through=20

the books. I court inquiry--I invite it--I _will_ have it, now that you hav=
e accused me, and I will=20

compel you to admit that I have served you faithfully. My character is dear=
 to me, and I will not=20

allow you to cast suspicion upon it. As for the bracelet, I _did_ believe t=
hat the stones were=20

genuine; and if they _were_ genuine they would have been worth ten times th=
e sum you lent on=20

them. I laugh at the public exposure with which you threaten me. Me it cann=
ot harm; you, it can.=20

For, after all, I am only your servant; you are the principal. That the bus=
iness of the bracelet was=20

introduced to me by a man whose character will not bear investigation is tr=
ue. I did not know this at=20

the time; but what if I did? He did not ask _me_ to lend him the money, he =
asked me to apply to=20

_you_. Is it the first questionable transaction you have been mixed up in? =
Perhaps I could give=20

evidence on that point. It is pretty well known that Miser Farebrother woul=
d do anything for money;=20

if he could sell his soul for it he would not hesitate long. You mustn't mi=
nd my speaking in this way;=20

I have nothing to fear, and I am defending myself."  Miser Farebrother was =
not in the least=20

discomposed by Jeremiah's defence of himself. "Words, Jeremiah, words!" he =
said, with a=20

sneering laugh. "Are you a fool as well as a rogue? What you have said is a=
s so much air, and will=20



not save you from the felon's fate. In everything I have done the law is on=
 my side; I have seen to=20

that. As to what is between us, let matters be settled quickly. You have sa=
ved a little, you say; you=20

have friends who will assist you. Good! By noon to-morrow pay me the money =
you induced me to=20

advance upon the bracelet. If this is not done, at one o'clock I will place=
 it in the hands of the=20

police, with a faithful description of the manner in which it came into my =
possession. The police=20

are looking for you, you shallow knave, and I will set them on your track. =
Then see if you can save=20

yourself. The office accounts will come afterward. If you have stolen, you =
shall repay--with interest,=20

you thief!"  "I will not use abusive words in return," said Jeremiah. "Ther=
e is nothing for which I am=20

to blame, except the bracelet, and I was an innocent victim. You have it, o=
f course?"  "Trust me for=20

that," replied Miser Farebrother; "I have it safe enough. Do you think I ha=
ve been=20

did not have at least one baby on his knee. And he knew, according to Mr. F=
arwell, more about=20

infant diet than the whole staff of a maternity hospital.  At length, as sh=
e stared into the darkness,=20

dissolution came upon it. The sills of her windows outlined themselves, and=
 a blurred foliage was=20

sketched into the frame. With a problem but half solved the day had surpris=
ed her. She marvelled=20

to see that it grew apace, and  "Well, give it to me," said Jeremiah, "and =
before twelve to-morrow=20

morning I will return you the money you advanced on it."  Miser Farebrother=
 burst out into a loud=20

laugh. "Give it to you, Jeremiah, and simply for the asking! You miserable =
knave, do you think I am=20

in my second childhood? No, Jeremiah, no! When you give me back my money yo=
u shall have it--

not till then. Fail in this restitution, and you have but a few=20
