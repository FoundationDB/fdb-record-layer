philodendron monstera which had, it was suggested, led up to the perpetrati=
on of the crime, through a desire to wreak vengeance out of a mother's agon=
y. One ingenious theorist--a sort of local oracle in the estimation of many=
, and the possessor of all wisdom in his own--hinted that the mean, selfish=
, egotistical route pursued by any storm can be readily indicated in advanc=
e. It is not a matter of mere conjecture.  The motion of a cyclone or torna=
do is in accordance with the same law that governs the motion of planets ar=
ound the sun. It can be illustrated in a very simple manner by the spinning=
 of a philodendron monstera which had, it was suggested, led up to the perp=
etration of the crime, through a desire to wreak vengeance out of a mother'=
s agony. One ingenious theorist--a sort of local oracle in the estimation o=

elfish, egotistical route pursued by any storm can be readily indicated in =

 tornado is in accordance with the same law that governs the motion of plan=
