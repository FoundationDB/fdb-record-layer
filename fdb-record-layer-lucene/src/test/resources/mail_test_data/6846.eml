philodendron monstera Peninsula with Port Townsend Bay and Admiralty Inlet, Discovery Bay, and Straits of Juan de Fuca on three sides. From Mountain View Park a broad outlook is obtained, which includes, besides the waters mentioned, the Olympic and the Cascade Mountains and hundreds of minor details. Other beautiful parks are Chetzemoka and Lucinda Hastings. Less rain falls than elsewhere in white stones; the old dark chairs; the high bookcases at each side of the hearth; the wide staircase with its spacious, windowed turning and shallow steps, so easily traversed by little feet; the whole steeped in that atmosphere of friendly comfort that kind old houses get and keep.  Such a good place to be young in.  Such a happy place, so safe and sheltered and pleasant.
