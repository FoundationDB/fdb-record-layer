RICKERT.  The face was noble, but care-worn and weary, as of a man who had =
heavy burdens to=20

bear. Just then, however, he turned towards one of the lads, bending his he=
ad to catch some=20

laughing remark of his, and a smile flashed like sunlight over his features=
, revealing a rare and=20

spiritual beauty unseen by her before. She was satisfied.  Henri, meanwhile=
, was beside himself=20

with excitement. He took off his cap, waved it in the air, then taking adva=
ntage of a momentary=20

pause in the incessant and deafening cries of =E2=80=9CVive Alexandre! Vive=
 l=E2=80=99Empereur de Russie!=E2=80=9D that=20

filled the street, he shouted aloud, in his clear, high-pitched voice, =E2=
=80=9C_Vive l=E2=80=99aide-de-camp de St.=20

Priest!_=E2=80=9D  Cl=C3=A9mence gazed at her brother in amazement =E2=80=
=9CWhat do you mean? Who is the aide-de-

camp de St. Priest?=E2=80=9D she whispered.  =E2=80=9CHe has heard! He unde=
rstands! He is bowing to us!=E2=80=9D cried=20

Henri, without heeding her. =E2=80=9CGod bless him! God grant me one day to=
 tell him what he has done=20

for me. Or, perhaps, _you_ will tell him for me, Cl=C3=A9mence?=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CDear brother, let us come home. This=20

crowd is too much for you,=E2=80=9D said Cl=C3=A9mence in an anxious tone, =
as she saw his rapidly changing=20

colour and the tears that gathered in his eyes.  =E2=80=9CNo; it is all rig=
ht. Thank God I have seen him once=20

again. When they have passed on I will take you home by some quiet way, and=
 tell you why I am=20

so deeply moved.=E2=80=9D  As he spoke they saw Ivan on horseback, amidst t=
he group that followed the=20

Czar. He saluted them; and as he did so his face lighted up until it grew a=
bsolutely radiant with=20

satisfaction. =E2=80=9CI told him,=E2=80=9D whispered Henri, =E2=80=9Cthat =
if he saw you here wearing a coloured dress he=20

might rejoice.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CO Henri!=E2=80=9D cried the horror-strick=
en Cl=C3=A9mence, her face overspread with blushes.=20

=E2=80=9CHow wicked of you! What will he think?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNothing =
about _you_, sister mine. He knows you were=20

not in the plot; so be at rest. Now, let us come away; our work is done.=E2=
=80=9D  They found a quiet way=20

through streets which were little frequented at any time, and that day were=
 absolutely empty.=20

Hitherto Henri had been very silent about the story of his life since they =
parted; about all at least=20

except the last year, which he had spent very comfortably at Vilna, recruit=
ing his health, and=20

enjoying the society of numerous friends amongst the Polish nobility and ge=
ntry, who soon=20

discovered in the young conscript the scion of an old and good family. The =
allowance generously=20

given by the Czar to all the French prisoners sufficed for his moderate wan=
ts;[55] and he had=20

wisely devoted his leisure to study. Thus much he had told to his mother an=
d sister; but the horrors=20

of the Moscow campaign had been studiously avoided. Now, however, as they w=
alked slowly=20

along, Henri told his sister as much as he could tell any one of the =E2=80=
=9Cweltering abysses of trouble=E2=80=9D=20

through which he had passed. He told of the weary hungerings in the snow; o=
f the Berezina=20

agony; of the dazed, half-delirious wanderings over the frozen Polish plain=
; of the bitter, blank=20

despair that settled down upon him at last. He told of the ghastly Vilna ho=
spital, the lowest depth of=20

all; and of the love, divine and human, which met him there and rescued him=
 from the pit of horror.=20

=E2=80=9CMy feet were set in a large place,=E2=80=9D he said; =E2=80=9Cand =
I thanked God and believed in him as I had never=20

done before.=E2=80=9D He added, after a pause, =E2=80=9CAnd Ivan is the ref=
lection of his Czar. Even unconsciously=20

and in the veriest trifles he copies him. Now, Cl=C3=A9mence you know anoth=
er reason why I am not=20

unwilling to trust the dearest of sisters to his keeping.=E2=80=9D  When th=
e blush that passed over the face=20

of Cl=C3=A9mence had subsided a little, she said softly, =E2=80=9CNo doubt =
you pray every day for the Czar. So=20

shall I.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do; but it is hard to know what to ask for hi=
m. Already God has given him everything we=20

are wont to ask for rulers of the earth--dominion, power, glory, wealth, vi=
ctory over his foes.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet=20

ort=E2=80=99s multitudinous=20

questions about the Dresden campaign.  By-and-by, when the soft May twiligh=
