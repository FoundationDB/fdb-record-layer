THE DUKE OF ORLEANS RECEIVES THE DUCHY OF ACQUITAINE, AS A         PRESENT,=
=20

FROM THE KING OF FRANCE.=E2=80=94A TRUCE CONCLUDED         BETWEEN ENGLAND =
AND=20

FRANCE.   At the beginning of this year, the duke of Orleans, by means whic=
h he had long=20

practised, prevailed on his brother, the king of France, to give him the du=
chy of Acquitaine, which=20

he had long been wishing for.  Truces were at this time concluded between t=
he kings of France=20

and England, for one year only, and were proclaimed at the accustomed place=
s. The Flemings=20

were much rejoiced thereat, for they thought that their commerce would now =
be more securely=20

carried on.  Ambassadors from England arrived at Paris from king Henry, the=
 principal of whom=20

was sir Thomas Erpingham, having with him an archdeacon, and several noblem=
en. He was=20

presented to the king by Tassin de Servillers, and required in marriage one=
 of the princesses, a=20

nun at Poissy, for the prince of Wales, eldest son to king Henry. But as th=
ey demanded too great=20

concessions with the princess, they returned without success. The lord de H=
angest, whom the=20

king had lately for his merit made master of the cross-bows, escorted them =
as far as Boulogne-

sur-mer[106].                                   CHAP. XXXV.      THE PRINCE=
 OF WALES[107],=20

ACCOMPANIED BY HIS TWO UNCLES,         MARCHES A CONSIDERABLE FORCE TO WAGE=
=20

WAR AGAINST THE         SCOTS.   The prince of Wales, son to king Henry, as=
sembled, about=20

the feast of All-saints, one thousand men at arms and six thousand archers,=
 to make an incursion=20

into Scotland. His uncles, the dukes of York and Somerset, and the lords Mo=
rtimer, R=C3=B4s, Cornwall,=20

and many other nobles attended him.  Their object was to retaliate on the S=
cots, who had lately=20

broken the truce, and done much mischief with fire and sword in the duchy o=
f Lancaster. They=20

entered Scotland, and committed great carnage wherever they passed; for the=
 Scots were quite=20

unprepared to receive them, nor had they any intelligence of their coming u=
ntil they were in the=20

midst of their country.  When news of this invasion was brought to the king=
 of Scotland, he was at=20

his town of St Jangon[108], in the center of his realm. He assembled in has=
te his nobles, and as=20

large a force as could be collected on so short notice, which he sent under=
 the command of the=20

earls of Douglas and Buchan, with his constable, to meet the English and co=
mbat them, should=20

they think it advisable. When they were within six leagues of the enemy, th=
ey were informed, that=20

the English were far superior in numbers, and they adopted other measures. =
They sent=20

ambassadors to the prince of Wales to treat of peace, and they managed so w=
ell that the truce=20

was renewed for one year.  The prince of Wales, having done great mischief =
to Scotland, returned=20

to England; and the Scots disbanded their army.                            =
       CHAP. XXXVI.      THE=20

DUKE OF ORLEANS, ONLY BROTHER TO CHARLES VI. THE         WELL-BELOVED, KING=
 OF=20

FRANCE, IS INHUMANLY ASSASSINATED         IN THE TOWN OF PARIS.   This year=
 there=20

happened the most melancholy event in the town of Paris that had ever befal=
len the Christian=20

kingdom of France by the death of a single man. It occasioned the utmost gr=
ief to the king and the=20

princes of the blood, as well as to the kingdom in general, and was the cau=
se of most disastrous=20

quarrels between them, which lasted a very long time, insomuch that the kin=
gdom was nearly=20

ruined and overturned, as will more plainly be shewn in the continuation of=
 this history.  This event=20

was nothing less than the murder of the duke of Orleans, only brother to Ch=
arles the well-beloved,=20

king of France.  The duke was, on a Wednesday, the feast-day of pope St Cle=
ment, assassinated=20

in Paris, about seven o=E2=80=99clock in the evening, on his return from di=
nner. This murder was committed=20

by about eighteen men, who had lodged at an h=C3=B4tel having for sign the =
image of our Lady, near=20



the Porte Barbette, and who, it was afterward discovered, had for several d=
ays intended this=20

assassination.  On the Wednesday before mentioned, they sent one named Scas=
 de Courteheuze,=20

valet de chambre to the king, and one of their accomplices, to the duke of =
Orleans, who had gone=20

to visit the queen of France at an h=C3=B4tel which she had lately purchase=
d from Montagu, grand=20

master of the king=E2=80=99s household, situated very near the Porte Barbet=
te. She had lain in there of a=20

child, which had died shortly after its birth, and had not then accomplishe=
d the days of her=20

purification.  Scas, on his seeing the duke, said, by way of deceiving him,=
 =E2=80=98My lord, the king sends=20

for you, and you must instantly hasten to him, for he has business of great=
 importance to you and=20

him, which he must communicate to you.=E2=80=99 The duke, on hearing this m=
essage, was eager to obey=20

the king=E2=80=99s orders, although the monarch knew nothing of the matter,=
 and immediately mounted his=20

mule, attended by two esquires on one horse, and four or five valets on foo=
t, who followed behind=20

bearing torches; but his other attendants made no haste to follow him. He h=
ad made this visit in a=20

private manner, notwithstanding at this time he had within the city of Pari=
s six hundred knights and=20

esquires of his retinue, and at his expense.  On his arrival at the Porte B=
arbette, the eighteen men,=20

all well and secretly armed, were waiting for him, and were lying in ambush=
, under shelter of a=20

pent-house. The night was pretty dark; and as they sallied out against him,=
 one cried out, =E2=80=98Put him=20

to death!=E2=80=99 and gave him such a blow on the wrist with his battle-ax=
e as severed it from his arm.=20

The duke, astonished at this attack, cried out, =E2=80=98I am the duke of O=
rleans!=E2=80=99 when the assassins,=20

continuing their blows, answered, =E2=80=98You are the person we were looki=
ng for.=E2=80=99 So many rushed on=20

him that he was struck off his mule, and his skull was split that his brain=
s were dashed on the=20

pavement. They turned him over and over, and massacred him that he was very=
 soon completely=20

dead. A young esquire, a German by birth, who had been his page, was murder=
ed with him:=20

seeing his master struck to the ground, he threw himself on his body to pro=
tect him, but in vain,=20

and he suffered for his generous courage. The horse which carried the two e=
squires that preceded=20

the duke, seeing so many armed men advance, began to snort, and when he had=
 passed them set=20

out on a gallop, so that it was some time before he could be checked.  When=
 the esquires had=20

stopped their horse, they saw their lord=E2=80=99s mule following them full=
 gallop: having caught him, they=20

fancied the duke must have fallen, and were bringing it back by the bridle;=
 but on their arrival=20

where their lord lay, they were menaced by the assassins, that if they did =
not instantly depart, they=20

should share his fate. Seeing their lord had been thus basely murdered, the=
y hastened to the h=C3=B4tel=20

of the queen, crying out,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Murder!=E2=80=99  Those who had =
killed the duke, in their turn, bawled out,=20

=E2=80=98Fire!=E2=80=99 and they had arranged their plan, that while some w=
ere assassinating the duke, others were=20

to set fire to their lodgings. Some mounted on horseback, and the rest on f=
oot, made off as fast as=20

they could, throwing behind them broken glass and sharp points of iron to p=
revent their being=20

pursued.  Report said, that many of them went the back way to the h=C3=B4te=
l d=E2=80=99Artois, to their master=20

the duke of Burgundy, who had commanded them to do this deed, as he afterwa=
rd publicly=20

confessed, to inform him of the success of their murder,=E2=80=94when insta=
ntly afterward they withdrew=20

to places of safety.  The chief of these assassins, and the conductor of th=
e business, was one=20

called Rollet d=E2=80=99Auctonville[109], a Norman, whom the duke of Orlean=
s had, a little before, deprived=20

of his office of commissioner of taxes, which the king had given to him, at=
 the request of the late=20

duke of Burgundy. From that time, the said Rollet had been considering how =
he could revenge=20

himself on the duke of Orleans. His other accomplices were William Courtehe=
uze and Scas=20



Courteheuze, before mentioned, from the county of Guines, John de la Motte =
and others, to the=20

amount of eighteen.  Within half an hour, the household of the duke of Orle=
ans, hearing of this=20

horrid murder, made loud complaints, and, with great crowds of nobles and o=
thers, hastened to=20

the fatal spot, where they found him lying dead in the street. His knights =
and esquires, and in=20

general all his dependants, made grievous lamentations, seeing him thus wou=
nded and disfigured.=20

With many groans, they raised the body, and carried it to the h=C3=B4tel of=
 the lord de Rieux, marshal of=20

France, which was hard by; and shortly afterward, the body was covered with=
 a white pall, and=20

conveyed most honourably to the church of the Guillemins[110], where it lay=
, as being the nearest=20

church to where the murder had been committed.  Soon afterward, the king of=
 Sicily, and many=20

other princes, knights and esquires, having heard of this foul murder of th=
e only brother of the king=20

of France, came with many tears to visit the body. It was put into a leaden=
 coffin, and the monks of=20

the church, with all the late duke=E2=80=99s household, watched it all nigh=
t, saying prayers, and singing=20

psalms over it.  On the morrow, his servants found the hand which had been =
cut off, and collected=20

much of the brains that had been scattered over the street,=E2=80=94all of =
which were inclosed in a leaden=20

case and placed by the coffin.  The whole of the princes who were in Paris,=
 except the king and=20

his children, namely, the king of Sicily, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and =
Bourbon, the marquis du=20

Pont, the counts de Nevers, de Clermont, de Vend=C3=B4me, de St Pol, de Dam=
martin, the constable of=20

France and several others, having assembled, with a large body of the clerg=
y and nobles, and a=20

multitude of the citizens of Paris, went the temperature of the body has be=
en known to rise as high=20

as 104=C2=B0 F. and remain so for a time. Again, it has been observed that =
when death has taken place=20

suddenly, as from accident, apoplexy, or acute disease, the body retains it=
s heat for a long time.=20

The bodies of persons dying from hanging, electrocution, suffocation, or po=
isoning by carbon=20

dioxide, do not generally cool for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, a=
nd cases are recorded=20

where three days have elapsed before the body was completely cold. On the o=
ther hand, bodies=20

dead from chronic wasting diseases or severe hemorrhage cool very rapidly, =
even in four or five=20

hours.  In determining the temperature of a dead body the hand is not a rel=
iable guide: the=20

thermometer should always be used.   FLACCIDITY.  The first effect of death=
 from any cause is=20

general relaxation of the entire muscular system. The lower jaw drops, the =
eyelids lose their=20

tension, the limbs are flabby and soft, and the joints become flexible.  In=
 from five to six hours after=20

death, and generally while the body is in the act of cooling, the muscles o=
f the limbs are observed=20

to become hard and contracted, the joints stiff, and the body unyielding. M=
uscles which are=20

contracted in the death-agony do not necessarily become relaxed at any time=
.  The muscular=20

tissues in the dead body can be considered as passing through three stages:=
 (1) flaccid but=20

contractile, (2) rigid and incapable of contraction, (3) relaxed and incapa=
ble of further contractility.=20

RIGOR MORTIS.  This is sometimes called cadaveric rigidity and occurs gener=
ally within six hours=20

after death and disappears within sixteen to twenty-four hours. Many theori=
es have been=20

advanced to account for it, but the most probable one is that the rigidity =
is due to the coagulation=20

of the myosin in the muscles by the weak acids which are no longer removed =
from the system; the=20

muscles always give an acid reaction and are opaque instead of transparent;=
 after putrefaction=20

has set in ammonia is developed, the myosin dissolved, and so flaccidity re=
sults.  Rigor mortis=20

occurs first in the muscles of the eyelid, next the muscles of the lower ja=
w and neck are affected,=20

then the chest and upper extremities; afterward it gradually progresses fro=
m above downward,=20



affecting the muscles of the abdomen and lower limbs. The rigidity disappea=
rs in the same=20

sequence. The period after death when rigor mortis manifests itself, togeth=
er with its duration, is=20

chiefly dependent upon the previous degree of muscular exhaustion. Brown-S=
=C3=A9quard has=20

demonstrated that the greater the degree of muscular irritability at the ti=
me of death, the later the=20

cadaveric rigidity sets in and the longer it lasts. He has also shown that =
the later putrefaction sets=20

in, the more slowly it progresses.  The more robust the individual and the =
shorter the disease, the=20

more marked and persistent is this muscular rigidity. It has been noticed t=
hat the bodies of soldiers=20

killed in the beginning of an engagement become rigid slowly, and those kil=
led late quickly. This=20

explains the reason why bodies are sometimes found on the battle-field in a=
 kneeling or sitting=20

posture with weapons in hand.  If the rigidity of rigor mortis after it is =
once complete is overcome,=20

as in bending an arm, it never returns; but if incomplete it may return. Th=
is will serve at times to=20

distinguish real death from catalepsy and its allied conditions. While the =
_average_ duration of=20

rigor mortis has been given as sixteen to twenty-four hours, it must be rem=
embered that in some=20

cases it has been known to last only a few hours, as in death by lightning =
or by electrocution. In=20

other cases it has persisted for seven and fourteen days.  This long contin=
uance of rigor mortis=20

has been noted in death from strychnine and other spinal poisons, in suffoc=
ation, and in poisoning=20

by veratrum viride.  Atmospheric conditions modify to a large extent the du=
ration of rigor mortis.=20

Dry, cold air causes it to last for a long time, while warm, moist air shor=
tens its duration. Also=20

immersion in cold water brings on rigor mortis quickly and lengthens its du=
ration.   CADAVERIC=20

ECCHYMOSIS=E2=80=94CADAVERIC LIVIDITY OR HYPOSTASIS.  Within a few hours af=
ter death the=20

skin of the body, which is of a pale, ashy-gray color, becomes covered by e=
xtensive patches of a=20

bluish or purple color, which are most pronounced and are first seen on the=
 back part of the trunk,=20

head extremities, ears, face, and neck, and are due to the blood, before co=
agulating, settling in the=20

most dependent parts of the body, producing a mottling of the surface with =
irregular livid patches.=20

There is also a stagnation of blood in the capillary vessels, especially in=
 those in the upper layer of=20

the true skin or in the space between the cuticle and cutis. The discolorat=
ion continues to increase=20

until the body is cold, when it is entirely arrested. Later on, just before=
 putrefaction begins, the=20

color deepens, and the change appears to proceed from an infiltration of bl=
ood pigment into the=20

dependent parts of the body.  At the same time the discolorations are appea=
ring on the surface of=20

the body, _internal hypostasis_ is also taking place, most marked in the de=
pendent portions of the=20

brain, lungs, intestines, kidneys, and spinal cord.  This condition in the =
brain may be mistaken for=20

so-called congestive apoplexy; in the lungs, for pulmonary apoplexy or the =
first stage of lobar=20

pneumonia; in the intestines and spinal meninges, for the beginning of infl=
ammatory changes.=20

The position of these hypostases will afford the best correction for this p=
ossible error. The=20

appearances presented by cadaveric ecchymoses have often been mistaken for =
the effects of=20

violence applied during life. Innocent persons have been accused and tried =
for murder or=20

manslaughter on charges afterward proved to be groundless. Therefore it is =
of the utmost=20

importance that the medical jurist should be able to distinguish between an=
te-mortem and post-

mortem ecchymoses.  The following are the points of difference:  1. Situati=
on. Post-mortem=20

ecchymoses are seen on that portion of the body which has been most depende=
nt, generally the=20

posterior aspect, and they involve principally the superficial layers of th=
e true skin; ante-mortem=20

ecchymoses may occur anywhere, and generally the deeper tissues are discolo=
red.  2. In=20



cadaveric lividity there is no elevation of the skin and the discoloration =
terminates abruptly.  3.=20

After cutting into the tissues where an ecchymosis has been produced by vio=
lence, the blood=20

without the vessels is free in the tissue; this is not so in cadaveric ecch=
ymosis.  4. Post-mortem=20

ecchymoses are very extensive, ante-mortem generally limited in area.  A pe=
culiar appearance of=20

cadaveric lividity is observed in bodies which have been wrapped in a sheet=
 and allowed to cool or=20

that have cooled in their clothing. It occurs in the form of bands or strip=
es over the whole surface,=20

and often gives an appearance as of a person flogged. The explanation of th=
is appearance is that=20

the congestion of the vessels takes place in the interstices of the folds, =
while the parts=20

compressed remain whole. The unbroken condition of the cuticle, together wi=
th the other=20

characteristics just mentioned, are sufficient to distinguish these ecchymo=
ses from those produced=20

by violence. While cadaveric lividity is seen in all bodies after death, it=
 is especially pronounced in=20

those persons who have died suddenly in full health or by violence, as from=
 apoplexy, hanging,=20

drowning, or suffocation. It is very slight in the bodies of those who have=
 died from hemorrhage or=20

an=C3=A6mia.  The time at which cadaveric lividity appears varies greatly. =
Casper, who has=20

investigated the subject thoroughly, sets the time at from twelve to fiftee=
n hours after death.=20

PUTREFACTION.  At a period varying from a few hours to three days after dea=
th, certain changes=20

are seen in the human body which show that putrefaction has commenced. A ch=
ange of color=20

appears first upon the middle of the abdomen and gradually spreads over the=
 rest of the body; it is=20

first pale green, which gradually deepens, and finally becomes purplish or =
brown. This change in=20

color is due to the action on the h=C3=A6moglobin of the gases developed by=
 decomposition. Similar=20

discoloration makes its appearance on the chest, between the ribs, on the f=
ace, the neck, the legs,=20

and lastly on the arms, where it is more marked along the large venous trun=
ks, and has=20

sometimes been mistaken for marks of violence. The eyeballs become flaccid,=
 and if exposed to=20

the air the conjunctiva and cornea become dry and brown. Gases are formed, =
not only in the=20

hollow organs of the abdomen but also in the skin. Those developed in the c=
avities of the head=20

and face force frothy, reddish fluid or mucus from the mouth and nostrils, =
and may cause swelling=20

of the features and protrusion of the eyes and tongue. It must be remembere=
d that the gases while=20

producing distention of the abdomen may also cause changes in the position =
of the blood and=20

slight displacement of the organs; they may also force undigested food into=
 the mouth and into the=20

larynx, and so lead to suspicion of death from suffocation.  As putrefactio=
n advances, after a=20

period of five or six days the entire surface of the body becomes green or =
brown, the cuticle=20

becomes loose and easily detached; the tissues flaccid and often bathed in =
a reddish serum in=20

such situations as the neck, the groin, and the back part of the scalp. The=
 thorax and abdomen=20

become enormously distended, the features distorted and scarcely recognizab=
le, and the hair and=20

nails loosened. Beyond this, it is impossible to follow the changes leading=
 to disintegration with=20

any degree of certainty. The changes which I have=20


_
of the Guillemins. Then the principal officers of the late duke=E2=80=99s h=
ousehold took the body, and bore=20

it out of the church with a great number of lighted torches carried by the =
esquires of the defunct.=20

On each side of the body were, in due order, uttering groans and shedding t=
ears, the king of Sicily,=20

the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Bourbon, each holding a corner of the pall=
.  After the body=20

followed the other princes, the clergy and barons, according to their rank,=
 recommending his soul=20

to his Creator,=E2=80=94and thus they proceeded with it to the church of th=
e Celestins. When a most=20

solemn service had been performed, the body was interred in a beautiful cha=
pel he himself had=20

founded and built. After the service, all the princes, and others who had a=
ttended it, returned to=20

their homes.  Many suspicions were formed, as to the authors of this assass=
ination of the duke of=20

Orleans; and at first it was thought to have been perpetrated by sir Aubert=
 de Canny, from the=20

great hatred he bore the duke, for having carried off his wife[111], by who=
m he had a son, of=20

whom, and his education, I shall say more hereafter. The truth was soon kno=
wn who were the=20

guilty persons, and that sir Aubert was perfectly innocent of the crime.  T=
he queen Isabella was so=20

much alarmed the day she heard of this murder being committed thus near her=
 h=C3=B4tel, that,=20

although she was not recovered from her lying in, she had herself carried b=
y her brother Louis of=20

Bavaria, and others, to a litter, and thence conveyed to the h=C3=B4tel de =
St Pol, where she was lodged=20

in the adjoining chamber to that of the king, for her greater security.  Th=
e night this murder was=20

committed the count de St Pol and many others of the nobility armed themsel=
ves, and went to the=20

h=C3=B4tel de St Pol, where the king resided, not knowing how far these mat=
ters might be carried.=20

When the body of the duke of Orleans had been interred, as has been related=
, the princes of the=20

blood assembled at the h=C3=B4tel of the king ones seen in a body exposed t=
o the air at a moderate=20

temperature, but it must be remembered that the time and rapidity of the de=
velopment of these=20

changes may be influenced by a large number of factors, and that they are o=
f very little importance=20

in estimating the time of death. I have seen bodies buried two months that =
have shown fewer of=20

the changes produced by putrefaction than others dead but a week.  The appe=
arance of a body=20

buried in a coffin will be as follows after a period varying from a few mon=
ths to one or two years.=20

The soft tissues will have become dry and brown and the face and limbs cove=
red with a soft white=20

fungus. Hard white crystalline deposits of calcium phosphate will be found =
on the surface of the=20

soft organs, and when found on the surface of the stomach care should be ta=
ken not to confound=20

them with the effects of poison. In time the viscera become so mixed togeth=
er that it is difficult to=20

distinguish them. For the most part the changes that take place in a body b=
uried in a coffin are=20

similar, but much slower, to those that occur if the body is exposed to the=
 air or buried in soil. Even=20

under apparently identical circumstances the most varied results have been =
observed, so it is not=20

possible for a medical jurist to fix a definite period of death or the time=
 of burial from the=20

appearance of an exhumed body. For example, Taylor records a case where aft=
er thirty-four=20

years=E2=80=99 interment an entire and perfect skeleton was discovered, sur=
rounded by traces of shroud=20

and coffin, while in an adjoining grave all that remained of a body that ha=
d been dead twenty-five=20

years were the long bones and base of the skull, In one case a body was fou=
nd well preserved=20

after six years=E2=80=99 burial and in another after even thirty years=E2=
=80=99 interment.  This brings us next to a=20

consideration of those factors that favor or retard decomposition.   CIRCUM=
STANCES=20

FAVORING PUTREFACTION.  1. =3DTemperature.=3D=E2=80=94Putrefaction advances=
 most rapidly at a=20


_
Sicily, with the council of state, whither the provost of Paris and others =
of the king=E2=80=99s lawyers were=20

summoned, and ordered by the princes to make the most diligent inquiries, b=
y every possible=20

means, after the perpetrators and accomplices of this base act. All the gat=
es of Paris were=20

commanded to be closed, except two, and those to be well guarded, that all =
who might pass them=20

should be known.  Having given these orders, the lords and the council reti=
red to their h=C3=B4tels in=20

much sorrow and grief. On the morrow, the council was again assembled at th=
e king=E2=80=99s palace of St=20

Pol, in the presence of the king of Sicily, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy an=
d Bourbon, and other=20

great lords. On the entrance of the provost of Paris, he was asked by the d=
uke of Berry what=20

measures he had taken to discover the murderers of so great a prince as the=
 king=E2=80=99s brother. The=20

provost replied, that he had used all diligence in his researches, but in v=
ain,=E2=80=94adding, that if the=20

king and the great lords present would permit him to search their h=C3=B4te=
ls, and those of other great=20

lords in Paris, he made no doubt but that he should discover the murderers =
and their accomplices.=20

The king of Sicily, and the dukes of Berry and Bourbon, gave him instant or=
ders to search=20

wherever he pleased.  The duke of Burgundy, hearing such positive orders gi=
ven, began to be=20

alarmed, and, drawing king Louis and his uncle, the duke of Berry, aside, b=
riefly[112] confessed to=20

them what he had done, saying, that by the temptation of the devil he had c=
ommitted the murder=20

by means of Auctonville and his accomplices[113]. The two princes were so m=
uch astonished and=20

grieved at this confession that they were scarcely enabled to make him any =
reply, but what they=20

did say was reproving him bitterly for having committed so base an act agai=
nst his cousin-

german[114].  After this confession of the duke of Burgundy, they returned =
to the council-chamber,=20

but did not immediately declare what had passed between them,=E2=80=94when =
the council broke up, and=20

all retired to their h=C3=B4tels.  On the ensuing day, which was Saturday, =
the lords before mentioned=20

again assembled at ten o=E2=80=99clock in the morning, at the h=C3=B4tel de=
 Neelle, where the duke of Berry=20

resided, to hold another council. The duke of Burgundy came thither as usua=
l, attended by the=20

count Waleran de St Pol; but when he was about to enter the council-chamber=
, the duke of Berry=20

said to him, =E2=80=98Fair nephew, do not now enter the council-chamber, fo=
r it is displeasing to all the=20

members that you should come among them.=E2=80=99 On saying this, the duke =
of Berry re-entered the=20

council-chamber, ordering the door to be closed, according to the resolutio=
ns of the council.  The=20

duke of Burgundy was greatly confused at this,=E2=80=94and being unresolved=
 how to proceed, said to the=20

count de St Pol, =E2=80=98Good cousin, what should I do?=E2=80=99 The count=
 replied, =E2=80=98My lord, you have only to=20

return to your h=C3=B4tel, since it is not agreeable to the lords of the co=
uncil that you should sit among=20

them.=E2=80=99 The duke said, =E2=80=98Good cousin, return with me, to bear=
 me company;=E2=80=99 but the count=20

answered, =E2=80=98My lord, you must excuse me; for I shall go to the counc=
il, since I have been=20

summoned to attend it.=E2=80=99  After these words, the duke of Burgundy, i=
n great fear, returned to his=20

h=C3=B4tel of Artois; and to avoid being arrested, on his arrival there, he=
 mounted a fresh horse, and,=20

attended by six men, hastily quitted Paris by the gate of Saint Denis,=E2=
=80=94and only changing horses,=20

but not stopping at any place, he travelled onwards until he reached his ca=
stle of Bapaume. When=20

he had slept some little, he again continued his route with all speed to Li=
lle in Flanders. Those=20

whom he had left in his h=C3=B4tel at Paris followed him as speedily as the=
y could, to avoid being=20

imprisoned, of which they were greatly afraid.  In like manner, Rollet d=E2=
=80=99Auctonville and his=20

accomplices changed their clothes, and disguised between 70=C2=B0 and 100=
=C2=B0 F. It may commence at=20

any temperature above 50=C2=B0 F., but it is wholly arrested at 32=C2=B0 F.=
 So one day=E2=80=99s exposure of a body=20



in summer may effect greater changes than one week in winter. After freezin=
g, putrefaction takes=20

place with unusual rapidity upon the thawing out of the body. A temperature=
 of 212=C2=B0 F. stops all=20

putrefactive changes.  2. =3DMoisture.=3D=E2=80=94Putrefaction takes place =
only in the presence of moisture.=20

An excess of moisture, however, seems to retard the process, possibly by cu=
tting off the excess of=20

air. The viscera according to the amount of water they contain decompose at=
 different times after=20

death=E2=80=94for instance, the brain and eye rapidly, the bones and hair s=
lowly.  3. =3DAir.=3D=E2=80=94Exposure to=20

air favors decomposition by carrying to the body the micro-organisms which =
bring about=20

putrefaction; absence of air soon arrests the changes: this is seen in bodi=
es hermetically sealed in=20

lead coffins, which remain unchanged for a long period of time. Moist rathe=
r than dry air favors=20

putrefaction by lessening evaporation. Air in motion retards while still ai=
r favors the change.  It is to=20

be remembered that a body decomposes more rapidly in air than in water or a=
fter burial. Given=20

similar temperatures, the amount of putrefaction observed in a body dead on=
e week and exposed=20

to the air will about correspond to one submerged in water for two weeks or=
 buried in a deep grave=20

for eight weeks.  4. =3DAge.=3D=E2=80=94The bodies of children decompose mu=
ch more rapidly than those of=20

adults; f=C5=93tuses still more rapidly. Aged bodies decompose slowly, prob=
ably on account of a=20

deficiency of moisture. Fat and flabby bodies decompose quickly for the sam=
e reason.  5. =3DCause=20

of Death.=3D=E2=80=94In cases of sudden death, as from accident or violence=
, the body decomposes more=20

rapidly than when death results from disease. Putrefaction sets in early in=
 death from the=20

infectious fevers, such as typhus, py=C3=A6mia, and typhoid fever, also in =
death from suffocation by=20

smoke or coal gas, by strangulation or after narcotic poisoning. Those part=
s of a body which are=20

the seat of bruises, wounds, or fractures, decompose rapidly; this is espec=
ially seen in parts after=20

a surgical operation.  6. =3DManner of Burial.=3D=E2=80=94When a body is bu=
ried in low ground in a damp,=20

swampy, clay soil, decomposition advances rapidly, as also when the grave i=
s shallow so the body=20

can be exposed to constant variations of temperature. A porous soil impregn=
ated with animal and=20

vegetable matter favors putrefaction, as also burying a body without clothe=
s or coffin; this is=20

especially seen where infants have been thrown into the ground and loosely =
covered with earth.=20

CIRCUMSTANCES RETARDING PUTREFACTION.  1. =3DThe Temperature.=3D=E2=80=94Be=
low 32=C2=B0 F. and=20

above 212=C2=B0 F. putrefaction is entirely arrested. The rapidity of the c=
hange considerably lessens as=20

the temperature advances above 100=C2=B0 F. A remarkable instance of the pr=
eservative power of cold=20

is given by Adolph Erman, who states that the body of Prince Menschikoff, a=
 favorite of Peter the=20

Great, exhumed after ninety-two years=E2=80=99 burial in frozen soil, had u=
ndergone hardly any change.=20

Buried in hot sand as is seen in the desert, a body putrefies very slowly a=
nd generally becomes=20

mummified.  2. =3DMoisture.=3D=E2=80=94Absence of moisture retards decompos=
ition. In the dry air of the=20

desert bodies have been preserved for a long period of time.  3. =3DAir.=3D=
=E2=80=94If access of air to a body=20

be prevented in any way by its inclosure in a coffin, by closely fitting cl=
othes, or by complete=20

immersion in water, putrefaction is retarded.  4. =3DAge.=3D=E2=80=94Adults=
 and old people decompose more=20

slowly than children. Males are said to change less rapidly than females, l=
ean people than fleshy=20

ones.  5. =3DCause of Death.=3D=E2=80=94Putrefaction is delayed after death=
 from chronic diseases unless=20

they are associated with dropsy. Poisoning by alcohol, chloroform, strychni=
ne, and arsenic retard=20


_
ways, and went to quarter themselves in the castle of Lens in Artois, by or=
ders of their lord and=20

master John duke of Burgundy.  With so mean an attendance did this duke qui=
t Paris, after the=20

death of the duke of Orleans, leaving the great lords of France in the utmo=
st tribulation and=20

distress.  When those of the household of the late duke of Orleans heard of=
 the secret departure of=20

the duke of Burgundy, they armed themselves, to the amount of six score, ha=
ving at their head sir=20

Clugnet de Brabant, and, mounting their horses, sallied out of Paris in pur=
suit of the duke of=20

Burgundy, with the intent of putting him to death, could they overtake him.=
 The king of Sicily,=20

learning their intentions, sent after to forbid them executing their plan,=
=E2=80=94on which they returned,=20

very indignant, to their h=C3=B4tels.  It was now publicly known throughout=
 Paris that the duke of=20

Burgundy had committed this murder; but the Parisians were not well pleased=
 with the duke of=20

Orleans, for they had learnt that he was the author of all the heavy taxes =
that oppressed them, and=20

began to say among themselves in secret, =E2=80=98The knotty stick is smoot=
hed.=E2=80=99  This melancholy event=20

took place in the great winter of the year 1407, when the frost lasted for =
sixty-six days with the=20

greatest severity. On the thaw, the new bridge at Paris was destroyed, and =
fell into the Seine; and=20

the floods did very great mischief to many parts of the kingdom of France. =
 I have no need, in this=20

chapter, to speak of the great hatred and jealousy that had taken place bet=
ween the dukes of=20

Orleans and Burgundy, prior to the death of the former, as it would occupy =
too much room; and=20

besides, they will be fully spoken of in the proceedings which were shortly=
 afterward=20

instituted,=E2=80=94namely, in the justification which the duke of Burgundy=
 proposed offering publicly, in=20

case the putrefactive changes seem to stop after they have once commenced, =
and often a result=20

very similar to mummification is seen. Death from the mineral acids, especi=
ally sulphuric, appears=20

to delay putrefaction.  6. =3DManner of Burial.=3D=E2=80=94Putrefaction is =
retarded by burial a short time after=20

death; by interment on high ground, in dry, sandy, or gravelly soil; by hav=
ing the grave deep, over=20

six feet in depth if possible by the body being well wrapped and secured in=
 a tight coffin, a lead=20

one being the best in this respect. Lime or charcoal applied freely about a=
 body will retard=20

decomposition, as will also injection of the body through the arteries with=
 such substances as=20

arsenic, chloride of zinc, or antimony. The ultimate effect of putrefaction=
 is to reduce all bodies to=20

inorganic compounds, chiefly water, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. Three cond=
itions are=20

necessary for its establishment, (1) a given temperature, (2) moisture, (3)=
 free access of air.  The=20

order in which the various organs and tissues undergo decomposition, as giv=
en by Casper, who=20

has investigated the subject carefully, is as follows: Trachea and larynx, =
brain of infants, stomach=20

and intestines, spleen, omentum and mesentery, liver, brain of adults, hear=
t and lungs, kidney,=20

bladder and =C5=93sophagus, pancreas, large vessels, and last of all the ut=
erus.  As the result of=20

putrefaction, fluids, generally blood-stained, collect in the serous caviti=
es of the body, and should=20

not be confounded with serous effusions occurring during life. So also the =
softening of the organs=20

and tissue resulting from decomposition should be carefully distinguished f=
rom those resulting=20

from inflammation. These cadaveric softenings are most frequently found in =
the brain, spleen, and=20

gastro-intestinal mucous membrane. Inflammatory softenings are differentiat=
ed=20


_
princes of the blood, the nobility, both ecclesiastical and secular, shewin=
g the causes why he=20

openly avowed being the author of the death of the duke of Orleans, and lik=
ewise from the=20

answers which the dowager-duchess of Orleans and her children made in excul=
pation of the late=20

duke,=E2=80=94which shall all be written in this present chronicle exactly =
in the manner in which they were=20

proposed in the presence of the whole royal council, and the substance of t=
he inflamed part being=20

infiltrated with serum or pus and showing traces of vascular injection. In =
doubtful cases the=20

pathologist should have recourse to the microscope.  As the result of putre=
faction, various=20

changes take place in the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines whi=
ch simulate the=20

effects of poisons. The color of the stomach varies from red, which becomes=
 brighter on exposure=20

to the air, to a brown,=20
