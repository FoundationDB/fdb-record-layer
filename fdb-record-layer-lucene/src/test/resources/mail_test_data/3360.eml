of miles away from me. He was a king's son in Babylon, commanding the court-musicians to make 

sweet discourse for him. He was Saul harkening to David. He was a dreamy-eyed Pict listening to 

music wafted at dusk from a Roman camp about which helmeted sentries paced. He was a 

medieval prince, falsely imprisoned, leaning from dark and lonely towers to catch the strains of 

some wandering troubadour from his native Southlands. He was a Magyar chieftain listening to the 

mountain-side music of valleyed goat-herders with a touch of madness to it. It engulfed him and 

entranced him and awoke ancestral tom-toms in his blood. And I waited beside him until the 

afternoon sunlight grew thinner and paler and my legs grew tired, for I knew that his hungry little 

soul was being fed. His eye met mine, when it was all over, but he had nothing to say. I could see, 

however, that he had been stirred to the depths,--and by a tin mouth-organ and a greasy-sided 

guitar!  To-night I found Dinkie poring over the pictures in my Knight edition of Shakespeare. He 

seemed especially impressed, as I stopped and looked over his shoulder, by a steel engraving of 

Gerome's _Death of Caesar_, where the murdered emperor lies stretched out on the floor of the 

Forum, now all but empty, with the last of the Senators crowding out through the door. Two of the 

senatorial chairs are overturned, and Caesar's throne lies face-down on the dais steps. So Dinkie 

began asking questions about a drama which he could not quite comprehend. But they were as 

nothing to the questions he asked when he turned to another of the Gerome pictures, this one 

being the familiar old _Cleopatra and Caesar_. He wanted to know why the lady hadn't more 

clothes on, and why the big black man was hiding down behind her, and what Caesar was writing 

a letter for, and why he was looking at the lady the way he did. So, glancing about to make sure 

that Dinky-Dunk was within ear-shot, I did my best to explain the situation to little Dinkie.  "Caesar, 

my son, was a man who set out in the world to be a great conqueror. But when he got quite bald, 

as you may see by the picture, and had reached middle age, he forgot about being a great 

conqueror. He even forgot about being so comfortably middle-aged and that it was not easy for a 

man of his years to tumble gracefully into love, for those romantic impulses, my son, are 

associated more with irresponsible youth and are apt to be called by rather an ugly name when 

they occur in advanced years. But Caesar fell in love with the lady you see in the picture, whose 

name was Cleopatra and who was one of the greatest man-eaters that ever came out of Egypt. 

She had a weakness for big strong men, and although certain authorities have claimed that she 

was a small and hairy person with a very uncertain temper, she undoubtedly set a very good table 

and made her gentlemen friends very comfortable, for Caesar stayed feasting and forgetting 

himself for nearly a year with her. It must have been very pleasant, for Caesar loved power, and 

intended to be one of the big men of his time. But the lady also loved power, and was undoubtedly 

glad to see that she could make Caesar forget about going home, though it was too bad that he 

forgot, for always, even after he had lived to write about all the great things he had done in the 

world, people remembered more about his rather absurd infatuation for the lady than about all the 

battles he had won and all the prizes he had captured. And the lady, of nothing, we believe, but 

the general statement of Clarendon that his friend regarded with horror the storm gathering 

against the archbishop, which the words of Falkland himself, just quoted, seem sufficient to 

disprove. Mr. Arnold tells us that "Falkland disliked Laud; he had a natural antipathy to his heat, 

fussiness, and arbitrary temper." He had an antipathy to a good deal more in Laud than this, and 

expressed his dislike in language which showed that he was himself not deficient in heat when his 



religious feelings were aroused. He accused Laud and the ecclesiastics of his party of having 

"destroyed unity under pretence of uniformity;" of having "brought in Superstition and Scandal 

under the titles of Reverence and Decency;" of having "defiled the Church by adorning the 

churches," of having "destroyed as much of the Gospel as they could without themselves being 

destroyed by the law." He compared them to the hen in AEsop, fed too fat to lay eggs, and to dogs 

in the manger, who would neither preach nor let others preach. He charged them with checking 

instruction in order to introduce that religion which accounts ignorance the mother of devotion. He 

endorsed the common belief that one of them was a Papist at heart, and that only regard for his 

salary prevented him from going over to Rome. All this uttered to a Parliament in such a mood 

would hardly be in favour of gentle dealing with the archbishop. But Pym and Hampden, as 

Clarendon himself admits, never intended to proceed to extremities against the old man; they were 

satisfied with having put him in safe keeping and removed him from the councils of the King. When 

they were gone, the Presbyterians, to whom the leadership of the Revolution then passed, took up 

the impeachment and brought Laud to the block.  The parts were distributed among the leaders. 

To Falkland was entrusted the prosecution of the Lord Keeper Finch; and this part he performed in 

a style which thoroughly identifies him with the other leaders, and with the general spirit of the 

movement at this stage of the Revolution. No man, so far as we can see, did more to set the stone 

rolling; it was not likely that, with his slender force, he would be able to stop it at once in mid 

career.  In contrasting Falkland's line of conduct with that of the "Puritans," on the question of the 

Bishops' Bill and of the impeachment of Laud, Mr. Arnold indicates his impression that all Puritans 

were on principle enemies, and as a matter of course fanatical enemies, of Episcopacy. But he will 

find that at this time many Puritans were Low Church Episcopalians, wishing only to moderate the 

pretensions and curb the authority of the Bishops. Episcopacy is not one of the grievances 

protested against in the Millenary Petition Sir John Eliot appears to have been as strong an 

Erastian as Mr. Arnold could desire.  It seems to us hardly possible to draw a sharp line of 

distinction in any respect, except that of practical ability, between Falkland and Hampden. 

Falkland failed to understand, while Hampden understood, the character of the King and the full 

peril of the situation; that was the real difference between the two men. The political and 

ecclesiastical ideal of both in all probability was pretty much the same. Mr. Arnold chooses to 

describe Hampden as "seeking the Lord about militia or ship- money," and he undertakes to 

represent Jesus as "whispering to him with benign disdain." Sceptics, to disprove the objective 

reality of the Deity, allege

But I was interrupted at this point. And it was by Dinky-Dunk.  "Oh, hell!" he said as he flung down 

his paper and strode out into the other room. And those exits, I remembered, were getting to be a 

bit of a habit with my harried old Diddums.     _Sunday the Fifth_   The Day of Rest seems to be 

the only day left to me now for my writing. There are no idlers in the neighborhood of Casa 

Grande. The days are becoming incredibly long, but they still seem over-short for all there is to do. 

The men are much too busy on the land to give material thought to any thing so womanish as a 

kitchen-garden. So I have my own garden to see to. And sometimes I work there perhaps find an 

indirect confirmation of their remark in the numerous lives and portraitures of Christ which have 

appeared of late years, each entirely different from the rest, and each stamped clearly enough with 

the impress of an individual mind. But where has Hampden spoken of himself as "seeking the Lord 

about militia or ship-money?" He appears to have been a highly-educated man of the world. In one 

of his few remaining letters there are recommendations to a friend, who had consulted him about 

the education of his sons, which seem to blend regard for religion with enlightened liberality of 

view. If he prayed for support and guidance in his
