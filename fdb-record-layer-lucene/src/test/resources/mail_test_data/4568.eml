philodendron monstera amused the pleasure-loving people. The band of Bohemi=

 he appears at the height=20

of his brief career with well formed, gracious features, ardent eyes, a bea=

and distinction, an expression both grave and genial, the observer inevitab=

ONQUERING A PEACE=20

(1846=E2=80=931848)  It was only after Polk felt assured of the refusal to =
receive Slidell[117] that he=20

assumed an attitude so aggressive as clearly to challenge war; and from tha=
t time forward it=20

seems to have been his desire to carry the struggle just far enough to brin=
g Mexico to the point of=20

conceding a territorial indemnity on the terms which he had intended to off=
er through Slidell. In=20

accordance with this=20


_
this dignified, imaginative countenance we have no hint of Callot's tremend=
ous curiosity regarding=20

the most fantastic side of the fantastic times in which he lived. We see hi=
m in the role least=20

emphasized by his admirers, although that to which the greater number of hi=
s working years were=20

dedicated: the role, that is, of moralist, philosopher and historian, one d=
eeply impressed by the=20

sufferings and cruelties of which he became a sorrowful critic.  There sure=
ly never was an artist=20

whose life and environment were more faithfully illustrated by his art. To =
know one is to know the=20

other, at least as they appear from the outside, for with Callot, as with t=
he less veracious and=20

ingenuous Watteau, it is the external aspect of things that we get and from=
 which we must form=20

our inferences. Only in his selection of his subjects do we find the preocc=
upation of his mind; in his=20

rendering he is detached and impersonal, helping us out at times in our kno=
wledge of his mental=20

attitude with such quaint rhymes as those accompanying _Les Grandes Miseres=
 de la Guerre_,=20

but chiefly confining his hand to the representation of forms, relations an=
d distances, with as little=20

concern as possible for the expression of his own temperament, or for psych=
ological portraiture of=20

any sort.  In the little history, more or less authenticated, of his eventf=
ul youth is the key to his=20

charm as an artist, a charm the essence of which is freedom, an easy, infor=
mal way of looking at=20

the visible world, a light abandon in the method of reproducing it, an inde=
pendence of the tool or=20

medium, resulting in art which, despite its minuteness of detail, seems to =
"happen" as Whistler has=20

said all true art must. The beginning was distinctly picturesque, befitting=
 a nature to which the=20

world at first unfolded itself as a great Gothic picturebook filled with th=
e Paredes government was=20

yet in suspense, that Slidell should be directed to go on board a United St=
ates vessel and wait for=20

further instructions.[118] The object of this plan was evidently to be able=
 to resume negotiations,=20

as soon as Mexico had felt the pressure sufficiently, without the delays in=
cident to a=20

correspondence between the two capitals. The same considerations influenced=
, at a later stage of=20

the war, the appointment of Trist.[119] To this method of pushing on the co=
nflict, with the sword in=20

one hand and the olive-branch in the other, Polk applied the peculiar desig=
nation of =E2=80=9Cconquering a=20

neral Scott, the commander-

in-chief of the United States Army, was appointed to command directly the f=
orces that were to=20

operate against Mexico. According to a plan of operations which appears to =
have originated with=20

President Polk himself, but which was concurred in by Secretary of War Marc=
y and by General=20

Scott, New Mexico and California, which Polk intended to claim by way of in=
demnity, and=20

Chihuahua, were to be occupied and held; the United States forces were to b=
e pushed toward the=20

heart of Mexico in order to force the Mexicans to terms; and the naval forc=
es in the Gulf and the=20

Pacific were assigned specific duties in connection with the general scheme=
.[120]  The plan was in=20

keeping with the main purpose of the war, and was, on the whole, well adapt=
ed to insure success.=20

The northern provinces were far distant from the city of Mexico; the hold o=
f the central government=20

upon them was but slight; and, even if its available forces had been suffic=
iently strong and=20

effective to send the troops needed to resist invasion, the difficulties of=
 transportation would have=20

been hard to overcome. Of course, similar difficulties were experienced in=
=20


_
eccentric and misshapen figures.  One spring day in 1604, a band of Bohemia=
ns, such as are=20

described in Gautier's _Le Capitaine Fracasse_, might have been seen journe=
ying through the=20

smiling country of Lorraine on their way to Florence to be present there at=
 the great Fair of the=20

Madonna. No gipsy caravan of to-day would so much as suggest that bizarre a=
nd irresponsible=20

company of men, women, and children, clad in motley rags, some in carts, so=
me trudging on foot,=20

some mounted on asses or horses rivaling Rosinante in bony ugliness, the me=
n armed with lance,=20

cutlass and rifle, a cask of wine strapped to the back of one, a lamb in th=
e arms of another. A=20

couple of the swarming children were decked out with cooking utensils, an i=
ron pot for a hat, a=20

turnspit for a cane, a gridiron hanging in Mexico; but such operations were=
 far easier for a strong=20

government with abundant resources than for one so ill established and so l=
acking in means as=20

that of Herrera or Paredes. The population of the north Mexican provinces w=
as sparse and=20

unenergetic, and could not be relied on for its defence; the local governme=
nts were weak and=20

inefficient; and in 1846 that of California was disastrously affected by di=
ssensions between two=20

rival leaders, Jos=C3=A9 Castro and Pio Pico, representing respectively the=
 northern district and the=20

southern.[121] It was in the northern district, in the lower valley of the =
Sacramento River and near=20

the bay of San Francisco, that the foreign population, including the Americ=
ans, was most=20

numerous.  The plan for a campaign directed at the city of Mexico was gradu=

for terrified flight on=20

the part of the inmates. The camp by night, if no shelter were at hand, was=
 in the forest, where the=20

travelers tied their awnings to the branches of trees, built their fires, d=
ressed their stolen meats,=20

and lived so far as they could accomplish it on the fat of the at first was=
 that a vigorous invasion of=20

Mexico would end the war, without the necessity of pushing it far into the =
interior; and, since=20

operations on the coast in the summer were so dangerous, the attack was mad=
e first in the north.=20

The resistance of the Mexicans was, however, more desperate and prolonged t=
han was expected,=20

and ultimately the change was made to the=20
