He afterwards exchanged the "camp" for the more ambitious "cabin," but his =
cabin, was "a rough, rough log one," _
sacrifices, for my willingness to surrender to strangers the land which had=
 once been our home,=20

the acres on which we'd once been happy and heavy-hearted. He merely remark=
ed that under the=20

circumstances it seemed the most sensible thing to do. There's a one-horse =
lawyer in Buckhorn=20

who has been asking about the Harris Ranch and Dinky-Dunk says he suspects =
this inquiring one=20

has a client up his sleeve.  What I had looked forward to as a talk which m=
ight possibly beat down=20

a few of the barriers of reserve between us proved a bit of a disappointmen=
t. My husband refused=20

to accept me as a heroine. And on his way out, as ill-luck would have it, h=
e stopped to observe=20

Pauline Augusta struggling over a letter to her "Uncle Peter." It was a mai=
den effort along that line=20

and she was dictating her messages to Dinkie, who, in turn, was laboriously=
 and carefully=20

inscribing them on my writing-pad, with a nose and a sympathetically workin=
g tongue not more=20

than ten inches away from the paper. Pauline Augusta, in fact, had just pro=
claimed to her=20

amanuensis that "we had a geese for dinner to-day" when her father stopped =
to size up the=20

situation.  "To whom are you describing the home circle?" questioned Paulin=
e Augusta's parent,=20

with an intonation that didn't escape me.  "It's a letter to Uncle Peter," =
explained Dinkie's little=20

sister. And I could see Duncan's face harden.  "It's funny my whole family =
should fall for that=20

damned Quaker!" were the words he flung over his tradition of the Nonconfor=
mists. Their history=20

has been a long struggle for the rights of conscience against spurious auth=
ority, an authority which=20

we believe Mr. Arnold holds to be spurious as well as they. This is not alt=
ogether a bad start in the=20

pursuit of the truth for which the world now craves, and which, we cordiall=
y admit, lies beyond the=20

existing creed of any particular Church. At all events, it would seem impro=
vident to merge such an=20

element of religious inquiry in that of which the tradition is submission t=
o spurious authority,=20

whatever advantages the latter may have in social, literary, and aesthetic =
respects. Not a=20

generation has yet passed since the admission of Nonconformists to the Univ=
ersities; and more=20

than a generation is needed in order to attain the highest culture. Give th=
e Free Churches time,=20

and let us see whether they have not something better to give us in return =
than "hideousness" and=20

"immense ennui."     THE EARLY YEARS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN   Our readers need =
not be=20

afraid that we are going to bore them with the Slavery Question or the Civi=
l War. We deal here not=20

with the Martyr President, but with Abe Lincoln in embryo, leaving the grea=
t man at the entrance of=20

the grand scene. Mr. Ward H. Lamon has published a biography [Footnote: The=
 Life of Abraham=20

Lincoln from his Birth to his Inauguration as President. By Ward H. Lamon. =
Boston: James R.=20

Osgood & Co. 1872] which enables us to do this, and which, besides containi=

room.     _Tuesday the Fifth_   School has started again. And it's a solemn=
 business, this matter of=20

planting wisdom in little prairie heads. Dinky-Dunk, who has been up to his=
 ears in haying and is=20

now watching his grain with a nervous eye, remarked that our offspring woul=
d be once more=20

mingling with Mennonites and Swedes and Galicians and Ukrainians. I resente=
d that speech,=20

though I said nothing in reply to it. But I decided to investigate Gershom'=
s school.  So yesterday=20

afternoon I drove over in the car. I had a blow-out on the way, a blow-out =
which I had to patch up=20

with my own hands, so I arrived too late to inspect Gershom conducting his =
classes. It was almost=20

four, in fact, before I got there, so I pulled up beside the school-gate an=
d sat waiting for the=20

children to come out. And as I sat there in the car-seat, under a sky of un=
imaginable blue, with the=20

prairie wind whipping my face, I couldn't help studying that bald little te=
mple of learning which=20

stood out so clear-cut in the sharp northern sunlight. It was a plain littl=
e frame building set in one=20

corner of a rancher's half-section, an acre of science, as illustrating, by=
 a world-renowned=20

instance, the origin of the species Politician. The materials for it appear=
 to be drawn from the most=20

authentic sources, and to have been used with diligence, though in point of=
 form the book leaves=20

something to be desired. We trust it and the authorities quoted in it for o=
ur facts.  After the murder,=20

criticism, of course, was for a time impossible. Martyrdom was followed by =
canonization, and the=20

popular heart could not be blamed for overflowing in hyperbole. The fallen =
chief "was Washington,=20

he was Moses, and there were not wanting even those who likened him to the =
God and Redeemer=20

of all the earth. These latter thought they discovered in his early origin,=
 his kindly nature, his=20

benevolent precepts, and the homely anecdotes in which he taught the people=
, strong points of=20

resemblance between him and the Divine Son of Mary." A halo of myth natural=
ly gathered round=20

the cradle of this new Moses--for we will not pursue the more extravagant a=
nd offensive parallel=20

which may serve as a set-off against that which was drawn by English Royali=
sts between the=20

death of=20


_
wire fence where the two trails crossed, the two long trails that melted aw=
ay in the interminable=20

distance. It seemed a lonely little house of scholarship, with its playgrou=
nd worn so bare that even=20

two months of idleness had given scant harborage for the seeds that wind an=
d bird must have=20

brought there. But as I stared at it it seemed to take on a dignity all its=
 own, Among other fables, it=20

was believed that the President's family had fled from Kentucky to Indiana =
to escape the taint of=20

Slavery. Thomas Lincoln, the father of Abraham, was migratory enough, but t=
he course of his=20

migrations was not determined by high moral motives, and we may safely affi=
rm that had he ever=20

found himself among the fleshpots of Egypt, he would have stayed=20


_
purpose. It was the nest of a nation's greatness. It was the outpost of civ=
ilization. It was the=20

advance-guard of pioneering man, driving the wilderness deeper and deeper i=
nto the North. It was=20

life preparing wistfully for the future.  From it I heard a sudden shrill c=
horus of voices and the=20

clatter of feet, and I knew that the day's work was over. I saw the childre=
n emerge, like bees out of=20

a beehive, and loneliness no longer reigned over that bald yard in the betr=
aying northern sunlight.=20

Yet they were not riotous, those children confronting the wine-like air of =
the open. They were more=20

subdued than I had looked for, since I could been. He was a thriftless "ne'=
er do weel," who had=20

very commonplace reasons for wandering away from the miserable, solitary fa=
rm in Kentucky, on=20

which his child first formed a sad acquaintance with life and nature, and w=
hich, as it happened,=20

was not in the slave-owning region of the State. His decision appears to ha=
ve been hastened by a=20

"difficulty," in which he bit off his antagonist's nose--an incident to whi=
ch it would be difficult to find=20

a parallel in the family histories of Scripture heroes, or even in those of=
 the Sainted Fathers of the=20

Republic. He drifted to Indiana, and in a spot which was then an almost unt=
rodden wilderness,=20
