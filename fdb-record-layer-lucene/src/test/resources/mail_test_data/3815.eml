been in Halifax."  "She fairly withered me when I made a little fun of Chil=

tell you what it is, Reggie," remarked Mr. Shorter, with more frankness tha=
n tact, "you could talk=20

ocks women into a=20

cocked hat. I've seen 'em stark raving crazy. Why, there was that Mrs. Slic=

Shorter continued, with sincerity. "She has a brilliant future ahead of her=

her, she's stunning to look at, and she's made her own way in spite of that=
 Billycock of a husband=20

who talks like the original Rothschild. By the bye, Wing is using him for a=
 good thing. He's sent him=20

out West to pull that street railway chestnut out of the fire. I'm not part=

though I try to play the game straight myself--the way my father played it.=
 But by the lord Harry, I=20

found courage to say. "I believed the diamonds were genuine."  "You lie aga=
in, and you will=20

continue to lie. But it will not help you. I will have my money back! Do yo=

have my money back, which you and your confederates have shared between you=
! I will not wait=20

long for it. Before twelve o'clock to-morrow you shall count it out to me o=

you shall stand in the felon's dock. All your cunning shall not save you. I=

 by a scoundrel I=20

snatched from the gutter! If you don't pay me what you have stolen from me =
I will so pursue you=20

answered Mr. Shorter, cheerfully finishing his chartreuse, and fixing his e=
