[Footnote 87: The against Louis XIV., chief among them the insult shown to =
the nobility in the=20

King's legitimatising his natural offspring; and he justly regarded Madame =
de Maintenon as his=20

enemy.  The death of the Duc de Bourgogne, to whose party he belonged, was =
a blow to Saint-

Simon's hopes; but the Regent remained his friend. He helped, on a diplomat=
ic mission to Spain,=20

to negotiate the marriage of Louis XV.; yet still was on fire with indignat=
ion caused by the wrongs=20

of the dukes and peers, whom he regarded as entitled on historical grounds =
to form the great=20



council of the monarchy, and almost as rightful partners in the supreme pow=
er. His political life=20

closed in 1723 with the death of the Regent. He lived in retirement at his =
chateau of La Ferte-

Vidame, sorrowfully surviving his wife and his sons. In Paris, at the age o=
f eighty (1755), Saint-

Simon died.  When nineteen years old, reading Bassompierre's _Memoires_ in =
a soldier's hour of=20

leisure, he conceived the idea of recording his own experiences, and the _M=
emoires_ of Saint-

Simon were begun. During later years, in the camp or at the court, notes ac=
cumulated in his=20

hands, but the definitive form which they took was not determined until, in=
 his retirement at La=20

Ferte-Vidame, the _Journal_ of Dangeau came into his hands. Dangeau's _Jour=
nal_ is dry,=20

colourless, passionless, without insight and without art; but it is a well-=
informed and an exact=20

chronicle, extending over the years from 1684 to 1720. Saint-Simon found it=
 "d'une fadeur a faire=20

vomir"; its servility towards the King and Madame de Maintenon enraged him;=
 but it exhibited facts=20

in an orderly sequence; it might serve as a guide and a clue among his own =
reminiscences; on the=20

basis of Dangeau's literal transcript of occurrences he might weave his own=
 brilliant recitals and=20

passionate presentations of character. Thus Saint-Simon's _Memoires_ came t=
o be written.  He=20

himself saw much, and his eye had a demonic power of observation; nothing e=
scaped his vision,=20

and his passions enabled him to penetrate through what he saw to its secret=
 meanings. He had=20

gathered information from those who knew the mysteries of the palace and th=
e court; great=20

persons, court ladies, even valets and waiting-women, had been sought and s=
earched to satisfy=20

his insatiable curiosity. It is true that the passions which often lit up t=
he truth sometimes obscured=20

it; any gossip discreditable to those whom he hated was welcome to him; he =
confesses that he did=20

not pique himself on his impartiality, and it is certain that he did not al=
ways verify details.=20

Nevertheless he did not consciously falsify facts; he had a sense of the ho=
nour of a gentleman; his=20

spirit was serious, and his feeling of duty and of religion was sincere. Wi=
thout his impetuosity, his=20

violence, his exaggerations, we might not have had his vividness, like that=
 of life itself, his=20

incomparable portraits, more often inspired by hatred than by love, his min=
uteness and his breadth=20

of style, the phrases which ineffaceably brand his victims, the lyrical out=
cry of triumph over=20

enemies of his order. His style is the large style of seventeenth-century p=
rose, but alive with words=20

that sparkle and gleam, words sometimes created by himself to express the i=
ntensity of his=20

imagination.  The _Memoires_, the final preparation of which was the work o=
f his elder years,=20

cover the period from 1691 to 1723. His manuscripts were bequeathed to his =
cousin, the Bishop of=20

Metz; a lawsuit arose with Saint-Simon's creditors, and in the end the pape=
rs were buried among=20
