philodendron monstera     Romans represented all numerical values by the co=
mbination     (additive when the second letter is of equal or less value) o=
f six     letters of their alphabet: i (=3D 1), v (=3D 5), x (=3D 10), c (f=
or     "centum" =3D 100), d (=3D 500), and m (=3D 1000): thus 20 =3D xx, 15=
 =3D xv,     and 9 =3D ix. These are called the Roman numerals, and are ado=
pted     by all European nations when using the Roman alphabet. The Arabs  =
   at first followed their neighbours, the Jews, in their method of     com=
putation, so  "I take them, then," said the lieutenant.  And he took hold o=
f one within his reach; his two companions did the same thing.  "Sir," crie=
d the groom, "they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled =
half an hour."  "Half an hour's rest is enough," replied the Gascon.  The g=
room cried aloud for help. A kind of steward appeared, just as D'Artagnan a=
nd his companions were prepared to mount. The steward attempted to expostul=
ate.  "My dear friend," cried the lieutenant, "if you say a philodendron mo=

 "Half an hour's rest is enough," replied the Gascon.  The groom cried alou=

was made good use of. From the first secret cycle of 600--the Naros, transf=
ormed successively=20

into 60,000 and 60 and 6, and, with other noughts added into other secret c=

him fall.  "The devil!" exclaimed Porthos; "there's Vulcan foundered."  "Zo=

"then we must stop! Give me your horse, Porthos. What the devil are you doi=

falling, or rather, Bayard is falling," answered Porthos.  All three then c=
ried: "All's over."  "Hush!"=20

said D'Artagnan.  "What is it?"  "I hear a horse."  "It belongs to one of o=

The Asiatic people count a cycle of 60 years also, after which comes the lu=

the Chinese have their small cycle of 60 days, the Jews of 6 days, the Gree=

Tartar cycle called Van was 180 years, or three sixties; this multiplied by=

arithmetic and mathematics; as "Our Figures," in _Chips from a German Works=
hop_, by Prof. Max=20

Mueller, shows beyond a doubt. As well explained by Krishna Shastri Godbole=
 in _The=20

Theosophist_:       The Jews ... represented the units (1-9) by the first n=
ine letters     of our=20

alphabet; the tens (10-90) by the next nine letters; the     first four hun=

he letters "kaf"     (11th),=20

resented other numbers by=20

combining these letters     according to their value.... The Jews of the pr=
esent period still     adhere=20

to this practice of notation in their Hebrew books. The     Greeks had a nu=
merical system similar to=20

that used by the Jews,     but they carried it a little farther by using le=
tters of the     alphabet with a=20

dash or slant-line behind, to represent thousands     (1000-9000), tens of =
thousands (10,000-

90,000) and one hundred of     thousands (100,000) the last, for instance, =
being represented by=20

"rho" with a dash behind, quarter indicated by D'Artagnan.  "Monsieur," sai=
d Mousqueton, who,=20

abandoning his horse on the high road, had come on foot to rejoin his maste=
r, "Phoebus could no=20

longer hold out and----"  "Silence!" said Porthos.  In fact, at that moment=
 a second neighing was=20

borne to them on the night wind.  "It is five hundred feet from here, in ad=
vance," said D'Artagnan.=20

"True, monsieur," said Mousqueton; "and five hundred feet from here is a sm=
all hunting-house."=20

"Mousqueton, thy pistols," said D'Artagnan.  "I have them at hand, monsieur=
."  "Porthos, take=20

yours from your holsters."  "I have them."  "Good!" said D'Artagnan, seizin=
g his own; "now you=20

understand, Porthos?"  "Not too well."  "We are out on the king's service."=
  "Well?"  "For the king's=20

service we need horses."  "That is true," said Porthos.  "Then not a word, =
but set to work!"  They=20

went on through the darkness, silent as phantoms; they saw a light glimmeri=
ng in the midst of=20

some trees.  "Yonder is the house, Porthos," said the Gascon; "let me do wh=
at I please and do=20

you what I do."  They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty =
steps from the house=20

unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut, four fine =
horses. A groom=20

was rubbing them down; near them were saddles and bridles.  D'Artagnan appr=
oached quickly,=20

making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind.  "I buy t=
hose horses," he said=20

to the groom.  The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise, but mad=
e no reply.  "Didn't=20

you hear, fellow?"  "Yes, I heard."  "Why, then, didn't you reply?"  "Becau=
