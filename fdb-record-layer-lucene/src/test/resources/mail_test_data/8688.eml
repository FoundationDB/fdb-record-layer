No, it has my name on it.=20

Yesh, Charudatta musht be shlaughtered now,       And I 'll invent the plan=

God will not have courage to damn him." "He was the most sincere and candid=
 soul," wrote his=20

friend Maucroix, who had been intimate with him for more than fifty years, =
"that I have ever known;=20

never a disguise; I don't know that he spoke an untruth in all his life."  =
All that is best in the genius=20

of La Fontaine may be found in his _Fables_. The comedies in which he colla=
borated, the=20

_Captivite de Saint Malc_, written on the suggestion of the Port-Royalists,=
 the miscellaneous=20

poems, though some of these are admirable, even the _Contes_, exhibit only =
a fragment of his=20

mind; in the _Fables_ the play of his faculties is exquisite, and is comple=
te. His imagination was=20

unfitted for large and sustained creation; it operated most happily in a na=
rrow compass. The=20

_Fables_, however, contain much in little; they unite an element of drama a=
nd of lyric with=20

narrative; they give scope to his feeling for nature, and to his gift for t=

Aha! I 'll jump over the wall where it is half fallen down, and eshcape tha=

Buddha be praised! has=20

said--     "_Une ample comedie a cents actes divers     Et dont la scene es=
t l'univers._"  He had not=20

to invent his subjects; he found them in all the fabulists who had preceded=
 him--Greek, Latin,=20

Oriental, elder French writers--"j'en lis qui sont du Nord et qui sont du M=
idi;" but he may be said to=20

have recreated the species. From an apologue, tending to an express moral, =
he converted the=20

fable into a _conte_, in which narrative, description, observation, satire,=
 dialogue have an=20

independent value, and the moral is little more than an accident. This is e=
specially true of the=20

midmost portion of the collection--Books vii.-ix.--which appeared ten years=
 after the earliest group.=20

He does not impose new and great ideas on the reader; he does not interpret=
 the deepest=20

passions; he takes life as he sees it, as an entertaining comedy, touched a=
t times with serious=20

thought, with pathos, even with melancholy, but in the main a comedy, which=
 teaches us to smile=20

at the vanities,=20
