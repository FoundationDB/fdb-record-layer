There, take a chair, my good fellow, you're always heartily welcome."  Ston=

on a bed, and well propped up with soft cushions; a flannel dressing-gown w=

that she paused at the corner. She was peeping into the Rue d'Hollande, to =
find out what was=20

happening there.  "She will come back in a moment or two," I said to myself=
 wearily, and sat=20

waiting. For a little while she stood with her long dress gathered up under=
 her cloak: then she=20

darted round the corner and vanished. If she had not appeared again almost =

 Even the voice of Ben=20

Stone, though not perhaps as strong, sounded as jovial as street where Maxi=
