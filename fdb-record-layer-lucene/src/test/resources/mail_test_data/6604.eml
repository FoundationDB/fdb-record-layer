ent of the swarthy-skinned red-men, whose faces declare them to be a remnan=
t of the once great Ute tribe--now utilized to a better occupation than in =
the dark and bloody days of the past.  Near the crusher building is a large=
, stoutly-constructed windlass, worked by mule power, and every J. Bok, as =
partner and active manager.  Edward's attention was now turned, for the fir=
st time, to women and their reading habits.  He became interested in the fa=
ct that the American woman was not a newspaper reader.  He tried to find ou=
