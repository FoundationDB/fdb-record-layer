mouth, and down he went among the feet of the crowd of indignant maskers.  =
"Look to him,=20

Spunyarn," cried Haggard, as he hustled his way through the crowd, and in a=
n instant=20

disappeared, bearing in his arms the fainting form of the shepherdess.  _Va=
e victis_, alas for poor=20

Furibon, where was his boasted skill as a kicker? Why had he not sprung hig=
h in air and delivered=20

his unexpected assault? We must say of the _savate_ respectfully, as our Ga=
llic neighbours said=20

of the Balaclava charge, _c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre_. S=
eated on the floor, the=20

unfortunate Frenchman presented a piteous appearance, as he shed mingled te=
ars of pain and=20

rage, tore his hair, and wiped his cut lip. "_Insolente birbone!_" "_Bestia=
!_" "_Cane!_" Such were=20

the cries of the dancers on seeing the blow struck, but they were levelled =
not so much at the=20

assailant as at his victim. In the eyes of the bystanders, Haggard was evid=
ently looked upon as the=20

protector of beauty in distress. But as Valour bore off fainting Beauty, an=
d made his suddenly=20

triumphant exit, everybody's attention was directed to the unhappy Furibon.=
 A gentleman tearing=20

his hair, in the eyes of Italians, is a common, interesting, and dignified =
object. The cause of this=20

performance is usually romantic, time and place generally appropriate, but =
Italians do her.  The=20

gentlemen left the dining-room with the ladies, in the Continental manner. =
Lady St. Jerome, who=20

was leaning on the arm of the monsignore, guided him into a saloon farther =
than the one they had=20

reentered, and then seating herself said, =E2=80=9CYou were telling me abou=
t Scotland, that you yourself=20

thought it ripe.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CUnquestionably. The original plan was t=
o have established our hierarchy when=20

the Kirk split up; but that would have been a mistake, it was not then ripe=
. There would have been=20

a fanatical reaction. There is always a tendency that way in Scotland: as i=
t is, at this moment, the=20

Establishment and the Free Kirk are mutually sighing for some compromise wh=
ich may bring them=20

together and, if the proprietors would give up their petty patronage, some =
flatter themselves it=20

might be arranged. But we are thoroughly well informed, and have provided f=
or all this. We sent=20

two of our best men into Scotland some time ago, and they have invented a n=
ew church, called=20

the United Presbyterians. John Knox himself was never more violent, or more=
 mischievous. The=20

United Presbyterians will do the business: they will render Scotland simply=
 impossible to live in;=20

and then, when the crisis arrives, the distracted and despairing millions w=
ill find refuge in the=20

bosom of their only mother. That is why, at home, we wanted no=20


_
masked balls. As everywhere else, a foreigner in distress in Rome is looked=
 upon as a grotesque=20

object, and poor Barbiche was no exception to the rule. At first he sat and=
 wept, now he sat and=20

swore, but all the time he tore hard at his hair. Haggard had disappeared w=
ith the celerity of a=20

harlequin who jumps through a trap.  Lord Spunyarn was somewhat bewildered;=
 he, as a boxer, as=20

an amateur though unsuccessful athlete, knew what a good knock-down blow wa=
s; he had seen=20

them delivered, with varying degrees of energy, force, and viciousness, but=
 never in all his=20

lordship's experience till now had he seen a master-stroke which combined a=
ll the above qualities=20

in the superlative degree. At last he got poor Furibon upon his legs. The F=
renchman carefully felt=20

his front teeth, doubtful if they were still there, then he ceased to swear=
 and to mutter in his own=20

tongue; he ceased to be Furibon, he became once more the correct M. Barbich=
e of the French=20

Embassy.  "Milor, you have seen the insult. Monsieur Haggard takes advantag=
e of his physique, of=20

his brutal boxing skill, to maim me, perhaps, _Mon Dieu_, for life, and to =
render me an object of=20

contempt and ridicule to these grimacing apes," here he glowered at the lau=
ghing crowd.  "But, my=20

dear boy, it was your own fault, you know; what did you want to lay hands o=
n the domino for?"  "In=20

that there is nothing, Lord Spunyarn. Black dominoes, pink dominoes, blue d=
ominoes. Bah! they=20

are but public property, milor, but I shall teach this Don Quixote a lesson=
, this chivalrous protector=20

of dominoes. Yes," he added solemnly, as he crossed himself, "please God." =
 Lord Spunyarn=20

shook his head. There seemed no other way out of it; the Frenchman had been=
 struck, the insult=20

was in a public place; an apology or arrangement was impossible. Spunyarn w=
as well aware that=20

Barbiche was by no means an antagonist to be despised. He had been a journa=
list, a career which=20

in France may enable a man to attain the highest positions; from journalism=
 he had drifted into=20

diplomacy, as French journalists sometimes do. This was after his accession=
 to the fortune of a=20

deceased uncle. Of course, he was skilled with the small-sword, as all Fren=
ch journalists are=20

bound to be; his reputation with the pistol was equally deadly.  "I shall s=
end my friend to him in the=20

morning," said M. Barbiche calmly, as leaning on Lord Spunyarn's arm he lef=
t the ball-room. "I=20

suppose you will act for him?"  "Don't know, I'm sure. I'm not up to these =
things, but I don't see=20

why you should shoot each other over it."  The Frenchman shrugged his shoul=
ders as he stepped=20

into his perfectly-appointed but funereal-looking little brougham. As he dr=
ove home he meditated=20

on his wrongs, and in his heart of hearts he swore that four-and-twenty hou=
rs should not elapse=20

ere the establishment of the hierarchy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the cardinal=
 says no?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd must be followed. For=20

these islands he has no equal. He wishes great reserve at present. Affairs =
here are progressing,=20

gradually but surely. But it is Ireland where matters are critical, or will=
 be soon.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIreland! I thought=20

there was a sort of understanding there=E2=80=94at least for the present.=
=E2=80=9D  The monsignore shook his=20

head. =E2=80=9CWhat do you think of an American invasion of Ireland?=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CAn American invasion!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEven so;=20

nothing more probable, and nothing more to be deprecated by us. Now that th=
e civil war in=20

America is over, the Irish soldiery are resolved to employ their experience=
 and their weapons in=20

their own land; but they have no thought for the interest of the Holy See, =
or the welfare of our holy=20

religion. Their secret organization is tampering with the people and tamper=
ing with the priests. The=20

difficulty of Ireland is that the priests and the people will consider ever=
y thing in a purely Irish point=20

of view. To gain some local object, they will encourage the principles of t=
he most lawless=20

liberalism, which naturally land them in Fenianism and atheism. And the dan=
ger is not foreseen,=20

because the Irish political object of the moment is alone looked to.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CBut surely they can be=20



guided?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe want a statesman in Ireland. We have never be=
en able to find one; we want a man=20

like the cardinal. But the Irish will have a native for their chief. We cau=
ght Churchill young, and=20

educated him in the Propaganda; but he has disappointed us. At first all se=
emed well; he was=20

reserved and austere; and we heard with satisfaction that he was unpopular.=
 But, now that critical=20

times are arriving, his peasant-blood cannot resist the contagion. He procl=
aims the absolute=20

equality of all religions, and of the power of the state to confiscate eccl=
esiastical property, and not=20

restore it to us, but alienate it forever. For the chance of subverting the=
 Anglican Establishment, he=20

is favoring a policy which will subvert religion itself. In his eagerness h=
e cannot see that the=20

Anglicans have only a lease of our property, a lease which is rapidly expir=
ing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThis is sad.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is=20

perilous, and difficult to deal with. But it must be dealt with. The proble=
m is to suppress Fenianism,=20

and not to strengthen the Protestant confederacy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd yo=
u left Rome for this? We understood=20

you were coming for something else,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome, in a sig=
nificant tone.  =E2=80=9CYes, yes, I=20

have been there, and I have seen him.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd have you succe=
eded?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo; and no one will=E2=80=94at=20

least at present.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs all lost, then? Is the Malta scheme=
 again on the carpet?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COur Holy Church=20

in built upon a rock,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore, =E2=80=9Cbut not upon t=
he rock of Malta. Nothing is lost;=20

avenged by his own skilful hand.       CHAPTER XI.    A MEETING IN THE GOOD=
 OLD STYLE.=20

Lord Spunyarn woke with a very bad headache indeed, the morning after the b=
all at Papayani's.=20

He hurried to commence his dressing, for his valet on awakening him had pre=
sented a thin and=20

varnished card, bearing a portentous coronet and the name of the Comte de K=
erguel. The man=20

told him that the visitor had come on business of the most urgent nature. W=
hat his business was,=20

Spunyarn was well aware. Knowing that, next to getting married, a Frenchman=
 looks upon the=20

delivery of a hostile message, as the most important, pleasant, and serious=
 event of life; Spunyarn=20

wisely dressed himself with care and deliberation. When he entered his sitt=
ing-room M. de Kerguel=20

rose and profoundly saluted him.  "Milor Spunyarn. I have the honour of add=
ressing him?"  "Yes,=20

it's quite right, that's me Please be has washed her hands of us.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CWhere, then, are we to look for=20

aid?=E2=80=9D exclaimed Lady St. Jerome, =E2=80=9Cagainst the assassins and=
 atheists? Austria, the alternative ally,=20

is no longer near you; and if she were=E2=80=94that I should ever live to s=

=E2=80=9CPoor Austria!=E2=80=9D said the monsignore with an unctuous sneer.=

was German and she was Catholic, and now she is neither.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=

with your terrible news. We once thought that Spain would be our protector,=
 but we hear bad news=20

from Spain.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said the monsignore, =E2=80=9C=
I think it highly probable that, before a few years have=20

elapsed, every government in Europe will be atheistical except France. Vani=
