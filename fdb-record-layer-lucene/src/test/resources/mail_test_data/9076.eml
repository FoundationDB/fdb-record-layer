more provisions.  "And then I'll start out again," he said.  "We'll go with=

promised Tom. "But now I expect I'll have to get another blast ready."  He =
found the debris brought=20

down by the second one all removed, and in a few days, preparations for exp=

charges tamped in. Electric wires connected them, and they were run out to =
the tunnel mouth=20

where the switch was located.  This was done late one afternoon, and it was=
 planned to set off the=20

blast at the close of the working day, to allow all night for the fumes to =

one of these sallies St.=20

Martin, one of their bravest men, perished.  Under protection of a flag of =

to demand a surrender.  It was the last time, he said, the request would be=
