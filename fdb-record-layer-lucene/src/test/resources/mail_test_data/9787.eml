a dear, of course, and he's working hard. And he's getting it, too, he's ge=
tting it!" A gleam of=20

hunger almost fierce came into her clear violet eyes. "I want a larger apar=
tment--I've picked out the=20

very one. And I want a car, a limousine. I know just how I'll paint it a ma=
uve body with white=20

wheels. And I want a house on Long Island. I've picked out the very spot--j=
ust next to Fanny Carr's=20

new place."  As her sister spoke of these ideals, again Ethel had that feel=
ing of church, but only for=20

a moment.  "Who's Fanny Carr?" she asked alertly.  Amy was slowly combing h=
er hair, and she=20

smiled with kindly tolerance, for her little confession had brought back he=
r faith in herself and her=20

future.  "Fanny was a writer once--"  "Oh, really!"  "Yes. She ran a depart=
ment on one of the=20

papers." It had been the dress pattern page, but Amy did not mention that. =
Instead she yawned=20

complacently. "Oh, she dropped it quick enough--she thought it rather tires=
ome. She's one of the=20

cleverest women I know. She'd have got a long way up in the world, if it we=
ren't for her second=20

husband--"  "Her second?"  "Yes. The first one didn't do very well. She tol=
d me once, 'If you want=20

to get on, change your name at least once in every three years.' Her second=
, as it happened, was=20

no better than the first. But she was clever enough by then to get an able =

ideas about husbands," she said. "But at least she has a love of a home." A=
nd Amy went on to=20

explain to her sister the value and importance of being able to give "week =
ends." Again the gleam=20

came into her eyes.  "It's money, my dear, it's money. They are the same wo=
men in Newport=20

exactly--just like all the rest of us--only they are richer. That's all--bu=
t it is everything. Put me in a=20

big house out there, and my friends wouldn't know me in a few years."  A cl=
oud came on her face=20

as she looked in the glass.  "But that's just the trouble. A few years more=
 and I'll be too late.=20

You've got to get there while you're young. And there's so little time. You=
 lose your looks. It's all=20

very well for some women to talk about ideas and things--and travel and--an=
