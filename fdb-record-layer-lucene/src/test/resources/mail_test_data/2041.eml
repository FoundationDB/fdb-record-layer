seemed blankly incredible. But when the incredibility began to subside, the=
 despotism of the=20

machine methods which could propose and carry out such unheard-of things lo=
omed maleficent.=20

"I'm afraid we are a good many miles apart in this matter of politics," he =
said, when the proposal=20

had been given time to sink in. "America is supposed to be a free country, =
with a representative=20

government elected by the suffrages of the people; do you mean to say that =
you and a few of your=20

friends ignore the basic principles of democracy to such an extent that you=
 nominate and elect=20

anybody you please to any office in the State?"  The far-seeing eyes of the=
 veteran were twinkling=20

again.  "Oh, I don't know about our being so far apart," was the deprecator=
y protest. "You're just a=20

little bit long on theory, that's all, son. When it comes down to the real =
thing--practical politics, as=20

some folks call it--somebody has to head the stampede and turn it. And if w=
e don't do it this=20

coming fall, the other bunch will."  "What other bunch?"  "In this case it'=
s the corporations: the=20

timber people, the irrigation companies, and, most of all, the railroad."  =
"Gantry seems to think that=20

the railroads--or his railroad, at least--are persecuted."  The senator pul=
led his horse down to a still=20

slower walk. "Where did you see Dick Gantry?" he demanded.  Evan told of th=
e meeting on the=20

veranda of the Winnebasset Club, adding the further fact of the college fri=
endship.  "Just=20

happened so, did it?" queried the older man, "that getting together last Sa=
turday night?"  "Why--

yes, I suppose so. Dick knew I was in Boston, and he said he had meant to l=
ook me up."  "I reckon=20

he did," was the quiet comment; "yes, I reckon he did. And he filled you up=
 plumb full of Hardwick=20

McVickar's notions, _of_ course. I reckon that's about what he was told to =
do. But we won't fall=20

apart on that, son. To-morrow we'll run down to the city, and you can look =
the ground over for=20

yourself. I want you to draw your own conclusions, and then come and tell m=
e what you'd like to=20

do. Shall we leave it that way?"  Evan Blount acquiesced, quite without pre=
judice, to a firm=20

conviction that his opinion, when formed, was going to be based on the larg=
er merits of the case,=20

upon a fair and judicial summing-up of the pros and cons--all of them. He f=
elt that it would be a=20

blow struck at the very root of the tree of good government if he should co=
nsent to be the=20

candidate of the machine. But, on the other hand, he saw instantly what a p=
ower a fearless public=20

prosecutor could be in a misguided commonwealth where the lack was not of g=
ood laws, but of=20

men strong enough and courageous enough to administer them. He would see: i=
f the good to be=20

accomplished were great enough to over-balance the evil ... it was a tempta=
tion to compromise--a=20

sharp temptation; and he found himself longing for Patricia, for her clear-=
sighted comment which,=20

he felt sure, would go straight to the heart of the tangle.  It was that th=
ought of Patricia, and his=20

need for her, that made him absent-minded at the Wartrace Hall dinner-table=
 that evening; and the=20

father, looking on, suspected that Evan's taciturnity was an expression of =
his prejudice against the=20

woman who had taken his mother's place. After dinner, when the son, pleadin=
g weariness,=20

retreated early to his room, the senator's suspicion became a belief.  "You=
'll have to be right=20

patient with the boy, little woman," he said to the small person whom Gantr=
y had described as the=20

court of last resort; this when Evan had disappeared and the long-stemmed p=
ipe was alight. "I=20

shouldn't wonder if Boston had put some mighty queer notions into his head.=
"  The little lady=20

looked up from her embroidery frame and a quaint smile was twitching at the=
 corners of the pretty=20

mouth. "He is a dear boy, and he is trying awfully hard to hate me," she sa=
id. "But I sha'n't let him,=20

David."     VI  ON THE WING OF OCCASIONS   From the time when it was herald=
ed in the=20

mammoth New Year's edition of _The Plainsman_ as "the newest, the finest, a=
nd the most=20



luxurious hostelry west of the Missouri River," the Inter-Mountain Hotel, i=
n the Sage-brush capital,=20

had been the acceptable gathering-place of the clans, industrial, promoting=
, or political.=20

Anticipating this patronage, Clarkson, its bonanza-king builder and owner, =
had amended the=20

architect's plans to make them include a convention-hall, committee-rooms, =
and a complete floor=20

of suites with private dining-rooms. Past this, the amended plans doubled t=
he floor space of the=20

lobby--debating-ground dear to the heart of the country delegate--and parti=
cular pains had been=20

taken to make this semi-public forum, where the burning question of the mom=
ent could be=20

caucussed and the shaky partisan resworn to fealty, attractive and home-lik=
e; the plainly tiled floor,=20

leather-covered lounging-chairs, and numerous and convenient cuspidors lend=
ing an air of=20

democratic comfort which was somehow missing in the resplendent, bemirrored=
, onyx-plated bar,=20

blazing with its cut glass and polished mahogany.  After the solid costline=
ss of Wartrace Hall and=20

the thirty-mile spin in a high-powered gentleman's roadster, which was only=
 one of the three high-

priced motor-carriages in the Wartrace garage, Evan Blount was not surprise=
d to learn that his=20

father was registered in permanence for one of the private dining-room suit=
es at the Inter-

Mountain. It was amply evident that the simple life which had been the rule=
 of the it, where both=20

had remained after the steamer stopped.  "What do you suppose Mazagan inten=
ds to do now?"=20

asked Louis.  "I have not the remotest idea, except that, in a general way,=
 he will try to keep us=20

shut up in this channel. For that reason I do not propose to remain here an=
y longer;" and he rang=20

the gong to go ahead.  The tide must have risen six or eight inches by this=
 time, increasing the=20

depth in the channel to that extent. Scott had taken the bearings very care=
fully when he came in,=20

and he soon rang the speed bell. The Maud proceeded at full speed till she =
came to the turn in the=20

passage, where the captain rang to stop her, in order to take an observatio=
n.  The Fatime had not=20

yet got under way, and she appeared to be having some difficulty with her c=
able or anchor. As=20

soon as the Maud had lost her headway the port gun belched out another flas=
h and cloud of=20

smoke. The Maud was at about the same distance from the pirate as when the =
latter fired before,=20

and Scott watched with interest for the result of the discharge. The solid =
shot plumped into the=20

water half a mile from the mark, just as though it had been dropped from so=
me point overhead.  "I=20

don't know much of anything about gunnery, except with four-pounders on a y=
acht; but that last=20

gun was elevated so that we know about the range of her pieces," said the c=
aptain. "It is less than=20

half a mile, and her shots would not do much damage at more than half that =
distance."  "She has=20

weighed her anchor, and started her screw," reported Felix, who was still w=
atching the enemy with=20

the glass.  Scott rang the gong, and the Maud went ahead again. At the same=
 time he directed=20

Felipe to be ready to give the steamer her best speed.  "Another shot!" sho=
uted Felix.  This one=20

was discharged from her starboard gun, as she came about; but its range fel=
l considerably short of=20

that of the other piece. The Maud was still in the channel, and the ledge c=
ould be seen through the=20

clear water on the port hand; what the soundings were on the starboard hand=
 had not yet been=20

demonstrated. The steamer was moving at her ordinary speed. The Fatime had =
turned her head to=20

the south; and, though she was still nearly a mile distant, her engine gong=
 could be heard when it=20

rang for the vessel to go ahead.  The pirate soon changed her course, with =
the apparent intention=20

of "cutting across lots," in order to reach the Maud. A hand was heaving th=
e lead, indicating that=20

Mazagan was not sure of his soundings. She went ahead on the new course not=
 more than the=20

eighth of a mile before she came about, showing that the depth of water was=
 not satisfactory to=20



her commander.  "If the tide were not rising, I should know better what to =
do; for we might go back=20

to the angle in the channel, out of the reach of the guns, and remain there=
 till the morning tide, and=20

then work out into deep water," said Captain Scott, after he had observed t=
he movements of the=20

enemy for a couple of minutes. "But with two feet more water, the Fatime ca=
n go at least up to the=20

verge of the ledge, and that plan would not work anyhow."  "Another gun!" c=
ried Felix, as he=20

caught the flash.  The enemy was a little nearer than before, but the shot =
fell hardly less than half=20

a mile from the Maud. Mazagan had "swung to" in order to fire this shot, bu=
t resumed his course at=20

once. Scott desired to gain some time by leaving the channel, and heading t=
o the south-east.=20

Morris was sounding with his boathook, and reported only thirteen feet when=
 the Maud began to=20

move in that direction.  "Twelve feet and a half!" shouted the first office=
r a little later.  "This won't=20

do," said Scott, shaking his head. "The water shoals to the southward, and =
all we can do is to face=20

the music."  "What do you mean by that, Captain?" asked Louis.  Scott made =
a couple of crosses=20

on his diagram, and passed it to his companion.  "The cross on your left is=
 our present position=20

near the outlet of the channel," the captain explained. "On the port we hav=
e the ledge, and we=20

can't run over that. On the starboard the water is too shoal for us. We can=
 go neither to the right=20

nor the left."  "Therefore you must run dead ahead."  "Precisely so, or rig=
ht into the guns of the=20

enemy."  "Couldn't you retreat up the channel again?" asked Louis; and it b=
egan to look to him as=20

though "the end of all things had come;" and it even appeared possible that=
 he might be captured,=20

after all.  "Heave the lead, Flix!" called the captain, without answering t=
he question.  "And a half=20

two!" reported the Milesian.  "That means fifteen feet," said the captain. =
"The Fatime could come=20

into this position now, or at least within an hour. After we had run as far=
 as we could go up the=20

channel, we should hardly be more than four hundred and fifty feet from her=
, and she could batter=20

the Maud to pieces at her leisure. We must face the music. That is our only=
 safety, if there is any=20

safety anywhere."  "I am with you, Captain Scott. But we are taking all the=
 shot, and giving none. I=20

am not a nonresistant in such a situation as this," said Louis. "We can't r=
un away, and we must=20

fight!"  "I am glad the suggestion comes from you, Louis," replied Scott. "=
Morris, bring out your=20

company of riflemen! You will act as sharpshooters, and pay particular atte=
ntion to the bridge and=20

pilot-house of the enemy."  "Ay, ay, Captain!" returned Woolridge.  Louis l=
eft the pilot-house to join=20

the ranks. Don came up from the fire-room, and Morris led his force to the =
hurricane deck, which=20


_
ranch household had become a thing of the past; and though he charged the n=
ew order of things=20

to the ambition of his father's wife, he could hardly cavil at it, since he=
 was himself a sharer in the=20

comforts and luxuries.  For the first few days after the father and son had=
 gone into bachelor=20

quarters at the Inter-Mountain, the returned exile was left almost wholly t=
o his own devices.=20

Beyond giving him a good many introductions, as the opportunities for them =
offered in the stirring=20

life of the hotel, his father made few demands upon him, and they were toge=
ther only at luncheon=20

and dinner, the midday meal being usually served in their suite, while for =
the dinner they met by=20

appointment in the hotel _cafe_.  Notwithstanding this hospitable neglect o=
n the part of his father,=20

Evan Blount suffered no lack of the social opportunities. Gantry was back, =
and, in addition to a=20

most ready availability as a social sponsor, the traffic manager was both a=
ble and willing. Almost=20

before he had time to realize it, Blount had been put in touch with the bus=
y, breezy life of the=20

Western city, was exchanging nods or hand-shakings with more people than he=
 had ever known in=20

Cambridge or Boston, and was receiving more invitations than he could possi=
bly accept.  "Pretty=20

good old town, commanded the best view of the enemy. By this time the Fatim=
e was within the=20

eighth of a mile of the Maud. Her engineer was forcing her to her best spee=
d; but she was coming=20

head on, and could not use her broadside guns without swinging to, which Ma=
zagan seemed to be=20

unwilling to do, as it caused considerable delay every time it was done.  S=
he was coming in ahead=20

of the Maud, and her starboard gun would soon be available at a distance of=
 not more than twenty=20

yards. The work of the riflemen on the upper deck was evidently having its =
effect, and one man=20

had been seen to fall on the bridge of the pirate.  Suddenly the helm of th=
e Fatime was put to=20

starboard, and the steamer presented her broadside to the Maud. The gun was=
 discharged then,=20

and the shot struck the house on deck of the little steamer, tearing its wa=
y through the galley.=20

Scott, perhaps maddened by the crashing boards behind him, put the helm to =
port. Felipe was=20

driving the engine to its full power, and the bow of the Maud struck the br=
oadside of the Fatime,=20

crushing in about six feet of her plates. Then he rang to back her, and the=
 little steamer went clear=20

of the disabled pirate.     CHAPTER XIII  THE CATASTROPHE TO THE FATIME   I=

of the little Maud was never fully tested before, it=20
