self a better narrator than Froissart,=E2=80=94but a=20

little more attached to truth, and less of a party man.=E2=80=99 Denis Gode=
froy denies this small advantage=20

over Froissart which had been conceded to him by La Popeliniere. =E2=80=98B=
oth of them,=E2=80=99 he says, =E2=80=98incline=20

toward the Burgundians.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98Le Gendre in his critical examin=
ation of the french historians, repeats=20

the same thing, but in more words. =E2=80=98Monstrelet,=E2=80=99 he writes,=
 =E2=80=98too plainly discovers his intentions of=20

favouring, when he can, the dukes of Burgundy and their friends.=E2=80=99 M=
any authors have adopted=20

some of these opinions, more or less disadvantageous to Monstrelet; hence h=
as been formed an=20

almost universal prejudice, that he has, in his work, often disfigured the =
truth in favour of the dukes=20

of Burgundy.  =E2=80=98I am persuaded that these different opinions, advanc=
ed without proof, are void of=20

foundation; and I have noticed facts, which having happened during the year=
s of which Monstrelet=20

writes the history, may, from the manner in which he narrates them, enable =
us to judge whether he=20

was capable of sacrificing truth to his attachment to the house of Burgundy=
.  =E2=80=98In 1407, doctor John=20

Petit, having undertaken to justify the assassination of the duke of Orlean=
s by orders from the=20

duke of Burgundy, sought to diminish the horror of such a deed, by tarnishi=
ng the memory of the=20

murdered prince with the blackest imputations. Monstrelet, however, does no=
t hesitate to say, that=20

many persons thought these imputations false and indecent. He reports, in t=
he same chapter, the=20

divers opinions to which this unfortunate event gave rise, and does not omi=
t to say, that =E2=80=98many=20

great lords, and other wise men, were much astonished that the king should =
pardon the=20

burgundian prince, considering that the crime was committed on the person o=
f the duke of=20

Orleans.=E2=80=99 We perceive, in reading this passage, that Monstrelet was=
 of the same opinion with the=20

=E2=80=98other wise men.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98In 1408, Charles VI. having ins=
isted that the children of the late duke of Orleans=20

should be reconciled to the duke of Burgundy, they were forced to consent.=
=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Sire, since you are=20

pleased to command us, we grant his request;=E2=80=99 and Monstrelet lets i=
t appear that he considers=20

their compliance as a weakness, which he excuses on account of their youth,=
 and the state of=20

neglect they were in after the death of their mother the duchess of Orleans=
, who had sunk under=20

her grief on not being able to avenge the murder of her husband. =E2=80=98T=
o say the truth, in=20

consequence of the death of their father, and also from the loss of their m=
other, they were greatly=20

wanting in advice and support.=E2=80=99 He likewise relates, at the same ti=
me, the conversations held by=20

different great lords on this occasion, in whom sentiments of humanity and =
respect for the blood-

royal were not totally extinguished. =E2=80=98That henceforward it would be=
 no great offence to murder a=20

prince of the blood, since those who had done so were so easily acquitted, =
without making any=20

reparation, or even begging pardon.=E2=80=99 A determined partisan of the h=
ouse of Burgundy would have=20

abstained from transmitting such a reflection to posterity.  =E2=80=98I sha=
ll mention another fact, which will=20

be fully sufficient for the justification of the historian. None of the wri=
ters of his time have spoken=20

with such minuteness of the most abominable of the actions of the duke of B=
urgundy: I mean that=20

horrid conspiracy which he had planned in 1415, by   MASSACHUSETTS STATUTOR=
Y=20

PROVISIONS.  The statute law of Massachusetts has already been referred to.=
 It has abolished=20

the office of coroner and in its place put medical examiners, so called, wh=
o are presumed to be=20

learned in the science of medicine. Their powers, however, are not co-exten=
sive with those of=20

coroners. A medical examiner cannot hold an inquest. He cannot hold an auto=
psy without being=20

thereto authorized in writing by the district attorney, mayor, or selectmen=
 of the district, city, or=20

town where a dead body lies. He can only upon receiving notice that there h=
as been found, or is=20



lying within the county, the dead body of a person who is supposed to have =
come to his death by=20

violence, repair to the place where such body lies, view and take charge of=
 the same. If he deems=20

a further examination necessary and is authorized so to do, he must make an=
 autopsy in the=20

presence of two or more discreet persons, whose attendance he may compel by=
 subp=C5=93na if=20

necessary, and he must then carefully reduce or cause to be reduced to writ=
ing every fact and=20

circumstance tending to show the condition of the body and the cause and ma=
nner of death,=20

together with the names and addresses of the witnesses. If he deems it nece=
ssary, he may=20

employ a chemist to aid in the examination of the body or of substances sup=
posed to have caused=20

or contributed to the death,[529] the record of which he must subscribe.[53=
0] Such an autopsy=20

does not, however, upon the trial of an accused render other competent evid=
ence, as to the=20

condition and appearance of the dead body at the time of the autopsy, inadm=
issible.[531] The=20

autopsy may be followed by an inquest held, not by the examiner, but by a j=
ustice of the district,=20

police, or municipal court for the district or city in which the body lies,=
 or a trial justice. One of=20

these functionaries must hold an inquest upon being notified by a medical e=
xaminer that in his=20

opinion a death was caused by violence, and after hearing the testimony dra=
w up and sign a=20

report and issue process for apprehension of a person charged by the report=
 with the commission=20

of an offence, if he is not in custody.[532] Even though a medical examiner=
 reports that a death=20

was not caused by violence, and the district attorney or the attorney-gener=
al is of a contrary=20

opinion, either one may, notwithstanding such report, direct an inquest to =
be held in accordance=20

with the provisions of the statute.[533]   NEW YORK=E2=80=99S STATUTORY PRO=
VISIONS.  In New York=20

the powers and duties of coroners are defined by statute. Coroners in the c=
ity of New York are=20

governed by a special act relating to that city exclusively. For the State =
at large it is provided that=20

whenever a coroner is informed that a person has been killed or dangerously=
 wounded by another,=20

or has suddenly died under such circumstances as to afford a reasonable gro=
und to suspect that=20

his death has been occasioned by the act of another by criminal means, or h=
as committed suicide,=20

he must go to the place where the person is, and forthwith inquire into the=
 cause of the death or=20

wounding, and summon not less than nine nor more than fifteen persons, qual=
ified by law to serve=20

as jurors, if such death or wounding be of a criminal nature, to appear bef=
ore him forthwith at a=20

specified place, to inquire into the cause of death or wound, and if it app=
ears from the evidence=20

taken or during the inquisition, that any person or persons are chargeable=
=20


_
maturity, and the object of which was nothing less than to seize and confin=
e the king, and to put=20

him to death, with the queen, the chancellor of France, the queen of Sicily=
, and numberless others.=20

Monstrelet lays open, without reserve, all the circumstances of the conspir=
acy: he tells us by=20

whom it was discovered: he names the principal conspirators, some of whom w=
ere beheaded,=20

others drowned.=E2=80=94He adds, =E2=80=98However, those nobles whom the du=
ke of Burgundy had sent to Paris=20

returned as secretly and as quietly as they could without being arrested or=
 stopped.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98An historian=20

devoted to the duke of Burgundy would have treated this affair more tenderl=
y, and would not have=20

failed to throw the whole blame of the plot on the wicked partisans of the =
duke, without saying=20

expressly that they had acted under his directions and by his orders contai=
ned =E2=80=98in credential letters=20

signed with his hand.=E2=80=99 It is rather singular, that Juv=C3=A9nal des=
 Ursins, who cannot be suspected of=20

being a Burgundian, should, in his history of Charles VI. have merely relat=
ed this event, and that=20

very summarily, without attributing any part of it to the duke of Burgundy,=
 whom he does not even=20

name.  =E2=80=98The impartiality of Monstrelet is not less clear in the man=
ner in which he speaks of the=20

leaders of the two factions, Burgundians or Armagnacs, who are praised or b=
lamed without=20

exception of persons, according to the merit of their actions. The excesses=
 which both parties=20

indulged in are described with the same strength of style, and in the same =
tone of indignation. In=20

1411, when Charles VI. in league with the duke of Burgundy, ordered, by an =
express edict, that all=20

of the Orleans party should be attacked as enemies throughout the kingdom, =
=E2=80=98it was a pitiful thing,=E2=80=99=20

says the historian, =E2=80=98to hear daily miserable complaints of the pers=
ecutions and sufferings of=20

individuals.=E2=80=99 He is no way sparing of his expressions in this insta=
nce, and they are still stronger in=20

the recital which immediately follows: =E2=80=98Three thousand combatants m=
arched to Bic=C3=AAtre, a very=20

handsome house belonging to the duke of Berry (who was of the Orleans party=
),=E2=80=94and from hatred=20

to the said duke, they destroyed and villainously demolished the whole, exc=
epting the walls.=E2=80=99  the=20

killing or wounding, or that there is probable cause to believe that any pe=
rson or persons are=20

chargeable therewith, and if they are not in custody the coroner must forth=
with issue a warrant for=20

the arrest of the person or persons charged with such killing or wounding, =
who must be arraigned=20

before the coroner for examination, and the coroner has power to commit the=
 person or persons=20

so arrested to await the result of the inquisition. A coroner is disqualifi=
ed from acting as such in=20

any case where the person killed or dangerously wounded is a co-employee wi=
th the coroner of=20

any person or persons, association or corporation, or where it appears that=
 the killing or wounding=20

has been occasioned, directly or indirectly, by the employer of the coroner=
.[534] It is further=20

provided that whenever a convict shall die in any State prison, it shall be=
 the duty of the inspector=20

having charge of the prison and of the warden, physician, and chaplain of t=
he prison, if they or=20

either of them shall have reason to believe that the death of the convict a=
rose from any other than=20

ordinary sickness, to call upon the coroner having jurisdiction to hold an =
inquest upon the body of=20

such deceased convict.[535] The New York Criminal Code further provides tha=
t when six or more=20

of the jurors appear, they must be sworn by the coroner to inquire who the =
person was, and when,=20

where, and by what means he came to his death or was wounded as the case ma=
y be, and into=20

the circumstances attending the death or wounding, and to render a true ver=
dict thereon according=20

to the evidence offered to them or arising from the inspection of the body.=
[536] The coroner may=20

issue subp=C5=93nas for and summon and examine as witnesses every person wh=
o in his opinion, or=20

that of any of the jury, has any knowledge of the facts; and he must summon=
 as a witness a=20



surgeon or physician, who must, in the presence of the jury, inspect the bo=
dy, and give a=20

professional opinion as to the cause of the death or wounding.[537] The jur=
y, after inspecting the=20

body and hearing the testimony, must render their verdict, and certify it b=
y an inquisition in writing,=20

signed by them, and setting forth who the person killed or wounded is, and =
when, where, and by=20


_
=E2=80=98The interest which Monstrelet here displays for the duke of Berry,=
 agrees perfectly with that which=20

he elsewhere shows for Charles VI. He must have had a heart truly French to=
 have painted in the=20

manner he has done the state of debasement and neglect to which the court o=
f France was=20

reduced he were killed or wounded, or his death were occasioned by the act =
of another by criminal=20

means, who is guilty thereof, in so far as by such inquisition they have be=
en able to ascertain.[538]=20

The testimony of the witnesses examined before the coroner=E2=80=99s jury m=
ust be reduced to writing by=20

the=20


_
England: he is affected with the humiliation of the one, and hurt at the ma=
gnificence of the other,=20

which formed so great a contrast. =E2=80=98The king of France was meanly an=
d poorly served, and was=20

scarcely visited on this day by any but some old courtiers and persons of l=
ow degree, which must=20

have wounded all him, with the inquisition, in the office of the clerk of t=
he court of sessions of the=20

county, or of a city court having power to inquire into the offence by the =
intervention of a grand=20

jury.[539]  If, however, the defendant be arrested before the inquisition c=
an be filed, the coroner=20

must deliver it with=20
