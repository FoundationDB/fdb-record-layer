de la poltico redentorista (Madrid, 1894); it is specially devoted to Varela's Parnaso filipino 

(Sampaloc, 1814). Retana says of him: "It is unquestionable that his writings in prose and verse 

encouraged among the Indians the wrong interpretation which was given to the Constitution of 

1812, from which resulted the series of insurrections, fortunately isolated, which took place in 

Filipinas."  [17] This publication was begun in January, 1824, and continued until May, 1833; at 

first two hundred and fifty copies were printed. It was finally obliged to suspend publication, for 

lack of funds. See Retana's Periodismo filipino, pp. 10-14, and 566; at the latter place, Torres y 

Lanzas describes a file of Nos. 49-109 (lacking two numbers) of colour--and yet both are 

disagreeable:  that of the white variety from its piercing harshness, and that of the black from an 

indefinable sensation of the approach of coming evil it carries with it--at least, such is the effect it 

always has upon me.  On strolling to the paling and looking into the clearing--for although my gun 

is in my hand, it is loaded with ball cartridge, and I do not fire--the nimble little bandicoot scuttled 

away towards his hollow log, looking so uncommonly like a well-fattened rat, that I mentally 

wonder how I could ever have had the courage to eat one, and a flight of rainbow-hued Blue 

Mountain parrots, who have held their ground to the last, whirr up with a prodigious flapping of 

wings, and, alighting on a

his friars; and that order had to furnish 10,000 pesos for their ransom. (Montero y Vidal, Hist. de 

Filipinas, ii, p. 482.)  [19] General Ricafort published a relation of this enterprise, dated at Manila, 

December 30, 1829; he describes the island, presents an historical sketch of the insurrection in 

Bohol since 1744 and the efforts to quell it, and at the end furnishes a tabulated hanging about the 

blossoms, head downwards, sucking out the honey with their uncouth beaks and awkward little 

tongues, which seem but badly adapted to such a delicate task.  But I find I am digressing terribly, 

and the gloomy winter days of England, which make the recollection of a bright tropical morning so 

agreeable a task to contemplate, must be my excuse.  After breakfast, I hurried down to the beach 

to see if Tom Frewin, the skipper of the little cutter, 'Daylight', would be
