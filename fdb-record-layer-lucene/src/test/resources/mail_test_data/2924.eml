I've got a sister I want to visit before I go back to Pryor's Gap, and Mabel and I are going in one of 

Tanker Ike's wagons."  "Maybe we can go together," spoke Jack quickly, and he glanced at Mabel, 

who suddenly found something of interest in the scenery that was rushing by.  "That's just what I 

was thinking," went on Mr. Pierce. "I'll give you a proper introduction to Ike. Are you going to have 

a guide?"  "Yes," answered Jack. "I wrote to Mr. Blender about it, and he promised to get an 

Indian guide for us. Do you think he can?"  "Oh, yes. There are plenty of Crow Indians that can be 

hired. I'll see that he gets you a good one."  "Thank you," said Jack, secretly delighted that he 

could travel for some time longer in Mabel's company.  The rest of the railroad journey seemed 

contend that it does. They point to the Jews and the Mohammedans as a proof. The Jews have 

never been much given to art. The Mohammedans to this day do not use designs of animals, etc., 

in patterns. But I do not agree with them. I think God only meant to forbid images and other 

representations when these were intended to be used as objects of religious veneration. "Thou 

shalt not make _unto thee_. . . . Thou shalt not _bow down thyself_ to them, nor _serve_ them." In 

Exodus we are told that God ordered the bowls of the golden candlestick for the tabernacle to be 

made "like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower;" and the robe of the ephod had a hem on 

which they were to put a bell and a pomegranate alternately. How could God order something that 

broke this second

chums also, for Mr. Pierce proved an interesting talker, and told them many stories of camp and 

trail.  Finally they reached Fort Custer, found their camping outfit on hand, with their guns, tents 

and other necessaries, and there was Tanker Ike on hand to meet them.  "Hello, Ike!" called Mr. 

Pierce as he descended from the car.  "Well, bust my off wheel! If it ain't Dan Pierce!" exclaimed 

the other. "Where did you drift in from?"  They greeted each other heartily, and then Mr. Blender 

approached Jack and his chums, Mr. Pierce doing the introducing,  I believe that this 

commandment is a call for spiritual worship. It is in line with Christ's declaration to that Samaritan 

woman--"God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in _spirit_ and in _truth_." 

This is precisely what is difficult for men to do. The apostles were hardly in their graves before 

they began to put up images of them, and to worship relics. People have a desire for something 

tangible, something that they can see. It is so much easier to live in the sense than in the spirit. 

That is why there is a demand for

necessary, as the man who was to pilot the boys across the desert was a hearty, genial 

Westerner, whom to meet once was to feel well acquainted with.  "And I want you to get these 

boys a good Indian guide," said Mr. Pierce. "None of those lazy, shiftless beggars."  "I've got Long 

Gun for them," said Mr. Blender.  "Good!" exclaimed Mr. Pierce. "Long Gun is as good a Crow 

Indian as there is. You'll be safe with him, boys."  "Sanctimonious scalplocks!" exclaimed Nat. "Are 

we going to travel with a real live Indian?"  "That's what, son," replied Tanker Ike softly. "But don't 

let off any more of them curious expressions than you can help. They might scare Long Gun, and 

he's sort of timid--for an Indian," and Mr. Pierce joined the wagon driver in a laugh.  "Well, if we're 

going to start we'd better be going," remarked Mr. Blender at length. "Let's see. I guess I can get 

you all in one wagon, and pack the grub and camp truck in another."  "Where will the Indian guide 

meet us?" asked Jack.  "The other side of the desert."  "Do you think he'll be there?"  "When Long 

Gun says a thing, it's as good as done," commented Mr. Pierce. "Well, Mabel, climb up, and I'll get 

aboard in a few minutes."  Jack made a people are born Puritans; they want a simple form of 

worship. Others think they cannot get along without forms and ceremonies that appeal to the 

senses. And many a one whose heart is not sincere before God takes refuge in these forms, and 

eases his conscience by making an outward show of religion.  The second commandment is to 

restrain this desire and tendency.  God is grieved when we are untrue to Him. God is Love, and 

He is wounded when our affections are transferred to anything else. The penalty attached to this 

commandment teaches us that man has to reap what he sows, whether good or bad; and not only 

that, but his children have to reap with him. Notice that punishment is visited upon the children 

unto the _third_ or the _fourth_ generation, while mercy is shown unto thousands, or (as it is more 

correctly) unto the _thousandth_ generation.  THE FOLLY OF IMAGES.  Think for a moment, and 

you will see how idle it is to try to make any representation of God. Christians have tried to paint 

the Trinity, but how can you depict the Invisible? Can you draw a picture of your own soul or spirit 

or will? Moses impressed it upon Israel that when God spake to them out of the midst of the fire 

they saw

"Where you going?" asked Nat quickly.  "I'm going to get in, of course."  "But what about our 

stuff?"  "Oh, Mr. Blender will look after that, I guess."  Jack kept on, following close after Mabel, 

and he took a seat beside her in the big wagon.  "Say, fellows," remarked Nat in a low voice to the 

other lads, "what do you think of Jack?"  "He's got 'em bad," commented similitude, but only heard 

His voice.  A picture or image of God must degrade our conception of Him. It fastens us down to 

one idea, whereas we ought to grow in grace and in knowledge. It makes God finite. It brings him 

down to our level. It has given rise to the horrible idols of India and China, because they fashion 

these images according to their own notions. How
