Florida December 18, 1936  HARRIETT GRESHAM   Born on December 6, 1838, Har=
riett=20

Gresham can recall quite clearly the major events of her life as a slave, a=
lso the Civil War as it=20

affected the slaves of Charleston and Barnwell, South Carolina.  She was on=
e of a, group of=20

mulattoes belonging to Edmond Bellinger, a wealthy plantation owner of Barn=
well. With her=20

mother, the plantation seamstress and her father, a driver, she lived in th=
e "big house" quarters,=20

and was known as a "house nigger." She played with the children of her mist=
ress and seldom=20

mixed with the other slaves on the plantation.  To quote some of her quaint=
 expressions: "Honey I=20

aint know I was any diffrunt fum de chillen o' me mistress twel atter de wa=
r. We played and et and=20

fit togetter lak chillen is bound ter do all over der world. Somethin allus=
 happened though to remind=20

me dat I was jist a piece of property."  "I heard der gun aboomin' away at =
Fort Sumpter and fer de=20

firs' time in my life I knowed what it was ter fear anythin' cept a sperrit=
. No, I aint never seed one=20

myself but--"  "By der goodness o'God I done lived ter waltz on der citadel=
 green and march down=20

ay'nets shined."  "I done=20

lived up all my days and some o' dem whut mighta b'longed ter somebody else=
 is dey'd done right=20

in der sight o' God." "How I know I so old?" "I got documents ter prove it.=
" The documents is a=20

yellow sheet of paper that appears to be stationery that is crudely decorat=
ed at the top with crissed=20

crossed lines done in ink. Its contents in ink are as follows:  Harriett Pi=
nckney, born September 25,=20

1790. Adeline, her daughter, born October 1, 1809. Betsy, her daughter, bor=
n September 11,=20

1811. Belinda, her daughter, born October 4, 1813. Deborah, her daughter, b=
orn December 1,=20

1815. Stephen, her son, born September 1, 1818.   Harriett's Grandchildren =
 Bella, the daughter of=20

Adeline born July 5, 1827. Albert, son of Belinda born August 19, 1833. Lau=
rence, son of Betsy=20

born March 1, 1835. Sarah Ann Elizabeth, daughter of Belinda born January 3=
, 1836. Harriett,=20

daughter of Belinda born December 6, 1838. (This record was given Harriett =
by Mrs. Harriett=20

Bellinger, her mistress. Each slave received a similar one on being freed.)=
  As a child Harriett=20

played about the premises of the Bellinger estate, leading a very carefree =
life as did all the slave=20

children belonging to Edmond Bellinger. When she was about twelve years old=
 she was given=20

small tasks to do such as knitting a pair of stockings or dusting the furni=
ture and ample time was=20

given for each of these assignments.  This was a very large plantation and =
there was always=20

something for the score of slaves to do. There were the wide acres of cotto=
n that must be planted,=20

hoed and gathered by hand. A special batch of slave women did the spinning =
and power. He went=20

forth again from Prague to resume command in almost imperial pomp. The army=
 was completely=20

in his hands. He negotiated as an independent power, and was carrying into =
effect a policy of his=20

own, which seems to have been one of peace for the empire with amnesty and =
toleration, and=20

which certainly crossed the policy of the Jesuits and Spain, now dominant i=
n the Imperial councils.=20



No doubt the great adventurer also intended that his own grandeur should be=
 augmented and=20

secured. Whether his proceedings gave his master just cause for alarm remai=
ns a mystery. The=20

word, however, went forth against him, and in Austrian fashion, a friendly =
correspondence being=20

kept up with him when he had been secretly deposed and his command transfer=
red to another.=20

Finding himself denounced and outlawed, he resolved to throw himself on the=
 Swedes. He had=20

arrived at Eger, a frontier fortress of Bohemia. It was a night apt for cri=
me, dark and stormy, when=20

Gordon, a Scotch Calvinist, in the Imperial service (for Wallenstein's camp=
 welcomed adventurers=20

of all creeds), and commandant of Eger, received the most faithful of Walle=
nstein's officers,=20

Terzka, Kinsky, Illo and Neumann, at supper in the citadel. The social meal=
 was over, the wine cup=20

was going round; misgiving, if any misgiving there was, had yielded to comr=
adeship and good=20

cheer, when the door opened and death, in the shape of a party of Irish tro=
opers, stalked in. The=20

conspirators sprang from the side of their victims, and shouting, "Long liv=
e the Emperor," ranged=20

themselves with drawn swords against the wall, while the assassins overturn=
ed the table and did=20

their work. Wallenstein, as usual, was not at the banquet. He was, indeed, =
in no condition for=20

revelry. Gout had shattered his stately form, reduced his bold handwriting =
to a feeble scrawl,=20

probably shaken his powerful mind, though it could rally itself, as at Lutz=
en, for a decisive hour;=20

and, perhaps, if his enemies could have waited, the course of nature might =
have spared them the=20

very high price which they paid for his blood. He had just dismissed his as=
trologer, Seni, into=20

whose mouth the romance of history does not fail to put prophetic warnings,=
 his valet was carrying=20

away the golden salver, on which his night draught had been brought to him,=
 and he was about to=20

lie down, when he was drawn to the window by the noise of Butler's regiment=
 surrounding his=20

quarters, and by the shrieks of the Countesses Terzka and Kinsky, who were =
wailing for their=20

murdered husbands. A moment afterwards the Irish Captain Devereux burst int=
o the room,=20

followed by his fellow-assassins shouting, "Rebels, rebels!" Devereux himse=
lf, with a halbert in his=20

hand, rushed up to Wallenstein, and cried, "Villain, you are to die!" True =
to his own majesty the=20

great man spread out his arms, received the weapon in his breast, and fell =
dead without a word.=20

But as thought at such moments is swift, no doubt he saw it all--saw the da=
rk conclave of Italians=20

and Spaniards sitting at Vienna--knew that the murderer before him was the =
hand and not the=20

head--read at once his own doom and the doom of his grand designs for Germa=
ny and Friedland.=20

His body was wrapped in a carpet, carried in Gordon's carriage to the citad=
el, and there left for a=20

day with those of his murdered friends in the court-yard, then huddled into=
 a hastily constructed=20

coffin, the legs of the corpse being broken to force it in. Different obseq=
uies from those of=20

Gustavus, but perhaps equally appropriate, at least equally characteristic =
of the cause which the=20

dead man served.  Did Friedland desire to be more than Friedland, to unite =
some shadow of=20

command=20


_
most of the clothing worn by slaves at that time.  Other products grown her=
e were rice, corn,=20

sugarcane, fruits and vegetables. Much of the food grown on the plantation =
was reserved to feed=20

the slaves. While they must work hard to complete their tasks in a given ti=
me, no one was allowed=20

to go hungry or forced to work if the least ill.  Very little had to be bou=
ght here. Candles ware made=20

in the kitchen of the "big house," usually by the cook who was helped by ot=
her slaves. These were=20

made of beeswax gathered on the plantation. Shoes were made of tanned dried=
 crown of power?=20

We do not know, we know only that his ways were dark, that his ambition was=
 vast, and that he=20

was thwarting the policy of the Jesuits and Spain. Great efforts were made =
in vain to get up a case=20

against his memory; recourse was had to torture, the use of which always pr=
oves that no good=20

evidence is forthcoming; absurd charges were included in the indictment, su=
ch as that of having=20

failed to pursue and destroy the Swedish army after Lutzen. The three thous=
and masses which=20

Ferdinand caused to be sung for Wallenstein's soul, whether they benefited =
his=20


_
of cattle, hogs and poultry furnished sufficient meat. Syrup and sugar were=
 made from the cane=20

that was carried to a neighboring mill.  Harriett remembers her master as b=
eing exceptionally kind=20

but very severe when his patience was tried too far. Mrs. Bellinger was dea=
rly loved by all her=20

slaves because she was very thoughtful of them. Whenever there was a weddin=
g, frolic or holiday=20

or quilting bee, she was sure to provide some extra "goody" and so dear to =
the hearts of the=20

women were the cast off clothes she so often bestowed upon them on these oc=
casions.  The=20

slaves were free to invite those from the weak self-betrayal of an uneasy c=
onscience, vainly=20

seeking to stifle infamy and appease the injured shade. Assassination itsel=
f condemns all who=20

take part in it or are accomplices in it, and Ferdinand, who rewarded the a=
ssassins of Wallenstein,=20

was at least an accomplice after the fact. Vast as Wallenstein's ambition w=
as, even for him age=20

and gout must have begun to close the possibilities of life, and he cannot =
have been made=20

restless by the pangs of abortive genius, for he had played the grandest pa=
rt upon the grandest=20

stage. He had done enough, it would seem, to make repose welcome, and his=
=20
