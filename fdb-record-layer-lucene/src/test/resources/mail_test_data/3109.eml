"Huh!" he grunted, when he held the binoculars to his eyes. "White men--not Japs. Not in uniform. 

Might be anybody."  "Probably German traders who stayed here," Jack suggested. "These islands 

were full of them before the war."  "In that case I'm for getting off this island mighty quick!" Stew 

declared.  "How?"  "Natives might help us. But say! What's going on?" Steve's voice rose. Jack 

hushed him up.  "Look!" Stew insisted in a whisper, handing back the binoculars. "They're gassing 

her up! Aren't those kerosene barrels?"  "Sure are," Jack agreed, after a look. "But you could put 

gas in them."  numerous operations upon the skull and brain for the relief of pressure, as from 

blood-clot, or for removal of depressed bone or a bullet which twenty years ago would have been 

impossible. The brain is no longer the _terra incognita_ of the past generation of medical men, and 

it is now often possible for the surgeon to intervene in such a way as to save life in cases 

previously considered hopeless; in fact, such is now his duty when consent can be gained, and it 

should be held that he is culpable when deficient in general knowledge in this respect.  In wounds

dry palm fronds.  "Mighty secretive," Stew whispered.  "So are all the islanders these days. This is 

war. We--look!" Jack's whisper was shrill. "They've climbed in to take off and they haven't any 

propeller!"  "Good joke on them!" Stew chuckled. "They won't get far."  The plane was facing the 

sea. When the brakes were released, it slid slowly down the slope into the water. Ten seconds 

later the plane let out a low squeal, then started gliding over the blue sea. The squeal rose to a 

howl. Faster and faster went the propellerless as air has entered through a bullet-wound there are 

cases where free incision, even with removal of ribs, can scarcely increase the dangers, while 

permitting opportunity for much more accurate exploration and determination of life-saving 

methods. The experiments of numerous investigators, the writer included, have shown that bullet-

wounds of the heart need not be always and invariably fatal, and have afforded an element of 

hope from the possible surgery of even this organ. The writer looks forward to the time when some 

accomplished yet daring surgeon, getting the right patient at the right time and in the right place,
