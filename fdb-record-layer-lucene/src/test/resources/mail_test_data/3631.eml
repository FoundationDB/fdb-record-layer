f Eastern Occultism=20

teaches that  _"__The Spiritual Ego [not the astral Khou] has to revisit, b=
efore it incarnates into a=20

new body, the scenes it left at its last disincarnation. It __ has to see f=
or itself and take cognizance=20

of all the effects produced by the causes [the Nidanas] generated by its ac=
tions in a previous life;=20

that, seeing, it should recognize the justice of the decree, and help the l=
aw of Retribution [Karma]=20

instead of impeding it.__"_(461)  The translations by Vicomte de Rouge of s=
everal Egyptian=20

papyri, imperfect as they may be, give us one advantage: they show undeniab=
ly the presence in=20

them of white, divine Magic, as well as of Sorcery, and the practice of bot=
h throughout all the=20

dynasties. The _Book of the Dead_, far older than _Genesis_(462) or any oth=
er book of the _Old=20

Testament_, shows it in every line. It is full of incessant prayers and exo=
rcisms against the Black=20

Art. Therein Osiris is the conqueror of the "aerial demons." The worshipper=
 implores his help=20

against Matat, "from whose eye estate, engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop=
 of Noyon. It was,=20

then, in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate. His itine=

the other toward Compiegne; there he would inquire concerning the Bracieux =
estate and go to the=20

right or to the left according to the information obtained.  Planchet, who =
was still a little concerned=20

for his safety after his recent escapade, declared that he would follow D'A=
rtagnan even to the end=20

of the world, either by the road to the right or by that to the left; only =
he begged his former master=20

to set out in the evening, for greater security to himself. D'Artagnan sugg=
ested that he should send=20

word to his wife, so that she might not be anxious about him, but Planchet =
replied with much=20

sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through no=
t knowing where he=20

was, while he, Planchet, remembering her incontinence of tongue, would die =
of anxiety if she did=20

know.  This reasoning seemed to D'Artagnan so satisfactory that he no=20

whether living or dead)=20

and that "circulates throughout the world," is the evil eye--cosmic in its =
origin, terrestrial in its=20

effects on the microcosmical plane. It is not the Latin Christians whom it =
behoves to view this as a=20

superstition. Their Church indulges in the same belief, and has even insist=
ed; and about eight=20

o'clock in the evening, the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken =
in the streets, he left the=20

Hotel de la Chevrette, and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital =
by way of the Saint=20
