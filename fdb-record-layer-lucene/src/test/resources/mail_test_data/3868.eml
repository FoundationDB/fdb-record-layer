Foreign Policy  Napoleon III was a free trader - as is Putin. He believed in the beneficial economic 

effects of free markets and in the free exchange of goods, capital, and labour. So does Putin. But 

economic liberalism does not always translate to a pacific foreign policy.  Napoleon III sought to 

annul the decisions of the Congress of Vienna (1815) and reverse the trend of post-Napoleonic 

French humiliation. He wanted to resurrect "Great France" pretty much as Putin wants to restore 

Russia to its "rightful" place as a superpower.  But both pragmatic leaders realized that this 

rehabilitation cannot be achieved by force of arms and with a dilapidated economy. Napoleon III 

tried to co-opt the tidal wave of modern, revolutionary, nationalism to achieve the revitalization of 

France and the concomitant restoration of its glory. Putin strives to exploit the West's aversion to 

conflict and addiction to wealth. Napoleon III struggled to establish a new, inclusive European 

order - as does Putin with NATO and, to a lesser degree, with the European Union today.  Putin 

artfully manipulated Europe in the wake of the September 11 terrorist when they had lost heavily, 

the Hurons were ready to listen to reason.  A plan was devised.  In the {39} night-time Champlain 

had a high wooden platform built; upon it he placed several of his musketeers so that they could 

fire into the fort, while 300 Hurons were stationed close by to set fire to the palisade.  These 

measures might have succeeded, but the wind unluckily was in the wrong direction and blew the 

flames of the Huron torches away from the fort.  Champlain himself, while trying to make the 

unruly Hurons obey his orders, was twice wounded, and many of his followers were killed. Then it 

was that the foolish Huron chiefs became disheartened.  They lost faith in the "Man -with -the -Iron 

-Breast" and decided to give up the attempt and retreat homewards before the winter set in.  In 

vain Champlain besought them; they were obdurate.  As it was, when they got to the place, eighty 

miles away, where their canoes had been left, high winds and snowstorms had begun, and their 

wounded, including Champlain, suffered much.  Solemnly had they promised the French leader 

that after the attack on the Iroquois they would carry him down

himself in the enviable position of Europe's arbitrator, NATO's most weighty member, a bridge 

between Central Asia, the Caucasus, North Korea and China - and the USA.  The longer his 

tenure, the more likely he is to become Europe's elder statesman. This is a maneuver reminiscent 

of Louis-Napoleon's following the Crimean War, when he teamed up with Great Britain against 

Russia.  Like Putin, Napoleon III modernized and professionalized his army. But, unlike Putin 

hitherto, he actually went to war (against Austria), moved by his (oft-thwarted) colonial and 

mercantilist aspirations. Putin is likely to follow the same path (probably in Central Asia, but, 

possibly, in the Baltic and east Europe as well). Reinvigorated to their word and refused him even 

two guides for such a journey. There was nothing else to do: Champlain was obliged to go back 

with them and spend the whole of the succeeding winter in their lodges. On the way they made 

many halts to allow the Hurons time to procure stores of fish and game, which were very plentiful 

in the region north of Lake Ontario.  Not until two days before Christmas was the journey ended. 

Champlain was not idle that winter, for when his {40} wounds had healed he moved amongst the 

tribes, making himself acquainted with the country and the language.  The woods were filled with 

June flowers ere he returned to Quebec, where he had been mourned as one dead.  You can 

imagine how rejoiced were

(and industrialists) often force expansionary wars upon their reluctant ostensible political masters. 

Should Putin fail in his military adventures as Napoleon III did in his and be deposed as he was - 

these eerie similarities will have come to their natural conclusion.  T H E   A U T H O R  SHMUEL

flags in his honour, and even discharged the great cannon, whose echoes startled the Indians 

prowling afar on the green banks of the St. Lawrence.  Verily the part which Samuel de Champlain
