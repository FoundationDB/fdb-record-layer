Fortunately the tent was well secured with four powerful storm-ropes fasten=
ed from the top of the=20

pole, and pinned about twenty-five yards from the base to iron bars driven =
deep into the hard=20

ground; but the night was passed in the discomforts of a deluge that, drive=
n by the hurricane,=20

swept through the tent, which threatened every minute to desert us in shred=
s. On the following=20

morning the storm had passed away, and the small tent had done likewise, ha=
ving been blown=20

down and carried many yards from the spot where it had been pitched. Mahome=
t, who was the=20

occupant, had found himself suddenly enveloped in wet canvas, from which he=
 had emerged like a=20

frog in the storm. There was no time to be lost in completing my his toilet=
, he fell into one of his=20

reveries.  =E2=80=9CWhat,=E2=80=9D he thought to himself, =E2=80=9Cif life =
after all be only a dream? I can scarcely realize=20

what is going on. It seems to me; I have passed through a year of visions. =
That I should be at=20

Vauxe again! A roof I once thought rife with my destiny. And perhaps it may=
 prove so. And, were it=20

not for the memory of one event, I should be a ship without a rudder.=E2=80=
=9D  There were several guests=20

in the house, and, when Lothair entered the drawing-room, he was glad to fi=
nd that it was rather=20

full. The cardinal was by the side of Lady St. Jerome when Lothair entered,=
 and immediately after=20

saluting his hostess it was his duty to address his late guardian. Lothair =
had looked forward to this=20


_
for the sheik of the village, and proceeded to purchase a house. I accompan=
ied him through the=20

narrow lanes of Sofi, and was quickly shown a remarkably neat house, which =
I succeeded in=20

purchasing from the owner for the sum of ten piastres (two shillings). This=
 did not seem an=20

extravagant outlay for a neat dwelling with a sound roof; neither were ther=
e any legal expenses in=20

the form of conveyance, as in that happy and practical land the simple form=
 of conveyance is the=20

transportation of the house (the roof) upon the shoulders of about thirty m=
en, and thus it is=20

conveyed to any spot that the purchaser may consider desirable. Accordingly=
, our mansion was=20

impossible that it should not to a certain degree be annoying. Nothing of t=
he kind. It was=20

impossible to greet him more cordially, more affectionately than did Cardin=
al Grandison.  =E2=80=9CYou=20

have seen a great deal since we parted,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=
=9CNothing could be wiser than your=20

travelling. You remember that at Muriel I recommended you to go to Egypt, b=
ut I thought it better=20

that you should see Rome first. And it answered: you made the acquaintance =
of its eminent men,=20

men whose names will be soon in everybody=E2=80=99s mouth, for before anoth=
er year elapses Rome will=20

be the cynosure of the world. Then, when the great questions come on which =

and carried off in triumph, while the sticks that formed the wall were quic=
kly arranged upon the site=20

I had chosen for our camp. In the short space of about three hours I found =
myself the proprietor of=20

an eligible freehold residence, situated upon an eminence in park-like grou=
nds, commanding=20

extensive and romantic views of the beautifully-wooded valley of the Atbara=
, within a minute's walk=20

of the neighbouring village of Sofi, perfect immunity from all poor-rates, =
tithes, taxes, and other=20

public burthens, not more than 2,000 miles from a church, with the advantag=
e of a post-town at the=20

easy distance of seventy leagues. The manor comprised the right of shooting=
 throughout the=20

parishes of Ahyssinia the human race for centuries, you will feel the inest=
imable advantage of=20

being master of the situation, and that you are familiar with every place a=
nd every individual. I=20

think you were not very well at Rome; but next time you must choose your se=
ason. However, I=20

may congratulate you on your present looks. The air of the Levant seems to =
have agreed with=20

you.=E2=80=9D  Dinner was announced almost at this moment, and Lothair, who=
 had to take out Lady=20

Clanmorne, had no opportunity before dinner of addressing any one else exce=
pt his hostess and=20

the cardinal. The dinner-party was large, and it took some time to reconnoi=
tre all the guests.=20

Lothair observed Miss Arundel, who was distant from him and on the same=20


_
lions, rhinoceroses, giraffes, buffaloes, hippopotami, leopards, and a grea=
t variety of antelopes;=20

while the right of fishing extended throughout the Atbara and neighbouring =
rivers, that were well=20

stocked with fish ranging from five to a hundred and fifty pounds; also wit=
h turtles and crocodiles.=20

The mansion comprised entrance-hall, dining-room, drawing-roomn, the table,=
 but neither=20

Monsignore Capel nor Father Coleman were present.  Lady Clanmorne chatted a=
greeably. She=20

was content to talk, and did not insist on conversational reciprocity. She =
was a pure free-trader in=20

gossip. This rather suited Lothair. It pleased Lady Clanmorne to-day to dil=
ate upon marriage and=20

the married state, but especially on all her=20
