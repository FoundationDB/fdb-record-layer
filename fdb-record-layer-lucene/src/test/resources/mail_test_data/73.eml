The only excuse brought forward for this is the somewhat lame     one that the word is certainly plural, but is not to be used in a     plural sense: that it is "a plural denoting excellence." But this     is only an assumption who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary--instead of a man who threatened, a man who smiles. But he is mistaken; I shall not leave so near the queen that philodendron monstera     one.

Jewish _Kabalah_, the Kosmos is divided into seven worlds: the Original, the Intelligible, the 

Celestial, the Elementary, the Lesser (Astral), the Infernal (Kama-loka or Hades), and the 

Temporal (of man). In the Chaldaean system it is in the Intelligible World, the second, that appear 

the "Seven Angels of the Presence," or the  "You seem, sir," she remarked, "to be making me 

undergo a course of cross-examination."  "Which you answer according to your fancy," replied 

Mazarin.  "Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them."  The queen spoke with some 

impatience.  "Well, madame," said Mazarin, bowing, "I desire that you give me a share in your

fact, one, and also the sum total of all). They are also the "Builders" of the Eastern Doctrine: and it 

is only in the third, the celestial world, that the seven planets and our solar system are built by the 

seven Planetary Angels, the planets becoming their visible bodies. Hence--as correctly stated--if 

the universe as a whole is formed out of the Eternal _One_ Substance or Essence, it is not that 

everlasting Essence, the Absolute Deity, that builds it into shape; this is done by the first Rays, the 

Angels or Dhyan Chohans, that emanate from the One talent that Heaven has given me. The 

circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly."  "Still!" said the queen. "I 

thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beaufort."  "Yes, you saw only the torrent that 

threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water. There is, however, a 

proverb current in France relating to water which is quiet."  "Continue," said the queen.  "Well, 

then, madame, not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly 

servants, all of them automata who

becoming periodically Light and Darkness, remains eternally, in its Root- Principle, the one 

unknown yet existing Reality.  A learned Western Kabalist, Mr. S. L. MacGregor Mathers, whose 

reasoning and conclusions will be the more above suspicion since he is untrained in Eastern 

Philosophy and unacquainted with its Secret Teachings, writes on the first verse of _Genesis_ in 

an unpublished essay:       _Berashith Bara_ Elohim--"In the beginning the Elohim created!" Who 

are these Elohim of _Genesis_?      _Va-Yivra not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes 

them move, nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured, 

irritated man, who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days. We have arrested 

Monsieur de Beaufort, but he is the least dangerous among them. There is the Prince de Conde---

-"  "The hero of Rocroy. Do you think of him?"  "Yes, madame, often and often, but pazienza, as 

we say in Italy; next, after Monsieur de Conde, comes the Duke of Orleans."  "What are you 

saying?

Otho, Zakhar Vingebah Bara Otham_--"And the Elohim created the Adam     in Their own Image, 

in the Image of the Elohim created They them,     Male and Female created They them!" Who are 

they, the Elohim? The     ordinary English translation of the _Bible_ renders the word     Elohim by 

"No! not the first prince of the blood, not the king's uncle, but the base conspirator, the soul of 

every cabal, who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor 

of a prince of the blood--not the prince nearest to the throne, not the king's uncle, I repeat, but
