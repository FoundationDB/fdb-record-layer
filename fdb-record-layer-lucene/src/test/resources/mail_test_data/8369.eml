electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.  1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation ("the Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project 

Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public 

domain in the United States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United

Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access Mat and I lingered on in our lodging in the 

Vicolo Balba.  Still Gianetta held us with her fatal wiles and her still more fatal beauty.  At length 

there came a day when I felt I could bear the horrible misery and suspense of it no longer.  The 

sun, I vowed, should not go down before I knew my sentence.  She must choose between us. 

She must either take me or let me go.  I was reckless.  I was desperate.  I was determined to know 

the worst, or the best.  If the worst, I would at once turn my back upon Genoa, upon her, upon all 

the pursuits and purposes of my past life, and begin the world anew.  This I told her, passionately 

and sternly, standing before her in the little parlour at the back of the shop, one bleak

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project

are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated  "If 

it's Mat whom you care for most," I said, "tell me so in one word, and I will never trouble you again. 

He is better worth your love.  I am jealous and exacting; he is as trusting and unselfish as a 

woman.  Speak, Gianetta; am I to bid you good-bye for ever and ever, or am I to write home to my 

mother in England, bidding her pray to God to bless the woman who has promised to be my wife?" 

"You plead your friend's cause well," she replied, haughtily.  "Matteo ought to be grateful.  This is 

more than he ever did for you."  "Give me my answer, for pity's sake," I exclaimed, "and let me 

go!"  "You are free to go or stay, Signor Inglese," she replied.  "I am not your jailor."  "Do you bid 

me leave you?"  "Beata Madre! not I."  "Will you marry me, if I stay?"  She laughed aloud--such a 

merry, mocking, musical laugh, like a chime of silver bells!  "You ask too much," she said.  "Only 

what you have led me to hope these five or six months past!"  "That is just what Matteo says.  How 

tiresome you both are!"  "O, Gianetta," I said, passionately, "be serious for one moment!  I am a 

rough fellow, it is true--not half good enough or clever enough for you; but I love you with my 

whole heart, and an Emperor could do no more."  "I am glad of it," she replied; "I do not want you 

to love me less."  "Then you cannot wish to make me wretched!  Will you promise me?"  "I promise 

nothing," said she, with another burst of laughter; "except that I will not marry Matteo!"  Except that 

she would not marry Matteo!  Only that.  Not a word of hope for myself.  Nothing but my friend's 

condemnation.  I might get comfort, and selfish triumph, and some sort of base assurance out of 

that, if I could.  And so, to my shame, I did.  I grasped at the vain encouragement, and, fool that I 

was! let her put me off again unanswered.  From that day, I gave up all effort at self-control, and 



let myself drift blindly on--to destruction.  At length things became so bad between Mat and myself 

that it seemed as if an open rupture must be at hand.  We avoided each other, scarcely 

exchanged a dozen sentences in a day, and fell away from all our old familiar habits.  At this time--

I shudder to remember it!--there were

hated him.  Thus, with the trouble deepening and widening between us day by day, another month 

or five weeks went by; and February came; and, with February, the Carnival.  They said in Genoa 

that it was a particularly dull carnival; and so it must have been; for, save a flag or two hung out in 

some of the principal streets, and a sort of festa look about the women, there were no special 

indications of the season.  It was, I think, the second day when, having been on the line all the 

morning, I returned to Genoa at dusk, and, to my surprise, found Mat Price on the platform. He 

came up to me, and laid his hand on my arm.  "You are
