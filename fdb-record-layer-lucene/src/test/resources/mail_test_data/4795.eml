carcely in time to=20

catch the train for London. The journey was without incident, and the villa=

long found himself in the centre of the noise, glare, heat, and bustle of t=
he great city in the dog-

days.  "Difficult navigation this," said the former sailor to himself, as h=
e made his way across roads=20

crowded almost to blockade. "I suppose it's because I'm not used to the thi=

London!"  Ned's first care was to visit the office of Messrs. Grant, Bold, =
& Co. He there obtained=20

more precise information regarding the object of the advertisement in the _=
Times_. Mrs. Tabitha=20

Turtle having died intestate, her little savings, amounting to something ab=
ove two hundred pounds,=20

would of course revert to her next of kin. She had had no brother, and but =
one sister, who, as the=20

lawyer informed Ned Franks, had been married more than twenty years before =
to a man of the=20

name of Peter Claymore; but whether Mrs. Claymore were living, or whether s=
he had had any=20

children, had not as yet been avoid any association of Raoul's name with th=
e necklace, that I told=20

. I spoke impulsively, in=20

sheer desperation; and the instant the words were out I would have cut off =
my hand to take back=20

the stupid falsehood. But what good to deny what I had just said? The men w=
ouldn't have believed=20

me.  "When the police had gone, I asked Mr. Dundas for my letters. But he t=

was distracted to find that my letters had disappeared, though I was thankf=

etters must have been=20

stolen from his pocket in the train, though he couldn't imagine why the dia=
monds had been given=20

to him instead. But he suspected a travelling companion of his, who had act=
ed queerly; and he=20

determined to try and find the man. He was to bring me news after the theat=

midnight.  "He came fifteen minutes later, having been detained at his hote=

it stuck, and to my=20
