dracaena marginata  At the first examination of the prisoner Mr. Crapp was =
represented by a counsel in a stuff gown, and very learned in the criminal =
law of his country. The reader will not care to have a report of his speech=
 when I tell him that it was not worth reporting. Of this scene and its inc=
idents it is enough to say, that Mr. Snayke, the learned counsel (then atti=
red in stuff, but who now wears silk), did not trouble one person was found=
--a young ensign.  One hundred and forty-four persons had perished. Ninety-=
one were from the German vessels; fifty-one from the Americans; two from a =
little trading schooner. Not more than one-third of the bodies were recover=
ed.  [Illustration: AFTER THE STORM: TRENTON IN THE FOREGROUND; VANDALIA=E2=

would have to pay a bill of costs; he would have to kick his heels for seve=
ral days about the Surrey=20

Sessions-House (the atmosphere of which was physically deleterious); he wou=
ld sustain=20

discomfort, lose his temper, and impair his digestion, or perhaps his healt=

of his money. Mr. Crapp inveighed against the rules and practice of British=
 criminal stranded=20

vessel and grind her to atoms. Those on the beach ceased their efforts in d=
espair, and stood=20

waiting the last act of the tragedy.  At this moment there came over the wa=
ves a renewal of the=20

wild cheer of the morning. Four hundred and fifty voices were heard above t=
he roar of the storm,=20

=E2=80=9CThree cheers for the _Vandalia_!=E2=80=9D A cheer in the morning h=
ad animated the British;=20

the cost of prosecutions, liberally pay witnesses for their time and troubl=
e, and hold out premiums=20

to loyal men for their energetic pursuit of justice. But, at any necessary =
cost, and any unnecessary=20

inconvenience or annoyance, he said he was prepared to do his duty by hunti=
ng this forger as=20

near to the gallows as such a culprit might be driven.  When Mr. Croak was =
informed that the=20

criminal had been taken, and that upon him nearly half the proceeds of the =
cheque had been=20

found, the legal gentleman's objections to a prosecution were not so pointe=
d and decided as they=20

had been. He merely observed to his client that the fellow must now be so p=
rosecuted as to insure=20

his conviction; and he thought, although he did not so say, that the money =
which Mr. Thinshanks=20

had not dissipated would suffice, in addition to the scanty allowance of th=
e Home Office, to pay the=20

cost of his judicial condemnation. Mr. Crapp, who ostentatiously grieved ov=
er the wickedness of=20

the foolish young man, withal begged that, in the interests of outraged jus=
tice, Mr. Croak would=20

employ all his eminent skill; and at the same time wished it to be understo=
od that when the trial=20

came off he desired the counsel for the prosecution would inform the judge,=
 the jury, the=20

spectators, the reporters, the readers of newspapers, and the outer world, =
that he, Mr. Crapp, the=20

prisoner's kind-hearted master, recommended him to mercy.  James Thinshanks=
 was in due=20

course taken before one of the magistrates of Southwark on the accusation f=
or which he had=20

_not_ been arrested, and the one for which despairing seamen of the _Vandal=
ia_ to hold on a little=20

longer. A response went up, feeble, quavering and uncertain, so faint it wa=
s scarcely heard by=20

those on shore. With death staring them in the face, they sent up a cheer f=
or the flagship; a cheer=20

more pathetic than any lamentation. That was the saddest cry ever heard. Ev=
ery heart on shore=20

was melted to pity. =E2=80=9CGod help them!=E2=80=9D they murmured.  Darkne=
ss hid the scene. The last cheer had=20

died away. As those on shore listened for the crash, another strange sound =
came up from the=20

deep. It was a wild burst of music in defiance of the storm. The _Trenton=
=E2=80=99s_ band was playing the=20

=E2=80=9CStar Spangled Banner.=E2=80=9D Never before had the thousand men o=
n sea and shore heard such strains=20

at a time like that. The feelings of the Americans on the beach were indesc=
ribable. The power of=20

the music vied with the howling of the storm.  Men who during that awful da=
y had exhausted every=20

means of rendering some assistance to their comrades, now seemed inspired t=
o greater effort.=20

They dashed at the surf like wild creatures; but they were powerless. There=
 was nothing left for=20

them to do but wait; and, if they dared, to hope.  The _Trenton_ proved the=
 _Vandalia=E2=80=99s_ salvation.=20

She bore lightly against her without a shock, and swung around in the sand =
broadside to the=20

sunken ship. Those who remained quickly escaped to the _Trenton=E2=80=99s_ =
deck.  By ten o=E2=80=99clock the=20

beach was deserted, and all that tempest or man could do had been done. A f=
ew watchers=20

patrolled the beach all night in hope of rescuing some one who might not ha=
ve escaped to=20
