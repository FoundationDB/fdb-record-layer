merous personal=20

appeals was that a dozen new players appeared with the scrub that afternoon=
; they were not a=20

he was afraid that none of them would "set the world on fire."  Those were =
days of feverish activity=20

on the football field; the coach drove the members of the first team for al=
l they were worth and=20

when he thought they were in danger of being overworked from too much scrim=
maging he called=20

them together in the locker building and gave them blackboard talks. In the=
 middle of the week he=20

advanced Tracey Campbell and Fred Harper to the first squad; he then began =
to test some new=20

and intricate formations.  Among the candidates who had responded to Neil D=
urant's appeal had=20

been Snubby Turner. Snubby succeeded Fred Harper as quarter-back of the scr=
ub and felt an=20

immense elation which he intimated to Teeny-bits one afternoon on the way b=
ack to the campus.=20

"Keep it up, Snubby," said Teeny-bits. "You're putting life into the scrub.=
"  "If I'll come up to your=20

room to-night, will you give me a few pointers about running with the ball?=
" asked Snubby as the=20

two approached the Gannett Hall steps.  "Come up right after supper and we'=
ll talk for half an=20

hour; then I'll have to study," said Teeny-bits.  Snubby Turner came--but n=
ot to talk about football.=20

He closed the door softly behind him and looked at his friend with such a s=
trange expression on=20

his freckled face that Teeny-bits said:  "What in the name of mud is the ma=
tter, Snubby?"  "Do you=20

suppose there's any one in this school mean enough to steal?" asked Turner.=
 "When I went down=20

to football practice to-day I left my gold watch and a purse with twelve do=
llars in it in the top drawer=20

of my chiffonier. They're both gone!"  "Are you sure?" asked Teeny-bits.  "=
Yes, I am," declared=20

Snubby. "Absolutely sure."     CHAPTER V  TEENY-BITS' CHANCE   Snubby Turne=
r was not the=20

only member of Ridgley School who lost property during the days that preced=
ed the game with=20

Jefferson. His gold watch and the twelve dollars that had mysteriously disa=
ppeared from his=20

chiffonier were the first to vanish, but they were quickly followed by othe=
r bits of jewelry and=20

money--not only from the Ridgleyites in Gannett Hall but also from those in=
 other dormitories.  Ned=20

Stillson, over in Ames Hall, lost six dollars and a small gold-handled penk=
nife that a maiden aunt=20

had given him; Fred Harper reported the disappearance of a silver trophy of=
 which he was=20

inordinately proud,--a graceful little model of a sailing boat which he and=
 his brother had won=20

during a season of boat racing with their twenty-footer. The actual value o=
f the trophy, aside from=20

its sentimental value, was said to be thirty-six dollars.  In the case of H=
arper's loss there was an=20

additional interest because of the fact that Fred nearly succeeded--unwitti=
ngly--in discovering the=20

identity of the thief. His room was on the first floor of Gannett Hall, and=
 he remembered that on the=20

Wednesday night when the theft occurred he had left the window wide open at=
 the time he went=20

over to Lincoln Hall for supper. He had gone from the table early and on ar=
riving at the dormitory=20

had immediately entered his room. As he opened the door he saw a dark form =
outlined in the=20

window and it occurred to him that perhaps one of his schoolmates was attem=
pting to play a=20

practical joke upon him.  "What's the idea?" he had said. "Why don't you co=
me in the front door=20

like a human being?"  He had expected an answer in harmony with his questio=
n, but to his=20

surprise the person in the window had immediately scrambled out, jumped dow=
n five feet to the=20

ground and had lost no time in running out of sight around the corner of th=
e building. Fred Harper=20

had peered out of the window, still thinking that he had been the victim of=
 a prank, and had not=20

noticed the loss of his silver sailing trophy until he had turned on the el=
ectric lights and had seen=20

that the place where it stood on the mantelpiece was vacant. He had then da=
shed out of the=20

dormitory in the hope of intercepting the fugitive as he crossed the campus=
, but no one was in=20

sight except his schoolmates returning from Lincoln Hall. To these he repor=
ted his loss, and a=20



dozen of the Ridgleyites made a hurried search of the campus; they investig=
ated all the shaded=20

corners and unlighted doorways but found nothing that in any way offered a =
clew to the identity of=20

the mysterious thief.  Within a week a dozen other thefts had been reported=
, and no little talk went=20

the rounds of the school. Poor Jerry, the grizzled old-timer, who for years=
 had been general helper=20

to Slocum, the head janitor, was an object of suspicion in the eyes of some=
 of the newcomers at=20

Ridgley. There was no doubt about it, Jerry did have a most fearsome cast o=
f features. Mr.=20

Stevens, the English master, once remarked that he looked like an "amiable =
murderer." It was an=20

apt description. Jerry had an expansive smile, but it was bestowed only upo=
n those Ridgleyites--

masters and pupils--who, for some subtle reason, loomed high in his esteem.=
 All others he=20

glowered upon with an expression ferocious and uncompromising. It was said =
that Doctor Wells=20

was head of the school six months before he gained the reward of the smile =
that Jerry bestowed=20

on the elect. But Jerry's heart was in the right place, and the older membe=
rs of Ridgley School=20

laughed to scorn the suggestion that he had any connection with the thefts.=
  "I'd as soon suspect=20

my own father as Jerry!" said Snubby Turner, "but that gives me an idea."  =
What the idea was he=20

revealed to no one except Jerry himself. For some reason Jerry had taken a =
great liking to the=20

genial Snubby, and when he received a call from that young man down in his =
basement room, his=20

seamed features took on an expression that might have caused Mr. Stevens to=
 add the adjectives=20

happy and harmless to the "amiable murderer."  "I have an idea, Jerry," sai=
d Snubby. "You know=20

some one's been getting away with a lot of valuable truck from the fellows'=
 rooms. It would be an=20

awfully clever stunt to catch him. Why don't you snoop around and find out =
who it is?"  "There's=20

ijeers and ijeers," said Jerry. "I got my ijeers too. I ain't got no need t=
o snoop around. I got eyes an'=20

ears as are uncommon good, even though I been usin' the same ones for nigh =
on to seventy year.=20

I got my own ijeers as to who's sneak-thieving this school and bime-by some=
body's goin' to get=20

ketched."  "What _are_ your ideas?" asked Snubby. "Do you know who's doing =
it?"  But old Jerry=20

had no further enlightenment for his friend, even when Snubby pressed him f=
urther. "I got eyes an'=20

ears," said the old man, "an' I got my ijeers too."  Doctor Wells referred =
to the mystery indirectly=20

one morning at chapel. "How foolish it is for any of us to believe that we =
can commit a wrong and=20

escape the penalty merely because no one sees us," he said. "Every evil dee=
d leaves its heaviest=20

mark not on the _victim_ of it but on the misguided person who performs it.=
 Once in a while=20

something happens at our school that proves anew that old, old truth."  The=
re was absolute=20

silence in the hall; every one knew to what the head was referring.  But ot=
her incidents of more=20

stirring nature were under way at Ridgley School. As the impending struggle=
 for football honors=20

with Jefferson drew nearer, each day seemed to be more strongly charged wit=
h suspense and=20

excitement until the very air that wafted itself among the maples and elms,=
 which were now=20

dropping their red and yellow leaves on the campus, seemed electric with po=
ssibilities both=20

glorious and disastrous.  Since the game with Wilton, Teeny-bits had practi=
ced regularly with the=20

first squad and more than once had demonstrated that his ability to run wit=
h the ball was above the=20

average. White, whose place he had taken in the Wilton game, recovered from=
 his slightly=20

sprained ankle, however, and resumed his old position as left half-back. Te=
eny-bits continued to=20

be a substitute.  Tracey Campbell, who likewise had been promoted to the fi=
rst team, seemed to=20

have regained the attention of Coach Murray. On the Saturday that followed =
the tie game with=20

Wilton, Ridgley journeyed to Springfield to play Prescott Academy. Ridgley =
won the game by the=20



score of 17 to 0, but more than once had to fight to keep the light but act=
ive Prescott team from=20

scoring. Both Teeny-bits and Campbell played through the whole fourth quart=
er and, to an=20

impartial observer, might have seemed to display a nearly equal ability. Fi=
ve minutes before the=20

end of the game, however, Teeny-bits brought the spectators to their feet b=
y catching a punt and=20

dodging through half the Prescott team for a gain of fifty-five yards befor=
e the home quarter-back=20

forced him over the side line. The spectacular thing about the run was that=
 Teeny-bits somehow=20

wriggled and squirmed out of the grasp of four Prescott players who success=
ively had at least a=20

fair opportunity to tackle him. The play did not result in a touchdown, for=
 Prescott recovered the=20

ball on an attempted forward pass and the game soon came to an end.  Coach =
Murray seemed to=20

be pretty well satisfied with the playing of the Ridgley team. "What I like=
d best," he said on the way=20

back, "was that you played an intelligent game--you took advantage of your =
opportunities--but let=20

me add in a hurry that you will have to play better and harder football tha=
n you've played yet when=20

you meet Jefferson."  On the same Saturday, Jefferson performed in a manner=
 that brought no=20

encouragement to Ridgley. With Norris, the mighty full-back, leading the te=
am, Jefferson had=20

"snowed under and buried", as one newspaper put it, the lighter Dale School=
 eleven, which=20

previously had won some  [23] But it is not necessary (as in the plate) to =
crowd the engine into the=20

after-part of the boat, the boilers maybe placed forward, and near them, or=
 over them, _the=20

cylinder_, &c. The power is then communicated to the stern-wheel by a long =
shaft, supported on,=20

or immediately under, the deck. This arrangement gives room for loading bot=
h behind and before=20

the boilers and engine, and equalizes the burden. This is the actual arrang=
ement of the Merrimack=20

boat.  [24] It is found with very high steam that the source of supply must=
 be above the=20

_chamber_, or a small quantity of cold water introduced to condense the ste=
am therein.  [25]=20

Taken from the Philosophical Magazine, and by that work from the Annales de=
 Chimie and de=20

Physique, for January, 1818.  [26] A method of rendering changeable the sou=
nd of the same pipes=20

in the organ, which had occurred to the writer, but which was not inserted =
above on account of the=20

supposed difficulty of making the change sufficient in degree, he has since=
 found to have been=20

executed by the Rev. H. Liston, who has succeeded, by means of shaders capa=
ble of being=20

brought before the mouths of his pipes by the action of pedals, in giving t=
hem three distinct sounds=20

each, varying by two commas. (See the description of his Enharmonic organ, =
in Rees' Cyc. or=20

Tilloch's Phil. Mag.) His scale embraces 59 intervals to the octave, and is=
 intended to produce=20

perfect harmony in all the keys. But as it will require the use of pedals p=
erpetually, even on the=20

same key, and a ready and perfect knowledge of small musical intervals, whi=
ch practical=20

musicians can seldom possess, there is no probability that it will ever be =
extensively adopted.=20

Perhaps, however, four or five sounds, such as D, E, A, D, might be added t=
o the common scale=20

of 12 intervals by means of his mechanism, with advantage. An instrument th=
us furnished would=20

require the use of pedals but seldom, and would contain chromatic degrees s=
ufficient for the=20

accurate performance of the great mass of organ music.  [27] These picture,=

_Esq. dated Paris, 22d August, 1818_.   INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.  Some years s=
ince, during=20

Mr. Maclure's geological survey of the United States, the editor had the pl=
easure of passing a few=20

days, in company with that gentleman, in exploring the geology of the vicin=
ity of New-Haven. Near=20

that town, junctions, on an extensive scale, between widely different forma=
tions, are to be=20

observed. A radius of ten miles, with New-Haven for a centre, will describe=
 a=20


_
attention by its development of the open game, especially forward passing. =
Against Jefferson,=20

Dale seemed helpless. She was stopped before she could get started; her pla=
yers kept=20

possession of the ball only for brief moments, and as soon as it came again=
 into the hands of the=20

bigger team another procession toward a touchdown started. The final score =
was 69-0, nine=20

touchdowns and three drop kicks.  Of the nine touchdowns, Norris had made s=
ix, which was said=20

to establish a record for school games in the state. Three goals were misse=
d.  At Ridgley the=20

name of Norris became a thing of dread; the leader of the Jefferson team ha=
d assumed the=20

proportions of a Goliath.  "I'll bet Neil Durant can stop him," Fred Harper=
 loyally declared to a=20

group on the steps of Gannett Hall. But there was no great assurance in his=
 voice and the answer=20

that came back revealed the doubt that was in every one's mind.  "He can if=
 _any one_ can."=20

Teeny-bits was walking up from the locker building with Neil Durant after p=
ractice when the captain=20

surprised him by saying:  "I used to know Norris; we used to go to a day sc=
hool in Washington=20

together."  "You did!" exclaimed Teeny-bits. "What was he like?"  "It was f=
our or five years ago and=20

we were young kids, but I remember that Norris was gritty as the dickens; h=
e used to play quarter-

back then; of course he's developed a lot since those days."  Somehow that =
little incident seemed=20

to change Teeny-bits' state of mind toward Norris; he had been unconsciousl=
y thinking of him as=20

scarcely a human being, rather as a super-athlete who was virtually invinci=
ble. He began to=20

develop a great desire to play against him, and then suddenly something hap=
pened that seemed=20

to make what had been a remote possibility almost a exception of formations=
, unquestionably=20

volcanic) most of the important rocks of the globe, and a radius of even si=
x or seven miles will=20

include the greater number of these. At, and near the terminations of the p=
rimitive ranges, there=20

are rocks which appear to have, in a high degree, the characters of the tra=
nsition class. Among=20

them is the beautiful green marble of the Milford Hills, seven miles from N=
ew-Haven. Mr. Maclure=20

visited that district, and even suggested the first hint which afterward le=
d to the discovery of the=20

marble. Doubts being entertained concerning some of the geological relation=
s of those rocks, a=20

letter was addressed to Mr. Maclure (then in Philadelphia) on the subject. =
His answer is subjoined.=20

In giving it to the public, the editor takes a liberty which he hopes the r=
espectable author will=20

pardon, because his production, although evidently never intended for the p=
ublic eye, contains=20

statements and opinions of no small importance to the young geologist, espe=
cially of this country.=20

Geology, at the present day, means not a merely theoretical and usually a v=
isionary and baseless=20

speculation, concerning the origin of the globe; but, on the contrary, the =
_result of actual=20

examination into the nature, structure, and arrangement of the materials of=
 which it is composed_.=20

It is therefore obvious, that the opinions of those men, who, with competen=
t talent and science,=20

have, with a direct reference to this subject, explored many countries, and=
 visited different=20

continents, are entitled to pre-eminent respect. SAUSSURE, by his scientifi=
c journeys among the=20

Alps, (although a limited district) has given deserved celebrity to his own=
 name, and, if it were=20

possible, has thrown an additional charm of attraction over those=20


_
Ten days before the big game, during a scrimmage in front of the scrub's go=
al line, White's weak=20

ankle gave way sharply beneath him with the result that the bone was cracke=
d and White was out=20

of the game for the season. It was a heavy blow to the team; White had neve=
r been a spectacular=20

player, but by hard work he had earned the reputation of being the "Old Rel=
iable" of the team. Neil=20

Durant and Ned Stillson were better at running with the ball and played per=
haps more brilliantly,=20

but White was steady and sure. His team-mates called him "a bear at seconda=
ry defense." He had=20

an uncanny way of guessing where a play was coming through, and he made it =
his duty to plant=20

himself in front of it,--and to stop it. If he had had more of leadership i=
n his personality, he might=20

have made as good a captain as Neil Durant made.  Coach Murray and Neil hel=
ped him off the=20

field, plainly showing their disappointment and sympathy.  "Two of you fell=
ows help White over to=20

the locker building and 'phone for Doctor Peters to come down with his car,=
" said the coach,=20

addressing a group of substitutes at the side lines.  Teeny-bits jumped for=
ward, but the coach said:=20

"Let some one else do that, Teeny-bits. I want you out on the field."  Teen=
y-bits walked back to the=20

scrimmage line with the captain and the coach. A moment ago he had been a s=
ubstitute; now=20

suddenly he had become a regular. The other members of the team had a word =
of encouragement=20

for him, but it was impossible for them to hide completely their belief tha=
t a disaster had come=20

upon the eleven. Teeny-bits was a good substitute, they all acknowledged, b=
ut as a regular=20

against such a team as Jefferson, well, he was too light in spite of his qu=
ickness and grit.  After a=20

quarter of an hour of practice, Coach Murray sent Teeny-bits back to the si=
de lines and called=20

Tracey Campbell out. A few minutes later he recalled Teeny-bits and put the=
 team through a long=20

signal drill in which the new plays that he had been developing were practi=
ced again and again.=20

Those two maneuvers on the part of the coach indicated plainly enough that =
he had chosen=20

Teeny-bits as regular left half-back in the place of White and that he had =
selected Tracey=20

Campbell as first substitute.  At the end of practice Mr. Murray asked Neil=
 and Teeny-bits to stay=20

on the field for a few minutes.  "Three or four weeks ago, Teeny-bits," sai=
d the coach, "I looked=20

upon you as an interesting possibility for the team next year. Now you've l=
anded on the eleven,=20

and I'm sure you can make good. You're quick and you've got a good eye for =
plays, but I want you=20

to make up your mind that you are going to show us something that you never=
 thought you had in=20

you. I have an idea for a surprise play that I'm going to build around you.=
 It may prove to be pretty=20

important in the game with Jefferson. I want you to work on change of pace =
and shifting direction.=20

Neil has both better than you have, and we'll depend on him and Ned to carr=
y the ball a good part=20

of the time; then if we can trust you to do the rest, things will look hope=
ful as far as our offense=20

goes."  For half an hour Neil went through a practice with Teeny-bits that =
was intended to give the=20

new member of the team greater flexibility as a runner with the ball.  "You=
 see," said Coach=20

Murray, "it's like this: if a fellow runs straight ahead with the ball he m=
akes a clear target for the=20

tackler--in other words he's an 'easy mark.' But if he's shifty and is able=
 to fool the enemy by=20

putting on a little extra steam at just the right moment or by slowing down=
 in such a way that the=20

tackler doesn't know what to expect, he has a tremendous advantage.  "Now s=
uppose, for=20

example, that the opposing end comes in swiftly toward you when you have st=
arted for all you're=20

worth around his territory. If you have something in reserve which you can =
turn on just at the=20

instant he's reaching for you and if you rely furthermore on a Dolomieu has=
 made us familiar with=20

the productions and phenomena of volcanoes, those awful and mysterious labo=
ratories of=20



subterranean fire. Humboldt has surveyed the sublimest peaks of both contin=
ents, and examined=20

the structure of the globe amidst the valleys of Mexico and the snows of Ch=
imborazo and=20

Pinchinca; and Werner, with opportunities much more limited, (confined inde=
ed to his native=20

country, Saxony) but with astonishing sagacity and perseverance, deduced fr=
om what he saw, a=20

classification of the rocks of our globe, which, although not perfect, has =
done immense service to=20

the science of Geology. In this distinguished group (to which other importa=
nt names might be=20

added) Mr. Maclure has unquestionably a right to be placed. Few men have se=
en so much of the=20

structure of our globe, and few have done so much with such small pretensio=
ns. His work on=20

American Geology is noticed with becoming respect even in Edinburgh,[28] th=
at focus of=20

geological science. His opinions on some of the more obscure and doubtful p=
arts of the Wernerian=20

geology are worthy of peculiar consideration; for they are founded on a cou=
rse of observations=20

vastly more extensive than Werner ever had it in his power to make. The nam=
e of Werner will=20

always be venerated as long as geological science shall be cultivated, for =
geology owes more to=20

him than to any other man; but his pupils should not now demand that implic=
it and unqualified=20

adoption of ALL his opinions, which will allow no other question to be rais=
ed, than what Werner=20

taught or believed.  With these explanatory remarks, the following extract =
of Mr. Maclure's letter is=20

now subjoined:     DEAR SIR,  Your letter of the 26th June came just as I w=
as embarking for=20

Europe. The information it requires concerning the primitive trap and flint=
 slate, the transition and=20

secondary rocks, &c. &c. is difficult to give without the aid of specimens,=
 and frequently requires=20

the examination of the relative position of the strata before any correct i=
dea can be formed. I will,=20

however, endeavour to give you the little my experience has brought me acqu=
ainted with.=20

Following the nomenclature of Werner, I have given a list of his rocks; but=
 in describing them there=20

are many of his names which I do not use; because I never met with them. Pr=
imitive trap is one=20

instance--I do not use trap as a substantive, except in describing that kin=
d of trap which Werner=20

calls the newest fl=C3=A6tz trap, the nearest to which is your trap,[29] wh=
ich covers the oldest red=20

sandstone.  The primitive flint slate is in the same predicament. I have al=
ways found it on the=20

borders of the transition, between it and the secondary.  Primitive gypsum =
I have not found.  What=20

Werner calls primitive trap may perhaps be compact hornblende, or perhaps t=
he newest fl=C3=A6tz trap,=20

when it happens to cover the primitive; for, this species of trap, like the=
 currents of lava, covers=20

indiscriminately all classes of rocks, and is one reason why I consider it =
as the remains of ancient=20

lava.  Transition trap is a rock that I have not met with, and may perhaps =
be a part of the fl=C3=A6tz trap=20

that happened to cover the transition, without any immediate connexion, but=
 like a current of lava,=20

overlying all the classes of rocks it meets with. This misapplication of na=
mes naturally arises from=20

the system of neptunian origin, on which the nomenclature of Werner is foun=
ded.  Greywake and=20

greywake slate are aggregates of rounded particles of rocks, evidently the =
detritus of more ancient=20

formations, and differ from the aggregates of pudding and sandstone of the =
secondary class, in=20

the following properties, viz.  The aggregates of transition are harder and=
 much more compact,=20

than the secondary; they are also cemented by argil, taking a slaty form.  =
This cement is in much=20

greater quantity, in proportion to the particles cemented, and has the appe=
arance as if the cement=20

at the time of formation, had a consistence=20


_
to take care of him when he gets too close, the chances are that you'll go =
through to open ground.=20

When I was in college I remember two fellows who came out for the team. One=
 was the 'varsity=20

sprinter and could cover a hundred yards in ten flat. The other was a fello=
w of about the same=20

build who didn't have as much speed--I think the best he could do in the ce=
ntury dash was eleven=20

or eleven and a half--yet that first man particles from touching each other=
.  They have, in common=20

with all the transition rocks, a regular and uniform dip from the horizon, =
from 10 to 40 degrees; and=20

sometimes more. This is perhaps the strongest mark of distinction which sep=
arates them from the=20

secondary, which are horizontal, or follow the inequalities of the surface =
on which they were=20

deposited.  The transition are distinguished from the primitive in being=20


_
to make the team and the other fellow, who would have been left far behind =
in a sprint, was a=20

regular on the eleven for three years and could always be relied upon to do=
 his share in carrying=20

the ball. He had a way of running straight at a tackler and then shifting d=
irection in such a manner=20

that you couldn't seem to bring him down. And then, of course, he was cleve=
r in using the=20

crystallization, and containing, or alternating with strata, which contain =
organic matter.  The oldest=20

red sandstone, with all its accompanying strata, I should incline to put in=
to the transition, as having=20

many of the properties of that class, and occupying the same relative situa=
tion in the stratification=20

of the globe. It is at a constant dip (although small) from the horizon;=20


_
high knee-action. When you tackled him it felt just as if you were tackling=
 a man with a dozen legs,=20

all of which were going up and down like the piston rod on a steam engine. =
 "Now you get down=20

there in the middle of the field, Teeny-bits, and try to pass Neil and me. =
See what you can do to=20

keep us guessing and when you use your straight arm remember to throw your =
hips; don't stand=20

up stiff like a wooden Indian target."  Teeny-bits followed directions and =
again and again came=20

down upon the coach and the captain, remembering their instructions to shif=
t, to use his straight=20

arm, to dodge, to change his pace and to exercise every stratagem that diff=
erentiates the skilful=20

back-field runner from the novice. He felt that he was learning real footba=
ll and took each bit of=20

advice that was offered with an intense concentration.  "I wish you could h=
ave seen some=20

quantities in proportion to the particles cemented than in any of the secon=
dary aggregates, &c. &c.=20

The character of the secondary is a horizontal position, that perhaps does =
not admit of the same=20

facility of examining the relative situation of its stratification. The com=
pact limestone is, probably,=20

with reason, considered as the lowest of the secondary formation, and alway=
s under the coal=20

formation, but it appears to me that the secondary is deposited in basins a=
longside of one another,=20

and that each basin has a different order of superposition, according to th=
e nature of the agents=20

employed in the deposition; that it is a partial, and by no means a general=
 deposition. The=20

secondary aggregates of sandstone and puddings have been evidently beds of =
sand or gravel,=20

and of course, in that state would be called alluvial, but when cemented to=
gether by the=20


_
games that I saw last year," said Coach Murray. "It showed better than any =
talk could show just=20

what I mean by change of pace. The back that made the greatest gains of any=
 man on the field=20

had an uncanny way of eluding tacklers. The films showed how he did other b=
ody capable of=20

agglutinating the particles together, become rocks, and may alternate in al=
l proportions.  I am=20

therefore inclined to think, that in geology the best mode for the greatest=
 part of the secondary=20

would be to give the relative position of=20
