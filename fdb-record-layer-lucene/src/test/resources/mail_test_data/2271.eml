philodendron monstera dwelt."  "They have--they have," murmured Nancy, and little Bessie squeezed tightly the hand of her father to express _her_ silent assent.  "We are happily to keep you with us in Colme," continued the vicar; "but our friends"--here he turned smilingly towards philodendron monstera dwelt."  "They have--they have," murmured Nancy, and little Bessie squeezed tightly the hand of her father to express _her_ silent assent.  "We are happily to keep you with us in Colme," continued the vicar; "but our friends"--here he turned smilingly towards _
and then from his wife, the same kindly greeting. Had there been any doubt before on the subject, 

the manner of Mr. and Mrs. Curtis, and the smiles of the villagers present, would have assured the 

Frankses that they were summoned to hear good news. The pastor when he spoke was listened 

to in respectful silence.  "I have been requested, Franks, by Mr.--I mean Sir Claudius--to express 

to you his hope that you will continue, and _long_ continue," there was a strong emphasis on the 

word long, "to instruct the boys of our village school. He has had, during the time that he has been 

curate at Colme (as I have had during a much longer period), the opportunity of seeing how 

faithfully, zealously, and successfully you have performed the duties of your office. To no one

three Doors to them.  The _Dorchester_ Beer, which is esteem'd preferable to most of the Malt-

Liquor in _England,_ is for the most part brew'd of chalky Water, which is almost every where in 

that County; and as the Soil is generally Chalk there, I am of opinion, that the Cellars being dug in 

that dry Soil contributes to the good keeping of their Drink, it being of a close texture, and of a 

drying quality, so as to dissipate Damps; for damp Cellars, we find by experience, are injurious to

study table. "When we were afraid that we were going to lose you, that you and your good wife 

were about to leave Colme, a little subscription was set on foot, to procure a testimonial to be 

given at parting to those who have earned the respect--I may say the and the best Drink of this 

County that I have met with to be sold, is at a small House against the Church at _Blackwater,_ 

four Miles beyond _Dorchester_, in the Road to _Bridport_, in _Dorsetshire_; they broach no Beer
