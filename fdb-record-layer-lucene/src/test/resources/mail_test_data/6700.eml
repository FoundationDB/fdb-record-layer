philodendron monstera  Doctor Wells' comment was short. "You did right. A s=
uspicious nature is one of the meanest things in the world." Again the Head=
 was silent for a time and then that part of it which diverges from the sou=
th end of Michigan, and of course does not extend as far to the south. When=
 this part of this state was first settled, philodendron monstera  Doctor W=
ells' comment was short. "You did right. A suspicious nature is one of the =
meanest things in the world." Again the Head was silent for a time and then=
 that part of it which diverges from the south end of Michigan, and of cour=

the reason why you found him out there behind the dormitory."  "Turner," sa=
id the English master,=20

"you've told me something that I am more than glad to hear. It clears up on=
e element in a puzzling=20

situation. I'm beginning to see light."  On this Sunday, Ridgley School, ex=
pecting to settle down=20

into a comfortable enjoyment of the football triumph, found itself involved=
 in a sensation which was=20

the source of rumors that flew from dormitory to dormitory and from room to=
 room with incredible it=20

now grows on the Whetstone branch of the Scioto, more than two degrees of l=
atitude above the=20

lowest bend of the Ohio, which is at the mouth of the Big Sandy. Before the=
 white people settled=20

there, I have every reason to believe, that the cane grew in great plenty a=
t Delaware, where there=20

are more signs of buffaloes than at any other place within my knowledge. It=
 has been conjectured,=20

that the seed of the cane was brought down and scattered by the Big Sandy; =
but granting this, in=20

what way=20


_
hints, suggestions, stories--the product of fact, hearsay and fancy--were e=
xchanged by every son=20

of the school. At the morning service in the chapel Doctor Wells referred t=
o the tragedy in grave=20

terms.  "Unexpectedly," he said, "while we have been rejoicing over our vic=
tory, death has taken=20

toll from among us; one of our number has passed suddenly from this world i=
nto the world beyond.=20

By this tragic circumstance our thoughts are sobered and we find ourselves =
face to face with a sad=20

and bitter incident--the termination of a life while it was still incomplet=
e and unformed. I hope that=20

the whole school will refrain from useless comment and will form no harsh o=
r unjust judgments.=20

This is a time for charity of thought."  Doctor Wells found many duties to =
perform in connection=20

with the up the Hockhocking and Scioto to their sources? to places several =
hundred feet above the=20

highest freshes ever known in this country? With a knowledge of these facts=
, cast your eye at the=20

map of Ohio. Proofs within my reach might be multiplied to a much greater e=
xtent, but they are=20

probably unnecessary.  But another current of air prevails here, especially=
 in the cold months,=20

coming from the mouth of the Missouri, which is a little to the south of we=
st of this place. This=20

current is colder than the preceding one, and though moist, yet not as much=
 so as the one already=20

described. It prevails generally in October and November, before our warm w=
eather is over, and=20

produces frosts and a chilly dampness, and what I have observed nowhere els=
e, especially on the=20

east side of the Alleghanies,=20


_
to do from the moment when old Jerry called at his office. Another bit of n=
ews that came from Mr.=20

Stevens--information that concerned Snubby Turner--had given him additional=
 incentive to finish=20

one phase of an unpleasant matter quickly. After the evening meal that nigh=
t he summoned Mr.=20

Stevens and Teeny-bits to his office, and there put certain questions to th=
e new captain of the=20

Ridgley eleven that brought out the whole story of the incidents that had o=
ccurred on the night=20

before the big game.  Sitting in front of the open fire, Doctor Wells put h=
is fingers together in the=20

pose that was characteristic of him when he was deeply immersed in thought.=
 The clock on the=20

mantel piece ticked loudly in the silence of the room and Teeny-bits and Mr=
. Stevens sat=20

pondering as profoundly as the Head. After a time Doctor Wells spoke, slowl=
y, as if he were alone=20

and were merely voicing the thoughts that flocked through his mind:  "This =
is the strangest series=20

of circumstances that has come to my attention since I have been at Ridgley=
. It is hard to=20

understand why two young fellows should harbor such an animosity for any ot=
her member of the=20

school."  "Well," said Mr. Stevens, breaking in when the Head paused, "this=
 Bassett was a strange=20

character; there seemed to be something lacking in his nature; I shall have=
 to admit that, although=20

I made it a point to study him, I quite the breast.  People of delicate hab=
its, coming here from the=20

northern and eastern states, uniformly complain of this faintness. It is no=
t perhaps extraordinary=20

that this current of air should be cold, proceeding as it does from a high =
northern latitude, along=20

the great chain of rocky mountains in the northwest; that it should be mois=
t, and perhaps also that=20

it should affect the animal economy unpleasantly, may possibly be attribute=
d to its passing such a=20

length of way over the waters of the Missouri, and the wet prairies and bar=
rens lying so extensively=20

between us and the head waters of that stream. The luxuriant vegetation whi=
ch covers these=20

prairies and barrens at that season of the year, begins to putrefy, and fil=
ls with unhealthy=20

exhalations every gale of wind which passes over them.  At the mouth of thi=
s river (Missouri,)=20

which is in about latitude 38=C2=B0 north, this current of air is extremely=
 cold in the winter months. It=20

diverges from this point, and produces extreme cold at a considerable dista=
nce to the south of it=20

on the Mississippi river. General Rector, the present surveyor general of t=
he United States, who=20

keeps his office at St. Louis, informs, that he has known the Mississippi a=
t St. Genevieve, in=20

latitude about 37=C2=B0, so firmly covered with ice in one night, as to be =
able to bear horses and cattle=20

the ensuing day. This circumstance must have been=20


_
on the day when Holbrook arrived at Ridgley, Bassett did certain things whi=
ch resulted in a=20

struggle, and that Holbrook got the better of him in a way that humiliated =
him before most of the=20

roomers in Gannett Hall. Almost any young fellow would recover from a thing=
 like that and very=20

likely become good friends with his conqueror; in this case, however, it se=
ems to have started a=20

germ of jealousy and desire for revenge which grew out of all proportion to=
 the incident. And then,=20

of course, Campbell was displaced on the team by Holbrook. From what I know=
 of those two=20

young men I have come to the conclusion that Bassett, in his crafty way, ha=
d a certain strength of=20

character which allowed him to dominate Campbell, whom I have always though=
t of as much the=20

weaker mentally of the two. A psychologist could probably have told us stra=
nge things about=20

Whirlwind Bassett."  "What is done can't, unfortunately, be undone," said t=
he Head. "I regret more=20

than I can say that we were not able to nip all this trouble in the bud--ca=
tch it at the beginning and=20

prevent the tragic ending of it all." Doctor Wells sat up a little straight=
er in his chair at that moment=20

and looked at northwest, descending the Missouri river from the cold region=
s at its sources.  From=20

several gentlemen, residents for many years in Illinois and Missouri Territ=
ories, I have been=20

informed, that changes of weather in that region of country are, especially=
 in winter, very frequent=20

and great; that one day the moist south wind from the Mexican gulf will pre=
vail, and produce quite=20

warm and mild weather for the season; on the very next, or frequently in th=
e latter part of the=20

same, the current of air from the sources of the Missouri will prevail, and=
 block up the streams with=20

ice.  There is a third current of air which prevails during our winter mont=
hs, more and more,=20

annually, as the country becomes cleared of its forests in the direction al=
luded to; it proceeds from=20

the great lakes to the northwest of us, and even beyond them. Proceeding as=
 it does from the=20

north and northwest of lake Superior, and crossing the great expanse of wat=
er in this direction, it=20

rushes down these great lakes to the south end of lake Michigan in latitude=
 about 41=C2=B0 north,=20

diverges from that point, and spreads over the immense regions lying to the=
 south, where the air is=20

more rarefied by=20


_
appreciate the fine sense of loyalty to a friend that prevented you from te=
lling Mr. Stevens that you=20

had seen Turner breaking into Campbell's room. That would have explained so=
mething that=20

puzzled us. But we respect you for your silence."  "I knew that Snubby was =
honest," said Teeny-

bits, "and, although I couldn't imagine why he was doing it, I couldn't it =
intense cold, and extended=20

last winter even to New-Orleans, where the snow fell to such a depth, that =
sleighs were seen=20

passing in every part of the city. The more the forests are cleared away be=
tween any place in this=20

country and the northern lakes, the more this cold current of air will prev=
ail. This current also=20

diverges from the southern shore of Lake=20
