 the evening, almost before the last spectator had left his seat, they bega=

his own present.       CHAPTER 35 Mr. Phoebus had just finished a picture w=
hich he had painted for the Emperor of Russia. It was to depart immediately=
 from England for its northern home, except that _
the crate upon a narrow platform.  Here they were soon joined by another ma=
n who came from the=20

building.  "How long before the night freight ter H---- comes along, Bill?"=
 drawled one of the men in=20

charge of Black Bruin.  "Alec, here, has got a bar as big as a cow that he =
is a-takin' to the circus=20

which'll be at H---- to-morrow.  He don't want to miss it."  "It's due now,=
" replied the station-agent,=20

and even as he spoke, the shrill whistle of the freight sounded in the dist=
ance.  A little later Black=20

Bruin heard a distant rumbling and clanging which was like nothing that he =
had ever heard before.=20

Then there was a vibration of the solid floor under him, and the long, heav=
ily loaded freight=20

thundered down upon the little station.  As the hideous, clanging, shriekin=
g, hissing monster=20

rushed down upon them, coming seemingly straight for the wooden crate, Blac=
k Bruin sprang=20

against the bars with such violence that he nearly tipped it over, and gave=
 his captors a great=20

scare.  In a very few minutes, however, the crate, together with the other =
freight, was hustled into=20

an empty car, and the train pulled out and went thundering away into the da=
rkness.  At first the=20

motion made Black Bruin very uneasy, and he walked to and fro continually; =
but finally this was=20

succeeded by his being car-sick, and he was soon glad to lie down and keep =
very still for the rest=20

of the journey.  This was his first night upon a freight train, but it was =
not his last, for ahead of him=20

was a strange and turbulent existence.  He was going to the great city to j=
oin the circus, to be a=20

part of that astonishing procession which annually parades the streets of o=
ur large cities, and=20

which draws crowds, such as does no other entertainment.  Toward morning, a=
fter having made=20

several stops, the car in which Black Bruin was a passenger was side-tracke=
d, and a large, gilded=20

wagon, known to the small boy as a circus-van, was backed up to it.  Then t=
he crate was placed=20

against the cage on the van, and both doors were opened.  The new prison lo=
oked much more=20

fragile than that in which Black Bruin was.  The bars were very small and m=
ight be easily broken.=20

It was lighter, too, than his present abode, so after a little poking and p=
unching, the captive went=20

into the other prison, and a moment later, when he turned about to look for=
 the doorway by which=20

he had entered, it was closed and the wooden crate was straightforward and =
so honorable, found=20

himself instinctively, almost it might be said unconsciously, defending him=
self against his invaders=20

with some of their own weapons. He still talked about building his cathedra=
l, of which, not=20

contented with more plans, he even gave orders that a model should be made,=
 and he still=20

received statements on points of faith from Father Coleman, on which he mad=
e marginal notes=20

and queries. Monsignore Catesby was not altogether satisfied. He was suspic=
ious of some=20

disturbing cause, but at present it baffled him. Their hopes, however, were=
 high; and they had=20

cause to be sanguine. In a month=E2=80=99s time or so, Lothair would be in =
the country to celebrate his=20

majority; his guardian the cardinal was to be his guest; the St. Jeromes we=
re invited, Monsignore=20

Catesby himself. Here would be opportunity and actors to avail themselves o=
f it.  It was a very few=20

days after the first evening visit of Lothair to Belmont that he found hims=
elf one morning alone with=20

Theodora. She was in her bowery boudoir, copying some music for Madame Phoe=
bus, at least in=20

the intervals of conversation. That had not been of a grave character, but =
the contrary when=20

Lothair rather abruptly said, =E2=80=9CDo you agree, Mrs. Campian, with wha=
t Mr. Phoebus said the other=20

night, that the greatest pain must be the sense of death?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CThen mankind is generally spared the=20

greatest pain,=E2=80=9D she replied, =E2=80=9Cfor I apprehend few people ar=
e sensible of death=E2=80=94unless indeed,=E2=80=9D she=20

added, =E2=80=9Cit be on the field of battle; and there, I am sure, it cann=
ot be painful.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot on the field of=20

battle?=E2=80=9D asked Lothair, inducing her to proceed.  =E2=80=9CWell, I =
should think for all, on the field of battle,=20



there must be a degree of excitement, and of sympathetic excitement, scarce=
ly compatible with=20

overwhelming suffering; but, if death were encountered there for a great ca=
use, I should rather=20

associate it with rapture than pain.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut still a good nu=
mber of persons must die in their beds and=20

be conscious,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CIt may be, though I should d=
oubt it. The witnesses of such a demise=20

are never impartial. All I have loved and lost have died upon the field of =
battle; and those who=20

have suffered pain have been those whom they have left behind; and that pai=
n,=E2=80=9D she added with=20

some emotion, =E2=80=9Cmay perhaps deserve the description of Mr. Phoebus.=
=E2=80=9D  Lothair would not pursue=20

the subject, and there was rather an=20


_
outwitted him, but the manner in which he was now confined seemed very inse=
cure to Black Bruin.=20

He would soon either find a way out, or else make one.  With this in view, =
he went about the cage=20

several times, sniffing and poking his nose between the bars.  He put his p=
owerful arms between=20

two of the bars and strained upon pause. Theodora herself broke it, and in =
a lighter vein, though=20

recurring to the same theme, she said with a slight smile: =E2=80=9CI am sc=
arcely a competent person to=20

consult upon this subject, for, to be candid with you, I do not myself beli=
eve in death. There is a=20

change, and doubtless a great one, painful it may be, certainly=20


_
strength, but they did not seem to give at all.  Then he sought to grind on=
e to splinters between his=20

teeth, but instead he broke a tooth, and the effort made him see stars.  Wh=
at new and amazing=20

substance was this, which could not be bent or broken, or even bitten into?=
  The more Black Bruin=20

pushed at the iron bars of his cage, the fainter grew that spark of hope wh=
ich is the mainspring of=20

all life, until at last he ceased to hope altogether, and bowing to the ine=
vitable, no longer sought to=20

be free.  Sullenly he glared at the gaping crowds that passed his cage dail=
y, and the only thing to=20

which he looked forward was his food.  This he received each day at about n=
oon.  What it all=20

meant, he could not imagine.  The great crowds, the blare of bands, the gal=
a dress and the babel=20

of voices all reminded him of the country fairs that he had often attended =
with Pedro, in the old=20

dancing-bear days.  The long journeys by rail he soon got used to, so that =
he was no longer sick,=20

but it was a weary existence.  The snap and rattle of car-wheels was contin=
ually in his ears, and if=20

it was not that, it was the rattle and the rumble of heavy wheels over pavi=
ng-stones, the noise of=20

the brazen-throated circus-band, or the high and insistent calliope.  Noise=
, noise, noise=20

everywhere.  When the animals were fed, there was the roaring of the lions,=
 the snapping and=20

snarling of wolves, jaguars, pumas, and the hideous laugh of the hyena; the=
 chattering of the=20

monkeys, and the piping and croaking of strange, tropical birds.  And, more=
 insistent than any of=20

these, the bellowing of the sacred cattle from India, and the belling and b=
leating of strange deer,=20

not to mention the cavernous trumpeting of but I have a profound conviction=
 of my immortality, and=20

I do not believe that I shall rest in my grave in saecula saeculorum, only =
to be convinced of it by=20

the last trump.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI hope you will not leave this world bef=
ore I do,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cbut, if that sorrow=20

be reserved for me, promise that to me, if only once, you will reappear.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI doubt whether the=20

departed have that power,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cor else I think =
my heroes would have revisited me. I=20

lost a father more magnificent than Jove, and two brothers brighter than Ap=
ollo, and all of them=20

passionately loved me=E2=80=94and yet they have not come; but I shall see t=
hem=E2=80=94and perhaps soon. So=20

you see, my dear lord,=E2=80=9D speaking more briskly, and rising rather su=
ddenly from her seat, =E2=80=9Cthat for=20

my part I think it best to arrange all that concerns one in this world whil=
e one inhabits it, and this=20

reminds me that I have a little business to fulfil in which you can help me=
,=E2=80=9D and she opened a=20

cabinet and took out a flat antique case, and then said, resuming her seat =
at her table: =E2=80=9CSome one,=20

and anonymously, has made me a magnificent present; some strings of costly =
pearls. I am greatly=20

embarrassed with them, for I never wear pearls or anything else, and I neve=
r wish to accept=20

presents. To return them to an unknown is out of my power, but it is not im=
possible that I may=20

some day become acquainted with the donor. I wish them to be kept in safety=
, and therefore not=20

by myself, for my life is subject to too great vicissitudes. I have therefo=
re placed them in this case,=20

which I shall now seal and intrust them to your care, as a friend in whom I=
 have entire confidence.=20

See,=E2=80=9D she said, lighting a match, and opening the case, =E2=80=9Che=
re are the pearls=E2=80=94are=20


_
when their keepers prodded them into obedience.  There is but one law in th=
e circus, and that is=20

the law of fear.  All the wild beasts are ruled by it alone.  The tricks th=
at the great cats do are=20

clubbed into them, and the elephants' ears are often so torn by the trainer=
's iron that they hang in=20

ribbons.  It is only with the domestic animals, like the horses and the tri=
ck-dogs, that the trainer=20

can exercise will tell you what to do with them in case of my absence, when=
 you open the case,=20

which will not be for a year from this day. There, it is locked. I have dir=
ected it to you, and I will=20

seal it with my father=E2=80=99s seal.=E2=80=9D  Lothair was about to speak=
. =E2=80=9CDo not say a word,=E2=80=9D she said =E2=80=9Cthis seal=20

is a religious ceremony with me.=E2=80=9D She was some little time fulfilli=
ng it, so that the impression might=20

be deep and clear. She=20
