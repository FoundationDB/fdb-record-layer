           "'Is not there any plan by=20

which you could raise          the wind, Jack?'" I inquired.           "'Ne=

        could find Sir=20

Godfrey's treasure.'           "'Who's he?'           "'An ancestor of mine=

From the extensive table-land of the Villa de Cura we descended towards the=
 banks of the Rio=20

inal valley running from=20

east to west, at nearly the same level as La Victoria. A transverse valley,=
 lying generally north and=20

south, led us into the Llanos, by the villages of Parapara and Ortiz. It gr=
ows very narrow in several=20

parts. Basins, the bottoms of which are perfectly horizontal, communicate t=
