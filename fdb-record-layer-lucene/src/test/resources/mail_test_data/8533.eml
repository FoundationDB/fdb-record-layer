dracaena marginata tired as he was, the master had almost directly to set t=
o work. He had not even time to snatch a hasty meal. The benches were half =
filled with their noisy young occupants before Ned Franks took his usual pl=
ace behind his high desk. He fancied that Good-bye,--good-bye." Then I mumb=
led something about hoping to see them again before they left Paris, and es=
caped, knowing that I had made a horrid mess of my excuses. Di was laughing=
 at something West said, as I turned away, and though perhaps his dracaena =
marginata tired as he was, the master had almost directly to set to work. H=
e had not even time to snatch a hasty meal. The benches were half filled wi=
th their noisy young occupants before Ned Franks took his usual place behin=
d his high desk. He fancied that Good-bye,--good-bye." Then I mumbled somet=
hing about hoping to see them again before they left Paris, and escaped, kn=
owing that I had made a horrid mess of my excuses. Di was laughing at somet=
hing West said, as I turned away, and though perhaps his _
heard her say"--He stopped short, for he could hardly have repeated the com=
pliment to the wife in=20

the presence of the husband, as it was that "Persis Meade was fifty times t=
oo good for that canting=20

fellow with the wooden arm."  "I am afraid that even my wife would be unabl=
e to do anything,"=20

replied Ned.  "Oh! don't say that, Mr. Franks," cried the clerk piteously, =
as if his last hope were=20

being cut away. "It's wonderful conventional politeness before he can disap=
pear, no matter what=20

presses.  I said "How do you do?" to everyone, adding that I was as surpris=
ed to see them as they=20

could be to see me. I even grinned civilly at Lord Robert West, though find=
ing him here with Di,=20

looking particularly pleased with himself, made me want to knock him down. =
 "Oh, it was a plan, as=20

far as Mounty and Lord Robert and I are concerned," explained Lady=20


_
a woman can do. Do we not all know that Mrs. Franks, and you helping her, w=
ere able to convert=20

even a hard-hearted, unbelieving Jew! Is not the baptism of Benjamin Isaacs=
, and of Benoni his=20

son, down in the register there, and was it not all from the speaking of yo=
u and your wife? If she=20

could do so much for a Jew, don't say she can do nothing for a Christian." =
 Franks was touched by=20

the earnest appeal, but could not help thinking in his heart that Benjamin =
Isaacs, with all his=20

Jewish prejudices, had been a more hopeful subject than Nancy Sands. He did=
 not, however,=20

speak; he only shook his head to express a have been at the Duchess's bazaa=
r this afternoon, but=20

then he won't show up at such things, even to please his sister, and Di and=
 Lisa were to have=20

represented me there. To-day and to-morrow are the only days all three of u=
s could possibly steal=20

to get away and look at a most wonderful motor car; made for a Rajah who di=
ed before it was=20

ready. Lord Robert certainly knows more about automobiles than any other hu=
man being does,=20

and he thought this was just what I would want. Di had the most horrid head=
ache this morning,=20

poor child, and wasn't fit for the fatigue of a big crush, so, as she's a s=
plendid sailor, I=20


_
"Mrs. Franks could make her way with Mrs. Sands, I feel certain of it," sai=
d the clerk, after another=20

painful silence. "Women know how to speak to women. Could she not take the =
babe with her?=20

Nancy is fond of babies." Sands's voice dropped almost to a whisper, as he =
added, "She'd have=20

gone through fire and water for our boy; there was never a better mother; i=
t was sorrow that set=20

her wrong."  Ned could hold out no longer. "I'll ask my wife to call upon M=
rs. Sands to-morrow, and=20

to take the baby, and maybe she'll get her to return the visit," said the s=
ailor, cheerily. "Keep up a=20

good heart, neighbor; there may be better days in store for you yet."  Ther=
e was a little sound in=20

the clerk's with us--and Lisa, too, of course. We caught the afternoon trai=
n to Boulogne, and had=20

such a glorious crossing that we actually all had the courage to dress and =
dine at Madrid--wasn't it=20

plucky of us? But we're collapsing now, and have come back early, as we mus=
t inspect the car the=20

first thing to-morrow morning and do a heap of shopping afterwards."  "If y=
ou're collapsing, I=20

mustn't keep you standing here a moment," I said, anxious for more than one=
 reason to get away.=20

Di wasn't looking at me. Half turned from me, purposely I didn't doubt, she=
 had begun a=20

conversation with Bob West, who beamed with joy over her kindness to him an=
d her apparent=20

indifference to me.  "'Collapsing' is an=20


_
a cough and sob, and he pulled his handkerchief hastily out of his pocket, =
for his eyes were=20

brimming over with tears. Franks, who hated to see a man cry, made his depa=
rture rather abruptly.=20

"It is getting very late," he observed; "I must wish Mr. Sands good-day."  =
"I could not help it; I could=20

not help striking my flag when he boarded me like that," muttered the sailo=
r to himself, as with long=20

strides he hurried towards his school-house. "But to think of my "But, inst=
ead of keeping us=20

standing here, come up to our sitting-room and have a little talk--and whis=
ky and soda."  "Yes, do=20

come, Dundas," her husband added.  "Thank you both," I stammered, trying no=
t to look=20

embarrassed. "But--I know you're all tired, and--."  "And perhaps you have =
some nice=20

engagement," piped Lisa.  "It's too late for respectable British young men =
to have engagements in=20

naughty Paris," said Lady Mountstuart, laughing again (she looks very=20


_
poor Persis to tackle a tigress, who's too much for the parson himself! But=
 how could I say him=20

nay? He's nigh broken-hearted, poor fellow! Certainly, if any one in the wo=
rld is likely to say a word=20

to Nancy that will help her to sheer off from the whirlpool that's drawing =
her in, that one is my=20

sweet cherub of a wife."  Franks found that he was even later than he had s=
upposed himself to be;=20

"It depends upon the engagement," I managed to reply calmly. But then, as D=
i suddenly turned=20

and looked straight at me with marked coldness, the blood sprang up to my f=
ace. I began to=20

stammer again like a young ass of a schoolboy. "I'm afraid that I--er--the =
fact is, I _am_ engaged.=20

A matter of business. I wish I could get out of it, but I can't, and--er--I=
 shall have to run off, or I will=20

be=20
