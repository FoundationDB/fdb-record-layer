riches, obtained by theft and usurpation, accompanied by such slaughter and=
 annihilation of those=20

peoples, unless she does much penance."  This last profession of the faith =
he had kept=20

unfalteringly for more than half a century, was his own supreme vindication=
 and a warning to his=20

countrymen.  A great concourse of people assembled for the obsequies of the=
 venerable Bishop,=20

which were celebrated by the Superior of the Monastery, Fray Domingo de la =
Para, and his mortal=20

remains, clothed in modest episcopal vestments, with a wooden crozier in hi=
s hand, were laid to=20

rest in the Capilla Mayor of the church of Atocha. (77)  The remains of gre=
at men are frequently=20

denied a permanent resting place anywhere, and the frequent translations of=
 their bodies not=20

uncommonly end in their final whereabouts becoming a matter of dispute.  Re=
cords are lost,=20

graves are disturbed, witnesses are untrustworthy, and it finally becomes i=
mpossible to ascertain=20

the last resting place of some great personage, whose whereabouts during al=
most every hour of=20

his life were a matter of public interest and notoriety.  Thus it has happe=
ned with the remains of=20

this illustrious Spaniard and holy Bishop.  According to a statement made b=
y Juan Antolines de=20

Burgos in his manuscript history of the city of Valladolid, on form, either=
 in carving or in elaborate=20

turning, as in the Charles II and James II period, when the so-called "barl=
ey-sugar" pattern and=20

other elaborate "corkscrew" turned legs added grace and beauty to furniture=
 beginning to take its=20

place beside the work of great European craftsmen.  In flattering imitation=
 of continental schools,=20

but more particularly the Dutch, English cabinet-makers commenced to inlay =
their furniture with=20

ivory and coloured woods, and designs embodying conventional birds and flow=
ers became of=20

frequent use. A considerable amount of skill was employed in adopting this =
new art, which=20

necessitated the careful laying of veneer. In comparison with the ordinary =
Dutch cabinet-work, this=20

derivative English furniture exhibits, in a measure, finished work of a hig=
h degree in regard to the=20

exactitude of cabinet-work which surpassed the prototypes. The English craf=
tsman was working in=20

a new medium, and he apparently was exceptionally careful in handling its t=
echnique.  In the reign=20

of William of Orange, as may be imagined, with his Dutch retinue and the Du=
tch influences at=20

Court, the style received a great impetus and the country was flooded with =
Dutch art. This impress=20

of the House of Nassau is left upon Hampton Court, with its canal, its aven=
ues, and its formal=20


_
removed from the Atocha and buried in San Gregorio.  The college buildings =
were in part=20

alienated, thus necessitating another removal of the body, which was then b=
uried in the cloister=20

where the remains of the monks commonly found sepulture.  In 1670, Fray Gab=
riel de Cepedo=20

dedicated a work entitled _Historia de la milagrosa y Venerable Virgin de A=
tocha_ to Charles II., in=20

which he contradicts the statement of Juan Antolines by affirming that Las =
Casas rested at that=20

time in the church of Atocha.  He does this as one referring to a commonly =
known and undisputed=20

fact and his published statement has never been contradicted.  The old chur=
ch of Atocha no=20

longer exists, having been demolished to make way for a new edifice, cavali=
ers brought in spirit=20

from The Hague, William brought in reality when he landed at Torbay in 1698=
.  It must be=20

remembered that in 1685 and in the immediately succeeding years, owing to t=
he revocation of the=20

Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV, fifty thousand Huguenot families fled from Fr=
ance to escape a=20

horrible fate at the hands of their Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen. In va=
in the Archbishop of=20

Canterbury directed the clergy not to dwell on the sufferings of the French=
 Protestants, and in spite=20

of James II, whose sympathies were with their persecutors, the sum of forty=
 thousand pounds was=20

collected in the English churches and handed over to the Chamber of London.=
 This was a great=20

sum in those days to be raised thus=20


_
still in process of construction.  The will of Las Casas was opened on July=
 31, 1566, at the=20

instance of Fray Juan Bautiste, Procurator of the College of San Gregorio i=
n Valladolid, he being=20

the executor.  It was found that Las Casas had left all his manuscripts to =
the college.(79) He=20

requested the to the Continent and a second Revolution ended the Stuart dyn=
asty. Thousands of=20

skilled workmen settled in London. At Spitalfields they erected silk-looms;=
 they represented the=20

best type of artist craftsmen, silversmiths, woodworkers, glass-blowers, ca=
binet-makers,=20

designers, and other artistic=20
