philodendron monstera when you commence to "throw your thought upwards and =
downwards." The Mayavi Rupa, or Manasic body, has no material connection wi=
th the physical body, no umbilical cord. It is spiritual and ethereal, and =
passes everywhere without let or hindrance. It entirely differs from the as=

 D'Artagnan, "you will get me turned off."  The gate groaned on its hinges,=
 and D'Artagnan, seeing the way clear, _
the circumference of the manifested Universe.]    Nidanas.   _Q. The root o=
f the Nidanas is Avidya.=20

How does this differ from Maya? How many Nidanas are there Esoterically?_  =
_A._ Again too=20

much is asked. The Nidanas, the concatenations of causes and effects (not i=
n the sense of the=20

Orientalists), are not caused by ignorance. They are produced by Dhyan Choh=
ans and Devas,=20

who certainly cannot be said to act in ignorance. We produce Nidanas in ign=
orance. Each cause=20

started on the Physical Plane sets up action on every plane to all eternity=
. They are eternal effects=20

reflected from plane to plane on to the "screen of eternity."    Manas.   _=
Q. What is the septenary=20

classification of Manas? There are seven degrees of the Lower Manas, and pr=
esumably there are=20

seven degrees of the Higher. Are there then fourteen degrees of Manas, or i=
s Manas, taken as a=20

whole, divided into forty-nine Manasic fires?_  _A._ Certainly there are fo=
urteen, but you want to=20

run before you can walk. First learn the three, and then go on to the forty=
-nine. There are three=20

Sons of Agni; they become seven, and then evolve to the forty-nine. But you=
 are still ignorant how=20

to produce the three. Learn first how to produce the "Sacred Fire," spoken =
of in the _Puranas_.=20

The forty-nine fires are all states of Kundalini, to be produced in ourselv=
es by the friction of the=20

Triad. First learn the septenary of the body, and then that of each Princip=
le. But first of all learn the=20

first Triad (the three vital airs).    The Spinal Cord.   _Q. What is the s=
ympathetic nerve and its=20

function in Occultism? It is found only after a certain stage of animal evo=
lution, and D'Artagnan=20

half out of his hiding place, the king raised on his elbow, ready to fall d=
own on his bed again at the=20

slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude, but instea=
d of approaching, the=20

noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away.  Th=
e queen breathed=20

more freely. D'Artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his b=
ed, saying, "Let us go."=20

At this moment Laporte reappeared.  "Well?" asked the queen  "Well, madame,=
" replied the valet,=20

"I followed them as far as the gates. They announced to all their comrades =
that they had seen the=20

king and that the queen had spoken to them; and, in fact, they went away qu=
ite proud and happy."=20

"Oh, the miserable wretches!" murmured the queen, "they shall pay dearly fo=
r their boldness, and=20

it is I who promise this."  Then turning to D'Artagnan, she said:  "Sir, yo=
u have given me this=20

evening the best advice I have ever received. Continue, and say what we mus=
t do now."=20

"Monsieur Laporte," said D'Artagnan, "finish dressing his majesty."  "We ma=
y go, then?" asked the=20

queen.  "Whenever your majesty pleases. You have only to descend by the pri=
vate stairs and you=20

will find me at the door."  "Go, sir," said the queen; "I will follow you."=
  D'Artagnan went down and=20

found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box. D'Artagnan too=
k out the parcel which=20

he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat. It may be remembered that =
it was the hat and=20

cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondy's coachman.  He placed the cloak on hi=
s shoulders and the=20

hat on his head, whilst the musketeer got off the box.  "Sir," said D'Artag=
nan, "you will=20


_
evolving in complexity towards a second spinal cord._  _A._ At the end of t=
he next Round,=20

Humanity will again become male-female, and then there will be two spinal c=
ords. In the Seventh=20

Race the two will merge into the one. The evolution corresponds to the Race=
s, and with the=20

evolution of the Races the sympathetic developes into a true spinal cord. W=
e are returning up the=20

arc only with self-consciousness added. The Sixth Race will correspond to t=
he "pudding bags," but=20

will have the perfection of form with the highest intelligence and spiritua=
lity.  Anatomists are=20

beginning to find new ramifications and new modifications in the human body=
. They are in error on=20

many points, _e.g._, as to guarding the coachman. You must mount your horse=
 and proceed to=20

the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette, whence you will take my horse an=
d that of Monsieur=20

du Vallon, which you must saddle and equip as if for war, and then you will=
 leave Paris, bringing=20

them with you to Cours la Reine. If, when you arrive at Cours la Reine, you=
 find no one, you must=20

go on to Saint Germain. On the king's service."  The musketeer touched his =
cap and went away to=20

execute the orders thus received.  D'Artagnan mounted the box, having a pai=
r of pistols in his belt,=20

a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.  The queen appeared, =
and was followed=20

by the king and the Duke d'Anjou, his brother.=20


_
spleen, which they call the manufactory of white blood corpuscles, but whic=
h is really the vehicle of=20

the Linga Sharira. Occultists know each minute portion of the heart, and ha=
ve a name for each.=20

They call them by the names of the Gods, as Brahma's Hall, Vishnu's Hall, e=
tc. They correspond=20

with parts of the brain. The very atoms of the body are the thirty-three cr=
ores of Gods.  The=20

sympathetic nerve is played on by the Tantrikas, who call it Shiva's Vina. =
   Prana.   _Q. What is=20

the relation of man to Prana--the periodical life?_  _A._ Jiva becomes Pran=
a only when the child is=20

born and begins to breathe. It is the breath of life, Nephesh. There is no =
Prana on the Astral Plane.=20

Antahkarana.   _Q. The Antahkarana is the link between the Higher and the L=
ower Egos; does it=20

correspond to the umbilical cord in projection?_  _A._ No; the umbilical co=
rd joining the astral to=20

the physical body is a real thing. Antahkarana is imaginary, a figure of sp=
eech, and is only the=20

bridging over from the Higher to the Lower Manas. Antahkarana only  "Yes, m=
adame," said=20

D'Artagnan; "but get in fearlessly, for I myself will drive you."  The quee=
n uttered a cry of surprise=20

and entered the carriage, and the king and monsieur took their places at he=
r side.  "Come,=20

Laporte," said the queen.  "How, madame!" said the valet, "in the same carr=
iage as your=20

majesties?"  "It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening, but of th=
e king's safety. Get in,=20

Laporte."  Laporte obeyed.  "Pull down the blinds," said D'Artagnan.  "But =
will that not excite=20

suspicion, sir?" asked the queen.  "Your majesty's mind may be quite at eas=
e," replied the officer;=20

"I have my answer ready."  The blinds were pulled down and they started at =
a gallop by the Rue=20

Richelieu. On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the hea=
d of a dozen men,=20

holding a lantern in his hand.  D'Artagnan signed to them to draw near.  "D=
o you recognize the=20

carriage?" he asked the sergeant.  "No," replied the latter.  "Look at the =
arms."  The sergeant put=20

the lantern near the panel.  "They are those of monsieur le=20
