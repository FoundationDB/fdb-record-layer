 Several persons wishing to ascertain its effects by individual experience,=

o the members of the school who occupied the third-floor rooms in Gannett H=
all. The newcomer found himself possessed of a small and plain, but comfort=
able room, in which a bed, a chest of drawers, a table and two chairs were =
the chief articles of furniture. It looked out on the tennis courts and com=
manded a view of Hamilton village indisposed; on the contrary, many thought=
 they experienced some good effect in regard to some infirmities under whic=
h they had long laboured.  The above are not, however, the only experiments=
 which have been made upon this beverage. Several persons wishing to ascert=
ain its effects by individual experience, have voluntarily confined themsel=
ves to _
the school will like you. We've assigned you to Gannett Hall; I'll have one=
 of the masters take you=20

over and introduce you to the boys who've already come. We don't do much to=
-day except get=20

settled. Did you bring your things?"  "My father is going to bring them up =
this noon," Findley=20

replied. "I thought I'd better come early to start in with the other fellow=
s."  Doctor Wells put him in=20

charge of Mr. Stevens, who took him over to Gannett Hall, a three-story bui=
lding with its ivy-

covered front to the campus and its back to the tennis courts. A dozen boys=
 were standing on the=20

steps; they had been talking and laughing, but as the newcomer approached t=
hem with the=20

master, their voices died away and they paused in their conversations. A bl=
ack-haired boy, tall and=20

heavily built, immediately called out:  "Hello, Teeny-bits!"  The new boy r=
ecognized the one who=20

had hailed him as Tracey Campbell, who had been in the class above him in t=
he public school at=20

Greensboro. "Teeny-bits" was the name by which Findley Holbrook had been kn=
own ever since he=20

could remember and to hear himself thus addressed brought to him a momentar=
ily pleasant=20

feeling, even though Tracey Campbell had never been a special friend of his=
. When Findley was=20

younger he had been so small that some one had called him "Teeny-bits" and =
the name had=20

stuck. At the public school in Greensboro, in the village of Hamilton, in h=
is home, every one called=20

him Teeny-bits, and though the name did not apply to him now as appropriate=
ly as it had applied=20

when he was four or five years younger, it still fitted him so well Neither=
 of these liquids=20

immediately loses this by being filtered through charcoal; but by being exp=
osed for some time to=20

the air, the distilled seawater loses this unpleasant quality, and then it =
does not differ from fresh=20

water derived from the purest source; and both have equally stood every che=
mical test to which=20

they have been exposed. The chemical properties of this water having thus b=
een determined, it=20

remains to give an account of the effects upon the individuals who underwen=
t the experiment.=20

These are the principal results:  _Brest._ During the first days, those who=
 drank the water=20

complained of a weight upon the stomach. This indisposition, which was the =
only one they=20

experienced, soon decreased upon taking exercise, and totally went off by a=
n additional ounce of=20

biscuit added to their common ration. One of them, on the 29th day, had a f=
ew symptoms, but=20

which he himself attributed to an indigestion, from some bacon he had eaten=
. Eight individuals=20

drank twenty-five pints a day, rather more than three pints each,--(N. B. T=
he French pint contains=20

very near fifty-seven cubic inches of English measure, and is the regulatio=
n size for the claret or=20

Bordeaux bottle; but in general the bottles are rather smaller. The French =
pint is therefore equal to=20

rather more than nineteen-twentieths of an English quart, wine measure.)  _=
Toulon._ The results=20

obtained at the arsenal of this town, were not less decisive or satisfactor=
y. The six persons who=20

made the experiment acquired a greater degree of freshness in their appeara=
nce, and were much=20

fatter. Their daily=20


_
questioned it.  Mr. Stevens smiled as he heard it from Tracey Campbell's li=
ps and glanced at his=20

young companion. A compact, slim body somewhat under the average height for=
 seventeen,=20

square shoulders, a very youthful mouth, eyes that seemed older than the re=
st of him and light=20

brown, almost tow-colored hair, were the characteristics of Teeny-bits Holb=
rook that Mr. Stevens,=20

the English master, saw. He said to himself that Teeny-bits was an apt nick=
name.  There were=20

other characteristics that Mr. Stevens did not see; one of them distilled w=
ater was nine pounds=20

(_poids de marc_) for drink, and eleven pounds for cooking. This is nearly =
the same relative=20

quantity as those at Brest.  _Rochefort._ The experiments here have not bee=
n made with the=20

same regularity; because the fifteen persons fixed upon had all agreed to s=
ay that they were very=20

ill. The two principal ones complained of violent cholics and diarrh=C5=93a=
s: but the plot was=20

discovered, and upon being put upon the sick-list, (_=C3=A0 la di=C3=A8te_,=
) they were laughed at by their=20

companions. No one of them was=20
