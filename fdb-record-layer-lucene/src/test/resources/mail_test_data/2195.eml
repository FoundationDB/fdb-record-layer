 dime.  "I was desperate. I=20

tried to get help from charity, but was told they couldn't help me because =
I was a non-county=20

resident."  "Never mind all these details," State Trooper Peterson cut in i=
mpatiently. "You robbed=20

the Merrimac home?"  "Yes, I heard talk in a pool room that the old man had=
 a strongbox. I noticed=20

by watching the house that he was careless about locking his doors. So I wa=
tched my chance and=20

slipped in. I found the box without any trouble. But as I was leaving, I sa=
w a photograph that gave=20

me a terrific shock."  "Mr. Merrimac's picture?" questioned the trooper.  "=
No, it was a picture of my=20

mother. In a flash, I knew that I was robbing my own uncle, because he was =
the only person in=20

Webster City who would have such a photograph."  "But you went through with=
 the deed all the=20

same?" Officer Peterson reminded him.  "I didn't have time to think things =
to a conclusion," the=20

tramp said lamely. "As I was looking at the photograph, a woman came into t=
he house to do some=20

work. Seeing her, I got panicky and fled."  "With the money."  "Yes, I kept=
 it. But right away, my=20

conscience began to bother me. I'd never stolen anything before. The last t=
hing I wanted to do=20

was take money from my own relative.  "I made up my mind I'd return it and =
then try to get=20

Merrimac to help me."  "What changed your mind?"  "Everything worked agains=
t me. First I made=20

the mistake of hiding the money box in the empty church. It was my bad luck=
 that the Cub Scouts=20

had a meeting there before I had a chance to get it back again."  "You were=
 the man we met on=20

 be put underground so=20

soon. The lumber was hard to work because it was full of frost, and the boa=
rds gave off a sweet=20

smell of pine woods, as the heap of yellow shavings grew higher and higher.=
 I wondered why=20

Fuchs had not stuck to cabinet-work, he settled down to it with such ease a=
nd content. He handled=20

the tools as if he liked the feel of them; and when he planed, his hands we=
nt back and forth over=20

the boards in an eager, beneficent way as if he were blessing them. He brok=
e out now and then=20

into German hymns, as if this occupation brought back old times to him.  At=
 four o'clock Mr. Bushy,=20

the postmaster, with another neighbor who lived east of us, stopped in to g=
et warm. They were on=20

their way to the Shimerdas'. The news of what had happened over there had s=
omehow got abroad=20

through the snow-blocked country. Grandmother gave the visitors sugar-cakes=
 and hot coffee.=20

Before these callers were gone, the brother of the Widow Steavens, who live=
d on the Black Hawk=20

road, drew up at our door, and after him came the father of the German fami=
ly, our nearest=20

neighbors on the south. They dismounted and joined us in the dining-room. T=
hey were all eager=20

for any details about the suicide, and they were greatly concerned as to wh=
ere Mr. Shimerda=20

would be buried. The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it mi=
ght be weeks before=20

a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that=
 a man who had=20

killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a bur=
ying-ground over by the=20

Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr=

_
identified him.  "Sure, I asked you what was going on. That was the first I=
 knew the church had=20

been reopened."  "Then later you peeked through the church window!"  "I saw=
 a light in the=20

basement first," the tramp explained. "That gave me a real scare. But I had=
 a worse jolt when I=20

saw you kids had found the money and were counting it."  "You followed us i=
n a car after we left=20

the church?" Mr. Hatfield inquired.  "Where would I get a car?"  "Then how =
did you learn where the=20

money box was taken?"  "I knew you'd either  After our visitors rode away i=
n single file over the=20

hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a=
 chocolate cake, and=20

Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane.=
 One pleasant thing about=20

this time was that everybody talked more than usual. I had never heard the =
postmaster say=20

anything but "Only papers, to-day," or, "I've got a sackful of mail for ye,=
