Gay "father", and becomes very vague when asked if this title is a blood tie or a name of which he 

is generally known.  According to Kemp--Gay was one of the meanest plantation owners in the 

entire section, and frequently voiced his pride in being able to employ the cruelest overseers that 

could be found in all Mississippi. Among these were such men as G.T. Turner, Nels T. Thompson, 

Billy Hole, Andrew Winston and other men with statewide reputations for brutality. When all of the 

cruelties of one overseer had been felt by the slaves on the Gay plantation and another meaner 

man's reputation was heard of on the Gay plantation, the master would delight in telling his slaves 

that if they did not behave, he would send for this man. "Behaving"--the "Prophet" says, meant 

living on less food than one should have; mating only at his command and for purposes purely of 

breeding more and stronger slaves on his plantation for sale. In some cases with women--

subjecting to his every demand if they would escape hanging by the wrists for half a day or being 

beaten with a cowhide whip.  About these whippings, the "Prophet" tells many a blood-curdling 

tale.  "One day when an old woman was plowing in the field, an overseer came by and 

reprimanded her for being so slow--she gave him some back talk, he took out a long closely 

woven whip and lashed her severely. The woman became sore and took her hoe and chopped 

him right across his head, and child you should have seen how she chopped this man to a bloody 

death."  "Prophet" Kemp will tell you that he hates to tell these things to any investigator, because 

he hates for people to know just how mean his "fahter" really was.  So great was the fear in which 

Gay was held that when Kemp's mother, Arnette Young, complained to Mrs. Gay, that her 

husband was constantly seeking her for a mistress and threatening her with death if she did not 

submit, even Mrs. Gay had to advise the slaves to do as Gay demanded, saying--"My husband is 

a dirty man and will find some reason to kill you if you don't." "I can't do a thing with him." Since 

Arnette worked at the "big house" there was no alternative, and it was believed that out of the 

union with her master, Henry was born. A young slave by the name of Broxton Kemp was given to 

the woman as husband at the time John Kemp was born, it is from this man that "Prophet" took his 

name.  Life on the plantation held nothing but misery for the slaves of John Gay. A week's 

allowance of groceries for the average small family consisted of a package of about ten pounds 

containing crudely ground meal, a slab of bacon--called side-meat and from a pint to a quart of 

syrup made from sorghum, depending upon the season.  All slaves reported for work a 5 o'clock in 

the morning, except those who cared for the overseer, who began their work an hour earlier to 

enable the overseer to be present at the morning England good store of coal and iron. Not so 

stable, however, is the advantage given to England by the effects of the Napoleonic war, which for 

the time crushed all manufactures and mercantile marines but hers. Now, the continental nations 

are developing manufactures and mercantile marines of their own. You go round asking them to 

alter their tariffs, so as to enable you to recover their markets, and almost all of them refuse; about 

the only door you have really succeeded in getting opened to you is that of France, and this was 

opened, not by the nation, but by an autocrat, who had diplomatic purposes of his own. The 

_Times_, indeed, in a noteworthy article the other day, undertook to prove that a great 

manufacturing and trading nation might lose its customers without being much the worse for it, but 

this seems too good to be true; I fancy Yorkshire and Lancashire would say so. Is it not that very 

margin of profit of which _The Times_ speaks so lightly, which, being accumulated, has created 

the wealth of England? Your manufacturers are certainly under the impression that they want 



markets, and the loss of the great American market seems to them a special matter of concern. It 

is doubtful whether that market would be restored to them even by an alteration of the tariff. The 

coal in the great American coal fields is much nearer the surface, and consequently more cheaply 

worked, than the coal in England; iron is as plentiful, and it is near the coal; labour, which has 

been much dearer there, is now falling to the English level. Tariff or no tariff, America will probably 

keep her own market for the heavier and coarser goods. But there is still a kind of goods, in the 

production of which the old country will long have a great advantage. I mean the lighter, finer, and 

more elegant goods, the products of cultivated taste and of trained skill in design--that very kind of 

goods, in short, the character of which these Schools of Art are specially intended to improve. 

Industry and invention the new world has in as ample a measure as the old; invention in still 

ampler measure, for the Americans are a nation of inventors; but cultivated taste and its special 

products will long be the appanage of old countries. It will be long before anything of that kind will 

pass current in the new world without the old world stamp. Adapt your industry in some degree to 

changed requirements; acquire those finer faculties which the Schools of Design aim at cultivating, 

but which, in the lucrative production of the coarser goods, have hitherto been comparatively 

neglected, and you may recover a great American market; it is doubtful whether you will in any 

other way. Therefore, I repeat, to stint the Art and Science Schools would seem bad policy. I may 

add that it would be specially bad policy here in Oxford, where, under the auspices of a University 

which is now extending

determined which slaves were late or who had committed some offense late on the day before or 

during the night. These were singled out and before the rest of the slaves began their work they 

were treated to the sight of these delinquents being stripped and beaten until blood flowed; women 

were no exception to the rule.  The possible loss of his slaves upon the declaration of freedom on 

January 1, 1866 caused Gay considerable concern. His liquor-ridden mind was not long in finding 

a solution, however, he barred all visitors from his plantation and insisted that his overseers see to 

the carrying out of this detail. They did, with such efficiency that it was not until May 8, when the 

government finally learned of the condition and sent a marshall to the plantation, that freedom 

came to Gay's slaves. May 8, is still celebrated in this section of Mississippi, as the official 

emancipation day.  Relief for the hundreds of slaves of Gay came at last with the declaration of 

freedom for them. The government officials finer industries, such as design applied to furniture, 

decoration of all kinds, carving, painted glass, bookbinding, ought in time to do particularly well. If 

you wish to prosper, cultivate your speciality; the rule holds good for cities as well as for men. 

There are some, perhaps, who dislike to think of Art in connection with anything like manufacture. 

Let us, then, call it design, and keep the name of art for the higher pursuit. Your Instructor 

presides, I believe, with success, and without finding his duties clash, over a school, the main 

object of which is the improvement of manufactures, and another school dedicated to the higher 

objects of aesthetic cultivation. The name manufacture reminds you of machines, and you may 

dislike machines and think there is something offensive to artists in their products. Well, a machine 

does not produce, or pretend to produce, poetry or sculpture; it pretends to clothe thousands of 

people who would otherwise go naked. It is itself often a miracle of human intellect. It

grown and growing crops; and some land was parcelled out to the former slaves.  Kemp may have 

gained the name "Prophet" from his constant reference to the future and to his religion. He says 

he believes on one faith, one Lord and one religion, and preaches this belief constantly. He claims 

to have turned his back on all religions that "do not do as the Lord says."  In keeping this belief he 

says he represents the "True Primitive Baptist Church", but does not have any connection with 

that church, because he believes it has not lived exactly up to what the Lord expects of him. 

Kemp claims the ability to read the future with ease; even to help determine what it humanity may 

have a chance to rest. If it sometimes supersedes higher work, it far more often, by relieving man 

of the lowest work, sets him free for the higher. Those heaps of stones broken by the hammer of a 

poor wretch who bends over his dull task through the weary day by the roadside, scantily clad, in 

sharp frost perhaps or chilling showers, are they more lovely to a painter's eye than if they had 

been broken, without so much human labour and suffering, by a steam stone-crusher? No one 

doubts the superior interest belonging to any work however imperfect, of individual mind; but if we 

were not to use a pair of tongs that did not bear the impress of
