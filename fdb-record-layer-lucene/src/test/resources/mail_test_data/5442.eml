Henry IV. of   England.  Footnote 27:    After the death of Wenceslaus duke=
 of Brabant and=20

Luxembourg (the   great friend and patron of Froissart), the latter duchy r=
everted, of   right, to the=20

crown of Bohemia. But during the inactive and dissolute   reign of the empe=
ror Wenceslaus, it=20

seems to have been alternately   possessed by himself, by governors under h=
im nominally, but in=20

fact   supreme, or by Jodocus M. of Brandenburg and Moravia, his cousin. In=
   the history of=20

Luxembourg by Bertelius, several deeds and instruments   are cited, which t=
end rather to perplex=20

than elucidate. But he gives   the following account of the transaction wit=
h Louis duke of Orleans:=20

=E2=80=98Wenceslaus being seldom in those parts, and greatly preferring   B=
ohemia, his native country,=20

granted the government of Luxembourg to   his cousin the duke of Orleans; a=
nd moreover, for the=20

sum of 56,337   golden crowns lent him by Louis, mortgaged to him the towns=
 of Ivoy,   Montmedy,=20

Damvilliers and Orchiemont, with their appurtenances.=E2=80=99 In a   deed =
of the year 1412, the duke of=20

Orleans expresses himself as still   retaining the government at the reques=
t of his dear nephew=20

Jodocus;   but this appears to be a mistake, since Jodocus was elected empe=
ror in   1410, and=20

died six months after, before his election could be   confirmed. He was suc=
ceeded by his brother=20

Procopius.  Footnote 28:    Rupert, or Robert, elector palatine (see the ge=
nealogy, p. 12.) was=20

elected emperor upon the deposition of Wenceslaus king of Bohemia.  Footnot=
e 29:    John=20

Galeas Visconti, first duke of Milan, father of Valentina duchess   of Orle=
ans. During the reign of=20



Wenceslaus, he had made the most   violent aggressions on the free and impe=
rial states of=20

Lombardy, which   it was the first object of the new emperor to chastise. T=
he battle or   skirmish=20

here alluded to was fought near the walls of Brescia.  Footnote 30:    This=
 chapter presents a most=20

extraordinary confusion of dates and   events. The conclusion can refer onl=
y to the battle of=20

Shrewsbury,   which took place more than two years brain after death to dis=
tinguish between=20

concussion and alcoholism. A bruise on the head only indicates a probabilit=
y of concussion, for the=20

bruise and alcoholism may both be present, the former perhaps due to the la=
tter. The presence of=20

alcohol in the stomach would indicate the existence of alcoholism.  Another=
 effect of an injury=20

which has caused concussion of the brain is an _extravasation_ or _effusion=
 of blood_.=20

Extravasation of blood in or on the brain is one of the commonest causes of=
 death from injury to=20

the head. It may occur with or without marks of external injury. A person s=
uffering from such an=20

extravasation of blood may recover from the first effects of the injury, an=
d at a varying time=20

afterward the symptoms may return and increase so as to result fatally. In =
such a case the=20

opening of the bleeding vessel may have become plugged until some exertion,=
 emotion, or=20

excitement on the part of the injured person has loosened the plug. A hemor=
rhage may have=20

ceased from partial syncope and return with a stronger heart action due per=
haps to the=20

administration of alcohol. This effusion may occur on the surface of the br=
ain in connection with a=20

superficial laceration of the brain or just beneath or outside the dura mat=
er and not involving the=20

brain directly. The latter cases are almost always due to the effects of vi=
olence, though there is at=20

least one case of apparently spontaneous rupture of the middle meningeal ar=
tery. The violence=20

which causes a rupture of the branches of this artery may be so slight as t=
o leave no bruise or so=20

severe as to cause fracture of the skull. The most important symptom of suc=
h extradural=20

hemorrhage is a period of consciousness after recovery from the first effec=
ts of the injury, then=20

stupor may appear and deepen into coma. A subdural hemorrhage may cause alm=
ost the same=20

symptoms, though the injury is usually such as has produced a depressed fra=
cture. This=20

hemorrhage is most often due to the rupture of a number of small vessels un=
der the fracture,=20

though if one larger vessel is ruptured it is most often the middle cerebra=
l. A thin layer of=20

hemorrhage in connection with a superficial laceration of the brain is of f=
requent occurrence with=20

or without the other two forms of intracranial hemorrhage. If the brain is =
lacerated we may have=20

convulsions in addition to other symptoms. Death occurring during or soon a=
fter a prize-fight may=20

occur from some of the above classes of intracranial extravasations. It may=
 be questioned whether=20

the blows or a fall caused the hemorrhage. It is generally due to a fall in=
 such cases, but may be=20

due to blows, but the guilt is the same unless the fall was accidental. As =
the result of severe=20

traumatism the vessels of the interior of the cerebrum may be ruptured or h=
emorrhage may occur=20

into the ventricles of the brain. In such cases the symptoms will resemble =
those of ordinary=20

apoplexy, only the cause is different from the latter and the injury is usu=
ally so severe as to leave=20

no doubt as to the existence of a traumatism. The following question may ar=
ise in cases of=20

intracranial hemorrhage and especially in the latter class of such cases, _=
i.e._, in cerebral=20

hemorrhage:  WAS THE EXTRAVASATION OF BLOOD DUE TO DISEASE OR VIOLENCE?=E2=
=80=94It=20

may be alleged in defence that the hemorrhage was the natural result of dis=
ease. Where the=20

hemorrhage is extradural or subdural or in connection with a superficial la=
ceration of the brain, the=20

cause is almost always traumatic. We have referred to one case of extradura=
l hemorrhage from=20



spontaneous rupture of the middle meningeal artery.[662] Subdural hemorrhag=
e may occur from=20

_Pachymeningitis h=C3=A6morrhagica interna_, but this condition is readily =
diagnosed on post-mortem=20

examination and often with considerable certainty during life. A history of=
 alcoholism, headache,=20

impaired intellect, unsteady gait, occasional losses of consciousness, stup=
or increasing to coma,=20

etc., indicates such a condition.  It is in cases of cerebral hemorrhage th=
at there is the most=20

difficulty in discriminating between that due to disease and that due to in=
jury. It may be alleged that=20

the hemorrhage was from diseased vessels, or that the effects of a blow, wh=
ich cannot be denied,=20

were aggravated by disease of the cerebral vessels or by excitement due to =
intoxication or=20

passion. Cerebral hemorrhage from disease is rare before 40 years of age, e=
xcept in alcoholics.=20

When the hemorrhage is due to disease the blood-vessels are diseased. The m=
ost frequent site of=20

such hemorrhages is the course of the lenticulo-striate artery in the gangl=
ia of the base or the=20

inst, the king. The=20

Percies did not rebel till   the year 1403.  Footnote 31:    This John de W=

cause of the hemorrhage it is usually found beneath the point injured or di=
rectly opposite to this.=20

External signs of the blow are generally visible if it be severe enough to =
cause a cerebral=20

hemorrhage. The vessels may be perfectly healthy and the victim quite young=
 if the hemorrhage is=20

due to an injury, also the ruptured vessels may be plainly torn. The most d=
ifficult cases are those=20

where there is the history of an injury and at the same time such a conditi=
on of disease of the=20

cerebral vessels, etc., as would account for spontaneous hemorrhage. Where =
the injury was slight=20

in the case of alcoholics or aged people the medical witness should be espe=
cially careful in stating=20

that a cerebral hemorrhage was due to the injury. Then, too, in the act of =
