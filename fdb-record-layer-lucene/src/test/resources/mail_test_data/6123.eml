might, when we find it at one time, covering or sustaining anthracite, with impressions of ferns, and 

at another with impressions of fish and vegetables, and in contact with bituminous coal; still those 

who, with Mr. Eaton, throw argillaceous slate into the transition class, and omit it in the primitive 

and secondary, embarrass us with an equal difficulty; for we find argillaceous slate in contact, and 

alternating with, mica slate, and without any impressions of organized bodies, when we must, 

without a doubt, call it primitive.  This is the fact with the clay slate of the Woodbridge hills, near 

New-Haven, which is primitive; that of Rhode-Island, with anthracite, is transition; and that at 

Middlefields, west of Middletown, with impressions of fish, is secondary. Slate then appears to 

belong to all these three great classes of rocks.  As to the _metalliferous_ limestone, we do not so 

much object to the introduction of this term by Bakewell, although it appears to us quite as well to 

say that certain limestones, those of the transition class for example, are metalliferous. But is 

Eaton correct in referring such limestone as that of which the New-York City-Hall is built, to a 

metalliferous class? Is not that limestone decidedly primitive? The fact mentioned of its containing 

pyrites, hardly proves it to be metalliferous; since most rocks contain more or less of pyrites. Some 

other remarks of less importance we might add, but we prefer concluding by recommending this 

tract to the perusal of those who wish for information respecting the geological structure of New-

England; and we think that Mr. Eaton is seriously aiding the progress of geology in the interior of 

New-England.     ART. XIII. _Notice of M. Brongniart on Organized Remains._   This
