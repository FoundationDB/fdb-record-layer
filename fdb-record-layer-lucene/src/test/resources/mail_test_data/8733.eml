"I think you're horrid to stop me," Honey pouted reproachfully.  "If I tell=
 you what I 've got, you'll=20

enjoy it twice as much--once in anticipation, once in realization."  "But w=
hat does this wonderful=20

layout portend or promise?"  "To do good is a privilege, is n't it?"  "Gran=
ted."  "Then it's a promise,"=20

was Honey's cryptic answer.  Honey had certain little obstinacies, one of w=
hich was a way of=20

teasing Dearie by making him wait when he wanted to know a thing.  It was n=
o use--Skinner could=20

n't budge her.  "I'll wait," said he.  But all the circumstances pointed to=
 the probability of a new=20

"touch," which did not add greatly to his appetite.  After his demi-tasse, =
Skinner said to Honey,=20

"Come, Honey, spring it."  "Not till you 've got your cigar.  I want you to=
 be perfectly comfortable."=20

Skinner lighted up, leaned back in his chair, and affected--so far as he wa=
s able--the appearance=20

of indulgent nonchalance.  "Shoot."  Honey leaned her elbows on the table, =
rested her chin in the=20

little basket formed by her interlacing fingers, and looked at Dearie in a =
way that she knew to be=20

particularly engaging and effective.  "I 've always wanted to do a certain =
thing," she began.=20

"_You_ have always been my first concern, but now--I want to do something v=
ery personal--very=20

much for my own pleasure.  Will you promise to let me do it?"  "You bet I w=
ill," said Skinner;=20

"nothing's too good for you!"  Skinner was genuinely and enthusiastically g=
enerous.  Also, it would=20

be a good scheme to indulge Honey, since he might have to ask her indulgenc=
e later on.  "I had a=20

letter from mother this morning."  "Indeed?"  There was little warmth in Sk=
inner's tone.  "I suppose=20

she spoke pleasantly, not to say flatteringly, of me."  "Now, Dearie, don't=
 talk that way.  I know=20

mother is perfectly unreasonable about you."  "She came darned near making =
me lose you.=20

That's the only thing I've got against her."  "She has n't really anything =
against you--she only thinks=20

she has," observed Honey.  "The only thing she's got against me is that she=
 acted contrary to my=20

advice and lost her money.  She's hated me ever since!"  "It _is_ wrong of =
her, but we 're not any=20

of us infallible.  Besides, she's my mother--and I can't help worrying abou=
t her."  "Why worry?"=20

"The interest on her mortgage comes due and she can't pay it."  "If she'd o=
nly listened to me and=20

not taken the advice of that scalawag brother-in-law of yours, she would n'=
t have any mortgage to=20

pay interest on."  "She only got a thousand dollars.  At five per cent, tha=
t's fifty dollars a year."=20

Skinner swallowed hard to keep down the savage impulse that threatened to m=
anifest itself in=20

profanity whenever he thought of Honey's mother and his weakling brother-in=
-law.  "Honey," he=20

said grimly, "does your mother in that letter ask you to help her out with =
that interest?"  Honey=20

lifted her head proudly.  "She does n't ask me anything.  She does n't have=
 to.  She only tells me=20

about it."  "Yes, she does n't have to."  "You know I 've always wanted to =
do something for her,=20

and I've never been able to.  I'm ashamed to neglect her now, when we're li=
ving so well and=20

dressing so well--and you have your raise.  It's only a dollar a week."  "H=
ave you any more=20

relatives who have a speculative tendency?" Skinner began with chill dignit=
y.  "Now, Dearie!"=20

Honey began to cry and Skinner got up from the table and went over and kiss=
ed her.  She had=20

married him against mother's advice and had stood by him like a brick, and =
he'd do anything for=20

her.  He stroked her glossy hair.  "You _have_ always wanted to do somethin=
g for her, have n't=20

you?  You're a good girl!  Do it!  Send her a dollar a week!"  Skinner resu=
med his place at the=20

table.  This was the climax, he thought, the _ne plus ultra_ of it all!  He=
 was to contribute a dollar a=20

week to his mother-in-law to make up a loss caused by the advice of a detes=
ted, silly-ass brother-

in-law, who had always hated him, Skinner.  Surely, the dress-suit account =
had reached the debt=20

limit!  He took out his little book and jotted down:--                     =
_Dress-Suit Account_=20



_Debit_                         _Credit_    One important lesson!   Never t=
ake the first false step!   It's apt=20

to lead, one knows not   whither!   "You don't know how happy you've made m=
e," said Honey, "and=20

I 'm so proud of you--such strength of character--just like old Solon Wrigh=
t, you're doing this for=20

one you positively dislike, Dearie!--moral discipline!"  "Moral discipline,=
 your grandmother!"=20

snapped Skinner; then softly, "I'm doing it for one I love."  "I would n't =
have mentioned it if you=20

hadn't got your raise.  You know that!"  His raise!  Skinner thought much a=
bout "his" raise as he=20

lay in bed that night.  Had he gone too far to back out, he wondered?  By J=
ove, if he did n't back=20

out, his fast-diminishing bank account would _back_ him out! The thing woul=
d work automatically.=20

Probably in his whole life Skinner had never suffered so much disgust.  Thi=
nk of it!  He must go on=20

paying mother-in-law a dollar a week forever and ever, amen!  No, he'd be h=
anged if he'd do it!=20

He'd tell Honey the whole thing in the morning and throw himself on her mer=
cy.  The resolution=20

gave him relief and he went to asleep.  But he did n't tell Honey in the mo=
rning.  He was afraid to=20

hurt her.  He thought of his resolution of the night.  It's so easy to make=
 conscience-mollifying=20

resolves in the night when darkness and silence make cowards of us.  No, he=
 could n't tell her=20

now.  He'd tell her when he got home to dinner.  Meantime, things were doin=
g in the private office=20

of McLaughlin & Perkins, Inc.  "I've thought it over this far, Perk," said =
McLaughlin.  "Well?"=20

"Understand, I believe in Skinner absolutely--but--"  "Even _your_ judgment=
 is not infallible, you=20

mean?"  "Exactly."  "So do I believe in him," Perkins said.  "I couldn't of=
fend him for the world,"=20

McLaughlin went on.  "He's as sensitive as a cat's tail.  I would n't even =
dare to go into that cage of=20

his."  McLaughlin paused, "Yet we've got to do _something_.  We can't wait =
till summer when he=20

goes on his vacation.  All kinds of things might happen before then.  Time =
and Wall Street don't=20

wait for anybody--except magnates!"  "You mean, have an expert accountant g=
o over his books?"=20

said Perkins.  "Certainly, that's what I mean--that's what you mean--that's=
 what's been in both our=20

minds from the time he began to travel with that Pullman crowd."  "It ought=
 to be done at once,"=20

said Perkins.  "If things are not regular--well, we must protect ourselves.=
  I'm puzzled how to get=20

rid of him while we're doing it.  It's a delicate business," Perkins urged.=
  "I've got that all figured=20

out, Perk." McLaughlin paused to register the comedy line that was to follo=
w.  "I'm going to send=20

Skinner to St. Paul--after Willard Jackson!"  The partners were silent for =
a few moments; then=20

Perkins said, "You can't, Mac."  "Why not?"  "It's a joke!"  "Of course it'=
s a joke!  But it's a harmless=20

joke.  You and I are the only ones that are 'on.'  Skinner won't suspect.  =
We'll put it up to him in=20

dead earnest."  "The worst Jackson can do is to insult him the way he did y=
ou," said Perkins.  "The=20

old dog!" said McLaughlin.  He paused.  "We'll get Skinner out of his cage =
for a while.  It'll cost us=20

so much money--we'll add that on to the expert accountant's bill.  Can you =
think of a better way,=20

Perk?"  "Mac, you're a genius!"  McLaughlin pressed the button marked "cash=
ier."  Perkins put out=20

his hand.  "Don't call him yet, Mac.  Wait till I get through laughing."  M=
cLaughlin turned as the=20

"cage man" entered.  "Hello, Skinner.  Sit down."  He paused a moment to re=
gister his next words.=20

"Skinner, Mr. Perkins and I want you to do something for us."  Skinner look=
ed from one partner to=20

the other.  "Yes," he said quietly.  "Two years ago we lost the biggest cus=
tomer we ever had,"=20

McLaughlin proceeded.  "I know.  Willard Jackson--St. Paul."  "Lost him thr=
ough the stupidity of=20

Briggs," snapped McLaughlin.  Skinner nodded.  "We've been trying to get hi=
m back ever since, as=20

you know.  We sent our silver-tongued Browning out there.  No good!  Then M=
r. Perkins went out.=20

Then I went out.  All this you know."  The "cage man" nodded.  McLaughlin p=
aused.  "Skinner, we=20



want _you_ to go out to St. Paul and get him back."  Skinner looked curious=

to be dead serious.  "But--I'm--I'm not a salesman," the "cage man" stammer=
ed.  "That's just it,"=20

said McLaughlin earnestly.  "There must be something wrong with the policy =
or the method or the=20

manners of our salesmen, and Mr. Perkins and I have thought about it till w=
e're stale.  We want to=20

put a fresh mind on the job."  "Jackson's gone over to the Starr-Bacon folk=

How am I going to pry him loose?" said Skinner.  "We'll do even better by h=
im," said McLaughlin.=20

confidence.  I 'll do my best, sir."  "It'll take rare diplomacy, rare dipl=

warned.  "What kind of a man is Mr. Jackson?" Skinner asked presently.  "I =
know him by his=20

letters, but what kind of man is he to meet?"  "The worst curmudgeon west o=
f Pittsburg," said=20

McLaughlin.  "He'll insult you, he'll abuse you, he might even threaten to =

me.  But he's got a bank roll as big as Vesuvius--and you know what his bus=

"Fine!" said McLaughlin, rising and shaking hands with his cashier.  Skinne=
r walked to the door,=20

paused, then came halfway back.  "What kind of a woman is Mrs. Jackson, Mr.=
 McLaughlin?"=20

"Well," said McLaughlin, staggered by the question, "she don't handsome muc=
h and she ain't very=20

young, if that's what you mean."  Skinner blushed.  "I didn't mean it that =
way."  "The only thing I've=20

got against Mrs. Jackson is she's a social climber," Perkins broke in.  "Th=
e only thing I 've got=20

against her," said McLaughlin, "is--she don't climb.  She wants to, but she=
 don't."  "Is there any=20

particular reason why she does n't climb?" said Skinner.  "Vulgar--ostentat=
iously vulgar," said=20

McLaughlin.  Skinner smiled.  He pondered a moment, then ventured, "Say, Mr=
. McLaughlin, it'd=20

be a big feather in my cap if I landed Jackson, wouldn't it?"  "One of the =
ostrich variety, my son,--

seeing that the great auk is dead," said McLaughlin solemnly.  Skinner's vo=
ice faltered a bit.  "You=20

don't know, Mr. McLaughlin, and you, Mr. Perkins, how grateful I am for thi=
s opportunity.  I--I--"  He=20

turned and left the room.  "It's pathetic, ain't it?  I feel like a sneak, =
Perk," said McLaughlin.=20

"Pathetic, yes," said Perkins.  "But it's for his good.  If he's all right,=
 we're vindicating him--if he is=20

n't all right, we want to know it."  The "cage man" whistled softly to hims=
elf as he reflected that the=20

awful day of confessing to Honey was deferred for an indefinite period.  It=
 was a respite.  But what=20

gave him profound satisfaction was the fact that McLaughlin and Perkins wer=
e beginning to realize=20

that he could do something besides stand in a cage and count money.  They h=
ad made him their=20

plenipotentiary, McLaughlin said.  Gad!  That meant full power!  By jingo! =
 He kept on whistling,=20

which was significant, for Skinner rarely whistled.  And for the first time=
 in his career, when he=20

smelt burning wood pulp and looked down at the line of messenger boys with =
a ready-made frown=20

and caught the eyes of Mickey, the "littlest," smiling impudently at him, S=
kinner smiled back.  For=20

the rest of the day, as Skinner sat in his cage, three things kept running =
through his head: he's a=20

curmudgeon; she's a climber; and she _doesn't_ climb.  From these three thi=
ngs the "cage man"=20

subconsciously evolved a proposition:--  Three persons would go to St. Paul=
, named in order of=20

their importance: First, Skinner's dress suit; second, Honey; and third, Sk=
inner.     CHAPTER IX=20

SKINNER FISHES WITH A DIPLOMATIC HOOK  The first step in the scheme which S=
kinner had=20

evolved for the reclamation of Willard Jackson, of St. Paul, Minnesota, was=
 to be taken Sunday=20

morning, after services, at the First Presbyterian Church of Meadeville, Ne=
w Jersey.  Skinner had=20

not told Honey he was going to take her on his trip West. He would do that =
after church, if a certain=20

important detail of his plan did not miscarry.  Although he paid respectful=
 attention to the sermon,=20

Skinner's thoughts were at work on something not religious, and he was reli=
eved when the=20

doxology was finished and the blessing asked. Unlike most of the others pre=
sent, Skinner was in=20

no hurry to leave. Instead, he loitered in the aisle until Mrs. Stephen Col=
by overtook him on her=20

way down from one of the front pews.  "Why, Mr. Skinner, this _is_ a surpri=
se," exclaimed the=20

social arbiter. Then slyly, "There's some hope for you yet."  "I thought I'=
d come in and make my=20

peace before embarking on a railroad journey," Skinner observed.  "Going aw=
ay?  Not for long, I=20

hope."  "St. Paul.  I'm not carrying a message from the Ephesians--just a b=
usiness trip."  "St.=20

Paul's very interesting."  "I'm glad to hear it."  "You've never been there=
?"  "No."  "Goodness--I=20

know it well."  "What bothers me is, I'm afraid Mrs. Skinner 'll find it du=
ll.  I'm taking her along.  You=20

see, I 'll have lots to do, but she does n't know anybody out there."  The =
social arbiter pondered a=20

moment.  "But she _should_ know somebody. Would you mind if I gave her a le=
tter to Mrs. J.=20

Matthews Wilkinson? Very old friend of mine and very dear.  You'll find her=
 charming. Something=20



of a bore on family.  Her great-grandfather was a kind of land baron out th=
at way."  "It's mighty=20

good of you to do that for Mrs. Skinner."  "Bless you, I'm doing it for you=
, too.  You have n't=20

forgotten that you're a devilish good dancer and you don't chatter all the =
time?" Then, after a=20

pause, "I'm wishing a good thing on the Wilkinsons, too,"--confidentially,-=
-"for I don't mind telling=20

you I've found Mrs. Skinner perfectly delightful.  She's a positive joy to =
me."  "You're all right, Mrs.=20

Colby."  "That's the talk.  Yes, I'm coming along."  She waved her hand to =
Stephen Colby.  "When=20

do you go?"  "To-morrow morning."  "I'll send the letter over this afternoo=
n--and if you don't mind, I=20

'll wire the Wilkinsons that you're coming on."  Skinner impulsively caught=
 her hand.  "Mrs. Colby,=20

you're the best fellow I ever met!"  When the letter arrived at the Skinner=
's house that afternoon,=20

Honey knitted her brows.  "I don't understand it."  "You ought to.  It's fo=
r you."  "Dearie," said=20

Honey, rising, her eyes brimming, "you mean to say that I'm going to St. Pa=
ul with you?"  "Don't=20

have to say it.  Is n't that letter enough?"  "Dearie, you're the most wond=
erful man I ever saw.=20

Think of it!--a letter from Mrs. Colby!  I'll bet those Wilkinsons are swel=
ls!"  "They breathe the Colby=20

stratum of the atmosphere.  It's a special stratum, designed and created fo=
r that select class."  "It's=20

quite intoxicating."  "Special brands usually are."  "I thought those Weste=
