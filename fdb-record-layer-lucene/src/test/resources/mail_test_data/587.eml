milk-white arms, lull his repose,     Nor deep in subtle kisses drown his w=

here no more dwells love, I fly     To seek my home in other lands. For why=
     Should Lilith wait=20

since Adam's empty state     More dear he holds than Lilith desolate?"     =
But answer soft made=20

Adam at the word,     For faint his dying love, yet coldly stirred     Its =
ashen cerements: "Nay, love,=20

our home     Within these garden walls lies safe. Wouldst roam     Without?=
 Sweet peace, by loss,=20

wilt thou restore     One little loss, or miss it evermore?"     "In goodly=
 Eden, Adam, safely bide,=20

But I, for peace, nor love, nor life," she cried,     "Submit to thee. Unto=
 our Lord I own     Allegiance=20

true; my homage his alone.     Oft have I watched the mists athwart yon pea=
ks,     Pursuing oft=20

days ere Love, alas, was dead;     So now, farewell! Ere the new day shall =
break     Adown their=20

gleaming track, my way I take."     She turned; but ere the gate that looke=
d without     She=20

reached, one fleeting moment paused in doubt     Upon a river's brink. In o=
ne swift glance     All=20

reen plains stretching far,=20

And quiet bays, and many a shingly bar,     And troubled seas, with bitter =
perils past,     And elfin=20

shapes that jeering flitted fast     on the acuteness of the observer=E2=80=
=99s eye and the practice he has=20

had, as upon the perfection of the instrument and the fineness of air. It i=
s a mistake to suppose=20

that when the stars appear to be the brightest to the unaided eye, definiti=
on will be at its best,=20

though this may happen; when it does so, the astronomer should make the mos=
t possible use of=20

the opportunity, as such nights are very scarce. As a rule, the best nights=
 are those when there is=20

the slightest possible mistiness of the atmosphere, and for the faintest st=
ars absence of bright=20

moonlight. The 5 inch mirror is guaranteed to divide stars one second apart=
 with ease, and closer=20

ones in very fine air. The 8-1/2 will split such difficult pairs as ^2 Andr=
omed=C3=A6, and ^2 Bo=C3=B6tis. An=20

acute eye will master these stars with even a less aperture on very favoura=
ble occasions, ^2=20

Andromed=C3=A6 having been seen with a 7-inch stop of a 10-inch mirror, and=
 Mr. Sadler, of Honiton=20

Rectory, has split this star with his 6-1/2-inch telescope. It sometimes ha=
ppens on favourable=20

nights that the most difficult objects will be seen with the same telescope=
, which on other=20

occasions had failed to show them as well as a much smaller aperture had do=
ne in very fine air.=20

These remarks equally apply to the observation of minute stars and planetar=
y detail. The amateur=20

must follow the advice of the Rev. T. W. Webb, given in =E2=80=9CCelestial =
Objects=E2=80=9D (pages 15-17), and=20

must cultivate that virtue applicable to all scientific investigation, name=
ly, patience. The following=20

interesting and difficult objects may be looked for, the powers used for th=
eir observation should=20

vary from 150 to 300, and for the very closest stars up to 500, or even sti=
ll higher.         TESTS=20
