teachers of the Negro race, and the prevention of the immigration of workers from the Northern 

States rendered the blacks helpless and dependent upon a few benevolent white ministers of the 

slave communities. During this period of unusual proselyting among the whites, these preachers 

could not minister to the needs of their own race.[1] Besides, even when there was found a white 

clergyman who was willing to labor among these lowly people, he often knew little about the inner 

workings of their minds, and failing to enlighten their understanding, left them the victims of sinful 

habits, incident to the institution of slavery.  [Footnote 1: Jones, _Religious Instruction_, p. 175.]

they eagerly help me to depart.   The world is very good-natured, I find   (Why do worldlings often 

their home condemn?)   And servants are always extremely kind,   If mistresses only are kind to 

them.   'I go to London to meet a friend'--   They are all agreed I want change and rest--   I give a 

direction where they may send,   I take my own maid, and I leave the rest.    I know that detectives

institution had ceased to be the means by which the Negroes of the South could be enlightened. 

The Sabbath-schools in which so many colored people there had learned to read and write had by 

1834 restricted their work to oral instruction.[1] In places where the blacks once had the privilege 

of getting an elementary education, only an inconceivable fraction of them could rise above 

illiteracy. Most of these were freedmen found in towns and cities. With the exception of a few 

slaves who were allowed the benefits of religious instruction, these despised beings were 

generally neglected and left to die like   But the only tear that my eyes let fall   Was dropp'd upon

Sabbath-schools, with an attendance of about 1459.  [Footnote 1: Goodell, _Slave Code_, p. 324.] 

There had never been any regular daily instruction in Christian truths, but after this period only a 

few masters allowed field hands to attend family prayers. Some sections went beyond this point, 

prohibiting by public sentiment any and all kinds of religious instruction.[1] In South Carolina a 

formal remonstrance signed by over 300 planters and citizens was presented to a Methodist 

preacher chosen by a conference of that State as a "cautious and   O why should a wide world
