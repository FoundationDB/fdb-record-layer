 joined us. They came from Newfoundland. I hear that we now have forty-thre=

  This is the list of the fleet. It is written=20

here in the order in which they are sailing. Three warships are heading the=
 fleet; the flagship is the=20

few weeks ago=20

in the Battle of Heligoland.  H.M.S. Diana H.M.S. Eclipse H.M.S. Charybdis =

Contrary to our expectations, the gas (as we are since informed by good aut=
hority) was skilfully=20

prepared and perseveringly used. From the first, the difficulty of breathin=
g and other oppressive=20

affections were relieved: the young lady grew rapidly better, and in a few =
weeks entirely recovered=20

Glory, the vessel on our starboard beam, altered her course to-day and held=
 up a tramp steamer.=20

We could just see the two vessels through our glasses. Apparently everythin=
g was all right as the=20

tramp was allowed to go on her way afterwards.  We are all given our boat s=
tations. This afternoon=20

a submarine alarm was sounded. Everybody on board, including the stewards, =
had to drop=20

everything and chase to the boats. In the excitement a cook shot a "billy" =
of soup over an officer's=20

legs, much to our silent delight.  Thinking it over, it will be remarkable =
if the Germans allow us to=20

cross without making some attempt to sink a few transports. Besides the act=
ual loss of the men,=20

the demoralizing effect it will have on the recruiting would count a great =
deal. No man likes to be=20

shot or drowned without a show.                    ------------------------=
-------------  I am writing this in my=20

cabin, which is only nine feet by six feet and in which six of us sleep at =
night. Besides living in it we=20

have to keep all our equipment clean, which is some job!  About eleven this=
 morning a commotion=20

occurred in the middle line. The cruiser heading it and the second ship, th=
e Royal Edward, turned=20

back. Also several other boats turned in their course. As we have very litt=
le excitement we hoped it=20

might be a German attack, for we all want to see a naval battle. I looked a=
t the cruiser through=20

powerful glasses and saw sailors fixing up the starboard lifeboat, so we pr=
esumed that it was=20

simply a case of "man overboard."  A big cruiser has joined our fleet and i=
s acting as a flank guard=20

about three miles away from our starboard side.  We have a great deal of ph=
ysical exercise in=20

spite of the rolling of the deck. This morning, while in the middle of it I=
 was called away to dress=20

and form part of an escort to the prisoner who was to be tried by field cou=
rt-martial to-day. The=20

court was very dignified, and it took a long time owing to the inexperience=
 of the officers in such=20

matters. It was the first court-martial I have seen,--the proceedings are s=
trictly legal, being=20

conducted according to the book, and with the officers wearing their swords=
. The poor devil=20

expects two years.  We have been pitching and tossing a great deal to-day. =
Physical exercising=20

ng, increased the operation=20

of diuretics, _and has effected her cure_. Whether her disease was hydrotho=
rax, or an anasarcous=20

affection of the lungs, is a matter I believe not settled."  Should the rev=
ival of the experiments on=20

the respiration of oxygen gas appear to be desired, it would not be difficu=
lt to simplify the=20

apparatus and operations so as to bring them within the reach of an intelli=
gent person, even=20

although ignorant of chemistry: and this task, should there be occasion, we=
 would cheerfully=20

undertake to perform.  This interesting class of experiments ought to be re=
sumed, not with the=20

spirit of quackery, or of extravagant expectation, but with the sobriety of=
 philosophical research;=20

and it is more than probable that the nitrous oxyde which is now little mor=
e than a subject of=20

merriment and wonder, if properly diluted and discreetly applied, would be =
productive of valuable=20

effects.     ART. XXIV. _On the Compound Blowpipe. Extract from the Journal=
 de Physique, of=20

Paris, for January 1818._[14]  CONCERNING HEAT.   "Heat, considered as one =
of the most=20

important agents, especially in relation to chemistry, and even to mineralo=
gy, has also been the=20

subject of numerous labours, both with regard to the means of augmenting an=
d of diminishing its=20

effects.  "To the former belong the numerous experiments made, especially i=
n England, with the=20



blowpipe, supplied by a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases. Mr. Clarke ha=
s evidently been=20

more extensively engaged in these researches than any other person, as our =
readers have=20

perceived in the extracts which we have given from the labours of this lear=
ned chemist; but it is=20

proper also to give publicity to the protest (r=C3=A9clamation) made to us =
in favour of Mr. Silliman.  "We=20

have already stated that Mr. Hare, of Philadelphia, first conceived the ide=
a of forming a blowpipe=20

with explosive gas; but as we have not been conversant with the memoirs of =
the Society of Arts=20

and Sciences of Connecticut, we have not made mention of Mr. Silliman.  "Th=
e fact is, that this=20

chemist, Professor at New-Haven, published, on the 7th of May,[15] 1812, a =
memoir containing=20

the results of experiments made upon a very great number of bodies, until t=
hat time reputed to be=20

infusible; and, among others, upon the alkaline earths, the decomposition o=
f which he effected.=20

"The experiments of Mr. Clarke were therefore subsequent; but, having been =
made upon a still=20

more extensive list of substances, they are scarcely less interesting.  "It=
 results then, from the=20

experiments of Messrs.=20


_
on the sloping decks is becoming a mighty risky thing.  Quite a number of t=
he transports have=20

guns mounted on board so they are not entirely dependent on the cruisers. I=
t looks as if we are=20

sailing north of the usual trade routes. I have just heard that five more b=
attleships are on the=20

starboard beam. They came into sight early this morning, but have since bee=
n out of sight. We are=20

sailing north of the trade routes.                    ---------------------=
----------------  The fleet is being=20

increased. All ships are stopped. Those sailing west are allowed to go afte=
r Clarke, Murray, and=20

Ridolfi, that there is really no substance which is infusible in the degree=
 of heat produced by this=20

kind of blowpipe.  "In this new department of physics, it is attempted not =
only to apply the blowpipe=20

to a very great number of bodies, but so to modify the instrument or appara=
tus as to give it the=20

highest degree of convenience, and especially to obviate the danger of expl=
osion."    pp. 38 & 39.=20

REMARKS.  As the results produced by Mr. Hare's Compound Blowpipe, fed by o=
xygen and=20

hydrogen gases, continue to be mentioned in Europe, in many of the=20


_
as ourselves are made to fall into line, so there will be no danger of the =
news of our sailing=20

reaching Europe ahead of us. If we continue to pick up ships sailing in our=
 direction, the fleet will=20

be enormous by the time we arrive at our unknown destination. We sailed two=
 hundred and twelve=20

long since obtained in this country, we republish the following statement o=
f facts, which was, in=20

substance, first published in New-York, more than a year since. It should b=
e observed, that Mr.=20

Tilloch has since published, in the Philosophical Magazine in London, the m=
emoir which contained=20
