"But my tastes don't change, Bianca. It is your mistake to believe they do,=
 neither my tastes in tea=20

nor in friends ever alter."  At this Carlo and Bianca both laughed, althoug=

embarrassment.  "I am going back home too, Bee, very soon," the young man a=
dded. "This is one=20

this argument did not make much of an impression upon the old Colonel, but =
something or other=20

must have, because he asked for an honorable discharge for me and I'm to go=
 home when it=20

arrives. I think the Colonel's chief reason was that I am not much good as =

 laughed.  "I haven't the=20

in the big room.  "If your hair were unbound and you were older you might l=
