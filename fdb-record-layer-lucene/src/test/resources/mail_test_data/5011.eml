, what he entitled =E2=80=9Cswells.=E2=80=9D The scowl on his distressed co=
untenance at first intimated a retreat; but after a survey, _
licked out the delicious contents.  This was the trick that he liked best o=
f all.  Finally he got down=20

on all fours and was horse for three children for several minutes.  They wo=
uld sit astride his back,=20

with their small hands tightly clasping the bear's long, glossy hair, while=
 Pedro slowly led him up=20

and down.  At last the breakfast was set before them and the poor bear, who=
 had done all the=20

work, was glad of his share of hot biscuit and maple syrup.  When they were=
 upon the road again,=20

Pedro began teaching the bear new tricks, for the few that he already knew =
were not enough to=20

satisfy his new master, who thought he saw considerable money in him.  When=
ever they came to=20

a tree that was suitable for climbing, he would lead Black Bruin up to it, =
and shout "climb," at the=20

same time thrusting his pointed stick viciously into the bear's hinder part=
s.  At first, the bear=20

remonstrated and growled, but he got such a drubbing and jabbing that he we=
nt whining up the=20

tree, and when he would not come down Pedro threw stones at him, until he w=
as glad to escape=20

the missiles by obeying.  Much practice of this trick soon made the bear a =
great tree-climber, and=20

he would scratch up the tree at his best pace, at the slightest sign from t=
he Italian.  Next Pedro=20

bought a bottle of ginger pop, which he sweetened considerably to make it e=
ven more palatable=20

for the bear, and then slowly turned out a part of the contents for him to =
lick up.  When this had=20

been done, he put in the cork very slightly and held it up for the bear to =
lick.  Of course the cork=20

soon came out and more of the contents was spilled for the bear to drink.  =
In this way by degrees=20

he taught the brute that the cork must first come out and then there was sw=
eet within.  When the=20

trick was finally mastered, the bear would stand upon his hind legs, take a=
 bottle of ginger pop=20

from a man's hand, hold it between his paws, pull out the cork with his tee=
th, and deliberately drink=20

the contents.  The performance of this trick got Pedro and the bear all the=
 soda water and small=20

drinks that they cared for at the country stores and hotels. Occasionally P=
edro would push the cork=20

in very tight to tease the performer, who would sometimes growl and box the=
 bottle with his paw,=20

to the great delight of the children.  At first the bear did not like beer,=
 but he soon learned, and=20

would drink it down the same as any toper.  Peanuts, pop-corn, corn-cake an=
d candy he also=20

learned to like, and his manner of eating these delicacies always amused th=
e children.=20

Sometimes when he had been doing tricks in a village for hours he would get=
 very tired and lie=20

down and sulk, when Pedro would beat and prod him cruelly.  If the passers-=
by remonstrated with=20

career. To dine with Mr. Brancepeth was a social incident that was mentione=
d. Royalty had=20

consecrated his banquets, and a youth of note was scarcely a graduate of so=
ciety who had not=20

been his guest. There was one person, however, who, in this respect, had no=
t taken his degree,=20

and, as always happens under such circumstances, he was the individual on w=
hom Mr.=20

Brancepeth was most desirous to confer it; and this was St. Aldegonde. In v=
ain Mr. Brancepeth=20

had approached him with vast cards of invitation to hecatombs, and with ins=
inuating little notes to=20

dinners sans falcon; proposals which the presence of princes might almost c=
onstrue into a=20

command, or the presence of some one even more attractive than princes must=
 invest with=20

irresistible charm. It was all in vain. =E2=80=9CNot that I dislike Brancep=
eth,=E2=80=9D said St. Aldegonde; =E2=80=9CI rather=20

like him: I like a man who can do only one thing, but does that well. But t=
hen I hate dinners.=E2=80=9D  But=20

the determined and the persevering need never despair of gaining their obje=
ct in this world. And=20

this very day, riding home from the Castle in the Air, Mr. Brancepeth overt=
ook St. Aldegonde, who=20

was lounging about on a rough Scandinavian cob, as dishevelled as himself, =
listless and=20

groomless. After riding together for twenty minutes, St. Aldegonde informed=
 Mr. Brancepeth, as=20



was his general custom with his companions, that he was bored to very extin=
ction, and that he did=20

not know what he should do with himself for the rest of the day. =E2=80=9CI=
f I could only get Pinto to go with=20

me, I think I would run down to the Star and Garter, or perhaps to Hampton =
Court.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou will not=20

be able to get Pinto today,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Brancepeth, =E2=80=9Cfor he d=
ines with me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat an unlucky fellow I=20

am!=E2=80=9D exclaimed St. Aldegonde, entirely to himself. =E2=80=9CI had m=
ade up my mind to dine with Pinto to-

day.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd why should you not? Why not meet Pinto at my ho=
use?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, that is not my way,=E2=80=9D=20

said St. Aldegonde, but not in a decided tone. =E2=80=9CYou know I do not l=
ike strangers, and crowds of=20

wine-glasses, and what is called all the delicacies of the season.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CYou will meet no one that you=20

do not know and like. It is a little dinner I made for=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D an=
d he mentioned Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI like Lothair,=E2=80=9D=20

said St. Aldegonde, dreamily. =E2=80=9CHe is a nice boy.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWell, you will have him and Pinto to yourself.=E2=80=9D=20

The large fish languidly rose and swallowed the bait, and the exulting Mr. =
Brancepeth cantered off=20

to Hill Street to give the necessary instructions.  Mr. Pinto was one of th=
e marvels of English=20

society; the most sought after of all its members, though no one could tell=
 you exactly why. He was=20

a little oily Portuguese, middle-aged, corpulent, and somewhat bald, with d=
ark eyes of sympathy,=20

not unmixed with=20


_
bear in this manner, Pedro would make the excuse for cruelty so often heard=
 in Italy, where very=20

little consideration is shown animals.  "Huh, lady," he would say, "he no C=
hristian, he just brute.=20

Pedro, Christian, bear, brute, devil."  Whenever Pedro and his companion en=
tered a village, they=20

were always followed by an admiring crowd of children.  As many as could, w=
ould climb upon=20

Black Bruin's back, and ride in triumph through the street, while dozens, w=
ho were less fortunate,=20

followed behind, shouting approval.  Although it was quite a hardship for t=
he bear to carry such a=20

load, yet the petting of the children was a great pleasure to him in these =
days of tribulation.  It=20

reminded him of the children at the farmhouse where every one had been so g=
ood to him.  For,=20

brute that he was, he was still amenable to kindness, and brutalized by bru=
tality.     CHAPTER VII=20

THE VAGABONDS  Pedro and Black Bruin were vagabonds, going up and down the =
country as=20

the spirit moved them, living like two tramps without home, shelter or frie=
nds, save as they made=20

them by the way.  Some nights they slept in haystacks, or in old barns.  So=
metimes they crawled=20

into wagon sheds and slept upon loads of grain or produce that had been got=
ten ready for the=20

morrow's marketing.  More frequently they bivouacked in the open, under the=
 blue canopy of=20

heaven, merely sheltered a little by a friendly spruce or pine, with the si=
lver moon for a lamp, and=20

the bright stars for candles.  The great shaggy beast and the little dark m=
an slept in one bed, as it=20

were.  Pedro usually pillowed his was, and in a country the most scrutinizi=
ng as to personal=20

details, no one inquired or cared to know. A quarter of a century ago an En=
glish noble had caught=20

him in his travels, and brought him young to England, where he had always r=
emained. From the=20

favorite of an individual, he had become the oracle of a circle, and then t=
he idol of society. All this=20

time his manner remained unchanged. He was never at any time either humble =
or pretentious.=20

Instead of being a parasite, everybody flattered him; and instead of being =
a hanger-on of society,=20

society hung on Pinto.  It must have been the combination of many pleasing =
qualities, rather than=20

the possession of any commanding one, that created his influence. He certai=
nly was not a wit yet=20

he was always gay, and always said things that made other people merry. His=
 conversation was=20

sparkling, interesting, and fluent, yet it was observed he never gave an op=
inion on any subject and=20

never told an anecdote. Indeed, he would sometimes remark, when a man fell =
into his=20

anecdotage, it was a sign for him to retire from the world. And yet Pinto r=
arely opened his mouth=20

without everybody being stricken with mirth. He had the art of viewing comm=
on things in a fanciful=20

light, and the rare gift of raillery which flattered the self-love of those=
 whom it seemed sportively=20

not to spare. Sometimes those who had passed a fascinating evening with Pin=
to would try to=20

remember on the morrow what he had said, and could recall nothing. He was n=
ot an intellectual=20

Croesus, but his pockets were full of six-pences.  One of the ingredients o=
f his=20


_
still and not disturb his master, for he got a pounding if he did.  Out her=
e in the open all the night=20

sounds came to them with startling distinctness;--the cry of the nighthawk =
and the chirping of a=20

cricket, the peeping of hylas and the croaking of frogs and the wild, tremu=
lous, mournful cry of the=20

screech-owl.  The night winds blew upon their faces and the fragrance of th=
e dew-laden flowers=20

was in their nostrils.  Theirs was not a cramped, stifling existence, but a=
 full free life, and the sense=20

which was tranquil even when he was droll. He never laughed except with his=
 eyes, and delivered=20

himself of his most eccentric fancies in an unctuous style. He had a rare g=
ift of mimicry, which he=20

used with extreme reserve, and therefore was proportionately effective when=
 displayed. Add to all=20

this, a sweet voice, a soft hand, and a disposition both soft and sweet, li=
ke his own Azores. It was=20

understood that Pinto was easy in his circumstances, though no one know whe=
re these=20

circumstances were.=20


_
breathing, growing things was everywhere, and it made them glad.  The tan o=
f wind and sun was=20

upon Pedro's skin, making it even more swarthy.  In the morning, when the f=
irst faint gray streak lit=20

the east, and robins and thrushes began to sing, they were up and ready for=
 the day's work.  little=20

house in May Fair he sometimes gave a dinner to a fine lady, who was as pro=
ud of the event as=20

the Queen of Sheba of her visit to Solomon the Great.  When St. Aldegonde a=
rrived in Hill Street,=20

and slouched into the saloon with as uncouth and graceless a general mien a=
s a handsome and=20
