BOUCHER ON AMERICAN EDUCATION IN 1773  "You pay far too little regard to pa=
rental=20

education....  "What is still less credible is that at least two-thirds of =
the little education we receive=20

is derived from instructors who are either indented servants or breaking he=
arts, have been=20

marching through on their way to Vladimir.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd without f=
ighting? Ivan Barrinka, it is too bad! So=20

those accursed Nyemtzi will have it all--the glorious, beautiful city of th=
e Czar; the tombs, the=20

treasures of his fathers; the forty times forty churches, the holy pictures=
 of the saints! Woe, woe!=20

Why have we lived to see such days?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CListen, Michael,=E2=
=80=9D said Ivan, arresting the hand with which=20

he was tearing his beard. =E2=80=9CListen to me. The Nyemtzi shall _not_ ha=
ve it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat do you mean,=20

Barrinka?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThis. We will do for holy Moscow--our beautifu=
l, our beloved--what a father would do=20

for an only daughter, a husband for a wife, a brother for a sister, if ther=
e were no other way to save=20

them from those accursed Nyemtzi--our own hands will deal the death-blow.=

 advertised for sale as=20

weavers, tailors, or any other trade; with little other difference, that I =
can hear of, excepting=20

perhaps that the former do not usually fetch so good a price as the latter.=
...  "I own, however, that I=20

dislike slavery and among other reasons because as it is here conducted it =
has pernicious effects=20

on the social state, by being unfavorable to education. It certainly is no =
necessary circumstance,=20

essential to the condition of a slave, that he be uneducated; yet this is t=
he general and almost=20

universal lot of the slaves. Such extreme, deliberate, and systematic inatt=
ention to all mental=20

improvement, in so large portion of our species, gives far too much counten=
ance and=20

encouragement to those abject persons who are contented to be rude and igno=
rant."--Jonathan=20

189.   A PORTION OF AN ESSAY OF BISHOP PORTEUS TOWARD A PLAN FOR THE MORE=
=20

EFFECTUAL CIVILIZATION AND CONVERSION OF THE NEGRO SLAVES ON THE TRENT=20

ESTATE IN BARBADOES BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THE=20

GOSPEL IN FOREIGN PARTS. (WRITTEN IN 1784)  "We are expressly commanded to =
preach=20

the gospel to every creature; and therefore every human creature must neces=
sarily be capable of=20

receiving it. It may be true, perhaps, that the generality of the Negro sla=
ves are extremely dull of=20

apprehension, and slow of understanding; but it may be doubted whether they=
 are more so than=20

some of the lowest classes of our own people; at least they are certainly n=
ot inferior in capacity to=20

the Greenlanders, many of whom have made very sincere Christians. Several t=
ravellers of good=20

credit speak in very favorable terms, both of the understandings and dispos=
itions of the native=20

Africans on the coast of Guinea; and it is a well-known fact, that many eve=
n of the Negro slaves in=20

our islands, although laboring under disadvantages and discouragements, tha=
t might well depress=20

and stupefy even the best understandings, yet give sufficient proofs of the=
 great quickness of parts=20

and facility in learning. They have, in particular, a natural turn to the m=
echanical arts, in which=20

several of them show much ingenuity, and arrive at no small degree of perfe=
ction. Some have=20

discovered marks of genius for music, poetry, and other liberal accomplishm=
ents; and there are=20

not wanting instances among them of a strength of understanding, and a gene=
rosity, dignity, and=20

heroism of mind, which would have done honour to the most cultivated Europe=
an. It is not,=20

therefore, to any natural or unconquerable disability in the subject we had=
 to work upon, that the=20

little success of our efforts is to be ascribed. This would indeed be an in=
superable obstacle, and=20

=9D  =E2=80=9CThese hands of mine will fling the brand into=20

this house, which has been my home ever since I left your village. Nay, mor=
e, I am one of the=20

directors of the secret band commissioned to spread the conflagration.=E2=
=80=9D  Michael stared at him in=20

amazement, but did not speak.  Ivan resumed: =E2=80=9CPerhaps you will thin=
k me dreaming--at least you=20

will wonder by what authority I tell you these strange and awful things. I =
was a boy when last we=20

met, Michael; indeed, until six weeks ago I was little more. Then the war b=
roke out, and the Czar=20

came here. I saw him; not for the first time, Michael Ivanovitch, for it wa=
s he--he and no other--

whom I saw in my childhood=E2=80=99s days ministering to poor unconscious S=
tefen on the bank of the=20

Oka. My heart went forth to him at once, laid itself at his feet, vowed to =
serve him until death.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CSo? Then _you_ fight for love, Ivan Barrinka. _I_ fight for hate.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI too, after what you have told=20

me to-night,=E2=80=9D said Ivan, with flashing eyes. He continued more calm=
ly: =E2=80=9CThen I went to the=20

governor, Count Rostopchine, and told him my story. I said that, though my =
name was of the=20



noblest, I had not, like other boyars, lands, or serfs, or gold to give to =
the Czar; I had only a strong=20

heart, full of devotion. He answered me, for he saw I was in earnest, =E2=
=80=98Such hearts are what we=20

want now.=E2=80=99 Then he told me what to do. At first, Michael, I was hor=
ror-stricken. I had rather have=20

been burned at the stake myself. But he assures me there is no other way of=
 saving holy Russia=20

and the Czar. Moreover, most of the nobles, and all the merchants except se=
ven, have resolved=20

upon the sacrifice of their property. Loss of life we will try to prevent.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI suppose all good=20

Russians, save those who, like you, have work to do, are leaving the city?=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAlmost all; except the=20

=E2=80=98black people,=E2=80=99 who think they have nothing to lose and per=
haps something to gain by the=20

confusion. A few others are remaining on various pretexts; for instance, Co=
untess Wertsch, the=20

owner of this house, obstinately insists upon staying, positively refusing =
to believe that the French=20

will enter the city--a great embarrassment to me, since I cannot burn the h=
ouse over her head. I=20

must get her away somehow. For this and other matters I need advice from my=
 good old friend=20

Petrovitch, and I mean to go to him at daybreak. You shall come with me; I =
should like to tell him=20

what you have done, Michael.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnywhere with you. There wi=
ll be plenty of work for us, and plenty=20

of danger too. All the better for me. But you will be sorry to part with li=
fe, Ivan Barrinka.=E2=80=9D  For a=20

moment Ivan=E2=80=99s face assumed a grave and thoughtful expression; then =
it gradually lighted up, until=20

it absolutely glowed with enthusiasm. =E2=80=9CIf I fall,=E2=80=9D he said,=
 =E2=80=9CCount Rostopchine has promised=20


_
future attempts of the same nature; but as this is far from being the case,=
 we must look for other=20

causes of our disappointment; which may perhaps appear to be, though of a s=
erious, yet less=20

formidable nature, and such as it is in the power of human industry and per=
severance, with the=20

blessing of Providence, to remove. The principal of them, it is conceived, =
are these which here=20

follow:  1. "Although several of our ministers and catechists in the colleg=
e of Barbadoes have been=20

men of great worth and piety, and good intentions, yet in general they do n=
ot appear (if we may=20

judge from their letters to the Board) to have possessed that peculiar sort=
 of talents and name me=20

to the Czar.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER XIV.  THE FORLORN HOPE.    =E2=80=9COh, s=
weet and strange it seems to me,=20

that ere this day is done   The voice that now is speaking may be beyond th=
e sun,   For ever and=20

for ever with those just souls and true;   And what is life that we should =
moan? why make we such=20

ado?=E2=80=9D   The two young men wore out the short summer night in earnes=
t talk. Neither thought of=20

sleep; but Ivan was careful to provide a comfortable repast for Michael, an=
d was by no means=20

reluctant to share it. Very early in the morning they set out on foot for t=
he merchants=E2=80=99 quarter. The=20

shades of night had brought no repose to the doomed city; hour after hour t=

instruction of dull and=20

uncultivated minds requires, and which we sometimes see so eminently and su=
ccessfully=20

displayed in the missionaries of other churches.  "And indeed the and Micha=
el found it extremely=20

difficult to thread their way through the dense confused mass of vehicles a=

crowded every street.  At last they reached the dwelling of Petrovitch. The=

instruction, and of other books and tracts for that purpose, besides they f=
