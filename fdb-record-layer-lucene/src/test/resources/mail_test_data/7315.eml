iron, wine, brandy, paper, and other wares which, being Spanish products, o=
ught to be furnished=20

by Spanish merchants--who, in this fettered condition, are "unable to find =
any way of placing funds=20

in Manila for the purchase of their cargoes." Moreover, "the premiums on in=
surance have been=20

considerably increased for [vessels bearing] the Spanish flag, on account o=
f the risk from the=20

insurgent that the most extraordinary pretensions are the most readily cred=
ited. The capability of=20

the public to judge in such cases is well illustrated by the Grecian story =
of the famous mimic,=20

whose imitation of the grunt of a pig was so perfect, that thousands came t=
o witness his=20

performance. A countryman remarked that he could do still better, and, conc=
ealing a pig under his=20

coat, he stole upon the stage. Pinching the animal=E2=80=99s ear, the pig s=
quealed violently, but the=20

audience hissed the squeak as a=20

merchants to increase, for their part, the expenses for the armament and cr=
ews of their ships."=20

The merchants of Manila have only two commodities to offer to Spanish trade=
, sugar and indigo,=20

and the latter of these is not practicable for the sole lading of a vessel;=
 while if the sugar crop=20

should fail, those merchants are left without other resource, to say nothin=
g of the uncertainty in=20

prices caused by that in the number of foreign customers who will arrive at=
 Manila. The Spanish=20

government, therefore, "should open to the commerce of Espaa with Filipinas=
 a wider range of=20

objects in all the productions of India and China, both natural and industr=
ial, in which commerce=20

can engage in speculation and with which it can furnish cargoes for its shi=
ps;" for the trade in=20

sugar alone is far too inadequate and uncertain to miserable fiasco. Wherea=
t the countryman=20

produced the pig, and left the audience pondering the situation.  The same =
tendency causes men=20

to desire to attribute unusual appearances to causes beyond the domain of n=
atural law. The=20

savage finds thunder and lightning in the discharge of a gun; mysterious ma=
gic in a telescope;=20

downright sorcery in quinine; witchcraft and incantation in a written presc=
ription. If one, a little=20

shrewder than his fellows, after long study of an ant=E2=80=99s nest, conce=
ive the idea that they have a=20

regularly constituted community, with a queen at the head, he needs only to=
 suggest such a thing=20

to his neighbors, to be set down as having communications with the Ant Quee=
n; and he may=20

readily aspire to the chieftainship, thence to be known as the Ant Chief. I=
magination is so much=20

easier than observation.=20

Filipinas. Bernaldez urges forcibly such action by the government, and make=
s these=20

recommendations: That Spanish ships be allowed to trade with Filipinas, wit=
hout any restrictions=20

or duties, save that on foreign goods carried by them a duty of ten per cen=
t be paid, and five per=20

cent on arrival at Manila. That returns from these consignments which consi=
st in products of=20

Filipinas shall be free from any duties or imposts whatsoever, at either en=
d of the voyage or on=20

their circulation in Espaa. That ships may complete their cargoes at Manila=
, if they wish, with any=20

products of India, China, and other Asiatic countries, to the extent of 30 =
toneladas of lading for=20

every 100 toneladas of Philippine products carried in daily retreat, gave r=
