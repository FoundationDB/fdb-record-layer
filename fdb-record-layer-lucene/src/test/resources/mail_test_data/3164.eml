added, as he thought of the cruise of the _Polly Ann_.  "Well, it never rains on this desert," 

commented Mr. Pierce.  "Can't you carry enough water so that if you're four days instead of two 

crossing the desert you'll have plenty?" asked Bony.  "You can only carry just so much," replied 

Tanker Ike. "But don't worry. I was only asking just for fun. I reckon we'll make out all right."  "Were 

you really shipwrecked?" asked Mabel, interestedly turning to Jack.  "Well, yes," he admitted, for 

he disliked to talk about himself.  "Oh, do tell me about it, please. I love to hear real stories of 

adventure."  "And tell her how you knocked out Jerry Chowden," put in Sam. "Say, maybe we'll 

meet him creeping more and more into public worship throughout Christendom! Let us ever bear 

in mind Christ's words in the fourth chapter of John's gospel, which show that true spiritual worship 

is not a matter of special times and special places because it is of all times and all places: 

"Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, 

worship the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the 

Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they

"I hope not," responded Jack, and then he told Mabel of his ocean cruise.  "Everybody hold on 

tight now," cautioned Mr. Blender about an hour later, as he set the brake of the wagon and called 

back a warning to the driver of the freight vehicle.  "Why?" asked Jack.  "There's a bad hill just 

ahead, and I've got more of a load on than I usually carry. But I guess we'll make it all right," and 

he gathered the reins in a firmer grip and braced himself on the seat.  A few minutes later they 

came to a turn in the road, and started down a dangerous descent of the bluff that bordered the 

valley of the desert.  The brake began to screech on the wheels, and the horses threw themselves 

almost on their Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain."  I was greatly amazed 

not long ago in talking to a man who thought he was a Christian, to find that once in a while, when 

he got angry, he would swear. I said: "My friend, I don't see how you can tear down with one hand 

what you are trying to build up with the other. I don't see how you can profess to be a child of God 

and let those words come out of your lips."  He replied: "Mr. Moody, if you knew me you would 

understand. I have a very quick temper. I inherited it from my father and mother, and it is
