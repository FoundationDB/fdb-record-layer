Of course his reverence allowed them all to look at her in turn, to pat her and smooth her hair; some of philodendron monstera numerous inequalities of the ground, gaining in the race until he was within twenty yards of the tetel, when we lost sight of both game and hunter in little angel?

who were gathering gum arabic from the mimosas; upon seeing us, they immediately waddled off. 

"Would the lady like to have a girrit (baboon)?" exclaimed the ever-excited Jali: being answered in 

the affirmative, away dashed the three hunters in full gallop after the be made broader eight years 

before, they were obliged to take a bit of the cemetery in order to do it, and when they had opened 

Andras's grave, so as to bury him again, they saw with astonishment that he had a long beard, 

though five witnesses swore to the fact that at

off at their best speed. The ground was rough, being full of broken hollows, covered scantily with 

mimosas, and the stupid baboons, instead of turning to the right into the rugged and steep valley 

of the Settite, where they would have been secure from the aggageers, kept a straight course 

before the horses. It was a curious hunt; some of the very young baboons were riding on their 

mothers' backs: these were now going at their best pace, holding on to their maternal steeds, and 

looking absurdly human; but, in a few minutes, as we closely followed the Arabs, we were all in the 

midst of the herd, and with great dexterity two of the aggageers, while at full speed, stooped like 

falcons from their saddles, and seized each a half-grown ape by the back of the neck and hoisted 

them upon the necks of the horses. Instead of biting, as I had expected, the astonished captives 

sat astride of the horses, and clung tenaciously with both arms to the necks of their steeds, 

screaming with fear. The hunt was over, and we halted to secure the prisoners. Dismounting, to 

my surprise the Arabs immediately stripped from a mimosa several thongs of bark, and having tied 

the baboons by the neck, they gave them a merciless whipping with their powerful coorbatches of 

hippopotamus hide. It was in vain that I remonstrated against this harsh treatment; they persisted 

in the punishment, otherwise they declared that the baboons would bite, but if well whipped they 

would become "miskeen" (humble). At length my wife insisted upon mercy, and the unfortunate 

captives wore an expression of countenance like prisoners about to be led to execution, and they 

looked imploringly at our faces, in which they evidently discovered some sympathy with their fate. 

They were quickly placed on horseback before their captors, and once more we continued our 

journey, highly amused with the little entr'acte.  We had hardly ridden half a mile, when I perceived 

a fine bull tetel (Antelopus Bubalis) standing near a bush a few hundred yards distant. Motioning to 

the party to halt, I dismounted, and with the little Fletcher rifle I endeavoured to obtain a shot. 

When within about a hundred and seventy yards, he observed our death he was clean-shaven. 

So they were all quite sure that old Andras was in Heaven, and having been an old cheat all his 

life he would, of course, manage even up above to leave the door open a bit now and then, so that 

his dear Agnes could have a peep at what was going on.  But Pal Kvapka, the bell-ringer, had 

another tale to tell. He said that when he had gone up the belfry to ring the clouds away, and had 

turned round for a minute, he saw the form of an old Jew crossing the fields beyond the village, 

and he had in his hands that immense red thing like a plate, which his reverence had found spread 

over the basket. Kvapka had thought nothing of it at the time, for he was sleepy, and the wind blew 

the dust in his eyes, but he could take an oath that what he had told them had really taken place. 

(And Pal Kvapka was a man who always spoke the truth.) Others had also seen the Jew. He was 

old, tall, gray-haired, his back was bent, and he had a crook in his hand, and when the wind 

carried his hat away, they saw that he had a large bald place at the back of his head.  "He was just 

like the picture of St. Peter in the church," said the sacristan, who had seen him without his hat. 

"He was like it in every respect," he repeated, "except that he had no keys in his hand." From the 

meadow he had cut across Stropov's clover-field, where the Kratki's cow, which had somehow got 

loose, made a rush at him; in order to defend himself he struck at it with his stick (and from that 

time, you can ask the Kratki family if it is not true, the cow gave fourteen pints of milk a day, 

whereas they used to have the greatest difficulty in coaxing four pints from it).  At the other end of 

the village the old man had asked the miller's servant-girl which was the way to Lehota, and Erzsi 

had told him, upon which he had started on the footpath up the mountains. Erzsi said she was 



sure, now she came to think of it, that he had a glory round his head.  Why, of course it must have 

been St. Peter! Why should it not have been? There was a time when he walked about on earth, 

and there are many stories told still as to all he had done then. And what had happened once 

could happen again. The wonderful 


_
approached unseen to a closer distance, had his attention not been attracted by the noise of the 

horses. He threw his head up preparatory to starting off, and he was just upon the move as I 

touched the trigger. He fell like a stone to the shot, but almost immediately he regained his feet, 

and bounded off, receiving a bullet from the second barrel without a flinch; in full speed he rushed 

that God had sent down from Heaven a sort of red-linen tent, to keep the rain off the priest's little 

sister, and had chosen St. Peter himself for the mission. Thereupon followed a good time for the 

child, she became quite the fashion in the village. The old women began to make cakes for her, 

also milk puddings, and various other delicacies. His reverence had nothing to do but answer the 


_
yards distant. Out dashed Abou Do from the ranks on his active grey horse, and away he flew 

after the wounded tetel; his long hair floating in the wind, his naked sword in hand, and his heels 

digging into the flanks of his horse, as though armed with spurs in the last finish of a race. It was a 

beautiful course; Abou Do hunted like a cunning greyhound; the tetel turned, and taking advantage 

of the double, he cut off the angle; succeeding by the manoeuvre, he again followed at 

tremendous speed over the from his visitors plates, dishes, or basins wrapped up in clean cloths. 

The poor young priest could not make out what was going on in his new parish.  "Oh, your 

reverence, please, I heard your little sister had come, so I've brought her a trifle for her dinner; of 

course it might be better, but it is the best such poor folks as we can give. Our hearts are good, 

your reverence, but our flour might be better than it is, for that good-for-nothing miller burned it a 

bit the last time--at least, that part
