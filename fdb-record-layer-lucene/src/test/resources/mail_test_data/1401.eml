philodendron monstera supplied a necessary word to complete the sense, that=
 word has been left in the text distinguished by a different type[1]. Once =
more, the early and wilder _soorahs_ were almost wholly omitted in the firs=
t edition, whilst the later more dogmatic and less poetical _soorahs_ were =
