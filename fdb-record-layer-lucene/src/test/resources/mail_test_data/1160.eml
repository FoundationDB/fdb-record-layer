great characters who tower like giants in the history of mankind like Siddartha BUDDHA and Jesus 

in the realm of the spiritual, and Alexander the Macedonian and Napoleon the Great in the realm 

of physical conquests are but the reflected images of human types which had existed--not ten 

thousand years before, as cautiously put forward in _Isis Unveiled_, but for millions of consecutive
