dracaena marginata attracted and easily caught. In fact, in his heavy-lidde=

his is real! I was=20

dreaming! And after all, this is much the same, but different in the way yo=
u get it. This is New York.=20

One thing is sure," she added. "Amy needs every dollar Joe can make--and sh=
e must not have me=20

on her hands. I've got to find what I really want--a job or a man--and be q=
uick about it!"  It threw a=20

tinge of uneasiness into those breathless shopping tours. And it changed he=
r attitude toward Joe.=20

He had not counted for much at first; he had been a mere man of business; a=
nd business men had=20

had little place in her dreams of friends in the city. But watching him now=
 she changed her mind.=20

Joe Lanier was what is called "a speculative builder." He was an architect,=
 building contractor and=20

real estate gambler, all in one. He put up apartment buildings "on spec," b=
uildings of the cheaper=20

sort, most of them up in the Bronx, and sold them at a profit--or a loss, a=
s the case might be. He=20

dealt in the rapidly shifting values of neighbourhoods in the changing town=
. "The gamble in it is the=20

fun," he remarked to Ethel one evening. Joe was just the kind of a man, as =
Amy had told her=20

sister, to make a big sudden success of his work. Unfortunately he was tied=
 to a partner, Nourse=20

by name, who held him back. This man Amy keenly disliked. She said that Nou=
rse was a perfect=20

grind, a heavy tiresome creature who thought business was everything in the=
 world.  "Sometimes I=20

really believe he forgets it's for making money," Amy declared. "He's as an=
xious about it as an old=20

hen, and he wants it steady as a cow. He detests me, as I do him. He has st=
opped coming here,=20

thank heaven. And the time is not so far away when I'll make Joe see that h=
e's got to lose his=20

partner."  Joe's image gained steadily in importance to Ethel's awakening e=
yes. Of his force as a=20

man, all that she saw made her more and more certain that Amy was right. Jo=
e was the kind who=20

was bound to succeed. He not only worked hard, his work was a passion. At n=
ight and on Sunday=20

mornings he could sit for hours absorbed in the tiresome pages of real esta=
te news in his paper.=20

He went out for strolls in the evenings; one night he asked Ethel to come a=
long; and his talk to her=20

about buildings, the growth of the city by leaps and bounds, now in this di=
rection, now in that,=20

caught her imagination at once. Joe felt the town as a living thing, as she=
 had felt it that first night.=20

Different? Yes, this was business. But even business, to her surprise, as J=
oe saw and felt it, had a=20

strange thrilling romance of its own.  And she soon noticed something else =
that drew her to Joe.=20

Almost every evening he would sit down at his piano and start playing idly.=
 As a rule he played=20

dance music, popular songs from Broadway. But sometimes leaning back he wou=
ld drift into other=20

music. And though his hand would bungle and only sketch it, so to speak--in=
 his black eyes,=20

scowling slightly over the smoke of his cigar, would come a look which Ethe=
l liked. But vaguely=20

she felt that Amy did not, that it even made her uneasy. For almost invaria=
bly at such times, Amy=20

would come behind him, her plump softly rounded arm would find its way down=
 over his shoulder--

and little by little the music would change and would come back to Broadway=
.  When Joe heard=20

one evening that Ethel was "mad to learn to sing," he took her by the arm a=
t once and marched=20

her over to the piano. And they had quite a session together--till Amy sugg=
ested going out to a=20

new cabaret she had heard of that day. Her voice sounded hurt and strained.=
 And Ethel from that=20

night on dropped all mention of singing.  Her curiosity deepened toward thi=
s city love affair, this=20

husband and wife who apparently had left so many things out of their lives,=
 things vital in the Ohio=20

town. The sober wee girl in the nursery kept just as quiet as before. Often=
 Ethel opened that door=20

and went in and tried to make friends with its grave shy little inmate and =
the hostile nurse. And=20

returning to her room she would frown and wonder for a time. But the pretty=
 things piling in from=20



the shops, and the gay anticipations, soon crowded such questioning out of =
her mind. Swiftly this=20

household was growing more real, the rooms familiar, intimate; the day's ro=
utine with its small=20

events were becoming parts of her life. Her own room was familiar now, for =
by many touches=20

she'd made it her own. And the dining-room and the living room, where she g=
rew acquainted with=20

Joe, these too assumed an intimate air. Most of all, her sister's room grew=
 more and more vivid in=20

her thoughts, though this was still far from familiar, It held too much, it=
 meant too much.  "Shall I=20

ever live with a man like that?"  The way they looked at each other at time=
s! The way they seemed=20

keeping watch on each other. If Joe were out very late at night, Amy would =
almost invariably grow=20

uneasy and absentminded, and there would be a challenging note in the way s=
he greeted him on=20

his return. On one such occasion Ethel was in Amy's room. She went out when=
 Joe came in; but a=20

queer little gasping sigh behind gave her a start and a swift thrill, for a=
lthough she did not turn=20

around she knew they were in each other's arms. And again, late one afterno=
on when the sisters=20

came home and found Joe at work with a tired anxious look on his face, his =
wife came up behind=20

him. And the picture of her small gloved hand upon Joe's heavy shoulder rem=
ained in Ethel's=20

memory. It seemed so soft and yet so strong.  "She can do anything with him=
 she likes. When I=20

marry somebody how will it be?"  Upon the living-room mantel was a photogra=
ph of Amy. And on=20

the smooth and pretty face with the lips slightly parting, and in the smili=
ng violet eyes, there was=20

the expression of something which Ethel did not quite name to herself--for =
she had forgotten the=20

night long ago in her high-school club when they had sturdily tackled the w=
ord "sensual" and what=20

it meant. But the picture grew familiar and real, filled in by the living p=
resence here of this woman=20

who so carefully tended her beautiful body, her glossy hair, her cheeks and=
 lips; this sister with so=20

many moods, now intent and watchful, now good-humoured, indolent, now expec=
tant, hungry, now=20

smilingly content and gay.  And as the picture grew more real, warm and clo=
se and thrilling, it=20

symbolized for Ethel that mysterious force which she could feel on every si=
de, driving the throngs=20

of humanity--in this city where so many things she had once deemed importan=
t were fading rapidly=20

away. That hungry hope of a singer's career, that craving for work and self=
-education, trips to=20

Paris, London, Rome, books, art and clever people, "salons," brilliant disc=
ussions of life; and=20

deeper still, those mysterious dreams about having children and making a ho=
me--all began to drop=20

behind, so quietly and easily that she barely noticed the change.  For this=
 was happening in a few=20

weeks, in the first whirl and excitement of those dazzling streets and shop=
s, those models, gowns,=20

hats, gloves and shoes. "It's not what you say that interests men--it's how=
 you look and what you=20

have on." The image of her sister grew vivid in Ethel's eager mind. And wit=
h it came the question,=20

now ardent though still a little confused:  "Shall I ever be like that?"   =
 CHAPTER IV  Ethel had=20

been about four weeks in town, and now she was to meet Amy's friends. Amy w=
as giving a dinner=20

the next evening in her honour; and to let the cook and the waitress have a=
 rest on the preceding=20

night, Joe took Amy and Ethel out to dine in a cafe. His business had gone =
well that week and Joe=20

was a genial husband. They had a sea-food supper and later he took them to =
a play. When they=20

came home, Ethel went to her room, for she felt very tired. It was not long=
 before she was asleep.=20

She was awakened by Joe, half dressed.  "Amy is sick!" he said sharply. "Go=
 in and help her, will=20

you? I'll try to get a doctor!"  On Amy's bed, a little later, Ethel saw a =
face so changed from the one=20

of a few hours before, that she felt her heart jump into her throat. Amy's =
face was ugly and queer,=20

distorted by frequent spasms of pain. But worse was the terror in her eyes.=
  "Ethel, I think I'm=20



dying!" she cried. "Something I ate--it poisoned me!" There was a violent c=
atch in her breath.=20

"Amy! Why, you poor little darling!" Ethel held her sister tight, asked qui=
ck anxious questions and=20

did things to relieve her, but with little or no success. It seemed hours t=
ill Joe came back. With him=20

was a doctor, who made an examination and then took Joe into the hall. Ethe=
l followed anxiously.=20

She heard the doctor questioning Joe, and she heard him say:  "I'm afraid i=
t's ptomaine.  "What=20

does _that_ mean?" Joe fiercely inquired. But before Ethel could hear the r=
eply she was called=20

back into the bedroom, where on her bed with both hands clenched Amy was sa=
ying:  "I can't bear=20

this! Make him give me something--quick!"  The rest of the night was a blur=
 and a haze, of which=20

Joe was the centre--Joe half crazed and impatient, making impossible demand=
s.  "You can't get a=20

nurse in a minute, my friend, at five A. M.," the doctor cried. "I'm doing =
my best, if you'll give me a=20

chance!"  The fight went on. The nurse arrived, and turning to Ethel the do=
ctor said, "Get him out=20

of this." And she took Joe into the living-room. But there with a sudden cu=
rse and a groan he=20

began to walk the floor.  "This doctor--what do we know of him? He was all =
I could find! We=20

haven't been to a doctor in years! . . . Ah--that's it!" And he went to the=
 telephone, where in a few=20

moments she heard him saying tensely, "Bill, old man, I'm in trouble." And =
she thought, "It's his=20

partner."  "What have you done?" she asked him.  "Got Bill Nourse on the 'p=
hone. He's bringing=20

another doctor."  "But Joe! You should have asked this one first!"  "Should=
 I?" was his distracted=20

reply.  The second physician soon arrived, and was as surprised and annoyed=
 as the first one=20

when he found how he had been summoned. In a moment with angry apologies he=
 was backing=20

out of the door. But Joe caught his arm.  "You two and your etiquette be da=
mned! Go in and look=20

at that woman!" he cried. And with a glance into Joe's eyes, the second doc=
tor turned to the first,=20

muttered, "Hold this man. He's crazy "--and went into the bedroom.  It was =
long before Ethel forgot=20

the look that appeared on Joe's face when the second physician came out and=
 said:  "I'm sorry.=20

There's nothing I can do."  She went in with Joe to Amy. And her sister loo=
ked so relieved, the=20

lines of pain all smoothed away. Heavily drugged, she was nearly asleep. He=
r hand felt for Joe's=20

and closed on it, and with a little nestling movement of her soft lovely bo=
dy she murmured smiling:=20

"Oh, so tired and sleepy now."  Again, in spite of her grief and fright, Et=
hel noticed how her sister's=20

hand closed on that of her husband. In the months and years that followed, =
she recalled it vividly=20

so many times.  Joe sat there long after Amy was dead.   The doctor signed =
to Ethel to come into=20

the living-room.  "Are you to be in charge?" he asked. She looked at him an=
d shivered. She felt a=20

pang of such loneliness as she had never known before.  "I know nobody--not=
hing--I don't know=20

how you arrange," she said. "I've only been a month in town."  The doctor g=
ave her a curious look=20

of pity and uneasiness. It was as though he had told her, "I'm sorry, but d=
on't count on me for help.=20

I'm busy. This is New York, you know." He said:  "I'll see to the undertake=
r." She shivered again,=20

and he added, "Don't you know some older woman here?"  This reminded her of=
 the dinner which=20

Amy was to have given that night. A lump rose in her throat. She waited a m=
oment and then she=20

said:  "Yes, I know of several."  "That's good. You'd better send for them.=
" And soon afterward he=20

hurried away.  But just as Ethel was rising to go to the telephone, there w=
as a ring at the door. She=20

opened it, and a tall man, rather stooped, with iron grey hair and moustach=
e, a lean but rather=20

heavy face and deep-set impassive eyes, came in and said:  "I'm Joe's partn=
er--Nourse, you=20

know. How is it going? Better?"  "She's dead."  "God!" With that low exclam=
ation, she thought she=20

saw a gleam of shock but then of triumph come in his eyes. He went into Joe=
's room, and closed=20



the door; and with a mingling of relief and of sharp hostility she felt at =
once how she was shut out.=20

Who was she but a stranger now? She thought of Amy, and with a quick cry Et=
hel began to walk=20

up and down in a scared hunted fashion. She stopped with a sudden resolute =
clenching of her=20

teeth, and said, "Now I've got to do something! If I don't, I'll go right o=
ut of my mind!" But what?=20

She stared about her, then went to the windows and threw back the curtains.=
 It was well along=20

toward noon. Daylight flooded into the room, with one yellow path of light =
which came down from=20

the distant sun.  "I'll go out and get her some flowers."  When she came ba=
ck a half hour later,=20

Ethel still had that resolute look. The door of Joe's room was still closed=
 and she saw Nourse's hat=20

in the hall. She turned and went to the telephone, stopped and frowned.  "Y=
es, that's the next=20

thing."  She called up Amy's friend Fanny Carr. But at the sound of the wom=
an's voice which came=20

back over the wire, Ethel gave a start of dismay. For it had a jarring qual=
ity, and although it was=20

prompt in its exclamations of shocked surprise and sympathy and proffers of=
 help--the words,=20

"You poor child, I'll come over at once!"--made Ethel inwardly beseech her,=
 "Oh, no, no! Please=20

stay away!" Aloud she said, "Thank you," put up the receiver and stood star=
ing at the wall. Was=20

this Amy's best friend?  "I want some one I know!" She thought of Susette. =
She went at once to=20

the nursery, kissed the wee girl and sat down on the floor. And as they bui=
lt a house of blocks,=20

Ethel could feel herself softening, the strained tight sensation going. Sud=
denly in her hot dry eyes=20

she felt in a moment the tears would come.  "What's to become of me and thi=
s child?"  She turned=20

with a start and met the unfriendly eyes of the nurse. They had a jealous l=
ight in them.  "You'll stay=20

here, of course," said Ethel. "Surely you are not thinking of going--"  "No=
. Are you?"  A little cold=20

sensation struck into her spine at the tone of that question.  "I haven't d=
ecided yet on my plans.=20

Hadn't you better take Susette out to the Park?"  "All right."  "And keep h=
er there as much as you=20

can--till it's over."  "All right," said the nurse again.  Ethel went out o=
f the room. Were there only=20

strangers here?  Just after that Fanny Carr arrived, and Ethel had a feelin=
g at once of a shrewd=20

strong personality. A woman of about medium height, still young but rather =
over-developed,=20

artificial and overdressed, with a full bust and thick red lips and lustrou=
s eyes of greenish grey--her=20

beauty was of the obtrusive type that is made to catch the eye on the stree=
t and in noisy crowded=20

rooms. When Fanny kissed her, Ethel shrank. "I mustn't do that!" she exclai=
med to herself. But the=20

other woman had noticed it and shot a little look at her.  "You poor girl. =
I can't tell you how sorry I=20

feel," she was saying. "It's horrible. Tell me about it."  And Ethel in a l=
ifeless voice recounted the=20

tragedy of the night.  "Where's Joe?"  "In there, with his partner."  "Oh, =
Mr. Nourse. He would be."=20

Mrs. Carr threw a glance of dislike at the door. "And you, my dear--I won't=
 ask you now what are=20

your plans. Just let me help you. What can I do? There's that dinner tonigh=
t, to begin with. Have=20

you let the people know?"  "Not yet--"  "Have you a list of the ones who we=
re asked?"  "I think=20

there's one on Amy's desk."  "Then I'll attend to it."  Soon Fanny was at t=
he telephone. Her voice,=20

hard and incisive, kept talking, stopping, talking again, repeating it to f=
riend after friend, and=20

making it hard, abrupt and real, stripping it of its mystery, making it nak=
ed and commonplace, like=20

a newspaper item--Amy's death. And Ethel sat rigid, listening.  "Amy's best=
 friend! Oh, how=20

strange!"  Suddenly she remembered things Amy had said about this friend--a=
dmiring things. She=20

bit her lips.  "What a queer time for hating a person. But I hate you--oh, =
I hate you!" She went to=20

the window and frowned at the street and slowly again got control of hersel=
f. "What's wrong with=20

me? Why am I so dull I ought to be doing something. But what?" Again came t=
he voice from the=20



telephone, and again she clenched her hands. "How did you make Amy take you=
 for a friend? Oh,=20

what difference does it make?"  But it did make a difference. The presence =
of Fanny got on her=20

nerves; and when a little later two of the dinner guests arrived, to exclai=
m and pity and offer their=20

help, she faced them and thought:  "You're all alike! You're all just hard =
and over-dressed! You're=20

cheap! Oh, please--please go away!"  The two visitors seemed glad enough to=
 find she did not=20

want them here, that she was not going to cling to them and make this abyss=
 she was facing a=20

region they must face by her side. In their eyes again she caught the look =
she had seen on the=20

face of the doctor. "After all, this is not my affair."  The two women left=
 her. Fanny, too, soon went=20

out on an errand. And no other woman came to her that day. How different fr=
om the Ohio town.=20

Only once a girl came from the dressmaker's.  But just after Fanny had gone=
 out, Joe's partner=20

came into the living-room. In the last few hours several times she had hear=
d his voice as he talked=20

with Joe. Deep, heavy and gruff, it had yet revealed a tenderness that had =
given to Ethel a sudden=20

thrill--which she had forgotten the next moment, for her thoughts kept spin=
ning so. But now as he=20

looked down at her she saw in his gaunt lean face a reflection of that tend=
erness; and there was a=20

pity in his voice which set her lip to quivering.  "The sooner we have this=
 over," he said, "the better=20

it will be for Joe."  "Yes."  "Tomorrow!"  "Yes."  "At four!"  "All right."=
  "I'll see to it."  "Thank you."=20

There was a pause.  "Is there any special cemetery? You have any preference=
?" he asked.  "I=20

don't know any in New York." And again there was a silence.  "You haven't b=
een here long," he=20

said.  "You'll be going back now to your home, I suppose."  "I haven't any.=
"  "Oh," he said. She=20

glanced up and saw a gleam of uneasiness in his steady tired eyes. She shra=
nk a little.  "You have=20

no relatives living?" he asked.  "None that I care about," she replied. She=
 swallowed prior to its=20

passage, to receive a certificate under former act. But all persons holding=
 a certificate on account=20

of ten years=E2=80=99 practice are subject to all requirements and discipli=

Act March 9th, 1891).  A license issued to a person who has not complied wi=

PENALTY.=E2=80=94Practising medicine, surgery, or obstetrics without a lice=
nse is a misdemeanor=20

punishable with a fine of from $10 to $200 (_ib._, s. 4).  No cause of acti=

he duty of all physicians=20

and accoucheurs to register their name and post-office address with the cle=
rk of the circuit court of=20

the county in which they reside (Act 1881, p. 37, s. 10).  FEES.=E2=80=94To=

ng medicine, surgery, or=20

obstetrics, in any of their departments, if a graduate in medicine, must pr=
esent his diploma to the=20

State board of examiners for verification as to its genuineness. If the dip=
loma is found genuine,=20

and is by a medical school legally organized and of good standing, which th=
e board determines,=20

and if the person presenting be the person to whom it was originally grante=
d, then the board must=20

issue a certificate signed by not less than five physicians thereof, repres=
enting one or more=20

physicians of the schools on the board (_sic_), and such certificate is con=
clusive. If not a graduate,=20

a person practising medicine or surgery, unless in continuous practice in t=
his State for not less=20

than five years, of which he must present to the board satisfactory evidenc=
e in the form of=20

affidavits, must appear before the board for examination. All examinations =
are in writing; all=20

examination papers with the reports and action of examiners are preserved a=
s records of the=20

board for five years. The subjects of examination are anatomy, physiology, =
general chemistry,=20

pathology, therapeutics, and the principles and practice of medicine, surge=
ry, and obstetrics. Each=20

applicant, upon receiving from the secretary of the board an order for exam=
ination, receives also a=20

confidential number, which he must place upon his examination papers so tha=
t, when the papers=20

are passed upon, the examiners may not know by what applicant they were pre=
pared. Upon each=20

day of examination all candidates are given the same set or sets of questio=
ns. The examination=20

papers are marked on a scale of 100. The applicant must attain an average d=
etermined by the=20

board; if such examination is satisfactory to at least five physicians of t=
he board, representing the=20

different schools of medicine on the board, the board must issue a certific=
ate, which entitles the=20

lawful holder to all the rights and privileges in the act provided (Laws 18=
86, c. 104, s. 1).  The=20

board receives applications through its secretary. Five physicians of the b=
oard may act as an=20

examining board in the absence of the full board; provided that one or more=
 members of the=20

different schools of medicine represented in the State board of health shal=
l also be represented in=20



the board of examiners (_ib._, s. 2).  The affidavit of the applicant and h=
older of a diploma that he=20

is the person therein named, and is the lawful possessor thereof, is necess=
ary to verify the same,=20

with such other testimony as the board may require. Diplomas and accompanyi=
ng affidavits may=20

be presented in person or by proxy. If a diploma is found genuine and in po=
ssession of the person=20

to whom it was issued, the board, on payment of the fee to its secretary, m=
ust issue a certificate. If=20

a diploma is found fraudulent or not lawfully in possession of the holder o=
r owner, the person=20

presenting it, or holding or claiming possession, is guilty of a misdemeano=
r, punishable with a fine=20

of from $20 to $100 (_ib._, s. 3).  The certificate must be recorded in the=
 office of the county=20

recorder in the county wherein the holder resides, within sixty days after =
its date. Should he=20

remove from one county to another to practise medicine, surgery, or obstetr=
ics, his certificate must=20

be recorded in the county to which he removes. The recorder must indorse up=
on the certificate the=20

date of record (_ib._, s. 4).  Any one failing to pass is entitled to a sec=
ond examination within=20

twelve months without a fee; any applicant for examination, by notice in wr=
iting to the secretary of=20

the board, is entitled to examination within three months from the time of =
notice, and the failure to=20

give such opportunity entitles such applicant to practise without a certifi=
cate until the next regular=20

meeting of the board. The board may issue certificates to persons who, upon=
 application, present=20

a certificate of having passed a satisfactory examination before any other =
State board of medical=20

examiners, upon the payment of the fee provided in sec. 3 (_ib._, s. 6, as =
amended c. 66, Laws=20

1888, 22 Gen. Assembly).  The board may refuse a certificate to a person wh=
o has been convicted=20

of felony committed in the practice of his profession, or in connection the=
rewith; or may revoke for=20

like cause, or for palpable evidence of incompetency, and such refusal or r=
evocation prohibits=20

such person from practising medicine, surgery, or obstetrics, and can only =
be made with the=20

affirmative vote of at least five physicians of the State board, in which m=
ust be included one or=20

more members of the different schools of medicine represented in the said b=
oard; the standing of=20

a legally chartered medical college from which a diploma may be presented m=
ust not be=20

questioned except by a like vote (_ib._, s. 7).  DEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.=E2=

assembly must=20

provide for the interest of State medicine in all its departments, and for =
the protection of the people=20

from unqualified practitioners of medicine (Const. 1879, Art. 178).  QUALIF=
ICATION.=E2=80=94No person=20

is allowed to practise medicine or surgery as a means of livelihood in any =
of its departments=20

without first making affidavit before a judge, justice of the peace, clerk =
of district court, or notary=20

public in the parish wherein he resides, of his having received the degree =
of doctor of medicine=20

from a regularly incorporated medical institution of respectable standing, =
in America or in Europe,=20

and designating its name and locality, and the date of his diploma; the deg=

diploma, and the respectable standing of the institution is evidenced by th=
e indorsement or=20

certificate of the State board of health, written on the face of the diplom=
a, and signed by its=20

secretary; the affidavit must contain the full name of the person making th=

place of his birth, and the names of the places where he may have previousl=
y practised medicine=20

or surgery; a record of the diplomas certified must be presented by the Sta=
te board of health, and=20

copies thereof, certified by the secretary, are received in evidence. The S=

 indorsement on the original=20

affidavit, which the affiant must transmit to the State board of health; a =

it was made, the date and=20

place where he began the practice of medicine in Louisiana, and the names o=
f the places where=20

he may have previously practised medicine or surgery such affidavit must be=
 transmitted or=20

delivered to the State board of health, and entitles the affiant to be plac=
ed on the list of registered=20

physicians or surgeons. The State board of health must preserve said affida=
vits, and a copy=20

signed by the secretary is received in evidence by the courts. To make a fa=

(_ib._, s. 3).  EVIDENCE.=E2=80=94A copy of the affidavit recorded by the c=
lerk of the district court,=20

_
scattered--gone West. We lost track of them."  "Oh. . . . Then do you inten=
d to stay here?"  "For=20

awhile--if Joe wants me."  "I'll take care of Joe." Though the voice was lo=
w, it had an anxious=20

jealous note which made her shiver slightly.  "There's the child," she remi=
nded him sharply. "Why=20

not take it away?" he asked. "Joe never cared for it, did he? Do you think =
it has been happy here?"=20

And at that she could have struck him. At her glare he turned away.  "Forgi=
ve me. Of course I--

should not have said that." A pause. "Nor talked of your plans. I'm not mys=
elf. Sorry for Joe.=20

Forgive me." He turned away from her, frowning. "I'll see to everything," h=
e said, and she heard=20

him leave the apartment.  And all the rest of the day and the night and thr=
ough the morning which=20

followed, no one else came but professional men, and Mrs. Carr. She came an=
d went; and her=20

voice grew familiar--hard, intrusive, naked. And the thought kept rising in=
 Ethel's mind, like a flash=20

of revelation in all the storm and blackness:  "This kind of a woman was Am=
y's best friend!"   The=20

funeral was soon over, and of its ugly details only a few remained in her m=
ind. She had a glimpse=20

of Amy's face down in the handsome coffin, and at the sight she turned away=
 with a swift pang of=20

self-reproach. "I shouldn't have let Fanny do that!" Fanny had dressed her =
sister.  She=20

remembered the low respectful voice of the building superintendent: "There'=
s an afternoon tea on=20

the floor below, so the casket and the funeral guests had better go down by=
 the freight elevator."=20

She gave a strained little laugh at that and asked, "I wonder when I'll cry=
?"  The preacher, a tall=20

kindly young man, came in and seemed about to speak; but after a look at he=
r face he stopped.=20

He had come from a church two blocks away. Joe and Amy had never been to hi=
s church, and it=20

was Nourse who had brought him here. Nourse had learned of him from the und=
ertaker.  Several=20

boxes of flowers came.  Later from a milliner's shop two pretty autumn hats=
 arrived.  The guests=20

began arriving--silent, awkward strangers--ten or twelve.  She heard the nu=
rse come in with=20

Susette and take her back to the nursery.  There was no music. Not a sound.=
  At last the silence=20

was broken by the minister's low voice. Thank heaven that was kindly. He wa=
s brief, and yet too=20

long; for from the apartment one flight below, before he had finished, the =
festive throb of a little=20

orchestra was heard.  He prayed just a minute or two.  Then they followed t=
he coffin out into the=20

hall and back and down by the freight elevator.  A motor hearse was waiting=
 below.   When the=20

burial was over, she came home alone with Joe. She sat in the living-room w=
atching his face,=20

while the dusk grew mercifully deep. Then she made him eat some supper and =
take something to=20

make him sleep. And later in her own small room she lay on her bed, disheve=
lled, tearless, her=20

mind stunned, her feelings queer and uneven, now surging up, now cold and s=
till.  "Where has she=20

gone? What do I know? . . . What do I believe? Where is God? . . . What is =
life? What am I here=20

for?"  With a pang she recalled the town in Ohio where she and Amy had been=
 born, and her=20

thoughts went drifting for awhile. Pictures floated in and out, pictures of=
 her life at home. She was=20

hungry for them now, the old stays and firm supports, the old frame house, =
her father and the God=20

in the yellow church, the quiet river, the high school and that friendly gr=
oup of eager girl=20

companions, with work, discussions, young ideals, plans and dreams of life =
and love. . . . All up by=20

the roots in a few swift weeks!  "Shall I go back?" she asked herself. "Do =
I want to go--now that=20

Dad is dead, and most of the girls have gone away, scattered all over the c=
ountry?" Again she=20

lapsed. "I'm too dull to think." She let the pictures drift again. Church s=
ociables, a Christmas tree,=20

dances, suppers and buggy rides, picnics by the river. How small and very f=
ar-away and trivial=20

they now appeared. All had pointed toward New York. "Go back and marry, set=
tle down? Do I=20



want to? No. And anyhow, there's Joe and Susette. My place is right here--a=
nd I'm going to stay.=20

But what is it going to mean to me? What do I want in this city now?"  In t=
he turmoil, startled, she=20

looked about her for a purpose, some ideal. But the old beliefs seemed dim;=
 the new ones, garish=20

and confused. She recalled those faces of Amy's friends. "Yes, cheap and to=
ugh, for all their=20

clothes!" Or was it just this ghastly time that had made them all appear so=
?  Again she thought of=20

her sister dead. "Oh Amy--Amy! Where have you gone?" And at last, quite sud=
denly, the tears=20

came, and she huddled and shook on her bed.    CHAPTER V  She slept that ni=
ght exhausted,=20

woke up early the next morning and lay motionless on her bed: at first star=
ing bewildered about=20

the room, and then, with a sharp contraction of her brows and a quick breat=
h, looking intently up at=20

the ceiling. A vigilant look crept into her eyes, for at once instinctively=
 she was on guard against=20

letting the feelings of yesterday rise.  "What a selfish little beast I've =
been. Did I help in the=20

funeral? Not a bit. Did I comfort poor Joe? Not at all. I was occupied whol=
ly with my own morbid=20

little soul. Now we're going to stiffen up, my love, and try to be of some =
use to Joe, and do as Amy=20

would have liked." She began to tremble suddenly. "No, we're not going to t=
hink of her! It's=20

dangerous! Be practical! To begin with, I must clear things up. I'll have a=
 little talk with Joe. Poor=20

Joe--it's going to be pretty dreadful. I'll stick by him, though, and I've =
got to learn how to keep him=20

from going out of his mind." More staring at the ceiling. "One thing I know=
. I shan't wear black.=20

Amy detested mourning, and Joe will see life black enough as it is. . . . T=
hank Heaven there's the=20

housekeeping to do. That shall run smoothly if it kills me! . . . All right=
, now suppose we get out of=20

bed."  About an hour later, from behind Amy's silver coffee pot, Ethel had =
her talk with Joe. She=20

felt ill, but she bit her lips and smiled. She had dressed her hair becomin=
gly and had donned a=20

blue silk waist, one of the countless pretty things that she had bought wit=
h Amy. Her brown eyes=20

had a resolute brightness.  "We'll have to help each other," she said. "And=
 there's Susette to be=20

thought of. The best way, I guess, is not to try to do much planning ahead =
just now. But I'd like to=20

stay here if you want me, Joe. There's no other place where I want to be." =
 He gave her a grateful=20

tired smile. His hair was a bit dishevelled, and over his blunt kindly face=
 had come a haggard lost=20

expression. His voice was low:  "Thank you, Ethel--you're a brick. I want y=
ou here at first, God=20

knows. Later I'll try to fix things so that you can feel more free. You're =
only a kid, with a life of your=20

own. Big city, you know, and you'll find your place."  He stared over at th=
e window, where the sun=20

was streaming in.  "Another cup of coffee, Joe?"  "No, thanks." he rose slo=
wly, and added, "Let's=20

go now to--Amy's desk--and fix up the housekeeping part of it."  Later he s=
aid, "I'll see the nurse=20

and the other two maids and tell 'em they're to take orders from you." He p=
aused a moment. "And=20

Ethel--if you're to stay here, I want it to be as nearly like it was as I c=
an." he gave a wincing frown.=20

"I mean on the money side," he said. "I'll give you a check the first of ea=
ch month. You'll need=20

things of your own, of course--as she did. I want it just like that."  "Tha=
nk you, dear." She saw a=20

muscle in his cheek suddenly begin to twitch, and she thought, "It won't be=
 easy."  When Joe left=20

for his office, she went with him to the door.   She turned at once to the =
housekeeping. Her talks=20

with the waitress and the cook left her both a little relieved and a good d=
eal disappointed. For=20

there seemed to be nothing for her to do; she was made to feel that things =
would run best with the=20

least possible interference. She learned with surprise that hitherto the co=
ok had done all the=20

ordering.  "All I need to know is how many is coming," said the cook.  "The=
re won't be any one for=20

awhile."  "Then it's very simple, ma'am." On the woman's face was a look wh=
ich said, "Just you=20



keep out of my kitchen."  It was the same in her talk with the nurse. That =
tall gaunt creature briefly=20

explained that, "Mrs. Lanier bought clothes Spring and Fall, and then she l=
eft the child to me. I go=20

out every Thursday and every other Sunday--afternoon and evening. Lucy the =
waitress takes my=20

place. The rest of the time I've managed alone." She looked around in a jea=
lous way and asked, "I=20

suppose you'll want things as before?"  "Yes, for the present," Ethel said.=
 She felt the woman=20

glance at her sharply as she turned toward the door.  She went into her sis=
ter's room, sat down=20

and had a little cry. But the sunlight was streaming in through the pretty =
chintz curtains there; and=20

its softness and its ease, its luxury and blithe content, stole into her sp=
irit and quieted her. She sat=20

looking about.  "What is there for me to do?"  It came over her that the co=
ok and the nurse could=20

tell her just about what they pleased. She had no means of checking them up=
, for Amy had never=20

talked of such things. It had all been pretty clothes and shops, in those b=
rief exciting weeks, and=20

shrewd counsel about men and what it was they wanted of women. How appallin=
gly shallow and=20

meaningless those conversations now appeared. They gave no comfort or suppo=
rt. The=20

remembrance of the terror in Amy's eyes at the thought of death rose vividl=
y in Ethel's mind, and=20

she got up and walked the floor.  "We'll fight this down--we'll fight this =
down," she kept repeating=20

determinedly. And as soon as she was quiet again: "What is there for me to =
do? Why Joe, of=20

course--and heaven knows he'll be enough. He's the hardest kind, he doesn't=
 cry, he keeps it all=20

inside of him." She drew a deep breath. "How about this room?" She frowned =
and looked around=20

her. "No, I don't think he wants anything changed. For the present at least=
, I'll leave it alone. But=20

he ought not to be reminded of her by every little thing he sees."  She loo=
ked into the closets. In=20

Joe's she found some of Amy's things. She put them back in her sister's clo=
set and then gently=20

closed the door. As she stood there a moment longer, she had a curious feel=
ing of Amy's=20

presence by her side.  "Now, my dear, we'd better go out for a walk," she t=
old herself as she=20

turned away. But she threw a glance behind her.  In the weeks that followed=
 she and Joe were=20

more intensely alone together than she could have imagined.  At first a few=
 of Amy's friends kept=20

dropping in every now and then. But although their intentions were kindly e=
nough, Ethel felt=20

repelled by them. She resented their having been Amy's friends. For swiftly=
 and quite=20

unconsciously, in her resolute groping in the dark for solid ground on whic=
h to stand, she was=20

building up an ideal of her sister--and these women jarred on that. They ca=
me to her direct from a=20

world, her sister's world, which she now vaguely felt to be cheap, shallow,=
 disillusioning. And she=20

needed her illusions. By nature frank to bluntness, she was not good at hid=
ing dislikes; and her=20

uneasy visitors soon realized with relief that they were not wanted here.  =
Fanny Carr still came for=20

a time. For some reason that Ethel could not understand, this shrewd person=
 seemed reluctant to=20

let go her hold as a friend. She was most solicitous about Joe and tried to=
 come when he was at=20

home. But as Ethel's dislike of the woman deepened in intensity, gradually =
Fanny's visits, too,=20

grew less frequent and then ceased.  During the first week or two, Joe's pa=
rtner almost every night=20

came home with him to dinner and took him out for evening walks. But his ta=
lk was all of business.=20

It seemed to Ethel that purposely Nourse shut her out of the conversation. =
His manner to her,=20

though not unkind, was like that of the cook and the nurse. "The less you m=
eddle here," it said,=20

"the better it will be for Joe. Leave him to me."  Gleams of this feeling c=
ame in his eyes. It showed=20

now and then so openly that even Joe took notice. He stopped bringing his p=
artner home, and he=20

drew closer to Ethel now, as together they cherished the memory of the woma=
n who was gone.=20



And slowly, in this companionship, this loneliness, this quiet, Joe grew ve=
ry real to her, and=20

appealing in his grief. Everything else seemed so remote--but he was close.=
 "He needs me." It=20

was a bright spot in the dark. At times this darkness had no end, it stretc=
hed away to eternity; but=20

at least she did not face it alone. Of Joe's grief she could have no doubt.=
 Each week his blunt=20

strong features displayed more lines of suffering; his high cheek-bones sho=
wed hard and grim. He=20

was grateful, affectionate at times, but more often silent, and she saw in =
his eyes what frightened=20

her. He had so few resources here. In his office was his work, just as it h=
ad always been; but at=20

home there was nothing; his wife was gone, and he seemed restless to get ou=
t.  "Let's go=20

somewhere," he would mutter.  She went with him for strolls in the evenings=
. Often they walked on=20

and on till both were ready to drop with fatigue, but she stuck doggedly by=
 his side. One evening=20

they passed the open door of a church. It was lighted, and the deep low rum=
ble of board of health,=20

 mentioned in the=20

QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94By the Act of 1892, c. 296, s. 1, 39, it is provided=
 that every person not now=20

practising medicine and surgery, who shall hereafter begin to practise medi=
cine and surgery in any=20

of its departments, shall possess the qualifications required by the act.  =
There are two boards of=20

examiners, representing the medical and chirurgical faculty of the State an=

Hom=C5=93opathic Medical Society respectively; each consists of seven membe=
rs, appointed=20

e of medicine, and of=20

recognized ability and honor; but no physician having a pecuniary interest =
in the trade of pharmacy=20

can be appointed (_ib._, s. 2).  Suitable provisions must be made by each e=

of medicine, materia medica and therapeutics, obstetrics, gyn=C3=A6cology, =

some foreign country, and has also both studied medicine three years and at=
tended three courses=20

of lectures in different years in some legally incorporated medical college=
 or colleges prior to the=20

granting of the diploma or foreign license; two courses of medical lectures=
 both begun or=20

completed within the same calendar year do not satisfy the requirement; thi=
s condition is not=20

 of the board, if=20

satisfied, must direct the secretary to issue an order for examination, and=
 when the applicant shall=20

have passed an examination as to proficiency satisfactory to the board, the=
 president must grant a=20

nt receiving a majority=20

of the votes of the board is considered to have passed a satisfactory exami=
nation and is entitled to=20

a license (_ib._, s. 1, 44).  The board must refuse a license to an applica=

_
moment irresolute, and then started to go inside. But a glance through the =
door revealed to him=20

that the church was nearly empty; and he turned away as he would have turne=
d from any show on=20

Broadway which was so obviously "not a hit."  "Sometimes on Sunday mornings=
 I seem to hear=20

'em, preachers, droning and shouting all over the land," he told her once. =
"What's in it? What do=20

they know about God or where you go when you are dead? Nothing, no more tha=
n you or I!"  His=20

voice was harsh and bitter then, but the next instant it was kind. With his=
 arm about her he was=20

saying:  "Don't, Ethel--please--don't take it like that! I was a brute! I w=
on't again! I'll keep it inside!=20

I'm sorry, dear!"  "Oh, Joe," she whispered, "if we only knew!"  So these t=
wo faced eternity.  But=20

only at moments. They looked away. For she saw how good it was for Joe to h=
ave the distractions=20

that he craved; and so on their long walks at night she took him to the noi=
sy streets, or into the=20

movies, where his mind appeared to stop and find some rest. Best of all, sh=
e discovered, was to=20

go with him in the small car which he used for his business. Driving this c=
ar through crowded=20

streets amid a clamour and blare of horns and shouts and peals of laughter,=
 the look on Joe's face=20

made Ethel see how this dulled his grief, how he lost himself and his quest=
ionings and became a=20

mere part of the town. What a glamourous seething town! There was something=
 terrific to her in its=20

laugh. If you stopped to think and ask yourself, "What are we all doing her=
e?" how soon it jostled=20

you back into line!  So passed another fortnight. Then Joe grew quieter, an=
d with relief she saw he=20

was ready to stay home. She herself felt tired and relaxed; and it was good=
 to sit at home on these=20

December evenings and feel that both had partly emerged from the sea of dou=
bts in which they=20

had been plunged. He had come out of it, she soon learned, with an image of=
 his wife that even=20

Ethel vaguely felt was swiftly becoming so ideal as to have little or no re=
semblance to the woman=20

who had died. But eagerly she helped him in this building of Amy's memory. =
She dwelt upon=20

Amy's appealing side, her lovable moods, her beauty and dash, her unerring =
instinct for pretty=20

things, her unselfishness, her anxious planning for Ethel's good.  And all =
this fitted in so well with=20

the picture Joe was making of the wife who had been so true to him, who had=
 never had a thought=20

or a wish for anything but his career. How cheerfully she had given up all =
sorts of pleasures, trips=20

abroad, a house in the country, summer vacations. Year after year she had s=
pent the hot months=20

almost wholly in town because he could not afford to leave, although she he=
rself had had many=20

chances to go to friends in the mountains or up along the seashore. Instead=
 she had stayed with=20

him in town; and in the evenings always she had been waiting, good-humoured=
 and gay, ready to=20

stay home or go out; with never a word of complaint for the delay of his pr=
osperity, but only=20

encouragement and praise.  At times, as Joe talked on and on, in this mood =
of hungry wistful love=20

and humility and self-reproach, Ethel would bring herself back with a jerk =
to the Amy she had=20

known; but again she would feel herself borne along upon the tide of his be=
lief, and she was glad=20

that it was so. So the picture grew. Nor was it only when they talked. For =
often in long silences,=20

when she thought he was reading his paper, she would glance up from her boo=
k and find him=20

staring into the past. And again at the piano, smoking and playing idly, hi=
s music made her realize=20

how his mind was groping back through the years, picking and choosing here =
and there what he=20

needed to build up his ideal.  This music at times made her curious, wonder=
ing what kind of a man=20

he had been before Amy took him in hand.  "Where did you learn to play like=
 that, Joe?" He=20

frowned a little.  "Oh, long ago."  He did not seem to care to go back of h=
is marriage. So Ethel let=20

him continue his building; and though at times she smiled a little at some =
of his fond recollections,=20



still her own deep adoration of her older sister, the whirl of happy memori=
es of that vivid month in=20

town, and the sense of all that Amy had been planning to do for her, combin=
ed now with her=20

desperate loneliness to put Ethel in a mood where she gladly and loyally be=
lieved almost anything=20

good of her sister.  Christmas was only one example of many similar inciden=
ts. They had a small=20

Christmas tree for Susette, and they hung up her stocking as well, and went=
 out Christmas Eve=20

and bought candy canes and dogs and dolls and picture books. And although t=
his was Ethel's=20

idea, it was made to appear as only the thing which Amy would have done had=
 she lived.  So in=20

these two hungry souls, groping for something bright and deep and strong up=
on which they could=20

live, swiftly and unawares to them both the picture of Amy was stamped deep=
, idealized and=20

beautified. In life it had been fascinating, but now it was almost heroic a=
s well. It was as though the=20

small gloved hand, which Ethel had noticed so many times, in death had incr=
eased the power of=20

its light, firm, tenacious hold.   Ethel began to feel more free, for Joe w=
as no longer on her mind.=20

More than once, in fact, she was surprised at the way he seemed to be settl=
ing down. She felt a=20

deeper change in him, something she did not understand. The worn harassed e=
xpression she had=20

so often seen on his face while his wife had been alive, the look of a man =
driven and drained of his=20

vitality, was now gone; and in its place was an unconscious look of content=
. He often stayed very=20

late at the office; and more and more in his evenings at home he went to hi=
s desk and became=20

absorbed in documents and blue print plans.  "What a refuge a man's busines=
s is," she thought=20

with a twinge of envy.  And wistfully she began to look about for some reso=
urce for herself. She=20

felt the youth within her rise, but the city seemed so vast and strange. In=
 her loneliness the big=20

building of which her present home was a part, seemed doubly huge, imperson=
al, hard; and so did=20

every other building on that block appear. She felt lost, left out amid cea=
seless tides of gaiety on=20

every hand. She took long determined walks, and on these walks she donned t=
he smart attractive=20

clothes that she had bought with Amy. She strove to keep her mind on the si=
ghts, the faces of=20

people afoot and in cars, the adorable things in shop windows. And she chat=
ted busily to herself in=20

order to keep on admiring. This old habit of hers, of soliloquy, had grown =
upon her unawares, as a=20

refuge from her loneliness. Sometimes she even talked aloud. Sturdily she t=
old herself:  "You've=20

only begun. You'll get up out of this, Ethel Knight--just wait. Can't you g=
ive a few months to Amy=20

now?"  And scowling at her "morbidness" in feeling dreary and forlorn, she =
resolutely scanned the=20

papers for news of lectures, plays and concerts. She went to a few in the a=
fternoons, and dressed=20

for them as carefully as though they were great social affairs. And in the =
intermissions when a=20

buzz of talk would rise, she would begin with quick animation to converse w=
ith herself and be gay,=20

or alert and argumentative. Her lips would move inaudibly. Now and then she=
 would brightly smile=20

and nod across the house at some friend she pretended to have seen. She enr=
olled for a course=20

of lectures upon "Mental Science." She resumed her reading of magazines and=
 books on all kinds=20

of topics. It made her think of high school days, and hungrily she reached =
back for that old. zest=20

and inquisitiveness about everything under the moon and stars.  And through=
 this searching she=20

caught hints of the presence in the city of a life wider and deeper than sh=
ops and yet not=20

antagonistic--a life of gaiety, grace and ease, but with it all the brillia=
ncy to which Amy had been=20

blind; the rich ferment of new ideas in women's lives, discussions, work of=
 many kinds, art, music,=20

"movements" all combined into one thrilling pulsing whole. And again she fe=
lt within herself that=20

rising tide of youth and eager vitality.  "Oh, what couldn't I do, my dear,=
 if I only had a chance?=20



Why doesn't somebody see it at once--notice me now, right here on the stree=
t? You, madam, in=20

that limousine--look out and see me--don't go by! You're losing the chance =
of a lifetime! You're=20

missing me--me--Ethel Knight!"  As the dame in her car sped smoothly by, Et=
hel suddenly laughed=20

aloud. But her laughter had a dangerous note, and she added fiercely, bitin=
g her lip:  "Now, don't=20

be silly and burst into tears!"  "Ma'am?" said a voice.  She stopped with a=
 jerk and looked up into=20

the startled eyes of a massive young policeman. Her last remark had been sp=
oken directly up into=20

his face, and the youth was blushing visibly.  "Oh!" she gasped. "Excuse me=
!"  "Certainly, ma'am."=20

And she hurried on.  This loneliness lasted several weeks. Then Joe grew di=
mly aware of it, and=20

came to her assistance with awkward efforts to comfort her. He was at home =
more often at night.=20

His gruff voice took on a kindlier tone, and in an offhand manner intended =
to seem casual he=20

would ask where she had been that day or what book she was reading. And the=
y would discuss it=20

for a while. He took her to the theatre and to a concert now and then. They=
 went for rides at night=20

in his car, and he talked to her about his work. She could feel his anxious=
 friendliness. "What a=20

dear he is to me," she thought.  As time went on this companionship grew so=
 natural to them both=20

that more than once Ethel felt in herself a content which made her a little=
 uneasy. As in his blunt=20

kindly way Joe drew closer to her now, she had an awkward consciousness of =
being in her sister's=20

place. No, not that exactly. Still, she did not care to think of it. She ke=
pt out of Amy's room. It had=20

subtly changed and become Joe's room--to her mind at least--though by littl=
e things he said and=20

did she knew that Joe was keeping that idealized image of his wife still wa=
rm and living in his=20

mind.  But was he--altogether? At times she would frown to herself a bit. J=
oe loyal? Yes, of course=20

he was, she would indignantly declare. In a novel Ethel had once read, the =
hero who had lost his=20

wife had taken his grief in this same silent way; and the author had laid i=
t down as a law that all=20

quiet widowers are the kind who never, never marry again. This thought had =
taken root in her=20

mind; and she applied it now to Joe.  Soon at his suggestion she began to u=
se some of Amy's=20

things. One night when they were going out, he helped her slip into her sis=
ter's soft luxurious sable=20

cloak. And as she turned, she detected a queerly uncertain look in Joe's ey=
es. But in an instant it=20

was gone, and she soon dismissed her uneasiness. For through the weeks that=
 followed he=20

became engrossed in his business and barely noticed her at all.    CHAPTER =
VI  About this time a=20

letter from home brought her a sharp disappointment. Ethel was not a good c=
orrespondent, but=20

during the homesick winter months she had written several times to three of=
 the girls she had=20

known in school. Two had gone west, but the other one was still in Ohio and=
 was planning to come=20

to New York, to take a course of training as nurse in one of the hospitals.=
 In fact it had been all=20

arranged. And Ethel had not realized how much she had counted on this frien=
d, until now a letter=20

came announcing her engagement to a young doctor in Detroit. She was going =
there to live, and=20

her letter was full of her happiness. Ethel was very blue that night.  But =
only a few days after this=20

she received another missive that had quite a different effect. It was a lo=
ng bulky epistle, a "round=20

robin" from the members of the little high school club to which she had bel=
onged at home. The=20

girls had scattered far and wide. One was teaching music in an Oklahoma tow=
n; another had gone=20

to Cleveland and was a stenographer in a broker's office there; a third was=
 in Chicago, the wife of=20

a young lawyer; and a fourth had married an engineer who was working a mine=
 in Montana. It=20

made an absorbing narrative, and she read it several times. At first it too=
k her out of herself, far,=20

far out all over the land. How good it was to get news of them all, how nic=
e and gossipy and gay. It=20



was almost as though they were here in the room; she seemed to be talking w=
ith each one; and as=20

they chatted on and on, the feeling grew in Ethel that each was starting li=
ke herself and that some=20

were having no easy time in unfamiliar places. She could read between the l=
ines.  But the part that=20

struck her most was the contribution of their former history "prof," a litt=
le lame woman with snappy=20

black eyes, who had been the leading spirit in their long discussions. She =
was an ardent suffragist,=20

and she it was who had brought so many modern books and plays and "movement=
s" into their=20

talk. Chained to her job in the small town, she had followed voraciously al=
l the news of the=20

seething changing world outside, of the yeast at work in the cities. And to=
 the letters of some of the=20

girls who seemed bent upon nothing but social success, the little teacher n=
ow replied by an appeal=20

to all of them:  "Girls, some of these letters worry me. I don't want to pr=
each--you will lead your=20

own lives. But I cannot help reminding you of the things we talked about--t=
he splendid things,=20

exciting things that are stirring in this land today. Oh, what a chance for=
 women--what openings=20

with narrow doors--what fights to make the doorways wide for the girls who =
will come after you!=20

Keep yourselves strong and awake and alive--keep growing--remember that lif=
e is a school and for=20

you it has only just begun. Don't sit at your desks--in your homes, I mean-=
-blinking with a man at=20

your side. Keep yourselves free--don't marry for money--don't let yourselve=
s get under the thumb=20

of any husband, rich or poor, or of social position or money or clothes or =
any such silly trumpery.=20

Get the real things! Oh, I'm preaching, I know, as I did in spite of myself=
 at home. But girls--dear=20

friends and comrades--be strong--and don't give up the ship!"  Ethel read i=
t many times. She could=20

hear the voice of the little "prof," now earnest, scornful, pleading, now o=
bstinate and angry, again=20

light-hearted, mocking. She recalled how their leader had warned them again=
st the bribery of men.=20

Most of the girls had smiled at her then, for they had felt themselves so s=
trong and clear in their=20

aims and desires.  "Oh, Ethel--Ethel--Ethel Knight. How have the mighty fal=
len. One week in New=20

York and your eyes were glued to the windows of shops. You got ready to dan=
ce and find a man."=20

The thought rose in her mind--"That was Amy's idea." But she dismissed it w=
ith a frown. She=20

turned back to the letters and read them all through over again. She rose a=
nd walked slowly up=20

and down with her hands locked behind her. Then she went to her desk, and t=
o the round robin=20

she added this:  "I am in New York and have nothing to say. I have been a f=
ool. I have spent=20

nearly all my money on a lot of silly clothes. No, not silly--fetching clot=
hes--for they were meant to=20

fetch a man. But in getting them I got nothing else. I and hygiene, and if =
the applicant is found by=20

the board to possess sufficient learning in those branches, and of good mor=
al character, the board=20

issues a license to practise medicine, signed by each member who approves (=
_ib._, s. 3,244).=20

The application must state the applicant=E2=80=99s full name, place of resi=
dence, and post-office address,=20

nativity and age, time spent in medical studies, name and post-office addre=
ss of the preceptor=20

under whom his medical studies were pursued, the courses of medical lecture=
s attended, the=20

name of medical schools attended; if a graduate of a medical college, the n=
ame thereof; the time=20

spent in a hospital, the time spent in the practice of medicine, if any, th=
e school or system of=20

practice chosen, and references as to his personal character (_ib._, s. 3,2=
45).  Examinations are=20

to be conducted at the capital on the first Tuesday in April and October an=
nually, and continue=20

until all applicants are examined and the examinations are approved or disa=
pproved; they are=20

upon written questions and answers, and no distinction can be made between =
applicants because=20

of different systems or schools of practice.  The license must be filed in =
the office of the clerk of=20



the circuit court of the county in which the licensee resides, within sixty=
 days from the date of its=20

issue; otherwise it becomes void. The clerk must record the same with his c=
ertificate of filing and=20

deliver the original to the licensee. When the licensee changes the county =
of his residence and=20

usual practice, he must file the original or a certified copy of license, o=
r record, in the office of said=20

clerk in the county into which he shall move and practise within sixty days=
 of the time of his=20

removal, to be there recorded (_ib._, s. 3,249).  The board may issue a dup=
licate in place of a lost=20

license (_ib._, s. 3,250).  The secretary of the board may issue a temporar=
y license which shall be=20

valid until the next succeeding meeting of board, such license to show its =
date of issue, otherwise=20

to be void; it must be recorded as a permanent license is required to be; o=
nly one temporary=20

license shall ever be issued to the same person, and it shall always be mad=
e to an individual and=20

not to a partnership (_ib._, s. 3,251).  Physicians practising by virtue of=
 a license under prior laws=20

are not required to obtain a license under this law and may continue in pra=
ctice under their=20

licenses, but they must comply with the requirements of this law with refer=
ence to recording (_ib._,=20

s. 3,252).  PENALTY.=E2=80=94To practise without an examination and a licen=
se is punishable with a fine=20

of from $20 to $200, or to imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed th=
irty days (_ib._, s. 1,258).=20

EXCEPTIONS.=E2=80=94Females engaged in the practice of midwifery need no li=

esiding without the=20

State, and whose practice extends into it, may obtain a license without exa=
mination by presenting=20

an application in the form prescribed; whereupon the secretary of the board=
 must issue a license=20

in the name of the board and the license must be recorded as hereinbefore p=

MISSOURI.  QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94Every person practising medicine and surg=
ery, in any of their=20

departments, must possess the qualifications required. If a graduate of med=
icine, he must present=20

his diploma to the State board of health for verification as to its genuine=
ness. If the diploma is=20

found to be genuine, and the person named therein to be the person claiming=
 and presenting the=20

same, the board must issue a certificate which is conclusive of the right t=
o practise. If not a=20

graduate, he must submit to such examination as the board shall require, an=
d if the examination is=20

satisfactory to the examiners the board must issue its certificate in accor=
dance with the facts, and=20

the holder shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges herein mentio=
ned (Rev. Stats., 1889, s.=20

6,871).  The board must issue certificates to all who furnish satisfactory =
proof of having received a=20

diploma or license from a legally chartered medical institution in good sta=
nding, of whatever school=20

or system of medicine, and shall not make any discrimination against the ho=
lders of genuine=20

licenses or diplomas under any school or system of medicine (_ib._, s. 6,87=
2).  The verification of=20

a diploma consists in the affidavit of the holder and applicant that he is =
the lawful possessor of the=20

same, and the person therein named; the affidavit may be taken before any p=
erson authorized to=20

administer oaths, and shall be attested under the hand and official seal of=
 such officer, if he have a=20

seal. Graduates may present their diplomas and affidavits by letter or prox=
y (_ib._, s. 6,873).  All=20

examinations are made directly by the board, and the certificates authorize=
 the possessor to=20

practise medicine and surgery in the State (_ib._, s. 6,874).  The certific=
ate must be recorded in=20



the office of the county clerk of the county in which the holder resides an=
d the record must be=20

indorsed thereon; a person moving to another county to practise must procur=
e an indorsement to=20

that effect on the certificate from the said clerk, and have the certificat=
e recorded in the office of=20

the clerk of the county to which he removes (_Ib._, s. 6,875).  Examination=
s may be made wholly=20

or partly in writing and must be of an elementary and practical character, =
but sufficiently strict to=20

test the qualifications of the candidate as a practitioner (_Ib._, s. 6,877=
).  The board may refuse a=20

certificate to an individual guilty of unprofessional or dishonorable condu=
ct, and may revoke a=20

certificate for like causes after giving the accused an opportunity to be h=
eard (_Ib._, s. 6,878).=20

QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94It is unlawful for any person to practise medicine, =
surgery, or obstetrics, or any=20

of their branches, without having obtained and registered a certificate. No=
 person is entitled to a=20



certificate unless he be a graduate of a legally chartered medical school o=
r college in good=20

standing. The qualifications are determined by the State board of health. T=
he act does not prevent=20

physicians residing in other States from visiting patients in consultation =
with resident physicians=20

who have complied. (Act of 1891, c. 35, s. 7).  A medical school is defined=
 as a medical school or=20

college which requires a previous examination for admission to its courses =
of study, and which=20

requires for granting the degree of =E2=80=9CM.D.=E2=80=9D attendance on at=
 least three courses of lectures of six=20

months each, no two of said courses to be held within one year, and having =

professors in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, toxicology, pathology, hygien=
e, materia medica,=20

medicine, surgery, or=20

obstetrics must present his diploma to the said board, with his affidavit t=
hat he is the lawful=20

possessor of the same and has attended the full course of study required fo=

 any person=20

authorized to administer oaths, and it shall be attested under the hand and=
 official seal of the=20

official, if he have a seal. False swearing is perjury (_ib._, s. 9).  If i=

My sister Amy suddenly died. I am here now to care for her child. But am I?=
 Nothing of the kind.=20

The nurse does that and I do nothing. I just sit or walk about and scowl at=
 what I am missing. No=20

more from me, girls, until the round robin--the dear splendid thrilling rou=

on its next yearly round. I swear I'll have a job by then! Good luck and Go=
d bless us all! We're=20

young!"  Quickly she crammed all the letters into a large envelope, licked =
it, pressed it firmly down,=20

and addressed it to, "Miss Barbara Wells, Bismarck, North Dakota." She stam=
ped it, felt the tears=20

come, kissed the letter a fierce good-bye, took it out and dropped it in th=
e mail box in the hall.=20

Then she came back to her own room, and with swift, determined jerks took o=
ff the black cloth=20

wrapping of a large old-fashioned typewriter, one of the few belongings she=
 had brought from=20

Ohio. She had purchased it several years ago, and by typing sermons and oth=
er occasional=20

documents she had earned almost money enough for the clothes that had cost =
so little at home.=20

She sat down and began to pound the keys, but soon she stopped and shook he=
r head. She had=20

never been an expert. Self-taught, her work had been laboured and slow, and=
 the lapse of months=20

had thrown her out. "However! Something must be done!" And the pounding wen=
t on for days and=20

days, hour after hour; and when her fingers, wrists and arms felt like "two=
 long tooth-aches," she=20

exclaimed impatiently:  "Oh, for goodness sake stop being so soft! You're a=
 new woman, Ethel=20

Knight, and you're going to earn your living!"  At times, however, stopping=
 to rest and carefully=20

scan her labour for faults, her mind would rove far out into life. She was =
copying from two books=20

the little "prof" had given her, the "Life and Letters of George Sand"; and=
 "The Work of Susan B.=20

Anthony." And as Ethel pounded on, each book in its own way revealed exciti=
ng vistas to her eyes=20

of life in great cities both here and abroad, life earnest and inspiring, l=
ife bright and thrilling,=20

brilliant, free!  "Oh, your future life, my love, will be far from dull and=
 blinking!"  And this mood=20

lasted for two weeks. Then as her hand grew more expert, and she scanned th=
e papers for=20

information of employment bureaus, there came some ugly hours when much pou=
nding was=20

required. She went out and tramped the streets, meeting the town with angry=
 eyes that struggled=20

for self-confidence. And twice, although she had dressed herself with a kee=

her own attractiveness and had gone to the bureau or intends to practise (_=
ib._, s. 10).  The act=20

gave physicians entitled to practise at the time of its enactment six month=

icates are granted may=20

have been on file in its office for ten days without a vote of the board, w=
hen no protest has been=20

filed, and if, in their opinion, the proof complies with the act (_ib._, s.=
 12).  When the holder of a=20

certificate removes to another county, he must file and record it in the of=
fice of the county clerk in=20

the county to which he removes (_ib._, s. 13).  The board may refuse certif=
icates to persons guilty=20

of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct, and may revoke for like causes p=
rovided they give the=20

person an opportunity to be heard (_ib._, s. 14).  PENALTY.=E2=80=94No pers=

sum of money for medical, surgical, or obstetrical service unless he shall =

questions, had remarked:  "Why, yes, I think we can place you. I've one pos=

not appeared to care very much that Ethel had only one reference--from the =
old minister back at=20

home; and the brief exhibition of her skill which Ethel gave upon a machine=
, with her fingers=20

excited, cold and tense, had lasted but a minute or two when the woman had =
said, "Yes, that will=20
