pilgrimage to the same high point; to the same mountain-top, where we trust to meet when the 

journey shall be accomplished. That mountain is steep, the country is desert; is there but one path, 

or are there many? Your path and mine are different, but with God's help they will lead us to the 

top. Shall we quarrel over the well upon the thirsty way? or shall we drink together, and be thankful 

for the cool waters, and strive to reach the end? Drink from my water-skin when upon the desert 

we thirst together, scorched by the same sun, exhausted by the same simoom, cooled by the 

same night, until we sleep at the journey's end, and together thank God, Christian and 

Mahometan, that we have reached our home."  The good fakeers rejoiced in such simple 

explanations, and they came to the conclusion that we were "all the same with a little difference," 

thus we were the best of friends with all the people. If not exactly a cure of their Mahometan souls, 

they acknowledged that I held the key to their bowels, which were entirely dependent upon my will, 

when the crowd of applicants daily thronged my medicine chest, and I dispensed jalap, calomel, 

opium, and tartar emetic. Upon one occasion a woman brought me a child of  And lastly, the 

national aspect may be stated very briefly. If England is not to lose her place in the world her 

population must be maintained. Unless fathers and mothers produce an average of over three 

children that population will not be maintained.  If you say to a young husband and wife with their 

one or two children, "Do you like to contemplate that when you both leave life your country will, 

through your action, be worse off than when you entered life?" that is an appeal to patriotism, and 

likely to be a successful appeal.  There are signs of a public opinion forming which will condemn 

the selfishness of marriages without their proper heritage of children, but such public opinion will 

not be strengthened by an indiscriminate condemnation of birth control.  May I end my speech with 

an appeal that the Church approaches this question, in common with certain others, in the light of 

modern knowledge and the needs of a new world, and unhampered by traditions which have 

outworn their usefulness?                          PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY           THE

dry and hard, which in that climate it will do in about an hour. There was one complaint that I was 

obliged to leave entirely in the hands of the Arabs, this was called "frendeet;" it was almost the 

certain effect of drinking the water that in the rainy season is accumulated in pools upon the 

surface of the rich table lands, especially between the Atbara and Katariff; the latter is a market-

town about sixty miles from Wat el Negur, on the west bank of the river. Frendeet commences with 

a swelling of one of the limbs, generally accompanied with intense pain; this is caused by a worm
