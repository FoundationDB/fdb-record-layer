proofs that this is after all not a king's war, but a people's war, is foun=
d in the kind of stories they=20

were forever telling Henry and me about the war. They are not hero stories.=
 Mostly they are funny=20

stories, more or less gently guying the "pomp and circumstance of glorious =
war," for it is the proud=20

boast of the British army that this is a noncoms' war. Doubtless the storie=
s have small basis in=20

fact, but the currency of these blithe stories reflects the popular mind. T=

General Haig and his staff came down to review the the Ottomacs subsist on =
fish and turtles. The=20

former they kill with surprising dexterity, by shooting them with an arrow =

* (* In South America, as=20

in Egypt and Nubia, the swelling of the rivers, which occurs periodically i=
n every part of the torrid=20

zone, is erroneously attributed to the melting of the snows.) It is then ve=
ry difficult to procure fish,=20

which often fails the poor missionaries, on fast-days as well as flesh-days=
, though all the young=20

Indians are under the obligation of fishing for the convent. During the per=
iod of these inundations,=20

which last two or three months, the Ottomacs swallow a prodigious quantity =
of earth.=20

the Canadian General lined his huskies up, and as the staff approached he c=
ried anxiously, "Say,=20

boys--here he comes. Now see if you can't stand to attention, and for Heave=
n's sake, fellows,=20

don't call me Bill while he is here!" And then they say that after the heav=
y hardware and shelf=20

goods were distributed a British officer lifted his voice to say: "Men, you=
 have written a brave page=20

upon our history. No more splendid courage than yours ever has been known i=

proud race. But with such magnificent courage, why can you not display othe=

huts, piled up in pyramids three or four feet high. These balls were five o=

The earth which the Ottomacs eat is a very fine and unctuous clay of a yell=
owish grey colour; and,=20

 which we took from the=20
