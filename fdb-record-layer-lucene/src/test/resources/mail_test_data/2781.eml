cottage, had found himself at first almost overwhelmed by the sense of resp=
onsibility. Mr. Leyton=20

had felt somewhat as a landsman might feel should he be called to take the =
command of a vessel=20

on the very first occasion on which he ever entered one. The curate lacked =
neither talent nor=20

devotion, but he had no experience in the peculiar work of a village pastor=
, and with a tender=20

sensitive disposition and natural shyness, it seemed as if he had undertake=
n a task beyond his=20

strength. The change was great from the easy luxury of home and college lif=
e to the position of a=20

hard-working curate, with long church-services to tax a weak voice, and the=
 various needs of a=20

parish, in which almost every one was to him a stranger, to try his energie=
s and test his discretion.=20

Mr. Leyton had prayerfully resolved to do his very best to be a faithful mi=
nister to his flock, and=20

overcome the difficulties before him. He had, some time before his ordinati=
on, left off some of his=20

favorite pursuits, that he might devote himself to his duties; he had given=
 away his cigar-case, had=20

parted with his books of light literature, locked up his flute, and left hi=
s paint-box untouched for=20

months. Claudius Leyton had resolutely turned his thoughts to sermons and s=
chools, and other=20

matters connected with parish business. But it had been a great trial to th=
e young clergyman to=20

have, as it were, to find his way almost alone in, to him, a new country. H=
e was unable for weeks=20

to avail himself of the experience of the vicar, and but for the informatio=
n and help always=20

cheerfully given him by Ned Franks, the curate would often have felt utterl=
y discouraged by the=20

difficulties attending his charge. It was no small relief to the young man =
to be at last able to consult=20

the vicar, receive his sympathy, and ask his advice; for Claudius had none =
of the proud self-

confidence which too often my hands and clothing stained with his blood, I =
should be arrested.=20

The treaty must not be found on me. Yet I must hide it, save it. I made a d=
ash for the window, and=20

once outside, standing on the narrow balcony, I threw the candle-end into t=
he room, aiming for the=20

fire-place. Faint starlight, sifting through heavy clouds, showed me a row =
of small flower-pots=20

standing in a wooden box. Hastily I wrapped the treaty in a towel which hun=
g over the iron railing,=20

lifted out two of the flower-pots (in which the plants were dead and dry), =
laid the flat parcel I had=20

made in the bottom of the box, and replaced the pots to cover and conceal i=
t. Then I walked back=20

into the room again. A hand, fumbling at the handle of the door, pushed it =
open with a faint=20

creaking of the hinges. Then the light of a dark lantern flashed.     DIANA=
 FORREST'S PART=20

CHAPTER XIV   DIANA TAKES A MIDNIGHT DRIVE  Some people apparently understa=
nd how to=20

be unhappy gracefully, as if it were a kind of fine art. I don't. It seems =
too bad to be true that I=20

should be unhappy, and as if I must wake up to find that it was only a bad =
dream.  I suppose I've=20

been spoiled a good deal all my life. Everybody has been kind to me, and tr=
ied to do things for my=20

pleasure, just as I have for them; and I have taken things for granted--exc=
ept, of course, with Lisa.=20

But Lisa is different--different from everyone else in the world. I have ne=
ver expected anything=20

from her, as I have from others. All I've wanted was to make her as happy a=
s such a poor, little,=20

piteous creature could be, and to teach myself never to mind anything that =
she might say or do.=20

But Ivor--to be disappointed in him, to be made miserable by him! I didn't =
know it was possible to=20

suffer as I suffered that day he went off and left me standing in the railw=
ay-station. I didn't dream=20

then of going to Paris. If anybody had told me I=20
