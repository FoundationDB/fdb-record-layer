mass after cooling, but rather by the molten lava=E2=80=99s having drained =

provinces of America, in order that their value might, in their circulation=
 in Manila, be properly=20

adjusted to the Spanish peso; consequently, the recoinage of American money=
 was stopped. A=20

later edict ordered that from June 1, 1837, "the coin called cuarto should =
circulate at the rate of=20

twenty to the real, [27] instead of seventeen as hitherto, on account of th=
e greater size and weight=20

of the new coins; and to this new subdivision were adjusted the prices of t=

established therefor, and the revenues from wine. Also the circulation of c=
igars [tabacos] in place=20

of money was forbidden; the Indians had introduced this on account of the s=
carcity of copper coin,=20

and because the greater part of that then current was counterfeit, on which=
 account a multitude of=20

disputes had arisen. The governor decided, moreover, that the Spanish peset=
a should be=20

accepted at thirty-two cuartos, five [pesetas], therefore, corresponding to=
 the peso fuerte." A royal=20

order of May 31, 1837, declared certain jurisdictions--Caraga, Samar, Iloil=

Camarines Sur, and Tayabas--to be those of governors, at once military and =
political, who should=20

assage with a pretty=20

uniform width of fifteen to twenty feet, and of about equal height, we paus=

formation of the cavern. The dim light of our lamps illuminated the pilaste=
red walls, and a roof=20

raftered and groined with straight and curved beams of crystalline structur=

Some of these were of a reddish appearance, and others had a vitreous lustr=

reflections of crystals of sulphur, which, like marigold or sunflower, glea=
