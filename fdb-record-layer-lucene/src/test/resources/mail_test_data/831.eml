philodendron monstera union of the soldier and the poet gives the life a pe=
culiar charm, and is very strikingly brought out in that chapter of the boo=
k of Samuel (2 Sam. xxiii.) which begins, "These be the last words of David=
," and after giving the swan-song of him whom public morality of their own =
side so soon as it shall come into office.  Of course I was not thinking of=
 all this as I entered the drawing-room, but I had thought it often before,=
 and feel impelled to mention it now. What I actually did was to philodendr=
on monstera union of the soldier and the poet gives the life a peculiar cha=
rm, and is very strikingly brought out in that chapter of the book of Samue=
l (2 Sam. xxiii.) which begins, "These be the last words of David," and aft=
er giving the swan-song of him whom public morality of their own side so so=

as I entered the drawing-room, but I had thought it often before, and feel =
impelled to mention it now. What I actually did was to _
away; and his later years are shaded with the saddening consciousness of hi=
s great fault, as well=20

as by hatred and rebellion and murder in his family, and discontent and ali=
enation in his kingdom.=20

None of the great men of Scripture pass through a course of so many changes=
; none of them=20

touched human life at so many points; none of them were so tempered and pol=
ished by swift=20

alternation of heat and cold, by such heavy blows and the friction of such =
rapid revolutions. Like=20

his great Son and Lord, though in a lower sense, he, too, must be "in all p=
oints tempted like as we=20

are," that his words may be fitted for the solace and strength of the whole=
 world. Poets "learn in=20

suffering what they teach in song." These quick transitions of fortune, and=
 this wide experience,=20

are the many-coloured threads from which the rich web of his psalms is wove=
n.  And while the life=20

is singularly varied, does the defence. Men who have got place do not pay m=
uch attention to=20

attacks from men who want it. Then, as I said before, the Church utterly ig=
nores its duties in this=20

respect. Who ever heard of a bishop getting up and pointing out to her Maje=
sty's Ministers the=20

necessity of considering the interests of the country before their own? It =
would be immediately=20

supposed that he was bullying them, because he wanted to be "translated;" a=
nd this would be=20

considered the only excuse for the same want of "good taste" which I, who a=
m only desirous for=20

their good, am now displaying. I put it to you, my lords, in all humility, =
do you ever get up in your=20

places, not in the House of Peers, but in another House, and point out to t=
he rulers of the country=20

that no personal consideration should ever interfere with their doing the r=
ight thing at the right=20

moment? Do you ever explain to the noble=20


_
singularly full and versatile. In this respect, too, he is most unlike the =
other leading figures of Old=20

Testament history. Contrast him, for example, with the stern majesty of Mos=
es, austere and simple=20

as the tables of stone; or with the unvarying tone in the gaunt strength of=
 Elijah. These and the=20

other mighty men in Israel are like the ruder instruments of music--the tru=
mpet of Sinai, with its=20

one prolonged note. David is like his own harp of many chords, through whic=
h the breath of God=20

murmured, drawing forth wailing and rejoicing, the clear ring of triumphant=
 trust, the low plaint of=20

penitence, the blended harmonies of all devout emotions.  The man had his f=
aults--grave enough.=20

Let it be remembered that no one has judged them more rigorously than himse=
lf. The critics who=20

have delighted to point at them have been anticipated by the penitent; and =
their indictment has=20

been little more than the quotation of his own confession. His tremulously =
susceptible nature,=20

especially assailable by the delights of sense, led him astray. There are t=
races in his life of=20

occasional craft and untruthfulness which even the exigencies of exile and =
war do not wholly=20

palliate. Flashes of fierce vengeance at times break from the clear sky of =
his generous nature. His=20

strong affection became, in at least one case, weak and foolish sit, that w=
hen a committee is=20

chosen from both sides of the House to inquire into a simple question of ri=
ght or wrong, the=20

members of it are bound to vote upon its merits and according to their cons=
ciences, rather than=20

according to the political parties to which they belong? and do you ever as=
k yourselves what you=20

would do in the same circumstances? Do you ever tell the heads of departmen=
ts that they are=20

responsible for the _morale_ which pervades the special services over which=
 they preside? that=20

the tone of honour, the amount of zeal and of disinterestedness which subor=
dinates display must=20

depend in a great measure upon the example set them by their chief? that yo=
u can no more=20

expect an orchestra to play in tune with a leader devoid of a soul for musi=
c, than a department to=20

work well without the soul of honour at its head? Do you ever tell the lead=
ers of the party with=20

which you "act" that it is wicked openly to collect funds to give candidate=
s to bribe with at general=20

elections? Do you ever faithfully tell these great men, that just in propor=
tion as their position is=20

elevated, so is their power for good or for evil? and when you see their re=
sponsibilities sit lightly=20

upon them, do you ever take them to task for trifling with the highest inte=
rests of the country, and=20

stifling the consciences of its servants?=20


_
son.  But when all this is admitted, there remains a wonderfully rich, lova=
ble character. He is the=20

very ideal of a minstrel hero, such as the legends of the East especially l=
ove to paint. The=20

shepherd's staff or sling, the sword, the sceptre, and the lyre are equally=
 If the fact that in your=20

ecclesiastical capacity you are beholden to one or other of the political p=
arties makes it delicate for=20

you to attack your opponents, then let the Liberal Episcopacy jealously gua=
rd the honour of the=20

Liberal Cabinets, and the Tory bishops watch=20
