One thing he could expect was speed. They were after him and climbing like =
the wind. They were=20

nearly upon his tail before he knew it.  Banking sharply to the left, he we=
nt into a terrific dive. As he=20

flashed past them they fired from some swinging gun, and missed.  "I'll mak=
e the island before=20

they get me or crash," he swore to himself. Then he saw a cloud. It was jus=
t ahead of him, not=20

large, but at least a haven. He darted into it, and for the moment was safe=
.  But the enemy was=20

persistent. The freak began crisscrossing the cloud. Circle as he might, Te=
d could not quite=20

escape contact. There came the _rat-tat-tat_ of machine-gun fire.  "Shootin=
g at my shadow," Ted=20

guessed. "That's a game two can play." Ten seconds later, catching a dark s=
treak passing through=20

the misty cloud, he released a burst of fire. The shriek of the enemy plane=
 changed instantly. Had=20

he registered a hit? He dared hope so.  But the fight was not over. The wil=
d terror still circled, its=20

shriek becoming sharper and more piercing each instant.  "There never was s=
uch a plane as that,"=20

Ted mused desperately. "It's supernatural, an inhuman thing, the work of no=
 man, but of the devil=20

himself. I'll dive and keep right on going, level off at last, and land on =
the sea. It's my only chance."=20

Going into a steep dive, he found himself almost at once in bright, tropica=
l sunlight. The change=20

was startling. Like going to a party with no clothes on, he thought.  He we=
nt straight on down, and=20

the shrieker followed him.  For ten desperate seconds he skimmed over the s=
ea. Then he hit it--

_bump--bump--bump_. He taxied along at last. Having shut off his motor befo=
re his plane was at a=20

standstill, he pushed back his hood and plunged into the sea.  He was not a=
n instant too soon, for=20

again came the rattle of the machine-gun fire. The enemy was shooting up hi=
s plane on the sea,=20

trying to kill him while he was down. Ted, for the moment, was safe enough.=
 He had gone beneath=20

the surface.  When he came up blowing, he saw the screamer circle for anoth=
er try. Then an=20

amazing thing happened. Some heavy object came hurtling down from the enemy=
 plane.  "What is=20

it?" he asked himself. Then, "Good grief! It's a man!"  The body hit the wa=
ter with killing force, if=20

indeed the man was not already dead. It sank from sight.  "The dirty dogs!"=
 Ted exclaimed, when=20

his head had ceased whirling. "They tried to kill me after I'd made a crash=
 landing! Looks like one=20

of them got paid off, though."                                   CHAPTER XX=
I                       MARY BROWN=20

FROM THE U. S. A.   Jack and Stew had heard Ted's battle with the jet plane=
 without seeing it.=20

They had become tremendously excited but were unable to do anything about i=
t.  Before Ted's=20

adventure began, Jack was just sitting up, rubbing his eyes sleepily after =
only three hours of rest.=20

He said:  "Life on this island has become impossible. There are five of tho=
se beasts against us.=20

They have machine guns and plenty of ammunition. We have automatics with ju=
st the slugs that=20

were in their chambers when we arrived."  "There are the natives," Stew sug=
gested.  "Those=20

Germans and Japs would mow them down like grass," was the quick reply. "It =
will be better for the=20

natives if they're never discovered."  "They'll be discovered all right," S=
tew declared. "You can't=20

hide for long on this island. It's too small. I'm surprised that those fell=
ows haven't hunted us down=20

long before this," he added.  "Well, they won't do that just yet." Jack dre=
w in a deep breath of=20

relief. "There they go, or at least the Germans must be leaving. If they go=
 we should be able to=20

handle the Japs." He had caught the low whistle rising into a scream that t=
old of the jet plane's=20

departure.  "If only I could get my hands on that baby!" Jack exclaimed, th=
inking of the jet plane.=20

"I'd fly her right to the deck of the old _Black Bee_."  "And get yourself =
good and shot up by your=20

own pals," Stew laughed. "There's no mark of identification on that jet pla=
ne."  "That's right," Jack=20

admitted. "But she does carry a radio. I'd announce my arrival."  "Well, yo=
u haven't got her yet.=20



You--"  Stew stopped suddenly to listen. Jack cocked his head on one side. =
Back of the high-

pitched scream of the departing jet plane they could hear the low roar of a=
n approaching plane of=20

quite another character.  "That's Ted!" Jack exclaimed. "Great Scott! I hop=
e he doesn't meet that=20

jet plane!"  "Be a swell fight. Ted is really good. I'd like to see that fi=
ght." Stew's eyes shone.  "Yes,=20

Ted is good, all right," Jack admitted. "But something tells me that jet pl=
ane is a natural for fighting.=20

It's got amazing speed. Besides, I'll bet it's as easy to handle as a bicyc=
le."  Three minutes later=20

they went racing for the rocky beach. The silence of their island had been =
torn to the movements=20

were forcibly controlled, severe pain ensued.  Next to the motor symptoms t=
he sensory are the=20

most important. Pain not infrequently occurs after the recovery of consciou=
sness in the affected=20

limb; it is apt to be sharp, severe, darting and neuralgic in character. Th=
is may last at intervals for=20

some days, a dull ache occurring at first between the intermissions. It dis=
appears of itself in time=20

without lasting effects.  Hyper=C3=A6sthesia may exist at first. Should thi=
s continue, or if an=C3=A6sthesia not=20

due to secondary traumatic conditions should appear later, we should be inc=
lined to place these=20

symptoms in the third class.  Of other symptoms occurring in accidents from=
 currents of high=20

potential, those which seem to be due to the direct action of the electrici=
ty are not serious. Buzzing=20

in the ears and a metallic taste in the mouth often occur at the very begin=
ning before the=20

consciousness is involved. Nausea and vomiting frequently occur later. Ther=
e is often=20

considerable dizziness and vertigo. Patients sometimes complain of sensatio=
ns as of an electric=20

shock running through the body which occur without cause some hours or even=
 days after the real=20

shock. Some of these sensations are certainly to be reckoned under the ment=
al or psychical=20

symptoms. Susceptibility to the effects of electricity, of lightning, and o=
f thunder-storms, though=20

undoubtedly in many cases psychical, has probably in some cases an actual f=
oundation. This is=20

certainly the case in lightning stroke. On the other hand, in the large maj=
ority of cases of electric=20

accidents no such result follows, and in many we are expressly told that su=
ch a result was looked=20

for but not found.  The temperature, as affected by the electricity alone a=
nd not as secondary=20

result of injuries, is not always easy to determine. It seems to be in most=
 cases lowered at first,=20

being in that of Moyer 97.5=C2=B0 and in that of Robert 97=C2=B0. Later it =
may rise to a certain extent, usually=20

to not more than 101=C2=B0, but here again the influence of traumata is dif=
ficult to separate.  The pulse=20

may be full and soft or weak and compressible. It is frequently very feeble=
, sometimes almost=20

imperceptible, and often rapid. It is apt to remain rapid and somewhat soft=
 for days in severe=20

cases.  The respiration is at first rapid in severe cases unless the shock =
be so great as to cause its=20

cessation. This rapidity remains for a varying period and then disappears. =
 As a typical case of the=20

results of shock from an electric wire, we will mention the one reported by=
 Dr. F. W. Jackson. The=20

patient, a man twenty-two years old, came in contact with a live electric-l=
ight wire, touching it with=20

his hands. He was thrown a distance of about ten feet and then back again, =
=E2=80=9Cswinging back and=20

forth two or three times.=E2=80=9D His hands were in contact with the wire =
about three minutes, when the=20

current broke and he fell to the ground unconscious. Was seen two hours lat=
er by physician.=20

Temperature 100=C2=B0; pulse 100, strong and bounding; pupils dilated; head=
ache; nervous and=20

irritable; reflexes increased. The headache was accompanied by insomnia whi=
ch continued for=20

three days, after which it disappeared, and he resumed work apparently none=
 the worse for his=20

accident. The palmar surfaces of both hands and the anterior surfaces of th=
e forearms were=20

blackened from the tips of the fingers to a point midway between the wrists=
 and the elbows, and=20



these parts were exceedingly sensitive to the touch. The least irritation o=
f the muscles would=20

cause them to contract violently. This condition ceased on the second day. =
The current was from a=20

fifty-light arc circuit of about 2,100 volts; 6.8 amperes. The accident too=
k place out-of-doors on a=20

very rainy night. The amount of electricity which the patient received was,=
 as in all such cases,=20

very uncertain.   FATAL CURRENT.  The amount of current which will produce =
a fatal effect varies=20

with the character of the current and with the points of contact. Currents =
passing through the head=20

or those which affect the pneumogastric nerves are much more dangerous than=
 others of the=20

same character and equal strength passing through one extremity, for exampl=
e.  The same current=20

will, of course, also produce different effects, according to the facility =
of its conduction into and=20

through the body, and this depends again on the completeness of the contact=
 and whether the=20

body or the portion thereof concerned enters directly into the circuit or o=
nly forms, as it were, a=20

partial conductor and diverts a certain portion only of the current to itse=
lf. Again, the condition of=20

the epidermis, whether dry or wet, and the position of the person in relati=
on to good conductors,=20

metallic or otherwise, has much effect.  If the skin and clothes be wet, th=
e resistance to the current=20

is lessened and it passes=20


_
machine-gun fire. Since it came from the sea they guessed that Ted had met =
the jet plane.  "That=20

wasn't Ted's gun," Stew said.  "No, it wasn't." Jack agreed solemnly.  The =
wind was toward the=20

island. A large cloud hid the battle, but every sound of it came to them. J=
ack could picture it all in=20

his mind. Ted's effort to gain the advantage, the terrible speed of his ene=
my, the flash of fire, the=20

dip of wings, the sudden downward plunges and the upward sweeps in an effor=
t to get on top--all=20

this came to his mind.  With lips parted and hearts pounding, Jack and Stew=
 stood there in silence,=20

listening. They knew from the thunder and scream of the planes just what wa=
s going on. "It's as if=20

a pilot in a man-made plane were fighting with one of those prehistoric fly=
ing reptiles," Jack=20

murmured huskily.  "Reptiles all right," was Stew's comment, "but not prehi=
storic."  Jack held his=20

breath as he heard Ted make his dash for that smaller cloud. He understood =
perfectly that Ted=20

was heading for the surface of the sea when he took his final plunge and se=
nsed, with a deep=20

pang of a person stands in close relation to a good conductor and places hi=
s hand on one wire of=20

a high-tension electric circuit, he will receive a much more severe shock t=
han if not connected with=20

such conductor. Thus a person standing in a pool of water (water is a good =
conductor), and more=20

strongly if standing on the metallic rail of a railway track, and touching =
one wire of an electric=20

circuit with one hand, receives a much stronger shock than if he were stand=
ing on dry land, or if=20

his boots were rubber or he was otherwise insulated.  The accidents most fr=
equent in practice are=20

those in which the current has been partially diverted from its original co=
urse and the person has=20

not entered fully into the circuit. In such cases it is not usually possibl=
e to estimate accurately or=20

even approximately the amount of current which the person has received. No =
calculations can,=20

therefore, be based on these accidents. Again, we find that a person may be=
 seriously or even=20

fatally injured by a current which another person seems to bear with impuni=
ty.  D=E2=80=99Arsonval in 1887,=20
