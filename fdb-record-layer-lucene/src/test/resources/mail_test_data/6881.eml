it. The kinds of pitsand are these: black, gray, red, and carbuncular. Of these the best will be found 

to be that which crackles when rubbed in the hand, while that which has much dirt in it will not be 

sharp enough. Again: throw some sand upon a white garment and then shake it out; if the garment 

is not soiled and no dirt adheres to it, the sand is suitable.  2. But if there are no sandpits from 

which it can be dug, then we must sift it out from river beds or from gravel or even from the sea 

beach. This kind, however, has these defects when used in masonry: it dries slowly; the wall 

cannot be built up without interruption but from time to time there must be pauses in the work; and 

such a wall cannot carry vaultings. Furthermore, when sea-sand is used in walls and these are 

coated with stucco, a salty efflorescence is given out which spoils the surface.  3. But pitsand used 

in masonry dries quickly, the stucco coating is permanent, and the walls can support vaultings. I 

am speaking of sand fresh from the sandpits. For if it lies unused too long after being taken out, it 

is disintegrated by exposure to sun, moon, or hoar frost, and becomes earthy. So when mixed in 

masonry, it has no binding power on the rubble, which consequently settles and down comes the 

load which the walls can no longer support. Fresh pitsand, however, in spite of all its excellence in 

concrete structures, is not equally useful in stucco, the richness of which, when the lime and straw 

are mixed with such sand, will cause it to crack as it dries on account of the great strength of the 

mixture. But river sand, though useless in "signinum" on account of its thinness, becomes perfectly 

solid in stucco when thoroughly worked by means of polishing instruments.     CHAPTER V  LIME 

1. Sand and its sources having been thus treated, next with regard to lime we must be careful that 

it is burned from a stone which, whether soft or hard, is in any case white. Lime made of close-

grained stone of the harder sort will be good in structural parts; lime of porous stone, in stucco. 

After slaking it, mix your mortar, if using pitsand, in the proportions of three parts of sand to one of 

lime; if using river or sea-sand, mix two parts of sand with one of lime. These will be the right 

proportions for the composition of the mixture. Further, in using river or sea-sand, the addition of a 

third part composed of burnt brick, pounded up and sifted, will make your mortar of a better 

composition to use.  2. The reason why lime makes a solid structure on being combined with water 

and sand seems to be this: that rocks, like all other bodies, are composed of the four elements. 

Those which contain a larger proportion of air, are soft; of water, are tough from the moisture; of 

earth, hard; and of fire, more brittle. Therefore, if limestone, without being burned, is merely 

pounded up small and then mixed with sand and so put into the work, the mass does not solidify 

nor can it hold together. But if the stone is first thrown into the kiln, it loses its former property of 

solidity by exposure to the great heat of the fire, and so with its strength burnt out and exhausted it 

is left with its pores open and empty. Hence, the moisture and air in the body of the stone being 

burned out and set free, and only a people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to 

provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's 

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for 

generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to 

provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn 

more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations 

can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project 

Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and 

donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works 

that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of 

equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly 

important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to 

complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United 

States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much 

paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit 

donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND 

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org 

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation 

requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in 

such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully 

accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received 

from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project 

Gutenberg Web pages for

the stone is then immersed in water, the moisture, before the water can feel the influence of the 

fire, makes its way into the open pores; then the stone begins to get hot, and finally, after it cools 

off, the heat is rejected from the body of the lime.  3. Consequently, limestone when taken out of 

the kiln cannot be as heavy as when it was thrown in, but on methods and addresses.  Donations 

are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card 

donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About
