.  "I was a young=20

man", he continues, "and didn't see why I should be anybody's slave. I'd ru=

got. Sometimes they near killed me, but mostly they just sold me. I guess I=
 was pretty husky, at=20

that."  "They never did get their money's worth out of me, though. I worked=
 as long as they stood=20

over me, then I ran around with the gals or sneaked off to the woods. Somet=
imes they used to put=20

dogs on me to get me back.  "When they finally sold me to a man up in Suwan=

name was Harris--I thought it would be the end of the world. We had heard a=
bout him all the way=20

up in Virginia. They said he beat you, starved you and tied you up when you=
 didn't work, and killed=20

you if you ran away.  "But I never had a better master. He never beat me, a=

at now and then,=20

cabbages, greens, potatoes, and plenty of molasses. When I worked up at 'th=

what the master et; sometimes he would give it to me his-self. When he didn=
't, I et it anyway.  "He=20

was so good, and I was so scared of him, till I didn't ever run away from h=

reminisces; "I had somebody there that I liked, anyway. When he finally wen=

me back to a man in North Carolina, in Hornett County. But the war was near=

was as free as I am now.  "I guess we musta celebrated 'Mancipation about t=

go back to work, and we would go. Some of us wanted to jine up with the arm=

who was goin' to win and didn't take no chances.  "I was 21 when freedom fi=
nally came, and that=20

time I didn't take no chances on 'em taking it back again. I lit out for Fl=
orida and wound up in=20

Madison County. I had a nice time there; I got married, got a plenty of wor=
k, and made me a little=20

money. I fixed houses, built 'em, worked around the yards, and did everythi=
ng. My first child was=20

already born; I didn't know there was goin' to be 37 more, though. I guess =
I would have stopped=20

right there....  "I stayed in Madison County until they started to working =
concrete rock down here. I=20

heard about it and thought that would be a good way for me to feed all them=
 two dozen children I=20

had. So I came down this side. That was about 20 years ago.  "I got married=
 again after I got here;=20

right soon after. My wife now is 30 years old; we already had 13 children t=
ogether. (His wife is a=20

slight, girlish-looking woman; she says she was 13 when she married Douglas=
s, had her first child=20

that year. Eleven of her thirteen are still living.)  "Yossuh, I ain't long=
 stopped work. I worked here=20

in the phosphate mine until last year, when they started to paying pensions=

one, but all I got was some PWA work, and this year they told me I was too =
old for that. I told 'em I=20

wasn't but 91, but they didn't give nothin' else. I guess I'll get my pensi=

Carthage and Venice were merely great commercial cities, which, when they e=
ntered on a career=20

of conquest, were compelled at once to form armies of mercenaries, and to i=
ncur all the evil=20

consequences by which the employment of those vile and fatal instruments of=
 ambition is=20

attended. England being, not a commercial city, but a nation, and a nation =
endowed with the=20

highest military qualities, has escaped the fell necessity except in the ca=
se of India; and India,=20

under the reign of the Company, and even for some time after its legal anne=
xation to the Crown,=20



was regarded and treated almost as a realm in another planet, with an army,=
 a political system,=20

and a morality of its own. But now it appears that the wrongs of the Hindoo=
 are going to be=20

avenged, as the wrongs of the conquered have often been, by their moral eff=
ect upon the=20

conqueror. A body of barbarian mercenaries has appeared upon the European s=
cene as an=20

integral part of the British army, while the reflex influence of Indian Emp=
ire upon the political=20

character and tendencies of the imperial nation is too manifest to be any l=
onger overlooked.=20

England now stands where the paths divide, the one leading by industrial an=
d commercial=20

progress to increase of political liberty; the other, by a career of conque=
st, to the political results in=20

which such a career has never yet failed to end. At present the influences =
in favour of taking the=20

path of conquest seemed to preponderate, [Footnote: Written in 1878.] and t=
he probability seems=20

to be that the leadership of political progress, which has hitherto belonge=
d to England and has=20

constituted the special interest of her history, will, in the near future, =
pass into other hands.     THE=20

GREAT DUEL OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY  [Footnote: In this lecture free use =

authorities. To Chapman's excellent Life of Gustavus Adolphus we are under =
special obligations.=20

In some passages it has been closely followed. Colonel Mitchell has also su=
pplied some remarks=20

and touches, such as are to be found only in a military writer.]  AN EPISOD=
E OF THE THIRTY=20

YEARS' WAR.   The Thirty Years' War is an old story, but its interest has b=
een recently revived.=20

The conflict between Austria and German Independence commenced in the strug=
gle of the=20

Protestant Princes against Charles V., and, continued on those battle-field=
s, was renewed and=20

decided at Sadowa. At Sadowa Germany was fighting for unity as well as for =
independence. But in=20

the Thirty Years' War it was Austria that with her Croats, the Jesuits who =
inspired her councils,=20

and her Spanish allies, sought to impose a unity of death, against which Pr=
otestant Germany=20

struggled, preserving herself for a unity of life which, opened by the vict=
ories of Frederick the=20

Great, and, more nobly promoted by the great uprising of the nation against=
 the tyranny of=20

Napoleon, was finally accomplished at Sadowa, and ratified against French j=
ealousy at Sedan.=20

Costly has been the achievement; lavish has been the expenditure of German =
blood, severe the=20

sufferings of the German people. It is the lot of all who aspire high--no m=
an or nation ever was=20

dandled into greatness.  The Thirty Years' War was a real world-contest. Au=
stria and Spain drew=20

after them all the powers of reaction; all the powers of liberty and progre=
ss were arrayed on the=20

other side. The half-barbarous races that lay between civilized=20

So down into the "scrub" I went and found the old woman hustling about from=

"I'm mighty busy now, cookin breakfast," she said, "but if you come back in=

what I can bout old times in Tampa."  On the return visit, her skinny dog m=

demonstrations of welcome.  "Guan way fum here Spot. Dat gemmen ain gwine f=

You keep your dirty paws offen his clothes."  Mama duck sat herself was dra=
wn diplomatically into=20

the vortex. In the mines of Mexico and Peru the Indian toiled to furnish bo=
th the Austrian and=20

Spanish hosts. The Treaty of Westphalia, which concluded the struggle, long=
 remained the Public=20

Law of Europe.  Half religious, half political, in its character, this war =
stands midway between the=20

religious wars of the sixteenth century, and the political wars of the eigh=
