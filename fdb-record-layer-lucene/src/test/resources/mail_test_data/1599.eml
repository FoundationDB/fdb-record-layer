 the poet knows that history is not a science but one of the most fascinati=

 the powers of evil; their pity was but for one whom they deemed a simple g=

of memory; we remember only by forgetting most of the things we have done o=
r have suffered,=20

and rearranging the rest. As we grow older life becomes clearer, we say, th=
anks to this selection=20

and forgetting. When art sifts life, then, it is only imitating the process=
 of nature, and when we=20

observe the process we can understand why the Greeks said that memory was t=
he mother of the=20

muses. But this sifting of life on the part of memory kissed the simple emb=
lem and put it in her=20

bosom. But Isambart fetched a crucifix for her from the very altar of the n=
eighboring church of=20

Saint-Sauveur, and this she kissed passionately, desiring him to hold it al=
oft where she might see=20

it to the last as the smoke and flame mounted. Isambart ascended the pile w=
ith her, and the=20

executioner fastened her body to the post in the centre. With her eyes fixe=

times whether it has not gone too far. Some of the clarity of vision, the f=
irmness of doctrine, which=20

is the reward of old age, may be not the genuine harvesting of experience w=
hich is almost the gift=20

of prophecy; it may be rather a partial memory which seems clear because so=
 much has been left=20

out. If a poet could get a first-hand impression of life, his art would be =
one sifting of nature; if he=20

reacts not only to nature but to the interpretations of other poets, his ar=
t is a second sifting, more=20

highly organized, perhaps, more intelligible, than is normally recorded fro=
m immediate contact with=20

life. It makes no difference whether we call these siftings poetry or criti=
cism, since poetry, as=20

Arnold reminded us, is a criticism of life. The poet may submit his sensiti=
veness to nature as sifted=20

through three or four or any number of interventions of personality, and we=
 may call the result=20

poetry, or criticism, or criticism of criticism; very often we cannot tell,=
 and the poet does not know,=20

whether the life that stimulates him is direct or transmitted. But in each =
remove from the first=20

contact with nature, in each additional intervention of personality, we get=
 a clearer order and a=20

finer intelligibility=E2=80=94truth instead of facts, formulas instead of e=
xperiences, and fewer above her=20

head: "Heretic, relapser, apostate, idolater." In this hour of supreme tria=
l no moment of fatal=20

weakness came to deprive her of our absolute admiration. She spoke no word =
of deserved=20

reproach against her rude executioners, against the soldiers who had hustle=
d her across the=20

market place, against the miserable Charles for whom she suffered all these=
 tortures and who had=20

abandoned her. "Whether I have done well, or whether I have done ill, my Ki=
ng is not to blame; it=20

was not he who counselled me." Even the miserable Cauchon was greeted, as h=
e hovered about=20

the foot of the pile to catch her last words, with nothing more bitter than=
: "Bishop! Bishop! I die=20

through you!... Had you confined me in the prisons of the Church, this woul=
d not have happened."=20

While the good monk lingers by her side, pouring into that saintly ear such=
 words of comfort and=20

hope as faith may suggest, the executioner applies his torch and Jeanne see=
s the flames rush=20

upward. "Jesus!" she cries, then exhorts the monk, "Fly, father! and when t=
he flame shall cover me=20

hold aloft the crucifix, that I may see it as I die, and repeat for me your=
 holy words until the end."=20

She thought of others, not of herself, even in this hour: who shall impugn =
her courage, or say she=20

knew not how to die as nobly=20


_
naturalism will at last emerge in philosophy, if we allow it time enough, a=
nd the biography of an=20

individual will be condensed and generalized into a proverb.  There are two=
 good reasons,=20

however, for suspecting this economical result. One is that the proverb is =
probably not true. To=20

arrive at pain, as the flames touched her body, she shrieked. After this bu=
t a few broken sentences=20

came to the ears of those at the foot of the pile, sometimes appeals to the=
 saints who had guided=20

her, sometimes a despairing cry of anguish not to be suppressed. And then i=
n the midst of the=20

gathering=20


_
in each successive sifting we have left out something, and the total of all=
 the omissions has=20

become almost as comprehensive as the original experience. We must go back =
and gather up the=20

discarded fragments of our adventure, in order to qualify properly our too =
simple and absolute=20

summary of life. The art of the historian, we often fear, progresses by som=
e such over-elimination;=20

arch=C3=A6ology sometimes rescues him by restoring large sections of a past=
, the absence of which he=20

had not noticed, but in periods too moaned, "Jesus!"  The voice that had ar=
oused France from her=20

lethargy was hushed forever; the great spirit of Jeanne d'Arc had gone to G=
od, whence it came.=20

Shall we stand by the smoking pyre till the last embers turn gray and cold,=
 till Winchester orders=20

the handful of ashes that remained to be swept into the Seine? Or shall we =
turn away, sick with=20

horror, filled already with vain regret of the deed done, as did many in th=
at dense crowd of her=20

enemies? "We have burnt a saint!" cries one. "I saw a dove fly=20

t his account is nearer to=20

our philosophy than to the original facts. In history this tendency is hard=
ly a matter of concern, for if=20

we have a criticism of the eighteenth century which satisfies us, we are co=
ntent, and the=20

eighteenth century, being dead and gone, will not mind; the poet, therefore=
, can look on with=20
