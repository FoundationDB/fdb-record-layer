Prepelicza had not told her the secret, and had thus proved himself a cleve=

ow, when the two brothers _
closely linked to the tortoise. The Lepidosiren Annectens, found in the Whi=
te Nile, is a link between=20

the fish and the frog; and certain varieties of mud fish that remain alive =
throughout a dry season in=20

the sun-baked earth, and reappear with the following rains exhibit a close =
affinity to reptiles.  On=20

the morning after our arrival, I started to explore the country with the ag=
gageers, and rode about=20

forty miles, From this point, hills of basalt and granite commenced, connec=
ted by rugged=20

undulations of white quartz, huge blocks of which were scattered upon the s=
urface; in many of=20

these I found thin veins of galena.  All the rocks were igneous; we had lef=
t the sandstone that had=20

marked the course of the Atbara and the valley of the Settite as far as Omb=
rega, and I was=20

extremely puzzled to account for the presence of the pure white and rose-co=
loured limestone that=20

we had found only in one place--Geera. As we were now among the hills and m=
ountains, the=20

country was extremely beautiful; at the farthest point of that day's excurs=
ion we were close to the=20

high range from which, in the rainy season, innumerable torrents pour into =
the Settite; some of=20

these gorges were ornamented with the dark foliage of large tamarind trees,=
 while upon rocks that=20

did not appear to offer any sustenance, the unsightly yet mighty baobab* gr=
asped with its gnarled=20

roots the blocks of granite, and formed a peculiar object in the wild and r=
ugged scenery.    * The=20

largest baobab (Adansonia digitata) that I have     measured was fifty-one =
feet and one inch in=20

circumference.  Through this romantic wilderness, the Settite flowed in a c=
lear and other would=20

perhaps be inclined to pay something too. So he got into the train, travell=
ed to Besztercebanya,=20

and looked up Boldizsar. There was nothing surprising in that except, perha=
ps, the fact that=20

Prepelicza was not such a fool as he looked.  "Oh, the wretch!" Gaspar kept=
 on saying. "But he=20

shall not have it, I _will_ buy it. I'll give you 25,000 florins for it."  =
Sztolarik smiled and rubbed his=20

hands.  "It will belong to the one who gives most for it. If it were mine, =
I would give it you for the=20

15,000 florins you offered at first, for I always keep my word. But as it b=
elongs to a minor, and I=20

have his interests at heart, I must do the best I can for him. Now don't yo=
u think I am right?"=20

Gaspar agreed with him, and tried to make him promise to give him the prefe=
rence. But what was=20

the good of it? Sztolarik met Boldizsar that evening at the club, and made =
no secret of the fact that=20

Gaspar had been to see him that morning, and offered him 5000 florins more =
for the orchard. But=20

Boldizsar was not surprised, and only answered:  "Well, I will give 30,000.=
"  And this mad auction=20

went on for days, until the attention of the whole town was drawn to it, an=
d people began to think=20

the Gregorics must have gone mad, or that there must be some important reas=
on for their wishing=20

to have possession of "Lebanon."  Gaspar came and offered 32,000 florins, a=
nd as soon as=20

Boldizsar heard of it, he came and offered 3000 florins more; and so on, un=
til people's hair began=20

to stand on end.  "Let them go on as long as they like," thought the lawyer=
.  And they did go on,=20

until they reached the sum of 50,000 florins, which was=20


_
width of a hundred yards, at others stretching to three times that distance=
. The hippopotami were=20

in great numbers; many were lying beneath the shady trees upon the banks, a=
nd splashed into the=20

water as we appeared; others were basking in large herds upon the shallows;=
 while the young=20

calves, supported upon the backs of their mothers, sailed about upon their =
animated rafts in=20

perfect security. The Base had been here recently, as we discovered their f=
ootprints upon the=20

sand, and we arrived at some tobacco plantations that they had formed upon =
the gone on still.=20

The engineer had been to look at the place, and had declared there was noth=
ing of any value to=20

be found there, not even a bit of gold, unless it were the stoppings of som=
e dead woman's teeth.=20

"But supposing there is coal there?"  "Not a sign of it."  "Then what on ea=
rth are the Gregorics=20

thinking of?"  Whatever the reason was, it was certainly to Gyuri's advanta=
ge, and his guardian=20

meant to make the most of the opportunity, so he let the two brothers go on=
 bidding till the sum=20

promised was 50,000 florins. He intended to wait till=20
