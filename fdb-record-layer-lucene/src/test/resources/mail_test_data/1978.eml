G. B.     _Tuesday the Fifth_   The weather is balmier, and just a tinge of=
 green is creeping into the=20

tan of the foot-hill slopes. Spring is coming again.  I went shopping in th=
e Hudson Bay Store=20

yesterday and found it much more metropolitan than I had expected. And I fi=
nd I am three whole=20

laps behind in that steeplechase known as Style. But I got a raft of things=
 for Pauline Augusta, and=20

a Boy Scout outfit for my laddie.  One of the few women I like in Calgary i=
s Dinkie's--I mean=20

Elmer's--new school-teacher. Her name is Lossie Brown and she is an earnest=
-eyed girl who's=20

saving up to go to Europe some day and study art. She's a trifle shy, and u=
nmistakably moody, but=20

her mind is as bright as a new pin. And some bright morning, when the rose =
of womanhood has=20

really opened, she's going to wake up a howling beauty. I love her, too, fo=
r the interest she has=20

taken in my boy, whom she reports as getting along much better than she had=
 expected. So I have=20

asked her to write a little note to Gershom Binks, advising him of his ex-p=
upil's advance. For=20

Lossie is a girl I'd like Gershom to know. And she has done this for me. I =
ask her over to the house=20

as often as I can and yesterday I had Dinkie slip a little platinum-banded =
fountain-pen, with a card,=20

into the pocket of her rather threadbare ulster. Duncan, however, is not in=
 the least interested in=20

Lossie. He despises what he calls insignificant people.  On my way home fro=
m shopping I had=20

Hilton drive me about some of the less-known parts of the city. And I have =
been compelled to=20

recast some of my earlier impressions of Calgary. It is wonderful, in many =
ways, and some day, I=20

can see, it will be beautiful, just as Lossie Brown will some day be beauti=
ful.  In the first place, it is=20

so happily situated, lying as it does half-way between the mountains and th=
e plain. And the blue=20

Bow comes dancing so joyously down from the Rockies and the older city slee=
ps so happily in the=20

sunny crook of its valley-arm, while the newer suburbs seem to boil up and =
run over the=20

surrounding hills like champagne bubbling over the rim of a glass. There ar=
e raw edges, of course,=20

but time will eventually attend to these. Now and then, between the motor-c=
ars, you will see a=20

creaking Red River cart. Next to an office-building of gray sandstone you'r=
e likely to spot what=20

looks like a squatter's wickyup of rusty galvanized iron. Yesterday, on our=
 main street where the=20

electric-cars were clanging and the limousines were throwing their exhaust =
incense to the gods of=20

the future, I caught sight of a lonely and motionless figure, isolated in t=
he midst of a newer world. It=20

was the figure of a Cree squaw, blanketed and many-wrinkled and unmistakabl=
y dirty, blinking at=20

the devil-wagons and the ceaseless hurry of the white man. And being somewh=
at Indianized, as=20

my husband once assured me I was, I could sympathize with that stolid old l=
ady in the blanket.  I'm=20

even beginning to find that one can get tired of optimism, especially when =
it is being so plainly=20

converted from a psychic abstraction into a municipal asset. There's a sort=
 of communal Christian=20

Science in this place which ordains that thought shall not dwell on such tr=
ansient evils as drought=20

or black rust or early frost or hail-storms or money stringencies. And ther=
e's a sort of youthful=20



greediness in people's longing to live all there is of life to live and to =
know all there is of life to=20

know. For there is a limit to the sensations we can digest, just as there i=
s a limit to the meat we=20

can digest. And out here we have a tendency to bolt more than is good for u=
s, to bolt it without=20

pausing to get the true taste of it. The women of this town remind me more =
and more of mice in an=20

oxygen bell; they race round and round, drunk with an excitement they can't=
 quite understand,=20

until they burn up their little lives the same as the mice burn up their li=
ttle lungs.  ... I've had a letter=20

from Whinstane Sandy to-day, writing about seed-wheat and the repairs for t=
he tractor. It seems=20

like a message from another world. He reports that poor old Scotty is eatin=
g again and no longer=20

mourns day in and day out for his lost master. And Mr. Ketley has very kind=
ly brought over the=20

liniment for Mudski's shoulder. ... Whatever I may be, or whatever I may ha=
ve done, I feel that I=20

can still cleanse my heart by sacrifice.     _Friday the Ninth_   One can g=
et out of the habit,=20

apparently, of having children about. My kiddies, I begin to see, occasiona=
lly grate on Duncan. He=20

brought tears to the eyes of Pauline Augusta yesterday by the way he scolde=
d her for using a=20

lead-pencil on the living-room woodwork. And the night before he shouted mu=
ch strong language=20

at Elmer for breaking a window-pane in the garage with Benny McArthur's new=
 air-gun.  Elmer and=20

his father, I'm afraid, have rather grown away from each other. More than o=
nce I've caught Duncan=20

staring at his son and heir in a puzzled and a slightly frustrated sort of =
way. And Elmer's soul=20

promptly becomes _incommunicado_ when his iron-browed pater is in the neigh=
borhood.  Duncan=20

is very proud of his grand new house. He is anxious to build a conservatory=
 out along the=20

southwest wing. But he has asked how long a conservatory would last with tw=
o young mountain-

goats gamboling along its leads.... Lossie, little suspecting the pang she =
was giving me, laughingly=20

showed me a manuscript which she found by accident in my Dinkie's reader. I=
t was a poem,=20

dedicated to "D. O'L." And written in a stiff little hand I read:          =
          "Your lips are lined with=20

roses,                     Your eyes they shinne like gold                 =
  If you call me from the sunlight,=20

I'll answer from the cold.                   But I wonder why, Oh, why,    =
                 You stay so far from=20

me?                   If you whisper from the prarrie,                     =
I'll call from Calgary."  "Won't it be=20

wonderful," said Lossie as I sat pondering over those foolish little lines,=
 "won't it be wonderful, if=20

Dinkie grows up to be a great poet?"     _Monday the Eleventh_   Elmer, _al=
ias_ Dinkie, after many=20

days' mourning for his lost Scotty, is consoling himself, as other men do, =
with a substitute. Last=20

Friday he Brought home a flop-eared pup with a drooping tail and an indefin=
ite ancestry,=20

explaining that he had come into possession of the aforementioned animal by=
 the duly delivered=20

purchase-price of thirty-seven cents.  Remembering Minty and certain matter=
s of the past, I was=20

troubled in spirit. But I couldn't see why my son shouldn't have an animal =
to love. And I have had=20

Hilton fix a little box in one corner of the garage for Dinkie's new pet, w=
hich he has christened=20

Rowdy.  Rowdy, I now see, is a canine of limited spirit and is not likely t=
o repeat the offenses of=20

Minty. But Dinkie really loves his new pup, despite the latter's indubitabl=
y democratic ancestry.=20

And I begin to suspect that my laddie's weakness for mongrels may arise fro=
m his earlier=20

experience with Duncan's blooded bulldog, which he struggled with for three=
 whole days, fondly=20

and foolishly trying to teach that stolid animal the art of "pointing."  On=
 Saturday Dinkie smuggled=20

the verminous Rowdy to the upper bathroom and gave him a thorough but quite=
 unrelished=20

soaping ... Dinkie, by the way, is now a "cub" in the Boy Scouts and after =
adorning himself in khaki=20

goes off on hikes and takes lessons in woodcraft. Saturday the Scouts of hi=
s school marched=20



behind a real band and Lossie and I sat in the car waiting for my laddie to=
 appear. He wiggled one=20

hand, and smiled sheepishly, as he caught sight of us. But he kept "eyes fr=
ont" and refused to give=20

any further sign as he marched bravely on behind that brave music. He is le=
arning the law of the=20

pack. For some first frail ideas of service are beginning to incubate in th=
at egoistic little bean of his.=20

And he's suffering, I suppose, the old contest between the ancestral lust t=
o kill and the new-born=20

inclination to succor and preserve. That means he may some day be "a gentle=
man." And I've a=20

weakness for that old Newman definition of a gentleman as one who never inf=
licts pain--"tender=20

towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and merciful towards the a=
bsurd"--conducting=20

himself toward his enemy as if he were some day to be his friend. And I als=
o wish there were a=20

few more of them in this hard old world of ours!  Speaking of gentlemen, th=
ere's a Captain=20

Goodhue here whom I rather like. Lois Murchison brought us together in the =
tea-room of the=20

Palliser. In more ways than one he reminds me of Peter. But Captain Goodhue=
 is a much older=20

man, and is English, coming from a very excellent family in Sussex. He's on=
e of those iron-gray=20

ex-Army men who still believe in a monocle and can be loyal to a queen even=
 though she wears a=20

basque with darts in it. And he doesn't talk to a woman with that ragging a=
ir of condescension=20

which seems to be peculiar to western American civilization. He is courteou=
s and thoughtful and=20

sincere, though I noticed that he winced a trifle when I suddenly remembere=
d, as he was taking=20

his departure, that the McKails were living in what must have once been his=
 house. He blinked,=20

like a well-groomed old eagle, when I reminded him of this. I never dreamed=
, of course, that the=20

subject would be painful to him. But it was an honor, he acknowledged with =
a bow, to pass his=20

household gods on to a lady to whom so much had already been given.  When I=
 asked Lois about=20

it, later on, she rather indifferently acknowledged that the old gentleman =
had been making a mess=20

of his different business ventures. He was much better at golf than getting=
 in on the ground-floor of=20

a land deal. He was too old fogy, said Slinkie, to make good in the West. H=
e still kept his head up,=20

but they'd pretty well picked him to the bones.... Lois, by the way, descri=
bes me as something new=20

in her menagerie and drops in to see me at the most unexpected moments. The=
n her tongue goes=20

like a mower-knife. She is persuaded that I should permanent-wave my hair, =
lower my waist-line,=20

and go in for amethysts. "And interest yourself, my dear, in an outside man=
 or two," she has=20

sagely advised me. "For husbands, you'll find, always accept you at the oth=
er mutt's valuation!"  I=20

was tempted to make her open her jade-green eyes, for a moment, by telling =
her I was already=20

interested in an outside man or two and that my lord and master hadn't been=
 much influenced by=20

the extraneous appreciations. But I'm a little afraid of Slinkie and her se=
rpent's tongue. And I'm a=20

little afraid of this new circle into which my Duncan has so laboriously en=
gineered himself. They=20

more and more impress on my simple old prairie soul that the single-track w=
oman is the woman=20

who gets most out of life, that there's nothing really great and nothing re=
ally enduring that is not=20

built on loyalty and truth. Character is Fate, as I once before inscribed i=
n this book of my life. And=20

I've been sitting up to-night, while the eternal bridge game is going on be=
low, asking myself if all is=20

well with Chaddie McKail. Have I, or have I not, conceded too much? Am I tu=
rning into nothing=20

more than a mush of concession? Haven't I been bribed by comfort, and blind=
ed to a situation=20

which I am now almost afraid to face? Haven't I been selfishly scheming for=
 the welfare of my=20

children and endangering all their future and my own by the price I am payi=
ng? Haven't I been=20

crazily manning a rickety old pump, trying to keep afloat a family hulk who=
se seams are wide open=20



and whose timbers are water-logged? And how long can this sort of thing go =
on? And what will be=20

the end of it?  I try to warn myself not to smash my goods to kill a rat, a=
s the Chinese say. I try to=20

flatter myself that I am not letting circumstances stampede me into any has=
ty decision. There's=20

many a woman, I suppose, with a husband whose legal promise has outlived hi=
s loyalty. But all is=20

not well here about my heart. I know that, by the way it keeps sending up l=
ittle trial-balloons, to see=20

which way the wind is really blowing.  ... And Sunday night Cattalo Charlie=
 went home quite drunk.=20

And our local member, emboldened by his seventh highball, offhandedly invit=
ed me to accompany=20

him on a little run up to Banff, stabbing me with a hurt look when I told h=
im I'd see when Duncan=20

could get away from his work....  I wonder if spring is coming to Casa Gran=
de? And at Alabama=20

Ranch? And are the pussy-willows showing in the slough-ends? And why doesn'=
t Peter Ketley=20

ever write to me?     _Saturday the Sixteenth_   Lossie and Gershom, I find=
, have drifted into the=20

habit of writing to each other. It is, of course, all purely platonic and p=
edagogic, arising out of a=20

common interest in my Dinkie's academic advancement. But Lossie borrowed Di=
nkie this morning=20

to have a photograph taken with him, one copy of which she has very generou=
sly promised to=20

send on to Gershom.... Struthers has sent me a very satisfactory report fro=
m Casa Grande, which=20

I dreamed last night had burned to the ground, compelling me and my kiddies=
 to live in the old=20

prairie-schooner, laboriously pulled about the prairie by Tithonus and Cala=
mity Kate. And when I=20

applied at Peter's door for a handful of meal for my starving children, he =
called me worse than a=20

fallen woman and drove me off into the wilderness.  Duncan asked me to-day =
if I'd motor up to the=20

mines with him for the week-end. I had to tell him that I'd promised to tak=
e Elmer and Pauline=20

Augusta to hear Kathleen Parlow and that it wouldn't seem quite fair to bre=
ak my word. Duncan=20

said that I was the best judge of that. Then he slammed a drawer shut and a=
sked me, in his newer=20

manner, how long I intended to pull this iceberg stuff. "For I can't see," =
he concluded after calling=20

out for Tokudo to bring his hat and coat, "that I'm getting such a hell of =
a lot out of this=20

arrangement!"  I asked him, as quietly as I could, what he expected of me. =
But I could feel my=20

heart pounding quick against my ribs. I am not, and never pretended to be, =
any stained-glass=20

saint. And there were a few things I felt it was about time to unload. But =
Tokudo cat-footed back=20

with the coat, and I could hear Lossie's clear laugh as she came in through=
 the front door with the=20

returning Dinkie, and some inner voice warned me to hold my peace. So Dunca=
n and I merely=20

stood there staring at each other, for a moment or two, across an abysmal a=
nd unbridgeable gulf=20

of silence. Then he strode out to his car without as much as a howdy-do to =
the startled and slightly=20

mystified Lossie.     _Monday the Eighteenth_   I have just learned that we=
 were blackballed from=20

the Country Club. My husband, at least, has met with that experience.  It w=
as Lois who let the cat=20

out of the bag. She wasn't clear on all the details, but it was that old ha=
s-been of a Goodhue who=20

was at the bottom of it all, according to the lady known as Slinkie. Duncan=
 and he had clashed,=20

from the first. Then Duncan had bought up his paper, and compelled him to m=
ortgage his home. It=20

was because of something to do with the Barcona Mines directorate, Lois tho=
ught, that Captain=20

Goodhue had had Duncan blackballed when he applied for membership in the Co=
untry Club, the=20

Captain being vice-president of the original holding company. Lois laughed =
none too pleasantly=20

when she added that her Charley and my Duncan had joined hands to go after =
the old man's=20

scalp. And they had got it. They turned him inside out, before they got thr=
ough with him. They took=20

his fore-lock and his teepee and his last string of wampum. And the old sno=
b, of course, would=20



never forgive them.  ... They took his fore-lock, and his teepee ... And it=
 was Chaddie McKail and=20

her bairns who were now housing warm in that captured teepee! And all this =
toiling and moiling, on=20

the part of my husband, all this scheming and intriguing and juggling with =
figures, had been a=20

campaign for power, a plotting and working to get even with this haughty ol=
d enemy who could=20

carry his defeat so lightly! To be blackballed like that, I remembered, was=
 to be proclaimed not a=20

gentleman. And it must have cut deep. At one time, I suppose, Duncan would =
have called his=20

monocled captain out. But men seem to fight differently nowadays. They figh=
t differently, but no=20

less grimly. And Duncan, whether it is a virtue or a vice in his make-up, w=
ould always be a=20

fighter.... Yet I have no sense of gratitude to Lois Murchison for depositi=
ng her painful truths in my=20

lap. She warned me, in her artless soprano, that there wasn't much good in =
sentimentalizing the=20

situation. But she has thrown a shadow across the house which I was trying =
to make into a home.=20

Without quite knowing it, she has cheapened her life-mate in my eyes. Witho=
ut quite intending it,=20

she has left my own husband more ignominious than he once stood. I was tryi=
ng hard to school=20

myself into a respect for his material successes. I was struggling to excus=
e a great many things by=20

the engrossing nature of his work. But the motive behind all his efforts se=
emed suddenly a sordid=20

one, in many ways a mean one.  I keep remembering what Lois said about not =
sentimentalizing a=20

situation. But I'm not yet such a mush of concession that I can't tell blac=
k from white. And there's=20

some part of us, some vague but unescapable part of us, which we must respe=
ct, otherwise we=20

have no right to walk God's good earth....  I want to get away, for a day o=
r two, to think things out. I=20

think, before Duncan gets back to-morrow, I shall take Poppsy and run up to=
 Banff. I may get my=20

view-point back. And the mountain quietness may do me good....  I keep havi=
ng that same dull=20

ache of disappointment which came to me as a girl, after I'd idolized a gre=
at man called Meredith=20

and after I'd almost prayed to a great poet called Browning, on finding tha=
t one was so imperfectly=20

monogamous and that the other philandered and talked foolishly to women. I =
had thrust my girlish=20

faith in their hands, as so often befalls with the young, and they had betr=
ayed it.... But for the=20

second time since I married, I have been reading _Modern Love_. And I can a=
lmost forgive the=20

Apollo of Box Hill for that betrayal which he knew nothing about.     _Thur=
sday the Twenty-Eighth_=20

This is Thursday the twenty-eighth of April. I want to be sure of that. For=
 there are very few things I=20

can be sure of now.  The bottom has fallen out of my world. I sit here, tel=
ling myself to be calm.=20

But it's not easy to sit quiet when you face the very worst that all life c=
ould confront you with. _My=20

Dinkie has run away._  My boy has left me, has left his home, has vanished =
like smoke into the=20

Unknown. He is gone and I have no trace of him.  I find it hard to write. Y=
et I _must_ write, for the=20

mere expression of what I feel tends to ease the ache. It helps to keep me =
sane. And already I=20

realize I was wrong when I wrote "the very worst that all life could confro=
nt you with." For my=20

laddie, after all, is not dead. He must still be alive. And while there's l=
ife, there's hope.  I got back=20

from Banff yesterday morning about nine, and Hilton was there with the car =
to meet me, as I had=20

told him to be. I was anxious to know at once if everything was all right, =
but I found it hard to put a=20

question so personal before that impersonal-eyed Englishman. So I strove to=
 give my interrogation=20

an air of the casual by offhandedly inquiring: "How's Rowdy, Hilton?"  "Dea=
d, ma'am," was his=20

prompt reply.  This rather took my breath away.  "Do you mean to say that R=
owdy is _dead_?" I=20

insisted, noticing Poppsy's color change as she listened.  "Killed, ma'am,"=
 said the laconic Hilton.=20

"By whom?" I demanded.  "Mr. Murchison, ma'am," was the answer.  "How?" I a=
sked, feeling my=20



vague dislike for that particular name sharpen up to something dangerously =
like hatred.  "He=20

always comes up the drive a bit fast-like, ma'am. He hit the pup, and that =
was the end of him!"=20

"Does Dinkie know?" was my first question, after that.  "He _saw_ it, ma'am=
," admitted my car-

driver.  "Saw what?"  "Saw Mr. Murchison throw the dog over the wall into t=
he brush!"  "What did=20

he say?"  "He swore a bit, ma'am, and then laughed," admitted Hilton, after=
 a pause.  "Dinkie=20

laughed?" I cried, incredulous.  "No; Mr. Murchison, ma'am," explained Hilt=
on.  "What did Dinkie=20

say?" I insisted. And again the man on the driving-seat remained silent a m=
oment or two.  "It was=20

what he _did_, ma'am," he finally remarked.  "What did he do?" I demanded. =
 "Ran into the house,=20

ma'am, and snatched the icepick off the kitchen table. Then he went to the =
big car like a mad 'un,=20

he did. Pounded holes in every blessed tire with his pick!"  "And then what=
?" I asked, with my=20

heart up in my throat.  Hilton waited until he had taken a crowded corner b=
efore answering.  "Then=20

he found the dead dog, ma'am, and bathed it, and borrowed the garden spade =
from me. Then he=20

took it somewheres back in the ravine and buried it. I gave him the tool-bo=
x off the old roadster, to=20

put what was left of the pup in."  "And then?" I prompted, with a quaver in=
 my voice I couldn't=20

control.  "He met Mr. Murchison coming out and he called him w'at I'd not l=
ike to repeat, ma'am,=20

until Mr. McKail stepped out to see what was wrong, and interfered."  "_How=
_ did he interfere?"=20

was my next question.  "By taking the lad into the house, ma'am," was my wi=
tness's retarded=20

reply.  "Then what happened?" I exacted.  I waited, knowing what was coming=
, but I dreaded to=20

hear it.  "He gave him a threshing, ma'am," I heard Hilton's voice saying, =
far away, as though it=20

came to me over a long-distance telephone on a wet night.  I sat rigid as w=
e mounted American=20

Hill. I sat rigid as we swerved in through the ridiculous manor-like gate a=
nd up the winding drive=20

and in under the ugly new porte-cochere. I didn't even wait for Poppsy as I=
 got out of the car. I=20

didn't even speak to Tokudo as he ran mincingly to take my things. I walked=
 straight to the=20

breakfast-room where I saw my husband sitting at the end of the oblong whit=
e table, stirring a cup=20

of coffee with a spoon.  "Where's Dinkie?" I asked, trying to keep my voice=
 low but not quite=20

succeeding.  Duncan looked up at me with a coldly meditative eye.  "Where h=
e usually is at this=20

time of day," he finally answered.  "Where?" I repeated.  "At school, of co=
urse," admitted my=20

husband as he reached out for a piece of buttered toast. He was making a pr=
etense at being very=20

tranquil-minded. But his hand, I noticed, wasn't so steady as it might have=
 been.  "Is he all right?" I=20

demanded, with my voice rising in spite of myself.  "Considerably better, I=
 imagine, than he has=20

been for some time," was the deliberate answer from the man with the bloods=
hot eyes at the end=20

of the table.  "What do you mean by that?" I asked. And any one of intellig=
ence, I suppose, could=20

see I was making that question a challenge.  "I mean that since you saw him=
 last he's had a=20

damned good whaling," said Duncan, with his jaw squared, so that he reminde=
d me of a King-Lud=20

bulldog.  I paid no attention to Tokudo, who came into the room to repeat t=
hat his master was=20

wanted at the telephone.  "Do you mean you struck that child?" I demanded, =
leaning on the table=20

and looking straight into his eyes, which met mine quite unabashed, and wit=
h an air of mockery=20

about them.  My husband nodded as he pushed back his chair.  "He got a good=
 one," he asserted=20

as he rose to his feet and rather leisurely brushed a crumb or two from his=
 vest-front. He could=20

even afford to smile as he said it. My expression, I suppose, would have ma=
de any man smile. But=20

there was something maddening in his mockery, at such a moment. There was s=
omething=20

gratuitously cruel in his parade of unconcern. Yet, oddly enough, as I look=
ed at his slightly=20



blotched face I couldn't help remembering that that was the face I had once=
 kissed and held close=20

against my cheek, had _wanted_ to hold against my cheek. And now I hated it=
.  I had to wait and=20

cast about for words of hatred strong enough to carry the arrows of enmity =
which nothing could=20

stop me from delivering. But while I waited Tokudo announced for the third =
time that my husband=20

was wanted at the telephone. And a very simple thing happened. My husband a=
nswered his call.  I=20

saw Duncan turn and walk out of the room. I could hear his steps in the hal=
lway, loud on the=20

waxed hardwood and low on the rugs. I could hear his deliberated chest-tone=
s as he talked over=20

the wire, talked quietly and earnestly, talked me and my hatred out of his =
head and out of his=20

world. And I realized, as I sat there at the table-end with my gloves twist=
ed up under my hands=20

and my heart even more twisted up under my ribs, that it was all useless, t=
hat it was all futile. He=20

was beyond the reach of my resentment. We were in different worlds, forever=
more.  I was still=20

sitting there when he looked in at the door, with his hat and coat on, on h=
is way out. I could feel=20

him there, without directly seeing him. And I could feel, too, that he want=
ed to say something. But I=20

declined to lift my head, and I could hear the door close as he went out to=
 the waiting car.  I sat=20

twenty, she afterwards lived for a time with her family at Bath, a great wa=
tering-place, and the=20

scene of the first part of "Northanger Abbey;" at Lyme, a pretty little sea=
-bathing place on the coast=20

of Dorset, on the "Cobb" of which takes place the catastrophe of "Persuasio=
n;" and at=20

Southampton, now a great port, then a special seat of gentility. Finally, s=
he found a second home=20

with her widowed mother and her sister at Chawton, another village in Hamps=
hire.  "In person,"=20

says Jane's biographer, "she was very attractive. Her figure was rather tal=
l and slender, her step=20

light and firm, and her whole appearance expressive of health and animation=
. In complexion, she=20

was a clear brunette, with a rich colour; she had full round cheeks, with m=
outh and nose small and=20

well formed; bright hazel eyes (it is a touch of the woman, then, when Emma=
 is described as=20

having _the true hazel eye_), and brown hair forming natural curls close ro=
und her face." The=20

sweetness and playfulness of "Dear Aunt Jane" are fresh after so many years=
 in the memories of=20

her nephew and nieces, who also strongly attest the sound sense and sterlin=
g excellence of=20

character which lay beneath. She was a special favourite with children, for=
 whom she delighted to=20

exercise her talent in improvising fairy-tales. Unknown to fame, uncaressed=
 save by family=20

affection, and, therefore, unspoilt, while writing was her delight, she kep=
t it in complete=20

subordination to the duties of life, which she performed with exemplary con=
scientiousness in the=20

house of mourning as well as in the house of feasting. Even her needlework =
was superfine. We=20

doubt not that, if the truth was known, she was a good cook.  She calls her=
self "the most=20

unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress;" but thi=
s is a nominal tribute=20

to the jealousy of female erudition which then prevailed, and at which she =
sometimes glances,=20

though herself very far from desiring a masculine education for women. In f=
act, she was well=20

versed in English literature, read French with ease, and knew something of =
Italian--German was=20

not thought of in those days. She had a sweet voice, and sang to her own ac=
companiment simple=20

old songs which still linger in her nephew's ear. Her favourite authors wer=
e Johnson, whose strong=20

sense was congenial to her, while she happily did not allow him to infect h=
er pure and easy style,=20

Cowper, Richardson and Crabbe. She said that, if she married at all, she sh=
ould like to be Mrs.=20

Crabbe. And besides Crabbe's general influence, which is obvious, we often =
see his special touch=20

in her writings:  "Emma's spirits were mounted up quite to happiness. Every=
thing wore a different=20



air. James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. When she l=
ooked at the hedges,=20

she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and, when she turne=
d round to Harriet,=20

she saw something like a look of spring--a tender smile even there."  Jane =
was supremely happy=20

in her family relations, especially in the love of her elder sister, Cassan=
dra, from whom she was=20

inseparable. Of her four brothers, two were officers in the Royal Navy. How=
 she watched their=20

career, how she welcomed them home from the perils not only of the sea but =
of war (for it was the=20

time of the great war with France), she has told us in painting the recepti=
on of William Price by his=20

sister Fanny, in "Mansfield Park." It is there that she compares conjugal a=
nd fraternal love, giving=20

the preference in one respect to the latter, because with brothers and sist=
ers "all the evil and good=20

of the earliest years can be gone over again, and every former united pain =
and pleasure retraced=20

with the fondest recollection: an advantage this, a strengthener of love, i=
n which even the conjugal=20

tie is beneath the fraternal." It was, perhaps, because she was so happy in=
 the love of her brothers=20

and sisters, as well as because she was wedded to literature, that she was =
content, in spite of her=20

good looks, to assume the symbolic cap of perpetual maidenhood at an unusua=
lly early age.  Thus=20

she grew in a spot as sunny, as sheltered, and as holy as do the violets wh=
ich her biographer tells=20

us abound beneath the south wall of Steventon church. It was impossible tha=
t she should have the=20

experiences of Miss Bronte or Madame Sand, and without some experience the =
most vivid=20

imagination cannot act, or can act only in the production of mere chimeras.=
 To forestall Miss=20

Braddon in the art of criminal phantasmagoria might have been within Jane's=
 power by the aid of=20

strong green tea, but would obviously have been repugnant to her nature. We=
 must not ask her,=20

then, for the emotions and excitements which she could not possibly afford.=
 The character of=20

Emma is called commonplace. It is commonplace in the sense in which the sam=
e term might be=20

applied to any normal beauty of nature--to a well-grown tree or to a perfec=
tly developed flower.=20

She is, as Mr. Weston says, "the picture of grown-up health." "There is hea=
lth not merely in her=20

bloom, but in her air, her gait, her glance." She has been brought up like =
Jane Austen herself, in a=20

pure English household, among loving relations and good old servants. Her f=
eet have been in the=20

path of domestic and neighbourly duty, quiet as the path which leads to the=
 village church. It has=20

been impossible for strong temptations or fierce passions to come near her.=
 Yet men accustomed=20

to the most exciting struggles, to the most powerful emotions of parliament=
ary life, have found an=20

interest, equal to the greatest ever created by a sensation novel, in the l=
ittle scrapes and=20

adventures into which her weakness betrays her, and in the process by which=
 her heart is=20

gradually drawn away from objects apparently more attractive to the robust =
nature in union with=20

which she is destined to find strength as well as happiness.  With more jus=
tice may Jane Austen=20

be reproached with having been too much influenced by the prejudices of the=
 somewhat narrow=20

and somewhat vulgarly aristocratic, or rather plutocratic, society in which=
 she lived. Her irony and=20

her complete dramatic impersonality render it difficult to see how far this=
 goes; but certainly it goes=20

further than we could wish. Decidedly she believes in gentility, and in its=
 intimate connection with=20

affluence and good family; in its incompatibility with any but certain very=
 refined and privileged=20

kinds of labour; in the impossibility of finding a gentleman in a trader, m=
uch more in a yeoman or=20

mechanic. "The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel =
I can have nothing to=20

do; a degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance, might interest me; =
I might hope to be=20

useful to their families in some way or other; but a farmer can need none o=
f my help, and is,=20



therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is be=
low it." This is said by=20

Emma--by Emma when she is trying to deter her friend from marrying a yeoman=
, it is true, but still=20

by Emma. The picture of the coarseness of poverty in the household of Fanny=
's parents in=20

"Mansfield Park" is truth, but it is hard truth, and needs some counterpois=
e. Both in the case of=20

Fanny Price and in that of Frank Churchill, the entire separation of a chil=
d from its own home for=20

the sake of the worldly advantages furnished by an adoptive home of a super=
ior class, is=20

presented too much as a part of the order of nature. The charge of acquiesc=
ence in the low=20

standard of clerical duty prevalent in the Establishment of that day is wel=
l founded, though perhaps=20

not of much importance. Of more importance is the charge which might be mad=
e, with equal=20

justice, of acquiescence in somewhat low and coarse ideas of the relations =
between the sexes,=20

and of the destinies and proper aspirations of young women. "Mr. Collins, t=
o be sure, was neither=20

sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her =
must be imaginary; but=20

still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or mat=
rimony, marriage had=20

always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educa=
ted young women of=20

small fortune; and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pl=
easantest preservative=20

from want. This preservative she had now attained; and at the age of twenty=
-seven, without having=20

ever been handsome, she felt all the good-luck of it." This reflection is a=
scribed to Charlotte Lucas,=20

an inferior character, but still thought worthy to be the heroine's bosom f=
riend.  Jane's first essays=20

in composition were burlesques on the fashionable manners of the day; whenc=
e grew "Northanger=20

Abbey," with its anti- heroine, Catharine Morley, "roving and wild, hating =
constraint and=20

cleanliness, and loving nothing so much as rolling down the green slope at =
the back of the house,"=20

and with its exquisite travestie of the "Mysteries of Udolpho." But she soo=
n felt her higher power.=20

Marvellous to say, she began "Pride and Prejudice" in 1796, before she was =
twenty- one years=20

old, and completed it in the following year. "Sense and Sensibility" and "N=
orthanger Abbey"=20

immediately followed; it appears, with regard to the latter, that she had a=
lready visited Bath,=20

though it was not till afterwards that she resided there. But she published=
 nothing--not only so, but=20

it seems that she entirely suspended composition--till 1809, when her famil=
y settled at Chawton.=20

Here she revised for the press what she had written, and wrote "Mansfield P=
ark," "Emma" and=20

"Persuasion." "Persuasion," whatever her nephew and biographer may say, and=
 however Dr.=20

Whewell may have fired up at the suggestion, betrays an enfeeblement of her=
 faculties, and tells=20

of approaching death. But we still see in it the genuine creative power mul=
tiplying new characters;=20

whereas novelists who are not creative, when they have exhausted their orig=
inal fund of=20

observations, are forced to subsist by exaggeration of their old characters=
, by aggravated=20

extravagances of plot, by multiplied adulteries and increased carnage.  "Pr=
ide and Prejudice,"=20

when first offered to Cadell, was declined by return of post. The fate of "=
Northanger Abbey" was=20

still more ignominious: it was sold for ten pounds to a Bath publisher, who=
, after keeping it many=20

years in his drawer, was very glad to return it and get back his ten pounds=
. No burst of applause=20

greeted the works of Jane Austen like that which greeted the far inferior w=
orks of Miss Burney.=20

_Crevit occulto velut arbor oevo fama_. A few years ago, the verger of Winc=
hester cathedral=20

asked a visitor who desired to be shown her tomb, "what there was so partic=
ular about that lady=20

that so many people wanted to see where she was buried?" Nevertheless, she =
lived to feel that=20

"her own dear children" were appreciated, if not by the vergers, yet in the=
 right quarters, and to=20



enjoy a quiet pleasure in the consciousness of her success. One tribute she=
 received which was=20

overwhelming. It was intimated to her by authority that His Royal Highness,=
 the Prince Regent,=20

had read her novels with pleasure, and that she was at liberty to dedicate =
the next to him. More=20

than this, the Royal Librarian, Mr. Clarke, of his own motion apparently, d=
id her the honour to=20

suggest that, changing her style for a higher, she should write "a historic=
al romance in illustration=20

of the august house of Cobourg," and dedicate it to Prince Leopold. She ans=
wered in effect that, if=20

her life depended on it, she could not be serious for a whole chapter. Let =
it be said, however, for=20

the Prince Regent, that underneath his royalty and his sybaritism, there wa=
s, at first, something of=20

a better and higher nature, which at last was entirely stifled by them. His=
 love for Mrs. Fitzherbert=20

was not merely sensual, and Heliogabalus would not have been amused by the =
novels of Miss=20

Austen.  Jane was never the authoress but when she was writing her novels; =
and in the few letters=20

with which this memoir is enriched there is nothing of point or literary ef=
fort, and very little of=20

special interest. We find, however, some pleasant and characteristic touche=
s.  "Charles has=20

received L30 for his share of the privateer, and expects L10 more; but of w=
hat avail is it to take=20

prizes if he lays out the produce in presents to his sisters? He has been b=
uying gold chains and=20

topaz crosses for us. He must be well scolded."  "Poor Mrs. Stent! It has b=
een her lot to be always=20

in the way; but we must be merciful, for perhaps in time we may come to be =
Mrs. Stents ourselves,=20

unequal to anything and unwelcome to everybody."  "We (herself and Miss A.)=
 afterwards walked=20

together for an hour on the Cobb; she is very conversable in a common way; =
I do not perceive wit=20

or genius, but she has sense and some degree of taste, and her manners are =
very engaging.=20

_She seems to like people rather too easily."_  Of her own works, or rather=
 of the characters of her=20

own creation, her Elizabeths and Emmas, Jane speaks literally as a parent. =
They are her "dear=20

children." "I must confess that I think her (Elizabeth) as delightful a cre=
ature as ever appeared in=20

print, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like _her_ at l=
east I do not know." This is=20

said in pure playfulness; there is nothing in the letters like real egotism=
 or impatience of censure.=20

At the age of forty-two, in the prime of intellectual life, with "Emma" jus=
t out and "Northanger=20

Abbey" coming, and in the midst of domestic affection and happiness, life m=
ust have been sweet=20

to Jane Austen. She resigned it, nevertheless, with touching tranquillity a=
nd meekness. In 1816, it=20

appears, she felt her inward malady, and began to go round her old haunts i=
n a manner which=20

seemed to indicate that she was bidding them farewell. In the next year, sh=
e was brought for=20

medical advice to a house in the Close of Winchester, and there, surrounded=
 to the last by=20

affection and to the last ardently returning it, she died. Her last words w=
ere her answer to the=20

question whether there was anything she wanted--_"Nothing but death."_ Thos=
e who expect=20

religious language in season and out of season have inferred from the absen=
ce of it in Jane=20

Austen's novels that she was indifferent to religion. The testimony of her =
nephew is positive to the=20

contrary; and he is a man whose word may be believed.  Those who died in th=
e Close were buried=20

in the cathedral. It is therefore by mere accident that Jane Austen rests a=
mong princes and=20

princely prelates in that glorious and historic fane. But she deserves at l=
east her slab of black=20

marble in the pavement there. She possessed a real and rare gift, and she r=
endered a good=20

account of it. If the censer which she held among the priests of art was no=
t of the costliest, the=20

incense was of the purest. If she cannot be ranked with the very greatest m=
asters of fiction, she=20

has delighted many, and none can draw from her any but innocent delight.   =

MILTON  [Footnote: "English Men of Letters. Edited by John Morley Milton. B=
y Mark Pattison B.D.,=20

Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford." London, Macmillan, New York: Harper & B=
ros., 1879]   John=20

Bright once asked a friend who was the greatest of Englishmen and the frien=
d hesitating answered=20

his own question by saying, "Milton, because he above all others, combined =
the greatness of the=20

writer with the greatness of the citizen." Professor Masson in his Life and=
 Times of Milton, has=20

embodied the conception of the character indicated by this remark, but he h=
as run into the=20

extreme of incorporating a complete narrative of the Revolution with the bi=
ography of Milton, so=20

that the historical portion of the work overlays instead of illuminating th=
e biographical, and the=20

chapters devoted specially to the life seem to the reader interpolations, a=
nd not always welcome=20

interpolations, in an intensely interesting history of the times. But now c=
omes a biographer in=20

whose eyes the life of Milton the citizen is a mere episode, and not only a=
 mere episode but a=20

lamentable and humiliating episode, in the life of Milton the poet. Milton'=
s life, says Mr. Pattison "is=20

a drama in three acts. The first discovers him in the calm and peaceful ret=
irement of Horton, of=20

which 'L'Allegro,' 'Il Penseroso,' and 'Lycidas' are the expression. In the=
 second act he is breathing=20

the foul and heated atmosphere of party passion and religious hate, generat=
ing the lurid fires=20

which glare in the battailous canticles of his prose pamphlets. The three g=
reat poems--'Paradise=20

Lost,' 'Paradise Regained,' and 'Samson Agonistes'--are the utterance of hi=
s final period of solitary=20

and Promethean grandeur, when, blind, destitute, friendless, he testified o=
f righteousness,=20

temperance, and judgment to come, alone before a fallen world." As to the s=
truggle to which=20

Milton, with Cromwell, Vane Pym, Hampden, Selden, and Chillingworth, gave h=
is life, it is in the=20

eyes of his present biographer, an ignoble "fray," a "biblical brawl," and =
its fruits in the way of=20

theological discussion are nothing but "garbage." To write his Defence of t=
he English People=20

Milton deliberately sacrificed his eyesight, his doctor having warned him t=
hat he would lose his one=20

remaining eye if he persisted in using it for book work. "The choice lay be=
fore me," he says,=20

"between dereliction of a supreme duty and loss of eyesight. In such a case=
 I could not listen to=20

the physician, not if AEsculapius himself had spoken from his sanctuary; I =
could not but obey that=20

inward monitor, I know not what, that spoke to me from Heaven. I considered=
 with myself that=20

many had purchased less good with worse ill, as they who gave their lives t=
o reap only glory, and I=20

thereupon concluded to employ the little remaining eyesight I was to enjoy =
in doing this, the=20

greatest service to the common weal it was in my power to render." Mr. Patt=
ison has quoted this=20

passage, and no doubt he silently appreciates the heroism which breathes th=
rough it; but the=20

"supreme duty" of which it speaks appears to him only a "prostitution of fa=
culties" and a "poor=20

delusion." Milton, he thinks, ought to have kept entirely aloof from the br=
awl and remained quiet=20

either in the intellectual circles of Italy or in the delicious seclusion o=
f his library at Horton, leaving=20

liberty, truth, and righteousness to drown or to be saved from drowning by =
other hands than his. In=20

"plunging into the fray" the poet miserably derogated from his superior pos=
ition as a literary man,=20

and the result was a dead loss to him and to the world. We are sure that we=
 do not state Mr.=20

Pattison's view more strongly than it is stated in his own pages.  The view=
s of all of us, including=20

Professor Masson, on such a question are sure to be more or less idiosyncra=
tic, and those of the=20

present biographer have not escaped the general liability. They seem, at le=
ast, aptly to represent a=20

mood prevalent just now among eminent men of the literary class in England,=
 particularly at the=20

universities. These men have been tossed on the waves of Ritualism, tossed =
on the waves of the=20



reaction from Ritualism; some of them have been personally battered in both=
 controversies; they=20

have attained no certainty, but rather arrived at the conclusion that no ce=
rtainty is attainable; they=20

are weary and disgusted; such of them as have been enthusiasts in politics =
have been stripped of=20

their illusions in that line also, and have fallen back on the conviction t=
hat everything must be left=20

to evolve itself, and that there is nothing to be done. They have withdrawn=
 into the sanctuary of=20

critical learning and serene art, abjuring all theology and politics, and, =
above all, abjuring=20

controversy of all kinds as utterly vulgar and degrading, though, as might =
be expected, they are=20

sometimes controversial and even rather tart in an indirect way, and withou=
t being conscious of it=20

themselves. Mr. Pattison's air when he comes into contact with the politics=
 or theology of Milton's=20

days is like that of a very seasick passenger at the sight of a pork chop. =
Nor does he fail to reflect=20

the Necessarianism of the circle. "That in selecting a scriptural subject,"=
 he says, "Milton was not,=20

in fact, exercising any choice, but was determined by his circumstances, is=
 only what must be said=20

of all choosing." Criticism fastidiously erudite, a study of art religiousl=
y and almost mystically=20

profound, are fruits of this intellectual seclusion of chosen spirits from =
the coarse and ruffling world=20

for which that world has reason to be grateful. It is not likely Milton wou=
ld have chosen a writer of=20

this school as his biographer, but few men would choose their own biographe=
rs well.  Milton has at=20

all events found in Mr. Pattison a biographer whose narrative is throughout=
 extremely pleasant,=20

interesting and piquant, the piquancy being enhanced for those who have the=
 key to certain sly=20

hits, such as that at "the peculiar form of credulity which makes perverts =
(to Roman Catholicism)=20

think that everyone is about to follow their example," which carries us bac=
k to the time when the=20

head of Tractarianism having gone over to Rome, was waiting anxiously, but =
in vain, for the tail to=20

join it. The facts had already been collected by the diligence of Professor=
 Masson, but Mr. Pattison=20

uses them in a style which places beyond a doubt his own familiarity with t=
he subject. Through the=20

moral judgments there runs, as we think, and as we should have expected, a =
somewhat lofty=20

conception of the privileges of intellect and of the value of literary obje=
cts compared with others,=20

but with this qualification the reflections will probably be deemed sensibl=
e and sound. The=20

unfortunate relations between Milton and his first wife are treated as we t=
hink all readers will say,=20

at once with delicacy and justice. The literary criticisms are of a high or=
der and such as only=20

comprehensive learning combined with trained taste could produce, whether y=
ou entirely enter into=20

all of them or not (and criticism has not yet been reduced to a certain rul=
e) you cannot fail to gain=20

from them increase of insight and enjoyment. They are often expressed in la=
nguage of great=20

beauty:  "The rapid purification of Milton's taste will be best perceived b=
y comparing 'L'Allegro' and=20

'Il Penseroso' of uncertain date but written after 1632 with the 'Ode on th=
e Nativity,' written 1629.=20

The Ode, notwithstanding its foretaste of Milton's grandeur, abounds in fri=
gid conceits, from which=20

the two later pieces are free. The Ode is frosty, as written in winter with=
in the four walls of a=20

college-chamber. The two idyls breathe the free air of spring and summer an=
d of the fields around=20

Horton. They are thoroughly naturalistic; the choicest expression our langu=
age has yet found of=20

the first charm of country life, not as that life is lived by the peasant, =
but as it is felt by a young and=20

lettered student, issuing at early dawn or at sunset into the fields from h=
is chamber and his books.=20

All rural sights and sounds and smells are here blended in that ineffable c=
ombination which once=20

or twice perhaps in our lives has saluted our young senses, before their pe=
rceptions were blunted=20

by alcohol, by lust or ambition, or diluted by the social distractions of g=
reat cities."  This will not be=20



found to be a _purpureus pannus_. Nor does it much detract from the grace o=
f the work that of the=20

"asyntactic disorder" of which Mr. Pattison accuses Milton's prose, some ex=
amples may be found=20

in his own. Grammatical irregularities in a really good writer, as Mr. Patt=
ison undoubtedly is, often=20

prove merely that his mind is more intent on the matter than on the form.  =
"Paradise Lost" is the=20

subject of a learned, luminous, and to us very instructive dissertation. It=
 is truly said that of the=20

adverse criticism which we meet with on the poem "much resolves itself into=
 a refusal on the part=20

of the critic to make that initial abandonment to the conditions which the =
poet demands: a=20

determination to insist that his heaven, peopled with deities, dominations,=
 principalities, and=20

powers, shall have the same material laws which govern our planetary system=
." There is one=20

criticism, however, which cannot be so resolved, and on which, as it appear=
s to us the most=20

serious of all, we should have liked very much to hear Mr. Pattison. It is =
said that Lord Thurlow and=20

another lawyer were crossing Hounslow Heath in a post-chaise when a tremend=
ous thunder-storm=20

came on; that the other lawyer said that it reminded him of the battle in "=
Paradise Lost" between=20

the devil and the angels, and that Thurlow roared, with a blasphemous oath,=
 "Yes, and I wish the=20

devil had won." Persons desirous of sustaining the religious reputation of =
the legal profession add=20

that his companion jumped out of the chaise in the rain and ran away over t=
he heath. For our part,=20

we have never found nearly so much difficulty in any of the incongruities c=
onnected with the=20

relations between spirit and matter, or in any confusion of the Copernican =
with the Ptolemaic=20

system, as in the constant wrenching of our moral sympathies, which the poe=
t demands for the=20

Powers of Good, but which his own delineation of Satan, as a hero waging a =
Promethean war=20

against Omnipotence, compels us to give to the Powers of Evil. Perhaps a wo=
rd or two might have=20

been said about the relations of "Paradise Lost" to other "epics." It manif=
estly belongs not to the=20

same class of poems as the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey," or even the "AEneid."=
 Dobson's Latin=20

translation of it is about the greatest feat ever performed in modern Latin=
 verse, and it shows by a=20

crucial experiment how little Milton really has in common with Virgil. "Par=
adise Lost" seems to us=20

far more akin to the Greek tragedy than to the Homeric poems or the "AEneid=
." In the form of a=20

Greek drama it was first conceived. Its verse is the counterpart of the Gre=
ek iambic, not of the=20

Greek or Latin hexameter. Had the laborious Dobson turned it into Greek iam=
bics instead of=20

turning it into Latin hexameters, we suspect the real affinity would have a=
ppeared.  Looking upon=20

the life of Milton the politician merely as a sad and ignominious=20


_
surrendered to the impulse to telephone to Lossie Brown. But I knew it woul=
d be no easy matter to=20

get in touch with her. And in two hours it would be twelve, and any minute =
after that my boy would=20

be home again. I tried to cross-examine Tokudo, but I could get nothing out=
 of that tight-lipped=20

Jap. I watched the clock. I noticed Hilton, when he got back, raking blood-=
stains off the gravel of=20

the driveway. I wandered about, like a lost turkey-hen, trying to dramatize=
 my meeting with Dinkie,=20

doing my best to cooper together some incident which might keep our first m=
inute or two together=20

from being too hard on my poor kiddie. I heard the twelve o'clock whistles,=
 at last, and then the=20

Westminster-chimes of the over-ornate clock in the library announce that no=
on had come. And still=20

the minutes dragged on.  And when the tension was becoming almost unbearabl=
e I heard a step=20

on the gravel and my heart started to pound.  But instead of Dinkie, it was=
 Lossie, Lossie with=20

smiling lips and inquiring brown eyes and splashes of rose in her cheeks fr=
om rapid walking.=20

"Where's Dinkie?" I asked.  She stopped short, still smiling.  "That's exac=
tly what I was going to=20

ask?" I heard her saying. Then her smile faded as she searched my face. "Th=
ere's--there's nothing=20

happened, has there?"  I groped my way to a pillar of the porte-cochere and=
 leaned against it.=20

"Didn't Dinkie come to school this morning?" I asked as the earth wavered u=
nder my feet.  "No,"=20

acknowledged Lossie, still searching my face. And a frown of perplexity cam=
e into her own.  I=20

knew then what had happened. I knew it even before I went up to Dinkie's ro=
om and started my=20

frantic search through his things. I could see that a number of his more tr=
easured small=20

possessions were gone. I delved forlornly about, hoping that he might have =
left some hidden=20

message for me. But I could find nothing. I sat looking at his books and br=
oken toys, at the still=20

open copy of _The Count of Monte Cristo_ which he must have been poring ove=
r only the night=20

before, at his neatly folded underclothes and the little row of gravel-worn=
 shoes. They took on an=20

air of pathos, an atmosphere of the memorial. Yet, oddly enough, it was Los=
sie, and Lossie alone,=20

who broke into tears. The more she cried, in fact, the calmer I found mysel=
f becoming, though all=20

the while that dead weight of misery was hanging like lead from my heart.  =
I went at once to the=20

telephone and called up Duncan's office. He was still there, though I had t=
o wait several minutes=20

before I could get in touch with him.  I had thought, at first, that he wou=
ld be offhandedly skeptical=20

at the message which I was sending him over the wire, the message that my b=
oy had run away.=20

He might even be flippantly indifferent, and remind me that much worse thin=
gs could have=20

happened.  But I knew at once that he was genuinely alarmed at the news whi=
ch I'd given him. It=20

apparently staggered him for a moment. Then he said in his curt telephonic =
chest-tones, "I'll be up=20

at the house, at once."  He came, before I'd even completed a second and mo=
re careful search.=20

His face was cold and non-committal enough, but his color was gone and ther=
e was a look that=20

was almost one of contrition in his troubled eyes, which seemed unwilling t=
o meet mine. He=20

questioned Lossie and cross-examined Hilton and Tokudo, and then called up =
the Chief of Police.=20

Then he telephoned to the different railway stations, and carried Lossie of=
f in the car to the=20

McArthurs', to interview Benny, and came back an hour later with that vague=
 look of frustration still=20

on his face.  He sat down to luncheon, but he ate very little. He was silen=
t for quite a long time.=20

"Your boy's all right," he said in a much softer voice than I had expected =
from him. "He's big=20

enough to look after himself. And we'll be on his trail before nightfall. H=
e can't go far."  "No; he=20

can't go far," I echoed, trying to fortify myself with the knowledge that h=
e must have taken little=20

more than a dollar from the gilded cast-iron elephant which he used as a ba=
nk.  "I don't want this=20



to get in the papers," explained my husband. "It's--it's all so ridiculous.=
 I've put Kearney and two of=20

his men on the job. He's a private detective, and he'll keep busy until he =
gets the boy back."=20

Duncan got up from the table, rather heavily. He stood hesitating a moment =
and then stepped=20

closer to my chair.  "I know it's hard," he said as he put a hand on my sho=
ulder. "But it'll be all=20

right. We'll get your boy back for you."  I didn't speak, because I knew th=
at if I spoke I'd break=20

down and make an idiot of myself. My husband waited, apparently expecting m=
e to say something.=20

Then he took his hand away.  "I'll get busy with the car," he said with a f=
orced matter-of-factness,=20

"and let you know when there's any news. I've wired Buckhorn and sent word =
to Casa Grande--

and we ought to get some news from there."  But there was no news. cannot b=
e expected to=20

entertain the idea that the poem is in any sense the work of the politician=
. Yet we cannot help=20

thinking that the tension and elevation which Milton's nature had undergone=
 in the mighty struggle,=20

together with the heroic dedication of his faculties to the most serious ob=
jects, must have had not=20

a little to do both with the final choice of his subject and with the tone =
of his poem. "The great=20

Puritan epic" could hardly have been written by any one but a militant Puri=
tan. Had Milton abjured=20

the service of his cause, as his biographer would have had him do, he might=
 have given us an=20

Arthurian romance or some other poem of amusement. We even think it not imp=
ossible that he=20

might have never produced a great poem at all, but have let life slip away =
in elaborate preparation=20

without being able to fix upon a theme or brace himself to the effort of co=
mposition. If Milton's=20

participation in a political battle fought to save at once the political an=
d spiritual life of England was=20

degrading, Dante's participation in the faction fight between the Guelphs a=
nd Ghibellines must=20

have been still more so; yet if Dante had been a mere man of leisure would =
he have written the=20

"Divina Commedia"? Who are these sublime artists in poetry that are pinnacl=
ed so high above the=20

"frays" and "brawls" of vulgar humanity? The best of them, we suppose (writ=
ers for the stage being=20

out of the question) is Goethe. Shelley, Wordsworth, and Byron were all dis=
tinctly poets of the=20

Revolution, or of the Counter-Revolution, and if you could remove from them=
 the political element,=20

you would rob them of half their force and interest. The great growths of p=
oetry have coincided=20

with the great bursts of national life, and the great bursts of national li=
fe have hitherto been=20

generally periods of controversy and struggle.  Art itself, in its highest =
forms, has been the=20

expression of faith. We have now people who profess to cultivate art as art=
 for its own sake; but=20

they have hardly produced anything which the world accepts as great, though=
 they have supplied=20

some subjects for _Punch_. "He that loseth his life shall preserve it." Mil=
ton was ready to lose his=20

literary life by sacrificing the remains of his eyesight to a cause which, =
upon the whole, humanity=20

has accepted as its own; and it was preserved to him in a work which will n=
ever die. Mr. Pattison=20

points to a short poem written by Milton when his pen was chiefly employed =
in serving the=20

Commonwealth as indication that Milton "did not inwardly forfeit the peace =
which passeth all=20

understanding." Why should a man forfeit that peace when he is doing with h=
is whole soul that=20

which he conscientiously believes to be his highest duty?  Over Milton's pa=
mphlets Mr. Pattison=20

can of course only wring his hands. He is at liberty to wring his hands as =
much as he pleases over=20

the personalities which sullied the controversy with Salmasius; but these a=
re a small part of the=20

matter, particularly when they are viewed in connection with the habits of =
a time which was at once=20

much rougher in phrase, though perhaps not more malicious, than ours, and g=
iven to servile=20

imitation of Greek and Latin oratory. To point his moral more keenly, Mr. P=
attison denies that=20



Milton was ever effective as a political writer. Yet the Council of State, =
who can have looked to=20

nothing but effectiveness, and were pretty good judges of it, specially inv=
ited Milton to answer=20

"Eikon Basilike" and to plead the cause of the Regicide Republic against Sa=
lmasius in the court of=20

European opinion. Mr. Pattison himself (p. 135) allows that on the Continen=
t Milton was renowned=20

as the answerer of Salmasius and the vindicator of liberty; and he proceeds=
 to quote the statement=20

of Milton's nephew that learned foreigners could not leave London without s=
eeing his uncle. But=20

the biographer has evidently laid down beforehand in his own mind general l=
aws which are fatal to=20

all pamphlets as pamphlets, without consideration of their particular merit=
s. "There are," he says,=20

"examples of thought having been influenced by books. But such books have b=
een scientific, not=20

rhetorical." If it were not rude to contradict, we should have said that th=
e influence exercised in=20

politics by scientific treatises had been as nothing in the aggregate compa=
red with that exercised=20

by pamphlets, speeches, and, in later times, by the newspaper press. What d=
oes Mr. Pattison say=20

to Burke's "Reflections on the French Revolution," to Paine's "Common Sense=
," to the tracts=20

written by Halifax and Defoe at the time of the Revolution? Neither thought=
 nor action is his=20

epigrammatic condemnation of Milton's political writings, but an appeal whi=
ch stirs men to action is=20

surely both. Again of "Eikonoklastes" we are told that "it is like _all ans=
wers_, worthless as a=20

book." Bentley's "Phalaris" is an answer, Demosthenes' "De Corona" is an an=
swer. As a rule no=20

doubt the form is a bad=20


_
like a tomb. And at five o'clock I did what I had wanted to do for six long=
 hours. I sent off a forty-

seven word telegram to Peter Ketley, telling him what had happened....  Dun=
can came back, at=20

seven o'clock, to get one of the new photographs of Dinkie and Lossie for i=
dentification purposes.=20

They had rounded up a small boy at Morley and Kearney was motoring out to i=
nvestigate. We'd=20

know by midnight....  It is well after midnight, and Duncan has just had a =
phone-message from=20

Morley. The little chap they had rounded up was a Barnado boy fired with a =
sudden ambition to=20

join his uncle in the gold-fields of Australia. Somewhere, in the blackness=
 of this big night, my=20

homeless Dinkie is wandering unguarded and alone.     _Friday the Twenty-Ni=
nth_   I have had no=20

word from Peter.... I've had no news to end the ache that pins me like a sp=
ear-head to the wall of=20

hopelessness. Duncan, I know, is doing all he can. But there is so little t=
o do. And this world of=20

ours, after all, is such a terrifyingly big one.     _Saturday the Thirtiet=
h_   I was called to the phone=20

before breakfast this morning and it was the blessed voice of Peter I heard=
 from the other end of=20

the wire. My telegram had got out to him from Buckhorn a day late. But he h=
ad no definite news for=20

me. He was quite fixed in his belief, however, that Dinkie would be bobbing=
 up at his old home in a=20

day or two.  "The boy will travel this way," he assured me. "He's bound to =
do that. It's as natural as=20

water running down-hill!"  Duncan asked me whom I'd been talking to, and I =
had to tell him. His=20

face clouded and the familiar quick look of resentment came into his eyes. =
 "I can't see what that=20

Quaker's got to do with this question," he barked out. But I held my peace.=
     _Sunday the First_=20

I have found a message from my Dinkie. I came across it this morning, by ac=
cident. It was in my=20

sewing-basket, the basket made of birch-bark and stained porcupine quills a=
nd lined with doe-skin,=20

which I'd once bought from a Reservation squaw in Buckhorn with a tiny papo=
ose on her back.=20

Duncan had upbraided me for passing out my last five-dollar bill to that hu=
ngry Nitchie, but the=20

poor woman needed it.  My fingers were shaking as I unfolded the note. And =
written there in the=20

script I knew so well I read:    "Darligest Mummsey:    I am going away. Bu=
t dont worry about me=20

for I will be alright. I   couldn't stay Mummsey after what hapened. Some d=
ay I will come   back to=20

you. But I'm not as bad as all that. I'll love you always   as much as ever=
. I can take care for myself=20

so don't worry,   please. And please feed my two rabits reglar and tell Ben=
ny I'll   save his jacknife=20

and rember every day I'm rembering you. X X X X   X X X    Your aff'cte son=
,=20

DINKIE."  It seemed like a voice from the dead, it was bittersweet consolat=
ion, and, in a way, it=20

stood redemption of Dinkie himself. I'd been upbraiding him, in my secret h=
eart of hearts, for his=20

silence to his mother. That's a streak of his father in him, had been my fi=
rst thought, that=20

unthinking cruelty which didn't take count of the anguish of others. But he=
 hadn't forgotten me.=20

Whatever happens, I have at least this assuaging secret message from my son=
. And some day=20

he'll come back to me. "Ye winna leave me for a', laddie?" I keep saying, i=
n the language of old=20

Whinstane Sandy. And my mind goes back, almost six years at a bound, to the=
 time he was lost=20

on the prairie. That time, I tell myself, God was good to me. And surely He=
 will be good to me=20

again!     _Tuesday the Third_   We still have no single word of our laddie=
.... They all tell me not to=20

worry. But how can a mother keep from worrying? I had rather an awful night=
mare last night,=20

dreaming that Dinkie was trying to climb the stone wall about our place. He=
 kept falling back with=20

bleeding fingers, and he kept calling and calling for his mother. Without b=
eing quite awake I went=20

down to the door in my night-gown, and opened it, and called out into the d=
arkness: "Is anybody=20

there? Is it you, Dinkie?"  My husband came down and led me back to bed, wi=
th rather a=20



frightened look on his face.  They tell me not to worry, but I've been up i=
n Dinkie's room turning=20

over his things and wondering if he's dead, or if he's fallen into the hand=
s of cruel people who=20

would ill-use a child. Or perhaps he has been stolen by Indians, and will c=
ome back to me with a=20

morose and sullen mind, and with scars on his body....     _Thursday the Fi=
fth_   What a terrible=20

thing is loneliness. The floors of Hell, I'm sure, are paved with lonesome =
hearts. Day by day I wait=20

and long for my laddie. Always, at the back of my brain, is that big want. =
Day by day I brood about=20

him and night by night I dream of him. I turn over his old playthings and h=
is books, and my throat=20

gets tight. I stare at the faded old snap-shots of him, and my heart turns =
to lead. I imagine I hear=20

his voice, just outside the door, or just beyond a bend in the road, and a =
two-bladed sword of pain=20

pushes slowly through my breast-bone. Dear old Lossie comes twice a day, an=
d does her best to=20

cheer me up. And Gershom has offered to give up his school and join in the =
search. Peter Ketley,=20

he tells me, has been on the road for a week, in a car covered with mud and=
 clothes that have=20

never come off.     _Friday the Sixth_   There is no news of my Dinkie. And=
 _that_, I remind myself,=20

is the only matter that counts.  Lois Murchison drove up to-day in her hate=
ful big car. She did not=20

find me a very agreeable hostess, I'm afraid, but curled up like a nonchala=
nt green snake in one of=20

my armchairs and started to smoke and talk. She asked where Duncan was and =
I had to explain=20

that he'd been called out to the mines on imperative business. And that sta=
rted her going on the=20

mines. Duncan, she said, should clean up half a million before he was throu=
gh with that deal. He=20

had been very successful.  "But don't you feel, my dear," she went on with =
quiet venom in her=20

voice, "that a great deal of his success has depended on that bandy-legged =
little she-secretary of=20

his?"  "Is she that wonderful?" I asked, trying to seem less at sea than I =
was.  "She's certainly=20

wonderful to him!" announced the woman known as Slinkie. And having driven =
that poisoned dart=20

well into the flesh, she was content to drop her cigarette-end into the ash=
-receiver, reach for her=20

blue-fox furs, and announce that she'd have to be toddling on to the hair-d=
resser's.  Lois=20

Murchison's implication, at that moment, didn't bother me much, for I had b=
igger troubles to=20

occupy my thoughts. But the more I dwell on it, the more I find myself dist=
urbed in spirit. I resent=20

the idea of being upset by a wicked-tongued woman. She has, however, raised=
 a ghost which will=20

have to be laid. To-morrow I intend to go down to my husband's office and s=
ee his secretary, "to=20

an answer may embody principles and knowledge as well as show literary skil=
l, reasoning power,=20

and courteous self-control, which after all are not worthless though they a=
re worth far less than=20

some other things. These discussions so odious and contemptible in Mr. Patt=
ison's eyes, what are=20

they but the processes of thought through which a nation or humanity works =
its way to political=20

truth? Even books scientific in form such as Hobbes's "Leviathan" or Harrin=
gton's "Oceana" are=20

but registered results of a long discussion. "Eikon Basilike" was doing inf=
inite mischief to the cause=20

of the Commonwealth, and how could it have been met except by a critical re=
ply? "Eikonoklastes"=20

was thought, though it was not exact science, and so far as it told it was =
action, though it was not a=20

pike or a musket.  This portion of Mr. Pattison's work is thickly sown with=
 aphorisms to which no=20

one who does not share his special mood can without qualification assent. N=
o good man can with=20

impunity addict himself to party, and the best men will suffer most because=
 their conviction of the=20

goodness of their cause is deeper. But when one with the sensibility of a p=
oet throws himself into=20

the excitements of a struggle he is certain to lose his balance. The endowm=
ent of feeling and=20

imagination which qualifies him to be the ideal interpreter of life unfits =
him for participation in that=20



real life through the manoeuvres and compromises of which reason is the onl=
y guide and where=20

imagination is as much misplaced as it would be in a game of chess. In this=
 there is an element of=20

truth but there is also something to which we are inclined to demur. If by =
party is meant mere=20

faction, plainly no man can addict himself to it with impunity. But when th=
e English nation was=20

struggling in the grasp of a court and a prelacy which sought to reduce it =
to the level of Spain, no=20

Englishman as it seems to us could with impunity perch himself aloft in a p=
alace of art while=20

peasants were shedding their blood to make him free. Especially do we quest=
ion the soundness of=20

the sentiment expressed in the last clause. Why is real life to be abandone=
d by every man of=20

feeling and imagination and given over to the men of manoeuvre and compromi=
se? Is not this the=20

sentiment of the monkish ascetic coming back to us in another form and enjo=
ining us to make=20

ourselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Art's sake? Cromwell, Vane, Hampden, a=
nd Pym were not=20

men of manoeuvre and compromise, they had plenty of feeling and imagination=
, though in them=20

these qualities gave birth not to poetry, but to high political or religiou=
s aspirations and grand=20

social ideals. The theory of Milton's biographer is that an active interest=
 in public affairs is fatal to=20

excellence in literature or in art; and this theory seems to be confuted as=
 signally as possible by=20

the facts of Milton's life.  It is curious to see how completely at varianc=
e Milton's own sentiment is=20

with that of his biographer and how little he foresaw what Mr. Pattison wou=
ld say about him. In the=20

_Defensio Secunda_ he defends himself against the charge not of over activi=
ty but of inaction. "I=20

can easily repel," he says, "any imputation of want of courage or of want o=
f zeal. For though I did=20

not share the toils or perils of the war I was engaged in a service not les=
s hazardous to myself and=20

more beneficial to my fellow citizens; nor in the adverse turns of our affa=
irs, did I ever betray any=20

symptoms of pusillanimity and dejection; or show myself more afraid than be=
came me of malice or=20

of death: For since from my youth I was devoted to the pursuits of literatu=
re, and my mind has=20

always been stronger than my body, I did not court the labours of a camp, i=
n which any common=20

person would have been of more service than myself, but resorted to that em=
ployment in which my=20

exertions were likely to be of most avail. Thus, with the better part of my=
 frame I contributed as=20

much as possible to the good of my country, and to the success of the glori=
ous cause in which we=20

were engaged; and I thought that if God willed the success of such glorious=
 achievements, it was=20

equally agreeable to his will that there should be others by whom those ach=
ievements should be=20

recorded with dignity and elegance; and that the truth, which had been defe=
nded by arms, should=20

also be defended by reason; which is the best and only legitimate means of =
defending it. Hence,=20

while I applaud those who were victorious in the field, I will not complain=
 of the province which was=20

assigned me; but rather congratulate myself upon it, and thank the author o=
f all good for having=20

placed me in a station, which may be an object of envy to others rather tha=
n of regret to myself."=20

Here is a culprit who entirely mistakes the nature of his offence and inste=
ad of apologizing for what=20

he has done apologizes for not having done more. Nor so far as we are aware=
 is there in Milton's=20

writings the slightest trace of sorrow for the misemployment of his best ye=
ars or consciousness of=20

the ruin which it had wrought in his genius as a poet.  In the same spirit =
Mr. Pattison continually=20

represents the end of Milton's public life as "the irretrievable discomfitu=
re of all his hopes, aims,=20

and aspirations," his labour as "being swept away without a trace of it bei=
ng left," and the latter=20

part of his life as utter "wretchedness." The failure of selfish schemes of=
ten makes men wretched.=20

The failure of unselfish aspirations may make a man sad, but can never make=
 him wretched, and=20



Milton was not wretched when he was writing "Paradise Lost." He would not h=
ave been wretched=20

even if the discomfiture of his hopes for the Commonwealth had been as fina=
l and as irretrievable=20

as his biographer supposes. But Milton knew that though disastrous it was n=
ot final or irretrievable.=20

He had implicit confidence in the indestructibility of moral force, and he =
"bated no jot of heart or=20

hope." He could see the limits of the reaction and he knew that, though gre=
at and calamitous in=20

proportion to the errors of the Republican party, it had not changed in a d=
ay the character and=20

fundamental tendencies of the nation. He would note that the Star Chamber, =
the Court of High=20

Commission, the Council of the North, the legislative functions once usurpe=
d by the Privy Council,=20

were not restored, and that no attempt was made to govern without a parliam=
ent. He found himself=20

the defender of regicide, not free from peril, indeed, yet protected by pub=
lic opinion, while, in=20

general, narrow bounds were set to the bloodthirsty vengeance of the Cavali=
ers. He lived to=20

witness the actual turn of the tide. Six years before his death the Triple =
Alliance was formed, and=20

in the year of his death the Cabal Ministry fell. At worst, his case would =
have been that of a soldier=20

killed in an unfortunate crisis of a battle which in the end was won, but h=
e fell, if not with the shout=20

of victory=20


_
Whinnie would express it, for I find myself becoming more and more interest=
ed in her=20

wonderfulness.... Peter sent me a hurried line or two to-day, telling me to=
 sit tight as he thought=20

he'd have news for me before the week was out.  I suspect him of trying to =
trick me into some=20

forlorn new lease of hope. But I have pinned my faith to Peter--and I know =
he would not trifle with=20

anything so sacred as mother-love.     _Saturday the Seventh_   There is no=
 news of my Dinkie....=20

But there is news of another nature.  Between ten and eleven this morning I=
 had Hilton motor me=20

down to Duncan's office in Eighth Avenue. It struck me as odd, at first, th=
at I had never been there=20

before. But Duncan, I remembered, had never asked me, the domestic fly, to =
step into his spider's=20

parlor of commerce. And I found a ridiculous timidity creeping over me as I=
 went up in the elevator,=20

and found the door-number, and saw myself confronted by a cadaverous urchin=
 in horn-rimmed=20

specs, who thrust a paper-covered novel behind his chair-back and asked me =
what I wanted. So I=20

asked him if this was Mr. McKail's office.  "Sure," he said in the establis=
hed vernacular of the=20

West.  "What is your name, little boy?" I inquired, with the sternest brand=
 of condescension I could=20

command.  The young monkey drew himself up at that and flushed angrily. "Oh=
, I don't know as=20

I'm so little," he observed, regarding me with a narrowing eye as I stepped=
 unbidden beyond the=20

sacred portals.  "Where will I find Mr. McKail's secretary?" I asked, notic=
ing the door in the stained-

wood partition with "Private" on its frosted glass. The youth nodded his he=
ad toward the door in=20

question and crossed to a desk where he proceeded languidly to affix postag=
e-stamps to a small=20

pile of envelopes.  I hesitated for a moment, as though there was something=
 epochal in the air, as=20

though I was making a step which might mean a great deal to me. And then I =
stepped over to the=20

door and opened it.  I saw a young woman seated at a flat-topped desk, with=
 a gold-banded=20

fountain-pen in her fingers, checking over a column of figures. She checked=
 carefully on to the end=20

of her column, and then she raised her head and looked at me.  Her face sto=
od out with singular=20

distinctness, in the strong side-light from the office-window. And the woma=
n seated at the flat-

topped desk was Alsina Teeswater.  I don't know how long I stood there with=
out speaking. But I=20

could see the color slowly mount and recede on Alsina Teeswater's face. She=
 put down her=20

fountain-pen, with much deliberation, and sat upright in her chair, with he=
r barricaded eyes every=20

moment of the time on my face.  "So this has started again?" I finally said=
, in little more than a=20

whisper.  I could see the girl's lips harden. I could see her fortifying he=
rself behind an=20

entrenchment of quietly marshaled belligerency.  "It has never stopped, Mrs=
. McKail," she said in=20

an equally low voice, but with the courage of utter desperation.  It took s=
ome general advance=20

around him. If we take remoter ages into our view, the triumph of Milton is=
 still more manifest. The=20

cause to which he gave his life and his genius is forever exalted and digni=
fied by his name. The=20

notion that the Cavaliers were the men of culture and that the Puritans wer=
e the uncultivated has=20

been a hundred times confuted, though it reappears in the discourses of Mr.=
 Matthew Arnold, and,=20

what is much more astonishing, in this work of Mr. Pattison. But in a party=
 of action great defect of=20

culture would be amply redeemed by the possession of a Milton.     COLERIDG=
E'S LIFE OF=20

KEBLE.  [Footnote: A Memoir of the Rev. J. Keble, M.A., late Vicar of Hursl=
ey, by the Right Hon.=20

Sir J.T. Coleridge, D.C.L., Oxford and London: James Parker & Co., 1869.]  =
 SIR JOHN=20

COLERIDGE, the writer of this "Life of Keble," was for many years one of th=
e Judges of the Court=20

of Queen's Bench, is now a Privy Councillor, and may be regarded almost as =
the lay head of the=20

High Church party in England. Sharing Keble's opinions, and entering into a=
ll his feelings, he is at=20



the same time himself always a man of the world and a man of sense. Add to =
these qualifications=20

his intimate and lifelong friendship with the subject of his work, and we h=
ave reason to expect a=20

biography at once appreciative and judicial. Such a biography, in fact, we =
have; one full of=20

sympathy, yet free from exaggeration, and a good lesson to biographers in g=
eneral. The intimacy=20

of the friendship between the writer and his subject might have interfered =
with his impartiality and=20

repelled our confidence if the case had been more complex and had made grea=
ter demands on=20

the inflexibility of the judge. But in the case of a character and a life s=
o perfectly simple, pure, and=20

transparent as the character and the life of Keble, there was but one thing=
 to be said.  The author=20

of "The Christian Year" was the son of a country clergyman of the Church of=
 England, and was=20

educated at home by his father, so that he missed, or, as he would probably=
 have said himself,=20

escaped, the knowledge of minds differently trained from his own which a bo=
y cannot help picking=20

up at an English public school. At a very early age he became a scholar of =
Corpus Christi, a very=20

small and secluded college of the High Church and High Tory University of O=
xford. As the=20

scholarships led to fellowships--the holders of which were required to be i=
n holy orders--and to=20

church preferment, almost all the scholars were destined for the clerical p=
rofession. Of Keble's=20

student friendships one only seems to have been formed outside the walls of=
 his own college, and=20

this was with Miller, a student of Worcester College, who afterwards became=
 a High Church=20

clergyman. Among the students destined for the Anglican priesthood in the J=
unior Common Room=20

of Corpus Christi College, there was indeed one whose presence strikes us l=
ike the apparition of=20

Turnus in the camp of AEneas--Thomas Arnold. Arnold was already Arnold,=20


_
to my brain. Everything seemed suddenly out of focus; and it was hard to re=
adjust vision to the=20

newer order of things. But I was calmer, under the circumstances, than I ex=
pected to be.  "I'm glad=20

I understand," I finally admitted.  The woman at the desk seemed puzzled. T=
hen she looked from=20

me to her column of figures and from her column of figures to the huddled r=
oofs and walls of the=20

city and the greening foot-hills and the solemn white crowns of the Rockies=
 behind them.  "Are you=20

quite sure, Mrs. McKail, that you do understand?" she asked at last, with j=
ust a touch of challenge=20

in the question.  "Isn't it quite simple now?" I demanded.  She found the c=
ourage to face me again.=20

"I don't think this sort of thing is ever simple," she replied, with much m=
ore emotion than I had=20

expected of her.  "But it's at least clear how it must end," I found the co=
urage to point out to her.=20

"Is that clear to _you_?" demanded the woman who was stepping into my shoes=
. It seemed odd,=20

at the moment, that I should feel vaguely sorry for her.  "Perhaps you migh=
t make it clearer," I=20

prompted.  "I'd rather Duncan did that," she replied, using my husband's fi=
rst name, obviously,=20

without knowing she had done so.  "Wouldn't it be fairer--for the two of us=
--now? Wouldn't it be=20

cleaner?" I rather tremulously asked of her.  She nodded and stared down at=
 the sheet covered=20

with small columns of figures.  "I don't know whether you know it or not," =
she said with a studied=20

sort of quietness, "but last week Mr. McKail began making arrangements to e=
stablish a residence=20

in Nevada. He will have to live there, of course, for at least six months, =
perhaps even longer."  I=20

could feel this sinking in, like water going through blotting-paper. The wo=
man at the desk must=20

have misinterpreted my silence, for she was moved to say, in a heavier effo=
rt at self-defense, "He=20

_knew_, of course, that you cared for some one else."  I looked at her, as =
though she were a=20

thousand miles away. I succeeded in drawing the young champions of the divi=
ne right of kings and=20

priests into a struggle against the divine right of tutors which 'secured t=
he liberty of the subject' at=20

Corpus--the question at issue between the subject and the ruler being by wh=
ich of two clocks, one=20

of which was always five minutes before the other, the recitations should b=
egin. The friendship=20

between Arnold and Keble, however, was merely personal, Arnold evidently ne=
ver exercised the=20

slightest influence over Keble's mind, and even in this 'great rebellion'--=
the only rebellion, great or=20

small, of his life--Keble was induced to take part, as he has expressly rec=
orded, at the instigation=20

of Coleridge, a middle term between Arnold and himself. The college teacher=
s were all clergymen=20

and the university curriculum in their days was regulated and limited by cl=
erical ascendancy, and=20

consisted of the Aristotelian and Butlerian philosophy, classics, and pure =
mathematics, without=20

modern history or physical science. The remarkable precocity of Keble's int=
ellect enabled him to=20

graduate with the highest honours both in classics and mathematics at an ag=
e almost miraculously=20

early even when allowance is made for the comparative youthfulness of stude=
nts in general in=20

those days. He was at once elected a Fellow of Oriel, and translated to the=
 Senior Common Room=20

of the College--another clerical society consisting of men for the most par=
t considerably his=20

seniors, among whom, in spite of the presence of Whately, High Church princ=
iples probably=20

predominated already, and were destined soon to predominate in the most ext=
reme sense, for the=20

college presently became the focus of the Ritualistic and Romanizing moveme=
nt. Thus, up to=20

twenty-three, Keble's life had been that of a sort of acolyte, and though n=
ot ascetic (for his nature=20

appears to have been always genial and mirthful), entirely clerical in its =
environments and its=20

aspirations. At twenty-three he took orders, and put round his=20


_
there impressed by the utter inadequacy of speech. And the thing that puzzl=
ed me was that there=20

was an air of honesty about the woman. She still so desperately clung to he=
r self-respect that she=20

wanted me to understand both her predicament and her motives. I could hear =
her explaining that=20

my husband had no intention of going to Reno, but would live in Virginia Ci=
ty, where he was taking=20

up some actual mining interests. Such things were not pleasant, of course. =
But this one could be=20

put through without difficulty. Mr. McKail had been assured of that.  I tri=
ed to pull myself together,=20

wondering why I should so suddenly feel like a marked woman, a pariah of th=
e prairies, as=20

friendless and alone as a leper. Then I thought of my children. And that cl=
eared my head, like a=20

wind sweeping clean a smoky room.  "But a case has to be made out," I began=
. "It would have to=20

be proved that I----"  "There will be no difficulty on that point, Mrs. McK=
ail," went on the other=20

woman as I came to a stop. "Provided the suit is not opposed."  The signifi=
cance of that quietly=20

uttered phrase did not escape me. Our glances met and locked.  "There are t=
he children," I=20

reminded her. And she looked a very commercialized young lady as she sat co=
nfronting me=20

across her many columns of figures.  "There should be no difficulty there--=
_provided_ the suit is=20

not opposed," she repeated with the air of a physician confronted by a hypo=
chondriacal patient.=20

"The children are mine," I rather foolishly proclaimed, with my first touch=
 of passion.  "The children=20

are yours," she admitted. And about her hung an air of authority, of cool r=
eserve, which I couldn't=20

help resenting.  "That is very generous of you," I admitted, not without ir=
onic intent.  She smiled=20

rather sadly as she sat looking at me.  "It's something that doesn't rest w=
ith either of us," she said=20

with the suspicion of a quaver in her voice. And _she_, I suddenly remember=
ed, might some day=20

sit eating her pot of honey on a grave. I realized, too, that very little w=
as to be gained by=20

prolonging that strangest of interviews. I wanted quietude in which to thin=
k things over. I wanted to=20

go back to my cell like a prisoner and brood over my sentence....  And I ha=
ve thought things over. I=20

at last see the light. From this day forward there shall be no vacillating.=
 I am going back to Casa=20

Grande.  I have always hated this house; I have always hated everything abo=
ut the place, without=20

having the courage to admit it. I have done my part, I have made my effort,=
 and it was a wasted=20

effort. I wasn't even given a chance. And now I shall gather my things toge=
ther and go back to my=20

home, to the only home that remains to me. I shall still have my kiddies. I=
 shall have my Poppsy=20

and--But sharp as an arrow-head the memory of my lost boy strikes into my h=
eart. My Dinkie is=20

gone. I no longer have him to make what is left of my life endurable....  I=
t is raining to-night, I=20

notice, steadily and dismally. It is a dark night, outside, for lost childr=
en....  Duncan has just come=20

home, wet and muddy, and gone up to his room. The gray-faced solemnity with=
 which he strode=20

past me makes me feel sure that he has been conversing with his lady-love. =
But what difference=20

does it make? What difference does _anything_ make? In the matter of women,=
 I have just=20

remembered, what may be one man's meat is another man's poison. But I can't=
 understand these=20

reversible people, like house-rugs, who can pretend to love two ways at onc=
e.... I only know one=20

man, in all the wide world, who has not shattered my faith in his kind. He =
is one of those neck-or-

nothing men who never change.  There are many ranchers, out in this country=
, who keep what=20

they call a blizzard-line. It's a rope that stretches in winter from their =
house-door to their shed or=20

their stable, a rope that keeps them from getting lost when a blizzard is r=
aging. Peter, I know,=20

Thirty-nine Articles, the whole contents of the Anglican Prayer Book and al=
l the contradictions=20

between those two standards of belief. For some time he held a tutorship in=
 his college then he=20



went down to a country living in the neighbourhood of a cathedral city, whe=
re he spent the rest of=20

his days. His character was so sweet and gentle that he could not fail to b=
e naturally disposed to=20

toleration. He even goes the length of saying that some profane libellers w=
hom his friend=20

Coleridge was going to prosecute, were not half so dangerous enemies to rel=
igion as some wicked=20

worldly-minded Christians. But it is no wonder, and implies no derogation f=
rom his charity, that he=20

should have regarded the progress of opinions different from his own as a m=
ediaeval monk would=20

have regarded the progress of an army of Saracens or a horde of Avars. His =
poetic sympathies=20

could not hinder him from disliking the rebel and Puritan Milton.  Thus it =
was impossible that he=20

should be in a very broad sense a poet of humanity. His fundamental concept=
ion of the world was=20

essentially mediaeval, his ideal was that of cloistered innocence or, still=
 better, the innocence of=20

untempted and untried infancy. For such perfection his Lyra Innocentium was=
 strung. When his=20

friend is thinking of the profession of the law, he conjures him to forego =
the brilliant visions which=20

tempted him in that direction for "visions far more brilliant and more cert=
ain too, more brilliant in=20

their results, inasmuch as the salvation of one soul is worth more than the=
 framing the Magna=20

Charta of a thousand worlds, more certain to take place since temptations a=
re fewer and=20

opportunities everywhere to be found. These words remind us of a passage in=
 one of Massillon's=20

sermons, preached on the delivery of colours to a regiment, in which the bi=
shop after dwelling on=20

the hardships and sufferings which soldiers are called upon to endure, inti=
mates that a small part=20

of those hardships and sufferings, undergone in performance of a monastic v=
ow, would merit the=20

kingdom of heaven. If souls are to be saved by real moral influences, Sir J=
ohn Coleridge has=20

probably saved a good many more souls as a religious judge and man of the w=
orld than he would=20

have saved as the rector of a country parish, and if character is formed by=
 moral effort, he has=20

probably formed a much higher character by facing temptation than he would =
have done by flying=20

from it. Keble himself, in his Morning Hymn, has a passage in a different s=
train, but the sentiment=20

which really prevailed with him was probably that embodied in his advice to=
 his friend.  Whatever=20

of grace, worth, or beneficence there could be in the half cloistered life =
of an Oxford fellow of those=20

days or in the rural and sacerdotal life of a High Church rector, there was=
 in the life of Keble at=20

Oriel, and afterwards at Hursley. The best spirit of such a life together w=
ith the image of a=20

character rivalling in spiritual beauty, after its kind that of Ken or Leig=
hton, is found in Keble's=20

poetry, and for this we may be, as hundreds of thousands have been, thankfu=
l.  The biographer=20

declines to enter into a critical examination of the "Christian Year," but =
he confidently predicts its=20

indefinite reign, founding his prediction on the causes of its original suc=
cess. He justly describes it,=20

in effect as rather a poetical manual of devotion than a book of poetry for=
 continuous reading It is=20

in truth, so completely out of the category of ordinary poetry that to esti=
mate its poetic merits would=20

be a very difficult task. Sir John Coleridge indicates this, when he cites =
as an appropriate tribute to=20

the excellence of the book the practice of the clergyman who used, every Su=
nday afternoon=20

instead of a sermon to read and interpret to his congregation the poem of t=
he Christian Year for=20

the day. The object of the present publication says the Preface will be=20


_
blizzard-line. And in some way, please God, he will yet lead me back to war=
mth. He is himself out=20

there in the cold, accepting it, all the time, with the same quiet fortitud=
e that a Polar bear might.=20

But he will thole through, in the end. For with all his roughness he can be=
 unexpectedly adroit.=20

Whinstane Sandy once told me something he had learned about Polar bears in =
his old Yukon=20

days: with all their heaviness, they can go where a dog daren't venture. If=
 need be, they can flatten=20

out and slide over a sheet of ice too thin to support a running dog. And th=
e drift-ice may be=20

widening, but I refuse to give up my hope of hope. "Let the mother go," as =
the Good Book says,=20

"that it may be well with thee!" ...  I have just remembered that I tried t=
o shoot my husband once.=20

He may make use of _that_, when he gets down to Virginia City. It might, in=
 fact, help things along=20

very materially. And Susie's eyes will probably pop out, when she reads it =
in a San Francisco=20

paper....  I've thought of so many clever things I should have said to Alsi=
na Teeswater. As I look=20

back, I find it was the other lady who did about all the talking. There wer=
e old ulcerations to be=20

cleared away, of course, and I let her talk about the same as you let a den=
tist work with his fingers=20

in your mouth.... But now I must go up and make sure my Poppsy is safely tu=
cked in. I have just=20

opened the door and looked out. It is storming wretchedly. God pity any lit=
tle boys who are abroad=20

on such a night!     _Two Hours Later_   It is well past midnight. But ther=
e is no sleep this night for=20

Chaddie McKail. I am too happy to sleep. I am too happy to act sane. For my=
 boy is safe. _Peter=20

has found my Dinkie!_  I was called to the telephone, a little after eleven=
, but couldn't hear well on=20

the up-stairs extension, so I went to the instrument down-stairs, where the=
 operator told me it was=20

long-distance, from Buckhorn. So I listened, with my heart in my mouth. But=
 all I could get was a=20

buzz and crackle and an occasional ghostly word. It was the storm, I suppos=
e. Then I heard=20

Peter's voice, thin and faint and far away, but most unmistakably Peter's v=
oice.  "Can you hear me=20

now?" he said, like a man speaking from the bottom of the sea.  "Yes," I ca=
lled back. "What is it?"=20

"Get bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with th=
ose recommended and=20

exemplified in the Prayer Book. This connection with the Prayer Book and wi=
th the Anglican=20

Calendar, while it has given the book an immense circulation necessarily li=
mits its range and=20

interest. Yet those who care least for being brought into unison with the P=
rayer Book fully admit=20

that the "Christian Year" gives proof of real poetic power. Keble himself, =
as his biographer attests,=20

had a very humble opinion of his own work, seldom read it hated to hear it =
praised consented with=20

great difficulty to its glorification by sumptuous editions. It was his sai=
ntly humility suggests the=20

biographer which made him feel that the book which flowed from his own hear=
t would inevitably be=20

taken for a faithful likeness of himself, that he would thus be exhibiting =
himself in favourable=20

colours and be in danger of incurring the woe pronounced on those who win t=
he good opinion of=20

the world. If this account be true it is another proof of the mediaeval and=
 half monastic mould in=20

which Keble's religious character was cast.  The comparative failure of the=
 "Lyra Innocentium" is=20

probably to be attributed not only to its inferiority in intrinsic merit bu=
t to the fact that whereas the=20

"Christian Year" has as little of a party character as any work of devotion=
 written by an Anglican=20

and High Church clergyman could have, the "Lyra Innocentium" was the work o=
f a leading party=20

man. The interval between the two publications had been filled by a great r=
eactionary movement=20

among the clergy, one of the back-streams to that current of Liberalism, wh=
ich setting in after the=20

termination of the great French war, not only swept away the Rotten borough=
s and the other=20

political bulwarks of Tory dominion but threatened to sweep away the privil=
eges of the Established=20



Church, and compelled Churchmen to look out for a basis independent of Stat=
e support. Keble=20

was the associate of Hurrell Froude, Newman Pusey and the other great Tract=
arians. A sermon=20

which he preached before the University of Oxford was regarded by Newman as=
 the beginning of=20

the movement. He contributed to the Tracts for the Times, though as a contr=
oversialist he was=20

never powerful, sweetness not strength being the=20


_
seemed to be speaking from the tip-top mountains of Mars. But the crackling=
 and burring cut us off=20

again. Then something must have happened to the line, or we must have been =
switched to a=20

better circuit. For, the next moment, Peter's voice seemed almost in the ne=
xt room. It seemed to=20

come closer at a bound, like a shore-line when you look at it through a tel=
escope.  "Is that any=20

better?" he asked through his miles and miles of rain-swept blackness.  "Ye=
s, I can hear you=20

plainly now," I told him.  "Ah, yes, that _is_ better," he acknowledged. "A=
nd everything else is, too,=20

my dear. For I've found your Dinkie and----"  "You've found Dinkie?" I gasp=
ed.  "I have, thank God.=20

And He gradually embraced, as it seems to us, all the principles which sent=
 his fellow Tractarians=20

over to Rome. The posthumous alteration made in the Christian Year by his d=
irection shows that=20

he held a doctrine respecting the Eucharist not practically distinguishable=
 from the Roman doctrine=20

of Transubstantiation. A poem intended to appear in the "Lyra Apostolica" b=
ut suppressed at the=20

time in deference to the wishes of cautious friends and now published by hi=
s biographer proves=20

that he was, as a Protestant putting it plainly would say, an advanced Mari=
olater. He was a=20

thoroughgoing sacerdotalist and believer in the authority of the Church in =
matters of opinion. He=20

mourned=20

"Where?" I demanded.  "Fast asleep at Alabama Ranch."  "Is he all right?"  =
"As fit as a fiddle--all=20

he wants is sleep."  "_Oh, Peter!_" It was foolish. But it was all I could =
say for a full minute. For my=20

boy was alive, and safe. My laddie had been found by Peter--by good old Pet=
er, who never, in the=20

time of need, was known to fail me.  "Where are you now?" I asked, when rea=

for the souls of dead=20

founders and benefactors as a lamentable concession to Protestant prejudice=
. Like his associates=20

he repudiated the very name of Protestant. He deemed the state of the Churc=
h of England with=20

regard to orthodoxy most deplorable--two prelates having distinctly denied =
an article of the=20

Apostles Creed and matters going on altogether so=20

"And you went all that way through the mud and rain, just to tell me?" I sa=

  "I want you to come=20
