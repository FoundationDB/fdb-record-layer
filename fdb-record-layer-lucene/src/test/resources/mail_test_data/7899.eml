_
washing,=E2=80=94that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the=
 human mind they do not vary=20

the result.=E2=80=9D  We can speak of nature in this all-embracing way so l=
ong as, like Emerson for the=20

moment, we lay aside every thought of man and of the moral world which he c=
reates or brings=20

under his control, and in which his responsibility is fixed. But once we re=
sume that human outlook,=20

we begin to use the word natural in at least two other senses. In the first=
 place we use it to=20

describe the process of life, that constant birth or becoming which seems t=
o have been present to=20

the mind of the Greek also when he used his word for nature=E2=80=94as when=
 Aristotle says, in a famous=20

phrase, that art is an imitation of nature, meaning that the process of art=
 is a copy of the processes=20

of birth and becoming, and creates by the same methods that life does. In t=
his sense of the word=20

nature is like art, not opposed to it, and with this interpretation Polixen=
es tried to rebuke the cult of=20

the natural in Perdita, who would not have in her garden a flower artificia=
lly bred:      Yet nature is=20

made better by no mean,     But nature makes that mean: so, o=E2=80=99er th=
at art     Which you say adds=20

to nature, is an art     That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry  =
   A gentler scion to the=20

wildest stock,     And make conceive a bark of baser kind     By bud of nob=
ler race: this is an art=20

Which does mend nature=E2=80=94change it rather: but     The art itself is =
nature.  We use the word nature=20

also to describe the raw material of life which is the result of a previous=
 birth or becoming. It is=20

what some earlier art, human or divine, has already worked on, and what we =
must work on now if=20

art is to continue. Nature in this sense is the marble, the color, the lang=
uage which are to be the=20

mediums of various arts; human passions and instincts also, the social and =
the material=20

environments which attend our lives, the accidents of fortune which make up=
 their plots; and since=20

all this is what art must work upon, nature so defined is forever somewhat =
opposed to art, as=20

inanimate materials are opposed to the workman, as the wood and the chisel =
are opposed to the=20

carpenter. For art is the use of the materials of life for human benefit, a=
 method employed for a=20

premeditated end in a world which except for art might seem given over to c=
hance. Because it is a=20

rearrangement and a control of nature to effect the will of man, life itsel=
f, so far as it becomes=20

civilized, becomes an art. But in a world as old as ours the raw material w=
ith which art deals is=20

itself the result of art; the wood has been already shaped into boards, the=
 chisel and the hammer=20

have been made into tools before the carpenter touches them, and the enviro=
nment in which the=20

carpenter is born, the instincts and passions he inherits, the turns and co=
incidences of his fate, are=20

all probably the result of what others before him to her man's attire as th=
e best, and indeed the=20

only, safeguard to her honor, constantly threatened by her keepers and even=
 attempted, we are=20

told, by one brutal knight. Relying upon the good faith of her ecclesiastic=
al custodians, now that=20

she had done what they asked, Jeanne consented to put on the women's clothe=
s they gave her.=20

But Cauchon had no intention of allowing her to escape the last punishment.=
 His judges had=20

assured the English, who complained that Jeanne would not be burned after a=
ll: "Do not fear, we=20

shall soon have her again."  On May 24th she had signed her act of submissi=
on and had put aside=20

the costume forbidden by the Church. On the morning of the 27th, when she w=
ished to rise and=20

dress herself, the guard had taken away her robes and left but the old forb=
idden garments. She=20

expostulated, and at first refused to get up; but being at length constrain=
ed to do so, she put on=20

the man's apparel. The wolf had made good and sufficient pretext for devour=
ing the lamb;=20

technically, Jeanne might be considered to have relapsed, and with the old =
dress to have resumed=20

the old faults reprobated by Holy Church.  The judges were at once notified=
 of Jeanne's=20



disobedience, and Cauchon rejoiced that "she was caught." The next day, bei=
ng Monday after=20

Trinity, he returned to interrogate the prisoner upon the matter of the cha=
nge of dress. Her=20

courage had returned with the realization that they had not dealt fairly wi=
th her and meant to find=20

pretexts for her destruction. She would neither excuse herself for again as=
suming her warrior=20

garments nor consent to return to those prescribed by custom for her sex. A=
s long as she was=20

guarded by men, she said, it was more seemly and more safe that she should =
be dressed as a=20

man; if they would put her in a safe and proper prison, she would submit to=
 whatever the Church=20

decreed. But Cauchon knew that her death was deemed requisite by his Englis=
h friends, and he=20

was determined to give her no such fair opportunity. On Tuesday a fresh tri=
bunal was hastily=20

constituted to pass upon the deplorable relapse into error of one for whom,=
 to shield her from=20

death, the Church had done all that in it lay. Needless to say, this tribun=
al, a mere mockery of a=20

court, decided on the evidence submitted that Jeanne was guilty of fatal di=
sobedience to the=20

Church and that she must suffer death as a heretic. It was to be but a step=
 from passing sentence=20

to the execution of that sentence, for Cauchon's masters were already impat=
ient at the long delay.=20

The next morning a priest was sent to Jeanne to notify her of the sentence.=
 One sudden burst of=20

feeling, half fear, half indignation, for a moment overwhelmed the courage =
of the girl. She wept=20

bitterly when told that she must prepare herself to die by fire that very d=
ay: "Alas! will they treat me=20

so cruelly and horribly! Must my body, pure as from birth, never corrupted =
or soiled in=20


_
so, we see it as an alternation of nature and art, or as an alternation in =
which what first is art=20

becomes afterwards nature, all the achievement of one generation turning in=
to mere starting point=20

and opportunity for the next; and thinking of life so, we understand how na=
ture, to the true artist, is=20

forever set over against art in a contrast that implies affection rather th=
an antagonism, for those=20

who instead of defining art as a decorative supplement to life identify it =
with civilization itself, are=20

free to love nature without abandoning an ideal, as a sculptor is free to l=
ove fine marble, or the=20

painter to love his medium of tint and tone. With time and by such a proces=
s of reworking, nature=20

draws nearer and nearer to art; the raw material is made constantly more or=
derly by reduced to=20

ashes! Oh, oh! I had rather be beheaded seven times over than burnt on this=
 wise.... Oh! I appeal=20

to God, the great Judge of all, for the wrongs and injuries done me!" And t=
hen this heretic, this=20

sorceress, asked that she be allowed to confess and to receive the Communio=
n, that holy symbol=20

of the universal brotherhood of the followers of Christ. Cauchon did not, p=
erhaps dared not, deny=20

her this; but he wished to divest the ceremony of part of its pomp. When th=
e Eucharist was=20

brought to him without stole and without lights, the courageous monk Martin=
 l'Advenu refused to=20

administer it thus, and sent a complaint to the cathedral; whereupon the ch=
apter, always ready to=20

spite Cauchon, sent an escort of priests and acolytes, who chanted litanies=
 as they passed=20

through the=20


_
crops. Even in the sphere of human character this is true, in the very seat=
 of the natural, in our=20

instincts and passions; for though we may agree that character should be me=
asured by a moral=20

career rather than by impulses wholly innate, yet it is well to reflect tha=
t your impulses and=20

sentiments, if you are born  By nine o'clock the victim had received the Co=
mmunion, and was=20

dressed in female attire and placed on a cart, ready to start for the place=
 of execution. Brother=20

Martin and the merciful Austin friar Isambart accompanied her on that dread=
ful journey of the cart=20

through the streets of Rouen to the old fish market. If=20
