equipment?"  "I think we have all it takes," Mary said, smiling.  "You cert=

exclaimed. "A portable forge with coal to fire it, a vise, an anvil, and al=

essional manner. "It was=20

"Well, then, let's get busy." She motioned her men to unload.  "We don't ha=
ve rivets," she went on,=20

"but we do have several sizes of copper pipes and these boys will make you =
the finest rivets you=20

ever saw--any size--any length."  That this was no idle boast the boys soon=
 discovered, for in an=20

incredibly short time the forge was glowing and the anvil ringing.  "I only=
 hope those Japs don't=20

hear that noise." Jack's brow wrinkled.  "They won't," was Mary's reply, "f=

 follows the paths of=20

poor conductors. The proximity or contact of a large metallic object expose=

consequently more or less dangerous. On the other hand, the absence of tall=
 objects or of=20

specially good conductors of any kind does not insure safety. In many cases=

struck, and cases are related of persons struck on the prairies in the West=
