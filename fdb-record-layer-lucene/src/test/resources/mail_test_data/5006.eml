to them and to the whites."[2] Questioned as to any positive law providing =
for such discrimination,=20

Chandler gave his opinion that the School Committee of Boston, under the au=
thority perhaps of=20

the City Council, had a legal right to establish and maintain special prima=
ry schools for the blacks.=20

He believed, too, that in the exercise of their lawful discretionary power =
they could exclude white=20

pupils from certain schools and colored pupils from certain other schools w=
hen, in their judgment,=20

the best interests of all would thereby be promoted.[3]  [Footnote 1: Wigha=
m, _The Antislavery=20

Cause in America_, p. 103.]  [Footnote 2: _Minority Report_, etc., p. 31.] =
 [Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p.=20

30.]  Encouraged by the fact that colored children were indiscriminately ad=
mitted to the schools of=20

Salem, Nantucket, New Bedford, and Lowell, in fact, of every city in Massac=
husetts but Boston,=20

the friends of the colored people fearlessly attacked the false legal theor=
ies of Solicitor Chandler.=20

The minority of the School Committee argued that schools are the common pro=
perty of all, and=20

that each and all are legally entitled without "let or hindrance" to the eq=
ual benefits of all=20

advantages they might confer.[1] Any action, therefore, which tended to res=
trict to any individual or=20

class the advantages and benefits designed for all, was an illegal use of a=
uthority, and an arbitrary=20

act used for pernicious purposes.[2] Their republican system, the minority =
believed, conferred civil=20

equality and legal rights upon every citizen, knew neither privileged nor d=
egraded classes, made=20

no distinctions, and created no differences between rich and poor, learned =
and ignorant, or white=20

and black, but extended to all alike its protection and benefits.[3] The mi=
nority considered it a merit=20

of the school system that it produced the fusion of all classes, promoted t=
he feeling of=20

brotherhood, and the habits of equality. The power of the School Committee,=
 therefore, was=20

limited and constrained by the general spirit of the civil policy and by th=
e letter and spirit of the=20

laws which regulated the system.[4] It was further maintained that to debar=
 the colored youth from=20

these advantages, even if they were assured the same external results, woul=
d be a sore injustice=20

and would serve as the surest means of perpetuating a prejudice which shoul=
d be deprecated and=20

discountenanced by all intelligent and Christian men.[5]  [Footnote 1: _Ibi=
d_., p. 3.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_Minority Report_, etc. pp. 4 and 5.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid_., pp. 3 _et. seq=
_.]  [Footnote 4: _Ibid_., p.=20

4.]  [Footnote 5: _Ibid_., p. 5.]  To the sophistry of Chandler, Wendell Ph=
illips also made a logical=20

reply. He asserted that as members of a legal body, the School Committee sh=
ould have eyes only=20

for such distinctions among their fellow-citizens as the law recognized and=
 pointed out. Phillips=20

believed that they had precedents for the difference of age and sex, for re=
gulation of health, etc.,=20

but that when they opened their eyes to the varied complexion, to differenc=
e of race, to diversity of=20

creed, to distinctions of caste, they would seek in vain through the laws a=
nd institutions of=20

Massachusetts for any recognition of their prejudice. He deplored the fact =
that they had attempted=20

to foist into the legal arrangements of the land a principle utterly repugn=
ant to the State=20

constitution, and that what the sovereignty of the constitution dared not a=
ttempt a school=20

committee accomplished. To Phillips it seemed crassly inconsistent to say t=
hat races permitted to=20

intermarry should be debarred by Mr. Chandler's "sapient committee" from ed=
ucational contact.[1]=20

[Footnote 1: _Minority Report_, etc., p. 27.]  This agitation continued unt=
il 1855 when the=20

opposition had grown too strong to be longer resisted. The legislature of M=
assachusetts then=20

enacted a law providing that in determining the qualifications of a scholar=
 to be admitted to any=20

public school no distinction should be made on account of the race, color, =
or religious opinion of=20

the applicant. It was further provided that a child excluded from school fo=
r any of these reasons=20



might bring suit for damages against the offending town.[1]  [Footnote 1: _=
Acts and Resolves of=20

the General Court of Mass_., 1855, ch. 256.]  In other towns of New England=
, where the black=20

population was considerable, separate schools were established. There was o=
ne even in Portland,=20

Maine.[1] Efforts in this direction were made in Vermont and New Hampshire,=
 but because of the=20

scarcity of the colored people these States did not have to resort to such =
segregation. The=20

Constitution of Vermont was interpreted as extending to Negroes the benefit=
s of the Bill of Rights,=20

making all men free and equal. Persons of color, therefore, were regarded a=
s men entitled to all=20

the privileges of freemen, among which was that of education at the expense=
 of the State.[2] The=20

framers of the Constitution of New Hampshire were equally liberal in securi=
ng this right to the dark=20

race.[3] But when the principal of an academy at Canaan admitted some Negro=
es to his private=20

institution, a mob, as we have observed above, broke up the institution by =
moving the building to a=20

swamp, while the officials of the town offered no resistance. Such a spirit=
 as this accounts for the=20

rise of separate schools in places where the free blacks had the right to a=
ttend any institution of=20

learning supported by the State.  [Footnote 1: Adams, _Anti-slavery_, etc.,=
 p. 142.]  [Footnote 2:=20

Thorpe, _Federal and State Constitutions_, vol. vi., p. 3762.]  [Footnote 3=
: _Ibid_., vol. iv., p.=20

2471.]   The problem of educating the Negroes at public expense was perplex=
ing also to the minds=20

of the people of the West. The question became more and more important in O=
hio as the black=20

population in that commonwealth increased. The law of 1825 provided that mo=
neys raised from=20

taxation of half a mill on the dollar should be appropriated to the support=
 of common schools in the=20

respective counties and that these schools should be "open to the youth of =
every class and grade=20

without distinction."[1] Some interpreted this law to include Negroes. To o=
vercome the objection to=20

the partiality shown by school officials the State passed another law in 18=
29. It excluded colored=20

people from the benefits of the new system, and returned them the amount ac=
cruing from the=20

school tax on their property.[2] Thereafter benevolent societies and privat=
e associations=20

maintained colored schools in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, and the sout=
hern counties of=20

Ohio.[3] But no help came from the cities and the State before 1849 when th=
e legislature passed a=20

law authorizing the establishment of schools for children of color at publi=
c expense.[4]  [Footnote=20

1: _Laws of Ohio_, vol. xxiii., pp. 37 _et seq_.]  [Footnote 2: Hickok, _Th=
e Negro in Ohio_, p. 85.]=20

[Footnote 3: Simmons, _Men of Mark_, p. 374.]  [Footnote 4: _Laws of Ohio_,=
 vol. liii., pp. 117-

118.]  The Negroes of Cincinnati soon discovered that they had not won a gr=
eat victory. They=20

proceeded at once to elect trustees, organized a system, and employed teach=
ers, relying on the=20

money allotted them by the law on the basis of a per capita division of the=
 school fund received by=20

the Board of Education of Cincinnati. So great was the prejudice that the s=
chool officials refused to=20

turn over the required funds on the grounds that the colored trustees were =
not electors, and=20

therefore could not be office holders qualified to receive and her dear. He=
r name has passed into=20

eternal silence. And when God gave you to us, your father said to me, =E2=
=80=98M=E2=80=99amie, for many years=20

now the world has been talking of nothing but peace and love and the univer=
sal brotherhood of=20

man; but because in the brotherhood of man men have forgotten the Fatherhoo=
d of God, their=20

peace is ending in war, and their love in hatred such as earth has seldom s=
een. By the time this=20

babe is a woman grown, perhaps once again the world will have tired of war =
and _victory_=E2=80=99 (only in=20

this way did he utter the name), =E2=80=98and may be glad to be reminded of=
 the existence of such things=20

as clemency and forgiveness; so I propose that we call the daughter of our =
house Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=80=99=20



Accordingly, Cl=C3=A9mence you are.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is quite right, m=
other. I like my name. Clemency should=20

always follow victory.--Ah! there is Henri. His step is tired and slow.=E2=
=80=9D  Henri came in, and in the old=20

ceremonious way kissed his mother=E2=80=99s hand and asked after her health=
. But the look that passed=20

between them showed that although Madame de Talmont loved both her children=
 intensely, her=20

son was the very joy of her existence; while on his part, the love of his m=
other was the strongest=20

passion that had yet found entrance into his young heart. His face was pale=
 and anxious; indeed it=20

wore almost an expression of terror.  =E2=80=9CWhat is the matter?=E2=80=9D=
 his mother asked presently.  =E2=80=9CNothing=20

particular,--nothing much,=E2=80=9D said Henri.  =E2=80=9CWhatever it is, s=
peak, my son,--and at once,=E2=80=9D said=20

Madame de Talmont imperatively.  =E2=80=9CThere is a placard on the Mairie =
announcing that the drawing=20

for the conscription is to take place next Thursday. It is as the cur=C3=A9=
 told us: all are liable who will=20

be eighteen in the course of the year.=E2=80=9D  Both his hearers grew pale=
, and the work fell from their=20

hands. After a short pause his mother said, =E2=80=9CIt is plain you will h=
ave to attend. God grant you may=20

draw a good number. But, at all events--=E2=80=9D She remained silent for s=
ome moments, then she added,=20

in a voice which struggled hard to be calm, =E2=80=9CBring me my desk, Cl=
=C3=A9mence; we must be prepared=20

for the worst.=E2=80=9D  Cl=C3=A9mence obeyed mechanically, while Henri sto=
od silent and listless, watching her=20

movements.  =E2=80=9CHenri,=E2=80=9D resumed Madame de Talmont, =E2=80=9CI =
am going to write to our good friend=20

Grandpierre. _Should_ the worst happen, you must escape, and go to him thro=
ugh the forest. He=20

will shelter you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, mother, mother=E2=80=9D--the lad=
=E2=80=99s colour came and went, and a quiver ran through=20

his frame--=E2=80=9Cthe risk is terrible.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo _him_? He w=
ill venture it, for the House of Talmont, for his=20

King, and for his God.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTo us all. Do you know how they d=
eal with the _refractory_, as they call=20

those who try to evade the conscription, and with their families?=E2=80=9D =
 Madame de Talmont raised her=20

thin hand with a peremptory gesture, =E2=80=9CNot another word, Henri. It c=
oncerns not thee or us to=20

measure the danger; the duty is all with which we have to do. I can bear to=
 think of thee pining on=20

bread and water, with a bullet chained to thy foot, and thy head shaved lik=
e a convict=E2=80=99s; I could=20

_not_ bear to know thee in the camp of the Corsican tyrant, fighting to fas=
ten his iron yoke upon=20

the necks of free men. How could I look upon thy father=E2=80=99s face in h=
eaven, if I had reared and=20

nourished his son for _this_?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut oh, mother, it is _you=
_ I think of--you and Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWhatever cross God lays upon us he will give us strength to sustai=
n. Go, my children, and pray to=20

him. I must be alone while I write this letter, for it will need to be very=
 cautiously but very distinctly=20

worded. The posts are not safe.=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER X.  THE DRAWING OF THE=
 LOT.    =E2=80=9COur God=20

upon the cross,   Our king upon the scaffold; let us think   Of these, and =
fold endurance to our=20

hearts.=E2=80=9D   Cl=C3=A9mence went into her own room, and Henri followed=
 her. The chamber was severely=20

simple, but scrupulously neat. The narrow bedstead might have suited a nun,=
 and the table and=20

chairs were of unpainted deal: but an ivory crucifix, exquisitely carved, h=
ung over the bed; and the=20

white-washed wall was adorned with a little tier of book-shelves, construct=
ed by Henri, and=20

containing a select and precious library--the =E2=80=9CAugustinos=E2=80=9D =
of Jansenius, the works of Arnauld,=20

Nicole, and other divines of the school of Port-Royal, the sermons of F=C3=
=A9n=C3=A9lon, and the letters of=20

Madame Guyon. Most precious of all was De Sacy=E2=80=99s translation of the=
 New Testament; and next to=20

this inestimable treasure, the volume best beloved and most carefully studi=
ed by Cl=C3=A9mence was=20

the Port-Royal edition of the =E2=80=9CPens=C3=A9es de Pascal.=E2=80=9D Man=
y a line, marked by the hand of the=20

thoughtful young student, showed her sympathy with the soul of the great te=
acher. Her heart, like=20

his, had turned from all that earth could give to seek a more enduring rest=
 and a better portion.=20



Had she found it? At least she had found much that was unspeakably precious=
--a God to be loved=20

and served with all her mind, with all her soul, and with all her strength.=
 But she had been taught=20

to dwell rather upon his commandments than upon his gifts, and was still fa=
r from recognizing, with=20

St. Augustine, that he himself must give that which he commands. She had se=
en the mystery of=20

the cross, but dimly and afar off, reading therein rather the exceeding sin=
fulness of the sin that had=20

to be atoned for, than the unutterable greatness of the love that atoned fo=
r all. Consequently, her=20

religion was one of surrender and renunciation, not of joyous acceptance an=
d activity; death to the=20

flesh was her watchword rather than life in the Spirit. The air she breathe=
d was bracing and=20

invigorating, but it was cold and sunless. If it were the will of God that =
Henri should become a=20

hunted fugitive, that he should be arrested as =E2=80=9Crefractory,=E2=80=
=9D and should perish miserably in a=20

fortress dungeon, there was nothing for her to say but this, =E2=80=9CIt is=
 the Lord; let him do what seemeth=20

him good.=E2=80=9D And having said it, she would still be an unprofitable s=
ervant. Her heart, it is true, would=20

be broken; but what mattered that to any one?  While such thoughts passed t=
hrough the mind of=20

Cl=C3=A9mence, Henri stood in silence, leaning against the little latticed =
window, and looking out upon=20

the peaceful country landscape. At last he spoke. =E2=80=9CThey are gay eno=
ugh in the village,=E2=80=9D he said.=20

=E2=80=9CThey do not seem to dread the conscription half so much as they di=
d last year. In fact, this new=20

war is very popular. Mathieu F=C3=A9ron, who was standing in his father=E2=
=80=99s forge when I went by, said=20

_he_ would be glad to be drawn; and Jacques Bonin, and that other lad who i=
s with him, were of=20

the same mind, saying they would like nothing better than to go and give th=
e Russians a good=20

beating.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat miserable folly!=E2=80=9D said Cl=C3=A9men=
ce with bitter sadness. =E2=80=9CWhat have the Russians=20

done to us, that the blacksmith=E2=80=99s son and the butcher=E2=80=99s boy=
s of Brie should be eager to go and kill=20

them?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI daresay you know as well as they do,=E2=80=9D re=
turned Henri.  =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98It is in his heart to pluck up and=20

to destroy kingdoms not a few,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence quoted. =E2=
=80=9CBut, Henri,=E2=80=9D she added, with a sudden gleam=20

of hope, =E2=80=9Cmay not good for us spring out of this madness of theirs?=
 Might we not, even if you draw=20

a bad number, find a substitute? You know there is nothing we would not par=
t with to raise the=20

money--_nothing_.=E2=80=9D  Henri shook his head. =E2=80=9CLast time,=E2=80=
=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthe price went up to three=20

thousand francs, and beyond it. Indeed, it was difficult to get one at any =
price. But that is not all,=E2=80=9D--

he lowered his voice: =E2=80=9CCl=C3=A9mence, I have reason to think M. le =
Maire means no good to=20


_
trustees called indignation meetings, and raised sufficient money to employ=
 Flamen Ball, an=20

attorney, to secure a writ of mandamus. The case was contested by the city =
officials even in the=20

Supreme Court of the State which decided against the officious whites.[2]  =
[Footnote 1: _Special=20

Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed_., 1871, pp. 371, 372.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid_.=
, 1871, p. 372.]=20

Unfortunately it turned out that this decision did not mean very much to th=
e Negroes. There were=20

not many of them in certain settlements and the per capita division of the =
fund did not secure to=20

them sufficient means to support schools. Even if the funds had been adequa=
te to pay teachers,=20

they had no schoolhouses. Lawyers of that day contended that the Act of 184=
9 had nothing to do=20

with the construction of buildings. After a short period of accomplishing p=
ractically nothing=20

material, the law was amended so as to transfer the control of such colored=
 schools to the=20

managers of the white system.[1] This was taken as a reflection on the stan=
ding of the blacks of=20

the city and tended to make them refuse to cooeperate with the white board.=
 On account of the=20

failure of this body to act effectively prior to 1856, the people of color =
were again given power to=20

elect their own trustees.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Laws of the State of Ohio_, vol=
. liii., p. 118.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_Ibid_., p. 118.]  During the contest for the control of the colored school=
s certain Negroes of=20

Cincinnati were endeavoring to make good their claim that their children ha=
d a right to attend any=20

school maintained by the city. Acting upon this contention a colored patron=
 sent his son to a public=20

school, which on account of his presence became the center of unusual excit=
ement.[1] Miss=20

Isabella Newhall, the teacher to whom he went, immediately complained to th=
e Board of=20

Education, requesting that he be expelled on account of his race. After "du=
e deliberation" the=20

Board of Education decided by a vote of fifteen to ten that he would have t=
o withdraw from that=20

school. Thereupon two members of that body, residing in the district of the=
 timorous teacher,=20

resigned.[2]  [Footnote 1: New York _Tribune_, Feb. 19, 1855.]  [Footnote 2=
: New York _Tribune_,=20

Feb. 19, 1855; and Carlier, _L'Esclavage_, etc., p. 339.]  Thereafter some =
progress in the=20

development of separate schools in Cincinnati was noted. By 1855 the Board =
of Education of that=20

city had established four public schools for the instruction of Negro youth=
s. The colored pupils=20

were showing their appreciation by regular attendance, manly deportment, an=
d rapid progress in=20

the acquisition of knowledge. Speaking of these Negroes in 1855, John P. Fo=
ote said that they=20

shared with the white citizens that respect for education, and the diffusio=
n of knowledge, which=20

has ever been one of their "characteristics," and that they had, therefore,=
 been more generally=20

intelligent than free persons of color not only in other States but in all =
other parts of the world.[1] It=20

was in appreciation of the worth of this class of progressive Negroes that =
in 1858 Nicholas=20

Longworth built a comfortable school-house for them in Cincinnati, leasing =
it with the privilege of=20

purchasing it in fourteen years.[2] They met these requirements within the =
stipulated time, and in=20

1859 secured through other agencies the construction of another building in=
 the western portion of=20

the city.[3]  [Footnote 1: Foote, _The Schools of Cincinnati_, p. 92.]  [Fo=
otnote 2: _Special Report=20

of the U.S. Com. of Ed_., 1871, p. 372.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 372.]  T=
he agitation for the=20

admission of colored children to the public schools was not confined to Cin=
cinnati alone, but came=20

up throughout the section north of the Ohio River.[1] Where the black popul=
ation was large enough=20

to form a social center of its own, Negroes and their friends could more ea=
sily provide for the=20

education of colored children. In settlements, however, in which just a few=
 of them were found,=20

some liberal-minded man usually asked the question why persons taxed to sup=
port a system of=20



free schools should not share its benefits. To strengthen their position th=
ese benevolent men=20

referred to the rapid progress of the belated people, many of whom within l=
ess than a generation=20

from their emergence from slavery had become intelligent, virtuous, and res=
pectable persons, and=20

in not a few cases had accumulated considerable wealth.[2] Those who insist=
ed that children of=20

African blood should be debarred from the regular public schools had for th=
eir defense the so-

called inequality of the races. Some went so far as to concede the claims m=
ade for the progressive=20

blacks, and even to praise those of their respective communities.[3] But gr=
eat as their progress=20

had been, the advocates of the restriction of their educational privileges =
considered it wrong to=20

claim for them equality with the Caucasian race. They believed that society=
 would suffer from an=20

intermingling of the children of the two races.  [Footnote 1: Hickok, _The =
Negro in Ohio_, ch. iii.;=20

and Boone, _History of Education in Indiana_, p. 237.]  [Footnote 2: Foote,=
 _The Schools of=20

Cincinnati_, p. 93.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 92.]  In Indiana the problem=
 of educating Negroes was=20

more difficult. R.G. Boone says that, "nominally for the first few years of=
 the educational=20

experience of the State, black and white children had equal privileges in t=
he few schools that=20

existed."[1] But this could not continue long. Abolitionists were moving th=
e country, and freedmen=20

soon found enemies as well as friends in the Ohio valley. Indiana, which wa=
s in 1824 so very=20

"solicitous for a system of education which would guard against caste disti=
nction," provided in=20

1837 that the white inhabitants alone of each congressional township should=
 constitute the local=20

school corporation.[2] In 1841 a petition was sent to the legislature reque=
sting that a reasonable=20

share of the school fund be appropriated to the education of Negroes, but t=
he committee to which=20

it was referred reported that legislation on that subject was inexpedient.[=
3] With the exception of=20

prohibiting the immigration of such persons into that State not much accoun=
t of them was taken=20

until 1853. Then the legislature amended the law authorizing the establishm=
ent of schools in=20

townships so as to provide that in all enumerations the children of color s=
hould not be taken, that=20

the property of the blacks and mulattoes should not be taxed for school pur=
poses, and that their=20

children should not derive any benefit from the common schools of that Stat=
e.[4] This provision=20

had really been incorporated into the former law, but was omitted by oversi=
ght on the part of the=20

engrossing clerk.[5]  [Footnote 1: Boone, _History of Ed. in Indiana_, p. 2=
37.]  [Footnote 2: _Laws=20

of a General Nature of the State of Indiana_, 1837, p. 15.]  [Footnote 3: B=
oone, _History of=20

Education in Indiana_, p. 237.]  [Footnote 4: _Laws of a General Nature of =
the State of Indiana_,=20

1855, p. 161.]  [Footnote 5: Boone, _History of Education in Indiana_, p. 2=
37.]  A resolution of the=20

House instructing the educational committee to report a bill for the establ=
ishment of schools for the=20

education of the colored children of the State was overwhelmingly defeated =
in 1853. Explaining=20

their position the opponents said that it was held "to be better for the we=
aker party that no privilege=20

be extended to them," as the tendency to such "might be to induce the vain =
belief that the=20

prejudice of the dominant race could ever be so mollified as to break down =
the rugged barriers that=20

must forever exist between their social relations." The friends of the blac=
ks believed that by=20

elevating them the sense of their degradation would be keener, and so the g=
reater would be their=20

anxiety to seek another country, where with the spirit of men they "might b=
reathe fresh air of social=20

as well as political liberty."[1] This argument, however, availed little. B=
efore the Civil War the=20

Negroes of Indiana received help in acquiring knowledge from no source but =
private and mission=20

schools.  [Footnote 1: Boone, _History of Education in Indiana_, p. 237.]  =
In Illinois the situation=20



was better than in Indiana, but far from encouraging. The constitution of 1=
847 restricted the=20

benefits of the school law to white children, stipulating the word white th=
roughout the act so as to=20

make clear the intention of the legislators.[1] It seemed to some that, in =
excluding the colored=20

children from the public schools, the law contemplated the establishment of=
 separate schools in=20

that it provided that the amount of school taxes collected from Negroes sho=
uld be returned.=20

Exactly what should be done with such money, however, was not stated in the=
 act. But even if that=20

were the object in view, the provision was of little help to the people of =
color for the reason that the=20

clause providing for the return of school taxes was seldom executed. In the=
 few cases in which it=20

was carried out the fund thus raised was not adequate to the support of a s=
pecial school, and=20

generally there were not sufficient colored children in a community to just=
ify such an outlay. In=20

districts having control of their local affairs, however, the children of N=
egroes were often given a=20

chance to attend school.  [Footnote 1: The Constitution of Illinois, in the=
 _Journal of the=20

Constitution of the State of Illinois_, 1847, p. 344.]  As this scant consi=
deration given Negroes of=20

Illinois left one-half of the six thousand of their children out of the pal=
e of education, earnest=20

appeals were made that the restrictive word white be stricken from the scho=
ol law. The friends of=20

the colored people sought to show how inconsistent this system was with the=
 spirit of the=20

constitution of the State, which, interpreted as they saw it, guaranteed al=
l persons equality.[1] They=20

held meetings from which came renewed petitions to their representatives, e=
ntreating them to=20

repeal or amend the old school law. It was not so much a question as to whe=
ther or not there=20

should be separate schools as it was whether or not the people of color sho=
uld be educated. The=20

dispersed condition of their children made it impossible for the State to p=
rovide for them in special=20

schools the same educational facilities as those furnished the youth of Cau=
casian blood. Chicago=20

tried the experiment in 1864, but failing to get the desired result, incorp=
orated the colored children=20

into the white schools the following year.[2] The State Legislature had suf=
ficient moral courage to=20

do away with these caste distinctions in 1874.[3]  [Footnote 1: Thorpe, _Fe=
deral and State=20

Constitutions_, Const. of Illinois.]  [Footnote 2: _Special Report of U.S. =
Com. of Ed._, 1871, p.=20

343.]  [Footnote 3: Starr and Curtis, _Annotated Statutes of Illinois_, ch.=
 105, p. 2261.]  In other=20

States of the West and the North where few colored people were found, the s=
olution of the=20

problem was easier. After 1848 Negroes were legal voters in the school meet=
ings of Michigan.=20

Colored children were enumerated with others to determine the basis for the=
 apportionment of the=20

school funds, and were allowed to attend the public schools. Wisconsin gran=
ted Negroes equal=20

school privileges.[1] After the adoption of a free constitution in 1857, Io=
wa "determined no man's=20

rights by the color of his skin." Wherever the word white had served to res=
trict the privileges of=20

persons of color it was stricken out to make it possible for them not only =
to bear arms and to vote=20

but to attend public schools.[2]  [Footnote 1: _Special Report of the U.S. =
Com. of Ed._, 1871, p.=20

400.]  [Footnote 2: _Journal of the Constitutional Convention of the State =
of Iowa_, 1857, p. 3 of=20

he subject treated=20

in this part (the instruction of Negroes) are from the works of Dr. Cotton =
Mather.--Bishop William=20

Meade.  1st. I would always remember, that my servants are in some sense my=
 children, and by=20

taking care that they want nothing which may be good for them, I would make=
 them as my=20

children; and so far as the methods of instituting piety into the mind whic=
h I use with my children,=20

may be properly and prudently used with my servants, they shall be partaker=
s in them--Nor will I=20



leave them ignorant of anything, wherein I may instruct them to be useful t=
o their generation.  2d. I=20

will see that my servants be furnished with bibles and be able and careful =
to read the lively=20

oracles. I will put bibles and other good and proper books into their hands=
; will allow them time to=20

read and assure myself that they do not misspend this time--If I can discer=
n any wicked books in=20

their hands, I will take away those pestilential instruments of wickedness.=
  3d. I will have my=20

servants present at the religious exercises of my family; and will drop, ei=
ther in the exhortations, in=20

the prayers or daily sacrifices of the family such pages as may have a tend=
ency to quicken a=20

sense of religion in them.  4th. The article of catechising, as far as the =
age or state of the servants=20

will permit it to be done with decency, shall extend to them also,--And the=
y shall be concerned in=20

the conferences in which I may be engaged with my family, in the repetition=
 of the public sermons.=20

If any of them when they come to me shall not have learned the catechism, I=
 will take care that=20

they do it, and will give them a reward when they have accomplished it.  5t=
h. I will be very=20

inquisitive and solicitous about the company chosen by my servants; and wit=
h all possible=20

earnestness will rescue them from the snares of evil company, and forbid th=
eir being the=20

companions of fools.  6th. Such of my servants as may be capable of the tas=
k, I will employ to=20

teach lessons of piety to my children, and will recompense them for so doin=
g. But I would, by a=20

particular artifice, contrive them to be such lessons, as may be for their =
own edification too.  7th. I=20

will sometimes call my servants alone; talk to them about the state of thei=
r souls; tell them to close=20

with their only servant, charge them to do well and "lay hold on eternal li=
fe," and show them very=20

particularly how they may render all they do for me a service to the glorio=
us Lord; how they may=20

do all from a principle of obedience to him, and become entitled to the "re=
ward of the heavenly=20

inheritance."  To those resolutions did I add the following pages as an app=
endix:  Age is nearly=20

sufficient, with some masters to obliterate every letter and action in the =
history of a meritorious life,=20

and old services are generally buried under the ruins of an old carcase. It=
 is a barbarous=20

inhumanity in men towards their servants, to account their small failings a=
s crimes, without=20

allowing their past services to have been virtues; gracious God, keep thy s=
ervants from such base=20

ingratitude!  But then O servants, if you would obtain "the reward of inher=
itance," each of you=20

should set yourself to enquire "how shall I approve myself such a servant, =
that the Lord may bless=20

the house of my master, the more for my being in it?" Certainly there are m=
any ways by which=20

servants may become blessings. Let your studies with your continual prayers=
 for the welfare of the=20

family to which you belong: and the example of your sober carriage render y=
ou such. If you will but=20

remember four words and attempt all that is comprised in them, Obedience, H=
onesty, Industry,=20

and Piety, you will be the blessings and Josephs of the families in which y=
ou live. Let these four=20

words be distinctly and frequently recollected; and cheerfully perform all =
your business from this=20

consideration--that it is obedience to heaven, and from thence will leave a=
 recompense. It was the=20

observation even of a pagan, "That a master may receive a benefit from a se=
rvant"; and "what is=20

done with the affection of a friend, ceases to be the act of a mere servant=
." Even the maid-

servants of a house may render a great service to it, by instructing the in=
fants and instilling into=20

their minds the lessons of goodness.--In the Appendix of Rev. Thomas Bacon'=

PROPOSITION FOR ENCOURAGING THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATION OF INDIAN, NEGRO, AND=

 LETTER OF BISHOP=20

GIBSON OF LONDON  To the Masters and Mistresses of Families in the English =
Plantations=20

abroad; exhorting them to encourage and promote the instruction of their Ne=
groes in the Christian=20

Faith. (About 1727.)  The care of the Plantations abroad being committed to=
 the Bishop of London=20

as to Religious Affairs; I have thought it my duty to make particular Inqui=
ries into the State of=20

Religion in those Parts, and to learn among other Things, what numbers of s=
laves are employed=20

within the several Governments, and what Means are used for their Instructi=
on in the Christian=20

Faith: I find the Numbers are prodigiously great; and am not a little troub=
led to observe how small=20

a Progress has been made in a Christian country, towards the delivering tho=
se poor Creatures=20

from the Pagan Darkness and Superstition in which they were bred, and the m=
aking them=20



Partakers in the Light of the Gospel, and the Blessings and Benefits belong=
ing to it. And what is=20

yet more to be lamented, I find there has not only been very little Progres=
s made in the work but=20

that all Attempts toward it have been by too many industriously discouraged=
 and hindered; partly=20

by magnifying the Difficulties of the Work beyond what they really are; and=
 partly by mistaken=20

Suggestions of the Change which Baptism would make in the Condition of the =
Negroes, to the=20

Loss and Disadvantage of their Masters.  As to the Difficulties; it may be =
pleaded, That the=20

Negroes are grown Persons when they come over, and that having been accusto=
med to the=20

Pagan Rites and Idolatries of their own Country, they are prejudiced agains=
t all other Religions,=20

and more particularly against the Christian, as forbidding all that Licenti=
ousness which is usually=20

practiced among the Heathens.... But a farther Difficulty is that they are =
utter Strangers to our=20

Language, and we to theirs; and the Gift of Tongues being now ceased, there=
 is no Means left of=20

instructing them in the Doctrines of the Christian Religion. And this, I ow=
n is a real Difficulty, as=20

long as it continues, and as far as it reaches. But, if I am rightly inform=
ed, many of the Negroes,=20

who are grown Persons when they come over, do of themselves obtain so much =
of our Language,=20

as enables them to understand, and to be understood, in Things which concer=
n the ordinary=20

Business of Life, and they who can go so far of their own Accord, might dou=
btless be carried much=20

farther, if proper Methods and Endeavors were used to bring them to a compe=
tent Knowledge of=20

our Language, with a pious view to instructing them in the Doctrines of our=
 Religion. At least, some=20

of them, who are more capable and more serious than the rest, might be easi=
ly instructed both in=20

our Language and Religion, and then be made use of to convey Instruction to=
 the rest in their own=20

Language. And this, one would hope, may be done with great Ease, wherever t=
here is a hearty=20

and sincere Zeal of the Work.  But what Difficulties there may be in instru=
cting those who are=20

grown-up before they are brought over; there are not the like Difficulties =
in the Case of their=20

Children, who are born and bred in our Plantations, who have never been acc=
ustomed to Pagan=20

Rites and Superstitions, and who may easily be trained up, like all other C=
hildren, to any=20

Language whatsoever, and particularly to our own; if the making them good C=
hristians be=20

sincerely the Desire and Intention of those, who have Property in them, and=
 Government over=20

them.--Dalcho's _An Historical Account of the Protestant Episcopal Church i=

104-106.   ANOTHER PASTORAL LETTER OF BISHOP GIBSON OF LONDON  To the=20

Missionaries in the English Plantations (about 1727).  DEAR BROTHER,  Havin=
g understood by=20

many Letters from the Plantations, and by the Accounts of Persons who have =
come from thence,=20

that very little progress hath hitherto been made in the conversion of the =
Negroes to the Christian=20

Faith; I have thought it proper for me to lay before Masters and Mistresses=
 the Obligations they=20

are under, and to promote and encourage that pious and necessary Work....  =
As to those Ministers=20

who have Negroes of their own; I cannot but esteem it their indispensable D=
uty to use their best=20

Endeavors to instruct them in the Christian Religion, in order to their bei=
ng baptised; both because=20

such Negroes are their proper and immediate Care, and because it is in vain=
 to hope that other=20

Masters and Mistresses will exert themselves in this Work, if they see it w=
holly neglected, or but=20

coldly pursued, in the Families of the Clergy ...  I would also hope that t=
he Schoolmasters in the=20

several Parishes, part of whose Business it is to instruct Youth in the Pri=
nciples of Christianity,=20

might contribute somewhat towards the carrying on of this Work; by being re=
ady to bestow upon it=20

some of their Leisure Time, and especially on the Lord's Day, when both the=
y and the Negroes are=20



most at liberty and the Clergy are taken up with the public Duties of their=
 Function.--Dalcho's _An=20

OP=20

SECKER OF LONDON IN 1741  "The next Object of the Society's Concern, were t=
he poor=20

Negroes. These unhappy Wretches learn in their Native Country, the grossest=
 Idolatry, and the=20

most savage Dispositions: and then are sold to the best Purchaser: sometime=
s by their Enemies,=20

who would else put them to Death; sometimes by the nearest Friends, who are=
 either unable or=20

unwilling to maintain them. Their Condition in our Colonies, though it cann=
ot well be worse than it=20

would have been at Home, is yet nearly as hard as possible: their Servitude=
 most laborious, their=20

Punishments most severe. And thus many thousands of them spend their whole =
Days, one=20

Generation after another, undergoing with reluctant Minds continual Toil in=
 this World, and=20

comforted with no Hopes of Reward in a better. For it is not to be expected=
 that Masters, too=20

commonly negligent of Christianity themselves, will take much Pains to teac=
h it their slaves; whom=20

even the better Part of them are in a great Measure habituated to consider,=
 as they do their Cattle,=20

merely with a view to the Profit arising from them. Not a few, therefore, h=
ave openly opposed their=20

Instruction, from an Imagination now indeed proved and acknowledged to be g=
roundless, that=20

Baptism would entitle them to Freedom. Others by obliging them to work on S=
undays to provide=20

themselves Necessaries, leave them neither Time to learn Religion, nor any =
Prospect of being=20

able to subsist, if once the Duty of resting on that Day become Part of the=
ir Belief. And some, it=20

may be feared, have been averse to their becoming Christians because after =
that, no Pretence will=20

remain for not treating them like Men. When these Obstacles are added to th=
e fondness they have=20

for their old Heathenish Rites, and the strong Prejudices they must have ag=
ainst Teachers from=20

among those, whom they serve so unwillingly; it cannot be wondered, if the =
Progress made in their=20

Conversion prove slow. After some Experience of this kind, Catechists were =
appointed in two=20

Places, by Way of Trial for Their Instruction alone: whose Success, where i=
t was least, hath been=20

considerable; and so great in the Plantation belonging to the Society that =
out of two hundred and=20

thirty, at least seventy are now Believers in Christ. And there is lately a=
n Improvement to this=20

Scheme begun to be executed, by qualifying and employing young Negroes, pru=
dently chosen, to=20

teach their Countrymen: from which in the Opinion of the best Judges, we ma=

hitherto sat in=20

Darkness, will see great Light."--Seeker's _A Sermon Preached before the In=

se and plenty; and=20

surely we owe them a return of what is just and equal for the drudgery and =
hardships they go=20

through in our service....  "It is objected, They are such stubborn creatur=
es, there is no dealing with=20

them.  "_Answer_. Supposing this to be true of most of them (which I believ=
e will scarcely be=20

insisted on:) may it not fairly be asked, whence doth this stubbornness pro=
ceed?--Is it from=20

nature?--That cannot be:--for I think it is generally acknowledged that _ne=
w Negroes_, or those=20

born in and imported from the coast of _Guinea_, prove the best and most tr=
actable servants. Is it=20



then from education?--for one or the other it must proceed from.--But pray =
who had the care of=20

bringing up those that were born here?--Was it not ourselves?--And might no=
t an early care, of=20

instilling good principles into them when young, have prevented much of tha=
t stubbornness and=20

untractableness you complain of in country-born negroes?--These, you cry ou=
t, are wickeder than=20

the others:--and, pray, where did they learn that wickedness?--Was it not a=
mong ourselves?--for=20

those who come immediately from their own country, you say, have more simpl=
icity and honesty.=20

A sad reproach to a Christian people indeed! that such poor ignorant heathe=
ns shall bring better=20

morals and dispositions from home with them, that they can learn or actuall=
y do contract amongst=20

us!         *       *       *       *       *  "It is objected,--they are s=
o ignorant and unteachable, they cannot=20

be brought to any knowledge in these matters.  "_Answer_. This objection se=
ems to have little or=20

no truth in it, with respect to the bulk of them.--Their ignorance, indeed,=
 about matters of religion,=20

is not to be disputed;--they are sunk in it to a sad and lamentable degree,=
 which has been shown=20

to be chiefly owing to the negligence of their owners.--But that they are s=
o stupid and unteachable,=20

as that they cannot be brought to any competent knowledge in these matters,=
 is false, and=20

contrary to fact and experience. In regard to their work, they learn it, an=
d grow dexterous enough=20

in a short time. Many of them have learned trades and manufactures, which t=
hey perform well, and=20

with sufficient ingenuity:--whence it is plain they are not unteachable; do=
 not want natural parts=20

and capacities.--Most masters and mistresses will complain of their art and=
 cunning in contriving to=20

deceive them.--Is it reasonable to deny then they can learn what is good, w=
hen it is owned at  She=20

started. =E2=80=9CWhy do you say that?=E2=80=9D she asked, with a quick fad=
ing of the new-born hope.  =E2=80=9CQuietly as=20

we have lived here,=E2=80=9D Henri resumed, =E2=80=9Cwe are not quite unkno=
wn. Every one is aware that I am the=20

son of Henri Charles de Talmont, who died for his King in La Vend=C3=A9e. I=
 have no favour to hope.=20

On the contrary, I think M. le Maire would be glad to see me with a musket =
on my shoulder.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf=20

that be the case,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence returned sadly, =E2=80=9Cat least =
we may thank God that he cannot tamper=20

with the numbers.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe numbers we are to draw? They matte=
r less than you think. The lists=20

_must_ be filled up; and so many young men have been taken already that few=
 enough are left to=20

choose from now. In any case, our little village will have to contribute it=
s full quota; and even=20

should _I_ succeed in escaping, some other luckless lad will have to go in =
my place.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is not the=20

misfortune of serving as a soldier that you want to escape, but the dishono=
ur, nay the sin, of=20

serving a usurper.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, Cl=C3=A9mence=E2=80=9D-- He paus=
ed.  =E2=80=9CWell, brother?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is no sin to fight for=
=20

France,--for France, not for Napoleon.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is no Franc=
e,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence returned proudly--=E2=80=9Cno=20

France that we can recognize apart from the King of France, Louis Dix-huit.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf whom _I_ know=20

no more than F=C3=A9ron or Bonin knows of the Emperor of Russia.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CWhat does that matter? What do=20

you mean, Henri?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat we think F=C3=A9ron and Bonin a co=
uple of fools because they are longing to=20

go and destroy the Emperor of Russia, about whom they know nothing. Are _we=
_ so much wiser if=20

we let ourselves be destroyed for a king of France about whom we know just =
as little?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNot for=20

_a_ king of France, but for _the_ King,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence answered gen=
tly. =E2=80=9CAnd not alone for the King,=20

but for truth, and loyalty, and God.=E2=80=9D  No more was said; for at tha=
t moment they heard the voice of=20

Madame de Talmont, who, having finished her letter, called her daughter to =
read it. Henri stood yet=20

beside the window; but it was not the quiet wintry scene without which was =
passing before the=20

boy=E2=80=99s anxious eyes. He saw instead his mother=E2=80=99s peaceful ho=
me invaded by ruthless soldiers; he=20

heard the clank of their spurs, the tread of their feet upon the stair, the=
ir oaths, their threats as they=20



sought everywhere for him, the fugitive. He saw--he heard much more--his dw=
elling given over to=20

pillage--_that_, perhaps, might be borne; but his mother, his sister, expos=
ed to all the wrongs and=20

insults a lawless soldiery could inflict, and _had_ inflicted in like cases=
! No; he could not risk it. Not=20

for all the kings of France that ever wore a crown! Better serve Napoleon--=
better a thousand times!=20

And, after all, what was Napoleon--what were emperors and kings, to him and=
 his? What was=20

death on the battle-field? He had always heard that such a death was honour=
able and noble, and=20

at all events a man could die but once. But the deserter=E2=80=99s fate was=
 only terrible; suffering without=20

glory, =E2=80=9Cthe pang without the palm.=E2=80=9D From those dreary fortr=
ess prisons where the =E2=80=9Crefractory=E2=80=9D toiled=20

in the garb of convicts, fed on bread and water, with shaven heads and fett=
ered feet, no man ever=20

came forth alive.  Days wore on, bringing the dreaded morning that was to d=
ecide the fate of the=20

conscripts. Madame de Talmont wrapped her mantle around her and took the ar=
m of her son.=20

Cl=C3=A9mence also was prepared to accompany them to the village. Henri, wh=
o looked very pale,=20

attempted a remonstrance. =E2=80=9CThe place will be crowded to-day,=E2=80=
=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIt is not fit for _you_,=20

mother, or for Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=80=9D  But they would not listen. =E2=80=
=9CThere is no country lad,=E2=80=9D said his mother,=20

=E2=80=9Cwho will not have his people with him to-day to learn his fate; an=
d shall De Talmont go to the=20

drawing alone, as if no one cared for him?=E2=80=9D  As they passed along, =
they could not avoid hearing=20

the mocking remarks which were exchanged by the peasants of Brie when they =
saw the proud=20

aristocrats, whose lives had flowed on for years beside yet apart from thei=
r own, forced at last into=20

fellowship with their neighbours by a common hope and fear. The silk of Mad=
ame de Talmont=E2=80=99s=20

mantle, well-worn yet unmistakably elegant, rubbed against the homespun gow=
n of the baker=E2=80=99s=20

widow, and both faces were pale with one anxiety.  =E2=80=9CAh, madame, the=
re=E2=80=99s little chance for us this=20

time,=E2=80=9D said Widow Simon. =E2=80=9C_They_ like it, the young folk. _=
They_ know no better. But God help the=20

old!=E2=80=9D  A crowd of women were standing together in the town hall, wh=
ile the young men went inside=20

into the mayor=E2=80=99s office to draw each his number from the box. Witho=
ut, in the village street, a band=20

was playing martial airs, and people were shouting, =E2=80=9CVive l=E2=80=
=99Empereur!=E2=80=9D  Every minute or two some=20

one came out of the office, swaggering or downcast, as the case might be. W=
idow Simon=E2=80=99s son=20

had drawn a very high number, which made him comparatively safe; and Madame=
 de Talmont felt=20

glad ever afterwards that she congratulated the mother. Mathieu F=C3=A9ron =
came out waving his cap=20

triumphantly, and shouting, =E2=80=9CVive l=E2=80=99Empereur! I am going to=
 fight the Russians! Hammer and tongs,=20

good-bye!=E2=80=9D  Then Henri came. He was calm, but a few shades paler th=
an before. He showed his=20

number--_eleven_. No one spoke; but a moment after Cl=C3=A9mence touched hi=
s arm and whispered=20

hurriedly, =E2=80=9CCome out into the air. Our mother is growing faint.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet us go home,=E2=80=9D said Madame de=20

Talmont, sighing heavily. The crowd was increasing every moment, and the di=
n and tumult were=20

deafening. With some impatience Henri pushed aside those who stood in his p=
ath, and there was=20

a sharp ring in his voice as he said, =E2=80=9CMake way, make way, good peo=
ple!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COh yes; make way for=20

the new conscript. How well M. de Talmont will look in the awkward squad!=
=E2=80=9D cried some one.=20

F=C3=A9ron had crossed the street to the little inn opposite the Mairie, an=
d was about to drink the=20

Emperor=E2=80=99s health in a cup of good red wine, a practice much in favo=
ur with the conscripts, but=20

before tasting it he pushed through the throng, and offered the brimming go=
blet to Henri. =E2=80=9CDrink, M.=20

de Talmont,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CWe are all comrades now, and the soo=
ner we learn good fellowship the=20

better.=E2=80=9D  Henri pushed the cup aside without a word; but Cl=C3=A9me=
nce spoke gently to the village lad.=20

=E2=80=9CIt is not that my brother would not drink with you, Mathieu,=E2=80=
=9D she said; =E2=80=9Cbut he is troubled just now,=20



and so are we--like your mother and your sisters.=E2=80=9D  No other word w=
as spoken until the De=20

Talmonts reached their home, and even then very few. Madame de Talmont and =
Cl=C3=A9mence=20

arranged everything, and Henri seemed quite passive in their hands. Accordi=
ng to their plan, he=20

was to leave the cottage after nightfall, and travelling on foot by unfrequ=
ented ways, to try to reach=20

the neighbourhood of their old home in the Bocage, where the faithful Grand=
pierre, who had been=20

their father=E2=80=99s steward, would receive and protect him. A little mon=
ey and a change of linen were=20

concealed about his person, but on no account must he look like a traveller=
. So long had Madame=20

de Talmont contemplated the necessity for this journey that she was able to=
 give her son the=20

fullest and clearest directions.  At length all was done. The last meal was=
 eaten together, or at=20

least a pretence was made of eating it. Henri embraced his mother, and rece=
ived her parting=20

blessing; then Cl=C3=A9mence, wrapping a shawl around her, said, =E2=80=9CT=
he night is fine; I will go with you=20

to the stile of the far corn-field.=E2=80=9D  They walked along in silence.=
 They had worlds to say to each=20

other, and this might be their last opportunity on earth, yet neither found=
 a word. Not until the=20

parting-place was reached did Cl=C3=A9mence whisper, as she slipped a purse=
 into her brother=E2=80=99s hand,=20

=E2=80=9CThere are five napoleons, Henri; you will be sure to want them. An=
d oh! write to us as soon as=20

you can. I will try to cheer and comfort our mother. Just one word more, de=
arest of brothers. Pray=20

to God, seek to have him for your friend; then, whatever happens=E2=80=9D--=
 But here her voice failed=20

utterly.  Henri threw his arms around her, and his voice was hoarse and cha=
nged, very unlike his=20

own. =E2=80=9CCl=C3=A9mence,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cpromise me one thin=
g.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat, _whatever happens_, you=
 will=20

not hate or curse me, or call me traitor, but forgive and love me still; th=
at you will plead with my=20

mother to forgive me=E2=80=9D--  =E2=80=9CForgive you! love you still! What=
 can you mean, Henri? It is not possible=20

we should ever change to each other. Not--_possible_,=E2=80=9D she sobbed, =
clinging to him, and straining=20

him to her heart in an embrace that seemed as if no power on earth could su=
nder it.  Somehow or=20

other Henri freed himself at last. He said in a kind of choked whisper, =E2=
=80=9CRemember my words.=20

Good-bye, and God--your God--bless you.=E2=80=9D One last lingering look, a=
nd he turned away, ran=20

quickly down the sloping corn-field, and was soon lost to sight.  But he di=
d not take the path that=20

Cl=C3=A9mence supposed. He returned to the village by a circuitous route, a=
nd about midnight tapped=20

gently at the cur=C3=A9=E2=80=99s door. The priest was evidently on the wat=
ch, for he opened the door and=20

admitted him at once, then shut and bolted it, and extinguished the light h=
e had kept burning in his=20

window as a guide to his expected guest.     CHAPTER XI.  ONE OF HALF A MIL=
LION.    =E2=80=9CIt is not=20

youth that turns     From the field of spears again,   For the boy=E2=80=99=
s high heart too proudly burns=20

Till it rests among the slain.=E2=80=9D   It was evening in a crowded barra=
ck-room in Paris. Recruits, not yet=20

clad in uniform, but wearing the blouses or the coarse fustian jackets they=
 had brought from their=20

native villages, chatted, drank, quarrelled, or dozed upon the benches or a=
bout the floor. One=20

noisy fellow was singing the Marseillaise at the top of his voice, another =
was defying any man in=20

France to beat him at single-stick, but by far the greater number seemed di=
spirited and utterly=20

weary.  A young lad had seated himself at the table, beneath one of the lam=
ps which, at long=20

distances, lit up the darkness of the great bare room. Writing materials we=
re before him, and he=20

had begun a letter, but paused, as if unable to proceed, and shaded his fac=
e with his hand.=20

Presently the tears dropped slowly down between his fingers, blistering the=
 paper; then once more=20

he seized the pen, and wrote eagerly and rapidly:--  =E2=80=9CDearest mothe=
r, forgive me. I could not--no, I=20

could not expose you and Cl=C3=A9mence to the terrible sufferings inflicted=
 upon the families of the=20



refractory, even if, for myself, I was strong enough to encounter the horro=
rs of a convict prison.=20

There was no way but the way I took. M. le Cur=C3=A9 answered for me to the=
 maire, and concealed me=20

in his house until marching orders came. As we started in the gray dawn of =
a winter=E2=80=99s morning, I=20

hoped to pass unnoticed; but so many villagers were there to bid farewell t=
o their friends, that I=20

know you must have heard all. Mother, Cl=C3=A9mence, pray for me; and oh, m=
other, forgive me if you=20

can! It is not for Napoleon I am going to fight, but for France.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CConscript, do you want that letter=20

put into the post to-night?=E2=80=9D asked a short, thick-set, red-haired m=
an with a corporal=E2=80=99s badge on his=20

sleeve; =E2=80=9Cbecause, if you do, I am going out, and I am a very obligi=
ng fellow.=E2=80=9D  Henri looked up=20

quickly. He might perhaps have doubted the corporal=E2=80=99s word, but fiv=
e or six other letters which he=20

held in his hand seemed to corroborate his statement; besides, he knew that=
 for him there would=20

be no leave to go out that night.  =E2=80=9CThen I shall be very much oblig=
ed to you, corporal,=E2=80=9D he said.=20

=E2=80=9CQuick with you then. Sign your name and give it to me. I cannot wa=
it all night. You may make my=20

compliments to your sweetheart while you are about it, however.=E2=80=9D  H=
enri hastily folded and sealed=20

his letter, and put it in the corporal=E2=80=99s outstretched hand.  =E2=80=
=9CPeste, man!=E2=80=9D said the other impatiently;=20

=E2=80=9Cwhere is the postage?=E2=80=9D  Henri took out half a franc. =E2=
=80=9CThat is it, I think,=E2=80=9D he said, without noticing the=20

signs one of his comrades was making to attract his attention. The corporal=
 flung the coin upon the=20

table, and caught it again, as if to try whether it was genuine, muttered a=
 curse, and went his way.=20

=E2=80=9CFool!=E2=80=9D said Henri=E2=80=99s neighbour. =E2=80=9CDid you no=
t see he wanted something to drink? What else should=20

he take your letter for? Look out for yourself on parade to-morrow; he will=
 do you a mischief if he=20

can.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd who cares?=E2=80=9D cried the chanter of the Ma=
rseillaise. =E2=80=9CWe want no aristocrats among us.=20

=E2=80=98=C3=87=C3=A0 ira! =C3=A7=C3=A0 ira!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe=
 want no bad companions either,=E2=80=9D said F=C3=A9ron, who was standing =
near, =E2=80=9Cso you=20

may keep your breath for your eternal =E2=80=98=C3=87=C3=A0 ira,=E2=80=99 G=
uillaume St. Luc.=E2=80=9D Then, going over to Henri, he=20

sat down beside him, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in a low voi=
ce, =E2=80=9CKeep up your=20

heart, M. de Talmont. Who knows but you have a marshal=E2=80=99s b=C3=A2ton=
 in your knapsack?=E2=80=9D  Henri felt=20

grateful for the kind words, and perhaps yet more so for the form of addres=
s, which had not fallen=20

upon his ear since the miserable morning when he marched out of Brie--a con=
script. He placed his=20

white, delicate hand in the rough palm of the blacksmith=E2=80=99s son. =E2=
=80=9CYou are a good comrade,=E2=80=9D he said.=20

=E2=80=9CI vowed you should find me that, the day Mademoiselle Cl=C3=A9menc=
e spoke to me so kindly,=E2=80=9D=20

returned F=C3=A9ron.  =E2=80=9CBut as to the marshal=E2=80=99s b=C3=A2ton,=
=E2=80=9D resumed Henri, =E2=80=9Cthat is a fine story. Six feet of=20

Russian clay to lie in is what more of us are likely to get, I fancy.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CNo good comes of burying=20

ourselves before we are dead,=E2=80=9D returned the cheery F=C3=A9ron. =E2=
=80=9COf course, some are killed in every=20

war. It is their luck. If a Russian bullet has my name upon it, why, then, =
I shall have the consolation=20

of falling in the greatest war of the greatest captain that ever lived. I s=
hall see his eagles flap their=20

wings over Moscow and St. Petersburg. I shall die in the hour of victory, a=
nd I shall die shouting,=20

=E2=80=98Vive l=E2=80=99Empereur!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D In fact, the last words=
 so nearly approached a shout already, that they were=20

taken up and re-echoed by those around.  Then F=C3=A9ron resumed his low to=
ne. =E2=80=9CM. de Talmont, may=20

I give you a word of advice?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCertainly, comrade.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CWhen you hear other people shouting,=20

always shout too; and the greater fools you think them, the louder you ough=
t to shout, if only by=20

way of drowning their foolish voices.=E2=80=9D  For the first time since th=
e day of the conscription Henri=20

laughed; and F=C3=A9ron presently continued, =E2=80=9CBut as for me, I do n=
ot shout =E2=80=98Vive l=E2=80=99Empereur!=E2=80=99 like a=20

fool. I know very well what I am about. I am only a conscript, it is true, =
but I am a soldier. The=20

whole world is before me, and if I am brave, active, and resolute, the mars=
hal=E2=80=99s b=C3=A2ton is no=20



impossible dream for me. If we had lived in the old times, M. de Talmont, y=
ou would have ridden a=20

fine horse and worn a beautiful sword; and I should have been like the dust=
 beneath your feet--a=20

private all my days, and no more. Thanks to the Revolution and the Empire, =
we have changed all=20

that; so now we can be good comrades, as you have been kind enough to say.=
=E2=80=9D  Good comrades=20

they were through many a dreary day of drill and marching. At first the phy=
sical hardships of his=20

life weighed so heavily upon Henri that thought and feeling were almost cru=
shed into silence.=20

When he halted for the night, after a long day=E2=80=99s march, he was scar=
cely conscious of anything=20

except weary limbs and blistered feet. During his stay at the dep=C3=B4t in=
 Metz, where the conscripts=20

had to go through some preliminary training, things were scarcely better. T=
he moral and the=20

mental atmosphere of the barrack-room were alike abhorrent to his refined, =
sensitive nature; while=20

the cruel and degrading punishments that followed any failure in skill or q=
uickness on the parade-

ground, forced him to bend all his remaining energies to the task of avoidi=
ng them. No answer to=20

his letter from Paris ever reached him, and this added to the dull apathy t=
hat was creeping over his=20

soul. His mother, he feared, was implacable. And Cl=C3=A9mence?--perhaps hi=
s mother would not allow=20

her to write, perhaps she herself was too deeply offended to make the attem=
pt.  At last marching=20

orders came once more. Strange to say, from that day the heavy cloud of glo=
om that hung over=20

Henri began to lighten. Change of scene proved a tonic, and as he grew accu=
stomed to long=20

marches he ceased to suffer so greatly from fatigue. Like other young consc=
ripts who did not=20

droop and fail utterly, he gradually plucked up strength and spirits. As he=
 was uniformly gentle and=20

courteous--no ordinary merit in a French soldier of the Empire--he often me=
t with much kindness=20

from the families upon whom he was billeted; and the extreme youthfulness o=
f his appearance=20

gained many friends for him. By the time he reached the headquarters of the=
 imperial army, the=20

profession into which he had been forced was rather an object of indifferen=
ce than of detestation=20

to him. When the recruits were reviewed by Napoleon in person, he remembere=
d the sage advice=20

of F=C3=A9ron, and did not imagine that a cry of =E2=80=9CVive l=E2=80=99Em=
pereur!=E2=80=9D from the lips of a De Talmont would=20

awaken the slumbering dust of his ancestors. Moreover, he could not but gaz=
e, with a kind of=20

fascination that had in it as much of admiration as of horror, upon the fac=
e of the man whose will at=20

that moment was the most stupendous force in all the world. Henri de Talmon=
t did not love=20

Napoleon Buonaparte--he feared him, perhaps he hated him--but, like almost =
every other man in=20

Europe, he believed him irresistible. There was a sense of exhilaration in =
the universal feeling that=20

to march under him was infallibly to march to victory. Some faint reflected=
 glow from the=20

enthusiasm of all around could not fail to reach him and to awaken stirring=
s of the martial ardour=20

that slumbered in the son of a long line of gallant warriors.  An unknown u=
nit in a regiment of=20

infantry--young recruits who as yet had won no laurels--Henri de Talmont ma=
rched one day over a=20

temporary wooden bridge which had been flung by French pontoniers across th=
e Niemen. =E2=80=9CNow,=20

mes enfants,=E2=80=9D their captain said, =E2=80=9Cyou are standing upon Ru=
ssian ground.=E2=80=9D  They cheered,=20

embraced one another, and shouted until they were hoarse, =E2=80=9CVive l=
=E2=80=99Empereur! vive Napoleon! A=20

bas les Russes!=E2=80=9D Henri shouted as loudly as the rest; while, at lea=
st to the human eye, coming=20

events cast no shadow before, nor was there any foreboding voice raised to =
whisper, as that vast=20

and gallant host passed by,--    =E2=80=9CThe snow shall be their winding-s=
heet,   And every turf beneath=20

their feet     Shall be a soldier=E2=80=99s sepulchre!=E2=80=9D     CHAPTER=
 XII.  ONE OF FIFTY MILLION.    =E2=80=9CThe=20

might that slumbers in a peasant=E2=80=99s arm.=E2=80=9D   A great battle, =
and a great victory--this was what Henri=20



de Talmont, in common with the six hundred thousand fighting men who crosse=
d the Niemen=20

under Napoleon, fully expected to see. Young hearts kindled, young blood gr=
ew hot at the thought;=20

while the veterans of Lodi, of Austerlitz, of Jena, saw their cherished lau=
rels fade and pale before=20

the lustre of those with which they hoped soon to adorn their victorious br=
ows. And then how=20

royally would the treasures of Moscow and St. Petersburg recompense all the=
ir toils!  But there=20

was no great battle. The Russians, under Barclay de Tolly, retreated withou=
t fighting, skilfully=20

drawing the enemy after them into the immense and dreary plains of the inte=
rior. Then followed a=20

succession of marches, as wearisome and far more monotonous than those by w=
hich the recruits=20

had reached the headquarters of their army. The weather was hot and sultry-=
-a curious first=20

experience of the climate of Russia--and both men and horses suffered from =
the want of water.=20

Other wants, too, were supplied but carelessly, or perhaps not at all. Many=
 a conscript lay down=20

supperless night after night beside the fire of his bivouac, to sleep away =
his hunger as best he=20

could. It is said that some even died of starvation, while others found unw=
holesome nutriment in=20

the unripe corn and the raw vegetables that grew along their route. Nor did=
 the knowledge that the=20

general of his division was feasting upon sterlet and champagne make the ha=
rd, insufficient fare of=20

the conscript more palatable. =E2=80=9CIt is the soldier=E2=80=99s own faul=
t if he wants anything in an enemy=E2=80=99s=20

country,=E2=80=9D was a maxim often repeated; but what can the soldier do w=
hen the people flee at his=20

approach, carrying off or destroying everything they possess, and the count=
ry, at best but thinly=20

inhabited, is left a desert around him?[23] Yet it must be owned that the F=
rench had themselves to=20

thank for some of their privations, since those peasants who did not flee a=
t their approach were=20

plundered, beaten, ill-treated, perhaps even murdered.  One day Henri accom=
panied a=20

detachment of his regiment which was sent out on a foraging expedition. The=
y were under the=20

command of Seppel, the corporal who had undertaken to post Henri=E2=80=99s =
letter in Paris; but he was a=20

sergeant now, and rode a good horse, while the others tramped wearily on fo=
ot. After a long march=20

through a dreary country they saw, towards evening, a brown village surroun=
ded by promising=20

corn-fields. =E2=80=9CCourage, mes enfants,=E2=80=9D cried Seppel; =E2=80=
=9Chere is luck for us at last. No doubt food and=20

water, ay, and brandy too, are to be found yonder.=E2=80=9D  They marched a=
cross the fields, trampling=20

down the standing corn without remorse. Henri and some of his comrades were=
 hungry enough to=20

pluck the unripe ears and to eat them as they passed, like another company =
strangely opposite to=20

these in their character and their place in the world=E2=80=99s history.  A=
s they approached the village, they=20

became aware that its inhabitants had not only seen them, but were prepared=
 for their approach. A=20

crowd of men and boys, armed with axes, pitchforks, and reaping-hooks, came=
 towards them with=20

loud cries and intentions evidently the most hostile.  Seppel caught hold o=
f a tall, gaunt soldier,=20

whose white uniform gleamed conspicuous amongst the blue tunics of the rest=
, and pushed him to=20

the front. =E2=80=9CHere, Klinki, Schlinki, or whatever your unpronounceabl=
e name may be, tell these=20

beggars in their own jargon that we want food for man and horse, and that i=
f they give it, in plenty=20

and at once, we will do them no harm.=E2=80=9D  The Pole--who had been brou=
ght with the party to act as=20

interpreter, as he happened to know a little Russian--tried to gain a heari=
ng; but in vain. So the=20

Frenchmen drew their swords, and a brisk fight began. Suddenly, however, Se=
ppel observed=20

something which made him call upon his men to stop. He saw a party leaving =
the village and=20

proceeding towards the adjoining birch-wood, and he rightly conjectured tha=
t these were the=20

women and children under the escort of some of the men who had remained beh=
ind for the=20



purpose. In fact, this had been from the first the design of the villagers,=
 and the attack had been=20

only a feint made in order to gain time for its execution. Seppel raised hi=
s hand, pointing to the=20

retreating group. =E2=80=9CFire, mes enfants!=E2=80=9D he cried; =E2=80=9Cf=
ire yonder--upon them!=E2=80=9D They were just within=20

musket-range, and the sharp, ringing sound of the shots was followed by hea=
rt-rending cries.=20

There was no more thought of resistance. The village lads threw down their =
extemporized=20

weapons, and hurried to the assistance of their friends. Soon the whole par=
ty, their movements=20

quickened by terror, had disappeared into the wood, carrying with them thei=
r wounded, perhaps=20

their dead. =E2=80=9CWas not that well done?=E2=80=9D laughed Seppel. =E2=
=80=9CI knew they would go to look after the=20

women at the first cry.=E2=80=9D  Thus Nicolofsky was taken by the French. =
The victors were soon busy=20

exploring the deserted cottages in search of food and vodka. Other things t=
oo were needed.=20

=E2=80=9CHere, blacksmith,=E2=80=9D said Seppel to F=C3=A9ron, =E2=80=9Cloo=
k after my horse. He has cast a shoe.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes,=20

sergeant,=E2=80=9D returned F=C3=A9ron coolly, =E2=80=9Cif you will find me=
 a hammer and tongs, and a nail or two.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIs=20

that my business, stupid? Go and look. These fellows have horses, so they m=
ust have smith=E2=80=99s=20

tackle somewhere about.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd they call this conquering a =
country!=E2=80=9D grumbled F=C3=A9ron as he walked=20

away. =E2=80=9CWell, it may be glorious, but it is not particularly conveni=
ent or amusing.=E2=80=9D  At that moment=20

there was a joyful shout from some of the party. Very few fires were burnin=
g in the village on that=20

warm summer evening, but in one of the two largest cottages the great stove=
 had been lighted,=20

and a capacious caldron of tschi was simmering over it. The French soldiers=
 fully appreciated the=20

national dish of the Russians, and found the prospect of an abundant and sa=
voury supper very=20

agreeable.  =E2=80=9CHere is one good thing for me,=E2=80=9D said F=C3=A9ro=
n, glancing at the fire. =E2=80=9CNow for hammer and=20

nails.--Talmont, you lazy fellow, don=E2=80=99t stand there gazing at nothi=
ng, but come and help me to find=20

them.=E2=80=9D  But when they stood outside together, F=C3=A9ron=E2=80=99s =
tone changed. =E2=80=9CM. Henri,=E2=80=9D he said in a=20

quick, eager whisper, =E2=80=9Cshow me your musket.=E2=80=9D  Henri did so =
with a smile.  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said F=C3=A9ron, looking=20

relieved, =E2=80=9Cthen after all you _did_ fire. I feared you would not, a=
nd I was going to give you a word=20

of advice.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI _did_ fire,=E2=80=9D answered Henri in a lo=
w voice,--=E2=80=9Cin the air. What _else_ could I do,=20

F=C3=A9ron? they were women and children.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, perhaps =
_I_ did not shoot very straight either; still=20

we are in an enemy=E2=80=99s country. Why did not the Czar do whatever the =
Emperor wanted him? But=20

take care, M. Henri; that old fox Seppel is no friend of yours.=E2=80=9D  T=
hey entered another cottage in=20

search of what they wanted, and F=C3=A9ron struck his foot against a small =
bucket full of some liquid.=20

=E2=80=9CHa! what have we here? Vodka, I hope.=E2=80=9D He stooped down and=
 tasted it, but got up with an air of=20

disgust. =E2=80=9CNo such luck. Only frog=E2=80=99s ratefia=E2=80=9D (so th=
e French called the kvass of the Russians). =E2=80=9CHow=20

could any poor wretches be expected to fight with such stuff as that in the=
ir insides?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLet me=20

have a pull at it,=E2=80=9D said Henri. =E2=80=9CI am thirsty enough not to=
 despise even frog=E2=80=99s ratefia. Do you think=20

Seppel means to stay here all night?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe ought not; but i=
f he finds vodka I would not answer for=20

the consequences. And certainly it is growing very late.=E2=80=9D  F=C3=A9r=
on at last succeeded in finding the=20

tools with which the villagers performed whatever rude blacksmith=E2=80=99s=
 work they needed. Then he=20

rejoined his companions, who were just beginning to help themselves to the =
supper which had=20

been prepared for very different guests by the priest=E2=80=99s wife. The c=
ottage was that of Pope Nikita,=20

and the day happened to be the name-day of Anna Popovna.  A good store of v=
odka had been=20

found, and with this help the soldiers soon forgot their troubles, past, pr=
esent, and to come. They=20

ate, drank, and made merry; and the sergeant, far from being any check upon=
 their mirth, drank=20

more deeply and talked more boisterously than any of them. The night closed=
 over them=20



unawares, and of course there was now no question of leaving their comforta=
ble quarters until the=20

morning.  F=C3=A9ron had brought in his hand a small piece of iron, as well=
 as the hammer and tongs he=20

had been using. He had a jesting dispute with one of his comrades, who call=
ed in question his=20

capabilities as a blacksmith. =E2=80=9CBlacksmith, indeed!=E2=80=9D said F=
=C3=A9ron. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s nothing. I am quite an artist,=20

messieurs. At Brie I was accounted a connoisseur--an ornamental worker in b=
rass, iron, and the=20

other precious metals.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA fine story,=E2=80=9D laughed He=
nri, who was greatly the better for his=20

comfortable meal. =E2=80=9CAt Brie your crooked nails were a joke for the w=
hole village.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t talk, but let=20

us _see_ what you can do. Give us a specimen,=E2=80=9D said a conscript, a =
timorous little fellow, who was=20

unpopular in the regiment because of his habit of shifting off his work upo=
n his comrades.  =E2=80=9CYes, I=20

will,=E2=80=9D returned F=C3=A9ron. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll make an iron to b=
rand you with when you are caught trying to desert, as=20

you are sure to be one of these days.=E2=80=9D  A general laugh followed th=
is retort, then silence fell over=20

the group, while F=C3=A9ron hammered away at his task, and most of the othe=
rs began to doze in their=20

places. When at last he held up triumphantly, in proof of his skill, a fine=
ly-formed branding-iron with=20

the letter N upon it, his companions were far too sleepy to give him the ap=
plause he expected.=20

One hour--two hours passed away. All were sleeping now, even the sentinels =
Seppel had placed=20

outside as a matter of form. The village of Nicolofsky was as still as it w=
as wont to be in the noon=20

of a midsummer night. If a sound of weeping and lamentation came, softened =
by distance, from=20

the adjacent birch-wood, it failed to disturb the sleepers. But the short s=
ummer night was soon=20

over, and the dawn began to creep in, cold and gray.  Its first faint light=
 fell upon the figure of a=20

mujik, who traversed, with stealthy, silent footsteps, the deserted street =
of his native village. As he=20

passed the church he noticed that the door had been forced open--though it =
was again roughly=20

secured on the outside. He removed the fastening and looked in. The spirit =
of wanton outrage,=20

only too common amongst the French soldiery, had made Seppel choose that sa=
cred place as a=20

stable for his horse, and the animal was eating corn out of a consecrated v=
essel placed upon the=20

altar.[24] Michael Ivanovitch ground his teeth, and his dark cheek flushed =
ominously; but he=20

passed on, for his heart was full of a great, deep anguish, before which ev=
ery other emotion paled=20

and faded.  That which, at the risk of his life, he had come to fetch, was =
not in the desecrated=20

church. It had to be sought for in the very place where most of the French =
soldiers had taken up=20

their quarters for the night--the cottage of Pope Nikita. The door of the c=
ottage was half open, and=20

he saw that the floor was covered with sleeping forms clad in the blue tuni=
c of the French infantry.=20

What matter to him? Blotting out that sight, he saw the wistful, longing lo=
ok in the dying eyes of the=20

girl he loved, and, before him, the sacred picture her faltering accents ha=
d entreated him to bring=20

to her. Thank God, there it hung yet--on the cottage wall, in the right-han=
d corner. Could he tread=20

amongst those sleepers without awakening them, and reach it?  His step was =
noiseless as the=20

footfall of the desert panther, and the French were weary with marching, an=
d most of them heavy=20

with vodka. He had grasped his prize--he stood with his hand on its frame, =
and a momentary throb=20

of triumph in his sorrowful heart, when=20


_
they can be so artful in what is bad?--Their ignorance, therefore, if born =
in the country, must=20

absolutely be the fault of their owners:--and such as are brought here from=
 Africa may, surely, be=20

taught something of advantage to their own future state, as well as to work=
 for their masters'=20

present gain.--The difference plainly consists in this;--that a good deal o=
f pains is taken to shew=20

them how to labour, and they are punished if they neglect it.--This sort of=
 instruction their owners=20

take care to give them every day, and look well to it that it be duly follo=
wed.--But no such pains are=20

taken in the other case.--They are generally left to themselves, whether th=
ey will serve God, or=20

worship Devils--whether they become christians, or remain heathens as long =
as they live: as if=20

either their souls were not worth the saving, or as if we were under no obl=
igation of giving them=20

any instruction:--which is the true reason why so many of them who are grow=
n up, and lived many=20

years among us, are as entirely ignorant of the principles of religion, as =
if they had never come=20

into a christian country:--at least, as to any good or practical purposes. =

"I have dwelt the longer upon this head, because it is of the utmost import=

 the many vices and=20

immoralities so common among white people;--the lewdness, drunkenness, quar=
relling,=20

abusiveness, swearing, lying, pride, backbiting, overreaching, idleness, an=
d sabbath-breaking,=20

everywhere to be seen among us, are a great encouragement to our Negroes to=
 do the like, and=20

help strongly to confirm them in the habits of wickedness and impiety.  "We=
 ought not only to avoid=20

giving them bad examples, and abstain from all appearance of evil, but also=
 strive to set a daily=20

aimed, the children surely=20

are in our power, and may be trained up in the way they should go, with rat=
ional hopes that when=20

they are old, they will not depart from it.--We ought, therefore, to take c=
harge of their education=20

principally upon ourselves, and not leave them entirely to the care of thei=
r wicked parents.--If the=20

present generation be bad, we may hope by this means that the succeeding on=
es will be much=20

better. One child well instructed, will take care when grown up to instruct=
 his children; and they=20

again will teach their posterity good things.--And I am fully of opinion, t=
hat the common notion of=20

_wickedness running in the blood_, is not so general in fact as to be admit=
ted for an axiom. And=20

that the vices we see descending from parents to their children are chiefly=
 owing to the malignant=20

influence of bad example and conversation.--And though some persons may be,=
 and undoubtedly=20

are, born with stronger passions and appetites, or with a greater propensit=

FAWCETT's ADDRESS TO THE CHRISTIAN NEGROES IN VIRGINIA ABOUT 1755  "Rejoice=
=20

and be exceeding glad, that you are delivered either from the Frauds of Moh=

those other dead Men, whom the was raised; some one more wakeful than the r=

intruder. In an instant the alarm was given, and the whole group were on th=
eir feet; in another, a=20

dozen strong hands were laid at once upon Michael Ivanovitch.  He struggled=
 desperately, but=20

what could one man do against a dozen armed with swords and bayonets? He wo=
uld have been=20

cut down almost immediately, had not Seppel, very sensibly, called upon his=
 men to spare his life=20

and secure him as a prisoner. =E2=80=9CHe may serve for a guide, or at leas=

determined face, as the light of the early morning shone upon it. He had pl=
aced the sacred picture=20

in the breast of his caftan; but seeing the musket, he took it out and laid=
 it on the table. =E2=80=9CThey shall=20

satisfy us, we will shoot him; but that if he behaves well, we will spare h=
is life.=E2=80=9D  The Pole=20

interpreted, and Michael answered coolly, =E2=80=9CNitshevo.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThat means,=E2=80=9D the Pole explained, =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98It is no=
=20

matter. I do not care.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAsk him,=E2=80=9D pursue=
d Seppel, =E2=80=9Cwhat brought him here.=E2=80=9D  Michael, as soon as=20

he understood the question, pointed to the picture.  Seppel laughed incredu=
lously; and the Pole=20

inquired of his own accord, =E2=80=9CIs that the whole truth, Russian?=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CDa,=E2=80=9D returned the prisoner.  =E2=80=9CHe=20

says, =E2=80=98Yes,=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D the Pole explained.  =E2=80=9CTell hi=
m he is a liar,=E2=80=9D said Seppel.  A scornful smile was the only=20

answer, and Seppel tried another course. =E2=80=9CAsk him,=E2=80=9D he said=
, =E2=80=9Chow far it is from this place to=20

Klopti.=E2=80=9D  He did so; but Michael answered nothing.  =E2=80=9CTell h=
im he must take us there to-day.=E2=80=9D  Still no=20

answer.  =E2=80=9CTell him if he chooses to behave in this way he has not t=
wo minutes to live.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNitshevo,=E2=80=9D=20

was the only reply.  This went on for some minutes, every inquiry being met=
 by a dogged silence,=20

every threat by =E2=80=9CNitshevo.=E2=80=9D At last Seppel lost patience, a=
nd told F=C3=A9ron to fire upon the prisoner.=20

But F=C3=A9ron disliked the task, for he rather admired the courage of the =
Russian. He slowly laid his=20

finger on the trigger of his musket, then withdrew it again. This he did tw=
ice, keenly watching the=20

countenance of the prisoner, which showed no perceptible change. All the Fr=
ench soldiers had=20

now crowded around them, and were watching the scene with interested faces.=
  =E2=80=9CDo not kill him,=20

sergeant,=E2=80=9D pleaded one.  =E2=80=9CHe is a brave fellow. Try somethi=
ng else first,=E2=80=9D said another.  Seppel=20

paused, and a new thought occurred to him. =E2=80=9CAh, yes,=E2=80=9D he sa=
id, =E2=80=9Cthese Russian slaves understand=20

nothing except it comes to them through their bodily feelings. They are acc=
ustomed, I suppose, to=20

be treated like beasts of the field.--Pole, tell him he is our prisoner; _t=
hat_, at least, we will make=20



him know.--F=C3=A9ron, put down your musket, and bring that branding-iron I=
 saw you make last night;=20

there is enough fire yet in the stove to heat it red-hot.=E2=80=9D  F=C3=A9=
ron obeyed without hesitation, even with=20

alacrity; for it seemed to him much better to brand a man on the hand than =
to shoot him through=20

the heart. So the letter N, fashioned in sport the night before, was used i=
n earnest now. It came=20

down with burning pain, and left its mark, indelible for ever, upon the unr=
esisting hand of Michael.=20

For a moment his strong frame quivered, but his lips were silent, pressed c=
losely together. Then=20

he turned to the Pole, and, for the first time speaking of his own accord, =
he asked him, =E2=80=9CWhat does=20

that mean?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt means that you belong now, soul and body, =
to our Emperor, the great Napoleon.=20

That which you bear on your hand is his mark--the first letter of his name.=
=E2=80=9D  Michael smiled slightly,=20

and advancing to the table, laid the wounded hand upon it. (F=C3=A9ron not =
unintentionally had made=20

choice of the left one.) Then with one blow from the axe which he drew from=
 the sash of his caftan,=20

he severed it from his wrist. =E2=80=9CTake what belongs to your Emperor,=
=E2=80=9D he said, turning proudly to the=20

astonished group. =E2=80=9CAs for me, I belong altogether to the Czar.=E2=
=80=9D[25]  A thrill of involuntary=20

admiration passed through the spectators, and for some moments no one spoke=
. Meanwhile, in=20

the calm summer sky outside, the sun was rising, and its first red beams fl=
ashed through the little=20

window upon the homely features of the serf, which shone with a courage and=
 devotion that were=20

almost sublime.  =E2=80=9CCut him down!=E2=80=9D cried a solitary voice, th=
at of the conscript who, the night before,=20

had challenged F=C3=A9ron=E2=80=99s skill. But half-a-dozen other voices cr=
ied, =E2=80=9CShame!=E2=80=9D while Seppel himself=20

seemed to hesitate, and stood with the air of a man perplexed and confounde=
d.  In the meantime=20

Henri de Talmont, who had hitherto taken no part in the scene, walked boldl=
y up to the prisoner.=20

He held in his hand a fine white cambric handkerchief, which he wound caref=
ully about the=20

wounded arm. =E2=80=9CAs you love your Czar,=E2=80=9D he said gently, =E2=
=80=9Cso we Royalists in France loved our King.=E2=80=9D=20

The words, of course, fell meaningless upon=20


_
Jesus Christ, the one only Mediator between God and Men. Christ, tho' he wa=
s dead, is alive=20

again, and liveth forever-more. It is Christ, who is able also to save them=
 to the uttermost, that=20

come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. =
Bless God, with all=20

your Heart, that the Holy Scriptures are put into your Hands, which are abl=
e to make you wise unto=20

Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Christ Jesus. Read and study the Bible f=
or yourselves; and=20

consider how Papists do all they can to hide it from their Followers, for F=
ear such divine Light=20

should discover the gross Darkness of their false Doctrines and Worship. Be=
 particularly thankful=20

to the Ministers of Christ around you, who are faithfully labouring to teac=
h you the Truth as it is in=20

Jesus....  "Contrary to these evident Truths and precious Comforts of the W=
ord of God, you may=20

perhaps be tempted very unjustly to renounce your Fidelity and Obedience to=
 your Old Masters, in=20

Hope of finding new ones, with whom you may live more happily. At one time =
or other it will=20

probably be suggested to you, that the French will make better Masters than=
 the English. But I=20

beseech you to consider, that your Happiness as Men and Christians exceedin=
gly depends upon=20

your doing all in your Power to support the British Government, and that ki=
nd of Christianity which=20

is called the Protestant Religion; and likewise in opposing, with all your =
Might, the Power of the=20

French, the Delusions of Popish Priests, and all the Rage and Malice of suc=
h Indians, as are in the=20

French Interest. If the Power of France was to prevail in the Country where=
 you now live, you have=20

Nothing to expect but the most terrible Increase of your Sufferings. Your S=
lavery would then, not=20

merely extend to Body, but also to the Soul; not merely run thro' your Days=
 of Labour, but even=20

thro' your Lord's Days. Your Bibles would then become like a sealed Book, a=
nd your Consciences=20

would be fettered with worse than Iron-Chains. Therefore be patient, be sub=
missive and obedient,=20

be faithful and true, even when some of your Masters are most unkind. This =
is the only way for you=20

to have Consciences void of Offense towards God and Man. This will really b=

effectual Measures, to secure for yourselves a Share in the invaluable Bles=
sings and Privileges of=20

the glorious Gospel of the Blessed God, which you have already received thr=

T FROM THE=20

APPENDIX OF BENJAMIN FAWCETT'S "ADDRESS TO THE CHRISTIAN NEGROES IN=20

VIRGINIA"  "The first Account, I ever met with, of any considerable Number =
of Negroes embracing=20

the Gospel, is in a letter written by Mr. Davies, Minister at Hanover in Vi=
rginia, to Mr. Bellamy of=20

Bethlehem in New England, dated June 28, 1751. It appears that the Letter w=
as designed for=20

Publication; and I suppose, was accordingly printed at Boston in New Englan=
d. It is to be seen in=20

vol. ii., pages 330-338, of the _Historical Collections_ relating to remark=
able Periods of the=20

Success of the Gospel, and eminent Instruments employed in promoting it; Co=
mpiled by Mr. John=20

Gillies, one of the Ministers of Glasgow: Printed by Foulis in 1754. Mr. Da=
vies fills the greatest part=20

of his Letter, with an Account of the declining State of Religion in Virgin=
ia, and the remarkable=20



Means used by Providence to revive it, for a few Years before his Settlemen=
t there, which was in=20

1747; not in the character of a Missionary, but that of a dissenting Minist=
er, invited by a particular=20

People, and fixed with them. Such, he observes, was the scattered State of =
his Congregation, that=20

he soon found it necessary to license seven Meeting-Houses, the nearest of =
which are twelve or=20

fifteen Miles distant from each other, and the extremes about Forty; yet so=
me of his People live=20

twenty, thirty, and a few forty Miles from the nearest Meeting-House. He co=
mputes his=20

Communicants at about three Hundred. He then says, 'There is also a Number =
of Negroes. Some=20

times I see a Hundred and more among my Hearers. I have baptized about Fort=
y of them within=20

the last three Years, upon such a Profession of Faith as I then judged cred=
ible. Some of them, I=20

fear, have apostatized; but others, I trust, will persevere to the End. I h=
ave had as satisfying=20

Evidences of the sincere Piety of several of them, as ever I had from any P=
erson in my Life; and=20

their artless Simplicity, their passionate Aspirations after Christ, their =
incessant Endeavors to know=20

and do the Will of God, have charmed me. But, alas! while my Charge is so e=
xtensive, I cannot=20

take sufficient Pains with them for their Instruction, which often oppresse=
s my Heart....'"  At the=20

Close of the above Letter, in the _Historical Collections_ (vol. ii., page =
338), there is added the=20

following Marginal Note.--"May 22, 1754. Mr. G. Tennent and Mr. Davies bein=
g at Edinburgh, as=20

Agents for the Trustees of the College of New Jersey, Mr. Davies informs,--=
that when he left=20

Virginia in August last, there was a hopeful Appearance of a greater Spread=
 of a religious Concern=20

amongst the Negroes;--And a few weeks before he left Home, he baptized in o=
ne Day fifteen=20

Negroes, after they had been catechized for some Months, and given credible=
 Evidences of their=20

sincerely embracing the Gospel."  After these Gentlemen had finished the Bu=
siness of their late=20

Mission in this part of the World, Mr. the tones in which they were uttered=
, and the action which=20

accompanied them, were abundantly intelligible. The eyes of the Russian ser=
f and the French=20

gentleman met with a look of comprehension and sympathy.  =E2=80=9CShall we=
 let him go?=E2=80=9D Seppel asked=20

at length. =E2=80=9CWhat say you, mes enfants?=E2=80=9D  There was now not =
one dissentient voice, and Seppel=20

turned to the interpreter. =E2=80=9CTell him, Pole, that we Frenchmen know =
how to respect a brave enemy.=20

He is free.=E2=80=9D  Michael heard, bowed his head gravely in acknowledgme=
nt, took up the sacred=20

picture with his remaining hand, and walked slowly out. He scarcely noticed=
 the ringing cheer=20

which the excitable Frenchmen sent after him. Their applause was nothing to=
 him: it could not=20

bring back the young life of his betrothed, flowing forth so quickly throug=
h the wound their guns=20

had made last night. Enough if he might but be in time to see her once agai=
n, and to comfort her=20

dying moments with the treasure he had risked so much to procure.  When he =
was gone, Seppel=20

stretched his limbs once more before the stove, and said half to himself wi=
th a meditative air,=20

=E2=80=9CAfter all, I begin to doubt whether we shall succeed so easily in =
conquering these Russians.=E2=80=9D=20

CHAPTER XIII.  SERF AND BOYAR.    =E2=80=9CVengeance, deep brooding o=E2=80=
=99er the slain,     Had locked=20

the source of softer woe;   And burning pride and high disdain     Forbade =
the rising tear to flow.=E2=80=9D=20

It was evening. Ivan Pojarsky sat alone in the saloon of the Wertsch family=
 mansion. The costly=20

furniture with which it was strewn had that indescribable air of neglect an=
d forlornness which=20

household goods assume when death, or sorrow deep as death, broods over the=
ir owners. There=20

was disorder too: chairs had been dragged carelessly about, and their rich =
and delicate coverings=20

soiled and crumpled; while a beautiful climbing plant, laden with rare flow=
ers, lay unheeded on the=20

floor beside the broken shaft that had been its support. A costly buhl tabl=
e near Ivan=E2=80=99s chair had=20



the remains of his last meal upon it.  Within the apartment all was still,-=
-Ivan sat motionless and=20

silent, his head resting on his hands,--but without there was a hoarse, con=
tinuous, never-ending=20

murmur, made up of many sounds. There was the tramp of armed men, heavy and=
 monotonous.=20

There was the roll and rumble of ten thousand wheels--wheels of every sort =
and description, from=20

those of the ponderous waggon laden with the goods of an entire household t=
o those of the light=20

telega, from which every now and then a scout was imparting to the breathle=
ss crowd his tidings=20

that the standards of Napoleon had been seen at such or such a point of the=
 Smolensko road.=20

Mingling with and following the stately rhythmic march of the disciplined h=
osts was the tread of=20

innumerable footsteps--footsteps of women and little children, of boys and =
aged men, who were=20

leaving with breaking hearts the only home they had ever known. And if the =
weeping and wailing,=20

the sighs and groans and cries, which filled the clear September air did no=
t rise above all other=20

sounds, it was only because the things most deep and real are ofttimes the =
last to meet the eye or=20

reach the ear--except, indeed, the ever-present eye and the ever-listening =
ear of Him who notes=20

=E2=80=9Cthe sob in the dark and the falling of tears.=E2=80=9D  Suddenly I=
van raised his head and looked around=20

him. The last few weeks had changed him wonderfully. He appeared several ye=
ars older--no=20

longer a stripling, but a man, with a man=E2=80=99s responsibilities, thoug=
hts, and duties. There was in his=20

young face a look of sternness, as of one who had to do hard things and to =
bid others do them;=20

there was the high, courageous, half-defiant air of one who dares death che=
erfully, even joyfully,=20

and also an expression of proud though mournful satisfaction. For had not h=
e, a youth scarcely=20

twenty, been intrusted with a terrible secret, been charged with a desperat=
e but honourable=20

mission?  =E2=80=9CBeg pardon, gospodin,=E2=80=9D said a servant, entering.=
 Ivan was now virtually the master of=20

the household, for both the Wertsches were with the army--Adrian serving as=
 a volunteer, Leon as=20

a lieutenant of hussars. =E2=80=9CHere is a mujik,=E2=80=9D continued the s=
ervant, =E2=80=9Cwho wishes to speak with your=20

excellency.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CSend him in,=E2=80=9D said Ivan quickly. =E2=
=80=9CAnd--stay a moment, Joseph. What does your wife=20

say of her mistress?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe countess, gospodin, will not he=
ar reason from my wife, though she has=20

been waiting upon her these twenty years, any more than from your excellenc=
y. =E2=80=98The French,=E2=80=99 says=20

my lady, =E2=80=98will never enter holy Moscow. They dare not.=E2=80=99 I m=
ust own, Lord Ivan, that Maria thinks=20

this very hard; because if our lady the countess will not be persuaded to g=
o away, as all other folk=20

are doing who have brains in their heads, she--my wife I mean--must stay, t=
oo, of course, and be=20

murdered by the Nyemtzi.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMurdered by the Nyemtzi shall _=
our_ women never be, Joseph,=E2=80=9D said=20

Ivan, with a flash in his eyes. =E2=80=9CAt the worst, we know what to do. =
Tell thy wife the countess must be=20

induced to quit this house before to-morrow night. If she will not leave th=
e city, like a sensible=20

woman, at least she must go to the Devitshei Convent, and Maria must go wit=
h her. I suppose=20

even the infidel French will scarcely outrage _that_ asylum. Meanwhile, sen=
d in this mujik;=20

perhaps he brings tidings.=E2=80=9D  A tall figure entered, with a bandaged=
 arm, and wearing a rough,=20

soiled caftan, and heavy Russia leather boots that left their traces on the=
 inlaid floor.  Ivan looked=20

up, started, hesitated, then exclaimed in great surprise, =E2=80=9CMichael =
Ivanovitch! One-eared Michael!=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9COne-handed Michael now, at your service, Ivan Barrinka; and well i=
f _that_ were the only loss I=20

had to tell of.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHave you come from Nicolofsky?=E2=80=9D =
asked Ivan.  =E2=80=9CYes, I come from Nicolofsky.=20

Barrinka, the Nyemtzi have been there.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D crie=

them, Ivan Barrinka--I cannot find words--so I leave them to God. He knows =
what wages they have=20

earned, and he will pay them one day. But as for me, my heart is hot and dr=
y, and unless I can go=20



and fight and kill some of them I shall die.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat has=20


_
to his Correspondent in London, in a letter which he wrote in the Spring of=
 the previous Year, six=20

Weeks after his safe return to his Family and Friends.--"The Inhabitants of=
 Virginia are computed=20

to be about 300,000 Men, the one-half of which Number are supposed to be Ne=
groes. The=20

Number of those who attend my Ministry at particular Times is uncertain, bu=
t generally about three=20

Hundred who give a stated Attendance. And never have I been so much struck =
with the=20

Appearance of an Assembly, as when I have glanced my Eye to that Part of th=
e Meeting-House,=20

where they usually sit; adorned, for so it had appeared to me, with so many=
 black Countenances,=20

eagerly attentive to every Word they hear, and frequently bathed in Tears. =
A considerable Number=20

of them, about a Hundred, have been baptized, after the proper Time for Ins=
truction, and having=20

given credible Evidences, not only of their Acquaintance with the important=
 Doctrines of the=20

Christian Religion, but also a deep Sense of them upon their Minds, atteste=
d by a Life of the=20

strictest Piety and Holiness. As they are not sufficiently polished to diss=
emble with a good Grace,=20

they express the sentiments of their Souls so much in the Language of simpl=
e Nature, and with=20

such genuine Indications of Sincerity, that it is impossible to suspect the=
ir Professions, especially=20

when attended with a truly Christian Life and exemplary Conduct.--My worthy=
 Friend, Mr. Tod,=20

Minister of the next Congregation, has near the same Number under his Instr=
uctions, who, he tells=20

me, discover the same serious Turn of Mind. In short, Sir, there are Multit=
udes of them in different=20

Places, who are willing, and eagerly desirous to be instructed, and embrace=
 every Opportunity of=20

acquainting themselves with the Doctrines of the Gospel; and tho' they have=
 generally very little=20

Help to learn to read, yet, to my agreeable Surprise, many of them, by the =
Dint of Application in=20

their Leisure-Hours, have made such a Progress, that they can intelligibly =
read a plain Author, and=20

especially their Bibles; and Pity it is that many of them should be without=
 them. Before I had the=20
