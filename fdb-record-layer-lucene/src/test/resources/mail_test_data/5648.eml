the real existence       of such Schools, and judges by the Chinese travest=

such Esotericism "heterodox Buddhism." And so it is, in one       sense.   =

has lost the records of such Schools and their       teachings only so far =
as the general public, and=20

especially the       inappreciative Western Orientalists, are concerned. It=
 has preserved       them in=20

Adepts, or Mahatmas.    754=20

_Chinese Buddhism_, pp. 155-159.    755 They certainly reject most emphatic=

theory of the       transmigration of human entities or Souls _into_ animal=
s, but not       the=20

evolution of men _from_ animals--so far, at least, as their lower       pri=
nciples are concerned.=20

756 It is quite consistent, on the contrary, when explained in the light   =
    of the Esoteric Doctrine.=20

The "Western paradise," or Western heaven,       is no fiction located in t=
ranscendental space. It is=20

a _bona-fide_       locality in the mountains, or, to be more correct, one =
encircled in       a desert=20

within mountains. Hence it is assigned for the residence of       those stu=
dents of Esoteric Wisdom-

-disciples of Buddha--who have       attained the rank of Lohans and Anagam=
ins (Adepts). It is=20

called       "Western" simply from geographical considerations; and "the gr=
eat       iron mountain=20

girdle" that surrounds the Avitchi, and the seven       Lokas that encircle=
 the "Western paradise"=20

are a very exact       representation of well-known localities and things t=
o the Eastern       student=20

of Occultism.    757 The word is translated by the Orientalists as "true ma=
n without a       position,"=20

(?) which is very misleading. It simply means the true       inner man, or =
Ego, "Buddha _within_=20

novice's       head during his first ordination. It has a double-edged blad=
e, is       sharp as a razor,=20

and lies concealed within a hollow handle of horn.       By touching a spri=
ng the blade jerks out like=20

mad is the Tibetan name of Aryasanga, the founder of the       Yogacharya o=

School. This Sage and Initiate is said to       have been taught "Wisdom" b=
y Maitreya Buddha=20

Himself, the Buddha of       the Sixth Race, at Tushita (a celestial region=
 presided over by=20

Him), and as having received from Him the five books of       _Champaitehos=
-nga_. The Secret=20

Doctrine teaches, however, that he       came from Dejung, or Shambhalla, c=
alled the "source of=20

happiness"       ("wisdom-acquired") and declared by some Orientalists to b=
e a       "fabulous"=20

place.    764 It may not be, perhaps, amiss to remind the reader of the fac=
t that       the "mirror"=20

was a part of the symbolism of the Thesmophoria, a       portion of the Ele=
usinian Mysteries; and=20

that it was used in the       search for Atmu, the "Hidden One," or "Self."=
 In his excellent paper=20

on the above-named mysteries, Dr. Alexander Wilder of New York says:       =
"Despite the assertion=20

of Herodotus and others that the Bacchic       Mysteries were Egyptian, the=
re exists strong=20

probability that they       came originally from India, and were Shaivitic =
or Buddhistical.       Kore-

Persep-honeia was but the goddess Parasu-pani, or Bhavani, and       Zagreu=
s is from Chakra, a=20

country extending from ocean to ocean. If       this is a Turanian story we=
 can easily recognise the=20

'horns' as the       crescent worn by Lama-priests, and assume the whole le=
gend [the       fable of=20

Dionysus-Zagreus] to be based on Lama-succession and       transmigration..=
.. The whole story of=20



Orpheus ... has a Hindu ring       all through." The tale of "Lama-successi=
on and transmigration"=20

did       not originate with the Lamas, who date themselves only so far bac=
k       as the seventh=20

century, but with the Chaldaeans and the Brahmans,       still earlier.    =

 slept; not so the=20

servants---hungry, and more thirsty than hungry.  Blaisois and Mousqueton s=
et themselves to=20

preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise. On a hanging t=
able, which swung to=20

and fro with the rolling of the vessel, were a pot of beer and three glasse=
s.  "This cursed rolling!"=20

said Blaisois. "I know it will serve me as it did when we came over."  "And=
 to think," said=20

Mousqueton, "that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley brea=
d and hop beer. Pah!"=20

"But where is your wicker flask, Monsieur Mousqueton? Have you lost it?" as=
ked Blaisois.  "No,"=20

replied Mousqueton, "Parry kept it. Those devilish Scotchmen are always thi=
rsty. And you,=20

Grimaud," he said to his companion, who had just come in after his round wi=
th D'Artagnan, "are=20

you thirsty?"  "As thirsty as a Scotchman!" was Grimaud's laconic reply.  A=
nd he sat down and=20

began to cast up the accounts of his party, whose money he managed.  "Oh, l=
ackadaisy! I'm=20

beginning to feel queer!" cried Blaisois.  "If that's the case," said Mousq=
ueton, with a learned air,=20

"take some nourishment."  "Do you call that nourishment?" said Blaisois, po=
inting to the barley=20

bread and pot of beer upon the table.  "Blaisois," replied Mousqueton, "rem=
ember that bread is the=20

true nourishment of a Frenchman, who is not always able to get bread, ask G=
rimaud."  "Yes, but=20

beer?" asked Blaisois sharply, "is that their true drink?"  "As to that," a=
nswered Mousqueton,=20

puzzled how to get out of the difficulty, "I must confess that to me beer i=
s as disagreeable as wine=20

is to the English."  "What! Monsieur Mousqueton! The English--do they disli=
ke wine?"  "They hate=20

it."  "But I have seen them drink it."  "As a punishment. For example, an E=
nglish prince died one=20

day because they had put him into a butt of Malmsey. I heard the Chevalier =
d'Herblay say so."=20

"The fool!" cried Blaisois, "I wish I had been in his place."  "Thou canst =
be," said Grimaud, writing=20

down his figures.  "How?" asked Blaisois, "I can? Explain yourself."  Grima=
ud went on with his sum=20

and cast up the whole.  "Port," he said, extending his hand in the directio=
n of the first compartment=20



examined by D'Artagnan and himself.  "Eh? eh? ah? Those barrels I saw throu=
gh the door?"=20

"Port!" replied Grimaud, beginning a fresh sum.  "I have heard," said Blais=
ois, "that port is a very=20

good wine."  "Excellent!" exclaimed Mousqueton, smacking his lips. "Excelle=
nt; there is port wine=20

in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux."  "Suppose we ask these Eng=
lishmen to sell us a=20

bottle," said the honest Blaisois.  "Sell!" cried Mousqueton, about whom th=
ere was a remnant of=20

his ancient marauding character left. "One may well perceive, young man, th=
at you are=20

inexperienced. Why buy what one can take?"  "Take!" said Blaisois; "covet t=
he goods of your=20

neighbor? That is forbidden, it seems to me."  "Where forbidden?" asked Mou=
squeton.  "In the=20

commandments of God, or of the church, I don't know which. I only know it s=
ays, 'Thou shalt not=20

covet thy neighbor's goods, nor yet his wife.'"  "That is a child's reason,=
 Monsieur Blaisois," said=20

Mousqueton in his most patronizing manner. "Yes, you talk like a child--I r=
epeat the word. Where=20

have you read in the Scriptures, I ask you, that the English are your neigh=
bors?"  "Where, that is=20

true," said Blaisois; "at least, I can't now recall it."  "A child's reason=
--I repeat it," continued=20

Mousqueton. "If you had been ten years engaged in war, as Grimaud and I hav=
e been, my dear=20

Blaisois, you would know the difference there is between the goods of other=
s and the goods of=20

enemies. Now an Englishman is an enemy; this port wine belongs to the Engli=
sh, therefore it=20

belongs to us."  "And our masters?" asked Blaisois, stupefied by this haran=
gue, delivered with an=20

air of profound sagacity, "will they be of your opinion?"  Mousqueton smile=
d disdainfully.  "I=20

suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of the=
se illustrious lords to say,=20

'Gentlemen, your servant, Mousqueton, is thirsty.' What does Monsieur Braci=
eux care, think you,=20

whether I am thirsty or not?"  "'Tis a very expensive wine," said Blaisois,=
 shaking his head.  "Were=20

it liquid gold, Monsieur Blaisois, our masters would not deny themselves th=
is wine. Know that=20

Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine, even if ob=
liged to pay a pistole for=20

every drop." His manner became more and more lofty every instant; then he a=
rose and after=20

finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door =
of the compartment=20

where the wine was. "Ah! locked!" he exclaimed; "these devils of English, h=
ow suspicious they=20

are!"  "Locked!" said Blaisois; "ah! the deuce it is; unlucky, for my stoma=
ch is getting more and=20

more upset."  "Locked!" repeated Mousqueton.  "But," Blaisois ventured to s=
ay, "I have heard you=20

relate, Monsieur Mousqueton, that once on a time, at Chantilly, you fed you=
r master and yourself=20

by taking partridges in a snare, carp with a line, and bottles with a slipn=
oose."  "Perfectly true; but=20

there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles. I cannot th=
row the loop through this=20

partition nor move with a pack-thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weig=
h two hundred=20

pounds."  "No, but you can take out two or three boards of the partition," =
answered Blaisois, "and=20

make a hole in the cask with a gimlet."  Mousqueton opened his great round =
eyes to the utmost,=20

astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him cred=
it.  "'Tis true," he said; "but=20

where can I get a chisel to take the planks out, a gimlet to pierce the cas=
k?"  "Trousers," said=20

Grimaud, still squaring his accounts.  "Ah, yes!" said Mousqueton.  Grimaud=
, in fact, was not only=20

the accountant, but the armorer of the party; and as he was a man full of f=
orethought, these=20

trousers, carefully rolled up in his valise, contained every sort of tool f=
or immediate use.=20

Mousqueton, therefore, was soon provided with tools and he began his task. =
In a few minutes he=20

had extracted three boards. He tried to pass his body through the aperture,=
 but not being like the=20

frog in the fable, who thought he was larger than he really was, he found h=
e must take out three or=20



four more before he could get through.  He sighed and set to work again.  G=
rimaud had now=20

finished his accounts. He arose and stood near Mousqueton.  "I," he said.  =
"What?" said=20

Mousqueton.  "I can pass."  "That is true," said Mousqueton, glancing at hi=
s friend's long and thin=20

body, "you will pass easily."  "And he knows the full casks," said Blaisois=
, "for he has already been=20

in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan. Let Monsieur Grimaud go =
in, Monsieur=20

Mouston."  "I could go in as well as Grimaud," said Mousqueton, a little pi=
qued.  "Yes, but that=20

would take too much time and I am thirsty. I am getting more and more seasi=
ck."  "Go in, then,=20

Grimaud," said Mousqueton, handing him the beer pot and gimlet.  "Rinse the=
 glasses," said=20

Grimaud. Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton, that he might forg=
ive him for finishing=20

an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another, he glided like a serpent thr=
ough the opening and=20

disappeared.  Blaisois was in a state of great excitement; he was in ecstas=
ies. Of all the exploits=20

performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom=
 he had the honor to=20

be associated, this seemed without question to be the most wonderful.  "You=
 are about to see,"=20

said Mousqueton, looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority whic=
h the latter did not even=20

think of questioning, "you are about to see, Blaisois, how we old soldiers =
drink when we are=20

thirsty."  "My cloak," said Grimaud, from the bottom of the hold.  "What do=
 you want?" asked=20

Blaisois.  "My cloak--stop up the aperture with it."  "Why?" asked Blaisois=
.  "Simpleton!" exclaimed=20

Mousqueton; "suppose any one came into the room."  "Ah, true," cried Blaiso=
is, with evident=20

admiration; "but it will be dark in the cellar."  "Grimaud always sees, dar=
k or light, night as well as=20

day," answered Mousqueton.  "That is lucky," said Blaisois. "As for me, whe=
n I have no candle I=20

can't take two steps without knocking against something."  "That's because =
you haven't served,"=20

said Mousqueton. "Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick=
 up a needle on=20

the floor of a closed oven. But hark! I think some one is coming."  Mousque=
ton made, with a low=20

whistling sound, the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of=
 their youth, resumed his=20

place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example.  Blai=
sois obeyed.  The door of=20

their cabin was opened. Two men, wrapped in their cloaks, appeared.  "Oho!"=
 said they, "not in=20

bed at a quarter past eleven. That's against all rules. In a quarter of an =
hour let every one be in=20

bed and snoring."  These two men then went toward the compartment in which =
Grimaud was=20

secreted; opened the door, entered and shut it after them.  "Ah!"=20

ern Occultism blue is the=20

spiritual essence of       the colour purple, while red is its material bas=

Sun cannot correspond with the eye, nose, or any       other organ, since, =
as explained, it is no=20

planet, but a central       star. It was adopted as a planet by the post-Ch=
ristian Astrologers,       who=20

had never been initiated. Moreover, the true colour of the Sun       is blu=
e, and it appears yellow=20

only owing to the effect of the       absorption of vapours (chiefly metall=
ic) by its  "Grimaud's a=20

cunning fellow," murmured Mousqueton.  They waited for ten minutes, during =
which time no noise=20

was heard that might indicate that Grimaud was discovered, and at the expir=
ation of that anxious=20

interval the two men returned, closed the door after them, and repeating th=
eir orders that the=20

servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights, disappeared.  "Shall=
 we obey?" asked=20

Blaisois. "All this looks suspicious."  "They said a quarter of an hour. We=
 still have five minutes,"=20

replied Mousqueton.  "Suppose we warn the masters."  "Let's wait for Grimau=
d."  "But perhaps=20

they have killed him."  "Grimaud would have cried out."  "You know he is al=
most dumb."  "We=20

should have heard the blow, then."  "But if he doesn't return?"  "Here he i=
s."  At that very moment=20

Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his fac=
e livid, his eyes=20

staring wide open with terror, so that the pupils were contracted almost to=
 nothing, with a large=20

circle of white around them. He held in his hand a tankard full of a dark s=
ubstance, and=20

approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single mono=
syllable: "Oh!" with=20

such an expression of extreme terror that Mousqueton started, alarmed, and =
Blaisois was near=20

fainting from fright.  Both, however, cast an inquisitive glance into the t=
ankard--it was full of=20

gunpowder.  Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a =
cargo of wine,=20

Grimaud hastened to awake D'Artagnan, who had no sooner beheld him than he =
perceived that=20

something extraordinary had taken place. Imposing silence, Grimaud put out =
the little night lamp,=20

then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant's ear a recital melodramatic=
 enough not to require=20

play of feature to give it pith.  This was the gist of his strange story:  =
The first barrel that Grimaud=20



had found on passing into the compartment he struck--it was empty. He passe=
d on to another--it,=20

also, was empty, but the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it g=
ave out, evidently full. At=20

this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet=
, when he found a=20

spigot; he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout; some=
thing, whatever it was=20

the cask contained, fell silently into the tankard.  Whilst he was thinking=
 that he should first taste=20

the liquor which=20

Maya on our Earth.    792 Esoterically, indigo, or dark blue, which is the =
complement of       yellow=20

in the prism. Yellow is a simple or primitive colour. Manas       being dua=
l in its nature--as is its=20

sidereal symbol, the planet       Venus, which is both the morning and even=
ing star--the difference=20

between the higher and the lower principles of Manas, whose essence       i=
s derived from the=20

Hierarchy ruling Venus, is denoted by the dark       blue and green. Green,=
 the Lower Manas,=20

resembles the colour of the       solar spectrum which appears between the =
yellow and the dark=20

blue,       the Higher Spiritual Manas. Indigo is the intensified colour of=
 the       heaven or sky, to=20

denote the upward tendency of Manas toward Buddhi,       or the heavenly Sp=
iritual Soul. This=20

colour is obtained from the       _indigofera tinctoria_, a plant of the hi=
ghest occult properties in=20

India, much used in White Magic, and occultly connected with copper.       =
This is shown by the=20

indigo assuming a copper lustre, especially       when rubbed on any hard s=
ubstance. Another=20

property of the dye is       that it is insoluble in water and even in ethe=
r, being lighter in       weight=20

than any known liquid. No symbol has ever been adopted in the       East wi=
thout being based=20

upon a logical and demonstrable reason.       Therefore Eastern Symbologist=
s, from the earliest=20

ages, have       connected the spiritual and the animal minds of man, the o=
ne with       dark blue=20

(Newton's indigo), or true blue, free from green; and the       other with =
pure green.    793=20

Esoterically, yellow, because the colour of the Sun is orange, and       Me=
rcury now stands next to=20

the Sun in distance, as it does in       colour. The planet for which the S=
un is a substitute was still=20

nearer the Sun than Mercury now is, and was one of the tankard contained be=
fore taking it to his=20

companions, the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his h=
ands and enveloped in=20

a cloak, came and stood just before the hogshead, behind which Grimaud, on =
hearing him come=20

in, instantly crept. This was Groslow. He was accompanied by another man, w=
ho carried in his=20

hand something long and flexible rolled up, resembling a washing line. His =
face was hidden under=20

the wide brim of his hat. Grimaud, thinking that they had come, as he had, =
to try the port wine,=20

effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection th=
at if he were discovered=20

the crime was not a great one.  "Have you the wick?" asked the one who carr=
ied the lantern.=20

"Here it is," answered the other.  At the voice of this last speaker, Grima=
ud started and felt a=20

shudder creeping through his very marrow. He rose gently, so that his head =
was just above the=20

round of the barrel, and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of=
 Mordaunt.  "How long=20

will this fuse burn?" asked this person.  "About five minutes," replied the=
 captain.  That voice also=20

was known to Grimaud. He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he=
 recognized=20

Groslow.  "Then tell the men to be in readiness--don't tell them why now. W=
hen the clock strikes a=20

quarter after midnight collect your men. Get down into the longboat."  "Tha=
t is, when I have lighted=20

the match?"  "I will undertake that. I wish to be sure of my revenge. Are t=
he oars in the boat?"=20

"Everything is ready."  "'Tis well."  Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one =
end of the train to the=20

spigot, in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at =
the opposite end with the=20

match.  He then arose.  "You hear me--at a quarter past midnight--in fact, =
in twenty minutes."  "I=20

Esoterically, violet, because, perhaps, violet is the colour assumed       =
by a ray of sunlight when=20

transmitted through a very thin plate of       silver, and also because the=
 Moon shines upon the=20

Earth with light       borrowed from the Sun, as the human body shines with=
 qualifications=20

borrowed from its double--the aerial man. As the astral shadow starts      =
 the series of principles in=20

man, on the terrestrial plane, up to the       lower, animal Manas, so the =
violet ray starts the series=20

of       prismatic colours from its end up to green, both being, the one as=
 a       principle and the=20

other as a colour, the most refrangible of all the       principles and col=
ours. Besides which, there is=20

the same great       Occult mystery attached to all these correspondences, =
both celestial       and=20

terrestrial bodies, colours and sounds. In clearer words, there       exist=
s the same law of relation=20

between the Moon and the Earth, the       astral and the living body of man=
, as between the violet=20

what you undertake; would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set=

dear Groslow," answered Mordaunt, "you know the French proverb, 'Nothing on=
e does not do=20

one's self is ever well done.' I shall abide by that rule."  Grimaud had he=
ard all this, if he had not=20

understood it. But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehe=
nsion of the=20

language. He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers, had seen Mo=
rdaunt adjust the=20

fuse; he had heard the proverb, which Mordaunt had given in French. Then he=
 felt and felt again=20

the contents of the tankard he held in his hand; and, instead of the lively=
 liquor expected by=20

Blaisois and Mousqueton, he found beneath his fingers the grains of some co=
arse powder.=20

Mordaunt went away with the captain. At the door he stopped to listen.  "Do=
 you hear how they=20

sleep?" he asked.  In fact, Porthos could be heard snoring through the part=
ition.  "'Tis God who=20

gives them into our hands," answered Groslow.  "This time the devil himself=
 shall not save them,"=20

rejoined Mordaunt.  And they went out together.     72. End of the Port Win=

waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied t=
hat he was alone he=20

slowly rose from his recumbent posture.  "Ah!" he said, wiping with his sle=
eve large drops of sweat=20

from his forehead, "how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty!"  He made=
 haste to pass out by=20

the opening, still thinking himself in a dream; but the sight of the gunpow=
der in the tankard proved=20

to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare.  It may be imagined that D'Art=
agnan listened to these=20

details with increasing interest; before Grimaud had finished he rose witho=
ut noise and putting his=20

mouth to Aramis's ear, and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to=
 prevent a sudden=20

movement:  "Chevalier," he said,=20

easily aroused Athos, whose sleep was light, like that of all persons of a =
finely organized=20
