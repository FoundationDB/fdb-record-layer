dracaena marginata together in peace and amity."  A slow smile was spreading itself over the strong face of the railway magnate as he listened.  "Say, David," he retorted mildly, "it isn't much like you to the "Big Four" repaired to the upper deck. They seated themselves in the little tender of the Maud, and all of them looked out in the direction of the cape, from beyond which the pirate dracaena marginata together in peace and amity."  A slow smile was spreading itself over the strong face of the railway magnate as he listened.  "Say, David," he retorted mildly, "it isn't much like you to the "Big Four" repaired to the upper deck.

candidate for attorney-general, you simply haven't another man in the party to put up against him. 

You'd have to run in a dummy, and even you are not big enough to do that, Blount, and put it 

over."  "You've settled this definitely in your own mind, have you, Hardwick?" was the placable 

rejoinder. "I'm sorry--right sorry. I've been hoping that you had learned your not take my nap till we 

have overhauled the situation, and figured up where the pirate may be about this time in the 

forenoon," replied Scott, as he led the way to the cabin.  As Pitts was waiting on the table, nothing 

particular was said. Don had his morning meal carried to him on the forecastle, where Felipe 

joined him. He kept his eye fixed on the cape all the time, as

this evening prepared to show you a decent way out of your troubles, so far as this State is 

concerned; but since you have posted your 'de-fi,' as we cow-punchers say, I reckon it isn't worth 

while to wade any deeper into the creek."  Again the railroad magnate rested his arms on the 

table-edge. "What was your 'decent way,' Senator?" he asked, fixing his gaze upon the shrewd old 

eyes of the other, which, for the first time in the conference, seemed to be losing a little of their 

grimly good-natured aggressiveness.  "I don't mind telling you, though you will likely call it an old 

man's foolishness. I have a grown son, McVickar. Did you know that?"  The vice-president 

nodded, and the big man opposite went on half-reminiscently:  "He is a lawyer, and a mighty bright 

one, so they tell me. As I happen to know, he is pretty well up on the corporation side of the 

argument, and the one thing I've been afraid of is that he would marry and settle down somewhere 

in the East, where the big expected to see the Fatime double it. He knew nothing at all about the 

real situation, though he could not help seeing that the Maud was trying to keep clear of the 

Moorish steamer; and he was in full sympathy with this idea.  The larder of the little steamer had 

been filled up at Alexandria, and Pitts had prepared one of his best breakfasts. The party were in 

high spirits; for the little Maud had run away from the pirate, though of course there were other 

chapters to the narrative.  "As soon as we get the situation a little more settled, and you fellows 

get your eyes braced wide open, one of you must tackle the island of Cyprus, and get up a lecture 

on it; for the commander desired that we should learn something about the place," said the 

captain.  "I move you, Mr. Commander, that Mr. Louis Belgrave be invited to prepare and deliver 

the lecture," interposed Morris; and the motion was put and carried.  "I have no objection; and my 

own curiosity would have prompted me to do so without

ranches. I'm getting old, Hardwick, and I'd like mighty well to have the boy with me. Out of that 

notion grew another. I said to myself this: Now, here's McVickar; if he could have a good, clean-

cut young man in this State representing his railroad--a man who not only knew his way around in 

a court-room, but who might also know how to plead his client's case before the public--if 

McVickar could have such a young fellow as that for his corporation counsel, and would agree to 

make his railroad company live somewhere within shouting distance of such a young fellow's 

ideals, we might all me in the selection," replied Louis; and the company adjourned to the 

forecastle.  "Well, Don, have you seen anything of the Moorish craft?" asked the captain.  "Not a 

sign, sir," replied the engineer. "If she is looking for the Maud, I don't believe she will find her in 

here very soon."  "I don't believe this is just the place to hold a consultation on a delicate subject," 

said Louis, as he pointed to the scuttle which had been removed from its place by Felipe. "I think 

we shall do better on the hurricane deck."  As this afforded a better place to observe the 

surroundings, and
