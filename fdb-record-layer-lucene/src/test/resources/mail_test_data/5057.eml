Gathering up their fish, they once more started for home.  The battle with =
the wolves had not taken more than a few minutes, although, as Bobby now to=
ld his father, it had seemed a long, long while to him.  "I was so afraid t=

of the Hushby Marches, and Earl of Kisington. Moreover, whomsoever and wher=
esoever you=20

choose to wed, I myself will attend the nuptials and will bestow upon the b=
ride a countess's crown=20

of diamonds. Long live the hero of Hushby and Earl of Kisington!"  "Long li=
ve the hero of Hushby=20

and Earl of Kisington!" echoed all the guests. The Dragon hissed spitefully=
 and lashed out with his=20

tail, but no one paid any attention to him. Oscar, sulking with elbows on k=
nees, groaned squeakily.=20

But no one paid any attention to him either.  Everybody was thinking of Art=
hur, and how=20

wonderfully he had become a hero. But Arthur himself was thinking of little=
 Margot at the inn, and=20

how sweet her face would look under the coronet of a countess. And Arthur g=
rinned happily.    VII.=20

BARGAIN  You must not suppose that Harold read this whole story to the besi=
eging King without=20

pause.  When he reached the end of the first part of the tale, Harold close=
d the red-and-gold=20

volume and looked up.  "Go on!" urged the Red King. "Why do you stop, boy?"=
  "It is the end of the=20

volume," said Harold.  Red Rex frowned. "Surely, not the end of the tale!" =
he cried. "Why, you=20

have stopped short in the middle! That Oscar was up to some trick, I know. =
I want to hear what=20

happened next."  "I am sorry, Your Majesty," repeated Harold. "It is the en=
d of the volume. The=20

rest of the tale is told in another book."  The Red King's eyes blazed with=
 anger. "Why did you not=20

bring the other book with you?" he roared.  "I was not sure that Your Majes=
ty would like the tale,"=20

said Harold. "Besides, they will allow one to take from the library but one=
 book at a time  Bobby=20

Bear was struggling in the water, trying to swim to shore. It was pretty ha=
rd work, for the fish on=20

the end of his line was nearly as big as he.  At first Father Bear thought =
it was just an ordinary little=20

fish on Bobby's line. Besides he knew his boy could swim so he thought he w=
ould let him get back=20

to shore by himself. He wanted to teach Bobby Bear to depend on himself on =
all occasions.=20

Suddenly he saw a great fish flop up out of the water and then he realized =
what a monster Bobby=20

had on his line. He immediately threw down his fish line and plunged in to =
his son's rescue. With a=20

few strokes of his powerful arms he reached Bobby Bear.  Grasping the boy-b=
ear around the=20

waist, he drew him to land. The fish, caught as it was on the hook, couldn'=
t help coming too.  My,=20

but it was a wonderful fish. Bobby was indeed very proud to think he had ca=
ught such a big fish.=20

"No wonder I fell into the water, father, with such a big fellow on my line=
," he said.  "Yes,"=20

answered his father, "that's the biggest fish I have seen in these parts fo=
r many a year. Your=20

mother will certainly fix up a feast for us with that fish. She can stuff i=
t and add a few slices of nice,=20

sweet bacon."  "Yum, yum," said Bobby, "it makes my mouth water to think ab=
out it. Can't we go=20

right home now?"  "Oh, no," said his father. "The fish are biting so well t=
oday, we had better stay a=20

while longer. Besides it will give us a chance to dry our clothes, sitting =
here in this hot sun. I don't=20

want you to catch cold, you know. It's shady all the way home through the w=
oods."  "But what will=20

we do with the big fish? He's liable to get away. Just=20


_
"Then you must return and get the next volume immediately," commanded Red R=
ex. "I must know=20

what happened to Arthur in his quest of the Dragon. Take the flag of truce =
and go back to=20

Kisington; and let it not be long ere you return!"  "I am sorry, Your Majes=
ty," said Harold, "but it is=20

too late to take out another book to-day. The rules of the library are very=
 strict."  "Now, did any one=20

ever hear anything so absurd as this!" thundered the Red King, stamping lik=
e a bad-tempered=20

child. "What is a mere library, forsooth, to have rules which I may not bre=
ak?"  "You have rules for=20

your army, do you not?" suggested Harold.  "I should say, verily!" growled =
Red Rex; "strict, stern=20

rules."  "Well, a library is an army of books," answered Harold; "a peacefu=
l army intended to help=20

people and to make them happy; not to kill them. Our noble Librarian, who i=
s general of a mighty=20

army of books, must have rules as stern and strict to keep his army useful =
and efficient. If Your=20

Majesty desires the rest of the tale you must wait until to-morrow."  "I wi=
ll destroy the whole town=20

first!" roared the angry King.  "Then you will never learn the end of the t=
ale," retorted Harold.  It=20

looked as if Harold were in great danger, in spite of the flag of truce. Re=
d Rex stormed and ranted,=20

and his soldiers stood ready with their weapons to do whatever he should bi=
d them. But after a=20

while the warrior's wrath somewhat calmed itself, and shortly he began to c=
huckle noisily.  "True!"=20

he said. "If I destroy the library I shall not know the end of that tale. T=
hat would be a calamity!=20

Well, it is now too late to resume the siege to-day. I may as well continue=
 the truce until to-morrow.=20

But see that you return early in the morning, with the rest of the tale."  =
Once more Harold shook=20

his head. "I must go to Church to-morrow morning," he replied. "It is Sunda=
y, you know. Surely,=20

you do not fight on Sundays, Your Majesty?"  The Red King looked at him sid=
eways. "I had=20

forgotten Sunday," he said. "I have mislaid my calendar. Now, you remind me=
,--no, I suppose not.=20

No, I do not fight on Sundays."  "I thought not!" said Harold, relieved. "I=
t would not be quite=20

knightly, would it? I will return to-morrow afternoon, as soon as I have ha=
d my dinner; and then we=20

will go on with the story of the Dragon of Hushby. Good day, Your Majesty!"=
  "Good day!" growled=20

Red Rex, watching him march away between the files of soldiers. "Youngster!=
" he called after the=20

boy, "be sure you bring back the right volume."  Harold waved his hand in a=
ssent.  Now, when=20

Harold told the Librarian and the other Leading Citizens what he had done, =
they were greatly=20

pleased; for they saw that their city was safe for at least eighteen hours,=
 while their mounted=20

messenger went speeding to  "Don't you worry about that fish. I'll fix him.=
" So saying, Father Bear=20

took a stout cord from his pocket. One end he passed through the fish's mou=
th--the other he tied=20

around a young tree. Then he threw the fish back into the river to keep it =
fresh until it was time to=20

go home.  Being a bright, sunny day, Bobby and his father soon were dry. Bo=
bby rolled in the long=20

grass, then sat on a stump in the sun. Father Bear who laughed at cold and =
heat, and trouble, and=20

danger, simply shrugged his shoulders and lit his pipe. Then he went on fis=
hing.  Many more fish=20

were caught before the sun going down warned them it was time to go home. T=
hey rolled up their=20

lines, threw the poles in the river, then tossed the worms after them and s=
tarted back through the=20

thick woods to their cave.  Father Bear had a big string of fish. Bobby pro=
udly carried the one=20

which had pulled him into the water. It was so heavy it made a load in itse=
lf. He wanted his mother=20

to see him with his first fish--and a monster at that.     THE FIGHT WITH T=
HE WOLVES   Perhaps=20

it was the smell of the fish. Maybe it was because of the noise that Bobby =
and his father made,=20

singing and whistling as they walked along. Whatever the cause, five gray w=
olves, gaunt and lean,=20

met them at the turn of a road.  "Ho! ho! Here's supper for us. And we won'=
t have to work to get it,"=20



cried the biggest wolf, in a loud, gruff voice.  "Fine, fresh fish," said t=
he next largest wolf. "And all=20

ready for us to take."  "Well, we surely are lucky," the third wolf cried. =
"I'll make short work of my=20

portion."  "Let us see, let us see. Five gray wolves, to two bears. This wi=
ll be an easy job for us."=20

So spoke wolf number four.  "I'm so hungry, oh, so hungry. When are we goin=
g to start eating the=20

fish?" wailed the smallest wolf of the lot.  All the time the wolves were t=
alking they were slinking=20

around Father Bear and Bobby.  Now they rushed forward, thinking it would b=
e very easy to=20

overcome the bears and take the fish for themselves. But they reckoned wron=
g. They didn't know=20

that Father Bear had won many prizes as the greatest fighting bear for mile=
s around.  Why, he=20

even had been known to conquer a lion--so strong were his great arms and le=
gs, and so powerful=20

his jaws. So, when four gray wolves rushed at him at once he was ready for =
them. Wolf number=20

one went down with a blow which killed him at once. The next two were cruel=
ly wounded by Father=20

Bear's powerful claws. And the fourth, seeing how badly the rest were getti=
ng on, ran away, as=20

fast as he could.  What about little Bobby Bear all this time? Remember, he=
 had a fish to guard,=20

and this fish was almost as big as himself. The fifth wolf had attacked Bob=
by, who never had seen=20

such awful white teeth and angry eyes.  He hardly=20


_
excited they could not sleep that night. Harold's mother was as proud as a =
peacock when he told=20

the story to her; though it was with some dread that she looked forward to =
his return on the=20

morrow into the camp of the fierce besieger. But Harold said:--  "I shall b=
e quite safe, Mother.=20

Never fear! Red Rex is too much interested in my story to hurt me. When he =
forgets war he is a=20

and that was that this boy-wolf would never get the fish from him. What, th=
e fish he had caught=20

himself? The idea.  So he quickly struck with all his might at the wolf, gr=
abbing him as he=20

stumbled. Then the wolf found out how strong Bobby was.  "Please, Mr. Bear,=
 let me go, and I'll=20

never again try to harm you," he called out.  "Will you run right away and =
never come near me=20

again?"=20


_
man. He is almost pleasant, Mother!"  "What a stupid King he must be to cho=
ose war for his=20

pleasure!" said the mother. "But suppose he cannot wait for to-morrow after=
noon? Suppose he=20

should decide to take the city and win the library for himself, so that he =
can read all the books at=20

his leisure. What then?  "Mother," said Harold, "I believe Red Rex has no j=
oy in reading for=20

himself; no more than you have,--though he may panted, for he was using all=
 his strength.  "Yes,=20

yes, anything, only let me go," said the little wolf.  With this Bobby let =
go. The wolf fell to the=20

ground--he was so tired. He lay there a few moments, then with much gruntin=
g got on his feet and=20

ran off.  For some time Father Bear had been watching his boy. Very proud i=
ndeed was he of what=20

was going on.  Now that all danger was past he rushed over and embraced Bob=
by. "My=20
