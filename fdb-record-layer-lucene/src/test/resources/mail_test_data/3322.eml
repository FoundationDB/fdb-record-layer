Belle, languidly sinking into an easy wicker chair. "You know too much."  "Thank you. I believe this 

was my treat, so now we're even. But I meant all I know about Camp Surprise."  "First, how did it 

get its name?" asked Bess.  "Because of the surprising things that happen there."  "Happen--

happen?" queried Belle. "Do you mean they still happen?"  "Well, so mother said," observed Cora. 

"Bur-r-r!" shivered Bess, with a hasty glance over her shoulder. "I'm not so sure I want to go 

there."  They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with your copy of this eBook,

things that have happened are that things in the bungalow seem to be upset and misplaced 

without reason."  "Upset? Misplaced?" murmured Belle.  "Without reason?" added her sister.  "Oh! 

perhaps I am making a mountain out of a molehill," confessed Cora. "This is how the matter 

stands. Up in the mountains are a number of camps, cottages, bungalows--what you like--which 

belong to a development company. The bungalows and camps are rented, furnished, to whoever 

wants them. Camp Surprise, where we shall have a good-sized bungalow to live in, is one of the 

best of these resorts. It is this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive a refund of
