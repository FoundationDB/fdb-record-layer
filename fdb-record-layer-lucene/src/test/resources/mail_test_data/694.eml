Chaldaean _Kabalah_ it is sexless. In the Jewish, Shekinah is female,      =
 and the early Christians=20

and Gnostics regarded the Holy Ghost as a       female potency. In the _Boo=
k of Numbers_=20

"Shekina" is made to drop       the final "h" that makes it a feminine name=
. Narayana, the Mover on=20

the Waters, is also sexless; but it is our firm belief that Shekinah       =
and Daiviprakriti, the "Light of=20

the Logos," are one and the same       thing philosophically.    348 The El=
ohim create the Adam of=20

dust, and in him Jehovah-Binah       separates himself into Eve, after whic=
h the male portion of=20

God       becomes the Serpent, tempts himself in Eve, then creates himself =
in       her as Cain,=20

passes into Seth, and scatters from Enoch, the Son of       Man, or Humanit=
y, as Jodheva.    349=20

_The Source of Measures_, p. 8.    350 This identifies Sephira, the third p=
otency, with Jehovah the=20

Lord,       who says to Moses out of the burning bush: "(Here) I am." (_Exo=
dus_,       iii, 4.) At this=20

time the "Lord" had not yet become Jehovah. It was       not the one Male G=
od who spoke, but the=20

Elohim manifested, or the       Sephiroth in their manifested collectivity =
of seven, contained in=20

the triple Sephira.    351 The Brahmans were wise in their generation when =
they gradually, for=20

no other reason than this, abandoned Brahma, and paid less attention       =
to him individually than=20

to any other deity. As an abstract       synthesis they worshipped him coll=
ectively and in every God,=20

each of       which represents him. As Brahma, the male, he is far lower th=
an       Shiva, the=20

Lingam, who personates universal generation, or Vishnu,       the preserver=
--both Shiva and=20

Vishnu being the regenerators of life       after destruction. The Christia=
ns might do worse than=20

follow their       example, and worship God in Spirit, and not in the male =
Creator.    352 A plural=20

word, signifying a collective host generically; literally,       the  King,=
 judges, spectators, all turned=20

their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated. Mordaunt did th=
e same and=20

recognized the gentleman, around whom the three other Frenchmen were standi=
ng, pale and=20

menacing. His eyes glittered with delight. He had discovered those to whose=
 death he had=20

devoted his life. A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his =
musketeers, and pointing=20

to the bench where his enemies were: "Fire on that bench!" he cried.  But w=
ith the rapidity of=20

thought D'Artagnan seized Athos by the waist, and followed by Porthos with =
Aramis, leaped down=20

from the benches, rushed into the passages, and flying down the staircase w=
ere lost in the crowd=20

without, while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spect=
ators, whose piteous=20

cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed.  Char=
les also had=20

recognized the four Frenchmen. He put one hand on his heart to still its be=
ating and the other over=20

his eyes, that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends.  M=
ordaunt, pale and trembling=20

with anger, rushed from the hall sword in hand, followed by six pikemen, pu=
shing, inquiring and=20

panting in the crowd; and then, having found nothing, returned.  The tumult=
 was indescribable.=20

More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard. The =
judges were looking=20

for a new outbreak from the benches. The spectators saw the muskets leveled=
 at them, and=20

divided between fear and curiosity, remained noisy and excited.  Quiet was =
at length restored.=20

"What have you to say in your defense?" asked Bradshaw of the king.  Then r=
ising, with his head=20

still covered, in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner, Charles began=
.  "Before questioning=20

353 The writer possesses only a few extracts, some dozen pages in all,     =

but that _spirituality_ can never be discovered, far less       proved, unl=
ess we turn to the Aryan=20

Scriptures and Symbology. For       the Jews it was lost, save for the Sadd=
ucees, from the day that=20

the       "chosen people" reached the Promised Land, the national Karma    =
   preventing Moses=20

from reaching it.    355 _Op. cit._, pp. 317-319.    356 _The Book of God_,=

359 The author says that Parker's _quadrature_ is "that identical       mea=
sure which was used=20

anciently as the perfect measure, by the       Egyptians, in the constructi=
on of the Great Pyramid,=20

which was built       to _monument it and its uses_," and that "from it the=
 _sacred cubit-       value=20

was derived_, which was the cubit-value used in the       construction of t=
he Temple of Solomon,=20

the Ark of Noah, and the Ark       of the Covenant" (p. 22). This is a gran=
d discovery, no doubt, but=20

it only shows that the Jews profited well by their captivity in       Egypt=
, and that Moses was a great=20

Initiate.    360 See _Theosophist_, November, 1879, art. "Hindu Music," p. =
47.    361 The Sanskrit=20

letters are far more numerous than the poor twenty-two       letters of the=
 Hebrew alphabet. They=20

are all musical, and they are       read--or rather chanted--according to a=
 system given in very old=20

Tantrika works, and are called Devanagari, the speech, or language,       o=
f the Gods. And since=20

each letter answers to a numeral, the       Sanskrit affords a far larger s=
cope for expression, and it=20

must       necessarily be far more perfect than the Hebrew, which followed =
the       same system=20

but could apply it only in a very limited way. If either       of these two=
 languages, were taught to=20

humanity by the Gods, surely       it would more likely be the Sanskrit, th=
e perfect form of the most=20

perfect language on earth, than the Hebrew, the roughest and the       poor=
est. For once anyone=20

believes in a language of divine origin, he       can hardly believe at the=
 same time that Angels or=20

Gods or any       divine Messengers have had to develop it from a rough mon=
osyllabic       form=20

into a perfect one, as we see in terrestrial linguistic       evolution.   =
 362 In the first chapter of=20

_Genesis_ the word "God" represents the       Elohim--Gods in the plural, n=
ot one God. This is a=20

cunning and       dishonest translation. For the whole _Kabalah_ explains s=
ufficiently       that the=20

Alhim (Elohim) are seven; each creates one of the seven       things enumer=
ated in the first=20

chapter, and these answer       allegorically to the seven creations. To ma=
ke this clear, count the=20

verses in which it is said "And God saw that it was good," and you       wi=
ll find that this is said=20

seven times--in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21,       25, and 31. And though the =
compilers cunningly=20

represent the       creation of man as occurring on the sixth day, yet, hav=
ing made man       "male=20

and female in the image of God," the Seven Elohim repeat the       sacramen=
tal sentence, "It was=20

good," for the seventh time, thus       making of man the seventh creation,=
 and showing the origin=20

of this       bit of cosmogony to be in the Hindu creations. The Elohim are=
, of       course, the seven=20

Egyptian Khnumu, the "assistant-architects"; the       seven Amshaspends of=
 the Zoroastrians; the=20

Seven Spirits subordinate       to Ildabaoth of the Nazareans; the seven Pr=
ajapati of the Hindus,=20

Wilson's Trans., i, 101. The period of these       Kumaras is Pre-Adamic, _=
i.e._, before the=20

separation of sexes, and       before humanity had received the creative, o=
r sacred, fire of=20

Prometheus.    375 The Secret Doctrine says that this was the second creati=
on, not the       first,=20

and that it took place during the Third Race, when men       separated, _i.=
e._, began to be born as=20

distinct men and women. See       Vol. ii. of this work, Stanzas and Commen=
taries.    376 This is a=20

Gnostic sects as one with Jehovah. See       _Isis Unveiled_, vol. ii. p. 1=

Jetzirah_ now known is but a portion of the original one       incorporated=
 in the Chaldaean _Book=20

of Numbers_. The fragment now in       possession of the Western Kabalists =
is one greatly=20

tampered with by       the Rabbis of the Middle Ages, as its masoretic poin=
ts show. The=20

"Masorah" scheme is a modern blind, dating after our era and       perfecte=
d in Tiberias. (See _Isis=20

Unveiled_, vol. ii, pp. 430-431.)    382 In the oldest symbolism--that used=
 in the Egyptian=20

hieroglyphics--when       the bull's head only is found it means the Deity,=
 the Perfect       Circle,=20

with the procreative power latent in it. When the whole bull       is repre=
sented, a solar God, a=20

_personal_ deity is meant, for it is       then the symbol of the acting ge=
nerative power.    383 It=20

took three Root-Races to degrade the symbol of the One Abstract       Unity=
 manifested in Nature=20

as a Ray emanating from infinity (the       Circle) into a phallic symbol o=
f generation, as it was even=20

in the       _Kabalah_. This degradation began with the Fourth Race, and ha=
d its       _raison=20

d'etre_, in Polytheism, as the latter was invented to screen       the One =
Universal Deity from=20

profanation. The Christians may plead       ignorance of its meaning as an =
excuse for its=20

acceptance. But why       sing never-ceasing talent of your government. But=
 because you have=20

paid the price of a slave, do you imagine that I have ceased to be your kin=
g? No. To answer you=20

would be to forget it. I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me=
 of your right to question=20

me. To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges, and I only ackn=
owledge you as=20

my executioners." And in the middle of a deathlike silence, Charles, calm, =
lofty, and with his head=20

still covered, sat down again in his arm-chair.  "Why are not my Frenchmen =
here?" he murmured=20

proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a m=
oment; "they would=20

have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive, and of=
 their tears when dead."=20

"Well," said the president, seeing that Charles was determined to remain si=
lent, "so be it. We will=20

judge you in spite of your silence. You are accused of treason, of abuse of=
 power, and murder.=20

The evidence will support it. Go, and another sitting will accomplish what =
you have postponed in=20

this."  Charles rose and turned toward Parry, whom he saw pale and with his=
 temples dewed with=20

moisture.  "Well, my dear Parry," said he, "what is the matter, and what ca=
n affect you in this=20

manner?"  "Oh, my king," said Parry, with tears in his eyes and in a tone o=
f supplication, "do not=20

look to the left as we leave the hall."  "And why, Parry?"  "Do not look, I=
 implore you, my king."=20

"But what is the matter? Speak," said Charles, attempting to look across th=
e hedge of guards=20

which surrounded him.  "It is--but you will not look, will you?--it is beca=
use they have had the axe,=20



with which criminals are executed, brought and placed there on the table. T=
he sight is hideous."=20

"Fools," said Charles, "do they take me for a coward, like themselves? You =
have done well to warn=20

me. Thank you, Parry."  When the moment arrived the king followed his guard=
s out of the hall. As=20

he passed the table on which the axe was laid, he stopped, and turning with=
 a smile, said:  "Ah!=20

the axe, an ingenious device, and well worthy of those who know not what a =
gentleman is; you=20

frighten me not, executioner's axe," added he, touching it with the cane wh=
ich he held in his hand,=20

"and I strike you now, waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return =
the blow."  And shrugging=20

his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on. When he reached the do=
or a stream of=20

people, who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house a=
nd to make amends=20

had collected to see him come out, stood on each side, as he passed, many a=
mong them glaring=20

on him with threatening looks.  "How many people," thought he, "and not one=
 true friend."  And as=20

he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind, a voice bes=
ide him said:=20

"Respect to fallen majesty."  The king turned quickly around, with tears in=
 his eyes and heart. It=20

was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive be=
fore him without=20

rendering him this final homage. But the next moment the unfortunate man wa=
s nearly killed with=20

heavy blows of sword-hilts, and among those who set upon him the king recog=
nized Captain=20

Groslow.  "Alas!" said Charles, "that is a severe chastisement for a very t=
rifling fault."  He=20

continued his walk, but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces, when a furiou=
s fellow, leaning=20

between two soldiers, spat in the king's face, as once an infamous and accu=
rsed Jew spit in the=20

face of Jesus of Nazareth. Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose =
together. The crowd=20

opened and closed again, undulating like a stormy sea, and the king imagine=
d that he saw shining=20

in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Athos.  Charles wiped h=
is face and said with a=20

sad smile: "Poor wretch, for half a crown he would do as much to his own fa=
ther."  The king was=20

not mistaken. Athos and his friends, again mingling with the throng, were t=
aking a last look at the=20

martyr king.  When the soldier saluted Charles, Athos's heart bounded for j=
oy; and that=20

unfortunate, on coming to himself, found ten guineas that the French gentle=
man had slipped into=20

his pocket. But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive =
monarch Athos grasped=20

his dagger. But D'Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried, "W=
ait!"  Athos stopped.=20

D'Artagnan, leaning on Athos, made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep nea=
r them and then=20

placed himself behind the man with the bare arms, who was still laughing at=
 his own vile=20

pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others.  The man to=
ok his way toward the=20

city. The four friends followed him. The man, who had the appearance of bei=
ng a butcher,=20

descended a little steep and isolated street, looking on to the river, with=
 two of his friends. Arrived=20

at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed, t=
urned around, and=20

looking insolently at the Frenchmen, passed some jests from one to another.=
  "I don't know=20

English, Athos," said D'Artagnan; "but you know it and will interpret for m=
e."  Then quickening their=20

steps they passed the three men, but turned back immediately, and D'Artagna=
n walked straight up=20

to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger, sa=
id to Athos:  "Say this to=20

him in English: 'You are a coward. You have insulted a defenseless man. You=
 have befouled the=20

face of your king. You must die.'"  Athos, pale as a ghost, repeated these =
words to the man, who,=20

seeing the bodeful preparations that were making, put himself in an attitud=
e of defense. Aramis, at=20

this movement, drew his sword.  "No," cried D'Artagnan, "no steel. Steel is=
 for gentlemen."  And=20



seizing the butcher by the throat:  "Porthos," said he, "kill this fellow f=
or me with a single blow."=20

Porthos raised his terrible fist, which whistled through the air like a sli=
ng, and the portentous mass=20

fell with a smothered crash on the insulter's skull and crushed it. The man=
 fell like an ox beneath=20

the poleaxe. His companions, horror-struck, could neither move nor cry out.=
  "Tell them this,=20

Athos," resumed D'Artagnan; "thus shall all die who forget that a captive m=
an is sacred and that a=20

captive king doubly represents the Lord."  Athos repeated D'Artagnan's word=
s.  The fellows looked=20

at the body of their companion, swimming in blood, and then recovering voic=
e and legs together,=20

ran screaming off.  "Justice is done," said Porthos, wiping his forehead.  =
"And now," said=20

D'Artagnan to Athos, "entertain no further doubts about me; I undertake all=
 that concerns the king."=20

of rest.       The progenitors of mankind solved the greatest problems of t=
he       Universe with their=20

seven Rays or Rishis.    385 _Genesis_ begins with the _third_ stage of "cr=
eation," skipping the=20

preliminary two.    386 The three _root_-principles are, exoterically: Man,=
 Soul, and Spirit=20

(meaning by "man" the intelligent personality), and esoterically:       Lif=
e, Soul, and Spirit; the four=20

vehicles are Body, Astral double,       Animal (or human) Soul, and Divine =
Soul (Sthula-Sharira,=20

Linga-       Sharira, Kama-rupa, and Buddhi, the vehicle of Atma or Spirit)=
. Or,       to make it still=20

clearer: (1) the _Seventh_ Principle has for its       vehicle the Sixth (B=
uddhi); (2) the vehicle of=20

Manas is Kama-rupa;       (3) that of Jiva or Prana (life) is the Linga-Sha=
rira (the "double"       of=20

man; the Linga-Sharira proper can never leave the body till       death; th=
at which appears is an=20

astral body, reflecting the physical       body and serving as a vehicle fo=
r the human soul, or=20

intelligence);       and (4) the Body, the physical vehicle of all the abov=
e       collectively. The=20

Occultist recognizes the same order as existing       for the cosmical tota=
lity, the _psycho_-

cosmical Universe.    387 St. Denys, the Areopagite, the supposed contempor=
ary of St. Paul,=20

his co-disciple, and first Bishop of St. Denis, near Paris, teaches       t=
hat the bulk of the "work of=20

creation" was performed by the       "_Seven_ Spirits of the Presence"--God=
's _co-operators_,=20

owing to a       participation of the divinity in them. (_Hierarch._, p. 19=
6.) And       Saint Augustine=20

also thinks that "things were rather created in the       angelic minds tha=
n in Nature, that is to say,=20

that the angels       perceived and knew them (all things) in Such is the a=
trocious logic of=20

revolutions.  Although our friends were expecting that condemnation, it fil=
led them with grief.=20

D'Artagnan, whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical=
 emergencies, swore=20

again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the denouement of =
the bloody tragedy.=20

But by what means? As yet he could form no definite plan; all must depend o=
n circumstances.=20

Meanwhile, it was necessary at all hazards, in order to gain time, to put s=
ome obstacle in the way=20

of the execution on the following day--the day appointed by the judges. The=
 only way of doing that=20

was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner. The headsman out =
of the way, the=20

sentence could not be executed. True, they could send for the headsman of t=
he nearest town, but=20

at least a day would be gained, and a day might be sufficient for the rescu=
e. D'Artagnan took upon=20

himself that more than difficult task.  Another thing, not less essential, =
was to warn Charles Stuart=20

of the attempt to be made, so that he might assist his rescuers as much as =
possible, or at least do=20

nothing to thwart their efforts. Aramis assumed that perilous charge. Charl=
es Stuart had asked that=20

Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit him. Mordaunt had called on the bi=
shop that very evening=20

to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cr=
omwell's permission.=20



Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop, through fear or by persuasion,=
 consent that he=20

should enter in the bishop's place, and clad in his sacerdotal robes, the p=
rison at Whitehall.=20

Finally, Athos undertook to provide, in any event, the means of leaving Eng=
land--in case either of=20

failure or of success.  The night having come they made an appointment to m=
eet at eleven o'clock=20

at the hotel, and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission.  The p=
alace of Whitehall was=20

guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell=
, who came and went=20

or sent his generals or his agents continually. Alone in his usual room, li=
ghted by two candles, the=20

condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness, just as =
at the last hour one=20

sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore.  Parry had not =
quitted his master, and=20

since his condemnation had not ceased to weep. Charles, leaning on a table,=
 was gazing at a=20

medallion of his wife and daughter; he was waiting first for Juxon, then fo=
r martyrdom.  At times he=20

thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a dist=
ance of a hundred=20

leagues fabulous and unreal, like the forms that appear in dreams. In fact,=
 he sometimes asked=20

himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream, or at least the d=
elirium of a fever. He=20

rose and took a few=20


_
could spring forth into actual existence." (_Vid. De Genesis ad       Litte=
ram_ p. II.) (Summarized=20

from De Mirville, Vol. II., pp.       337-338.) Thus the early Christian Fa=
thers, even a non-initiate like=20

St. Augustine, ascribed the creation of the visible world to Angels,       =
or Secondary Powers, while=20

St. Denys not only specifies these as the       "_Seven_ Spirits of the Pre=
sence," but shows them=20

owing their power       to the informing divine energy--Fohat in the Secret=
 Doctrine. But the=20

egotistical darkness which caused the Western races to cling so       despe=
rately to the _Geo_-

centric System, made them also neglect and       despise all those fragment=
s of the true Religion=20

which would have       deprived them and the little globe they took for the=
 centre of the=20

Universe of the signal honour of having been expressly "created" by       t=
he One, Secondless,=20

Infinite God!    388 De Mirville, ii. 295.    389 To the Occultist and Chel=
a the difference made=20

between _Energy_ and       Emanation need not be explained. The Sanskrit wo=
rd "Sakti" is=20

untranslatable. It may be Energy, but it is one that proceeds       through=
 itself, not being due to the=20

active or conscious will of the       one that produces it. The "First-Born=
," or Logos, is not an=20

Emanation, but an Energy inherent in and co-eternal torpor and went as far =
as the window; he saw=20

glittering below him the muskets of the guards. He was thereupon constraine=
d to admit that he=20

was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real.  Charles returned in s=
ilence to his chair,=20

rested his elbow on the table, bowed his head upon his hand and reflected. =
 "Alas!" he said to=20

himself, "if I only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church, =
whose soul has sounded all=20

the mysteries of life, all the littlenesses of greatness, perhaps his utter=
ance would overawe the=20

voice that wails within my soul. But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind, =
whose career and fortune I=20

have ruined by my misfortune. He will speak to me of God and death, as he h=
as spoken to many=20

another dying man, not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an =
usurper, his children to=20

the cold contempt of public charity."  And he raised the medallion to his l=
ips.  It was a dull, foggy=20

night. A neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour. The flickering li=
ght of the two candles=20

showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room. These were the ancestors o=
f Charles, standing=20

back dimly in their tarnished frames.  An awful sadness enveloped the heart=
 of Charles. He buried=20

his brow in his hands and thought of the world, so beautiful when one is ab=
out to leave it; of the=20

caresses of children, so pleasing and so=20

the word for the=20

Kether, Chokmah, and=20

Binah. As for these three, it       explains the difference by calling them=
 "immanations," something=20

inherent to and coeval with the subject postulated, or in other       words=

Kosmos-Builders of other=20

nations, that can alone explain the imperfection of the Universe.       Thi=

arguments of the Secret Science in       favour of the existence and activi=
ty of these "Powers." And=20
