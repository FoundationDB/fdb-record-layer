Anno Domini millessimo quingentessimo trigessimo septimo. Quarto nonas Junii Pontificatus 

nostri, Anno tertio.                               THE BULLSublimis Deus                                  Translation 

Paul III Pope   To all faithful Christians to whom this writing may come, health in Christ our Lord 

and the apostolic benediction.  The sublime God so loved the human race that He created man in 

such wise that he might participate, not only in the good that other creatures enjoy, but endowed 

him with capacity to attain to the inaccessible and invisible Supreme Good and behold it face to 

face; and since man, according to the testimony of the sacred scriptures, has been created to 

enjoy eternal life and happiness, which none may obtain save through faith in our Lord Jesus 

Christ, it is necessary that he should possess the nature and faculties enabling him to receive that 

faith; and that whoever is thus endowed should be capable of receiving that same faith.  Nor is it 

credible that any one should possess so little understanding as to desire the faith and yet be 

destitute of the most necessary faculty to enable him to receive it.  Hence Christ, who is the Truth 

itself, that has never failed and can never fail, said to the preachers of the faith whom He chose for 

that office "Go ye and teach all nations."  He said all, without exception, for all are capable of 

receiving the doctrines of the faith.  The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in 

order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before 

heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he 

inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of 

the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated 

as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the catholic 

faith.  We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our 

might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside, into the fold committed to our charge, 

consider, however, that the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of 

understanding the catholic faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to 

receive it.  Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, we define and declare by these our 

letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any 

ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, 

notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said Indians and all 

other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their 

liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; 

and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of 

their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null 

and of no effect.  By virtue of our apostolic authority We define and declare by these present 

letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any 

ecclesiastical dignitary, which shall thus command the same obedience as the originals, that the 

said Indians and other peoples should be converted to the faith of Jesus Christ by preaching the 

word of God and by the example of good and holy living.  Given in Rome in the year of our Lord 

1537. The fourth of June and of our Pontificate, the third year.      APPENDIX III. - ROYAL 

ORDINANCES PROVIDING FOR THE DEPARTURE OF LAS CASAS FROM SPAIN AND FOR 

HIS RECEPTION IN THE INDIES(107)   THE PRINCE. Our officials of India House, who reside in 

the city of Seville: Rev. Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the province of Chiapa, 



goes to this city in order to send off forty priests, who are now going to the province of Honduras; 

and also to give orders concerning their departure and other matters which he understands.  I 

therefore wish the said bishop to be given every facility in these matters so that he may be 

enabled to arrange quickly, as is due to one in our service, and I command and order you that in 

the aforesaid, as in all things, you will offer him help, and assist him and the said priests; and in 

thus doing, you will be serving me.  From Valladolid 13th day of the month of February 1544--I, the 

Prince, etc.  THE PRINCE.  Our officials of India House, who reside in the city of Seville; as the 

bulls of the bishop of the province of Chiapa, the Reverend Father Fray Bartholomew de Las 

Casas have arrived and Diego Navarro, who brought them by our orders is entitled by the 

agreement made with him to be paid for the cost and the delivery of the said bulls, amounting, 

according to the declaration of Pedro de Tapia and of Diego de Gaona, apostolic notaries, and of 

certain money changers in Rome, to eighty-eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-five 

maravedis, and since this has to be deducted from the five hundred thousand maravedis, which 

the said bishop receives from us in New Spain, I order that out of whatever maravedis are in your 

charge, our treasurer shall pay the said Diego Navarro or his authorised representative the said 

eighty-eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis.  You will take care that they are 

collected according to the cedula which I send by him.  Let me know what you do in this matter, 

and do not fail to do so.  Dated in Valladolid, etc.  Archives of the Indies, Council of Guatemala, 

register of property.  Royal commands issued to the authorities, corporations, and private persons 

of the district, years 1529 to 1551. Desk 100, drawer 1st. Packet 1st.  THE PRINCE.  By these 

presents I give permission and faculty to you, Rev. Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect 

of the province of Chiapa to leave our realms, and dominions and go to our Indies, Islands, and 

"Terra Firma" of the ocean sea, accompanied by four black slaves for your personal service and 

establishment, free of all duty, as well from the two ducats for their licences, as from the 

"almoxarifazgo" duties.(108) Whatever sum this amounts to, I exempt you; and we instruct our 

officials in those islands and provinces to which the said slaves are to be sent, to take charge of 

this original document and place it in the chest of the Three Keys, so that the said slaves shall be 

unable to make more than the one voyage for which we give you permission by this licence. 

Dated in the town of Valladolid 13th day of February 1544--I, the Prince, etc.  THE PRINCE. 

Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the province of 

Chiapa I have been informed that the province of Socousco is within the boundaries of your 

diocese.  Knowing this and with the confidence I place in you, my will is to place the said province 

under your charge so that, as prelate you will have the care of the spiritual affairs in it, until, as 

aforesaid, a bishop is provided for it.  I therefore order and entrust you as prelate to take charge of 

the spiritual welfare of the said province until as said, a prelate is provided for it.  Of the tithes of 

the said province you are to take one fourth part, and the other three parts shall be distributed 

among the ecclesiastical ministers who at present serve in that province; and in the repairs and 

decorations of its churches.  The fourth part, of which you have the use, shall be expended in your 

personal visits throughout the said provinces and in performing their pontifical functions until the 

prelate we shall appoint goes to reside in his bishopric.  Dated in Valladolid 13th day of February 

1544--I, the Prince, etc.  THE PRINCE.  Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de Las 

Casas, bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa.  You already know that the 



Emperor King, my sovereign, having seen the necessity of providing and ordering certain things 

tending to the better government of the Indies, the better treatment of its natives, and the better 

administration of justice, and in order to fulfil the duties he owes to the service of God our Lord, 

and in the discharge of his royal conscience has, after much deliberation, ordered certain 

ordinances to be drawn up.  As it afterwards appeared necessary and advantageous to explain 

certain clauses in the said ordinances and to further strengthen others, certain ordinances and 

declarations were made, many of whose articles have been rectified for the benefit, preservation, 

and good treatment of the natives of the said Indies, their lives and properties.  They may all thus 

be well treated as free subjects and vassals of His Majesty (which they are) and instructed in the 

Holy Catholic Faith, as you will see by the copies of the said ordinances and declarations, which I 

order to be sent to you with this letter, signed by Juan de Samano, our secretary.  And whatever I 

have commanded in our ordinances and in our cedulas and provisions, which I now renew, I send 

and order our viceroys, presidents and the auditors of our audiencias and royal chancelleries of 

the said Indies, our governors and our judges that with great zeal and diligence they obey, comply 

with, and have them proclaimed.  They shall rigorously punish all who rebel against these 

ordinances, and many of the said ordinances shall be given to the priests who are in those parts 

that they may be made known to the natives, and procure obedience to them, and report those 

who do not fulfil them, to the said audiencia.  I also think it advisable to mention this to you, feeling 

confident that as you are the pastor and protector of the native Indians in your bishopric, and are 

bound to be more zealous in procuring their better welfare and in preserving their spiritual and 

temporal development, you will, therefore, do this and take greater care to ensure the execution of 

what has been enacted for their benefit.  Thus I charge you and I command you to see that this is 

carried out, and to exercise great vigilance and care to ensure the observance of the said statutes 

and the execution of their provisions.  And should any person or persons violate these orders, you 

will notify the governors and judges in those parts so that they may punish them according to the 

provisions of the statutes.  Should the latter prove remiss, neglectful, or inclined to dissimulate, 

you will report to the President and auditors of Our Audiencia and Royal Chancellery of the 

Confines, indicating those who have offended and in what way, so that they may order the guilty to 

be punished in conformity with the commands we have sent them.  In case the said President and 

auditors fail to correct and punish them, after seeing your statement--a thing we do not believe--

you will notify us of everything in order that we may have them punished as we may think fit.  In 

doing this you will have fulfilled the duties you owe to the service of God, our Lord, and in the 

discharge of your conscience; moreover the Emperor my sovereign will also be served.  Dated in 

Valladolid, 13th day of February 1544.  I the Prince, etc.  DON CARLOS by Divine Grace, August 

Emperor, King of Germany; Dona Juana his mother, and the same Don Carlos by the grace of 

God, Kings of Castile and Leon, etc.  To you, Rev. Father in Christ, Bartholomew de Las Casas, 

bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, health and grace.  You well know 

that on account of the good reports that we had of your character, we presented you to our most 

Holy Father as bishop of the said diocese, and though the bulls have not been despatched, the 

service of God Our Lord, the instruction and conversion of the natives of the said bishopric and the 

good government and advancement of the Church and its divine teachings, require that you go 

with all haste to the said provinces to undertake the said teaching and conversion and the other 



matters with which we have charged you.  Were you to await the arrival of the said bulls, certain 

misfortunes might in the meantime occur there which would displease God our Lord, and not be in 

accordance with our duties to His service in the Indies.  It was therefore agreed that without 

awaiting the said bulls, you should go to the said province, and we approve it.  Therefore we pray 

and command you that as soon as you receive this you will start for the said province of Chiapa, 

without awaiting the said bulls: you will enquire into and find out the state of the spiritual affairs of 

the province and also what churches and monasteries have been built.  What tithes there have 

been and in what way they have been spent and distributed.  If the necessary churches have not 

been built you will see that they are immediately erected in such places as you judge best, placing 

priests to administer the Holy Sacraments and to diligently instruct the natives of those towns in all 

matters relating to our holy Catholic Faith.  In the meantime, we, as patrons of the said churches 

and the others in our Indies, command persons to be named to those benefices who will assume 

charge of them. You will likewise see that the divine services are carried out with the necessary 

reverence, decency, and decorum, and that the natives of the said district are instructed in the 

Holy Catholic faith; you will see that the said priests and others who reside in the said provinces 

live honestly, and that those who are charged with the education of the Indians in the teachings of 

our Holy Catholic Faith fulfil their duties.  We command that the President and the auditors of our 

Audiencia and Royal Chancellery of the Confines, as well as all other judges and subjects of the 

said province of Chiapa, shall give you all the above mentioned, and shall favour and aid you in 

whatever you ask of them or is necessary.  For all of which we name you and give you full power 

by this, our letter with all its incidents, dependencies, annexes, and connexes.  You are notified by 

this letter that you are not authorised to exercise jurisdiction or other functions forbidden to 

bishops-elect before they are confirmed and consecrated.  Dated in the town of Valladolid 13th 

day of February etc.  DON CARLOS, etc.  To you, the Rev. Father in Christ, Bartholomew de Las 

Casas bishop-elect of the province of Chiapa, health and grace.   Be it known to you that we have 

been informed that in your diocese, many Indians have been hunted and driven to the hills and 

mountains by the cruel treatment of Spaniards living there, and of others who have gone there of 

their own free will.  And because we are desirous that the said Indians should be pacified and 

taught our Holy Catholic Faith, and should be brought back to the towns they used to inhabit to 

again live there and be taught the Christian doctrines, we have decided, on account of the great 

confidence we have in you, to beg you to endeavour to bring the said Indians to peaceful terms. 

We therefore charge and command you that upon your arrival there you will endeavour to procure 

peace, and to instruct all the Indians who have been driven out of the said bishopric, in the 

knowledge of the Holy Catholic Faith.  And you will persuade them to return to the towns they 

used to inhabit or to the places indicated by you, which you think more suitable.  And that they 

may come the more willingly, you will promise and assure them in our name that if they come and 

populate the said towns, they shall not be molested either now or at any time during our royal 

reign; neither they, nor their descendants, nor the towns they inhabit.  By these presents we 

promise that should they come to peaceful terms as stated, we will not molest them neither during 

this reign nor at any other time.  We moreover command that for a period of four years they shall 

neither be fined nor taxed by our officials nor by any other persons; and that they may be more 

relieved from work, our will is that they shall be free of all tribute.  You will have special oversight 



of their good treatment and of their instruction and conversion, and you will advise us what number 

of Indians have become peaceful through these means and also what districts they have peopled. 

Dated in the town of Valladolid etc.  THE PRINCE.  Reverend Father in Christ, Francis Marroquin, 

bishop of the province of Guatemala: I am informed by Our Council that you have interfered and 

are interfering in the spiritual affairs pertaining to the Diocese of Chiapa and know its affairs as 

though you were its bishop, being as it is the lawful church and having its chapter, and the see 

being at present vacant.  The Emperor King, my sovereign, has presented to the said bishopric the 

Reverend Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, and we have despatched him thither without waiting 

for his bulls.  You are aware that in a lawfully erected diocese it belongs to the chapter during the 

vacancy of the see, to take cognisance of what happens there.  Therefore I command you that 

from the day that you receive this, you will henceforth, neither know nor try to find out and interfere 

as a bishop in anything pertaining to the said bishopric of Chiapa, and that you will leave the 

chapter of the vacant see to act as is customary during a vacancy.  Dated in Valladolid etc.  THE 

PRINCE.  Don Carlos, by Divine Grace august Emperor, King of Germany; Dona Juana, his 

mother and the same Don Carlos, by the grace of God, Kings of Castile and Leon etc.  To you 

Rev. Father in Christ, Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the 

plains of Chiapa, health and grace be with you.  You well know how we have sent you, without 

awaiting your bulls, to the said province to undertake the spiritual affairs there and, because our 

wishes are that pending the arrival of the said bulls, you shall be entitled to collect the 

ecclesiastical tithes of that bishopric and to distribute them according to and in the manner 

authorised by the foundation law of the diocese, we command you, pending the arrival of the bulls 

authorising you to take possession of the said bishopric, to collect all the ecclesiastical tithes of 

that bishopric.  By these presents we command all persons who should pay them, to bring them to 

you or to whomever you authorise to receive them, just as though you had already taken 

possession of the diocese by virtue of the said bulls. The tithes thus collected you shall spend and 

distribute each year on the things and in such wise as the foundation charter provided, and for 

their collection we give you full power, with its incidents, dependencies, annexes, and connexes. 

We likewise order that our judges and the inhabitants of the said province shall not place nor allow 

to be placed any impediment whatsoever in your way and shall leave you free to collect the said 

tithes; and should necessity arise, they shall help and assist you, and shall compel the tithe-payers 

to pay you the tithes as beforesaid--Dated in the town of Valladolid 13th of February 1544--I the 

Prince--by command of His Highness, Juan de Samano; signed by the Bishop of Cuenca and the 

licentiates Gutierrez Velasquez; Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron. THE PRINCE.  Venerable and 

devout Father, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect confirmed to the province of Chiapa; 

I saw your letter of the 21st ult. and the one you wrote to Juan de Samano, his Majesty's 

secretary, and the cedula you ask for, authorizing the expenses of the forty friars who are going to 

Honduras, goes with this.  About the two hundred and fifty ducats which I ordered to be given you 

by the officials of this chamber, seeing that there is no money wherewith to pay them, I have 

ordered them to be paid on account, and that they should pay them to you, as you will have 

understood when you receive this, and thus they will settle with you in full.  I have written to the 

Franciscan Provincial of the Province of Castile, that ten priests are going to the Indies instead of 

the twelve that I asked for, as you told me that two of them are already in that city, of which I am 



glad.  The others who come will be provided with their passage and stores according to the cedula 

you possess.  Pertaining to your consecration, in another document which accompanies this, I am 

sending to give notice of the arrival of your bulls, charging you to arrange at once for your 

consecration.  I therefore beg you to do this and to let me know how it was celebrated.  Valladolid 

1st day of April 1544.  I, the Prince: countersigned by Samano, signed by the bishop of Cuenca, 

Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  DON CARLOS and Dona Juana etc.  To you alcaldes 

and others and to our judges of the provinces of Chiapa, Yucatan, Cozumel and to all Aldermen, 

Judges, lawyers, gentlemen, esquires, officials and to all loyal subjects in every city, town, and 

village which lie within the boundaries assigned by our President and the auditors of our royal 

Council in New Spain to the bishopric of the city of Ciudad Real of this province of Chiapa, and to 

whatsoever other persons may be charged with the administration of the churches in the said 

cities, towns, and villages lying within the said boundaries and to whom this our letter may 

concern, health and grace.  You well know or should know that we have presented to our very 

Holy Father, the Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de las Casas of the Dominican 

Order, for the bishopric of the said city of Ciudad Real in the province of Chiapa, to whom His 

Holiness, in virtue of our presentation, conveyed the said church and bishopric; and he ordered to 

be given and did give his bull for it, presenting it to us and begging us to grant our execution of the 

letter so that, in conformity with the said bulls, he would be given possession of the said bishopric 

and might receive its rents and income, to enable him to appoint his vicars and other officials of 

the said bishopric and that we might dispose as we saw fit.  He sent the said bulls to be shown to 

our Council of the Indies and after they had seen them, we agreed that in the meantime or until we 

or our sovereign successors enlarge or diminish the boundaries of the said bishopric, the said 

Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas should preserve the boundaries assigned by the said President 

and auditors to the said bishopric of Chiapa; and that the tithes and other things which belong to 

him as bishop should be paid him; and that we should send this, our letter to you; and we 

approved.  For that reason we order all and each one of you, who see the said bulls, which will be 

presented by the said Reverend Fray Bartolomew de Las Casas, conformably with their tenor and 

form to give or have given to him, or to whomever he authorises, the possession of the church and 

bishopric of the said city of Ciudad Real of the province of Chiapa, that he may hold it within the 

boundaries the said President and auditors have marked out.  Meanwhile, and until we or the 

kings our successors enlarge or diminish the said boundaries as before stated, you shall hold him 

as your bishop and prelate, giving him the proceeds and incomes, tithes and revenues, and all 

things pertaining to him as bishop of that diocese.  And you shall allow him to perform his pastoral 

duties and exercise his episcopal jurisdiction in person or through his officials or vicars, in 

whatever manner and in whatever form may be rightfully used according to the said bulls, and as 

the laws of our kingdom sanction; and in all things and cases belonging to ecclesiastical 

jurisdiction, you shall give him all help and assistance.  And should he ask the aid of the secular 

arm, you will grant it in conformity with the law, and each one and all shall not fail him in any way, 

under penalty of our displeasure and of five hundred thousand maravedis, forfeit to our exchequer. 

Dated in the town of Valladolid 7th of March 1544--I, the Prince; legalised by Samano, signed by 

the Bishop of Cuenca, Gutierrez Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  THE PRINCE.  Our 

officials in the province of Higueras and Cape of Honduras: know ye that on account of the good 



reports and information of the character and life of Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas of the 

Dominican Order, the Emperor King, my sovereign, has presented him to His Holiness as bishop 

of the province of Chiapa in place of Fray Juan de Arteaga, deceased, former bishop of the said 

diocese.  As the said bishop has explained to me that in order to go to reside in the said diocese, 

he will be obliged to provide himself in the said province with a few things for his voyage, he has 

begged me to order you to lend him from your funds the sum of two hundred ducats, or what I am 

pleased to give; and I approve. I have therefore ordered in one of my documents, that five hundred 

thousand maravedis in excess of the fourth part of the tithes of the said bishopric, are to be yearly 

given from our purse.  That he may have sufficient to maintain himself better, I command that out 

of whatever maravedis are in your care, our treasurer shall give and pay to the said Fray 

Bartholomew de Las Casas, or to his authorised representative, the said two hundred ducats, 

amounting to seventy-five thousand maravedis, and shall note it on the back of the said document 

above mentioned; as you pay it on account and in part payment of the said five hundred thousand 

maravedis that we give him in this way each year, we have ordered that these and other 

maravedis, which in these countries are to be given him, shall be deducted from the five hundred 

thousand maravedis.  You will take his receipt or that of his authorised representative to show that 

the said two hundred "ducats" have been received on account.  Dated in Valladolid, thirteenth day 

of February 1544,--I, the Prince, countersigned by Samano--signed by the bishop of Cuenca, and 

Gre. Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  THE PRINCE.  Our officials in the province of 

Guatemala, or any other persons who may have been appointed to collect the tithes of the Bishop 

of Chiapa, during the vacant bishopric.  Know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, because of 

the good reports he had of the character and merits of the Rev. Father in Christ, Fray 

Bartholomew de Las Casas of the Dominican Order, presented him to the Holy Father as bishop 

of the said diocese of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, in place of the licentiate Rev. 

Juan de Arteaga, former bishop, deceased.  The said bishop has begged me, in order to assist 

him in his many expenses until he starts to the said bishopric and to pay the expenses of his bulls, 

to graciously give him the tithes belonging to the church, that have accumulated since the decease 

of the said Rev. Juan de Arteaga, should I so wish, and I, agreeing to the above and to help him, 

do approve.  I therefore command you to help and assist the said bishop or his authorised 

representatives with any tithes you may have collected or that remain in the said bishopric of 

Chiapa belonging to the church, from the day the said predecessor died until the day when he will 

enter and enjoy the five hundred thousand maravedis which we order to be given him.  Dated in 

Valladolid thirteenth day of February 1544--I the Prince--by command of His Highness, Juan de 

Samano.  THE PRINCE.    Forasmuch as the Reverend Father in Christ, Fray Bartholomew de 

Las Casas, bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa has informed me that it 

may happen that in the Cathedral of your said bishopric, there may not be more than one or two 

incumbents, presented by us and installed by you in the dignities, canonries, and prebends of the 

diocese, and, that not being more numerous, they must divide amongst them all that pertains to 

the capitula mensa and promotes the service of God our Lord and increases the divine cult in the 

said church.  Should this be the case, the persons who were installed and were present should 

take what was required for its establishment, and out of the remainder competent salaries should 

be given to some of the priests who serve in the said church so long as there are no more 



beneficiaries, as we desire that the above mentioned may be corrected.    We order and charge by 

these presents that, when it happens that in the said church there are not at least four incumbents 

in residence, you will appoint up to the said number to fill the vacant places, and priests who lead 

exemplary lives and of the necessary abilities to serve in the said church, as its canons and priests 

should; you will give them a sufficient salary from the funds that belong to the Order of the 

Chapter; first paying those who reside there and are ordained as the foundation statutes provide. 

And what may be left over from this and from the said salaries, which you will order to be paid 

from the said funds, you will order to be divided among all those installed and named by you, 

according to what is due to each.  But should it happen that four incumbents or more than are 

entitled to, reside in the said church, let them have from the funds of the said Order of the Chapter, 

according to the foundation.  And you will endeavour to hold them to this and will report to our 

Council for the Indies by the first ships sailing, all particulars respecting the persons appointed, 

with their salaries as before mentioned, and their capabilities, so that we may judge what will be 

most useful to the service of God our Lord, and to Holy Church.  And take care to enlighten us 

when the funds increase, that we may appoint more persons for the service of the said church. 

And be careful that the salaries you have to fix, do not exceed the usual amount allowed in like 

cases.  Dated in the town of Valladolid, thirteenth day of February 1544. I, the Prince, by 

command of His Highness, Juan de Samano, signed by the Bishop of Cuenca, by the licentiate 

Gre. Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  THE PRINCE.  Our officials in New Spain; you 

already know how, on account of the good reports we have had of the character and merits of the 

Reverend Father, Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, we presented him to the bishopric of the 

province of Chiapa in the place of Don Juan de Arteaga the late bishop; and as his bulls have 

been sent and their delivery cost eighty-eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five maravedis, 

which amount must be paid out of the five hundred thousand maravedis which we ordered in 

another document to be given to him yearly in that country, and because our officials of India 

House, who reside in the city of Seville, have by our order paid eighty-eight thousand nine 

hundred and twenty-five maravedis, I ordered them to send you this my cedula in order that you 

might repay it.  I therefore command you that of the five hundred thousand maravedis which the 

said Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas receives from us in that country, the two first years in

which you will send to the aforesaid officials at Seville, that we may be repaid therefrom.  Dated, in 

Valladolid ist of April 1544, I, the Prince, countersigned by Samano, signed by the bishop of 

Cuenca, Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  THE PRINCE. Counsellors, judges, lawyers, 

gentlemen, esquires, officials, and all royal subjects of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of 

Chiapa; know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, on account of the good reports he had of 

the character, life, and habits of the Reverend Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, has presented 

him to this bishopric.   Because we hope our Lord will be well served by him, we have ordered him 

to start without waiting for his bulls and we have provided him with what we thought necessary.  I 

charge and command you to honour him and treat him justly, and to ask his advice in whatever 

matters may occur and in accordance with the service of God our Lord and the good government 

of this city, for I trust that by his good works and example and the great zeal he shows for the 

service of God and for His Majesty, he will counsel and guide you in whatever may contribute to 



the best results. Valladolid, 23rd of February, etc.  THE PRINCE.  Venerable dean and chapter of 

the Cathedral of the bishopric of Chiapa: know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, because 

of the good report he had of the character, life, and habits of Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, has 

presented him to this bishopric; and because we hope that our Lord will be well served by his 

mission and for the benefit of the Holy Church, we have ordered him to start without waiting for his 

bulls to be granted to him, and we have ordered what provision we thought necessary.  I charge 

and command you to honour him and to treat him with respect and to take his advice in everything 

necessary for the government of the church during the time he is awaiting consecration, because I 

hope that with his wise teachings, good example, and the zeal he shows in the service of God and 

His Majesty, he will advise and direct what is most advantageous to the best results.  Valladolid 

23rd of February 1544, Idem, etc.  THE PRINCE. Presidents and Auditors of Our Audiencia and 

Royal Chancellery of the Confines: know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, on account of 

the good reports he had of the character, life, and habits of the Reverend Fray Bartholomew de 

Las Casas, has presented him to the bishopric of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa. 

With a view to the good results we hope he will achieve in instructing and converting the natives of 

his diocese, we have commanded him to depart without waiting for his bulls.  Being the man he is 

and having had so much experience in the affairs of those parts, we have entrusted to him to let 

us know what is happening over there, and what is necessary for the service of God our Lord in 

that country and among its natives. Therefore I charge and command you that whenever the said 

bishop has anything to relate to you you will listen and endeavour to help him in the service of 

God, your Father and ours.  And in whatever befalls him, you will help and favour and honour him, 

according as his dignity demands.  Valladolid, 13th of February 1544--I, the Prince--by command 

of His Highness Juan de Samano, signed by the Bishop of Cuenca and the licentiate Gutierrez 

Velasquez, Gregorio Lopez y Salmeron.  THE PRINCE.  President and judges of our Council and 

of Our Royal Chancellery of the Confines; know ye that the Emperor King, my sovereign, 

presented the bishopric of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa to the licentiate Arteaga, 

and His Holiness, in response to the said representation, conferred it upon him.  After his death, 

His Majesty, presented the said bishopric to Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, whom we have 

commanded to depart without waiting for his bulls, and to fulfil the good we hope he will 

accomplish among the natives of the said bishopric. And that he may know the limits of the said 

bishopric, dividing it from the bishoprics of Guatemala, Honduras, Tiascala, and Guascaco, I 

command that upon his arrival there, you show him the limits to which the said bishopric of Chiapa 

extends.  Bearing in mind how the said Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas has served and will serve 

us, and the good he can do in the conversion of the natives in the said bishopric, the boundaries 

which will be pointed out to him must be quite distinct from the other bishoprics of the country, for 

as long as it is our wish--Dated in the town of Valladolid 13th day of February 1544--I, the Prince, 

etc.  THE PRINCE.  President and judges of our Audiencia and Royal Chancery of the Confines. 

Fray Bartholomew de Las Casas, bishop-elect of the city of Ciudad Real of the plains of Chiapa, 

has informed me, and we all well know, that he and the other priests of his Order have worked 

hard to bring peace to the provinces of Teculatlan, Lacandon, and others that were engaged in 

warfare; these provinces are situated within the limits of the bishopric and he beseeches me, since 

he and the said priests have understood and are endeavouring to bring peace to the said 



provinces, to be good enough to order that they shall be included within the limits of his diocese; 

thus included, he would work with more love and zeal than any former prelate to convert the 

natives to a knowledge of the Holy Catholic Faith, according to our wishes.  Our Council of the 

Indies having considered this, it was agreed that I should send you this my cedula, and as I 

approved, I command you to see to the above.  Should the said provinces of Teculatlan and 

Lacandon be outside the limits of the said diocese of Chiapa, you will arrange that the said Fray 

Bartholomew de Las Casas has them under his charge as prelate, until His Holiness, upon our 

presentation, appoints a prelate over the said provinces.  Let the said bishop-elect have charge of 

the spiritual affairs in those provinces and as prelate take a fourth part of the tithes which belong to 

him in the said provinces; the other three quarters shall be distributed among the ecclesiastical 

ministries already in existence in the said provinces and in the repairs and the decorations of the 

churches of them.  Dated in Valladolid thirteenth day of February 1544--I, the Prince, etc.

give the full cast of "Cathleen ni Houlihan," which was first played at St. Teresa's Hall, Dublin, on 

April 3, 1902, for I have been searching the cupboard of the Abbey Theatre, where we keep old 

Play-bills, and can find no record of it, nor did the newspapers of the time mention more than the 

principals. Mr. W. G. Fay played the old countryman, and Miss Quinn his wife, while Miss Maude 

Gonne was Cathleen ni Houlihan, and very magnificently she played. The Play has been 

constantly revived, and has, I imagine, been played more often than any other, except perhaps 

Lady Gregory's "Spreading the News," at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin.  The "Hour-Glass" was first 

played at the Molesworth Hall, Dublin, on March 14, 1903, with the following cast:--  The Wise 

Man                             J. W. Digges Bridget, his wife                      Maire T. Quinn Her children

NANNY         }     ACT I  SCENE: _Interior of a coach builder's workshop. Parts of a gilded coach, 

among them an ornament representing the lion and the unicorn._ THOMAS _working at a wheel._ 

FATHER JOHN _coming from door of inner room._   FATHER JOHN. I have prayed over Martin. I 

have prayed a long time, but there is no move in him yet.  THOMAS. You are giving yourself too 

much trouble, Father. It's as good for you to leave him alone till the doctor's bottle will come. If 

there is any cure at all for what is on him, it is likely the doctor will have it.  FATHER JOHN. I think 

it is not doctor's medicine will help him in this case.  THOMAS. It will, it will. The doctor has his 

business learned well. If Andrew had gone to him the time I bade him, and had not turned again to 

bring yourself to the house, it is likely Martin would be walking at this time. I am loth to trouble you, 

Father, when the business is not of your own sort. Any doctor at all should be able, and well able, 

to cure the falling sickness.  FATHER JOHN. It is not any common sickness that is on him now. 

THOMAS. I thought at the first it was gone asleep he was. But when shaking him and roaring at 

him failed to rouse him, I knew well it was the falling sickness. Believe me, the doctor will reach it 

with his drugs.  FATHER JOHN. Nothing but prayer can reach a soul that is so far beyond the 

world as his soul is at this moment.  THOMAS. You are not saying that the life is gone out of him! 

FATHER JOHN. No, no, his life is in no danger. But where he himself, the spirit, the soul, is gone, 

I cannot say. It has gone beyond our imaginings. He is fallen into a trance.  THOMAS. He used to 

be queer as a child, going asleep in the fields and coming back with talk of white horses he saw, 

and bright people like angels or whatever they were. But I mended that. I taught him to recognise 

stones beyond angels with a few strokes of a rod. I would never give in to visions or to trances. 

FATHER JOHN. We who hold the faith have no right to speak against trance or vision. St. Teresa 

had them, St. Benedict, St. Anthony, St. Columcille. St. Catherine of Sienna often lay a long time 

as if dead.  THOMAS. That might be so in the olden time, but those things are gone out of the 

world now. Those that do their work fair and honest have no occasion to let the mind go rambling. 

What would send my nephew, Martin Hearne, into a trance, supposing trances to be in it, and he 

rubbing the gold on the lion and unicorn that he had taken in hand to make a good job of for the 

top of the coach?  FATHER JOHN [_taking it up_]. It is likely it was that sent him off. The flashing 

of light upon it would be enough to throw one that had a disposition to it into a trance. There was a 

very saintly man, though he was not of our church, he wrote a great book called "Mysterium 

Magnum," was seven days in a trance. Truth, or whatever truth he found, fell upon him like a 

bursting shower, and he a poor tradesman at his work. It was a ray of sunlight on a pewter vessel 

that was the beginning of all. [_Goes to the door of inner room._] There is no stir in him yet. It is 

either the best thing or the worst thing can happen to anyone that is happening to him now. 

THOMAS. And what in the living world can happen to a man that is asleep on his bed?  FATHER 

JOHN. There are some would answer you that it is to those who are awake that nothing happens, 

and it is they that know nothing. He is gone where all have gone for supreme truth.  THOMAS 

[_sitting down again and taking up tools_]. Well, maybe so. But work must go on and coach 

building must go on, and they will not go on the time there is too much attention given to dreams. 

A dream is a sort of a shadow, no profit in it to anyone at all. A coach now is a real thing and a 



thing that will last for generations and be made use of the last, and maybe turn to be a hen-roost 

at its latter end.  FATHER JOHN. I think Andrew told me it was a dream of Martin's that led to the 

making of that coach.  THOMAS. Well, I believe he saw gold in some dream, and it led him to 

want to make some golden thing, and coaches being the handiest, nothing would do him till he put 

the most of his fortune into the making of this golden coach. It turned out better than I thought, for 

some of the lawyers came looking at it at assize time, and through them it was heard of at Dublin 

Castle ... and who now has it ordered but the Lord Lieutenant! [FATHER JOHN _nods._] Ready it 

must be and sent off it must be by the end of the month. It is likely King George will be visiting 

Dublin, and it is he himself will be sitting in it yet.  FATHER JOHN. Martin has been working hard 

at it, I know.  THOMAS. You never saw a man work the way he did, day and night, near ever since 

the time, six months ago, he first came home from France.  FATHER JOHN. I never thought he 

would be so good at a trade. I thought his mind was only set on books.  THOMAS. He should be 

thankful to myself for that. Any person I will take in hand I make a clean job of them the same as I 

would make of any other thing in my yard, coach, half coach, hackney-coach, ass car, common 

car, post-chaise, calash, chariot on two wheels, on four wheels. Each one has the shape Thomas 

Hearne put on it, and it in his hands; and what I can do with wood and iron, why would I not be 

able to do it with flesh and blood, and it in a way my own?  FATHER JOHN. Indeed I know you did 

your best for Martin.  THOMAS. Every best. Checked him, taught him the trade, sent him to the 

monastery in France for to learn the language and to see the wide world; but who should know 

that if you did not know it, Father John, and I doing it according to your own advice?  FATHER 

JOHN. I thought his nature needed spiritual guidance and teaching, the best that could be found. 

THOMAS. I thought myself it was best for him to be away for a while. There are too many wild lads 

about this place. He to have stopped here, he might have taken some fancies and got into some 

trouble, going against the Government, maybe, the same as Johnny Gibbons that is at this time an 

outlaw having a price upon his head.  FATHER JOHN. That is so. That imagination of his might 

have taken fire here at home. It was better putting him with the Brothers, to turn it to imaginings of 

heaven.  THOMAS. Well, I will soon have a good hardy tradesman made of him now that will live 

quiet and rear a family, and maybe be appointed coach builder to the royal family at the last. 

FATHER JOHN [_at window_]. I see your brother Andrew coming back from the doctor; he is 

stopping to talk with a troop of beggars that are sitting by the side of the road.  THOMAS. There 

now is another that I have shaped. Andrew used to be a bit wild in his talk and in his ways, 

wanting to go rambling, not content to settle in the place where he was reared. But I kept a guard 

over him; I watched the time poverty gave him a nip, and then I settled him into the business. He 

never was so good a worker as Martin; he is too fond of wasting his time talking vanities. But he is 

middling handy, and he is always steady and civil to customers. I have no complaint worth while to 

be making this last twenty years against Andrew. [ANDREW _comes in._]  ANDREW. Beggars 

there are outside going the road to the Kinvara fair. They were saying there is news that Johnny 

Gibbons is coming back from France on the quiet. The king's soldiers are watching the ports for 

him.  THOMAS. Let you keep now, Andrew, to the business you have in hand. Will the doctor be 

coming himself, or did he send a bottle that will cure Martin?  ANDREW. The doctor can't come, 

for he is down with lumbago in the back. He questioned me as to what ailed Martin, and he got a 

book to go looking for a cure, and he began telling me things out of it, but I said I could not be 



carrying things of that sort in my head. He gave me the book then, and he has marks put in it for 

the places where the cures are ... wait now ... [_Reads._] "Compound medicines are usually taken 

inwardly, or outwardly applied. Inwardly taken they should be either liquid or solid; outwardly they 

should be fomentations or sponges wet in some decoctions."  THOMAS. He had a right to have 

written it out himself upon a paper. Where is the use of all that?  ANDREW. I think I moved the 

mark maybe ... here now is the part he was reading to me himself ... "the remedies for diseases 

belonging to the skins next the brain: headache, vertigo, cramp, convulsions, palsy, incubus, 

apoplexy, falling sickness."  THOMAS. It is what I bid you to tell him--that it was the falling 

sickness.  ANDREW [_dropping book_]. O my dear, look at all the marks gone out of it. Wait now, 

I partly remember what he said ... a blister he spoke of ... or to be smelling hartshorn ... or the 

sneezing powder ... or if all fails, to try letting the blood.  FATHER JOHN. All this has nothing to do 

with the real case. It is all waste of time.  ANDREW. That is what I was thinking myself, Father. 

Sure it was I was the first to call out to you when I saw you coming down from the hillside and to 

bring you in to see what could you do. I would have more trust in your means than in any doctor's 

learning. And in case you might fail to cure him, I have a cure myself I heard from my grandmother 

... God rest her soul ... and she told me she never knew it to fail. A person to have the falling 

sickness, to cut the top of his nails and a small share of the hair of his head, and to put it down on 

the floor and to take a harry-pin and drive it down with that into the floor and to leave it there. "That 

is the cure will never fail," she said, "to rise up any person at all having the falling sickness." 

FATHER JOHN [_hands on ears_]. I will go back to the hillside, I will go back to the hillside, but 

no, no, I must do what I can, I will go again, I will wrestle, I will strive my best to call him back with 

prayer. [_Goes into room and shuts door._]  ANDREW. It is queer Father John is sometimes, and 

very queer. There are times when you would say that he believes in nothing at all.  THOMAS. If 

you wanted a priest, why did you not get our own parish priest that is a sensible man, and a man 

that you would know what his thoughts are? You know well the Bishop should have something 

against Father John to have left him through the years in that poor mountainy place, minding the 

few unfortunate people that were left out of the last famine. A man of his learning to be going in 

rags the way he is, there must be some good cause for that.  ANDREW. I had all that in mind and I 

bringing him. But I thought he would have done more for Martin than what he is doing. To read a 

Mass over him I thought he would, and to be convulsed in the reading it, and some strange thing 

to have gone out with a great noise through the doorway.  THOMAS. It would give no good name 

to the place such a thing to be happening in it. It is well enough for labouring men and for half-acre 

men. It would be no credit at all such a thing to be heard of in this house, that is for coach building 

the capital of the county.  ANDREW. If it is from the devil this sickness comes, it would be best to 

put it out whatever way it would be put out. But there might no bad thing be on the lad at all. It is 

likely he was with wild companions abroad, and that knocking about might have shaken his health. 

I was that way myself one time....  THOMAS. Father John said that it was some sort of a vision or 

a trance, but I would give no heed to what he would say. It is his trade to see more than other 

people would see, the same as I myself might be seeing a split in a leather car hood that no other 

person would find out at all.  ANDREW. If it is the falling sickness is on him, I have no objection to 

that ... a plain, straight sickness that was cast as a punishment on the unbelieving Jews. It is a 

thing that might attack one of a family and one of another family and not to come upon their 



kindred at all. A person to have it, all you have to do is not to go between him and the wind or fire 

or water. But I am in dread trance is a thing might run through the house, the same as the cholera 

morbus.  THOMAS. In my belief there is no such thing as a trance. Letting on people do be to 

make the world wonder the time they think well to rise up. To keep them to their work is best, and 

not to pay much attention to them at all.  ANDREW. I would not like trances to be coming on 

myself. I leave it in my will if I die without cause, a holly stake to be run through my heart the way I 

will lie easy after burial, and not turn my face downwards in my coffin. I tell you I leave it on you in 

my will.  THOMAS. Leave thinking of your own comforts, Andrew, and give your mind to the 

business. Did the smith put the irons yet on to the shafts of this coach?  ANDREW. I'll go see did 

he.  THOMAS. Do so, and see did he make a good job of it. Let the shafts be sound and solid if 

they _are_ to be studded with gold.  ANDREW. They are, and the steps along with them ... glass 

sides for the people to be looking in at the grandeur of the satin within ... the lion and the unicorn 

crowning all ... it was a great thought Martin had the time he thought of making this coach! 

THOMAS. It is best for me go see the smith myself ... and leave it to no other one. You can be 

attending to that ass car out in the yard wants a new tyre in the wheel ... out in the rear of the yard 

it is. [_They go to door._] To pay attention to every small thing, and to fill up every minute of time, 

shaping whatever you have to do, that is the way to build up a business. [_They go out._] 

FATHER JOHN [_bringing in_ MARTIN]. They are gone out now ... the air is fresher here in the 

workshop ... you can sit here for a while. You are now fully awake; you have been in some sort of 

a trance or a sleep.  MARTIN. Who was it that pulled at me? Who brought me back?  FATHER 

JOHN. It is I, Father John, did it. I prayed a long time over you and brought you back.  MARTIN. 

You, Father John, to be so unkind! O leave me, leave me alone!  FATHER JOHN. You are in your 

dream still.  MARTIN. It was no dream, it was real ... do you not smell the broken fruit ... the 

grapes ... the room is full of the smell.  FATHER JOHN. Tell me what you have seen where you 

have been.  MARTIN. There were horses ... white horses rushing by, with white, shining riders ... 

there was a horse without a rider, and someone caught me up and put me upon him, and we rode 

away, with the wind, like the wind....  FATHER JOHN. That is a common imagining. I know many 

poor persons have seen that.  MARTIN. We went on, on, on ... we came to a sweet-smelling 

garden with a gate to it ... and there were wheat-fields in full ear around ... and there were 

vineyards like I saw in France, and the grapes in bunches ... I thought it to be one of the town-

lands of heaven. Then I saw the horses we were on had changed to unicorns, and they began 

trampling the grapes and breaking them ... I tried to stop them, but I could not.  FATHER JOHN. 

That is strange, that is strange. What is it that brings to mind ... I heard it in some place, 

_Monocoros di Astris_, the Unicorn from the Stars.  MARTIN. They tore down the wheat and 

trampled it on stones, and then they tore down what were left of the grapes and crushed and 

bruised and trampled them ... I smelt the wine, it was flowing on every side ... then everything 

grew vague ... I cannot remember clearly ... everything was silent ... the trampling now stopped ... 

we were all waiting for some command. Oh! was it given! I was trying to hear it ... there was some 

one dragging, dragging me away from that ... I am sure there was a command given ... and there 

was a great burst of laughter. What was it? What was the command? Everything seemed to 

tremble around me.  FATHER JOHN. Did you awake then?  MARTIN. I do not think I did ... it all 

changed ... it was terrible, wonderful. I saw the unicorns trampling, trampling ... but not in the wine 



troughs.... Oh, I forget! Why did you waken me?  FATHER JOHN. I did not touch you. Who knows 

what hands pulled you away? I prayed; that was all I did. I prayed very hard that you might awake. 

If I had not, you might have died. I wonder what it all meant. The unicorns ... what did the French 

monk tell me ... strength they meant ... virginal strength, a rushing, lasting, tireless strength. 

MARTIN. They were strong.... Oh, they made a great noise with their trampling!  FATHER JOHN. 

And the grapes ... what did they mean?... It puts me in mind of the psalm ... _Ex calix meus 

inebrians quam praeclarus est._ It was a strange vision, a very strange vision, a very strange 

vision.  MARTIN. How can I get back to that place?  FATHER JOHN. You must not go back, you 

must not think of doing that; that life of vision, of contemplation, is a terrible life, for it has far more 

of temptation in it than the common life. Perhaps it would have been best for you to stay under 

rules in the monastery.  MARTIN. I could not see anything so clearly there. It is back here in my 

own place the visions come, in the place where shining people used to laugh around me and I a 

little lad in a bib.  FATHER JOHN. You cannot know but it was from the Prince of this world the 

vision came. How can one ever know unless one follows the discipline of the church? Some 

spiritual director, some wise, learned man, that is what you want. I do not know enough. What am I 

but a poor banished priest with my learning forgotten, my books never handled, and spotted with 

the damp?  MARTIN. I will go out into the fields where you cannot come to me to awake me ... I 

will see that townland again ... I will hear that command. I cannot wait, I must know what 

happened, I must bring that command to mind again.  FATHER JOHN [_putting himself between_ 

MARTIN _and the door_]. You must have patience as the saints had it. You are taking your own 

way. If there is a command from God for you, you must wait His good time to receive it.  MARTIN. 

Must I live here forty years, fifty years ... to grow as old as my uncles, seeing nothing but common 

things, doing work ... some foolish work?  FATHER JOHN. Here they are coming. It is time for me 

to go. I must think and I must pray. My mind is troubled about you. [_To_ THOMAS _as he and_ 

ANDREW _come in._] Here he is; be very kind to him, for he has still the weakness of a little child. 

[_Goes out._]  THOMAS. Are you well of the fit, lad?  MARTIN. It was no fit. I was away ... for a 

while ... no, you will not believe me if I tell you.  ANDREW. I would believe it, Martin. I used to have 

very long sleeps myself and very queer dreams.  THOMAS. You had, till I cured you, taking you in 

hand and binding you to the hours of the clock. The cure that will cure yourself, Martin, and will 

waken you, is to put the whole of your mind on to your golden coach, to take it in hand, and to 

finish it out of face.  MARTIN. Not just now. I want to think ... to try and remember what I saw, 

something that I heard, that I was told to do.  THOMAS. No, but put it out of your mind. There is no 

man doing business that can keep two things in his head. A Sunday or a Holyday now you might 

go see a good hurling or a thing of the kind, but to be spreading out your mind on anything outside 

of the workshop on common days, all coach building would come to an end.  MARTIN. I don't think 

it is building I want to do. I don't think that is what was in the command.  THOMAS. It is too late to 

be saying that the time you have put the most of your fortune in the business. Set yourself now to 

finish your job, and when it is ended, maybe I won't begrudge you going with the coach as far as 

Dublin.  ANDREW. That is it; that will satisfy him. I had a great desire myself, and I young, to go 

travelling the roads as far as Dublin. The roads are the great things; they never come to an end. 

They are the same as the serpent having his tail swallowed in his own mouth.  MARTIN. It was not 

wandering I was called to. What was it? What was it?  THOMAS. What you are called to, and what 



everyone having no great estate is called to, is to work. Sure the world itself could not go on 

without work.  MARTIN. I wonder if that is the great thing, to make the world go on. No, I don't 

think that is the great thing ... what does the Munster poet call it ... "this crowded slippery coach-

loving world." I don't think I was told to work for that.  ANDREW. I often thought that myself. It is a 

pity the stock of the Hearnes to be asked to do any work at all.  THOMAS. Rouse yourself, Martin, 

and don't be talking the way a fool talks. You started making that golden coach, and you were set 

upon it, and you had me tormented about it. You have yourself wore out working at it and planning 

it and thinking of it, and at the end of the race, when you have the winning post in sight, and 

horses hired for to bring it to Dublin Castle, you go falling into sleeps and blathering about dreams, 

and we run to a great danger of letting the profit and the sale go by. Sit down on the bench now, 

and lay your hands to the work.  MARTIN [_sitting down_]. I will try. I wonder why I ever wanted to 

make it; it was no good dream set me doing that. [_He takes up wheel._] What is there in a 

wooden wheel to take pleasure in it? Gilding it outside makes it no different.  THOMAS. That is 

right now. You had some good plan for making the axle run smooth.  MARTIN [_letting wheel fall 

and putting his hands to his head_]. It is no use. [_Angrily._] Why did you send the priest to awake 

me? My soul is my own and my mind is my own. I will send them to where I like. You have no 

authority over my thoughts.  THOMAS. That is no way to be speaking to me. I am head of this 

business. Nephew or no nephew, I will have no one come cold or unwilling to the work.  MARTIN. I 

had better go. I am of no use to you. I am going.... I must be alone.... I will forget if I am not alone. 

Give me what is left of my money, and I will go out of this.  THOMAS [_opening a press and taking 

out a bag and throwing it to him_]. There is what is left of your money! The rest of it you have 

spent on the coach. If you want to go, go, and I will not have to be annoyed with you from this out. 

ANDREW. Come now with me, Thomas. The boy is foolish, but it will soon pass over. He has not 

my sense to be giving attention to what you will say. Come along now; leave him for a while; leave 

him to me, I say; it is I will get inside his mind.            [_He leads_ THOMAS _out._ MARTIN, 

_when they have gone, sits           down, taking up lion and unicorn._]  MARTIN. I think it was 

some shining thing I saw.... What was it?  ANDREW [_opening door and putting in his head_]. 

Listen to me, Martin.  MARTIN. Go away--no more talking--leave me alone.  ANDREW [_coming 

in_]. Oh, but wait. I understand you. Thomas doesn't understand your thoughts, but I understand 

them. Wasn't I telling you I was just like you once?  MARTIN. Like me? Did you ever see the other 

things, the things beyond?  ANDREW. I did. It is not the four walls of the house keep me content. 

Thomas doesn't know, oh, no, he doesn't know.  MARTIN. No, he has no vision.  ANDREW. He 

has not, nor any sort of a heart for frolic.  MARTIN. He has never heard the laughter and the music 

beyond.  ANDREW. He has not, nor the music of my own little flute. I have it hidden in the thatch 

outside.  MARTIN. Does the body slip from you as it does from me? They have not shut your 

window into eternity?  ANDREW. Thomas never shut a window I could not get through. I knew you 

were one of my own sort. When I am sluggish in the morning Thomas says, "Poor Andrew is 

getting old." That is all he knows. The way to keep young is to do the things youngsters do. 

Twenty years I have been slipping away, and he never found me out yet!  MARTIN. That is what 

they call ecstasy, but there is no word that can tell out very plain what it means. That freeing of the 

mind from its thoughts. Those wonders we know; when we put them into words, the words seem 

as little like them as blackberries are like the moon and sun.  ANDREW. I found that myself the 



time they knew me to be wild, and used to be asking me to say what pleasure did I find in cards, 

and women, and drink.  MARTIN. You might help me to remember that vision I had this morning, 

to understand it. The memory of it has slipped from me. Wait; it is coming back, little by little. I 

know that I saw the unicorns trampling, and then a figure, a many-changing figure, holding some 

bright thing. I knew something was going to happen or to be said, ... something that would make 

my whole life strong and beautiful like the rushing of the unicorns, and then, and then....  JOHNNY 

BACACH'S VOICE [_at window_]. A poor person I am, without food, without a way, without 

portion, without costs, without a person or a stranger, without means, without hope, without health, 

without warmth....  ANDREW [_looking towards window_]. It is that troop of beggars; bringing their 

tricks and their thieveries they are to the Kinvara fair.  MARTIN [_impatiently_]. There is no quiet ... 

come to the other room. I am trying to remember....            [_They go to door of inner room, but_ 

ANDREW _stops him._]  ANDREW. They are a bad-looking fleet. I have a mind to drive them 

away, giving them a charity.  MARTIN. Drive them away or come away from their voices. 

ANOTHER VOICE. I put under the power of my prayer,      All that will give me help,     Rafael 

keep him Wednesday;     Sachiel feed him Thursday;     Hamiel provide him Friday;     Cassiel 

increase him Saturday.  Sure giving to us is giving to the Lord and laying up a store in the treasury 

of heaven.  ANDREW. Whisht! He is coming in by the window! [JOHNNY B. _climbs in._] 

JOHNNY B. That I may never sin, but the place is empty!  PAUDEEN. Go in and see what can you 

make a grab at.  JOHNNY B. [_getting in_]. That every blessing I gave may be turned to a curse 

on them that left the place so bare! [_He turns things over._] I might chance something in this 

chest if it was open.... [ANDREW _begins creeping towards him._]  NANNY [_outside_]. Hurry on 

now, you limping crabfish, you! We can't be stopping here while you'll boil stirabout!  JOHNNY B. 

[_seizing bag of money and holding it up in both hands_]. Look at this now, look! [ANDREW 

_comes behind and seizes his arm._]  JOHNNY B. [_letting bag fall with a crash_]. Destruction on 

us all!  MARTIN [running forward, seizes him. Heads disappear]. That is it! Oh, I remember! That 

is what happened! That is the command! Who was it sent you here with that command?  JOHNNY 

B. It was misery sent me in and starvation and the hard ways of the world.  NANNY [_outside_]. It 

was that, my poor child, and my one son only. Show mercy to him now, and he after leaving gaol 

this morning.  MARTIN [_to_ ANDREW.]. I was trying to remember it ... when he spoke that word it 

all came back to me. I saw a bright, many-changing figure ... it was holding up a shining vessel ... 

[_holds up arms_] then the vessel fell and was broken with a great crash ... then I saw the 

unicorns trampling it. They were breaking the world to pieces ... when I saw the cracks coming, I 

shouted for joy! And I heard the command, "Destroy, destroy; destruction is the life-giver; destroy." 

ANDREW. What will we do with him? He was thinking to rob you of your gold.  MARTIN. How 

could I forget it or mistake it? It has all come upon me now ... the reasons of it all, like a flood, like 

a flooded river.  JOHNNY B. [_weeping_]. It was the hunger brought me in and the drouth. 

MARTIN. Were you given any other message? Did you see the unicorns?  JOHNNY B. I saw 

nothing and heard nothing; near dead I am with the fright I got and with the hardship of the gaol. 

MARTIN. To destroy ... to overthrow all that comes between us and God, between us and that 

shining country. To break the wall, Andrew, the thing, whatever it is that comes between, but 

where to begin?...  ANDREW. What is it you are talking about?  MARTIN. It may be that this man 

is the beginning. He has been sent ... the poor, they have nothing, and so they can see heaven as 



we cannot. He and his comrades will understand me. But now to give all men high hearts that they 

may all understand.  JOHNNY B. It's the juice of the grey barley will do that.  ANDREW. To rise 

everybody's heart, is it? Is it that was your meaning?... If you will take the blame of it all, I'll do 

what you want. Give me the bag of money, then. [_He takes it up._] Oh, I've a heart like your own! 

I'll lift the world too! The people will be running from all parts. Oh, it will be a great day in this 

district.  JOHNNY B. Will I go with you?  MARTIN. No, you must stay here; we have things to do 

and to plan.  JOHNNY B. Destroyed we all are with the hunger and the drouth.  MARTIN. Go then, 

get food and drink, whatever is wanted to give you strength and courage; gather your people 

together here; bring them all in. We have a great thing to do. I have to begin ... I want to tell it to 

the whole world. Bring them in, bring them in, I will make the house ready.   ACT II  SCENE: The 

same workshop a few minutes later. MARTIN. seen arranging mugs and bread, etc., on a table. 

FATHER JOHN comes in, knocking at open door as he comes.   MARTIN. Come in, come in, I 

have got the house ready. Here is bread and meat ... everybody is welcome. [Hearing no answer, 

turns round.]  FATHER JOHN. Martin, I have come back.... There is something I want to say to 

you.  MARTIN. You are welcome; there are others coming.... They are not of your sort, but all are 

welcome.  FATHER JOHN. I have remembered suddenly something that I read when I was in the 

seminary.  MARTIN. You seem very tired.  FATHER JOHN [_sitting down_]. I had almost got back 

to my own place when I thought of it. I have run part of the way. It is very important. It is about the 

trance that you have been in. When one is inspired from above, either in trance or in 

contemplation, one remembers afterwards all that one has seen and read. I think there must be 

something about it in St. Thomas. I know that I have read a long passage about it years ago. But, 

Martin, there is another kind of inspiration, or rather an obsession or possession. A diabolical 

power comes into one's body or overshadows it. Those whose bodies are taken hold of in this 

way, jugglers and witches and the like, can often tell what is happening in distant places, or what 

is going to happen, but when they come out of that state, they remember nothing. I think you said--

--  MARTIN. That I could not remember.  FATHER JOHN. You remembered something, but not all. 

Nature is a great sleep; there are dangerous and evil spirits in her dreams, but God is above 

Nature. She is a darkness, but He makes everything clear--He is light.  MARTIN. All is clear now. I 

remember all, or all that matters to me. A poor man brought me a word, and I know what I have to 

do.  FATHER JOHN. Ah, I understand; words were put into his mouth. I have read of such things. 

God sometimes uses some common man as His messenger.  MARTIN. You may have passed the 

man who brought it on the road. He left me but now.  FATHER JOHN. Very likely, very likely, that 

is the way it happened. Some plain, unnoticed man has sometimes been sent with a command. 

MARTIN. I saw the unicorns trampling in my dream. They were breaking the world. I am to 

destroy, that is the word the messenger spoke.  FATHER JOHN. To destroy?  MARTIN. To bring 

again the old disturbed exalted life, the old splendour.  FATHER JOHN. You are not the first that 

dream has come to. [_Gets up and walks up and down._] It has been wandering here and there, 

calling now to this man, now to that other. It is a terrible dream.  MARTIN. Father John, you have 

had the same thought.  FATHER JOHN. Men were holy then; there were saints everywhere, there 

was reverence, but now it is all work, business, how to live a long time. Ah, if one could change it 

all in a minute, even by war and violence.... There is a cell where St. Ciaran used to pray, if one 

could bring that time again.  MARTIN. Do not deceive me. You have had the command.  FATHER 



JOHN. Why are you questioning me? You are asking me things that I have told to no one but my 

confessor.  MARTIN. We must gather the crowds together, you and I.  FATHER JOHN. I have 

dreamed your dream; it was long ago. I had your vision.  MARTIN. And what happened?  FATHER 

JOHN [_harshly_]. It was stopped. That was an end. I was sent to the lonely parish where I am, 

where there was no one I could lead astray. They have left me there. We must have patience; the 

world was destroyed by water, it has yet to be consumed by fire.  MARTIN. Why should we be 

patient? To live seventy years, and others to come after us and live seventy years it may be, and 

so from age to age, and all the while the old splendour dying more and more.            [A noise of 

shouting. ANDREW, who has been standing at the           door for a moment, comes in.] 

ANDREW. Martin says truth, and he says it well. Planing the side of a cart or a shaft, is that life? It 

is not. Sitting at a desk writing letters to the man that wants a coach or to the man that won't pay 

for the one he has got, is that life, I ask you? Thomas arguing at you and putting you down, 

"Andrew, dear Andrew, did you put the tyre on that wheel yet?" Is that life? No, it is not. I ask you 

all what do you remember when you are dead? It's the sweet cup in the corner of the widow's 

drinking house that you remember. Ha, ha, listen to that shouting! That is what the lads in the 

village will remember to the last day they live!  MARTIN. Why are they shouting? What have you 

told them?  ANDREW. Never you mind. You left that to me. You bade me to lift their hearts, and I 

did lift them. There is not one among them but will have his head like a blazing tar barrel before 

morning. What did your friend, the beggar, say? The juice of the grey barley, he said.  FATHER 

JOHN. You accursed villain! You have made them drunk!  ANDREW. Not at all, but lifting them to 

the stars. That is what Martin bade me to do, and there is no one can say I did not do it.            [_A 

shout at door and beggars push in a barrel. They all cry,           "Hi! for the noble master!" and 

point at_ ANDREW.]  JOHNNY B. It's not him, it's that one!            [_Points at_ MARTIN.] 

FATHER JOHN. Are you bringing this devil's work in at the very door? Go out of this, I say! Get 

out! Take these others with you!  MARTIN. No, no, I asked them in; they must not be turned out. 

They are my guests.  FATHER JOHN. Drive them out of your uncle's house!  MARTIN. Come, 

Father, it is better for you to go. Go back to your own place. I have taken the command. It is better, 

perhaps, for you that you did not take it. [MARTIN _and_ FATHER JOHN _go out._]  BIDDY. It is 

well for that old lad he didn't come between ourselves and our luck. It would be right to have flayed 

him and to have made bags of his skin.  NANNY. What a hurry you are in to get your enough! 

Look at the grease on your frock yet with the dint of the dabs you put in your pocket! Doing cures 

and foretellings, is it? You starved pot picker, you!  BIDDY. That you may be put up to-morrow to 

take the place of that decent son of yours that had the yard of the gaol wore with walking it till this 

morning!  NANNY. If he had, he had a mother to come to, and he would know her when he did see 

her, and that is what no son of your own could do, and he to meet you at the foot of the gallows! 

JOHNNY B. If I did know you, I knew too much of you since the first beginning of my life! What 

reward did I ever get travelling with you? What store did you give me of cattle or of goods? What 

provision did I get from you by day or by night but your own bad character to be joined on to my 

own, and I following at your heels, and your bags tied round about me?  NANNY. Disgrace

any reward or any bit I ever got from the father you had, or any honourable thing at all, but only the 

hurt and the harm of the world and its shame!  JOHNNY B. What would he give you, and you 

going with him without leave? Crooked and foolish you were always, and you begging by the side 

of the ditch.  NANNY. Begging or sharing, the curse of my heart upon you! It's better off I was 

before ever I met with you, to my cost! What was on me at all that I did not cut a scourge in the 

wood to put manners and decency on you the time you were not hardened as you are!  JOHNNY 

B. Leave talking to me of your rods and your scourges! All you taught me was robbery, and it is on 

yourself and not on myself the scourges will be laid at the day of the recognition of tricks. 

PAUDEEN. Faith, the pair of you together is better than Hector fighting before Troy!  NANNY. Ah, 

let you be quiet. It is not fighting we are craving, but the easing of the hunger that is on us and of 

the passion of sleep. Lend me a graineen of tobacco till I'll kindle my pipe--a blast of it will take the 

weight of the road off my heart.            [ANDREW _gives her some_. NANNY. _grabs at it._] 

BIDDY. No, but it's to myself you should give it. I that never smoked a pipe this forty year without 

saying the tobacco prayer. Let that one say, did ever she do that much?  NANNY. That the pain of 

your front tooth may be in your back tooth, you to be grabbing my share! [_They snap at 

tobacco._]  ANDREW. Pup, pup, pup. Don't be snapping and quarrelling now, and you so well 

treated in this house. It is strollers like yourselves should be for frolic and for fun. Have you ne'er a 

good song to sing, a song that will rise all our hearts?  PAUDEEN. Johnny Bacach is a good 

singer; it is what he used to be doing in the fairs, if the oakum of the gaol did not give him a 

hoarseness in the throat.  ANDREW. Give it out so, a good song; a song will put courage and spirit 

into any man at all.  JOHNNY B. [_singing_].      Come, all ye airy bachelors,     A warning take by 

me:     A sergeant caught me fowling,     And fired his gun so free.      His comrades came to his 

relief,     And I was soon trepanned;     And, bound up like a woodcock,     Had fallen into their 

hands.      The judge said transportation;     The ship was on the strand;     They have yoked me to 

the traces     For to plough Van Dieman's land!  ANDREW. That's no good of a song, but a 

melancholy sort of a song. I'd as lief be listening to a saw going through timber. Wait, now, till you 

will hear myself giving out a tune on the flute. [_Goes out for it._]  JOHNNY B. It is what I am 

thinking there must be a great dearth and a great scarcity of good comrades in this place, a man 

like that youngster having means in his hand to be bringing ourselves and our rags into the house. 

PAUDEEN. You think yourself very wise, Johnny Bacach. Can you tell me now who that man is? 

JOHNNY B. Some decent lad, I suppose, with a good way of living and a mind to send up his 

name upon the roads.  PAUDEEN. You that have been gaoled this eight months know little of this 

countryside.... It isn't a limping stroller like yourself the boys would let come among them. But I 

know. I went to the drill a few nights, and I skinning kids for the mountainy men. In a quarry 

beyond the drill is ... they have their plans made.... It's the square house of the Browns is to be 

made an attack on and plundered. Do you know now who is the leader they are waiting for? 

JOHNNY B. How would I know that?  PAUDEEN [_singing_].      Oh, Johnny Gibbons, my five 



hundred healths to you.     It is long you are away from us over the sea!  JOHNNY B. [_standing 

up excitedly_]. Sure that man could not be John Gibbons that is outlawed.  PAUDEEN. I asked 

news of him from the old lad [_points after_ ANDREW], and I bringing in the drink along with him. 

"Don't be asking questions," says he; "take the treat he gives you," says he. "If a lad that had a 

high heart has a mind to rouse the neighbours," says he, "and to stretch out his hand to all that 

pass the road, it is in France he learned it," says he, "the place he is but lately come from, and 

where the wine does be standing open in tubs. Take your treat when you get it," says he, "and 

make no delay, or all might be discovered and put an end to."  JOHNNY B. He came over the sea 

from France! It is Johnny

Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,       "Information about donations to the 

Project Gutenberg Literary       Archive Foundation."      - You provide a full refund of any money

does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License. 

You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the       works possessed in a 

physical medium and discontinue all use of and       all access to other copies of Project 

Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.      - You provide, in accordance surely, but it seems to 

me they were calling him by some other name.  PAUDEEN. A man on his keeping might go by a 

hundred names. Would he be telling it out to us that he never saw before, and we with that clutch 

of chattering women along with us? Here he is coming now. Wait till you see is he the lad I think 

him to be.  MARTIN [_coming in_]. I will make my banner; I will paint the Unicorn on it. Give me 

that bit of canvas; there is paint over here. We will get no help from the settled men--we will call to 

the lawbreakers, the tinkers--the sievemakers--the sheep-stealers. [_He begins to make banner._] 

BIDDY. That sounds to be a queer name of an army. Ribbons I can understand, Whiteboys, 

Rightboys, Threshers, and Peep-o'-day, but Unicorns I never heard of before.  JOHNNY B. It is 

not a queer name, but a very good name. [_Takes up Lion and Unicorn._] It is often you saw that 

before you in the dock. There is the Unicorn with the one horn, and what is it he is going against? 

The Lion of course. When he has the Lion destroyed, the Crown must fall and be shivered. Can't 

you see? It is the League of the Unicorns is the league that will fight and destroy the power of 

England and King George.  PAUDEEN. It is with that banner we will march and the lads in the 

quarry with us; it is they will have the welcome before him! It won't be long till we'll be attacking the 

Square House! Arms there are in it; riches that would smother the world; rooms full of guineas--we 

will put wax on our shoes walking them; the horses themselves shod with no less than silver! 

MARTIN [_holding up the banner_]. There it is ready! We are very few now, but the army of the 

Unicorns will be a great army! [_To_ JOHNNY B.] Why have you brought me the message? Can 

you remember any more? Has anything more come to you? Who told you to come to me? Who 

gave you the message?... Can you see anything or hear anything that is beyond the world? 

JOHNNY B. I cannot. I don't know what do you want me to tell you at all.  MARTIN. I want to begin 

the destruction, but I don't know where to begin ... you do not hear any other voice?  JOHNNY B. I 

do not. I have nothing at all to do with freemasons or witchcraft.  PAUDEEN. It is Biddy Lally has 

to do with witchcraft. It is often she threw the cups and gave out prophecies the same as 

Columcille.  MARTIN. You are one of the knowledgeable women. You can tell me where it is best 

to begin, and what will happen in the end.  BIDDY. I will foretell nothing at all. I rose out of it this 

good while, with the stiffness and the swelling it brought upon my joints.  MARTIN. If you have 

foreknowledge, you have no right to keep silent. If you do not help me, I may go to work in the 

wrong way. I know I have to destroy, but when I ask myself what I am to begin with, I am full of 



uncertainty.  PAUDEEN. Here now are the cups handy and the leavings in them.  BIDDY [_taking 

cups and pouring one from another_]. Throw a bit of white money into the four corners of the 

house.  MARTIN. There! [_Throwing it._]  BIDDY. There can be nothing told without silver. It is not 

myself will have the profit of it. Along with that I will be forced to throw out gold.  MARTIN. There is 

a guinea for you. Tell me what comes before your eyes.  BIDDY. What is it you are wanting to 

have news of?  MARTIN. Of what I have to go out against at the beginning ... there is so much ... 

the whole world, it may be.  BIDDY [_throwing from one cup to another and looking_]. You have 

no care for yourself. You have been across the sea; you are not long back. You are coming within 

the best day of your life.  MARTIN. What is it? What is it I have to do?  BIDDY. I see a great 

smoke, I see burning ... there is a great smoke overhead.  MARTIN. That means we have to burn 

away a great deal that men have piled up upon the earth. We must bring men once more to the 

wildness of the clean green earth.  BIDDY. Herbs for my healing, the big herb and the little herb; it 

is true enough they get their great strength out of the earth.  JOHNNY B. Who was it the green sod 

of Ireland belonged to in the olden times? Wasn't it to the ancient race it belonged? And who has 

possession of it now but the race that came robbing over the sea? The meaning of that is to 

destroy the big houses and the towns, and the fields to be given back to the ancient race. 

MARTIN. That is it. You don't put it as I do, but what matter? Battle is all.  PAUDEEN. Columcille 

said the four corners to be burned, and then the middle of the field to be burned. I tell you it was 

Columcille's prophecy said that.  BIDDY. Iron handcuffs I see and a rope and a gallows, and it 

maybe is not for yourself I see it, but for some I have acquaintance with a good way back. 

MARTIN. That means the law. We must destroy the law. That was the first sin, the first mouthful of 

the apple.  JOHNNY B. So it was, so it was. The law is the worst loss. The ancient law was for the 

benefit of all. It is the law of the English is the only sin.  MARTIN. When there were no laws men 

warred on one another and man to man, not with one machine against another as they do now, 

and they grew hard and strong in body. They were altogether alive

any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the       electronic work is 

discovered and reported to you within 90 days of       receipt of the work.      - You comply with all 

other terms of this agreement for free       distribution of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK 

SIGN~} works.   1.E.9.   If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE 

MARK SIGN~} electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this 

agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} 

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.   1.F.   1.F.1.   Project 

Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research 

on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE 

MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} 

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, 

but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other 

intellectual property infringement, a defective them in His image, like people in that unfallen 

country. But presently they thought it better to be safe, as if safety mattered, or anything but the 

exaltation of the heart and to have eyes that danger had made grave and piercing. We must 

overthrow the laws and banish them!  JOHNNY B. It is what I say, to put out the laws is to put out 

the whole nation of the English. Laws for themselves they made for their own profit and left us 

nothing at all, no more than a dog or a sow.  BIDDY. An old priest I see, and I would not say is he 

the one was here or another. Vexed and troubled he is, kneeling fretting, and ever fretting, in some 

lonesome, ruined place.  MARTIN. I thought it would come to that. Yes, the church too ... that is to 

be destroyed. Once men fought with their desires and their fears, with all that they call their sins, 

unhelped, and their souls became hard and strong. When we have brought back the clean earth 

and destroyed the law and the church, all life will become like a flame of fire, like a burning eye.... 

Oh, how to find words for it all ... all that is not life will pass away!  JOHNNY B. It is Luther's church 

he means, and the humpbacked discourse of Seaghan Calvin's Bible. So we will break it and 

make an end of it.  MARTIN

consume the world, we will burn it away. Father John said the world has yet to be consumed by 

fire. Bring me fire.  ANDREW. Here is Thomas coming! [_All except_ MARTIN _hurry into next 

room._ THOMAS _comes in._]  THOMAS. Come with me, Martin. There is terrible work going on 

in the town! There is mischief gone abroad! Very strange things are happening!  MARTIN. What 

are you talking of? What has happened?  THOMAS. Come along, I say; it must be put a stop to! 

We must call to every decent man!... It is as if the devil himself had gone through the town on a 

blast and set every drinking house open!  MARTIN. I wonder how that has happened. Can it have 

anything to do with Andrew's plan?  THOMAS. Are you giving no heed to what I'm saying? There 

is not a man, I tell you, in the parish, and beyond the parish, but has left the work he was doing, 

whether in the field or in the mill.  MARTIN. Then all work has come to an end? Perhaps that was 

a good thought of Andrew's.  THOMAS. There is not a man has come to sensible years that is not 

drunk or drinking! My own labourers

the spirits and the porter and the shouting and the cheering within made the hair to rise up on my 

scalp.  MARTIN. And there is not one of them that does not feel that he could bridle the four winds. 

THOMAS [_sitting down in despair_]. You are drunk, too. I never thought you had a fancy for it. 

MARTIN. It is hard for you to understand. You have worked all your life. You have said to yourself 

every morning, "What is to be done to-day?" and when you are tired out you have thought of the 

next day's work. If you gave yourself an hour's idleness, it was but that you might work the better. 

Yet it is only when one has put work away that one begins to live.  THOMAS. It is those French 

wines that did it.  MARTIN. I have been beyond the earth, in paradise, in that happy townland. I 

have seen the shining people. They were all doing one thing or another, but not one of them was 

at work. All that they did was but the overflowing of their idleness, and their days were a dance 

bred of the secret frenzy of their hearts, or a battle where the sword made a sound that was like 

laughter.  THOMAS.

the production, promotion have minded you better.  MARTIN. No man can be alive, and what is 

paradise but fulness of life, if whatever he sets his hand to in the daylight cannot carry him from 

exaltation to exaltation, and if he does not rise into the frenzy of contemplation in the night silence. 

Events that are not begotten in joy are misbegotten and darken the world, and nothing is begotten 

in joy if the joy of a thousand years has not been crushed into a moment.  THOMAS. And I offered 

to let you go to Dublin in the

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE 

MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any _and the beggars have returned cautiously._]  MARTIN [_giving 

banner to_ PAUDEEN]. Give me the lamp. The lamp has not yet been lighted, and the world is to 

be consumed! [_Goes into inner room._]  THOMAS [_seeing_ ANDREW]. Is it here you are, 

Andrew? What are the beggars doing? Was this door thrown open, too?... Why did you not keep 

order? I will go for the constables to help us!  ANDREW. You will not find them to

You are a disgrace.  ANDREW. Disgrace yourself! Coming here to be making an attack on me and 

badgering me and disparaging me. And what about yourself that turned me to be a hypocrite? 

THOMAS. What are
