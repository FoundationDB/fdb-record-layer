ring for him. He=20

had received frequent visits from his comrades in the Guards, and from othe=

but now he turned gladly to welcome one whom he had not seen since the nigh=
t of the assault.=20

=E2=80=9CMichael Ivanovitch!=E2=80=9D he exclaimed; =E2=80=9CI am delighted=
 to see you.=E2=80=9D  Michael returned his greeting with=20

respectful and affectionate warmth, and they sat down to talk over all that=
 had happened. The=20

change in Ivan=E2=80=99s appearance shocked and grieved his old playfellow.=
  =E2=80=9CYou look so pale and worn,=20

Barrinka,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CHave they been good to you here?=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CMost kind and good,=E2=80=9D said Ivan. =E2=80=9CI have=20

had the best of care and nursing. But oh, Michael, I have been longing to t=
ell you the luck the=20

bandage brought me which you placed on my wound. It was wonderful!=E2=80=9D=
 And he told the story of=20

his acquaintance with the De Talmonts. =E2=80=9CNothing can exceed their ki=
ndness to me,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CThey=20

insist upon my becoming their guest--or rather, I suppose I should say, the=
 guest of the aged=20

relative with whom they live. They are good enough to tell me she is eager =
to make my=20

acquaintance. So I go to them to-morrow; indeed, it was with difficulty I c=
ontrived to put it off so=20

long, but I could not bear to burden them with a helpless invalid.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CAh, Barrinka, you make friends=20

everywhere!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThese friends were made for me, first by you=
, then by the Czar, who has put all=20

loyal Frenchmen under infinite obligations. But tell me, Michael, what do y=
ou think of Paris? I have=20

not been there yet, you know.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, Barrinka,=E2=80=9D s=
aid Michael meditatively, and with the air of an=20

old traveller, =E2=80=9CI do not think much of it after all. I would not co=
mpare it for a moment with St.=20

Petersburg, not to speak of holy Moscow. I never saw holy Moscow until just=
 before the fire,--and=20

that was like seeing a lovely face with the hand of death upon it,--but thi=
s city of the Frenchmen is=20

nothing to it--nothing! To what it _was_, I mean,=E2=80=9D he added with a =
sigh. =E2=80=9CWhere do you see=20

anything like the great beautiful houses, painted red and green and purple =
and yellow; like the=20

roofs of burnished lead, all shining as if they were on fire; like the gild=
ed domes and crosses on=20

the tops of our churches? Napoleon himself had the wit to admire them, and =
to know he had=20

nothing half so good in his own country, so he got the dome of the H=C3=B4t=
el des Invalides gilt to look=20

like one of ours,--a Frenchman told me that himself.--Curse those Invalids!=
=E2=80=9D said Michael, with a=20

sudden change of manner and a look of gloom and ill-humour.  =E2=80=9CAnd w=
hy so? What harm have the=20

poor old fellows done to you?=E2=80=9D asked Ivan, half laughing.  =E2=80=
=9CGreat harm, Barrinka. Think of their=20

having got hold of our own Maria Ivanovka and taken her for themselves!=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYour--_who?_=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COur=20

Maria Ivanovka, who was with us from the day we left St. Petersburg until w=
e entered this same=20

city of Paris--which is no great things of a city, as I shall always say. P=
oor dear Maria Ivanovka!=20

She may have been rather old,--I don=E2=80=99t deny it,--and she _had_ a dr=
oop in her upper lip, which=20

they say is a bad sign, besides being frayed about the mouth in a sort of g=
eneral way. But the=20

Invalids will never love her and take care of her as we used to do.=E2=80=
=9D  A momentary stupefaction had=20

fallen upon Ivan; he wondered hazily whether Michael was speaking of a hosp=
ital nurse or of a=20

favourite sutler. But he prudently held his peace, and Michael went on: =E2=
=80=9CBefore the war she used=20

to take care of the Winter Palace,--there are some that say she stood in fr=
ont of it for fifty years,=20

but that I can=E2=80=99t believe. However, not a fight have we had since we=
 left St. Petersburg that she has=20

not borne a part in and done her business _well_, though it is I who say it=
. At Leipzig her carriage=20

was broken; but we mended it with a cart wheel, which answered famously.=E2=
=80=9D  Ivan understood=20

now. =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t mean to say,=E2=80=9D he exclaimed, laughin=
g heartily, =E2=80=9Cthat the Invalids have got your=20



gun! How came that about?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is no laughing matter,=20
