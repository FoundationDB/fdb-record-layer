that "all who had established themselves by 1st January 1734/35 should be f=
ree of country, county=20

and parish levies for the next three years."  Part of this expansion was du=
e to the natural increase=20

of population, the allure of new settlements where there was greater opport=
unity for advancement=20

of fortunes, and part to the tide of immigration. Years of warfare in Germa=
ny had left ruined=20

communities along the Rhenish Palatinate. For these people, Rotterdam was t=
he most convenient=20

port of embarkation and Philadelphia was often their port of debarkation. F=
ollowing in the steps of=20

John Van Metre, Adam Miller, Jacob Stover and Jost Hite who had come to the=
 Valley of Virginia=20

between 1725 and 1731, many immigrants, finding land cheaper in Virginia, l=
eft Pennsylvania and=20

took up residence in Virginia.  In 1735, the act of the Assembly passed the=
 year before for creating=20

the new county of Amelia became effective. By this act, it was ordered that=
 "the said county of=20

Prince George and that part of the parish of Bristol which lies in the same=
 be divided from the=20

mouth of Namozain Creek up the same to the main, or John Hamlin's, fork of =
the said creek,=20

thence up the south or lowest branch thereof to White Oak Hunting Path and =
thence by a south=20

course to strike Nottoway River." The land below these courses retained the=
 name of Prince=20

George. The land lying above these courses bounded "southerly by the Great =
Nottoway River=20

including part of the county of Brunswick and parish of Saint Andrew as far=
 as to take the ridges=20

between Roanoke and Appomattox Rivers and thence along those ridges to the =
great mountains=20

westerly by the said mountains and northerly by the southern boundaries of =
Goochland and=20

Henrico Counties" became Amelia County and Raleigh Parish. The name was in =
honor of the=20

youngest daughter of George II.  By 1738, people living across the Blue Rid=
ge Mountains found=20

them a barrier to frequent attendance at Orange County Court. For their con=
venience, a division=20

was ordered. "All that territory and tract of land at present deemed to be =
a part of the county of=20

Orange lying on the northwest side of the said mountains (Blue Ridge) exten=
ding from thence=20

northerly, westerly and southerly beyond the said mountains to the utmost l=
imits of Virginia" shall=20

be "separated from the rest of the said county and erected into two distinc=
t counties and parishes;=20

to be divided by a line to be run from the head spring of Hedgman River to =
the head spring by the=20

River Potomac." "That part of the said territory lying to the northeast of =
the said line beyond the top=20

of the said Blue Ridge shall be one distinct county, to be called and known=
 by the name of the=20

county of Frederick and parish of Frederick. And that the rest of the said =
territory lying on the other=20

side of the said line beyond the top of the said Blue Ridge shall be one ot=
her distinct county and=20

parish to be called by the name of the county of Augusta and parish of Augu=
sta." The counties=20

thus created honored Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II, a=
nd his wife, Augusta of=20

Saxe-Gotha, Princess of Wales. Frederick predeceased his father and it was =
Frederick's son who=20

became George III.  The Assembly had repeated with reference to Augusta and=
 Frederick=20

Counties its action in the case of Brunswick; namely: created counties befo=
re they were financially=20

able to function. Not until 1743 did Frederick have sufficient tithables to=
 begin to hold court, and it=20

The age in which we live is not less distinguished by a vigorous and succes=
sful cultivation of=20

physical science, than by its numerous and important applications to the pr=
actical arts, and to the=20

common purposes of life.  In every enlightened country, men illustrious for=
 talent, worth, and=20

knowledge, are ardently engaged in enlarging the boundaries of natural scie=
nce; and the history of=20

their labours and discoveries is communicated to the world chiefly through =
the medium of=20

Scientific Journals. The utility of such Journals has thus become generally=
 evident; they are the=20

heralds of science; they proclaim its toils and its achievements; they demo=
nstrate its intimate=20

connexion as well with the comfort, as with the intellectual and moral impr=
ovement of our species;=20

and they often procure for it enviable honours and substantial rewards.  In=
 England the interests of=20

science have been, for a series of years, greatly promoted by the excellent=
 Journals of=20

In 1742, it was enacted that Prince William County be divided. The bounds o=
f this county were set=20

as follows: "all that part thereof lying on the south side of Occoquan and =
Bull Run and from the=20

heads of the main branch of Bull Run by a straight course to the Thoroughfa=
re of the Blue Ridge of=20

Mountains known by the name of Ashby's Gap or Bent." Hamilton was the paris=
h for Prince=20

William County. That portion of Prince William which had, in 1732, been pla=
ced in Truro Parish=20

became the new county of Fairfax. The name was, of course, in honor of Lord=
 Fairfax, the=20

Proprietor of the Northern Neck Grant.  Pohick, Nicholson; and for the loss=
 of the latter, the=20

scientific world has been fully compensated by Dr. Thomson's Annals of Phil=
osophy, and by the=20

Journal of Science and the Arts, both published in London.  In France, the =
Annales de Chimie et=20

de Physique, the Journal des Mines, the Journal de Physique, &c. have long =
enjoyed a high and=20

deserved reputation. Indeed, there are few countries in Europe which do not=
 produce some similar=20

publication; not to mention the transactions of learned societies and numer=
ous medical Journals.=20

From these sources _our_ country reaps, and will long continue to reap, an =
abundant=20
