AMBASSADORS FROM POPE GREGORY ARRIVE AT PARIS, WITH BULLS         FROM THE=
=20

POPE TO THE KING AND UNIVERSITY OF PARIS.   Ambassadors arrived at Paris br=
inging bulls=20

from pope Gregory[105] to the king and the university, expressing that the =
pope was very ready=20

and willing to make any concessions the king and university should think ex=
pedient for the union of=20

the church, provided his rival Benedict would agree to similar terms. The a=
mbassadors and their=20

bulls were received with much joy,=E2=80=94and the contents of the latter w=
ere as follows:  =E2=80=98Gregory, a=20

bishop, and servant to the servants of God, sends health and his apostolica=
l benediction to his=20

children of the university. We are the more prepared to write to you, my be=
loved children, because=20

of the sorrowful concern which you have manifested on account of the schism=
 in the church,=20

which, through the mercy of the all-powerful God, has much affected you.  =
=E2=80=98Innocent VII. our=20

immediate predecessor, of enviable remembrance to this age, was taken from =
us on a Saturday,=20

the 6th of November. Our venerable brethren the cardinals of the holy roman=
 church, of whom I=20

was one, being by the grace of the Holy Spirit, summoned to a conclave, to =
elect a roman=20

pontiff,=E2=80=94after many things had been discussed, all eyes were direct=
ed to me, a cardinal priest of=20

the title of St Mark; and with unanimous consent, they elected me bishop of=
 Rome, which honour=20

we greatly feared, from a sense miles away, gives an indefinite number of r=
eproductions that=20

cannot possibly be mistaken by any one familiar with the voice before it ha=
d become =E2=80=9CEdisonized.=E2=80=9D=20

Some gramophone disks lately shown me from Germany registered greetings and=
 messages to=20

relatives in Washington, who were delighted to recognize the exact reproduc=
tion of familiar tones=20

and accents of the Fatherland.  So limitless is the field of research in th=
is direction that there is=20

scarcely an anthropological, biological, or medical discovery that may not =
sooner or later be=20

applied with profit in the investigations of personal identity where the co=
mbined efforts of an=20

attorney and an expert are required.  After the most rigid and scrutinizing=
 anatomical and material=20

examination is made and the closest inquisition entered on, it may often be=
 impossible to give a=20

reasonable explanation for the cause of the physical facts observed. The me=
dical man should=20

remember that his is the one great exception to the rule that rigidly exclu=
des opinions, and that=20

scientific men called as witnesses may not give their opinion as to the gen=
eral merits of the case,=20

but only as to the facts already proved. This qualifying rule being altoget=
her reversed in=20

investigations into personal identity, and the physician=E2=80=99s opinion =
as to identity being indispensable,=20

it becomes a matter of most serious import that this opinion should be grou=
nded upon absolute=20

and well-attested facts.     MEDICO-LEGAL DETERMINATION  OF  THE TIME OF DE=
ATH.  BY=20

H. P. LOOMIS, A.M., M.D.,  _Professor of Pathology=20


_
does marvellous works, that he would enable us to bear this burden,=E2=80=
=94and we trusted not in=20

ourself, but in the virtue of God, by whom we were convinced the thing had =
been done.  =E2=80=98This=20

pastoral office has not fallen to us for our profit, but for the glory of G=
od and the public benefit,=E2=80=94to=20

both of which we turn our thoughts and courage, in order that this poisonou=
s schism, in which the=20

Christian people have been so long bewildered may be destroyed. If, as we h=
ope, so great a grace=20

may be shewn to us to bring this about, we trust it may be shortly accompli=
shed.  =E2=80=98In order,=20

therefore, to obviate, as much as in us lies, all obstruction on our part t=
o the much-desired union of=20

the church, Visiting Physician and Curator to Bellevue Hospital, New York; =
Pathologist to the=20

Board of Health, New York City; President New York Pathological Society, et=
c., etc._     MEDICO-

LEGAL DETERMINATION OF THE TIME OF DEATH.   SIGNS OF DEATH.  THE cessation =
of=20

respiration and the absence of audible heart-beats are signs generally rega=
rded as sufficient in=20

themselves to determine the reality of death. But persons have been resusci=
tated from a state of=20

asphyxia or have recovered from a state of catalepsy or lethargy in whom, _=
to all appearances_,=20

the respiratory and circulatory processes have been arrested.  So it is adv=
isable that we should be=20

acquainted with some absolute tests of death=20


_
our claim to the papacy, provided our adversary, or his successor, whoever =
he be, shall engage=20

solemnly to make a similar renunciation; that is to say, that he renounce, =
fully and clearly, all claim=20

to the papacy, and that all those whom he may have created cardinals do uni=
te with those of our=20

college, so that a canonical election of a roman pontiff may ensue.  =E2=80=
=98We offer, beside, any other=20

reasonable concessions, so that this schism may be put an end to; and that =
what we say may be=20

depended on, we have sworn and promised the above at the time of our electi=
on to the popedom,=20

in conjunction with our venerable brethren the cardinals of the same church=
.  =E2=80=98In case that either of=20

us be re-chosen respiration.  It is well known that these important functio=
ns, although apparently=20

held in abeyance, must be speedily re-established so as to be recognized, o=
r death will rapidly=20

follow. This condition of apparently suspended animation is seen among hibe=
rnating animals; the=20

bear, for instance, will remain for four or five months without food or dri=
nk in a state of=20

lethargy=E2=80=94the heart-action and respiration hardly appreciable. Yet i=
t will be sufficiently rapid to=20

sustain life during the slow metabolic processes. A number of well-authenti=
cated cases are=20

reported in which persons could slacken their heart-action, so that no move=
ment of the organ=20

could be appreciated. The case of Colonel=20


_
to send properly instructed commissioners to Constance, who shall both priv=
ately and publicly=20

labour to bring about this desired union of the church.  =E2=80=98Do you, t=
herefore, my beloved children,=20

have the goodness to exert all your strength to aid us in the accomplishmen=
t of this business, that=20

the church may not longer labour under this disorder; and let affection aid=
 solicitude.=E2=80=94Given at St=20

Peter=E2=80=99s, at Rome, the 11th day of December, in the year 1406.=E2=80=
=99  When the ambassadors had fully=20

remonstrated on the matter of their coming, and made the same offers contai=
ned in the bull of the=20

renunciation of the popedom by Gregory, and had been well entertained at Pa=
ris, having received=20

promises of messengers being sent to pope Benedict, they returned to their =
lord and master.=20

About the ensuing Candlemas, the king of France and the university of Paris=
, in consequence of=20

the deliberations of the prelates, clergy and council, sent certain ambassa=
dors to pope=20

Benedict,=E2=80=94namely, the patriarch of Alexandria, who was then at Pari=
s, the bishops of Cambray=20

and Beauvais, the abbots of Saint Denis and of Mont St Michel, the lord de =
Courrouille, master=20

John Toussain, secretary to the king, and other doctors of the university, =
with many very=20

respectable persons. They took the road to Marseilles, where Benedict, and =
some of the cardinals=20

of his party, then resided.  These ambassadors were charged to remonstrate =
with him, in an=20

amicable manner, on the offer which his rival had made to renounce the papa=
cy, in order to=20

effectuate an union of the church. In case he should not be apparently dyin=
g, by slowing his heart=20

so that there was no pulse or heart-action discernible. The longest period =
he could remain in this=20

inanimate state was half an hour.  Instances have occurred in the new-born =
child where without=20

question there have been no heart-beats or respiratory movements for a numb=
er of minutes, the=20

limit being set at five.  These are exceptional cases, and it is setting at=
 defiance all physiological=20

experience to suppose that the heart-action and respiration can be suspende=
d entirely when once=20

they are established, for a period as long. So, then, if no motion of the h=
eart occurs during a period=20

of five minutes=E2=80=94a period five times as great as observation warrant=
s=E2=80=94death may be regarded as=20

certain.  The respiratory movements of the chest are sometimes very difficu=
lt to observe. They can=20

always be better appreciated if the abdomen and chest are observed together=
. There are two=20

methods to determine whether respiration is absolutely suspended or not. Fi=
rst, by holding a mirror=20

in front of the open mouth, observing whether any moisture collects on its =
surface. Second, by=20

placing on the chest a looking-glass or basin of water, and reflecting from=
 it an image by artificial=20

or sun light. The slightest movement would be registered by a change in pos=
ition of the image.=20

While the writer considers the absence of heart-beats and of respiratory mo=
vement an absolute=20

test of death, still some cases may occur in which the establishment of thi=
s test is very difficult,=20

and the following additional tests may be employed:  1. Temperature of the=

y other countries of=20

Christendom, would withdraw themselves from him, and no longer obey his bul=
ls or apostolical=20

mandates. In like manner would they act toward his adversary, were he to re=
fuse compliance with=20

the offers made by his ambassadors to the king of France and the university=
 of Paris.  The=20

ambassadors were graciously received by pope Benedict, on  2. Intermittent =
shocks of electricity=20

tever of irritability.  3.=20

owing that rigor mortis is=20

found in several parts.  4. A bright needle plunged into the body of the bi=
