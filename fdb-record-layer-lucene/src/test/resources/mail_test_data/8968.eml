He replied, Grant me respite until the day when they (_that is, mankind_) s=
hall be raised from the=20

dead. He said, Thou shalt be of those [who are] respited: _and, in another =
verse_ [in xv. 38, it is=20

said], _until the day of the known period; that is, until the period of the=
 first blast_ [of the trumpet].=20

[And the devil] said, Now, as Thou hast led me into error, I will surely la=
y wait for them (_that is, for=20

the sons of Adam_) in Thy right way, _the way that leadeth to Thee_: then I=
 will surely come upon=20

them, from before them, and from behind them, and from their right hands, a=
nd from their left,=20

_and hinder them from pursuing the way_ (_but, saith Ibn-'Abbas, he cannot =
come upon them=20

above, lest he should intervene between the servant and God's mercy_), and =
Thou shalt not find=20

the greater number of them grateful, _or believing_. [God] said, Go forth f=
rom it, despised and=20

driven away _from mercy_. Whosoever of them (_that is, of mankind_) shall f=
ollow thee, I will=20

surely fill hell with you all; _with thee, and thy offspring, and with men_=
.     (vii. 10-17.)   And we=20

said, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife (_Howwa_ [or Eve], _whom God created =
from a rib of his=20

left side_) in the garden, and eat ye therefrom plentifully, wherever ye wi=
ll; but approach ye not this=20

tree, _to eat thereof_; (_and it was wheat, or the grape-vine, or some othe=
r tree_;) for _if ye do=20

so_, ye will be of _the number of_ the offenders. But the devil, _Iblees_, =
caused them to slip from=20

it, _that is, from the garden, by his saying unto them, Shall I show you th=
e way to the tree of=20

eternity? And he swore to them by God that he was one of the faithful advis=
ers to them: so they=20

ate of it_, and He ejected them from that _state of delight_ in which they =
were. And We said,=20

Descend ye[193] _to the earth, ye two with the offspring that ye comprise_ =
[yet unborn], one of=20

you (_that is, of your offspring_) an enemy to another; and there shall be =
for you, in the earth, a=20

place of abode, and a provision, _of its vegetable produce_, for a time, _u=
ntil the period of the=20

expiration of your terms of life_. And Adam learned, from his Lord, words, =
_which were these_:--

_O Lord, we have acted unjustly to our own souls, and if Thou do not forgiv=
e us, and be merciful=20

unto us, we shall surely be of those who suffer loss_.[194] _And he prayed =
in these words_; and=20

He became propitious towards him, _accepting his repentance_; for He is the=
 Very Propitious, the=20

Merciful. We said, Descend ye from it (_from the garden_) altogether; and i=
f there come unto you=20

from Me a direction (_a book and an apostle_), those who follow my directio=
n, _there shall come_=20

no fear on them, nor shall they grieve _in the world to come; for they shal=
l enter paradise_: but=20

they who disbelieve and accuse our signs[195] of falsehood, these shall be =
the companions of the=20

fire: they shall remain therein for ever.     (ii. his goods, and banishmen=
t. The husband had to=20

secure to his wife a certain proportion of, if not all, her dowry, and in t=
he book of the customs of=20

Anjou we find it definitely stated that: _Il est usage que gentil home puit=
 doer sa fame a porte de=20

mostier dou tierz de sa terre_ (It is the custom for a gentleman to endow h=
is wife with the third of=20

his goods at the church door). Then, to protect widows from oppressive feud=
al reliefs, as they=20

were called, the _Etablissements de Saint Louis_ ordain that "no lady shall=
 pay a redemption fee=20

(to secure succession to the fief), except in case she marry. But if she ma=
rry, her husband shall=20

pay the fee to the seigneur whose vassal she is. And if what is offered doe=
s not please the=20

seigneur, he can claim but the revenues of the fief for one year."  Once ad=
mitted to the recognized=20

class of the nobility, either as a wife or as one of the greater vassals, a=
 woman's position was=20

decidedly improved. Her rights were not many, but yet the feudal chatelaine=
 occupied a position of=20

some dignity and importance. She was regarded as in some sort the represent=
ative of her=20

husband during his presence as well as during his absence. The _Assises de =
Jerusalem_ provide,=20



among other things, that she shall not be proceeded against in court as the=
 representative of her=20

husband until a respite of a year and a day has elapsed, to allow for his p=
ossible return; and in the=20

chateau, at all times the lady had charge of domestic affairs, and on state=
 occasions shared the=20

dignity of her husband.  The feudal chateau of a great baron was not only a=
 fortress to secure him=20

against his enemies; it was also a home for his family and for scores of de=
pendents and retainers,=20

and frequently a hostelry for the entertainment of travellers of high and l=
ow degree. The moat, the=20

drawbridge and portcullis, the strong walls pierced with narrow slits to ad=
mit scant light and air in=20

time of peace and to deliver arrows in time of war, the battlements, and th=
e lofty tower of strength,=20

all these are familiar in our conceptions of the feudal castle. Many of us =
have followed Marmion in=20

his mad dash under the descending portcullis and across the drawbridge of L=
ord Angus's castle;=20

and we have watched the arrows flying against the walls of Front de Boeuf's=
 donjon and old mad=20

Ursula raving on its battlements. But the other features of the dwellings, =
though sometimes=20

described with equal care by the great Sir Walter and his disciples, attrac=
t less attention and fade=20

sooner from our memories. Such a manor hall as that of Cedric the Saxon sho=
uld be kept in mind=20

if we wish to get a fair idea of the actual life of the better classes, not=
 only in England but in=20

France, for the main features of the architecture and of the furnishings we=
re the same. The nature=20

and extent of the fortifications might vary greatly, according to the power=
 or ambition of the owner;=20

but=20


_
_ABEL AND CAIN._   Recite, _O Mohammad_, unto them (_that is, to thy people=
_) the history of=20

the two sons of Adam, _namely, Abel and Cain_,[196] with truth. When they o=
ffered [their] offering=20

_to God_[197] (_Abel's being a ram, and Cain's being produce of the earth_)=
, and it was accepted=20

from one of them (_that is, from Abel; for fire descended from heaven, and =
devoured his=20

offering_), and it was not accepted from the other, _Cain was enraged; but =
he concealed his envy=20

until Adam performed a pilgrimage, when_ he said _unto his brother_, I will=
 assuredly slay thee.=20

_Abel said, Wherefore? Cain answered, Because of the acceptance of thine of=
fering to the=20

exclusion of mine. Abel_ replied, God only accepteth from the pious. If tho=
u home would be=20

substantially the same in all.  The main portion of the house was given up =
to a huge hall. Entering=20

the gateway of the outer wall, one found one's self in a court, around whic=
h were ranged the great=20

hall, the smaller sleeping apartments, the domestic offices, and the stable=
s. Every possible=20

provision was made for men and animals to live within the enclosure in case=
 of siege. The great=20

hall itself was usually at least thirty or forty feet in length, and often =
so wide that its high, vaulted=20

roof had to be supported on a row of columns extending down the middle. In =
the ceiling was a=20

hole, or _louvre_, to allow the smoke to escape when fire was lighted on th=
e hearth in the centre of=20

the floor for chimneys were used as yet,=20


_
me, I will not stretch forth to thee my hand to slay thee; for I fear God, =
the Lord of the worlds. I=20

desire that thou shouldst bear the sin [which thou intendest to commit] aga=
inst me, _by slaying=20

me_, and thy sin _which thou hast committed before_, and thou wilt be of th=
e companions of the=20

fire.--And that is the all, only in the smaller rooms. At one end of the ha=
ll there was probably a=20

slightly elevated dais, or platform, on which were the seats for the lord a=
nd lady, and perhaps for=20

distinguished guests. In the tall ogival windows, which were glazed only in=
 the houses of the very=20

wealthy, were window seats, and along the=20
