Despite the fact that southern Methodists and Presbyterians generally cease=
d to have much anti-

slavery ardor, there continued still in the western slave States and in the=
 mountains of Virginia and=20

North Carolina, a goodly number of these churchmen, who suffered no diminut=
ion of interest in the=20

enlightenment of Negroes. In the States of Kentucky and Tennessee friends o=
f the race were often=20

left free to instruct them as they wished. Many of the people who settled t=
hose States came from=20

the Scotch-Irish stock of the Appalachian Mountains, where early in the nin=
eteenth century the=20

blacks were in some cases treated as equals of the whites.[1]  [Footnote 2:=

of the American Antislavery Society_, New York, 1837, P. 31; _The New Engla=
nd Antislavery=20

Almanac_, 1841, p. 31; and _The African Repository_, vol. xxxii., p. 16.]  =
The Quakers, and many=20

Catholics, however, were as effective as the mountaineers in elevating Negr=
oes. They had for=20

centuries labored to promote religion and education among their colored bre=
thren. So earnest=20

were these sects in working for the uplift of the Negro race that the react=
ionary movement failed to=20

swerve them from their course. When the other churches adopted the policy o=
f mere verbal=20

training, the Quakers and Catholics adhered to their idea that the Negroes =
should be educated to=20

grasp the meaning of the Christian religion just as they had been during th=
e seventeenth and=20

eighteenth centuries.[1] This favorable situation did not mean so much, how=
ever, since with the=20

exception of the Catholics in Maryland and Louisiana and the Quakers in Pen=
nsylvania, not many=20

members of these sects lived in communities of a large colored population. =
Furthermore, they=20

were denied access to the Negroes in most southern communities,   Mixing to=

that I helplessly stand,   While=20

tremulous lights into shadows flit,   With a piece of Heaven held in my han=

cannot enter it!    At last--O my wonderful dear at last!   Thou always com=
est, howe'er it is--   The=20

senseless signs into symmetry pass'd,   For a few short seconds it _must_ b=
e bliss!    And so=20

standing there in the twilight's fall   (What happen'd is nothing but what =
must be)   I read the first=20

words that ever at all   My Harry (God bless him!) has written me.   HARRY'=
S LETTER.    'O Child,=20

when my words your sweet youth beguil'd   I _meant_ to make you the happies=
t child!   I _meant_=20

that no earthly life should be known   As bless'd as the life I had made my=
 own;   My weakness=20

and follies I had forgot--   But you _were_ happy with me, were you not?   =
I am not worthy my Love=20

Caress'd by a hand that is stain'd with blood.   Your innocent face shall n=

 But, my darling, it shall=20

 I shall sail for another=20

hemisphere,   Leaving behind me my anguish and fear;   Leaving behind me my=
 joy and my grace,=20

I shall soon pass over limitless space.    'Could I _but_ have seen you but=
 once again!   It is hard=20

to suffer and not complain!   'Tis my sin against _you_ I most repent   (I =
_did_ make you happy?=20
