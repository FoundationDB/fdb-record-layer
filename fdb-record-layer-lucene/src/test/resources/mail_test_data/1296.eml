With a fleeting sense of God!     THE SEEKER    THE creeds he wrought of dream and thought 

Fall from him at the touch of life,     His old gods fail him in the strife--   Withdrawn, the heavens he 

sought!    Vanished, the miracles that led,     The cloud at noon, the flame at night;   The vision that 

he wing'd and sped     Falls backward, baffled, from the height;    Yet in the wreck of these he 

stands     Upheld by something grim and strong;     Some stubborn instinct lifts a song   And 

nerves him, heart and hands:    He does not dare to call it hope;--     It is not aught that seeks 

reward--    Nor faith, that up some sunward slope     Runs aureoled to meet its lord;    It touches 



something elder far     Than faith or creed or thought in man,     It was ere yet these lived and ran 

Like light from star to star;    It touches that stark, primal need     That from unpeopled voids and 

vast   Fashioned the first crude, childish creed,--     And still shall fashion, till the last!    For one 

word is the tale of men:     They fling their icons to the sod,     And having trampled down a god 

They seek a god again!    Stripped of his creeds inherited,     Bereft of all his sires held true,   Amid 

the wreck of visions dead     He thrills at touch of visions new....    He wings another Dream for 

flight....     He seeks beyond the outmost dawn     A god he set there ... and, anon,   Drags that god 

from the height!    .     .     .     .     .     .    But aye from ruined faiths and old     That droop and die, 

fall bruised seeds;   And when new flowers and faiths unfold     They're lovelier flowers, they're 

kindlier creeds.     THE AWAKENING    THE steam, the reek, the fume, of prayer     Blown 

outward for a million years,     Becomes a mist between the spheres,   And waking Sentience 

struggles there.    Prayer still creates the boon we pray;     And gods we've hoped for, from those 

hopes   Will gain sufficient form one day     And in full godhood storm the slopes   Where ancient 

Chaos, stark and gray,   Already trembles for his sway.    When that the restless worlds would fly 

Their wish created rapid wings,   But not till aeons had passed by     With dower of many idler 

things;   And when dumb flesh demanded speech     Speech struggled to the lips at last;--     Now 

the unpeopled Void, and vast,    Clean to that uttermost blank beach   Whereto the boldest thought 

may reach     That voyages from the vaguest past--     (Dim realm and ultimate of space)--   Is 

vexed and troubled, stirs and shakes,   In prescience of a god that wakes,     Born of man's wish to 

see God's face!    The endless, groping, dumb desires,--     The climbing incense thick and sweet, 

The lovely purpose that aspires,     The wraiths of vapor wing'd and fleet     That rise and run with 

eager feet   Forth from a myriad altar fires:     All these become a mist that fills   The vales and 

chasms nebular;     A shaping Soul that moves and thrills   The wastes between red star and star!

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats

all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to    Stained of the struggle and toil,   Stained of 

the soil,    Ally of God in the end--   Helper and friend--    Hero and prophet and priest   Out of the 

beast!     THE NOBLER LESSON    CHRIST was of virgin birth, and, being slain,   The creedists 

say, He rose from death again.   Oh, futile age-long talk of death and birth!--   His life, that is the 

one thing wonder-worth;   Not how He came, but how He lived on earth.   For if gods stoop, and 

with quaint jugglery   Mock nature's laws, how shall that profit thee?--   The nobler lesson
