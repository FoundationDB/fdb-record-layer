they have vigorous fists in case there is an attack on the wench while she walks across to the Rat 

Mort."  "It would be simpler," here interposed Louise roughly, "if we were to knock the wench on 

the head and then let the lads carry her across."  "It would not be simpler," retorted Chauvelin 

drily, "for Carrier might at any moment turn against us. Commandant Fleury with half a company of 

Marats will be posted round the Rat Mort, remember. They may interfere with the lads and arrest 

them and snatch the wench from us, when all our plans may fall to the ground ... one never knows 

what double game Carrier may be playing. No! no! the girl must not be dragged or carried to the 

Rat Mort. She must walk into the trap of her own free will."  "But name of a dog! how is it to be 

done?" ejaculated Martin-Roget, and he brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table. 

"The woman will not follow me--or Louise either--anywhere willingly."  "She must follow a stranger 

then--or one whom she thinks a stranger--some one who will have gained her confidence...." 

"Impossible."  "Oh! nothing is impossible, citizen," rejoined Chauvelin blandly.  "Do you know 

which came to nothing.  "Slowfoot need not guess; she _knows_," said the woman with an air of 

great mystery.  "What does Slowfoot know?"  The woman's answer to this was a look of exceeding 

slyness.  But this did not content her lord, who, after repeated questions, and a threat to resort to 

extreme measures in case of continued refusal, drew from her a distinct answer.  "Slowfoot knows 

that Cloudbrow _killed_ Perrin."  "Sh!" exclaimed La Certe, with a look of real concern, "I am not 

yet tired of you, Slowfoot; and if old McKay hears you say that he will shoot you."  "Slowfoot is not 

a fool," retorted the woman: "the old man will never hear her say that.  What has Slowfoot got to 

do with it?  She can hold her tongue!"  "She can do that, for certain," returned her husband with 

good-natured sarcasm.  "In that, as in many things, she excels other women.  I would never have 

married her had it not been so.  But how do you come to be so sure?"  "I know the knife," returned 

the woman, becoming more literal as she went on, "and Marie Blanc knows it.  Her husband once 

got the loan of it from Cloudbrow, and she looked at it with care, because she had 


_
"I think I do. If you will trust me that is----"  "I don't know that I do. Your mind is so intent on those 

English adventurers, you are like as not to let the aristos slip through your fingers."  "Well, citizen," 

retorted Chauvelin imperturbably, "will you take the risk of conveying the fair Yvonne to the Rat 

Mort by twelve o'clock to-night? I have very many things to see to, I confess that I should be glad if 

you will ease me from that responsibility."  "I have already told you that I see no way," retorted 

Martin-Roget with a snarl.  "Then why not let me act?"  "What are you going to do?"  "For the 

moment I am going for a walk on the quay and once more will commune with the North-West 

wind."  "Tshaw!" ejaculated Martin-Roget savagely.  "Nay, citizen," resumed Chauvelin blandly, 

"the winds of heaven are excellent counsellors. I told you so just now and you agreed with me. 

They blow away the cobwebs of the mind and clear the brain for serious thinking. You want the 

Kernogan girl to be arrested inside the Rat Mort and you see no way of conveying her thither save 

by the use of violence, which for obvious reasons is to be deprecated: Carrier, for equally obvious 

reasons, will not have her taken to the place by force. On the other hand you admit that the wench 

would not follow you willingly----Well, citizen, we must find a way out of that impasse, for it is too 

unimportant an one to stand in the way of our plans: for this I must hold a consultation with the 

North-West wind."  "I won't allow you to do anything without consulting me."  "Am I likely to do 

that? To begin with I shall have need of your co-operation and that of the citizeness."  "In that case 

..." muttered Martin-Roget grudgingly. "But remember," he added with a return to his usual self-

assured manner, "remember that Yvonne and her father belong to me and not to you. I brought 

them into Nantes for mine own purposes--not for yours. I will not have my revenge jeopardised so 

that your schemes may be furthered."  "Who spoke of my schemes, citizen Martin-Roget?" broke 

in Chauvelin with perfect urbanity. "Surely not I? What am I but an humble tool in the service of the 

Republic?... a tool that has proved useless--a failure, what? My only desire is to help you to the 

best of my abilities. Your enemies are the enemies of the Republic: my ambition is to help you in 

destroying them."  For a moment longer Martin-Roget hesitated: he abominated this suggestion of 

becoming a mere instrument in the hands of this man whom he still would have affected to 

despise--had he dared. But here came the difficulty: he no longer dared to despise Chauvelin. He 

felt the strength of the man--the clearness of his intellect, and though he--Martin-Roget--still chose 

to disregard every warning in connexion with the English spies, he could not wholly divest his mind 

from the possibility of their presence in Nantes. Carrier's scheme was so magnificent, so 

satisfying, that the ex-miller's son was ready to humble his pride and set his arrogance aside in 

order to see it carried through successfully.  So after a moment or two, despite the fact that he 

positively ached to shut Chauvelin out of the whole business, Martin-Roget gave a grudging 

assent to his proposal.  "Very well!" he said, "you see to it. So long as it does not interfere with my 

plans...."  "It can but help them," rejoined Chauvelin suavely. "If you will act as I shall direct I 

pledge you my word that the wench will walk to the Rat Mort of her free will and at the hour when 

you want her. What else is there to say?"  "When and where shall we meet again?"  "Within the 

hour I will return here and explain to you and to the citizeness what I want you to do. We will get 

the aristos inside the Rat Mort, never fear; and after that I think that we may safely leave Carrier to 

do the rest, what?"  He picked up his hat and wrapped his mantle round him. He took no further 

heed of Martin-Roget or of Louise, for suddenly he had felt the crackling of crisp paper inside the 

breast-pocket of his coat and in a moment the spirit of the man had gone a-roaming out of the 



narrow confines of this squalid abode. It had seen such a knife before.  She knew all its marks. 

Why does Cloudbrow deny that it is his?  Because it was Cloudbrow who killed Perrin.  If it had 

been anybody else he would have known it, and he would have said so--for he was _there_." 

"How know you that he was there?"  "Marie Blanc knows.  She netted the snowshoes that 

Cloudbrow wore, and she saw the footprints."  "But pairs of snowshoes are very like each other," 

objected La Certe.  "Very like.  Yes; but did ever two shoes have the same mends in the same 

places of the netting, where it had been broken, and the same marks on the frames?"  "Never.  It 

will go hard with Cloudbrow if this is true."  "It will go hard with him whether it is true or not," 

returned the woman; "for some of the friends of Perrin believe it to be true, and swear--"  The 

disappearance of Slowfoot's float at this moment stopped her swearing, and brought the 

conversation to an abrupt end.  The landing of another goldeye prevented its resumption.  Having 

caught more than enough for a good supper, this easy-going pair leaned their rods against a tree, 

and ascended the bank towards their tent, which was an ordinary conical Indian wigwam, 

composed partly of leather and partly of birch-bark, with a curtain for a door and a hole in the top 

for a window; it also served for a chimney.  On the way they encountered one of the poor Swiss 

immigrants, who, having a wife and family, and having been unsuccessful in buffalo-hunting, and 

indeed in all other hunting, was in a state which bordered on starvation.  "You have been lucky," 

said the Switzer, eyeing La Certe's fish greedily.  "Sometimes luck comes to us--not often," 

answered the half-breed.  "Have you caught any?"  "Yes, two small ones.  Here they are.  But 

what are these among three children and a wife?  I know not how to fish," said the mountaineer 

disconsolately.  The fact was not surprising, for the poor man was a watchmaker by trade, and had 

never handled rod or gun till he was, as it were, cast adrift in Rupert's Land.  "I will sell you some 

of my fish," said La Certe, who on all occasions had a keen eye for a bargain.  "Good!  I am ready 

to buy," said the poor fellow, "but I have not much to spend.  Only last week I gave my silver watch 

for eight gallons of wheat.  I meant it for seed, but my wife and children were starving, so we were 

have no seed and only five shillings to spare."  "Well, my friend," said La Certe, "fish is very scarce 

just now, but you may have five goldeyes for your five shillings."  "O! that is too much," 

remonstrated the Switzer.  "No, no," interrupted the half-breed, amiably, "by no means--but if you 

really think it too much fish for the money I will give you four goldeyes!"  "Come, you know I don't 

mean that," returned the other, with a cynical smile.  "Make it six, and I will agree.  And here is a 

pinch of snuff in to the bargain."  He pulled out a box as he spoke, and opened it.  "Ha!" said La 

Certe, helping himself.  "I love snuff, and so does my wife.  Do you not?"  Slowfoot answered, 

"Hee! hee!" and helped herself to as much as a good broad finger and thumb could grasp, after 

which she sneezed with violence.  "Now, behold! my friend--a-wheesht!" said La Certe, sneezing a 

bass accompaniment to Slowfoot's treble.  "I will give you a catfish--a whole catfish for--a-

wheesht!--for that box and snuff."  The Switzer shook his head.  "Nay," he said.  "The snuff you 

may have, but the box was the gift of a friend, and I am loath to part with it.  Besides, the box is of 

little real value."  "You may have the head of the catfish for the snuff, and the whole catfish for the 

box," said La Certe, with the firmness of a man who has irrevocably made up his mind--for there 

are none so firm of purpose as the weak and vacillating when they know they have got the whip-

hand of any one!  "And, behold!  I will be liberal," he added.  "You shall have another goldeye into 

the bargain--six goldeyes for the five shillings and a whole catfish for the box and snuff--voila!" 



The poor Switzer still hesitated.  "It is a great deal to give for so little," he said.  "That may be true," 

said the other, "but I

wandered once more into a brilliantly-lighted ball-room where an exquisitely dressed dandy 

declaimed inanities and doggrel rhymes for the delectation of a flippant assembly: it heard once 

more the lazy, drawling speech, the inane, affected laugh, it caught the glance of a pair of lazy, 

grey eyes fixed mockingly upon him. Chauvelin's thin claw-like hand went back to his pocket: it felt 

that packet of papers, it closed over it like a vulture's talon does upon a prey. He no longer heard 

Martin-Roget's obstinate murmurings, he no longer felt himself to be the disgraced, humiliated 

servant of the State: starve for the satisfaction of carrying a snuff-box and five shillings in my 

pocket."  This politic reference to the starving family decided the matter; the poor Switzer emptied 

his pockets with a sigh, received the fish, and went on his way, leaving La Certe and Slowfoot to 

return to their wigwam highly pleased with their bargain.  As must have been noted by the reader 

long ere now, this like-minded couple did not possess a conscience between them--at least, if they 

did, it must at that time have been a singularly shrunken and mummified one, which they had 

managed to keep hidden away in some dark and

once more the master, the leader, the successful weaver of an hundred clever intrigues. The 

enemy who had baffled him so often had chosen once more to throw down the glove of mocking 

defiance. So be it! The battle would be fought this night--a decisive one--and long live the Republic 

and the power of the people!  With a curt nod of the head Chauvelin turned on his heel and without 

waiting for Martin-Roget to follow him, or for Louise to light him on his way, he strode from the 

room, and out of the house, and had soon disappeared in the darkness in the direction of the 

quay. chamber of the soul.  Commercially speaking, however, they had some ground for 

satisfaction; for at that time the ordinary price of a catfish, which is a little larger than a haddock, 

was threepence.  Awakening the juvenile La Certe to the blissful realisation that a good "square" 

meal was pending, Slowfoot ordered it to fill and light the pipe for the father, while she set about 

preparing the fish for supper.    CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.  VISIT FROM SIOUX BROUGHT 

TO A DISASTROUS CLOSE.  Happening to hear of the bargain which we have just described,
