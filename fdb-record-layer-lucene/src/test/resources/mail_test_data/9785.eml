and every abomination in the shape of points which render a leather suit indispensable to a 

sportsman, even in this hot climate. My knickerbockers are made of the coarse but strong Arab 

cotton cloth, that I have dyed brown with the fruit of the Acacia Arabica; but after a walk of a few 

minutes, I am one mass of horrible points from the spear grass, for about a foot from the upper 

part of my gaiters; the barbed points having penetrated, break off, and my trousers are as 

comfortable as a hedgehog's skin turned inside out, with the 'woolly side in.'  "I long for the time

"October 17.--The sheik and several Arabs went to the Settite to sow tobacco; they simply cast the 

seed upon the sandy loam left by the receding river, without even scratching the soil; it is thus left 

to take its chance. I accompanied him to the Settite, and came upon the tracks of a herd of about 

fifty elephants that had crossed the river a few days previous. As we were walking through the 

high grass we came upon a fine boa-constrictor (python), and not wishing to fire, as I thought I 

might disturb elephants in the neighbourhood, I made a cut at it with my heavy hunting-knife, 

nearly severing about four feet from the tail, but it escaped in the high grass.  "October 18.--A lion 

paid us a visit last night, roaring close to the tent at intervals, frightening Mahomet out of his wits. 

"The seroot fly has entirely disappeared, and immense dragon flies are now arrived, and are 

greedily attacking all other flying insects.  "October 19.--Troops of baboons are and help preserve

the country being entirely dried up, they are forced to the river for water, and the shady banks 

covered with berry-bearing shrubs induce them to remain. It is very amusing to watch these great 

male baboons stalking majestically along, followed by a large herd of all ages, the mothers 

carrying their little ones upon their backs, the latter with a regular jockey-seat riding most 

comfortably, while at other times they relieve the monotony of the position by keeping this work in 

the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without 

charge with others.  1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what 

you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.  If
