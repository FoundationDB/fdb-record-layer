'Lisson Grove;' where's Lisson Grove?" asked the weary stranger of the good=

hope that it's hard by, though I have not seen anything hereabouts like a g=

smiled at the observation. "You must not look for trees there," he said, "b=
ut a lot of low, dirty,=20

narrow streets; and, as for the distance from here, I should say at a guess=

miles!" repeated poor Ned to himself, as, after thanking his informant, he =
quitted the shop. "Tired=20

as I am, I'd rather walk forty miles on a country road than four miles thro=

Raoul came, and the first thing I did was to give him the diamonds.  "You a=

exclaimed. "Thank Heaven, I won't have to take your money now."  "All that'=

said.  "It is _you_ I want for mine," he answered. "When am I to have you? =
Don't keep me waiting=20

long, my darling. I'm nothing without you."  "I don't want to keep you wait=

indeed I longed to be his wife--his, in spite of Godensky; his, till death =

in his arms, and then, when I had promised to marry him as soon as a marria=
