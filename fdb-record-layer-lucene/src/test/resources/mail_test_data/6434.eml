Nor did Yvonne Dewhurst attempt to make reply to her enemy's delirious talk=
. She would not give=20

him even the paltry satisfaction of feeling that he had stung her into a re=
tort. She did not fear him--

she hated him too much for that--but like her father she had no illusions a=
s to his power over them=20

both. While he stormed and raved she kept her  "It will be very nice to hav=
e him settled so near us.=20

Do you think he will take the whole of it?"  "I think so.  You see, the ter=
ms on which the Earl has=20

granted the land are so easy, and the supplies of goods, oatmeal, clothing,=
 and farm implements=20

sent us so generous, that Andre finds he will have money enough to enable h=
im to start.  Then,=20

steadily fixed upon him. She could only just barely distinguish him in the =
gloom, and he no doubt=20

failed to see the expression of lofty indifference wherewith she contrived =
to regard him: but he=20

_felt_ her contempt, and but for the presence of the sailors on the deck he=
 probably would have=20

struck her.  As it was when, from sheer lack of breath, he had to pause, he=
 gave one last look of=20

hate on the huddled figure of the duc, and the proud, upstanding one of Yvo=
nne, then with a laugh=20

which Fred Jenkins, has actually agreed to serve as a man on the farm for a=
 whole year for=20

nothing, except, of course, his food and lodging.  Isn't it generous of him=
?"  "Do you know why he=20

is going to serve him for nothing?" asked Elspie, with a quick look and smi=
le.  "No--I do not,"=20

returned fair little Elise with an innocent look.  "Do you?"  "O no--of cou=
rse I don't; I can only=20

guess," replied her companion with a light laugh.  "Perhaps it is because h=
e knows his services as=20

a farm servant=20

fiend--so cruel, so callous was it, he turned on his heel, and as he strode=
 away towards the bow=20

his tall figure was soon absorbed in the surrounding gloom.   III  The duc =
de Kernogan and his=20

daughter saw little or nothing of Martin-Roget after that. For awhile longe=
r they caught sight of him=20

from time to time as he walked up and down the deck with ceaseless restless=
ness and in the=20

company of another man, who was much shorter and slimmer than himself and w=
hom they had=20

not noticed hitherto. Martin-Roget talked most of the time in a loud and ex=
cited voice, the other=20

appearing to listen to him with a certain air of deference. Whether the con=
versation between these=20

two was actually intended for the ears of the two unfortunates, or  "There =
you are wrong," returned=20

Elise, stoutly.  "No doubt he is ignorant, as yet, about sowing and reaping=
 and the like, but he is=20

wonderfully strong--just like a giant at lifting and carrying-and he has be=
come quite knowing about=20

horses, and carting, and such things.  All that he stipulates for is that h=
e shall board in our house.=20

He says he'll manage, somehow, to make enough money to buy all the clothes =
he wants."  "What=20

a delightful kind of servant," said Elspie, with an arch look, which was qu=
ite thrown away on Elise,=20

"and so disinterested to do it without any reason."  "O! but he must have s=
ome reason, you know,"=20

rejoined Elise.  "I shouldn't wonder if it was out of gratitude to my broth=
