efreshment-bar.  "Waiter," said Olga Ivanovna, laughing and crying with hap=
piness, "bring us some wine."  The artist, pale philodendron monstera fixed=
, while the other ten, not being tuned to the same pitch, are variable. The=
 fixed notes are those which, being placed between the moveable, make up th=
e unity of the tetrachord, and remain unaltered in their boundaries accordi=
ng to the different classes. Their names are proslambanomenos, hypate hypat=
on, hypate meson, mese, nete synhemmenon, bright with tears.  Then she look=

eard heavy footsteps; it was a waiter from the refreshment-bar.  "Waiter," =
said Olga Ivanovna, laughing and crying with happiness, "bring us some wine=
."  The artist, pale _
the height, they applied the same principle to the column, and reared the s=
haft, including the=20

capital, to a height six times its thickness at its base. Thus the Doric co=
lumn, as used in buildings,=20

began to exhibit the proportions, strength, and beauty of the body of a man=
.  7. Just so afterwards,=20

when they desired to construct a temple to Diana in a new style of beauty, =
they translated these=20

footprints into terms characteristic of the slenderness of women, and thus =
first made a column the=20

thickness of which was only one eighth of its height, so that it might have=
 a taller look. At the foot=20

they substituted the base in place of a shoe; in the capital they placed th=
e volutes, hanging down=20

at the right and left like curly ringlets, and ornamented its front with cy=
matia and with festoons of=20

fruit arranged in place of hair, while they brought the flutes down the who=
le shaft, falling like the=20

folds in the robes worn by matrons. Thus in the invention of the two differ=
ent kinds of columns,=20

they borrowed manly beauty, naked and unadorned, for the one, and for the o=
ther the delicacy,=20

adornment, and proportions characteristic of women.  8. It is true that pos=
terity, having made=20

progress in refinement and delicacy of feeling, and finding pleasure in mor=
e slender proportions,=20

has established seven diameters of the thickness as the height of the Doric=
 column, and nine as=20

that of the Ionic. The Ionians, however, originated the order which is ther=
efore named Ionic.  The=20

third order, called Corinthian, is an imitation of the slenderness of a mai=
den; for the outlines and=20

limbs of maidens, being more slender on account of their tender years, admi=
t of prettier effects in=20

the way of adornment.  9. It is related that the original discovery of this=
 form of capital was as=20

follows. A free-born maiden of Corinth, just of marriageable age, was attac=
ked by an illness and=20

passed away. After her burial, her nurse, collecting a few little things wh=
ich used to give the girl=20

pleasure while she was alive, put them in a basket, carried it to the tomb,=
 and laid it on top thereof,=20

covering it with a roof-tile so that the things might last longer in the op=
en air. This basket happened=20

to be placed just above the root of an acanthus. The acanthus root, pressed=
 down meanwhile=20

though it was by the weight, when springtime came round put forth leaves an=
d stalks in the middle,=20

and the stalks, growing up along the sides of the basket, and pressed out b=
y the corners of the tile=20

through the compulsion of its weight, were forced to bend into volutes at t=
he outer edges.=20

[Illustration: Photo. Sommer  THE BASILICA AT POMPEII]  [Illustration: THE =
CORINTHIAN=20

CAPITAL OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE MONUMENTS]  10. Just then Callimachu=
s,=20

whom the Athenians called [Greek: katatexitechnos] for the refinement and d=
elicacy of his artistic=20

work, passed by this tomb and observed the basket with the tender young lea=
ves growing round it.=20

Delighted with the novel style and form, he built some columns after that p=
attern for the=20

Corinthians, determined their symmetrical proportions, and established from=
 that time forth the=20

rules to be followed in finished works of the Corinthian order.  11. The pr=
oportions of this capital=20

should be fixed as follows. Let the height of the capital, including its ab=
acus, be equivalent to the=20

thickness of the base of a column. Let the breadth of the abacus be proport=
ioned so that diagonals=20

drawn from one corner of it to the other shall be twice the height of the c=
apitals, which will give the=20

proper breadth to each face of the abacus. The faces should curve inwards, =
by one ninth of the=20

breadth of the face, from the outside edge of the corners of the abacus. At=
 the bottom the capital=20

should be of the thickness of the top of the column omitting the conge and =
astragal. The height of=20

the abacus is one seventh of the height of the capital.  12. Omitting the h=
eight of the abacus, let=20

the rest be divided into three parts, of which one should be given to the l=
owest leaf. Let the second=20

leaf occupy the middle part of the height. Of the same height should be the=
 stalks, out of which=20



grow leaves projected so as to support the volutes which proceed from the s=
talks, and run out to=20

the utmost corners of the abacus; the smaller spirals between them should b=
e carved just under=20

the flower which is on the abacus. The flowers on the four sides are to be =
made as large as the=20

height of the abacus. On these principles of proportion, Corinthian capital=
s will be finished as they=20

ought to be.  There are other kinds of capitals set upon these same columns=
 and called by various=20

names, but they have no peculiarities of proportion of which we can speak, =
nor can we recognize=20

from them another order of columns. Even their very names are, as we can se=
e, derived with=20

some changes from the Corinthian, the cushion-shaped, and the Doric, whose =
symmetrical=20

proportions have been thus transferred to delicate sculptures of novel form=
.     CHAPTER II  THE=20

ORNAMENTS OF THE ORDERS   1. Since the origin and invention of the orders o=
f columns have=20

been described above, I think it not out of place to speak in the same way =
about their ornaments,=20

showing how these arose and from what original elements they were devised. =
The upper parts of=20

all buildings contain timber work to which various terms are applied. And n=
ot only in its terminology=20

but actually in its uses it exhibits variety. The main beams are those whic=
h are laid upon columns,=20

pilasters, and antae; tie-beams and rafters are found in the framing. Under=
 the roof, if the span is=20

pretty large, are the crossbeams and struts; if it is of moderate extent, o=
nly the ridgepole, with the=20

principal rafters extending to the outer edge of the eaves. Over the princi=
pal rafters are the=20

purlines, and then above these and under the roof-tiles come the common raf=
ters, extending so far=20

that the walls are covered by their projection.  2. Thus each and every det=
ail has a place, origin,=20

and order of its own. In accordance with these details, and starting from c=
arpenter's work, artists in=20

building temples of stone and marble imitated those arrangements in their s=
culptures, believing=20

that they must follow those inventions. So it was that some ancient carpent=
ers, engaged in=20

building somewhere or other, after laying the tie-beams so that they projec=
ted from the inside to=20

the outside of the walls, closed up the space between the beams, and above =
them ornamented=20

the coronae and gables with carpentry work of beauty greater than usual; th=
en they cut off the=20

projecting ends of the beams, bringing them into line and flush with the fa=
ce of the walls; next, as=20

this had an ugly look to them, they fastened boards, shaped as triglyphs ar=
e now made, on the=20

ends of the beams, where they had been cut off in front, and painted them w=
ith blue wax so that=20

the cutting off of the ends of the beams, being concealed, would not offend=
 the eye. Hence it was=20

in imitation of the arrangement of the tie-beams that men began to employ, =
in Doric buildings, the=20

device of triglyphs and the metopes between the beams.  3. Later, others in=
 other buildings=20

allowed the projecting principal rafters to run out till they were flush wi=
th the triglyphs, and then=20

formed their projections into simae. From that practice, like the triglyphs=
 from the arrangement of=20

the tie-beams, the system of mutules under the coronae was devised from the=
 projections of the=20

principal rafters. Hence generally, in buildings of stone and marble, the m=
utules are carved with a=20

downward slant, in imitation of the principal rafters. For these necessaril=
y have a slanting and=20

projecting position to let the water drip down. The scheme of triglyphs and=
 mutules in Doric=20

buildings was, therefore, the imitative device that I have described.  4. I=
t cannot be that the=20

triglyphs represent windows, as some have erroneously said, since the trigl=
yphs are placed at the=20

corners and over the middle of columns--places where, from the nature of th=
e case, there can be=20

no windows at all. For buildings are wholly disconnected at the corners if =
openings for windows=20

are left at those points. Again, if we are to suppose that there were open =
windows where the=20



triglyphs now stand, it will follow, on the same principle, that the dentil=
s of the Ionic order have=20

likewise taken the places of windows. For the term "metope" is used of the =
intervals between=20

dentils as well as of those between triglyphs. The Greeks call the seats of=
 tie-beams and rafters=20

[Greek: opai], while our people call these cavities columbaria (dovecotes).=
 Hence, the space=20

between the tie-beams, being the space between two "opae," was named by the=
m [Greek:=20

metope].  5. The system of triglyphs and mutules was invented for the Doric=
 order, and similarly=20

the scheme of dentils belongs to the Ionic, in which there are proper groun=
ds for its use in=20

buildings. Just as mutules represent the projection of the principal rafter=
s, so dentils in the Ionic=20

are an imitation of the projections of the common rafters. And so in Greek =
works nobody ever put=20

dentils under mutules, as it is impossible that common rafters should be un=
derneath principal=20

rafters. Therefore, if that which in the original must be placed above the =
principal rafters, is put in=20

the copy below them, the result will be a work constructed on false princip=
les. Neither did the=20

ancients approve of or employ mutules or dentils in pediments, but only pla=
in coronae, for the=20

reason that neither principal nor common rafters tail into the fronts of pe=
diments, nor can they=20

overhang them, but they are laid with a slope towards the eaves. Hence the =
ancients held that=20

what could not happen in the original would have no valid reason for existe=
nce in the copy.  6. For=20

in all their works they proceeded on definite principles of fitness and in =
ways derived from the truth=20

of Nature. Thus they reached perfection, approving only those things which,=
 if challenged, can be=20

explained on grounds of the truth. Hence, from the sources which have been =
described they=20

established and left us the rules of symmetry and proportion for each order=
. Following in their=20

steps, I have spoken above on the Ionic and Corinthian styles, and I shall =
now briefly explain the=20

theory of the Doric and its general appearance.     CHAPTER III  PROPORTION=
S OF DORIC=20

TEMPLES   1. Some of the ancient architects said that the Doric order ought=
 not to be used for=20

temples, because faults and incongruities were caused by the laws of its sy=
mmetry. Arcesius and=20

Pytheos said so, as well as Hermogenes. He, for instance, after getting tog=
ether a supply of=20

marble for the construction of a Doric temple, changed his mind and built a=
n Ionic temple to Father=20

Bacchus with the same materials. This is not because it is unlovely in appe=
arance or origin or=20

dignity of form, but because the arrangement of the triglyphs and metopes (=
lacunaria) is an=20

embarrassment and inconvenience to the work.  2. For the triglyphs ought to=
 be placed so as to=20

correspond to the centres of the columns, and the metopes between the trigl=
yphs ought to be as=20

broad as they are high. But in violation of this rule, at the corner column=
s triglyphs are placed at=20

the outside edges and not corresponding to the centre of the columns. Hence=
 the metopes next to=20

the corner columns do not come out perfectly square, but are too broad by h=
alf the width of a=20

triglyph. Those who would make the metopes all alike, make the outermost in=
tercolumniations=20

narrower by half the width of a triglyph. But the result is faulty, whether=
 it is attained by broader=20

metopes or narrower intercolumniations. For this reason, the ancients appea=
r to have avoided the=20

scheme of the Doric order in their temples.  3. However, since our plan cal=
ls for it, we set it forth as=20

we have received it from our teachers, so that if anybody cares to set to w=
ork with attention to=20

these laws, he may find the proportions stated by which he can construct co=
rrect and faultless=20

examples of temples in the Doric fashion.  Let the front of a Doric temple,=
 at the place where the=20

columns are put up, be divided, if it is to be tetrastyle, into twenty-seve=
n parts; if hexastyle, into=20

forty-two. One of these parts will be the module (in Greek [Greek: embates]=
); and this module=20



once fixed, all the parts of the work are adjusted by means of calculations=
 based upon it.  4. The=20

thickness of the columns will be two modules, and their height, including t=
he capitals, fourteen.=20

The height of a capital will be one module, and its breadth two and one six=
th modules. Let the=20

height of the capital be divided into three parts, of which one will form t=
he abacus with its=20

cymatium, the second the echinus with its annulets, and the third the necki=
ng. The diminution of=20

the column should be the same as described for Ionic columns in the third b=
ook. The height of the=20

architrave, including taenia and guttae, is one module, and of the taenia, =
one seventh of a module.=20

The guttae, extending as wide as the triglyphs and beneath the taenia, shou=
ld hang down for one=20

sixth of a module, including their regula. The depth of the architrave on i=
ts under side should=20

answer to the necking at the top of the column. Above the architrave, the t=
riglyphs and metopes=20

are to be placed: the triglyphs one and one half modules high, and one modu=
le wide in front. They=20

are to be arranged so that one is placed to correspond to the centre of eac=
h corner and=20

intermediate column, and two over each intercolumniation except the middle =
intercolumniations of=20

the front and rear porticoes, which have three each. The intervals in the m=
iddle being thus=20

extended, a free passage will be afforded to those who would approach the s=
tatues of the gods.=20

[Illustration: VITRUVIUS' DORIC ORDER COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE AT CORI AND =
THE=20

DORIC ORDER OF THE THEATRE OF MARCELLUS]  5. The width of the triglyph shou=
ld be=20

divided into six parts, and five of these marked off in the middle by means=
 of the rule, and two half=20

parts at the right and left. Let one part, that in the centre, form a "femu=
r" (in Greek [Greek: meros]).=20

On each side of it are the channels, to be cut in to fit the tip of a carpe=
nter's square, and in=20

succession the other femora, one at the right and the other at the left of =
a channel. To the outsides=20

are relegated the semichannels. The triglyphs having been thus arranged, le=
t the metopes=20

between the triglyphs be as high as they are wide, while at the outer corne=
rs there should be=20

semimetopes inserted, with the width of half a module.  In these ways all d=
efects will be corrected,=20

whether in metopes or intercolumniations or lacunaria, as all the arrangeme=
nts have been made=20

with uniformity.  6. The capitals of each triglyph are to measure one sixth=
 of a module. Over the=20

capitals of the triglyphs the corona is to be placed, with a projection of =
two thirds of a module, and=20

having a Doric cymatium at the bottom and another at the top. So the corona=
 with its cymatia is=20

half a module in height. Set off on the under side of the corona, verticall=
y over the triglyphs and=20

over the middle of the metopes, are the viae in straight lines and the gutt=
ae arranged in rows, six=20

guttae broad and three deep. The spaces left (due to the fact that the meto=
pes are broader than=20

the triglyphs) may be left unornamented or may have thunderbolts carved on =
them. Just at the=20

edge of the corona a line should be cut in, called the scotia. All the othe=
r parts, such as tympana=20

and the simae of the corona, are to be constructed as described above in th=
e case of the Ionic=20

order.  7. Such will be the scheme established for diastyle buildings. But =
if the building is to be=20

systyle and monotriglyphic, let the front of the temple, if tetrastyle, be =
divided into nineteen and a=20

half parts; if hexastyle, into twenty-nine and a half parts. One of these p=
arts will form the module in=20

accordance with which the adjustments are to be made as above described.  8=
. Thus, over each=20

portion of the architrave two metopes and two triglyphs[3] will be placed; =
and, in addition, at the=20

corners half a triglyph and besides a space large enough for a half triglyp=
h. At the centre, vertically=20

under the gable, there should be room for three triglyphs and three metopes=
, in order that the=20

centre intercolumniation, by its greater width, may give ample room for peo=
ple to enter the temple,=20



and may lend an imposing effect to the view of the statues of the gods.  [N=
ote 3: That is: two=20

metopes with a triglyph between them, and half of the triglyph on either si=
de.]  9. The columns=20

should be fluted with twenty flutes. If these are to be left plane, only th=
e twenty angles need be=20

marked off. But if they are to be channelled out, the contour of the channe=
lling may be determined=20

thus: draw a square with sides equal in length to the breadth of the flutin=
g, and centre a pair of=20

compasses in the middle of this square. Then describe a circle with a circu=
mference touching the=20

angles of the square, and let the channellings have the contour of the segm=
ent formed by the=20

circumference and the side of the square. The fluting of the Doric column w=
ill thus be finished in=20

the style appropriate to it.  10. With regard to the enlargement to be made=
 in the column at its=20

middle, let the description given for Ionic columns in the third book be ap=
plied here also in the=20

case of Doric.  Since the external appearance of the Corinthian, Doric, and=
 Ionic proportions has=20

now been described, it is necessary next to explain the arrangements of the=
 cella and the pronaos.=20

CHAPTER IV  THE CELLA AND PRONAOS   1. The length of a temple is adjusted s=
o that its=20

width may be half its length, and the actual cella one fourth greater in le=
ngth than in width,=20

including the wall in which the folding doors are placed. Let the remaining=
 three parts, constituting=20

the pronaos, extend to the antae terminating the walls, which antae ought t=
o be of the same=20

thickness as the columns. If the temple is to be more than twenty feet in w=
idth, let two columns be=20

placed between the two antae, to separate the pteroma from the pronaos. The=
 three=20

intercolumniations between the antae and the columns should be closed by lo=
w walls made of=20

marble or of joiner's work, with doors in them to afford passages into the =
pronaos.  2. If the width is=20

to be more than forty feet, let columns be placed inside and opposite to th=
e columns between the=20

antae. They should have the same height as the columns in front of them, bu=
t their thickness=20

should be proportionately reduced: thus, if the columns in front are in thi=
ckness one eighth of their=20

height, these should be one tenth; if the former are one ninth or one tenth=
, these should be=20

reduced in the same proportion. For their reduction will not be discernible=
, as the air has not free=20

play about them. Still, in case they look too slender, when the outer colum=
ns have twenty or=20

twenty-four flutes, these may have twenty-eight or thirty-two. Thus the add=
itional number of flutes=20

will make up proportionately for the loss in the body of the shaft, prevent=
ing it from being seen,=20

and so in a different way the columns will be made to look equally thick.  =
[Illustration: VITRUVIUS'=20

TEMPLE PLAN COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES]  3. The reason for this result i=
s that the=20

eye, touching thus upon a greater number of points, set closer together, ha=
s a larger compass to=20

cover with its range of vision. For if two columns, equally thick but one u=
nfluted and the other=20

fluted, are measured by drawing lines round them, one line touching the bod=
y of the columns in=20

the hollows of the channels and on the edges of the flutes, these surroundi=
ng lines, even though=20

the columns are equally thick, will not be equal to each other, because it =
takes a line of greater=20

length to compass the channels and the flutes. This being granted, it is no=
t improper, in narrow=20

quarters or where the space is enclosed, to use in a building columns of so=
mewhat slender=20

proportions, since we can help out by a duly proportionate number of flutin=
gs.  4. The walls of the=20

cella itself should be thick in proportion to its size, provided that their=
 antae are kept of the same=20

thickness as the columns. If the walls are to be of masonry, let the rubble=
 used be as small as=20

possible; but if they are to be of dimension stone or marble, the material =
ought to be of a very=20

moderate and uniform size; for the laying of the stones so as to break join=
ts will make the whole=20



work stronger, and their bevelled edges, standing up about the builds and b=
eds, will give it an=20

agreeable look, somewhat like that of a picture.     CHAPTER V  HOW THE TEM=
PLE SHOULD=20

FACE   1. The quarter toward which temples of the immortal gods ought to fa=
ce is to be=20

determined on the principle that, if there is no reason to hinder and the c=
hoice is free, the temple=20

and the statue placed in the cella should face the western quarter of the s=
ky. This will enable those=20

who approach the altar with offerings or sacrifices to face the direction o=
f the sunrise in facing the=20

statue in the temple, and thus those who are undertaking vows look toward t=
he quarter from which=20

the sun comes forth, and likewise the statues themselves appear to be comin=
g forth out duty=20

towards God and your neighbour, and then never mind what happens."  "Eccell=
enza," said Sobol=20

solemnly, "just look at nature about us: if you poke your nose or your ear =
out of your fur collar it=20

will be frost-bitten; stay in the fields for one hour, you'll be buried in =
the snow; while the village is=20

just the same as in the days of Rurik, the same Petchenyegs and Polovtsi. I=
t's nothing but being=20

burnt down, starving, and struggling against nature in every way. What was =
I saying? Yes! If one=20

thinks about it, you know, looks into it and analyses all this hotchpotch, =
if you will allow me to call it=20

so, it's not life but more like a fire in a theatre! Any one who falls down=
 or screams with terror, or=20

rushes about, is the worst enemy of good order; one must stand up and look =
sharp, and not stir a=20

hair! There's no time for whimpering and busying oneself with trifles. When=
 you have to deal with=20

elemental forces you must put out force against them, be firm and as unyiel=
ding as a stone. Isn't=20

that right, grandfather?" He turned to Ivan Ivanitch and laughed. "I am no =
better than a woman=20

myself; I am a limp rag, a flabby creature, so I hate flabbiness. I can't e=
ndure petty feelings! One=20

mopes, another is frightened, a third will come straight in here and say: '=
Fie on you! Here you've=20

guzzled a dozen courses and you talk about the starving!' That's petty and =
stupid! A fourth will=20

reproach you, Eccellenza, for being rich. Excuse me, Eccellenza," he went o=
n in a loud voice,=20

laying his hand on his heart, "but your having set our magistrate the task =
of hunting day and night=20

for your thieves--excuse me, that's also petty on your part. I am a little =
drunk, so that's why I say=20

this now, but you know, it is petty!"  "Who's asking him to worry himself? =
I don't understand!" I=20

said, getting up.  I suddenly felt unbearably ashamed and mortified, and I =
walked round the table.=20

"Who asks him to worry himself? I didn't ask him to.... Damn him!"  "They h=
ave arrested three men=20

and let them go again. They turned out not to be the right ones, and now th=
ey are looking for a=20

fresh lot," said Sobol, laughing. "It's too bad!"  "I did not ask him to wo=
rry himself," said I, almost=20

crying with excitement. "What's it all for? What's it all for? Well, suppos=
ing I was wrong, supposing=20

I have done wrong, why do they try to put me more in the wrong?"  "Come, co=
me, come, come!"=20

said Sobol, trying to soothe me. "Come! I have had a drop, that is why I sa=
id it. My tongue is my=20

enemy. Come," he sighed, "we have eaten and drunk wine, and now for a nap."=
  He got up from=20

the table, kissed Ivan Ivanitch on the head, and staggering from repletion,=
 went out of the dining-

room. Ivan Ivanitch and I smoked in silence.  "I don't sleep after dinner, =
my dear," said Ivan=20

Ivanitch, "but you have a rest in the lounge-room."  I agreed. In the half-=
dark and warmly heated=20

room they called the lounge-room, there stood against the walls long, wide =
sofas, solid and heavy,=20

the work of Butyga the cabinet maker; on them lay high, soft, white beds, p=
robably made by the=20

old woman in spectacles. On one of them Sobol, without his coat and boots, =
already lay asleep=20

with his face to the back of the sofa; another bed was awaiting me. I took =
off my coat and boots,=20

and, overcome by fatigue, by the spirit of Butyga which hovered over the qu=
iet lounge-room, and=20



by the light, caressing snore of Sobol, I lay down submissively.  And at on=
ce I began dreaming of=20

my wife, of her room, of the station-master with his face full of hatred, t=
he heaps of snow, a fire in=20

the theatre. I dreamed of the peasants who had stolen twenty sacks of rye o=
ut of my barn.=20

"Anyway, it's a good thing the magistrate let them go," I said.  I woke up =
at the sound of my own=20

voice, looked for a moment in perplexity at Sobol's broad back, at the buck=
les of his waistcoat, at=20

his thick heels, then lay down again and fell asleep.  When I woke up the s=
econd time it was quite=20

dark. Sobol was asleep. There was peace in my heart, and I longed to make h=
aste home. I=20

dressed and went out of the lounge-room. Ivan Ivanitch was sitting in a big=
 arm-chair in his study,=20

absolutely motionless, staring at a fixed point, and it was evident that he=
 had been in the same=20

state of petrifaction all the while I had been asleep.  "Good!" I said, yaw=
ning. "I feel as though I=20

had woken up after breaking the fast at Easter. I shall often come and see =
you now. Tell me, did=20

my wife ever dine here?"  "So-ome-ti-mes... sometimes,"' muttered Ivan Ivan=
itch, making an effort=20

to stir. "She dined here last Saturday. Yes.... She likes me."  After a sil=
ence I said:  "Do you=20

remember, Ivan Ivanitch, you told me I had a disagreeable character and tha=
t it was difficult to get=20

on with me? But what am I to do to make my character different?"  "I don't =
know, my dear boy....=20

I'm a feeble old man, I can't advise you.... Yes.... But I said that to you=
 at the time because I am=20

fond of you and fond of your wife, and I was fond of your father.... Yes. I=
 shall soon die, and what=20

need have I to conceal things from you or to tell you lies? So I tell you: =
I am very fond of you, but I=20

don't respect you. No, I don't respect you."  He turned towards me and said=
 in a breathless=20

whisper:  "It's impossible to respect you, my dear fellow. You look like a =
real man. You have the=20

figure and deportment of the French President Carnot--I saw a portrait of h=
im the other day in an=20

illustrated paper... yes.... You use lofty language, and you are clever, an=
d you are high up in the=20

service beyond all reach, but haven't real soul, my dear boy... there's no =
strength in it."  "A=20

Scythian, in fact," I laughed. "But what about my wife? Tell me something a=
bout my wife; you know=20

her better."  I wanted to talk about my wife, but Sobol came in and prevent=
ed me.  "I've had a=20

sleep and a wash," he said, looking at me naively. "I'll have a cup of tea =
with some rum in it and go=20

home."  VII  It was by now past seven. Besides Ivan Ivanitch, women servant=
s, the old dame in=20

spectacles, the little girls and the peasant, all accompanied us from the h=
all out on to the steps,=20

wishing us good-bye and all sorts of blessings, while near the horses in th=
e darkness there were=20

standing and moving about men with lanterns, telling our coachmen how and w=
hich way to drive,=20

and wishing us a lucky journey. The horses, the men, and the sledges were w=
hite.  "Where do all=20

these people come from?" I asked as my three horses and the doctor's two mo=
ved at a walking=20

pace out of the yard.  "They are all his serfs," said Sobol. "The new order=
 has not reached him yet.=20

Some of the old servants are living out their lives with him, and then ther=
e are orphans of all sorts=20

who have nowhere to go; there are some, too, who insist on living there, th=
ere's no turning them=20

out. A queer old man!"  Again the flying horses, the strange voice of drunk=
en Nikanor, the wind=20

and the persistent snow, which got into one's eyes, one's mouth, and every =
fold of one's fur coat....=20

"Well, I am running a rig," I thought, while my bells chimed in with the do=
ctor's, the wind whistled,=20

the coachmen shouted; and while this frantic uproar was going on, I recalle=
d all the details of that=20

strange wild day, unique in my life, and it seemed to me that I really had =
gone out of my mind or=20

become a different man. It was as though the man I had been till that day w=
ere already a stranger=20

to me.  The doctor drove behind and kept talking loudly with his coachman. =
From time to time he=20



overtook me, drove side by side, and always, with the same naive confidence=
 that it was very=20

pleasant to me, offered me a cigarette or asked for the matches. Or, overta=
king me, he would lean=20

right out of his sledge, and waving about the sleeves of his fur coat, whic=
h were at least twice as=20

long as his arms, shout:  "Go it, Vaska! Beat the thousand roublers! Hey, m=
y kittens!"  And to the=20

accompaniment of loud, malicious laughter from Sobol and his Vaska the doct=
or's kittens raced=20

ahead. My Nikanor took it as an affront, and held in his three horses, but =
when the doctor's bells=20

had passed out of hearing, he raised his elbows, shouted, and our horses fl=
ew like mad in pursuit.=20

We drove into a village, there were glimpses of lights, the silhouettes of =
huts. Some one shouted:=20

"Ah, the devils!" We seemed to have galloped a mile and a half, and still i=
t was the village street=20

and there seemed no end to it. When we caught up the doctor and drove more =
quietly, he asked=20

for matches and said:  "Now try and feed that street! And, you know, there =
are five streets like that,=20

sir. Stay, stay," he shouted. "Turn in at the tavern! We must get warm and =
let the horses rest."=20

They stopped at the tavern.  "I have more than one village like that in my =
district," said the doctor,=20

opening a heavy door with a squeaky block, and ushering me in front of him.=
 "If you look in broad=20

daylight you can't see to the end of the street, and there are side-streets=
, too, and one can do=20

nothing but scratch one's head. It's hard to do anything."  We went into th=
e best room where there=20

was a strong smell of table-cloths, and at our entrance a sleepy peasant in=
 a waistcoat and a shirt=20

worn outside his trousers jumped up from a bench. Sobol asked for some beer=
 and I asked for tea.=20

"It's hard to do anything," said Sobol. "Your wife has faith; I respect her=
 and have the greatest=20

reverence for her, but I have no great faith myself. As long as our relatio=
ns to the people continue=20

to have the character of ordinary philanthropy, as shown in orphan asylums =
and almshouses, so=20

long we shall only be shuffling, shamming, and deceiving ourselves, and not=
hing more. Our=20

relations ought to be businesslike, founded on calculation, knowledge, and =
justice. My Vaska has=20

been working for me all his life; his crops have failed, he is sick and sta=
rving. If I give him fifteen=20

kopecks a day, by so doing I try to restore him to his former condition as =
a workman; that is, I am=20

first and foremost looking after my own interests, and yet for some reason =
I call that fifteen=20

kopecks relief, charity, good works. Now let us put it like this. On the mo=
st modest computation,=20

reckoning seven kopecks a soul and five souls a family, one needs three hun=
dred and fifty roubles=20

a day to feed a thousand families. That sum is fixed by our practical duty =
to a thousand families.=20

Meanwhile we give not three hundred and fifty a day, but only ten, and say =
that that is relief,=20

charity, that that makes your wife and all of us exceptionally good people =
and hurrah for our=20

humaneness. That is it, my dear soul! Ah! if we would talk less of being hu=
mane and calculated=20

more, reasoned, and took a conscientious attitude to our duties! How many s=
uch humane,=20

sensitive people there are among us who tear about in all good faith with s=
ubscription lists, but=20

don't pay their tailors or their cooks. There is no logic in our life; that=
's what it is! No logic!"  We=20

were silent for a while. I was making a mental calculation and said:  "I wi=
ll feed a thousand families=20

for two hundred days. Come and see me tomorrow to talk it over."  I was ple=
ased that this was=20

said quite simply, and was glad that Sobol answered me still more simply:  =
"Right."  We paid for=20

what we had and went out of the tavern.  "I like going on like this," said =
Sobol, getting into the=20

sledge. "Eccellenza, oblige me with a match. I've forgotten mine in the tav=
ern."  A quarter of an=20

hour later his horses fell behind, and the sound of his bells was lost in t=
he roar of the snow-storm.=20

Reaching home, I walked about my rooms, trying to think things over and to =
define my position=20



clearly to myself; I had not one word, one phrase, ready for my wife. My br=
ain was not working.=20

But without thinking of anything, I went downstairs to my wife. She was in =
her room, in the same=20

pink dressing-gown, and standing in the same attitude as though screening h=
er papers from me.=20

On her face was an expression of perplexity and irony, and it was evident t=
hat having heard of my=20

arrival, she had prepared herself not to cry, not to entreat me, not to def=
end herself, as she had=20

done the day before, but to laugh at me, to answer me contemptuously, and t=
o act with decision.=20

Her face was saying: "If that's how it is, good-bye."  "Natalie, I've not g=
one away," I said, "but it's=20

not deception. I have gone out of my mind; I've grown old, I'm ill, I've be=
come a different man--

think as you like.... I've shaken off my old self with horror, with horror;=
 I despise him and am=20

ashamed of him, and the new man who has been in me since yesterday will not=
 let me go away.=20

Do not drive me away, Natalie!"  She looked intently into my face and belie=
ved me, and there was=20

a gleam of uneasiness in her eyes. Enchanted by her presence, warmed by the=
 warmth of her=20

room, I muttered as in delirium, holding out my hands to her:  "I tell you,=
 I have no one near to me=20

but you. I have never for one minute ceased to miss you, and only obstinate=
 vanity prevented me=20

from owning it. The past, when we lived as husband and wife, cannot be brou=
ght back, and there's=20

no need; but make me your servant, take all my property, and give it away t=
o any one you like. I=20

am at peace, Natalie, I am content.... I am at peace."  My wife, looking in=
tently and with curiosity=20

into my face, suddenly uttered a faint cry, burst into tears, and ran into =
the next room. I went=20

upstairs to my own storey.  An hour later I was sitting at my table, writin=
g my "History of Railways,"=20

and the starving peasants did not now hinder me from doing so. Now I feel n=
o uneasiness. Neither=20

the scenes of disorder which I saw when I went the round of the huts at Pes=
trovo with my wife and=20

Sobol the other day, nor malignant rumours, nor the mistakes of the people =
around me, nor old=20

age close upon me--nothing disturbs me. Just as the flying bullets do not h=
inder soldiers from=20

talking of their own affairs, eating and cleaning their boots, so the starv=
ing peasants do not hinder=20

me from sleeping quietly and looking after my personal affairs. In my house=
 and far around it there=20

is in full swing the work which Dr. Sobol calls "an orgy of philanthropy." =
My wife often comes up to=20

me and looks about my rooms uneasily, as though looking for what more she c=
an give to the=20

starving peasants "to justify her existence," and I see that, thanks to her=
, there will soon be nothing=20

of our property left and we shall be poor; but that does not trouble me, an=
d I smile at her gaily.=20

What will happen in the future I don't know.      DIFFICULT PEOPLE  YEVGRAF=
 IVANOVITCH=20

SHIRYAEV, a small farmer, whose father, a parish priest, now deceased, had =
received a gift of=20

three hundred acres of land from Madame Kuvshinnikov, a general's widow, wa=
s standing in a=20

corner before a copper washing-stand, washing his hands. As usual, his face=
 looked anxious and=20

ill-humoured, and his beard was uncombed.  "What weather!" he said. "It's n=
ot weather, but a=20

curse laid upon us. It's raining again!"  He grumbled on, while his family =
sat waiting at table for him=20

to have finished washing his hands before beginning dinner. Fedosya Semyono=
vna, his wife, his=20

son Pyotr, a student, his eldest daughter Varvara, and three small boys, ha=
d been sitting waiting a=20

long time. The boys--Kolka, Vanka, and Arhipka--grubby, snub-nosed little f=
ellows with chubby=20

faces and tousled hair that wanted cutting, moved their chairs impatiently,=
 while their elders sat=20

without stirring, and apparently did not care whether they ate their dinner=
 or waited....  As though=20

trying their patience, Shiryaev deliberately dried his hands, deliberately =
said his prayer, and sat=20

down to the table without hurrying himself. Cabbage-soup was served immedia=
tely. The sound of=20



carpenters' axes (Shiryaev was having a new barn built) and the laughter of=
 Fomka, their labourer,=20

teasing the turkey, floated in from the courtyard.  Big, sparse drops of ra=
in pattered on the window.=20

Pyotr, a round-shouldered student in spectacles, kept exchanging glances wi=
th his mother as he=20

ate his dinner. Several times he laid down his spoon and cleared his throat=
, meaning to begin to=20

speak, but after an intent look at his father he fell to eating again. At l=
ast, when the porridge had=20

been served, he cleared his throat resolutely and said:  "I ought to go ton=
ight by the evening train.=20

I ought to have gone before; I have missed a fortnight as it is. The lectur=
es begin on the first of=20

September."  "Well, go," Shiryaev assented; "why are you lingering on here?=
 Pack up and go, and=20

good luck to you."  A minute passed in silence.  "He must have money for th=
e journey, Yevgraf=20

Ivanovitch," the mother observed in a low voice.  "Money? To be sure, you c=
an't go without=20

money. Take it at once, since you need it. You could have had it long ago!"=
  The student heaved a=20

faint sigh and looked with relief at his mother. Deliberately Shiryaev took=
 a pocket-book out of his=20

coat-pocket and put on his spectacles.  "How much do you want?" he asked.  =
"The fare to Moscow=20

is eleven roubles forty-two kopecks...."  "Ah, money, money!" sighed the fa=
ther. (He always sighed=20

when he saw money, even when he was receiving it.) "Here are twelve roubles=
 for you. You will=20

have change out of that which will be of use to you on the journey."  "Than=
k you."  After waiting a=20

little, the student said:  "I did not get lessons quite at first last year.=
 I don't know how it will be this=20

year; most likely it will take me a little time to find work. I ought to as=
k you for fifteen roubles for my=20

lodging and dinner."  Shiryaev thought a little and heaved a sigh.  "You wi=
ll have to make ten do,"=20

he said. "Here, take it."  The student thanked him. He ought to have asked =
him for something=20

more, for clothes, for lecture fees, for books, but after an intent look at=
 his father he decided not to=20

pester him further.  The mother, lacking in diplomacy and prudence, like al=
l mothers, could not=20

restrain herself, and said:  "You ought to give him another six roubles, Ye=
vgraf Ivanovitch, for a=20

pair of boots. Why, just see, how can he go to Moscow in such wrecks?"  "Le=
t him take my old=20

ones; they are still quite good."  "He must have trousers, anyway; he is a =
disgrace to look at."  And=20

immediately after that a storm-signal showed itself, at the sight of which =
all the family trembled.=20

Shiryaev's short, fat neck turned suddenly red as a beetroot. The colour mo=
unted slowly to his=20

ears, from his ears to his temples, and by degrees suffused his whole face.=
 Yevgraf Ivanovitch=20

shifted in his chair and unbuttoned his shirt-collar to save himself from c=
hoking. He was evidently=20

struggling with the feeling that was mastering him. A deathlike silence fol=
lowed. The children held=20

their breath. Fedosya Semyonovna, as though she did not grasp what was happ=
ening to her=20

husband, went on:  "He is not a little boy now, you know; he is ashamed to =
go about without=20

clothes."  Shiryaev suddenly jumped up, and with all his might flung down h=
is fat pocket-book in=20

the middle of the table, so that a hunk of bread flew off a plate. A revolt=
ing expression of anger,=20

resentment, avarice--all mixed together--flamed on his face.  "Take everyth=
ing!" he shouted in an=20

unnatural voice; "plunder me! Take it all! Strangle me!"  He jumped up from=
 the table, clutched at=20

his head, and ran staggering about the room.  "Strip me to the last thread!=
" he shouted in a shrill=20

voice. "Squeeze out the last drop! Rob me! Wring my neck!"  The student flu=
shed and dropped his=20

eyes. He could not go on eating. Fedosya Semyonovna, who had not after twen=
ty-five years=20

grown used to her husband's difficult character, shrank into herself and mu=
ttered something in=20

self-defence. An expression of amazement and dull terror came into her wast=
ed and birdlike face,=20

which at all times looked dull and scared. The little boys and the elder da=
ughter Varvara, a girl in=20



her teens, with a pale ugly face, laid down their spoons and sat mute.  Shi=
ryaev, growing more=20

and more ferocious, uttering words each more terrible than the one before, =
dashed up to the table=20

and began shaking the notes out of his pocket-book.  "Take them!" he mutter=
ed, shaking all over.=20

"You've eaten and drunk your fill, so here's money for you too! I need noth=
ing! Order yourself new=20

boots and uniforms!"  The student turned pale and got up.  "Listen, papa," =
he began, gasping for=20

breath. "I... I beg you to end this, for..."  "Hold your tongue!" the fathe=
r shouted at him, and so=20

loudly that the spectacles fell off his nose; "hold your tongue!"  "I used.=
.. I used to be able to put up=20

with such scenes, but... but now I have got out of the way of it. Do you un=
derstand? I have got out=20

of the way of it!"  "Hold your tongue!" cried the father, and he stamped wi=
th his feet. "You must=20

listen to what I say! I shall say what I like, and you hold your tongue. At=
 your age I was earning my=20

living, while you... Do you know what you cost me, you scoundrel? I'll turn=
 you out! Wastrel!"=20

"Yevgraf Ivanovitch," muttered Fedosya Semyonovna, moving her fingers nervo=
usly; "you know=20

he... you know Petya...!"  "Hold your tongue!" Shiryaev shouted out to her,=
 and tears actually came=20

into his eyes from anger. "It is you who have spoilt them--you!=20


_
2. But if the nature of the site is such as to forbid this, then the princi=
ple of determining the quarter=20

should be changed, so that the widest possible view of the city may be had =
from the sanctuaries of=20

the gods. Furthermore, temples that are to be built beside rivers, as in Eg=
ypt on both sides of the=20

Nile, ought, as it seems, to face the river banks. Similarly, houses of the=
 gods on the sides of=20

public roads should be arranged so that the passers-by can have a view of t=
hem and pay their=20

devotions face to face.     CHAPTER VI  THE DOORWAYS OF TEMPLES   1. For th=
e doorways of=20

temples and their casings the rules are as follows, first determining of wh=
at style they are to be.=20

The styles of portals are Doric, Ionic, and Attic.  In the Doric, the symme=
trical proportions are=20

distinguished by the following rules. Let the top of the corona, which is l=
aid above the casing, be=20

on a level with the tops of the capitals of the columns in the pronaos. The=
 aperture of the doorway=20

should be determined by dividing the height of the temple, from floor to co=
ffered ceiling, into three=20

and one half parts and letting two and one half[4] thereof constitute the h=
eight of the aperture of=20

the folding doors. Let this in turn be divided into twelve parts, and let f=
ive and a half of these form=20

the width of the bottom of the aperture. At the top, this width should be d=
iminished, if the aperture=20

is sixteen feet in height, by one third the width of the door-jamb; if the =
aperture is from sixteen to=20

twenty-five feet, let the upper part of it be diminished by one quarter of =
the jamb; if from twenty-five=20

to thirty feet, let the top be diminished by one eighth of the jamb. Other =
and higher apertures=20

should, as it seems, have their sides perpendicular.  [Note 4: Codd. _duae.=
_]  2. Further, the=20

jambs themselves should be diminished at the top by one fourteenth of their=
 width. The height of=20

the lintel should be equivalent to the width of the jambs at the top. Its c=
ymatium ought to be one=20

sixth of the jamb, with a projection equivalent to its height. The style of=
 carving of the cymatium=20

with its astragal should be the Lesbian. all your fault! He has no respect =
for us, does not say his=20

prayers, and earns nothing! I am only one against the ten of you! I'll turn=
 you out of the house!"=20

The daughter Varvara gazed fixedly at her mother with her mouth open, moved=
 her vacant-looking=20

eyes to the window, turned pale, and, uttering a loud shriek, fell back in =
her chair. The father, with=20

a curse and a wave of the hand, ran out into the yard.  This was how domest=
ic scenes usually=20

ended at the Shiryaevs'. But on this occasion, unfortunately, Pyotr the stu=
dent was carried away=20

by overmastering anger. He was just as hasty and ill-tempered as his father=
 and his grandfather=20

the priest, who used to beat his parishioners about the head with a stick. =
Pale and clenching his=20

fists, he went up to his mother and shouted in the very highest tenor note =
his voice could reach:=20

"These reproaches are loathsome! sickening to me! I want nothing from you! =
Nothing! I would=20

rather die of hunger than eat another mouthful at your expense! Take your n=
asty money back! take=20

it!"  The mother huddled against the wall and waved her hands, as though it=
 were not her son, but=20

some phantom before her. "What have I done?" she wailed. "What?"  Like his =
father, the boy=20

waved his hands and ran into the yard. Shiryaev's house stood alone on a ra=
vine which ran like a=20

furrow for four miles along the steppe. Its sides were overgrown with oak s=
aplings and alders, and=20

a stream ran at the bottom. On one side the house looked towards the ravine=
, on the other=20

towards the open country, there were no fences nor hurdles. Instead there w=
ere farm-buildings of=20

all sorts close to one another, shutting in a small space in front of the h=
ouse which was regarded=20

as the yard, and in which hens, ducks, and pigs ran about.  Going out of th=
e house, the student=20

walked along the muddy road towards the open country. The air was full of a=
 penetrating autumn=20

dampness. The road was muddy, puddles gleamed here and there, and in the ye=
llow fields=20



autumn itself seemed looking out from the grass, dismal, decaying, dark. On=
 the right-hand side of=20

the road was a vegetable-garden cleared of its=20


_
the cymatium of the lintel, place the frieze of the doorway, of the same he=
ight as the lintel, and=20

having a Doric cymatium and Lesbian astragal carved upon it. Let the corona=
 and its cymatium at=20

the top of all be carved without ornamentation, and have a projection equal=
 to its height. To the=20

right and left of the lintel, which rests upon the jambs, there are to be p=
rojections fashioned like=20

projecting bases and jointed to a nicety with the cymatium itself.  3. If t=
he doorways are to be of=20

the Ionic style, the height of the aperture should be reached in the same m=
anner as in the Doric.=20

Let its width be determined by dividing the height into two and one half pa=
rts and letting one of=20

them form the width at the bottom. The diminutions should be the same as fo=
r Doric. The width of=20

the faces of the jambs should be one fourteenth of the height of the apertu=
re, and the cymatium=20

one sixth of the width. Let the rest, excluding the cymatium, be divided in=
to twelve parts. Let three=20

of these compose the first fascia with its astragal, four the second, and f=
ive the third, the fasciae=20

with their astragals running side by side all round.  4. The cornices of Io=
nic doorways should be=20

constructed in the same manner as those of Doric, in due proportions. The c=
onsoles, otherwise=20

called brackets, carved at the right and left, should hang down to the leve=
l of the bottom of the=20

lintel, exclusive of the leaf. Their width on the face should be two thirds=
 of the width of the jamb,=20

but at the bottom one fourth slenderer than above.  Doors should be constru=
cted with the hinge-

stiles one twelfth of the width of the whole aperture. The panels between t=
wo stiles should each=20

occupy three of the twelve parts.  5. The rails will be apportioned thus: d=
ivide the height into five=20

parts, of which assign two to the upper portion and three to the lower; abo=
ve the centre place the=20

middle rails; insert the others at the top and at the bottom. Let the heigh=
t of a rail be one third of=20

the breadth of a panel, and its cymatium one sixth of the rail. The width o=
f the meeting-stiles=20

should be one half the rail, and the cover-joint two thirds of the rail. Th=
e stiles toward the side of=20

the jambs should be one half the rail. If the doors have folds in them, the=
 height will remain as=20

before, but the width should be double that of a single door; if the door i=
s to have four folds, its=20

height should be increased.  [Illustration: VITRUVIUS' RULE FOR DOORWAYS CO=
MPARED=20

WITH TWO EXAMPLES]  6. Attic doorways are built with the same proportions a=
s Doric. Besides,=20

there are fasciae running all round under the cymatia on the jambs, and app=
ortioned so as to be=20

equal to three sevenths of a jamb, excluding the cymatium. The doors are wi=
thout lattice-work, are=20

not double but have folds in them, and open outward.  The laws which should=
 govern the design of=20

temples built in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian styles, have now, so far =
as I could arrive at them,=20

been set forth according to what may be called the accepted methods. I shal=
l next speak of the=20

arrangements in the Tuscan style, showing how they should be treated.     C=
HAPTER VII=20

TUSCAN TEMPLES   1. The place where the temple is to be built having been d=
ivided on its=20

length into six parts, deduct one and let the rest be given to its width. T=
hen let the length be=20

divided into two equal parts, of which let the inner be reserved as space f=
or the cellae, and the part=20

next the front left for the arrangement of the columns.  2. Next let the wi=
dth be divided into ten=20

parts. Of these, let three on the right and three on the left be given to t=
he smaller cellae, or to the=20

alae if there are to be alae, and the other four devoted to the middle of t=
he temple. Let the space in=20

front of the cellae, in the pronaos, be marked out for columns thus: the co=
rner columns should be=20

placed opposite the antae on the line of the outside walls; the two middle =
columns, set out on the=20

line of the walls which are between the antae and the middle of the temple;=
 and through the=20

middle, between the antae and the front columns, a second row, arranged on =
the same lines. Let=20



the thickness of the columns at the bottom be one seventh of their height, =
their height one third of=20

the width of the temple, and the diminution of a column at the top, one fou=
rth of its thickness at the=20

bottom.  [Illustration: THE TUSCAN TEMPLE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS.]  3. The =
height of=20

their bases should be one half of that thickness. The plinth of their bases=
 should be circular, and in=20

height one half the height of the bases, the torus above it and conge being=
 of the same height as=20

the plinth. The height of the capital is one half the thickness of a column=
. The abacus has a width=20

equivalent to the thickness of the bottom of a column. Let the height of th=
e capital be divided into=20

three parts, and give one to the plinth (that is, the abacus), the second t=
o the echinus, and the=20

third to the necking with its conge.  4. Upon the columns lay the main beam=
s, fastened together, to=20

a height commensurate with the requirements of the size of the building. Th=
ese beams fastened=20

together should be laid so as to be equivalent in thickness to the necking =
at the top of a column,=20

and should be fastened together by means of dowels and dove-tailed tenons i=
n such a way that=20

there shall be a space two fingers broad between them at the fastening. For=
 if they touch one=20

another, and so do not leave airholes and admit draughts of air to blow bet=
ween them, they get=20

heated and soon begin to rot.  5. Above the beams and walls let the mutules=
 project to a distance=20

equal to one quarter of the height of a column; along the front of them nai=
l casings; above, build=20

the tympanum of the pediment either in masonry or in wood. The pediment wit=
h its ridgepole,=20

principal rafters, and purlines are to be built in such a way that the eave=
s shall be equivalent to=20

one third of the completed roof.     CHAPTER VIII  CIRCULAR TEMPLES AND OTH=
ER=20

VARIETIES   1. There are also circular temples, some of which are construct=
ed in monopteral=20

form, surrounded by columns but without a cella, while others are termed pe=
ripteral. Those that=20

are without a cella have a raised platform and a flight of steps leading to=
 it, one third of the=20

diameter of the temple. The columns upon the stylobates are constructed of =
a height equivalent to=20

the diameter taken between the outer edges of the stylobate walls, and of a=
 thickness equivalent=20

to one tenth of their height including the capitals and bases. The architra=
ve has the height of one=20

half of the thickness of a column. The frieze and the other parts placed ab=
ove it are such as I have=20

described in the third[5] book, on the subject of symmetrical proportions. =

ion: TEMPLE=20

AT TIVOLI]  [Illustration: _From Durm_  PLAN OF THE TEMPLE OF VESTA AT ROME=
]  2. But if=20

such a temple is to be constructed in peripteral form, let two steps and th=
en the stylobate be=20

constructed below. Next, let the cella wall be set up, recessed within the =
stylobate about one fifth=20

of the breadth thereof, and let a place for folding doors be left in the mi=
ddle to afford entrance. This=20

cella, excluding its walls and the passage round the outside, should have a=
 diameter equivalent to=20

the height of a column above the stylobate. Let the columns round the cella=
 be arranged in the=20

symmetrical proportions just given.  3. The proportions of the roof in the =
centre should be such that=20

the height of the rotunda, excluding the finial, is equivalent to one half =
the diameter of the whole=20

work. The finial, excluding its pyramidal base, should have the dimensions =
of the capital of a=20

column. All the rest must be built in the symmetrical proportions described=
 above.  [Illustration:=20

_From Durm_  THE CIRCULAR TEMPLE ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS]  4. There are also=
 other=20

kinds of temples, constructed in the same symmetrical proportions and yet w=
ith a different it with=20

hanging heads already black.  Pyotr thought it would not be a bad thing to =
walk to Moscow on foot;=20



to walk just as he was, with holes in his boots, without a cap, and without=
 a farthing of money.=20

When he had gone eighty miles his father, frightened and aghast, would over=
take him, would=20

begin begging him to turn back or take the money, but he would not even loo=
k at him, but would=20

go on and on.... Bare forests would be followed by desolate fields, fields =
by forests again; soon the=20

earth would be white with the first snow, and the streams would be coated w=
ith ice.... Somewhere=20

near Kursk or near Serpuhovo, exhausted and dying of hunger, he would sink =
down and die. His=20

corpse would be found, and there would be a paragraph in all the papers say=
ing that a student=20

called Shiryaev had died of hunger....  A white dog with a muddy tail who w=
as wandering about the=20

vegetable-garden looking for something gazed at him and sauntered after him=
.  He walked along=20

the road and thought of death, of the grief of his family, of the moral suf=
ferings of his father, and=20

then pictured all sorts of adventures on the road, each more marvellous tha=
n the one before--

picturesque places, terrible nights, chance encounters. He imagined a strin=
g of pilgrims, a hut in=20

the forest with one little window shining in the darkness; he stands before=
 the window, begs for a=20

night's lodging.... They let him in, and suddenly he sees that they are rob=
bers. Or, better still, he is=20

taken into a big manor-house, where, learning who he is, they give him food=
 and drink, play to him=20

on the piano, listen to his complaints, and the daughter of the house, a be=
auty, falls in love with=20

him.  Absorbed in his bitterness and such thoughts, young Shiryaev walked o=
n and on. Far, far=20

ahead he saw the inn, a dark patch against the grey background of cloud. Be=
yond the inn, on the=20

very horizon, he could see a little hillock; this was the railway-station. =
That hillock reminded him of=20

the connection existing between the place where he was now standing and Mos=
cow, where street-

lamps were burning and carriages were rattling in the streets, where lectur=
es were being given.=20

And he almost wept with depression and impatience. The solemn landscape, wi=
th its order and=20

beauty, the deathlike stillness all around, revolted him and moved him to d=
espair and hatred!=20

"Look out!" He heard behind him a loud voice.  An old lady of his acquainta=
nce, a landowner of the=20

neighbourhood, drove past him in a light, elegant landau. He bowed to her, =
and smiled all over his=20

face. And at once he caught himself in that smile, which was so out of keep=
ing with his gloomy=20

mood. Where did it come from if his whole heart was full of vexation and mi=
sery? And he thought=20

nature itself had given man this capacity for lying, that even in difficult=
 moments of spiritual strain=20

he might be able to hide the secrets of his nest as the fox and the wild du=
ck do. Every family has=20

its joys and its horrors, but however great they may be, it's hard for an o=
utsider's eye to see them;=20

they are a secret. The father of the old lady who had just driven by, for i=
nstance, had for some=20

offence lain for half his lifetime under the ban of the wrath of Tsar Nicol=
as I.; her husband had=20

been a gambler; of her four sons, not one had turned out well. One could im=
agine how many=20

terrible scenes there must have been in her life, how many tears must have =
been shed. And yet=20

the old lady seemed happy and satisfied, and she had answered his smile by =
smiling too. The=20

student thought of his comrades, who did not like talking about their famil=
ies; he thought of his=20

mother, who almost always lied when she had to speak of her husband and chi=
ldren....  Pyotr=20

walked about the roads far from home till dusk, abandoning himself to drear=
y thoughts. When it=20

began to drizzle with rain he turned homewards. As he walked back he made u=
p his mind at all=20

costs to talk to his father, to explain to him, once and for all, that it w=
as dreadful and oppressive to=20

live with him.  He found perfect stillness in the house. His sister Varvara=
 was lying behind a screen=20

with a headache, moaning faintly. His mother, with a look of amazement and =
guilt upon her face,=20



was sitting beside her on a box, mending Arhipka's trousers. Yevgraf Ivanov=
itch was pacing from=20

one window to another, scowling at the weather. From his walk, from the way=
 he cleared his=20

throat, and even from the back of his head, it was evident he felt himself =
to blame.  "I suppose you=20

have changed your mind about going today?" he asked.  The student felt sorr=
y for him, but=20

immediately suppressing that feeling, he said:  "Listen... I must speak to =
you seriously... yes,=20

seriously. I have always respected you, and... and have never brought mysel=
f to speak to you in=20

such a tone, but your behaviour... your last action..."  The father looked =
out of the window and did=20

not speak. The student, as though considering his words, rubbed his forehea=
d and went on in=20

great excitement:  "Not a dinner or tea passes without your making an uproa=
r. Your bread sticks in=20

our throat... nothing is more bitter, more humiliating, than bread that sti=
cks in one's throat....=20

Though you are my father, no one, neither God nor nature, has given you the=
 right to insult and=20

humiliate us so horribly, to vent your ill-humour on the weak. You have wor=
n my mother out and=20

made a slave of her, my sister is hopelessly crushed, while I..."  "It's no=
t your business to teach=20

me," said his father.  "Yes, it is my business! You can quarrel with me as =
much as you like, but=20

leave my mother in peace! I will not allow you to torment my mother!" the s=
tudent went on, with=20

flashing eyes. "You are spoilt because no one has yet dared to oppose you. =
They tremble and are=20

mute towards you, but now that is over! Coarse, ill-bred man! You are coars=
e... do you=20

understand? You are coarse, ill-humoured, unfeeling. And the peasants can't=
 endure you!"  The=20

student had by now lost his thread, and was not so much speaking as firing =
off detached words.=20

Yevgraf Ivanovitch listened in silence, as though stunned; but suddenly his=
 neck turned crimson,=20

the colour crept up his face, and he made a movement.  "Hold your tongue!" =
he shouted.  "That's=20

right!" the son persisted; "you don't like to hear the truth! Excellent! Ve=
ry good! begin shouting!=20

Excellent!"  "Hold your tongue, I tell you!" roared Yevgraf Ivanovitch.  Fe=
dosya Semyonovna=20

appeared in the doorway, very pale, with an astonished face; she tried to s=
ay something, but she=20

could not, and could only move her fingers.  "It's all your fault!" Shiryae=
v shouted at her. "You have=20

brought him up like this!"  "I don't want to go on living in this house!" s=
houted the student, crying,=20

and looking angrily at his mother. "I don't want to live with you!"  Varvar=
a uttered a shriek behind=20

the screen and broke into loud sobs. With a wave of his hand, Shiryaev ran =
out of the house.  The=20

student went to his own room and quietly lay down. He lay till midnight wit=
hout moving or opening=20

his eyes. He felt neither anger nor shame, but a vague ache in his soul. He=
 neither blamed his=20

father nor pitied his mother, nor was he tormented by stings of conscience;=
 he realized that every=20

one in the house was feeling the same ache, and God only knew which was mos=
t to blame, which=20

was suffering most....  At midnight he woke the labourer, and told him to h=
ave the horse ready at=20

five o'clock in the morning for him to drive to the station; he undressed a=
nd got into bed, but could=20

not get to sleep. He heard how his father, still awake, paced slowly from w=
indow to window,=20

sighing, till early morning. No one was asleep; they spoke rarely, and only=
 in whispers. Twice his=20

mother came to him behind the screen. Always with the same look of vacant w=
onder, she slowly=20

made the cross over him, shaking nervously.  At five o'clock in the morning=
 he said good-bye to=20

them all affectionately, and even shed tears. As he passed his father's roo=
m, he glanced in at the=20

door. Yevgraf Ivanovitch, who had not taken off his clothes or gone to bed,=
 was=20


_
example, the temple of Castor in the district of the Circus Flaminius, that=
 of Vejovis between the=20

two groves, and still more ingeniously the temple of Diana in her sacred gr=
ove, with columns=20

added on the right and left at the flanks of the pronaos. Temples of this k=
ind, like that of Castor in=20

the Circus, were first built in Athens on the Acropolis, and in Attica at S=
unium to Pallas Minerva.=20

The proportions of them are not different, but the same as usual. For the l=
ength of their cellae is=20

twice the width, as in other temples; but all that we regularly find in the=
 fronts of others is in these=20

transferred to the sides.  5. Some take the arrangement of columns belongin=
g to the Tuscan order=20

and apply it to buildings in the Corinthian and Ionic styles, and where the=
re are projecting antae in=20

the pronaos, set up two columns in a line with each of the cella walls, thu=
s making a combination=20

of the principles of Tuscan and Greek buildings.  6. Others actually remove=
 the temple walls,=20

transferring them to the intercolumniations, and thus, by dispensing with t=
he space needed for a=20

pteroma, greatly increase the extent of the cella. So, while leaving all th=
e rest in the same=20

symmetrical proportions, they appear to have produced a new kind of plan wi=
th the new name=20

"pseudoperipteral." These kinds, however, vary according to the requirement=
s of the sacrifices.=20

For we must not build temples according to the same rules to all gods alike=
, since the performance=20

of the sacred rites varies with the various gods.  7. I have now set forth,=
 as they have come down=20

to me, all the principles governing the building of temples, have marked ou=
t under separate heads=20

their arrangements and proportions, and have set forth, so far as I could e=
xpress them in writing,=20

the differences in their plans and the distinctions which make them unlike =
one another. Next, with=20

regard to the altars of the immortal gods, I shall state how they may be co=
nstructed so as to=20

conform to the rules governing sacrifices.     CHAPTER IX  ALTARS   Altars =
should face the east,=20

and should always be placed on a lower level than are the statues in the te=
mples, so that those=20

who are praying and sacrificing may look upwards towards the divinity. They=
 are of different=20

heights, being each regulated so as to be appropriate to its own god. Their=
 heights are to be=20

adjusted thus: for Jupiter and all the celestials, let them be constructed =
as high as possible; for=20

Vesta and Mother Earth, let them be built low. In accordance with these rul=
es will altars be=20

adjusted when one is preparing his plans.  Having described the arrangement=
s of temples in this=20

book, in the following we shall give an exposition of the construction of p=
ublic buildings.     BOOK=20

V     INTRODUCTION   1. Those who have filled books of unusually large size=
, Emperor, in setting=20

forth their intellectual ideas and doctrines, have thus made a very great a=
nd remarkable addition to=20

the authority of their writings. I could wish that circumstances made this =
as permissible in the case=20

of our subject, so that the authority of the present treatise might be incr=
eased by amplifications;=20

but this is not so easy as it may be thought. Writing on architecture is no=
t like history or poetry.=20

History is captivating to the reader from its very nature; for it holds out=
 the hope of various=20

novelties. Poetry, with its measures and metrical feet, its refinement in t=
he arrangement of words,=20

and the delivery in verse of the sentiments expressed by the several charac=
ters to one another,=20

delights the feelings of the reader, and leads him smoothly on to the very =
end of the work.  2. But=20

this cannot be the case with architectural treatises, because those terms w=
hich originate in the=20

peculiar needs of the art, give rise to obscurity of ideas from the unusual=
 nature of the language.=20

Hence, while the things themselves are not well known, and their names not =
in common use, if=20

besides this the principles are described in a very diffuse fashion without=
 any attempt at=20

conciseness and explanation in a few pellucid sentences, such fullness and =
amplitude of treatment=20



will be only a hindrance, and will give the reader nothing but indefinite n=
otions. Therefore, when I=20

mention obscure terms, and the symmetrical proportions of members of buildi=
ngs, I shall give brief=20

explanations, so that they may be committed to memory; for thus expressed, =
the mind will be=20

enabled to understand them the more easily.  3. Furthermore, since I have o=
bserved that our=20

citizens are distracted with public affairs and private business, I have th=
ought it best to write=20

briefly, so that my readers, whose intervals of leisure are small, may be a=
ble to comprehend in a=20

short time.  Then again, Pythagoras and those who came after him in his sch=
ool thought it proper=20

to employ the principles of the cube in composing books on their doctrines,=
 and, having=20

determined that the cube consisted of 216[6] lines, held that there should =
be no more than three=20

cubes in any one treatise.  [Note 6: Codd. _CC. & L._]  4. A cube is a body=
 with sides all of equal=20

breadth and their surfaces perfectly square. When thrown down, it stands fi=
rm and steady so long=20

as it is untouched, no matter on which of its sides it has fallen, like the=
 dice which players throw on=20

the board. The Pythagoreans appear to have drawn their analogy from the cub=
e, because the=20

number of lines mentioned will be fixed firmly and steadily in the memory w=
hen they have once=20

settled down, like a cube, upon a man's understanding. The Greek comic poet=
s, also, divided their=20

plays into parts by introducing a choral song, and by this partition on the=
 principle of the cubes,=20

they relieve the actor's speeches by such intermissions.  5. Since these ru=
les, founded on the=20

analogy of nature, were followed by our predecessors, and since I observe t=
hat I have to write on=20

unusual subjects which many persons will find obscure, I have thought it be=
st to write in short=20

books, so that they may the more readily strike the understanding of the re=
ader: for they will thus=20

be easy to comprehend. I have also arranged them so that those in search of=
 knowledge on a=20

subject may not have to gather it from different places, but may find it in=
 one complete treatment,=20

with the various classes set forth each in a book by itself. Hence, Caesar,=
 in the third and fourth=20

books I gave the rules for temples; in this book I shall treat of the layin=
g out of public places. I shall=20

speak first of the proper arrangement of the forum, for in it the course of=
 both public and private=20

affairs is directed by the magistrates.     CHAPTER I  THE FORUM AND BASILI=
CA   1. The=20

Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by very spac=
ious double=20

colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather closely together, and with e=
ntablatures of stone=20

or marble, and construct walks above in the upper story. But in the cities =
of Italy the same method=20

cannot be followed, for the reason that it is a custom handed down from our=
 ancestors that=20

gladiatorial shows should be given in the forum.  [Illustration: _From Gsel=
l_  FORUM AT TIMGAD=20

A, Forum. B, Basilica. C, Curia. C', Official Building. D, Small Temple. E,=
 Latrina. F, Atrium.]  2.=20

Therefore let the intercolumniations round the show place be pretty wide; r=
ound about in the=20

colonnades put the bankers' offices; and have balconies on the upper floor =
properly arranged so=20

as to be convenient, and to bring in some public revenue.  The size of a fo=
rum should be=20

proportionate to the number of inhabitants, so that it may not be too small=
 a space to be useful,=20

nor look like a desert waste for lack of population. To determine its bread=
th, divide its length into=20

three parts and assign two of them to the breadth. Its shape will then be o=
blong, and its ground=20

plan conveniently suited to the conditions of shows.  3. The columns of the=
 upper tier should be=20

one fourth smaller than those of the lower, because, for the purpose of bea=
ring the load, what is=20

below ought to be stronger than what is above, and also, because we ought t=
o imitate nature as=20

seen in the case of things growing; for example, in round smooth-stemmed tr=
ees, like the fir,=20



cypress, and pine, every one of which is rather thick just above the roots =
and then, as it goes on=20

increasing in height, tapers off naturally and symmetrically in growing up =
to the top. Hence, if=20

nature requires this in things growing, it is the right arrangement that wh=
at is above should be less=20

in height and thickness than what is below.  4. Basilicas should be constru=
cted on a site adjoining=20

the forum and in the warmest possible quarter, so that in winter business m=
en may gather in them=20

without being troubled by the weather. In breadth they should be not less t=
han one third nor more=20

than one half of their length, unless the site is naturally such as to prev=
ent this and to oblige an=20

alteration in these proportions. If the length of the site is greater than =
necessary, Chalcidian=20

porches may be constructed at the ends, as in the Julia Aquiliana.  5. It i=
s thought that the columns=20

of basilicas ought to be as high as the side-aisles are broad; an aisle sho=
uld be limited to one third=20

of the breadth which the open space in the middle is to have. Let the colum=
ns of the upper tier be=20

smaller than those of the lower, as written above. The screen, to be placed=
 between the upper and=20

the lower tiers of columns, ought to be, it is thought, one fourth lower th=
an the columns of the=20

upper tier, so that people walking in the upper story of the basilica may n=
ot be seen by the=20

business men. The architraves, friezes, and cornices should be adjusted to =
the proportions of the=20

columns, as we have stated in the third book.  [Illustration: _From Mau_  F=

 But basilicas of the=20

greatest dignity and beauty may also be constructed in the style of that on=
e which I erected, and=20

the building of which I superintended at Fano. Its proportions and symmetri=
cal relations were=20

established as follows. In the middle, the main roof between the columns is=
 120 feet long and sixty=20

feet wide. Its aisle round the space beneath the main roof and between the =
walls and the columns=20

is twenty feet broad. The columns, of unbroken height, measuring with their=
 capitals fifty feet, and=20

being each five feet thick, have behind them pilasters, twenty feet high, t=
wo and one half feet=20

broad, and one and one half feet thick, which support the beams on which is=
 carried the upper=20

flooring of the aisles. Above them are other pilasters, eighteen feet high,=
 two feet broad, and a foot=20

thick, which carry the beams supporting the principal raftering and the roo=
f of the aisles, which is=20

brought down lower than the main roof.  [Illustration: _From Durm_  PLAN OF=
 THE BASILICA AT=20

POMPEII]  7. The spaces remaining between the beams supported by the pilast=
ers and the=20

columns, are left for windows between the intercolumniations. The columns a=
re: on the breadth of=20

the main roof at each end, four, including the corner columns at right and =
left; on the long side=20

which is next to the forum, eight, including the same corner columns; on th=
e other side, six,=20

including the corner columns. This is because the two middle panes.  "Good-=
bye; I am going," said=20

his son.  "Good-bye... the money is on the round table..." his father answe=
red, without turning=20

round.  A cold, hateful rain was falling as the labourer drove him to the s=
tation. The sunflowers=20

were drooping their heads still lower, and the grass seemed darker than eve=
r.      THE=20

GRASSHOPPER  I  ALL Olga Ivanovna's friends and acquaintances were at her w=
edding.  "Look=20

at him; isn't it true that there is something in him?" she said to her frie=
nds, with a nod towards her=20

husband, as though she wanted to explain why she was marrying a simple, ver=
y ordinary, and in=20

no way remarkable man.  Her husband, Osip Stepanitch Dymov, was a doctor, a=
nd only of the=20



rank of a titular councillor. He was on the staff of two hospitals: in one =
a ward-surgeon and in the=20

other a dissecting demonstrator. Every day from nine to twelve he saw patie=
nts and was busy in=20

his ward, and after twelve o'clock he went by tram to the other hospital, w=
here he dissected. His=20

private practice was a small one, not worth more than five hundred roubles =
a year. That was all.=20

What more could one say about him? Meanwhile, Olga Ivanovna and her friends=
 and=20

acquaintances were not quite ordinary people. Every one of them was remarka=
ble in some way,=20

and more or less famous; already had made a reputation and was looked upon =
as a celebrity; or if=20

not yet a celebrity, gave brilliant promise of becoming one. There was an a=
ctor from the Dramatic=20

Theatre, who was a great talent of established reputation, as well as an el=
egant, intelligent, and=20

modest man, and a capital elocutionist, and who taught Olga Ivanovna to rec=
ite; there was a=20

singer from the opera, a good-natured, fat man who assured Olga Ivanovna, w=
ith a sigh, that she=20

was ruining herself, that if she would take herself in hand and not be lazy=
 she might make a=20

remarkable singer; then there were several artists, and chief among them Ry=
abovsky, a very=20

handsome, fair young man of five-and-twenty who painted genre pieces, anima=
l studies, and=20

landscapes, was successful at exhibitions, and had sold his last picture fo=
r five hundred roubles.=20

He touched up Olga Ivanovna's sketches, and used to say she might do someth=
ing. Then a=20

violoncellist, whose instrument used to sob, and who openly declared that o=
f all the ladies of his=20

acquaintance the only one who could accompany him was Olga Ivanovna; then t=
here was a=20

literary man, young but already well known, who had written stories, novels=
, and plays. Who else?=20

Why, Vassily Vassilyitch, a landowner and amateur illustrator and vignettis=
t, with a great feeling for=20

the old Russian style, the old ballad and epic. On paper, on china, and on =
smoked plates, he=20

produced literally marvels. In the midst of this free artistic company, spo=
iled by fortune, though=20

refined and modest, who recalled the existence of doctors only in times of =
illness, and to whom the=20

name of Dymov sounded in no way different from Sidorov or Tarasov--in the m=
idst of this company=20

Dymov seemed strange, not wanted, and small, though he was tall and broad-s=
houldered. He=20

looked as though he had on somebody else's coat, and his beard was like a s=
hopman's. Though if=20

he had been a writer or an artist, they would have said that his beard remi=
nded them of Zola.  An=20

artist said to Olga Ivanovna that with her flaxen hair and in her wedding-d=
ress she was very much=20

like a graceful cherry-tree when it is covered all over with delicate white=
 blossoms in spring.  "Oh,=20

let me tell you," said Olga Ivanovna, taking his arm, "how it was it all ca=
me to pass so suddenly.=20

Listen, listen!... I must tell you that my father was on the same staff at =
the hospital as Dymov.=20

When my poor father was taken ill, Dymov watched for days and nights togeth=
er at his bedside.=20

Such self-sacrifice! Listen, Ryabovsky! You, my writer, listen; it is very =
interesting! Come nearer.=20

Such self-sacrifice, such genuine sympathy! I sat up with my father, and di=
d not sleep for nights,=20

either. And all at once--the princess had won the hero's heart--my Dymov fe=
ll head over ears in=20

love. Really, fate is so strange at times! Well, after my father's death he=
 came to see me=20

sometimes, met me in the street, and one fine evening, all at once he made =
me an offer... like=20

snow upon my head.... I lay awake all night, crying, and fell hellishly in =
love myself. And here, as=20

you see, I am his wife. There really is something strong, powerful, bearlik=
e about him, isn't there?=20

Now his face is turned three-quarters towards us in a bad light, but when h=
e turns round look at his=20

forehead. Ryabovsky, what do you say to that forehead? Dymov, we are talkin=
g about you!" she=20

called to her husband. "Come here; hold out your honest hand to Ryabovsky..=
.. That's right, be=20



friends."  Dymov, with a naive and good-natured smile, held out his hand to=
 Ryabovsky, and said:=20

"Very glad to meet you. There was a Ryabovsky in my year at the medical sch=
ool. Was he a=20

relation of yours?"   II   Olga Ivanovna was twenty-two, Dymov was thirty-o=
ne. They got on=20

splendidly together when they were married. Olga Ivanovna hung all her draw=
ing-room walls with=20

her own and other people's sketches, in frames and without frames, and near=
 the piano and=20

furniture arranged picturesque corners with Japanese parasols, easels, dagg=
ers, busts,=20

photographs, and rags of many colours.... In the dining-room she papered th=
e walls with peasant=20

woodcuts, hung up bark shoes and sickles, stood in a corner a scythe and a =
rake, and so=20

achieved a dining-room in the Russian style. In her bedroom she draped the =
ceiling and the walls=20

with dark cloths to make it like a cavern, hung a Venetian lantern over the=
 beds, and at the door=20

set a figure with a halberd. And every one thought that the young people ha=
d a very charming little=20

home.  When she got up at eleven o'clock every morning, Olga Ivanovna playe=
d the piano or, if it=20

were sunny, painted something in oils. Then between twelve and one she drov=
e to her=20

dressmaker's. As Dymov and she had very little money, only just enough, she=
 and her dressmaker=20

were often put to clever shifts to enable her to appear constantly in new d=
resses and make a=20

sensation with them. Very often out of an old dyed dress, out of bits of tu=
lle, lace, plush, and silk,=20

costing nothing, perfect marvels were created, something bewitching--not a =
dress, but a dream.=20

From the dressmaker's Olga Ivanovna usually drove to some actress of her ac=
quaintance to hear=20

the latest theatrical gossip, and incidentally to try and get hold of ticke=
ts for the first night of some=20

new play or for a benefit performance. From the actress's she had to go to =
some artist's studio or=20

to some exhibition or to see some celebrity--either to pay a visit or to gi=
ve an invitation or simply to=20

have a chat. And everywhere she met with a gay and friendly welcome, and wa=
s assured that she=20

was good, that she was sweet, that she was rare.... Those whom she called g=
reat and famous=20

received her as one of themselves, as an equal, and predicted with one voic=
e that, with her=20

talents, her taste, and her intelligence, she would do great things if she =
concentrated herself. She=20

sang, she played the piano, she painted in oils, she carved, she took part =
in amateur=20

performances; and all this not just anyhow, but all with talent, whether sh=
e made lanterns for an=20

illumination or dressed up or tied somebody's cravat--everything she did wa=
s exceptionally=20

graceful, artistic, and charming. But her talents showed themselves in noth=
ing so clearly as in her=20

faculty for quickly becoming acquainted and on intimate terms with celebrat=
ed people. No sooner=20

did any one become ever so little celebrated, and set people talking about =
him, than she made his=20

acquaintance, got on friendly terms the same day, and invited him to her ho=
use. Every new=20

acquaintance she made was a veritable fete for her. She adored celebrated p=
eople, was proud of=20

them, dreamed of them every night. She craved for them, and never could sat=
isfy her craving. The=20

old ones departed and were forgotten, new ones came to replace them, but to=
 these, too, she=20

soon grew accustomed or was disappointed in them, and began eagerly seeking=
 for fresh great=20

men, finding them and seeking for them again. What for?  Between four and f=
ive she dined at=20

home with her husband. His simplicity, good sense, and kind-heartedness tou=
ched her and moved=20

her up to enthusiasm. She was constantly jumping up, impulsively hugging hi=
s head and=20

showering kisses on it.  "You are a clever, generous man, Dymov," she used =
to say, "but you have=20

one very serious defect. You take absolutely no interest in art. You don't =
believe in music or=20

painting."  "I don't understand them," he would say mildly. "I have spent a=
ll my life in working at=20



natural science and medicine, and I have never had time to take an interest=
 in the arts."  "But, you=20

know, that's awful, Dymov!"  "Why so? Your friends don't know anything of s=
cience or medicine,=20

but you don't reproach them with it. Every one has his own line. I don't un=
derstand landscapes and=20

operas, but the way I look at it is that if one set of sensible people devo=
te their whole lives to them,=20

and other sensible people pay immense sums for them, they must be of use. I=
 don't understand=20

them, but not understanding does not imply disbelieving in them."  "Let me =
shake your honest=20

hand!"  After dinner Olga Ivanovna would drive off to see her friends, then=
 to a theatre or to a=20

concert, and she returned home after midnight. So it was every day.  On Wed=
nesdays she had "At=20

Homes." At these "At Homes" the hostess and her guests did not play cards a=
nd did not dance,=20

but entertained themselves with various arts. An actor from the Dramatic Th=
eatre recited, a singer=20

sang, artists sketched in the albums of which Olga Ivanovna had a great num=
ber, the violoncellist=20

played, and the hostess herself sketched, carved, sang, and played accompan=
iments. In the=20

intervals between the recitations, music, and singing, they talked and argu=
ed about literature, the=20

theatre, and painting. There were no ladies, for Olga Ivanovna considered a=
ll ladies wearisome=20

and vulgar except actresses and her dressmaker. Not one of these entertainm=
ents passed without=20

the hostess starting at every ring at the bell, and saying, with a triumpha=
nt expression, "It is he,"=20

meaning by "he," of course, some new celebrity. Dymov was not in the drawin=
g-room, and no one=20

remembered his existence. But exactly at half-past eleven the door leading =
into the dining-room=20

opened, and Dymov would appear with his good-natured, gentle smile and say,=
 rubbing his hands:=20

"Come to supper, gentlemen."  They all went into the dining-room, and every=
 time found on the=20

table exactly the same things: a dish of oysters, a piece of ham or veal, s=
ardines, cheese, caviare,=20

mushrooms, vodka, and two decanters of wine.  "My dear _maitre d' hotel!_" =
Olga Ivanovna would=20

say, clasping her hands with enthusiasm, "you are simply fascinating! My fr=
iends, look at his=20

forehead! Dymov, turn your profile. Look! he has the face of a Bengal tiger=
 and an expression as=20

kind and sweet as a gazelle. Ah, the darling!"  The visitors ate, and, look=
ing at Dymov, thought,=20

"He really is a nice fellow"; but they soon forgot about him, and went on t=
alking about the theatre,=20

music, and painting.  The young people were happy, and their life flowed on=
 without a hitch.  The=20

third week of their honeymoon was spent, however, not quite happily--sadly,=
 indeed. Dymov=20

caught erysipelas in the hospital, was in bed for six days, and had to have=
 his beautiful black hair=20

cropped. Olga Ivanovna=20


_
view of the pronaos of the temple of Augustus (which is built at the middle=
 of the side wall of the=20

basilica, facing the middle of the forum and the temple of Jupiter) and als=
o the tribunal which is in=20

the former temple, shaped as a hemicycle whose curvature is less than a sem=
icircle.  [Illustration:=20

VITRUVIUS' BASILICA AT FANO]  8. The open side of this hemicycle is forty-s=
ix feet along the=20

front, and its curvature inwards is fifteen feet, so that those who are sta=
nding before the=20

magistrates may not be in the way of the business men in the basilica. Roun=
d about, above the=20

columns, are placed the architraves, consisting of three two-foot timbers f=
astened together. These=20

return from the columns which stand third on the inner side to the antae wh=
ich project from the=20

pronaos, and which touch the edges of the hemicycle at right and left.  9. =
Above the architraves=20

and regularly dispersed on supports directly over the capitals, piers are p=
laced, three feet high and=20

four feet broad each way. Above them is placed the projecting cornice round=
 about, made of two=20

two-foot timbers. The tie-beams and struts, being placed above them, and di=
rectly over the shafts=20

of the columns and the antae and walls of the pronaos, hold up one gable ro=
of along the entire=20

basilica, and another from the middle of it, over the pronaos of the temple=
.  10. Thus the gable=20

tops run in two directions, like the letter T, and give a beautiful effect =
to the outside and inside of=20

the main roof. Further, by the omission of an ornamental entablature and of=
 a line of screens and a=20

second tier of columns, troublesome labour is saved and the total cost grea=
tly diminished. On the=20

other hand, the carrying of the columns themselves in unbroken height direc=
tly up to the beams=20

that support the main roof, seems to add an air of sumptuousness and dignit=
y to the work.=20

CHAPTER II  THE TREASURY, PRISON, AND SENATE HOUSE   1. The treasury, priso=
n, and=20

senate house ought to adjoin the forum, but in such a way that their dimens=
ions may be=20

proportionate to those of the forum. Particularly, the senate house should =
be constructed with=20

special regard to the importance of the town or city. If the building is sq=
uare, let its height be fixed=20

at one and one half times its breadth; but if it is to be oblong, add toget=
her its length and breadth=20

and, having got the total, let half of it be devoted to the height up to th=
e coffered ceiling.  2.=20

Further, the inside walls should be girdled, at a point halfway up their he=
ight, with coronae made of=20

woodwork or of stucco. Without these, the voice of men engaged in discussio=
n there will be=20

carried up to the height above, and so be unintelligible to their listeners=
. But when the walls are=20

girdled with coronae, the voice from below, being detained before rising an=
d becoming lost in the=20

air, will be intelligible to the ear.     CHAPTER III  THE THEATRE: ITS SIT=
E, FOUNDATIONS AND=20

ACOUSTICS   1. After the forum has been arranged, next, for the purpose of =
seeing plays or=20

festivals of the immortal gods, a site as healthy as possible should be sel=
ected for the theatre, in=20

accordance with what has been written in the first book, on the principles =
of healthfulness in the=20

sites of cities. For when plays are given, the spectators, with their wives=
 and children, sit through=20

them spell-bound, and their bodies, motionless from enjoyment, have the por=
es open, into which=20

blowing winds find their way. If these winds come from marshy districts or =
from other=20

unwholesome quarters, they will introduce noxious exhalations into the syst=
em. Hence, such faults=20

will be avoided if the site of the theatre is somewhat carefully selected. =
 2. We must also beware=20

that it has not a southern exposure. When the sun shines full upon the roun=
ded part of it, the air,=20

being shut up in the curved enclosure and unable to circulate, stays there =
and becomes heated;=20

and getting glowing hot it burns up, dries out, and impairs the fluids of t=
he human body. For these=20

reasons, sites which are unwholesome in such respects are to be avoided, an=
d healthy sites=20



selected.  3. The foundation walls will be an easier matter if they are on =
a hillside; but if they have=20

to be laid on a plain or in a marshy place, solidity must be assured and su=
bstructures built in=20

accordance with what has been written in the third book, on the foundations=
 of temples. Above the=20

foundation walls, the ascending rows of seats, from the substructures up, s=
hould be built of stone=20

and marble materials.  4. The curved cross-aisles should be constructed in =
proportionate relation,=20

it is thought, to the height of the theatre, but not higher than the footwa=
y of the passage is broad. If=20

they are loftier, they will throw back the voice and drive it away from the=
 upper portion, thus=20

preventing the case-endings of words from reaching with distinct meaning th=
e ears of those who=20

are in the uppermost seats above the cross-aisles. In short, it should be s=
o contrived that a line=20

drawn from the lowest to the highest seat will touch the top edges and angl=
es of all the seats.=20

Thus the voice will meet with no obstruction.  5. The different entrances o=
ught to be numerous and=20

spacious, the upper not connected with the lower, but built in a continuous=
 straight line from all=20

parts of the house, without turnings, so that the people may not be crowded=
 together when let out=20

from shows, but may have separate exits from all parts without obstructions=
.  Particular pains must=20

also be taken that the site be not a "deaf" one, but one through which the =
voice can range with the=20

greatest clearness. This can be brought about if a site is selected where t=
here is no obstruction=20

due to echo.  6. Voice is a flowing breath of air, perceptible to the heari=
ng by contact. It moves in=20

an endless number of circular rounds, like the innumerably increasing circu=
lar waves which appear=20

when a stone is thrown into smooth water, and which keep on spreading indef=
initely from the=20

centre unless interrupted by narrow limits, or by some obstruction which pr=
events such waves=20

from reaching their end in due formation. When they are interrupted by obst=
ructions, the first=20

waves, flowing back, break up the formation of those which follow.  7. In t=
he same manner the=20

voice executes its movements in concentric circles; but while in the case o=
f water the circles move=20

horizontally on a plane surface, the voice not put a white handkerchief on =
his shaven head and=20

began to paint him as a Bedouin. And they were both in good spirits. Three =
days after he had=20

begun to go back to the hospital he had another mischance.  "I have no luck=
, little mother," he said=20

one day at dinner. "I had four dissections to do today, and I cut two of my=
 fingers at one. And I did=20

not notice it till I got home."  Olga Ivanovna was alarmed. He smiled, and =
told her that it did not=20

matter, and that he often cut his hands when he was dissecting.  "I get abs=
orbed, little mother, and=20

grow careless."  Olga Ivanovna dreaded symptoms of blood-poisoning, and pra=
yed about it every=20

night, but all went well. And again life flowed on peaceful and happy, free=
 from grief and anxiety.=20

The present was happy, and to follow it spring was at hand, already smiling=
 in the distance, and=20

promising a thousand delights. There would be no end to their happiness. In=
 April, May and June a=20

summer villa a good distance out of town; walks, sketching, fishing, nighti=
ngales; and then from=20

July right on to autumn an artist's tour on the Volga, and in this tour Olg=
a Ivanovna would take part=20

as an indispensable member of the society. She had already had made for her=
 two travelling=20

dresses of linen, had bought paints, brushes, canvases, and a new palette f=
or the journey. Almost=20

every day Ryabovsky visited her to see what progress she was making in her =
painting; when she=20

showed him her painting, he used to thrust his hands deep into his pockets,=
 compress his lips,=20

sniff, and say:  "Ye--es...! That cloud of yours is screaming: it's not in =
the evening light. The=20

foreground is somehow chewed up, and there is something, you know, not the =
thing.... And your=20

cottage is weighed down and whines pitifully. That corner ought to have bee=
n taken more in=20



shadow, but on the whole it is not bad; I like it."  And the more incompreh=
ensible he talked, the=20

more readily Olga Ivanovna understood him.  III  After dinner on the second=
 day of Trinity week,=20

Dymov bought some sweets and some savouries and went down to the villa to s=
ee his wife. He=20

had not seen her for a fortnight, and missed her terribly. As he sat in the=
 train and afterwards as=20

he looked for his villa in a big wood, he felt all the while hungry and wea=
ry, and dreamed of how he=20

would have supper in freedom with his wife, then tumble into bed and to sle=
ep. And he was=20

delighted as he looked at his parcel, in which there was caviare, cheese, a=
nd white salmon.  The=20

sun was setting by the time he found his villa and recognized it. The old s=
ervant told him that her=20

mistress was not at home, but that most likely she would soon be in. The vi=
lla, very uninviting in=20

appearance, with low ceilings papered with writing-paper and with uneven fl=
oors full of crevices,=20

consisted only of three rooms. In one there was a bed, in the second there =
were canvases,=20

brushes, greasy papers, and men's overcoats and hats lying about on the cha=
irs and in the=20

windows, while in the third Dymov found three unknown men; two were dark-ha=
ired and had=20

beards, the other was clean-shaven and fat, apparently an actor. There was =
a samovar boiling on=20

the table.  "What do you want?" asked the actor in a bass voice, looking at=
 Dymov ungraciously.=20

"Do you want Olga Ivanovna? Wait a minute; she will be here directly."  Dym=
ov sat down and=20

waited. One of the dark-haired men, looking sleepily and listlessly at him,=
 poured himself out a=20

glass of tea, and asked:  "Perhaps you would like some tea?"  Dymov was bot=
h hungry and thirsty,=20

but he refused tea for fear of spoiling his supper. Soon he heard footsteps=
 and a familiar laugh; a=20

door slammed, and Olga Ivanovna ran into the room, wearing a wide-brimmed h=
at and carrying a=20

box in her hand; she was followed by Ryabovsky, rosy and good-humoured, car=
rying a big=20

umbrella and a camp-stool.  "Dymov!" cried Olga Ivanovna, and she flushed c=
rimson with=20

pleasure. "Dymov!" she repeated, laying her head and both arms on his bosom=
. "Is that you? Why=20

haven't you come for so long? Why? Why?"  "When could I, little mother? I a=
m always busy, and=20

whenever I am free it always happens somehow that the train does not fit." =
 "But how glad I am to=20

see you! I have been dreaming about you the whole night, the whole night, a=
nd I was afraid you=20

must be ill. Ah! if you only knew how sweet you are! You have come in the n=
ick of time! You will be=20

my salvation! You are the only person who can save me! There is to be a mos=
t original wedding=20

here tomorrow," she went on, laughing, and tying her husband's cravat. "A y=
oung telegraph clerk=20

at the station, called Tchikeldyeev, is going to be married. He is a handso=
me young man and--

well, not stupid, and you know there is something strong, bearlike in his f=
ace... you might paint him=20

as a young Norman. We summer visitors take a great interest in him, and hav=
e promised to be at=20

his wedding.... He is a lonely, timid man, not well off, and of course it w=
ould be a shame not to be=20

sympathetic to him. Fancy! the wedding will be after the service; then we s=
hall all walk from the=20

church to the bride's lodgings... you see the wood, the birds singing, patc=
hes of sunlight on the=20

grass, and all of us spots of different colours against the bright green ba=
ckground--very original, in=20

the style of the French impressionists. But, Dymov, what am I to go to the =
church in?" said Olga=20

Ivanovna, and she looked as though she were going to cry. "I have nothing h=
ere, literally nothing!=20

no dress, no flowers, no gloves... you must save me. Since you have come, f=
ate itself bids you=20

save me. Take the keys, my precious, go home and get my pink dress from the=
 wardrobe. You=20

remember it; it hangs in front.... Then, in the storeroom, on the floor, on=
 the right side, you will see=20

two cardboard boxes. When you open the top one you will see tulle, heaps of=
 tulle and rags of all=20



sorts, and under them flowers. Take out all the flowers carefully, try not =
to crush them, darling; I=20

will choose among them later.... And buy me some gloves."  "Very well," sai=
d Dymov; "I will go=20

tomorrow and send them to you."  "Tomorrow?" asked Olga Ivanovna, and she l=
ooked at him=20

surprised. "You won't have time tomorrow. The first train goes tomorrow at =
nine, and the=20

wedding's at eleven. No, darling, it must be today; it absolutely must be t=
oday. If you won't be able=20

to come tomorrow, send them by a messenger. Come, you must run=20


_
ascends vertically by regular stages. Therefore, as in the case of the wave=
s formed in the water,=20

so it is in the case of the voice: the first wave, when there is no obstruc=
tion to interrupt it, does not=20

break up the second or the following waves, but they all reach the ears of =
the lowest and highest=20

spectators without an echo.  8. Hence the ancient architects, following in =
the footsteps of nature,=20

perfected the ascending rows of seats in theatres from their investigations=
 of the ascending voice,=20

and, by means of the canonical theory of the mathematicians and that of the=
 musicians,=20

endeavoured to make every voice uttered on the stage come with greater clea=
rness and=20

sweetness to the ears of the audience. For just as musical instruments are =
brought to perfection of=20

clearness in the sound of their strings by means of bronze plates or horn [=
Greek: echeia], so the=20

ancients devised methods of increasing the power of the voice in theatres t=
hrough the application=20

of harmonics.     CHAPTER IV  HARMONICS   1. Harmonics is an obscure and di=
fficult branch of=20

musical science, especially for those who do not know Greek. If we desire t=
o treat of it, we must=20

use Greek words, because some of them have no Latin equivalents. Hence, I w=
ill explain it as=20

clearly as I can from the writings of Aristoxenus, append his scheme, and d=
efine the boundaries of=20

the notes, so that with somewhat careful attention anybody may be able to u=
nderstand it pretty=20

easily.  2. The voice, in its changes of position when shifting pitch, beco=
mes sometimes high,=20

sometimes low, and its movements are of two kinds, in one of which its prog=
ress is continuous, in=20

the other by intervals. The continuous voice does not become stationary at =
the "boundaries" or at=20

any definite place, and so the extremities of its progress are not apparent=
, but the fact that there=20

are differences of pitch is apparent, as in our ordinary speech in _sol_, _=
lux_, _flos_, _vox_; for in=20

these cases we cannot tell at what pitch the voice begins, nor at what pitc=
h it leaves off, but the=20

fact that it becomes low from high and high from low is apparent to the ear=
. In its progress by=20

intervals the opposite is the case. For here, when the pitch shifts, the vo=
ice, by change of position,=20

stations itself on one pitch, then on another, and, as it frequently repeat=
s this alternating process, it=20

appears to the senses to become stationary, as happens in singing when we p=
roduce a variation=20

of the mode by directly; don't miss it, darling."  "Very well."  "Oh, how s=
orry I am to let you go!" said=20

Olga Ivanovna, and tears came into her eyes. "And why did I promise that te=
legraph clerk, like a=20

silly?"  Dymov hurriedly drank a glass of tea, took a cracknel, and, smilin=
g gently, went to the=20

station. And the caviare, the cheese, and the white salmon were eaten by th=
e two dark gentlemen=20

and the fat actor.  IV  On a still moonlight night in July Olga Ivanovna wa=
s standing on the deck of=20

a Volga steamer and looking alternately at the water and at the picturesque=
 banks. Beside her was=20

standing Ryabovsky, telling her the black shadows on the water were not sha=
dows, but a dream,=20

that it would be sweet to sink into forgetfulness, to die, to become a memo=
ry in the sight of that=20

enchanted water with the fantastic glimmer, in sight of the fathomless sky =
and the mournful,=20

dreamy shores that told of the vanity of our life and of the existence of s=
omething higher, blessed,=20

and eternal. The past was vulgar and uninteresting, the future was trivial,=
 and that marvellous=20

night, unique in a lifetime, would soon be over, would blend with eternity;=
 then, why live?  And=20

Olga Ivanovna listened alternately to Ryabovsky's voice and the silence of =
the night, and thought=20

of her being immortal and never dying. The turquoise colour of the water, s=
uch as she had never=20

seen before, the sky, the river-banks, the black shadows, and the unaccount=
able joy that flooded=20

her soul, all told her that she would make a great artist, and that somewhe=
re in the distance, in the=20

infinite space beyond the moonlight, success, glory, the love of the people=
, lay awaiting her....=20



When she gazed steadily without blinking into the distance, she seemed to s=
ee crowds of people,=20

lights, triumphant strains of music, cries of enthusiasm, she herself in a =
white dress, and flowers=20

showered upon her from all sides. She thought, too, that beside her, leanin=
g with his elbows on=20

the rail of the steamer, there was standing a real great man, a genius, one=
 of God's elect.... All that=20

he had created up to the present was fine, new, and extraordinary, but what=
 he would create in=20

time, when with maturity his rare talent reached its full development, woul=
d be astounding,=20

immeasurably sublime; and that could be seen by his face, by his manner of =
expressing himself=20

and his attitude to nature. He talked of shadows, of the tones of evening, =
of the moonlight, in a=20

special way, in a language of his=20


_
intervals, the points at which it begins and where it leaves off are obviou=
sly apparent in the=20

boundaries of the notes, but the intermediate points escape notice and are =
obscure, owing to the=20

intervals.  3. There are three classes of modes: first, that which the Gree=
ks term the enharmonic;=20

second, the chromatic; third, the diatonic. The enharmonic mode is an artis=
tic conception, and=20

therefore execution in it has a specially severe dignity and distinction. T=
he chromatic, with its=20

delicate subtlety and with the "crowding" of its notes, gives a sweeter kin=
d of pleasure. In the=20

diatonic, the distance between the intervals is easier to understand, becau=
se it is natural. These=20

three classes differ in their arrangement of the tetrachord. In the enharmo=
nic, the tetrachord=20

consists of two tones and two "dieses." A diesis is a quarter tone; hence i=
n a semitone there are=20

included two dieses. In the chromatic there are two semitones arranged in s=
uccession, and the=20

third interval is a tone and a half. In the diatonic, there are two consecu=
tive tones, and the third=20

interval of a semitone completes the tetrachord. Hence, in the three classe=
s, the tetrachords are=20

equally composed of two tones and a semitone, but when they are regarded se=
parately according=20

to the terms of each class, they differ in the arrangement of their interva=
ls.  4. Now then, these=20

intervals of tones and semitones of the tetrachord are a division introduce=
d by nature in the case=20

of the feeling the fascination of his power over nature. He was very handso=
me, original, and his=20

life, free, independent, aloof from all common cares, was like the life of =
a bird.  "It's growing=20

cooler," said Olga Ivanovna, and she gave a shudder.  Ryabovsky wrapped her=
 in his cloak, and=20

said mournfully:  "I feel that I am in your power; I am a slave. Why are yo=
u so enchanting today?"=20

He kept staring intently at her, and his eyes were terrible. And she was af=
raid to look at him.  "I=20

love you madly," he whispered, breathing on her cheek. "Say one word to me =
and I will not go on=20

living; I will give up art..." he muttered in violent emotion. "Love me, lo=
ve...."  "Don't talk like that,"=20

said Olga Ivanovna, covering her eyes. "It's dreadful! How about Dymov?"  "=
What of Dymov? Why=20

Dymov? What have I to do with Dymov? The Volga, the moon, beauty, my love, =
ecstasy, and=20

there is no such thing as Dymov.... Ah! I don't know... I don't care about =
the past; give me one=20

moment, one instant!"  Olga Ivanovna's heart began to throb. She tried to t=
hink about her=20

husband, but all her past, with her wedding, with Dymov, and with her "At H=
omes," seemed to her=20

petty, trivial, dingy, unnecessary, and far, far away.... Yes, really, what=
 of Dymov? Why Dymov?=20

What had she to do with Dymov? Had he any existence in nature, or was he on=
ly a dream?  "For=20

him, a simple and ordinary man the happiness he has had already is enough,"=
 she thought,=20

covering her face with her hands.=20


_
has defined their limits by measures according to the magnitude of the inte=
rvals, and determined=20

their characteristics in certain different ways. These natural laws are fol=
lowed by the skilled=20

workmen who fashion musical instruments, in bringing them to the perfection=
 of their proper=20

concords.  [Illustration]  5. In each class there are eighteen notes, terme=
d in Greek [Greek:=20

phthongoi], of which eight in all the three condemn me, let them curse me, =
but in spite of them all I=20

will go to my ruin; I will go to my ruin!... One must experience everything=
 in life. My God! how=20

terrible and how glorious!"  "Well? Well?" muttered the artist, embracing h=
er, and greedily kissing=20

the hands with which she feebly tried to thrust him from her. "You love me?=
 Yes? Yes? Oh, what a=20

night! marvellous night!"  "Yes, what a night!" she whispered, looking=20
