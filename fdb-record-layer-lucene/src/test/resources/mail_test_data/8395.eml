"Kultur."                    -------------------------------------  My section has been ordered up to a divisional 

area on the south of the salient. In accordance with instructions I went up to Ypres this morning to 

find a place to park the machines.  Contrary to the popular belief, we do not fight our guns from the 

motor cycles themselves. We use our machines to get about on, and the guns are taken up as 

near as possible to the position we are to occupy, which is usually behind Brigade Headquarters. 

Brigadiers have a great aversion to any kind of motor vehicle being driven past their headquarters, 

owing to the movement and noise, which they believe attracts attention to themselves, and as a 

rule the sentries posted outside will see that no machines go by. We get up as far as we can, 

because after we part from our machines, everything must be carried up through the be only a 

repetition of your own description of the same operation at the Cornwall mines. The coal is raised 

in a box, called by the miners a _cowe_. These cowes contain about two bushels each, and two of 

them are alternately rising and descending in each shaft. They are raised by means of ropes, 

fastened to a simple wheel and crank, which is turned by mules. In sinking their shafts, they cut, in 

the first place, perpendicularly (i. e. to the surface of the earth) through the coal, to its lower 

surface; and then turning westwardly, they open a horizontal gallery through the inclination of the 

vein, to its upper surface; by this means, to use their own terms, "gaining a double cut on it." Their 

principal gallery passes (in the direction of the vein,) by the mouth of each shaft. Its length is 1350 

feet, and it is terminated at each end by a hitch or dyke of hard

[Illustration]                       Bringing Up A Motor Machine Gun   I arrived at the town early and 

reported to the major who is in charge of the town and of the troops quartered there. He was living 

in the prison, a substantial brick and stone building, which has been smashed about a bit, but 

which is still a fairly good structure. The major is rubbish in such a manner as to prevent me from 

seeing the stone myself, and the gentleman who escorted me through the mines is my authority 

for its being sandstone; he might possibly, however, have been mistaken, as it is difficult to 

ascertain what a stone is, in such a place, until it is broken.) When I was at the pits, they were 

preparing to blast through this rock. At right
