"He is stone dead," said the surgeon.  There was a solemn silence.  "Save y=
ourselves,=20

gentlemen," at length cried De Kerguel. "I will see to my unfortunate frien=
d. It was his own fault=20

and _mine_," he said with a sigh.  The Englishmen saluted. Haggard resumed =
his garments, and=20

they hurried from the field, unobserved and unmolested.  Next morning Rome =
rang with the affair;=20

by noon all three Englishmen were safely over the frontier.       CHAPTER X=
II.    THE VILLA=20

LAMBERT.   Twenty-four hours at a Genevese hotel were got through by Georgi=
e and her cousin=20

without difficulty.  "I do think," said Lucy, "that Reginald might have bro=
ught us here himself. I=20

confess that a _tete-a-tete_ of two women is dull; when they are almost sis=
ters, as a rule it's duller=20

still; though the dulness is frequently enlivened by a pitched battle. Geor=
gie, why are you not of a=20

pugnacious disposition? My fingers literally itch to box some one's ears; a=
s for Hephzibah, I've no=20

patience with her."  "I noticed that you had set her crying again, Lucy, fo=
r about the tenth time to-

day."  "And serve her right, she's over head and ears in love with that pri=
celess jewel, your=20

husband's man; it's as plain as the nose on her face, and there's no doubt =
of the plainness of that.=20

I know the symptoms, they are unmistakable: they always are, among the mini=
stering classes. He=20

was Capt before, now it's 'Mr. Capt' here and 'Mr. Capt' there. Mistering i=
s always the first sign,=20

Georgie. No, I've no patience with her at all. It appears he gave her a the=
rmometer about a week=20

ago; she has carried this thing about in her pocket ever since; the mercury=
 has got separated, and=20

she passes her whole time in weeping and shaking the horrid thing, and tryi=
ng to get it back again.=20

Now I ask you, Georgie, just look at her."  A mirror, turned towards an ope=
n door, disclosed the=20

lovelorn Hephzibah in the next room. Her proceedings were sufficiently grot=
esque. In her hand she=20

held a small ornamental thermometer; she would shake it violently in the ai=
r, she would then=20

regard it intently with a puzzled expression, then she would shake her head=
 and proceed to=20

furiously agitate it once more. Failing in her purpose, she wept bitterly. =
 Good-natured as Georgina=20

was, she could not resist a smile.  "Hephzibah, you fool, come here," cried=
 Lucy.  The maid at=20

once secreted the thermometer in her bosom.  "Why do you hide the nasty thi=
ng?" said Lucy.=20

"Oh, miss, I'm ashamed."  "And what are you crying for?"  "Please, miss, be=
cause of the omen."=20

"What do you mean?" said Georgina; "do calm yourself, Hephzibah."  "Oh, mis=
s, only look," of the=20

old English residence extant. It was the perfection of the style, which had=
 gradually arisen after the=20

Wars of the Roses had alike destroyed all the castles and the purpose of th=
ose stern erections.=20

People said Vauxe looked like a college: the truth is, colleges looked like=
 Vauxe, for, when those=20

fair and civil buildings rose, the wise and liberal spirits who endowed the=
m intended that they=20

should resemble, as much as possible, the residence of a great noble.  Ther=
e were two=20

quadrangles at Vauxe of gray-stone; the outer one of larger dimensions and =
much covered with=20

ivy; the inner one not so extensive, but more ornate, with a lofty tower, a=
 hall, and a chapel. The=20

house was full of galleries, and they were full of portraits. Indeed there =
was scarcely a chamber in=20

this vast edifice of which the walls were not breathing with English histor=
y in this interesting form.=20

Sometimes more ideal art asserted a triumphant claim=E2=80=94transcendental=
 Holy Families, seraphic=20

saints, and gorgeous scenes by Tintoret and Paul of Verona.  The furniture =
of the house seemed=20

never to have been changed. It was very old, somewhat scanty, but very rich=
=E2=80=94tapestry and velvet=20

hangings, marvellous cabinets, and crystal girandoles. Here and there a gro=
up of ancient plate;=20

ewers and flagons and tall salt-cellars, a foot high and richly chiselled; =
sometimes a state bed=20

shadowed with a huge pomp of stiff brocade and borne by silver poles.  Vaux=
e stood in a large=20



park, studded with stately trees; here and there an avenue of Spanish chest=
nuts or a grove of=20

oaks; sometimes a gorsy dell, and sometimes a so great spread of antlered f=
ern, taller than the=20

tallest man.  It was only twenty miles from town, and Lord St. Jerome drove=
 Lothair down; the last=20

ten miles through a pretty land, which, at the right season, would have bee=
n bright with orchards,=20

oak-woods, and hop-gardens. Lord St. Jerome loved horses, and was an eminen=
t whip. He had=20

driven four-in-hand when a boy, and he went on driving four-in-hand; not be=
cause it was the=20

fashion, but because he loved it. Toward the close of Lent, Lady St. Jerome=
 and Clare Arundel=20

had been at a convent in retreat, but they always passed Holy Week at home,=
 and they were to=20

welcome Lord St. Jerome again at Vauxe.  The day was bright, the mode of mo=
vement=20

exhilarating, all the anticipated incidents delightful, and Lothair felt th=
e happiness of health and=20

youth.  =E2=80=9CThere is Vauxe,=E2=80=9D said Lord St. Jerome, in a tone o=
f proud humility, as a turn in the road=20

first displayed the stately pile.  =E2=80=9CHow beautiful!=E2=80=9D said Lo=
thair. =E2=80=9CAh! our ancestors understood the=20

country.=E2=80=9D=20


_
love-token from its hiding place; "the quicksilver have separated, never to=
 be re-united, and isn't=20

that an omen, miss?" Here the maid shook the thermometer with redoubled fur=
y.  "You stupid=20

creature, so you believe in all that nonsense, do you?"  "I may be stupid, =
Miss Lucy, but I've never=20

known a sign or omen fail. Didn't the cook at The Warren, miss, predict, wi=
th coffee grounds, that I=20

should be engaged to a foreign gentleman, but that some one younger and mor=
e beautiful would=20

prove a jealous rival? Here I am engaged, miss, or as good, to Mr. Capt; an=
d I know what this=20

omen means. You may laugh, miss, but it's a very serious thing."  "I should=
n't wonder at all,=20

Hephzibah; the hotel prospectus says there are no less than fifty chamberma=
ids here. Perhaps=20

even fifty jealous rivals."  "Mr. Capt don't demean himself to chambermaids=
, Miss Lucy," retorted=20

the abigail with angry scorn.  "Oh, I've no doubt Capt is ambitious; perhap=
s he looks higher.=20

Perhaps I shall be your rival, Hephzibah."  "You wouldn't have the heart to=
 do it, miss," said the girl=20

in all seriousness.  Mrs. Haggard gave her cousin a reproving glance, but L=
ucy imperturbably=20

continued:  "Well, Hephzibah," she said, "I think you may consider yourself=
 safe from me, at least;=20

but I'll help you if you'll let me."  Ladies don't wink, they only impercep=
tibly droop their eyelids, but=20

the glance that Lucy gave her cousin was terribly like a wink, and brimming=
 over with malice.=20

"Yes," she went on. "Light that candle, you stupid creature; now hold your =
thermometer close to=20

the flame; we shall soon see what the omen is worth."  The maid did as she =
was bid, and carefully=20

watched the tube.  "Well, are the separated fates  =E2=80=9CI used to think=
 when I was a boy,=E2=80=9D said Lord St.=20

Jerome, =E2=80=9Cthat I lived in the prettiest village in the world; but th=
ese railroads have so changed every=20

thing that Vauxe seems to me now only a second town-house.=E2=80=9D  The la=
dies were in a garden,=20

where they were consulting with the gardener and Father Coleman about the s=
hape of some new=20

beds, for the critical hour of filling them was approaching. The gardener, =
like all head-gardeners,=20

was opinionated. Living always at Vauxe, he had come to believe that the ga=
rdens belonged to=20

him, and that the family were only occasional visitors; and he treated them=
 accordingly. The lively=20

and impetuous Lady St. Jerome had a thousand bright fancies, but her morose=
 attendant never=20

indulged them. She used to deplore his tyranny with piteous playfulness. =
=E2=80=9CI suppose,=E2=80=9D she would=20

say, =E2=80=9Cit is useless to resist, for I observe =E2=80=98tis the same =
everywhere. Lady Roehampton says she=20

never has her way with her gardens. It is no use speaking to Lord St. Jerom=
e, for, though he is=20

afraid of nothing else, I am sure he is afraid of Hawkins.=E2=80=9D  The on=
ly way that Lady St. Jerome could=20

manage Hawkins was through Father Coleman. Father Coleman, who knew every t=
hing, knew a=20

great deal about gardens; from the days of Le Notre to those of the fine ge=
ntlemen who now travel=20

about, and when disengaged deign to give us advice.  Father Coleman had onl=
y just entered=20

middle-age, was imperturbable and mild in his manner. He passed his life ve=
ry much at Vauxe,=20

and imparted a great deal of knowledge to Mr. Hawkins without apparently be=
ing conscious of so=20

doing. At the bottom of his mind, Mr. Hawkins felt assured that he had gain=
ed several=20

distinguished prizes, mainly through the=20


_
mistress with affected solicitude.  "Oh, miss, they are coming together gra=
dually, but very slowly,=20

miss."  "Get the thing nearer to the candle, then."  Poor Hephzibah obeyed;=
 she little suspected=20

the heartless trick played at her expense.  "Oh, miss," she delightedly exc=
laimed, "they'll join in=20

another instant."  Bang went the fragile bulb, as it splintered into a thou=
sand atoms, and the=20

mercury shot in sparkling globules over the table.  Lucy's ringing laugh re=
sounded through the=20

room.  But the matter was no joke to Hephzibah, her pale lips became colour=
less; she pressed her=20

hand to her heart with a gesture full of anguish, recovered herself with di=
fficulty, gave forth a few=20

short sharp sobs, cast an almost menacing look upon her younger mistress, t=
hen turned and=20

rushed from the room.  "How could you have the heart to tease her so?" said=
 Georgie with honest=20

indignation. "I'm ashamed of you, Lucy; you've no right to trifle with her =
feelings."  "Trifle with her=20

fiddlesticks," laughed the girl.  But a knock at the door interrupted them;=
 the discreet Capt entered,=20

bearing a telegram upon a salver.  Mrs. Haggard, to whom the envelope was a=
ddressed, tore it=20

open with some anxiety; her face assumed a pleased expression.  "Order a ca=
rriage at once,=20

Capt," she said.  The valet withdrew to execute the command.  The telegram =
was from Haggard; it=20

was as follows:      "_Spunyarn and I are on the road, and shall reach Gene=
va by last     train. You=20

had better go to the Villa Lambert and arrange for     taking up our quarte=
rs there, if surface, a little=20

surly, he was ruled by Father Coleman, under the combined influence of self=
-interest and superior=20

knowledge.  =E2=80=9CYou find us in a garden without flowers,=E2=80=9D said=
 Lady St. Jerome; =E2=80=9Cbut the sun, I think,=20

alway loves these golden yews.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThese are for you, dear u=
ncle,=E2=80=9D said Clare Arundel, as she gave=20

him a rich cluster of violets. =E2=80=9CJust now the woods are more fragran=
t than the gardens, and these=20

are the produce of our morning walk. I could have brought you some primrose=
s, but I do not like to=20

mix violets with any thing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThey say primroses make a ca=
pital salad,=E2=80=9D said Lord St. Jerome.=20

=E2=80=9CBarbarian!=E2=80=9D exclaimed Lady St. Jerome. =E2=80=9CI see you =
want luncheon; it must, be ready;=E2=80=9D and she=20

took Lothair=E2=80=99s arm. =E2=80=9CI will show you a portrait of one of y=
our ancestors,=E2=80=9D she said; =E2=80=9Che married an=20

Arundel.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 14 =E2=80=9CNow, you know,=E2=80=9D said La=
dy St. Jerome to Lothair in a hushed voice,=20

as they sat together in the evening, =E2=80=9Cyou are to be quite free here=
; to do exactly what you like; and=20

we shall follow our ways. If you like to have a clergyman of your own Churc=
h visit you while you=20

are with us, pray say so without the slightest scruple. We have an excellen=
t gentleman in this=20

parish; he often dines here; and I am sure he would be most happy to attend=
 you. I know that Holy=20

Week is not wholly disregarded by some of the Anglicans.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CIt is the anniversary of the greatest=20

event of time,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cand I should be sorry if any=
 of my Church did not entirely regard it,=20

though they may show that regard in a way different from your=20


_
well--H._"  Georgie handed the paper to her cousin, the latter clapped her =
hands with glee. In a=20

woman's life there is nothing more delightful than arranging a home, though=
 it be but a temporary=20

one.  The girls hurried to prepare for their drive. And Mrs. Haggard, after=
 attempting to  =E2=80=9CYes, yes,=E2=80=9D=20

murmured Lady St. Jerome; =E2=80=9Cthere should be no difference between ou=
r Churches, if things were=20

only properly understood. I would accept all who really bow to the name of =
Christ; they will come=20

to the Church at last; they must. It is the atheists alone, I fear, who are=
 now=20


_
accompany them.  With Capt on the box, the young wife and her cousin, and t=
heir still ruffled=20

attendant, started on the lovely drive along the margin of the lake for the=
 villa which Haggard had=20

secured, should it meet with their mutual approval, as a home for his wife =
and cousin during his=20

short projected necessary absence in America.  As seen from the lake the Vi=
lla Lambert, which=20

stood quite alone, gave one the idea of the place a poet would choose for h=
is meditations. The=20

villa and its terrace were built of white stone, but a large portion of the=
 walls was covered with ivy.=20

The house itself was embedded in a thickly-wooded garden where the trees we=
re just budding into=20

leaf. Privacy was evidently what had been aimed at in the arrangement of th=
e place. On looking at=20

it one would instinctively say, _here_ is rest. A large _porte cochere_, wh=
ich had evidently been=20

long unused, was the chief entrance to the place, and a small wicket, pierc=
ed by a grille, and=20

surmounted by a big bell in an iron cage, was the only other means of getti=
ng into the garden. The=20

active Capt descended, and seizing the substantial handle rang loudly. The =
bark of a dog was the=20

only answer, but after repeating the summons several times, the trap in the=
 wicket opened and=20

disclosed the surly face of an old Savoyard. The gifted Capt addressed the =
old man in numerous=20

dialects, but no answering smile of intelligence illuminated the sulky wood=
en face; the barred=20

aperture was closed with an angry slam, except the rock of St. Peter.=E2=80=
=9D  Miss Arundel crossed the=20

room, whispered something to her aunt, and touched her forehead with her li=
ps, and then left the=20

apartment.  =E2=80=9CWe must soon separate, I fear,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. =
Jerome; =E2=80=9Cwe have an office to-night of=20

great moment; the Tenebrae commence to-night. You have, I think, nothing li=
ke it; but you have=20

services throughout this week.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am sorry to say I have =
not attended them,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CI did at=20

Oxford; but I don=E2=80=99t know how it is, but in London there seems no re=
ligion. And yet, as you=20

sometimes say, religion is the great business of life; I sometimes begin to=
 think the only business.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CYes, yes,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome, with much interest, =E2=
=80=9Cif you believe that you are safe. I wish you=20

had a clergyman near you while you are here. See Mr. Claughton, if you like=
; I would; and, if you=20

do not, there is Father Coleman. I cannot convey to you how satisfactory co=
nversation is with him=20

on religious matters. He is the holiest of men, and yet he is a man of the =
world; he will not invite=20

you into any controversies. He will speak with you only on points on which =
we agree. You know=20

there are many points on which we agree?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHappily,=E2=80=
=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CAnd now about the office to-

night: tell me about these Tenebrae. Is there any thing in the Tenebrae why=
 I ought not to be=20

present?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo reason whatever; not a dogma which you do no=
t believe; not a ceremony of which=20

you cannot approve. There are Psalms, at the end of which a light on=20
