dracaena marginata  It was Paul Friche who had shouted. His position on the table was giving him a commanding view over the heads of the threatening, shouting, perspiring set up my dander.  `Now then,' says I, `haul taut the main brace!  Up wi' the t'gall'nt-s'ls an' sky-scrapers!  "England expects," etceterer!'  "Afore dracaena marginata  It was Paul Friche who had shouted. His position on the table was giving him a commanding view over the heads of the threatening, shouting, perspiring set up my dander.  `Now then,' says I, `haul taut the main brace!

was keeping me--a friend who assured me that my dear milor was watching over me ... he brought 

me to this place--and begged me not to be frightened ... but to wait patiently ... and I must wait, 

dear ... I must wait!"  She spoke rapidly in whispers and in short jerky sentences. M. le duc 

listened to her wide-eyed, a deep line of puzzlement between his brows. Sorrow, remorse, 

starvation, misery had in a measure numbed his mind. The thought of help, of hope, of friends 

could not penetrate into his brain.  "A message," he murmured inanely, "a message. No! no! my 

girl, you must trust no one.... Pierre Adet.... Pierre Adet is full of evil tricks--he will trap you ... he 

means to destroy us both ... he has brought you here so that you should be murdered by these 

ferocious devils."  "Impossible, father dear," she said, still striving to speak bravely. "We have both 

of us been all this while in the power of Pierre Adet; he could have had no object in bringing me 

here to-night."  But the father who had been an insentient tool in the schemes of that miserable 

intriguer, who had been the means of bringing his only child to this terrible and deadly pass--the 

man who had listened to the lying counsels and proposals of his own most bitter enemy, could 

only groan now in terror and in doubt.  "Who can probe the depths of that abominable villain's 

plans?" he murmured vaguely.  In the meanwhile the little group who had thought prudence the 

better part of valour had reached the door. The foremost man amongst them opened it and peered 

cautiously out into the darkness. He turned back to those behind him, put a finger to his lip and 

beckoned to them to follow him in silence.  "Yvonne, let us go!" whispered the duc, who had 

seized his daughter by the hand.  "But father...."  "Let us go!" he reiterated pitiably. "I shall die if we 

stay here!"  "It won't be for long, father dear," she entreated; "if milor should come with his friend, 

and find us gone, we should be endangering his life as well as our own."  "I don't believe it," he 

rejoined with the obstinacy of weakness. "I don't believe in your message ... how could milor or 

anyone come to your rescue, my child?... No one knows that you are here, in this hell in Nantes." 

Yvonne clung to him with the and maintenance, it would be on the whole better both for Elspie and 

himself that they should get married without delay, he resolved to take the important step, and, as 

old McKay remarked, have it over.  "You see, Taniel," said the old man, when the subject was 

again broached, "it iss of no use hangin' off an' on in this fashion. Moreover, this nasty stiff leg o' 

mine is so long of getting well that it may walk me off the face o' the earth altogether, an' I would 

not like to leave Elspie till this matter iss settled.  Tuncan also iss a little better just now, so what 

say you to have the weddin' the month after next?  Mr Sutherland will be back from the 

Whitehorse Plains by then, an' he can tie the knot tight enough--whatever.  Anyway, it iss clear 

that if we wait for a munister o' the Auld Kirk, we will hev to wait till doomsday.  What say you, 

Taniel?"  It need hardly be said that Dan had nothing whatever to say in objection to this scheme. 

It was therefore settled--under the proviso, of course, that Elspie had no objection.  Dan went off at 

once to see Elspie, and found that she had no objection, whereupon, after some conversation, 

etcetera, with which we will not weary the reader, he sought out his friend Fred Jenkins, to whom 

he communicated the good news, and treated him to a good many unanswerable reasons why 

young people should not delay marriage when there was any reasonable prospect of their getting 

on comfortably in life together.  The sailor agreed with effusive heartiness to all that he said, and 

Dan thought while he was speaking--orating--as one of the American settlers would have 

expressed it--that Jenkins wore a peculiar expression on his manly countenance.  Attributing it to 

unusual interest in the event, he continued--  "Now, Fred, I want you to be my best-man--" 



"Unpossible--quite unpossible," interrupted the seaman with a grave shake of the head.  "How--

impossible!"  "Ab-so-lutely unpossible."  "But why?  Explain yourself, Fred."  "'Cause it's only a 

bachelor as can be a best-man to a bachelor--ain't it?"  "I believe so, though I'm no authority in 

such matters; but surely that is a matter of no importance, for _you_ are a bachelor, you know." 

"True, that's what I am to-day, but I won't be that long, for I

terrified as any human creature could be and live, but terror had not altogether swept away her 

belief in that mysterious message, in that tall guide who had led her hither, in that scarlet device--

the five-petalled flower which stood for everything that was most gallant and most brave.  She 

desired with all her might to remain here--despite everything, despite the awful brawl that was 

raging round her and which sickened her, despite the horror of the whole thing--to remain here 

and to wait. She put her arms round her father: she dragged him back every time that he tried to to 

be married next month, so I won't be available, d'ee see, the month after."  "You--married!--to 

whom?" exclaimed Dan in amazement.  "Well, that's a point blank shot right between wind an' 

water. Hows'ever, I suppose I can't go wrong in tellin' you, Dan, for it's all settled, though not a 

soul knows about it except Little Bill, an' yourself, an' her brother."  "But I _don't_ know about it 

yet," returned Dan.  "Who is it?"  "A angel--pure an' unmixed--come straight down from heaven a-

purpus to marry poor, unedicated, sea-farin' Fred Jenkins, an' her terrestrial name is Elise

conquered his former debility. His attempts to get away became more and more determined and 

more and more febrile.  "Come, Yvonne! we must go!" he continued to murmur intermittently and 

with ever-growing obstinacy. "No one will notice us.... I heard the noise from my garret upstairs.... I 

crept down.... I knew no one would notice me.... Come--we must go ... now is our time."  "Father, 

dear, whither could we go? Once in the streets of Nantes what would happen to us?"  "We can 

find our way to the Loire!" he retorted almost brutally. He shook himself free from her restraining 

arms and gripped her firmly by the hand. He tried to drag her toward the door, whilst she still 

struggled to keep him back. He had just caught sight of the group of men and women at the front 

door: their  Dan laughed while he congratulated the modest seaman, and admitted the strength of 

his difficulty.  "D'you know, Fred, I've had a suspicion for some time past that you had a leaning in 

that direction?"  "So have I, Dan, had an uncommon strong suspicion for a very long time past, not 

only that I had a leanin' that way, but a regular list to port, an' now I'm fairly over on my beam-

ends!"  "But, surely, it must have come upon you very sudden at last," said Dan. "How was it?" 

"Sudden!  I should just think it did--like a white squall in the Mediterranean, or a hurricane in the 

China seas.  This is how it was. I'd bin cruisin' about her--off an' on--for a considerable time, tryin' 

to make up my mind to go into action, an' screwin' my courage up to the stickin' pint by

threshold and was still peering out into the darkness.  But the next moment they all came to a halt: 

what their leader had perceived through the darkness did not evidently quite satisfy him: he turned 

and held a whispered consultation with the others. M. le duc strove with all his might to join in with 

that group. He felt that in its wake would lie the road to freedom. He would have struck Yvonne for 

standing in the way of Jack-tars through fire an' smoke, shot and shell since the world began--

`England expects every man to do his dooty,'--`Never say die,'--`Hookey Bunkum,' an' such like. 

But it warn't no manner o' use, for I'm an' outrageous coward wi' the gals, Dan.  So, in a sort o' 

despair, I sailed away this very mornin' into the plantation at the futt o' your garden, intendin' to 

cool myself an' think over it, when, who should I see

"Father dear," she contrived finally to say to him, "if you go hence, you will go alone. Nothing will 

move me from here, because I know that milor will come."  "Curse you for your obstinacy," retorted 

the duc, "you jeopardise my life and yours."  Then suddenly from the angle of the room where 

wrangling and fighting were at their fiercest, there came a loud call:  "Look out, pere Lemoine, your 

aristos are running away. You are losing your last herself!  "Well, I changed my course at once; 

bore straight down on her, an' soon overhauled her, but the nearer I came the more did my 

courage run out, so I gradooally begun to take in sail an drop astarn.  At last I got savage, `You're 

a fool, Jenkins!' says I to myself.  `That's a fact!' says su'thin' inside o' me.  "Now, if that su'thin' 

had kep' quiet, I do believe that I'd have gone about-ship an' showed her my heels, but that 

su'thin',
