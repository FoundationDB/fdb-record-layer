THE PUMP OF CTESIBIUS   1. Next I must tell about the machine of Ctesibius,=
 which raises=20

water to a height. It is made of bronze, and has at the bottom a pair of cy=
linders set a little way=20

apart, and there is a pipe connected with each, the two running up, like th=
e prongs of a fork, side=20

by side to a vessel which is between the cylinders. In this vessel are valv=
es, accurately fitting over=20

the upper vents of the pipes, which stop up the ventholes, and keep what ha=
s been forced by=20

pressure into the vessel from going down again.  2. Over the vessel a cowl =
is adjusted, like an=20

inverted funnel, and fastened to the vessel by means of a wedge thrust thro=
ugh a staple, to=20

prevent it from being lifted off by the pressure of the water that is force=
d in. On top of this a pipe is=20

jointed, called the trumpet, which stands up vertically. Valves are inserte=
d in the cylinders, beneath=20

the lower vents of the pipes, and over the openings which are in the bottom=
s of the cylinders.  3.=20

Pistons smoothly turned, rubbed with oil, and inserted from above into the =
cylinders, work with=20

their rods and levers upon the air and water in the cylinders, and, as the =
valves stop up the=20

openings, force and drive the water, by repeated pressure and expansion, th=
rough the vents of the=20

pipes into the vessel, from which the cowl receives the inflated currents, =
and sends all the=20

household in which I was so loved and trusted. Would it be honourable? She =
would go away with=20

me, but where? Where could I take her? It would have been a different matte=
r if I had had a=20

beautiful, interesting life--if, for instance, I had been struggling for th=
e emancipation of my country,=20

or had been a celebrated man of science, an artist or a painter; but as it =
was it would mean taking=20

her from one everyday humdrum life to another as humdrum or perhaps more so=
. And how long=20

would our happiness last? What would happen to her in case I was ill, in ca=
se I died, or if we=20

simply grew cold to one another?  "And she apparently reasoned in the same =
way. She thought of=20

her husband, her children, and of her mother, who loved the husband like a =
son. If she abandoned=20

herself to her feelings she would have to lie, or else to tell the truth, a=
nd in her position either=20

would have been equally terrible and inconvenient. And she was tormented by=
 the question=20

whether her love would bring me happiness--would she not complicate my life=
, which, as it was,=20

was hard enough and full of all sorts of trouble? She fancied she was not y=
oung enough for me,=20

that she was not industrious nor energetic enough to begin a new life, and =
she often talked to her=20

husband of the importance of my marrying a girl of intelligence and merit w=
ho would be a capable=20

housewife and a help to me--and she would immediately add that it would be =
difficult to find such a=20

girl in the whole town.  "Meanwhile the years were passing. Anna Alexyevna =
already had two=20

 This, however, is not the=20

f various kinds are=20

Konstantinovitch had come, and hung on my neck; every one was overjoyed. Th=

 Every one looked on=20

me as a noble being. And grown-ups and children alike felt that a noble bei=

their rooms, and that gave a peculiar charm to their manner towards me, as =
