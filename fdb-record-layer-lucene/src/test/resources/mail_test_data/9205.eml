1917  Captain Keene has meal, and one meal is a long time digesting.  They =
are generally found=20

in meadows, pastures, and the edge of woods. They creep slovenly through th=
e grass, and if=20

surprised by the sight of man, they assume an erect and threatening posture=
, darting their tongue=20

and swelling their head; but they do not attack men, unless alarmed and str=
uck. They are=20

considered more dangerous than the rattlesnake, because they do not give no=
tice of their vicinity,=20

and lie concealed in the grass; but they are easily killed, when assuming t=
he threatening posture,=20

by a slight touch of a cane, spade, or any other instrument. The effects of=
 their bite is similar to=20

that of the rattlesnake, and cured in the same way, by the prompt applicati=
on of the _Aristolochia=20

having seen an account of a method of substituting a portion of quick lime =
for a part of the=20

if I had not superintended myself a number of the experiments.  "_Sunswick =

 of gunpowder. I made=20

upwards of fifty blasts in this manner, as well as several hundreds in the =
usual way, and can=20
