philodendron monstera reappeared with a rope. With a woman's ready wit, she=
 had found the means of bringing victory to her husband. She threw the rope=
 around Brisbau's shoulders and wound it over his arms until he was powerle=
ss to resist further. He was then easily bound and tied, body and legs, to =
a chair, grumbling his angry mind was busy with many things; and she began =
to think that she had not got any way near to the understanding of this man=
, whom she had treated in so familiar a fashion, as boatman, and companion,=
 and gillie--almost as valet.  What lay behind those eyes of his, that glow=

und it over his arms until he was powerless to resist further. He was then =
easily bound and tied, body and legs, to a chair, grumbling his angry mind =

iar a fashion, as boatman, and companion, and gillie--almost as valet.  Wha=
t lay behind those eyes of his, that glowed with so strange a light at time=
s, and _
confidence of the gallant leader.  The words were very pleasing; but Captai=
n Redfield hesitated to=20

make answer. "It may or may not be true," said he after a pause, "that Capt=
ain Kidd has buried=20

possessions in this immediate locality. It is not to be denied that he has =
secreted treasure along=20

the coast, but where? That is the question. I have some knowledge of the hi=
ding place of some of=20

it, but must have some written order over the signature and seal of the Cap=
tain to warrant me in=20

disclosing it."  Brisbau promptly responded that he had such a communicatio=
n from Captain Kidd,=20

and proceeded to draw it from an inner pocket of his coat. He failed to fin=
d it, and with a great=20

show of annoyance and a sudden recollection, he exclaimed with an oath that=
 he had left it on the=20

dressing table on his ship.  What was to be done? He would send immediately=
 out to the ship, and=20

have the paper brought to him. No, that was hardly worth while. He assured =
Captain Redfield that=20

he would hand him the paper on their return to the ship, with Captain Redfi=
eld accompanying him.=20

That, Captain Redfield replied, would hardly be satisfactory. His obligatio=
n was to give information=20

as to the hidden treasure only upon a well attested written order from Capt=
ain Kidd. Brisbau=20

cajoled, implored, and vehemently asserted the injury to his feelings which=
 the foolish reluctance=20

of his friend caused him.  By intuition, Captain Redfield became convinced,=
 on account of a certain=20

weakness in the attitude of Brisbau in defending his request, that there we=
re deceit and treachery=20

in his conduct. more conspicuous than any graces of art? And then again so =
many of them were=20

about Meenie; and these were forbidden; the praise of Meenie--even when it =
was the birds and the=20

roses and the foxgloves and the summer rills that sang of her--was not for =
alien eyes.  But at last=20

he lit upon some verses supposed to convey the sentiments of certain exiles=
 met together on New=20

Year's night in Nova Scotia; and he thought it was a simple kind of thing; =
at all events it would get=20

him out of a grievous difficulty. So--for the lines had been written many a=
 day ago, and came upon=20

him now with a new aspect--he altered a phrase here or there, by way of pas=
sing the time; and=20

finally he made a fair copy.  The next morning, being a Sunday, he espied M=
iss Carry walking=20

down towards the river; and he overtook her and gave her this little piece =
to redeem his pledge.=20

'It's not worth much,' said he, 'but you'll understand what it is about. Bu=
rn it when you've read it--

that's all I ask of ye----'  Then on he went, glad not to be cross-question=
ed, the faithful Harry=20

trotting at his heels.  So she sat down on the stone parapet of the little =
bridge--on this hushed, still,=20

shining morning that was quite summer-like in its calm--and opened the pape=
r with not a little=20

curiosity.  And well enough she understood the meaning of the little piece:=
 she knew that the=20

Mackays[#] used to live about here; and was not Strath-Naver but a few mile=
s off; and this the very=20

Mudal river running underneath the bridge on which she was sitting? But her=
e are the verses she=20

read--and he had entitled them  [#]=20


_
his determination to make no movement in the matter without the authority a=
bout which he had=20

spoken.  At this Brisbau rose in great anger and exclaimed, "I shall have t=
he money, or your life=20

will be no more than Jack Kettle's, who flaunted his opposition before Capt=
ain Kidd himself!"=20

Hardly had he spoken when Captain Redfield in the flash of a thought for se=
lf-preservation, sprang=20

upon him. Brisbau, equally as quick, met the onset and moved as best he cou=
ld to avoid the grasp=20

that threatened him.  They were quite alone. Redfield was entirely unarmed,=
 but his opponent=20

wore a sword at his side, with pistol and knife hanging from his belt. Havi=
ng made the assault, the=20

only safety for Redfield lay in his gaining the ascendency over his opponen=
t by sheer physical=20

effort, to enable him to keep Brisbau from using the weapons at his side. H=
e missed the hold=20

around both arms which he had planned, but firmly secured Brisbau's right a=
rm, while his own=20

keep the New Year's night;_ _The merry lads and lasses crowd_   _Around the=
 blazing light._=20

_But father and mother sit withdrawn_   _To let their fancies flee_ _To the=

_That sadden their shaded eyes?_ _Is it only thus they can see again_   _Th=

position required his utmost exertion, gradually became exhausted; but he h=

determination to win the mastery over Brisbau, who was likewise weary from =
the struggle and=20

doggedly angry. He feared a result disastrous to himself if he gave his opp=
onent an opportunity to=20
