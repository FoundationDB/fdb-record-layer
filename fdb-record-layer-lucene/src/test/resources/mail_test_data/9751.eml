 The orator, after this, declared that the duke of Burgundy had reserved so=
me charges of by itself. Another way of putting the question is: =E2=80=9C_=
Which of two or more wounds was mortal?_=E2=80=9D The questions are not qui=
te synonymous, for two or more of the wounds might be =E2=80=9Cmortal=E2=80=
=9D but not equally the cause of death. In fact, as we have already seen, _
the cession and restitution of the monies from the hospital of Toulouse.  =
=E2=80=98Thus the third article of=20

my minor is made clear, notwithstanding there are very many other horrible =
crimes of high treason=20

in the third degree, committed by the late duke of Orleans, unnoticed, whic=
h my lord of Burgundy=20

has reserved to himself, to bring forward or not as he may see occasion.  =
=E2=80=98I now come to the fourth=20

article of my minor, which is, that the late duke of Orleans, has been guil=
ty of high treason in the=20

fourth degree, namely, of offending against the public welfare.  =E2=80=98A=
lthough I were no marks of=20

bruises. All organs were found healthy on post-mortem examination, but the =
injured man died in=20

twenty minutes. Death was attributed to shock and the prisoners were convic=
ted of murder.  Death=20

from concussion of the brain is another example of death from shock. This m=
ay occur with only a=20

bruise on the scalp and with no intracranial hemorrhage or laceration of th=
e brain. The medical=20

witness should be cautious in the above classes of cases in giving evidence=
, as the defence may=20

rely upon the absence of any visible signs of mortal injury to prove that n=
o=20


_
realm, which is acting positively against the public good, I shall show how=
 he has otherwise=20

committed this crime. In the first place, by keeping men at arms in differe=
nt parts of the realm, who=20

did nothing but plunder the people, rob all travellers, and force women. He=
 moreover, placed their=20

captains in the strongest wrong.  Also a _number of injuries_, no one of wh=
ich alone could be the=20

direct cause of death, may cause death on the spot or very soon afterward. =
Death in such cases,=20

where there is no large effusion under the skin, is referred to exhaustion,=
 which, however, is=20

merely another term for shock. Such cases are exemplified by=20


_
bridges and fords of rivers, the better to succeed in his wicked designs, n=
amely, the usurpation of=20

the government.  =E2=80=98Secondly, He has imposed intolerable taxes on the=
 subjects of the realm,=20

pretending they were for the carrying on the war against the enemy, but giv=
ing from their amount=20

large sums to the illwishers to the kingdom, to induce them to become his a=
llies, and support him=20

in his attempt to seize the crown.  =E2=80=98Thus it appears that I have pr=
oved the duke of Orleans guilty of=20

high treason in the fourth degree. There are beside many other facts more w=
icked and criminal=20

than I have stated; but my lord of Burgundy has reserved them with others, =
to bring forward, if it be=20

necessary, more strongly to convict the duke of Orleans of having had the d=
esign of compassing=20

the king=E2=80=99s death, and the deaths of his royal family, that he might=
 obtain the crown.  =E2=80=98Now, if my=20

hearers will unite my minor with my major, it will clearly follow, that my =
lord of Burgundy is not=20

deserving of any blame whatever for what has happened to the criminal duke =
of Orleans; nor=20

ought the king our lord to be dissatisfied with him, but, on the contrary, =
he should be pleased with=20

what he or after the fight, become collapsed and die of exhaustion. Having =
sustained numerous=20

blows on the body during the many rounds, the body presents the marks of va=
rious bruises, but=20

there may be nothing else to explain the sudden death. No one injury or bru=
ise is mortal, and yet,=20

when the deceased was previously sound and in good health, death must be re=
ferred directly to=20

the multiple injuries received in the fight. We have already stated above t=
hat if the injuries are=20

numerous, the loss of a smaller amount of blood may be fatal. We see, there=
fore, that there is not=20

always a specific and visible =E2=80=9Cmortal=E2=80=9D injury to account fo=
r death. This is a well-known medical fact,=20

but it does not accord with the erroneous popular prejudice that no one can=
 die from violence=20

without some one visible wound which is mortal. In other words, the non-pro=
fessional mind leaves=20

out of account the idea of shock, only regarding material injury and not fu=
nctional disturbance. If=20

the circumstances accompanying death are unknown, it is well to be cautious=
. But if the deceased=20

was in ordinary health and vigor and there was no morbid cause to account f=
or the sudden death,=20

we need not hesitate=20


_
ways,=E2=80=94namely, in love, honour, and riches, after the example of the=
 rewards given to my lord the=20

archangel St Michael, and to the valiant man Phineas, which I have already =
mentioned in my=20

major.  =E2=80=98According to my plain understanding, I think our lord and =
king ought to declare his=20

attachment to my aforesaid lord of Burgundy,   II. WAS THE WOUND THE CAUSE =
OF DEATH=20

NECESSARILY?  This brings up a number of interesting questions to be consid=
ered. In medical=20

jurisprudence there is probably no condition so common as that the injury i=
s admitted, but death is=20

attributed to some other cause. Thus _if there are several wounds_ it may b=
e hard to decide on=20


_
good fame both within and without the kingdom, by his letters patent, in th=
e manner of epistles or=20

otherwise; and God grant it may be so done, =E2=80=98Qui est benedictus in =
secula seculorum. Amen.=E2=80=99=20

After master John Petit had finished his harangue, he requested of the duke=
 of Burgundy that he=20

would vouch for all he had said, which the duke granted, and avowed the who=
le of what master=20

John Petit had laid relative degree of mortality of any particular one, so =
as to be able to say that=20

death was directly or necessarily due to this or that one. The defence may =
plead that death was=20

not necessarily due to the particular wound attributed to the prisoner. Thi=
s brings up the=20

question=E2=80=94  =3DWhich of two or more Wounds was the Cause of Death?=
=3D No general rule can be=20

laid down for all cases, but each case must be=20
