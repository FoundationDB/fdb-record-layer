 Then the match went out=20

and they were again in darkness.  Suddenly, with a paroxysm of fear, the wo=
man sprang forward=20

and clutched in the darkness for the cradle; then with a wild, pitiful, hea=
rtbroken cry, she fell to the=20

floor.  "Mary, Mary, what is the matter?" cried the bewildered husband, try=
ing with trembling fingers=20

to strike another match.  A moment it sputtered and then burned bright, and=
 by the fitful light the=20

man beheld that which turned his blood to ice and his heart to stone.  The =
cradle was empty, and=20

the baby was gone.     CHAPTER II  THE CHASE  When the sudden gust of wind =

thieving and hunting when the darkness screens its deeds, as he has a very =
good pair of night-

eyes.  Being thus left in darkness, the great brute stepped gingerly about,=
 taking care not to tread=20

upon the two prostrate forms on the floor, until she came to the cradle.  T=
here she stooped and=20

investigated, passing her tongue caressingly over the little sleeper's face=

clumsy paws she drew the blanket in which the baby had been  =E2=80=98I sho=

not the most ancient, dukedom in the United Kingdom. He was spoiled, but he=

been an ordinary being, he would have merely subsided into selfishness and =
caprice, but having=20

good abilities and a good disposition, he was eccentric, adventurous, and s=

Notwithstanding the apathy which had been engendered by premature experienc=
e, St. Aldegonde=20

held extreme opinions, especially on political affairs, being a republican =
of the reddest dye. He=20

was opposed to all privilege, and indeed to all orders of men, except dukes=
, who were a necessity.=20

He was also strongly in favour of the equal division of all property, excep=

on land, and the greater the landowners, the greater the liberty of a count=

on this topic even with energy, amazed at anyone differing from him; =E2=80=
