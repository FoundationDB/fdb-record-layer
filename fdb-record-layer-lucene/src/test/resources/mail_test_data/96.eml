She brings a sandal[51] coolness to my eyes.               4  Madanika!  _Madanika._ [_Discovers 

Sharvilaka._] Oh, oh, oh, Sharvilaka! I am so glad, Sharvilaka. Where have you been? 

_Sharvilaka._ I will tell you. [_They gaze at each other passionately._]  _Vasantasena._ How 

Madanika lingers! I wonder where she is. [_She looks through a bull's-eye window._] Why, there 

she stands, talking with a man. Her loving glance does not waver, and she gazes as if she would 

drink him in. I one's soul in quiet, to be satisfied with the needful knowledge, small though it be, 

which is vouchsafed to us, and to amuse the mind with every opinion and every varying humour of 

that curious and wayward creature man! And who so wayward, who so wavering as one's self in 

all those parts of our composite being which are subject to the play of time and circumstance? 

Such, in an age of confusion working towards clearness, an age of belligerency tending towards 

concord, were the

wishes to make her free. Well, let her stay, let her stay. Never interrupt anybody's happiness. I will 

not call her.  _Madanika._ Tell me, Sharvilaka. [_Sharvilaka looks about him uneasily._] What is it, 

Sharvilaka? You seem uneasy.  _Sharvilaka._ I will tell you a secret. Are we alone?  _Madanika._ 

Of course we are.  _Vasantasena._ What! a deep secret? I will not listen.  _Sharvilaka._ Tell me, 

Madanika. Will Vasantasena take a price for your freedom?  _Vasantasena._ The conversation 

has to do with me? Then I will hide behind this window and listen.  _Madanika._ I asked my 

mistress about it, Sharvilaka, and she said that if she could have _her_ way, she would free all her 

servants for nothing. But Sharvilaka, where did you find such a fortune that you can think of buying 

my freedom from my mistress?  _Sharvilaka._      A victim to my pauper plight,       And your sweet 

love to win,     For you, my timid maid, last night       I did the deed of sin.                                     5

_Madanika._ Oh, Sharvilaka! For a mere nothing--for a woman--you have risked both things! 

_Sharvilaka._ What things?  _Madanika._ Your life and your character.  _Sharvilaka._ My foolish 

girl, fortune favors the brave.  _Madanika._ Oh, Sharvilaka! Your character was without a stain. 

You didn't do anything _very_ bad, did you, when for my sake you did the deed of sin?  _Sharv._ 

The gems that magnify a woman's charm,     As flowers the creeping plant, I do not harm.     I do 

not rob the Brahman of his pelf,     Nor seize the sacrificial gold myself.     de Montaigne.  MICHEL 

EYQUEM, SEIGNEUR DE MONTAIGNE, was born at a chateau in Perigord, in the year 1533. His 

father, whom Montaigne always remembered with affectionate reverence, was a man of original 

ideas. He entrusted the infant to the care of peasants, wishing to attach him to the people; 

educated him in Latin as if his native tongue; roused him at morning from sleep to the sound of 

music. From his sixth to his thirteenth year Montaigne was at the College de Guyenne, where he 

took the leading parts in Latin tragedies composed by Muret and Buchanan. In 1554 he 

succeeded his father as councillor in the court _des aides_ of Perigueux, the members of which 

were soon afterwards incorporated in the Parliament of Bordeaux. But nature had not destined 

Montaigne for the duties of the magistracy; he saw too many sides of every question; he chose 

rather to fail in justice than in humanity. In 1565 he acquired a large fortune by marriage, and 

having lost his father, he retired from public functions in 1570, to enjoy a tranquil existence of 

meditation, and of rambling through books. He had published, a year before, in fulfilment of his 

father's desire, a translation of the _Theologia Naturalis_ of Raimond de Sebonde, a Spanish 

philosopher of the fifteenth century; and now he occupied himself in preparing for the press the 

writings of his dead friend La Boetie. Love for his father and love for his friend were the two 

passions of Montaigne's life. From 1571 to 1580 he dwelt in retreat, in company with his books 

and his ideas, indulging his humour for tranquil freedom of the mind. It was his custom to enrich 

the margins of his books with 


_
Simply because I need to fill my purse.     Even as a thief, I strive with main and might     For just 

distinction 'twixt the wrong and right.             6  And so you may tell Vasantasena this:      These 

ornaments were made for you to don,       Or so it seems to me;     But as you love me, never put 

them on       Where other folks may see.                                 7  _Madanika._ But Sharvilaka, 

ornaments that nobody may see, and a courtezan--the two things do not hang together. Give me 

the jewels. I want to see them.  _Sharvilaka._ Here they are. [_He gives them to her with some an 

extension of such notes; Plutarch and Seneca were, above all, his favourites; afterwards, the 

volume which he read with most enjoyment, and annotated most curiously, was that of his own 

life.  And, indeed, Montaigne's daily life, with outward monotony and internal variety, was a 

pleasant miscellany on which to comment. He was of a middle temperament, "between the jovial 

and the melancholic"; a lover of solitude, yet the reverse of morose; choosing bright companions 

rather than sad; able to be silent, as the mood took him, or to gossip; loyal and frank; a hater of 

hypocrisy and falsehood; a despiser
