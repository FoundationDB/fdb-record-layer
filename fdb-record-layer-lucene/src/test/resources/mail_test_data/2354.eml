really examine these edible nests you'd find they were made of surprisingly=
 appealing and=20

succulent tendrils. They're quite appetizing, you may be sure, or they'd ne=
ver be eaten!"  I stood=20

turning this over, exactly as I've seen my Dinkie turn over an unexpectedly=
 rancid nut.  "Aren't you,=20

under the circumstances, being rather stupidly clever?" I finally asked.  "=
When I suppose you'd=20

rather see me cleverly stupid?" he found the heart to suggest.  "But that w=
oman, to me, always=20

looked like a frog," I protested, doing my best to duplicate his pose of im=
personality.  "Well, she=20

doesn't make love like a frog," he retorted with his first betraying touch =
of anger. I turned to the=20

window, to the end that my Eliza-Crossing-the-Ice look wouldn't be entirely=
 at his mercy. A belated=20

March blizzard was slapping at the panes and cuffing the house-corners. At =
the end of a long=20

winter, I knew, tempers were apt to be short. But this was sung of the aggr=
andizement of Austria in=20

former days--    "Let others war, do thou, blest Austria, wed,"  so the hou=
se of Saxe Coburg may=20

be said in later days to have been aggrandized by weddings. The marriage of=
 his patron with the=20

presumptive heiress to the Crown of England was the beginning of Stockmar's=
 subterranean=20

greatness.  The Princess Charlotte expressed herself to Stockmar with regar=
d to the character of=20

her revered parents in the following "pithy" manner:--"My mother was bad, b=
ut she could not have=20

become as bad as she was if my father had not been infinitely worse." The R=
egent was anxious to=20

have the Princess married for two reasons, in the opinion of the judicious =
author of this memoir--

because he wanted to be rid of his daughter, and because when she married s=
he would form less=20

of a link between him and his wife. Accordingly, when she was eighteen, hin=
ts were given her=20

through the court physician, Sir Henry Halford (such is the course of royal=
 love), that if she would=20

have the kindness to fix=20


_
man I'd wanted to live with like a second "Suzanne de Sirmont" in Daudet's =
_Happiness_ had not=20

only cut me to the quick but was rubbing salt in the wound. He had said wha=
t he did with=20

deliberate intent to hurt me, for it was only too obvious that he was tired=
 of being on the defensive.=20

And it did hurt. It couldn't help hurting. For the man, after all, was my h=
usband. He was the=20

husband to whom I'd given up the best part of my life, the two-legged baske=
t into which I'd packed=20

all my eggs of allegiance. And now he was scrambling that precious collecti=
on for a cheap=20

omelette of amorous adventure. He was my husband, I kept reminding myself. =
But that didn't=20

cover the entire case. No husband whose heart is right stands holding anoth=
er woman's on the=20

hereditary Prince of Orange (afterwards King William II. of the Netherlands=
), whom she had never=20

seen, it would be exceedingly convenient. The Prince came over to England, =
and, by the help of a=20

"certain amount of artful precipitation on the part of the father," the pai=
r became formally engaged.=20

The Princess said at first that she did not think her betrothed "by any mea=
ns so disagreeable as=20

she had expected." In time, however, this ardour of affection abated. The P=
rince was a baddish=20

subject, and he had a free-and-easy manner, and wanted tact and refinement.=
 He returned to=20

London from some races seated on the outside of a coach, and in a highly ex=
cited state. Worst of=20

all, he lodged at his tailor's. The engagement was ultimately broken=20


_
upturned eyes. It shows the wind is not blowing right in the home circle. I=
t shows a rent in the=20

dyke, a flaw in the blade, a breach in the fortress-wall of faith. For marr=
iage, to the wife who is a=20

mother as well, impresses me as rather like the spliced arrow of the Esquim=
os: it is cemented=20

together with blood. It is a solemn matter. And for the sake of _mutter-sch=
utz_, if for nothing else,=20

it must be kept that way.  There was a time, I suppose, when the thought of=
 such a thing would=20

have taken my breath away, would have chilled me to the bone. But I'd been =
through my refining=20

fires, in that respect, and you can't burn the prairie over twice in the sa=
me season. I tried to tell=20

myself it was the setting, and not the essential fact, that seemed so odiou=
s. I did my best to=20

believe it wasn't so much that Duncan Argyll McKail had stooped to make adv=
ances to this bandy-

legged she-teacher whom I'd so charitably housed at Casa Grande since the b=
eginning of the=20

year--for I'd long since learned not to swallow the antique claim that of a=
ll terrestrial _carnivora_=20

only man and the lion are truly monogamous--but more the fact it had been m=
ade such a back-

stairs affair with no solitary redeeming touch of dignity.  Dinky-Dunk, I s=
uppose, would have=20

laughed it away, if I hadn't walked in on them with their arms about each o=
ther, and the bandy-

legged one breathing her capitulating sighs into his ear. But there was des=
peration in the eyes of=20

Miss Alsina Teeswater, and it was plain to see that if my husband had been =
merely playing with=20

fire it had become a much more serious matter with the lady in the case. Th=
ere was, in fact,=20

difficulty with regard to the future residence of the couple, which would e=
vidently have become=20

more complicated and serious if the Queen of the Netherlands had ever inher=
ited the Crown of=20

England. The Princess was passionately opposed to leaving her country. The =
Regent and his=20

ministers tried to keep the poor girl in the dark, and get her into a posit=
ion from which there would=20

be no retreat. But she had a temper and a will of her own; and her recalcit=
ration was assisted by=20

the Parliamentary Opposition, who saw in the marriage a move of Tory policy=
, and by her mother,=20

who saw in it something agreeable to her husband. Any one who wishes to see=
 how diplomatic=20

lovers quarrel will find instruction in these pages.  The place left vacant=
 by the rejected William=20

was taken by Prince Leopold, with whom Stockmar came to England. In Stockma=
r's Diary of May=20

5th, 1806, is the entry:--"I saw the sun (that of royalty we presume, not t=
he much calumniated sun=20

of Britain) for the first time at Oatlands. Baron Hardenbroek, the Prince's=
 equerry, was going into=20

the breakfast- room. I followed him, when he suddenly signed to me with his=
 hand to stay behind;=20

but she had already seen me and I her. '_Aha, docteur_,' she said, '_entrez=
_.' She was=20

handsomer than I had expected, with most peculiar manners, her hands genera=
lly folded behind=20

her, her body always pushed forward, never standing quiet, from time to tim=
e stamping her foot,=20

laughing a great deal and talking still more. I was examined from head to f=
oot, without, however,=20

losing my countenance. My first impression was not favourable. In the eveni=
ng she pleased me=20

more. Her dress=20


_
hers. I was almost sorry for her when she turned and walked white-lipped ou=
t of the room. What I=20

resented most, as I stood facing my husband, was his paraded casualness, hi=
s refusal to take a=20

tragic situation tragically. His attitude seemed to imply that we were abou=
t to have a difference=20

over a small thing--over a small thing with brown eyes. He could even stand=
 inspecting me with a=20

mildly amused glance, and I might have forgiven his mildness, I suppose, if=
 it had been without=20

amusement, and that amusement in some way at my expense. He even managed to=
 laugh as I=20

stood there staring at him. It was neither an honest nor a natural laugh. I=
t merely gave me the=20

feeling that he was trying to entrench himself behind a raw mound of mirth,=
 that any shelter was=20

welcome until the barrage was lifted.  "And what do you intend doing about =
it?" I asked, more=20

quietly than I had imagined possible.  "What would you suggest?" he parried=
, as he began to feel=20

in doctor, and, of course, he took to her. A subsequent entry in his Diary =
is:--"The Princess is in=20

good humour, and then she pleases easily. I thought her dress particularly =
becoming; dark roses=20

in her hair, a short light blue dress without sleeves, with a low round col=
lar, a white puffed out=20

Russian chemisette, the sleeves of lace. I have never seen her in any dress=
 which was not both=20

simple and in good taste." She seems to have improved under the influence o=
f her husband,=20

whom his physician calls "a manly prince and a princely man." In her manner=
s there was some=20

room for improvement, if we may judge from her treatment of Duke Prosper of=
 Aremburg, who was=20

one of the guests at a great dinner recorded in the Diary:--"Prosper is a h=
ideous little mannikin,=20

dressed entirely in black, with a large star. The Prince presented him to t=
he Princess, who was at=20

the moment talking to the Minister Castlereagh. She returned the duke's two=
 profound continental=20


_
pockets for his pipe.  And I still had a sense, as I saw the barricaded loo=
k come into his face, of=20

entrenchments being frantically thrown up. I continued to stare at him as h=
e found his pipe and=20

proceeded to fill it. I even wrung a ghostly satisfaction out of the discov=
ery that his fingers weren't=20

so steady as he might have without looking at him or saying a word to him, =
and brought her elbow=20

so close to him that he could not move. He sat looking straight before him =
with some, though not=20

very marked, embarrassment. He exchanged now and then a few words in French=
 with the=20

massive and mighty Lady Castlereagh, by whose side he looked no larger than=
=20


_
"I suppose you're trying to make me feel like the Wicked Uncle edging away =
from the abandoned=20

Babes in the Woods?" he finally demanded, as though exasperated by my silen=
ce. He was delving=20

for matches by this time, and seemed disappointed that none was to be found=
 in his pockets. I=20

don't know why he should seem to recede from me, for he didn't move an inch=
 from where he=20

stood with that defensively mocking smile on his face. But abysmal gulfs of=
 space seemed to blow=20

in like sea-mists between him and me, desolating and lonely stretches of em=
ptiness which could=20

Princess dismissed him in the same manner in which she had welcomed him, an=
d broke into a=20

loud laugh before he was fairly out of the room."  Stockmar's position in t=
he little court was not very=20

flattering or agreeable. The members of the household hardly regarded the p=
oor German=20

physician as their equal; and if one or two of the men were pleasant, the l=
ady who constituted their=20

only lawful female society, Mrs. Campbell, Lady-in-Waiting to the Princess,=
 was, in her ordinary=20

moods, decidedly the reverse. Stockmar, however, in drawing a piquant portr=
ait of her,=20
