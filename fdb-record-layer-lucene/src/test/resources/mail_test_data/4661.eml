philodendron monstera lasted until the evening; and although our guides inv=
ariably hurried forward on the march to the neighbourhood of some deserted =
huts, whose occupants had migrated north, our baggage and servants upon the=
 road were exposed to the storm, and arrived late in the evening, wet and m=

have had many philodendron monstera lasted until the evening; and although =
our guides invariably hurried forward on the march to the neighbourhood of =
some deserted huts, whose occupants had migrated north, our baggage and ser=
vants upon the road were exposed to the storm, and arrived late in the even=
ing, wet and miserable. There could be no doubt that the Giles.  =E2=80=9CI=

 from Bertram, saying his mother was quite surprised and disappointed that =
Lothair had not asked to see her in the morning. She had expected him, as a=
 matter of course, at luncheon, and begged that he would come on the morrow=
.  =E2=80=9CI have had many _
conduct us to Sofi. There were two superb hygeens duly equipped for my wife=
 and myself: they=20

were snow-white, without speck or blemish, and as clean and silk-like as go=
od grooming could=20

accomplish. One of these beautiful creatures I subsequently measured,--seve=
n feet three and a=20

half inches to the top of the hump; this was much above the average. The ba=
ggage-camels were=20

left to the charge of the servants, and we were requested to mount immediat=
ely, as the Sheik=20

Abou Sinn was determined to accompany us for some distance as a mark of cou=
rtesy, although he=20

was himself to march with his people on that day in the opposite direction =
towards Gozerajup.=20

Escorted by our grand old host, with a great number of mounted attendants, =
we left the hospitable=20

camp, and followed the margin of the Atbara valley towards the south, until=
, at the distance of=20

about two miles, Abou Sinn took leave, and returned with his people.  We no=
w enjoyed the=20

contrast between the light active step of first-class hygeens, and the heav=
y swinging action of the=20

camels we had hitherto ridden. Travelling was for the first time a pleasure=
; there was a delightful=20

movement in the elasticity of the hygeens, who ambled at about five miles a=
nd a half an hour, as=20

their natural pace; this they can continue for nine or ten hours without fa=
tigue. Having no care for=20

the luggage, and the coffee-pot being slung upon the saddle of an attendant=
, who also carried our=20

carpet, we were perfectly independent, as we were prepared with the usual l=
uxuries upon halting,--

the carpet to recline upon beneath a shady tree, and a cup of good Turkish =
coffee. Thus we could=20

afford to travel at a rapid rate, and await the arrival of the baggage-came=
ls at the end of the day's=20

journey. In this manner the march should be arranged in these wild countrie=
s, where there is no=20

resting-place upon the path beyond the first inviting shade that suggests a=
 halt. The day's journey=20

should be about twenty-four miles. A loaded camel seldom exceeds two miles =
and a half per hour;=20

at this rate nearly ten hours would be consumed upon the road daily, during=
 which time the=20

traveller would be exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and to the fatig=
ue inseparable from a=20

long and slow march. A servant mounted upon a good hygeen should accompany =
him with the=20

coffee apparatus and a cold roast fowl and biscuits; the ever necessary car=
pet should form the=20

cover to his saddle, to be ready when required; he then rides far in advanc=
e of the caravan. This=20

simple arrangement insures comfort, and lessens the ennui of the journey; t=
he baggage-camels=20

are left in charge of responsible  Thus, one by one, all the cerulean demon=
s of the morn had=20

vanished, and Lothair had nothing to worry him. He felt a little dull as th=
e dinner-hour approached.=20

Bertram was to dine at home, and then go to the House of Commons; St. Aldeg=
onde, concluding=20

the day with the same catastrophe, had in the most immoral manner, in the i=
nterval, gone to the=20

play to see =E2=80=9CSchool,=E2=80=9D of which he had read an account in Ga=
lignani when he was in quarantine.=20

Lothair was so displeased with this unfeeling conduct on his part that he d=
eclined to accompany=20

him; but Lady St. Aldegonde, who dined at Crecy House, defended her husband=
, and thought it=20

very right and reasonable that one so fond of the drama as he, who had been=
 so long deprived of=20

gratifying his taste in that respect, should take the first opportunity of =
enjoying this innocent=20

amusement. A solitary dinner at Muriel House, in one of those spacious and =
lofty chambers, rather=20

appalled Lothair, and he was getting low again, remembering nothing but his=
 sorrows, when Mr.=20

Pinto came up to him and said: =E2=80=9CThe impromptu is always successful =
in life; you cannot be=20

engaged to dinner, for everybody believes you are at Jericho. What say you =
to dining with me?=20

Less than the Muses and more than the Graces, certainly, if you come. Lady =
Beatrice has invited=20

herself, and she is to pick up a lady, and I was to look out for a couple o=
f agreeable men. Hugo is=20



coming, and you will complete the charm.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe spell then =
is complete,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9CI suppose a=20

late eight.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 82 Lothair was breakfasting alone on the=
 morrow, when his servant=20

announced the arrival of Mr. Ruby, who had been ordered to be in attendance=
.  =E2=80=9CShow him up,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand bring me the dispatch-box which is in my dressin=
g-room.=E2=80=9D  Mr. Ruby was deeply=20

gratified to be again in the presence of a nobleman so eminently distinguis=
hed, both for his=20

property and his taste, as Lothair. He was profuse in his congratulations t=
o his lordship on his=20

return to his native land, while at the same time he was opening a bag, fro=
m which he extracted a=20

variety of beautiful objects, none of them for sale, all executed commissio=
ns, which were destined=20

to adorn the fortunate and the fair. =E2=80=9CThis is lovely, my lord, quit=
e new, for the Queen of=20

Madagascar; for the empress this, her majesty=E2=80=99s own design, at leas=
t almost. Lady Melton=E2=80=99s bridal=20

necklace, and my lord=E2=80=99s George, the last given by King James II.; b=
roken up during the revolution,=20

but reset by us from an old drawing with picked stones.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C=
Very pretty,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9Cbut it is not=20

exactly this sort of thing that I want. See,=E2=80=9D and he opened the=20


_
shall arrive at the place selected for the halt by the traveller. The usual=
 hour of starting is about=20

5.30 A.M. The entire day's journey can be accomplished in something under f=
ive hours upon=20

hygeens, instead of the ten hours dreary pace of the caravan; thus, the fin=
al halt would be made at=20

about 10.30 A.M. at which time the traveller would be ready for breakfast. =
The carpet would be=20

spread under a shady tree; upon a branch of this his water-skin should be s=
uspended, and the=20

day's work over, he can write up his journal and enjoy his pipe while coffe=
e is being prepared.=20

After breakfast he can take his gun or rifle and explore the neighbourhood,=
 until the baggage-

camels shall arrive in the evening, by which time, if he is a sportsman, he=
 will have procured=20

something for the dinner of the entire party. The servants will have collec=
ted firewood, and all will=20

be ready for the arrival of the of it a crucifix. It was made of some Easte=
rn wood, inlaid with=20

mother-of-pearl; the figure carved in brass, though not without power, and =
at the end of each of=20

the four terminations of the cross was a small cavity, enclosing something,=
 and covered with glass.=20

=E2=80=9CSee,=E2=80=9D continued Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthis is the crucifix, gi=
ven with a carved shell to each pilgrim who visits=20

the Holy Sepulchre. Within these four cavities is earth from the four holy =
places: Calvary, Sion,=20

Bethlehem, and Gethsemane. Now, what I want is a crucifix, something of thi=
s dimension, but=20

made of the most costly materials; the figure must be of pure gold; I shoul=
d like the cross to be of=20

choice emeralds, which I am told are now more precious even than brilliants=
, and I wish the earth=20

of the sacred places to be removed from this crucifix, and introduced in a =
similar manner into the=20

one which you are to make; and each cavity must be=20


_
a general scramble, inseparable from the work to be suddenly performed, whe=
n camels must be=20

unloaded, fuel collected, fires lighted, the meals prepared, beds made, &c.=
 &c. all at the same=20

moment, with the chance of little to eat. Nothing keeps the camel-drivers a=
nd attendants in such=20

good humour as a  =E2=80=9CI follow you, my lord,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Ruby, w=
ith glistening eyes. =E2=80=9CIt will be a rare=20

jewel. Is there to be a limit as to the cost?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNone but s=
uch as taste and propriety suggest,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair. =E2=80=9CYou will of course make a drawing and an estimate, and se=
nd them to me; but I desire=20

dispatch.=E2=80=9D  When Mr.=20

 good luck that may=20

attend the master's gun, and upon arrival at the general bivouac in the eve=
ning they are always on=20

the alert to skin and divide the antelopes, pluck the guinea-fowls, &c. &c.=
 We now travelled in this=20

delightful manner; there were great numbers of guinea-fowl throughout packe=
t, and looked at it for=20

some moments, and then pressed it to his lips.  In the afternoon, Lothair f=
ound himself again in the=20

saddle, and was riding about London, as if he had never quitted it. He left=
 his cards at Crecy=20

House, and many other houses, and he called at the St. Jeromes=E2=80=99 lat=
e, but asked if they were at=20

home. He had reckoned that they would not=20

which was the same everlasting flat and rich table land, extending for seve=
ral hundred miles to the=20

south, and dotted with green mimosas; while upon our left was the broken va=
lley of the Atbara.=20

The only drawback to the journey was the rain. At about 2 P.M. daily we wer=
e himself that it was a=20

relief. Mr. Putney Giles dined alone with Lothair this evening, and they ta=
lked over many things;=20

among others the approaching marriage of Lady Corisande with the Duke of Br=
econ.  =E2=80=9CEverybody=20

marries except myself,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, rather peevishly.  =E2=80=9CB=
