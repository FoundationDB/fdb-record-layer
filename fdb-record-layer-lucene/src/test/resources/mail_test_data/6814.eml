he was "my servant, and that all that I required should be immediately atte=
nded to." Shortly after,=20

we were called upon by several Greeks, one of whom was the army doctor, Sig=
nor Georgis, who,=20

with great kindness, offered to supply all our wants. My wife was dreadfull=
y weak and exhausted,=20

therefore an undisturbed night's rest was all that was required, with the i=
ndependence of our own=20

tent.  Cassala is rich in hyaenas, and the night was passed in the discorda=
nt howling of these=20

disgusting but useful animals: they are the scavengers of the country, devo=
uring every species of=20

filth, and clearing all carrion from the earth. Without the hyaenas and vul=
tures, the neighbourhood=20

of a Nubian village would be unbearable; it is the idle custom of the peopl=
e to leave unburied all=20

animals that die. Thus, among the numerous flocks and herds, the casualties=
 would create a=20

pestilence were it not for the birds and beasts of prey.  On the following =
morning the fever had=20

yielded to quinine, and we were enabled to receive a round of visits--the g=
overnor and suite, Elias=20

Bey, the doctor and a friend, and, lastly, Malem Georgis, an elderly Greek =
merchant, who, with=20

great hospitality, insisted upon our quitting the sultry tent and sharing h=
is own roof. We therefore=20

became his guests in a most comfortable house for some days. Our Turk, Hadj=
i Achmet, returned=20

on his way to Berber; we discharged our camels, and prepared - to start afr=
esh from this point for=20

the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia.   CHAPTER IV.  ROUTE FROM CASSALA TO SOU=
AKIM.  BY=20

dead reckoning, Cassala is ninety-three miles S.S.E. of Gozerajup, or about=
 340 miles from=20

Berber. We had ridden about 710 miles from Korosko, 630 miles of which had =
been through=20

scorching deserts during the hottest season. We were, therefore, thankful t=
o exchange the intense=20

heat of the tent for a solid roof, and to rest for a short time in the pict=
uresque country of Taka.  The=20

direct route to Cassala, the capital of Taka, should be from Suez to Souaki=
m, on the Red Sea, and=20

from thence in sixteen days, by camel. Thus, were there a line from Suez to=
 Souakim by steamers,=20

similar to that already established to Jedda, Cassala would be only twenty-=
two days' journey from=20

Cairo. At present, the arrival of steamers at Souakim is entirely uncertain=
; therefore the trade of=20

the country is paralysed by the apathy of the caught countenances like that=
 of the man who was=20

waiting at the corner of the street for Benvenuto Cellini, in order to assa=
ssinate the great=20

Florentine.=E2=80=9D  It was impossible for Lothair in his present conditio=
n to have fallen upon a more=20

suitable companion than Mr. Phoebus. It is not merely change of scene and a=
ir that we sometimes=20

want, but a revolution in the atmosphere of thought and feeling in which we=
 live and breathe.=20

Besides his great intelligence and fancy, and his peculiar views on art and=
 man and affairs in=20

general, which always interested their hearer, and sometimes convinced, the=
re was a general=20

vivacity in Mr. Phoebus and a vigorous sense of life, which were inspiritin=
g to his companions.=20

When there was any thing to be done, great or small, Mr. Phoebus liked to d=
o it; and this, as he=20

averred, from a sense of duty, since, if any thing is to be done, it should=
 be done in the best=20

manner, and no one could do it so well as Mr. Phoebus. He always acted as i=
f he had been=20

created to be the oracle and model of the human race, but the oracle was ne=
ver pompous or=20

solemn, and the model was always beaming with good-nature and high spirits.=
  Mr. Phoebus liked=20

Lothair. He liked youth, and good-looking youth; and youth that was intelli=
gent and engaging and=20

well-mannered. He also liked old men. But, between fifty and seventy, he sa=
w little to approve of in=20

the dark sex. They had lost their good looks if they ever had any, their wi=
ts were on the wane, and=20

they were invariably selfish. When they attained second childhood, the char=
m often returned. Age=20

was frequently beautiful, wisdom appeared like an aftermath, and the heart =
which seemed dry and=20



deadened suddenly put forth shoots of sympathy.  Mr. Phoebus postponed his =
voyage in order=20

that Lothair might make his preparations to become his guest in his island.=
 =E2=80=9CI cannot take you to a=20

banker,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cfor I have none; but I wish you=
 would share my purse. Nothing will=20

ever induce me to use what they call paper money. It is the worst thing tha=
t what they call=20

civilization has produced; neither hue nor shape, and yet a substitute for =
the richest color, and,=20

where the arts flourish, the finest forms.=E2=80=9D  The telegraph which br=
ought an order to the bankers at=20

Malta to give an unlimited credit to Lothair, rendered it unnecessary for o=
ur friend to share what=20

steamers regularly from Suez to Jedda; and, although they advertise Souakim=
 as a port of call,=20

there is no dependence to be placed upon the announcement; therefore, all m=
erchants are afraid=20

not only of delay, but of high warehouse charges at Souakim. The latter por=
t is only four days'=20

steaming from Suez, and, being the most central depot for all merchandise b=
oth to and from Upper=20

Egypt, it would become a point of great importance were regular means of tr=
ansport established.=20

Cotton of excellent quality may be grown to an unlimited amount in the prov=
inces of Upper Egypt,=20

and could be delivered at Souakim at a trifling cost of transport. A large =
quantity of gum arabic is=20

collected throughout this country, which sells in Cassala at 20 piastres (4=
s. 2d.) the cantar of 100=20

lbs. There are three varieties, produced from various mimosas; the finest q=
uality is gathered in the=20

province of Kordofan, but I subsequently met with large opportunity of seei=
ng it, as Mr. Phoebus=20

one morning opened a chest in his cabin and produced several velvet bags, o=
ne full of pearls,=20

another of rubies, others of Venetian sequins, Napoleons, and golden piastr=
es. =E2=80=9CI like to look at=20

them,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus, =E2=80=9Cand find life more intense when t=
hey are about my person. But bank-

notes, so cold and thin=E2=80=94they give me an ague.=E2=80=9D  Madame Phoe=
bus and her sister Euphrosyne=20

welcomed Lothair in maritime costumes which were absolutely bewitching; won=
drous jackets with=20

loops of pearls, girdles defended by dirks with handles of turquoises, and =
tilted hats that; while=20

they screened their long eyelashes from the sun, crowned the longer braids =
of their never-ending=20

hair. Mr. Phoebus gave banquets every day on board his yacht, attended by t=
he chief personages=20

of the island, and the most agreeable officers of the garrison. They dined =
upon deck, and it=20

delighted him, with a surface of sang-froid, to=20


_
Base country. Senna grows wild in the deserts, but the low price hardly pay=
s for the cost of=20

collection. There are several varieties; that with extremely narrow and sha=
rp-pointed leaves is=20

preferred. It grows in sandy situations where few plants would exist. The b=
ush seldom exceeds=20

three feet in height, and is generally below that standard; but it is excee=
dingly thick, and rich in a=20

pale green foliage, which is a strong temptation to the hungry camel. Curio=
usly, this purgative=20

plant is the animal's bonne bouche, and is considered most nourishing as fo=
dder.  The exports of=20

the Soudan are limited to gum arabic, ivory, hides, senna, and bees'-wax; t=
he latter is the produce=20

of to the refined festivals of Paris. Sometimes they had a dance; sometimes=
 in his barge, rowed by=20

a crew in Venetian dresses, his guests glided on the tranquil waters, under=
 a starry sky, and=20

listened to the exquisite melodies of their hostess and her sister.  At len=
gth the day of departure=20

arrived. It was bright, with a breeze favorable to the sail and opportune f=
or the occasion. For all the=20

officers of the garrison, and all beautiful Valetta itself, seemed present =
in their yachts and barges=20

to pay their last tribute of admiration to the enchanting sisters and the a=
ll-accomplished owner of=20

the Pan. Placed on the galley of his yacht, Mr. Phoebus surveyed the brilli=
ant and=20
