philodendron monstera irresponsibility. Though you flee to the uttermost parts of the earth, and hide yourselves from the sight of men, or seek oblivion in the tumult of the social no one whom we do not know shall pass."  "What is to be done?" said Porthos.  "Pardieu! pass," replied D'Artagnan.  "But how?" asked Mazarin.  "Through or philodendron monstera irresponsibility. Though you flee to the uttermost parts of the earth, and hide yourselves from the sight of men, or seek oblivion in the tumult of the social no one whom we do not know shall pass."  "What is to be done?" said Porthos.  "Pardieu! pass," replied D'Artagnan.  "But how?" asked Mazarin.  "Through or _
begotten so dreadful a Karma; and Krishna answered her: "If thou could'st look back to thy fifty-

first anterior birth, as I can, thou would'st see thyself killing in wanton cruelty the same number of 

ants as that of the sons thou hast now lost." This, of course, is only a poetical exaggeration; yet it 

is a striking image to show how great results come from apparently trifling causes.  Good and evil 

are relative, and are intensified or lessened according to the conditions by which man is 

surrounded. One who belongs to that which we call the "useless portion of mankind," that is to 

say, the lay majority, is in many cases irresponsible. Crimes committed in Avidya, or ignorance, 

involve physical but not moral responsibilities or Karma. Take, for example, the case of idiots, 

children, savages, and Porthos, to this good Planchet."  "Planchet, my friend," said Porthos, in a 

melancholy voice, "I am very ill; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to 

me."  "Oh! good Heaven," said Planchet, "what a misfortune! and how did it happen?"  "I will tell 

you all about it," replied Mousqueton.  Porthos uttered a deep groan.  "Make way for us, Planchet," 

said D'Artagnan in a whisper to him, "or he will not arrive alive; the lungs are attacked, my friend." 

Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says, "In that case things look ill." Then he 

exclaimed, turning to his men:  "Let them pass; they are friends."  The carriage resumed its 

course, and Mazarin, who had held his breath, ventured to breathe again.  "Bricconi!" muttered he.

better. But the case of each who is pledged to the HIGHER SELF is quite another matter. _You 

cannot invoke this Divine Witness with impunity_, and once that you have put yourselves under its 

tutelage, you have asked the Radiant Light to shine and search through all the dark corners of 

your being; consciously you have invoked the Divine Justice of Karma to take note of your motive, 

to scrutinize your actions, and to enter up all in your account. The step is irrevocable as that of the 

infant taking birth. Never troop; this latter party was composed of ill-looking fellows, who 

resembled bandits more than anything else; they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eustache. 

"Attention, Porthos!" cried D'Artagnan.  Porthos placed his hand on the pistols.  "What is it?" asked 

Mazarin.  "My lord, I think we are in bad company."  A man advanced to the door with a kind of 

scythe in his hand. "Qui vive?" he asked.  "Eh, rascal!" said D'Artagnan, "do you not recognize his 

highness the prince's carriage?"  "Prince or not," said
