 next street back of Falls City Hall stood the St. John=E2=80=99s Episcopal=
 Church. The rector, with his little four-year-old boy, was in the study. T=
he rectory and the church were completely _
just begun to reach the third story at the end where it commenced.  Newton =
had before this been=20

released, and the further extremity of the rope which had encircled his bod=
y had itself began to=20

catch fire.  The coolness and discrimination of Mr. Phillimore began to des=
ert him.  He told me that=20

he became sensible of giddiness or approaching vertigo. By a strong effort =
of will he conquered=20

the present most serious danger, and his judgment and prudence rose again w=
ith the extremity of=20

his peril.  He joined all the rope together--that which he had last found t=
o that which had been used=20

in the deliverance of Newton--and fastening one end of the cord round his b=
ody, he slowly and=20

cautiously lowered himself until he began to feel the scorching flames abou=
t his extremities.  The=20

cord was not quite long enough!  Another awful sensation of approximate dea=
th overtook him; and=20

he afterwards informed me that he knows not how he contrived to complete th=
e work of his own=20

deliverance.  In truth, however, as I afterwards learned from two of the by=
standers, with, it seemed=20

to them, wonderful regularity, although with extraordinary speed, he contin=
ued to lower himself=20

right through a mass of belching flame. When he landed on the ground, it wa=
s seen that his coat-

tails were ignited, and that his face was terribly scorched. He must have c=
losed his eyes, or he=20

would inevitably have been blinded.  Happily the fire had not consumed the =
wall nor the floor, and=20

it was possible for three or four of the most daring spectators to rush for=
ward, seize the now=20

swooning and senseless man, and carry him off to a surgeon's hard by. Here =
he received=20

immediate attention, and he was afterwards removed to an hotel, where he la=
y delirious for=20

several days; but at length his reason was restored, his wounds dressed, an=
d he was enabled to=20

proceed to his residence in London. Under the skilful treatment of an emine=
nt surgeon, he=20

thoroughly recovered. Although a trace or two of the flames were indelibly =
marked upon his=20

countenance, they were but faint or slight traces.  Nothing effectual could=
 be done for the=20

preservation of the building. The fire for some time pursued its devastatin=
g course altogether=20

without let or hindrance. At length an engine from the town-hall arrived, a=
nd began to throw a=20

feeble jet of water among the flames. It seemed, however, to produce not th=
e slightest possible=20

effect, and its operation looked very like a satire or mockery. The entire =
of the building was gutted;=20

the whole of the stock, materials, &c., of the factory were consumed; the m=
achinery was rendered=20

useless, and not much less than 20,000_l._ damage was altogether perpetrate=
d; but this included=20

the injury to the old premises, which were insured by the landlord.  I cann=
ot tell how it happened=20

that very imperfect reports of this fire reached London, or were circulated=
 in the newspapers of the=20

district. Perhaps it was, as I have been told, because the local reporter w=
as a man of inferior=20

descriptive power, and unable to give didactic interest or picturesqueness =
to the narrative he=20

wrote, without which, it is needless to inform the reader, no account of an=
y thing is palatable to the=20

reading public, and with which comparatively small matters can be made inte=
resting, or even=20

sensational. Perhaps it was because Mr. Newton's brother and co-partner did=
 not want to invest=20

the case with more importance than he could possibly help, and was indeed r=
ather anxious that no=20

more noise should be made about it than was inevitable. I have heard it sta=
ted that he knew the=20

only representative of the local press in the town, and sought him out, or =
was sought out by him,=20

and that he dictated or inspired the feeble and uninteresting narrative tha=
t was published of the=20

event.  These circumstances or rumours are just of sufficient importance to=
 the developments of=20

the case I am about to describe to justify my stating them.  I should menti=
on that Mr. Henry=20

Newton, the other proprietor of the manufactory, was absent at Birmingham. =
He was indeed=20



travelling on behalf of the firm of which he was a member, and knew nothing=
 of the catastrophe=20

until informed of it by a telegram, when he of course repaired homewards wi=
th all possible speed.=20

The cause of this fire was never certainly ascertained; but a likely hypoth=
esis, which a jury might=20

believe, was that it arose out of the negligence of the gas-fitters. These =
men went to dinner at the=20

same time as the ordinary work-people of the factory; and on doing so, stop=
ped by a wooden plug=20

one end of a gas-pipe that was connected to the metre, and enveloped an unf=
inished joint, also=20

near to the metre, in white lead and tow. The gas at this time was not turn=
ed on at the metre, or so=20

it was thought; and the most mysterious feature of the case is, how it was =
afterwards turned on.=20

This point, however, could not be cleared up, and the _onus_ of so doing di=
d not, of course, rest=20

upon the insured.  In due course a claim was made upon the company. It was =
investigated; and=20

although suspicions were entertained in the neighbourhood of the Mansion Ho=
use, where their=20

office was situate, that the calamity was the work of an incendiary, the fa=
ct could not be proved,=20

and the amount of the insurance was ultimately paid.  Messrs. Newton conten=
ded that the sum=20

they obtained from the fire-office was insufficient to cover the value of t=
heir machinery, stock,=20

fixtures, &c. They further alleged that they had sustained considerable los=
s by the suspension of=20

their trade, and they accordingly brought an action against the gas company=
 who supplied the=20

town, and who had undertaken to lay the pipes in the premises.  This action=
 was defended up to=20

the day of trial, and stood high on the special-jury list at Guildhall one =
morning. The cause=20

immediately preceding it had nearly terminated. The judge was summing up in=
 that cause. A rather=20

numerous body of spectators (among whom I might have been seen) were awaiti=
ng, with various=20

degrees of interest, the case of "Newton _v._ the H---- Gas Company."  At t=
his stage of the case, a=20

consultation across the bar took place between Sergeant Bustle and Mr. Quic=
ke, Q.C., the=20

principal learned counsel or "leaders" for the plaintiff and for the defend=
ant, which ended in their=20

suggesting to his Lordship (Mr. Baron Snapwell) that an arrangement might p=
robably be effected=20

between the parties, if his Lordship would kindly permit the case to stand =
over until to-morrow. His=20

Lordship, with a show of reluctance, but I believe with perfect willingness=
 to get rid of a long and=20

intricate case, consented to the request, and all I have further to tell th=
e reader about it is, that the=20

anticipations of these learned gentlemen were realised.  A compromise was e=
ffected. Messrs.=20

Newton Brothers obtained a rather liberal sum by way of further compensatio=
n for their injuries=20

and loss through the conflagration.  Another extraordinary and suspicious c=
ircumstance was the=20

death shortly afterwards of Mr. Paterson, the late proprietor of this estab=
lishment, to whom Newton=20

Brothers were indebted in a considerable sum. This happened about four mont=
hs after the fire,=20

and under these circumstances. He was living in the town, not having yet de=
termined into what=20

fresh business he would embark, and not, it is believed, having received al=
l the consideration he=20

had bargained for from the firm to whom he had transferred his business.  T=
he Newtons and Mr.=20

Paterson had been passing an evening at the Dove Hotel, and had taken rathe=
r more brandy-and-

water than any rational idea of temperance would sanction. Mr. Paterson lef=
t the Dove before the=20

Newtons.  His way lay across a canal, and in the morning he was found drown=
ed. He had tumbled,=20

as it appeared, somehow over the low parapet into the water. The Newtons le=
ft the house after=20

him, and found their way home to their beds in safety. A coroner's inquest =
sat upon the body of the=20

deceased, and returned an open verdict of "Found drowned." Some people in t=
he town and=20

neighbourhood, among whom were the Newtons, professed much grief at the cal=
amity. The new=20



firm said, indeed, it appeared as if the place and all connected with it we=
re under a spell or a=20

brand. They declared that it seemed as if Providence had resolved nothing s=
hould prosper in=20

connexion with this particular manufactory. How, or for what reason, they c=
ould not tell; but here=20

was the death, it might be by accident, or it might be by suicide, in a sta=
te of drunkenness, of their=20

predecessor, not long after they had lost every thing (as they in the freed=
om of their language said=20

they had) through a fire on the premises.  The insurance company heard of t=
he death of Mr.=20

Paterson, and the secretary got it into his head that the Newtons were ince=
ndiaries and=20

murderers--that they had killed this man for some evil reason best known to=
 themselves. He=20

consulted the solicitors of the company, and they employed me to sift the m=
ystery, and, if it turned=20

out that the secretary's suspicions were justifiable, to spare no trouble o=
r expense in obtaining=20

evidence upon which to prosecute the alleged miscreants.  I went down secre=
tly, and investigated=20

all the circumstances as far as I could. I collected a variety of little sc=
raps of fact, which left no=20

doubt in my mind that the secretary was right. I came, indeed, to the concl=
usion that these=20

Newtons were the vilest wretches who had for a long time been permitted to =
escape the hangman.=20

Yet, frankly let me say, I could not gather enough information on which to =
rest an indictment with=20

the likelihood of securing a conviction.  I need hardly point out to the re=
ader how very complete my=20

evidence must have been before I could have recommended the company to incu=
r the risk of a=20

prosecution. If, for instance, they failed in conclusively establishing the=
 guilt of the insurers, the=20

institution would be irreparably damaged in public estimation. Popular opin=
ion, and newspaper=20

commentators, would say the company set up this odious defence in order to =
escape payment of a=20

just claim. The accused would be elevated into the ranks of martyrdom. The =
company would have=20

to pay all that was demanded from them, with costs, and they might almost a=
s well afterwards give=20

up business, or set the lawyers to work to liquidate the affairs of their i=
nstitution in Chancery. So=20

that after laying my statement in detail before the solicitors of the compa=
ny (who paid me=20

handsomely for my services), they drew up a report with their comments and =
opinions upon my=20

facts; the matter was considered by the board of directors, and there for t=
he time it dropped.  It=20

was not exactly dropped either. I was employed to keep my eye upon the Newt=
ons without=20

intermission for a couple of years, if I felt it necessary to prolong the s=
crutiny so far--which=20

instructions I had no unwillingness to obey.  Through the medium of several=
 of my assistants, who=20

were changed from time to time, the subsequent career of these persons was =
noted down with a=20

degree of accuracy which afterwards proved very useful to the interests of =
metropolitan insurance=20

companies in particular, and to the interests of society and the cause of j=
ustice in general.  Among=20

the persons in the town where the dismantled factory was situate whose acqu=
aintance I made,=20

and whose confidence I thought I had gained, was the widow of the drowned l=
ate proprietor. She=20

grieved over the premature loss of her husband, but had no apparent suspici=
on, or at least=20

disclosed to me no suspicion, that he had met his death by foul play. I, am=
ong other expedients,=20

condoled with her, discoursed about the lamentable effects of intoxication,=
 eulogised the memory=20

of her husband, lightly and softly touching the subject of that peculiar we=
akness for the bottle=20

which had led to his untimely death. But none of these conversations elicit=
ed from her any=20

suggestion that he had been murdered by the Newtons.  Not long after the mo=
ney had been paid I=20

discovered that, clever as I thought I had been, I had been outwitted; but =
not by the Newtons,=20

about whom let there be no further mystery with the reader. They were what =
the secretary had=20



thought, and what I had become convinced--they were vile wretches, fit for =
the hangman, and=20

rotten-ripe for the gallows. I had been outwitted by a woman's ingenuity. N=
o one suspected me or=20

my mission in the town (as it afterwards turned out) except the widow Pater=
son. She had=20

somehow got to know my name and real character, and had been fencing with m=
e or humbugging=20

me, and was prepared, when occasion or opportunity arose, to use me. At the=
 risk of losing some=20

of my _prestige_ with the reader, I am frank enough to fairly admit this.  =
Shortly after Messrs.=20

Newton Brothers had received the reward of their villany from the fears of =
the insurance company,=20

and, so to speak, through the broken links in the evidence of their rascali=
ty and scoundrelism, an=20

anonymous letter was received by me, the substance of which I may communica=
te to the reader. It=20

was a statement in effect that the insurance company had been robbed by the=
 Newtons, who had=20

set fire to their own factory in order to achieve their ends; and that the =
writer was, under proper=20

guarantees, disposed to put me on the track of a successful investigation i=
nto the mystery of the=20

crime. The writer required that I should answer the letter, in the first pl=
ace, by an advertisement in=20

the second column of the _Times_, on the morning of the third day after rec=
eipt of the letter. The=20

form of that advertisement was given me, which I was only to insert if I co=
nsented to the terms,=20

could give the required guarantees, and was prepared to follow up the clue =
to be communicated to=20

me.  I saw the solicitors of the company, and with them saw the secretary, =
when it was arranged=20

that I should accept the terms, see the writer, give the guarantee, and fol=
low up the investigation=20

as it might seem to me expedient, drawing from the company such expenses an=
d remuneration as=20

I might think necessary to incur. After the advertisement, and one or two p=
reliminary letters, I met=20

the writer of the first letter at an appointed place. The writer of that le=
tter was the widow Paterson.=20

She was a remarkable woman, that Mrs. Paterson; by no means handsome or bea=
utiful, yet by no=20

means decidedly the reverse of either. She was not masculine, and she had c=
ertainly none of the=20

delicacies of her sex. She was an unscrupulous, designing, wicked woman, ch=
erishing and=20

respecting her own comfort and material welfare more than any thing else. I=
 believe she was sorry=20

to lose her husband, but anxious to make the best use of her misfortune, an=
d chiefly disappointed=20

when she ascertained that his loss also involved the loss of money due to h=
im which she expected=20

to have had the enjoyment of in connexion with him.  When we met we were a =
little embarrassed.=20

She was startled by the success of her former _ruse_ and concealment. I was=
 disconcerted, if not=20

somewhat humbled, by the then evident truth that I had been all along known=
 to her while I had=20

been, as I thought, pumping her. This embarrassment, however, soon yielded =
to Often the broken=20

character of the country will cause a large gathering storm to break  [Illu=
stration: WHERE THE=20

STORM ENTERED LOUISVILLE.]  up into half a dozen or more of the smaller one=
s, which, in=20

their narrow paths are as destructive as the cyclone.  It is the unexpected=
 that happens. No one=20

experiences so many surprises, or has more pet beliefs upset than that orac=
le of the chimney-

corner, the oldest inhabitant. It was long believed that tornadoes never pa=
ssed over an old Indian=20

camp ground. Whatever the popular opinion of savage intellect, there is mar=
velous confidence in=20

his instinct. Again, it was thought a tornado never would pass over a large=
 city. The storm in=20

question demolished both these =E2=80=9Colde wyves=E2=80=99 tales.=E2=80=9D=
  During March 27th, 1890, the Signal Service=20

Department observed a threatening storm center gather in the southwestern p=
ortion of Wyoming,=20

and start eastward with great rapidity. Notice was promptly given. Railway,=
 telegraph and electric=20

light officials were warned that on Thursday night a hurricane would blow w=
ith a speed of at least=20



fifty miles an hour. Signal Service predictions had sometimes failed, and t=
his last one excited no=20

particular concern. The destroyer came and was gone in two minutes; and blo=
cks on blocks of=20

Louisville were a ghastly ruin.  The tornado was accompanied by a cloud and=
 tremendous rain. To=20

an observer at the Falls, the cloud was seen to come up the gap between the=
 hills which guard the=20

banks of the beautiful Ohio. He described it as =E2=80=9Cballoon-shaped, tw=
isting an attenuated tail to the=20

earth. It emitted a constant fusillade of lightning, and seemed to be compo=
sed of a lurid, snake-like=20

mass of electric currents, whose light would sometimes be extinguished for =
a few moments,=20

making an almost intolerable darkness. It was accompanied by a fearful roar=
, like that of a=20

thousand trains crossing the big bridge at once. It could be seen to strike=
 Louisville, and then with=20

incredible rapidity it leaped the river, churning it into white foam as it =
went toward the Indiana=20

shore.=E2=80=9D  The streets of Louisville parallel to the river are named;=
 those at right angles are=20

numbered from east to west. The section visited may be described as a recta=
ngle a mile square,=20

bounded on the west by Eighteenth street, on the east by Seventh, on the so=
uth by Broadway, and=20

on the north by the Ohio river. It comprehends the business portion of the =
city. Through this district=20

the cyclone swept diagonally from southwest to northeast, crossing the rive=
r and leaving the city at=20

the foot of Seventh street. The business houses or residences of perhaps 10=
,000 people lay in its=20

path.  Two days after the storm, when there had been time for a calm survey=
, its track is thus=20

described by a correspondent of the Associated Press:  =E2=80=9CIt first de=
scended upon the beautiful little=20

suburb of Parkland, southwest of the city, destroying many private residenc=
es. The loss of life was=20

inconsiderable at this initial point, however. Rushing onward toward the no=
rthwest it lifted for a=20

moment above the trees and housetops, and descended again a mile further on=
 at Maple and=20

Eighteenth streets. From this on its pathway is clearly marked. At no time =
did the base of the=20

funnel touch the ground, and one hundred feet higher in the air, it would h=
ave passed by without=20

doing comparatively much damage.  =E2=80=9CThe ruins as they now are often =
show the first, and even the=20

second and third stories of buildings still intact, with the roofs and high=
er stories swept away=20

except in places where the debris from the upper floors crushed in the lowe=
r, and brought the=20

walls down to the ground in total collapse. From Maple and Eighteenth stree=
ts it went northward=20

one block, then west at an angle another block; and then curving to the nor=
theast as far as=20

Magazine and  [Illustration: BAXTER PARK, LOUISVILLE.]  Thirteenth streets.=
 A quick change to=20

the north is perceptible here, and after traveling in that direction two bl=
ocks, another turn to the=20

west. An acute angle was then made, the line turning from Fifteenth street =
northeast to Thirteenth=20

street again; thence, due east to Tenth street, and north a block to Market=
 street. At Thirteenth and=20

Jefferson streets it swept through Baxter Park, doing great damage, and a b=
lock eastward=20

destroyed St. John=E2=80=99s Episcopal Church, in the rectory of which the =
Rev. S. E. Barnwell and his little=20

son were crushed and burned to death, the rest of the family escaping.  =E2=
=80=9CSt. John=E2=80=99s Church is in=20

the street immediately in the rear of the ill-fated Falls City Hall. The ec=
centric monster went on=20

eastward past the Falls City Hall without touching it, and then, as if sudd=
enly recollecting, it swept=20

around the block and started westward on the south side of Market street. H=
ad the change of=20

direction been made a trifle sooner or later Falls City Hall would have esc=
aped, and the dead been=20

numbered within thirty or forty at the most.  =E2=80=9CAs if satisfied with=
 the work accomplished, it turned=20

north again and struck Main street. This thoroughfare is the principal busi=
ness street in the city. It=20

runs parallel with the river from east to west, and but a block south of it=
. It is lined with wholesale=20



houses, and was the solidest part of the city in point of architecture.  =
=E2=80=9CThe tornado reached Main=20

street at Twelfth, and then shaped its course directly east down the middle=
 of the broad street,=20

sweeping away the solid stores and warehouses on both sides. From Twelfth t=
o Seventh streets=20

on Main it is a wholesaling district, and it was practically untenanted at =
that hour. Had the storm=20

come in the daytime and taken the same direction, hundreds who were at thei=
r houses and=20

escaped unhurt would have been killed.  =E2=80=9CAt Seventh street and Main=
 the buildings change in their=20

character. The big Louisville Hotel is on Main between Sixth and Seventh, a=
nd east of the hotel=20

are restaurants, saloons and other hotels which contained thousands of peop=
le at that hour. The=20

tornado chased down Main street, carrying everything before it, passing Ele=
venth street, Tenth,=20

Ninth, Eighth, and Seventh. A block further and the Louisville Hotel, with =
its hundreds of tenants,=20

would have been reached. The escape of the hotel is the strangest incident =
of all. Adjoining it on=20

the west, from whence the storm came, was a three-story building used as a =
saloon on the first=20

floor, and occupied in the upper stories as sleeping apartments for the hot=
el servants. This three-

story building, right under the east wall of the hotel, was totally demolis=
hed and not a timber left a=20

dozen feet higher than the ground. Its inmates were killed. The great hotel=
 shook from roof to=20

cellar with the force of the shock, but it was spared.  =E2=80=9CThe storm =
veered at the sharpest kind of an=20

angle to the north again, crossed Main street, and struck for the river, ta=
king in the Union Depot on=20

the way. Strange to say, although the depot was totally demolished, only on=
e person was killed=20

there. At the point where the tornado crossed the river, between New Albany=
 and Jeffersonville, it=20

is supposed several small crafts were sunk.  =E2=80=9CReaching the opposite=
 bank of the river, the storm=20

turned to the east again and took off a bite from Jeffersonville. It went a=
long Front street for a few=20

blocks, damaging buildings, but causing no loss of life. Then it took to th=
e river and struck the=20

Kentucky shore about four miles east of where it left it, and outside of th=
e city of Louisville. At this=20

exact spot is located the Louisville pumping works, which supplies the whol=
e city with water.  =E2=80=9CThe=20

pumping works were destroyed, and the city is now threatened with a water f=
amine in=20

consequence. The next heard of the peculiar course taken by the tornado is =
from Eminence, Ky.,=20

about forty miles east of Louisville, which was badly damaged by the storm.=
 The intervening=20

country may have suffered somewhat, but no other towns were visited, and fr=
om Eminence the=20

destroyer probably took a final leave of the earth=E2=80=99s surface and pa=
ssed on to the Atlantic Coast at=20

a higher and less dangerous altitude.=E2=80=9D  This outline seems to show =
how easily the course of a=20

storm is modified by the irregularities of surface, even when the obstacles=
 are such as it can=20

overcome. It is seen that the course of a small storm over broken country, =
little resembles the=20

steady curve of the storm in the open sea. Ever and anon, the obstacles bel=
ow momentarily break=20

the regular current, which is as often renewed in a moment by the powerful =
upward suction in the=20

upper air. This is the phenomenon known as =E2=80=9Cjumping,=E2=80=9D which=
 may be repeated till the widening of=20

the center leaves the storm too weak to promptly restore the current at the=
 ground, and the danger=20

from the tornado is over. Some of the apparent eccentricities in the city, =
are doubtless due to the=20

fact that occasional buildings were strong enough to resist; and leaving su=
ch at slight variations in=20

its course, made it present the appearance of doubling on its track.  So ma=
ny blocks of buildings,=20

great and small, in an instant violently hurled to pieces, would seem to in=
fer with certainty the=20

death of nearly all the occupants. That only about a hundred should have be=
en killed outright, was=20

therefore a matter of astonishment no less than of gratitude. The terror an=
d anguish of the first=20



moments or hours could not, however, be measured by the actual calamity to =
human life.=20

Members of households suddenly separated from each other in the darkness, c=
ould only fear the=20

worst.  [Illustration: LOUISVILLE TORNADO--FALLS CITY HALL.]  Their startle=
d imagination saw=20

the missing one dead or dying under the huge piles of fallen buildings. The=
re were excited cries=20

and calls and wailing of the living; a mad rush and frantic tugging at the =
ruins, from beneath which=20

were sometimes heard shrieks for help or groans of the dying. To add to the=
 universal terror, fires=20

broke out in many places, threatening imprisoned wretches with a fate more =
horrible than the=20

crush of falling walls, or timbers, bricks or iron, hurtling through the ai=
r. Before help could reach=20

them the flames took hold on some and hushed their cries forever. Fortunate=
ly, the fire-alarm=20

connections were left intact, and as alarm after alarm was sent, there was =
a dashing of the=20

engines to the rescue, and the whole fire-department was presently engaged =
in extinguishing the=20

flames, or recovering the living and the dead. Hospitals and morgues were s=
uddenly improvised in=20

sheds or shops, where the wounded were cared for, or the dead were deposite=
d to await the=20

recognition or claim of the living.  Falls City Hall was the theatre of the=
 principal loss of life. It was a=20

brick building fronting on Market between Eleventh and Twelfth. The ground-=
floor had long been=20

used as a market, and contained forty or fifty stalls of gardeners and butc=
hers. These stalls were=20

closed and the keepers were absent at the hour of the disaster. In front on=
 the second floor were=20

three small rooms, one of them utilized as an office, the other two as toil=
et rooms. Behind these=20

was a large hall, and in the rear of this still another hall, in which a yo=
ung lady, her father, brother=20

and sister being present, was teaching a dancing school. There might have b=
een sixty-five=20

persons in this room, though one witness says twenty-eight. In one of the s=
mall rooms seven men,=20

constituting the Executive Committee of the Roman Knights, was holding a bu=
siness meeting. In=20

another room a band of musicians, fifteen in number, were going through a r=
ehearsal. Some=20

decorators were at work in the large hall, preparing it for some coming occ=
asion. On the third floor=20

were assembled the Jewel Lodge No. 2 of the Knights and Ladies of Honor, wi=
th an attendance of=20

a hundred or more. In an adjoining hall the Humboldt Lodge No. 146 of I. O.=
 O. F. with seventeen=20

members was in session. The whole number of people in the building must hav=
e been nearly or=20

quite two hundred. In an instant the fearful wrench of the cyclone had twis=
ted the building into=20

fragments, and tumbled it in shapeless ruin upon the inmates.  Ten minutes =
after the collapse=20

might have been seen a frantic multitude hastily gathering from all quarter=
s, among them many=20

women clutching vainly with their fingers at the slate roof, and madly tear=
ing at the wreck beneath=20

which the imprisoned and wounded were crying for help. Presently, fire brok=
e out, but it was=20

happily extinguished. The work of rescue was now organized and speedily set=
 in motion, but an=20

hour elapsed before the first victim was extricated. This was a lady, found=
 sitting upright with=20

bruised head and broken arm. She told of her vain effort to escape, and of =
the position in which=20

she had last seen her companions. Meanwhile, some were digging in the cente=
r of the debris in=20

answer to a voice which grew fainter and fainter until it was hushed foreve=
r. The work of rescue=20

was now shifted to the other end of the pile.  James Hassen was foremost am=
ong the workers,=20

and on reaching the hall room of the Knights and Ladies, he took from the r=
uins the first body,=20

which proved to be that of his wife, and who expired in his arms. He gently=
 laid his dead wife=20

aside, and hurried again to aid in recovering the rest. Presently, ten wome=
n were reached, clasped=20

in each others arms--all dead but one. The dancing room was  [Illustration:=
 AT WORK IN THE=20



WRECK.]  reached. One lady was taken out fatally hurt, and one after anothe=
r her three children,=20

unconscious, but destined to recover. While her husband was urging the resc=
ue of his fourth child,=20

still somewhere beneath the ruins, an under-current of air having been admi=
tted, the fire again=20

broke out with startling fierceness, and the furious heat compelled a suspe=
nsion of the work. The=20

groans of the imprisoned were now changed to fearful shrieks, while the wat=
chers, helpless to=20

render aid, screamed and ran wildly about with anxiety and horror. Three or=
 four lines of hose=20

were turned upon the flames, and they were subdued; but an hour, in which p=
robably many a life=20

went out, had been lost from the work. By twelve o=E2=80=99clock many dead =
and wounded had been=20

removed from the ruins. The dead were largely in the majority. Many of thes=
e exhibited no outward=20

wounds, and had been apparently suffocated by gas escaping from broken pipe=
s.  But the reader=20

may be spared further details of the recovery at Falls City Hall. Suffice i=
t to say, that two days were=20

required to remove the wreck and demonstrate the precise extent of the cala=
mity. On this spot,=20

about eighty persons had lost their lives.  The narratives of some of the s=
urvivors will serve to=20

show that while the tornado comes without warning, the heaviest wind is not=
 just at first: and a cool=20

head may sometimes profit by the interval to escape. Sailors have a saying =
that the =E2=80=9Ctail=E2=80=9D of a gale=20

is strongest. A young man who was taken from the wreck of the hall says:  =
=E2=80=9CI was dancing when a=20

flash of lightning, followed by a crash, made me think that the lightning h=
ad struck some part of the=20

rear of the building. The next moment, the big doors that enter into the bi=
g hall in front flew open. I=20

continued dancing, and cried to some=20


_
insight into a plot of which I had hitherto not had a complete idea.  She c=
ould not positively assert=20

that her husband had been murdered. On that head she had her suspicions, as=
 others had. All she=20

could say distinctly was, that the Newtons had burned down their house. The=
 fact was, that her=20

husband had been embarrassed. The Newtons had seen this, and proposed to hi=
m an elaborate=20

scheme for defrauding the insurance company. The same means would also enab=
le him to get=20

time from his creditors, who might afterwards be arranged with, or "satisfi=
ed" by a bankruptcy, as=20

thereafter should seem desirable. Meanwhile the Newtons and he were to take=
 parts in the great=20

scheme of fraud. They settled between them the extension of the premises an=
d the burning of the=20

manufactory, the claim upon the company, and the division of the spoil. All=
 these arrangements=20

had been carried out, as the reader is aware, except the last part of the p=
rogramme, which was=20

the subject of another fraud, illustrating a truth I have so frequently ins=
isted upon--that there is no=20

honour among thieves.  Newtons might or might not have overtaken Paterson a=
fter he left the=20

Dove, who, being drunk, could not walk towards his home very quickly. They =
might or might not=20

have pitched him over the canal-bridge into the water; but it was clear tha=
t they conceived his=20

death gave an opportunity for cheating him, or rather his widow, out of his=
 share of the proceeds of=20

their joint crime. Mrs. Paterson was in her husband's confidence about the =
destruction of his=20

premises. This was a little circumstance the Newtons were unacquainted with=
. On the other hand,=20

Paterson had often told them that he did not let his wife know every thing,=
 and had so frequently=20

spoken in disrespectful terms of the gentle sex (especially on the score of=
 speech or intrigue), that=20

he led them to believe his wife knew nothing about the conspiracy; but in p=
oint of fact she had=20

been informed all about it. She had held her peace, since Paterson's death,=
 to see how Messrs.=20

Newton would behave when they got the insurance money, secretly having reso=
lved all the while=20

that if they played her false, or did not hand over to her what she conside=
red her fair share, or=20

what it was arranged her husband should have, she would "let the cat out of=
 the bag," and assist=20

the officers of justice in raising that firm to the level of a platform out=
side the county gaol, where=20

Mr. Jack Ketch had previously been known to perform in a few dismal tragedi=
es. When the=20

Newtons got the money she boldly made her demand upon them. They affected t=
o be indignant,=20

and they menaced her with a criminal information for slander, which raised =
her fears a little, for=20

she did not clearly see how she was to establish her case against them. She=
 was lawyer enough=20

to know that in any criminal proceedings against her, her mouth would be sh=
ut, by the forms of=20

that branch of English jurisprudence. It required not much self-possession =
on her part to hold her=20

tongue a while longer, to simulate, if not satisfaction, at least resignati=
on, at the loss of her share=20

of the plunder. She however determined to place herself in communication wi=
th me, in the full=20

reliance that I could with her aid, overtake the villains, who had not been=
 true to their compact of=20

rascality, and get them punished, as they deserved to be, if not for their =
original crimes, for their=20

want of honour to the confederate.  I listened to her story, and noted all =
the circumstances she=20

could relate. I made another report, that went through the same ordeal or c=
eremonial which my=20

former report was submitted to, and with about the like result. This woman'=
s evidence was tainted.=20

She did not indeed want to be brought forward. She trembled under the fear =
of being murdered by=20

some other confederates of the Newtons, if she were the ostensible and avow=
ed agent of their=20

punishment. She wanted "the thing done without using her." It appeared to m=
e, and to the other=20

adviser of the insurance company, that with her evidence a prosecution of t=
he Newtons was not a=20



perfectly safe experiment; and that without such support an indictment was =
an exceedingly=20

dangerous expedient for the company.  It is needless to observe that the di=
sclosures of this=20

woman rendered the fact of the Newtons' crime doubly certain to _us_; but a=
ll that could still be=20

done was to watch and wait another opportunity for bringing these wretches =
to justice.  The=20

explanations which I had from Mrs. Paterson were to the effect that, althou=
gh her husband was=20

pecuniarily embarrassed at the time when he sold the business, a large port=
ion of the money=20

owing was money that he held as trustee, and which, being in the funds, rai=
lway stocks &c., he=20

had the exclusive management of, having taken all the securities several ye=
ars ago out of the=20

hands of the lawyers concerned in the trust. There was no one to check his =
malversation, and by=20

the simple expedient of keeping the interest paid, he escaped detection. At=
 length, finding that the=20

affair was getting beyond his control, the means of his permanently conceal=
ing it being rendered=20

more and more difficult by its magnitude, and the fact that losses in trade=
, perhaps the interest=20

upon the lost capital, swelled up an awful total, he took the Newtons into =
his confidence, and the=20

set devised a scheme for colourably selling his stock-in-trade, fixtures, g=
ood-will, &c., &c., for=20

extending the premises, and so forth, and burning the place down, so as to =
realise a large sum in=20

ready money--considerably more than the value of the things insured. By the=
se means he hoped=20

to retrieve his position as trustee, and put a tidy sum of money in his own=
 pocket--his=20

confederates, the Newtons, of course also profiting somewhat largely.  Pate=
rson was a peculiar=20

and self-reliant man. Moreover, he could not rely upon getting any solicito=
r to enter into such a=20

confederacy. It is absolutely certain that if he could induce any one in th=
e legal profession to join in=20

such a villanous compact, he would have been the very lowest among low atto=
rneys. He would in=20

all probability have known sufficiently well how to screen himself, and als=
o how to swallow and=20

retain the lion's share of the plunder. All these things were evident to Mr=
. Paterson, so he kept the=20

bills of exchange which the Newtons had given him in his own hands, and dre=
ading burglary, or=20

the fraudulent and surreptitious removal of them from the apartments he now=
 occupied during his=20

absence, if an opportunity of any kind were furnished, he usually carried t=
hese documents about=20

with him in his pocket-book when he left home. This was, of course, a dange=
rous plan, and one=20

that any honest man in an ordinary position would not adopt; but perhaps, a=
fter all, it was the=20

safest for such a man as Paterson in the position he then stood.  The Newto=
ns knew of Paterson's=20

fraudulent trusteeship. They were sufficiently in his confidence to have ob=
tained nearly all the=20

information which enabled them to keep him at arm's length. And of course P=
aterson also knew of=20

the exaggerated claim which had been presented to the insurance company, ba=
sed upon=20

inventories and papers supplied to them by him on the transfer of the busin=
ess. It is hard to say=20

that either was more deeply implicated in the villany than the other; altho=
ugh it is clear that=20

Paterson, who stood behind the scenes and was screened from observation by =
the prominent=20

defrauders, was, in reality at least, as deep, and perhaps more deeply, inv=
olved in the swindle and=20

arson than either of the Newtons. The situation of the parties towards each=
 other was not very=20

unlike that thieves ordinarily stand in. One had reason to fear the other, =
and there was in=20

consequence mutual jealousy, distrust, and apprehension.  After leaving the=
 Dove, I had no doubt=20

that the Newtons hastened in the direction that Paterson had, go homewards,=
 and succeeded in=20

overtaking him; that, being partially intoxicated he was easily grasped and=
 held by his whilom=20

confederates, one of whom probably held his hand over the victim's mouth wh=
ile the other hastily=20



seized his pocket-book, removed from it the acceptances which had been give=
n him on the=20

transfer of the business, &c., after which he was pitched into the water. W=
hen taken from the canal=20

and searched, a pocket-book was found upon the close the doors. They did so=
, and were bolting=20

them, when they were again forced open with such force as to knock down eve=
rybody around=20

them. Then the window sashes were blown in, and the building commenced rock=
ing. I saw that the=20

house was about to fall, and I hallooed: =E2=80=98The walls will go next.=
=E2=80=99 I ran to the dressing-room, and I=20

think most of the girls followed me. I got under a table and held fast to t=
he legs, thinking that I=20

might be saved in that way. Then the walls began crumbling, and the lights =
went out, and the floor=20

descended like an elevator. The crash stunned me for a moment, but finally =
a flash of lightning=20

showed me a hole in the debris, through which I might have crawled had not =
my leg been pinioned=20

between some timbers. There were people all around me, and they were crying=
 for help; but there=20

was no one to aid us. I tugged and strained, but I could not get loose. Fin=
ally, I heard my father=E2=80=99s=20

voice, and answered him; and directly he crawled down the hole. It took him=
 three-quarters of an=20

hour to extricate me, and then we both crawled out. If there had been help =
at once, we might have=20

saved others, as I knew about where they all were, but they were more or le=
ss hurt.=E2=80=9D  That less=20

than half of those in the building should have been killed is a matter of w=
onder. The manner of=20

individual escapes can only be inferred from one or two more which we subjo=
in.  One of the lady=20

members of the lodge of the Knights and Ladies of Honor relates:  =E2=80=9C=
I went to attend the lodge=20

meeting and when all were present the calamity came. There must have been a=
bout seventy-five=20

people in the room at the time of the tornado. Hone of them were able to ge=
t out before the=20

building fell in. The first intimation we had of what was coming was the fl=
ash of lightning and the=20

beating of hail against the windows. The wind howled, and I heard a fearful=
 roaring noise. The=20

people became frightened, and hurriedly gathered their wraps together. All =
were fearful of=20

impending danger.  =E2=80=9CJust at this moment I saw a round hole blown th=
rough the wall, immediately=20

above one of the windows. The gas went out and then I saw another large rou=
nd hole appear in=20

the roof. Through this I saw the lightning play with awful grandeur. This n=
atural light was all that=20

relieved the gloom and darkness. I heard one of the trustees of the lodge c=
all out to all the people=20

to go out quickly and in a body. He cried out not to rush, as some one woul=
d be killed if they did.=20

Then I knew no more until I became conscious, and found that I was partiall=
y imbedded in bricks=20

and timbers. I felt blood running down my neck and became aware that I had =
been struck on the=20

head by a brick or timber. I extricated myself, and by the flashes of light=
ning made my way over=20

the terrible mass of debris and dead bodies toward the front. I saw a man m=
aking his way down=20

the pile of bricks to the street, and I followed. When I reached the sidewa=
lk I was aided to a=20

neighboring store by a lodge trustee. I don=E2=80=99t know how he made his =
way out. I heard cries for help=20

as I came out, but I had barely strength to move, and could not help the ot=
hers.=E2=80=9D  A thrilling=20

experience was that of another member of the same lodge. His estimate of th=
e attendance, larger=20

than the foregoing, is yet materially exceeded by others. He says:  =E2=80=
=9CThe first intimations of danger=20

we had were two distinct rockings of the building, about which time a dorme=
r window in the lodge=20

room was blown from its casings, and immediately after the plastering began=
 to drop from the=20

ceiling. A wild rush was made for the ante-room, which carried me with it, =
and I had just reached=20

the door when  [Illustration: MAIN STREET, BETWEEN ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH,=20

LOUISVILLE.]  the entire floor gave way, and we were precipitated to the ba=
sement, blinded and=20



almost suffocated by a cloud of dust, and crushed and jammed by falling tim=
bers. In some way the=20

doorframe fell with me and maintained an upright position when it stopped, =
and I was enabled to=20

extricate myself from the debris and make an exit to the street through an =
adjoining house, whose=20

doors I kicked in. Meanwhile, the shrieks and groans of those still impriso=
ned by the wreck formed=20

a chorus that, in connection with the howling of the storm, made my very he=
art sick. I was, so far=20

as hasty examination went, comparatively uninjured, and at once returned ov=
er the ruins with=20

several men to the rear of the place and extinguished a fire that had begun=
 to blaze fiercely. By=20

this time the rain was falling in torrents, and it was difficult for those =
who had gathered from the=20

neighborhood, or who had been as lucky as I was to escape with life, to tel=
l where to begin the=20

work of rescue.  =E2=80=9CThe vivid lightning flashes only gave momentary v=
iews of the position of the=20

ruins, and blinded everybody. Among those whom I saw and recognized as havi=
ng escaped from=20

Jewel lodge I can name only the treasurer, who was covered with dust, drenc=
hed with rain and=20

well-nigh distracted by the probable fate of her aged father, who had atten=
ded the lodge meeting=20

with her and who was still in the ruins. The entire building collapsed in f=
ront and rear, and of the=20

east and west side walls nothing was standing above the second story.  =E2=
=80=9CSo far as I could judge=20

when I had succeeded in escaping, there were less than a dozen, all told, w=
ho got out unhurt; and=20

the cries for help and groans that issued from the broken and twisted heap =
was proof that scores=20

were still there, unable to escape.=E2=80=9D  The Union Depot was utterly d=
emolished. An officer of the=20

Louisville Southern Road relates the story:  =E2=80=9CQuite a crowd of peop=
le were present waiting for=20

trains. Mr. Woodard, of the Monon Railroad, was near me, and I had been tal=
king to him. The wind=20

was blowing strong, and seemed to increase in power. We heard a dull moanin=
g in the distance,=20

and the glass in the windows of the depot was shattered, although the first=
 puff was merely the=20

advance guard of the tornado. The people became alarmed. One man started to=
 rush into the=20

ticket office, but the ticket-seller pushed him back. Mr. Woodard and I als=
o started for the ticket=20

office. Just at this moment the tornado, like a clap of thunder, struck the=
 depot.  =E2=80=9CThe building gave=20

way and tumbled in upon us. I was just at the door of the ticket office whe=
n it went down. I fell, and=20

a man standing near me fell across me. A heavy girder fell on top of him. M=
r. Woodard was only a=20

few feet away. I never lost consciousness. I spoke to Mr. Woodard and he re=
plied. We both=20

thought we could get out alive if the depot did not catch fire. I knew that=
 there had been stoves=20

with fire burning in them in the depot before the tornado struck it, and I =
expected the flames to=20

break out at every moment.  =E2=80=9CI spoke to the man who was lying acros=
s me and told him that he=20

must manage to squeeze from under the girder. I thought that if he was off =
me I could manage to=20

get out. After many desperate efforts he managed to get from under the gird=
er, but in doing so his=20

bowels were torn so terribly that the doctors do not think he can recover. =
He was a brakeman, who=20

had come here to be a witness in some case. I do not remember his name.  =
=E2=80=9CAfter the brakeman=20

got off me, I was able to use my strength. Then I got out, and so did Mr. W=
oodard. I was under the=20

wreck just thirty-five minutes. I was slightly bruised in the arm and leg, =
but that amounts to=20

nothing.=E2=80=9D  [Illustration: UNION DEPOT, LOUISVILLE.]  Though forty o=
r fifty persons were in the=20

depot at the time, only one, a restaurant boy, was killed; Twenty-one passe=
nger coaches were=20

more or less wrecked. On following days the impression of the ruins upon th=
e beholder was=20

peculiarly gloomy. Instead of the stir of life, the brilliancy of electric =
lights, the scream of whistles=20

and the rumbling of trains, there was a scattered wreck, and comparative si=
lence. A few chickens,=20



liberated from their coop, crept at dusk to roost on a timber, and in subdu=
ed tones seemed to be=20

discussing with each other the mournful situation.     CHAPTER VI  INCIDENT=
S OF THE=20

TORNADO.                  =E2=80=9CO cold and savage wind!     It racks my =
soul to hear the wild lamenting=20

Of wounded hearts whose grief knows no relenting,     Can not their woe e=
=E2=80=99er sway thee to=20

repenting?                 O cold and savage wind!                  O melan=
choly=20


_
the murdered incendiary, and in it all the papers that he was known to carr=
y except the=20

acceptances, which were, to the mind of Mrs. Paterson, painfully conspicuou=
s by their absence.  I=20

have explained that the Newtons did not know that Mrs. Paterson was in her =
husband's=20

confidence; that they imagined she was not; and that he, with a desire for =
counter-check which=20

distinguishes the suspicious, taught them so to believe. He would frequentl=
y say, when Mrs.=20

Paterson's name transpired in their conversations prior and subsequently to=
 the fire, that "he never=20

trusted a woman with a secret of any importance, as she was sure to blab or=
 peach," &c. As I have=20

said, however, he was all the while disclosing to her the conspiracy and pl=
ot. She was thoroughly=20

informed of every circumstance, and knew all about their proceedings from f=
irst to last as well as=20

either of the Newtons did.  After her husband's death, in her emergency, be=
fore seeking me she=20

consulted those well-known criminal lawyers, Messrs. Levy Levy, Brothers, a=
nd Sons, who (except=20

when they attend a police-court, and think a demonstration requisite for th=
e vindication of their skill=20

to the newspaper-reading World, as an advertisement for business in the sam=
e line) conceive that=20

the Carlylese or Chinese motto about silence embodies the prime wisdom or t=
he highest sagacity.=20

They recommended Mrs. Paterson to wait and hold her tongue--for the present=
. She did this until=20

she knew that the money had been paid by the insurance company, of which ci=
rcumstance she=20

then informed her clever Mosaic attorneys. They, upon hearing this circumst=
ance from their client,=20

wisely and shrewdly, perhaps, told her the time had now arrived for action,=
 that they were the=20

people to act, and that she had better leave herself in their hands. To thi=
s she readily consented;=20

for, as I have said, the Newtons inspired her with awe. If she had not been=
 sensible that she had=20

an advantage in her knowledge of them, and that they at the present moment =
had no conception=20

she was aware of their villany, she would have trembled lest, as the greed =
of the brothers led them=20

to the murder of her husband in order to prevent further disclosures, they =
would murder her.  The=20

action of her attorneys was not a very remarkable or, I think, skilful perf=
ormance. One thing to be=20

said is, these gentlemen have an enormous amount of very lucrative business=
, and it does not, I=20

believe, pay them to bestow much thought upon any thing. For instance, when=
 some wholesale=20

forger, some coiner in an extensive way of business, some pivot of pick-poc=
keting or burglary, or=20

the member of any gang, is arrested, he sends immediately for Messrs. Levy =
Levy, Brothers, and=20

Sons, and, to secure their best services, makes them a large payment. They =
hear what he has got=20

to say. They attend the police-court, bully the witnesses for the prosecuti=
on, make every=20

conceivable statement about their client's respectability within the limits=
 that evidence will permit;=20

and although, almost as a matter of course in these cases, the criminal get=
s sent for trial, he goes=20

away to the House of Detention rejoicing in the confident belief that he ha=
s got, at all events, the=20

best criminal lawyers in the country to defend him. When he comes up for tr=
ial, out of the hundred=20

or two hundred pounds or more which Messrs. Levy Levy and family have extra=
cted from the=20

prisoner, his relatives, his connexions, or his gang, these attorneys give =
a brief or a couple of=20

briefs to counsel, which contain little if any thing more than copies of th=
e depositions taken before=20

the magistrates, and on the back of those briefs are severally indorsed, "M=
r. Noxious Sound, 10=20

guineas;" and "Mr. Modest Emptypurse, 2 guineas." The leader of these two  =
   Hast thou no=20

requiem for the dead and dying?     Art thou some fierce despairing spirit =
sighing     O=E2=80=99er a lost=20

Paradise behind thee lying?                 O melancholy wind!=E2=80=9D   T=
oo frequently in the confusion of=20

great disasters the woes of the poorer classes are forgotten in the attenti=
on given to their more=20



opulent neighbors. There is only too often good cause given for a slight mo=
dification of Shylock=E2=80=99s=20

speech, =E2=80=9CHath not a Jew eyes?=E2=80=9D etc. There is no sadder reco=
rd than that so frequently given in a=20

single line: =E2=80=9CDead--a woman, name unknown.=E2=80=9D What fearful he=
art-aches often end in the Potter=E2=80=99s=20

field!  Adjoining the Louisville Hotel was a saloon and cigar store, the ro=
oms over which were=20

occupied by the hotel laundry girls. These were hurled into the cellar, and=
 so tightly wedged that=20

death could not have been long delayed. One was found sitting upright, the =
pallor of death on her=20

face, and agony in every feature. Another lay upon her back, with hands out=
stretched above her=20

head, as though she tried to thrust destruction back. A third was sitting, =
dead; while near by=20

another lay upon her face, as though refusing to behold that which she coul=
d not shun.      =E2=80=9CNor=20

you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,        If memory o=E2=80=99er the=
ir tomb no trophies raise,      Where=20

through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault        The pealing anthem sw=
ells the note of praise.=E2=80=9D=20

Poor laundry girls! Let their dead dust be mentioned with reverence. Had th=
ey been spoiled=20

daughters of wealth and fashion, press reporters would have waxed eloquent =
of their birth, their=20

history, their beauty, their accomplishments, their heritage. We should hav=
e heard in detail the=20

names of their wealthy and mourning friends, and of their impressive obsequ=
ies. Magnificent=20

monuments would have risen to mark their sleeping dust. These five laundry =
girls were taken up=20

tenderly, and two or three days later, together borne without pomp to humbl=
e graves. But is not=20

honest industry in useful avocation toiling for bread a more royal thing th=
an silks and diamonds,=20

bedizzening frivolity and idleness? Is there not in America many a haughty =
heiress, less worthy of=20

our tears, than these?      =E2=80=9CLet not ambition mock their useful toi=

 the ruins. Tragic end of a life=20

of poverty and toil! But when we reflect on the lot of many another sewing =

article among the lot of them--they are not disposed, even under what would=
 to the ordinary=20

solicitor be a temptation of liberal costs, to take a vast deal of trouble,=
 or, as one of them would=20

observe, "put themselves far out of the way."  Messrs. Levy Levy and family=
 wrote to Messrs.=20

Newton Brothers a letter, which stated that they had been called upon and c=

public; often grouping items in a manner that is strikingly grotesque. Ther=
e is no grimmer humor=20

than the apparently matter-of-fact statement that during a great Italian ea=
rthquake, wherein lofty=20

cathedrals were shaken to pieces and hundreds of people killed, statues of =
the Virgin escaped=20

uninjured. Sober-minded people are prone to wonder what is the relative val=
ue of a human life and=20

a graven image. One might, if such things were of constant occurrence, cons=
ider them as meant=20

by Providence as a very sarcastic punishment for the violation of the secon=
