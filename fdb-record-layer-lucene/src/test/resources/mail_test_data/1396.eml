Not content with the success of the cut, funeral, and a week later the landlady sent word that the old professor was dead, and he was to send money for the funeral.  But what was Kupeczky's death to that of Gregorics? _
him gradually from the kneeling camel, and we carried him to the camp, about thirty yards distant. 

He was faint, and I poured some essence of peppermint (the only spirit I possessed) down his 

throat, which quickly revived him. His thigh was broken about eight inches above the knee, but 

fortunately it was a simple fracture.  Abou Do now explained the cause of the accident. While the 

party of camel-men and others were engaged in cutting up the dead elephants, the three 

aggageers had found the track of a bull that had escaped wounded. In that country, where there 

was no drop of water upon the east bank of the Settite for a distance of sixty or seventy miles to 

the river Gash, an elephant if wounded was afraid to trust itself to the interior; one of our escaped 

elephants had therefore returned to the thick jungle, and was tracked by the aggageers to a 

position within two or three hundred yards of the dead elephants. As there were no guns, two of 

the aggageers, utterly reckless of consequences, resolved to ride through the narrow passages 

formed by the large game, and to take their chance with the elephant, sword in hand. Jali, as 

usual, was the first to lead, and upon his little grey mare he advanced with the greatest difficulty 

through the entangled thorns, broken by the passage of heavy game; to the right and left of the 

passage it was impossible to move. Abou Do had wisely dismounted, but Suleiman followed Jali. 

Upon arriving within a few yards of the elephant, which was invisible in the thick thorns, Abou Do 

crept forward on foot, and discovered it standing with ears cocked, evidently waiting for the attack. 

As Jali followed on his light grey mare, the elephant immediately perceived the white colour, and 

at once charged forward. Escape was next to impossible: Jali turned his mare sharp round, and 

she bounded off, but caught in the thorns, the mare fell, throwing her rider in the path of the 

elephant that was within a few feet behind, in full chase. The mare recovered herself in an instant, 

and rushed umbrella, the old boatman shouting after him:  "You're a fool, Janko; come back, don't 

exert yourself for nothing."  Gregorics, afraid the warning would take effect, flew at the old man 

and seized hold of his tie.  "Hold your tongue or I'll murder you. Do you want to ruin me?"  "Well, 

what would that matter? Do you want to throttle me? Leave go of my neck-tie."  "Well, let the boy 

go after my umbrella."  "After all, what is the hen good for if not to look after the chickens?" 

muttered the old boatman. "The current just here is very strong, and he won't be able to reach the 

umbrella. And what's the good of it, when it will come back of itself when the tide turns in half an 

hour's time, to the other side of the 'Yellow.' In half an hour the fishermen will spread their nets, 

and the gentleman's umbrella will be sure to be caught in them; even if a big fish swallows it we 

can cut it open."  And as the old fisherman had said, so it came to pass; the umbrella was caught 

in one of the fishing nets, and great was the joy of old Gregorics when he once more held his 

treasure in his hand. He willingly paid the young fisherman the promised one hundred florins, 

though it was not really he who had brought the umbrella back; and in addition he rewarded the 

fishermen handsomely, who, the next day, spread the tale through the whole town of the old 

madman, who had given one hundred florins for the recovery of an old torn red umbrella. They 

had never before caught such a big fish in the Tisza.  "Perhaps the handle of the umbrella was of 

gold?"  "Not a bit of it; it was only of wood."  "Perhaps the linen was particularly fine?"  "Rubbish! Is 

there any linen in the world worth one hundred florins? It was plain red linen, and even that was 

torn and ragged."  "Then you have not told us the tale properly."  "I've told you the whole truth." 

Kupeczky remarked to Gyuri:  "I would not mind betting the old gentleman has a tile loose."  "A 

strange man, but a good one," answered Gyuri. "Who knows what memories are attached to

the animal, neglected the man, upon whom he trod in the pursuit, thus breaking his thigh. Abou 

Do, who had been between the elephant and Jali, had wisely jumped into the thick thorns, and, as 

the elephant passed him, he again sprang out behind, and followed with his drawn sword, but too 

late to     CHAPTER III.  PAL GREGORICS'S DEATH AND WILL.   No signification was attached 

to the above-mentioned incident till years after, when every one had forgotten all about it, Gyuri 

included. As for Kupeczky, he could not remember it, for as soon as the news came from 

Besztercebanya that old 


_
was the affair of an instant. Jumping over Jali's body, he was just in time to deliver a tremendous 

cut at the hind leg of the elephant, that must otherwise have killed both horses and probably 

Suleiman also, as the three were caught in a cul de sac in a passage that had no outlet, and were 

at the elephant's mercy.  Abou Do seldom rose from it again.  "I am dying, Gyuri," he said to his 

sobbing pupil, "I feel it. It was only Gregorics kept me alive, or rather I kept myself alive for his 

sake. But now I'm done for. I don't know if he has provided for your future, my poor boy, but it's all 

over with me, I'm dying, I wouldn't mind betting it."  And he would have
