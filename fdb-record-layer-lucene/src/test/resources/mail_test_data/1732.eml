g this, various questions were put as to _
ruthlessly torn away from the protection of her dear milor, she had persist=
ently clung to the belief=20

that he would find the means to come to her, to wrest her from the cruel fa=
te which her pitiless=20

enemies had devised for her. She had clung to that hope throughout that dre=
ary journey from dear=20

England to this abominable city. She had clung to it even whilst her father=
 knelt at her feet in an=20

agony of remorse. She had clung to hope while Martin-Roget alternately coax=
ed and terrorised=20

her, while her father was dragged away from her, while she endured untold m=
isery, starvation,=20

humiliation at the hands of Louise Adet: but now--quite unaccountably--that=
 hope seemed=20

suddenly to have fled from her, leaving her lonely and inexpressibly desola=
te. That small,=20

shrunken figure which, wrapped in a dark mantle, had stood in the corner of=
 the room watching her=20

like a serpent watches its prey, had seemed like the forerunner of the fate=
 with which Martin-

Roget, gloating over her helplessness, had already threatened her.  She kne=
w, of course, that=20

neither from him, nor from the callous brute who governed Nantes, could she=
 expect the slightest=20

justice or mercy. She had been brought here by Martin-Roget not only to die=
, but to suffer=20

grievously at his hands in return for a crime for which she personally was =
in no way responsible.=20

To hope for mercy from him at the eleventh hour were worse than futile. Her=
 already overburdened=20

heart ached at thought of her father: he suffered all that she suffered, an=
d in addition he must be=20

tortured with anxiety for her and with remorse. Sometimes she was afraid th=
at under the stress of=20

desperate soul-agony he might perhaps have been led to suicide. She knew no=
thing of what had=20

happened to him, where he was, nor whether privations and lack of food or s=
leep, together with=20

Martin-Roget's threats, had by now weakened his morale and turned his pride=
 into humiliating=20

submission.   II  A distant tower-clock struck the evening hours one after =
the other. Yvonne for the=20

past three days had only been vaguely conscious of time. Martin-Roget had s=
poken of a few=20

hours' respite only, of the proconsul's desire to be soon rid of her. Well!=
 this meant no doubt that=20

the morrow would see the end of it all--the end of her life which such a br=
ief while ago seemed so=20

full of delight, of love and of happiness.  The end of her life! She had ha=
rdly begun to live and her=20

dear milor had whispered to her such sweet promises of endless vistas of bl=
iss.  Yvonne shivered=20

beneath her thin gown. The north-westerly blast came in cruel gusts through=
 the unglazed window=20

and a vague instinct of self-preservation caused Yvonne to seek shelter in =
the one corner of the=20

room where the icy draught did not penetrate quite so freely.  Eight, nine =
and ten struck from the=20

tower-clock far away: she heard these sounds as in a dream. Tired, cold and=
 hungry her vitality at=20

that moment was at its lowest ebb--and, with her back resting against the w=
all she fell presently=20

into a torpor-like sleep.  Suddenly something roused her, and in an instant=
 she sat up--wide-awake=20

and wide-eyed, every one of her senses conscious and on the alert. Somethin=
g had roused her--at=20

first she could not say what it was--or remember. Then presently individual=
 sounds detached=20

themselves from the buzzing in her ears. Hitherto the house had always been=
 so still; except on=20

the take.  Jacques Bourassin was the first man they met on landing, and he =
was enthusiastic=20

about the prospects before them.  Slowfoot was the first woman, and she was=
 quite satisfied--in=20

that amiable state of mental and physical felicity in which it is so easy t=
o believe that "all is for the=20

best."  Her husband soon after appeared.  He, of course, was also greatly p=
leased.  He had joined=20

the fishers because he believed that plenty of food, tea, and tobacco would=
 be going amongst=20

them.  He was not mistaken.  "You will come to my tent," he said, in the we=
alth of his hospitality;=20

"we have plenty of good fish, a very little meat, some tobacco, and oceans =
of tea!"  The six visitors=20



accepted the invitation, and were soon made acquainted with all the gossip =
of the community.=20

"Does it always smoke?" whispered Little Bill to his brother.  The "it" ref=
erred to was Baby La=20

Certe, which had, as usual, possessed itself of its father's pipe when the =
mother was not watching.=20

"I'm not sure, Little Bill, but I think that it does its best."  It was obs=
erved, especially by Fred=20

Jenkins, that the tea-drinking which went on at this place was something ma=
rvellous.  "There's that=20

squaw sittin' there," he said, "she's bin an' swigged three pannikins o' te=
a while I've bin looking at=20

her--an' it's as black as ink.  What's that brown stuff they put into it, d=
oes any one know?"  "That?=20

Why, it is maple sugar," answered Archie, "an' capital stuff it is to eat t=
oo."  "Ah, I know that, for=20

I've ate it in lump, but it can't be so good in tea, I fancy, as or'nary br=
own or white sugar; but it's=20

better than fat, anyhow."  "Fat!" exclaimed Little Bill, "surely you never =
heard of any one taking fat=20

in tea, did you?"  "Ay, that I did.  Men that move about the world see stra=
nge things.  Far stranger=20

things than people invent out o' their own brains.  Why, there was one trib=
e that I saw in the East=20

who putt fat in the tea, an' another putt salt, and after they'd swallowed =
this queer kind of tea-soup,=20

they divided the leaves among themselves an' chawed 'em up like baccy."  Th=
e evident delight=20

with which these half-breeds and more than half-Indians swallowed cup after=
 cup of the blackest=20

and bitterest tea, proved beyond question their appreciation of the article=
, and afforded=20

presumptive evidence at least that tea is not in their case as poisonous as=
 we are taught to=20

believe.  But it was not, as Jenkins remarked, all fair weather, fun, and t=
ea at the fishery.  After the=20

six visitors had been there for a week, shooting and assisting in the canoe=
s, and at the nets, there=20

came a night when the forces of Nature declared war against the half-breeds=
 and those settlers=20

who had cast in their lot with them at that time.  Jenkins, Okematan, and A=
rchie had been out with=20

their guns that day--the last having been promoted to the use of the danger=
ous weapon--and in=20

their wanderings had about nightfall come upon a family of half-breeds name=
d Dobelle, a good-

natured set, who lived, like La Certe, on the _laissez faire_ principle; wh=
o dwelt in a little log-hut of=20

their own construction within the margin of the forest, not far from the sh=
ore of the great lake.  This=20

family, though claiming to be Christian and civilised, was little better th=
an vagrant and savage.=20

They were to some extent as independent as the brute creation around them--=
though of course=20

they betrayed the=20


_
his heavy tread had caused every loose board in the tumble-down house to cr=
eak, it was only=20

Louise Adet's shuffling footsteps which had roused the dormant echoes, when=
 she crept upstairs=20

either to her own room, or to throw a piece of stale bread to her prisoner.=
  But now--it was neither=20

Martin-Roget's heavy footfall nor the shuffling gait of Louise Adet which h=
ad roused Yvonne from=20

her trance-like sleep. It was a gentle, soft, creeping step tea, sugar, and=
 tobacco.  For the rest,=20

their wants were few and easily satisfied.  Snares provided willow-grouse a=
nd rabbits; traps gave=20

them furs and the means of purchasing guns and powder.  Their log-hut was o=
nly an occasional=20

residence.  Wherever night overtook them they were at home.  They camped on=
 the open plains,=20

in the woods, among the rocks, and on the margins of rivers and lakes.  Hea=
lthy, happy, and=20

heedless, the Dobelle family=20


_
mounting the stairs. Yvonne crouching against the wall could count every tr=
ead--now and then a=20

board creaked--now and then the footsteps halted.  Yvonne, wide-eyed, her h=
eart stirred by a=20

nameless terror was watching the door.  The piece of tallow-candle flickere=
d in the draught. Its=20

feeble light just touched the remote corner of the room. And Yvonne heard t=
hose soft, creeping=20

footsteps as they reached the landing and came to a halt outside the door. =
 Every drop of blood in=20

her seemed to be frozen by terror: her knees shook: her heart almost stoppe=
d its beating.  Under=20

the door something small and white had just been passing hour; regarded the=
 past as a=20

convenient magazine from which to draw subjects for gossip and amusement, a=
nd left the future to=20

look after itself.  There were in the hut, when the three visitors entered,=
 old Dobelle, his wife, a=20

daughter of eighteen, another of four, and two sons of twenty and twenty-tw=
o respectively.  "It=20

looks like dirty weather," said Jenkins on entering; "will you let us come =
to an anchor here for a=20

bit?"  "Give us shelter?" explained Archie, who doubted old Dobelle's abili=
ty to understand nautical=20

language.  "You are welcome," said the half-breed, making way politely, and=
 pointing to places on=20

the=20
