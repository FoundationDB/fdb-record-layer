qui s'eleve   entre le=20

Drac et l'Isere etait presque en totalite le domaine   d'une immense famill=

, from the ardour with=20

which this family avenged the smallest injury, came the saying, "_Faire une=
 querelle d'Alleman_;"=20

to which Oudin, in his _Curiosites Francoises_, gives the following interpr=
etation:--    "_Querelle=20

d'Alleman_, fondee sur peu de sujet et facile a   appaiser."  Having refere=
nce to the same family=20

was also the proverb, known in the Dauphine, of fresh linen, including clea=
n napkins, if possible, at=20

every meal, certainly every day at dinner. A large napkin for dinner use is=
 handsome, but it may be=20

too large for convenience. No one wishes to be smothered by a =E2=80=9Cyoun=

Not long ago a friend drove with us by the house of a man whose society man=

upon the veranda of his=20

home. As we approached, and he met our glance, he sprang to his feet, bowed=
 low and remained=20

standing until we had passed.  =E2=80=9CWhat a pretty attention to pay to t=

friend gave a significant shrug, and called our notice to the fact that the=
 man=E2=80=99s wife had, before we=20

came by, driven up to the end of the veranda, and that she was, unaided, cl=
imbing from a high trap=20

in which she and her two little girls had been driving, while her husband l=
olled at ease in a steamer=20

chair. It took the presence of a woman who did not belong to him to bring h=
im to his feet. Looking=20

back, after we had passed, we noted that he had again resumed his lounging =
attitude, and that his=20

wife was lifting the second child from the carriage.  Such is adjustable co=
