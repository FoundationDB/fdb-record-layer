 You see, I was born on=20

a Christmas mornin'--it was in 1840; I was a full grown man when I finally =
got my freedom."=20

"Before I got it, though, I helped a lot of others get theirs. Lawd only kn=
ows how many; might have=20

been as much as two-three hundred. It was 'way more than a hundred, I know.=
  "But that all came=20

after I was a young man--'grown' enough to know a pretty girl when I saw on=
e, and to go chasing=20

after her, too. I was born on a plantation that b'longed to Mr. Jack Tabb i=
n Mason County, just=20

across the river in Kentucky."  "Mr. Tabb was a pretty good man. He used to=
 lost. Lutzen, though=20

in sight, proved not so near as flattering guides and eager eyes had made i=
t. The deep-banked=20

Rippach, its bridge all too narrow for the impetuous columns, the roads hea=

the march. A skirmish with some Imperial cavalry under Isolani wasted minut=
es when minutes=20

were years; and the short November day was at an end when the Swede reached=
 the plain of=20

Lutzen.  No military advantage marks the spot where the storm overtook the =
Duke of Friedland. He=20

was caught like a traveller in a tempest off a shelterless plain, and had n=
othing for it but to bide the=20

brunt. What could be done with ditches, two windmills, a mud=20


_
nearly so much as others did, some of his own kin people, even. But he was =
kinda funny=20

sometimes; he used to have a special slave who didn't have nothin' to do bu=
t teach the rest of us--

we had about ten on the plantation, and a lot on the other plantations near=
 us--how to read and=20

write and figger. Mr. Tabb liked us to know how to figger. But sometimes wh=
en he would send for=20

us and we would be a long time comin', he would ask us where we had been. I=
f we told him we=20

had been learnin' to read, he would near beat the daylights out of us--afte=
r gettin' somebody to=20

teach us; I think he did some of that so that the other owners wouldn't say=
 he was spoilin' his=20

slaves."  "He was funny about us marryin', too. He would let us go a-courti=
n' on the other=20

plantations near anytime we liked, if we were good, and if we found somebod=
y we wanted to=20

marry, and she was on a plantation that b'longed to one of his kin folks or=
 a friend, he would swap=20

a slave so that the husband and wife could be together. Sometimes, when he =
couldn't do this, he=20

would let a slave work all day on his plantation, and live with his wife at=
 night on her plantation.=20

Some of the other owners was always talking about his spoilin' us."  "He wa=
sn't a Dimmacrat like=20

the rest of 'em in the county; he belonged to the 'know-nothin' party' and =
he was a real leader in it.=20

He used to always be makin' speeches, and sometimes his best friends wouldn=
't be speaking to=20

him for days at a time."  "Mr. Tabb was always specially good to me. He use=
d to let me go all=20

about--I guess he had to; couldn't get too much work out of me even when he=
 kept me right under=20

his eyes. I learned fast, too, and I think he kinda liked that. He used to =
call Sandy Davis, the slave=20

who taught me, 'the smartest Nigger in Kentucky.'  "It was 'cause he used t=
o let me go around in=20

the day and night so much that I came to be the one who carried the runnin'=
 away slaves over the=20

river. It was funny the way I started it too."  "I didn't have no idea of e=
ver gettin' mixed up in any=20

sort of business like that until one special night. I hadn't even thought o=
f rowing across the river=20

myself."  "But one night I had gone on another plantation 'courtin,' and th=
e old woman whose=20

house I went to told me she had a real pretty girl there who wanted to go a=
cross the river and=20

would I take her? I was scared and backed out in a hurry. But then I saw th=
e girl, and she was=20

such a pretty little thing, brown-skinned and kinda rosy, and looking as sc=
ared as I was feelin', so it=20

wasn't long before I was listenin' to the old woman tell me when to take he=
r and where to leave her=20

on the other side."  "I didn't have nerve enough to do it that night, thoug=
h, and I told them to wait=20

for me until tomorrow night. All the next day I kept seeing Mister Tabb lay=
ing a rawhide across my=20

back, or shootin' me, and kept seeing that scared little brown girl back at=
 the house, looking at me=20

with her big eyes and asking me if I wouldn't just row her across to Ripley=
. Me and Mr. Tabb lost,=20

and soon as dust settled that night, I was at the old lady's house."  "I do=
n't know how I ever rowed=20

the boat across the river the current was strong and I was trembling. I cou=
ldn't see a thing there in=20

the dark, but I felt that girl's eyes. We didn't dare to whisper, so I coul=
dn't tell her how sure I was=20

that Mr. Tabb or some of the others owners would 'tear me up' when they fou=
nd out what I had=20

done. I just knew they would find out."  "I was worried, too, about where t=
o put her out of the boat. I=20

couldn't ride her across the river all night, and I didn't know a thing abo=
ut the other side. I had=20

heard a lot about it from other slaves but I thought it was just about like=
 Mason County, with slaves=20

and masters, overseers and rawhides; and so, I just knew that if I pulled t=
he boat up and went to=20

asking people where to take her I would get a beating or get killed."  "I d=
on't know whether it=20

seemed like a long time or a short time, now--it's so long ago; I know it w=
as a long time rowing=20

there in the cold and worryin'. But it was short, too, 'cause as soon as I =
did get on the other side=20



the big-eyed, brown-skin girl would be gone. Well, pretty soon I saw a tall=
 light and I remembered=20

what the old lady had told me about looking for that light and rowing to it=
. I did; and when I got up=20

to it, two men reached down and grabbed her; I started tremblin' all over a=
gain, and prayin'. Then,=20

one of the men took my arm and I just felt down inside of me that the Lord =
had got ready for me.=20

'You hungry, Boy?' is what he asked me, and if he hadn't been holdin' me I =
think I would have fell=20

backward into the river."  "That was my first trip; it took me a long time =
to get over my scared=20

feelin', but I finally did, and I soon found myself goin' back across the r=
iver, with two and three=20

people, and sometimes a whole boatload. I got so I used to make three and f=
our trips a month.=20

"What did my passengers look like? I can't tell you any more about it than =
you can, and you wasn't=20

there. After that first girl--no, I never did see her again--I never saw my=
 passengers. I would have=20

to be the "black nights" of the moon when I would carry them, did, moving f=
rom point to point=20

during the long night; and before morning all his troops, except Pappenheim=
's division, had come=20

in and were in line.  When the morning broke a heavy fog lay on the ground.=
 Historians have not=20

failed to remark that there is a sympathy in things, and that the day was l=
oath to dawn which was=20

to be the last day of Gustavus. But if Nature sympathized with Gustavus, sh=
e chose a bad mode of=20

showing her sympathy, for while the fog prevented the Swedes from advancing=
, part of=20

Pappenheim's corps arrived. After prayers, the king and all his army sang L=
uther's hymn, "Our=20

God is a strong tower"--the Marseillaise of the militant Reformation. Then =
Gustavus mounted his=20

horse, and addressed the different divisions, adjuring them by their victor=
ious name, by the=20

memory of the Breitenfeld, by the great cause whose issue hung upon their s=
words, to fight well=20

for that cause, for their country and their God. His heart was uplifted at =
Lutzen, with that Hebrew=20

fervour which uplifted the heart of Cromwell at Dunbar. Old wounds made it =
irksome to him to=20

wear a cuirass. "God," he said, "shall be my armour this day".  Wallenstein=
 has been much belied=20

if he thought of anything that morning more religious than the order of bat=
tle, which has been=20

preserved, drawn up by his own hand, and in which his troops are seen still=
 formed in heavy=20

masses, in contrast to the lighter formations of Gustavus. He was carried d=
own his lines in a litter=20

being crippled by gout, which the surgeons of that day had tried to cure by=
 cutting into the flesh.=20

But when the action began, he placed his mangled foot in a stirrup lined wi=
th silk, and mounted the=20

small charger, the skin of which is still shown in the deserted palace of h=
is pride. We may be sure=20

that confidence sat undisturbed upon his brow; but in his heart he must hav=
e felt that though he=20

had brave men around him, the Swedes, fighting for their cause under their =
king, were more than=20

men; and that in the balance of battle then held out, his scale had kicked =
the beam. There can=20

hardly be a harder trial for human fortitude than to command in a great act=
ion on the weaker side.=20

Villeneuve was a brave man, though an unfortunate admiral, but he owned tha=
t his heart sank=20

within him at Trafalgar when he saw Nelson bearing down.  "God with us," wa=
s the Swedish battle=20

cry. On the other side the words "Jesu-Maria" passed round, as twenty-five =
thousand of the most=20

godless and lawless ruffians the world ever saw, stood to the arms which th=
ey had imbrued in the=20

blood not of soldiers only, but of women and children of captured towns. Do=
ubtless many a wild=20

Walloon and savage Croat, many a fierce Spaniard and cruel Italian, who had=
 butchered and=20

tortured at Magdeburg, was here come to bite the dust. These men were child=
ren of the camp and=20

the battlefield, long familiar with every form of death, yet, had they know=
n what a day was now=20

before them, they might have felt like a recruit on the morning of his firs=
t field. Some were=20



afterwards broken or beheaded for misconduct before the enemy; others earne=
d rich rewards.=20

Most paid, like men of honour, the price for which they were allowed to glu=
t every lust and revel in=20

every kind of crime.  At nine the sky began to clear, straggling shots told=
 that the armies were=20

catching sight of each other, and a red glare broke the mist, where the Imp=
erialists had set fire to=20

Lutzen to cover their right. At ten Gustavus placed himself at the head of =
his cavalry. War has now=20

changed; and the telescope is the general's sword. Yet we cannot help feeli=
ng that the gallant=20

king, who cast in his own life with the lives of the peasants he had drawn =
from their Swedish=20

homes, is a nobler figure than the great Emperor who, on the same plains, t=
wo centuries=20

afterwards, ordered to their death the masses of youthful valour sent by a =
ruthless conscription to=20

feed the vanity of a heart of clay. The Swedes, after the manner of war in =
that fierce and hardy=20

age, fell at once with their main force on the whole of the Imperial line. =
On the left, after a=20

murderous struggle, they gained ground and took the enemy's guns. But on th=
e right the=20

Imperialists held firm, and while Gustavus was carrying victory with him to=
 that quarter,=20

Wallenstein restored the day upon the right. Again Gustavus hurried to that=
 part of the field. Again=20

the Imperialists gave way, and Gustavus, uncovering his head, thanked God f=
or his victory. At this=20

moment it seems the mist returned. The Swedes were confused and lost their =
advantage. A horse,=20

too well known, ran riderless down their line, and when their cavalry next =
advanced, they found the=20

stripped and mangled body of their king. According to the most credible wit=
ness, Gustavus who=20

had galloped forward to see how his advantage might be best followed up, go=
t too near the=20

enemy, was shot first in the arm, then in the back, and fell from his horse=
. A party of Imperial=20

cuirassiers came up, and learning from the wounded man himself who he was, =
finished the work=20

of death. They then stripped the body for proofs of their great enemy's fat=
e and relics of the mighty=20

slain. Dark reports of treason were spread abroad, and=20


_
out in the open or in a house without a single light. The only way I knew w=
ho they were was to ask=20

them; "What you say?" And they would answer, "Menare." I don't know what th=
at word meant--it=20

came from the Bible. I only know that that was the password I used, and all=
 of them that I took=20

over told it to me before I took them.  "I guess you wonder what I did with=
 them after I got them=20

over the river. Well, there in Ripley was a man named Mr. Rankins; I think =
the rest of his name=20

was John. He had a regular station there on his place for escaping slaves. =
You see, Ohio was a=20

free state and once they the Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, who was with Gustavus =
that day, through=20

his questionable life to his unhappy end. In those times a great man could =
scarcely die without=20

suspicion of foul play, and in all times men are unwilling to believe that =
a life on which the destiny=20

of a cause or a nation hangs can be swept away by the blind, indiscriminate=
 hand of common=20

death.  Gustavus dead, the first thought of his officers was retreat; and t=
hat thought was his best=20

eulogy. Their second thought was revenge. Yet so great was the discourageme=
nt that one=20

Swedish colonel refused to advance, and Bernard of=20


_
over the river from Kentucky or Virginia. Mr. Rankins could strut them all =
around town, and nobody=20

would bother 'em. The only reason we used to land quietly at night was so t=
hat whoever brought=20

'em could go back for more, and because we had to be careful that none of t=
he owners had=20

followed us. Every once in a while they would follow a boat and catch their=
 slaves back.=20

Sometimes they would shoot at whoever was trying to save the poor devils.  =
"Mr. Rankins had a=20

regular 'station' for the slaves. He had a big lighthouse in his yard, abou=
t thirty feet high and he=20

kept it burnin' all night. It always meant freedom for slave if he could ge=
t to this light.  "Sometimes=20

Mr. Rankins would have twenty or thirty slaves that had run away on his pla=
ce at the time. It must=20

have cost him a whole lots to keep them and feed 'em, but I think some of h=
is friends helped him.=20

"Those who wanted to stay Again the struggle began, and with all the mornin=
g's fury. Wallenstein=20

had used his respite well. He knew that his great antagonist was dead, and =
that he was now the=20

master-spirit on the field. And with friendly night near, and victory withi=
n his grasp, he directed in=20

person the most desperate combat, prodigal of the life on which, according =
to his enemies, his=20

treasonable projects hung. Yet the day was again going against him, when th=
e remainder of=20

Pappenheim's corps arrived, and the road was once more opened to victory by=
 a charge which=20

cost Pappenheim his own life. At four o'clock the battle was at its last ga=
sp. The carnage had been=20

fearful on both sides, and as fearful was the exhaustion. For six hours alm=
ost every man in both=20

armies had borne the terrible excitement of mortal combat with pike and swo=

excitement had been strained by general charges to=20

be walking along free=20

one night, feel a hand over your mouth, and be back across the river and in=
 slavery again in the=20

morning. And nobody in the world ever got a chance to know as much misery a=
s a slave that had=20

escaped and been caught.  "So a whole lot of 'em went on North to other par=
ts of Ohio, or to New=20

York, Chicago or Canada; Canada was popular then because all of the slaves =

make. Then Wallenstein gave the signal for retreat, welcome to the bravest,=
