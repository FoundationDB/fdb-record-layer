SIR,=E2=80=94Last night, through a break in the clouds, I managed to get my=
 first look with the telescope=20

(an 8-1/2). I turned it on delta Cygni. The definition was rather flutterin=
g, but a 6-1/2 in. stop=20

enabled me to see it well with 170; the first time I have ever divided this=
 star[2] the colour was=20

obvious. I then tried Pi Aquil=C3=A6, which was beautifully divided. I am m=
uch pleased with the=20

instrument and its performance, and when I do get a fine night I expect gre=
at things from my 8-1/2=20

in.                                                        Yours truly,    =

  DEAR SIR,=E2=80=94As to the adjustments=20

of the 8-1/2 in., I have had very little trouble, and I have tried it again=
 on a few objects, a few nights=20

ago, and with a 7 in. stop, and a power of 300, I split Zeta Cancri and the=
 close double _sf_=20

Castor; with the full aperture they were very easy. I have also split Gamma=
 Andromed=C3=A6 with 7 in.=20

stop, and on a very fine night. I believe 6-1/2 in. would do it.  I just go=
t a look, on November 7th, at=20

the shadow of Titan, on Saturn=E2=80=99s disc; but was driven inside before=
 I could observe the time of its=20

passing the centre. I have seen the Moon on two occasions with the finest d=
efinition I ever saw.=20

Altogether I am highly pleased and proud of my telescope. I have not yet tr=
ied many faint objects;=20

still I saw the Crab nebula in Taurus much nearer Lord Rosse=E2=80=99s draw=
ings than Herschel=E2=80=99s, as=20

it with _your_ flat, and I have no difficulty in seeing star disks when the=
 air is good.=20

pleased indeed with last night=E2=80=99s observations with your 18. The sta=
r disks were good and well=20

condensed, and stray light well gathered in, and when a good night comes I =
have no doubt of it.=20

The markings on Mars were well defined. I find the advantage of a large ape=
rture shows itself. I=20

have no doubt I picked up the outer Satellite, but cannot be certain till t=
o-night, if I am permitted to=20

see it. The only objection I have is its short focus, as it seriously compl=
icates my labours in=20

matching the secondary convexes for the Cassegrain form=E2=80=94if you can =
help me in the matter of a=20
