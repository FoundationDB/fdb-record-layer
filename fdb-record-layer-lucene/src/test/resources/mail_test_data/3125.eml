eland season=E2=80=94so there was a great deal to talk about. There had bee=
n deaths and births and marriages which required a flying comment=E2=80=94a=
ll important events; deaths which solved many difficulties, heirs to estate=
s which were not expected, _
were due from Rome. They were both travel-worn and had not much to tell. Th=
eir business in=20

Rome had been transacted. No, they were not hungry; they had dined in the s=
leeping-car.  The=20

next day, as gently as possible, Haggard broke to his wife the fact that it=
 was incumbent upon him=20

to start at once for his American property. The blow came not unexpectedly,=
 and Georgie made=20

the best of it. But the husband stayed a couple of days in Geneva; there we=
re papers to sign in=20

reference to the little villa, a pair of ponies had to be bought; and the n=
umerous little matters of=20

business to settle, which somehow or other it falls invariably to the lot o=
f man to transact.  The=20

parting came at last; it took place on the platform of the station. There i=
s among women always a=20

melancholy satisfaction in seeing the very last of the beloved object. Geor=
gie was no exception to=20

the rule. Spunyarn, who was to accompany his friend, at a discreet distance=
 was laughing and=20

chatting merrily with the younger girl. True that at one time there had bee=
n rumours of an=20

attachment between the pair; we, who are behind the scenes, know that both =
were perfectly=20

heartwhole.  "Will the train never start, Lord Spunyarn? I'm afraid all thi=
s will upset my cousin;=20

these partings are dreadful things after all."  "Think what my feelings mus=
t be, Miss Warrender. I,=20

who have been congratulated by my friends over and over again in reference =
to my supposed=20

good luck, and who will have now to face the fire of their chaff at my crue=
l rejection."  "Your=20

lordship seems to bear it bravely enough."  "With profoundest equanimity, M=
iss Warrender. I leave=20

the lady who has rejected me, in maiden meditation fancy free, at least, I =
suppose so; that thought=20

is balm to my wounded soul. Hope, they say, springs eternal in the human br=
east. Miss Warrender=20

may yet change her mind."  "She will not fail to let you know by telegram s=
hould that unlikely event=20

occur, Lord Spunyarn."  "I'm afraid you've destroyed my future peace of min=
d. I now shall never=20

hear a double knock with equanimity; depend upon it our time has not yet co=
me."  "Yours has at all=20

events, Lord Spunyarn, for if you don't get in you will certainly be left b=
ehind."  "Good-bye, then,=20

Miss Warrender; parting is such sweet sorrow, I e'en could say good-bye unt=
il to-morrow."  "Now=20

that is very sweet of you. I little thought you were Romeo still."  "Now an=
d ever, Miss Warrender,"=20

said the young man with mock passion, as they laughingly shook hands, and h=
e hastened to enter=20

the carriage. "One thing I have forgotten, though," he said, "don't let you=
r cousin see the Society=20

papers."  The parting between Haggard and his wife was necessarily what suc=
h partings usually=20

are: it was painful to both; it would not be amusing to the reader.  Georgi=
e's eyes were full of tears=20

as her husband embraced her for the last time. He only tore himself from he=
r reluctant arms as the=20

final whistle sounded from the engine. As the train slowly moved from the p=
latform, the girls=20

walked hurriedly along for a few yards. Haggard leant from the window, wavi=
ng his hand; his wife=20

gazed after the vanishing train, standing like Niobe, dissolved in tears.  =
Even Haggard, case-

hardened as he was, didn't light his cigar for full twenty minutes.  That e=
vening Lucy Warrender=20

obtained with some difficulty a copy of '_The Sphere_;' this is what she re=
ad there:  "Seldom=20

indeed now-a-days do Englishmen fight duels. In this they are wise, for wit=
h us the man who fights=20

a duel receives no sympathy, and what is more unpleasant, generally becomes=
 an object of=20

ridicule. Sometimes, however, a duel is unavoidable. We understand that thi=
s was the case in the=20

late unfortunate affair at Rome. The provocation was given by the man who f=
ell. M. Barbiche was=20

well known in London society. As usual, the cause of the quarrel was a lady=
. A correspondent in=20

Rome, upon whose information we can rely, informs us that a blow was struck=
 by Mr. R---- H----,=20

but only after the grossest provocation. The meeting took place within twen=
ty-four hours;=20



unfortunately the result was fatal. The survivor and the seconds of both pa=
rties crossed the frontier=20

at once, but one of the friends of the deceased took the precaution to draw=
 up a _proces verbal_=20

of the affair before he left, and transmitted it to the authorities. Societ=
y in Rome has been stirred to=20

its foundations, for both the parties were well known. The weapons were sab=
res. We understand=20

that the seconds of Mr. R---- H----, a well-known sporting nobleman and Gen=
eral C----, are, as well=20

as their principal, members of the P----m Club. General C---- is now in Eng=
land."  To Lucy=20

Warrender, who now heard of the matter for the first time, these initials w=
ere no enigma. The=20

cause of Haggard's mysterious detention in Rome, and of their own sudden fl=
itting, became at=20

once clear to her. "It was very thoughtful of Spunyarn," she said to hersel=
f; "he was quite right,=20

Georgie certainly shouldn't see this."  The careful Lucy took every precaut=
ion. The consequences=20

of the incident at Papayani's ball remained a secret to the young wife.  Th=
e ladies were glad of the=20

temporary excitement of their move to the Villa Lambert, which they made th=
e day after the=20

departure of the two men. And now commenced a life of seclusion and retirem=
ent, which both of=20

them enjoyed from its very novelty. The old quiet life that they had led at=
 The Warren seemed to=20

recommence once more. They gardened, they drove out, they rowed and sailed =
upon the lake, but=20

they declined all acquaintances. The life was monotonous enough and devoid =
of incident.=20

Hephzibah Wallis had recovered her spirits, her Swiss lover was more attent=
ive than ever; he=20

escorted her on a Sunday evening to the Protestant place of worship, and th=
ough she didn't=20

understand a word, Hephzibah enjoyed the service. In the mysterious rite of=
 "walking out" going to=20

church together forms an important factor; it is the outward and visible si=
gn of "keeping company;"=20

it is the inevitable step to being "asked in church," a kind of probationar=
y period, a sort of trial trip.=20

Mr. Capt was more loquacious than the British man-servant, under similar ci=
rcumstances, would=20

be. He was never tired of drawing out Miss Wallis on the subject of her you=
ng mistresses. The=20

juvenile escapades of the younger of them were to him a source of endless a=
musement; he heard=20

all that his inamorata had to tell, nay his interest was so great in her ar=
tless narratives that he=20

would make her repeat them over and over again. The Swiss soon found out th=
at in Hephzibah he=20

was dealing with a truthful girl; for the tale, though oft repeated, never =
varied. What girl has any=20

secret from the man she loves? Hephzibah Wallis formed no exception to the =
rule. But it never=20

dawned on her, at least not then, that she was being "pumped." She put down=
 Mr. Capt's=20

complaisance to his interest in her; and though, as servants will, she at t=
imes asked him questions=20

about his master, she merely admired him the more when they were dexterousl=
y parried, for the=20

confidential valet, in regard to Haggard, ever remained discretion itself. =
 Great was Georgie's=20

delight when she got the first letter from her husband. Till now they had n=
ever been separated; is it=20

to be wondered at, then, that she locked herself up with the treasure? Afte=
r the usual protestations=20

and the regulation amount of sentiment, sentiment which, hackneyed though i=
t was, brought ready=20

tears of pleasure into the young wife's eyes, Haggard announced his immedia=
te departure by the=20

mail steamer. "I'm off to-morrow, Georgie," he said, "for I find life in Lo=
ndon without you perfectly=20

unbearable. I am hastening my departure that we may the sooner meet again,"=
 here followed=20

several sentences of the usual thing. The fact was that Haggard found himse=
lf once more a sort of=20

lion in spite of himself, but he also detected a rather chilling reception =
in many quarters; he was=20

most gushingly received by the least reputable of his lady acquaintances. M=
rs. Charmington, in a=20

long _tete-a-tete_ with which she had favoured him, had called him "her her=
o." But Mrs.=20



Charmington was already on the wane, and as he had no wish to be her hero n=
ow he rather fought=20

shy of her. At the Pandemonium he was as popular as ever, rather more so in=
 fact; for since the=20

baccarat affair, particularly as he was away, he had acted as a sort of sca=
pegoat for the sins of the=20

many. It was rather a nuisance, too, to find that wherever he went he excit=
ed a considerable=20

amount of attention. Even when seated in the stalls of his favourite theatr=
es, those temples where=20

the sacred lamp of burlesque is so carefully tended, it was annoying to fin=
d the glances of all those=20

airily-costumed and magnificently-developed females, who are known as the L=
otties and the=20

Totties, concentrated on himself.  He had received no invitation to go down=
 to The Warren, but his=20

father the Justice had written him in no measured terms.  "I had thought," =
he said, "that by this=20

time you would have got tired of making an ass of yourself; you'd better gi=
ve old Warrender a wide=20

berth; he is furious."  All these things then tended to make a long stay in=
 town distasteful to=20

Haggard, so he went down to Southampton, took his passage for Mexico in tha=
t magnificent=20

steam-ship, the "Capua," and he started, feeling himself an ill-used man.  =

=9D  Lothair seemed plunged in=20

thought, and Father Coleman glided away as Lady St. Jerome entered the gall=
ery, shawled and=20

bonneted, accompanied by another priest, Monsignore Catesby.  Catesby was a=
 youthful member=20

of an ancient English house, which for many generations had without a murmu=
r, rather in a spirit of=20

triumph, made every worldly sacrifice for the Church and court of Rome. For=
 that cause they had=20

forfeited their lives, broad estates, and all the honors of a lofty station=
 in their own land. Reginald=20

Catesby, with considerable abilities, trained with consummate skill, inheri=
ted their determined will,=20

and the traditionary beauty of their form and countenance. His manners were=
 winning, and, he=20

was as well informed in the ways of the world as he was in the works of the=
 great casuists.  =E2=80=9CMy=20

lord has ordered the charbanc, and is going to drive us all to Chart, where=
 we will lunch,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lady St. Jerome; =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98tis a curious place, and was planted, on=
ly seventy years ago, by my lord=E2=80=99s=20

grandfather, entirely with spruce-firs, but with so much care and skill, gi=
ving each plant and tree=20

ample distance, that they have risen to the noblest proportions, with all t=
heir green branches far-

spreading on the ground like huge fans.=E2=80=9D  It was only a drive of th=
ree or four miles entirely in the=20

park. This was a district that had been added to the ancient enclosure=E2=
=80=94a striking scene. It was a=20

forest of firs, but quite unlike such as might be met with in the north of =
Europe or of America. Every=20

tree was perfect=E2=80=94huge and complete, and full of massy grace. Nothin=
g else was permitted to=20

grow there except juniper, of which there were abounding and wondrous group=
s, green and spiral;=20

the whole contrasting with the tall brown fern, of which there were quantit=
ies about, cut for the=20

deer.  The turf was dry and mossy, and the air pleasant. It was a balmy day=
. They sat down by the=20

great trees, the servants opened the luncheon-baskets, which were a present=
 from Balmoral. Lady=20

St. Jerome was seldom seen to greater advantage than distributing her viand=
s under such=20

circumstances. Never was such gay and graceful hospitality. Lothair was qui=
te fascinated as she=20

playfully thrust a paper of lobster-sandwiches into his hand, and enjoined =
Monsignore Catesby to=20

fill his tumbler with Chablis.  =E2=80=9CI wish Father Coleman were here,=
=E2=80=9D said Lothair to Miss Arundel.=20

=E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel.  =E2=80=9CBecause we were in the =
midst of a very interesting conversation on=20

idolatry and on worship in groves, when Lady St. Jerome summoned us to our =
drive. This seems a=20

grove where one might worship.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CFather Coleman ought to b=
e at Rome,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel. =E2=80=9CHe=20

was to have passed Holy Week there. I know not why he changed his plans.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAre you angry with=20

him for it?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, not angry, but surprised; surprised that=
 any one might be at Rome, and yet be=20

absent from it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou like Rome?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have=
 never been there. It is the wish of my life.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMay I say=
=20



to you what you said to me just now=E2=80=94why?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNatural=
ly, because I would wish to witness the=20

ceremonies of the Church in their most perfect form.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut=
 they are fulfilled in this country, I have=20

heard, with much splendor and precision.=E2=80=9D  Miss Arundel shook her h=
ead.  =E2=80=9COh! no,=E2=80=9D she said; =E2=80=9Cin=20

this country we are only just emerging from the catacombs. If the ceremonie=
s of the Church were=20

adequately fulfilled in England, we should hear very little of English infi=
delity.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThat is saying a=20

great deal,=E2=80=9D observed Lothair, inquiringly.  =E2=80=9CHad I that co=
mmand of wealth of which we hear so=20

much in the present day, and with which the possessors seem to know so litt=
le what to do, I would=20

purchase some of those squalid streets in Westminster, which are the shame =
of the metropolis,=20

and clear a great space and build a real cathedral, where the worship of he=
aven should be=20

perpetually conducted in the full spirit of the ordinances of the Church. I=
 believe, were this done,=20

even this country might be saved.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 16 Lothair began t=
o meditate on two great=20

ideas=E2=80=94the reconciliation of Christendom, and the influence of archi=
tecture on religion. If the=20

differences between the Roman and Anglican Churches, and between the papacy=
 and=20

Protestantism generally arose, as Father Coleman assured him, and seemed to=
 prove, in mere=20

misconception, reconciliation, though difficult, did not seem impossible, a=
nd appeared to be one of=20

the most efficient modes of defeating the atheists. It was a result which, =
of course, mainly=20

depended on the authority of Reason; but the power of the imagination might=
 also be enlisted in=20

the good cause through the influence of the fine arts, of which the great m=
ission is to excite, and at=20

the same time elevate, the feelings of the human family. Lothair found hims=
elf frequently in a=20

reverie over Miss Arundel=E2=80=99s ideal fane; and, feeling that he had th=
e power of buying up a district in=20

forlorn Westminster, and raising there a temple to the living God, which mi=
ght influence the future=20

welfare of millions, and even effect the salvation of his country, he began=
 to ask himself whether=20

he could incur the responsibility of shrinking from the fulfilment of this =
great duty.  Lothair could not=20

have a better adviser on the subject of the influence of architecture on re=
ligion than Monsignore=20

Catesby. Monsignore Catesby had been a pupil of Pugin; his knowledge of ecc=
lesiastical=20

architecture was only equalled by his exquisite taste. To hear him expound =
the mysteries of=20

symbolical art, and expatiate on the hidden revelations of its beauteous fo=
rms, reached even to=20

ecstasy. Lothair hung upon his accents like a neophyte. Conferences with Fa=
ther Coleman on=20

those points of faith on which they did not differ, followed up by desultor=
y remarks on those points=20

of faith on which they ought not to differ=E2=80=94critical discussions wit=
h Monsignore Catesby on=20

cathedrals, their forms, their purposes, and the instances in several count=
ries in which those forms=20

were most perfect and those purposes best secured=E2=80=94occupied a good d=
eal of time; and yet these=20

engaging pursuits were secondary in real emotion to his frequent conversati=
ons with Miss Arundel=20

in whose society every day he took a strange and deeper interest.  She did =
not extend to him that=20

ready sympathy which was supplied by the two priests. On the contrary, when=
 he was apt to=20

indulge in those speculations which they always encouraged, and rewarded by=
 adroit applause,=20

she was often silent, throwing on him only the scrutiny of those violet yes=
, whose glance was=20

rather fascinating than apt to captivate. And yet he was irresistibly drawn=
 to her, and, once=20

recalling the portrait in the gallery, he ventured to murmur that they were=
 kinsfolk.  =E2=80=9COh! I have no=20

kin, no country,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel. =E2=80=9CThese are not times f=
or kin and country. I have given up all=20

these things for my Master!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut are our times so trying =
as that?=E2=80=9D inquired Lothair.  =E2=80=9CThey are=20

times for new crusades,=E2=80=9D said Miss Arundel, with energy, =E2=80=9Ct=
hough it may be of a different character=20



from the old. If I were a man, I would draw my sword for Christ. There are =
as great deeds to be=20

done as the siege of Ascalon, or even as the freeing of the Holy Sepulchre.=
=E2=80=9D  In the midst of a=20

profound discussion with Father Coleman on Mariolatry, Lothair, rapt in rev=
erie, suddenly=20

introduced the subject of Miss Arundel. =E2=80=9CI wonder what will be her =

me to be settled,=E2=80=9D said Father Coleman. =E2=80=9CShe will be the br=
ide of the Church.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIndeed?=E2=80=9D and he=20

started, and even changed color.  =E2=80=9CShe deems it her vocation,=E2=80=
=9D said Father Coleman.  =E2=80=9CAnd yet,=20

with such gifts, to be immured in a convent,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=
=9CThat would not necessarily follow,=E2=80=9D=20

replied Father Coleman. =E2=80=9CMiss Arundel may occupy a position in whic=
h she may exercise much=20

influence for the great cause which absorbs her being.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CT=
here is a divine energy about her,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, almost speaking to himself. =E2=80=9CIt could not have been given =
for little ends.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf Miss Arundel=20

could meet with a spirit as and as energetic as her own,=E2=80=9D said Fath=
er. Coleman, =E2=80=9CHer fate might be=20

different. She has no thoughts which are not great, and no purposes which a=
re not sublime. But for=20

the companion of her life she would require no less than a Godfrey de Bouil=
lon.=E2=80=9D  Lothair began to=20

find the time pass very rapidly at Vauxe. Easter week had nearly vanished; =
Vauxe had been gay=20

during the last few days. Every day some visitors came down from London; so=
metimes they=20

returned in the evening; sometimes they passed the night at Vauxe, and retu=
rned to town in the=20

morning with large bouquets. Lothair felt it was time for him to interfere,=
 and he broke his intention=20

to Lady St. Jerome; but Lady St. Jerome would not hear of it. So he muttere=
d something about=20

business.  =E2=80=9CExactly,=E2=80=9D she said; =E2=80=9Ceverybody has busi=
ness, and I dare say you have a great deal. But=20

Vauxe is exactly the place for persons who have business. You go up to town=
 by an early train,=20

and then you return exactly in time for dinner, and bring us all the news f=
rom the clubs.=E2=80=9D  Lothair=20

was beginning to say something, but Lady St. Jerome, who, when necessary, h=
ad the rare art of=20

not listening without offending the speaker, told him that they did not int=
end themselves to return to=20

town for a week or so, and that she knew Lord St. Jerome would be greatly a=
nnoyed if Lothair did=20

not remain.  Lothair remained; and he went up to town one or two mornings t=
o transact business;=20

that is to say, to see a celebrated architect and to order plans for a cath=
edral, in which all the=20

purposes of those sublime and exquisite structures were to be realized. The=
 drawings would take=20

a considerable time to prepare, and these must be deeply considered. So Lot=
hair became quite=20

domiciliated at Vauxe: he went up to town in the morning, and returned, as =
it were, to his home;=20

everybody delighted to welcome him, and yet he seemed not expected. His roo=
ms were called=20

after his name; and the household treated him as one of the family.       C=
HAPTER 17 A few days=20

before Lothair=E2=80=99s visit was to terminate, the cardinal and Monsignor=
e Berwick arrived at Vauxe. His=20

eminence was received with much ceremony; the marshalled household, ranged =
in lines, fell on=20

their knees at his approach, and Lady St. Jerome, Miss Arundel, and some ot=
her ladies, scarcely=20

less choice and fair, with the lowest obeisance, touched, with their honore=
d lips, his princely hand.=20

The monsignore had made another visit to Paris on his intended return to Ro=
me, but, in=20

consequence of some secret intelligence which he had acquired in the French=
 capital, had thought=20

fit to return to England to consult with the cardinal. There seemed to be n=
o doubt that the=20

revolutionary party in Italy, assured by the withdrawal of the French troop=
s from Rome, were again=20

stirring. There seemed also little doubt that London was the centre of prep=
aration, though the=20

project and the projectors were involved in much, mystery. =E2=80=9CThey wa=
nt money,=E2=80=9D said the=20

monsignore; =E2=80=9Cthat we know, and that is now our best chance. The Asp=
romonte expedition drained=20



their private resources; and as for further aid, that is out of the questio=
n; the galantuomo is=20

bankrupt. But the atheists are desperate, and we must prepare for events.=
=E2=80=9D  On the morning after=20

their arrival, the cardinal invited Lothair to a stroll in the park. =E2=80=
=9CThere is the feeling of spring this=20

morning,=E2=80=9D said his eminence, =E2=80=9Cthough scarcely yet its visio=
n.=E2=80=9D It was truly a day of balm, and=20

sweetness, and quickening life; a delicate mist hung about the huge trees a=
nd the masses of more=20

distant woods, and seemed to clothe them with that fulness of foliage which=
 was not yet theirs.=20

The cardinal discoursed much on forest-trees, and, happily. He recommended =
Lothair to read=20

Evelyn=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CSylva.=E2=80=9D Mr. Evelyn had a most accomplishe=
d mind; indeed, a character in every respect=20

that approached perfection. He was also a most religious man.  =E2=80=9CI w=
onder,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Chow any=20

man who is religious can think of any thing but religion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CTrue,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal, and looking at=20

him earnestly, =E2=80=9Cmost true. But all things that are good and beautif=
ul make us more religious. They=20

tend to the development of the religious principle in us, which is our divi=
ne nature. And, my dear=20

young friend,=E2=80=9D and here his eminence put his arm easily and affecti=
onately into that of Lothair, =E2=80=9Cit is=20

a most happy thing for you, that you live so much with a really religious f=
amily. It is a great boon=20

for a young man, and a rare one.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI feel it so,=E2=80=9D =
said Lothair, his face kindling.  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said the=20

cardinal, =E2=80=9Cwhen we remember that this country once consisted only o=
f such families!=E2=80=9D And then,=20

with a sigh, and as if speaking to himself, =E2=80=9CAnd they made it so gr=
eat and so beautiful!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is still=20

great and beautiful,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, but rather in a tone of inquiry=
 than decision.  =E2=80=9CBut the cause of its=20

greatness and its beauty no longer exists. It became great and beautiful be=
cause it believed in=20

God.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut faith is not extinct?=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =
=E2=80=9CIt exists in the Church,=E2=80=9D replied the cardinal, with=20

decision. =E2=80=9CAll without that pale is practical atheism.=E2=80=9D  =

 dear young friend; noble and true. And the=20

highest duty of man, especially in this age, is to vindicate the principles=
 of religion, without which=20

the world must soon become a scene of universal desolation.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI wonder if England will ever again=20

be a religious country?=E2=80=9D said Lothair, musingly.  =E2=80=9CI pray f=
or that daily,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal; and he=20

invited his companion to seat himself on the trunk of an oak that had been =
lying there since the=20

autumn fall. A slight hectic flame played over the pale and attenuated coun=
tenance of the cardinal;=20

he seemed for a moment in deep thought; and then, in a voice distinct yet s=
omewhat hushed, and=20

at first rather faltering, he said: =E2=80=9CI know not a grander, or a nob=
ler career, for a young man of=20

talents and position in this age, than to be the champion and asserter of D=
ivine truth. It is not=20

probable that there could be another conqueror in our time. The world is we=
aried of statesmen;=20

whom democracy has degraded into politicians, and of orators who have becom=
e what they call=20

debaters. I do not believe there could be another Dante, even another Milto=
n. The world is devoted=20

to physical science, because it believes these discoveries will increase it=
s capacity of luxury and=20

self-indulgence. But the pursuit of science leads only to the insoluble. Wh=
en we arrive at that=20

barren term, the Divine voice summons man, as it summoned Samuel; all the p=
oetry and passion=20

and sentiment of human nature are taking refuge in religion; and he, whose =
deeds and words most=20

nobly represent Divine thoughts, will be the man of this century.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CBut who could be equal to such=20

a task?=E2=80=9D murmured Lothair.  =E2=80=9CYourself,=E2=80=9D exclaimed t=
he cardinal, and he threw his glittering eye=20

upon his companion. =E2=80=9CAny one with the necessary gifts, who had impl=
icit faith in the Divine=20

purpose.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the Church is perplexed; it is ambiguous, c=
ontradictory.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo, no,=E2=80=9D said the=20

cardinal; =E2=80=9Cnot the Church of Christ; it is never perplexed, never a=
mbiguous, never contradictory.=20

Why should it be? How could it be? The Divine persons are ever with it, str=
engthening and guiding=20

it with perpetual miracles. Perplexed churches are churches made by Act of =
Parliament, not by=20

God.=E2=80=9D  Lothair seemed to start, and looked at his guardian with a s=
crutinizing glance. And then he=20

said, but not without hesitation, =E2=80=9CI experience at times great desp=
ondency.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNaturally,=E2=80=9D replied the=20

cardinal. =E2=80=9CEvery man must be despondent who is not a Christian.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut I am a Christian,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair.  =E2=80=9CA Christian estranged,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal; =E2=

Christianity.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is something in that,=E2=80=9D said =
Lothair. =E2=80=9CI require the consolations of Christianity,=20

and yet I feel I have them not. Why is this?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBecause wha=
t you call your religion is a thing apart=20

from your life, and it ought to be your life. Religion should be the rule o=
f life, not a casual incident=20

of it. There is not a duty of existence, not a joy or sorrow which the serv=
ices of the Church do not=20



assert, or with which they do not sympathize. Tell me, now; you have, I was=
 glad to hear, attended=20

the services of the Church of late, since you have been under this admirabl=
e roof. Have you not=20

then found some consolation?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; without doubt I have b=

sighed.  =E2=80=9CWhat the soul is to man, the Church is to the world,=E2=
=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CIt is the link=20

between us and the Divine nature. It came from heaven complete; it has neve=
r changed, and it=20

can never alter. Its ceremonies are types of celestial truths; its services=
 are suited to all the moods=20

of man; they strengthen him in his wisdom and his purity, and control and s=
ave him in the hour of=20

passion and temptation. Taken as a whole, with all its ministrations, its o=
rders, its offices, and the=20

divine splendor of its ritual, it secures us on earth some adumbration of t=
hat ineffable glory which=20

awaits the faithful in heaven, where the blessed Mother of God and ten thou=

perpetually guard over us with Divine intercession.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI wa=
s not taught these things in my=20

boyhood,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CAnd you might reproach me, and re=
asonably, as your guardian, for my=20

neglect,=E2=80=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CBut my power was very limited=
, and, when my duties commenced, you=20

must remember that I was myself estranged from the Church, I was myself a P=
arliamentary=20

Christian, till despondency and study and ceaseless thought and prayer, and=
 the Divine will,=20

brought me to light and rest. But I at least saved you from a Presbyterian =
university; I at least=20

secured Oxford for you; and I can assure you, of my many struggles, that wa=
s not the least.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt=20

gave the turn to my mind,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cand I am grateful=

only knows.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt will end in His glory and in yours,=E2=80=
=9D said the cardinal. =E2=80=9CI have spoken, perhaps, too=20

much and too freely, but you greatly interest me, not merely because you ar=

son of my beloved friend, but because I perceive in you great qualities=E2=

continued the cardinal with earnestness, =E2=80=9Cthat properly guided, the=

hair shook his head.  =E2=80=9CWell,=20

well,=E2=80=9D continued the cardinal in a lighter tone, =E2=80=9Cwe will p=
ursue our ramble. At any rate, I am not=20

wrong in this, that you have no objection to join in my daily prayer for th=
e conversion of this=20

se.  =E2=80=9CYes religious truth,=E2=80=9D said Lothair,=20

=E2=80=9Cwe must all pray for that.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 18 Lothair retur=
ned to town excited and agitated. He felt=20

that he was on the eve of some great event in his existence, but its precis=
e character was not=20

defined. One conclusion, however, was indubitable: life must be religion; w=
hen we consider what=20

is at stake, and that our eternal welfare depends on our due preparation fo=
r the future, it was folly=20

to spare a single hour from the consideration of the best means to secure o=
ur readiness. Such a=20

subject does not admit of half measures or of halting opinions. It seemed t=
o Lothair that nothing=20

could interest him in life that was not symbolical of divine truths and an =
adumbration of the=20

celestial hereafter.  Could truth have descended from heaven ever to be dis=
torted, to be corrupted,=20

misapprehended, misunderstood? Impossible! Such a belief would confound and=
 contradict all the=20

attributes of the All-wise and the All-mighty. There must be truth on earth=
 now as fresh and=20

complete is it was at Bethlehem. And how could it be preserved but by the i=
nfluence of the=20

Paraclete acting on an ordained class? On this head his tutor at Oxford had=
 fortified him; by a=20

conviction of the Apostolical succession of the English bishops, which no A=
ct of Parliament could=20

alter or affect. But Lothair was haunted by a feeling that the relations of=
 his Communion with the=20

Blessed Virgin were not satisfactory. They could not content either his hea=
rt or his intellect. Was it=20

becoming that a Christian should live as regards the hallowed Mother of his=
 God in a condition of=20



harsh estrangement? What mediatorial influence more awfully appropriate tha=
n the consecrated=20

agent of the mighty mystery? Nor could he, even in his early days, accept w=
ithout a scruple the=20

frigid system that would class the holy actors in the divine drama of the R=
edemption as mere units=20

in the categories of vanished generations. Human beings who had been in per=
sonal relation with=20

the Godhead must be different from other human beings. There must be some t=
ranscendent=20

quality in their lives and careers, in their very organization, which marks=
 them out from all secular=20

heroes. What was Alexander the Great, or even Caius Julius, compared with t=
hat apostle whom=20

Jesus loved?  Restless and disquieted, Lothair paced the long and lofty roo=
ms which had been=20

secured for him in a London hotel which rivalled the colossal convenience o=
f Paris and the=20

American cities. Their tawdry ornaments and their terrible new furniture wo=
uld not do after the=20

galleries and portraits of Vauxe. Lothair sighed.  Why did that visit ever =
end? Why did the world=20

consist of any thing else but Tudor palaces in ferny parks, or time be othe=
r than a perpetual Holy=20

Week? He never sighed at Vauxe. Why? He supposed it was because their relig=
ion was his life,=20

and here=E2=80=94and he looked around him with a shudder. The cardinal was =
right: it was a most happy=20

thing for him to be living so much with so truly a religious family.  The d=
oor opened, and servants=20

came in bearing a large and magnificent portfolio. It was of morocco and of=
 prelatial purple with=20

broad bands of gold and alternate ornaments of a cross and a coronet. A ser=
vant handed to=20

Lothair a letter, which enclosed the key that opened its lock. The portfoli=
o contained the plans and=20

drawings of the cathedral.  Lothair was lost in admiration of these designs=
 and their execution. But=20

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project and also information=
. In a truly religious=20

family there would always be a Father Coleman or a Monsignore Catesby to gu=
ide and to instruct.=20

But a Protestant, if he wants aid or advice on any matter, can only go to h=
is solicitor. But as he=20

proceeded in his researches he sensibly felt that the business was one abov=
e even an oratorian or=20

a monsignore. It required a finer and a more intimate sympathy; a taste at =
the same time more=20

inspired and more inspiring; some one who blended with divine convictions t=
he graceful energy of=20



human feeling, and who would not only animate him to effort but fascinate h=
im to its fulfilment. The=20

counsellor he required was Miss Arundel.  Lothair had quitted Vauxe one wee=
k, and it seemed to=20

him a year. During the first four-and-twenty hours he felt like a child who=
 had returned to school,=20

and, the day after, like a man on a desert island. Various other forms of m=
isery and misfortune=20

were suggested by his succeeding experience. Town brought no distractions t=
o him; he knew very=20

few people, and these be had not yet encountered; he had once ventured to W=
hite=E2=80=99s, but found=20

only a group of gray-beaded men, who evidently did not know him, and who se=
emed to scan him=20

with cynical nonchalance. These were not the golden youth whom he had been =
assured by=20

Bertram would greet him; so, after reading a newspaper for a moment upside =
downward, he got=20

away. But he had no harbor of refuge, and was obliged to ride down to Richm=
ond and dine alone,=20

and meditate on symbols and celestial adumbrations. Every day he felt how i=
nferior was this=20

existence to that of a life in a truly religious family.  But, of all the m=
embers of the family to which=20

his memory recurred with such unflagging interest, none more frequently eng=
aged his thoughts=20

than Miss Arundel. Her conversation, which stimulated his intelligence whil=
e it rather piqued his=20

self-love, exercised a great influence over him, and he had omitted no oppo=
rtunity of enjoying her=20

society. That society and its animating power he sadly missed; and now that=
 he had before him=20

the very drawings about which they had frequently talked, and she was not b=
y his side to suggest=20

and sympathize and criticise and praise, he felt unusually depressed.  Loth=
air corresponded with=20

Lady St. Jerome, and was aware of her intended movements. But the return th=
e family to London=20

had been somewhat delayed. When this disappointment was first made known to=
 him, his impulse=20

was to ride down to Vauxe; but the tact in which he was not deficient assur=
ed him that he ought=20

not to reappear on a stage where he had already figured for perhaps too con=
siderable a time, and=20

so another week had to be passed, softened, however, by visits from the fat=
her of the oratory and=20

the chamberlain of his holiness, who came to look after Lothair with much f=
riendliness, and with=20

whom it was consolatory and even delightful for him to converse on sacred a=
rt, still holier things,=20

and also Miss Arundel.  At length, though it seemed impossible, this second=
 week elapsed, and to-

morrow Lothair was to lunch with Lady St. Jerome in St. James=E2=80=99s Squ=
are, and to meet all his=20

friends. He thought of it all day, and he passed a restless night. He took =
an early canter to rally his=20

energies, and his fancy was active in the splendor of the spring. The chest=
nuts were in silver=20

bloom, and the pink May had flushed the thorns, and banks of sloping turf w=
ere radiant with plots=20

of gorgeous flowers. The waters glittered in the=20

Nothing could be more cordial, nothing more winning, than the reception of =
Lothair by Lady St.=20

Jerome. She did not conceal her joy at their being again together. Even Mis=
s Arundel, though still=20

calm, even a little demure, seemed glad to see him: her eyes looked kind an=
d pleased, and she=20

gave him her hand with graceful heartiness. It was the sacred hour of two w=
hen Lothair arrived,=20

and they were summoned to luncheon almost immediately. Then they were not a=
lone; Lord St.=20

Jerome was not there, but the priests were present and some others. Lothair=
, however, sat next to=20

Miss Arundel.  =E2=80=9CI have been thinking of you very often since I left=
