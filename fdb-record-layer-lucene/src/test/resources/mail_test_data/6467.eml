n gives but a faint intimation of the exceptionally friendly relations exis=
ting between these devoted friends. Blessed are the birds that can inspire =
such affection in the heart of a noble old man, and doubly blessed is he wh=
o is the object of such loving appreciation. Long may they all live to enjo=

ek. He'd deny it like anything. But in the end I dare say you'd be able to =
prove it. The worst of these law cases is they're so _
grievously hurt and wounded full sore, and particularly so in the left wing=
. He was so badly=20

disabled that he had to forego the pleasure of flying through the air, and =
was obliged to content=20

himself as best he could with trudging about on the rough surface of mother=
 earth.  In his sad=20

plight, with the maimed wing dragging painfully along, he chanced to pass t=
he window of a library=20

belonging to and occupied by a charming old English gentleman, a perfect ex=
ample of the old=20

school, learned, benevolent, and very fond of animals and feathered pets. N=
o one can tell what=20

chance it was that brought the unhappy and wounded young rook to the window=
 of this good man.=20

But possibly it was a real inspiration on the part of the young bird. Toby =
was wet, weary, wounded=20

and hungry, and as he looked in upon the cheerful wood fire and the kindly =
face of the master of=20

the house, his longing expression was met by a raising of the window and an=
 invitation to walk in=20

to a breakfast of corn and meal that had been hastily prepared for him. He =
gazed and thought, and=20

thought and gazed, upon the joys within and still he doubted; but, finally,=
 appetite and curiosity got=20

the better of his discretion, and, as he walked cautiously in, the window w=
as closed behind him. So=20

the wounded bird entered upon a new life.  At first he was a little shy and=
 cautious and it took=20

considerable time for him to convince himself that his protector was his fr=
iend. After a few weeks,=20

however, he realized the value of his new position, and consented to the es=
tablishment of intimate=20

relations. In fact, Toby became so attached to his master, that he was not =
happy out of his=20

presence.  During the first month of his captivity, his wounded wing was bo=
und close to his body=20

for the purpose of giving the fractured bone an opportunity to unite, and d=
uring most of that time=20

he would walk by his master's side, cawing and looking up into his face as =
if asking for recognition.=20

When the wing got well, and his ability to fly was re-established, he would=
 anticipate the direction=20

of the promenades by flying in advance from shrub to bush, alighting and aw=
aiting the arrival of his=20

master.  The most singular part of Toby's domestication was his exclusive l=
oyalty to a single=20

person. He had but one intimate friend, and to him his loyalty was intense.=
 He would tolerate the=20

presence of other members of the household, but when strangers appeared he =
was decidedly=20

offish, and scolded until they disappeared.  Three times a day Toby is deci=
dedly funny, and goes=20

through a comical performance. In his master's study there is a contrivance=
 which, on a small=20

scale, resembles the old New England well-pole. At one end, which rests upo=
n the floor, Toby=20

commences his ascent with a great flapping of wings and uproarious cawing. =
When he arrives at=20

the upper end of the pole, some eight or nine feet from the floor, it falls=
 and lands him upon a=20

platform, beside a plate containing his food. This climbing up the pole pre=
cedes each meal, and=20

takes place punctually at the same hour and minute of each day. In the spri=
ng of 1890 Toby was=20

tempted from his loyalty, and flew off with a marauding flock of his kind. =
He remained away all=20

summer. He was missed but not mourned, for his master felt certain he would=
 return; and, sure=20

enough, one bleak cold morning in November, Toby was found looking longingl=
y into the room=20

where he had first seen his good master. The window was opened, he walked i=
n and mounted his=20

pole, and after him came a meek, modest and timid young rook, more confidin=
g than Toby, and=20

differing from him in many other respects. He, too, was duly adopted, and w=
as christened Jocko.=20

He was easily domesticated and soon became a part of the household of one o=
f the finest old=20

Bedfordshire manorial homes.  With age Toby has taken on quite an amount of=
 dignity. He is=20

neither so noisy nor so companionable as formerly, but is more staid and us=
eful. One of his=20

favorite resting places, where he enjoys his after-breakfast contemplations=
 and his afternoon=20



siestas, is among the branches of a fine old English oak, whose protecting =
shades, in the far-off=20

past, were the scene of the stolen love meetings of Amy Wentworth and the D=
uke of Monmouth.=20

Neither of these knowing birds has been able to succeeded.  While somewhat =
perfunctorily=20

holding the fork to the fire, Matthew glared about him, to signify his righ=
teous horror, and other=20

sentiments.  "Please don't burn it," said Alice gently. "Suppose you were t=
o sit down on this foot-

stool." And then she poured boiling water on the tea, put the lid on the po=
t, and looked at the clock=20

to note the exact second at which the process of infusion had begun.  "Of c=
ourse," burst out=20

Henry, the twin of Matthew, "I need not say, madam, that you have all our s=
ympathies. You are in=20

a----"  "Do you mean me?" Alice asked.  In an undertone Priam could be hear=
d obstinately=20

repeating, "Never set eyes upon her before! Never set eyes on the woman bef=
ore!"  "I do,=20

madam," said Henry, not to be cowed nor deflected from his course. "I speak=
 for all of us. You=20

have our sympathies. You could not know the character of the man you marrie=
d, or rather with=20

whom you went through the ceremony of marriage. However, we have heard, by =
inquiry, that you=20

made his acquaintance through the medium of a matrimonial agency; and indir=
ectly, when one=20

does that sort of thing, one takes one's chance. Your position is an extrem=
ely delicate one; but it is=20

not too much to say that you brought it on yourself. In my work, I have enc=
ountered many sad=20

instances of the result of lax moral principles; but I little thought to en=
counter the saddest of all in=20

my own family. The discovery is just as great a blow to us as it is to you.=
 We have suffered; my=20

mother has suffered. And now, I fear, it is your turn to suffer. You are no=
t this man's wife. Nothing=20

can make you his wife. You are living in the same house with him--under cir=
cumstances--er--

without a chaperon. I hesitate to characterize your situation in plain word=
s. It would scarcely=20

become me, or mine, to do so. But really no lady could possibly find hersel=
f in a situation more=20

false than--I am afraid there is only one word, open immorality, and--er--t=
o put yourself right with=20

society there is one thing, and only one, left for you to--er--do. I--I spe=
ak for the family, and I--"=20

"Sugar?" Alice questioned the mother of curates.  "Yes, please."  "One lump=
, or two?"  "Two,=20

please."  "Speaking for the family--" Henry resumed.  "Will you kindly pass=
 this cup to your=20

mother?" Alice suggested.  Henry was obliged to take the cup. Excited by th=
e fever of eloquence,=20

he unfortunately upset it before it had reached his mother's hands.  "Oh, H=
enry!" murmured the=20

lady, mournfully aghast. "You always were so clumsy! And a clean cloth, too=
!"  "Don't mention it,=20

please," said Alice, and then to _her_ Henry: "My dear, just run into the k=
itchen, and bring me=20

something to wipe this up. Hanging behind the door--you'll see."  Priam spr=
ang forward with=20

astonishing celerity. And the occasion brooking no delay, the guardian of t=
he portal could not but=20

let him pass. In another moment the front door banged. Priam did not return=
. And Alice staunched=20

the flow of tea with a clean, stiff serviette taken from the sideboard draw=
er.   _A Departure_   The=20

family of the late Henry Leek, each with a cup in hand, experienced a certa=
in difficulty in=20

maintaining the interview at the pitch set by Matthew and Henry. Mrs. Leek,=
 their mother, frankly=20

gave way to soft tears, while eating bread-and-butter, jam and zebra-like t=
oast. John took=20

everything that Alice offered to him in gloomy and awkward silence.  "Does =
he mean to come=20

back?" Matthew demanded at length. He had risen from the foot-stool.  "Who?=
" asked Alice.=20

Matthew paused, and then said, savagely and deliberately: "Father."  Alice =
smiled. "I'm afraid not.=20

I'm afraid he's gone out. You see, he's a rather peculiar man. It's not the=
 slightest use me trying to=20

drive him. He can only be led. He has his good points--I can speak candidly=
 as he isn't here, and I=20



_will_--he has his good points. When Mrs. Leek, as I suppose she calls hers=
elf, spoke about his=20

cruelty to her--well, I understood that. Far be it from me to say a word ag=
ainst him; he's often very=20

good to me, but--another cup, Mr. John?"  John advanced to the table withou=
t a word, holding his=20

cup.  "You don't mean to say, ma'am," said Mrs. Leek "that he--?"  Alice no=
dded grievously.  Mrs.=20

Leek burst into tears. "When Johnnie was barely five weeks old," she said, =
"he=20


_
mystery of a looking-glass. They spend many hours of patient investigation =
before a mirror in their=20

master's room, but all to no purpose, for the puzzle seems to remain as gre=
at as ever. They=20

usually walk directly up to it, and betray great surprise when they find tw=
o other rooks advancing to=20

meet them. For a while they remain silent and motionless, looking at the st=
rangers, and waiting,=20

apparently, for some sign of recognition. Then they go through a considerab=
le flapping of wings=20

and indulge in numerous caws, but after long waiting for an audible respons=
e they give up the=20

useless effort, only to return next day as eager as ever to solve the myste=
ry. The older bird and his=20

admiring junior are perfectly contented with their home, and never leave it=
. They often look out=20

from their perches upon wandering flocks of vagrant rooks, but are never te=
mpted to new=20

adventures. The old fellow is very wise. Like a fat old office-holder, he k=
nows enough to appreciate=20

a sinecure he locked me up in the cellar. And one morning when I was ironin=
g he snatched the hot=20

iron out of my hand and--"  "Don't! Don't!" Alice soothed her. "I know. I k=
now all you can tell me. I=20

know because I've been through--"  "You don't mean to say he threatened _yo=
u_ with the flat-

iron?"  "If threatening was only all!" said Alice, like a martyr.  "Then he=
's not changed, in all these=20

years!" wept the mother of curates.  "If he has, it's for the worse," said =
Alice. "How was I to tell?"=20

she faced the curates. "How could I know? And yet nobody, nobody, could be =
nicer than he is at=20

times!"  "That's true, that's true," responded the authentic Mrs. Henry Lee=
k. "He was always so=20

changeable. So queer."  "Queer!" Alice took up the word. "That's it Queer! =
I don't think he's _quite_=20

right in his head, not quite right. He has the very strangest fancies. I ne=
ver take any notice of them,=20

but they're there. I seldom get up in the morning without thinking, 'Well, =
perhaps to-day he'll=20


_
His devoted follower never falters in his dutiful imitation of his benefact=
or.  Toby proves by his=20

actions that he appreciates the advantages of the situation, and in his sim=
ple way makes some=20

return for the pleasures he enjoys.  During a considerable portion of the p=
leasant days of the year=20

he is really the watchman upon the tower, ever on the lookout to give notic=
e of the approach of=20

visitors to his castle, and no one can intrude upon the premises under his =
self-appointed=20

watchmanship without exciting vigorous caws, which are enthusiastically rei=
nforced by those of his=20

faithful subordinate. Aside from his affectionate devotion to his master, t=
his duty of "chief=20

watchman of the castle" is Toby's most substantial return for favors receiv=
ed.  In a letter of last=20

May, the master wrote: "My two crows are sitting on chairs close to me, and=
 cawing to me to be=20

taken off.'"  "Taken off?"  "Yes, to Hanwell, or wherever it is. And you mu=
st remember," she said=20

gazing firmly at the curates, "you've got his blood in your veins. Don't fo=
rget that. I suppose you=20

want to make him go back to you, Mrs. Leek, as he certainly ought."  "Ye-es=
," murmured Mrs.=20

Leek feebly.  "Well, if you can persuade him to go," said Alice, "if you ca=
n make him see his duty,=20

you're welcome. But I'm sorry for you. I think I ought to tell you that thi=
s is my house, and my=20

furniture. He's got nothing at all. I expect he never could save. Many's th=
e blow he's laid on me in=20

anger, but all the same I pity him. I pity him. And I wouldn't like to leav=
e him in the lurch. Perhaps=20

these three strong young men'll be able to do something with him. But I'm n=
ot sure. He's very=20

strong. And he has a way of leaping out so sudden like."  Mrs. Leek=20
