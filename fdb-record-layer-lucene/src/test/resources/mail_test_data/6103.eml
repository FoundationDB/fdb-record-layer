Hamilton's creek, 47    Hamlin's fork, 24    seems the bed of a river which=
 had deserted its=20

channel. Often we pass small streams of water; and the water is continually=
 dripping from the ends=20

of the stalactites, the echoing sound of which, when it drops, forms the on=
ly interruption to the=20

profound silence which reigns throughout the cavern.  To give an idea of th=
e diversified shapes=20

which these concretions assume in the progress of their formation, (and the=
y are constantly=20

forming,) would be impossible. Suffice it to say, that there is scarcely an=
y thing on earth to which=20



they may not be supposed to form a resemblance; and yet, in fact, they are =
unlike any thing but=20

themselves.  It is generally known that the earth in these caves contains t=
he nitrates of lime, and=20

potash, and other salts. The numerous caves which have been found in the Cu=
mberland=20

mountains and other parts of Tennessee, have been very productive of the ni=
trate of potash. In the=20

investigation of the causes which have given origin to these salts, it may =
be recollected, that wild=20

animals burrow in these caves; that when pursued by the hunter, they make t=
hem the places of=20

their retreat, and probably die there; that the aborigines have made them a=
 place of burial; and=20

that the streams of water which flow through them in wet weather, carry wit=
h them not only great=20

quantities of leaves but many other vegetable productions.  The _natural br=
idge_ is celebrated as=20

one of the greatest curiosities of the world. Viewed by a geologist, it wou=
ld probably be considered=20

as a cave (so to speak) _unroofed_ in all but one place. It seems improbabl=
e that if the ravine had=20

been made by a convulsion, which had split and separated the rock to the di=
stance of fifty or sixty=20

feet, any part of it, and particularly so large a mass as that which forms =
the bridge, should have=20

been left, without exhibiting any marks of violence. The rock is limestone.=
 It is known that this rock=20

wears away rapidly under the attrition of water; and the supposition does n=
ot appear improbable,=20

that, in the lapse of ages, so large a creek as that which flows below the =
bridge, may have worn as=20

deep a ravine as that which now strikes us with so much surprise, In short,=
 may not a cave have=20

been originally formed where the ravine is now, and the pending portion of =
it have fallen in at every=20

place except that which now forms this celebrated natural curiosity?  _Mine=
ral Springs._--The=20

mineral springs of this region are numerous and diversified. Chalybeate spr=
ings are promiscuously=20

scattered over the whole of it; and springs impregnated with sulphuretted h=
ydrogen are quite=20

common. Salt springs and licks are found more in the western than the easte=
rn range of=20

mountains. That which was first wrought by William King, is well known. The=
 salt here is=20

associated with gypsum. In the same range of mountains, farther to the sout=
hwest, there are now=20

several other salt-works, and also one to the west, on Goose Creek, in Kent=
ucky, which has been=20

very productive.  _The Warm Springs._--These springs are situated in a coun=
try which presents=20

many attractions to the travelling geologist; and much light, it is hoped, =
will yet be thrown on the=20

geology of our country, by a more minute and accurate examination of it tha=
n has yet been made.=20

The warm springs ooze through the sand on the south bank of the French Broa=
d river, in the=20

mountains which divide the state of Tennessee from her parent state, about =
the 36th parallel of=20

latitude. The temperature of the water is about 95=C2=B0 of Fahrenheit.  On=
 the opposite side of the river=20

from the springs is a geological curiosity. A limestone rock is seen dippin=
g under the sandstone=20

imestone rock is a cave=20

similar to others already described.  _Paint Rock_, in the vicinity of the =
Warm Springs, is=20

interesting on many accounts. It is a bold precipice on the bank of French =
Broad river. At this place=20

the river passes with a very rapid current directly across the course of a =
mountain, which=20

terminates abruptly, and forms the precipice on the north bank of the river=
. On looking at the rock,=20

the opposite end of the mountain, and the ruins around it, the mind is inse=
nsibly carried back to=20

the contemplation of some dreadful commotion in nature, which probably shoo=
k these mountains=20

to their bases.  The rock is composed of a _clay slate_; and it is here aga=
in remarkable, that this=20

stone is not to be seen in any other place within some miles. It has receiv=
