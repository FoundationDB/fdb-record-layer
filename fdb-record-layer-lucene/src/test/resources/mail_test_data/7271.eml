philodendron monstera blackguards."  "Would to God you had been more explic=
it!" exclaimed Tony with a bitter sigh.  "Would to God I had," rejoined the=
 other, "but there was so little time, with licences and what not all to ar=
range for, and less than an hour to do it in. And would you have suspected =
the Duc himself of such execrable duplicity even if you had known, as I did=
 then, that the so-called Martin-Roget hath name Adet, and Some of them eve=
n suggested that half of their number should remain behind to guard the cam=
p while the other half should go after the buffalo.  This proposal, however=
, was not received with favour, as it would certainly be a matter of disagr=
eement which half was to go out, and which to remain behind!  "Where is Kat=

Pimpernel.  "I mean," he said, returning his friend's anxious look with one=
 that was inspiring in its=20

unshakable confidence, "I mean that on Monday last, the night before your w=
edding--when I urged=20

you to obtain Yvonne de Kernogan's consent to an immediate marriage--I had =
followed Martin-

Roget to a place called "The Bottom Inn" on Goblin Combe--a place well know=
n to every smuggler=20

in the county."  "You, Percy!" exclaimed Tony in amazement.  "Yes, I," laug=
hed the other lightly.=20

"Why not? I had had my suspicions of him for some time. As luck would have =
it he started off on=20

the Monday afternoon by hired coach to Chelwood. I followed. From Chelwood =
he wanted to go=20

peace--not war."  Whatever may have been the private opinion of the braves =
as to this new and=20

very unexpected style of address, the effect of it was pacific; for, after =
a little more palaver, the=20

peace-party carried the day--or, rather the night--and, next morning, the C=
ree warriors went back=20

to their tents and hunting avocations, leaving Okematan to return to the ca=
mp of his friends the=20

buffalo runners.    CHAPTER SIXTEEN.  AN EVENING IN THE CAMP.  It was daybr=
eak when=20

Fergus McKay galloped into camp with the startling news that an attack by h=
ostile Indians might=20

be expected that day or the following night.  He was, of course, unaware of=
 the fact that the=20


_
evening was gathering in very fast. Nobody would take him. He wanted a hors=
e and a guide. I was=20

on the spot--as disreputable a bar-loafer as you ever saw in your life. I o=
ffered to take him. He had=20

no choice. He had to take me. No one else had offered. I took him to the Bo=
ttom Inn. There he met=20

our esteemed friend M. Chauvelin...."  "Chauvelin!" cried Tony, suddenly ro=
used from the dull=20

apathy of his immeasurable grief, at sound of that name which recalled so m=
any exciting=20

adventures, such mad, wild, hair-breadth escapes. "Chauvelin! What in the w=
orld is he doing here=20

in England?"  "Brewing mischief, of course," replied Blakeney dryly. "In di=
sgrace, discredited, a=20

marked man--what you will--my friend M. Chauvelin has still an infinite cap=
acity for mischief.=20

Through the interstices of a badly fastened shutter I heard two blackguards=
 devising infinite=20

devilry. That is why, Tony," he added, "I urged an immediate marriage as th=
e only more leisurely=20

pace.  Some readers may think that the Indian, with his traditional power o=
f following a trail, should=20

have observed and suspected the fresh track of the hunter, but it must be r=
emembered that some=20

hundreds of buffalo runners had passed over the same track a day or two pre=
viously, and that=20

Hawkeye, or Pathfinder himself, would have become helpless in the midst of =
such trampled=20

confusion.  Besides, Okematan had no reason to suspect that he had been fol=
lowed; still less that=20

the camp of the war-party had been accidentally discovered.  "Now, boys," s=
aid Fergus, after=20

detailing his adventures during the night, "we will hev to give up all noti=
on o' buffalo runnin' this=20

day an' putt the camp in a state o' defence."  There was a good deal of gru=
mbling at this,=20

especially among some of the younger men; for they were very keen to commen=
ce the sport, and=20

had not much belief in the power of a small band of savages to do them=20
