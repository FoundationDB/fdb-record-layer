Farewell, my lady. We shall have more words hereafter, when I come to claim you for my wife."  "You shall have her if you win her," said the King.  But, of course, no one  Then Father Bear loaded his arms and off they started for home. Each had his arms full of corn.  "How hot the sun--and how hard the road--and, oh, how far away home is." These were some of the thoughts in the young _
hither. He! he! For there is one who wishes to see her. Ha! ha!"  While the room was still echoing 

with laughter, the heralds entered with the King's daughter, and Arthur saw why every one had 

laughed. The Princess was a giantess,--a head taller than any man present,--and though she was 

very beautiful, her face was hard and cold, and she looked bad-tempered. When she walked, the 

floor trembled, and when she spoke, the glasses shivered.  "Who wishes to see me?" she said in a 

deep voice, crossly.  "Heavens!" said Arthur to himself, "this is a Princess, indeed! It will be more 

of a task to tame her than any dragon. But she is very handsome, and I have my magic glass. 

When we are married I will turn her into a nice little girl, just the size for me. So all will be well." 

The King pointed to Arthur with his scepter. "Behold our champion," he said, chuckling. "My 

daughter, it is for you to hope that this brave fellow may slay the Dragon of Hushby. For in that 

case I vow to make you his wife."  "Huh!" said the Princess, looking down at was, just as lots of 

little boys do.  His father smiled. "You'll need all the strength you have, Bobby, for we want to get 

enough corn today to last your mother all season."  On they went, mile after mile. Soon it became 

hot. Father Bear, being big and strong, didn't get tired. Bobby, because he was so young, soon 

became weary.  Do you think he showed it, though? Not he. He had been brought up to bear pain, 

and hard work, and cold, and heat, without complaining.  My, how glad he was, though, to see the 

yellow mass some distance ahead which told him they were near their journey's end.  "How do 

you like the looks of it, boy?" his father asked.  "Fine! And what a lot there is. There must be acres 

and acres and acres of it."  Bobby had heard his father talking to a bear neighbor one day, and 

they had used the word "acre" when describing things. So he, just like lots of little boys, wanted to 

be "big" and he had used it now.  When Father Bear heard Bobby use the word "acres" he 

pretended not to notice it. So he simply answered, "Yes,

Arthur advanced and made a low bow to her. "For such a great prize, Your Highness," he said, "a 

man would venture much."  At these words the Princess looked crosser than ever, and tossed her 

head. "Take care that the Dragon does not swallow you at a mouthful, Dwarf!" she said, very 

impolitely, and every one laughed.  Arthur turned red corn here."  They had brought something to 

eat with them. Now they chose a big, shady tree, and, sitting beneath it, munched away at the 

food.  Bobby felt very grateful for the rest, and when they again got on their feet he was ready for 

anything.  Picking out that part of the field where the corn was richest, Bobby Bear's father had
