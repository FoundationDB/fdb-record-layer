be much thicker than the part of the walls that will appear above ground, and their structure should 

be as solid as it can possibly be laid.  2. The towers must be projected beyond the line of wall, so 

that an enemy wishing to approach the wall to carry it by assault may be exposed to the fire of 

missiles on his open flank from the towers on his right and left. Special pains should be taken that 

there be no easy avenue by which to storm the wall. The roads should be encompassed at steep 

points, and planned so as to approach the gates, not in a straight line, but from the right to the left; 

for as a result of this, the right hand side of the assailants, unprotected by their shields, will be next 

the wall. Towns should be laid out not as an exact square nor with salient angles, but in circular 

form, to give a view of the enemy from many points. Defence is difficult where there are salient 

angles, because the angle protects the enemy rather than the inhabitants.  3. The thickness of the 

wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed men meeting on top of it may pass one another 

without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of 

charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting 

endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but 

even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not 

only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city 

wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner.  4. The towers should be set at intervals 

of not more than a bowshot apart, so that in case of an assault upon any one of them, the enemy 

may be repulsed with scorpiones and other means of hurling missiles from the towers to the right 

and left. Opposite the inner side of every tower the wall should be interrupted for a space the width 

of the tower, and have only a wooden flooring across, leading to the interior of the tower but not 

firmly nailed. This is to be cut away by the defenders in case the enemy gets possession of any 

portion of the wall; and if the work is quickly done, the enemy will not be able to make his way to 

the other towers and the rest of the wall unless he is ready to face a fall.  5. The towers 

themselves must be either round or polygonal. Square towers are sooner shattered by military 

engines, for the battering rams pound their angles to pieces; but in the case of round towers they 

can do no harm, being engaged, as it were, in driving wedges to their centre. The system of 

fortification by wall and towers may be made safest by the addition of earthen ramparts, for neither 

rams, nor mining, nor other engineering devices can do them any harm.  [Illustration: 

CONSTRUCTION OF CITY WALLS  (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 

1511)]  6. The rampart form of defence, however, is not required in all places, but only where 

outside the wall there is high ground from which an assault on "'Ow much d'you think 'e'll get, 

Bloater?"  "Twenty years at least; p'r'aps go for life; you see it's an aggrawated case.  I've bin 

makin' partikler inquiries, and I finds 'e's bin raisin' no end o' fires doorin' the last six months--kep' 

the Red Brigade trottin' about quite in a surprisin' way.  I rather fear that 'e'll be let in for ever an' a 

day."  The Bloater was not quite correct in his guess.  When the trial came on, to the surprise of 

all, especially of his "pals," Phil Sparks pleaded _guilty_!  Partly in consideration of this, and partly 

on account of his last courageous act in saving the girl, he was let off with fifteen years penal 

servitude.  But, to return from this episode.  The great fire at the docks, after gutting several 

warehouses, was finally subdued.  And what of the loss? A hundred thousand pounds did not 

cover it, and every insurance office in London suffered!  In addition to this, several persons lost 

their lives, while the Red Brigade, besides having some of their number more or less severely 



injured, lost one of its best and bravest men.  Gallant Ned Crashington's fighting days were over. 

His mangled remains were gathered up next morning, and, a few days later, were conveyed by his 

comrades to their last resting-place.  It is no easy matter to move the heart of London.  That vast 

nation-in-a-city has too many diverse interests to permit of the eyes of all being turned, even for a 

moment, upon one thing.  Nevertheless the fireman's funeral seemed to cause the great cord to 

vibrate for a little.  Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to witness the cortege.  Ned's 

coffin was drawn, military fashion, on one of the engines peculiar to his profession, with his helmet 

and hatchet placed upon the lid.  The whole of the force of the brigade that could be spared 

followed him in uniform, headed by their chief, and accompanied by a large detachment of the 

police force.  The procession was imposing, and the notices that appeared next day in all the 

papers were a touching tribute of respect to the self-sacrificing fireman, who, as one of these 

papers said, "left a widow and son, in poor circumstances, to mourn his early death."  Ah, these 

things were soon forgotten in the rush of the world's business by all save that widow and son, and 

one or two bosom friends.  Even the men of the Red Brigade _appeared_ to forget the fallen hero 

very soon. We say "appeared," because there were some among them who mourned Ned as a 

dear brother, chief among whom was Joe Dashwood.  But whatever the feelings of the firemen 

might have been, theirs was a warfare that allowed no time for the undue indulgence or exhibition 

of grief.  The regular "calls" and duties went on steadily, sternly, as if nothing had occurred, and 

before Ned's remains had lain a night in their last resting-place, many of his old comrades were 

out again doing fierce battle with the restless and untameable flames.    CHAPTER NINE.  Years 

passed away, and with them many old things vanished, while many novelties appeared, but the 

Red Brigade remained much as 


_
between. In places of this kind we must first make very wide, deep ditches; next sink foundations 

for a wall in the bed of the ditch and build them thick enough to support an earth-work with ease. 

7. Then within this substructure lay a second foundation, far enough inside the first to leave ample 

room for cohorts in line of battle to take position on the broad top of the rampart for its defence. 

Having laid these two foundations at this distance from one excepting that it was, if possible, 

smarter and more energetic than ever.  In the lobby of our West-end station one pleasant summer 

evening, the men sat and stood about the open door beside the trim engines and _materiel_ of 

their profession, chatting heartily as men are won't to do when in high health and spirits.  There 

were new faces among them, but there were also several that had long been familiar there.  The 

stalwart form of Joe Dashwood was there, so 


_
cross walls between them, uniting the outer and inner foundation, in a comb-like arrangement, set 

like the teeth of a saw. With this form of construction, the enormous burden of earth will be 

distributed into small bodies, and will not lie with all its weight in one crushing mass so as to thrust 

out the substructures.  8. With regard to the material of which the actual wall should be 

constructed or finished, there can be no definite prescription, because we cannot obtain in all 

places nothing about him to tell that he was passing the period of middle-age, save a few grey 

hairs that mingled here and there with the dark curls on his temples.  Bob Clazie was there also, 

but he had not stood the trials of his profession so well as Joe--probably his constitution was not 

so strong.  A disagreeable short cough harassed him, though he made light of it.  Frequent 

scorching, smoking, and partial suffocation had increased his wrinkles and rendered his eyelids 

permanently red. 


_
stone, flint, rubble, burnt or unburnt brick,--use them as you find them. For it is not every 

neighbourhood or particular locality that can have a wall built of burnt brick like that at Babylon, 

where there was plenty of asphalt to take the place of lime and sand, and yet possibly each may 

be provided with materials of equal usefulness so that out of them a faultless wall may be built to 

last forever.     CHAPTER VI  THE DIRECTIONS OF THE STREETS; WITH REMARKS ON THE 

of the best men in the Brigade.  Joe Dashwood wore a pair of brass epaulettes on his shoulders, 

which indicated that he had attained to the highest rank in the service, short of the chief command. 

He was giving directions to one of the younger men of the force, when a tall strapping young man, 

with a plain but open and singularly pleasing countenance entered, and going up to him shook him 

warmly by the hand.  "Well, Bob, what's the news? you seem excited this
