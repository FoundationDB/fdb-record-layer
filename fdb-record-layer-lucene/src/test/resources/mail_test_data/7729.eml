would have deliberately submitted to be bled by the Broadhems." That is the=
 sort of thing that will=20

go on with variations in every drawing-room in London for the next few even=
ings. Now I am striking=20

out quite a new line to meet the humbug, the hypocrisy, the scandal, and th=
e ill-nature of which=20

both Ursula and myself are the subjects. Thus, when Broadhem greeted me in =
the presence of the=20

company, after I had received their congratulations with a good deal of amb=
iguous=20

embarrassment, I appeared to be a little overcome, and, linking my arm in t=
hat of my future=20

brother-in-law, walked him out of the room. "My dear Broadhem," said I, "fo=
r reasons which it is not=20

necessary for me now to enter into, but which are connected with the pecuni=
ary arrangements I=20

am making to put your family matters straight, this announcement is a most =
unfortunate=20

occurrence--we must take measures to contradict it immediately."  "Why," sa=
id Broadhem, "if it is=20

the case, as you know it is, I don't see the harm of announcing it. To tell=
 you the truth, I think it=20

ought to have been announced sooner, and that you have been putting Ursula =
lately in rather a=20

false position, by seeming to avoid her so much in society, because, you kn=
ow, it has been talked=20

of for some time past."  "Ah, then, I fancy the announcement was made on yo=
ur authority," I said.=20

"It is a pity, as I had made up my mind to postpone the ceremony until I ha=
d not only completed all=20

see my way towards=20

gradually clearing off the more pressing liabilities with which the estate =
is encumbered. You know=20



what a crotchety fellow I am. Now, my plan is, clear everything off first, =
and marry afterwards; and=20

unless you positively contradict the report of my marriage with your sister=
, I shall immediately=20

countermand the instructions under which my lawyers are acting, and take no=
 further steps=20

whatever in the matter." I felt a malicious pleasure in watching Broadhem's=
 face during this=20

speech, as I was sure that he had done his best to spread the report of my =
marriage with his sister=20

for fear of my backing out, and escaping from my obligations in respect to =
his financial=20

embarrassments. It is only fair to him to state, that these were none of hi=
