dracaena marginata croupier counts the money; he arranges the gold in littl=
e piles, and the notes in three little heaps, placing a small paper-weight =
on each heap. Then the croupier tears open two packets of new cards, flingi=
ng the old ones into a waste-paper basket at his side. He invites various p=
layers to make the cards; this is done in rather a perfunctory manner. With=
 a sort of huge paper-knife the Frenchman passes the cards to Haggard, and =

never refused a loan in so many words. "I wouldn't go on if I were you, sir=
; the luck's dead against=20

you to-night; I wouldn't go on, indeed I wouldn't." This was his invariable=
 formula. It meant that the=20

astute Hebrew declined to do business on any terms. No one ever argued with=
 Levison; all=20

understood that this particular phrase was final. The unhappy applicant was=
 naturally obliged to=20

temporarily retire from the game, at all events for that night. No man woul=
d have been idiot enough=20

to have asked a loan from a fellow player; that would have been quite contr=
ary to the unwritten=20

code of ethics of the Pandemonium Club: fathers have flinty hearts, but no =
fathers are so=20

proverbially flinty-hearted as the fathers of the card-room.  Among the pla=
yers were the usual club=20

_habitues_. They are much the same everywhere, the only difference being th=
eir clothes. The=20

_viveurs_ at the Pandemonium, in their faultless evening dress; the _gommeu=
x_ at Monte Carlo,=20

in their tall collars and their shiny boots; the Bohemians, in their tobacc=
o-scented and eccentric=20

garments; or the thieves playing at sixpenny loo in St. Luke's--all these p=
eople are at heart the=20

same. But we must not class in this unclean category Lord Spunyarn and his =
friend Haggard, who=20

were both playing at the big table. Haggard merely played for the excitemen=
t, and Spunyarn=20

because it was a lesser bore to play than to look on.  The game was baccara=
t.  The table is=20

covered with a tightly-stretched green cloth, which is divided by yellow li=
nes into fourteen spaces;=20

two larger ones in the centre of the table are the places of the banker and=
 the croupier; twelve=20

other spaces of a smaller size indicate the seats of the rest of the player=
s, or "punters," as they are=20

technically termed. The table is full, as has been stated: a bank has just =
been terminated, and the=20

banker retires, having lost the whole amount of his bank. The croupier, who=
 is, of course, a=20

of two or more colours, and also for a baby=E2=80=99s counterpane. For the =
