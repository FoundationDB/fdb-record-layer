island.  At last, charmed by the scene that lay before him, he took up his violin and began to play. 

more than point out that if these be not followed with care the patient may be not only not 

benefited, but made worse, and may even suffer considerable injury. The increase of pain caused 

by the improper application of certain currents is usually temporary and of minor consequence. But 

serious and lasting inflammations may be caused by the careless, ignorant, or injudicious use of 

the stronger currents internally, and metritis and peri-uterine inflammations have been not 

infrequently reported from the unskilled practice of the methods of Apostoli. These subjects, 

however, scarcely come under the scope of this article.  In addition, however, to these troubles we
