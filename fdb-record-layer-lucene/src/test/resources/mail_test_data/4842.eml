CONCLUSION.   Nevertheless, the gleaming blade of Alexander Filmore descended, and was 

buried in the fleshy part of Deadwood Dick's neck, making a wound, painful but not necessarily 

dangerous.  "You vile varmint," cried Calamity Jane, pulling the hammer of one of her revolvers 

back to full cock; "you cursed fool; don't you know that that only seals yer own miserable fate?" 

She took deliberate aim, but Dick interrupted her.  "Don't shoot, Jennie!" he gasped, the blood 

spurting from his wound; "this ain't none o' your funeral. Give three shrill whistles for my men, and 

they'll take care o' these hounds magical figure of a million was in sight, and the periodical was 

rapidly taking its place as one of the largest successes of the day.  Mr. Curtis's single 

proprietorship of the magazine had been changed into a corporation called The Curtis Publishing

signal was answered by a yell, and in a few seconds five road-agents came bounding up.  "Seize 

these two cusses, and guard 'em well!" Calamity said, grimly. "They are a precious pair, and in a 

few days, no doubt, never wavered in his faith in his proposition and his editor.  In the first he 

invested all he had and could borrow, and to the latter he gave his undivided support.  The two 

men worked together rather as father and son--as, curiously enough, they were to be later--than 

as employer and employee.  To Bok, the daily experience of seeing Mr. Curtis finance his 

proposition in sums that made the publishing world of that day gasp with sceptical astonishment
