The train was speeding downhill now, leaving ashes and lava behind, and hea=

bay where the sun was shining on the sea. Seen from above against a gray ba=
ckground of olives=20

and other trees not yet in leaf, the blossoming peaches and apricots had a =
filmy fairy look most=20

beautiful to behold. Behind frowned the great volcano still belching out cl=
ouds of smoke.  "I've a=20

different impression of old Vesuvius now I've seen his heart," said Peachy,=
 looking back for a last=20

farewell view.  "He still seems full of mischief, but I'm glad he played no=
 tricks while we were up=20

there," commented Delia.  "It's certainly one of the sights of the world, a=
nd I'm glad I've seen it,"=20

said Lorna. "Yes, I don't mind telling you I was scared when these explosio=
ns kept popping off. I=20

thought it was going to erupt and give us the benefit."  Irene, when they w=
ere back at the Villa=20

Camellia, patched up her squabble with Peachy, whom she had offended over t=
he rosemary=20

incident, and pressed the Vesuvius mascot upon her as a peace offering.  "I=
 didn't mean to grab=20

your flowers," she assured her. "Really, honest Injun, I didn't."  "Why, I'=
d forgotten all about it,"=20

declared her light-hearted chum. "I didn't mind a bit after my 'first mad' =
cooled off. Sorry if I was a=20

bear. No, I won't take your lucky hunchback. _Must_ I? Well, you're a dear!=
 I'd adore to have it. I=20

felt absolutely green when I saw you buy it. I'll hang him on a chain and w=

and I expect I'll just be a whiz at tennis to-morrow. Oh, isn't he funny? T=
hanks _ever_ so! I shall=20

keep him eternally as a memory of this ripping day up old Vesuvius."     CH=
APTER XII  Tar and=20

Feathers   After the decided triumph of their Anglo-American tableau at the=
 carnival, the Camellia=20

Buds held up their heads against their rivals, the Starry Circle. There was=
 hot competition between=20

the two sororities, each continually trying to "go one better" than the oth=
er. If the Stars held a=20

surreptitious candy party, the Buds, at the risk of detection by Rachel or =
some other prefect, gave=20

a dormitory stunt, throwing out hints afterwards of the fun they had enjoye=
d. Both societies=20

produced manuscript magazines, which were read in strict privacy at their m=
eetings, and=20

contained pointed allusions to their enemies' failings. No old-fashioned Wh=
igs and Tories could=20

have preserved a keener feud, the division between them waxing so serious t=
hat sometimes they=20

could hardly sit peaceably side by side in class.  "It's all Mabel," declar=
ed Jess. "Of course we had=20

two sororities before she came, but we weren't at daggers drawn like this. =
Mabel has spoiled=20

Bertha, and those two lead everything--the rest are simply sheep."  "Humph!=
 Pretty black sheep I=20

should call them," snorted Peachy. "They're siding with one another now to =
break rules. I don't=20

mean candy parties or just fun of that kind, but sneaking things: they're c=
heating abominably over=20

their exercises, and cribbing each other's translations wholesale. I found =
them at it yesterday and=20

told them what I thought about them. Some of them ought to know better. Ros=
amonde and Monica=20

aren't really that sort."  "They're bear-led by Bertha and Mabel. I lay all=
 the blame on them. It would=20

be a good thing for the Stars if that precious pair could be caught trippin=
g and taught a lesson."  "I=20

dare say it would but it's not an easy business," said Peachy gloomily. "Ma=
bel Hughes is an=20

extremely slippery young person, and she generally manages to keep out of o=
pen trouble. I don't=20

suppose any of the teachers, or even the prefects, have the least idea what=
 she's really like."=20

"And we can't go sneaking and tell we have nevertheless found in it a great=
 resemblance to some=20

plants of the urticeous kind, especially to the fig-tree, because of its te=
rminal stipulae in the shape=20

of a horn; and to the brosimum, on account of the structure of its fruit. M=
. Kunth would even have=20

preferred this last classification; if the description of the fruit, made o=
n the spot, and the nature of=20

the milk, which is acrid in the urticeae, and sweet in the sapotas, did not=
 seem to confirm our=20



conjecture. Bredemeyer saw, like us, the fruit, and not the flower of the c=
ow tree. He asserts that=20

he observed [sometimes?] two seeds, lying one against the other, as in the =
alligator pear-tree=20

(Laurus persea). Perhaps this botanist had the intention of expressing the =
same conformation of=20

the nucleus that Swartz indicates in the description of the brosimum--"nucl=
eus bilobus aut=20

bipartibilis." We have mentioned the places where this remarkable tree grow=
s: it will be easy for=20

botanical travellers to procure the flower of the palo de vaca and to remov=
e the doubts which still=20

remain, of the family to which it belongs.)  Whilst the palo de vaca manife=
sts the immense=20

fecundity and the bounty of nature in the torrid zone, it also reminds us o=
f the numerous causes=20

which favour in those fine climates the careless indolence of man. Mungo Pa=
rk has made known=20

the butter-tree of Bambarra, which M. De Candolle suspects to be of the fam=
ily of sapotas, as well=20

as our milk-tree. The plantain, the sago-tree, and the mauritia of the Orin=
oco, are as much bread-

trees as the rema of the South Sea. The fruits of the crescentia and the le=
cythis serve as vessels=20

for containing food, while the spathes of the palms, and the bark of trees,=
 furnish caps and=20

garments without a seam. The knots, or rather the interior cells of the tru=
nks of bamboos, supply=20

ladders, and facilitate in a thousand ways the construction of a hut, and t=
he fabrication of chairs,=20

beds, and other articles of furniture that compose the wealth of a savage h=
ousehold. In the midst=20

of this lavish vegetation, so varied in its productions, it requires very p=
owerful motives to excite=20

man to labour, to rouse him from his lethargy, and to unfold his intellectu=
al faculties.  Cacao and=20

cotton are cultivated at Barbula. We there found, what is very rare in that=
 country, two large=20

cylindrical machines for separating the cotton from its seed; one put in mo=
tion by an hydraulic=20

wheel, and the other by a wheel turned by mules. The overseer of the farm, =
who had constructed=20

these machines, was a native of Merida. He was acquainted with the road tha=
t leads from Nueva=20

Valencia, by the way of Guanare and Misagual, to Varinas; and thence by the=
 ravine of Collejones,=20

to the Paramo de Mucuchies and the mountains of Merida covered with eternal=
 snows. The=20

notions he gave us of the time requisite for going from Valencia by Varinas=
 to the Sierra Nevada,=20

and thence by the port of Torunos, and the Rio Santo Domingo, to San Fernan=
do de Apure, were=20

of infinite value to us. It can scarcely be imagined in Europe, how difficu=
lt it is to obtain accurate=20

information in a country where the communications are so rare; and where di=
stances are=20

diminished or exaggerated according to the desire that may be felt to encou=
rage the traveller, or to=20

deter him from his purpose. I had resolved to visit the eastern extremity o=
f the Cordilleras of New=20

Grenada, where they lose themselves in the paramos of Timotes and Niquitao.=
 I learned at=20

Barbula, that this excursion would retard our arrival at the Orinoco thirty=
-five days. This delay=20

appeared to us so much the longer, as the rains were expected to begin soon=
er than usual. We=20

had=20


_
matter for ourselves."  It was undoubtedly true that with the advent of Mab=
el Hughes a new and=20

unpleasant element had crept into the Transition. Such an influence is ofte=
n very subtle. Girls who=20

a term ago would not have condescended to any form of cheating, accepted a =
lower standard of=20

honor, and tried to excuse themselves on the ground that they merely did th=
e same as others. The=20

fact that the Camellia Buds did not share in the dishonesty was set down to=
 priggishness on their=20

part, Bertha and Mabel often making jokes at their expense. One day an unpl=
easant matter=20

happened in the school. It was the fortnightly examination, and when the Tr=
ansition took their=20

places at their desks, with sheets of foolscap and lists of questions, it w=
as found that the inkwells=20

of each member of the Camellia Buds had been stuffed up with blotting-paper=
, so that it was=20

impossible for them to dip their pens.  Miss Bickford, who did not even kno=
w of the existence of=20

the sororities, and therefore could not perceive the significance of the fa=
ct that certain girls were=20

thus served while others went free, flew into a towering rage, and accused =
Peachy, whose=20

reputation as a practical joker was not altogether undeserved, of having pl=
ayed the shameless=20

"joke." Peachy, smarting with the injustice of the false charge, forgot her=
self and retorted hotly.=20

"Priscilla Proctor!" thundered Miss Bickford. "I have mountains covered wit=
h perpetual snow, at=20

Quito, Peru, and Mexico; and it appeared to me still more prudent to relinq=
uish our project of=20

visiting the mountains of Merida, since by so doing we might miss the real =
object of our journey,=20

that of ascertaining by astronomical observations the point of communicatio=
n between the=20

Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and the river Amazon. We returned in consequence fr=
om Barbula to=20

Guacara, to take leave of the family of the Marquis del Toro, and pass thre=
e days more on the=20

borders of the lake.  It was the carnival season, and all was gaiety. The s=
ports in which the people=20

indulge, and which are called carnes tollendas,* assume occasionally somewh=
at of a savage=20

character. (* Or "farewell to flesh." The word carnival has the same meanin=
g, these sports being=20

always held just before the commencement of Lent.) Some led an ass loaded w=
ith water, and,=20

where-ever they found a window open, inundated the apartment within by mean=
s of a pump.=20

Others carried bags filled with hairs of picapica;* (* Dolichos pruriens (c=
owage).) and blew the hair,=20

which causes a great irritation of the skin, into the faces of those who pa=
ssed by.  From Guacara=20

we returned to Nueva Valencia. We found there a few French emigrants, the o=
nly ones we saw=20

during five years passed in the Spanish colonies. Notwithstanding the ties =
of blood which unite the=20

royal families of France and=20


_
high spirits, but I never allow impertinence and insubordination. Leave the=
 room instantly and go=20

upstairs to the sanatorium. You'll remain there until you apologize."  A de=
ad hush fell over the=20

class as Peachy, with flaming eyes and chin in the air, flounced out and sl=
ammed the door after=20

her. It was an extreme permitted to take refuge in that part of the New Wor=
ld, where man with=20

such facility finds food and shelter. Beyond the Atlantic, the United State=
s of America afford the=20

only asylum to misfortune. A government, strong because it is free, confidi=
ng because it is just,=20

has nothing to fear in giving refuge to the=20
