or charity may warrant, we have to admit that there is only too much _
the time of _my absence_ seem tedious to you, or did ye desire that indigna=
tion from your Lord=20

should befall you, and therefore did ye break your promise to me, _and abst=
ain from coming after=20

one?_--They answered, We did not break our promise to thee of our own autho=
rity; but we were=20

made to carry loads of the ornaments of the people _of Pharaoh_ (_which the=
 children of Israel=20

had borrowed of them under pretence of_ [requiring them for] _a wedding, an=
d which remained in=20

their possession_), and we cast them _into the fire, by order of Es-Samiree=
_. And in like manner=20

also Es-Samiree cast _their ornaments which he had, and some of the dust wh=
ich he had taken=20

from the traces of the hoofs of the horse of Gabriel;_ and he produced unto=
 them a corporeal calf,=20

_of flesh and blood_, which lowed, _by reason of the dust, the property of =
which is to give life to=20

that into which it is put; and he had put it, after he had moulded the calf=
, into its mouth_. And they=20

(_namely, Es-Samiree and his followers_) said, This is your god, and the go=
d of Moses; but he=20

hath forgotten _his lord here, and gone to seek him. God saith_, But did th=
ey not see that it=20

returned them not an answer, nor was able to cause them hurt or profit? And=
 Aaron had said unto=20

them, before _the return of Moses_, O my people, ye are only tried by it; a=
nd verily your Lord is=20

the Compassionate; therefore follow me, _by worshipping Him_, and obey my c=
ommand. They=20

replied, We will by no means cease to be devoted to _the worship of_ it unt=
il Moses return unto us.=20

_Moses_ said _after his return_, O Aaron, what hindered thee, when thou saw=
est that they had=20

gone astray, from following me? Hast thou then been disobedient to my comma=
nd, _by remaining=20

among them who worshipped another than God_? --He answered, O son of my mot=
her, seize me=20

not by my beard (_for he had taken hold of his beard with his left hand_), =
nor by [the hair of] my=20

head (_for he had taken hold of his hair with his right hand, in anger_). V=
erily I feared lest _if I=20

followed thee (for a company of those who worshipped the calf would inevita=
bly have followed=20

me)_ thou shouldst say, Thou hast made a division among the children of Isr=
ael, and hast not=20

waited for my sentence. _Moses_ said, And what was thy motive _for doing as=
 thou hast_, O=20

Samiree? He answered, I saw that which they saw not;[298] therefore I took =
a handful _of dust_=20

from the foot-marks _of the horse_ of the apostle _Gabriel_, and cast it _i=
nto the molten calf_; and=20

thus my soul allured me _to take a handful of the dust above-mentioned, and=
 to cast it upon that=20

which had no life, that it might have life; and I saw that thy people had d=
emanded of thee that thou=20

wouldst make them a god; so my soul suggested to me that this calf should b=
e their god. Moses_=20

said _unto him_, Then get thee gone _from among us_, and [the punishment] f=
or thee during _the=20

period of thy_ life [shall be], that thou shalt say _unto whomsoever thou s=
halt see_, Touch _me_=20

not:--(_so he used to wander about the desert, and when he touched any one,=
 or any one touched=20

him, they both became affected with a burning fever:_) and verily for thee =
is a threat which thou=20

shalt by no means find to be false. And look at thy god, to _the worship of=
_ which thou hast=20

continued devoted. We will assuredly burn it: then we will assuredly reduce=
 it to powder and=20

scatter it in the sea. (_And Moses, after he had slaughtered it, did this._=
) Your deity is God only,=20

except whom there is no deity. He comprehendeth all things by _His_ knowled=
ge.--Thus, _O=20

Mohammad_, do We relate unto thee accounts of what hath happened heretofore=
; and We have=20

given thee, from Us, an admonition; _namely the Kur-an_.     (xx. 88-99.)  =
 And they were made to=20

drink down the calf into their hearts,[299] (_that is, the love of it mingl=
ed with their hearts as drink=20

mingleth_,) because of their unbelief.     (ii. 87.)   [Remember, O childre=
n of Israel,] when Moses=20

said unto his people _who worshipped the calf_, O my people, verily ye have=
 injured your own=20



souls by your taking to yourselves the calf _as a god_; therefore turn with=
 repentance unto your=20

Creator _from the worship of it_, and slay one another: (_that is, let the =
innocent among you slay=20

the criminal_:) this will be best for you in the estimation of your Creator=
. _And He aided you to do=20

that, sending upon you a black cloud, lest one of you should see another an=
d have compassion on=20

him, until there were slain of you about seventy thousand._ And _thereupon_=
 He became=20

propitious towards you, _accepting your repentance_; for He is the Very Pro=
pitious, the Merciful.=20

(ii. 51.)   [Remember also, O children of Israel,] when ye said, _having go=
ne forth with Moses to=20

beg pardon of God for your worship of the calf, and having heard his words_=
, O Moses, we will not=20

believe thee until we see God manifestly:--whereupon the vehement sound ass=
ailed you, _and ye=20

died_, while ye beheld _what happened to you_. Then We raised you to life a=
fter ye had been=20

dead, that peradventure ye might give thanks.[300]     (ii. 52, 53.)   And =
Moses chose _from_ his=20

people seventy men, _of those who had not worshipped the calf, by the comma=
nd of God_, at the=20

time appointed by Us _for their coming to ask pardon for their companions' =
worship of the calf; and=20

he went forth with them_; and when the convulsion (_the violent earthquake_=
) took them away=20

(_because, saith Ibn-'Abbas, they did not separate themselves from their pe=
ople when the latter=20

worshipped the calf_), _Moses_ said, O my Lord, if Thou hadst pleased, Thou=
 hadst destroyed=20

them before _my going forth with them, that the children of Israel might ha=
ve beheld it and might=20

not suspect me_; and me [also]. Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the foo=
lish among us have=20

done? It is naught but Thy trial: Thou wilt cause to err thereby whom Thou =
pleasest, and Thou wilt=20

rightly guide whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our guardian; and do Thou forgiv=
e us and have mercy=20

upon us; for Thou art the best of those who forgive: and appoint for us in =
this world what is good,=20

and in the world to come; for unto Thee have we turned with repentance.--_G=
od_ replied, I will=20

afflict with My punishment whom I please, and My mercy extendeth over every=
thing _in the world_;=20

and I will appoint it, _in the world to come_, for those who fear and give =
the legal alms, and those=20

who believe on Our signs, who shall follow the apostle, the illiterate [or =
Gentile, _i.e._, Arab]=20

prophet, _Mohammad_, whom they shall find written down with them in the Pen=
tateuch and the=20

Gospel, _by his name and his description_. He will command them that which =
is right, and forbid=20

them that which is evil; and will allow them as lawful the good things _amo=
ng those forbidden in=20

their law_, and prohibit them the impure, _as carrion and other things_, an=
d will take off from them=20

their burden and the yokes that were upon them, _as the slaying of a soul_ =
[for an atonement] _in=20

repentance, and the cutting off of the mark left by impurity_. And those wh=
o shall believe in him=20

and honour him and assist him and follow the light which shall be sent down=
 with him, _namely the=20

Kur-an_, these shall be the prosperous.     (vii. 154-156).   And _remember=
_ when Moses said=20

unto his people, O my people, remember the favour of God towards you, since=
 He hath appointed=20

prophets from among you, and made you princes (_masters of servants and oth=
er attendants_),=20

and given you what He hath not given any [other] of the peoples (_as the ma=
nna and the quails=20

and other things_). O my people, enter the Holy Land which God hath decreed=
 for you (_namely=20

Syria_), and turn not back, lest ye turn losers.--They replied, O Moses, ve=
rily there is in it a=20

gigantic people, _of the remains of the tribe of 'Ad_, and we will not ente=
r it until they go forth from=20

it; but if they go forth from it, then we will enter.--[Thereupon] two men,=
 of those who feared _to=20

disobey God, namely Joshua and Caleb, of the chiefs whom Moses sent to disc=
over the=20

circumstances of the giants, and_ upon whom God had conferred favour, _and =
who had=20



concealed what they had seen of the state of the giants, excepting from Mos=
es, wherefore the=20

other chiefs became cowardly_, said _unto them_, Enter ye upon them through=
 the gate _of the=20

city, and fear them not; for they are bodies without hearts_; and when ye e=
nter it, ye overcome;=20

and upon God place your dependence, if ye be believers.--[But] they said, O=
 Moses, we will never=20

enter it while they remain therein. Therefore go thou and thy Lord, and fig=
ht: for we remain here.--

_Then Moses_ said, O my Lord, verily I am not master of any but myself and =
my brother: therefore=20

distinguish between us and the unrighteous people.--_God_ replied, Verily i=
t (_namely the Holy=20

Land_) shall be forbidden them forty years; they shall wander in perplexity=
 in the land: and be not=20

thou solicitous for the unrighteous people.--_The land_ [through which they=
 wandered] _was_=20

[only] _nine leagues_ [in extent]. _They used to journey during the night w=
ith diligence; but in the=20

morning they found themselves in the place whence they had set forth; and t=
hey journeyed during=20

the day in like manner. Thus Jean Clopinel, translated them as early as 128=
5. In the fifteenth=20

century they were printed, and since then numberless translations, imitatio=
ns, and perversions=20

have appeared. We need feel no doubt, therefore, that we are reading an act=
ual love letter, dating=20

from about 1135, when we follow the glowing lines addressed to Abelard by H=
eloise.  There is=20

naturally a marked difference in the tone of the letters, due to a differen=
ce of character and to=20

different environment. While passages in the first letter of Heloise are al=
most lyric in their intensity,=20

like the words of a Juliet, at times almost of a Sappho, the reply from Abe=
lard is apparently cold in=20

many places, certainly constrained, only occasionally throbbing an answer t=
o the touch of her=20

whom he had loved. As we shall have some very unfavorable things to say of =
Abelard's character=20

in general, it seems but fair to say that this constraint and evident desir=
e to suppress the violence=20

of Heloise's love and to direct her thoughts to the duties of her calling c=
annot be charged against=20

him as a fault. Not one of his replies shows lack of affection. In justice =
to him we may say that he=20

was seeking to teach her resignation; to divert her thoughts from the past,=
 where was only storm=20

and shipwreck in their brief love.  It is pleasant to believe that, when he=
 wrote these letters,=20

Abelard was in some sort aware of and repentant for the great wrong he had =
done. There was=20

never a more disgustingly deliberate and inhumanly selfish seduction than t=
hat of Heloise by=20

Abelard. He was by nature excessively vain of his personal appearance no le=
ss than of his=20

attainments. We have seen how he speaks of Anselm; in the same tone, in the=
 same florid, turgid,=20

pedantic style he was constantly boasting of his achievements. Having won a=
ll the laurels=20

available in the intellectual world, he sought new experiences. It has been=
 remarked, not inaptly,=20

that this sudden awakening of the man in the scholar is a reproduction of t=
he Faust legend with=20

living actors. As the scholar, Faust, bent with age and labors, is suddenly=
 transformed into the=20

youthful, ardent, and selfish lover, so Abelard's long dormant passions tra=
nsform him. But his real=20

nature is not altered; he is always fundamentally selfish. The very terms i=
n which he relates his=20

first feelings toward Heloise are almost brutal. He praises the unusual ext=
ent of her knowledge, an=20

attraction of special force for him; and then, "physically, too, she was no=
t bad." While he=20

condescends to allow that Heloise was "not bad" as regards looks, it is qui=
te another tale with=20

regard to himself: "Seeing her adorned with all the charms that attract lov=
ers, I thought to enter=20

into a liaison with her, and I felt sure that nothing would be easier than =
to succeed in this design. I=20

enjoyed such reputation, and had so much grace of youth and good looks, tha=
t I thought I should=20

have no rebuff to fear, whoever might be the woman whom I should honor with=
 my love."  All=20



through the man's career one finds the same exaggerated self-esteem, the sa=
me preoccupation=20

with his own selfish interests. He positively chuckles over the perfect suc=
cess of his ruse to=20

deceive Fulbert. "Fulbert was fond of his money. Add to this the fact that =
he was eager to procure=20

for his niece all possible advantages in belles-lettres. By flattering thes=
e two passions, I easily won=20

his consent, and obtained what I desired.... He urged me to devote to her e=
ducation all of my=20

spare time, by day as well as by night, and not to fear to punish her shoul=
d I find her at fault. I=20

wondered at his naivete!... Entrusting her to me not only for instruction b=
ut for chastisement, what=20

was this but allowing full licence to my desires and furnishing me, even ag=
ainst my will, with the=20

opportunity of conquering by blows and threats if caresses should be unavai=
ling?" When he has=20

ruined this niece, of whom Fulbert was so proud, a moment of apparent remor=
se comes to him as=20

he witnesses the old man's distress: "I promised him any reparation which i=
t might please him to=20

demand; I protested that what I had done would surprise no one who had ever=
 felt the violence of=20

love and who knew into what abysses women had, since the very beginning of =
the world, plunged=20

the greatest men. To appease him still further, I offered him a sort of ato=
nement _far greater than=20

anything he could have hoped: I proposed to marry her whom I had seduced, o=
n condition only=20

that the marriage be kept secret, so as not to injure my reputation._" The =
italics are ours; they can=20

but faintly indicate our astonishment at the impudence no less than the sel=
fishness of this piece of=20

condescension. This passage is followed by four pages devoted to pedantic a=
rguments, enforced=20

by appeal to historic cases, seeking to prove how prejudicial a thing marri=
age is to holy men, to=20

wise men, to great men, and that therefore it must be so to Abelard. All th=
is argument he ascribes=20

to Heloise, who implored him not to marry her; but the tone is his own; the=
re is never a thought of=20

what it may mean for her, only for himself. In the same way, after Fulbert =
has taken vengeance on=20

him, in two pages of lamentations over his fate there is not one word of pi=
ty for the grief of the=20

woman who had given all to him. It is: How shall I appear in public? What a=
 wreck I have made of=20

my life! Not once: How shall I care for Heloise? What amends can I make her=
 for the wreck of her=20

young life? One need not wonder--since this was the sentiment of the period=
--that he fears the=20

vengeance of God only because he has broken the rule of continence, not at =
all because he has=20

led into wrong doing one who trusted and loved him.  The shame of his punis=
hment and the griefs=20

of his life do seem to have made some impression on him, however. Abelard a=
ctually learns to=20

speak of "the shameful treachery of which I was guilty towards your uncle."=
 One can but compare=20

him with Rousseau; those who have read the latter's fascinating, eloquent, =
but disgusting=20

_Confessions_ cannot fail to remember that there is the same inordinate van=
ity and selfishness in=20

them as young men, the same misery and insane fear of foes, sometimes purel=
y imaginary, in=20

them as old men.  Beginning as a vulgar passion, there is no doubt that Abe=
lard's feeling for=20

Heloise afterward became more honorable. After their separation, and the so=
ftening, chastening=20

influence of his misfortunes, he developed for her a real affection. Though=
 there is a constraint, a=20

coldness in the address of his letters, and often too much solicitude about=
 form and too much=20

display of erudition, the heart of the man is moved in spite of himself. He=
 begins his first letter to=20

her: "To Heloise, his well-beloved sister in Christ, Abelard, her brother i=
n Christ;" the second: "To=20

the spouse of Christ, the servant of that same Christ." But he shows a tend=
erness for her at the=20

very start; if he has not written to her and advised her before, he says, i=
t is because he had such=20

absolute confidence in her judgment. He calls her his "sister, once so dear=
 in the flesh," and sends=20



her a Psalter, which she is to use in imploring the Divine mercy for him. H=
e will give counsel to her=20

and to her nuns, if she desires it. And here he can dissemble no longer: "B=
ut enough of your holy=20

congregation,... it is to you, to you whose goodness will, I know, have suc=
h power with God, that I=20

address myself.... Remember in your prayers him who is your very own." He s=
ends a form of=20

prayer which she and her nuns are to use for him. Then the man once more ge=
ts the better of the=20

monk: "If it chance that the Lord deliver me up into the hands of mine enem=
ies, and that they,=20

victorious, put me to death, or if, while far from you, some accident shoul=
d bring me to that goal=20

whither all flesh is tending, let my body, whether it be already buried or =
simply abandoned, be=20

brought under your care, I implore you, to your cemetery."  It is pleasant =
to read his letters, after=20

one has become convinced that the man really loved Heloise; then, one finds=
 in them gentleness=20

and consideration for her feelings. With patience and adroitness, he answer=
s the questions she=20

asks, distracts her thoughts, still too much intent on him, and works out f=
or her an elaborate=20

scheme of government for use in the Paraclete; and one can understand that =
this, if anything,=20

would have been a consolation to Heloise, to feel that the whole tenor of h=
er life was regulated by=20

the affectionate legislation of the man whom she had loved.  About the love=
 of Heloise we need=20

not hesitate. "Truly, she did love him," says the old chronicler of Saint M=
artin de Tours, and the=20

ages since have been but echoing this. We must try, however, to form some m=
ore definite idea of=20

the personality of one who is perhaps the greatest figure in an actual roma=
nce that the world has=20

known. Of her beauty there can be no question; but we neither know nor very=
 greatly care whether=20

she was tall and dark or slender and fair. Probably we should be safe in as=
suming, on general=20

principles, that she was a blonde, since the predilection for that style of=
 beauty was so strong that=20

Saint Bernard devotes a whole sermon to proving that=20


_
until all of them had become extinct, excepting those who had not attained =
the age of twenty=20

years; and it is said that they were six hundred thousand. Aaron and Moses =
died in the desert; and=20

mercy was their lot: but punishment was the lot of those. And Moses begged =
his Lord, when he=20

was about to die, that He would bring him as near as a stone's throw to the=
 Holy Land: wherefore=20

He did so. And Joshua was made a prophet after the forty [years], and he ga=
ve orders to fight=20

against the giants. So he went with those who were with him, and fought aga=
inst them: and it was=20

Friday; and the sun stood still for him awhile, until he had made an end of=
 fighting against them._=20

(v. 23-29).   Karoon[301] [or Korah] was of the people of Moses (_he was th=
e son of his paternal=20

uncle, and the son of his maternal aunt, and he believed in him_); but he b=
ehaved insolently=20

towards them; for We had bestowed upon him such treasures that their keys w=
ere heavy burdens=20

for a company of men endowed with strength, _in number, as some say, sevent=
y; and some, forty;=20

and some, ten; and some, another number. Remember when his people (the beli=
evers among the=20

children of Israel)_ said unto him, Rejoice not _exultingly in the abundanc=
e of thy wealth_; for God=20

loveth not those who _so_ rejoice; but seek to attain, by means of the _wea=
lth_ which God hath=20

given thee, the latter abode [of Paradise], _by expending thy wealth in the=
 service of God_; and=20

neglect not thy part in this world, _to work therein for the world to come_=
; but be beneficent _unto=20

mankind, by bestowing alms_, as God hath been beneficent unto thee; and see=
k not to act=20

corruptly in the earth; for God loveth not the corrupt doers. He replied, I=
 have only been given it on=20

account of the knowledge that I possess. _For he was the most learned of th=
e children of Israel in=20

the Law, after Moses and Aaron. God saith_, Did he not know that God had de=
stroyed before him,=20

of the generations, those that were mightier than he in strength and who ha=
d amassed more=20

abundance _of wealth_? And the wicked shall not be asked respecting their s=
ins, _because God=20

knoweth them: therefore they shall be sent into the Fire without a reckonin=
g_. And _Karoon_ went=20

forth unto his people in his pomp, _with his many dependants mounted, adorn=
ed with garments of=20

gold and silk, upon decked horses and mules_. Those who desired the present=
 life said, O would=20

that we had the like of that which hath been bestowed on Karoon _in this wo=
rld_! Verily he is=20

possessed of great good fortune!--But those unto whom knowledge _of what Go=
d hath promised=20

in the world to come_ had been given, said _unto them_, Woe to you! The rew=
ard of God _in the=20

world to come_ (_which is Paradise_) is better for him who believeth and wo=
rketh righteousness=20

_than that which hath been bestowed on Karoon in the present world_; and no=
ne shall receive it=20

but the patient _in the service of God_. And We caused the earth to cleave =
asunder and swallow=20

up him and his mansion,[302] and he had no forces to defend him, in the pla=
ce of God, nor was he=20

of the [number of the] saved. And the next morning, those who had wished fo=
r his place the day=20

before said, Aha! God enlargeth provision unto whom He pleaseth of His serv=
ants, and is sparing=20

_of it unto whom He pleaseth!_ Had not God been gracious unto us, He had ca=
used [the earth] to=20

cleave asunder and swallow up us! Aha! the ungrateful _for His benefits_ do=
 not prosper!     (xxviii.=20

76-82.)   _Remember_, [O children of Israel,] when Moses said unto his peop=
le (_when one of=20

them had been slain, whose murderer was not known, and they asked him to be=
g God that He=20

would discover him to them, wherefore he supplicated Him_), Verily God comm=
andeth you to=20

sacrifice a cow. They said, Dost thou make a jest of us? He said, I beg God=
 to preserve me from=20

being _one_ of the foolish. _So when they knew that he decidedly intended_ =
[what he had=20

ordered], they said, Supplicate for us thy Lord, that He may manifest to us=
 what she is; _that is,=20



what is her age_. _Moses_ replied, He saith, She is a cow neither old nor y=
oung; _but_ of a middle=20

age, between those _two_: therefore do as ye are commanded. They said, Supp=
licate for us thy=20

Lord, that He may manifest to us what is her colour. He replied, He saith, =
She is a red[303] cow:=20

her colour is very bright: she rejoiceth the beholders. They said, Supplica=
te for us thy Lord, that He=20

may manifest to us what she is, _whether she be a pasturing or a working co=
w_; for cows _of the=20

description mentioned_ are to us like one another; and we, if God please, s=
hall indeed be rightly=20

directed _to her_. (_In a tradition it is said, Had they not said, 'If God =
please,'--she had not ever=20

been manifested to them._) He replied, He saith, She is a cow not subdued _=
by work_ that=20

plougheth the ground, nor doth she water the field: [she is] free _from def=
ects and the marks of=20

work_; there is no colour in her different from the rest of her colour. The=
y said, Now thou hast=20

brought the truth. _And they sought her, and found her in the possession of=
 the young man who=20

acted piously towards his mother, and they bought her for as much gold as h=
er hide would=20

contain._[304] Then they sacrificed her; but they were near to leaving it u=
ndone, on _account of=20

the greatness of her price_. (_And in a tradition it is said, Had they sacr=
ificed any cow whatever,=20

He had satisfied them: but they acted hardly towards themselves; so God act=
ed hardly towards=20

them._) And when ye slew a soul, and contended together respecting it, (and=
 God brought forth [to=20

light] that which ye did conceal--_this is the beginning of the story_ [and=
 was the occasion of the=20

order to sacrifice this particular cow,]) We said, Strike him (_that is, th=
e slain person_) with part of=20

her. _So he was struck with her tongue, or the root of her tail, or, as som=
e say, with her right thigh;=20

whereupon he came to life, and said, Such-a-one and such-a-one slew me,--to=
 the two sons of his=20

uncle. And he died. They two_ [the murderers] _were therefore deprived of t=
he inheritance, and=20

were slain._[305] Thus God raiseth to life the dead, and showeth you His si=
gns (_the proof of His=20

power_), that peradventure ye may understand, _and know that He who is able=
 to raise to life one=20

soul is able to raise to life many souls._ Then your hearts became hard, _O=
 ye Jews, so as not to=20

accept the truth_, after that, and they [were] as stones, or more hard: for=
 of stones there are=20

indeed some from which rivers gush forth; and of them there are indeed some=
 that cleave asunder=20

and water issueth from them; and of them there are indeed some that fall do=
wn through fear of=20

God; _whereas your hearts are not impressed, nor do they grow soft, nor do =
they become=20

humble._ But God is not heedless of that which ye do: _He only reserveth yo=
u unto your time._=20

(ii. 63-69.)   _Remember_ when Moses said to his young man _Joshua the son =
of Nun, who=20

served him and acquired knowledge from him_, I will not cease _to go forwar=
d_ until I reach the=20

place where the two seas (_the Sea of Greece and the Sea of Persia_) meet, =
or travel for a long=20

space of time. And when they reached the place where they (_the two seas_) =
met they forgot their=20

fish: _Joshua forgot to take it up, on their departure; and Moses forgot to=
 remind him_; and it made=20

its way in the sea by a hollow passage, _God withholding the water from it_=
. And when they had=20

passed beyond _that place, and proceeded until the time of the morning-meal=
 on the following=20

day_, [Moses] said unto his young man, Bring us our morning-meal: we have e=
xperienced fatigue=20

from this our journey. He replied, What thinkest thou? When we repaired to =
the rock to rest _at=20

that place_, I forgot the fish, and none made me forget to mention it but t=
he devil; and it made its=20

way in the sea in a wonderful manner.--_Moses_ said, That (_namely our loss=
 of the fish_) is what=20

we were desiring; _for it is a sign unto us of our finding him whom we seek=
_. And they returned by=20

the way that they had come, following the footsteps, _and came to the rock_=
. And they found one=20



of Our servants (_namely El-Khidr_[306]) unto whom We had granted mercy fro=
m Us (_that is the=20

gift of prophecy in the opinion of some, and the rank of a saint according =
to another opinion which=20

most of the learned hold_), and whom We had taught knowledge from Us respec=
ting things=20

unseen.--_El-Bukharee hath related a tradition stating that Moses performed=
 the office of a=20

preacher among the children of Israel, and was asked who was the most knowi=
ng of men; to which=20

he answered, I:--whereupon God blamed him for this, because he did not refe=
r the knowledge=20

thereof to Him. And God said unto him by revelation, Verily I have a servan=
t at the place where the=20

two seas meet, and he is more knowing than thou. Moses said, O my Lord, and=
 how shall I meet=20

with him? He answered, Thou shalt take with thee a fish, and put it into a =
measuring-vessel, and=20

where thou shalt lose the fish, there is he. So he took a fish, and put it =
into a vessel. Then he=20

departed, and Joshua the son of Nun departed with him, until they came to t=
he rock, where they=20

laid down their heads and slept. And the fish became agitated in the vessel=
, and escaped from it,=20

and fell into the sea, and it made its way in the sea by a hollow passage, =
God withholding the=20

water from the fish so that it became like a vault over it: and when Moses'=
 companion awoke, he=20

forgot to inform him of the fish._  Moses said unto him [namely El-Khidr], =
Shall I follow thee, that=20

thou mayest teach me [part] of that which thou hast been taught, for a dire=
ction _unto me_? He=20

answered, Verily thou canst not have patience with me. For how canst thou b=
e patient with respect=20

to that whereof thou comprehendest not the knowledge?--He replied, Thou sha=
lt find me, if God=20

please, patient; and I will not disobey any command of thine. He said, Then=
 if thou follow me, ask=20

me not respecting anything: _but be patient_ until I give thee an account t=
hereof. _And Moses=20

assented to his condition._ And they departed, _walking along the shore of =
the sea_, until, when=20

they embarked in the ship _that passed by them_, he (El-Khidr) made a hole =
in it, _by pulling out a=20

plank or two planks from it on the outside by means of an axe when it reach=
ed the middle of the=20

sea. Moses_ said _unto him_, Hast thou made a hole in it that thou mayest d=
rown its people?=20

Thou hast done a grievous thing.--(_But it is related that the water entere=
d not the hole._) He=20

replied, Did I not say that thou couldst not have patience with me? [Moses]=
 said, Chastise me not=20

for my forgetfulness, nor impose on me a difficulty in my case.--And they d=
eparted, _after they had=20

gone forth from the vessel_, _walking on_, until, when they found a boy _wh=
o had not attained the=20

age of knowing right and wrong, playing with other children, and he was the=
 most beautiful of them=20

in countenance_, and he (_El-Khidr_) slew him, _Moses_ said _unto him_, Has=
t thou slain an=20

innocent soul, without _his having slain_ a soul? Thou hast done an iniquit=
ous thing.--He replied,=20

Did I not say that thou couldst not have patience with me? [Moses] said, If=
 I ask thee concerning=20

anything after this _time_, suffer me not to accompany thee. Now hast thou =
received from me an=20

excuse _for thy separating thyself from me_.--And they departed [and procee=
ded] until, when they=20

came to the people of a city (_which was Antioch[307]_), they asked food of=
 its people; but they=20

refused to entertain them: and they found therein a wall, _the height where=
of was a hundred=20

cubits_, which was about to fall down; whereupon he (_El-Khidr_) set it upr=
ight _with his hand_.=20

_Moses_ said _unto him_, If thou wouldst, thou mightest have obtained pay f=
or it, _since they did=20

not entertain us, notwithstanding our want of food_. _El-Khidr_ said _unto =
him_, This shall be a=20

separation between me and thee; _but before my separation from thee_, I wil=
l declare unto thee=20

the interpretation of that which thou couldst not bear with patience.  As t=
o the vessel, it belonged to=20

_ten_ poor men,[308] who pursued their business on the sea; and I desired t=
o render it unsound;=20



for there was behind them a king, _an unbeliever_, who took every _sound_ v=
essel by force. And=20

as to the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would tran=
sgress against them=20

rebelliously and impiously: _for, according to a tradition related by Musli=
m, he was constituted by=20

nature an unbeliever, and had he lived he had so acted_; wherefore we desir=
ed that their Lord=20

should create for them a better than he in virtue, and [one] more disposed =
than he to filial piety.=20

_And God created for them a daughter, who married a prophet, and gave birth=
 to a prophet, by=20

means of whom God directed a people to the right way_. And as to the wall, =
it belonged to two=20

orphan youths in the city, and beneath it was a treasure _buried_, _of gold=
 and silver_, belonging=20

to them; and their father was a righteous man; and thy Lord desired that th=
ey should attain their=20

age of strength and take forth their treasure through the mercy of thy Lord=
. And I did it not=20

(_namely what hath been mentioned_) of mine own will, _but by direction of =
God_. This is the=20

interpretation of that which thou couldst not bear with patience.     (Chap=
. xviii. 59-81.)     SAUL,=20

DAVID, SOLOMON.   Hast thou not considered the assembly of the children of =
Israel after _the=20

death of_ Moses, when they said unto a prophet of theirs, _namely Samuel_, =
Set up for us a king,=20

_under whom_ we will fight in the way of God? He said _unto them_, If fight=
ing be prescribed as=20

incumbent on you, will ye, peradventure, abstain from fighting? They replie=
d, And wherefore=20

should we not fight in the way of God, since we have been expelled from our=
 habitations and our=20

children _by their having been taken prisoners and slain?_--_The people of =
Goliath_ [Jaloot] _had=20

done thus unto them_.--But when fighting was commanded them, they turned ba=
ck, excepting a=20

few of them, _who crossed the river with Saul_ [Taloot], _as will be relate=
d_. And God knoweth the=20

offenders. _And the prophet begged his Lord to send a king; whereupon he co=
nsented to send=20

Saul._ And their prophet said unto them, Verily God hath set up Saul as you=
r king. They said, How=20

shall he have the dominion over us, when we are more worthy of the dominion=
 than he, (_for he=20

was not of the royal lineage, nor of the prophetic, and he was a tanner, or=
 a tender of flocks or=20

herds,_) and he hath not been endowed with ample wealth? He replied, Verily=
 God hath chosen=20

him _as king_ over you, and increased him in largeness of knowledge and of =
body, (_for he was=20

the wisest of the children of Israel at that time, and the most comely of t=
hem, and the most perfect=20

of them in make,_) and God giveth his kingdom unto whom He pleaseth; and Go=
d is ample _in His=20

beneficence_, knowing _with respect to him who is worthy of the kingdom_.--=
And their prophet=20

said unto them, _when they demanded of him a sign in proof of his kingship_=
, Verily the sign of his=20

kingship shall be that the ark shall come unto you (_in it were the images =
of the prophets: God=20

sent it down unto Adam, and it passed into their possession; but the Amalek=
ites took it from them=20

by force: and they used to seek victory thereby over their enemy, and to ad=
vance it in the fight,=20

and to trust in it, as He--whose name be exalted!--hath said_); therein [sh=
all be] tranquillity from=20

your Lord,[309] and relics of what the family of Moses and the family of Aa=
ron have left: _namely,=20

the two shoes (or sandals) of Moses, and his rod, and the turban of Aaron, =
and a measure of the=20

manna that used to descend upon them, and the fragments of the tables_ [of =
the Law]: the angels=20

shall bear it. Verily in this shall be a sign unto you _of his kingship_, i=
f ye be believers.=20

_Accordingly the angels bore it between heaven and earth, while they looked=
 at it, until they=20

placed it by Saul; whereupon they acknowledged his kingship, and hastened t=
o the holy war; and=20

he chose of their young men seventy thousand._  And when Saul went forth wi=
th the troops _from=20

Jerusalem, and it was violently hot weather, and they demanded of him water=
_, he said, Verily=20



God will try you by a river, _that the obedient among you, and the disobedi=
ent, may appear_,=20

(_and it was between the Jordan and Palestine_,) and whoso drinketh thereof=
, he is not of my=20

party (but he who tasteth not thereof, he is of my party), excepting him wh=
o taketh forth a draught=20

in his hand, _and is satisfied therewith, not adding to it; for he is of my=
 party_;--then they drank=20

thereof abundantly, excepting a few of them, _who were content only with th=
e handful of water. It=20

is related that it sufficed them for their own drinking and for their beast=
s, and they were three=20

hundred, and somewhat more than ten._ And when he had passed over it, he an=
d those who=20

believed with him, they (_that is, those who had drunk_ [plentifully]) said=
, We have no power to-

day _to contend_ against Goliath and his troops. _And they were cowardly, a=
nd passed not over=20

it._ They [however] who held it as certain that they should meet God _at th=
e resurrection_ (_and=20

they were those who had passed over it_) said, How many a small body of men=
 hath overcome a=20

great body by the permission (_or will_) of God! And God is with the patien=
t, _to defend and aid_.--

And when they went forth to battle against Goliath and his troops, they sai=
d, O our Lord, pour upon=20

us patience, and make firm our feet, _by strengthening our hearts for the h=
oly war_, and help us=20

against the unbelieving people!--And they routed them by the permission (_o=
r will_) of God, and=20

David [Dawood, vulg. Daood], _who was in the army of Saul_, slew Goliath. A=
nd God gave him=20

(_David_) the kingship _over the children of Israel_, and wisdom (_that is =
prophecy_), _after the=20

death of Samuel and Saul, and they_ [namely these two gifts] _had not been =
given together to any=20

one before him_; and He taught him what He pleased,[310] _as the art of mak=
ing coats of mail,=20

and the language of birds_. And were it not for God's repelling men, one by=
 another, surely the=20

earth had become corrupt _by the predominance of the polytheists and the sl=
aughter of the=20

Muslims and the ruin of the places of worship_: but God is beneficent to th=
e peoples, _and hath=20

repelled some by others_.     (ii. 247-252.)   Hath the story of the two op=
posing parties come unto=20

thee, _O Mohammad_, when they ascended over the walls of the oratory of _Da=
vid, having been=20

prevented going in unto him by the door, because of his being engaged in de=
votion?_ When they=20

went in unto David, and he was frightened at them, they said, Fear not: _we=
 are_ two opposing=20

parties. _It is said that they were two parties of more than one each; and =
it is said that they were=20

two individuals, angels, who came as two litigants, to admonish David, who =
had ninety-nine wives,=20

and had desired the wife of a person who had none but her, and married her =
and taken her as his=20

wife._[311] [One of them said,] One of us hath wronged the other; therefore=
 judge between us with=20

truth, and be not unjust, but direct us into the right way. Verily this my =
brother _in religion_ had=20

nine-and-ninety ewes, and I had one ewe; and he said, Make me her keeper. A=
nd he overcame=20

me in the dispute.--_And the other confessed him to have spoken truth._--[D=
avid] said, Verily he=20

hath wronged thee in demanding thy ewe _to add her_ to his ewes; and verily=
 many associates=20

wrong one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds: and few=
 indeed are they.--

_And the two angels said, ascending in their_ [proper or assumed] _forms to=
 heaven, The man=20

hath passed sentence against himself. So David was admonished._ And David p=
erceived that We=20

had tried him _by his love of that woman_; wherefore he asked pardon of his=
 Lord, and fell down=20

bowing himself (_or prostrating himself_), and repented. So We forgave him =
that; and verily for=20

him [was ordained] a high rank with Us (_that is, an increase of good fortu=
ne in this world_), and=20

[there shall be for him] an excellent retreat _in the world to come_.     (=
xxxviii. 20-24.)   We=20

compelled the mountains to glorify Us, with David, and the birds _also, on =
his commanding them=20



to do so, when he experienced languor_; and We did _this_. And We taught hi=
m the art of making=20

coats of mail (_for before his time plates of metal were used_) for you _am=
ong mankind in=20

general_, that they might defend you from your suffering _in warring with y=
our enemies_.--Will ye=20

then, _O people of Mekkeh_, be thankful _for My favours, believing the apos=
tles_?--And _We=20

subjected_ unto Solomon [Suleyman] the wind, blowing strongly, _and being l=
ight at his desire_,=20

which ran at his command[312] to the land that We blessed (_namely Syria_);=
[313] and We knew=20

all things (_knowing that what We gave him would stimulate him to be submis=
sive to his Lord_).=20

And _We subjected_, of the devils, those who should dive for him _in the se=
a and bring forth from=20

it jewels for him_, and do other work besides that; _that is, building, and=
 performing other=20

services_; and We watched over them, _that they might not spoil what they e=
xecuted; for they=20

used, when they had finished a work before night, to spoil it, if they were=
 not employed in=20

something else_.     (xxi. 79-82.)   We gave unto David Solomon _his son_. =
How excellent a=20

servant _was he_! For he was one who earnestly turned himself unto God, _gl=
orifying and praising=20

Him at all times_. [Remember] when, in the latter part of the day, _after t=
he commencement of the=20

declining of the sun_, the _mares_ standing on three feet and touching the =
ground with the edge=20

of the fourth foot, swift in the course, were displayed before him. _They w=
ere a thousand mares,=20

which were displayed before him after he had performed the noon-prayers, on=
 the occasion of his=20

desiring to make use of them in a holy war; and when nine hundred of them h=
ad been displayed,=20

the sun set, and he had not performed the afternoon-prayers. So he was grie=
ved_, and he in the=20

statement in the Song of Songs: "I am black, but comely." The most remarkab=
le thing about her=20

was her learning. Even when Abelard first met her, she was "most distinguis=
hed for the extent of=20

her learning,"... "in great renown throughout the kingdom" for her proficie=
ncy. Her knowledge=20

included not only Latin, but Greek and even Hebrew, both rarely understood =
even among men in a=20

day when men usually got all and women none of the education that could be =
had. Her monastery=20

at the Paraclete became a school as famous in its way as Abelard had made P=
aris.  Of another=20

trait in her character, too, we can speak with certainty. Together with her=
 learning went firmness of=20

judgment and perfect sanity, the elements which go to make up what we vague=
ly call character.=20

We have seen Abelard expressing his confidence in her wisdom and judgment. =
Saint Bernard, the=20

bitter enemy of Abelard, could not withhold his admiration from her, althou=
gh she herself, a faithful=20

partisan of her husband, always spoke of Saint Bernard as "the false Apostl=
e." The latter, as was=20

natural in a man renowned for intellect and for asceticism, was more struck=
 by the grandeur of her=20

character than moved by her personal charms, and he wrote a letter to the P=
ope, commending her=20

as a prioress, in a tone of lofty esteem rather than sympathy. Her own cond=
uct, we have=20

remarked, was above reproach, and her convent was so well governed that its=
 rule became the=20

standard for all the convents of her day. Whatever may have been the violen=
ce of her grief over=20

the separation from Abelard, she was too proud to expose her feelings to th=
e world. She lived on=20

bravely, honorably, respected by high and low, yet making no secret of the =
fact that she had loved=20

and still did love Abelard. One does not wonder that she won the popular fa=
me which has kept her=20

name alive, and which has fixed the epithet applied by Villon some three ce=
nturies later: _La tres-

sage Heloise_. In all the happy phrases of the _Ballade des Belles Dames du=
 Temps Jadis_ there=20

is no juster epithet.  In striking contrast to the brutal selfishness of Ab=
elard is the noble=20

disinterestedness and complete effacement of self seen in the conduct of He=
loise. Realizing that=20



with him success in his vocation is everything and love but an episode, she=
 is content. More than=20

this, she does everything in her power to make him sacrifice her for the sa=
ke of the career which=20

she knows he is bent upon. She flatters him, feeds his vanity, already over=
great, and consistently=20

keeps out of view her own woman's feelings. When Abelard, with what he cons=
iders unusual and=20

exemplary generosity, offers to marry her--one can fancy that he was not ve=
ry urgent--this is part=20

of the argument she uses to dissuade him: "She asked," says Abelard, "what =
atonement would not=20

the world have a right to require of her should she deprive it of such a li=
ght? What curses she=20

would call upon her head! What a loss this marriage would be to the Church!=
 What tears it would=20

cost philosophy! Would it not be an unseemly and deplorable thing to see a =
man whom nature had=20

created for the whole world made the slave of one woman?... The marriage wo=
uld be a shame and=20

a burden to me... What agreement could there be between the labor of the sc=
hool and the cares of=20

a house, between the desk and the cradle?... Is there a man who, devoted to=
 the meditations of=20

philosophy or to the study of the Scriptures, could endure the cries of a c=
hild, the singing of the=20

nurse as she put it to sleep, the continual coming and going of the servant=
s, the incessant worries=20

of young children?"  That Abelard has reported her arguments with accuracy =
we need not doubt=20

when we come upon this remarkable and often quoted passage in her first let=
ter: "I never=20

thought... of my own wishes; it was always yours, you know yourself, that m=
y heart was bent upon=20

satisfying. Although the name of wife seems both more sacred and more endur=
ing, I should have=20

preferred that of mistress, or even concubine... thinking that, the more hu=
mble I made myself for=20

your sake, the more right I should have to your favor, and the less stain I=
 should put upon the=20

brilliancy of your glory."  When their misfortunes came upon them and Abela=
rd wanted her to enter=20

the cloister she obeyed without complaint; but the truth comes out at the c=
lose of her first letter:=20

"When you entered the service of God, I followed, nay, I preceded you... Yo=
u made me first take=20

the veil and the vows, you chained me to God before yourself. This mistrust=
, the only lack of=20

confidence in me you ever showed, filled me with grief and shame, me, who w=
ould, God knows,=20

have followed you or have gone before you unhesitatingly into the very flam=
es of hell! For my=20

heart was no longer with me but with you." In this letter are the only thin=
gs that even look like=20

reproaches on her part; she complains of his not writing to her, of his gru=
dging her even the poor=20

consolation of a letter, when she had done all for him: "Only tell me, if y=
ou can, why, since the=20

retirement from the world which you yourself enjoined upon me, you have neg=
lected me. Tell me, I=20

say, or I will say what I think, and what is on everybody's lips. Ah! it wa=
s lust rather than love which=20

attracted you to me... and that is why, your desire once satisfied, all dem=
onstrations of affection=20

ceased with the desire which inspired them." She implores him, therefore, t=
o write and silence=20

these disquieting voices in her heart.  There was no hypocrisy in Heloise; =
she never was resigned=20

to her seclusion in the convent, and never pretended to be. She wrote to Ab=
elard that she was=20

continuing to live in the convent only to obey him, "for it was not love of=
 God, but your wish, your=20

wish alone which cast my youth into the midst of monastic austerities." Fro=
m the very monastery=20

of which she was prioress she writes her burning letters. The first is supe=
rscribed: _Domino suo,=20

imo patri, conjugi suo, imo fratri; ancilla sua, imo filia; ipsius uxor, im=
o soror; Abelardo Heloissa_:=20

"To her lord, nay, to her father; to her husband, nay, to her brother; his =
servant, nay, his daughter;=20

his wife, nay, his sister; to Abelard, Heloise." She seems to lack words to=
 voice the passionate=20

devotion of her heart, and comes at the last to the best and simplest, a ve=
ritable cry of the heart it=20



is To Abelard, Heloise. Even in the letters subsequent to Abelard's patient=
 endeavor to allay the=20

transports of devotion to a mere man in one who had vowed her life to Chris=
t, she does not=20

restrain her feelings entirely. She superscribes them: "To him who is all f=
or her after Christ, she=20

who is all for him in Christ," and finally, "To her sovereign master, his d=
evoted slave." It is true that=20

the passion is more under control, but it is there nevertheless; for in one=
 of these letters she ever=20

and anon addresses Abelard as "my greatest blessing," and deliberately says=
: "Under all=20

circumstances, God knows, I have feared offending you more than I have fear=
ed offending Him;=20

and it is you far more than God whom I wish to please; it was a word from y=
ou, no divine call, that=20

made me take the veil." And she says, in reply to Abelard's request to be b=
uried in the cemetery of=20

the Paraclete: "I shall be more intent on following you without delay than =
upon providing for your=20

burial."  Bigotry or narrow piety, which are so much alike as to be scarcel=
y distinguishable, might=20

find fault with the uncompromising frankness of Heloise in confessing the p=
ersistence of love after=20

she is a nun. She admits that she loved Abelard passionately; moreover: "If=
 I must indeed lay bare=20

all the weakness of my miserable heart, I do not find in my heart contritio=
n or penitence sufficient=20

to appease God. I cannot withhold myself from complaining of His pitiless c=
ruelty in regard to the=20

outrage inflicted on you, and I only offend Him by rebellious murmurings ag=
ainst His decrees,=20

instead of seeking to allay His wrath by repentance. Can it be said, in fac=
t, that one is truly=20

penitent, whatever be the bodily penances submitted to, when the soul still=
 harbors the thought of=20

sin and burns with the same passions as of old?" She cannot bring herself t=
o regret or even to=20

forget and to cease to long for the pleasures of their love. "They praise m=
e for purity of life; it is=20

only because they do not know of my hypocrisy. The purity of the flesh is s=
et down to the credit of=20

virtue; but true virtue is of the soul, not of the body." These confessions=
, it strikes us, are proof of=20

the purity and loftiness of her ideals; she will not accept credit for virt=
ues that are only skin deep;=20

she honors the robe she wears too much to soil it by any sort of indulgence=
 that might give=20

occasion for scandal or for irreverent scoffing. But she bravely owns: "I d=
o not seek the crown of=20

victory (over my evil thoughts), it is enough for me to avoid the danger." =
 In a person so honest=20

with herself we are not surprised to find a charity for the weaknesses of o=
thers and a catholicity of=20

view in regard to things moral and religious quite in advance of the rather=
 cramped asceticism=20

distinctive, for example, of Saint Bernard, whom we take as a typical repre=
sentative of the religious=20

feeling of the age. In the last of her letters, she shows her learning, it =
must be admitted, with a little=20

too much pedantry; but that was in accord with the habit of the day. She ov=
erloads her letter with=20

useless erudition in the way of appeals to this and that holy man or this a=
nd that text of Scripture=20

to support a point which the reader would accept as axiomatic. But behind t=
his there is good sense=20

and kindness. She asks Abelard to determine, in the rule he is to make for =
her convent, all sorts of=20

practical points. Can women, being physically weaker, fast as rigidly as me=
n? Yet meat is not so=20

necessary for women; is it really a deprivation, then, to make them abstain=
 from meat? Women=20

are not so prone to intemperance as men, and at times they really need some=
 stimulant; how shall=20

we determine in regard to wines? We should avoid, of course, male visitors;=
 but do not vain,=20

gossiping, worldly women corrupt their own sex just as much as men would? A=
bove all, she says,=20

nuns must learn to eschew Pharisaism, the better-than-thou frame of mind. "=
The blessings=20

promised us by Christ were not promised to those alone who were priests; wo=
e unto the world,=20

indeed, if all that deserved the name of virtue were shut up in a cloister.=
"  The close of this last=20



letter is in a tone of religious exaltation which but poorly conceals the m=
ore human sentiments of=20

the noble Abbess Heloise: "It is for thee, O my master, it is for thee, as =
long as thou livest, to=20

institute the rule which we are to follow evermore. For, after God, thou wa=
st the founder of our=20

community; it is for thee, then, with God's assistance, to legislate for ou=
r order."  The two letters in=20

which Abelard answers this request are more coldly formal, less personal, t=
han any of the others.=20

At the end, for example, instead of some tender reminiscence, some hint tha=
t it was at the bidding=20

of love that he had poured forth his erudition on the subject of the monast=
ic life, we find merely an=20

exhortation such as might be addressed by any father confessor to one seeki=
ng his direction:=20

"Imitate, in the love of study and of good books, those blessed disciples o=
f Saint Jerome, Paula=20

and Eustochia, at whose request this great doctor wrote so many works that =
are a guiding light to=20

the church."  What were the rules by which Heloise and her nuns were to liv=
e? In essence not=20

fundamentally different from those in use in regular monasteries of the Ben=
edictine rule, they are=20

yet of sufficient interest to warrant us in giving a brief account, a mere =
abstract, of the very lengthy=20

and verbose commentary on monasticism which Heloise received from Abelard. =
We cannot doubt=20

that a person of her intelligence and strength of character followed the sp=
irit, not the letter, of the=20

law, and made her nuns live as she lived, beyond the utmost reach of evil r=
eport.  The three=20

cardinal virtues in the view of monasticism are Chastity, Poverty, Silence.=
 These the nuns must=20

observe most strictly, and such observance involves the renunciation of all=
 family ties, of all=20

worldly affections and desires. As there is less of temptation to worldline=
ss in the solitary places of=20

the earth, the convent should be remote. The absurd extent to which the cul=
t of mere chastity was=20

exalted in the mediaeval mind has been commented on by many a writer; but o=
ne little incident or=20

illustration from the book by which Heloise was to govern herself and her c=
ommunity may be=20

forgiven us. Abelard quotes from a letter of Saint Jerome. In the life of S=
aint Martin, written by=20

Sulpicius, we read that the saint wished to pay his respects to a virgin re=
nowned for her exemplary=20

conduct and her chastity, who, it seems, had spent all her life since girlh=
ood shut up in a small cell.=20

She refused to allow Saint Martin to come into her dwelling, but, looking o=
ut of the crevice which=20

served for a window, she said: "Father, pray where you are, for I have neve=
r received a visit from=20

any man." Saint Martin "gave thanks to God that, thanks to such a mode of l=
ife, she had preserved=20

her chastity." The humor, the irony, of such a remark appeals to us; but it=
 never occurred to Saint=20

Martin, to Saint Jerome, to Abelard, or to Heloise, that she who had contin=
ued chaste merely=20

because she had bottled herself up in a living tomb did not merit praise fo=
r any extraordinary=20

virtue: one might as well praise Robinson Crusoe on his island for not indu=
lging in the dissipations=20

of society.  To continue the rules for the Paraclete, which was certainly s=
ituated in a place remote=20

enough to protect its inmates from worldly intrusions, we may add that the =
rule advises that the=20

grounds or inclosure of the convent should contain "all that is needful for=
 the life of the convent,=20

that is to say, a garden, water, a mill, a bolting house and a bakery oven,=
" in short, everything that=20

can be thought of, in order to obviate the necessity of communication with =
the outside world.=20

Heloise's monastery, we may be assured, did not want for a diligent abbess,=
 who was to be=20

assisted by six subordinates: "For the entire administration of the convent=
 we believe that there=20

ought to be seven mistresses, so many and no more: the porteress, the cella=
ress, the vesturess=20

(_robaria_), the infirmaress, the precentress (_cantaria_), the sacristan, =
and finally a deaconess,=20

called now an abbess.... In this camp of Heaven's militia... the deaconess =
takes the place of the=20



general-in-chief, to whom all are in all things obedient." The six other si=
sters called officers, who=20

command under her, rank as colonels or captains. The rest of the nuns belon=
ging regularly to the=20

order are the soldiers of the Lord, while the lay sisters, who were employe=
d in menial offices and=20

were not initiated into the order, but merely took vows renouncing the worl=
d, were to be the foot=20

soldiers.  Heloise would accord quite well with the requirements for an abb=
ess or deaconess. Such=20

a one must have learning sufficient to read and to comprehend the Scripture=
s and the rules of her=20

order. She must be dignified, able to command respect and obedience. "Only =
as a last resort and=20

for pressing reasons should women of high rank or of great fortune be chose=
n as abbesses." Full=20

of the importance of their titles, they are ordinarily vain, presumptuous, =
proud. Being the guardian=20

of the whole community, the abbess should keep a close watch over her own c=
onduct, lest she=20

corrupt by evil example. Above all, the abbess is forbidden to "live in gre=
ater comfort, greater=20

ease, than any of her nuns. She shall not have any private apartments for d=
ining or sleeping; she=20

shall share all with her flock, whose needs she will comprehend so much the=
 better." When guests=20

are to be entertained at table the abbess is not to make this an excuse for=
 providing delicacies on=20

which she herself may feast, the guest is to sit at the table with the othe=
r nuns, though a special=20

dish may be provided for her, and the abbess herself is to wait on her, and=
 afterward to eat with=20

the servants. According to a maxim of Saint Anthony, as fish that are kept =
long out of water die,=20

even so monks who live long out of their cells in communication with worldl=
y folk break their vow of=20

seclusion. We may recall that Chaucer's jolly monk held this same text "not=
 worth an oyster"; but=20

the abbess of the Paraclete is specially enjoined "never to leave the conve=
nt to attend to outside=20

business." This reminds us that it was provided that the Paraclete should h=
ave a certain number of=20

monks attached to it. Convents, indeed, were rarely if ever independent of =
masculine supervision,=20

if not control, and in this case it is specially provided that the convent =
"shall be subject always to a=20

monastery, in such sort that one abbot may preside, and... that there be bu=
t one fold and one=20

shepherd." The relations, however, are decidedly to the advantage of the nu=
ns; their subjection is=20

only nominal, and every provision is made, in the letter of the law, that t=
he monks shall attend=20

merely to things outside of the convent and shall not meddle with its admin=
istration: "If we wish=20

that the abbot... should have control over the nuns, it is only in such sor=
t that he shall recognize as=20

his superiors the spouses of Christ, whose servant only he is, and that he =
shall find pleasure in=20

serving, not in commanding them. He should be like the intendant of a royal=
 household, who does=20

not venture to make his mistress feel his power.... He or his representativ=
es shall never be at=20

liberty to speak to the virgins of the Lord in the absence of their abbess.=
... He shall decide nothing=20

concerning them or their affairs until he has taken counsel with her; and h=
e shall transmit his=20

instructions or orders only through her.... All that concerns costume, food=
, even money, if there be=20

any, shall be gathered together and put in the custody of the nuns; out of =
their superfluity they=20

shall provide what is needful for the monks. The monks, therefore, shall ta=
ke charge of all outside=20

affairs, and the nuns of all those things which it becomes women to attend =
to in the house, to wit,=20

to sew the frocks of the monks, to wash them, to knead the bread, to put it=
 in the oven and bake it.=20

They shall have charge of the dairy and its dependencies; they shall feed t=
he hens and geese; in=20

short, they shall do all that women can do better than men.... Men and wome=
n both shall vow=20

obedience to the abbess."  Though not so radical in some respects as the co=
nstitution which=20

Robert D'Arbrissel imposed upon his monastery of Fontevrault, where women w=
ere exalted above=20



men in all respects, the provisions cited above seem sufficient to insure t=
he independence of the=20

nuns. There are, of course, careful rules to safeguard the virtue of both m=
onks and nuns in the=20

close relations necessitated by the conventual scheme; but as these are not=
 different from what=20

ordinary prudence would suggest--and ordinary craft circumvent--we need not=
 pause to give them.=20

The deaconess or abbess was not absolute; she must take counsel with her su=
bordinates, and for=20

some things she must convene the whole convent to ask advice and consent. H=
er subordinates=20

had duties and responsibilities of no mean sort. The sacristan, who is also=
 treasurer, shall have=20

charge of the chapel and its ornaments, their repairs, etc. She must care f=
or the things needful for=20

the services of the church, such as the incense, the relics, the bells, and=
 the communion wafers,=20

which latter the nuns are to make of pure wheat flour. The sacristan, too, =
having to decorate the=20

church in keeping with the seasons of the religious year, must be enough of=
 a scholar to know how=20

to compute and determine the feast days according to the calendar.  With th=
e precentress, or=20

mistress of the choir, rested the responsibility for the church music. She =
was to train the choir, and=20

to teach music, in which she must be well versed. Besides this, she was the=
 librarian, must give=20

out and take in the books, and take care of books and illuminations. In cas=
e of the illness or other=20

incapacity of the abbess, the precentress took her place.  One of the most =
trying places must have=20

been that of infirmaress, who not only had charge of the sick in the capaci=
ty of nurse, but "must=20

keep herself supplied with proper medicines, according to the resources of =
the place, and this she=20

can do the better if she knows a little of medicine.... She must know how t=
o let blood (the medicine=20

of the period relied very largely upon phlebotomy), so that this operation =
may not require the=20

access of any man among the nuns." Much of the simpler knowledge and practi=
ce of medicine=20

was permitted to women; the simpler medicine, indeed, was the only hope of =
the unfortunate sick=20

in the days of drastic doctoring.  The nun called the _robaria_, who had ch=
arge of the wardrobe,=20

we have christened "vesturess," for lack of a better name. She provided and=
 cared for the clothing=20

of both monks and nuns, not so simple a matter as it might seem, for "she s=
hall have the sheep=20

sheared, and shall receive the leather (for shoes, etc.); she shall collect=
 and take care of the wool=20

and linen and see to the making of the cloth from them; she shall distribut=
e thread, needles, and=20

scissors (to the nuns assigned to work under her). She shall have charge of=
 the dormitory and of=20

the beds; and she shall be charged with directing the cutting, sewing, and =
washing of the table-

cloths, napkins, and all the linen of the monastery.... She shall have all =
the necessary implements=20

for her work, and shall regulate the tasks assigned to each sister. She sha=
ll have charge of the=20

novices until they are admitted to the community." The novices, by the way,=
 were regularly taught=20

in the convent, and a good deal of the work for which religious exercises l=
eft the nuns little time=20

was assigned to them.  The clothes worn by the nuns of=20


_
preferred the love of [earthly] goods above the remembrance of my Lord, (_t=
hat is, the=20

performance of the afternoon-prayers_,) so that _the sun_ is concealed by t=
he veil. Bring them=20

(_namely the horses_) back unto me. _Therefore they brought them back._ And=
 he began to sever=20

_with his sword_ the legs and the necks, _slaughtering them, and_ [then] _c=
utting off their legs, as=20

a sacrifice unto God, and gave their flesh in alms; and God gave him in com=
pensation what was=20

better than they were and swifter, namely the wind, which travelled by his =
command whithersoever=20

he desired._--And We tried Solomon _by depriving him of his kingdom. This w=
as because he=20

married a woman of whom he became enamoured, and she used to worship an ido=
l in his palace=20

without his knowledge. His dominion was in his signet; and he pulled it off=
 once and deposited it=20

with his wife, who was named El-Emeeneh; and a jinnee came unto her in the =
form of Solomon,=20

and took it from her._ And We placed upon his throne a [counterfeit] body; =
_namely that jinnee,=20

who was Sakhr, or another. He sat upon the throne of Solomon, and the birds=
 and other creatures=20

surrounded him; and Solomon went forth, with a changed appearance, and saw =
him upon his=20

throne, and said unto the people, I am Solomon:--but they denied him._ Then=
 he returned _unto=20

his kingdom, after some days, having obtained the signet and put it on, and=
 seated himself upon=20

his throne._[314] He said, O my Lord, forgive me, and give me a dominion th=
at may not be to any=20

one after me (_or beside me_); for Thou art the Liberal Giver. So We subjec=
ted unto him the wind,=20

which ran gently at his command whithersoever he desired; and the devils [a=
lso], every builder _of=20

wonderful structures_, and diver _that brought up pearls from the sea_, and=
 others bound in=20

chains _which connected their hands to their necks. And We said unto him_, =
This is Our gift, and=20

bestow thou _thereof upon whomsoever thou wilt_, or refrain _from bestowing=
_, without=20

_rendering_ an account. And verily for him [was ordained] a high rank with =
Us, and an excellent=20

retreat.     (xxxviii. 29-39.)   We bestowed on David and Solomon knowledge=
 _in judging men and=20

in the language of the birds and other matters_; and they said, Praise be t=
o God who hath made=20

us to excel many of His believing servants, _by the gift of prophecy and by=
 the subjection of the=20

jinn and mankind and the devils_. And Solomon inherited from David _the gif=
t of prophecy and=20

knowledge_; and he said, O men, we have been taught the language of the bir=
ds,[315] and have=20

had bestowed on us of everything _wherewith prophets and kings are gifted_.=
 Verily this is=20

manifest excellence.--And his armies of jinn and men and birds were gathere=
d together unto=20

Solomon, and they were led on in order, until, when they came unto the vall=
ey of ants, (_which_=20

[was] _at Et-Taif or in Syria, the ants whereof_ [were] _small or great_,) =
an ant (_the queen of the=20

ants_), _having seen the troops of Solomon_, said, O ants, enter your habit=
ations, lest Solomon=20

and his troops crush you violently, while they perceive not. And _Solomon_ =
smiled, _afterwards_=20

laughing at her saying, _which he heard from the distance of three miles, t=
he wind conveying it to=20

him: so he withheld his forces when he came in sight of their valley, until=
 the ants had entered their=20

dwellings: and his troops were on horses and on foot in this expedition_. A=
nd he said, O my Lord,=20

inspire me to be thankful for Thy favour which Thou hast bestowed upon me a=
nd upon my parents,=20

and to do righteousness which Thou shalt approve, and admit me, in Thy merc=
y, among Thy=20

servants, the righteous, _the prophets and the saints_.  And he examined th=
e birds,[316] _that he=20

might see the lapwing, that saw the water beneath the earth, and directed t=
o it by pecking the=20

earth, whereupon the devils used to draw it forth when Solomon wanted it_ [=
to perform the=20

ablution] _for prayer; but he saw it not_: and he said, Wherefore do I not =
see the lapwing? Is it=20



[one] of the absent?--_And when he was certain of the case he said_, I will=
 assuredly punish it with=20

a severe punishment, _by plucking out its feathers and its tail and casting=
 it in the sun so that it=20

shall not be able to guard against excessive thirst_; or I will slaughter i=
t; or it shall bring me a=20

manifest convincing proof _showing its excuse_.--And it tarried not long _b=
efore it presented itself=20

unto Solomon submissively, and raised its head and relaxed its tail and its=
 wings: so he forgave it;=20

and he asked it what it had met with during its absence_; and it said, I ha=
ve become acquainted=20

with that wherewith thou hast not become acquainted, and I have come unto t=
hee from Seba (_a=20

tribe of El-Yemen_) with a sure piece of news. I found a woman reigning ove=
r them, _named=20

Bilkees_, and she hath been gifted with everything _that princes require_, =
and hath a magnificent=20

throne. _(Its length was eighty cubits; and its breadth, forty cubits; and =
its height, thirty cubits: it=20

was composed of gold and silver set with fine pearls and with rubies and ch=
rysolites, and its legs=20

were of rubies and chrysolites and emeralds: upon it_ [were closed] _seven =
doors: to each=20

chamber_ [through which one passed to it was] _a closed door_.) I found her=
 and her people=20

worshipping the sun instead of God, and the devil hath made their works to =
seem comely unto=20

them, so that he hath hindered them from the _right_ way, wherefore they ar=
e not rightly directed=20

to the worship of God, who produceth what is hidden (_namely the rain and v=
egetables_) in the=20

heavens and the earth, and knoweth what they [that is, mankind and others] =
conceal _in their=20

hearts_, and what they reveal _with their tongues_. God: there is no deity =
but He, the Lord of the=20

magnificent throne, _between which and the throne of Bilkees is a vast diff=
erence_.  _Solomon_=20

said _to the lapwing_, We will see whether thou hast spoken truth or whethe=
r thou art of the liars.=20

_Then the lapwing guided them to the water, and it was drawn forth_ [by the=
 devils]; _and they=20

quenched their thirst and performed the ablution and prayed. Then Solomon w=
rote a letter, the=20

form whereof was this:--From the servant of God, Solomon the son of David, =
to Bilkees the queen=20

of Seba. In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Peace be on w=
homsoever=20

followeth the right direction. After_ [this salutation, I say], _Act ye not=
 proudly towards me; but=20

come unto me submitting.--He then sealed it with musk, and stamped it with =
his signet, and said=20

unto the lapwing_, Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them (_nam=
ely Bilkees and her=20

people_): then turn away from them, _but stay near them_, and see what _rep=
ly_ they will return.=20

_So the lapwing took it, and came unto her, and around her were her forces;=
 and he threw it down=20

into her lap; and when she saw it, she trembled with fear. Then she conside=
red what was in it,=20

and_ she said _unto the nobles of her people_, O nobles, an honourable (_se=
aled_) letter hath=20

been thrown down unto me. It is from Solomon; and it is _this_:--In the nam=
e of God, the=20

Compassionate, the Merciful. Act ye not proudly towards me: but come unto m=
e submitting.--She=20

said, O nobles, advise me in mine affair. I will not decide upon a thing un=
less ye bear me witness.-

-They replied, We are endowed with strength and endowed with great valour; =
but the command=20

[belongeth] to thee; therefore see what thou wilt command _us to do, and we=
 will obey thee_. She=20

said, Verily kings, when they enter a city, waste it, and render the mighty=
 of its inhabitants abject;=20

and thus will they do _who have sent the letter_. But I will send unto them=
 with a gift, and I will see=20

with what the messengers will return, _whether the gift will be accepted, o=
r whether it will be=20

rejected. If he be_ [merely] _a king, he will accept it; and if he be a pro=
phet, he will not accept it.--

And she sent male and female servants, a thousand in equal numbers_ [five h=
undred of each sex],=20

_and five hundred bricks of gold, and a crown set with jewels, and musk and=
 ambergris and other=20



things, by a messenger with a letter.[317] And the lapwing hastened unto So=
lomon, to tell him the=20

news; on hearing which, he commanded that bricks of gold and silver should =
be cast, and that a=20

horse-course should be extended to the length of nine leagues from the plac=
e where he was, and=20

that they should build around it a wall with battlements, of gold and silve=
r, and that the=20

handsomest of the beasts of the land and of the sea should be brought with =
the sons of the jinn on=20

the right side of the horse-course and on its left._  And when _the messeng=
er_ came _with the gift,=20

and with him his attendants_, unto Solomon, he [Solomon] said, Do ye aid me=
 with wealth? But=20

what God hath given me (_namely the gift of prophecy and the kingdom_) is b=
etter than what He=20

hath given you, _of worldly goods_; yet ye rejoice in your gift, _because y=
e glory in the showy=20

things of this world_. Return unto them _with the gift that thou hast broug=
ht_; for we will surely=20

come unto them with forces with which they have not power [to contend], and=
 we will surely drive=20

them out from it, (_that is, from their country, Seba, which was named afte=
r the father of their=20

tribe_,) abject and contemptible, _if they come not unto us submitting. And=
 when the messenger=20

returned unto her with the gift, she placed her throne within seven doors, =
within her palace, and=20

her palace was within seven palaces; and she closed the doors, and set guar=
ds to them, and=20

prepared to go unto Solomon, that she might see what he would command her t=
o do. She=20

departed with twelve thousand kings, each king having with him many thousan=
ds, and proceeded=20

until she came as near to him as a league's distance; when he knew of her_ =
[approach,] he said,=20

O nobles, which of you will bring unto me her throne before they come unto =
me submitting? An=20

'efreet, of the jinn, answered, I will bring it unto thee before thou shalt=
 arise from thy place=20

_wherein thou sittest to judge from morning until mid-day_; for I am able t=
o do it, [and] trustworthy=20

_with respect to the jewels that it compriseth and other matters. Solomon s=
aid, I desire it more=20

speedily._ [And thereupon] he simplest kind. "The clothes shall be of black=
 woollen stuff; no other=20

color, for that best accords with the mourning of penitence; and no fur is =
more fitting than the=20

fleece of lambs for the spouses of Christ...." And this black robe was not =
to extend lower than the=20

heel ("to avoid raising the dust"), or to have sleeves longer than the natu=
ral length to cover arm=20

and hand,--a provision which one can understand only after seeing pictures =
of the immense=20

sleeves in fashion. "The veils shall not be of silk, but of cloth or dyed s=
tuff. They shall wear=20

chemises of cloth next the skin, and these they shall not take off even to =
sleep. Considering the=20

delicacy of their constitutions, we will not forbid the use of mattresses a=
nd sheets.... For covering=20

(at night), we think a chemise, a robe and a lamb skin, adding over these, =
during the cold weather,=20

a mantle for covering to the bed, will suffice. Each bed must have a mattre=
ss, a bolster, a pillow, a=20

counterpane, and a sheet." In order to guard against vermin and dirt, all c=
lothing should be=20

provided for each nun in double sets. On their heads the nuns were to wear =
a white band with the=20

veil over it; when necessary, on account of the tonsure, a bonnet of lamb s=
kin might be worn.=20

When a nun died, she was dressed in clean but coarse garments, with sandals=
 on her feet, and=20

the garments sewn or fastened to the body, so that they might not be disarr=
anged in the presence=20

of the priests officiating at her funeral. As a special honor, the abbess c=
ould be buried in a garment=20

of haircloth, sewn around her like a sack.  The duties of the porteress wer=
e sufficiently simple,=20

consisting chiefly in guarding the gate and admitting only persons properly=
 accredited. But the=20

cellaress had duties manifold. She "shall have charge of all that concerns =
the feeding of the nuns:=20

cellar, refectory, kitchen, mill, bakery, bake ovens, gardens, orchards and=
 fields, beehives, flocks,=20



cattle of all kinds, and poultry." With keen insight into human nature, it =
is especially provided that=20

she shall not reserve any tidbits for herself at the table, with the admoni=
tion that this was precisely=20

what Judas did.  We have given but the merest sketch of the provisions by w=
hich Heloise was to=20

regulate her life. The rule determines points great and small; meat can be =
allowed three times a=20

week, except during Lent; wine may be used in moderation; services must be =
held at such and=20

such times, with work or sleep between; nuns must never go bare-footed, nor=
 gossip with visitors,=20

and so on. But one thing we must add, as illustrative of the manners of the=
 time: "There is one=20

thing more which must be not only forbidden but held in abhorrence, althoug=
h it is a custom in use=20

in most monasteries: that is that the nuns should wipe their hands or their=
 knives with the pieces of=20

bread remaining from dinner, which are the portion of the poor. To save tab=
le linen it is not right to=20

soil the bread of the poor."  In the way of actual facts little is really k=
nown of the life of Heloise. We=20

have sought to trace the fortunes of the man to whom she was so unselfishly=
 yet so passionately=20

attached and to reproduce from her own scanty writings as much as may be of=
 her character. We=20

must now conclude the story of Abelard. After his departure from Saint-Gild=
as his days were still=20

full of trouble. In 1136 we find him once more triumphing in his old field,=
 delivering his lectures to=20

crowds of students upon Mont Sainte-Genevieve. Not only did his teaching dr=
aw crowds, but his=20

book on theology was in every hand, and his doctrines spread beyond the Alp=
s. In the words of=20

one of his enemies, writing to Saint Bernard: _Libri ejus transeunt maria, =
transvolant Alpes_: "His=20

books are wafted across the seas, and fly over the Alps." Arnold of Brescia=
, a disciple of Abelard,=20

was preaching in Italy a more democratic religion and a more liberal form o=
f government, stirring=20

up the wrath of the Church as another Tribune of the People daring to incit=
e the Italian cities to=20

proclaim their freedom. The final conflict of Abelard's life was preparing.=
  At Clairvaux, in a valley=20

so dismal as to have won the name of the _Valley of Wormwood_, lived the ve=
ry incarnation of=20

asceticism, stern religious orthodoxy, and uncompromising conservatism--Sai=
nt Bernard. To him,=20

a restless, daring innovator like Abelard was abhorrent. To profess doctrin=
es that led to the view=20

that original sin was less a sin than a punishment, that the redemption of =
man was an act of pure=20

love, not one of necessity for our redemption, that God, in short, was a Go=
d of Love, not a God of=20

Wrath--what was all this but striking at the very root of that exquisite mo=
rtification of the flesh, the=20

prayers, the fasting, the actual corporeal torment inflicted upon himself b=
y Saint Bernard in the=20

hope of purchasing remission of his sin? His sin, we may remark, consisted =
merely in being=20

descended from Adam, for he had been pure in life from his youth up. Saint =
Bernard was looked=20

upon even in his own life as almost a saint; his influence was tremendous. =
He now began to stir up=20

the powers of the Church, from the Pope down, against Abelard. The latter, =
puffed up with pride at=20

his renewed success, or perhaps willing to risk all at one throw, did not w=
ait for the Church to=20

proceed against him: he challenged his enemies to prove his doctrines heret=
ical; he challenged=20

Bernard himself to meet him in debate before a council that was to meet at =
Sens in 1140. Fully=20

aware of his inferiority as a logician to this trained thinker, Saint Berna=
rd reluctantly consented to=20

take up the battle for orthodoxy. All was ready; Abelard appeared before th=
e council, realized that=20

his case was prejudged, and appealed to Rome. Nevertheless, Saint Bernard g=
ot the council to=20

pass judgment against Abelard and to sentence him to silence and to perpetu=
al reclusion in a=20

monastery, and Innocent II., the next year, confirmed the finding of the co=
uncil. Broken in spirit,=20

Abelard nevertheless set out for Rome to urge his plea in person, but at Cl=
uni he broke down in=20



health. Tenderly cared for by the good abbot, Peter the Venerable, who effe=
cted a sort of=20

reconciliation between Abelard and the triumphant Abbot of Clairvaux, Abela=
rd lingered but a few=20

months. To ease his dying days Peter the Venerable had him removed to the l=
ittle priory of Saint=20

Marcel, a dependency of Cluni, where he died, April 21, 1142.  In accordanc=
e with the wishes of=20

Heloise and of Abelard himself, Peter the Venerable sent his remains secret=
ly to the Paraclete,=20

writing to Heloise: "May the Lord keep him for you, to give him back to you=
 through His mercy."=20

There was a heart still in the breast of this old monk; we trust that his p=
rayer has been answered,=20

even as we trust that the absolution which he sent at Heloise's request has=
 washed away the sins=20

of her lover: "I, Peter, Abbot of Cluni, who received into the monastery of=
 Cluni Peter Abelard, and=20

granted that his body be borne secretly to the Abbess Heloise and the conve=
nt of the Paraclete, by=20

the authority of God Almighty and of all the saints, absolve him, by virtue=
 of my office, from all his=20

sins."  We hear nothing more of Heloise, except that she provided for her c=
hild, left with Abelard's=20

sister in Brittany; but we know that she lived her life not only bravely, b=
ut honorably. For twenty-

two years more she lived on at the convent over which her husband had estab=
lished her, and here=20

she died, on the 16th of May, 1164. Her body was buried beside that of her =
husband in the=20

cemetery of the Paraclete, and a touching legend relates that when, accordi=
ng to the order given=20

by herself, her body was deposited in the tomb of her husband, "Abelard str=
etched out his arms to=20

receive her and closed them in a last embrace." Through all the centuries l=
ove has guarded their=20

remains; though often shifted, their resting place is still known: in the f=
amous Cimetiere de L'Est,=20

Pere Lachaise, at Paris, the traveller still sees the tomb of Abelard and H=
eloise.  It is not her=20

learning that has made Heloise famous; it is the accident of her connection=
 with Abelard which has=20

served to keep her name alive. It is not because she was learned or because=
 she was loved by=20

Abelard that we admire her. Her greatness is a moral greatness rare in her =
time, and not due to=20

her intellect or to the tragic circumstances of her life. The remarkable th=
ing is that, overwhelmed in=20

the ruin of her lover, forced into a convent at twenty, where she obeys him=
 and imitates him, she=20

yet does not change in her heart, she does not suffer the mystic death of t=
he cloister; of her love=20

she never repents, though she does repent of her faults; to the law of mona=
stic asceticism her=20

conscience refuses to submit, let Abelard preach as he will, for she vaguel=
y feels that asceticism is=20

in violation of some higher law of life. The great love in her heart knew n=
o faltering; so much like=20

devotion was it that one feels that she meant no name but that of Abelard t=
o be associated with=20

the words of a dirge attributed to her:          "With thee I suffered the =
rigor of destiny;         With=20

thee shall I, weary, sleep;         With thee shall I enter Sion."     CHAP=
TER III  WOMEN IN EARLY=20

PROVENCAL AND FRENCH LITERATURE  GUILHELM--or William--X., Duke of Aquitain=
e,=20

remorseful because of the ravages committed in Normandy by himself and his =
allies in 1136,=20

started on an expiatory pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint-James of Composte=
lla. Before going he=20

willed to Louis the Fat, King of France, the guardianship of his daughter, =
"la tres noble demoiselle=20

Eleonore," sole heiress of his extensive dominions, including Poitou, March=
e, the Limousin,=20

Auvergne, Gascony, and Guienne. This Eleanor was to be the brilliant and pa=
ssionate Queen of=20

England, mother of Richard of the Lion Heart and of John Lackland. But we w=
ill not anticipate her=20

story, for sixteen years of her life precede the time when she became the q=
ueen of Henry II.  The=20

youthful heiress had been left as the feudal ward of King Louis, who lost n=
o time in securing her=20

domain for the crown of France. Duke Guilhelm died in the church of Compost=
ella April 9, 1137-



1138. Eleanor, now Duchess of Aquitaine, was=20


_
_revealed_ scripture (_namely_ [his Wezeer] _Asaf the son of Barkhiya, who =
was a just person,=20

acquainted with the most great name of God, which ensured an answer to him =
who invoked=20

thereby_[318]) said, I will bring it unto thee before thy glance can be wit=
hdrawn _from any object.=20

And he said unto him, Look at the sky. So he looked at it; then he withdrew=
 his glance, and found=20

it placed before him: for during his look towards the sky, Asaf prayed, by =
the most great name, that=20

God would bring it; and it so happened, the throne passing under the ground=
 until it came up=20

before the throne of Solomon._ And when he saw it firmly placed before him,=
 he said, This is of=20

the favour of my Lord, that He may try me, whether I shall be thankful or w=
hether I shall be=20

unthankful. And he who is thankful is thankful for _the sake of_ his own so=
ul, _which will have the=20

reward of his thankfulness_; and [as to] him who is ungrateful, my Lord is =
independent [and]=20

bountiful.  [Then Solomon] said, Alter ye her throne so that it may not be =
known by her, that we=20

may see whether she be rightly directed _to the knowledge thereof_, or whet=
her she be of those=20

who are not rightly directed _to the knowledge of that which is altered. He=
 desired thereby to try=20

her intelligence. So they altered it, by adding to it, or taking from it, o=
r in some other manner._ And=20

when she came, it was said _unto her_, Is thy throne like this? She answere=
d, As though it were=20

the same. (_She answered them ambiguously like as they had questioned her a=
mbiguously, not=20

saying, Is this thy throne?--and had they so said, she had answered, Yes._)=
 _And when Solomon=20

saw her knowledge, he said_, And we have had knowledge bestowed on us befor=
e her, and have=20

been Muslims. But what she worshipped instead of God hindered her _from wor=
shipping Him_; for=20

she was of an unbelieving people.--It was said unto her _also_, Enter the p=
alace. _It had a floor of=20

white, transparent glass, beneath which was running water, wherein were fis=
h. Solomon had made=20

it on its being said unto him that her legs and feet were_ [hairy] _like th=
e legs of an ass._ And=20

when she saw it, she imagined it to be a great water, and she uncovered her=
 legs, _that she might=20

wade through it; and Solomon was on his throne at the upper end of the pala=
ce, and he saw that=20

her legs and her feet were handsome_. He said _unto her_, Verily it is a pa=
lace evenly spread with=20

glass. _And he invited her to embrace El-Islam_, [whereupon] she said, O my=
 Lord, verily I have=20

acted unjustly towards mine own soul, _by worshipping another than Thee_, a=
nd I resign myself,=20

with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of the worlds. _And he desired to marry he=
r; but he disliked the=20

hair upon her legs; so the devils made for him the depilatory of quick-lime=
, wherewith she removed=20

the hair, and he married her; and he loved her, and confirmed her in her ki=
ngdom. He used to visit=20

her every month once, and to remain with her three days; and her reign expi=
red on the expiration=20

of the reign of Solomon. It is related that he began to reign when he was t=
hirteen years of age, and=20

died at the age of three and fifty years. Extolled be the perfection of Him=
 to the duration of whose=20

dominion there is no end!_     (xxvii. 15-45.)   _We subjected_ unto Solomo=
n the wind, which=20

travelled in the morning (_unto the period when the sun began to decline_) =
_the distance of_ a=20

month's _journey_, and in the evening _from the commencement of the declini=
ng of the sun into=20

its setting_ a month's _journey_. And We made the fountain of molten brass =
to flow for him _three=20

days with their nights_ [in every month], _as water floweth;[319] and the p=
eople worked until the=20

day_ [of its flowing], _with that which had been given into Solomon_. And o=
f the jinn [were] those=20

who worked in his presence, by the will of his Lord; and such of them as sw=
erved from _obedience=20

to_ Our command We will cause to taste of the punishment of hell _in the wo=
rld to come_ (_or, as=20

it is said by some, We cause to taste of its punishment in the present worl=
d, an angel beating them=20



with a scourge from hell, the stripe of which burneth them_). They made for=
 him whatever he=20

pleased, of lofty halls (_with steps whereby to ascend to them_), and image=
s (_for they were not=20

forbidden by his law_[320]), and large dishes, like great tanks for waterin=
g camels, _around each=20

of which assembled a thousand men, eating from it_, and cooking-pots standi=
ng firmly _on their=20

legs, cut out from the mountains in El-Yemen, and to which they ascended by=
 ladders_. _And We=20

said_, Work, O family of David, _in the service of God_, with thanksgiving =
_unto Him for what He=20

hath given you_:--but few of My servants are the thankful. And when We decr=
eed that he=20

(_namely, Solomon_) should die, _and he died, and remained standing, and le=
aning upon his staff=20

for a year, dead, the jinn meanwhile performing those difficult works as th=
ey were accustomed to=20

do, not knowing of his death, until the worm ate his staff, whereupon he fe=
ll down_, nothing=20

showed them his death but the eating reptile (_the worm_) that ate his staf=
f.[321] And when he fell=20

down, the jinn plainly perceived that if they had known things unseen (_of =
which things was the=20

death of Solomon_), they had not continued in the ignominious affliction (_=
that is, in their difficult=20

works_), _imagining that he was alive, inconsistently with their opinion th=
at they knew things=20

unseen. And that the period was a year was known by calculating what the wo=
rm had eaten of his=20

staff since his death in each day and night or other space of time._ (xxxiv=
. 11-13.)     _JONAH._=20

Verily Jonah [Yoonus] was one of the apostles. [Remember] when he fled unto=
 the laden ship,=20

_being angry with his people, because the punishment wherewith he had threa=
tened them did not=20

fall upon them; wherefore he embarked in the ship; and it became stationary=
 in the midst of the=20

sea: so the sailors said, Here is a slave who hath fled from his master, an=
d the lot will discover=20

him_:--and he cast lots _with those who were in the ship_, and he was [the]=
 one upon whom the=20

lot fell. _They therefore cast him into the sea_, and the fish swallowed hi=
m; and he was=20

reprehensible, _for having gone to the sea, and embarked in the ship, witho=
ut the permission of=20

his Lord_. And had he not been of those who glorified God (_by his saying o=
ften in the belly of the=20

fish, There is no god but Thou! I extol Thy perfection! Verily I have been =
of the offenders!_), he=20

had remained in his belly until the day of resurrection.[322] And We cast h=
im on the plain land,=20

_the same day, or after three or seven days, or twenty or forty days_; and =
he was sick; and We=20

caused a gourd plant[323] to grow up over him, _to shade him_. _It had a tr=
unk, contrary to what=20

is the case of gourds in general, being miraculously produced for him._[324=
] _And a wild she-goat=20

came to him evening and morning, of whose milk he drank until he became str=
ong._ And We sent=20

him _after that, as before_, unto _his people in Nineveh, in the land of El=
-Mosil_, a hundred=20

thousand, or they were a greater number by _twenty or thirty or seventy tho=
usand_; and they=20

believed _on beholding the punishment wherewith they had been threatened_;[=
325] wherefore We=20

allowed them enjoyment _of their goods_ for a time, _until the expiration o=
f their terms of life_.=20

(xxxvii. 139-148.)     _EZRA._   [Hast thou not considered] him who passed =
by a city (_which was=20

Jerusalem_), _riding upon an ass, and having with him a basket of figs and =
a vessel of the juice of=20

grapes_ (_and he was 'Ozeyr_ [Ezra]), and it was falling down upon its roof=
s, _Nebuchadnezzar=20

having ruined it_? He said, _wondering at the power of God_, How will God q=
uicken this after its=20

death?--And God caused him to die for a hundred years. Then He raised him t=
o life: [and] He said=20

_unto him_, How long hast thou tarried _here_?--He answered I have tarried =
a day, or part of a=20

day.--_For he slept in the first part of the day, and was deprived of his l=

sunset._ He said Nay, thou hast tarried a hundred years: but look at thy fo=
od and thy drink: they=20



have not become changed by time: and look at thine ass.--_And he beheld it =
dead, and its bones=20

white and shining.--We have done this that thou mayest know_, and that We m=
ay make thee a=20

sign _of the resurrection_ unto men. And look at the bones _of thine ass_, =
how We will raise them;=20

then We will clothe them with flesh.--_So he looked at them, and they had b=
ecome put together,=20

and were clothed with flesh, and life was breathed into it, and it brayed._=
 Therefore when it had=20

been made manifest to him he said, I know that God is able to accomplish ev=

_THE MESSIAH._   _Remember_ when the wife of 'Imran[326] said, (_when she h=
ad become=20

aged, and desired offspring, wherefore she supplicated God, and became sens=
ible of=20

pregnancy_,) O my Lord, verily I devote unto Thee what is in my womb, to be=
 dedicated _to the=20

service of Thy holy house_: then accept [it] from me; for Thou art the Hear=
er _of prayer_, the=20

Knower _of intentions_. _And 'Imran long to remain unmarried. Prince Louis =
of France,=20

accompanied by a gorgeous company of five hundred knights, under command of=
 the Count=20

Palatine, Thibaud de Champagne, came as her suitor,--a suitor whom she coul=
d not refuse. She=20

was married, and crowned as future Queen of France. On their way back from =
Bordeaux to Paris=20

the young couple met the news of the death of Louis the Fat. Eleanor was th=
us Queen of France=20

indeed, but there was more of the south, of Toulouse and Bordeaux and the t=
roubadours in her=20

nature than was quite good for one who was the wife of the correct, devout,=
 narrow-minded,=20

though not stupid or unkind Louis VII.  She came of a race notorious for re=
ckless love of pleasure,=20

for sparkling wit, for vehemence of temper and strong passions, for utter d=
isregard of the merely=20

decorous, the sober commonplace rules of either morals or society. We have =
seen some of the=20

pranks of her grandfather, William of Poitou. Her father was not less high-=
tempered, though less=20

brilliant than his troubadour predecessor. His fits of extravagance were fo=
llowed by fits of=20

penitence in whose sincerity one may place some faith, whereas the troubado=
ur was certainly=20

never sad for long, and apparently not much imbued with religious ardor, ev=
en if he did go to the=20

Holy Land as a pious crusader. Eleanor inherited her grandfather's temper a=
nd his love of=20

literature, music, fighting, and all that made life worth living, according=
 to the standards of her=20

native land. Let us look at this land of the troubadours, from which Eleano=
r came, and try to picture=20

the environment to which she was accustomed and which she abandoned to live=
 with the sober,=20

monkish, unlovely French king, whose court and whose city of Paris did not =
compare with the gay=20

capital of Bordeaux, where her father and her grandfather had gathered the =
most brilliant poets=20

and musicians of Provence.  While the northern and western portions of Fran=
ce, including even=20

that muddy _Lutetia Parisorum_ which has become the modern Paris, were for =
but a short time,=20

comparatively, under Roman rule, there was a portion of France, between the=
 Rhone and the=20

Swiss Alps, which was so distinctively and peculiarly a part of the great e=
mpire that it was called=20

_Provincia_, "the Province," or, as we know it, Provence. It was in this be=
autiful land, the French=20

Riviera, that the Roman legions established their first posts, long before =
there was a Roman=20

Empire. Here they found a civilization ready to their hands, for in the cen=
tre of their new Provincia=20

was the famous port of Massillia--Marseilles--established long before by Gr=
eeks and Phoenicians.=20

To the present day one finds at Aries, at Mimes, at Avignon, titanic ruins =
bearing witness to the=20

Roman civilization. It was a fertile country, glowing with rich fruits and =
flowers, and favored with a=20

climate which has made it famous since the days of Rome. While the north of=
 France was=20

hopelessly barbarized by Teutonic inroads and long years of barbaric warfar=
e, the civilization of=20



Provence was rather checked than destroyed. Marseilles was still a port, an=
d the commerce of the=20

east, of the Mediterranean, of Rome, came through Marseilles, not only for =
Gaul but for Britain.=20

The influence of this constant intercourse, no less than the large infusion=
 of Latin or Hellenic=20

blood, kept the people of Provence from relapsing into the primitive state =
of the people further to=20

the north. They were, moreover, a gay and pleasure-loving people by nature,=
 and probably always=20

less savage and rough than the Franks. We may remember that even at the beg=
inning of our story=20

the court of the pious King Robert, according to the monkish chronicles, wa=
s hopelessly corrupted=20

by the attendants of his Provencal bride, Constance, with their scandalousl=
y fashioned costumes=20

and their ungodly minstrelsy. The rich clothing, the minstrelsy, the more g=
racious manners, were=20

always characteristic of the southerners, from the very first moment we hea=
r of them until the end.=20

During the eleventh century, while the kingdom of France was just beginning=
 to gain something=20

like an ascendancy over the other provinces which were eventually to consti=
tute a real power=20

under one rule, the riches and the power of the Mediterranean district came=
 to full flower. We=20

speak of this whole territory as Provence, although in reality Provence pro=
per was but a small=20

portion of the whole. It would be, perhaps, better to confine one's self to=
 the old distinction=20

between north and south France, based on the difference in dialect. Dante, =
distinguishing between=20

three groups of the tongues derived from Latin, says: _Alii Oc, alii Oil, a=
lii Si, affirmando=20

loquuntur:_--"For the affirmative, some use Oc (Provencal) some use Oil (Fr=
ench), some use Si=20

(Italian)." The langue d'oc was the tongue used in that part of France sout=
h of a line drawn from=20

the south of the Garonne to the Alps, including not only Provence but Guien=
ne, Gascony,=20

Languedoc, Auvergne, etc. The people and the language, however, throughout =
this whole territory,=20

were generally named from that Provincia which, as we have said, was the mo=
st fertile and the=20

most favored. Thus, in ordinary speech, a citizen of Beziers, Toulouse, or =
even Bordeaux was as=20

much a Provencal as one from Aries or Aix.  Among the other influences to w=
hich Provence owed=20

part of its culture one must not forget that of Spain. At the time of which=
 we write a large part of the=20

richest lands in Spain was in the possession of a race more cultured, more =
intellectual, more=20

refined, despite their warlike nature, than any race with which western Eur=
ope had yet come in=20

contact. The story of the Saracen empire in Spain, its rise, its glorious s=
truggle, its almost fabulous=20

luxury, and its pathetic fall, is one of the most fascinating in history. A=
rab songs, Arab singers,=20

Arab instruments became known among the Spaniards, and even in the face of =
continual warfare=20

some little of infidel arts and sciences and refinements penetrated and sof=
tened the rougher-

mannered civilization of the Christians.  On Spain itself this Oriental inf=
luence was, of course,=20

strongest; but the relations between Spain and the south of France were at =
all times close, and the=20

relations between Provence and Spain were made still more intimate when, in=
 the early part of the=20

twelfth century, the crown of Provence passed to Raymond Berenger, Count of=
 Barcelona, who=20

had married Douce de Provence.  Under these influences the nobility of Prov=
ence developed a=20

culture perhaps purely artificial and exotic, but certainly far in advance =
of that prevailing in any=20

other part of France. With their civilization came, of course, a knowledge =
of the gentler arts and a=20

feeling for the beautiful. At a time when French literature consisted of a =
few fragments of=20

documents, chronicles, or dull legends of the saints, Provence had develope=
d a literature of most=20

astonishing richness and delicacy. The surprising thing about this literatu=
re of Provence is that it=20

has no beginnings, no childhood, but is almost as perfect in artistic finis=
h, in the careful handling of=20



most intricate rhymes and stanzas, when the first troubadour sings as it be=
came during the two=20

hundred years of its life. There were songs or poems in stanzas of varying =
structure and lines of=20

varying length, some really lyric, and some epic. The most distinctive form=
s of the lyric poetry were=20

probably the dirge or _planh_; the contention or _tenson_, a poem in which =
two or more persons=20

maintain an argument on questions of love, or chivalry, etc., each using st=
anzas terminating in=20

similar rhymes, somewhat like the style of poem long after known in Scottis=
h literature as a=20

"flyting;" and the satiric poem or pasquinade, the _sirvente_, often a fier=
ce war song in which the=20

poet lashed his foes and urged his men on to battle.  The social conditions=
 of France during this=20

period were such as to make caste distinctions very marked. That a _roturie=
r_, a plain peasant, or=20

even a tradesman, should become the social equal of a noble was a thing unh=
eard of. But in=20

Provence--curiously enough when one remembers the excessive refinement of l=
uxury encouraged=20

in this land of flowers--the society was much more democratic. Perhaps it w=
ould be more accurate=20

to say that among a people who had already discovered that literature and m=
usic were arts the=20

artist was welcomed, talent was recognized and rewarded, no matter in what =
class it was found.=20

Yet the troubadours as a class belong to the nobility. That this was almost=
 necessarily so one can=20

easily understand, for the troubadour was expected to live a life of gay ex=
travagance in his own=20

chateau and to travel about the country during favoring weather, accompanie=
d by a little band of=20

retainers who must be trained musicians, and who at the castles they visite=
d sang or performed=20

pieces of their master's composing.  We can imagine what a flutter there mu=
st have been in the=20

breasts of the ladies, always the prime object of the troubadour's songs, w=
hen the gay cavalcade=20

approached, heralded by the song of the _jongleurs_: "We come, bringing a=
=20


_
when she gave birth to it, (_namely her daughter; and she was hoping that i=
t might be a boy; since=20

none but boys were dedicated_,) she said, O my Lord, verily I have brought =
forth a female, (and=20

God well knew what she had brought forth,) and the male is not as the femal=
e, _the latter not=20

being fit for the service_ [of the temple]; and I have named her Mary [Mary=
am]; and I beg thy=20

protection for her and her offspring from the accursed devil.[327] (_In the=
 traditions_ [it is said],=20

_No child is born but the devil hath touched it at the time of its birth, w=
herefore it first raiseth its=20

voice by crying, excepting Mary and her son._[328]) And her Lord accepted h=
er (_that is, He=20

accepted Mary from her mother_) with a gracious acceptance, and caused her =
to grow with an=20

excellent growth, _as though she grew in a day as a child_ [generally] _gro=
weth in a month_. _Her=20

mother took her to the doctors, the keepers of the Holy House, and said, Re=
ceive ye this devoted=20

child. And they eagerly desired her, because she was the daughter of their =
chief. But Zechariah=20

said, I am more worthy of having her; for her maternal aunt is with me. The=
y however replied, Nay,=20

but we will cast lots.--So they departed (and they were nine and twenty) to=
 the river Jordan, and=20

cast their divining arrows on the understanding that he whose arrow should =
become steady in the=20

water and rise should be_ [acknowledged] _most worthy of her; and the arrow=
 of Zechariah=20

became steady, and he took her, and built for her a chamber in the temple, =
with stairs to which no=20

one ascended but himself. And he used to bring her her food and her drink a=
nd her ointment; and=20

used to find with her the fruits of winter in summer, and the fruits of sum=
mer in winter, as He--

whose name be exalted!--hath said_, And Zechariah maintained her. Whenever =
Zechariah went in=20

to her in the chamber, he found with her provisions. He said, O Mary, whenc=
e came to thee this?=20

She answered, (_being then a little child_,) It is from God: _He bringeth i=
t to me from Paradise_:=20

for God supplieth whom He pleaseth without reckoning.  Then, _when he saw t=
his, and knew that=20

He who was able to produce a thing out of its season was able to give a chi=
ld in old age, (and the=20

people of his house had become extinct,)_ Zechariah supplicated his Lord, _=
when he had entered=20

the chamber to pray in the latter part of the night_. He said, O my Lord, g=
ive me from Thee a good=20

offspring (_a righteous son_); for Thou art the Hearer of prayer.--And the =
angels (_by which is=20

meant Gabriel_) called to him as he stood praying in the chamber (_that is,=
 the temple_), saying,=20

God promiseth thee John [Yahya], who shall be a verifier of [the] Word _whi=
ch cometh_ from God,=20

(_that is, Jesus_ ['Eesa]; _for he is the Spirit of God, and was named_ [th=
e] _Word because he=20

was created by the word Be_,) and a chief, (_or one followed_,) and chaste,=
 and a prophet, of the=20

righteous. (_It is related that he neither did any sin nor intended any._)-=
-He said, O my Lord, how=20

shall I have a son, when old age hath come upon me, _when I have attained t=
he utmost age, a=20

hundred and twenty years_, and my wife is barren, _and hath attained the ag=
e of eight and=20

ninety_?--He answered, _It shall be_ thus. God will do what He pleaseth.--H=
e said, O my Lord,=20

give me a sign.--He replied, Thy sign [shall be] that thou shalt not speak =
unto men for three days,=20

except by signal; but remember thy Lord often, and glorify [Him] in the eve=
ning and in the morning.=20

(iii. 31-36.)   And he went forth unto his people from the chamber, and mad=
e a sign unto them, [as=20

though he would say] Glorify [God] in the morning and in the evening _as us=
ual_. _And he knew=20

by his being prevented from speaking unto them that his wife had conceived =
John. And after his=20

birth, by some years, God said unto him_, O John, receive the book (_that i=
s, the Law_) with=20

resolution. And We bestowed on him wisdom (_the gift of prophecy_) [when he=
 was yet] a child,=20

_three years of age_, and compassion from Us _for mankind_, and [a disposit=
ion to bestow] alms=20



_upon troubles both of body and mind. It is contained in a vase of gold, ad=
orned with jewels, the=20

most rare. Even to see it is wonderful pleasure, as you will find if you ca=
re to try. The balsam is the=20

music of our master, the vase of gold is our courtly company. Would you hav=
e the vase open, and=20

disclose its ineffable treasure?"  The troubadour himself must go in knight=
ly panoply, and he and=20

his musicians or jongleurs were usually provided with rich clothing. Gifts,=
 of course, might be=20

accepted from a sovereign, but no pecuniary recompense; the knightly minstr=
el disdained to sing=20

for hire; it was pure love of his art that inspired him, and the idea of ma=
king it a lucrative profession=20

never occurred to him. The troubadour, therefore, had to live upon his patr=
imony--until he=20

squandered it in riotous living--and only a gentleman could afford to do th=
at. Of the scores of=20

troubadours whose names are known to us, the great majority are nobles, tho=
ugh not always=20

belonging to the higher nobility; but the artist, the musician who "found" =
enchanting melodies, was=20

almost _ex officio_ a knight, a chevalier, the terms troubadour and chevali=
er being=20

interchangeable, and knighthood was considered so essential that one of the=
 well-known=20

troubadours was accused of having conferred the dignity upon himself, since=
 no one else would=20

knight him. Among the number of the troubadours one can count a score or mo=
re of reigning=20

princes, "counts and dukes by the dozen,... many princes of royal blood, an=
d finally four kings."=20

Yet beside the royal troubadour, and associated with him in a perfect freem=
asonry of art, one finds=20

the troubadour of humble birth. Bertrand de Born, the petty baron, was on t=
erms of perfect equality=20

with the sons of Henry II.: Geoffrey, he called by the nickname of _Rassa_,=
 Henry was _Marinier_,=20

and Richard was _Richard Oc e No_ (Richard Yea and Nay). Pierre Vidal, the =
most eccentric of all=20

the _genus irritabile_, was the son of a furrier of Toulouse, and yet, bein=
g a poet, was the friend of=20

princes, notably of Alphonso, the troubadour king of Arragon. Bernard de Ve=
ntadour, who=20

ventured, unrebuked, to send love songs to haughty Queen Eleanor, was the s=
on of the baker of=20

the chateau de Ventadour. There was, therefore, much greater freedom of int=
ercourse in Provence=20

than in the north of France, where feudalism had taken deeper root, where t=
he warrior was merely=20

a hard hitter, not a musician who went about equally prepared to fight or t=
o sing.  The grace and=20

polish of Provencal society was, of course, only relative. At best, it was =
merely a surface polish in=20

many cases; and to us the manners of the troubadours might seem as coarse a=
s their morals were=20

corrupt. The very extravagance of the troubadour's life, with its constant =
demands for large=20

expenditure in travel or in fantastic entertainments and revels at his chat=
eau, the persistent thirst=20

for excitement and pleasure in themselves would have been sufficient to fos=
ter licentious habits.=20

Prodigality reduced many a troubadour to the rank of a mere jongleur or hir=
ed musician. A=20

mediaeval moralist remarks, for the benefit of _la cigale_,--who probably p=
aid no attention=20

whatever, but went on singing,--_Homo joculatoribus intentus cito habebit u=
xorem cut nomen erit=20

paupertas, ex qua generabitur filius cui nomen erit derisio_ (He who devote=
s himself to minstrelsy=20

will soon have a wife named Poverty, of whom will be born a son named Ignom=
iny.) But whether=20

or not the troubadour made a sinful waste of his fortune, his one business =
in life was understood to=20

be making love.  Every troubadour chose some lady to whom he devoted his ta=
lents, seeking to=20

make her          "Glorious by his pen, and famous by his sword."  Like a t=
rue knight-errant of music=20

and poetry, he travelled over the land, singing the praises of his lady-lov=
e and upholding the=20

superiority of her charms in the lists, in battles with the infidel, or in =
any chance adventure on the=20

road. After enduring in her honor whatever fortune might send him, and sing=
ing to her in songs of=20



triumph or=20


_
parents, and was not proud [nor] rebellious _toward his Lord_; and peace _f=
rom Us_ [was] on him=20

on the day when he was born, and on the day of his death, and [shall be] on=
 the day when he shall=20

be raised to life. (xix. 12-15.)  And _remember_ when the angels (_that is,=
 Gabriel_) said, O Mary,=20

verily God hath chosen thee and hath purified thee and hath chosen thee abo=
ve the women of the=20

peoples _of thy time_. O Mary, be devout towards thy Lord and prostrate thy=
self and bow down=20

with those who bow down: _pray with plaintive love songs, he would return t=
o claim his reward. So=20

far, all is romantic and innocent enough. One can indulge in lovely sentime=
ntal fancies concerning=20

this world of gentle singers and fair ladies and poesy and sunshine. But in=
 sober fact the loves of=20

the troubadours were neither so romantic nor even so innocent as one would =
gladly think. In a=20

certain class of modern novels, the hero rarely experiences a _grande passi=
on_, as it is charitably=20

called, except for some other man's wife; so the lady to whom=20


_
of things unseen _by thee_: We reveal it unto thee, _O Mohammad_; for thou =
wast not with them=20

when they cast their divining arrows _that it might appear to them_ which o=
f them should rear=20

Mary, and thou wast not with them when they disputed together _as to rearin=
g her_.--

_Remember_ when the angels (_that is, Gabriel_) said, O Mary, verily God pr=
omiseth thee [the]=20

Word from Him, whose name [shall be] the Messiah [El-Meseeh], Jesus the his=
 passion with all=20

the cunning and warmth that art can devise, and of whose favors he sometime=
s most ungallantly=20

boasts, is almost invariably a married woman. Fortunately, despite the fact=
 that poets are given to=20

proclaiming that truth and poetry are almost synonyms, most of us do not ta=
ke them _au pied de la=20

lettre_. "Most loving is feigning," says a good authority, and certainly mo=
st of the protestations in=20

erotic poetry are=20
