philodendron monstera a desperate struggle between tribes of an early and a newer civilization, one of the primitive race-strifes that shaped our people. Now it is a haunt of the country-lover and the tourist, many of slightest; and she at length admitted that she wanted some one to reply--and sharply--to an article that had been written about a friend of hers.

tor of 1568 feet in height, and also some standing-stones named the Nine Maidens, with their 

fallen piper. The girls were thus doomed and changed into stone as a punishment for dancing on 

Sunday. Though their piper is displaced and mutilated, they still dance each day at noon--for those 

whose faith is equal to the demand. Belstone is one of several "Bels" in the Dartmoor country, 

such as Bellever and Bel Tor, but we have yet to learn that they have any connection with Baal, in 

spite of all the nonsense that has been talked.    [Illustration: TAVY CLEAVE                  (_Page 

27_)]  At Sticklepath, a charmingly pretty village with beautiful flower-gardens, there is a holy well 

with a curiously inscribed stone; while at South Zeal, near a quaint belfry, is an interesting wayside 

cross. There are some delightful old houses in the neighbourhood, usually manorial in their origin 

and now turned into farms, such as North Wyke, West Wyke, and Wykington. It is from this side 

that the ascent of Cosdon Beacon is often made--Cosdon, sometimes called Cawsand, being 

noted for the fine stone-rows and other immemorial relics to be found on its slopes. The Beacon 

has been introduced to literature by novels of Mr. Baring-Gould and Mr. Phillpotts. We are 

reminded also of fiction--the familiar pages of _Westward Ho!_--by the name of the Oxenham 

Arms, preserving the memory of a famous old Devon family, the Oxenhams, with their tradition of 

the white bird.  By whatever way we pass from Okehampton or South Tawton to Chagford, we are 

delayed on all sides by numberless spots of beauty or interest. The main road, which branches to 

could be nothing but a benefit to them.  Their life must have been full of privations and cares. 

_Forsan et haec olim meminisse juvabit_; but the pleasure ought to lie in thinking of the escape; 

so that we maintain that to base any piece of literary work on such a false sentiment as nostalgia 

is seen to be, leads us to suspect the _veracity_ of the writer and calls upon us to be on our guard. 

Moreover, we maintain that it is of the essence of pastoral and idyllic poetry to be cheerful and 

jocund; and it is to be observed that sadness prevails in poetry only when a nation has passed its 

youth and becomes saturated with the regret of old age.  We prefer the stories told  _Where 

Corydon and Thyrsis met_ _Are at their savoury dinner set;_  and the lyrist when he sings  _Dulce 

ridentem Lalagen amabo,_   _Dulce loquentem;_  and we hold that when the poets of a nation are 

permeated by a lackadaisical sentiment--when they have the candour to style themselves the idle 

singers of an empty day--when the burden of their song is regret and weariness and a lamentation 

over former joys--then it is time for such poets and the nation they represent to take a back seat in 

the lecture halls of literature, and give way to the newer and stronger race that is bound to 

dominate the future.'  She read no farther; and it is a great pity that she did not; for the writer by 

and by went on to say some very nice things about these unlucky verses; and even hinted that 

here was a man who might be benefited by coming to stay in Chicago,--'the future capital of the 

future empire of the world,'--and by having his eyes opened as to the rate

Moreton, but familiarity with the moorland can never be gained by proceeding along a highroad, 

whether on foot or awheel. Many as are the remaining standing-stones, circles, and pounds, those 

that have been destroyed were far more numerous; but the finest monument of the "old people" is 

rarely as attractive as the natural beauties that surround many of them, and only the professed 

antiquarian will care to examine them all with patient study. To most of us they are only bare 

stones. They are so ancient that the human interest has died from them. But we find this human 

touch at elaborate compliment to the intellectual perspicacity and judgment of Miss Carry herself. 

She did not read beyond what is quoted above for the simple reason that she was in a most 

violent rage, and also extremely mortified with herself for being so vexed.  She tore the newspaper 

into shreds, and crushed these together, and flung them into the bottom of the boat.  Her cheeks 

were quite pale; her eyes burning; and through all the anger of her disappointment ran the shame 

of the consciousness that it was she who had exposed Ronald to this insult. What though he

house, now a farm, where an ace of diamonds painted on the woodwork of a bedroom reminds us 

of a former squire, who had it placed there in order that he might curse it each night for the ruin it 

had brought him in his gambling.  Gidleigh, which is near, stands high, and has a fine park of oak, 

birch, and mountain-ash, with ferns and whortles in a rock-strewn undergrowth. Its colouring is 

especially rich in the fall of the year, with the lovely fading of ferns, the purple of heath, and the 

Chicago would know.  And it was the man whom she wanted to glorify and make a hero of who 

had, through her instrumentality, been subjected to the pedantic criticism, the pretentious 

analyses, and, worst of all, the insulting patronage of this unspeakable ass.  Suddenly she 

regretted the destruction of the newspaper; she would like to have looked at it again, to justify her 

wrath.  No matter; she could remember enough; and she would not forget Jack Huysen's share in 

this transaction.  She

berries. The North Teign dashes foamingly below, fretful and rock-thwarted. This is really a more 

beautiful spot than ever was the Holy Street Mill that Creswick and other artists painted; plenty of 

picturesque mills may be found throughout the country, but scenes of such loveliness are rare. 

The rhododendrons in bloom add much to the beauty of Gidleigh, which also boasts a small castle 

with whose ruinous walls the ash trees have incorporated themselves.  At Teign Head (not quite 

the head of the river) is one of the moorland's clapper bridges; but Leigh Bridge, where the two 

Teigns meet, though of the common single-arch type, is more charming because its surroundings 

are wooded. The two rivers unite before reaching Chagford, and beyond that modernized and 

popular little resort the Teign passes out of the confines of the moor altogether. But at Fingle 

Bridge, one of the most famous Devon beauty-spots, something of moorland wildness believe that, 

after all, in spite of her repeated assurances, their ill-luck with the fishing was weighing on her 

spirits.  'You know, Carry,' said he, 'it is not in the nature of things that weather like this can last in 

the Highlands of Scotland.  It is notoriously one of the wettest places in the world.  There _must_ 

be rain coming soon; and then think of all the fish that will be rushing up in shoals, and what a time 

we shall have.'  'I am not disappointed with the fishing at all, pappa,' she said.  'I think we have 

done very well.'  'What is the matter, then?'  'Oh, nothing.'  And then she said--  'Well, I will tell you, 

pappa.  I asked Jack Huysen to do me a very particular favour; and he did not do it; and when I 

next see Jack Huysen, I think he will find it a very cold day.'  The words were mysterious; but the 

tone was enough.  And all the afternoon she sate in the stern of the coble and brooded,

is of remarkable beauty. It here passes the fine trees of Whiddon Park till it comes to a ravine 

every yard of which seems to be prehistoric dust. There are earthworks and camps on both sides; 

while not far off is the great dolmen or cromlech of Drewsteignton, near the small Bradmere pool. 

Ancient camps are not common on the actual moorland, but we find them here at the fringe: those 

Bronze Age moormen appear to have been peaceable among themselves, and only to have 

raised entrenchments against external the editor of the _Nation_, to the editor of the Chicago 

_Tribune_, to the editor of _Puck_, and a great many other journals, all of these phantom epistles 

beginning 'As an American girl I appeal to you,' and proceeding to beg of the editor to hold up to 

merciless scorn a certain feeble, shallow, and impertinent article (herewith enclosed) which had 

appeared in the _Chicago Citizen_.  And on the way home, too, in the evening, she began to 

question her father as to his personal acquaintance with editors
