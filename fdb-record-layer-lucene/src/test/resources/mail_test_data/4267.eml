"Then I'll go alone," decided Jack, and he started off soon after the midda=
y meal. The storm was=20

not a severe one, though it was cold and the snow was quite heavy. It was a=
 good three-mile walk=20

to the village, but Jack had often taken it.  He was about a mile from the =
school, and was swinging=20

along the country road, thinking of many things, when, through the white bl=
anket of snowflakes, he=20

saw a figure just ahead of him on the highway.  "That looks familiar," he s=
aid to himself. "That's=20

Will Williams. Wonder       ?=20


_
what he can be doing out here? Guess he's going to town also. I'll catch up=
 with him. I wish I could=20

get better acquainted with him, but he goes in his shell as soon as I try t=
o make friends."  He=20

hastened his pace, but it was slow going on account of the snow. When Jack =
was about a hundred=20

yards behind Will he was surprised to see the odd student suddenly turn off=
 the main road and=20

make toward a chain of small hills that bordered it on the right.  "That's =
queer," murmured Jack. "I=20

wonder what he's doing that for?"  He stood still a moment, looking at Will=
. The new boy kept on,=20

plodding through the snow, which lay in heavy drifts over the unbroken path=
 he was taking.  "Why,=20

he's=20


_
if he goes there in this storm, and it's dangerous. He may fall down the ch=
asm and break an arm=20

or a leg."  The ravine he referred to was a deep gully in the hills, a wild=
, desolate sort of place,=20

seldom visited. It was in the midst of thick woods, and more than once soli=
tary travelers had lost=20

their way there, while one or two, unfamiliar with the suddenness with whic=
h the chasm dipped=20

down, had fallen and been severely hurt.  "What in=20


_
hail him. Guess he doesn't know the danger, especially in a storm like this=
, when bad holes are=20

likely to be hidden from sight."  He hurried forward, and then, making a so=
rt of megaphone of his=20

hands, called out:  "Williams! I say, Williams, where are you going?"  The =
new boy turned quickly,=20

looked back at Jack, and then continued his journey.  "Hey! Come back!" yel=
led our hero. "You'll=20

be lost if you go up in those hills. It's dangerous! Come on back!"  Willia=
ms stopped again, and=20

turned half around.  "Guess he didn't hear me plainly," thought Jack. "I'll=
 catch up to him. Wait a=20

minute," he called again, and he hastened forward, Will waiting for him.  "=
Where are you going?"=20

asked Jack, when he had caught up to him.  "I don't know," was the answer, =
and Jack was struck=20

by the lad's despondent tone.  "Don't you know there's a dangerous ravine j=

unexpected rejoinder.  "You don't care?" repeated Jack, much surprised.  "N=
