"  Gripping his gun,=20

he stopped.  Out of the brush and the shadows stepped a figure that even in=
 the dim moonlight=20

appeared familiar.  "What are you doing here?" a woman's voice asked. "How =
did you come? And=20

why?"  The woman was tall, and rather slender. She wore a broad hat that hi=
d her face.  It's that=20

slim queen of the island, was Jack's thought. He had come to think of her a=
s just that, but was=20

astonished to discover that she spoke English fluently.  "Who are you? And =
what are you doing=20

here?" he countered, taking two steps.  "It doesn't matter who I am," came =
slowly. "It will pay you=20

to stay where you are. I am not alone."  Jack remained where he was. He see=
med to catch sight of=20

shadowy figures in the brush. Visions of flying spears and arrows haunted h=
im.  "We're two fliers=20

to tell the truth. "Our plane was wrecked. We came ashore on a rubber raft.=
 Now, who are you?"=20

he repeated.  "How are we to know that you are speaking the truth?" the gir=
l asked, ignoring his=20

question. "There's a Jap raft drawn up on the beach," she went on.  "Yes. W=
e drew it up." Jack's=20

throat went dry.  "Then perhaps you came in it."  "Do I look like a Jap?" H=
e played his flashlight on=20

his own face.  "Not like a Jap, but you might be a German. All the traders =
were Germans before=20

the war."  "All right. Have it your way!" He threw a flash of light into he=
r eyes. By doing this, he=20

discovered an added pair of eyes--small, monkey eyes. The monk was on her s=
houlder.  "Is that=20

your monkey?" he asked.  "Yes."  "How did you get that American nurse's ide=
ntification tag the=20

monkey wears?" He asked without thinking.  "That!" There was anger in her v=
oice. "That's none of=20

your affair."  She went on after a moment, "We want to know about you."  "A=
nd now you know." He=20

laughed softly.  "Do I?" She returned the laugh.  "Do you know all about th=
ose fellows who come=20

here in that queer sort of plane?" he asked.  "Do you?" she came back at hi=
m.  "No."  "Well then,=20

that makes two of us. Thanks for listenin'. Good night." She was gone.  She=
's heard that farewell=20

off here on the radio, Jack thought. Did missionaries have radios? He suppo=
sed they did. Queer=20

little world he had dropped into. So she didn't know much about those two m=
en and the mystery=20

plane? Well, one way or another, _he_ was going to learn more. If they turn=
ed out to be=20

Australian, British, or Dutch, they might give the boys a lift to some spot=
 held by the United=20

Nations. Then Stew and he would get back in time for the big push against M=
indanao, he thought.=20

Worth taking a chance for that, he assured himself. A very long chance.   W=
hen Kentucky and two=20

of his night fighting comrades made their way back to the carrier they were=
 greeted with=20

enthusiasm.  "You did it!" The Commander gripped Kentucky's hand. "You brok=
e up their=20

formation! Not a torpedo found its mark. But where is Ted?" His voice dropp=
ed.  "We don't know,=20

sir," said Kentucky, wrinkling his brow. "We had to scatter, and go on our =
own."  "Of course."  "Red=20

saw him climbing for altitude, sir--thought his motor might have been smoki=
ng."  "Yes, sir. That's=20

the way it was," Red put in. "After that the moon went under for quite a wh=
ile. When it came out his=20

plane was gone. I thought I saw a white gleam like a parachute in the moonl=
ight quite close to the=20

water, but I wasn't sure."  "We'll hope he made a safe landing," said the C=
ommander. "We have to=20

go in about a hundred miles. The Marines go ashore at dawn. We must furnish=
 them a protecting=20

screen. You boys have done a fine job. Now get some chow and rest. We'll ne=
ed you again soon.=20

It's going to be a long pull for you, but this is war."   The moon had come=
 out just in time for Ted's=20

landing. He sank beneath the sea, lost his grip on the rubber raft, then ca=
me up for air.  The moon=20

was still out. His raft was some ten yards away. After disengaging himself =
from his chute, he swam=20

to the raft, then worked himself into it with great care. This accomplished=
, he paddled to his chute,=20

squeezed the water out of it as best he could, then deposited it on one end=
 of the raft.  He took off=20

his clothing. The air was warm. He was not uncomfortable. After wringing ou=
t his clothes he put=20

them all on again except his heavy flying jacket. He was warm enough withou=
t wearing the jacket.=20

Then, with feet on the chute and head on the inflated edge of the raft, he =
sprawled out in absolute=20

repose.  "Nothing I can do right now," he assured himself. "Might get a lit=
tle sleep." He recalled the=20

words of his father.  "You may have to bail out and land on the sea," his f=
ather had said. "If you=20

happen to find yourself in a fix like that," his father had rambled on, "yo=
u may feel like praying that=20

there will be no violent storms, that God may send birds to light on your r=
aft so you can catch and=20

eat them, that He'll send fish, not sharks--all that sort of thing.  "Well,=
 if you feel that way about it,"=20



his father had paused, "it won't do you any harm. But for my part, I'd rath=
er pray for wisdom and=20

skill, for the good sense to relax and take it easy, to save my strength an=
d my skill for catching fish=20

and birds and preparing them for food. I'm convinced that there is a power =
within us or about us=20

that does give us both skill and wisdom if we only ask for them."  "A power=
 within us or about us,"=20

Ted repeated slowly, "that gives us skill and wisdom." At that, rocked by s=
mall waves, he fell=20

asleep.  Kentucky never needed much rest when he was in a fighting mood. Tw=
o hours of sleep, a=20

stack of pancakes, three cups of black coffee, and he was ready to lead his=
 fighters out over the=20

island that lay like a dark, gray shadow rising out of the sea in the first=
 flush of dawn.  One by one=20

the planes left the carrier. Fighters, scout planes, dive bombers, torpedo =
planes--all thundered=20

away toward their target.  Leading them all, Kentucky felt important and ve=
ry happy.  "Hot diggity!"=20

he exclaimed to the morning air. "This is what I call life! And here's wher=
e we pay the Japs a little=20

on account for Pearl Harbor." He was thinking of little Joe Kreider, his pa=
l from Kentucky.  He's=20

gone, Kentucky thought soberly. Japs got him in that sneak attack on Pearl =
Harbor. Gone, but not=20

forgotten. He gave his motor a fresh burst of gas.  Then he saw it, a big o=
ld four-motored Jap=20

snooper slipping out for a look at their carrier.  "Hot dog!" Kentucky's pl=
ane shot skyward and then=20

came plunging down in a steep curve. His two guns poured hot lead into the =
snooper's right=20

distinguished from those caused by solid bodies. Such burns are classed as =
scalds. Their effects=20

may vary in any degree between slight redness and complete destruction of t=
he tissues with=20

charring. Burns caused by melted solids are less regular in form and outlin=
e than those caused by=20

heated solids. They are usually of greater severity on account of the high =
temperature to which=20

they have been raised.[700]  =3DBoiling Water.=3D=E2=80=94Scalds by boiling=
 water may be so slight as to=20

produce redness only, or they may be so severe as to cause marked and chara=
cteristic symptoms.=20

Those noted in severe cases are an ashy hue of the skin, accompanied by a s=
oaked or sodden=20

appearance and the production of blisters. Occasionally these features are =
not easily distinguished=20

from those of burns from other sources. Blackening of the skin and charring=
 of the tissues never=20

result from burns by boiling water. As in all burns, a large surface involv=
ed renders an early fatal=20

issue probable. In severe cases, not necessarily fatal, gangrene of the par=
ts injured sometimes=20

occurs. Most of those met with are accidental, yet cases of scalding by hot=
 water with intent to=20

injure are not uncommon, aside from injuries and death resulting from explo=
sion of boilers,=20

bursting of steam-pipes, etc. Occasional instances are recorded of death of=
 children, the insane or=20

feeble persons by inadvertent immersion in a bath of hot water (Case 21).  =
Severe and fatal burns=20

of the mouth, fauces, and larynx in young children occur from _inhaling ste=
am_ or swallowing=20

boiling water from a teapot or kettle in an attempt to drink (Case 5).  =3D=
Burns by burning oil=3D=20

produce effects and appearances similar to those by melted metals.  =3DBurn=
s by flame=3D are=20

specially characterized by scorching of the surface. Hairs upon the part ac=
tually burned are=20

scorched and usually also those in the vicinity of the burned patches. Such=
 conditions could not=20

result from scalds by hot water, boiling oil, or from a hot body only.  =3D=
Burns by petroleum=3D or its=20

derivatives resemble the burns from flame, except that the injured portions=
 of the body are not only=20

scorched but blackened and are usually burned more severely than by flame a=
lone, as the clothing=20

holds the burning substance in contact with the parts. The odor of the agen=
t is also very=20

noticeable.  =3DBurns by Acids and Corrosive Agents.=3D=E2=80=94The injury =
produced by a mineral acid, the=20

caustic alkalies, etc., has frequently been the source of judicial inquiry.=
 =E2=80=9CVitriol-throwing,=E2=80=9D as it has=20



been termed, has been and occasionally is resorted to with malicious intent=
 to injure. No case of=20

death resulting directly and solely from this cause is recorded, but grave =
injuries, involving loss of=20

sight, etc., have resulted. A case is referred to by Taylor[701] where sulp=
huric acid was poured=20

into the ear of a woman while asleep by her husband. Death ensued, after si=
x weeks, from=20

disease of the brain resulting indirectly from the use of the acid.  The ap=
pearances of a burn by a=20

mineral acid are distinguished from heat burns with little difficulty. The =
eschar which results is not=20

dry and leathery, as in a burn by heat, but soft and readily sloughing away=
. There is no redness=20

around the site of the injury, the color of the burn being uniform, and no =
blisters are formed. There=20

is no blackening of the skin and the hairs are not scorched. The color of t=
he skin around the=20

injured portion may afford valuable evidence of the nature of the agent emp=
loyed. Nitric acid=20

produces a yellow stain, sulphuric acid a dark brown, and chlorohydric acid=
 a brownish-yellow=20

stain.[702] The clothing also is capable of affording characteristic eviden=
ce by the discolorations=20

produced; and the destructive agent employed may be determined by a chemica=
l analysis of the=20

fabric.[703]  It is not possible to distinguish a post-mortem from an ante-=
mortem burn by an acid=20

when no vital reaction has taken place.   THE CLASSIFICATION OF BURNS.  A c=
lassification of=20

burns according to the severity of the injury inflicted is the most practic=
al course. Upon this plan,=20

burns may be divided into four general classes:  I. Burns in which the skin=
 or subcutaneous=20

cellular tissues only are injured.  II. Burns which involve the muscles, ne=
rves, and blood-vessels.=20

III. Burns involving the internal organs and bones.  IV. Burns in which the=
 other three classes are=20

variously mixed.  CLASS I.=E2=80=94The skin in cases such as may occur from=
 a brief contact with a hot=20

body or water near the boiling-point shows a slight redness or scorching wi=
th no enduring mark.=20

Pain is considerable.  CLASS II.=E2=80=94In the mildest cases the cutis is =
destroyed in its whole=20

thickness, and the parts injured are occupied by eschars of a yellowish-gra=
y or brownish color.=20

The surrounding skin is reddened, and the formation of blisters occurs eith=
er immediately or after=20

an interval of a few hours. In these cases a shining cicatrix remains after=
 the healing, without=20

contraction of surrounding parts. In the severer cases the subcutaneous cel=
lular tissue and=20

underlying muscles and nerves are destroyed. The blackish eschars formed ar=
e insensible and=20

separate by suppurative process, leaving a granulating surface below. Exten=
sive redness of=20

surrounding tissues, with more or less vesication, is usually noted. The re=
sulting cicatrices,=20

together with the skin and adjoining structures, are prone to contraction, =
resulting in considerable=20

deformity, according to location and extent. So great is the deformity in i=
njuries of the extremities,=20

or even some parts of the head and trunk, that extensive surgical operation=
s become necessary to=20

relieve it.  CLASS III.=E2=80=94Burns of this class are so severe that an=
=20


_
outside motor. The motor, almost cut away, hung by shreds.  Before the snoo=
per could right itself,=20

Kentucky was back, firing away at the other right motor. He set it smoking.=
 The big plane tilted,=20

rolled over, then went plunging toward the sea.  All this had happened in t=
he space of seconds.=20

Enough time had elapsed, however, for other things to be brewing. Suddenly =
two of his fighting=20

pals joined him, while from up beyond there came the sharp _rat-a-tat-tat_ =
of machine-gun fire.=20

Rubbing his eyes, Kentucky peered into the brightening dawn. A half mile or=
 so before him he=20

made out the shadowy forms of several planes circling wildly, with guns bla=
zing.  His triggerlike=20

mind took in the situation in an instant. "Hey! Red! Blackie! Jean!" he roa=
red into his radio. "Hold=20

up! Circle Back! BACK!"  As they began swinging back, speaking in a low ton=
e, he continued:=20

"That's only a bunch of Zeros putting on a show for us. It looks like a fig=
ht, but it's only a sham=20

battle. None of our planes are in there. We're in the lead."  Through his e=
arphones he caught low=20

grumbles and some unprintable words.  "Come on, now," he invited. "Get into=
 formation. You=20

know the lineup. We'll join in their game, all right, but on our own terms.=
"  They climbed rapidly and=20

joined in wing-to-wing formation, fatal issue is usually the result. Such i=
nstances involve a=20

prolonged exposure to flame or to a source of intense heat. The appearances=
 described as=20

belonging to the preceding class are in part found here with the addition o=
f charring or carbonizing=20

the parts destroyed.   EFFECTS OF BURNS.  The effects of burns may be consi=
dered as I.,=20

_Local_, and II., _Constitutional_.  =3DLocal Effects.=3D=E2=80=94In differ=
ent instances the effects vary in=20

accordance with the extent and severity of the burn. Redness, blisters, des=
truction of the cuticle=20

and of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, blackening of the skin, scorching =
of the hair, and roasting=20

of portions of the body are met with in varying degrees. In some severe cas=
es all these are found=20

upon a single body. The redness produced varies in intensity and extent, ac=
cording to the nature=20

of the agent producing the burn, its form, and the length of time the part =
was exposed.  Very soon=20

after the infliction of the burn a special line of redness appears between =
the burned parts and the=20

uninjured skin. This _red line of demarcation_ is formed by intensely injec=
ted vessels and=20

becomes a very important medico-legal sign in some cases. The vesication ma=
y be single or=20

multiple, consisting of one or two large and full blisters or a number of l=
arge and=20


_
the lead and Red bringing up the rear. Red carried a gunner, the best the N=
avy knew, in his rear=20

cockpit.  "Now! Come on down! And give it to them for my old pal Joe and al=
l the American boys=20

lost at Pearl Harbor!" Kentucky shouted into his mike. And down they came.=
=20

CHAPTER XIII                              THE JET PLANE   In the meantime J=
ack had decided on a bold=20

stroke. He was not sure that at this time it was a wise thing to do, but hi=
s burning desire to make=20

his way back to the carrier and resume his post of duty there had all but d=
riven burned, some=20

unbroken and still holding their contents, others broken and denuded of cut=
icle or with breaks from=20

which their serum has escaped upon the surrounding parts. In some cases of =
burning _cracks or=20

fissures_ in the skin occur, due to the effect of the heat, making it dry a=
nd brittle and causing it to=20

rupture by the movements of the patient (Case 8). These fissures are most f=
requently noted in=20

proximity to the joints.[704] They resemble wounds, and it occurs occasiona=
lly that it is important=20

to accurately distinguish their character. In some cases the skin only is=
=20


_
As he paced back and forth on the beach, guarding camp and wondering about =
his strange night=20

visitor, he recalled the words of his uncle Dan who had fought in the first=
 World War:  "You'll be in=20

danger many times," he had said in a serious, friendly voice. "Your superio=
r officers will not are=20

also involved. This difference depends upon the depth of the burn. In the f=
irst condition the skin=20

splits, leaving the subcutaneous fat exposed, which in some instances is pa=
rtially melted by the=20

heat and flows out over the edge of the crack upon the surrounding skin (Ca=
ses 8, 13). The=20


_
decisions for you. You'll sometimes have to make them for yourself. Always =
keep this thought=20

uppermost in your mind: you are worth a great deal more to your country ali=
ve than dead. Don't=20

take unnecessary chances."  "Am I planning to take unnecessary chances now?=
" he asked=20

himself. Though he did not know the answer, he was willing to take the risk=
.  One more thing had=20

made a owing to their elasticity, remain stretching across the fissure (Cas=
e 14). The smaller may=20

be seen by careful examination with a lens: they should always be looked fo=
r. In the second class=20

of injuries the vessels are involved in the burn and break with the crackin=
g of the skin. The=20

importance of careful observation of these fissures is emphasized in cases =
of apparent wounds=20


_
said his uncle, who limped as a result of wounds received in France, "the t=
hing I want most to tell=20

you is this. While you are in service you will have comrades, many boon com=
panions, and if you=20

treat them right, as I know you will, you're sure to make attachments that =
will last as long as be=20

necessary to decide whether the wounds are the result of the action of heat=
 as above described or=20

were caused by some sharp instrument or weapon. Careful inspection of the e=
dges of the wounds=20

will show whether they are ragged, as the result of fissure, or clean-cut b=
y some sharp=20
