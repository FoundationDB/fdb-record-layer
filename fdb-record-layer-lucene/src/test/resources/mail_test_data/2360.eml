dracaena marginata passed about a hundred of them. When they saw us they br=
oke ranks and shook us by the hands. The people of England are much impress=
ed with our speed in coming over. Old men and women shouted, "God bless you=
, Canadians!" while tears trickled down their cheeks.  I read this notice i=
n one little shop,--       At noon every day the church bell will ring a fe=
w chimes and     College, brought it to light.  [10] See Tilloch's Phil. Ma=
g. Vol. XLII. p. 182.  [11] In the Journal of the Academy of Natural Scienc=
es of Philadelphia this plant is called limosella tenuifolia.  [12] No retu=
rn of this tree was made from Brunswick. The date of the cherry-tree is the=
refore substituted, which is usually in blossom at the same time.  [13] Mr.=
 Correa de Serra, dracaena marginata passed about a hundred of them. When t=
hey saw us they broke ranks and shook us by the hands. The people of Englan=
d are much impressed with our speed in coming over. Old men and women shout=
ed, "God bless you, Canadians!" while tears trickled down their cheeks.  I =
read this notice in one little shop,--       At noon every day the church b=
ell will ring a few chimes and     College, brought it to light.  [10] See =
Tilloch's Phil. Mag. Vol. XLII. p. 182.  [11] In the Journal of the Academy=
 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia this plant is called limosella tenuifo=
lia.  [12] No return of this tree was made from Brunswick. The date of the =
cherry-tree is therefore substituted, which is usually in blossom at the sa=
me time.  [13] Mr. Correa de Serra, _
started this morning and drove through Devonport. Cheering crowds everywher=
e. All our cars wear=20

the streaming pennants: "Canada With the Empire," which pleased the people =
a great deal.  As we=20

rode through the streets people showered gifts upon us, such as cakes, choc=
olates, newspapers=20

and apples, and everywhere made lusty demonstrations. The people of Taunton=
, as soon as they=20

heard that the Canadians were coming, turned out the barracks and we were m=
et by all the=20

officers, who came in to talk to us. One second lieutenant, after studying =
me for some time, said,=20

"Isn't your name Keene?" "Yes," I replied, "but how do you know?" "I went t=
o school with you=20

fifteen years ago." His name was Carter; he was in the Second Dorsets. That=
 night he got me out=20

of barracks for a true 5th, flattened by a comma, in the same manner as one=
 of its component 3ds=20

will be allowed by all to be flattened.  [7] The propriety of this limitati=
on will be manifest, when we=20

consider that in organ music, the chords are generally played more full, an=
d are more protracted,=20

than in music for other keyed instruments. It is harmony which constitutes =
its character, in a higher=20

degree than in music for other instruments. Hence the harmony of the organ =
ought not to be=20

impaired by including in our computations any music not adapted to it. If a=
 similar examination of=20

music for the piano-forte would afford a set of results essentially differe=
nt from those of this=20

proposition, this is no proof that it ought to have any concern in a system=
 of temperament=20

designed=20


_
reminiscences. The people of Taunton were arranging a dance for us, but nob=
ody was allowed to=20

attend. The major believes in putting us to bed early; his theory being tha=
t a man can't drive cars=20

well after a party, and he couldn't keep the drivers in alone.  Ladies from=
 Taunton, of the pleasing=20

English type with beautiful complexions, handed round all sorts of rubbish,=
 jam puffs, and other=20

things which belong to the time before we joined the army.  Traveled all th=
e morning. Everybody=20

turned out to see us. The Brigadier-General wired ahead, and hastily prepar=
ed placards, still wet,=20

were hanging from the windows,--       God Bless the Canadians     Loyal So=
ns     of     The Empire=20

The gathering of     the Lions' whelps   and in one case the haste was so g=
reat that "God Save the=20

King" was hung upside down.  Everybody wants my badges and buttons, and som=
e men in the=20

unit have not one left. Hence I have requisitioned an order for a hundred t=
o meet the demand.  All=20

over the temperament cannot be equally adapted to different instruments. If=
, as is probable, such=20

an examination would give essentially the same results, to introduce them w=
ould be superfluous.=20

[8] The smaller works of Phillips and Aikin were not then published; had th=
ey been, they could not=20

have superseded Cleaveland; the same may be said of the respectable work of=
 Professor Kidd, of=20

Oxford University.  [9] A vast region in the interior of New-York and Penns=
ylvania is now fertilized=20

by inexhaustible beds of sulphat of lime, (plaster of Paris,) which, till a=
 very few years since, were=20

not even known to exist.  Near New-Haven immense beds of green marble were =
discovered in=20

1811, during a mineralogical excursion: this beautiful material, closely re=
sembling the _verd=20

antique_, is now, on the spot, wrought into tables, fireplaces, and many ot=
her ornamental forms;=20

and although the farmers had made fences of it for 150 years, no one suspec=
ted what it was till=20

the study of mineralogy, in Yale=20
