philodendron monstera the Flood had swallowed up the people who would not h=
earken to Noah. He swore unto them, by the wonderful sights of nature, by t=
he noonday brightness, by the night when she spreadeth her veil, by the day=
 when it appeareth in glory, that a like destruction would assuredly come u=
pon them if they did not turn away from their idols and serve God alone. He=
 enforced his message with every and bucking until it seemed as if both of =
us would die from exhaustion. But I finally won. I got him down on his knee=

monstera the Flood had swallowed up the people who would not hearken to Noa=
h. He swore unto them, by the wonderful sights of nature, by the noonday br=
ightness, by the night when she spreadeth her veil, by the day when it appe=
areth in glory, that a like destruction would assuredly come upon them if t=
hey did not turn away from their idols and serve God alone. He enforced his=
 message with every and bucking until it seemed as if both of us would die =
from exhaustion. But I finally won. I got him down on his knees, and then r=
olled him over, and stood there until he acknowledged my leadership. That o=
f course was the happiest day of my life.=E2=80=9D  White Tail thrilled at =
this story, and for a moment forgot the thing he was going to do until his =
father spoke again.  =E2=80=9CNow let me see you _
fourth year of Mohammad's mission--thirty in three long years, and few of t=
hem men of influence!=20

This small success had been achieved with very little opposition from the i=
dolaters. Mohammad=20

had not spoken much in public; and when he did speak to strangers, he restr=
ained himself from=20

attacking their worship, and only enjoined them to worship the One God who =
had created all=20

things. The people were rather interested, and wondered whether he were a s=
oothsayer or=20

madman, or if indeed there were truth in his words. But now (A.D. 615) Moha=
mmad entered upon=20

a more public career. He summoned the Kureysh to a conference at the hill o=
f Es-Safa, and said, 'I=20

am come to you as a warner, and as the forerunner of a fearful punishment..=
.. I cannot protect you=20

in this world, nor can I promise you aught in the next life, unless ye say,=
 There is no God but=20

Allah.' He was laughed to scorn, and the assembly broke up; but from this t=
ime he ceased not to=20

preach to the people of a punishment that would come upon the unbelieving c=
ity. He told them, in=20

the fiery language of the early soorahs, how God had punished the old tribe=
s of the Arabs who=20

would not believe Stone brook, clearing it from bank to bank without falter=
ing or stumbling. If he=20

fails he must wait until he can make the leap. Many, many have tried and fa=
iled, and others=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D=20

White Tail=E2=80=99s eyes gleamed with anticipation. He liked to take risks=
 and attempt difficult tasks.  =E2=80=9CI=20

see,=E2=80=9D he said, laughing joyfully, =E2=80=9Cyou brought me here to s=
ee if I could make the leap. Well, I can=20

do it! I=E2=80=99ll show you. I won=E2=80=99t disappoint you, Father Buck.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI know you won=E2=80=99t, White Tail,=E2=80=9D was the=
=20

reply. =E2=80=9CI shouldn=E2=80=99t have brought you here so soon if I thou=
ght you would fail. But I had another=20

purpose, too.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat is it?=E2=80=9D asked White Tail.  =
=E2=80=9CI will tell you later. Now I want to see you take the=20

leap. Years ago, many, many seasons ago, I came here, and took it. There on=
 the rocks you can=20

see the marks of my leap. It was one of the longest ever made by any of our=
 people. I was=20

naturally proud of it. I shall never forget that day. I think it was the ha=
ppiest of my life=E2=80=94except=20

one.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhich other one?=E2=80=9D asked White Tail.  =E2=80=
=9CThe day I defeated Black Buck in the final struggle=20

for leadership,=E2=80=9D was the reply. =E2=80=9CIt was a battle that laste=
d for hours, and all the herd watched=20
