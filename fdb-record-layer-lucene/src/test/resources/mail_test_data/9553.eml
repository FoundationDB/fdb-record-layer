morrow?" asked Madame de Chevreuse.  "You will know that to-morrow evening,=
" said the coadjutor, _
St. Paul, in speaking of the rulers of this world, the Cosmocratores, only =
said what was said by all=20

the primitive Philosophers of the ten centuries before the Christian era, o=
nly he was scarcely=20

understood, and was often wilfully misinterpreted. Damascius repeats the te=
achings of the Pagan=20

writers when he explains that       There are seven series of cosmocratores=
 or cosmic forces,=20

which     are double: the higher ones commissioned to support and guide the=
     superior world; the=20

lower ones, the inferior world [our own].   And he is but saying what the a=
ncients taught.=20

Iamblichus gives this dogma of the duality of all the planets and celestial=
 bodies, of gods and=20

daimons (spirits). He also divides the Archontes into two classes--the more=
 and the less spiritual;=20

the latter more connected with and clothed with matter, as having a _form_,=
 while the former are=20

bodiless (_arupa_). But what have Satan and his angels to do with all this?=
 Perhaps only that the=20

identity of the Zoroastrian dogma with the Christian, and of Mithra, Ormuzd=
, and Ahriman with the=20

Christian Father, Son, and Devil, might be accounted for. And when we say "=
Zoroastrian dogmas"=20

we mean the exoteric teaching. How explain the same relations between Mithr=
a and Ormuzd as=20

those between the Archangel Mikael and Christ?       Ahura Mazda says to ho=
ly Zaratushta: "When=20

I _created_ [emanated]     Mithra ... I created him that he should be invok=
ed and adored     equally=20

with myself."   For the sake of necessary reforms, the Zoroastrian Aryans t=
ransformed the Devas,=20

the bright Gods of India, into devs or devils. It was their Karma that in t=
heir turn the Christians=20

should vindicate on this point the Hindus. Now Ormuzd and Mithra have becom=
e the devs of=20

Christ and Mikael, the dark lining and aspect of the Saviour and Angel. The=
 day of the Karma of=20

Christian theology will come in its turn. Already the Protestants have begu=
n the first chapter of the=20

religion that will seek to transform the "Seven Spirits" and the host of th=
e Roman Catholics into=20

demons and idols. Every religion has its Karma, as has every individual. Th=
at which is due to=20

human conception and is built on the abasement of our brothers who disagree=
 with us, must have=20

its day. "There is no religion higher than truth."  The Zoroastrians, Mazde=
ans, and Persians=20

borrowed their conceptions from India; the Jews borrowed their theory of an=
gels from Persia; the=20

Christians borrowed from the Jews.  Hence the latest interpretation by Chri=
stian theology--to the=20

great disgust of the synagogue, forced to share the symbolical candlestick =
with the hereditary=20

enemy--that the seven-branched candlestick represents the seven Churches of=
 Asia and the=20

seven planets which are the angels of those Churches. Hence also, the convi=
ction that the Mosaic=20

Jews, the inventors of that symbol for their tabernacle, were a kind of Sab=
aeans, who blended=20

their planets and the spirits thereof into one, and called them--only far l=
ater--Jehovah. For this we=20

have the testimony of Clemens Alexandrinus, St. Hieronymus and others.  And=
 Clement, as an=20

Initiate of the Mysteries--at which the secret of the heliocentric system w=
as taught several=20

thousands of years before Galileo and Copernicus--proves it by explaining t=
hat       By these=20

various symbols connected with (sidereal) phenomena the     totality of all=
 the creatures which bind=20

heaven with earth, are     figured.... The chandelier represented the motio=
n of the seven=20

luminaries, describing their astral revolution. To the right and     the le=
ft Athos in the Rue Saint=20

Honore; "what is the matter with him?"  "He was acting, but forgot to take =
the precaution to have a=20

change of linen ready after the performance," said the coadjutor, "so he to=
ok cold and is about to=20

die."  "Is he then so ill, dear Voiture?" asked Aramis, half hidden by the =
window curtain.  "Die!"=20

cried Mademoiselle Paulet, bitterly, "he! Why, he is surrounded by sultanas=
, like a Turk. Madame=20

de Saintot has hastened to him with broth; La Renaudot warms his sheets; th=
e Marquise de=20



Rambouillet sends him his tisanes."  "You don't like him, my dear Parthenie=
," said Scarron.  "What=20

an injustice, my dear invalid! I hate him so little that I should be deligh=
ted to order masses for the=20

repose of his soul."  "You are not called 'Lionne' for nothing," observed M=
adame de Chevreuse,=20

"your teeth are terrible."  "You are unjust to a great poet, it seems to me=
," Raoul ventured to say.=20

"A great poet! come, one may easily see, vicomte, that you are lately from =
the provinces and have=20

never so much as seen him. A great poet! he is scarcely five feet high."  "=
Bravo bravo!" cried a tall=20

man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier, "bravo, fair Paulet, it is=
 high time to put little=20

Voiture in his right place. For my part, I always thought his poetry detest=
able, and I think I know=20

something about poetry."  "Who is this officer," inquired Raoul of Athos, "=
who is speaking?"=20

"Monsieur de Scudery, the author of 'Clelie,' and of 'Le Grand Cyrus,' whic=
h were composed partly=20

by him and partly by his sister, who is now talking to that pretty person y=
onder, near Monsieur=20

Scarron."  Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived. One was perfectly c=
harming, delicate,=20

pensive, shaded by beautiful dark hair, and eyes soft as velvet, like those=
 lovely flowers, the=20

heartsease, in which shine out the golden petals. The other, of mature age,=
 seemed to have the=20

former one under her charge, and was cold, dry and yellow--the true type of=
 a duenna or a=20

devotee.  Raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the =
beautiful girl with the=20

soft eyes, who by a strange fancy, although she bore no resemblance, remind=
ed him of his poor=20

little Louise, whom he had left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom, in =
the midst of all the party,=20

he had never for one moment quite forgotten. Meantime Aramis had drawn near=
 to the coadjutor,=20

who, smiling all the while, contrived to drop some words into his ear. Aram=
is, notwithstanding his=20

self-control, could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise.  "Laugh=
, then," said Monsieur de=20

Retz; "they are looking at us." And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Mad=
ame de Chevreuse,=20

who was in the midst of a large group.  Aramis affected a laugh, to divert =
the attention of certain=20

curious listeners, and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the emb=
rasure of a window=20

and remained there, he proceeded to join him, throwing out a few words care=
lessly as he moved=20

through the room.  As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation=
 which was=20

emphasized by frequent gesticulation.  Raoul then approached them as Athos =
had directed him to=20

do.  "'Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur l'abbe is repeating =
to me." said Athos in a=20

loud voice, "and I confess I think it incomparable."  Raoul stayed only a f=
ew minutes near them=20

and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevreuse.  "Well, then?" a=
sked Athos, in a=20

low tone.  "It is to be to-morrow," said Aramis hastily.  "At what time?"  =
"Six o'clock."  "Where?"  "At=20

Saint Mande."  "Who told=20


_
which had its lamp, because the Sun placed as a candelabrum in the     midd=
le of other planets=20

distributes light to them.(601) ... As to     the cherubs having twelve win=
gs between the two, they=20

represent to     us the sensuous world in the twelve zodiacal signs.(602)  =
 And yet, in the face of all=20

this evidence, sun, moon, planets, all are shown as being demoniacal before=
, and divine only=20

after, the appearance of Christ. All know the Orphic verse: "It is Zeus, it=
 is Adas, it is the Sun, it is=20

Bacchus," these names having been all synonymous for classic poets and writ=
ers. Thus for=20

Democritus "Deity is but a soul in an orbicular fire," and that fire is the=
 Sun. For Iamblichus the sun=20

was "the image of divine intelligence"; for Plato "an immortal living Being=
." Hence the oracle of=20

Claros when asked to say who was the Jehovah of the Jews, answered, "It is =
the Sun." We may=20

add the words in _Psalm_ xix. 4       In the sun hath he placed a tabernacl=
e for himself(603) ... his=20

going forth is from the end  "The Count de Rochefort."  Some one drew near.=
  "And then=20

philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voiture's works, but I am of the sa=
me opinion as the=20

coadjutor--he is a poet, a true poet." Aramis spoke so as to be heard by ev=
erybody.  "And I, too,"=20

murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes. "I have the misfortune also t=
o admire his poetry=20

exceedingly."  "Monsieur Scarron, do me the honor," said Raoul, blushing, "=
to tell me the name of=20

that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the=
 company."  "Ah! my=20

young vicomte," replied Scarron, "I suppose you wish to propose to her an a=
lliance offensive and=20

defensive."  Raoul blushed again.  "You asked the name of that young lady. =
She is called the fair=20

Indian."  "Excuse me, sir," returned Raoul, blushing still more deeply, "I =
know no more than I did=20

before. Alas! I am from the country."  "Which means that you know very litt=
le about the nonsense=20

which here flows down our streets. So much the better, young man! so much t=
he better!=20


_
the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.   Jehovah t=
hen is the sun, and thence=20

also the Christ of the Roman Church. And now the criticism of Dupuis on tha=
t verse becomes=20

comprehensible, as also the despair of the Abbe Foucher. "Nothing is more f=
avourable to=20

Sabaeism than this text of the Vulgate!" he exclaims. And, however disfigur=
ed may be the words=20

and sense in the English authorised bible, the Vulgate and the Septuagint b=
oth give the correct=20

text of the  "You forgive me, then, sir," said Raoul, "and you will deign t=
o tell me who is the person=20

that you call the young Indian?"  "Certainly; one of the most charming pers=
ons that lives--

Mademoiselle Frances d'Aubigne."  "Does she belong to the family of the cel=
ebrated Agrippa, the=20

friend of Henry IV.?"  "His granddaughter. She comes from Martinique, so I =
call her the beautiful=20

Indian."  Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady, =
who smiled.  The=20

company went on speaking of=20


_
translate the latter: "In the sun he established his abode"; while the Vulg=
ate regards the "heat" as=20

coming direct from God and not from the sun alone, since it is God who issu=
es forth from, and=20

dwells in the sun and performs the circuit: _in sole posuit ... et ipse exu=
ltavit_. From these facts it=20

will be seen  "Monsieur," said Mademoiselle d'Aubigne to Scarron, as if she=
 wished to join in the=20

conversation he was engaged in with Raoul, "do you not admire Monsieur Voit=
ure's friends? Listen=20

how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him; one takes away fro=
m him all claim to good=20

sense, another robs him of his=20


_
Justin with saying that       God has permitted us to worship the sun.   An=
d this, notwithstanding the=20

lame excuses that what was really meant was that       God permitted himsel=
f to be worshipped in,=20

or within, the sun,   which is all the same.  It will be seen from the abov=
e, that while the Pagans=20

located in the sun and planets only the another of his humor, another of hi=
s independence of=20

character, a sixth--but, good heavens! what will they leave him? as Mademoi=
selle de Scudery=20

remarks."  Scarron and Raoul laughed. The fair Indian, astonished at the se=
nsation her=20

observation produced, looked down and resumed her air of naivete.  Athos, s=
till within the=20

inclosure of the=20
