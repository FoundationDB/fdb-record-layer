or Pickens the _
eloquence or any of the attributes that catch the multitude, give to his ar=
t a touch of coldness that=20

is not without its charm for those who care for a highly developed orderly =
product of the mind.=20

Most of the Berlin men who are in any degree notable share somewhat in this=
 attribute. Arthur=20

Kampf, although he has less than Liebermann of cool detachment, has both el=
egance and gravity.=20

He could hardly have had a better representation by any one or two canvases=
 than by the=20

"Charity" and the "Two Sisters" of the American exhibition. In the first he=
 depicts a street scene=20

with its contrasts of poverty and wealth. A man and woman in evening dress,=
 returning from their=20

evening's pleasure, are besought by poor people clustering around a soup st=
all and drop coin into=20

the insistent hands. The smoking caldron of soup in the center and the circ=
le of sharply=20

differentiated faces form an admirable composition, the apparently accident=
al lines of which play=20

into a dignified linear scheme. The "Two Sisters" reveals the influence of =
Velasquez in its flat=20

modeling and subtle characterization, and in its atmospheric grays enlivene=
d with geranium reds.=20

Both of these pictures indicate a modern temper of mind in the fluency of t=
heir technique and the=20

realism of their treatment together with the attention paid to the tonal qu=
ality and to the character=20

of the space composition. Kampf, however, although a young man--he was born=
 in 1864--has=20

passed through many phases of development which are recorded in his many-si=
ded art. His=20

subjects range from the historical themes of his wall decorations at Magdeb=
urg and Aachen=20

through portraiture in which he grasps characters essentially diverse and s=
uggests with unerring=20

instinct the dominant quality, scenes of labor as in his "Bridge-Building,"=
 scenes of brutality and=20

excitement as in his "Bull-fight," scenes from the drama of the Biblical st=
ory, scenes of domestic=20

life as in his delicately humorous picture of the absorbed reader eating hi=
s breakfast with the=20

morning paper propped up in front of him, and scenes of peaceful holiday-ma=
king among the poor=20

as in his idyllic "Sunday Afternoon" which shows a peasant boy playing his =
harmonicum under the=20

trees, with his old father and mother sitting by in placid enjoyment. Vario=
us as these pictures are=20

and closely as the manner has in each case been adapted to the special subj=
ect, on Buell=E2=80=99s own=20

motion, and with the thought that Anderson should have written evidence, we=
re reduced,=20

December 11th, to writing. This memorandum is of such importance that it mu=
st be given in full.=20

=E2=80=9CYou are aware of the great anxiety of the Secretary of War that a =
collision of the troops with the=20

people of this state shall be avoided, and of his studied determination to =
pursue a course with=20

reference to the military force and forts in this harbor which shall guard =
against such a collision. He=20

has therefore carefully abstained from increasing the force at this point, =
or taking any measures=20

which might add to the present excited state of the public mind, or which w=
ould throw any doubt on=20

the confidence he feels that South Carolina will not attempt, by violence, =
to obtain possession of=20

the public works or interfere with their occupancy. But as the counsels and=
 acts of rash and=20

impulsive persons may possibly disappoint those expectations of the governm=
ent, he deems it=20

proper that you should be prepared with instructions to meet so unhappy a c=
ontingency. He has=20

therefore directed me verbally to give you such instructions. You are caref=
ully to avoid every act=20

which would needlessly tend to provoke aggression; and for that reason you =
are not without=20

evident and imminent necessity to take up any position which could be const=
rued in the=20

assumption of a hostile attitude. But you are to hold possession of the for=
ts in the harbor, and if=20

attacked you are to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of=
 your force will not=20

permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an att=
ack on, or attempt to=20



take possession of, any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility=
, and you may then put=20

your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase=
 its power of=20

resistance. You are also authorized to take similar steps whenever you have=
 tangible evidence of=20

a design to proceed to a hostile act.=E2=80=9D[156]  These instructions did=
 not come to the President=E2=80=99s=20

knowledge until December 21st, though a despatch from Washington, December =
13th, published=20

in the _Charleston Courier_, announced Major Buell=E2=80=99s visit; when ma=
de known to the President, he=20

directed them to be modified, ordering that if =E2=80=9Cattacked by a force=
 so superior that resistance=20

would, in your judgment, be a useless waste of life, it will be your duty=
=20


_
in such a portrait as that of the Kaiser, which was shown in America, it un=
questionably is subdued.=20

Neither do we miss the note of locality. Born at Aachen, Kampf is a true Rh=
einlander and one of=20

his German critics notes that we must look to this fact for the explanation=
 of his special qualities,=20

declaring that without the Rheinlander's cheerfulness and energetic tempera=
ment, and without the=20

background of the ancient Rhenish culture, he would be inconceivable. On th=
e other hand his=20

turning to drama and romance for his inspiration speaks of his Duesseldorfi=
an training and his=20

realism of representation allies him to Menzel. At forty-two he was made pr=
esident of the Royal=20

Academy of Art in Berlin, and it is probable that the wholesome Rhenish ene=
rgy of which his critic=20

speaks will save him from sinking into the formalism of the academic tradit=
ion.  In his art, however,=20

as in that of his compatriots, it is apparent that the world of ideas is th=
e world in which he lives,=20

and he works to  December 3d, Anderson placed Lieutenant Jefferson C. Davis=
 with thirty men in=20

Castle Pinckney, and began work there. Action upon a request for arms for t=

of November 1st, for forty muskets, should be complied with, which was done=

ould be removed.=20

Foster declined to return the arms, stating that he knew nothing of Huger=
=E2=80=99s pledge, but was willing=20

to refer the matter to Washington. Trescot was informed by telegraph=20
