dracaena marginata herself. She was handling the dinner-plates in a rather clumsy manner, and, after the fashion of a discontented little girl, was sighing over her work, and not doing it properly.  "Oh, let me help you!"  "Oh, Mr. McGowan! Is it--do you think----Oh! I can't say it! It's too awful!"  "We must telephone for the doctor at once. It may be serious."  "Then, you do think it's a stroke! What shall we do!"  Mr. dracaena marginata herself.

she could never forget the real object for which they had come.  Daisy, when she had become 

reconciled to the smuts and disagreeables, and the slights to which the Pink was exposed all day 

long in Penelope Mansion, began to enjoy life in a serene but unqualified manner. Each of the girls 

had her own particular tastes; and these they were by no means slow to express to one another. 

Primrose, who intended to study china painting--to make it, in short, a profession--liked to stand 

opposite some large shop in Oxford Street, and to study and try to carry away in her mind's eye 

the shape and beauty of the many lovely things displayed in the windows.  Jasmine, who during 

the first few days had quite made up her mind not to worry at all about the future, did not much 

care for these gazing fits of Primrose's. She wanted to get into the parks. She exclaimed in 

ecstasy over the horses, and those picture-galleries which were free to the public quite enchanted 

her. Daisy frankly admitted that she liked toy-shops, and of all toy-shops those which displayed 

rows of dolls in their windows the best. Primrose had decided that the three should have one 

week's holiday, and it was during this week that they began to make a certain first acquaintance 

with London. "It is the heart of the world," Jasmine was heard to say. "Primrose, it is what we 

pictured it; in many ways it is even greater than what we pictured it. Oh, don't your cheeks glow, 

and don't you feel that your eyes are shining when you look down Oxford Street? Yes, it is lovely 

and grand, and I think we ought to show poor dear Poppy some more of its delights."  Primrose 

was only too glad to give Poppy all the happiness in her power, and she and Jasmine later 

released and exonerated. They'd arrest a man over there for looking at his own watch if he 

happened to cross his eyes while doing it. At the time when my client was in trouble the convict-

ships were in business."  The Elder dropped back from the edge of his chair which he had held 

since the beginning of the conversation. He gave his son a look of dumb appeal. With an effort he 

straightened and glared vacantly across the table.  "I was aboard the convict-ship _Success_ 

while she was in the New York harbor this spring," commented the minister. "I don't see how 

civilized men could think out so many different modes of torture and remain civilized, let alone 

human."  "Nor I. I was aboard the old tub, too. That was the ship my client was on. It was when 

she first came out."  The Elder was acting queerly.  "Dad, what's wrong?" asked Harold, with 

concern.  "Nothing,--er--nothing. Only I do wish you would not take this trip. Can't you send some 

one else?"  "I'm afraid not. You see, I'm not my own boss. No, Dad, I can't get out of it."  Harold 

had never seen his father so concerned for his welfare, and it greatly affected him.  "They won't 

trouble me, not in the least. To ease your mind I'll go under an assumed name, if you say so. But I 

must get my data at the source concerning this man Adoniah Phillips, if----"  The Elder was sipping 

his coffee, and his cup fell into the saucer with a crash, breaking both fragile pieces into 

fragments. The contents were sprayed over the linen, and drops stained the Elder's white 

waistcoat.  "Father!" cried Elizabeth. "What is the matter? You are ill!"  He did not answer. He 

turned an ashen face toward Mr. McGowan, and with a wild stare studied that young man's face.

girl out with them on another expedition before they settled down finally to the great work of their 

lives.  "We'll spend five shillings," said Primrose, "we must not on any account spend more, but we 

will be extravagant, and give poor Poppy a real treat with one crown piece."  "We had better ask 

her to come to-morrow," said Daisy; "five shillings seems a lot of money. Do you think there old 

man's assistance, but as the minister reached out his hand Mr. Fox gave a startled cry and threw 

up his arm as though to ward off a blow.  "Go back to your seats!" ordered the Elder thickly. "Do 

not mind me. I'm all right, or shall be in a few seconds."  He fought helplessly for self-control. 

"Come, Dad, you must go to your room," declared Harold, taking his father tightly by the arm. 


_
Primrose, to buy me a tiny, tiny little doll?"  Primrose kissed Daisy, and said she would try 

somehow to manage the doll, and Jasmine was elected to go downstairs and sound Poppy on the 

subject of the morrow's treat.  The little maiden had made herself pretty well at home in the 

Mansion by this time, and she soon discovered Poppy in what was called the back scullery. The 

ladies had all finished their mid-day meal, and were out. Even Mrs. Flint had sallied forth to a 

distant market to secure some cheap provisions, and Poppy had the back "I'm not ill, sir," 

answered the father, stubbornly. "But it might be as well for me to retire from the table. You need 

not trouble, Mr. McGowan. I shall get on quite well with my son's assistance," he affirmed, waving 

the minister back.  Mr. Fox drew his handkerchief across his perspiring forehead, and dazedly 

eyed the stained cloth. "I'm sorry, Beth, very sorry I was so awkward."  "Don't mind the cloth, 

Father," begged the girl tearfully.  "You remain with Mr. McGowan, Beth. I shall soon be quite 

myself. Fainting spell, I guess."  Harold
