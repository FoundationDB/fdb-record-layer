the case of the smaller, we employ the proportion that belong to the larger, both tablina and alae 

must be unserviceable, while if, in the case of the larger, we employ the proportions of the smaller, 

the rooms mentioned will be huge monstrosities. Hence, I have thought it best to describe exactly 

their respective proportionate sizes, with a view both to convenience and to beauty.  [Illustration:

courage enough to act according to my conscience.  Unfortunately, I am not a philosopher and not 

a theologian. I know perfectly well that I cannot live more than another six months; it might be 

supposed that I ought now to be chiefly concerned with the question of the shadowy life beyond 

the grave, and the visions that will visit my slumbers in the tomb. But for some reason my soul 

refuses to recognize these questions, though my mind is fully alive to their importance. Just as

than its width. Its ceiling should exceed this height by one third of the width. The fauces in the 

case of smaller atriums should be two thirds, and in the case of larger one half the width of the 

tablinum. Let the busts of ancestors with their ornaments be set up at a height corresponding to 

the width of the alae. The proportionate width and height of doors may be settled, if they are Doric, 

in the Doric manner, and if Ionic, in the Ionic manner, according to the rules of symmetry which 

have interested in nothing but science. As I yield up my last breath I shall still believe that science 

is the most important, the most splendid, the most essential thing in the life of man; that it always 

has been and will be the highest manifestation of love, and that only by means of it will man 

conquer himself and nature. This faith is perhaps naive and may rest on false assumptions, but it 

is not my fault that I believe that and nothing else; I cannot overcome in myself this belief.  But that

roof-opening let an aperture be left with a breadth of not less than one fourth nor more than one 

third the width of the atrium, and with a length proportionate to that of the atrium.  [Illustration:

Peristyles, lying athwart, should be one third longer than they are deep, and their columns as high 

as the colonnades are wide. Intercolumniations of peristyles should be not less than three nor 

more than four times the thickness of the columns. If the columns of the peristyle are to be made 

in the Doric style, take the modules which I have given in the fourth book, on the Doric order, and 

arrange the columns with reference to these modules and to the scheme of the triglyphs. 

[Illustration: _From Durm_  PLAN OF THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII, POMPEII]  8. Dining rooms 

ought to be twice as long as they are wide. The height of all oblong rooms should be calculated by 

adding together their measured length and width, taking one half of this total, and using the result 

for the height. But in the case of exedrae or square oeci, let the height be brought up to one and 

one half times the width. Picture galleries, like exedrae, should be constructed of generous 

dimensions. Corinthian and tetrastyle oeci, as well as those termed Egyptian, should have the 

same symmetrical proportions in width and length as the dining rooms described above, but, since 

they have columns in them, their dimensions should be ampler.  9. The following will be the 

distinction between Corinthian and Egyptian oeci: the Corinthian have single tiers of columns, set 

either on a podium or on the weakness, and to realize that to tear from the lecture-theatre and his 

pupils a man who is more interested in the history of the development of the bone medulla than in 

the final object of creation would be equivalent to taking him and nailing him up in his coffin without 

waiting for him to be dead.  Sleeplessness and the consequent strain of combating increasing 

weakness leads to something strange in me. In the middle of my lecture tears suddenly rise in my 

throat, my eyes begin to smart, and I feel a passionate, hysterical desire to stretch out my hands 

before me and break into loud lamentation. I want to cry out in a loud voice that I, a famous man, 

have been sentenced by fate to the death penalty, that within some six months another man will 

be in control here in the lecture-theatre. I want to shriek that I am poisoned; new ideas such as I 

have not known before have poisoned the last days of my life, and are still stinging my brain like 

mosquitoes. And at that moment my position seems to me so awful that I want all my listeners to 

be horrified, to leap up from their seats and to rush in panic terror, with desperate screams, to the 

exit.  It is not easy to get through such moments.  II  After my lecture I sit at home and work. I read 

journals and monographs, or prepare my next lecture; sometimes I write something. I work with 

interruptions, as I have from time to time to see visitors.  There is a ring at the bell. It is a colleague 

come to discuss some business matter with me. He comes in to me with his hat and his stick, and, 

holding out both these objects to me, says:  "Only for a minute! Only for a minute! Sit

of woodwork or of stucco, and carved vaulted ceilings above the coronae. In the Egyptian there 

are architraves over the columns, and joists laid thereon from the architraves to the surrounding 

walls, with a floor in the upper story to allow of walking round under the open sky. Then, above the 

architrave and perpendicularly over the lower tier of columns, columns one fourth smaller should 

be imposed. Above their architraves and ornaments are decorated ceilings, and the upper 

columns have windows set in between them. Thus the Egyptian are not like Corinthian dining 

rooms, but obviously resemble basilicas.  10. There are also, though couple of words."  To begin 

with, we both try to show each other that we are extraordinarily polite and highly delighted to see 

each other. I make him sit down in an easy-chair, and he makes me sit down; as we do so, we 

cautiously pat each other on the back, touch each other's buttons, and it looks as though we were 

feeling each other and afraid of scorching our fingers. Both of us laugh, though we say nothing 

amusing. When we are seated we bow our heads towards each other and begin talking in 

subdued voices. However affectionately disposed we may be to one another, we cannot help 

adorning our conversation with all sorts of Chinese

Greeks call Cyzicene. These are built with a northern exposure and generally command a view of 

gardens, and have folding doors in the middle. They are also so long and so wide that two sets of 

dining couches, facing each other, with room to pass round them, can be placed therein. On the 

right and left they have windows which open like folding doors, so that views of the garden may be 

had from the dining couches through the opened already had the honour to inform you"; we 

cannot help laughing if one of us makes a joke, however unsuccessfully. When we have finished 

with business my colleague gets up impulsively and, waving his hat in the direction of my work, 

begins to say good-bye. Again we paw one another and laugh. I see him into the hall; when I 

assist my colleague to put on his coat, while he does all he can to decline this high honour. Then

times their width.  11. All the above-mentioned symmetrical relations should be observed, in these 

kinds of buildings, that can be observed without embarrassment caused by the situation. The 

windows will be an easy matter to arrange if they are not darkened by high walls; but in cases of 

confined space, or when there are other unavoidable obstructions, it will be permissible to make 

while I make a show of being ready to go even into the street with him. And when at last I go back 

into my study my face still goes on smiling, I suppose from inertia.  A little later another ring at the 

bell. Somebody comes into the hall, and is a long time coughing and taking off his things. Yegor 

announces a student. I tell him to ask him in. A minute later a young man of
