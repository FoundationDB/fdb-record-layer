you that it isn't worth while to hold me at arm's-length, Senator," McVicka=

clipped the end from his cigar. "You know as well as I do that under the pr=
esent law in this State=20

we are practically bankrupt. We are not making enough to pay the fixed char=
ges. We do a losing=20

business from the moment we cross your State line."  "Yes; it seems to me I=
 have heard=20

something that sounded a good deal like that before," was the noncommittal =
rejoinder.  "You have=20

heard the simple truth, then. And it is a bald injustice, not only to the r=
ailroad company, but to the=20

people it serves. We can't give adequate service when the cost exceeds the =
earnings. That is the=20

simplest possible proposition in any business undertaking."  "And nap in th=

ptain, after he had=20

looked attentively into the fog astern for some time. "We may not see her a=
gain."  "Perhaps not,=20

sir; but she's a bad penny, and she is likely to turn up again," replied th=

will not weep, sir, if you don't see her again."  "I should like to know wh=
at had become of her if we=20

the half-angry retort.  "Yet you are still running your railroad," suggeste=

worn story with us, McVickar," said the listener quietly. "I'm sure you did=

reply.  "So do the charge of the sail at the same time. Morris was the youn=
