philodendron monstera  The boys hesitated a moment. It was a hazardous plan, one fraught with danger, but they were not the lads to draw back for that.

Do you step aside and say: "I'm not ready yet. I want a little more time to prepare, to turn the matter over in my mind?"

could discover nothing.  Jack, Nat, Sam, Bony and Will started off early the next morning on 

snowshoes for the top of the mountain, in accordance with a plan Jack had formed of trying to 

reach the camp of the men from a point directly back of the place whence they had been ordered 

away.  They reached the summit of the mountain and found, as Long Gun had said they would, a 

trail leading directly down. But it was so steep and so covered with snow that it seemed risky to 

attempt it.  "We can never get down there," said Nat.  "Sure we can," declared Jack.  "We might if 

we had some of those long, wooden snowshoes, like barrel-staves, which the Norwegians use," 

spoke Sam. "Otherwise I don't see how we're going to do it."  Jack did not reply. Instead he was 

walking slowly along what seemed to be an abandoned trail. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation. 

"The very thing!" he cried.  "What?" asked Bony.  "That old sled," answered Jack, pointing to a sort 

of accepted His sacrifice. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. 

We are righteous in God's sight because the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus 

Christ is unto all and upon all them that believe.  If we had to live forever with our sins in the 

handwriting of God on the wall, it would be hell on earth. But thank God for the gospel we preach! 

If we repent, our sins will all be blotted out. "You, being dead in your sins, hath He quickened 

together with Him, having forgiven you all your trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of 

ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to 

His cross."  LOVE THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW.  If the love of God is shed abroad in your 

heart, you will be able to fulfil the law. Paul reduced the commandments to one: "Love is the 

fulfilling of the law." Some one has written the following:     "Love to God will admit no other God.

evidently been made by lumbermen. It consisted of a platform of slabs, on long, broad, wooden 

runners, and stood near an abandoned camp.  "How can we use that?" asked Nat.  "Get on it and 

slide down the mountain," daringly proposed Jack. "There's plenty of snow. The old sled will hold 

us all, and maybe we can ride right into their camp lickity-split. Then they can't put us out until 

we've seen what's going on. by an image.    Love to God will never dishonor His name.    Love to 

God will reverence His day.    Love to parents makes one honor them.    Hate, not love, is a 

murderer.    Lust, not love, commits adultery.    Love will give, but never steal.    Love will not 

slander or lie.    Love's eye is not covetous."  ARE YOU READY?  It is the height of madness to 

turn away and run the risk of being called by God to
