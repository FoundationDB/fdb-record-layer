trades, and from "narrowing their limits to earn a livelihood." Douglass de=
plored the fact that even=20

menial employments were rapidly passing away from the colored people. Under=
 the caption of=20

"Learn Trades or Starve," he tried to drive home the truth that if the free=
 people  =E2=80=9CI am so glad I=20

have found you, Prince Ivan,=E2=80=9D said the boy breathlessly. =E2=80=9CM=
y grandfather thought you would like to=20

see the benediction of the Czar with the holy picture. His friend, Pope Yef=
im, is to take part in the=20

ceremony, and he says he can secure you a good place.=E2=80=9D=20


_
immigrating in large numbers would elbow them from all lucrative positions.=
 In his own words,=20

"every day begins with the lesson and ends with the lesson that colored men=
 must find new=20

employments, new modes of usefulness to society, or that they must decay un=
der the pressing=20

wants to which their condition is bringing them."[1]  [Footnote 1: Douglass=
, _The Life and Times=20

of_, p. 248.]  Douglass believed in higher education and looked forward to =
that stage in the=20

development of the Negroes when high schools and colleges could contribute =
to their progress.=20

He knew, Ivan gladly accepted the offer; and in the short conversation that=
 followed, the=20

merchant=E2=80=99s son was able to contribute materially to the information=
 of his social superiors.  =E2=80=9CPope=20

Yefim has seen a copy of the letter which the Patriarch wrote to the Czar,=
=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CHe was not=20

able to come himself--for you know, gentlemen, he is nearly a hundred years=
 old, much older than=20

my grandfather--but he writes that it grieves him to the heart he cannot se=
e the face of his=20

sovereign--that face which is to him =E2=80=98as the face of Christ.=E2=80=
=99=E2=80=9D  Neither speaker nor hearers were=20

startled by=20


_
to think that persons accustomed to the rougher and harder modes of living =
could in a single leap=20

from their low condition reach that of professional men. The attainment of =
such positions, he=20

thought, was contingent upon laying a foundation in things material by pass=
ing "through the=20

intermediate gradations of agriculture and the mechanic arts."[1] He was su=
re that the higher=20

institutions then open to the colored people would be adequate to the task =
of providing for them all=20

the professional men they then needed, and that the facilities for higher e=
ducation so far as the=20

schools and colleges in seems to border on the profane. But the profanity w=
as unintentional, and=20

the passionate loyalty utterly sincere.  Feodor went on--=E2=80=9CHe has se=
nt him the sacred picture of St.=20

Sergius, from the Troitza monastery. You know, gentlemen, that is the pictu=
re which the Czar=20

Alexis and the great Czar Peter carried into battle, and it always gave the=
m the victory. Though,=20

my grandfather says, it is not the holy picture that gives the victory, or =
even the holy saint, but God=20

himself.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThy grandfather seems to be a wise man,=E2=80=
