 the institution had=20

incurred while passing through the crisis, Rev. Daniel A. Payne and his ass=
ociates secured the=20

transfer of the property to the African Methodist Episcopal Church. These n=
ew directors hoped to=20

develop a first-class university, offering courses in law, medicine, litera=
ture, and theology. The=20

debt being speedily removed the school showed evidences of new vigor, but w=
as checked in its=20

progress by an incendiary, who burned the main building while the teachers =
and pupils were=20

attending an emancipation celebration at Xenia, April 14, 1865. With the am=
ount of insurance=20

received and donations from friends, the trustees were able to construct a =
more commodious=20

building which still marks the site of these early labors.[4]  [Footnote 1:=

vol. ii., p. 113.]  A=20

brighter day for the higher education of the colored people at home, howeve=
r, had begun to dawn=20

during the forties. The abolitionists were then aggressively demanding cons=
ideration for the=20

Negroes. Men "condescended" to reason together about slavery and the treatm=
ent of the colored=20

people. The northern people ceased to think that they had nothing to do wit=
h these problems.=20

When these questions were openly discussed in the schools of the North, stu=
dents and teachers=20

gradually became converted to the doctrine of equality in education. This r=
evolution was instituted=20

by President C.B. Storrs, of Western Reserve College, then at Hudson, Ohio.=
 His doctrine in=20

regard to the training of the mind "was that men are able to be made only b=
y putting youth under=20

the responsibilities of men." He, therefore, encouraged the free liberally:=
 in many families, even of=20

the highest position, good silver roubles were not as plentiful as they wer=
e desirable, and were not=20

likely to be rejected when they presented themselves for acceptance.  Feodo=
r was deputed to=20

accompany Ivan to his new home, since the elder members of the family did n=
ot care to present=20

themselves. It must be owned that the little Russian, in his glossy blue ca=
ftan of the finest cloth=20

and his bright silken sash, had the advantage of his companion, who looked =
as awkward as a=20

naturally graceful boy could contrive to do with his limbs confined in the =
tightest of French=20

garments.  Having reached the stately painted gateway of the Wertsch family=
 mansion or palace,=20

the two boys were admitted by the porter and led across an ample courtyard =
into a large saloon=20

furnished in a manner utterly strange to Ivan. As no one was there, he had =
time to indulge his=20

wonder and curiosity. Chairs and tables, divans and ottomans, with many oth=
er objects, of the=20

uses of which he had not the slightest conception, were scattered about in =
profusion; the=20

woodwork was painted rose-colour or lilac, and lavishly adorned with gildin=
g, while the numerous=20

cushions were covered with a kind of tapestry of a shining gray. At one sid=
e of the room a row of=20

slender shafts, rose-coloured and tipped with gold, supported climbing-plan=
ts in luxuriant flower; at=20

the other, three large windows looked out upon the terrace and the pleasure=
-grounds beyond it.=20

Ivan thought these windows were open, and was stepping confidently towards =
one of them, when=20

Feodor pulled him back with a laugh. =E2=80=9CTake care, Prince Ivan,=E2=80=
=9D he said; =E2=80=9Cthat is one great sheet of=20

glass. I have seen such before; they cost--oh, I know not how many roubles.=
 But come, let us look=20

at the orangery;=E2=80=9D and he pointed to a trellised door at the farther=
 end of the room.  Here a fairy=20

scene met their view. Oranges gleamed amidst dark glossy foliage like =E2=
=80=9Cgolden lamps hid in a=20

night of=20


_
discussion of all important subjects, among which was the appeal of the Neg=
roes for=20

enlightenment. This policy gave rise to a spirit of inquiry which permeated=
 the whole school. The=20

victory, however, was not easy. After a long struggle the mind of the colle=
ge was carried by=20

irresistible argument in favor of fair play for colored youth. This institu=
tion had two colored students=20

as early as 1834.[1]  [Footnote 1: _First Annual Report of the American Ant=
i-Slavery Society_, p.=20

42.]  Northern institutions of learning were then reaching the third stage =
in their participation in the=20

solution of the Negro problem. At first they had to be converted even to al=
low a free discussion of=20

the question; next the students on being convinced that slavery was a sin, =
sought to elevate the=20

blacks thus degraded; and finally these workers, who had been accustomed to=
 instructing the=20

neighboring colored people, reached the conclusion that they should be admi=
tted to their schools=20

on equal footing with the whites. Geneva College, then at Northfield, Ohio,=
 now at Beaver Falls,=20

Pennsylvania, was being moved in this manner.[1]  [Footnote 1: _First Annua=
l Report of the=20

American Anti-slavery Society_, 1834. p. 43.]  Lane Seminary, however, is t=
he best example of a=20

school which passed through the three stages of this revolution. This insti=
tution was peculiar in=20

that the idea of establishing it originated with a southerner, a merchant o=
f New Orleans. It was=20

founded largely by funds of southern Presbyterians, was located in Cincinna=
ti about a mile from=20

slave territory, and was attended by students from that section.[1] When th=
e right of free=20

discussion swept the country many of the proslavery students were converted=
 to abolition. To=20

southerners it seemed that the seminary had resolved itself of grapes, purp=
le and amber, hung=20

high above their heads; peaches, apricots, and plums ripened temptingly bes=
ide them--for in that=20

ungenial climate many fruits that grow elsewhere in the open air require th=
e protection of glass.=20

Wonderful was the wealth of flowers, all of which were new to Ivan. Sheets =
of blossom--gold, and=20

purple, and scarlet, azure, and creamy white--wooed his delighted gaze; and=
 ever and anon he=20

paused as some rare peculiar beauty, rose or lily, geranium or costly orchi=
d, attracted his eye with=20

the richness of its colouring or the grace of its form.  But this was not t=
he first =E2=80=9Corangery=E2=80=9D (all=20

greenhouses were then called orangeries in Russia) which Feodor had seen, a=
nd he had no=20

objection to show off his larger experiences before his senior and his supe=
rior in rank. He could=20

even name to him a few of the flowers. =E2=80=9CLook here,=E2=80=9D he said=
, as he paused before a plant laden=20

with clusters of graceful bells, their dark crimson sheaths half concealing=
 cups of white faintly=20

tinged with rose-colour; =E2=80=9Cthat is called fuchsia. There is one of t=
he same kind in the Kremlin=20

gardens. Last winter=E2=80=99s frost nearly killed it; but it lives still--=
a thick, stunted, hardy bush, with little=20

red flowers, as unlike as possible to this one. That is like me, and this o=
ne before us is like you,=20

Prince Ivan. You are going to be put in the orangery, because you were born=
 a boyar; while I am=20

left outside in the frost and snow. After all, I had rather be myself than =
you. It is hot here in the=20

orangery, and there is not room enough--one could not run or play in comfor=
t.=E2=80=9D  He was about to=20

try the experiment by indulging in a race from one end of the tiled passage=
 to the other, when a=20

strange figure was seen approaching them. It was that of a young lad with f=
lat, ugly Tartar=20


_
elevation of the free blacks. Students established Sabbath-schools, organiz=
ed Bible classes, and=20

provided lectures for Negroes ambitious to do advanced work. Measures were =
taken to establish=20

an academy for colored girls, and a teacher was engaged. But these noble ef=
forts put forth so near=20

the border States soon provoked firm opposition from the proslavery element=
. Some of the=20

students had gone so far in the manifestation of their zeal that the instit=
ution was embarrassed by=20

the charge of promoting the social equality of the races.[2] Rather than re=
main in Cincinnati under=20

restrictions, the reform element of the institution moved to the more conge=
nial Western Reserve=20

where a nucleus of youth and their instructors had assumed the name of Ober=
lin College. This=20

school did so much for the education of Negroes before the Civil War that i=
t was often spoken of=20

as an institution for the education of the people of color.  [Footnote 1: _=
Ibid_., p. 43.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_First Annual Report of the American Anti-Slavery Society_, p. 43.]  Intere=
st in the higher=20

education of the neglected race, however, was not confined to a particular =
commonwealth.=20

Institutions of other States were directing their attention to this task. A=
mong others were a school=20

in New York City founded by a clergyman to offer Negroes an opportunity to =
study the classics,[1]=20

New York Central College at McGrawville, Oneida Institute conducted by Beri=
ah Green at=20

Whitesboro, Thetford Academy of Vermont, and Union Literary Institute in th=
e center of the=20

communities of freedmen transplanted to Indiana. Many other of our best ins=
titutions were opening=20

their doors to students of African descent. By 1852 colored students had at=
tended the Institute at=20

Easton, Pennsylvania; the Normal School of Albany, New York; Bowdoin Colleg=
e, Brunswick,=20

Maine; Rutland College, Vermont; Jefferson College, Pennsylvania; Athens Co=
llege, Athens, Ohio;=20

Franklin College, New Athens, Ohio; and Hanover College near Madison, India=
na. Negroes had=20

taken courses at the Medical School of the University of New York; the Cast=
leton Medical School=20

in Vermont; the Berkshire Medical School, Pittsfield, Massachusetts; the Ru=
sh Medical School in=20

Chicago; the Eclectic Medical School of Philadelphia; the Homeopathic whom =
the Russian nobility=20

had a singular fancy for keeping in their houses as pets; although, as they=
 grew up, they often=20

proved very troublesome to their patrons. With a grin and a bow he informed=
 the boys that the=20

countess was ready to receive them, and invited them to follow him into her=
 presence. Having=20

passed once more through the saloon, they entered a boudoir richly furnishe=
d and adorned with=20

hangings of blue and silver. An elderly lady, dressed in exaggerated French=
 fashion, reclined on a=20

couch. Her appearance was not improved by two rows of teeth dyed an ebony h=
ue, a curious=20

Russian custom of the period. She played with a fan, which was rather usele=
ss in that climate,=20

while she conversed in French with two gentlemen in frock coats who sat nea=
r her. When Ivan=20

entered, she languidly extended her hand, glittering with jewelled rings, a=
nd addressed some=20

words to him in the same tongue. He looked embarrassed, but the ready Feodo=
r came to his aid.=20

=E2=80=9CPas Fran=C3=A7ais, madame,=E2=80=9D he said.  The Countess Wertsch=
 accordingly condescended to the use=20

of her native language, in which she bade Ivan welcome cordially enough. Sh=
e then gave him a=20

French _bonbonni=C3=A8re_, and told him to help himself and his companion t=
o its contents, while she=20

continued her conversation with her guests. Ivan could not help thinking, f=
rom the manner of the=20

speakers, that this conversation had reference to himself, and he was begin=
ning to grow hot and=20

uncomfortable, when Feodor effectually diverted his thoughts by taking out =
his pocket-knife and=20

cutting upon one of the bonbons--a large almond covered with chocolate--a s=
triking likeness of the=20

countess=E2=80=99s rather peculiar face. He was on the point of indulging i=
n a laugh which might have had=20



awkward consequences, when a young man, dressed _=C3=A0 la fran=C3=A7aise_,=
 and carrying in his hand a=20

long pipe tipped with amber, lounged into the room.  =E2=80=9CThis is Adria=
n, my eldest son,=E2=80=9D said the=20

countess, turning to Ivan. =E2=80=9CYou are to be fellow-students, so you o=
ught to be friends.--Adrian, this=20

is Prince Ivan Pojarsky.=E2=80=9D  Adrian made a bow, and addressing himsel=
f to Ivan, asked if he had=20

seen the new piece at the French theatre.  Ivan, who thought he meant a new=
 part of the building,=20

answered with simplicity, =E2=80=9CI do not know; everything I=20


_
Cleveland; and the Medical School of Harvard University. Colored preachers =
had been educated=20

in the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; the Dartmouth Theo=
logical School; and=20

the Theological Seminary of Charleston, South Carolina.[2]  [Footnote 1: Si=
mmons, _Men of=20

Mark_, p. 530.]  [Footnote 2: These facts are taken from M.R. Delany's _The=
 Condition, Elevation,=20

Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States Practica=
lly Considered_,=20

published in 1852; the _Reports of the Antislavery and Colonization Societi=
es_, and _The African=20

Repository_.]  Prominent among those who brought about this change in the a=
ttitude toward the=20

education of the free blacks was Gerrit Smith, one of the greatest philanth=
ropists of his time. He=20

secured privileges for Negroes in higher institutions by extending aid to s=
uch as would open their=20

doors to persons of color. In this way he became a patron of Oneida Institu=
te, giving it from $3,000=20

to $4,000 in cash and 3,000 acres of land in Vermont. Because of the hospit=
ality of Oberlin to=20

colored students he gave the institution  =E2=80=9CThen I shall have the pl=
easure of introducing you to a=20

great many things,=E2=80=9D said Adrian, with a smile, and, by way of a fur=
ther overture of friendship, he=20

took out and presented a jewelled snuff-box. Ivan supposed this to be anoth=
er kind of=20

_bonbonni=C3=A8re_; but fortunately for himself he was not attracted either=
 by the look or the odour of=20

its contents, and declined with thanks.  At length the older guests took th=
eir leave, and the=20

countess turned her attention to the boys. She seemed struck with the appea=
rance of Ivan=E2=80=99s little=20

companion, and asked him many questions, which he answered with a grace and=
 sprightliness=20

that interested her still further.  =E2=80=9CI should like to keep both of =
you,=E2=80=9D she said to Feodor. =E2=80=9CWill you=20

stay with me, and become my little page of honour? I will have you taught F=
rench, and you shall=20

be always with your friend Prince Ivan.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI thank you, mad=
ame,=E2=80=9D Feodor answered gravely. =E2=80=9CBut I=20

cannot leave my grandfather. I belong to him, and I will stay with him alwa=
ys--_always_,=E2=80=9D he=20

repeated with earnestness.  =E2=80=9CBut, my little lad, your grandfather i=
s very old. Some=20


_
20,000 acres of land in Virginia valued at $50,000. New York Central Colleg=
e which opened its=20

doors alike to both races obtained from him several donations.[1] This gent=
leman proceeded on=20

the presumption that it is the duty of the white people to elevate the colo=
red and that the education=20

of large numbers of them is indispensable to the uplift of the degraded cla=
sses.[2] He wanted die,=20

and then what will become of you?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhen he dies, I will d=
ie too,=E2=80=9D said Feodor resolutely, with a=20

glow in his dark eyes.  =E2=80=9CWait, boy, till you are ten years older,=
=E2=80=9D laughed Adrian, =E2=80=9Cand for no man in=20

the world will you say as much as that. As for a woman--well, I know not; y=
ou may have your=20

fever-fit like another, and get over it, and laugh at it.=E2=80=9D  Feodor =
gave him a=20
