dracaena marginata  Skinner was swept off his feet by her enthusiasm.  He t=

 neck, put her head on his shoulder, and looking up into his face, with eye=
s brimming with happiness, sighed, "Dearie, I'm so happy!  So happy for _yo=

Well, by jingo, he _would_ put her in a fool's paradise and let her revel i=
n it, for once in her life,=20

and before she had a chance to find out, he'd make it a _real_ paradise--he=
 did n't know just how,=20

but he would!  Skinner stepped off the train at Meadeville and threaded his=
 way between the=20

glaring, throbbing automobiles to the slush-covered sidewalk.  He no longer=
 felt his customary=20

resentment of these social pretenders that whizzed by him in their devil-wa=
gons--leaving him to=20

inhale the stench of their gasoline.  In a way, he was one of them now. By =
his ingenious little=20

scheme of circulating his own money, strictly in his own domestic circle, h=
e had elected himself to=20

the bluffer class, and he felt strangely light-hearted.  Besides, he was no=
 more of a "four-flush"=20

financier than most of the automobile contingent, at that.  When he again w=
as the same woman=20

watching, as we judged, for her friend Jeremiah. But he did not make his ap=
pearance, and after=20

remaining in the neighbourhood for nearly an hour, we saw the landlady put =
a card in her front=20

window, 'Rooms to let.' Across the road went the woman; she knocked at the =
door, made some=20

inquiries of the landlady, and came away with a spiteful, disappointed expr=
ession on her face. I=20

told Linton to follow her, and find out where she lived. Meanwhile I myself=
 went across to the=20

home, and inquired about the rooms to let. It was as I suspected: the Pamfl=
etts had left--'quite=20

sudden,' the landlady said. Putting this and that together, I came to the c=
onclusion that they had=20

left their lodgings, and most probably the neighbourhood, because of the di=
scovery by the woman=20

of their whereabouts. This looked so much like fright on=20

Honey was waiting for him at the door, her lithe little figure and mass of =
chestnut hair, done up on=20

top of her head, silhouetted against the light in the hall.  She kissed him=
, and in her eagerness=20

literally dragged him into the hall and shut the door.  "Dearie, you've don=
e it!  I know by your face=20

you've done it!"  "Eh-huh!"  "Now, don't tell me how much till I show you s=
omething!"  She drew=20

him into the dining-room and pointed to the table where a wonderful dinner =
was waiting.  "Look,=20

Dearie, oysters to begin with, and later--beefsteak!  Think of it!  Beefste=
ak!  And, look--those=20

flowers!  Just to celebrate the occasion!  I was so sure you'd get it! And,=
 now, Dearie, tell me--how=20

much did they appreciate the part of Jeremiah Pamflett that it stirred me u=
p and made me hopeful.=20

But where had he and his mother flown to? Sir, this very evening chance has=
 befriended us, and=20

we are again on the track. Give me, if you please, your closest attention; =
I am approaching=20

something rather startling."  "Stop a moment," said Garden, rising and goin=
g to the side-board,=20

from which he took a bottle of apollinaris and a bottle of brandy, "you see=
m rather faint."  "To tell=20

you the truth," said Kiss, "I have scarcely tasted food to-day, I have been=
 that anxious and=20

distressed."  "We are all engaged in the same good cause," said Garden, smi=
ling, "and every one,=20

with the exception of myself, seems bent upon starving himself. Take=20
