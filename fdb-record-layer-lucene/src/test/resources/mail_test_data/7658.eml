philodendron monstera in Northern Buddhism. For the latter, in His Higher S=
elf as Vajradhara (Dorjechang), is _never_ manifested, except to the seven =
Dhyan Chohans, the primeval Builders. Esoterically, it is the Spirit of the=
 "Seven" collectively, their seventh principle, or Atman. Exoterically, any=
 amount of fables may be found in _Kala Chakra_, the most important work in=
 the Gyut [or (D)gyu] division of the can always find a tree and a cord."  =
The monk's eye again flashed, but that was all; he merely repeated his phra=
se, "I will go,"--and he went.  "Let us follow him," said De Guiche; "it wi=
ll be the surest plan."  "I was about to propose so doing," answered De Bra=
gelonne.  In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain =
whether he was followed or not.  "You see," said Raoul, philodendron monste=
ra in Northern Buddhism. For the latter, in His Higher Self as Vajradhara (=
Dorjechang), is _never_ manifested, except to the seven Dhyan Chohans, the =
primeval Builders. Esoterically, it is the Spirit of the "Seven" collective=
ly, their seventh principle, or Atman. Exoterically, any amount of fables m=
ay be found in _Kala Chakra_, the most important work in the Gyut [or (D)gy=
u] division of the can always find a tree and a cord."  The monk's eye agai=
n flashed, but that was all; he merely repeated his phrase, "I will go,"--a=
nd he went.  "Let us follow him," said De Guiche; "it will be the surest pl=
an."  "I was about to propose so doing," answered De Bragelonne.  In the sp=
ace of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was foll=
owed or not.  "You see," said Raoul, _
"One without Beginning or End"--in short, the Logos of Buddhism. For, as Va=
jrasattva, He is=20

simply the Tsovo (Chief) of the Dhyani Buddhas or Dhyan Chohans, and the Su=
preme Intelligence=20

in the Second World; while as Vajradhara (Dorjechang), He is all that which=
 was enumerated=20

above. "These two are one, and yet two," and over them is "Chang, the Supre=
me Unmanifested=20

and Universal Wisdom that has no name." As two in one He (They) is the Powe=
r that subdued and=20

conquered Evil from the beginning, allowing it to reign only over willing s=
ubjects on earth, and=20

having no power over those who despise and hate it. Esoterically the allego=
ry is easily understood;=20

exoterically Vajradhara (Vajrasattva) is the God to whom all the evil spiri=
ts swore that they would=20

not impede the propagation of the Good Law (Buddhism), and before whom all =
the demons=20

tremble. Therefore, we say this dual personage has the same _role_ assigned=
 to it in canonical=20

and dogmatic Tibetan Buddhism as have Jehovah and the Archangel Mikael, the=
 Metatron of the=20

Jewish Kabalists. This is easily shown. Mikael is "the are not people who m=
ay be treated anyhow;=20

my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche.=
 Nor was it from=20

caprice we asked the question, for there is a wounded and dying man who dem=
ands the succor of=20

the church. If you be a priest, I conjure you in the name of humanity to fo=
llow me to aid this man; if=20

you be not, it is a different matter, and I warn you in the name of courtes=
y, of which you appear=20

profoundly ignorant, that I shall chastise you for your insolence."  The pa=
le face of the monk=20

became so livid and his smile so strange, that Raoul, whose eyes were still=
 fixed upon him, felt as=20

if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult.  "He is some Spanish =
or Flemish spy," said he,=20

putting his hand to his pistol. A glance, threatening and transient as ligh=
tning, replied to Raoul.=20

"Well, sir," said De Guiche, "are you going to reply?"  "I am a priest," sa=
id the young man.  "Then,=20

father," said Raoul, forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did=
 not come from his=20

heart, "if you are a priest you have an opportunity, as my friend has=20


_
Master. "My face shall go with thee" (in English, "presence"), before the I=
sraelites, says God to=20

Moses (_Exodus_, xxxiii. 14). "The angel of my presence" (Hebrew: "of my fa=
ce") (_Isaiah_, lxiii.=20

9), etc. The Roman Catholics identify Christ with Mikael, who is also his f=
erouer, or "face,"=20

mystically. This is precisely the position of Vajradhara, or At the next in=
n you will find a wounded=20

man, now being attended by our servants, who has asked the assistance of a =
minister of God."  "I=20

will go," said the monk.  And he touched his mule.  "If you do not go, sir,=
" said De Guiche,=20

"remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of =
having you seized=20

wherever you may be; and then=20
