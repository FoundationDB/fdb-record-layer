poles stand on every street. Formerly blacks were almost the exclusive coac=
hmen in wealthy=20

families: this is so no longer; white men are now employed, and for aught w=
e see, they fill their=20

servile station with an obsequiousness as profound as that of the blacks. T=
he readiness and ease=20

with which they adapt themselves to these conditions ought not to be lost s=
ight of by the colored=20

people. The meaning is very important, and we should learn it. We are taugh=
t our insecurity by it.=20

Without the means of living, life is a curse, and leaves us at the mercy of=
 the oppressor to become=20

his debased slaves. Now, colored men, what do you mean to do, for you must =
do something? The=20

American Colonization Society tells you to go to Liberia. Mr. Bibb tells yo=
u to go to Canada. Others=20

tell you to go to school. We tell you to go to work; and to work you must g=
o or die. Men are not=20

valued in this country, or in any country, for what they are; they are valu=
ed for what they can _do_.=20

It is in vain that we talk of being men, if we do not the work of men. We m=
ust become valuable to=20

society in other departments of industry than those servile ones from which=
 we are rapidly being=20

excluded. We must show that we can _do_ as well as be; and to this end we m=
ust learn trades.=20

When we can build as well as live in houses; when we can _make_ as well as =
_wear_ shoes;=20

when we can produce as well as consume wheat, corn and rye--then we shall b=
ecome valuable to=20

society. Society is a hard-hearted affair.--With it the helpless may expect=
 no higher dignity than=20

that of paupers. The individual must lay society under obligation to him, o=
r society will honor him=20

only as a stranger and sojourner. _How_ shall this be done? In this manner;=
 use every means,=20

strain every nerve to master some important mechanical art. At present, the=
 facilities for doing so=20

are few--institutions of learning are more readily opened to you than the w=
ork-shop; but the Lord=20

helps them who will help themselves, and we have no doubt that new faciliti=
es will be presented as=20

we press forward.  If the alternative were presented to us of learning a tr=
ade or of getting an=20

education, we would learn the trade, for the reason, that with the trade we=
 could get the education=20

while with the education we could not get the trade. What we, as a people, =
most need, is the=20

means for our own elevation.--An educated colored man, in the United States=
, unless he has=20

within him the heart of a hero, and is willing to engage in a lifelong batt=
le for his rights, as a man,=20

finds few inducements to remain in this country. He is isolated in the land=
 of his birth--debarred by=20

his color from congenial association with whites; he is equally cast out by=
 the ignorance of the=20

_blacks_. The remedy for this must comprehend the elevation of the masses; =
and this can only be=20

done by putting the mechanic arts within the reach of colored men.  We have=
 now stated pretty=20

strongly the case of our colored countrymen; perhaps some will say, _too_ s=
trongly, but we know=20

whereof we affirm.  In view of this state of things, we appeal to the aboli=
tionists. What Boss anti-

slavery mechanic will take a black boy into his wheelwright's shop, his bla=
cksmith's shop, his=20

joiner's shop, his cabinet shop? Here is something _practical_; where are t=
he whites and where=20

are the blacks that will respond to it? Where are the antislavery milliners=
 and seamstresses that=20

will take colored girls and teach them trades, by which they can obtain an =
honorable living? The=20

fact that we have made good cooks, good waiters, good barbers, and white-wa=
shers, induces the=20

belief that we may excel in higher branches of industry. _One thing is cert=
ain; we must find new=20

methods of obtaining a livelihood, for the old ones are failing us very fas=
t_.  We, therefore, call=20

upon the intelligent and thinking ones amongst us, to urge upon the colored=
 people within their=20

reach, in all seriousness, the duty and the necessity of giving their child=
ren useful and lucrative=20

trades, by which they may commence the battle of life with weapons, commens=
urate with the=20



exigencies of conflict.--_African Repository_, vol. xxix., pp. 136, 137.   =
EDUCATION OF=20

COLORED PEOPLE  (_Written by a highly respectable gentleman of the South in=
_ 1854)  Several=20

years ago I saw in the _Repository_, copied from the _Colonization Herald_,=
 a proposal to=20

establish a college for the education of young colored men in this country.=
 Since that time I have=20

neither seen nor heard anything more of it, and I should be glad to hear wh=
ether the proposed=20

plan was ever carried into execution.  Four years ago I conversed with one =
of the officers of the=20

Colonization Society on the subject of educating in this country colored pe=
rsons intending to=20

emigrate to Liberia, and expressed my firm conviction of the paramount impo=
rtance of high moral=20

and mental training as a fit preparation for such emigrants.  To my great r=
egret the gentleman=20

stated that under existing circumstances the project, all important as he c=
onfessed it to be, was=20

almost impracticable; so strong being the influence of the enemies of colon=
ization that they would=20

dissuade any colored persons so educated from leaving the United States.  I=
 know that he was=20

thoroughly acquainted with the subject in all its bearings, and therefore f=
elt that he must have good=20

reasons for what he said; still I hoped the case was not so bad as he thoug=
ht, and, at any rate, I=20

looked forward with strong hope to the time when the colored race would, as=
 a body, open their=20

eyes to the miserable, unnatural position they occupy in America; when they=
 would see who were=20

their true friends, those who offered them real and complete freedom, socia=
l and political, in a land=20

where there is no white race to keep them in subjection, where they govern =
themselves by their=20

own laws; or those pretended friends who would keep the African where he ca=
n never be aught=20

but a serf and bondsman of a despised caste, and who, by every act of their=
 pretended=20

philanthropy, make the colored man's condition worse.  Most happily, since =
that time, the colored=20

race has been aroused to a degree never before known, and the conviction ha=
s become general=20

among them that they must go to Liberia if they would be free and happy.  U=
nder these=20

circumstances the better the education of the colored man the more keenly w=
ill he feel his present=20

situation and the more clearly he will see the necessity of emigration.  As=
suming such to be the=20

feelings of the colored race, I think the immense importance of a collegiat=
e institution for the=20

education of their young must be felt and acknowledged by every friend of t=
he race. Some time=20

since the legislature of Liberia passed an act to incorporate a college in =
Liberia, but I fear the=20

project has failed, as I have heard nothing more of it since. Supposing how=
ever the funds raised=20

for such an institution, where are the professors to come from? They _must_=
 be educated in this=20

country; and how can that be done without establishing an institution speci=
ally for young colored=20

men?  There is not a college in the United States where a young man of colo=
r could gain=20

admission, or where, supposing him a letter!=E2=80=9D wrote the Sardinian a=
mbassador to his sovereign.=20

=E2=80=9CThe most tender and most delicate friend could not have written ot=
herwise.=E2=80=9D And he said to=20

Tchichagof, as he handed back the precious paper, =E2=80=9CYou ought to die=
 for the prince who wrote you=20

that letter.=E2=80=9D An interview followed, in which the reconciliation wa=
s cemented. =E2=80=9CI know what you=20

have said of me,=E2=80=9D said Alexander, =E2=80=9Cbut I attribute all to a=
 good motive.=E2=80=9D Need it be added that=20

henceforward Tchichagof served him faithfully?  But what of the French--of =
Napoleon? What of his=20

desolated country, his murdered subjects, his fair and favourite city laid =
in ashes? Could these=20

things be forgiven? Or is it true, as many would tell us, that the precepts=
 of Christ are admirably=20

suited for women and children, perhaps, at the utmost, for men in their pri=
vate relations each with=20

the other, but a nullity or a failure when applied to larger scenes and int=
erests, utterly ineffectual to=20



guide and control the statesman in his cabinet or the monarch on his throne=
? We shall see how far=20

the story of Alexander answers this question.  For two or three years he mi=
ght truly have been said=20

to =E2=80=9Cabide under the shadow of the Almighty,=E2=80=9D although not a=
s yet did he =E2=80=9Cdwell in the secret place=20

of the most High.=E2=80=9D He trusted in God, he sought to obey Christ, lon=
g before he knew him as the=20

Saviour upon whom his sins were laid. Again, to use his own words, =E2=80=
=9CI did not arrive there in a=20

moment. Believe me, the path by which I was conducted led me across many a =
conflict, many a=20

doubt.=E2=80=9D  The light that shone within him was like the slow dawn of =
a Northern day--    =E2=80=9CAn Arctic=20

day that will not see   A sunset till its summer=E2=80=99s gone.=E2=80=9D  =
Those were indeed the beams of the sun=20

which flooded the whole horizon, gladdening the heart of every living thing=
; but the sun itself was=20

still unseen, because as yet unrisen. Its light was there; its glory was ye=
t to come.     CHAPTER=20

XVII.  IN THE CAMP.    =E2=80=9COur souls are parched with agonizing thirst=
,   Which must be quenched=20

though death were in the draught:   We must have vengeance.=E2=80=9D   One =
evening towards the end of=20

October, and just when the first snow of the year was beginning to fall, Iv=
an Pojarsky and Michael=20

Ivanovitch entered the head-quarters of the Russian army at Tarovtino. Thei=
r fleet Arabian horses=20

were flecked with foam, for they had traversed the ten leagues which divide=
d them from Moscow=20

without once drawing rein. As they dashed along, they shouted to all whom t=
hey passed,=20

=E2=80=9CNapoleon has quitted Moscow!=E2=80=9D and answering =E2=80=9Choura=
s=E2=80=9D and cries of joy cheered them on their=20

way.  =E2=80=9CBring us at once to Count Rostopchine,=E2=80=9D said Ivan to=
 the soldiers who crowded around=20

them. =E2=80=9CHe is here, is he not?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe is here, gospod=
in; but the Marshal--=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWith all due respect to=20

the dignity of his Highness the General-in-Chief, our business is with the =
Count, brothers,=E2=80=9D=20

returned Ivan.  He was accordingly conducted to the presence of Rostopchine=
, who, after a=20

lengthened interview, dismissed him to seek rest and refreshment, desiring =
him to return early in=20

the morning.  Rostopchine=E2=80=99s aide-de-camp offered his hospitality, a=
nd Ivan thanked him=20

courteously, but inquired whether Captain Adrian Wertsch, of the Moscow mil=
itia, was not then in=20

the camp. The aide-de-camp answered in the affirmative, and agreed to bring=
 Ivan to his tent,=20

though very reluctantly; for he was sorry to lose the honour and pleasure o=
f entertaining one who=20

could give him so many interesting details about the French occupation of M=
oscow.  Adrian was=20

standing outside his tent when Ivan approached, and he greeted him with joy=
ful astonishment, as=20

one risen from the dead.  =E2=80=9CI did not think to see your face again,=
=E2=80=9D he said.  =E2=80=9CLife is still left me,=E2=80=9D=20

returned Ivan in a broken voice; for, after so many horrors, the sight of a=
 familiar face proved at the=20

moment almost more than he could bear.  =E2=80=9CCome in,=E2=80=9D said Adr=
ian, drawing his arm affectionately=20

within his own. =E2=80=9CA good draught of champagne is what you want now.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWill you tell your orderly to=20

take care of my friend Michael Ivanovitch? He has behaved like a hero.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCertainly.=E2=80=9D  Adrian gave=20

a few rapid directions, then led Ivan into his tent, and before he would li=
sten to a word, poured for=20

him a sparkling goblet of the beverage which he considered a panacea for al=
l the ills, mental and=20

bodily, of the noble, as vodka was for those of the mujik.  Ivan needed the=
 stimulant, for he was=20

worn out with fatigue and excitement. He said, as he finished the draught, =
=E2=80=9CYou got my letter,=20

Adrian?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes. My poor mother!=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CNo one w=
as to blame. We did all we could, but nothing would=20

induce her to leave the old home; and when the French entered Moscow, the s=
hock was more=20

than she could bear. We buried her honourably, by the side of her husband, =
in the Church of St.=20

Eustacius. Pope Yefim performed the funeral services.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CTh=
at was nobly done, Ivan, and I thank=20

you most heartily.--By the way, your friend Pope Yefim has made himself fam=
ous.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHow? By=20



remaining in the city?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBy daring to celebrate, with a so=
lemn service, the Czar=E2=80=99s coronation day,=20

under the very beard of Napoleon.[33] We have all heard of it.=E2=80=9D  =
=E2=80=9CHe never supposed he was doing=20

anything extraordinary. The Prior of the Dominican Monastery, whom he consu=
lted, agreed that he=20

was right. I can tell you, Adrian, that good man himself was by no means in=
 love with his=20

countrymen. Though his religion is their own, and he kept his church open t=
he whole time of the=20

Occupation, scarcely a Frenchman darkened its doors, except a few officers =
of noble birth=20

belonging to the old _r=C3=A9gime_. As a rule, the soldiers of Napoleon are=
 infidels. Sometimes, out of=20

curiosity, they would stray into our churches. On the coronation day, a poo=
r young fellow, a mere=20

lad, stole into Pope Yefim=E2=80=99s church, and was near paying dearly for=
 his rashness; for a party of=20

mujiks set upon him after the service, taking him for a spy. They might hav=
e killed him; but--

strangest chance of all--my friend Michael, whose thoughts by day and dream=
s by night are only of=20

slaying Nyemtzi, interposed to save this one, saying he knew him, and had r=
eceived a kindness at=20

his hands. I spoke to the youth, and he told me he had been religiously bro=
ught up, and said the=20

very sound of a church-bell, and the sight of men kneeling in prayer, seeme=
d to do him good,=20

though he could not understand a word of the service.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA =
queer taste,=E2=80=9D said Adrian, shrugging his=20

shoulders. Then to his orderly, who had just entered the tent, =E2=80=9CBri=
ng us the best supper you can=20

get, and more champagne.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAdrian,=E2=80=9D asked Ivan, =
=E2=80=9Cwhere is Leon?=E2=80=9D  Adrian=E2=80=99s face assumed a=20

sorrowful expression. =E2=80=9CGone to our mother,=E2=80=9D he answered. =
=E2=80=9CHe was wounded at Borodino, though=20

not severely. He insisted upon going out again, and met his death in a skir=
mish ten days ago.=E2=80=9D=20

Ivan felt and showed real sorrow. Of the two companions of his youth, Leon =
had been his=20

favourite, and he could not hear unmoved the tidings of his death. =E2=80=
=9CDeath--death everywhere,=E2=80=9D he=20

murmured sadly.  =E2=80=9CCome, my friend,=E2=80=9D said Adrian kindly, =E2=
=80=9Cyou must not give way. It is only the fate=20

of war. You have been so long in that horrible den of a city that your=20


_
escape insult and indignity. Into our Theological Seminaries a few are admi=
tted, and are, perhaps,=20

treated well; but what difficulty they find in obtaining a proper preparato=
ry education. The cause of=20

religion then, no less than that of secular education, calls for such a mea=
sure.  I think a strong and=20

earnest appeal ought to be made to every friend of colonization throughout =
the United States to=20

support the scheme with heart, hand and purse. Surely there are enough frie=
nds of the cause to=20

subscribe at least a moderate sum for such a noble object; and in a cause l=
ike this, wealthy=20

colored persons ought to, and doubtless will, subscribe according to their =
means. In addition to the=20

general appeal through the _Repository_, let each individual friend of colo=
nization use all his=20

influence with his personal friends and acquaintances, especially with such=
 as are wealthy. I know=20

from my own experience how much can be done by personal application, even i=
n cases where=20

success appears nearly hopeless.--I will pledge myself to use my humble end=
eavors to the utmost=20

with my personal acquaintances. A large sum would not be _absolutely necess=
ary_ to found the=20

college; and it would certainly be better to commence in the humblest way t=
han to give up the=20

scheme altogether.  Buildings for instance might be purchased in many place=
s for a very moderate=20

sum that would answer every purpose, or they might be built in the cheapest=
 manner; in short,=20

everything might be commenced on the most economical scale and afterwards e=
nlarged as funds=20

increased.  Those who are themselves engaged in teaching, such as the facul=
ties of colleges, etc.,=20

would, of course, be most competent to prepare a plan for the proposed inst=
itution, and the ablest=20

of them should be consulted; meantime almost anyone interested in the cause=
 may offer some=20

useful hint. In that spirit, I would myself offer a few brief suggestions, =
in case this appeal should be=20

favorably received.  Probably few men of my time of life have studied the c=
haracter and condition=20

of the African race more attentively than I have, with what success I canno=
t presume to say, but=20

the opinion of any one devoting so much of his time to the subject ought to=
 be of _some_ value.=20

My opinion of their capacity has been much raised during my attempts at ins=
tructing them, but at=20

the same time, I am convinced that they require a _totally different mode o=
f training from whites_,=20

and that any attempt to educate the two races together must prove a failure=
. I now close these=20

desultory remarks with the hope that some one more competent than myself wi=
ll take up the cause=20

and urge it until some definite plan is formed.--_African Repository_, vol.=

FROM A MEMORIAL TO THE LEGISLATURE OF NORTH CAROLINA, CIRCULATED AMONG=20

THE CITIZENS OF THAT STATE IN 1855, TO SECURE THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN=
=20

LAWS REGULATING SLAVES AND FREE PERSONS OF COLOR.  ELEVATION OF THE=20

COLORED RACE  The Memorial is thus introduced:  "Your memorialists are well=
 aware of the=20

delicate nature of the subject to which the attention of the Legislature is=
 called, and of the=20

necessity of proceeding with deliberation and caution. They propose some ra=
dical changes in the=20

law of slavery, demanded by our common christianity, by public morality, an=
d by the common weal=20

of the whole South. At the same time they have no wish or purpose inconsist=
ent with the best=20

interests of the slaveholder, and suggest no reform which may impair the ef=
ficiency of slave labor.=20

On the contrary, they believe that the much desired modifications of our sl=
ave code will redound to=20

the welfare of all classes, and to the honor and character of the State thr=
oughout the civilized=20

world."  The attention of the Legislature was then asked to the following p=
ropositions: "1. That it=20

behooves us as christian people to establish the institution of matrimony a=
mong our slaves, with=20

all its legal obligations and guarantees as to its duration between the par=
ties. 2. That under no=20



circumstances should masters be permitted to disregard these natural and sa=
cred ties of=20

relationship among their slaves, or between slaves belonging to different m=
asters. 3. That the=20

parental relation to be acknowledged by law; and that the separation of par=
ents from their young=20

children, say of twelve years and under, be strictly forbidden, under heavy=
 pains and penalties. 4.=20

That the laws which prohibit the instruction of slaves and free colored per=
sons, by teaching  =E2=80=9CThat=20

it has been indeed. The count, who is as=20

hard as _this_,=E2=80=9D laying his hand upon Adrian=E2=80=99s iron camp-be=

_you_ escape?=E2=80=9D asked Adrian.  =E2=80=9CThere was little difficulty =
in escaping. It was easy enough to hide=20

in the ruins or in the cellars, many of which had been left well stocked wi=
th provisions when the=20

city was abandoned. But have you heard about our wounded men?=E2=80=9D he a=
sked, with a return of=20

animation, and even of something like cheerfulness.  =E2=80=9CNo; I have he=
ard nothing.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe count was=20

obliged to leave two thousand men, who were too desperately wounded to bear=
 removal,=20

concealed in the cellars of the city. Here they managed to drag on their li=
ves, though in a state of=20

extreme wretchedness. We found them out, and used to bring them food and ot=
her comforts. That=20

work was even more hazardous than setting the city on fire; for discovery w=
ould have cost, not our=20

lives alone, but theirs. Napoleon=E2=80=99s last act before he left the cit=
y was to order ten sick men, found=20

in a cellar, to be shot.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWretch!=E2=80=9D cried Adrian, =
clenching his hand.  =E2=80=9CThe half has not been told=20

you, or you would find no name to call him by,=E2=80=9D returned Ivan fierc=
ely. =E2=80=9CHe has defiled our holiest=20

sanctuaries; he has torn open our imperial tombs; he has stabled his horses=
 in the church where=20

our Czar was crowned; he has carried everything away upon which he could la=
y his sacrilegious=20

hands, even to the cross upon the tower of Ivan Veliki, and the Tartar bann=
ers which hung as=20

trophies in the Arsenal. Well may Count Rostopchine curse him, as only he k=
nows how to curse.=20

But those wounded--we contrived somehow to keep them alive; and I think a g=
oodly number may=20

be saved yet. I asked the count not to lose an hour in sending them succour=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI hope he has had=20

the grace to do justice to your courage and your exertions.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CHe has condescended to approve my=20

conduct,=E2=80=9D said Ivan with modest satisfaction. =E2=80=9CAnd now he o=
ffers me three things, by way of=20

recompense, as he is pleased to say. If I choose to return with him to the =
city, he will give me an=20

appointment in the civil service, with the rank of titular counsellor, whic=
h, as you know, answers to=20

that of senior captain in the army.=E2=80=9D[34]  =E2=80=9CSurely you will =
not do that! You could not sheathe your=20

sword _now_,=E2=80=9D Adrian exclaimed.  =E2=80=9CSo much I said to the cou=
nt; and he answered that, if I pleased,=20



he would request the marshal to put me on his staff.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCap=
ital! What more could you desire?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe=20

made another proposal--to send me to the Czar with the report of what I had=
 seen and done.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CAnd which did you accept?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9C_The last_,=E2=80=9D =
said Ivan. At that moment a sound, dull, prolonged, and=20

loud, like distant thunder, smote upon their ears. Again it came, and yet a=
gain, making the air=20

tremble around them and the earth shake beneath their feet. =E2=80=9CWhat i=
s that?=E2=80=9D cried Ivan.  =E2=80=9CNot=20

musketry or cannon,=E2=80=9D said Adrian, with a look of alarm and perplexi=
ty. =E2=80=9CWe are tolerably familiar=20

with those sounds. _This_ is different.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMore like an exp=
losion--if so, a terrible one. Perhaps a=20

great powder magazine. But where?=E2=80=9D mused Ivan.  Adrian hurried out =
in search of information, and=20

soon returned to tell his friend that the noise evidently came from the dir=
ection of Moscow. More=20

than that no one=20

LIBERIA  On the=20

sailing of almost every expedition we have had occasion to chronicle the de=
parture of=20

missionaries, teachers, or a physician, but not until the present time, tha=
t of a lawyer. The souls=20

and bodies of the emigrants have been well cared for; now, it is no doubt s=
upposed, they require=20

assistance in guarding their money, civil rights, etc. Most professional em=
issaries have been=20

educated at public expense, either by Missionary or the Colonization Societ=
ies, but the first lawyer=20

goes out independent of any associated aid. Mr. Garrison Draper, a colored =
man of high=20

respectability, and long a resident of Old Town, early determined on educat=
ing his only son for=20

Africa. He kept him at some good public school in Pennsylvania till fitted =
for college, then sent him=20

to Dartmouth where he remained four years and graduated, maintaining always=
 a very respectable=20

standing, socially, and in his class. After much consultation with friends,=
 he determined upon the=20

study of law. Mr. Charles Gilman, a retired member of the Baltimore Bar, ve=
ry kindly consented to=20

give young Draper professional instruction,  Morning brought the explanatio=
n. Ivan was still=20

enjoying the profound slumber of youth and weariness, when a brother office=
r of Adrian=E2=80=99s rushed=20

into the tent. =E2=80=9CThe Kremlin is destroyed!=E2=80=9D he cried. =E2=80=
=9CThat demon Napoleon had it undermined=20

before he left, and last night it was blown into fragments!=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThe Kremlin?--Impossible!=E2=80=9D cried=20

Adrian, who was dressing for parade.  =E2=80=9CToo possible, and too true,=

messenger from the city has just arrived to bring the tidings to the marsha=
l and the count.=E2=80=9D=20

Meanwhile Ivan, who had been suddenly awakened, started up in horror, excla=
iming, =E2=80=9CThe Czar!=20

oh, what will it be to _him_?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBlown into fragments, did =
you say?=E2=80=9D returned Adrian. =E2=80=9CUtterly=20

impossible! The masonry is as solid as the rocks beneath our feet, and the =
walls of the arsenal are=20

three yards in thickness.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThose walls are now level with=
 the ground,=E2=80=9D said the officer; =E2=80=9Cand the=20

palace--the Czar=E2=80=99s ancient palace--is in ruins.=E2=80=9D  Ivan utte=
red a bitter cry, and Adrian asked=20

breathlessly, =E2=80=9CWhat of the churches?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COne of them=
, I have not heard which, is thrown down. The=20

mines were fired by slow-consuming fusees; and our men, who arrived just be=

_
having any opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the routine of profes=
sional practice, the=20

rules, habits, and courtesy of the Bar, in Baltimore, Mr. Draper spent some=
 few months in the=20

office of a distinguished lawyer in Boston. On returning to the city to emb=
ark for Liberia, he=20

underwent an examination by Judge Lee of the Superior Court, and obtained f=
rom him a certificate=20

of his fitness to practice the profession of law, a copy of which we append=
 hereto.  We consider=20

the settlement of Mr. Draper in the Republic as an event of no little impor=
tance. It seemed=20

necessary that there should be one regularly educated lawyer in a community=
 of several thousand=20

people, in a Republic of prevent further mischief, if they could.=E2=80=9D =
 =E2=80=9CBut,=E2=80=9D said Ivan, who had risen=20

now,--=E2=80=9Cbut there must be a mistake somewhere; for the French kept t=
heir own sick and wounded in=20

the Kremlin, and I happen to know that those unfit to be moved were still t=
here when I left the city.=20

That Napoleon could have exposed _them_ to a horrible death is simply incon=
ceivable.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYet too=20

true,=E2=80=9D the officer answered. =E2=80=9CHe has sacrificed his own hel=
pless followers to his revenge and=20

hatred. For this barbarous deed can have had no other motive. There was not=
hing to be gained by=20

it.=E2=80=9D  Adrian laid his hand upon Ivan=E2=80=99s shoulder. =E2=80=9CD=

and fight. We will pay this=20


_
informed men now in the practice of law in Liberia, but they have not been =
educated to the=20

profession, and we believe, no one makes that his exclusive business. We do=
ubt not that they will=20

welcome Mr. Draper as one of their fraternity. To our Liberia friends we co=
mmend him as a well-

educated, intelligent man, of good  =E2=80=9CI wish his neck were _there_,=

the earth with his strong heel. =E2=80=9CBut I would not kill him,=E2=80=9D=
 he added, after a pause. =E2=80=9CNo. I would drag=20

him in chains to the feet of the Czar, and let _him_ kill him with his own =
hand.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think,=E2=80=9D said Ivan=20

slowly and with deliberation,--=E2=80=9CI think every=20
