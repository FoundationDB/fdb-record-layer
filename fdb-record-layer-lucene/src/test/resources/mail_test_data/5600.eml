dracaena marginata and became a portion of Upper Egypt.  Upon arrival at So=
ojalup we came upon the principal encampment of the Hadendowa during the dr=
y season. Within a few miles of this spot the scene had changed: instead of=
 the bare earth denuded of vegetation, the country was covered with thought=
 to any other theme than Sicily and Syracuse, the expedition of Nicias, and=
 the adventures of Agathocles. And yet, during all their travels, Lothair f=

 This was remarkable at the great cities, such as Messina and Palermo, but =
it was a prevalent _
while we should travel S.E. about ninety miles to Cassala, the capital of t=
he Taka country, on the=20

confines of Abyssinia, the great depot upon that frontier for Egyptian troo=
ps, military stores, &c.=20

Having procured fresh camels, we started on 5th July. This portion of the d=
esert was rich in agates=20

and numerous specimens of bloodstone. Exactly opposite the village of Gozer=
ajup are curious=20

natural landmarks,--four pyramidical hills of granite that can be seen for =
many miles' distance in=20

this perfectly level country. One of these hills is about 500 feet high, an=
d is composed entirely of=20

flaked blocks of grey granite piled one upon the other; some of these stand=
 perpendicularly in=20

single masses from 30 to 50 feet high, and from a distance might be taken f=
or giants climbing the=20

hill-side. The pinnacle has a peculiar conical cap, which appears to have b=
een placed there by=20

design, but upon closer inspection it is found to be natural, as no stone o=
f such immense size=20

could have been placed in such a position.  For the first two hours' march =
from this landmark, the=20

country was covered with scrubby bush abounding in gazelles and guinea-fowl=
. Here, for the first=20

time, I saw the secretary bird, known to the Arabs as the "Devil's horse." =
A pair of these=20

magnificent birds were actively employed in their useful avocation of hunti=
ng reptiles, which they=20

chased with wonderful speed. Great numbers of wild asses passed us during t=
he march towards=20

evening; they were on their way from the desert to the Atbara river, some m=
iles distant upon the=20

west. Veritable thunder we now heard for the first time in Africa, and a cl=
oud rose with great=20

rapidity from the horizon. A cloud was a wonder that we had not enjoyed for=
 months, but as this=20

increased both in size and density, accompanied by a gust of cool wind, we =
were led to expect a=20

still greater wonder--RAIN! Hardly had we halted for the night, when down i=
t came in torrents,=20

accompanied by a heavy thunderstorm. On the following morning, we experienc=
ed the=20

disadvantage of rain; the ground was so slippery that the camels could not =
march, and we were=20

obliged to defer our start until the sun had dried the surface.  We had now=
 arrived at the most=20

interesting point to an explorer. From Cairo to within a few miles south of=
 Gozerajup stretched the=20

unbroken desert through which we had toiled from Korosko, and which had so =
firmly impressed its=20

dreariness upon the mind that nothing but desert had been expected: we  All=
 the efforts of the=20

English Propaganda were now directed to prevent the return of Lothair to hi=
s own country. The=20

cardinal and Lady St. Jerome, and the monsignore, and Father Coleman, all t=
he beautiful young=20

countesses who had =E2=80=9Cgone over=E2=80=9D to Rome, and all the spirite=
d young earls who had come over to=20

bring their wives back, but had unfortunately remained themselves, looked v=
ery serious, and=20

spoke much in whispers. Lord St. Jerome was firm that Lothair should immedi=
ately leave the city,=20

and find that change of scene and air which were declared by authority to b=
e indispensable for his=20

health, both of mind and body. But his return to England, at this moment, w=
as an affair of serious=20

difficulty. He could not return unattended, and attended, too, by some inti=
mate and devoted friend.=20

Besides, it was very doubtful whether Lothair had strength remaining to bea=
r so great an exertion,=20

and at such a season of the year=E2=80=94and he seemed disinclined to it hi=
mself. He also wished to=20

leave Rome, but he wished also in time to extend his travels. Amid these di=
fficulties, a Neapolitan=20

duke, a great friend of Monsignore Catesby, a gentleman who always had a fr=
iend in need, offered=20

to the young English noble, the interesting young Englishman so favored by =
Heaven, the use of=20

his villa on the coast of the remotest part of Sicily, near Syracuse. Here =
was a solution of many=20

difficulties: departure from Rome, change of scene and air=E2=80=94sea air,=
 too, particularly=20

recommended=E2=80=94and almost the same as a return to England, without an =
effort, for was it not an=20



island, only with a better climate, and a people with free institutions, or=
 a taste for them, which is=20

the same?  The mode in which Lady St. Jerome and Monsignors Catesby consult=
ed Lord St.=20

Jerome on the subject took the adroit but insidious form of congratulating =
him on the entire and=20

unexpected fulfilment of his purpose. =E2=80=9CAre we not fortunate?=E2=80=
=9D exclaimed her ladyship, looking up=20

brightly in his face, and gently pressing one of his arms.  =E2=80=9CExactl=
y everything your lordship=20

required,=E2=80=9D echoed Monsignore Catesby, congratulating him by pressin=
g the other.  The cardinal=20

said to Lord St. Jerome, in the course of the morning, in an easy way, and =
as if he were not=20

thinking too much of the matter, =E2=80=9CSo, you have got out of all your =
difficulties.=E2=80=9D  Lord St. Jerome was=20

not entirely satisfied, but he thought he had done a great deal, and, to sa=
y the truth, the effort for=20

him had not been inconsiderable; and so the=20


_
content in a world of hot sand, rocks, and pebbles; but we had arrived upon=
 the limit; the curious=20

landmark of Gozerajup was an everlasting beacon that marked the frontier of=
 the Nubian desert; it=20

was a giant warder, that seemed to guard the living south from the dreadful=
 skeleton of nature on=20

the north; the desert had ceased!  It was a curious and happy coincidence t=
hat onr arrival upon the=20

limits of the desert should have been Monsignore Catesby and Father Coleman=
, travelled by easy=20

stages, and chiefly on horseback, through a delicious and romantic country,=
 which alone did=20

Lothair a great deal of good, to the coast; crossed the straits on a serene=
 afternoon, visited=20

Messina and Palermo, and finally settled at their point of destination=E2=
=80=94the Villa Catalano.  Nothing=20

could be more satisfactory than the monsignore=E2=80=99s bulletin, announci=
ng to his friends at Rome=20


_
shower of rain: we no longer travelled upon sand and stones, but we stood u=
pon a fertile loam,=20

rendered soapy and adhesive by the recent shower. The country was utterly b=
arren at that=20

season, as the extreme heat of the sun and simoom destroys all vegetation s=
o thoroughly that it=20

becomes as crisp as glass; the dried grass breaks in the wind, and is carri=
ed away in dust, leaving=20

the earth so utterly naked and bare that it is rendered a complete desert. =
 In the rainy season, the=20

whole of this country, from the south to Gozerajup, is covered with excelle=
nt pasturage, and, far=20

from resembling a desert, it becomes a mass of bright green herbage. The Ar=
abs and their flocks=20

are driven from the south by the flies and by the heavy rains, and Gozeraju=
p offers a paradise to=20

both men and beasts; thousands of camels with their young, hundreds of thou=
sands of goats,=20

sheep, and cattle, are accompanied by the Arabs and their families, who enc=
amp on the happy=20

pastures during the season weeks=E2=80=99 travel, air, horse exercise, the =
inspiration of the landscape and=20

the clime, had wonderfully restored Lothair, and they might entirely count =
on his passing Holy=20

Week at Rome, when all they had hoped and prayed for would, by the blessing=
 of the Holy Virgin,=20

be accomplished.       CHAPTER 71 The terrace of the Villa Catalano, with i=
ts orange and palm=20

trees, looked upon a sea of lapiz lazuli, and rose from a shelving shore of=
 aloes and arbutus. The=20

waters reflected the color of the sky, and all the foliage was bedewed with=
 the same violet light of=20

morn which bathed the softness of the distant mountains, and the undulating=
 beauty of the ever-

varying coast.  Lothair was walking on the terrace, his favorite walk, for =
it was the only occasion on=20

which he ever found himself alone. Not that he had any reason to complain o=
f his companions.=20

More complete ones could scarcely be selected. Travel, which, they say, tri=
es all tempers, had=20

only proved the engaging equanimity of=20


_
We had now passed the hunts occupied by the Bishareens, and we had entered =
upon the country=20

of the Hadendowa Arabs. These are an exceedingly bad tribe, and, together w=
ith their neighbours,=20

the Hallonga Arabs, they fought determinedly against the Egyptians, until f=
inally conquered during=20

the reign of the famous Mehemet Ala Pasha, when the provinces of Nubia subm=
itted repose of his=20

brother priest: and then they were so entertaining and so instructive, as w=
ell as handy and=20

experienced in all common things. The monsignore had so much taste and feel=
ing, and various=20

knowledge; and as for the reverend father, all the antiquaries they daily e=
ncountered were mere=20

children in his hands, who, without effort, could explain and illustrate ev=
ery scene=20
