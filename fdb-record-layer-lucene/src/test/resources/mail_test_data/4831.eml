dracaena marginata his remarkable companion, Calamity Jane; both are black, and scarcely recognizable in the cloud of smoke that fills the bar-room. Harris is wounded in a dozen places and weak from loss of blood; yet he stands up to Mr. Edward L. Burlingame, literary adviser to the house.  He was to receive a salary of eighteen dollars and thirty-three cents per week, which was then considered a fair wage for stenographic work.

hand; "so sail in, pilgrims!"  Diamond cowered back, and swore furiously. The wound in his breast 

was yet sore and rankling, and he knew he owed it to the cool and calculating young miner whose 

name was an omen of terror among toe "toughs" of Deadwood.  "Come on, you black-hearted ace 

thief!" shouted Calamity Jane, thrusting the muzzle of one of her plated revolvers forcibly under 

the gambler's prominent nose--"come on! slide in if you are after squar' up-an'-down fun. We'll 

greet you, best we know how, an' not charge you anything, either. See! I've got a couple full hands 

o' sixes--every one's a trump! Ain't ye got no aces hid up yer sleeves?"  The card sharp still cursed 

furiously, and backed away. He dare not reach for a weapon lest the dare-devil girl or young Harris 

(who now held a cocked pill-box in each hand),-"should salt him on a full lay."  "Ha! ha! ha!" and 

the laugh of Calamity rung wildly through the great saloon--"Ha! ha! ha! here's a go! Who wants to 

buy a cupped-winged sharp?"  "Sold out right cheap!" added Ned, facetiously. "Clear the track and 

we'll take him out and boost him to a limb."  At this juncture some half a dozen of the gambler's 

gang came rushing up, headed by Catamount Cass, who had recovered from the effects of the 

blow from Harris' fist.  "At them! at 'em!" roared the "screechin' cattymount frum up nor'." "Rip, dig 

an' gouge 'em. Ho! ho! we'll see now who'll swing, _we_ will! We'll l'arn who'll display his agility in 

mid-air, we will. At 'em, b'yees, at 'em. We'll hang 'em like they do hoss-thieves down at 

Cheyenne!"  Then followed a pitched battle in the bar-room of the "Metropolitan" saloon, such as 

probably never occurred there before, and never has since.  Revolvers flashed on every hand, 

knives clashed in deadly conflict; yells, wild, savage, and awful made a perfect pandemonium, to 

which was added a second edition in the shape of oaths, curses, and groans. Crack! whiz! bang! 

the bullets flew about like hailstones, and men fell to the reeking evening, at a great political 

meeting at Cooper Union, Mr. Beecher was at his brightest and wittiest.  In the course of his 

remarks he had occasion to refer to ex-President Hayes; some one in the audience called out: "He 

was a softy!"  "No," was Mr. Beecher's quick response.  "The country needed a poultice at that 

time, and got it."  "He's dead now, anyhow," responded the voice.  "Not dead, my friend; he only 

sleepeth."  It convulsed the audience, of course, and the reporters took it down in their books. 

After the meeting Edward drove home with Mr. Beecher.  After a while he asked: "Well, how do 

you think it went?"  Edward replied he thought it went very well, except that he did not like the 

reference to ex-President Hayes.  "What reference?  What did I say?"  Edward repeated it.  "Did I 

say that?" he asked.  Edward looked at him.  Mr. Beecher's face was tense.  After a few moments 

he said: "That's generally the way with extemporaneous remarks: they are always dangerous. 

The best impromptu speeches and remarks are the carefully prepared kind," he added.  Edward 

told him he regretted the reference because he knew that General Hayes would read it in the New 

York papers, and he would be nonplussed to understand it, considering the cordial relations which 

existed between the two men.  Mr. Beecher knew of Edward's relations with the ex-President, and 

they had often talked of him together.  Nothing more was said of the incident.  When the Beecher 

home was reached Mr. Beecher said: "Just come in a minute."  He went straight to his desk, and 

wrote and wrote.  It seemed as if he would never stop. At last he handed Edward an eight-page 

letter, closely written, addressed to General Hayes.  "Read that, and mail it, please, on your way 

home.  Then it'll get there just as quickly as the New York papers will."  It was a superbly fine 

letter,--one of those letters which only Henry Ward Beecher could write in his tenderest moods. 

And the reply which came from Fremont, Ohio, was no less fine!

The two friends were not alone in the affray.  No sooner had Catamount Cass and his gang of 

"toughs" showed fight, than a company of miners sprung to Harris' side, and showed their 

willingness to fight it out on the square line.  Therefore, once the first shot was fired, it needed not 

a word to pitch the battle.  Fiercely waged the contest--now hand to hand--loud rose the savage 

yells on the still night air.  One by one men fell on either side, their life-blood crimsoning the floor, 

their dying groans unheeded in the fearful melee.  Still unharmed, and fighting among the first, we

SCRIBNER'S  Edward had been in the employ of Henry Holt and Company as clerk and 

stenographer for two years when Mr. Cary sent for him and told him that there was an opening in 

the publishing house of Charles Scribner's Sons, if he wanted to make a change.  Edward saw at 

once the larger opportunities possible in a house of the importance of the Scribners, and he 

immediately placed himself in communication with Mr. Charles Scribner, with the result that in 

January, 1884, he entered the employ of these publishers as
