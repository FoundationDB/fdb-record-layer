dracaena marginata however great it is, it cannot be wholesome, because, as=
 there is no shade in the way, the intense force of the sun draws up and ca=
rries off the moisture from the flat plains with its heat, and if any water=
 shows itself there, the lightest and purest and the delicately wholesome p=
art of it is summoned away by the air, and dispersed to the skies, while th=
e heaviest and the hard and unpleasant parts are left in springs that are i=
n flat places.     CHAPTER II  RAINWATER   1. alone. "Very good, this minut=
e...."  I followed my wife, heard what she said to me, and was too agitated=
 to understand a word. Patches of light from her candle danced about the st=
airs, our long shadows trembled. My feet caught in the skirts of my dressin=
g-gown; I gasped for breath, and felt as though something were pursuing me =
and trying to catch me from behind.  "I shall die on the spot, here on the =
staircase," I thought. "On the spot...." But we passed the staircase, the d=

ssing-gown; I gasped for breath, and felt as though something were pursuing=

the staircase," I thought. "On the spot...." But we passed the staircase, t=
he dark _
from seed, but springing up naturally of themselves.  4. If the indications=
 mentioned appear in such=20

places, the following test should be applied. Dig out a place not less than=
 three feet square and=20

five feet deep, and put into it about sunset a bronze or leaden bowl or bas=
in, whichever is at hand.=20

Smear the inside with oil, lay it upside down, and cover the top of the exc=
avation with reeds or=20

green boughs, throwing earth upon them. Next day uncover it, and if there a=
re drops and drippings=20

in the vessel, death, but my soul was oppressed with terror, as though I ha=
d suddenly seen a vast=20

menacing glow of fire.  I rapidly struck a light, drank some water straight=
 out of the decanter, then=20

hurried to the open window. The weather outside was magnificent. There was =
a smell of hay and=20

some other very sweet scent. I could see the spikes of the fence, the gaunt=
, drowsy trees by the=20

window, the road, the dark streak of woodland, there was a serene, very bri=
ght moon in the sky=20

and not a single cloud, perfect=20


_
5. Again, if a vessel made of unbaked clay be put in the hole, and covered =
in the same way, it will=20

be wet when uncovered, and already beginning to go to pieces from dampness,=
 if the place=20

contains water. If a fleece of wool is placed in the excavation, and water =
can be wrung out of it on=20

the following day, it will show that the place has a supply. Further, if a =
lamp be trimmed, filled with=20

oil, lighted, and put in that place and covered up, and if on the next day =
it is not burnt out, but still=20

contains some remains of oil and wick, and is itself found to be damp, it w=
ill indicate that the place=20

stirring. I felt that everything was looking at me and waiting for me to di=
e....  It was uncanny. I=20

closed the window and ran to my bed. I felt for my pulse, and not finding i=
t in my wrist, tried to find=20

it in my temple, then in my chin, and again in my wrist, and everything I t=
ouched was cold and=20

clammy with sweat. My breathing came more and more rapidly, my body was shi=
vering, all my=20

inside was in commotion; I had a sensation on my face and on my bald head a=
s though they were=20

covered with spiders' webs.  What should I do? Call my family? No; it would=
 be no use. I could not=20

imagine what my wife and=20


_
attracts moisture. Again, if a fire is made in that place, and if the groun=
d, when thoroughly warmed=20

and burned, sends up a misty vapour from its surface, the place will contai=
n water.  6. After=20

applying these tests and finding the signs described above, a well must nex=
t be sunk in the place,=20

and if a spring of water is found, more wells must be dug thereabouts, and =
all conducted by means=20

of subterranean channels into one place.  The mountains and districts with =
a northern exposure=20

are the best spots in which to search, for the reason that springs are swee=
ter, more wholesome,=20

and more abundant when found there. Such places face away from the sun's co=
urse, and the=20

trees are thick in them, and the mountains, being themselves full of woods,=
 cast shadows of their=20

own, preventing the rays of the sun from striking uninterruptedly upon the =
ground and drying up=20

the moisture.  7. The valleys among the mountains receive the rains most ab=
undantly, and on=20

account of the thick woods the snow is kept in them longer by the shade of =
the trees and=20

mountains. Afterwards, on melting, it filters through the fissures in the g=
round, and thus reaches=20

the very foot of the mountains, from which gushing springs come belching ou=
t.  But in flat=20

countries, on the contrary, a good supply cannot  I hid my head under the p=
illow, closed my eyes,=20

and waited and waited.... My spine was cold; it seemed to be drawn inwards,=
 and I felt as though=20

death were coming upon me stealthily from behind.  "Kee-vee! kee-vee!" I he=
ard a sudden shriek=20

in the night's stillness, and did not know where it was--in my breast or in=
 the street--"Kee-vee! kee-

vee!"  "My God, how terrible!" I would have drunk some more water, but by t=
hen it was fearful to=20

open my eyes and I was afraid to raise my head. I was possessed by unaccoun=
table animal terror,=20

and I cannot understand why I was so frightened: was it that I wanted to li=
ve, or that some new=20

unknown pain was in store for me?  Upstairs, overhead, some one moaned or l=
aughed. I listened.=20

Soon afterwards there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. Some one came=
 hurriedly down,=20

then went up again. A minute later there was a sound of steps downstairs ag=
ain; some one=20

stopped near my door and listened.  "Who is there?" I cried.  The door open=
ed. I boldly opened my=20

eyes, and saw my wife. Her face was pale and her eyes were tear-stained.  "=
You are not asleep,=20

Nikolay Stepanovitch?" she asked.  "What is it?"  "For God's sake, go up an=
d have a look at Liza;=20

there is something the matter with her...."  "Very good, with pleasure," I =
muttered,=20
