s _
pockets emptied and I lost my watch.  SIR TRISTRAM.  Ah, Jedd, it was a glo=
rious moment!=20

GEORGIANA.  Tris made a back, and I stood on it, supported by a correct-car=
d merchant on=20

either side. "Dear friends," I said; "Brothers! I'm with you once again." Y=
ou should have heard the=20

shouts of honest welcome. Before I could obtain silence my field glasses ha=
d gone on their long=20

journey. "Listen to me," I said. "A very dear relative of mine has been col=
lared for playing the=20

three-card trick on his way down from town." There gale on the voyage, thro=
ugh which the young=20

navigators carry their lively little craft. Plans do not always work as the=
y have been arranged; and=20

by an accident the young people are left to fight their own battle, as has =
happened several times=20

before in the history of the cruise.  A considerable portion of the volume =
is taken up with the record=20

of some very stirring events in a certain bay of the island of Cyprus, wher=
e the little steamer had=20

made a harbor after the gale, and where the Guardian-Mother had failed to=
=20


_
Hill with a bobby in half-an-hour," said I, "who's for the rescue?" A dead =
deep silence followed,=20

broken only by the sweet voice of a young child, saying, "What'll we get fo=
r it?" "A pound a-piece,"=20

said I. There was a roar of assent, and my concluding words, "and possibly =
six months," were=20

never heard. At that moment Tris' back could stand it no longer, and we cam=
e heavily to the=20

ground together. [_Seizing THE DEAN by the hand and dragging him up._] Now =
you know whose=20

hands have led you back to your own manger. [_Embracing him._] And oh, brot=
her, confess--isn't=20

there something good and noble in true English sport after all?  THE DEAN. =
 Every abused=20

institution has its redeeming characteristic. But whence is the money to co=
me to reward these=20

dreadful persons? I cannot reasonably ask my girls to organize a bazaar or =
concert.=20

GEORGIANA.  Concert! I'm a rich woman.  THE DEAN.  Rich!  GEORGIANA.  Well,=
 I've cleared=20

fifteen hundred over the Handicap.  THE DEAN.  [_Recoiling._] No! Then the =
horse who enjoyed=20

the shelter of the Deanery last night----  SIR TRISTRAM.  Dandy Dick!  THE =
DEAN.  Won!=20

GEORGIANA.  In a common canter! All the rest nowhere, and Bonny Betsy walke=
d in with the=20

policeman.  THE DEAN.  [_To himself._] Five hundred pounds towards the Spir=
e! Five hundred!=20

Oh, where is Blore with the good news!  SIR TRISTRAM.  Look at him! Lively =
as a cricket!  THE=20

DEAN.  Sir Tristram, I am under the impression that your horse swallowed re=
luctantly a small=20

portion of that bolus last night before I was surprised and removed.  SIR T=
RISTRAM.  By the bye, I=20

am expecting the analysis of that concoction every minute.  THE DEAN.  Spar=
e yourself the=20

trouble--the secret is with me. I seek no acknowledgment from either of you=
, but in relates the=20

manner in which the young captain, actively seconded by his shipmates, extr=
icates his little craft=20

from a very perilous situation, though it involves a disaster to the pirati=
cal enemy and his steamer.=20

The conduct of the boy-commander brings up several questions of interest, u=
pon which everybody=20

has a right to his own opinion.  The steamer and her consort pass through t=
he Suez Canal, which=20

is minutely described, both in its construction and operation. Some of thos=
e on board of the=20

steamer are interested in Scripture history, including the commander; and t=
he residence of the=20

Israelites in the "Land of Goshen," as well as their pilgrimage into Asia, =
pursued by "Pharaoh and=20

his host," are considered at some length. Some of the different views in re=
gard to the passage of=20

the Red Sea are given, though he who presents them clings to the narrative =
as he read it from the=20

Bible in his childhood.  Though the party for reasons given do not go to Mo=
unt Sinai, the peninsula=20

to which it now gives its name is not neglected. Mount Serbal, and what is =
generally regarded as=20

the Holy Mountain, are seen from the deck of the steamer, though some claim=
 that the former is=20

the scene of the delivery of the tablets of the Law to Moses. The captain o=
f the steamer does not=20

regard himself as a mere shipmaster; for in recommending the voyage for the=
 young millionaire,=20

he makes a great deal of its educational features, not alone for its opport=
unities for sight-seeing,=20

but for study and receiving instruction. As earnest in carrying out his ide=
a in the latter as well as=20

the former, he has made a lecture-room of the deck of the vessel.  The phys=
ical geography of the=20

regions passed through is considered, as well as the history; and as the sh=
ip=20
