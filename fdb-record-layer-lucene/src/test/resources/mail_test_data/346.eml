which on account of the rapid growth of the school soon gave way to larger =
quarters. The aim of=20

the institution was to train girls, all of whom "would become mothers or ho=
usehold servants, in=20

such solid virtues and religious and moral principles as modesty, honesty, =
and integrity."[2] To=20

reach this end they endeavored to supply the school with cultivated and cap=
able teachers.=20

Students were offered courses in all the branches of "refined and useful ed=
ucation, including all=20

that is regularly taught in well regulated female seminaries."[3] This scho=
ol was so well maintained=20

that it survived all reactionary attacks and became a center of enlightenme=
nt for colored women.=20

Methodist missionary, who was sent to Liberia. Prior to 1812 he had in Balt=
imore an academy=20

which certain students from Washington attended when they had no good schoo=

and when white persons began to object to the co-education of the races. Be=
cause of these=20

conditions two daughters of George Bell, the builder of the first colored s=
choolhouse in the District=20

of Columbia, went to Baltimore to study under Coker.[1] An adult Negro scho=
