philodendron monstera Sonya answered. "I presume this same charm is what endears her to the German children; it has kept the little French Louisa close beside her since we left France.

outside human being has a right to interfere? No, don't interrupt me until I finish," Sonya protested. 

"I realize that you are very seriously opposed to the least personal relation existing between any of 

your Red Cross nurses and physicians and so far we have been remarkably successful. But it has 

been more luck I think than my distinguished husband's objection to the possibility. One can't 

arrange, when young persons are more or less intimately associated with each other and living 

under the same roof, that they always maintain a friendly and yet highly impersonal attitude. Of 

course I also understand that you have great hopes for Hugh Raymond's future, and that as he is 

extremely poor you would dislike to see him marry a poor girl before his position is more assured. I 

also understand that neither you nor I especially like Thea Thompson. She has rather a curious 

history and is not herself an ordinary person. One thing I have noticed. At the beginning of their 

acquaintance it was Thea who made an effort to interest Hugh, since then I don't think she has 

been particularly interested in him. The interest has been on his side. It is to me rather unfortunate 

because Ruth Carroll might have liked Hugh, and, oh well, I must not speak of this! All I wished to 

say was that whatever our personal feeling in the matter it will be wiser, my dear husband, for you 

to say nothing to Hugh at present and for me to say nothing to Thea, which is what you rather had 

in mind to suggest. Moreover, nothing has so far developed between them for which you need 

have cause to worry! Thea told me the other day that she was happy here in of literacy are 

essential in clerical work."  "Then you're going to make these men take these tests, whatever they 

are?"  "If they want to work for me, yes. And anybody who fails to pass them will be dropped from 

my payroll."  "And who's going to decide whether or not these men have successfully passed 

these tests?" Crandall asked. "You?"  "Good Lord, no! I'm an electronics engineer, not a 

psychologist. The tests are being given, and will be evaluated, by a graduate psychologist, Dr. D. 

Warren Rives, who has a diploma from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and is a 

member of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Rives will be the final arbiter on who is or 

is not disqualified by these tests."  "Well, our man Koffler says you have some girl there to give the 

tests," Crandall accused.  "I suppose he means Dr. Rives," Melroy replied. "I can assure you, she 

is an extremely competent psychologist, however. She came to me most highly recommended by 

Dr. Karl von Heydenreich, who is not inclined to be careless with his recommendations."  "Well, 

Mr. Melroy, we don't want any more trouble with you than we have to have," Crandall told him, 

"but we will insist on reviewing any dismissals which occur as a result of these tests."  "You can do 

that. I'd advise, first, that you read over the contract you signed with me. Get a qualified lawyer to 

tell you what we've agreed to and what we haven't. Was there anything else you wanted to talk 

about?... No?... Then good morning, Mr. Crandall."  He hung up. "All right; let's get on with it," he 

said. "Ben, you get them into the lunch room; there are enough tables and 


_
strain of the hospital work, which she confesses was becoming a little hard to endure, by dancing 

with the soldiers at the Red Cross headquarters in her free hours. She has been helping one of 

the Red Cross managers, a Mrs. Adams, to teach some of the soldiers folk dancing. I believe she 

has a gift for it and the soldiers are getting a good deal of amusement out of their own efforts to 

learn. A good thing for all of them! We must remember our years and realize that young people 

need all kinds of relaxation."  "Thanks, Sonya, for including me along with your youthful self, even 

if we are in a class apart," Dr. Clark returned. "I wonder if you will be as severe with me 

concerning my other complaint. As a matter of fact I am ashamed of this myself and do not 

honestly consider it gravely. But you know we are in a curious position here in Coblenz. On the 

outside apparently everything is going well. As comfortable a relation as one could expect has 

been established between our former enemy and ourselves. Yet Coblenz is full of rumors. There is 

a very strong pro-Kaiser element in the city, which means there is a party deeply in opposition to 

all American thought and feeling and to the establishment of any new form of government in 

Germany which shall not include the Kaiser.  "The point of all this is that I insist there be no display 

even of conventional friendliness between any member of our Red Cross unit and a single 

German resident of Coblenz. The information has been brought to me that Nora Jamison, one of 

our own nurses, has been making friends with a group of German children. They meet her and the 

little French girl, Louisa, in one of the city parks every afternoon and there they play together. Of 

course, this appears innocent, but knowing the children in a too friendly fashion may mean 

knowing their families for everybody to take the written test in two relays."  "The union's gotta be 

represented while these tests is going on," the union steward announced. "Mr. Crandall says I'm to 

stay here an' watch what you do to these guys."  "This man working for us?" Melroy asked 

Puryear.  "Yes. Koffler, Julius. Electrical fitter; Joe Ricci's gang."  "All right. See to it that he gets 

placed in the first relay for the written test, and gets first turn for the orals. That way he can spend 

the rest of his time on duty here for the union, and will know in advance what the test is like." He 

turned to Koffler. "But understand this. You keep your mouth out of it. If you see anything that 

looks objectionable, make a note of it, but don't try to interfere."  The written tests, done on printed 

forms, required about twenty minutes. Melroy watched the process of oral testing and personal 

interviewing for a while, then picked up a big flashlight and dropped it into his overcoat pocket, 

preparatory to going out to inspect some equipment that had been assembled outside the reactor 

area and brought in. As he went out, Koffler was straddling a chair, glowering at Doris Rives and 

making occasional ostentatious notes on a pad.         *       *       *       *       *  For about an hour, he 

poked around the newly assembled apparatus, checking the wiring, and peering into it. When he 

returned to the temporary office, the oral testing was still going on; Koffler was still on duty as 

watcher for the union, but the sport had evidently palled on him, for he was now studying a comic 

book.  Melroy left the reactor area and returned to the office in the converted area. During the 

midafternoon, somebody named Leighton called him from the Atomic Power Authority executive 

office, wanting to know what was the trouble between him and the I.F.A.W. and saying 


_
our soldiers. No one seems to have been able to prevent their getting on intimate terms with every 

little Hans and Gretel who makes their acquaintance. But I do wish you would protest mildly to 

Miss Jamison. It is true that we know little of her history except that her credentials must have 

been against his alleged high-handed and arbitrary conduct had been received from the union. 

Melroy explained, at length. He finished: "You people have twenty Stuart tanks, and a couple of 

thousand soldiers and cops and undercover-men, here, guarding against sabotage. Don't you 

realize that a workman 


_
her form a part of our Red Cross unit rather on an impulse, when I learned Barbara Thornton was 

forced to return home. Besides, Miss Jamison herself attracted me. She has some unusual 

characteristic which I cannot exactly explain, but which nevertheless--"  "Ah, well, you need not try 

to explain it, David, because the thing is 'charm,' which I believe no one has successfully 

explained makes stupid or careless or impulsive mistakes is just as dangerous to the plant as any 

saboteur? If somebody shoots you through the head, it doesn't matter whether he planned to 

murder you for a year or just didn't know the gun was loaded; you're as dead one way as the 

other. I should think you'd thank me for trying to eliminate a serious source of danger."  "Now, 

don't misunderstand
