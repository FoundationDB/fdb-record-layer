hillock, run a trench through the middle of it, dig passages, and extend the interior space as widely 

as the site admits. Over it they build a pyramidal roof of logs fastened together, and this they cover 

with reeds and brushwood, heaping up very high mounds of earth above their dwellings. Thus 

their fashion in houses makes their winters very warm and their summers very cool. Some 

construct hovels with roofs of rushes from the swamps. Among other nations, also, in some places 

there are huts of the same or a similar method of construction. Likewise at Marseilles we can see 

roofs without tiles, made of earth mixed with straw. In Athens on the Areopagus there is to this day 

a relic of antiquity with a mud roof. The hut of Romulus on the Capitol is a significant reminder of 

the fashions of old times, and likewise the thatched roofs of temples or the Citadel.  6. From such 

specimens we can draw our inferences with regard to the devices used in the buildings of 

antiquity, and conclude that they were similar.  Furthermore, as men made progress by becoming 

daily more expert in building, and as their ingenuity was increased by their dexterity so that from 

habit they attained to considerable skill, their intelligence was enlarged by their industry until the 

more proficient adopted the trade of carpenters. From these early beginnings, and from the fact 

that nature had not only endowed the human race with senses like the rest of the animals, but had 

also equipped their minds with the powers of thought and understanding, thus putting all other 

animals under their sway, they next gradually advanced from the construction of buildings to the 

other arts and sciences, and so passed from a rude and barbarous mode of life to civilization and 

refinement.  7. Then, taking courage and looking forward from the standpoint of higher ideas born 

of the multiplication of the arts, they gave up huts and began to build houses with foundations, 

having brick or stone walls, and roofs of timber and tiles; next, observation and application led 

them from fluctuating and indefinite conceptions to definite rules of symmetry. Perceiving that 

nature had been lavish in the bestowal of timber and bountiful in stores of building material, they 

treated this like careful nurses, and thus developing the refinements of life, embellished them with 

luxuries. Therefore I shall now treat, to the best of my ability, of the things which are suitable to be 

used in buildings, showing their qualities and their excellencies.  8. Some persons, however, may 

find fault with the position of this book, thinking that it should have been placed first. I will therefore 

explain the matter, lest it be thought that I have made a whenever any copy of a Project
