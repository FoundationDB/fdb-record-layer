boy, you must accept us as your cousins.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy cousins!=E2=
=80=9D Ivan repeated. =E2=80=9CAh, madame, how=20

gladly! But I must entreat of you to explain to me my good fortune. It quit=
e bewilders me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI can=20

explain very easily. Your mother, Victoire de Talmont, was my husband=E2=80=
=99s much-loved cousin--nay,=20

his sister rather, for he was early left an orphan, and her father was as a=
 father to him. Her only=20

brother, Louis de Talmont, was as his brother, until that hateful revolutio=
nary madness seized=20

upon him, bringing misery and disunion into the household. It was her broth=
er=E2=80=99s influence made=20

Victoire give her hand to his friend, the fascinating young Russian, Prince=
 Pojarsky. I cannot deny=20

that this was a great sorrow to my husband, for Prince Pojarsky had embrace=
d the same opinions=20

as Louis de Talmont.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd did you know him, madame?=E2=80=
=9D Ivan asked eagerly. =E2=80=9CHave you ever=20

seen him?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI did not know him well. All this happened bef=
ore my own marriage. But I have seen=20

him more than once--a fine, brilliant young man, magnificent in dress and b=
earing, and very=20

handsome. You are like him; yet I think I see in you a stronger resemblance=
 to the features of=20

Victoire.=E2=80=9D  Madame de Talmont=E2=80=99s estimate of the young Russi=
an prince had not been very=20

favourable, though she naturally and properly expressed herself as kindly a=
s she could in=20

speaking to his son. But Cl=C3=A9mence had always beheld the half-mythical =
Victoire robed from head=20

to foot in shining garments, woven in the loom of her own youthful romance.=
 To see the son of=20

Victoire in the flesh seemed to be part of =E2=80=9Cthe stuff that dreams a=
re made of=E2=80=9D brought suddenly into=20

the realities of waking life. Breaking silence for the first time, she aske=
d,--  =E2=80=9CHave you any portrait=20

of your mother, monsieur?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI have never even seen one,=E2=
=80=9D Ivan answered. =E2=80=9CMy father=E2=80=99s ruin=20

robbed me of everything. The poor mujiks who sheltered me most kindly and m=
ost bravely--indeed=20

at the peril of their own lives--were unable to keep for me, out of all my =
father=E2=80=99s wealth, even the=20

smallest heirloom.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWe have a likeness of our cousin Vict=
oire, a pencil-sketch from the hand of=20

my father,=E2=80=9D Cl=C3=A9mence rejoined. =E2=80=9CWe must show it to you=
, monsieur.=E2=80=9D  Then Madame de Talmont=20

made some inquiries about his early history; and he answered modestly and w=
ith feeling. He dwelt=20

with much gratitude upon the kindness of his dear old friend Petrovitch, sa=
ying in conclusion, =E2=80=9CHe=20

taught me what a good father might be like.=E2=80=9D  At last it was necess=
ary to say farewell. The ladies=20

withdrew, promising a speedy renewal of their intercourse.  =E2=80=9CWould =
that I had a house of my own,=20

even the humblest,=E2=80=9D said Madame de Talmont to Cl=C3=A9mence, as the=
y returned home; =E2=80=9Cthe son of=20



Victoire should not lie ill another day in a public hospital. Thy father lo=
ved her well, Cl=C3=A9mence.=E2=80=9D=20

Perhaps there was a shade on the brow of the widow as she said this; but it=
 was a tender shade--

a long-past sorrow touched and softened into the calm of resignation.  When=
 they reached the=20

house of Madame de Salgues, they went at once to the parlour, where that la=
dy always sat; for,=20

kindly and tolerant though she was, she would not readily have forgiven the=
m if a surprising piece=20

of news had been kept from her a moment longer than was necessary. They fou=
nd her, however,=20

already engaged in hearing quite as much as was good for her, perhaps rathe=
r more.  A lad,=20

dressed in the uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique, seemed to have brought a=
 breath of modern air=20

into the quaint parlour, furnished as =E2=80=9Cpetits appartements=E2=80=9D=
 used to be in the days of Louis Quinze.=20

Emile de Salgues was seated before a table laden with every good thing in t=
he shape of food that=20

the house contained. When the ladies entered he was dividing his attention =
between two=20

occupations equally fascinating. He was exploring the depths of a P=C3=A9ri=
gord pie, and driving his=20

grandmother almost to distraction by a graphic account of the exploits and =
perils of the Polytechnic=20

scholars during the defence of Paris.  Madame de Salgues was really slight =
and small, but=20

enshrined in her own particular fauteuil, and arrayed with elaborate care i=
n her antique brocades=20

and laces, she looked dignified and even stately, while her manners exactly=
 suited her=20

surroundings, and seemed to lend them an added grace.  =E2=80=9CBe seated, =
my dear Rose, and you too,=20

Cl=C3=A9mence,=E2=80=9D she said to her nieces as they entered. =E2=80=9CYo=
u will both wish to hear what Emile has just=20

been telling me.=E2=80=9D  Emile=E2=80=99s narrative did not flow quite so =
easily in the presence of his cousins. He=20

sometimes had a shrewd suspicion that Madame de Talmont criticised and Cl=
=C3=A9mence laughed at=20

him; though this was hardly correct, because Cl=C3=A9mence in those days ha=
d little heart to laugh.=20

However, he resumed, after due exchange of greetings:--  =E2=80=9CI was jus=
t telling my grandmother how=20

we manned the guns at the Barri=C3=A8re du Tr=C3=B4ne, and sent a point-bla=
nk discharge into the midst of=20

Count Pahlen=E2=80=99s hussars. Then they charged us in flank; and, outnumb=
ered though we were, I think=20

I may say we gave them enough to do. It was a glorious fight! But as for my=
self, I thought my last=20

hour was come. I was=20
