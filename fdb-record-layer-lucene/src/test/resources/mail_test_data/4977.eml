[_Contemptuously._] He is a fool. [_To himself._] How is this maiden worthy=
 of the worship that we=20

pay a goddess! For now      Although I bade her enter, yet she seeks       =
To spare my poverty, nor=20

modest ear.                    56  [_Aloud._] Mistress Vasantasena, I have =
unwittingly made myself=20

guilty of an offense; for I greeted as a servant one whom I did not recogni=
ze. I bend my neck to=20

ask your pardon.  _Vasantasena._ It is I who have offended by this unseemly=
 intrusion. I bow my=20

head to seek your forgiveness.  _Maitreya._ Yes, with your pretty bows you =
two have knocked=20

your heads together, till they look like a couple of rice-fields. I also bo=

knee and beseech you both to stand up. [_He does so, then rises._]  _Charud=

delightfully clever hint! But it be suspected of heresy--were sequestrated.=
 The young Bishop of=20

Maillezais--his friend Geoffroy d'Estissac, who had aided his studies--and =
the great scholar Bude=20

came to his rescue, and passing first, by favour of the Pope, to the Benedi=
ctine abbey of=20

Maillezais, before long he quitted the cloister, and, as a secular priest, =
began his wanderings of a=20

scholar in search of universal knowledge. In 1530-31 he was at Montpellier,=
 studying medicine and=20

lecturing on medical works of Hippocrates and Galen; next year, at Lyons, o=
ne of the learned=20

group gathered around the great printers of that city, he practised his art=
 of physic in the public=20

hospital, and was known as a scientific author. Towards the close of 1532 h=
e re-edited the popular=20

romance _Chroniques Gargantuines_, which tells the adventures of the "enorm=
ous giant=20

Gargantua." It was eagerly read, and brought laughter to the lips of Master=
 Rabelais' patients.=20

Learning, he held, was good, but few things in this world are wholesomer th=
an laughter. The=20

success of the _Chroniques_ seems to have moved him to write a continuation=
, and in 1533=20


_
came hither. Well, I will at least say this much. [_Aloud._] If I am to rec=
eive thus much of your=20

favor, sir, I should be glad to leave these jewels in your house. It was fo=

_Pantagruel_, the story of the deeds and prowess of Gargantua's giant son, =
newly composed by=20

Alcofribas Nasier, an anagram which concealed the name of Francois Rabelais=
. It forms the=20

second of the five books which make up its author's famous work. A recast o=

creation of the Chronicles=20

entrusted, not to houses.  _Charudatta._ Maitreya, will you receive the jew=
els?  _Vasantasena._ I=20

am much indebted to you. [_She hands him the jewels._]  _Maitreya._ [_Recei=
ving them._]=20

Heaven bless you, madam.  _Charudatta._ Fool! They are only entrusted to us=
.  _Maitreya._=20

[_Aside._] Then the thieves may take them, for all I care.  _Charudatta._ I=
n a very short time--=20

_Maitreya._ What she has entrusted to us, belongs to us.  _Charudatta._ I s=
hall restore them.=20

_Vasantasena._ I should be grateful, sir, if this gentleman would accompany=

_Chroniques_, followed in 1535. It was not until 1546 and 1552 that the sec=

complete form--the third books of _Pantagruel_ appeared, and the authorship=
 was acknowledged.=20

The last book was posthumous (1562 in part, 1564 in full), and the inferior=
ity of style, together with=20

the more bitter spirit of its satire, have led many critics to the opinion =
that it is only in part from the=20

hand of the great and wise humourist.  Rabelais was in Rome in 1534, and ag=

physician to the French ambassador, Jean du Bellay, Bishop of Paris. He pur=
