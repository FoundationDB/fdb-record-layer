working parties are out all along their front lines at night--something's u=

expected at any time now. We have steel helmets to protect us and gills oli=

have no idea what a big part food plays in our life. Yesterday morning I we=
nt with the machine-gun=20

officer of another outfit to crawl about looking for positions. We were in =
an orchard. I happened to=20

look up and saw ripe plums! Terrified lest he should see them and forestall=
 me, I said, "Let's beat=20

it, this is too unhealthy," so we crawled back. Last night in the light of =
a big moon such as coons=20

plum tree. The section=20

officer, being large, stood underneath while the cook climbed the tree and =
dropped them into a=20

sandbag held open by the S.O. They got about ten pounds. They go well stewe=

fact that bullets whistled through the trees most of the time made them tas=

rest of the night in a hedge firing at the Boches with a Lewis gun. I struc=

The Huns' calendar is=20

 We use up the=20

important machine has attained its present perfection.  It will be recollec=
ted that as early as 1663,=20

the Marquis of Worcester published some obscure hints of a mechanical power=
 derived from the=20

elastic force of steam.  In 1669, Savary, availing himself of the suggestio=
n, and pursuing the=20

subject more scientifically, invented his engine, consisting of an apparatu=
s to cause a vacuum by=20

the condensation of steam, so that the water to be raised would thereupon, =
by the external weight=20

of the atmosphere, rise into the chamber of the apparatus, which the steam =
had occupied.  As=20
