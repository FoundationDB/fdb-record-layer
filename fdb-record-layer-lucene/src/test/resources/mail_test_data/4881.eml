The girls hurried down the road, all their drowsiness gone now. They were r=
ather alarmed in spite=20

of the cool way in which Cora took it.  "It's dreadfully warm walking," com=
plained Bess. "I shall=20

have to have more cream after this is over."  "You can go back and wait for=
 us," suggested Cora,=20

"if you're too----"  take out the Crop and the Merry-Thought, as it is call=

"There they come back!" cried Belle, in relieved tones.  But a moment later=
, as a machine swung=20

into view around the curve, the girls saw that it was not Cora's.  "But it'=
s Jack and Walter!" cried=20

the former's sister. "Wait! Stop!" she begged. "Jack--Wally--we're in troub=
le! Did you take our car?"=20

"Take your car?" repeated Jack, bringing his machine to a stop with a scree=
ching of brakes.=20

"What's the joke?"  "It isn't a joke at all!" declared Belle. "I saw two yo=
ung men making off with=20

Cora's car. At first we thought it might be you and Wally."  "Not guilty!" =
affirmed the latter, holding=20

up a protesting hand.  "Where did all this happen?" Jack wanted to know.  "=
At the Spinning Wheel=20

go?" asked Walter run=20

and the boney part of it must be quite taken out, and the Under-Jaw of the =
Fowl taken away;=20

between the Pinnion=20

and the lower Joint of the Wing, through the Body, near the Back, as at C, =
and it will be fit to roast=20

in the fashionable manner. _N.B._ Always mind to beat down the Breast-Bone,=
 and pick the Head=20
