 I wanted--oh, how much I wanted--to be only what Raoul believed me, just a=
 simple, true-hearted woman, with nothing to hide. It made me sick to think=
 that there was one thing I must always conceal from him, but I did the bes=
t I could. I vowed to myself that I'd break with the past, and I wrote a le=
tter to the British Foreign Secretary, who has always been a good friend of=
 mine. I said I was engaged, and hoped dracaena marginata of age.  "Is fath=

 be only what Raoul believed me, just a simple, true-hearted woman, with no=

ays conceal from him, but I did the best I could. I vowed to myself that I'=

y, who has always been a good friend of mine. I said I was engaged, and hop=
ed _
be thought strange and mean to do less than others; _none_ of that money is=
 given to God, so we=20

must not expect that God will accept it."  "Well, I grant ye this," said th=
e carpenter, "if every man's=20

almsgiving could be known only to himself and to God, there's many a one as=
 gives now would=20

keep his money snug in his pocket. But I'm not one of those, my good friend=
. I know, as we can=20

carry nothing out of the world, that it's best to have something laid up in=
 the bank above. But here=20

your way divides from my way,--you go down the dell, I keep to the road. Go=
od-day to you, Ned=20

Franks, let me know what you get from Bat Bell; I'll be bound 'twill be sle=
ight of hand--a skill which=20

only the smartest pickpocket in Europe could possess--why should a thief wh=
o had stolen my=20

letter-case give me instead a string of diamonds worth many thousands of po=
unds? If he wanted=20

to put something into my pocket of much the same size and shape as the thin=
g he stole, so that I=20

shouldn't suspect my loss, why didn't he slip in the red case _empty_, inst=
ead of containing the=20

necklace?"  "_This_ necklace, too, of all things in the world!" murmured Ma=
xine, lost in the=20

mystery. "It's like a dream. Yet here--by some miracle--it is, in our hands=
. And the treaty is gone."=20

"The treaty is gone," I repeated, miserably.  It was=20


_
Hall to-day, but measuring and fitting, so maybe I'll be back before you re=
turn; just drop in at my=20

shop and tell me what's your success;" and with a friendly nod and complace=
nt smile, the=20

carpenter went along the high road, while the school-master turned down the=
 little wooded lane=20

which led to the mill.  "I should have liked to have had a little longer ta=
lk with Ben Stone," thought=20

Franks. "I'm afraid that he thinks that he is actually _buying_ God's favor=
, and _earning_ heaven,=20

by the little kind acts that he does! That's a kind of error which so many =
people run foul of. The=20

sunken rock of self-righteousness is, maybe, just as dangerous as the sandb=
ank of love of money.=20

I must have a care that I don't take to judging others, and so split on it =
myself. I spoke very hardly=20

yester-evening of Bat Bell the miller, yet, when I consider what a poor wre=
tched sinner I am,=20

receiving so much from God, and showing my gratitude in such a poor way, I'=
m scarce likely to run=20

on that rock. When one measures one's little drop of charity, and even that=
 not pure, with the great=20

unfathomable ocean of love of Him who gave his life-blood for us, one is fa=
r more inclined to yet it=20

almost killed her to hear them from me. No doubt it gave the dreadful fact =
a kind of inevitability.=20

She flung herself down on the sofa with a groan, her face buried in her han=
ds.  "My God, what a=20

punishment!" she stammered. "I've ruined the man I risked everything to sav=
e. I will go to the=20

theatre, and I will act to-night, my friend, but unless you can give me bac=
k what is lost, when to-

morrow morning comes, I shall be out of the world."  "Don't say that," I im=
plored, sick with pity for=20

her and shame at my failure. "All hope isn't over yet; it can't be. I'll th=
ink this out. There must be a=20

solution. There must be a way of laying hold of what _seems_ to be gone. If=
 by giving my life I=20

could get it, I assure you I wouldn't hesitate for an instant, now: so you =
see, there's nothing I won't=20

do to help you. Only, I wish the path could be made a little plainer for me=
--unless for some reason=20

it's necessary for you to keep me in the dark. The word 'treaty' I heard fo=
r the first time from you. I=20

didn't know what I was bringing you, except that it was a document of inter=
national importance,=20

and that you'd been helping the British Foreign Secretary--perhaps=20


_
for doing so little, than to expect reward for doing so much. There's nothi=
ng that _can_ give the=20

best of us any claim to the least of God's mercies, but the merits of Chris=
t. That is a truth that I see=20

the more plainly the longer I live. To attempt to hold by one's own merits =
would be like trying to go=20

to sea in a bark made of gossamer threads. The gossamer web looks goodly en=
ough when the=20

sunbeams are glinting upon it, and the dew-drops are nestling in it, but no=
 man in his senses=20

would trust his life to its power to bear up his weight. It would be a madd=
er thing still for him to trust=20

his soul's salvation to his own merits. If any mortal had anything in himse=
lf to boast of or to trust to,=20

that mortal was St. Paul, who was ready to spend and to be spent; who had _=
suffered the loss of=20

all things_ for God,--a very different kind of self-denial from what we dar=
e to call by that name,--

and yet what was the feeling of St. Paul? Did he think thus he had earned h=
eaven? Did he not say,=20

_God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ_=
? If we were to strip=20

ourselves of all that we have, if we were to give away health and time and =
life itself for God's=20

service, we should never get beyond that verse, we should have nothing wher=
eof to boast, nothing=20

(out of Christ) whereon to rest."  Ned had now descended to the bottom of a=
 beautiful little dell,=20

through which gushed a rapid stream of water, turning the large wheel of Be=
ll's manoeuvre of high=20

politics. He said that, so far as he was concerned, you might tell me more =
if you liked. He left it to=20

you. That was his message."  "Then I will tell you more!" Maxine exclaimed.=
 "It will be better to do=20

so. I know that it will make it easier for you to help me. The document you=
 were bringing me was a=20

treaty--a quite new treaty between Japan, Russia and France: not a copy, bu=
t the original. England=20

had been warned that there was a secret understanding between the three cou=
ntries, unknown to=20

her. There was no time to make a copy. And I stole the real treaty from Rao=
ul du Laurier, to whom=20

I am engaged--whom I adore, Ivor, as I didn't know it was in me to adore an=
y man. You know his=20

name, perhaps--that he's Under Secretary in the Foreign Office, here in Par=
is. Oh, I can read in=20

your eyes what you're thinking of me, now. You can't think worse of me than=
 I think of myself. Yet I=20

did the thing for Raoul's sake. There's that in my defence--only that."  "I=
 don't understand," I said,=20

trying not to show the horror of Maxine's treachery to a man who loved and =
trusted her, which I=20

could not help feeling.  "How could you?--except that I've betrayed him! Bu=
t I'll tell you everything--

I'll go back a long way. Then you'll pity me, even if you scorn me, too. Yo=
u'll work for me--to save=20

me, and him. For years I've helped the British Government. Oh, I won't spar=
e myself. I've been a=20

spy, sometimes against one Power, sometimes against another.=20


_
monotonous clack did not mingle with the gurgle of the brook and the song o=
f the birds. Franks=20

had many delightful associations connected with that wooded dell; for there=
 stood the cottage in=20

which Persis, as a maiden, had dwelt with her aged grandfather; it was ther=
e that he had wooed=20

and won her; from that little ivy-mantled nest he had, three years before, =
taken his bride to church.=20

The cottage had now other inhabitants, but Franks could not pass the spot w=
ithout stooping to=20

pluck a violet to carry back to his wife.  "I'll give this to Persis," he s=
aid to himself; "she'll like a=20

flower from the old home, though, thank God, I believe that she has never r=
egretted leaving it for=20

the new one. This much I can answer for, leastways, that every day since th=
at happy one on which=20

God gave her to me has made me prize his gift more dearly."     V.  An Appe=
al.   Bat Bell was a=20

particular man, regular and precise in all his ways, who had, as it were, s=
tiffened into his own=20

mould, especially since the death of his wife, and who did not choose, as h=
e often said, "to be put=20

out for nobody." Bell hated a visitor at work-time, and he was so keen afte=
r making money that his=20

work-time began early and ended late. was anything to do against Russia, I =
was always glad,=20

because my dear father was a Pole, and you know how Poles feel towards Russ=
ia. Russia ruined=20

his life, and stripped it of everything worth having, not only money, but--=
oh, well, that's not in this=20

story of mine! I won't trouble you or waste time in the telling. Only, when=
 I was a very young girl, I=20

was already the enemy of all that's Russian, with a big debt of revenge to =
pay. And I've been=20

paying it, slowly. Don't think that the money I've had for my work--hateful=
 work often--has been=20

used for myself. It's been for my father's country--poor, sad country--ever=
y shilling of English coin.=20

As an actress I've supported myself, and, as an actress, it has been easier=
 for me to do the other=20

secret work than it would have been for a woman leading a more sheltered li=
fe, mingling less with=20

distinguished persons of different countries, or unable to be eccentric wit=
hout causing scandal. As=20

for France, she's the friend of Russia, and I haven't a drop of French bloo=
d in my veins, so, at=20

least, I've never been treacherous to my own people. Oh, I have made some g=
reat _coups_ in the=20

last eight or nine years, Ivor!... for I began before I was sixteen, and no=
w=20


_
hated a visitor at meal-time, probably because he did not wish any one to s=
hare his meal. Franks=20

was aware of this, and tried so to time his visit to the mill that he shoul=
d catch Bell in that half-hour=20

of rest which usually followed his early dinner.  "He'll be giving her news=
 of the most vital=20

importance. You're shocked to hear what my inner life has been?"  "If I wer=
e shocked, no doubt=20

the feeling would be more than half conventional. One hardly knows how conv=
entional one's=20

opinions are until one stops to think," said=20


_
nothing on earth that softens and opens a man's heart like hearing the voic=
e of his own little child,=20

or dancing it on his knee." Such was the conclusion to which the school-mas=
ter came after his four=20

weeks' experience of the feelings of a father.  Franks, however, found litt=
le Bessy, not with her=20

parent, but amusing herself in the lane close by the mill. She ran up to hi=
m with open arms, and=20

held up her little face for a kiss, for Ned was a prime favorite with every=
 child who knew him, and,=20

during her mother's last illness, Bessy had spent a week at a time under th=
e care of the Franks.=20

She was a plump, rosy-cheeked, merry  "Once, I gloried in the work," Maxine=
 went on. "But that=20

was before I fell in love. You and I have played a little at being in love,=
 but that was to pass the=20

time. Both of us were flirting. I'd never met Raoul then, and I've never re=
ally loved any man except=20

him. It came at first sight, for me: and when he told me that he cared, he =
said it had begun when=20

he first saw me on the stage; so you see it is as if we were meant for each=
 other. From the=20

moment I gave him my promise, I promised myself that the old work should be=
 given up for ever:=20

Raoul's _fiancee_, Raoul's wife, should not be the tool of diplomatists. Be=
sides, as=20
