dracaena marginata wealth. Have we not fought," he continued with a grandiloquent gesture, "for equality of fortune as well as of privileges...."  A sardonic laugh from the reply, and that this was the style of humour he appreciated so highly in his young friend.  We civilised people may wonder a little at the dracaena marginata wealth. Have we not fought," he continued with a grandiloquent gesture, "for equality of fortune as well as of privileges...."  A sardonic laugh from the reply, and that this was the style of humour he appreciated so highly in his young friend.  We civilised people may wonder a little at the _
door--the terrier guarding his master.  Carrier laughed loud and long. It was a hideous, strident 

laugh which had not a tone of merriment in it.  "Wake up, friend Martin-Roget," he said harshly, "I 

bear no malice: I am a good dog when I am treated the right way. But if anyone pulls my tail or 

treads on my paws, why! I snarl and growl of course. If the offence is repeated ... I bite ... 

remember that; and now let us resume our discourse, though I confess I am getting tired of your 

Kernogan rabble."  While the great man spoke, Martin-Roget had succeeded in pulling himself 

together. His throat felt parched, his hands hot and moist: he was like a man who had been 

stumbling along a road in the dark and been suddenly pulled up on the edge of a yawning abyss 

into which he had all but fallen. With a few harsh words, with a monstrous insult Carrier had made 

him feel the gigantic power which could hurl any man from the heights of self-assurance and of 

ambition to the lowest depths of degradation: he had shown him the glint of steel upon the 

guillotine.  He had been hit as with a sledge-hammer--the blow hurt terribly, for it had knocked all 

his self-esteem into nothingness and pulverised his self-conceit. It had in one moment turned him 

into a humble and cringing sycophant.  "I had no mind," he began tentatively, "to give offence. My 

thoughts were bent on the Kernogans. They are a fine haul for us both, citizen Carrier, and I 

worked hard and long to obtain their confidence over in England and to induce them to come with 

me to smile, "what a lot you manage to say sometimes with nothing in it."  "Ha! ha!--ho! ho! what a 

wag you're becoming, Little Bill.  But I thank 'ee for the compliment, for you know it's only 

philosophers that can say an awful lot without a'most sayin' anything at all.  Look at Oke there, 

now, what a depth of stupidity lies behind his brown visage; what bucketsful of ignorance swell out 

his black pate, but he expresses it all in the single word `Waugh!' because he's a philosopher.  If 

he was like La Certe, he'd jabber away to us by the hour of things he knows nothin' about, and tell 

us long stories that are nothin' less than big lies.  I'm glad you think me a philosopher, Little Bill, for 

it takes all the philosophy I've got to keep me up to the scratch of goin' about the world wi' you on 

my back.  Why, I'm a regular Sindbad the Sailor, only I'm saddled with a young man o' the plains 

instead of an old man of the sea.  D'ee understand what I'm saying, Oke?"  The chief, who 

understood little more than that his own name and that of La Certe were mentioned, nodded his 

head gravely and allowed the corners of his mouth to droop, which was his peculiar way of 

smiling--a smile that might have been unintelligible to his friends had it not been relieved and 

interpreted by a decided twinkle in his eyes.  While they were conversing, the two canoes had 

rounded a rocky point and swept out upon a lake-like expanse in the river, which was perfectly 

smooth and apparently currentless.  Several islets studded its calm breast and were reflected 


_
"No one denies that you have done well," retorted Carrier gruffly and not yet wholly pacified. "If the 

haul had not been worth having you would have received no help from me."  "I have shown my 

gratitude for your help, citizen Carrier. I would show it again ... more water's edge, and from 

among the sedges near their margin several flocks of wild-fowl sprang up in alarm and went off in 

fluttering confusion.  It chanced that just then a trumpet-like note was heard overhead, as a flock 

of wild geese passed the spot and came suddenly close 


_
He spoke slowly and quite deferentially but the suggestion was obvious. Carrier looked up into his 

face: the light of measureless cupidity--the cupidity of the coarse-grained, enriched peasant--

glittered in his pale eyes. It was by a great effort of will that he of the canoes which had been 

concealed from them by the bushes that fringed the river.  Guns were seized at once by the 

bowmen in each canoe, but Archie was smarter than Fergus.  Before the Highlander had got the 

weapon well into his hands the boy fired and one of the

his eagerness beneath his habitual air of lofty condescension:  "Eh? What?" he queried airily.  "If 

another five thousand francs is of any use to you...."  "You seem passing rich, citizen Martin-

Roget," sneered Carrier.  "I have slaved and saved for four years. What I have amassed I will 

sacrifice for the completion of my revenge."  "Well!" rejoined Carrier with an expressive wave of 

the hand, "it heavy plunge.  Little Bill signalised the successful shot with a high-toned cheer, and 

the Indian with a low-toned "Waugh," while Fergus made a hurried and therefore bad, shot at the 

scared flock.  "That wass a fery good shot, Archie," remarked Fergus, as the canoes ranged up 

alongside of the dead bird.  "Yours was a very good one, too, Fergus," returned the boy; "only not 

quite straight."  The smile
