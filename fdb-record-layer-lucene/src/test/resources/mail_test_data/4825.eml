philodendron monstera was a dream. The traditional form of this wonderful v=
ision may be read in any life of Mohammad, and though it is doubtless very =
different from the story the Prophet himself gave, it is still a grand visi=
on, full of glorious imagery, fraught with deep meaning.  Again the time of=
 pilgrimage came round, and again Mohammad also seen White Tail reach forwa=
rd and grab or push him. They couldn=E2=80=99t very well say just what he d=
id.  But Black Buck, seeing that his son had failed, and angry at the thoug=
ht of White Tail=E2=80=99s triumph, was quick to see a way to change defeat=
 into triumph. Before his son could recover his breath and stop his trembli=

asunder by party jealousies.  When the time of pilgrimage again came round,=
 Mohammad waited=20

at the appointed place in a secluded glen, and there met him men from the t=
wo pagan tribes of=20

Yethrib--the clans of Khazraj and Aws--ten from one and two from the other.=
 They told him of the=20

willingness of their people to embrace Islam, and their hope to make ready =
the city for his=20

welcome. They plighted their faith with him in these words: 'We will not wo=
rship save one God; we=20

will not steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill our children; we will in nowi=
se slander, nor will we=20

disobey the prophet in anything that is right.' This is the first pledge of=
 the 'Akabeh.  The twelve=20

men of Yethrib went back and preached Islam to their people. 'So prepared w=
as the ground, so=20

zealous the propagation, and so apt the method, that the new faith spread r=
apidly from house to=20

house and from tribe to tribe. The Jews looked on in amazement at the peopl=
e, whom they had in=20

vain endeavoured for generations to convince of the errors of Polytheism an=
d dissuade from the=20

abominations of idolatry, suddenly and of their own accord casting away the=
ir idols and professing=20

belief in God alone.' They asked Mohammad to send them a teacher versed in =
the Kur-an, so=20

anxious were they to know Islam truly; and Mus'ab was sent, and taught them=
 and conducted their=20

worship; so that Islam took deep root at Yethrib.  Meanwhile Mohammad was s=
till among the=20

Kureysh at Mekka. His is now an attitude of waiting; he is listening for ne=
ws from his distant=20

converts. Resting his hopes upon them, and despairing of influencing the Me=
kkans, he does not=20

preach so much as heretofore. He holds his peace mainly, and bides his time=
. One hears little of=20

this interval of quietude. Islam seems  There was nothing for Young Black B=
uck to do but take the=20

jump. All eyes were turned on him. For the first time a feeling of fear pos=
sessed him. He had=20

looked down the chasm, and knew what waited him if he fell short. Suppose h=
e should make a=20

false step or stumble at the last moment. The fall would be terrible. If no=
t actually killed, he would=20

break his legs at the very least.  Black Buck saw the expression of fear in=
 his son=E2=80=99s eyes, and=20

whispered to him: =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t look below! Keep your eyes up and =
ahead!=E2=80=9D  Young Black Buck gathered=20

himself for the short run, and long jump. He knew that he had to take it, a=
nd that he had to=20

succeed. He ran with all his might, and then sprang forward in a quick spri=
ng.  If it hadn=E2=80=99t been for=20

his nervousness, he certainly would have cleared the chasm without accident=
, but chagrin, anger=20

and fear had possession of him, and they were responsible for a misstep at =
the last moment.=20

When his body was launched through the air, he knew that he hadn=E2=80=99t =
put in the jump all the power=20

he had.  Then too the fear of a failure alarmed him. He glanced down, and s=
aw the terrible chasm=20

yawning below to receive him. This gave his body a side lurch, and instead =
of clearing the chasm=20

in a beautiful jump his forefeet touched the opposite side only a foot from=
 the edge, and his hind=20

hoofs missed it by an inch.  No one could see the accident so quickly or pl=
ainly as White Tail, who=20

stood within a few feet of him. He saw that Young Black Buck was going to m=
iss before his front=20

hoofs touched the embankment.  Now the thought of his missing the rock, and=
 falling to the bottom=20

of the chasm in a broken heap, horrified White Tail so that he forgot all h=
is triumph and desire to=20

win. His greatest desire was to save Young Black=20

e a waiting look, as=20

though there were something at hand.  It was during this year of expectatio=
n that the Prophet's=20

celebrated 'Night Journey' took place. This Mi'raj has been the subject of =
extravagant=20

embellishments on the part of the traditionists and commentators, and the c=
ause of much obloquy=20

to the Prophet from his religious opponents. Mohammad dreamed a dream, and =
referred to it=20

briefly and obscurely in the Kur-an. His followers persisted in believing i=
t to have been a reality--an=20

ascent to heaven in the body--till Mohammad was sick of repeating his  Befo=

his feet, and jerked backward with all his strength.  It was enough to over=
come the balance of the=20

frightened jumper. Instead of falling backward into the chasm, he stumbled =
forward, and then=20

catching his hind hoofs on the edge he managed to climb up the embankment. =
