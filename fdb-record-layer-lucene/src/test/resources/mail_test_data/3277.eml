length and thickness, providing them with correspondingly large bolts at the top, and windlasses 

turning at the bottom. When these are ready, let forestays be attached and left lying slack in front; 

let the backstays be carried over the shoulders of the machine to some distance, and, if there is 

nothing to which they can be fastened, sloping piles should be driven, the ground rammed down 

all round to fix them firmly, and the ropes made fast to them.  4. A block should then be attached 

by a stout cord to the top of the machine, and from that point a rope should be carried to a pile, 

and to a block tied to the pile. Let the rope be put in round the sheave of this block, and brought 

back to the block that is fastened at the top of the machine. Round its sheave the country place. In 

the evening, when we were drinking tea, the cook put on the table a plateful of gooseberries. They 

were not bought, but his own gooseberries, gathered for the first time since the bushes were 

planted. Nikolay Ivanovitch laughed and looked for a minute in silence at the gooseberries, with 

tears in his eyes; he could not speak for excitement. Then he put one gooseberry in his mouth, 

looked at me with the triumph of a child who has at last received his favourite toy, and said:  "'How 

delicious!'  "And he ate them greedily, continually repeating, 'Ah, how delicious! Do taste them!' 

"They were sour and unripe, but, as Pushkin says:       "'Dearer to us the falsehood that exalts 

Than hosts of baser truths.'  "I saw a happy man whose cherished

go down from the top, and back to the windlass, which is at the bottom of the machine, and there 

be fastened. The windlass is now to be turned by means of the handspikes, and it will raise the 

machine of itself without danger. Thus, a machine of the larger kind will be set in position, with its 

ropes in their places about it, and its stays attached to the piles. Its blocks and traction ropes are 

arranged as described above.  5. But if the loads of material for the work are still more colossal in 

size and weight, we shall not entrust them to a windlass, but set in an axle-tree, had attained his 

object in life, who had gained what he wanted, who was satisfied with his fate and himself. There 

is always, for some reason, an element of sadness mingled with my thoughts of human happiness, 

and, on this occasion, at the sight of a happy man I was overcome by an oppressive feeling that 

was close upon despair. It was particularly oppressive at night. A bed was made up for me in the 

room next to my brother's bedroom, and I could hear that he was awake, and that he kept getting 

up and going to the plate of gooseberries and taking one. I reflected how many

centre a large drum, which some term a wheel, but the Greeks call it [Greek: amphiesis] or [Greek: 

perithekion].  6. And the blocks in such machines are not arranged in the same, but in a different 

manner; for the rows of sheaves in them are doubled, both at the bottom and at the top. The 

traction rope is passed through a hole in the lower block, in such a way that the two ends of the 

rope are of equal length when it is stretched out, and both suffocating force it is! You look at life: 

the insolence and idleness of the strong, the ignorance and brutishness of the weak, incredible 

poverty all about us, overcrowding, degeneration, drunkenness, hypocrisy, lying.... Yet all is calm 

and stillness in the houses and in the streets; of the fifty thousand living in a town, there is not one 

who would cry out, who would give vent to his indignation aloud. We see the people going to 

market for 


_
at the lower block by a cord which is passed round them and lashed so that they cannot come out 

either to the right or the left. Then the ends of the rope are brought up into the block at the top 

from the outside, and passed down over its lower sheaves, and so return to the bottom, and are 

passed from the inside to the sheaves in the lowest block, and then are brought up on the right 

and left, and return to the top and round the highest set of sheaves.  7. Passing over these from 

the outside, they are then carried to the right and left of the drum on the axle-tree, and are tied 

there so as night, talking their silly nonsense, getting married, growing old, serenely escorting their 

dead to the cemetery; but we do not see and we do not hear those who suffer, and what is terrible 

in life goes on somewhere behind the scenes.... Everything is quiet and peaceful, and nothing 

protests but mute statistics: so many people gone out of their minds, so many gallons of vodka 

drunk, so many children dead from malnutrition.... And this order of things is evidently necessary; 

evidently the happy man only feels at ease because the unhappy bear their burdens in silence, 

and without that

stay fast. Then another rope is wound round the drum and carried to a capstan, and when that is 

turned, it turns the drum and the axle-tree, the ropes get taut as they wind round regularly, and 

thus they raise the loads smoothly and with no danger. But if a larger drum is placed either in the 

middle or at one side, without any capstan, men can tread in it and accomplish the work more 

impossible. It's a case of general hypnotism. There ought to be behind the door of every happy, 

contented man some one standing with a hammer continually reminding him with a tap that there 

are unhappy people; that however happy he may be, life will show him her laws sooner or later, 

trouble will come for him--disease, poverty, losses, and no one will see or hear, just as now he 

neither sees
