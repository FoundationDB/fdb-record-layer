philodendron monstera remember that which is contained in it, _to do according thereto_: peradventure ye will fear _the Fire, or acts of disobedience_.--Then ye turned back after that; and had it not been for the grace of God towards you and His mercy, ye had my sister in Christ, rather than my spouse, had taken the veil.

When this happened Abelard bestirred himself to provide for Heloise and philodendron monstera remember that which is contained in it, _to do according thereto_: peradventure ye will fear _the Fire, or acts of disobedience_.--Then ye turned back after that; and had it not been for the grace of God towards you and His mercy, ye had my sister in Christ, rather than my spouse, had taken the veil. Having obtained possession, he expelled the congregation of nuns, of whom my companion was prioress." When this happened Abelard bestirred himself to provide for Heloise and _
the family of Pharaoh with dearth and with scarcity of fruits, that they might be admonished _and 

might believe_. But when good betided them, they said, This is ours:--_that is, we deserve it;--and 

they were not grateful for it_; and if evil befell them, they ascribed it to the ill luck of Moses and 

those _believers_ who were with him. Nay, their ill luck was only with God: _He brought it upon 

them_: but the greater number of them know not _this_. And they said _unto Moses_, Whatsoever 

sign thou bring unto us, to enchant us therewith, we will not believe in thee. _So he uttered an 

imprecation upon them_, and We sent upon them the flood, _which entered their houses and 

reached to the throats of the persons sitting, seven days_,[283] and the locusts, _which ate their 

corn and their fruits_, and the kummal, _or grubs, or a kind of tick, which sought after what the 

locusts had left_, and the frogs, _which filled their houses and their food_, and the blood _in their 

waters_; distinct signs: but they were proud, _refusing to believe in them_, and were a wicked 

people. And when the punishment fell upon them, they said, O Moses, supplicate for us thy Lord, 

according to that which He hath covenanted with thee, _namely that He will withdraw from us the 

punishment if we believe_: verily, if thou remove from us the punishment, we will assuredly believe 

thee, and we will assuredly send with thee the children of Israel. But when We the man's mental 

attitude: "Understand, that you may believe." Abelard found, like hundreds of others who have 

proceeded in this way, that his reason could not account, to its own satisfaction, for all the things 

called of faith. He was constantly allowing himself to be led on in discussion until he found himself 

confronted with a dilemma: either to follow logic still further and end in infidelity, or to silence, as 

best he could, the voice of reason by an appeal to authority and to faith. On the present occasion it 

was an utterance on the dogma of the Trinity that his enemies seized upon. The leaders of the 

persecution were two former classmates, who now intrigued against him. Without examining him, 

without giving him a chance to discuss, justify, or explain his doctrine, a council, assembled at 

Soissons in 1121, condemned his book, not so much for what it taught, as because the author had 

presumed to teach theology without definite authority from the Church. Summoned before the 

council--the decision had been reached and the trial conducted without his presence--Abelard was 

forced to throw his book into the flames. As a confession of faith he was made to recite the 

Athanasian creed, and, to humiliate him still further, they brought him the text, as if he could not 

recite from memory that which was known by every child. The man's overwrought nature gave 

way under this last exhibition of petty malice. He tells us: "I 


_
removed from them the punishment until a period at which they should arrive, lo, they brake their 

promise. Wherefore We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea, because they 

charged our signs with falsehood and were heedless of them. And We caused the people who had 

been rendered weak, _by being enslaved_, to inherit the eastern parts of the earth and its western 

parts,[284] which we blessed _with water and trees, (namely Syria)_; and the gracious word of thy 

Lord was fulfilled on the children of Israel, because they had been patient; and We destroyed the 

_structures_ which Pharaoh and his people had built and what they had erected.[285]     (vii. 124-

133.)   We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his troops pursued them 

with violence and hostility, until, when drowning overtook him, he said, I believe that there is no 

deity but He in whom the children of Israel believe, and I am [one] of the Muslims. _But Gabriel 

thrust into his mouth some of the mire of the sea, lest mercy should be granted him, and said_, 

Now _thou believest_, and thou hast been rebellious hitherto, and wast [one] of the corrupters. But 

to-day we will raise thee with thy lifeless body _from the sea_, that thou mayest be a sign unto 

those [who shall come] after thee. (_It is related, on the authority of Ibn-'Abbas, that some of the 

children of Israel doubted his death; wherefore he was brought forth to them that they might see 

him._)[286] But verily many men are heedless of Our signs.     (x. 90-92.)   And We brought the 

children of Israel across the sea; and they came unto a people who gave themselves up to _the 

worship of_ idols belonging to them;[287] [whereupon] they said, O Moses, make for us a god 

(_an idol for us to worship_), like as they have gods. He replied, Verily ye are a people who are 

ignorant, _since ye have requited God's favour towards you with that which ye have said_; for that 

[religion] in which these are [occupied shall be] destroyed, and vain is that which they do. He said, 

Shall I seek for you any other deity than God, when He hath preferred you above the peoples _of 

your time_?     (vii. 134-136.)   And We caused the thin clouds to shade you _from the heat of the 

sun in the desert_, and caused the manna and the quails[288] to descend upon you, _and said_, 

Eat of the good things which We have given you for food, _and store not up.--But they were 

ungrateful for the benefit, and stored up; wherefore it was cut off from them_. And they injured not 

Us _thereby_; but they did injure their own souls.     (ii. 54.)   [Remember, O children of Israel,] 

when ye said, O Moses, we will not bear patiently the having one _kind of_ food, _the manna and 

the quails_; therefore supplicate for us thy Lord, that He may produce for us _somewhat_ of that 

which the earth bringeth forth, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its wheat and its lentils and its 

onions:--he said _unto them_, Will ye take in exchange that which is worse for that which is 

better?--_But they refused to recede; therefore he supplicated God, and He said_, Get ye down 

into a great city;[289] for ye shall have _therein_ what ye have asked.--And the _marks of_ 

abjection and poverty were stamped upon them: _so these characteristics necessarily belong to 

them, even if they are rich, as necessarily as the stamped coin belongeth to its die_; and they 

returned with indignation from God. This was because they did disbelieve in the signs of God, and 

slay the prophets (_as Zechariah and John_) unjustly: this was because they rebelled and did 

transgress.     (ii. 58.)   And _remember_ when I could for sobs and tears." He was then delivered 

to the abbot of Saint-Medard to be confined to the monastery for an indefinite period.  He soon 

obtained permission to return to Saint-Denis, but here his tongue once more got him into trouble. 

The patron saint of the abbey, the patron saint of all France, was Saint Denis, whom the ignorant 

monks of the abbey, jealous of the dignity of their patron, identified with Dionysius the Areopagite, 



the convert of Saint Paul. Abelard pointed out to them a passage in Bede which proved the whole 

thing a legend. Abelard was perfectly right, but in the eyes of his brother monks he was certainly a 

traitor, probably an emissary of the devil. His life at Saint-Denis becoming unbearable, he fled at 

night to Champagne, and, after some little opposition, was permitted to retire to a desert place not 

far from Troyes. Here he built an oratory of reeds and thatch, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and 

here he dwelt as a hermit. But even here pupils sought him out. To gain his living, he opened a 

school; and the desert gave birth to scores of little huts and tents, in which his eager hearers lived. 

His own little oratory being too small to accommodate the crowds, the students built for him a new 

and larger temple, which, in gratitude for the consolation he had found here, he dedicated to the 

Trinity and named Paraclete, in honor of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.  But he was tormented by 

new dangers, or at least by new fears. A nature so hypersensitive perhaps conjured up hobgoblins 

of persecution out of pure imagination. "I could not hear of an assemblage of churchmen without 

thinking that its object was to condemn me." He even cherished the idea of flying from 

Christendom, to live among the infidels. When the abbacy of Saint-Gildas de Rhuys, a remote 

place on the coast of Brittany, was offered to him, he hastened to accept, thinking that if he gave 

up teaching the persecution would cease. This was about 1128, and for nearly ten years Abelard 

struggled on there. It was a struggle, for he found the monks not only undisciplined, and given to 

licentious pleasures, but positively criminal. One gets a picture of the abbot and the abbey in 

Longfellow's _Golden Legend_, where Lucifer, in the guise of a monk, gets into the refectory of the 

convent of Hirschau and tells the monks how much more delightful is life in his own abbey of 

Saint-Gildas de Rhuys:          From the gray rocks of Morbihan         It overlooks the angry sea; 

The very sea-shore where,         In his great despair,         Abbot Abelard walked to and fro, 

Filling the night with woe,         And wailing aloud to the merciless seas         The name of his 

sweet Heloise!         Whilst overhead         The convent windows gleamed as red         As the fiery 

eyes of the monks within,         Who with jovial din         Gave themselves up to all kinds of sin!. 

Abelard!...         He was a dry old fellow....         There he stood,         Lowering at us in sullen 

mood,         As if he had come into Brittany         Just to reform our brotherhood!...         Well, it 

finally came to pass         That, half in fun and half in malice,         One Sunday at Mass         We 

put some poison into the chalice.         But, either by accident or design,         Peter Abelard kept 

away         From the chapel that day,         And a poor, young friar, who in his stead         Drank the 

sacramental wine,         Fell on the steps of the altar, dead!  The facts here presented are 

essentially the same as those vouched for by Abelard himself, even to the poisoning of 


_
thirsty in the desert_, and We said, Strike with thy rod the stone. (_It was the stone that fled away 

with his garment:[290] it was light, square, like the head of a man, marble or kedhdhan._[291]) 

_Accordingly he struck it_; and there gushed out from it twelve fountains, _according to the 

number of the tribes_, all men (_each tribe of them_) knowing their drinking-place. _And We said 

unto them_, Eat ye and drink of the supply of God, and commit not evil in the earth, acting 

corruptly.     (ii. 57.)   _Remember_ also when We obtained your bond _that ye would do according 

to that which is contained in the Law_, and _had_ lifted up over you the mountain [namely Mount 

Sinai], _pulled it up by the roots and raised it over you when ye had refused to accept the Law, 

and We said_, Receive that which We have given you, with resolution, two attempts of this kind, 

and the wicked monks also hired assassins to waylay their abbot, who lived in constant terror of 

his life. He strove to control his monks by every sort of means, but at length was forced to fly to the 

protection of a friend in Brittany. He did not definitely abandon his abbey for some time, probably 

not before 1138; but his regular connection with it ceased some years earlier.  The years of his 

struggle with the monks of St. Gildas were not without their periods of relief. In the midst of his 

selfish preoccupation with his own tribulations his thoughts were distracted by solicitude for 

Heloise. Heloise, in the nunnery of Argenteuil, had led a life so exemplary that she had won 

universal esteem. But it happened, says Abelard, "that the Abbot of Saint-Denis had claimed, as a 

dependency formerly subject
