'em now; his wife was called Mis' 'Manda and she was jes' 'bout lak Marse W=
illiams. I had 'bout=20

eighteen head of boys and five girls myself; dere was so many, I can' 'memb=

Gantling was asked to relate some incidents that he could remember of the l=
ives of slaves, and he=20

continued:  "Well the horn would blow every morning for you to git up and g=
o right to work; when=20

the sun ris' if you were not in the field working, you would be whipped wit=
h whips and leather=20

strops. I 'member Aunt Beaty was beat until she could hardly get along but =
I can' 'member what for=20

but do you know she had to work along till she got better. My ma had to wor=
k pretty hard but my=20

oldest sister, Judy, was too young to work much.  "A heap of de slaves woul=
d run away and hide=20

in de woods to keep from working so hard but the white folks to keep them f=
rom running away so=20

that they could not ketch 'em would put a chain around the neck which would=
 hang down the back=20

and be fastened on to another 'round the waist and another 'round the feet =
so they could not run,=20

still they had to work and sleep in 'em, too; sometimes they would wear the=
se chains for three or=20

four months.  "When a slave would die they had wooden boxes to put 'em in a=
nd dug holes and=20

just put then in. A slave might go to a sister or brother's funeral.  "My r=
ecollection is very bad and=20

so much is forgotten, but I have seen slaves sold in droves like cows; they=
 called 'em 'ruffigees,'=20

and white men wuz drivin' 'em like hogs and cows for sale. Mothers and fath=
ers were sold and=20

parted from their chillun; they wuz sold to white people in diffunt states.=
 I tell you chile, it was=20

pitiful, but God did not let it last always. I have heard slaves morning an=
d night pray for=20

deliverance. Some of 'em would stand up in de fields or bend over cotton an=
d corn and pray out=20

loud for God to help 'em and in time you see, He did.  "They had whut you c=
all "pattyrollers" who=20

would catch you from home and 'wear you out' and send you back to your mast=
er. If a master had=20

slaves he jes' could not rule (some of 'em wuz hard and jes' would not mind=
 de boss), he would=20

ask him if he wanted to go to another plantation and if he said he did, the=
n, he would give him a=20

pass and that pass would read: "Give this nigger hell." Of course whan the =
"pattyrollers" or other=20

plantation boss would read the pass he would beat him nearly to death and s=
end him back. Of=20

course the nigger could not read and did not know what the pass said. You s=
ee, day did not 'low=20

no nigger to have a book or piece of paper of any kind and you know dey wuz=
 not go teach any of=20

'em to read.  "De women had it hard too; women with little babies would hav=
e to go to work in de=20

mornings with the rest, come back, nurse their chillun and go back to the f=
ield, stay two or three=20

hours then go back and eat dinner; after dinner dey would have to go to de =
field and stay two or=20

three more hours then go and nurse the chillun again, go back to the field =
and stay till night. One=20

or maybe two old women would stay in a big house and keep all de chillun wh=

Mr. Gantling came to Florida to Jennings Plantation near Lake Park and stay=
ed two years, then=20

went to Everett's Plantation and stayed one year. From there he went to a p=
lace called High Hill=20

and stayed two or three years. He left there and went to Jasper, farmed and=
 stayed until he moved=20

his family to Jacksonville. Here he worked on public works until he started=
 raising hogs and=20

chickens which he continued up to about fourteen years ago. Now, he is too =
old to do anything but=20

just "sit around and talk and eat."  He lives with his daughter, Mrs. Minni=
e Holly and her husband,=20

Mr. Dany Holly on Lee encounter Cromwell.  The market for the great adventu=
rer's services having=20



risen so high, the price which he asked was large--a principality in hand, =
a province to be=20

conquered, supreme command of the army which he had raised. The court sugge=
sted that if the=20

emperor's son, the King of Hungary, were put over Wallenstein's head, his n=
ame would be a tower=20

of strength, but Wallenstein answered with a blasphemous frankness which mu=
st have made the=20

ears of courtiers tingle. He would be emperor of the army; he would be empe=
ror in the matter of=20

confiscations. The last article shows how he won the soldier's heart. Perha=
ps in framing his terms,=20

he gave something to his wounded pride. If he did, the luxury cost him dear=
, for here he trod upon=20

the serpent that stung his life.  The career of Gustavus was at once arrest=
ed, and he took shelter=20

against the storm in an entrenched camp protected by three hundred cannon u=
nder the walls of=20

Nuremberg--Nuremberg the eldest daughter of the German Reformation, the Flo=
rence of Germany=20

in art, wealth and freedom, then the beautiful home of early commerce, now =
its romantic tomb.=20

The desolation of her grass-grown streets dates from that terrible day. The=
 Swedish lines were=20

scarcely completed when Wallenstein appeared with all his power, and sweepi=
ng past, entrenched=20

himself four miles from his enemy in a position the key of which were the w=
ooded hill and old=20

castle of the Altenberg. Those who chance to visit that spot may fancy ther=
e Wallenstein's camp=20

as it is in Schiller, ringing with the boisterous revelry of its wild and m=
otley bands. And they may=20

fancy the sudden silence, the awe of men who knew no other awe, as in his w=
ell-known dress, the=20

laced buff coat with crimson scarf, and the grey hat with crimson plume, Wa=
llenstein rode by.=20

Week after week and month after month these two heavy clouds of war hung cl=
ose together, and=20

Europe looked for the bursting of the storm. But famine was to do Wallenste=
in's work; and by=20

famine and the pestilence, bred by the horrible state of the camp, at last =
his work was done. The=20

utmost limit of deadly inaction for the Swedes arrived. Discipline and hono=
ur gave way, and could=20

scarcely be restored by the passionate eloquence of Gustavus. Oxenstiern br=
ought large=20

reinforcements; and on the 24th August Wallenstein saw-- with grim pleasure=
 he must have seen--

Gustavus advancing to attack him in his lines. By five hundred at a time--t=
here was room for no=20

more in the narrow path of death--the Swedes scaled the flashing and thunde=
ring Altenberg. They=20

scaled it again and again through a long summer's day. Once it was all but =
won. But at evening=20

the Nurembergers saw their hero and protector retiring, for the first time =
defeated, from the field.=20

Yet Gustavus had not lost the confidence of his soldiers. He had shared the=
ir danger and had=20

spared their blood. In ten hours' hard fighting he had lost only 2,000 men.=
 But Wallenstein might=20

well shower upon his wounded soldiers the only balm for the wounds of men f=
ighting without a=20

country or a cause. He might well write to the emperor: "The King of Sweden=
 has blunted his=20

horns a good deal. Henceforth the title of Invincible belongs not to him, b=
ut to your Majesty." No=20

doubt Ferdinand thought it did.  Gustavus now broke up and marched on Bavar=
ia, abandoning the=20

great Protestant city, with the memory of Magdeburg in his heart. But Nurem=
berg was not to share=20

the fate of Magdeburg. The Imperial army was not in a condition to form the=
 siege. It had suffered=20

as much as that of Gustavus. That such troops should have been held togethe=
r in such extremity=20

proves their general's power of command. Wallenstein soon gladdened the eye=
s of the=20

Nurembergers by firing his camp, and declining to follow the lure into Bava=
ria, marched on=20

Saxony, joined another Imperial army under Pappenheim and took Leipsic.  To=
 save Saxony=20

Gustavus left Bavaria half conquered. As he hurried to the rescue, the peop=
le on his line of march=20

knelt to kiss the=20

Mr. Gantling cannot read or write, but is very interesting.  He has been a =
member of the African=20

Methodist Episcopal Church for more than fifty years.  He has a very good a=
ppetite and although=20

has lost his teeth, he has never worn a plate or had any dental work done. =
He is never sick and=20

has had but little medical attention during his lifetime. His form is bent =
and he walks with a cane;=20

although his going is confined to his home, it is from choice as he seldom =
wears shoes on account=20

of bad feet. His eyesight is very good garment, the sheath of his deliverin=
g sword, and could=20

scarcely be prevented from adoring him as a god. His religious spirit was f=
illed with a presentiment=20

that the idol in which they trusted would be soon laid low. On the 14th of =
November he was leaving=20

a strongly entrenched camp, at Naumberg, where the Imperialists fancied, th=
e season being so far=20

advanced, he intended to remain, when news reached his ear like the sight w=
hich struck=20

Wellington's eye as it ranged over Marmont's army on the morning of Salaman=
ca.=20

89th birthday on the 20th day of November 1936.  He is very small, also ver=
