le Hardi in 1278, of Philippe le Bel in 1311, and of Jean II. in 1352.[30] =

n his Chastelet of Paris,=E2=80=9D whose=20

functions are partly indicated by the extracts from the registers given bel=
ow.  The registers of the=20



Ch=C3=A2telet at Paris from 1389 to 1392 record several instances in which =
medical aid was rendered in=20

judicial proceedings. Under date of March 22d, 1389-90, =E2=80=9CMa=C3=AEtr=
e Jehan Le Conte, sworn surgeon=20

to the king our sire,=E2=80=9D reports to Ma=C3=AEtre Jehan Truquam, lieute=
nant to the provost, that =E2=80=9Cupon that=20

day in the morning one Rotisseur had gone from life unto death in consequen=
ce of the wounds=20

which he had received on the Monday evening preceding.=E2=80=9D[31] Under d=
ate of July 22d, 1390, is an=20

account of the examination of one Jehan le Porchier, accused of intent to p=
oison the king (Charles=20

VI.), in which there is reference to a very early instance of toxicological=
 expert evidence. In the=20

wallet of the accused certain herbs were found. The account proceeds: =E2=
=80=9CRichart de Bules,=20

herbalist, was summoned, to him the above-mentioned herbs were shown, and h=
e was=20

commanded that he should examine them and consider well and duly, reporting=
 the truth of what=20

he should find. The said Richart, after having examined them with great dil=
igence, reported that in=20

the box in which these herbs were he had found six leaves, namely: one leaf=
 of _jacia nigra_, and=20

one of round plantain, called in Latin _plantago minor_, and four of sow-th=
istle (_lasseron_), called=20

in Latin _rosti poterugni_, and says that the leaf of _jatria nigra_ is poi=
sonous, but that in the=20

others there is no poison known to the deponent.=E2=80=9D[32] On August 12t=
h, 1390, =E2=80=9CJehan Le Conte and=20

Jehan Le Grant, sworn surgeons of our sire the king,=E2=80=9D are present a=
t the torture of a prisoner, but=20

for what purpose does not appear. In another case the same Jehan Le Conte t=
estified that a=20

wound in the head of a deceased person was made with an axe.[33] At a later=
 period in Italy, the=20

infliction of =E2=80=9Cthe question=E2=80=9D took place under medical super=
vision. Zacchias devotes a chapter, _De=20

Tormentis et P=C5=93nis_,[34] to the consideration of the different methods=
 of torture, the degrees of=20

pain and danger attending each, and the conditions of age, sex, and health =
which render its=20

application inadmissible.[35]  During this period, as indeed from the earli=
est times, the practice of=20

medicine was regulated by law. Thus a law of King Roger of Sicily (1129-54)=
 punished those who=20

practised medicine without authority with imprisonment and confiscation of =
goods; and an edict of=20

Frederick II. (1215-46) imposed like penalties upon those who presumed to p=
ractise except after=20

graduation at the school of Salernum.[36]  Medico-legal science was formed =
in the middle of the=20

sixteenth century by a simultaneous awakening of jurists and physicians to =
the importance of the=20

subject.  It was in Germany that expert medical testimony was first legally=
 recognized. In 1507,=20

George, Bishop of Bamberg, proclaimed a criminal code in his domains. This =
was subsequently=20

adopted by other German states, and finally was the model upon which the _C=
aroline Code_, the=20

first general criminal code applying to the whole empire, was framed and pr=
oclaimed at the Diet of=20

Ratisbon in 1532.[37]  These codes, particularly the Caroline, distinctly p=
rovide for utilizing the=20

testimony of physicians. Wounds are to be examined by surgeons who are =E2=
=80=9Cto be used as=20

witnesses;=E2=80=9D[38] and in case of death one or more surgeons are to =
=E2=80=9Cexamine the dead body=20

carefully before burial.=E2=80=9D[39] They also contain provisions for the =
examination of women in cases of=20

contested delivery, or suspected infanticide;[40] for the regulation of the=
 sale of poisons;[41] for=20

the detection and punishment of malpractice;[42] and for examination into t=
he mental condition in=20

cases of suicide and of crime.[43]  An early work on the practice of crimin=
al law, based on the=20

Caroline Code, was published by the Flemish jurist, Josse de Damhouder, in =
1554. It contains a=20

chapter treating of the lethality of wounds, which should be determined by =
expert physicians and=20

surgeons,[44] and describes the course which is to be pursued in the judici=
al examination of dead=20

bodies. This is probably the earliest printed book (other than the laws the=
mselves) containing=20



reference to medico-legal examinations,[45] and antedates the writings of p=
hysicians upon the=20

subject.  Although it was only in 1670 that the Ordinances of Louis XIV. ga=
ve to France a uniform=20

criminal code, medico-legal reports were made by physicians and surgeons to=
 the courts more=20

than a century before. Indeed, the earliest medico-legal work written by a =
physician[46] is the 27th=20

book of the =C5=92uvres d=E2=80=99Ambroise Par=C3=A9, first printed in 1575=
, in which he directs the forms in which=20

judicial reports shall be made in various medico-legal cases.[47] During th=
e remainder of the=20

sixteenth century France produced but three treatises on medico-legal subje=
cts.[48] One of these,=20

written by the jurist A. Hotman, distinctly mentions the employment of phys=
icians to determine=20

questions of fact.  In Italy works on medical jurisprudence were published =
at the close of the=20

sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. The earliest of these w=
as a chapter of=20

Codronchius, treating of the =E2=80=9Cmethod of testifying in medical cases=
,=E2=80=9D in 1597.[49] At about the=20

same time, but certainly later, appeared the work of Fortunatus Fidelis, to=
 whom the honor of=20

being the first writer on medical jurisprudence is given by many.[50]  The =
great work of Paulus=20

Zacchias, physician to Pope Innocent X., was first printed at Rome, 1621-35=
. This medico-legal=20

classic contains in the first two volumes the =E2=80=9C_Qu=C3=A6stiones_=E2=
=80=9D and in the third the decisions of the=20

Roman Rota. It treats of every branch of medico-legal science, and discusse=
s physiological=20

questions of legal interest, besides dealing with questions such as the inf=
liction of torture and=20

miracles.[51]  Although the =E2=80=9CQu=C3=A6stiones Medico-legales=E2=80=
=9D of Zacchias was the first systematic work=20

upon medical jurisprudence, his countrymen in succeeding centuries have con=
tributed but little to=20

this science. It is only during the latter part of the present century that=
 Italians have again become=20

prominent in medico-legal literature.  In France legal medicine progressed =
but little from the time of=20

Par=C3=A9 to the latter part of the eighteenth century. Several treatises a=
ppeared, being chiefly upon=20

legitimacy and kindred subjects,[52] with a few treating of reports, signs =
of death, etc.[53]  Toward=20

the end of the eighteenth century the labors of Louis, Petit, Chaussier, an=
d Fod=C3=A9r=C3=A9 elevated legal=20

medicine to the rank of a science. The investigations of Louis (Ant. L.) we=
re numerous and=20

important in this as in other subjects,[54] and the =E2=80=9C_causes c=C3=
=A9l=C3=A9bres_=E2=80=9D contain reports of many=20

 Petit, a contemporary of=20

Louis, contributed an extensive work on the duration of pregnancy as affect=
ing legitimacy.[56]=20

Somewhat later Fr. B. Chaussier, between 1785 and 1828, published at Dijon =
a number of=20

treatises on infanticide, viability, surgical malpractice, etc.[57] Fod=C3=
=A9r=C3=A9, a Savoyard, was the first to=20

publish a systematic treatise on medical jurisprudence in France, which was=
 first printed in 1798=20

and in a much enlarged form in 1813.[58] This last edition is an exhaustive=
 treatise upon all=20

branches of legal medicine and public hygiene, and won for its author the a=

most industrious and original of French professors of legal medicine was Or=
fila. A native of=20

Minorca, he graduated in medicine at Paris in 1811, and devoting himself to=
 chemical and=20

toxicological investigations, published the first edition of his =E2=80=9CT=
rait=C3=A9 des Poisons=E2=80=9D in 1814. This=20

work, which may be regarded as the foundation of experimental and forensic =
toxicology, went=20



through five editions to 1852, and was translated into several foreign lang=
uages. The first edition=20

of his =E2=80=9CLe=C3=A7ons de M=C3=A9decine l=C3=A9gale=E2=80=9D appeared =
in 1821, and the fourth in 1848. Besides these Orfila=20

published a work on the treatment of asphyxia and a great number of papers =
on medico-legal=20

subjects, principally in the _Annales d=E2=80=99Hygi=C3=A8ne_, of which he =
was one of the founders with Andral,=20

Esquirol, Leuret, and Devergie. Orfila occupied the chair of chemistry and =
medical jurisprudence in=20

the University of Paris for upward of thirty years, and was employed as exp=
ert in innumerable=20

cases before the courts.  Contemporaneous with Orfila, and almost as promin=
ent, was Devergie,=20

the first edition of whose =E2=80=9CM=C3=A9decine l=C3=A9gale,=E2=80=9D in =
three volumes, appeared in 1836, and the third in=20

1852.  In 1820 the first edition of the Manual of Briand and Brosson was pu=
blished. This work, the=20

tenth edition of which was published in 1879, is the first in which a juris=
t was associated with a=20

physician in the authorship,[62] and is one of five of which one of the aut=
hors is a lawyer.[63]=20

Special treatises on the medico-legal relations of insanity were published =
by Georget (1821),=20

Falvet (1828), Esquirol (1838), and Marc (1840), and on midwifery by Capuro=
n (1821).  Tardieu,=20

Professor of Legal Medicine in the University of Paris (1861-79), published=
 a most important series=20

of monographs on hygienic and medico-legal subjects,[64] besides many paper=
s, principally in the=20

_Annales d=E2=80=99Hygi=C3=A8ne_, _etc._, and testified before the courts i=
n many =E2=80=9C_causes c=C3=A9l=C3=A9bres_.=E2=80=9D  The=20

first work of medico-legal interest to appear in Germany was the =E2=80=9CM=
edicus-Politicus=E2=80=9D of Rodericus=20

=C3=A0 Castro, a Portuguese Jew living in Hamburg, printed in 1614, which d=
eals principally with=20

medical ethics and the relations of physicians, but contains chapters on si=
mulated diseases,=20

poisoning, wounds, drowning, and virginity.[65]  It was only toward the end=
 of the seventeenth=20

century that the subject was scientifically treated, and during the latter =
part of the seventeenth=20

century and the beginning of the eighteenth great progress was made in the =
development of=20

forensic medicine in Germany. Johannes Bohn, one of the originators of the =
experimental method=20

of investigation in physiological chemistry and physics, at the University =
of Leipzig, was also one=20

of the earliest German contributors to the literature of legal medicine. Be=
sides smaller works he=20

published two noteworthy treatises: in 1689 a work on the examination of wo=
unds and the=20

distinction between ante-mortem and post-mortem wounds, and between death b=
y injury,=20

strangulation, and drowning.[66] In 1704 a work giving rules for the conduc=
t of physicians in=20

attending the sick and in giving evidence in the courts.[67] At about the s=
ame period M. B.=20

Valentini, professor in the University of Giessen, published three importan=
t works, containing=20

collections of medico-legal cases, and of the opinions and decisions of pre=
vious writers.[68]=20

Another extensive collection of cases and decisions was published in 1706 b=
