They knew a little later in the day would be better, but they felt that they must lose no time.  Carl to give evidence at the trial! He had transgressed the unwritten law of the English constitution that a person prominent in a _cause celebre_ belongs for the time being, not to himself, but to the nation at large. He had no claim _
his head, and with a flash of the eyes said, "I'll catch that fellow yet!"  And Carl Mills, with 

admiration and determination both on his face, said, "Right! And I'll help you do it!"  A big 

maskinonge lives a life much like that of a rogue elephant in its isolation. He selects some spot,--a 

cove filled with lily-pads, a bend of a river, or a sunken treetop like the home of Old Muskie, --and 

there he will stay, month after month, if not year after year. So there was little danger of Old 

Muskie's leaving Forest Lodge Cove that summer unless he was caught or killed or died the 

mysterious death that comes to the great fish of the streams and lakes.  Lee Henly and Carl Mills 

knew this, and they had been learning more and more of the habits of this particular maskinonge. 

In every new thing that they learned, they felt that they had one more aid toward the final capture 

of Old Muskie and the realization of Lee's ambition for college that year.  Lee had learned that 

hooking the big fish was the easiest part of the work of capturing him. He decided that he must 

provide by every possible means against the entanglement of his casting-bait.  With this in view, 

he made a wooden casting-minnow himself. He took a spinner and the glass eyes from an old one 

he had used, and from a bit of red cedar he whittled out the shape for the body. He had bought a 

very heavy, although not a very large, hand-forged treble hook. He took a heavy, spring-steel wire, 

and had the old blacksmith at Kessler's Corners weld an eye in it through which may be precisely 

ascertained by reference to illustrated articles in the papers. Then Mr. Oxford, the youngish Jew 

who had acquired Parfitts, who was Parfitts, also cut a picturesque figure on the face of London. 

He, too, was spending money with both hands; for Parfitts itself was at stake. Last and most 

disturbing, was the individual looming mysteriously in the background, the inexplicable man who 

lived in Werter Road, and whose identity would be decided by the judgment in the case of Witt 

_v_. Parfitts. If Witt won his action, then Parfitts might retire from business. Mr. Oxford would 

probably go to prison for having sold goods on false pretences, and the name of Henry Leek, 

valet, would be added to the list of adventurous scoundrels who have pretended to be their 

masters. But if Witt should lose--then what a complication, and what further enigmas to be solved! 

If Witt should lose, the national funeral of Priam Farll had been a fraudulent farce. A common valet 

lay under the hallowed stones of the Abbey, and Europe had mourned in vain! If Witt should lose, 

a gigantic and unprecedented swindle had been practised upon the nation. Then the question 

would arise, Why?  Hence it was not surprising that popular interest, nourished by an indefatigable 

and excessively enterprising press, should have mounted till no one would have believed that it 

could mount any more. But the evasion from Werter Road on that June morning intensified the 

interest enormously. Of course, owing to the drawn blinds, it soon became 


_
of the treble hook. He put on the back spinner, and passed the wire through the wooden minnow. 

He used no front spinner, as it might catch in the rushes.  The front eye he made in the wire 

himself by bending and twisting till he was sure beyond all question that it was and the 

bloodhounds of the Sunday papers were sniffing along the platforms of all the termini in London. 

Priam's departure greatly prejudiced the cause of Mr. Oxford, especially when the bloodhounds 

failed and Priam persisted in his invisibility. If a man was an honest 


_
fastened his copper leader into this eye, put the glass eyes into the head of the minnow, and with 

careful painting his bait was complete.  The season was now growing late. College was to begin 

September 23d. On Tuesday, September 9th, Carl and Lee set out at daybreak on their quest. 

They fished long and carefully, but got no strike. They left the cove for half an hour, then tried 

again. This time the great fish struck, but was not hooked. Soon Forest Lodge was astir, and 

fishing for Old Muskie ended for that day.  Then came the last day. Carl was to leave for college 

the man, why should he flee the public gaze, and in the night? There was but a step from the 

posing of this question to the inevitable inference that Mr. Oxford's line of defence was really too 

fantastic for credence. Certainly organs of vast circulation, while repeating that, as the action was 

_sub judice_, they could say nothing about it, had already tried the action several times in their 

impartial columns, and they now tried it again, with the entire public as jury. And in three days 

Priam had definitely become a criminal in the public eye, a criminal flying from justice.
