translation without once correcting her. School over, Miss Martineau discov=
ered that she had no=20

appetite for her dinner; she left quite a nice little repast, cooked in Fre=
nch style, untasted on the=20

table, and hurrying up to her bedroom, put on her mantle and poke bonnet an=
d went out. She had=20

made up her mind to visit the Mainwarings, and to expostulate with these he=
adstrong and naughty=20

girls on their daring scheme. "Wicked, I call it," she ejaculated many time=
s under her breath!--"a=20

wicked scheme, wicked, and a tempting of Providence. Oh, my poor orphan chi=
ldren, I must do my=20

utmost to prevent your having your own perverse way in this matter!"  She a=
rrived at Woodbine=20

Cottage to find the neat little house already in sad confusion. Hannah favo=
red her with an=20

expressive look, and a grave shaking of her head.  "I don't know if they'll=
 see you," she said--"they=20

won't see you if it is on a lecturing errand you've come, ma'am. Their mind=
s is made up, ma'am,=20

and obstinate is no word for them. Dear Miss Martineau, you means well, and=
 you has known=20

them most of their lives, poor darlings, so sit you down in the hall, and I=
'll see if I can get them to=20

have a word with you."  Jasmine, however, had heard her old governess's voi=
ce, and now running=20

out, looking extremely untidy but very pretty, she exclaimed in her eager t=
ones--  "Now, you dear=20

Miss Martineau, say you're not--do say you're not!"  "Not what, my dear?" a=
sked the governess,=20

who really felt quite angry with Jasmine at this moment. "If you mean that =
I am not displeased--I=20

am displeased; and if you mean that I am not to oppose you, my dear, I shou=
ld not be doing my=20

solemn duty, the duty which I owe to your poor dead mother, if I did not op=
pose you to the very=20

uttermost. My dear, Mrs. Ellsworthy has told me all about your mad scheme; =
my poor child, it=20

cannot be allowed for a moment."  "Come into the drawing-room and hear what=
 Primrose has to=20

say," answered Jasmine, in quite a meek and unruffled voice. "Primrose is v=
ery busy, for she is=20

dusting and packing all our books and little knick-knacks. Do you know, Mis=
s Martineau, that just=20

when I heard your ring at the hall-door I came across a pincushion which yo=
u gave me ages and=20

ages ago. You gave it to me when I could say, _Le the  "Other ministers hav=
e tried to get hold of=20

the boys, but they went at it wrong, and failed," she said.  "I'll try to g=
o at the matter from the right=20

end," he replied, smiling.  "Will you go if you find yourself opposed?"  "I=
 think I can interest the=20

boys sufficiently to overcome any opposition from the Innkeeper, if that is=
 what you mean."  "What=20

if the opposition comes from other sources?"  "From the members of the chur=
ch?"  "Yes."  "Why=20

should they interfere with me?"  "But suppose they do?"  "I'll go, anyway,"=
 he answered decidedly.=20

"I'm glad to hear you say that, and I trust you will be able to help the me=
mbers of the club," she=20

said quietly. "But, there! I really must be going. The ladies will think I =
have deserted them."=20

Elizabeth smiled, and the minister followed the smile down from her eyes to=
 the corners of her=20

mouth. He made the mental observation that he had never seen a more beautif=
ul face. As she ran=20

lightly up the path, he watched her, unmindful of several pairs of observin=
g eyes focused=20

knowingly in his direction.  When the day was over, and the furniture resto=
red where the greater=20

part belonged, the "Cleaning Bee" gradually broke up. Captain Pott declared=
 to Elizabeth: "It wa'n't=20

half so bad a day as I cal'lated it would be, and it's many a year since th=
e old craft has looked so=20

neat and togged up."  That evening the Captain sat on his back doorstep, sm=
oking his pipe, and=20

thinking. He thought about the transformation wrought by the hand of women =
inside the house. He=20

heaved a sigh, and thought of Clemmie Pipkin. If she were only able to forg=
et all the past and=20

consent to his oft-repeated proposal, but----He had thought that all out be=
fore, and had brought all=20

his persuasive powers against the citadel of her heart, but to no avail. A =
new light dawned upon=20



him. Perhaps----  Mr. McGowan came round the corner of the house. The Capta=
in rose to meet=20

him.  "Mack, how'd you like to go out to the _Jennie P._ with me? That's th=
e name of my power-

boat out there in the harbor. I thought it might be sort of restful to take=
 a little cruise after this=20

house-cleaning typhoon."  "That's a splendid idea, Cap'n. It will seem like=
 old times to get aboard a=20

vessel with you, though it is only a power-boat."  "And, Mack, if=20


_
chaud_ with a Parisian accent. It was such a pretty pincushion made of pink=
 silk, and dotted over=20

with steel beads to look like pins. Just when you were ringing the bell I h=
ad it in my hand, and I felt=20

so soft and loving towards you, and of course I had to run out to see you, =
and--; Primrose, dearest,=20

here is Miss Martineau. She is dreadfully opposed, and she says she won't l=
et us go."  Primrose=20

was bending over a battered old trunk which had been hauled down from the l=
umber-room. She=20

was filling it with books, and her fair face was slightly flushed, and her =
eyes were brighter than=20

usual.  "How do you do, Miss Martineau?" she said, rising to her feet. "It =
is very salvation craft=20

you've signed up with, just you let me know. It ain't likely I'll be much g=
ood to you, but----"  The two=20

men gripped hands. Little did they know that night as they peacefully saile=
d round the inlet just=20

what the future was to demand in the way of a fulfilment of that promise.  =
   CHAPTER II   During=20

the following weeks Mr. McGowan continued to grow in favor with the people =
of the church and=20

village. Every Sunday the little chapel was crowded. His sermons, practical=
 in thought, simple in=20

language, and direct in delivery, were discussed about the tables of the co=
untry folk during Sunday=20

dinner. The boys of the Athletic Club had received him cordially,=20


_
girls rather silly, but I'm afraid we must do what we think right ourselves=
 in this matter. We have=20

taken our first steps, and now that we have quite and absolutely made up ou=
r minds, mean to=20

leave Rosebury as quickly as possible. It is very kind of you to be interes=
ted in us, and I am sorry=20

that I spoke bitterly the other day, but the plan which was to divide us gi=
rls was of course=20

impossible, and we could not listen to it for a moment. We have made our ow=
n little scheme, and=20

perhaps we shall not fail. Daisy, darling, hand me dear old 'Sandford and M=
erton,' I have just got a=20

nice corner for it here."  Primrose went down again on her knees, and seren=
ely continued her=20

packing, while Miss Martineau, standing over her, then and there gave way t=
o a burst of passion.=20

She was well aware that she lost ground with her pupils by not controlling =
her temper, but as she=20

said afterwards, she really could not help herself. Such coolness, such per=
versity, such a=20

headstrong flying in the proved himself a good fellow. Elder Fox had strenu=
ously opposed intimate=20

relationships between the club and former ministers, but he made no attempt=
 to interfere with Mr.=20

McGowan, although he remained skeptical as to the wisdom of such secular te=
ndencies. Sim=20

Hicks, the keeper of the Inn, did not like the minister, and declared he wo=
uld oust him from the=20

community if it were the last act of his life.  The one man who responded m=
ost naturally, whole-

heartedly, and with simple loyalty to the power of the young man's personal=
ity was Captain Josiah=20

Pott. These two became close companions, and one evening Mrs. Eadie Beaver =
remarked=20

concerning it:  "Ain't you glad I got him in with you, Josiah?"  "Cal'late =
I am, Eadie. I was mad at=20

first, but it's beginning to mean a heap to me to have him here."  "You alw=
ays seemed so lonely=20

when you'd come home, and I'd see your light in the setting-room window. It=
 don't seem that way=20

now when I look across."  "It is real nice and homelike=20


_
young girls before.  Poor Daisy quite sobbed, and even Jasmine felt a littl=
e frightened at Miss=20

Martineau's bitter and angry words; but no language she could use, no threa=
ts of the direst failure=20

she could utter, had power to shake Primrose's resolve.  "We have no guardi=
an, and we can go if=20

we please, and we have really made up our minds to go," replied that perver=
se young lady.  As a=20

last resource Mr. Danesfield was appealed to, but he, being an old bachelor=
 and not quite at home=20

with girls, although in his heart he was very fond of them, declined to int=
erfere.  "I gave Primrose=20

Mainwaring some uncalled-for advice when she came to see me the other morni=
ng," he said. "She=20

is perfectly at liberty to choose her own life, and I, for one, am not goin=
g to add to her troubles by=20

needlessly  "I'm glad it's different for you," declared his next-door neigh=
bor as she looked about=20

the room. "Things look real trim since the painters got through."  The seam=
an's face clouded. "It=20

took a sight more than I thought it would, though, and it ain't going to be=
 easy to pay back to Jim=20

what I borrowed to do the repairing with."  "Now, don't you go to crossing =
any bridges till you get to=20

'em. The Lord will provide when the time comes."  "Cal'late He might, but I=
've always noticed that=20

it's safer to help Him a mite on the perviding question."  "Well, ain't you=
 helping? You're doing the=20

janitor work at the church, and that helps some. And, then, you'll get a sh=
ip one of these days,=20

mark my word. Mr. Fox said as much to Harry just the other day."  "I ain't =
so sure of that, Eadie,"=20

remarked=20
