philodendron monstera bearlike as the body.  "Not me," said Parr, and ducke=
d away from the tree-trunk against which he might be pinned. "What's the id=
ea? I didn't do anything to you--"  "I--boss," said his threatener again. "=
Nobody fight me."  "True, true," chorused the others sycophantically. "Ling=
, he boss--throw down club, you new man."  Parr saw what they meant. With t=
he other would sooner have kept a share of this awhile longer. "Let me keep=
 the half of it till the first boy is born," says he. "You will not," says =
I. "Whether there is or is not a boy, the whole hundred pounds must be in M=
ichael's hands before he brings your daughter in the house." The wife spoke=
 to him then, and he gave in at the end.  BRIDGET. You seem well pleased to=
 be philodendron monstera bearlike as the body.  "Not me," said Parr, and d=
ucked away from the tree-trunk against which he might be pinned. "What's th=
e idea? I didn't do anything to you--"  "I--boss," said his threatener agai=
n. "Nobody fight me."  "True, true," chorused the others sycophantically. "=
Ling, he boss--throw down club, you new man."  Parr saw what they meant. Wi=
th the other would sooner have kept a share of this awhile longer. "Let me =
keep the half of it till the first boy is born," says he. "You will not," s=
ays I. "Whether there is or is not a boy, the whole hundred pounds must be =
in Michael's hands before he brings your daughter in the house." The wife s=
poke to him then, and he gave in at the end.  BRIDGET. You seem well please=
d to be _
left up to you as a voting body."  Shanklin sprang to his feet. "Fair enoug=
h!" he bawled. "I call Parr=20

guilty. All who think like me, say aye!"  "Aye!"  "Aye!"  "Aye!"  They were=
 all agreeing except=20

Sadau, who looked shrunken and sad and frightened. Shanklin smirked.  "All =
who think he should=20

be killed as a murderer--"  "Hold on," put in Varina Pemberton. "If I'm chi=
ef, I'll draw the line there.=20

Don't kill him."  Shanklin bowed toward her. "I was wrong to suggest that b=
efore a woman. Then=20

he's to be kicked out?"  There was a chorus of approving yells, and all sav=
e Sadau jumped up to=20

look for sticks and stones. Parr laid his hand on the club he had borne in =
the skirmish that day.=20

"Now wait," he said clearly and harshly, and the whole party faced him--Sad=
au wanly, the girl=20

questioningly, the rest angrily.  "I'm to be kicked out," Parr repeated. "I=
'll accept that. I'll go. But,"=20

and the club lifted itself in his right hand, "I'm not going to be rough-ho=
used. I've seen it happen=20

here, and none of it for me."  "Oh, no?" Shanklin had picked up a club of h=
is own, and grinned=20

fiercely.  "No. Let me go, and I leave without having to be whipped out of =
camp. Mob me, and I=20

promise to die fighting, right here." He stamped a foot on the ground. "I'l=
l crack a skull or two=20

before I wink out. That's a solemn statement of fact."  "Let him go," said =
Varina Pemberton again,=20

this time with a ring of authority. "He wears that armor, and he'll put up =
a fight. We can't spare any=20

more men."  "Thank you," Parr told her bleakly. He gave Shanklin a last lon=
g stare of challenge,=20

then turned on his heel and walked away toward the thickets amid deep silen=
ce. Behind him the=20

council fire made a dwindling hole in the blackness of night. It seemed to =
be his last hope, fading=20

away.  He pushed in among thick, leafy stems. A voice hailed him:  "Hah!"  =
And a figure, blacker=20

than the gloom, tramped close to him across a little grassy clearing.  "You=
! They drive you out?" a=20

thick, unsure voice accosted him.  Parr hefted his club, wondering if this =
would be an enemy. "Yes.=20

They drove me out. I'm exiled from among exiles."  "Uh." The other seemed p=
erplexed over these=20

words, as though they stated a situation too complicated. Parr's eyes, grow=
ing used to the=20

darkness, saw that this out this candle. [_He puts out candle._] We must pu=
t out the whole world=20

as I put out this candle [_he puts out candle_]; we must put out the light =
of the stars and the light of=20

the sun and the light of the moon [_he puts out the remaining candles and c=
omes down to where=20

the others are_], till we have brought everything to nothing once again. I =
saw in a broken vision,=20

but now all is clear to me. Where there is nothing, where there is nothing =
... there is God!=20

CONSTABLE. Now we will take him!  JOHNNY B. We will never give him up to th=
e law!=20

PAUDEEN. Make your escape! We will not let you be followed.            [_Th=
ey struggle with_=20

CONSTABLES; _the women help them; all           disappear, struggling. Ther=
e is a shot._ MARTIN=20

_falls dead.           Beggars come back with a shout._]  JOHNNY B. We have=
 done for them; they=20

will not meddle with you again.  PAUDEEN. Oh, he is down!  FATHER JOHN. He =
is shot through=20

the breast. Oh, who has dared meddle with a soul that was in the tumults on=
 the threshold of=20

sanctity?  JOHNNY B. It was that gun went off and I striking it from the co=
nstable's hand.  MARTIN=20

[_looking at his hand, on which there is blood_]. Ah, that is blood! I fell=
 among the rocks. It is a=20

hard climb. It is a long climb to the vineyards of Eden. Help me up. I must=
 go on. The Mountain of=20

Abiegnos is very high ... but the vineyards ... the vineyards!            [=
_He falls back, dead. The men=20

uncover their heads._]  PAUDEEN [_to_ BIDDY]. It was you misled him with yo=
ur foretelling that=20

he was coming within the best day of his life.  JOHNNY B. Madness on him or=
 no madness, I will=20

not leave that body to the law to be buried with a dog's burial or brought =
away and maybe hanged=20

upon a tree. Lift him on the sacks; bring him away to the quarry; it is the=
re on the hillside the boys=20



will give him a great burying, coming on horses and bearing white rods in t=
heir hands.=20

[_They lift him and carry the body away, singing._]      Our hope and our d=
arling, our heart dies=20

with you.     You to have failed us, we are foals astray!  FATHER JOHN. He =
is gone, and we can=20

never know where that vision came from. I cannot know; the wise Bishops wou=
ld have known.=20

THOMAS [_taking up banner_]. To be shaping a lad through his lifetime, and =
he to go his=20


_
outcasts from the village. "Uh," repeated his interrogator. "You come to us=
. Make one more in=20

camp. Come."         *       *       *       *       *  Among tall trees, t=
hickly grown, lay a throng of=20

sleepers. Parr's companion led him there, and made an awkward gesture.  "Yo=
u lie down. You=20

sleep. Tomorrow--boss talk. Uh!"  So saying, the beast-man curled up at the=
 root of a tree. Parr=20

sat down with his back against another trunk, the club across his knees, bu=
t he did not sleep.=20

This, plainly enough, was the outcast horde. It clung together, the gregari=
ousness of humanity not=20

yet winnowed out by degeneration. It had a ruler, too--"Tomorrow boss talk.=
" Talk of what? In what=20

fashion?  Thus Parr meditated during the long, moonless night. He also took=
 time to examine once=20

more his captured armor. Its metal plates, clamped upon a garment of leathe=
roid, covered his=20

body and limbs, even the backs of his hands, as well as his neck and scalp.=
 Yet, as he had=20

decided before, it was no great protection against violence. As clothing it=
 was superfluous on this=20

tropical planetoid. What then?  He could not see, but he could feel. His fi=
ngers quested all over=20

one plate, probing and tapping. The plate was hollow--in reality, two sauce=
r-shaped plates with=20

their concave faces together. They gave off a muffled clink of hollowness w=
hen he tapped them.=20

When he shook the armor, there was something extra in the sound, and that i=
mpelled him to hold=20

a plate close to his ear. He heard a soft, rhythmic whirr of machinery.  "T=
here's a vibration in this=20

stuff," he summed up in his mind. "What for? To protect against what?"  The=
n, suddenly, he had it.=20

The greatest menace of the whole tiny world was the force that reversed evo=
lution--the vibration=20

must be designed to neutralize that force!  "I'm immune!" cried Fitzhugh Pa=
rr aloud; and, in the=20

early dawn that now crept into the grove, his sleeping companions began to =
wake and rise and=20

gape at him.  He gaped back, with the shocked fascination that any intellig=
ent person would feel at=20

viewing such reconstructions of his ancestors. At almost the first glance h=
e saw that the newest=20

evolutionary thought was correct--these were simian, but not apes. Ape and =
man, as he had often=20

heard, sprang from the same common fore-father, low-browed, muzzle-faced, h=
airy. Such were=20

these, in varying degrees of intensity. None wore clothes. Grinning mouths =
exhibited fanglike=20

teeth, bare chests broadened powerfully, clumsy hands with short, ineffectu=
al thumbs made=20

foolish gestures. But the feet, for instance, were not like hands, they wer=
e flat pedestals with=20

forward-projecting toes. The legs, though short, were powerful. Man's fathe=
r, decided Parr, must=20

have had something of the bear about his appearance ... and the most bearli=
ke of the twenty the=20

world itself is, whatever shape was put upon it at the first!  ANDREW. To b=
e too headstrong and=20

too open, that is the beginning of trouble. To keep to yourself the thing t=
hat you know, and to do in=20

quiet the thing you want to do, there would be no disturbance at all in the=
 world, all people to bear=20

that in mind!   CURTAIN     CATHLEEN NI HOULIHAN     CHARACTERS   PETER GIL=

of a=20

cottage close to Killala, in 1798._ BRIDGET _is standing at a table undoing=
 a parcel._ PETER _is=20

sitting at one side of the fire,_ PATRICK _at the other_.   PETER. What is =
that sound I hear?=20

PATRICK. I don't hear anything. [_He listens._] I hear it now. It's like ch=
eering. [_He goes to the=20

window and looks out._] I wonder what they are cheering about. I don't see =
anybody.  PETER. It=20

might be a hurling match.  PATRICK. There's no hurling to-day. It must be d=
own in the town the=20

cheering is.  BRIDGET. I suppose the boys must be having some sport of thei=
r own. Come over=20



here, Peter, and look at Michael's wedding-clothes.  PETER [_shifts his cha=
ir to table_]. Those are=20

grand clothes, indeed.  BRIDGET. You hadn't clothes like that when you marr=
ied me, and no coat=20

to put on of a Sunday any more than any other day.  PETER. That is true, in=
deed. We never=20

thought a son of our own would be wearing a suit of that sort for his weddi=
ng, or have so good a=20

place to bring a wife to.  PATRICK [_who is still at the window_]. There's =
an old woman coming=20

down the road. I don't know, is it here she's coming?  BRIDGET. It will be =
a neighbour coming to=20

hear about Michael's wedding. Can you see who it is?  PATRICK. I think it i=
s a stranger, but she's=20

not coming to the house. She's turned into the gap that goes down where Mur=
teen and his sons=20

are shearing sheep. [_He turns towards_ BRIDGET.] Do you remember what Winn=
y of the Cross=20

Roads was saying the other night about the strange woman that goes through =
the country=20

whatever time there's war or trouble coming?  BRIDGET. Don't be bothering u=
s about Winny's=20

talk, but go and open the door for your brother. I hear him coming up the p=
ath.  PETER. I hope he=20

has brought Delia's fortune with him safe, for fear her people might go bac=
k on the bargain and I=20

after making it. Trouble enough I had making it.            [PATRICK _opens=
 the door and_ MICHAEL=20

_comes in._]  BRIDGET. What kept you, Michael? We were looking out for you =
this long time.=20

MICHAEL. I went round by the priest's house to bid him be ready to marry us=
 to-morrow.=20

BRIDGET. Did he say=20

e men who had driven=20

Parr forth. Six feet six towered this hair-thicketed ogre, with a  MICHAEL.=
 He said it was a very=20

nice match, and that he was never better pleased to marry any two in his pa=
rish than myself and=20
