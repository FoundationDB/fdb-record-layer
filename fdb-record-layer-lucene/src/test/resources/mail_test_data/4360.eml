good would that do?" flung back Shanklin roughly. "The ship's what we wante=
d. It's gone. You=20

bungled, Parr."  Parr was about to reply with the obvious charge that Shank=
lin's own hesitancy had=20

done much to cause the failure, when Sadau spoke:  "This young lady--miss, =
are you an exile?=20

Because," and he spoke in the same fashion that he had once employed to Par=

"Wait a minute," interposed Parr again. "Let's take stock of ourselves. Hal=

killed--and a couple of others--"  Shanklin barked at him. "You don't give =
orders any more. We've=20

got a new chief, and you're just one of the rabble, like me." He made a hea=
vily gallant bow toward=20

the latest arrival. "May I ask your name, lady?"  "I'm Varina Pemberton," s=
he said. "But what's the=20

meaning of all this?"  Shanklin and Sadau began to of the great cure for al=

n. The body wore several=20

useful things--a belt with ammunition and a knife-combination, shoes on the=
 thickened ends of the=20

tentacles, and that strange armor. As Parr moved to retrieve these, his com=
panions called out to=20

halt him.  "The new chief will decide about those things," said Shanklin of=
ficiously. "Especially the=20

gun. Can I have it?"  To avoid a crisis, Parr passed the weapon to the girl=
, who nodded thanks and=20

slid it into her own waist-belt. Shanklin asked for, and received, the knif=
e. Sadau was the only man=20

slender enough to wear the shoes, and gratefully donned them. Parr looked o=
nce again at the=20

armor, which he had drawn free of its dead owner.  "What's that for?" asked=
 Shanklin.  Parr made=20

no answer, because he did not know. The armor was too loosely hung together=
 for protection=20

against weapons. It certainly was no space-overall. And it had nothing of t=
he elegance that might=20

make it a Martian uniform of office. Casting back, Parr remembered that the=
 skipper had worn it at=20

the time when he, Parr, was landed--but not during the voyage out. He shook=
 his head over the=20

mystery. his body. Maybe they would keep away the evil things of the air.  =

"Let that belong to you," the girl Varina Pemberton was telling him. "It ha=

be turned to use. Perhaps--" She seemed to be on the verge of saying someth=

checked herself.  "If you'll come with us," Sadau told her respectfully, "w=

Down with the law!  FATHER JOHN. Hush! He is coming back. [_To_ CONSTABLES.=
