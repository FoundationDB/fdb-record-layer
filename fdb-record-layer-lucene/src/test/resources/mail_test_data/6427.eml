dracaena marginata walk of about half a mile, during which time the cry of =
the hippos had been several times repeated, I observed six of these curious=
 animals standing in the water about shoulder-deep. There was no cover, the=

The Holy Office is most severe in its inquisition of the truth, and, though=

t inconsistent and unsatisfactory _
we could rest in the open air with the clear bright starlit sky above us. T=
here were no mosquitoes,=20

neither were there any of the insect plagues of the tropics; the air was to=
o dry for the gnat tribe,=20

and the moment of sunset was the signal for perfect enjoyment, free from th=
e usual drawbacks of=20

African travel. As the river pools were the only drinking-places for birds =
and game, the gun=20

supplied not only my own party, but I had much to give away to the Arabs in=
 exchange for goat's=20

milk, the meal of the dome nuts, &c. Gazelles were exceedingly numerous, bu=
t shy, and so difficult=20

to approach that they required most careful stalking. At this season of int=
ense heat they drank=20

twice a day--at about an hour after sunrise, and half an hour before sunset=
.  The great comfort of=20

travelling along the bank of the river in a desert country is the perfect f=
reedom, as a continual=20

supply of water enables the explorer to rest at his leisure in any attracti=
ve spot where game is=20

plentiful, or where the natural features of the country invite investigatio=
n. We accordingly halted,=20

after some days' journey, at a spot named Collodabad, where an angle of the=
 river had left a deep=20

pool of about a mile in length: this was  =E2=80=9CNo shadow of doubt. I wo=
nder if this young prince will=20

hunt in the Campagna?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAll Englishmen hunt.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CI make no doubt he rides well, and has famous=20

horses, and will sometimes lend us one. I am glad his soul is saved.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CYes; it is well, when the=20

Blessed Virgin interferes, it should be in favor of princes. When princes b=
ecome good Christians, it=20

is an example. It does good. And this man will give an impulse to our opera=
, which wants it, and,=20

as you say, he will have many horses.=E2=80=9D  In the course of the evenin=
g, Miss Arundel, with a=20

beaming face, but of deep expression, said to Lothair: =E2=80=9CI could tel=
l you some good news, had I not=20

promised the cardinal that he should communicate it to you himself. He will=
 see you to-morrow.=20

Although it does not affect me personally, it will be to me the happiest ev=
ent that ever occurred,=20

except, of course, one.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWhat can she mean?=E2=80=9D thou=
ght Lothair. But at that moment Cardinal=20

Berwick approached him, and Miss Arundel glided away.  Father Coleman atten=
ded Lothair home=20

to the Agostini Palace, and when they parted said, with much emphasis, =E2=
=80=9CI must congratulate you=20

once more on the great event.=E2=80=9D  On the following morning, Lothair f=
ound on his table a number of=20

the=20


_
throughout the course of the Atbara. A number of Arabs had congregated at t=
his spot with their=20

flocks and herds; the total absence of verdure had reduced the animals to e=
xtreme leanness, as=20

the goats gathered their scanty sustenance from the seed-pods of the mimosa=
s, which were=20

shaken down to the expectant flocks by the Arab boys, with long hooked pole=
s. These seeds were=20

extremely oily, and resembled linseed, but the rank flavour was disagreeabl=
e and acrid.  This spot=20

was seven days' march from the Nile junction, or about 160 miles. The journ=
ey had been=20

extremely but in general he only glanced at it, and scarcely that. On the p=
resent occasion his own=20

name caught immediately his eye. It figured in a long account of the celebr=
ation of the preceding=20

day. It was with a continually changing countenance, now scarlet, now palli=
d as death; with a=20

palpitating heart, a trembling hand, a cold perspiration, and, at length, a=
 disordered vision, that=20

Lothair read the whole of an article, of which we now give a summary:  =E2=
=80=9CRome was congratulated=20

on the service of yesterday, which celebrated the greatest event of this ce=
ntury. And it came to=20

pass in=20


_
had been no change in the scenery; it was the interminable desert, with the=
 solitary streak of=20

vegetation in the belt of mimosas and dome palms, about a mile and a half i=
n width, that marked=20

the course of the river. I had daily shot gazelles, geese, pigeons, desert =
grouse, &c. but no larger=20

game. I was informed that at this spot, Collodabad, I should be introduced =
for the first time to the=20

hippopotamus.  Owing to the total absence of nourishing food, the cattle pr=
oduced a scanty supply=20

of milk; thus the Arabs, who depended chiefly upon their flocks for their s=
ubsistence, were in great=20

distress, and men and beasts mutually suffered extreme hardship. The Arabs =
that occupy the=20

desert north of the Atbara are the Bishareens; it was among a large concour=
se of It seems that a=20

young English noble of the highest rank, family, and fortune=E2=80=9D (and =
here the name and titles of=20

Lothair were accurately given), =E2=80=9Clike many of the scions of the ill=
ustrious and influential families of=20

Britain, was impelled by an irresistible motive to enlist as a volunteer in=
 the service of the pope,=20

when the Holy Father was recently-attacked by the secret societies of athei=
sm. This gallant and=20

gifted youth, after prodigies of valor and devotion, had fallen at Mentana =
in the sacred cause, and=20

was given up for lost. The day after the battle, when the ambulances laden =
with the wounded were=20

hourly arriving at Rome from the field, an English lady, daughter of an ill=
ustrious house, celebrated=20

throughout centuries for its devotion to the Holy See,=20


_
we pitched our tents on the banks of the river at Collodabad.  This being t=
he principal watering-

place along the deserted bed of the Atbara, the neighbourhood literally swa=
rmed with doves, sand=20

grouse, and other birds, in addition to many geese and pelicans.  Early in =
the morning I procured=20

an Arab guide to search for the reported hippopotami. My tents were among a=
 grove of dome=20

palms on the margin of the river; thus I had a clear view of the bed for a =
distance of about half a=20

mile on either side. This portion of the Atbara was about 500 yards in widt=
h, the banks were about=20

thirty feet perpendicular depth; and the bend of the river had caused the f=
ormation of the deep=20

hollow on the opposite side which now formed the pool, while every other pa=
rt was dry. This pool=20

occupied about one-third the breadth of the river, bounded by the sand upon=
 one side, and by a=20

her efforts to support the cause of Christianity, was employed, as was her =
wont, in offices of=20

charity, and was tending, with her companion sisters, her wounded countryme=
n at the Hospital La=20

Consolazione, in the new ward which has been recently added to that establi=
shment by the Holy=20

Father.  =E2=80=9CWhile she was leaning over one of the beds, she felt a ge=
ntle and peculiar pressure on=20

her shoulder, and, looking round, beheld a most beautiful woman, with a cou=
ntenance of singular=20

sweetness and yet majesty. And the visitor said: =E2=80=98You are attending=
 to those English who believe=20

in the Virgin Mary. Now at the Hospital Santissima Trinita di Pellegrini th=
ere is in an ambulance a=20

young Englishman apparently dead, but who will not die if you go to him imm=
ediately and say you=20

came in the name of the Virgin.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=9CThe influence of the str=
anger was so irresistible that the young=20


_
other, upon which grew a fringe of green bushes similar to willows. These w=
ere the only succulent=20

leaves that I had seen since I left Berber.  We descended the steep sandy b=
ank in a spot that the=20

Arabs had broken down to reach the water, and after trudging across about 4=
00 yards of deep=20

sand, we reached the extreme and narrowest end of the pool; here for the fi=
rst time I saw the=20

peculiar four-toed print of the hippopotamus's foot. A bed of melons had be=
en planted here by the=20

Arabs in the moist sand near the water, but the fruit had been entirely rob=
bed by the hippopotami.=20

A melon is exactly adapted for the mouth of this animal, as he could crunch=
 the largest at one=20

squeeze, and revel in the juice. Not contented with the simple fruits of th=
e garden, a large bull=20

hippopotamus had recently killed the proprietor. The Arab wished to drive i=
t from his plantation, but=20

was immediately attacked by the hippo, who caught him in its mouth and kill=
ed him by one crunch.=20

This little incident had rendered the hippo exceedingly daring, and it had =
upon several occasions=20

charged out of the water, when the people had driven their goats to drink; =
therefore it would be the=20

more satisfactory to obtain a shot, and to supply the hungry Arabs with mea=
t at the expense of=20

their enemy.  At this early hour, 6 A.M., no one had descended to the pool,=
 thus all the tracks upon=20

the margin were fresh and undisturbed: there were the huge marks of crocodi=
les that had recently=20

returned to the water, while many of great size were still lying upon the s=
and in the distance: these=20

slowly crept into the pool as we approached. The Arabs had dug small holes =
in the sand within a=20

few yards of the water: these were the artificial drinking-places for their=
 goats and sheep, that=20

would have been snapped up by the crocodiles had they ventured to drink in =
the pool of crowded=20

monsters. I walked for about a mile and a half along the sand without seein=
g a sign of=20

hippopotami, except their numerous tracks upon the margin. There was no win=
d, and the surface=20

of the water was unruffled; thus I could see every creature that rose in th=
e pool either to breathe or=20

to bask in the morning sunshine. The number and size of the fish, turtles, =
and crocodiles were=20

extraordinary; many beautiful gazelles approached from all sides for their =
morning draught: wild=20

geese, generally in pairs, disturbed the wary crocodiles by their cry of al=
arm as we drew near, and=20

the desert grouse in flocks of many thousands had gathered together, and we=
re circling in a=20

Consolazione, repaired instantly to the Di Pellegrini, and there they found=
 in the court-yard, as=20

they had been told, an ambulance, in form and color and equipment unlike an=
y ambulance used=20

by the papal troops, and in the ambulance the senseless body of a youth, wh=
o was recognized by=20

the English lady as her young and gallant countryman. She claimed him in th=
e name of the=20

Blessed Virgin, and, after due remedies, was permitted to take him at once =
to his noble relatives,=20

who lived in the Palazzo Agostini.  =E2=80=9CAfter a short time much conver=
sation began to circulate about=20

this incident. The family wished to testify their gratitude to the individu=
al whose information had led=20

to the recovery of the body, and subsequently of the life of their relation=
; but all that they could at=20

first learn at La Consolazione was, that the porter believed the woman was =
Maria Serafina di=20

Angelis, the handsome wife of a tailor in the Strada di Ripetta. But it was=
 soon shown that this=20

could not be true, for it was proved that, on the day in question, Maria Se=
rafina di Angelis was on a=20

visit to a friend at La Riccia; and, in the second place, that she did not =
bear the slightest=20

resemblance to the stranger who had given the news. Moreover, the porter of=
 the gate being=20

required to state why he had admitted any stranger without the accustomed o=
rder, denied that he=20

had so done; that he was in his lodge and the gates were locked, and the st=
ranger had passed=20

through without his knowledge.  =E2=80=9CTwo priests were descending the st=
airs when the stranger came=20



upon them, and they were so struck by the peculiarity of her carriage, that=
 they turned round and=20

looked at her, and clearly observed at the back of her head a sort of halo.=
 She was out of their=20

sight when they made this observation, but in consequence of it they made i=
nquiries of the porter=20

of the gate, and remained in the court-yard till she returned.  =E2=80=9CTh=
is she did a few minutes before=20

the English lady and her attendants came down, as they had been detained by=
 the preparation of=20

some bandages and other remedies, without which they never moved. The porte=
r of the gate=20

having his attention called to the circumstance by the priests, was most ca=
reful in his observations=20

as to the halo, and described it as most distinct. The priests then followe=
d the stranger, who=20

proceeded down a long and solitary street, made up in a great degree of gar=
den and convent=20

walls, and without a turning. They observed her stop and speak to two or th=
ree children, and then,=20

though there was=20


_
flight above the water, wishing, but afraid, to descend and drink. Having a=
 shot gun with me, I fired=20

and killed six at one discharge, but one of the wounded birds having fallen=
 into the water at a=20

distance of about 120 yards, it was immediately seized by a white-throated =
fish-eagle, which=20

perched upon a tree, swooped down upon the bird, utterly disregarding the r=
eport of the gun. The=20

Bishareen Arabs have no fire-arms, thus the sound of a gun was unknown to t=
he game of the=20

desert.  I had killed several wild geese for breakfast in the absence of th=
e hippopotami, when I=20

suddenly heard the peculiar loud snorting neigh of these animals in my rear=
; we had passed them=20

unperceived, as they had been beneath the surface. After a and no street to=
 turn into, she=20

vanished.  =E2=80=9CWhen they had reached the children they found each of t=
hem holding in its hand a=20

beautiful flower. It seems the lady had given the boy a rose of Jericho, an=
d to his sister a white=20

and golden lily. Inquiring whether she had spoken to them, they answered th=
at she had said, =E2=80=98Let=20

these flowers be kept in remembrance of me; they will never fade.=E2=80=99 =
And truly, though months had=20

elapsed, these flowers had never failed, and, after the procession of yeste=
rday, they were placed=20

under crystal in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin in the Jesuit Church of S=
t. George of Cappadocia,=20

and may be seen every day, and will be seen forever in primeval freshness. =
 =E2=80=9CThis is the truthful=20

account of what=20
