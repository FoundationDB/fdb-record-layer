above Particulars, if the Casks are not in good order, still the Brewing ma=

are apt to give Drink an ill Taste, if they are not well scalded and season=

are apt to grow musty: unslack'd Lime, about a Gallon to a Hogshead, with a=

little more to say about the Management of Drink, and that is concerning th=
e Bottling of it. The=20

Bottles first must be well clean'd and dry'd; for wet Bottles will make the=
 Drink turn mouldy, or=20

motherry, as they call it; and by wet Bottles, many Vessels of good Drink a=
re spoiled: but if the=20

Bottles are clean and dry, yet if the Corks are not new and found, the Drin=
k is still liable to be=20

damaged; for if the Air can get into the Bottles, the Drink will grow flat,=
 and will never rise. I have=20

Corks on this occasion, that have spoiled as much Liquor as has stood them =

Pounds, only for want of laying out three or four Shillings. If Bottles are=
 cork'd as they should be, it=20

is hard to pull out the Corks without a Screw, and to be sure to draw the C=
ork without breaking, the=20

Screw ought to go through the Cork, and then the Air must necessarily find =
a Passage where the=20

Screw has pass'd, and therefore the Cork is good for nothing; or if a Cork =
has once been in a=20

Bottle, and has been drawn without a Screw, yet that Cork will turn musty a=
s soon as it is exposed=20

to the Air, and will communicate its ill Flavour to the Bottle where it is =
next put, and spoil the Drink=20

that way.  In the choice of Corks, chuse those that are soft, and clear fro=
m Specks, and lay them in=20

Water a day or two before you use them; but let them dry again before you p=
ut them in the Bottles,=20
