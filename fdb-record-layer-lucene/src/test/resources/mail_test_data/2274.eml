=E2=80=98Should there exist a tyrant of great power and authority, who is c=
ontinually practising, by=20

witchcraft and other means, the death of the king, and to deprive him of hi=
s kingdom,=E2=80=94and should=20

that king, from weakness of intellect or want of force, be unable to punish=
 him, and should he=20

permit him to go on in his wickedness,=E2=80=94I should disregard, in this =
case, the law that forbids me to=20

bear arms without the king=E2=80=99s licence, or to take the authority into=
 my own hands in a general sense=20

only. What have I to do with the literal sense of it? Am I to leave my king=
 in such peril? By no=20

means. I am bound to defend my king, and put to death the tyrant; for shoul=
d I, by thus acting, do=20

contrary to the text of the law, I follow the spirit of it, and the object =
it was directed to, namely, the=20

preservation of the honour and life of my king; and I should think myself m=
ore deserving of praise=20

than if I had suffered the tyrant to live on in his wickedness. I ought the=
refore to be rewarded, and=20

not punished, for having done a meritorious deed, tending to a good purpose=
, for which end all=20

laws were made.  =E2=80=98St Paul says, =E2=80=98Littera occidit, charitas =
autem =C3=A6dificat;=E2=80=99 which means, that to=20

follow the literal sense of the holy Scriptures is death to the soul, but t=
hat we ought to obey the=20

true meaning in all charity,=E2=80=94that is to say, to mark and accomplish=
 the end for which the divine=20

laws were made. Spiritual edification is a goodly thing.  =E2=80=98Item, th=
e laws divine, natural and human,=20

give me authority for so doing, and by so doing I am a minister of the divi=
ne law; and it is plain,=20

that the objections I have started, as probably to be made against what I h=
ave said, Huize met with=20

a case of this description. Devergie remarked that on the bodies of those d=
rowned ecchymoses=20

are often hidden for a time on account of the sodden state of the skin, and=
 they appear only after=20

the water has evaporated, which may require some days. Furthermore, it is n=
ot necessary to=20

survive long after an injury in order that an ecchymosis may show post mort=
em. If the blood is fluid=20

at the time of the blow and any capillaries or larger blood-vessels are tor=
n, then we may have an=20

ecchymosis though death be almost instant. Casper thought that it required =
some time before=20

death for an ecchymosis to develop, and that if the person injured by a con=
tusion died soon after=20

the injury, an ecchymosis would not appear after death. There are many well=
-authenticated cases=20

to prove that Casper=E2=80=99s opinion is wrong. Among the most famous of t=
hese is that of the Duchesse=20

de Praslin.[615] She was attacked and killed by her husband while she was a=
sleep in bed. The=20

thirty or so wounds showed a mortal conflict, and she could not have surviv=
ed more than one-half=20

hour, and yet after death there were numerous ecchymoses from the contusion=
s.  Another case is=20

also mentioned by Taylor.[616] A young man died suddenly after a blow from =
a companion, having=20

been struck in the side a fortnight before by a heavy box, which knocked hi=
m senseless and nearly=20

killed him. The post mortem revealed an ecchymosis on the side which on the=
 authority of=20

Casper=E2=80=99s opinion was attributed to the old injury. The color of the=
 ecchymosis would be sufficient=20

to settle all such doubts, as the changes of color would have fully develop=
ed or the color even=20

disappeared in part in=20


_
=E2=80=98I come now to my three instances from the holy Scriptures, to conf=
irm the truth of my third fact. In=20

the first place, Moses, without any authority whatever, slew the Egyptian w=
ho tyrannised over the=20

Israelites.  =E2=80=98At this period, Moses had no authority to  An ecchymo=
sis made post mortem does not=20

undergo the color changes seen in ecchymoses during life, unless the tissue=
s are =C5=93dematous in=20

which the ecchymosis occurs. These changes in color have already been descr=
ibed, the deep blue=20

changing to violet in=20


_
for this power was not given to him until forty years after the perpetratio=
n of this act. Moses,=20

however, was much praised for having done it. =E2=80=98Ut patet auctoritate=
, Exodi ij. quia tanquam=20

minister legis hoc facit. Ita in proposito in hoc faciendo ego ero minister=
 legis.=E2=80=99  =E2=80=98The second=20

instance is that of Phineas, who, without any orders, slew the hours at the=
 earliest. In support of=20

the foregoing and disproving Casper=E2=80=99s views, Christison found that =
within two hours after death=20

severe blows on a dead body are followed by a livid discoloration, similar =
to those produced by a=20

blow shortly before death. This livid discoloration is due to the effusion =
of a very thin layer of blood=20

external or=20


_
but on the contrary praised, and greatly requited in affection, honour and =
riches. In the affection=20

that God shewed him, greater than before. In honour, =E2=80=98Quia reputatu=
m est ei ad justiciam,=E2=80=99 &c. In=20

riches, =E2=80=98Quia per hoc acquisivit actum sacerdotii sempiternum non t=
antum pro the true skin or=20

more rarely into the cellular tissue, staining deeply the partition walls o=
f the fat-cells. Of course, a=20

more or less recent contusion or ecchymosis on a dead body was not necessar=
ily produced at the=20

same time as the cause of death. It should be borne in=20
