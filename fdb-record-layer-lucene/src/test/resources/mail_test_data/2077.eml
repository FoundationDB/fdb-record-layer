view of serving public policy,--knowing this, and seeing the end of my game=
 (without offending my=20

employers) at hand,--I just put my arm in front of the incendiary and murde=
rer, gave him a chair=20

with mock politeness, and asked the secretary if he would let me have the e=
xclusive use of his=20

office for a few minutes. He retired on this hint. He had scarcely left the=
 room--he had certainly not=20

been out more than a minute--before I said to the culprit, "As you came her=
e under the invitation of=20

the secretary, you are free to leave, but I will give you only two hours. I=
 am a detective officer, as I=20

dare say you have guessed, and perhaps you have wondered that you did not k=
now me. Now, to=20

be frank with you, I may say that this company will, I believe, be content =
to let you get away, but=20

they will not be satisfied to let you or your confederates have the chance =
of defrauding either its=20

shareholders or any other company again. Your movements will be watched fro=
m this door; and in=20

every way that you turn you may reckon that we are on your track, as we hav=
e been for more than=20

a year and a half. If you are as wise as I take you to be, you will get out=
 of the country as soon as=20

possible; and if you are then but moderately shrewd, you will never come ba=
ck again. Mind, I have=20

no authority to say this, but I do say it on the strength of my own respons=
ibility."  I opened the door=20

which led into the lobby of the company's offices. I looked at Keeling, and=
 uttered my last=20

monosyllable in his ear--"Go."  He went.  I had the satisfaction of reporti=
ng that within a few days=20

he was a passenger by a steam-vessel from Southampton to New York. I had al=
so the pleasure of=20

announcing to the company that within a few days afterwards Mr. Cross left =
our shores for the=20

same port by way of Liverpool. I further learned and stated that the venera=
ble old man and woman=20

at B---- had returned to their old haunts, and had been heard to complain t=
hat they had been "sold"=20

by Messrs. Keeling and Messrs. Cross.  The company of course saved 3000_l._=
 The solicitor=20

highly complimented me to my face; I also had to listen to the compliments =
of the secretary; and I=20

received payment of my bill. The secretary, who was a very gentlemanly man,=
 naught if he is not=20

also wealthy. So our young people are brought up to think that money-making=
 is the one business=20

of life; and as a result the business world is full of those who resort to =
sharp practice and=20

questionable methods, merely because they have been taught to subordinate h=
onor and equity to=20

gain-getting. Yet, the warm sympathies and native generosity of our people =
are continually coming=20

to the front, in a way that, in view of the other traits, is sometimes amus=
ingly inconsistent. Men=20

who will haggle almost  [Illustration: LOUISVILLE TORNADO--CORNER TENTH AND=
 MAIN=20

STREETS.]  about the price of a pin, or make their living by wild or fraudu=
lent speculation; nay,=20

even professional gamblers, or worse characters, are prompt in responding t=
o the wail of a=20

distressed city or state. After all, we are brethren. Yet, our good and bad=
 qualities are so=20

thoroughly mingled that we must continually rob Peter to pay Paul.  The Ame=
rican has another=20

prominent trait--independence. He does not accept aid, as such, when he fee=
ls he can do without=20

it: nor does he wait for demands of help, when he hears of great misfortune=
s that have befallen his=20

fellow countrymen. Leigh Hunt once asked a very ragged and forlorn Irishman=
, =E2=80=9CWhy don=E2=80=99t you ask=20

American is generally quick to recognize a case that speaks for itself. To =
Louisville, in the hour of=20

her calamity, came tenders of help from many quarters, and these offers wou=
ld have been greatly=20

multiplied, had not the citizens declined the proffered assistance. They fe=
lt that the resources of=20

the city were equal to the necessity. They were grateful, but self-reliant.=
     CHAPTER VII.  OTHER=20

TORNADOES.      =E2=80=9CFrom the dark earth impervious vapors rise,      I=
ncrease the darkness and=20



involve the skies.      At once the rushing winds, with roaring sound,     =
 Burst from th=E2=80=99 =C3=86olian=20

caves and rend the ground;      With equal rage their airy quarrel try,    =
  And win by turns the=20

kingdom of the sky.      But with a thicker night black Auster shrouds     =
 The heavens, and drives=20

on heaps the rolling clouds,      From whose dark womb a rattling tempest p=
ours,      Which the=20


_
courtesy was due to me than the payment of my charges. He said that he shou=
ld bring my case=20

before the board, and would feel personally glad if I would call on him on =
the following Wednesday=20

at 11 o'clock, when he would introduce me to his directors, and no doubt he=
 should obtain from=20

them instructions to further recognise the services I had rendered, not alo=
ne to that institution, but=20

to all the fire-insurance companies of the metropolis.  I accepted this inv=
itation and attended the=20

meeting of the board. The members of that board were a rum lot of fellows, =
but to describe them=20

might be tedious. I should like to say that a fat old man was in the chair.=
  As the secretary was=20

explaining the case in detail (for it seemed that the board knew little if =
any thing about the matter=20

up to this point, every thing having been done by the orders of the secreta=
ry and the solicitor, on, I=20

should imagine, their own responsibility), this old man interrupted him by =
such profound remarks=20

as "Ah! I see; very bad case--How fortunate!--Villain ought to be hung--Why=
 did we not prosecute=20

him?--I think we ought to have prosecuted him!"  It was not, however, for m=
e to interfere with the=20

conversation. I merely listened; and at the conclusion, the secretary said =
that he thought he would=20

ask this gentleman (myself) to attend to-day, in order that he might receiv=
e from the board=20

personally some expression of their sense of, what it appeared to him, my e=
minent services.  The=20

old man      From pole to pole the thunder roars aloud,      And broken lig=
htnings flash from every=20

cloud.      Now smokes with showers the misty mountain ground,      And flo=
ated fields lie=20

undistinguished =E2=80=99round.      Where late was dust, now rapid torrent=
s play--      Rush through the=20

mounds, and bear the dams away.      Old limbs of trees, from crackling for=
ests torn,      Are=20

whirled in air, and on the winds are borne.=E2=80=9D   A casual glance at t=
he papers during the last days of=20

March would have satisfied any one that the storm which passed over the cou=
ntry was anything=20

but insignificant. So far, we have given only the story of a single neighbo=
rhood; while a score of=20

others suffered more or less. A brief account of some of these will be of i=
nterest, and will give us a=20

far better idea of the character of great storms and tornadoes.  The farthe=
st point west touched by=20

a tornado on that memorable day was a strip near the line between Missouri =
and Kansas, some=20

fifty or sixty miles south of Kansas City. Here, a small tornado made its a=
ppearance about five=20

o=E2=80=99clock in the afternoon, demolishing some fences and  [Illustratio=
n: LOOKING WEST FROM=20

TENTH AND MAIN, LOUISVILLE.]  barns, and breaking down a few trees: but, so=
 far as known,=20

no one was hurt. Meanwhile, the main storm had passed eastward much earlier=
 in the afternoon.=20

Shortly after the storm reached St. Louis, violent cyclonic movements were =
excited in southeast=20

Missouri, upwards of a hundred miles away. At 3=20


_
have done your dooty very well, my man; very clever, I think I ought to say=
." And he looked round=20

at the other members for a nod of acquiescence, which was given.  One keen,=
 intelligent-looking=20

man said he thought some more substantial recognition of such services as t=
he secretary had=20

described ought to be made, and that he should, therefore, move a vote of t=
hanks to me; which=20

proposal was seconded by another gentleman, and passed unanimously.  The ch=
airman, again=20

addressing me, said, "You see, we have given you a vote of thanks;" which I=
 acknowledged by a=20

simple nod of the head--not, I am afraid, very highly esteeming the instant=
ly prostrated. The=20

occupants of four of them were, at the time, in the Catholic church, and th=
e family who occupied=20

the fifth escaped unhurt. Two sides of their house were blown away; while o=
ne side was blown=20

inward, and would have crushed them but for chairs and tables which sustain=
ed its weight. The=20

church suffered the loss of its steeple, and was otherwise damaged. A stabl=
e containing seven=20

horses was blown away, and not one of the horses was injured.  A cloud gath=
ered, and a cyclone=20

seemed to form at, or over, Charleston. It followed the Cairo branch of the=
 Iron Mountain Road=20

eastward. Four miles from Charleston it=20


_
Another gentleman then rose and said, "I know that a vote of thanks is all =
very well; but I think we=20

ought to make this gentleman some substantial recognition of his services. =
I am only a young=20

member of the board; I do not like to move the resolution myself, but I wou=
ld suggest to you, sir,=20

as having on the way demolished one or two farm-houses, and made havoc of t=
he forest. The little=20

hamlet of Hough=E2=80=99s was razed from the earth, not a house being left =
intact. One dwelling was blown=20

two hundred feet across the railway track and smashed. The owner, his wife =
and son were killed,=20

and another=20


_
money be given to the officer?"  "I don't see that," said the chairman, "at=
 all. He has done very=20

clever; but he has only done his dooty, after all, like we are doing ours; =
and I don't think we ought=20

to spend shareholders' money in compliments to men for just doing their doo=
ty."  I heard this=20

remark with not very comfortable feelings, but unharmed. Another family liv=
ed near by in a log=20

house. It was blown away, and they were left sitting on the floor, wonderin=
g.  Such a case as this=20

is by no means rare. It is one of the many freaks of the wind not easily un=
derstood. In the great=20

cyclone of forty or fifty miles in diameter, the wind comes in gusts or wav=
es, and such effects=20


_
any thing.  The gentleman who had proposed the testimonial said that he cou=
ld hardly agree with=20

their worthy chairman in all he had said; and another member of the board s=
aid something to the=20

same effect.  The chairman now seemed to think he was a little in the wrong=
, and to treat these=20

remarks as a rebuke. He appeared to think he was bound to recognise my serv=
ices by what, I dare=20

say, he imagined a little act of personal generosity.  Again talking at me,=
 he said, "Well, well! do=20

not let us waste time about this; we cannot spend the money of the company,=
 that I am certain=20

about. I will make this gentleman a present myself." Then turning to me, he=
 proceeded, "Here, my=20

man; you have heard what has been said by the board. I will make you a pres=
ent of half-a-

sovereign out of my own pocket."  This marvellous act of generosity I confe=
ss quite overpowered=20

my self-control. I could not help a passing desire to insult the old man. F=
or the life of me, I could=20

not smother that resolution; so, taking the half-sovereign between my finge=
rs, I said to him, "Well,=20

you see, sir, I agree with you. When a man has done his duty, and especiall=
y when he has been=20

paid for it, he should not want any thing else. I don't want any thing else=
. Your company has paid=20

me 310_l._ 14_s._, which amount will quite remunerate me; and if you have n=
o objection, sir, as I=20

have no doubt you have got some poor relations, perhaps you will hand one o=
f them this half-

sovereign, with my but a few Hundred yards in diameter, its passage is too =
rapid for those in its=20

path to learn definitely whether it be uniform or not.  Other peculiar feat=
s were noticed at Hough=E2=80=99s.=20

A girl seventeen years old was blown one hundred and fifty yards into a pon=
d, but was rescued in=20

time to save her from drowning; and it is said that a man and woman were bl=
own across a sixty-

acre wheat field, and picked up insensible. The further statement that the =
bark was peeled clean=20

from the trees, though seemingly most incredible of all, is very probably t=
rue; for the writer has a=20

vivid recollection of precisely the same phenomenon on the theater of the M=
arshfield cyclone in=20

southwest Missouri. In that instance the bark was peeled from hundreds of h=
ickory saplings,=20

almost from the roots to their topmost twigs. This effect was inconceivable=
 from any cause that=20

could be thought of. It was done by missiles flying through the air, or the=
 trees were bent over and=20

threshed against the ground, or there was some unknown force prevalent in t=
he storm, similar,=20

perhaps, to that which shatters the bark or body of a thunder-smitten oak. =
To an observer on the=20

ground the first two suppositions seemed to be excluded. Is this peculiar p=
ower of the tornado to=20

be sought, like that of Keely=E2=80=99s Motor, in some occult force?  From =
Hough=E2=80=99s Station the tornado may=20

have bounded above the tree-tops and descended again a few miles further on=
 at Bird=E2=80=99s Point,=20

opposite to Cairo, Illinois. Anyhow, a=20


_
I did not wait to notice the effect of this retort upon the pursy magnate; =
but laying down the coin on=20

the middle of the table, I simply and hastily said, "Good morning, sir,--go=
od morning, gentlemen,"=20

and quitted the palatial structure which contained the head-quarters of the=
 Triumph of Meanness=20

Assurance Company.     A RAILWAY ACCIDENT?   A few years ago, and about fif=
teen miles from=20

London, a gentleman named Freeling, returning from the village of A---- to =
the village of B----, a=20

distance of only four miles, had to cross one of the two trunk lines of rai=
lway which runs northward=20

from the great metropolis and intercepts populous districts of England. To =
tell the exact truth about=20

this gentleman, he had been visiting a friend--a man of substance, and like=
wise in the horticultural,=20

floricultural, and agricultural lines, in which Mr. Freeling's mind had an =
inclination to run. To tell a=20

little more of the truth, as it is It was first seen above the trees, it sh=
owed a yellowish cast, and had=20

the usual funnel shape. About three hundred yards from the town it came to =
the ground and=20

commenced its work of destruction. Eight or ten houses were blown to pieces=
, or badly damaged;=20

a roof was carried two hundred feet into the air; a yearling calf was throw=
n forty  [Illustration: VIEW=20

IN THE RESIDENCE DISTRICT, LOUISVILLE.]  feet into a big ditch filled with,=
 water, and--

nobody was hurt.  At Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi, fifty miles above =
Bird=E2=80=99s Point, there was=20

a tremendous hail, which broke thousands of windows, and a gale lasting far=
 into the night, with=20

damage to timber, fences, and buildings.  Illinois suffered far worse than =
Missouri. The southern=20

part of the state fared badly; and the further south, the worse. The storm =
which struck St. Louis at=20

3 P.M., was, a few minutes later, giving the Illinois towns on the other si=
de a lively experience.=20
