who has been disturbing=20

me the last few days by going about with an air of suppressed excitement, b=
rought my anxiety to a=20

head yesterday by staring into my face and then saying:  "Mummy, I've got a=
 secret!"  "What=20

secret?" I asked, doing my best to appear indifferent.  But Dinkie was not =
to be trapped.  "It=20

wouldn't be a secret, if I told you," he sagaciously explained.  I studied =
my child with what was=20

supposed to be a reproving eye.  "You mean you can't even tell your own Mum=
my?" I demanded.=20

He shook his head, in solemn negation.  "But can you, some day?" I pursued.=
  He thought this=20

over.  "Yes, some day," he acknowledged, squeezing my knee.  "How long will=
 I have to wait?" I=20

asked, wondering what could bring such a rhapsodic light into his hazel-spe=
cked eye. I thought, of=20

course, of Doreen O'Lone. And I wished the O'Lones would against luxury, an=
d we find Cicero=20

suffering from indigestion, caused by a supper of vegetables at the house o=
f a wealthy friend,=20

whose excellent cook had developed all the resources of gastronomic art in =
struggling with the=20

restrictions imposed by a sumptuary law. There was intellectual life, and a=
ll the civilized tastes and=20

half-moral qualities which the existence of intellectual life implies. In s=
pite of the sanguinary=20

anarchy which often broke out in the Roman streets, Cicero, the most cultiv=
ated and the least=20

combative of men, when in exile or in his province, sighs for the capital a=
s a Frenchman sighs for=20

Paris. In short, if we consider the case fairly, we shall admit, I believe,=
 that, besides the force of=20

memory and of old allegiance, there was enough of worth and of apparent hop=
e left, not only to=20

excuse republican illusions, but probably to make it a duty to try the issu=
e with fate. I say probably,=20


_
footsteps of so many other successful ranchers and trek off to California. =
Then, as I sat studying=20

Dinkie, I countermanded that wish. For its fulfillment would bring loneline=
ss to the heart of my=20

laddie--and loneliness is hell! So, instead, I struggled as best I could to=
 banish all thought of the=20

matter from my mind. But it was only half a success. I remembered that Gers=
hom himself had=20

been going about as abstracted as an ant-eater and as gloomy as a crow, dur=
ing the last week;=20

and I kept sniffing something unpropitious up-wind. I even hoped that Dinki=
e would return to the=20

subject, as children with a secret have the habit of doing. But he has been=
 as tight-lipped on the=20

matter as his reticent old dad might have been.     _Wednesday the Fifteent=
h_   I got an altogether=20

unlooked-for Valentine yesterday. It was a brief but a significant letter f=
rom Dinky-Dunk, telling me=20

that he had "taken over" the Goodhue house in Mount Royal and asking me if =
I intended to be its=20

mistress. He has bought the house, apparently, completely furnished and is =
getting ready to move=20

into it the first week in March.  The whole thing has rather taken my breat=
h away. I don't object to=20

an ultimatum, but I do dislike to have it come like a bolt from the blue. I=
 have arrived at my=20

Rubicon, all right, and about everything that's left of my life, I suppose,=
 will hang on my decision. I=20

don't know whether to laugh or to cry, to be horrified or hilarious. At one=
 moment I have a=20

tendency to emulate Marguerite doing the Jewel-Song in _Faust_. "This isn't=
 _me_! This isn't=20

_me_!" I keep protesting to myself. But Marguerite, I know, would never be =
so ungrammatical. And=20

then I begin to foresee difficulties. The mere thought of leaving Casa Gran=
de tears my heart.=20

When we go away, as that wise man of Paris once said, we die a little. This=
 will always of a=20

situation so distant from us in time, and so imperfectly recorded?  The gre=
at need of the world was=20

public virtue--the spirit of self- sacrifice for the common good. This the =
empire could not possibly=20

call into being. The public virtue of the ancient world resided in the nati=
onalities which the=20

conquering republic had broken up, and of which the empire only sealed the =
doom. The empire=20

could never call forth even the lowest form of public virtue, loyalty to th=
e hereditary right of a royal=20

family, because the empire never presented itself as a right, but merely as=
 a personal power. The=20

idea of legitimacy, I apprehend never connected itself with these dynasts w=
ho were, in fact, a=20

series of usurpers, veiling their usurpation under republican forms. When t=
he spirit which leads=20

man to sacrifice himself to the good of the community appeared again it app=
eared in associations=20

and notably in one great association formed not by the empire but independe=
ntly of it in=20

antagonism to its immorality, and in spite of its persecutions. Accidentall=
y the empire assisted the=20

extension of the great Christian association by completing the overthrow of=
 the national religions,=20

but the main part of this work had been done by the republic and it was the=
 merit neither of the=20

republic nor of the empire.  It is said with confidence that the empire vas=
tly improved the=20

government of the provinces, and that on this account it was a great blessi=
ng to the world. I do not=20

believe that any nation had then attained, I do not believe that any nation=
 has now attained, and I=20

doubt whether any nation ever will attain, such a point of morality as to b=
e able to govern other=20

nations for the benefit of the governed. I will say nothing about our Chris=
tian policy in India, but let=20

those who rate French morality so highly, consider what French tutelage=20


_
never forsake it utterly. I dread to forsake it for even a portion of each =
year. I am a part of the=20

prairie, now, and I could never be entirely happy away from it. And to acce=
pt that challenge--for=20

however one may look at it, it remains a challenge--and go to the new home =
in Calgary would=20

surely be another concession. And I have been conceding, conceding, for the=
 sake of my people=20

of Algeria. But supposing the task undertaken, the question which is the be=
st organ of imperial=20

government--an assembly or an autocrat--is a curious one. I am disposed to =
think that, taking the=20

average of assemblies and the average of autocrats, there is more hope in t=
he assembly, because=20

in the assembly opinion must have some force. The autocrat is in a certain=
=20


_
Yet, when all is said and done, I am one of a family. I am not a free agent=
. I am chained to the oar=20

for life. When we link up with the race we have more than the little ring o=
f our own Ego to=20

remember. It is not, as Dinky-Dunk once pointed out to me, a good thing to =
get "Indianized." We=20

have our community obligations and they must be faced. The children, undoub=
tedly, would=20

interests, but, after all, he is one of that nation, he lives in it, and su=
bsists by its support. Even in=20

the time of Augustus, if we may trust Dion Cassius Licinius the Governor of=
 Gaul, was guilty of=20

corruptions and peculations curiously resembling those of Verres, from whom=
 he seems to have=20

borrowed the device of tampering with the calendar for the purpose of fisca=
l fraud,=20
