at thirty-three,(684) the age of the body that was put off. [At     whateve=
r age one puts off his=20

outward body by free will, at that     age will he be made to die in his ne=

le over, and again in his=20

next at eighty--a Maya, and at one     hundred, in reality. The Bodhisattva=
 chose Tiani-Tsang,(685)=20

[Tathagata--"one who follows in the way and manner of his     predecessors"=

could do good to his generation as     * * * but none to posterity, and so =
as Tiani-Tsaug he became=20

incarnated only for the "_remains_" [of his precedent Karma, as we     unde=

Ways and the Four Truths were once more     hidden out of sight. The Mercif=

then his     attention and fatherly care to the heart of Bodyul, the nurser=
y-     grounds of the seeds=20

of truth. The blessed "remains" since then     have overshadowed and rested=
 in many a holy body=20

of human     Bodhisattvas.   No further information is given, least of all =
are there any details or=20

explanations to be found in the secret volume. All is darkness and mystery =
in it, for it is evidently=20

written but for those who are already instructed. Several flaming red aster=

of it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed.  "Sir monk,=
" said De Guiche,=20

"confess well that brave man; and be not concerned for your expenses or for=
 those of your mule;=20

all is paid."  "Thanks, monsieur," said the monk, with one of those smiles =
that made Bragelonne=20

shudder.  "Come, count," said Raoul, who seemed instinctively to dislike th=
e vicinity of the=20

Augustine; "come, I feel ill here," and the two young men spurred on.  The =
litter, borne by two=20

servants, now entered the house. The host and his wife were standing on the=
 steps, whilst the=20

unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to =
know if he was=20

followed by the monk. At sight of this pale, bleeding man, the wife grasped=
 her husband's arm.=20

"Well, what's the matter?" asked the latter, "are you going to be ill just =
now?"  "No, but look,"=20

replied the hostess, pointing to the wounded man; "I ask you if you recogni=
ze him?"  "That man--

wait a bit."  "Ah! I see you know him," exclaimed the wife; "for you have b=
ecome pale in your turn."=20

"Truly," cried the host, "misfortune is coming on our house; it is the form=
er executioner of=20

Bethune."  "The former executioner of Bethune!" murmured the young monk, sh=
rinking back and=20

showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent ins=
pired.  Monsieur=20

d'Arminges, who was at the door, perceived his hesitation.  "Sir=20

the few facts given are abruptly broken off. The key of the riddle is left =
to the intuition of the=20

disciple, unless the "direct followers" of Gautama the Buddha--"those who a=
re to be denied by His=20

Church for the next cycle"--and of Shankaracharya, are pleased to add more.=
  The final section=20

gives a kind of summary of the seventy sections--covering seventy-three yea=
rs of Buddha's=20

life(686)--from which the last paragraph is summarized as follows:       Em=
erging from ----, the=20

most excellent seat of the three secrets     [Sang-Sum], the Master of inco=
mparable mercy, after=20

having     performed on all the anchorites the rite of ----, and each of th=
ese     having been cut=20

off,(687) perceived through [the power of] Hlun-     Chub(688) what was his=
 next duty. The Most-

Illustrious meditated     and asked himself whether this would help [the fu=
ture]     generations.=20

What they needed was the sight of Maya in a body of     illusion. Which?...=
 The great conqueror of=20

pains and sorrows arose     and proceeded back to his birthplace. There Sug=
ata was welcomed=20

unfortunate being is none the less a man. Render to him, then, the last ser=
vice he can by any=20

possibility ask of you, and your work will be all the more meritorious."  T=
he monk made no reply,=20

but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited =
the dying man on a=20

bed. D'Arminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses, a=
nd all four started=20

off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion. Just as the tutor an=
d his escort disappeared=20

in their turn, a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn.  "What d=
oes your worship want?"=20

demanded the host, pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made. =
 The traveler made a=20

sign as if he wished to drink, and then pointed to his horse and gesticulat=
ed like a man who is=20

brushing something.  "Ah, diable!" said the host to himself; "this man seem=
s dumb. And where will=20

your worship drink?"  "There," answered the traveler, pointing to the table=
.  "I was mistaken," said=20

the host, "he's not quite dumb. And what else does your worship wish for?" =
