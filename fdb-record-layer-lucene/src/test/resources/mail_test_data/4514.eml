dracaena marginata Peachy pounced upon the liveliest trio and proclaimed th=
em as her triplets, and Delia adopted the two youngest as twins.  "You can =
come to us at a pinch," explained Agnes, "but please remember we're Fairy G=

 We'll fight any just crusade, but we're not going to write your exercises =
for you, or pull you out of scrapes when you don't the waters, which are co=
nstantly agitated by the winds. No importance can be attached to estimates =
which, without being founded on any measurement, are expressed in leagues (=
leguas) reckoned in the colonies at three thousand, five thousand, and six =
thousand six hundred and fifty varas.* (* Seamen being the first, and for a=
 long time the only, persons who _
aren't quite what they ought to be. They _think_ they do their duty, but th=
ey're too aloof and high-

handed and bossing, and the consequence is they're not popular, and the gir=
ls would as soon=20

complain to a teacher as to Rachel or Sybil or Erica. It simply isn't done.=
 Yet those kids need a=20

champion. There are several abuses among them that I've noticed myself."  "=
Guess we've got to=20

take it on then and 'champ'," murmured Delia.  "Poor little souls, it's a s=
hame to steal their 'bikkies';=20

we'll have to stand over them and act as fairy godmothers," said Sheila.  P=
eachy bounced=20

suddenly in her seat.  "Sheila Yonge, you've given me an idea--yes, an abso=
lute brain-throb. What=20

the Camellia Buds ought to do is to turn the sorority into an Amalgamated S=
ociety of Fairy=20

Godmothers, and each of us take over a junior to look after and act provide=
nce to. It's what those=20

kids are just aching for--only they mayn't know it. What good are prefects =
to them except as=20

bogies? They skedaddle like lightning if they see so much as Rachel's shado=
w. They each ought=20

to have one older girl whom they can count on as a friend."  "A kind of bud=
dy?"  "Something of the=20

sort, but more like a foster-mother."  "I vote we ask them all to a candy p=
arty, and each adopt=20

one," suggested Delia warmly.  "There are ten of us, and there are nineteen=
 juniors," calculated=20

Jess. "How's it going to work out?"  "Why, some of us must take twins or ev=
en triplets," decreed=20

Peachy. "I'm bursting to begin. Let's have that candy party right away. Can=
 anybody raise a lira or=20

two?"  "We'll give you our subscriptions back in the house, if you'll act t=
reasurer and wheedle=20

Antonio. Fairy Godmothers, Limited! It's a brainy notion. When shall you as=
k those kids? You bet=20

they'll buzz in like bees."  The loud clanging of the garden bell, which se=
emed to punctuate life at=20

the Villa Camellia, broke up the meeting in a hurry and scattered its membe=
rs in the direction of=20

their classrooms. At the first opportunity, however, Irene unlocked her cas=
h-box and took out a=20

contribution towards the candy party. She was not yet used to the Italian p=
aper money, and had=20

only a vague idea of its value, but she judged that two lire was the expect=
ed amount, and carried it=20

accordingly to Peachy's dormitory.  "You white angel! It's a bountiful 'con=
trib.' I've squared Antonio.=20

He'll leave the parcel inside the grotto. What we should do without that de=
ar old man I can't=20

imagine. I've told the juniors, and they're simply crazy to come. I've fixe=
d it up for directly after tea."=20

Antonio, the old concierge who had charge of the gate, was absolutely faith=
ful to his duties as=20

porter, and guarded the Villa Camellia as zealously as a convent, but he wa=
s lenient on one point--

he was willing sometimes to smuggle sweets, and those girls who knew how to=
 coax could induce=20

him to make an expedition to the confectioner's and fetch them a small priv=
ate store of what=20

delicacies they fancied. He had his own ideas of how much was good for them=
, and would never=20

be responsible for more than a limited allowance; neither would he undertak=
e more than one=20

commission per week for any single girl. It was a matter of favor, and to s=
ome of the pupils he=20

would only grunt a refusal. Peachy, however, was a champion wheedler; she h=
ad a certain=20

command over the Italian language, and could persuade Antonio, in his nativ=
e tongue, of the=20

absolute necessity of her demands. He was quite generous on this occasion, =
and slipped a fair-

sized parcel of mixed Neapolitan bonbons into the sanctuary of the deserted=
 summer-house.=20

Nineteen interested juniors, bidden to an unwonted entertainment, dodged th=
eir prefect after tea,=20

evaded a basket-ball practice, scattered themselves in the grounds, met in =
the long pergola, and=20

proceeded to the jessamine-covered arbor, where they were received politely=
 by their ten=20

hostesses. It was, of course, impossible to accommodate them inside, but th=
e grotto was close to=20

the place where Paolo, the gardener, chopped wood for the stoves, so there =
were plenty of logs=20



lying about that served as seats. In a very short time the guests were sett=
led, hospitality was=20

handed round, the colored papers were removed from the goodies, and there w=
as a general=20

abandonment to sticky satisfaction. Between the first and second distributi=
ons Agnes, as President=20

of the Sorority, of the basin still covered with water is the nearest to th=
e southern chain of the=20

mountains of Guigue, of Yusma, and of Guacimo, which stretch towards the hi=
gh savannahs of=20

Ocumare. The opposite banks of the lake of Valencia display a singular cont=
rast; those on the=20

south are desert, and almost uninhabited, and a screen of high mountains gi=
ves them a gloomy=20

and monotonous aspect. The northern shore on the contrary, is cheerful, pas=
toral, and decked=20

with the rich cultivation of the sugar-cane, coffee-tree, and cotton. Paths=
 bordered with cestrums,=20

azedaracs, and other shrubs always in flower, cross the plain, and join the=
 scattered farms. Every=20

house is surrounded by clumps of trees. The ceiba with its large yellow flo=
wers* (* Carnes=20

tollendas, Bombax hibiscifolius.) gives a peculiar character to the landsca=
pe, mingling its branches=20

with those of the purple erythrina. This mixture of vivid vegetable colours=
 contrasts finely with the=20

uniform tint of an unclouded sky. In the season of drought, where the burni=
ng soil is covered with=20

an undulating vapour, artificial irrigations preserve verdure and promote f=
ertility. Here and there=20

the granite rock pierces through the cultivated ground. Enormous stony mass=
es rise abruptly in the=20

midst of the valley. Bare and forked, they nourish a few succulent plants, =
which prepare mould for=20

future ages. Often on the summit of these lonely hills may be seen a fig-tr=
ee or a clusia with fleshy=20

leaves, which has fixed its roots in the rock, and towers over the landscap=
e. With their dead and=20

withered branches, these trees look like signals erected on a steep cliff. =
The form of these mounts=20

unfolds the secret of their ancient origin; for when the whole of this vall=
ey was filled with water, and=20

the waves beat at the foot of the peaks of Mariara (the Devil's Nook* (* El=
 Rincon del Diablo.)) and=20

the chain of the coast, these rocky hills were shoals or islets.  These fea=
tures of a rich landscape,=20

these contrasts between the two banks of the lake of Valencia, often remind=
ed me of the Pays de=20

Vaud, where the soil, everywhere cultivated, and everywhere fertile, offers=
 the husbandman, the=20

shepherd, and the vine-dresser, the secure fruit of their labours, while, o=
n the opposite side,=20

Chablais presents only a mountainous and half-desert country. In these dist=
ant climes surrounded=20

by exotic productions, I loved to recall to mind the enchanting description=
s with which the aspect of=20

the Leman lake and the rocks of La Meillerie inspired a great writer. Now, =
while in the centre of=20

civilized Europe, I endeavour in my turn to paint the scenes of the New Wor=
ld, I do not imagine I=20

present the reader with clearer images, or more precise ideas, by comparing=
 our landscapes with=20

those of the equinoctial regions. It cannot be too often repeated that natu=
re, in every zone,=20

whether wild or cultivated, smiling or majestic, has an individual characte=
r. The impressions which=20

she excites are infinitely varied, like the emotions produced by works of g=
enius, according to the=20

age in which they were conceived, and the diversity of language from which =
they in part derive=20

their charm. We must limit our comparisons merely to dimensions and externa=
l form. We may=20

institute a parallel between the colossal summit of Mont Blanc and the Hima=
laya Mountains; the=20

cascades of the Pyrenees and those of the Cordilleras: but these comparison=
s, useful with respect=20

to science, fail to convey an idea of the characteristics of nature in the =
temperate and torrid zones.=20

On the banks of a lake, in a vast forest, at the foot of summits covered wi=
th eternal snow, it is not=20

the mere magnitude of the objects which excites our admiration. That which =
speaks to the soul,=20

which causes such profound and varied emotions, escapes our measurements as=
 it does the=20



forms of language. Those who feel powerfully the charms of nature cannot ve=
nture on comparing=20

one with another, scenes totally different in character.  But it is not alo=
ne the picturesque beauties=20

of the lake of Valencia that have given celebrity to its banks. This basin =
presents several other=20

phenomena, and suggests questions, the solution of which is interesting ali=
ke to physical science=20

and to the well-being of the inhabitants. What are the causes of the diminu=
tion of the waters of the=20

lake? Is this diminution more rapid now than in former=20


_
"We've a proposition to make to you all," she began. "There are some things=
 in this school that=20

aren't always quite what they ought to be, and it's rather hard for juniors=
 to fight their own battles.=20

Sometimes you squabble among yourselves--oh, _I_ know!--and sometimes you g=
et it hot from=20

the seniors or the Transition. Well, we're going to help you. Each of us me=
ans to take on one or=20

more of you and be a sort of fairy godmother to you, and responsible for se=
eing you're decently=20

treated. I understand there's been a little trouble about your lunch biscui=
ts?"  "It's Bertha!"  "And=20

Mabel!"  "They're real mean!"  "They simply grab them!"  "Oh, do please sto=
p it!"  "And we haven't=20

had our turns at the tennis courts!"  "And Winnie borrowed my paint-box and=
 won't give it back!"=20

Agnes held up a hand to stop the general clamor.  "That'll do!" she decreed=
. "I'm going to sort you=20

out and give you each to your fairy godmother, and you may pour your woes i=
nto her ears, and=20

she'll try her level best to right your wrongs. No, you _mayn't_ say whom y=
ou'd like to have. It's=20

_we_ who'll do the choosing, thanks! Anybody who's not satisfied can walk o=
ff and she won't get a=20

champion at all or any more candy either. I mean what I say."  Such an awfu=
l threat reduced the=20

juniors to order, and they submitted quite peaceably to be apportioned amon=
g their various=20

benefactresses. Irene we presume that an equilibrium between the waters flo=
wing in and the=20

waters lost will be shortly re-established, or may we apprehend that the la=
ke will entirely=20

disappear?  According to astronomical observations made at La Victoria, Hac=
ienda de Cura,=20

Nueva Valencia, and Guigue, the length of the lake in its present state fro=
m Cagua to Guayos, is=20

ten leagues, or twenty-eight thousand eight hundred toises. Its breadth is =
very unequal. If we=20

judge from the latitudes of the mouth of the Rio Cura and the village of Gu=
igue, it nowhere=20

surpasses 2.3 leagues, or six thousand five hundred toises; most commonly i=
t is but four or five=20

miles. The dimensions, as deduced from my observations are much less than t=
hose hitherto=20

adopted by the natives. It might be thought that, to form a precise idea of=
 the progressive=20

diminution of the waters, it would be sufficient to compare the present dim=
ensions of the lake with=20

those attributed to it by ancient chroniclers; by Oviedo for instance, in h=
is History of the Province of=20

Venezuela, published about the year 1723. This writer in his emphatic style=
, assigns to "this inland=20

sea, this monstruoso cuerpo de la laguna de Valencia"* (* "Enormous body of=
 the lake of=20

Valencia."), fourteen leagues in length and six in breadth. He affirms that=
 at a small distance from=20

the shore the lead finds no bottom; and that large floating islands cover t=
he=20
