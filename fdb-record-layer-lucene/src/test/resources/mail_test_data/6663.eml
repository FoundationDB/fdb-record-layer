bitterness of defeat. I made a vow to myself that I would not go back home =
until General Pershing=20

had led our troops to victory, and a real victory means the stars and strip=

years before sailing to do Red Cross work in France.  "Well, I have never b=

our Red Cross unit may accompany them. I presume not nearly so many nurses =
will be needed as=20

in the fighting days, however."  In the interval, while this conversation w=

Clark's note had been dispatched to the officer of the day. At this moment =
Major Hersey appeared.=20

Major James Hersey, confidentially known among his battalion as "Jimmie" ha=
d the distinction of=20

being one of the youngest majors in the United States army, and to his own =
regret was not only=20

less than twenty-five years old but looked even younger.  "I am so awfully =
glad to see you, Mrs.=20

which was an=20

uncomfortable habit.  "I want you to congratulate discredit the administrat=

Nevertheless, a coolness sprang up between them; and several months later, =
when Alger became=20

 on that day, the=20

President advanced Sampson eight numbers, Schley six, Captain Clark of the =

other captains five. These promotions were all confirmed by the Senate save=
 those of Sampson=20

and Schley, a number of senators holding that Schley should have received a=
