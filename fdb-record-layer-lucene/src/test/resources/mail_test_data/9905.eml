tried to write to my mother with my left hand, so that when she received the War Office cable she 

would know I was able to write.  Dusk came, then night, and finally the Ford ambulance cars which 

were to take us out of Hell. It was a beautiful night. Belgium looked lovely. The merciful night had 

thrown a veil over the war scars on the land and a moon was shining. I was told to sit up in the 

seat with the driver. We traveled along one road, then the shelling became so bad that the drivers 

decided to go back and take another road which was running nearly parallel. Back over the line 

the planes of the Royal Flying Corps were bombing the Forest of Houltholst, and the bursting of 

the shrapnel from the German anti-aircraft guns pierced the velvet of the sky like stars as we went 

out of Belgium into France.                    -------------------------------------  Several times shells burst on 

the road, and from the inside of the car came the stifled groans of the men as the Ford hit limbs of 

trees and shell-holes.  Our first stop was a ruined windmill, the walls of which were nearly six feet 

thick. Here the dangerous cases were taken off and attended to. The last I saw of the corporal was 

after they had cut off his coat at the seams and the doctors were taking a piece of wire out of his 

chest. While I was waiting a chaplain asked me if I would like a cup of coffee or some whiskey, 

realising that it would take some time to get the coffee made I had some more whiskey.  I was 

given two more tags, which this time were tied on buttons at the top of my jacket. I stayed here 

about two hours, then I was sent to a clearing hospital. It was here that I met the first nurses. They 

were two fine, splendid women who were wearing the scarlet hoods of the Mr. Watt enjoyed the 

benefits of the patent he had obtained; and, at a later period, this preference was increased by an 

accident which happened to Trevethick's engine, though caused by gross mismanagement, that 

would have been equally fatal to any other.  From an investigation, by a committee of parliament, 

into the causes of the several fatal explosions of steam-engine boilers within a few years, 

published in Tillock's Magazine, vol. 1., it appears that in every instance the accident was fairly 

attributable to neglect or mismanagement. Many competent persons were summoned to give their 

opinions; and through the contrariety of their testimony, the prevalent opinion appears to have 

been, that cast-iron boilers cannot be safe; that as many engines of high steam as of low are now 

used in England, but that the high are much the most economical in fuel and cost; that they are 

more safe, if properly constructed; it being argued by some, that boilers for steam of 100 pounds 

to the inch, are easily made of strength to sustain 500 pounds; this excess being much greater 

than in those constructed for low steam, makes them comparatively the safest, as the safety 

valves are less liable to be accidentally prevented from venting the steam.  In the United States, 

instances are not wanting of the successful operation of high steam; of which the engine at the 

mint is a conspicuous example. There can, indeed, be no good reason why this great power 

should not be employed to an extent within the limits of safety, if more economical and convenient. 

If boilers can bear (as they are usually made of iron) 500 pounds, there can be no danger in using 

them with fifty; and this gives an increase of power, with a condenser, fourfold, or makes a ten 

horse power

Army nurse. They were both strong and quite capable of handling a man, even if he became 

delirious. One of them quickly got me into bed. I apologized for my terribly dirty state, but I was 

told that it made no difference; they were used to it. To be between clean sheets again was 

wonderful. I felt I wanted to go to sleep forever. Suddenly a roar, and a terrible explosion. The 

hospital was being bombed; a bomb question. It seems unphilosophical to neglect a power so 

great, merely because it is so.  Mr. Watt was desirous of an improvement by which to obtain a 

direct rotatory motion. His experiments, resembling those of Curtis, at New-York, were not found 

permanently practicable.  It was probably perceived to be a great object to get rid of a 

reciprocating movement of large masses, on the well-known mechanical
