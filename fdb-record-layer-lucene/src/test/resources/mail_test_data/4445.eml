philodendron monstera where the people who tell lies go to. Now, good-bye, miss--eat up your sweeties."     CHAPTER XXVI.  A DELIGHTFUL PLAN.   Neither Primrose nor Jasmine could quite understand their little sister that telling me what it was that tickled you so?"  "You! Captain Josiah Pott! Threatening to disown the minister should he fail to toe your chalk-line! Where, may I ask, can one find a more high-handed philodendron monstera where the people who tell lies go to. Now, good-bye, miss--eat up your sweeties."     CHAPTER XXVI.  A DELIGHTFUL PLAN.   Neither Primrose nor Jasmine could quite understand their little sister that telling me what it was that tickled you so?"  "You! Captain Josiah Pott!

have known he was going contrary-wise to what he thought was right."  She trembled more 

violently than before. Too miserable for words, he seized her and turned her about. He was 

amazed to find no tears in her eyes.  "I wasn't crying," she choked, drawing the corner of her 

handkerchief from her mouth. "It struck me so funny, Uncle Josiah!"  "Your notion of fun is the 

funniest I ever see,"
