all finger at Jan--

"you said I was never to forget her, not the least little bit."  "I know I =
did," Jan owned, and fell to=20

pondering what was best to be done about these memories. Absently she dug h=
er hoe into the=20

ground, making ruts in the gravel, while Tony watched her solemnly.  "Then =
why," he went on, "do=20

you not want me to remember Daddie?"  "Because," said Jan, "everything you =
seem to remember=20

sounds so unkind."  "Well, I can't help that," Tony answered.  Jan arose fr=
om the seat. "If we sit=20

idling here all afternoon," she remarked severely, "we shall never get that=

Earley."  The afternoon post came in at four, and when Jan went in there we=
re several letters for=20



her on the hall-table, spread out by Hannah in a neat row, one above the ot=
her. It was Saturday,=20

and the Indian mail was in. There was one from Peter, but it was another le=
tter that Jan seized=20

first, turning it over and looking at the post-mark, which was remarkably c=
lear. She knew the=20

excellent handwriting well, though she had seen it comparatively seldom.  I=
t was Hugo Tancred's;=20

and the post-mark was Port Said. She opened it with hands that trembled, an=
d it said:        "MY=20

DEAR JAN,        "In case other letters have miscarried, which is quite    =
   possible while I was up=20

"HUGO TANCRED."  Still as a statue sat Jan. From the garden came the cheerf=
ul chirruping of=20

birds and constant, eager questioning of Earley by the children. Earley's s=
low Gloucestershire=20

speech rumbled on in muffled _obbligato_ to the higher, carrying, little vo=

as busy with=20

frocks for little Fay.  In a distant pantry somebody was clinking teacups. =
Jan shivered, though the=20

air from the open window was only fresh, not cold. At that moment she knew =
exactly how an=20

animal feels when caught in a trap. Hugo Tancred's letter was the trap, and=
 she was in it. With the=20

exception of the lie about other letters--Jan was perfectly sure he had wri=
tten no other letters--and=20

the stereotyped phrases about shattered lamps and the wife who was "no more=
," the letter was=20

one long menace--scarcely veiled. That sentence, "in so far as you make it =
possible for me to do=20

so, I will fall in with your wishes regarding them in every way," simply me=
ant that if Jan was to=20

keep the children she must let Hugo make ducks and drakes of her money; and=
 if he took her=20

money, how could she do what she ought for the children?  And he was at Por=

week's journey.  Why had she left that money in Bombay? Why had she not lis=

 it, and so it was. "No=20
