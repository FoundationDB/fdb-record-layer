ddenly furious, "_no_! a thousand times! I'd sooner see her in the burning =
depths of the bottomless pit than have you get within a hundred miles of he=
r with estimate of the author rose immeasurably.  His attitude was in such =
sharp contrast to that of others who came almost daily into the office to s=
ee what the papers said, often causing discomfiture to the young advertisin=
g director by insisting upon taking the notices with them. But Bok _
think _him_ mean enough to take such a preposterous advantage.  "You are a =
fool!" he sneered,=20

biting his lip with vexation. "Do you calculate I am a _murderer_?"  "I hav=
e no proof that you are or=20

that you are _not_!" replied Fearless Frank, controlling his temper by a ma=
ster effort. "You=20

remember I have not kept a watch upon your actions."  "Be that as it may, I=
 would be an accursed=20

dog to take advantage of your insulting proposal. You must fight me the sam=
e as I shall fight you!"=20

"No, Ned Harris, I will do nothing of the kind. It is I who have wronged yo=
u and yours; you must=20

take the offensive; I will play a silent hand."  "You refuse to fight me?" =
 "I _do_ refuse to fight you,=20

but do _not_ refuse to give you satisfaction for what wrong you have suffer=
ed.  After one or two=20

visits from Bok, having grown accustomed to him, Stevenson would discuss so=
me sentence in an=20

article, or read some amended paragraph out loud and ask whether Bok though=
 it sounded better.=20

To pass upon Stevenson as a stylist was, of course, hardly within Bok's men=
tal reach, so he kept=20

discreetly silent when Stevenson asked his opinion.  In fact, Bok reasoned =
it out that the novelist=20

did not really expect an answer or an opinion, but was at such times thinki=
ng aloud.  The mental=20

process, however, was immensely interesting, particularly when Stevenson wo=
uld ask Bok to hand=20

him a book on words lying on an adjacent table.  "So hard to find just the =
right word," Stevenson=20

would say, and Bok got his first realization of the truth of the maxim:=20


_
choose; it is yours. Take it, or forever after this consider our debt of ha=
tred canceled, and let us=20

be--"  "Friends? Never, Justin McKenzie, _never_! You forget the stain dyed=
 by your hand that will=20

never washout!"  "No! no! God knows I do not forget!" and the youth's voice=
 was hoarse with=20

anguish. "Could it be undone, I would gladly undo the deed. But, tell me, H=
arris about _her_. Does=20

she still live?"  "_Live_? We-l-l, writing, hard reading; hard writing, eas=
y reading."  On this=20

particular occasion when Stevenson finished, Bok pulled out his clippings, =
told the author how his=20

book was being received, and was selling, what the house was doing to adver=
tise it, explained the=20

forthcoming play by Richard Mansfield, and then offered the press notices. =
 Stevenson took the=20

bundle and held it in his hand.  "That's very nice to tell me all you=20


_
blank; better she had died ere she ever met you!"  "You speak truly; better=
 she had died ere she=20

met me."  Unconsciously the two had ridden closer to each other; had they f=
orgotten themselves in=20

recalling the past?  "She lives--may live on her lonely life for years to c=
ome," Harris resumed,=20

thoughtfully, "but her life will be merely endurance."  "Will you tell me w=
here--where I can go in=20

greatly interested.  But you have really told me all about it, haven't you,=
 so why should I read these=20

notices?  Hadn't I better get busy on another paper for Mr. Burlingame for =
the next magazine, else=20

he'll be after me?  You know how impatient these editors are."  And he hand=
ed back the notices.=20

Bok saw it was of no use: Stevenson was interested in his work, but, beyond=
 a certain point,=20
