1.C.   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" =
or PGLAF), owns a=20

compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SI=

works. Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public =
domain in the United=20

States. If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States =
and you are located in the=20

United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distrib=
uting, performing,=20

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all re=
ferences to Project=20

Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project=
 Gutenberg{~TRADE=20

MARK SIGN~} mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely =
sharing opposite=20

side of the fixed piece the eduction-pipe (_o o_) leads to the condensers. =
 The condensers (_p_)=20

are upright vessels, two to each cylinder, connected at top by a sliding va=
lve box, so that the=20

steam enters them alternately. At bottom are two valves, kept closed by wei=
ghts. A stream of=20

water is injected into the condensers, which escapes by the bottom valves (=
_p p_) by which also=20

the air is blown out, at every stroke, in the same manner the engine is cle=
ared of air at first.  There=20

are also two cocks and cross-pipes seen, Plate III. Fig. 4, to change the s=
team from one side to=20

the other of the valve, to give a reversed motion of the engine.  The power=
