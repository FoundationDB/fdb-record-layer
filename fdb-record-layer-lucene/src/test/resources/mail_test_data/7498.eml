Having before=20

them striking examples of highly educated colored men who could find no emp=
loyment in the=20

United States, the free Negroes began to realize that their preparation was=
 not going hand in hand=20

with their opportunities. Industrial education was then emphasized as the p=
roper method of=20

equipping the race for usefulness. The advocacy of such training, however, =
was in no sense new.=20

The early anti-slavery men regarded it as the prerequisite to emancipation,=
 and the abolitionists=20

urged it as the only safe means of elevating the freedmen. But when the bla=
cks, converted to this=20

doctrine, began to enter the higher pursuits of labor during the forties an=
d fifties, there started a=20

struggle which has been prolonged even into our day. Most northern white me=
n had ceased was=20

everything that could be desired--affectionate, enthusiastic, and admiring.=
 There was but one=20

exception. Michael Ivanovitch scowled upon him with undisguised ill-humour.=
 He would like to=20

know what brought him there, he was heard to mutter; adding that the less b=
oyars and mujiks had=20

to say to one another the better for both. Otherwise, his visit was a compl=
ete success. He returned=20

to Moscow fancying himself desperately in love with Anna Popovna, and the h=
ero of one of his=20

favourite romances, in which princes sighed for shepherdesses and queens we=
dded clowns. An=20

attack of fever, which he had shortly afterwards, and which kept him for so=
me time confined to the=20

house, gave him leisure to indulge his dreams and reveries.  As he grew old=
er, the works of=20

Voltaire and Diderot began to replace in his esteem the flimsy, unreal prod=
uctions of the novelists.=20

M. Thomassin=E2=80=99s only genuine love was a love of pleasure, his only g=
enuine hatred a hatred of=20

religion. Consequently he taught his pupils just enough to make them sensua=
lists and scoffers like=20

himself. He bid fair to succeed as completely with Ivan as he had done with=
 Adrian and Leon=20

Wertsch; indeed Ivan would probably go farther than they,=20


_
free people of color but still objected to granting them economic equality.=
 The same investigators=20

that discovered increased facilities of conventional education for Negroes =
in 1834 reported also=20

that there existed among the white mechanics a formidable prejudice against=
 colored artisans.[1]=20

[Footnote 1: _Minutes of the Fourth Annual Convention for the Improvement o=
f the Free People of=20

Color_, p. 26.]  In opposing the encroachment of Negroes on their field of =
labor the northerners=20

took their cue from the white mechanics in the South. At first laborers of =
both races worked=20

together in the same room and at the same machine.[1] But in the nineteenth=
 century, when more=20

white men in the South were condescending to do skilled labor and trying to=
 develop=20

manufactures, they found themselves handicapped by competition with the sla=
ve mechanics.=20

Before 1860 most southern mechanics, machinists, local manufacturers, contr=
actors, and railroad=20

men with the exception of conductors were Negroes.[2] Against this custom o=
f making colored=20

men such an economic factor the white mechanics frequently protested.[3] Th=
e riots against=20

Negroes occurring in Cincinnati, Philadelphia, New York, and Washington dur=
ing the thirties and=20

forties owed their origin mainly to an ill feeling between the white and co=
lored skilled laborers.[4]=20

The white artisans prevailed upon the legislatures of Pennsylvania, Marylan=
d, and Georgia to=20

enact measures hostile to their rivals.[5] In 1845 the State of Georgia mad=
e it a misdemeanor for a=20

colored mechanic to make a contract for the repair or the erection of build=
ings.[6] The people of=20

Georgia, however, were not unanimously in favor of keeping the Negro artisa=
n down. We have=20

already observed that at the request of the Agricultural Convention of that=
 State in 1852 the=20

legislature all but passed a bill providing for the education of slaves to =
increase their efficiency and=20

attach them to their masters.[7]  [Footnote 1: Buckingham, _Slave States of=
 America_, vol. ii., p.=20

112.]  [Footnote 2: Du Bois and Dill, _The Negro American Artisan_, p. 36.]=
  [Footnote 3: Du Bois=20

and Dill, _The Negro American Artisan_, pp. 31, 32, 33.]  [Footnote 4: Du B=
ois and Dill, _The=20

Negro American Artisan_, p. 34, and _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed.=
_, 1871, p. 365.]=20

[Footnote 5: Du Bois and Dill, _The Negro American Artisan_, pp. 31, 32.]  =
[Footnote 6: Du Bois=20

and Dill, _The Negro American Artisan_, p. 32.]  [Footnote 7: _Special Repo=
rt of the U.S. Com. of=20

Ed._, 1871, p. 339.]  It was unfortunate that the free people of color in t=
he North had not taken up=20

vocational training earlier in the century before the laboring classes real=
ized fraternal=20

consciousness. Once pitted against the capitalists during the Administratio=
n of Andrew Jackson=20

the working classes learned to think that their interests differed material=
ly from those of the rich,=20

whose privileges had multiplied at the expense of the poor. Efforts toward =
effecting organizations=20

to secure to labor adequate protection began to be successful during Van Bu=
ren's Administration.=20

At this time some reformers were boldly demanding the recognition of Negroe=
s by all helpful=20

groups. One of the tests of the strength of these protagonists was whether =
or not they could=20

induce the mechanics of the North to take colored workmen to supply the ski=
lled laborers required=20

by the then rapid economic development of our free States. Would the whites=
 permit the blacks to=20

continue as their competitors after labor had been elevated above drudgery?=
 To do this meant the=20

continuation of the custom of taking youths of African blood as apprentices=
. This the white=20

mechanics of the North generally refused to do.[1]  [Footnote 1: _Minutes o=
f the Third Annual=20

Convention of the Free People of Color_, p. 18.]  The friends of the colore=
d race, however, were=20

not easily discouraged by that "vulgar race prejudice which reigns in the b=
reasts of working=20

classes."[1] Arthur Tappan, Gerrit Smith, and William Lloyd Garrison made t=
he appeal in behalf of=20



the untrained laborers.[2] Although they knew the difficulties encountered =
by Negroes seeking to=20

learn trades, and could daily observe how unwilling master mechanics were t=
o receive colored=20

boys as apprentices, the abolitionists persisted in saying that by persever=
ance these youths could=20

succeed in procuring profitable situations.[3] Garrison believed that their=
 failure to find employment=20

at trades was not due so much to racial differences as to their lack of tra=
ining. Speaking to the free=20

people of color in their convention in Philadelphia in 1831, he could give =
them no better advice=20

than that "wherever you can, put your children to trades. A good trade is b=
etter than a fortune,=20

because when once obtained it cannot be taken away." Discussing the matter =
further, he said:=20

"Now, there can be no reason why your sons should fail to make as ingenious=
 and industrious=20

mechanics, as any white apprentices; and when they once get trades, they wi=
ll be able to=20

accumulate money; money begets influence, and influence respectability. Inf=
luence, wealth, and=20

character will certainly destroy those prejudices which now separate you fr=
om society."[4]=20

[Footnote 1: _Minutes of the Fourth Annual Convention for the Improvement o=
f the Free People of=20

Color_, p. 26.]  [Footnote 2: This statement is based on articles appearing=
 in _The Liberator_ from=20

time to time.]  [Footnote 3: _Minutes of the Second Annual Convention for t=
he Improvement of the=20

Free People of Color_, 1831, p. 10.]  [Footnote 4: _Minutes of the Second A=
nnual Convention for=20

the Improvement of the Free People of Color_, 1831, p. II.]  To expect the =
cooeperation of the=20

white working classes in thus elevating the colored race turned out to be a=
 delusion. They reached=20

the conclusion that in making their headway against capital they had a bett=
er chance without=20

Negroes than with them. White mechanics of the North not only refused to ac=
cept colored boys as=20

apprentices, but would not even work for employers who persisted in hiring =
Negroes. Generally=20

refused by the master mechanics of Cincinnati, a colored cabinet-maker fina=
lly found an=20

Englishman who was willing to hire him, but the employees of the shop objec=
ted, refusing to allow=20

the newcomer even to work in a room by himself.[1] A Negro who could preach=
 in a white church=20

of the North would have had difficulty in securing the contract to build a =
new edifice for that=20

congregation. A colored man could then more easily get his son into a lawye=
r's office to learn law=20

than he could "into a blacksmith shop to blow the bellows and wield the sle=
dge hammer."[2]=20

[Footnote 1: _The Liberator_, June 13, 1835.]  [Footnote 2: Douglass, _Narr=
ative of the Life of=20

Frederick Douglass_, p. 248.]  Left then in a quandary as to what they shou=
ld do, northern=20

Negroes hoped to use the then popular "manual labor schools" to furnish the=
 facilities for both=20

practical and classical education. These schools as operated for the whites=
, however, were not=20

primarily trade schools. Those which admitted persons of African descent pa=
id more attention to=20

actual industrial training for the reason that colored students could not t=
hen hope to acquire such=20

knowledge as apprentices. This tendency was well shown by the action of the=
 free Negroes=20

through their delegates in the convention assembled in Philadelphia in 1830=
. Conversant with the=20

policy of so reshaping the educational system of the country as to carry kn=
owledge even to the=20

hovels, these leaders were easily won to the scheme of reconstructing their=
 schools "on the=20

manual labor system." In this they saw the redemption of the free Negroes o=
f the North. These=20

gentlemen were afraid that the colored people were not paying sufficient at=
tention to the=20

development of the power to use their hands skillfully.[1] One of the first=
 acts of the convention=20

was to inquire as to how fast colored men were becoming attached to mechani=
cal pursuits,[2] and=20

whether or not there was any prospect that a manual labor school for the in=
struction of the youth=20



would shortly be established. nature was stronger and his character more en=
ergetic. What has no=20

root is easily displaced. The religion of Ivan=E2=80=99s early years was a =
mere superstition, a matter of=20

outward forms and observances; therefore, when he ceased to attach importan=
ce to these, he lost=20

everything. =E2=80=9CFrom him that hath not shall be taken away even that w=
hich he _seemeth to have_.=E2=80=9D=20

There was no mental conflict, there were no keen and bitter searchings of h=
eart. From a dead faith=20

he glided almost insensibly into a dead scepticism, and by neither the fait=
h nor the scepticism had=20

the profound slumber of his soul been at any time disturbed.  He continued =
to attend the numerous=20

church services because others did so, and because the exquisite music (in =
the Greek Church=20

entirely vocal) and the gorgeous ceremonial gratified his taste. He also ob=
served, at least as=20

strictly as those around him, the long and severe fasts of the Church; avai=
ling himself, however, of=20

such evasions as were sanctioned by custom: =E2=80=9Cname days,=E2=80=9D fo=
r example, which happened to fall in=20

Lent were sure to be honoured with a double measure of feasting.  Meanwhile=
 his emotional=20

nature craved excitement and his mind needed occupation. Genuine, earnest s=
tudy under a=20

competent teacher he would have thoroughly enjoyed; but the Greek and Latin=
 lessons with which=20

M. Thomassin supplemented his instructions in French were very superficial =
and perfunctory.=20

Fortunately he had another master for Polish and German; and with these lan=
guages he took=20

some pains, because a knowledge of them was necessary in order to obtain a =
commission in the=20

army. But even in these his interest was slight; for at present he found th=
e attractions of the=20

ballroom and the gaming-table far more powerful than those of the library. =
 The narrow world of=20

pleasure in which he lived thrilled but faintly to the shock of those might=
y impulses that were=20

moving the great world around him. Now and then he heard the strife of many=
 tongues which=20

accused the Czar of blindness for having made peace with Napoleon at all, a=
nd of weakness for=20

keeping that peace in spite of numberless provocations. In those days, any =
one who heard the talk=20

of the _salons_ in Moscow and St. Petersburg might have thought it the easi=
est thing in the world=20

to measure swords once more with the conqueror of Austerlitz. Ivan shared t=
he sentiments of=20

those around him, and accordingly he was overjoyed when at last, in defianc=
e of Napoleon, the=20

ukase was published which reopened the trade with England under the protect=
ion of neutral flags,=20

and foreign luxuries appeared once more upon the table of the noble, while =
foreign gold glided=20

quickly into the purse of the merchant. He shared, too, the universal indig=
nation at Napoleon=E2=80=99s=20

atrocious spoliation of the Duke of Oldenburg, the Czar=E2=80=99s brother-i=
n-law, perhaps the most flagrant=20

of his many violations of the Treaty of Tilsit. Ivan was breathing an atmos=
phere highly charged=20

with electricity, and full of the indications of an approaching storm; but =
he knew not the signs of the=20

times. Besides, how was it possible that he, whom competent judges were cal=
ling the best dancer=20

in Moscow, and who was the acknowledged favourite of fortune at all games o=
f hazard, could=20

disquiet himself about the designs of Napoleon and the prospect of a war wi=
th France?=20

CHAPTER VII.  =E2=80=9CON THE EDGE OF THE STORM.=E2=80=9D    =E2=80=9CStill=
 the race of hero-spirits     Pass the=20

lamp from hand to hand;   Age from age the words inherits--     =E2=80=98Wi=
fe, and child, and fatherland!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D=20

Years came and went, changing the =E2=80=9Clittle lord=E2=80=9D of Nicolofs=
ky into the graceful, handsome young=20

nobleman, the ornament of the ball-rooms of Moscow. Ivan Ivanovitch--as he =
was usually called=20

by his numerous friends, such use of the father=E2=80=99s Christian name be=
ing accounted the best style=20

and the highest courtesy in Russian society--had now completed his educatio=
n. He spoke French,=20

the French of the _salons_, in perfection; he played the violin; he danced =
with exquisite grace; he=20



was an adept at cards and loto.  This last accomplishment was a dangerous o=
ne. Diderot=E2=80=99s famous=20

saying, =E2=80=9CRussia is rotten before she is ripe,=E2=80=9D had but too =
much truth in its application to the higher=20

classes. A superficial foreign civilization too often covered without eradi=
cating the barbarism from=20

which the nation was only emerging, and thus the vices of the one state of =
society were added to=20

those of the other. In the brilliant circles where Ivan moved, no form of v=
ice was rare, except=20

perhaps intemperance. The noble did not usually misuse his champagne as gro=
ssly as the mujik=20

did his vodka; but this was the only particular in which he set his poorer =
brother a good example.=20

The most fashionable vice of the Russian nobility at this period was the pe=
rilous excitement of the=20

gaming-table. In this, as in other things, the licentious court of Catherin=
e II. had been to the whole=20

empire a very seed-plot of corruption. It is recorded that on one occasion =
the Empress herself had=20

been unable to obtain a glass of water, so engrossed were pages, equerries,=
 ladies-in-waiting,=20

even grooms and porters, with their cards and their dice. Things were alter=
ed now. Alexander=20

neither played himself, nor permitted any one to play for money within the =
precincts of his palace;=20

but when once evil seed has been sown, who can eradicate the crop that spri=
ngs from it?  Adrian=20

Wertsch was now a tchinovik; that is to say, he had obtained a place under =
government which=20

gave him an official tchin, or rank, corresponding to a particular grade in=
 the army, the standard of=20

all honour under the military despotism of the Czars. Leon had a commission=
, and had recently=20

joined his regiment. Like every one else, he was greatly excited by the pro=
spect of the war with=20

France; but, like nearly every one, he thought the vast army Napoleon had b=
een collecting was=20

intended to winter in Germany, and that the grand drama for which all the w=
orld was looking with=20

strained eyes and eager hearts would not be played out until the following =
summer.  About Ivan=E2=80=99s=20

future there was some perplexity, but of a kind which no one was in a hurry=
 to solve. His education=20

had begun very late, and his present life of elegant dissipation was very p=
leasant. Still, when=20

Count Rostopchine became Governor of Moscow, early in 1812, Ivan=E2=80=99s =
friends thought it well to=20

present him, acquainting the count with his position as the penniless heir =
of a great though=20

proscribed name. But Rostopchine was a Russian of the old school, in whom t=
he proverbial=20

=E2=80=9CTartar=E2=80=9D was very near the surface. He surveyed Ivan critic=
ally, from his perfumed hair to his silk=20

stockings and jewelled shoe-buckles, and muttered contemptuously, as he tur=
ned away,=20

=E2=80=9CDandified French coxcomb!=E2=80=9D To Count Rostopchine the French=
, with all their works and ways,=20

were anathema.  Ivan=E2=80=99s heart was not broken by this repulse, though=
 he took his revenge for it in a=20

clever lampoon, much applauded in the _salons_. He plunged the more madly i=
nto every form of=20

excitement and dissipation. For a while fortune continued to smile upon him=
, and all things went=20

well; his heart was glad, his laugh light, and his step elastic.  But a bit=
ter hour came at last. One=20

night the debts scored against him upon the gaming-table grew and grew, unt=
il the total became=20

absolutely alarming. Of course he was plied with the usual arguments, =E2=
=80=9CGo on; your fortune will=20

change,--you will retrieve all;=E2=80=9D--and, of course, he yielded. The f=
ascination of companionship was=20

upon him, and the yet more potent spell of champagne completed his infatuat=
ion. So far as he was=20

able to reflect at all, the very thoughts that ought to have checked his ma=
dness only stimulated it.=20

He could not bear that his associates should taunt him with cowardice, but =
it was still more=20

intolerable that they should suspect him of poverty. The fear made him desp=
erate, and he went on=20

wildly and recklessly, lavishly increasing his stakes, lest any one should =
surmise the truth--that he=20

was risking more than he possessed. But at last that very fear arrested him=
 when on the brink of=20



ruin. Seeing him=20


_
the question was referred, was so encouraging that the convention itself de=
cided to establish an=20

institution of the kind at New Haven, Connecticut. They appealed to their f=
ellows for help, called=20

the attention of philanthropists to this need of the race, and commissioned=
 William Lloyd Garrison=20

to solicit funds in Great Britain.[3] Garrison found hearty supporters amon=
g the friends of freedom=20

in that country. Some, who had been induced to contribute to the Colonizati=
on Society, found it=20

more advisable to aid the new movement. Charles Stewart of Liverpool wrote =
Garrison that he=20

could count on his British co-workers to raise $1000 for this purpose.[4] A=
t the same time=20

Americans were equally active. Arthur Tappan subscribed $1000 on the condit=
ion that each of=20

nineteen other persons should contribute the same amount.[5]  [Footnote 1: =
_Minutes of the=20

Fourth Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color_, =
p. 26; and _The=20

Liberator_, October 22, 1831; and _The Abolitionist_, November, 1833 (p. 19=
1).]  [Footnote 2:=20

 p. 191.]  [Footnote 5:=20

_The Liberator_, October 22, 1831.]  Before these well-laid plans could mat=
ure, however,=20

unexpected opposition forward with offers of assistance, which they urged, =
nay, even pressed=20

upon him. But he rejected all. Not to these would he become a debtor; for w=
hat hope could he=20

entertain of repaying them? There was only _one_ in all the world to whom h=
e could turn for real=20

help in the hour of need.  It was not until the next morning that he fully =
realized his position. He=20

awoke unrefreshed from a short feverish sleep, and drank the tea his valet =
brought him, but could=20

not eat Fortunes ten times larger than the whole sum of his debts changed h=
ands continually over=20

the card-tables of Moscow and St. Petersburg. But all things go by comparis=
on, and what would=20

have been little indeed to the lord of broad lands and toiling serfs, was m=
uch to the =E2=80=9Cmerchant=E2=80=99s=20

pensioner,=E2=80=9D as Ivan bitterly called himself. He had no alternative =
but to go to Petrovitch, confess=20

his folly, and throw himself upon the generosity of his kind old friend. Th=
is, to a youth of his spirit=20

and temper, was a cruel humiliation. All his manliness, all his independenc=
e of character revolted=20

from the task; and it was equally abhorrent to his pride. Both the good and=
 the evil in him were at=20

war with the necessities of his position; but both had to give way. He dres=
sed himself quickly, left=20

 saw, sprang in, and=20

gave his directions,--choosing the longer route to the merchant=E2=80=99s h=
ouse, that he might avoid the=20


_
protests against this project were filed, and the free people of color were=
 notified that the institution=20

was not desired in Connecticut.[1] It was said that these memorialists fear=
ed that a colored college=20

so near to Yale might cause friction between the two student bodies, and th=
at the school might=20

attract an unusually large number of undesirable Negroes. At their meeting =
the citizens of New=20

Haven resolved "That the founding of colleges for educating colored people =
is an unwarrantable=20

and dangerous undertaking to the internal concerns of other states and ough=
t to be discouraged,=20

and that the mayor, aldermen, common council, and freemen will resist the m=
ovement by every=20

lawful means."[2] In view of such drastic action the promoters had to aband=
on their plan. No such=20

protests were made by the citizens of New Haven, however, when possible del=
ays. The driver, as=20

he settled himself in his seat and grasped more firmly the long ropes that =
served him as reins,=20

leaned over and asked him, =E2=80=9CGospodin,[13] have you heard the news?=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCurse the news!=E2=80=9D said=20

Ivan petulantly. =E2=80=9CDrive quickly, isvostchik,[14] and I=E2=80=99ll d=
ouble thy fare.=E2=80=9D  Yet absorbed as he was in=20

his sordid, selfish trouble, he could not fail to see that some extraordina=
ry change had passed over=20

the city. At the street corners and in the thoroughfares persons of all cla=
sses were gathering in=20

groups, talking and gesticulating. A few had letters or printed papers in t=
heir hands; but those who=20

could read were a small minority, and by far the greater number were discus=
sing what they had=20

heard from the lips of others. Now and then Ivan wondered languidly what ha=
d happened; but his=20

thoughts always slipped back=20


_
to prepare Negroes to leave the country.  [Footnote 1: Monroe, _Cyclopaedia=
 of Education_, vol.=20

iv., p. 406.]  [Footnote 2: _Ibid._, vol. iv., p. 406; and _The Liberator_,=
 July 9, 1831.]  The=20

movement, however, was not then stopped by this outburst of race prejudice =
in New Haven.=20

Directing attention to another community, the New England Antislavery Socie=
ty took up this=20

scheme and collected funds to establish a manual labor school. When the off=
icials had on hand=20

about $1000 it was discovered that they could accomplish their aim by subsi=
dizing the Noyes=20

Academy of Canaan, New Hampshire, and making such changes as were necessary=
 to subserve=20

the purposes intended.[1] The plan was not to convert this into a colored s=
chool. The promoters=20

hoped to maintain there a model academy for the co-education of the races "=
on the manual labor=20

system." The treasurer of the Antislavery Society was to turn over certain =
moneys to this academy=20

to provide for the needs of the colored students, who then numbered fourtee=
n of the fifty-two=20

enrolled. But although it had been reported that the people of the town wer=
e in accord with the=20

principal's acceptance of this proposition, there were soon evidences to th=
e contrary. Fearing=20

imaginary evils, these modern Canaanites destroyed the academy, dragging th=
e building to a=20

swamp with a hundred yoke of oxen.[2] The better element of the town regist=
ered against this=20

outrage only a slight protest. H.H. Garnett and Alexander Crummell were amo=
ng the colored=20

students who sought education at this academy.  [Footnote 1: _The Liberator=
_, July 4, 1835.]=20

[Footnote 2: _Minutes and Proceedings of the Third Annual Convention for th=
e Improvement of the=20

Free People of Color_, p. 34; and Monroe, _Cyclopaedia of Education_, vol. =
iv., p. 406.]  This work=20

was more successful in the State of New York. There, too, the cause was cha=
mpioned by the=20

abolitionists.[1] After the emancipation of all Negroes in that commonwealt=
h by 1827 the New York=20

Antislavery Society devoted more time to the elevation of the free people o=
f color. The rapid rise of=20

the laboring classes in this swiftly growing city made it evident to their =
benefactors that they had to=20

be speedily equipped for competition with white mechanics or be doomed to f=
ollow menial=20

employments. The only one of that section to offer Negroes anything like th=
e opportunity for=20

industrial training, however, was Gerrit Smith.[2] He was fortunate in havi=
ng sufficient wealth to=20

carry out the plan. In 1834 he established in Madison County, New York, an =
institution known as=20

the Peterboro Manual Labor School. The working at trades was provided not a=
ltogether to teach=20

the mechanic arts, but to enable the students to support themselves while a=
ttending school. As a=20

compensation for instruction, books, room, fuel, light, and board furnished=
 by the founder, the=20

student was expected to labor four hours daily at some agricultural or mech=
anical employment=20

"important to his education."[3] The faculty estimated the four hours of la=
bor as worth on an=20

average of about 12-1/2 cents for each student.  [Footnote 1: _Minutes and =
Proceedings of the=20

Third Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color_, p=
. 25.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_African Repository_, vol. x., p. 312.]  [Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vol. x., p. =
312.]  Efforts were then being=20

made for the establishment of another institution near Philadelphia. These =
endeavors culminated=20

in the above-mentioned benefaction of Richard Humphreys, by the will of who=
m $10,000 was=20

devised to establish a school for the purpose of instructing "descendants o=
f the African race in=20

school learning in of more pressing interest. What should he say to Petrovi=
tch? and what would=20

Petrovitch say to him?  It was a glorious morning at the end of June,    =
=E2=80=9CThe very city=E2=80=99s self was=20

filled   With the breath and the beam of heaven.=E2=80=9D  Fair shone the g=
ilded cupolas of the Kremlin,=20

brightly gleamed the silver Moskva, and the gardens and terraces were bloom=
ing with a thousand=20



flowers. Never had the old city looked more lovely, with the strange peculi=
ar charm of its quaint=20

barbaric magnificence toned and softened by those sweet influences of sun a=
nd air that touch the=20

responsive earth like the benediction of Heaven. On that day Ivan scarcely =
noticed its beauty; but=20

in after years the memory often returned to him,--like the last happy, untr=
oubled look we have=20

seen on some beloved face, ere it is dimmed by those shadows of disease and=
 pain that prelude=20

the darker shadow of the grave.  At length he reached the house of Petrovit=
ch, dismissed his=20

drosky, and walked in. He was accustomed to enter the old man=E2=80=99s pre=
sence unannounced, to be=20

recognized by the sound of his footsteps, and affectionately welcomed.  It =
was now almost four=20

years since Petrovitch had become totally blind. God=E2=80=99s hand had tou=
ched him gently, and the=20

touch softened and ennobled him. The interests of commercial life, the buyi=
ng, selling, and getting=20

gain, which once occupied him so intensely, had faded from him now; and if =
still he ruled his=20

household with a strong hand, it was less by fear and more by love. Feodor =
had learned to read on=20

purpose to while away the long hours for him, though there were not many bo=
oks in the Prussian=20

language likely to interest him. For romances in the French style, whether =
translated or imitated,=20

he cared nothing at all; history, which he would have greatly enjoyed, had =
still to be naturalized in=20

Russia; and, unhappily, the best Book of all was then locked away from the =
Russian in a casket of=20

which the key was well-nigh lost--the old Slavonic tongue, more unintelligi=
ble to Petrovitch than the=20

English of Chaucer would be to us. But a friend of his, Pope Yefim, a pries=
t of much more than=20

average intelligence and seriousness, used often to visit him, and to tell =
him Scripture narratives,=20

and repeat for him prayers or passages from the Psalter. =E2=80=9CI can no =
longer raise my eyes to the=20

holy pictures,=E2=80=9D Petrovitch was wont to say, =E2=80=9Cso I must lear=
n to lift up my heart to God.=E2=80=9D  To-day Ivan=20

found him surrounded by several members of his family. His eldest son stood=
 before him; two or=20

three others, sons or grandsons, were at hand; and Feodor, now a fine lad o=
f sixteen, had perched=20

himself as usual upon one of the arms of his chair.  =E2=80=9CFather, your =
will is law,=E2=80=9D Ivan Petrovitch was=20

saying. =E2=80=9CStill it is rather hard upon me to be chained to desk and =
ledger because I am the eldest=20

son, while sons, nephews, and grandsons are doing their duty.=E2=80=9D  =E2=
=80=9CThou too wilt be doing thine,=E2=80=9D the=20

old man returned. =E2=80=9CWhat if it be a harder one? Is it thy part, or m=
ine, to choose?--But hush! are not=20

the footsteps that I hear those of my lord=E2=80=99s grandson?=E2=80=9D  Iv=
an came forward, and the usual=20

greetings were exchanged, though on his side in a tone of embarrassment, wh=
ich did not escape=20

the quick ear of Petrovitch.  =E2=80=9CPrince Ivan,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=
=80=9Cyou are in trouble. Do you wish to speak with=20

me alone?=E2=80=9D  Petrovitch usually gave Ivan the title of prince, altho=
ugh, on account of his father=E2=80=99s=20

disgrace and his own equivocal position, the heir of Pojarsky had forborne =
to assume it in general=20

society--a modest reticence which Petrovitch not only approved, but had him=
self actually=20

recommended.  =E2=80=9CIt is true, d=C3=A4dushka,=E2=80=9D Ivan answered=20


_
agriculture."[1] In 1839 members of the Society of Friends organized an ass=
ociation to establish a=20

school such as Humphreys had planned. The founders believed that "the most =
successful method=20

of elevating the moral and intellectual character of the descendants of Afr=
ica, as well as of=20

improving their social condition, is to extend to them the benefits of a go=
od education, and to=20

instruct them in the knowledge of some useful trade or business, whereby th=
ey may be enabled to=20

obtain a comfortable livelihood by their own industry; and through these me=
ans to prepare them=20

for fulfilling the various duties of domestic and social life with reputati=
on and fidelity as good=20

citizens and pious men."[2] Directing their attention first to things pract=
ical the association=20

purchased in 1839 a piece of land in Bristol township, Philadelphia County,=
 where they offered=20

boys instruction in farming, shoemaking, and other useful trades. Their end=
eavors, so far as=20

training in the mechanic arts was concerned, proved to be a failure. In 184=
6, therefore, the=20

management decided to discontinue this literary, agricultural, and manual l=
abor experiment. The=20

trustees then sold the farm and stock, apprenticed the male students to mec=
hanical occupations,=20

and opened an evening school. Thinking mainly of classical education therea=
fter, the trustees of=20

the fund finally established the Institute for Colored Youth of you alone.=
=E2=80=9D  At a sign from Petrovitch=20

the others left the room, and without waiting for Ivan to begin, the old ma=
n said, =E2=80=9CI know what you=20

feel. Speak freely. What can I do for you?=E2=80=9D  Ivan was greatly surpr=
ised at this address. Which of=20

those who were present last night, he asked himself, could possibly have to=
ld the story of his folly,=20

and how could it have found its way so quickly to the ears of Petrovitch?  =
=E2=80=9CI do not think you _can_=20

know what I feel,=E2=80=9D he began humbly; =E2=80=9CI am so utterly ashame=
d of myself. You have so often=20

warned me to be moderate in play, and as often have I made the best of reso=
lutions, and I meant=20

to keep them faithfully, but--=E2=80=9D  He came to a sudden stop, astonish=
ed, even terrified by the change=20

that swept over the sightless but expressive face of Petrovitch. Disappoint=
ment, sorrow, anger=20

chased each other rapidly, like clouds before a stormy wind; then all these=
 passed away and were=20

succeeded by something too sadly like contempt. Ivan stood in silent embarr=
assment, unable to=20

proceed with his story.  But he had said enough. After a pause, Petrovitch =
spoke in a cold,=20

constrained voice, =E2=80=9CSo _that_ is your trouble, Prince Ivan? You hav=
e lost money at play. How=20

much?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEight thousand seven hundred and fifty roubles,=E2=
=80=9D said Ivan in the low tones of penitence=20

and shame.  =E2=80=9CSilver or paper?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CPaper,=E2=80=9D sa=
id Ivan, rather more cheerfully. There was an enormous=20

difference=20

elsewhere.  [Footnote 1: _Special Report of the U.S. Com. of Ed._, 1871, p.=
 379.]  [Footnote 2:=20

_Ibid._, 1871, p. 379.]  Some of the philanthropists who promoted the pract=
ical education of the=20

colored people were found in the Negro settlements of the Northwest. Their =
first successful=20

attempt in that section was the establishment of the Emlen Institute in Mer=
cer County, Ohio. The=20

founding of this institution was due manly to the efforts of Augustus Wattl=
es who was instrumental=20

in getting a sum have been a large one in the eyes of extravagant Russian n=
obles.  =E2=80=9CDo me the=20

favour to call Feodor; you will find him in the next room.=E2=80=9D  Ivan o=
beyed; and Petrovitch, taking a=20

key which hung round his neck, gave it with a few directions to his grandso=
n.  Something in the old=20

merchant=E2=80=99s manner made Ivan stand before him in silence, without ve=
nturing a word of explanation=20

or of defence, until Feodor=E2=80=99s return.  The boy gave his grandfather=
 a roll of bank-notes, clean and=20

crisp, and=20


_
freedmen to leave Cincinnati and settle in this county about 1835.[1] Wattl=
es traveled in almost=20

every colored neighborhood of the State and laid before them the benefits o=
f permanent homes=20

and the education for their children. On his first journey he organized, wi=
th the assistance of=20

abolitionists, twenty-five schools for colored children. Interested thereaf=
ter in providing a head for=20

this system he purchased for himself ninety acres of land in Mercer County =
to establish a manual=20

labor institution. He sustained a school on it at his own expense, till the=
 11th of November, 1842.=20

Wattles then  In perfect silence the old man handed the notes to Ivan, who =
tried to express his=20

thanks; but Petrovitch stopped him. =E2=80=9CThe money,=E2=80=9D he said co=
ldly, =E2=80=9Cis a matter of indifference to me.=20

You are more than welcome to it, Prince Ivan.=E2=80=9D Never until to-day h=
ad he addressed him in such a=20

tone.  Ivan drew near, knelt down before his chair, and took his hand affec=
tionately. =E2=80=9CDear old=20

friend,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CI see that I have wounded you. Forgive m=
