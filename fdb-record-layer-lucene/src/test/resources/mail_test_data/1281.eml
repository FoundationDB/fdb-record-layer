scribed on OB as a=20

diameter, and the angle _y_O_x_ at the circumference stands upon an arc who=
se chord is _xy_.=20

Again, if from _a_ we draw _ad_ perpendicular to C_c_, it will be the sine =
of the arc _ac_ (=3D AB +=20

BC). If now we describe a circle on _a_O as diameter, it will pass through =
_d_, (see Euc. 31. 3.)=20

therefore _ad_ is the chord of an arc on which the angle _a_O_c_ stands in =
the circle described=20

on _a_O. But in equal circles the chords of arcs on which equal angles at t=
he centres or=20

circumferences stand are equal; (see Euc. 26. and 29. 3.) hence _xy_ =3D _a=
