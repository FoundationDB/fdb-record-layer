pole; make a monkey of yourself. Climb down, again. Now," tapping the table, "be a dead snake. 

Very good. Now, show them what you think of strangers." She motioned to Oscar; but he edged 

back behind Nora, muttering, "No, they are nasty!"  Then Nora stepped forward. Instantly the 

snake coiled itself up, hissing.  "Now, you," said Lady Margaret to Edmund.  "He won't be afraid of 

me," laughed Edmund, stretching forth his hand; "come, pet!"  And to Lady Margaret's surprise the 

snake came, twining about the boy's wrist as it was used to twine about hers. "Ah, you have my 

gift, my dear!" she cried, delighted.  She put the snake back in the box and excused herself for a 

moment. The page brought in the tea-tray. In a moment Lady Margaret returned and made the 

tea, Mrs. Morris who had been looking on all this while in a kind of trance of horror, recovered 

enough, at these refreshing signs, to sink into a chair by a low table. She clutched her sister's arm-

-Nora sat next to her--and murmured, "Was there ever such an awful menagerie of a house?"  "Be 

quiet," whispered Nora.  "I can't be quiet! Those dreadful little monkey things are under the table, 

nibbling at my ankles, I shall _have_ to scream!"  "You can't scream. Don't disgrace your country. 

Lady Margaret will hear us, I much fear!"  "She's making tea at the other table. Besides, Mrs. 

Darrel and Eddy are talking to her, Nora. Are you sure that big dog is safe? Did you hear him 

growl? It was an awfully fierce-sounding growl! And, Nora, I _think_ one of the snakes is loose. 

There were six in the box and I can count only five--yes, Lady Margaret, the tea is quite right. It is 

delicious."  But though, in truth it was delicious, and though equally to be praised were the thin 

bread and butter, the Scotch shortbread from Edinburgh, and the English plum cake, Mrs. Morris 

never enjoyed a repast less. She spent her time making little sorties with her feet at the a manner 

which, had it been adopted by a foreigner, would have plunged Europe into war and finally tested 

the blue-water theory. Undoubtedly the immemorial traditions of English justice came in for very 

severe handling, simply because Priam would not take his collar off.  And he would not.  The next 

morning there were consultations in counsel's rooms, and the common law of the realm was 

ransacked to find a legal method of inspecting Priam's moles, without success. Priam arrived 

safely at the courts with his usual high collar, and was photographed thirty times between the kerb 

and the entrance hall.  "He's slept in it!" cried wags.  "Bet yer two ter one it's a clean 'un!" cried 

other wags. "His missus gets his linen up."  It was subject to such indignities that the man who had 

defied the Supreme Court of Judicature reached his seat in the theatre. When solicitors and 

counsel attempted to reason with him, he answered with silence. The rumour ran that in his hip 

pocket he was carrying a revolver wherewith to protect the modesty of his neck.  The celebrated 

artistes, having perceived the folly of losing six or seven hundred pounds a day because Priam 

happened to be an obstinate idiot, continued with the case. For Mr. Oxford and another army of 

experts of European reputation were waiting to prove that the pictures admittedly painted after the 

burial in the National Valhalla, were painted by Priam Farll, and could have been painted by no 

other. They demonstrated this by internal evidence. In other words, they proved by deductions 

from squares of canvas that Priam had moles on his neck. It was a phenomenon eminently legal. 

And Priam, in his stiff collar, sat and listened. The experts, however, achieved two feats, both 

unintentionally. They sent the judge soundly to sleep, and they wearied the public, which 

considered that the trial was falling short of its early promise. This _expertise_ went on to the 


_
with new zest; and she whispered to Nora that she was morally sure the sixth snake was crawling 

up her chair.  Nora, herself, was not at ease; nevertheless, her patriotic politeness conquered; she 

ate everything, looked at everything, praised everything. Lady Margaret found her "most 

agreeable."  Mrs. Darrel had seen the snakes too often to be disturbed, and Edmund was in his 

element. As for Oscar, he fell into sad disgrace--he kicked the marmosets. Lady Margaret was too 

kind to say anything; but Mrs. Morris did the subject justice all the way home. "At least you might 

have kicked them, quietly, under the table," said she; "but no, you do it sideways in full view of 

everyone!"  The next day the party journeyed on towards London. The sun shone brightly and the 

weather, which had been so abnormally cold as to require overcoats, or as the English term them, 

"top coats," grew warmer, so that there was nothing to mar enjoyment unless it were the lack of 

harmony between the two boys. This still continued. If there were times when Edmund felt his 

dislike yielding ever and appreciably more than another thousand pounds. And on the third day 

Priam, somewhat hardened to renown, reappeared with his mysterious neck, and more 

determined than ever. He had seen in a paper, which was otherwise chiefly occupied with moles 

and experts, a cautious statement that the police had collected the necessary _prima facie_ 

evidence of bigamy, and that his arrest was imminent. However, something stranger than arrest 

for bigamy happened to him.   _New Evidence_   The principal King's Bench corridor in the Law 

Courts, like the other main corridors, is a place of strange meetings and interviews. A man may 

receive there a bit of news that will change the whole of the rest of his life, or he may receive only 

an invitation to a mediocre lunch in the restaurant underneath; he never knows beforehand. Priam 

assuredly did not receive an invitation to lunch. He was traversing the crowded thoroughfares--for 

with the exception of match and toothpick sellers the corridor has the characteristics of a Strand 

pavement in the forenoon-- when he caught sight of Mr.

slightly to Oscar's good humor and gay spirits, his pride and his contempt for his cousin stiffened it 

at once.  It was two days after their arrival in a quiet town near London where they were to stay a 

few days for rest at a picturesque old inn, that Mrs. Morris received a letter from Mrs. Darrel. She 

read it at the breakfast table. Before she was half down the first page she turned to Nora: "There! 

Didn't I tell you one of those snakes was gone? Listen to this: exchanged no word with Mr. Oxford 

since the historic scene in the club, and he was determined to exchange no word; however, they 

had not gone through the formality of an open breach. The most prudent thing to do, therefore, 

was to turn and take another corridor. And Priam would have fled, being capable of astonishing 

prudence when prudence meant the avoidance of unpleasant encounters; but, just as he was 

turning, the woman in conversation with Mr. Oxford saw him,

over losing her pet snake, the one she called Marcus Aurelius. She thinks she didn't replace the 

cover of the box securely the day you were there, for she hasn't seen it since. She fears it crawled 

away and wandered into the village and was killed. Isn't she a dear old goose?'"  "Was it the little 

trick-snake?" said Oscar. "What a shame!"  Edmund said nothing; he was sorry for Lady Margaret 

and he was sorry for himself. The little Marcus Aurelius had made a deep impression on him; ever 

since he had been with the rapidity of thought, holding forth her hand. She was tall, thin, and stiffly 

distinguished in the brusque, Dutch-doll motions of her limbs. Her coat and skirt were quite 

presentable; but her feet were large (not her fault, of course, though one is apt to treat large feet 

as a crime), and her feathered hat was even larger. She hid her age behind a veil.  "How do you 

do, Mr. Farll?" she addressed him firmly, in a voice which nevertheless throbbed.  It was Lady 

Sophia Entwistle.  "How do you do?" he
