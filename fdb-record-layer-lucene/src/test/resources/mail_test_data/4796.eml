and violent concussions, jerks and wrenches, attended by an undulating, wav=
ing motion of the whole surface of the ground, not unlike the _
renunciable offices. The court clerk, the special commissioners, and the at=
torneys know nothing=20

else than how to obtain the greatest possible advantage from the purchase o=
f their offices. Without=20

any instruction in the obligations of those positions, because they cannot =
acquire it in that country,=20

and incapable of carrying out even what the ministers themselves have the p=
atience to teach=20

them, those men are, notwithstanding, the only ones whom the ministers can =
choose for those=20

offices, because they are likewise the only ones who can outbid others in t=
he sale of them. These=20

positions are also of little advantage, because in the immense extension of=
 the military jurisdiction,=20

among the wealthy persons of Filipinas, the tribunal of the War Department =
has drawn to itself all=20

the civil causes of importance in the islands; and the Audiencia has been r=
educed to criminal=20

causes, and the minor controversies over land among the Indians, for which =
reason it is=20

impossible to have educated Europeans who will purchase those posts and ser=
ve in them. The=20

consequence of this is that the offices of the Audiencia are in the utmost =
disorder; that they do not=20

contain even the books of entry which the laws provide for, or registers, c=
itations, or reports of=20

cases; that in order to record a decree or an official report it is necessa=
ry for a minister to take=20

upon himself the task of doing that; and, finally, that the administration =
of justice must necessarily=20

be slow. [Bernaldez therefore recommends that the ministers of the Audienci=
a be promoted at=20

least every ten years to other appointments; that the minor offices be no l=
onger purchasable or=20

renunciable, but filled directly by royal appointment, and given to suitabl=
e persons, with good=20

salaries (which are specified); and that the government of the islands prov=
ide some expedient for=20

raising money to pay the salary of an attorney-general in each province.]  =
  Of the alcaldes-mayor=20

and military governors of the provinces  [The office of alcalde-mayor and p=
rovincial governor=20

involves the civil government and defense of the province, the administrati=
on of justice, and the=20

collection of the taxes; but those who are appointed to it are usually only=
 traders, in reality, and=20

care more for the profits yielded by the trade that is permitted to them th=
an for the obligations of=20

their office. They are paid twenty-five hard dollars a month for salary, "a=
nd they pay to the treasury=20

the same sum for the indulto [i.e., privilege], as it is called there, of t=
rading," to which pursuit they=20

devote all their time and energies during the term of their office.] A syst=
em of alcaldeships so=20

anomalous and irregular nevertheless produced at the outset some benefits t=
o the islands,=20

because, by reason of the great lack of capitalists there, many products of=
 the agriculture and=20

industries of the provinces would have received no encouragement if the alc=
alde had not=20

speculated in them for the sake of his own trade. It is also necessary to n=
ote that there are=20

provinces with which, on account of their remoteness and the little advanta=
ge which they have for=20

the coasting trade, there was hardly any other means of communication than =
the barks of the=20

alcalde. But now, when the coasting trade has become so general, it is a ne=
cessity to abolish, in=20

most of the provinces of the islands, that absurd system of trading alcalde=
s; and to appoint in their=20

places corregidors, lawyers educated in Espaa, with only a salary, and the =
charge of making=20

collections for the royal revenue, with the right to the the Puritan divine=
s to admonish their flocks of=20

the wrath of God. Still another occasion of the same sort was given in 1658=
. But of this latter,=20

though we are told it was a very great earthquake, we have neither day nor =
month, nor any record=20

of its violence, extent or duration.  The first convulsion of which there i=
s any detailed account,=20

occurred in 1663, January 26-28, Old Style. An old narrative thus records i=
t:  =E2=80=9CAbout half an hour=20

after five in the evening a most terrible earthquake began. The heavens bei=
ng serene, there was=20



suddenly heard a roar like the noise of a great fire. Immediately the build=
ings were shaken with=20

amazing violence. Doors opened and shut of themselves with a fearful clatte=
ring. The bells rang=20

without their ropes being touched. Cracks appeared in the walls of building=
s, and floors separated=20

and in some cases fell down. Chasms appeared in the fields, and the hills s=
eemed to be in motion.=20

The fright of the inhabitants was shared by the beasts and birds, who sent =
forth fearful cries,=20

howlings and bellowings. The duration of this earthquake was very uncommon.=
 The first shock=20

continued half an hour before it was over, but it began to abate about a qu=
arter of an hour after it=20

began.=E2=80=9D (Probably there were a considerable number of shocks, gradu=
ally lessening in violence.)=20

=E2=80=9CThe same day about eight o=E2=80=99clock in the evening, there cam=
e a second shock, equally violent as=20

the first, and within the space of half an hour, there were two others. The=
 next day about three=20

hours from the morning, there was a violent shock, which lasted a long time=
, and the next night=20

counted some thirty-two shocks, of which many were violent. Nor did the tre=
mbling of the earth=20

cease until the July following. Many trees were torn up, and the outlines o=
f the mountains=20

appeared to be much changed. Many springs and small streams were dried up; =
in others the=20

waters became sulphurous, and the channels in which some had run were so al=
tered as to be=20

unrecognizable. Half way between Tadousac and Quebec two hills were thrown =
down and formed=20

a point of land which extended half a quarter of a league into the St. Lawr=
ence River. The island=20

Aux Coudres became larger than it was before, and the channel of the St. La=
wrence was greatly=20

changed.=E2=80=9D  This is, perhaps, as severe a shock as has been felt in =
this country; but though the=20

shock extended southward to Pennsylvania, its chief energy was centered in =
a narrow strip on the=20

St. Lawrence, giving our Canadian neighbors the lion=E2=80=99s share of the=
 fright. Other light shocks were=20

noticed in New England in 1665, 1668, 1669, 1670, 1705, and 1720.  October =
29, 1727, another=20

severe earthquake was experienced about 10:40 P.M. It seems to have had Sou=
thern New=20

Hampshire as its focus, extending thence to the Delaware and Kennebec river=
s. Its approach was=20

heralded by a subdued roar from the northwest, which, as it drew nearer, =
=E2=80=9Cwas thought to be the=20

roar of a blazing chimney near at hand, and at last was likened to the ratt=
ling of carriages driven=20

fiercely over pavements. In about half a minute from the time the noise was=
 first heard, the=20

earthquake was felt. It was observed by those who were abroad that, as the =
shake passed under=20

them, the surface of the earth rose and sank.=E2=80=9D Houses trembled and =
rocked, as though about to=20

fall to pieces. Movables were dashed about with a fearful clatter. Crockery=
 was smashed; stone=20

walls and chimneys thrown down.  At Newbury, ashes and sulphur were cast fo=
rth from the earth,=20

and also volumes of sand. Sulphuretted hydrogen seems to have been=20


_
the Audiencia there. This increase in expenditure should be covered by the =
duties which ought to=20

be imposed on the coasting trade, which by this means remains free from all=
 impediment.=20

[Bernaldez urges that the provincial magistrates be carefully selected, for=
 their knowledge,=20

experience, discretion, and executive ability; and that they be men who wil=
l devote themselves to=20

the proper administration of justice, the study of those regions hitherto u=
nknown, plans of reform,=20

and the encouragement of industry and commerce among the people--not forget=
ting to preserve=20

friendly relations with the parish priests. He recommends that seventeen of=
 the provinces in the=20

islands of Luzon, Panay, and Ceb be divided into corregidorships, eight int=
o those of the first=20

class, and nine into those of the second, with specified salaries to each; =
that appointments to=20

these posts be made large quantities: also chemicals readily decomposed by =
warmth and=20

moisture.  A correspondent of the Royal Society wrote that a clergyman near=
 Boston assured him=20

=E2=80=9Cthat immediately after the earthquake there was such a stink that =
the family could scarce bear to=20

be in the house for a considerable time that night.=E2=80=9D Another clergy=
man writes that in the following=20

April the fine sand thrown up by the earthquake =E2=80=9Chad a very offensi=
ve stench--nay, it was more=20

nauseous than a putrefying corpse: yet, in a very little while after, it ha=
d no smell at all. How long it=20

was before it began to have this stench, I am not certain; but I believe it=
 was covered with snow=20

until a little while before.=E2=80=9D Another minister records that =E2=80=
=9Cabout three days before the earthquake=20

there was perceived an ill-stinking smell, in the water of several wells. S=
ome searched their wells,=20

but found nothing=20


_
and that corregidors of the first class be proposed by the Audiencia.]    O=
f the taxes  [At present,=20

the tribute paid by the Indians should not be increased because so many of =
them would be=20

distressed by any heavier tax; but this might be done later, when the class=
 of large proprietors may=20

have increased in numbers. The payment of this tax in kind is a source of l=
oss, not only in the=20

quantity and quality of the products paid in, but in the damage caused by t=
ransportation and=20

storage; and in selling the products thus received by the government there =
is loss, because its=20

agents are poor managers of such business, not having the shrewdness or the=
 knowledge of the=20

markets which enable private merchants to make their profits. The commutati=
on of the payment=20

from money to kind was only partly due to the influence of the alcaldes, wh=
o preferred it for the=20

benefit of their own trading;] the cause which has rendered that commutatio=
n almost was so strong=20

and offensive that for eight or ten days they entirely omitted using it. In=
 the deepest of these wells,=20

which was about thirty-six feet, the water was turned to a brimstone color,=
 but had nothing of the=20

smell, and was thick like puddle water.=E2=80=9D Some wells, dry just befor=
e the shock, immediately filled=20

up. Occasional shocks were felt for some months after.  From the phenomena =
present here, and=20

in many similar cases, it will appear that large volumes of pent-up  [Illus=
tration: SCENE AT=20

CHARLESTON.]  gases may be discharged in districts remote from any volcanic=
 region. In some=20

instances, we are informed that immediately after severe shocks, the stream=
s and vegetation have=20

proved poisonous to cattle. There were light shocks felt in 1732, 1737 and =
1744; but none of these=20

are said to have done any damage beyond throwing down a few stone walls. Th=
us we find within a=20

century fourteen earthquake periods in New England alone; and in=20


_
directly to the prejudice of the Indian, is the lack of a colonial money pe=
culiar to the Filipinas=20

Islands, like that which the other possessions in Asia have (of the necessi=
ty of which I will speak in=20

another chapter), in order to revive internal commerce and promote and faci=
litate the payment of=20

taxes.  The indirect taxes by means of government monopolies in Filipinas a=
re, in my opinion,=20

those most suitable to the native disposition of inhabitants who, furnished=
 most abundantly by the=20

soil with all the income necessary for their support, convert the superfluo=
us enjoyments of life into=20

objects of prime necessity. of several months. Comparing the small area wit=
h the whole region,=20

and remembering that shocks are more frequent in the central, southern and =
western portions of=20

the country, it is fair to conclude that the merest tithe of those actually=
 occurring could have come=20

under the notice of our ancestors.  The most violent shock ever known in Ne=
w England came=20

eighteen days after the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755, preceded by a pecu=
liar, rumbling roar.=20

Then came a =E2=80=9Crapid, jarring, vibrating motion,=E2=80=9D with an upw=
ard shock: then a =E2=80=9Cviolent, prodigious=20

shock, as suddenly, to all appearances as a thunderclap breaking upon a=20
