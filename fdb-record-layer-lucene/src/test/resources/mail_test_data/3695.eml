Evolution in Reverse_]   It was not very large, as asteroids go, but about =
it clung a silvery mist of=20

atmosphere. Deeper flashes through the mist betokened water, and green patc=
hes hinted of rich=20

vegetation. The space-patroller circled the little world knowledgeably, lik=
e a wasp buzzing around=20

an apple. In the control room, by the forward ports, the Martian skipper ad=
dressed his Terrestrial=20

companion.  "I wissh you joy of yourr new home," he purred. Like many Marti=
ans, he was braced=20

upright on his lower tentacles by hoops and buckles around his bladdery bod=
y, so that he had=20

roughly a human form, over which lay a strange loose armor of light plates.=
 In the breathing hole of=20

his petal-tufted skull was lodged an artificial voice-box that achieved wor=
ds. "I rregrret--"  Fitzhugh=20

Parr glowered back. He was tall, even for a man of Earth, and his long-jawe=
d young face darkened=20

with wrath. "Regret nothing," he snapped. "You're jolly glad to drop me on =
this little hell."  "Hell?"=20

repeated the Martian reproachfully. "But it iss a ssplendid miniaturre worr=
ld--nineteen of yourr=20

miless in diameterr, with arrtificial grravity centerr to hold airr and wat=
err; ssown, too, with=20

Terresstrrial plantss. And companionss of yourr own rrace."  [Illustration:=
 _"You! They drive you=20

out?" A thick, unsure voice accosted mockery. It's not shining at all they =
are at this time, but duck=20

yellow and dark.  NANNY. To leave the big house blazing after us, it was th=
at crowned all! Two=20

houses to be burned to ashes in the one night. It is likely the servant-gir=
ls were rising from the=20

feathers, and the cocks crowing from the rafters for seven miles around, ta=
king the flames to be=20

the whitening of the dawn.  BIDDY. It is the lad is stretched beyond you ha=
ve to be thankful to for=20

that. There was never seen a leader was his equal for spirit and for daring=
! Making a great scatter=20

of the guards the way he did! Running up roofs and ladders, the fire in his=
 hand, till you'd think he=20

would be apt to strike his head against the stars.  NANNY. I partly guessed=
 death was near him,=20

and the queer shining look he had in his two eyes, and he throwing sparks e=
ast and west through=20

the beams. I wonder now was it some inward wound he got, or did some hardy =
lad of the Browns=20

give him a tip on the skull unknownst in the fight? It was I myself found h=
im, and the troop of the=20



Whiteboys gone, and he lying by the side of a wall as weak as if he had kno=
cked a mountain. I=20

failed to waken him, trying him with the sharpness of my nails, and his hea=
d fell back when I=20

moved it, and I knew him to be spent and gone.  BIDDY. It's a pity you not =
to have left him where=20

he was lying, and said no word at all to Paudeen or to that son you have, t=
hat kept us back from=20

following on, bringing him here to this shelter on sacks and upon poles.  N=
ANNY. What way could=20

I help letting a screech out of myself and the life but just gone out of hi=
m in the darkness, and not a=20

living Christian by his side but myself and the great God?  BIDDY. It's on =
ourselves the vengeance=20

of the red soldiers will fall, they to find us sitting here the same as har=
es in a tuft. It would be best=20

for us follow after the rest of the army of the Whiteboys.  NANNY. Whist, I=
 tell you! The lads are=20

cracked about him. To get but the wind of the word of leaving him, it's lit=
tle but they'd knock the=20

head off the two of us. Whist!            [_Enter_ JOHNNY B. _with candles.=
_]  JOHNNY B.=20

[_standing over_ MARTIN]. Wouldn't you say now there was some malice or som=
e venom in the=20

air, that is striking down one after the other the whole of the heroes of t=
he Gael?  PAUDEEN. It=20

makes a person be thinking of the four last ends, death and judgment, heave=
n and hell. Indeed=20

and indeed my heart lies with him. It is well I knew what man he was under =
his by-name and his=20

disguise. [_Sings._]      Oh, Johnny Gibbons, it's you were the prop to us!=
     You to have left us we=20

are put astray!  JOHNNY B. It is lost we are now and broken to the end of o=
ur days. There is no=20

satisfaction at all but to be destroying the English; and where now will we=
 get so good a leader=20

again? Lay him out fair and straight upon a stone, till I will let loose th=
e secret of my heart keening=20

him! [_Sets out candles on a rack, propping them with stones._]  NANNY. Is =
it mould=20

"There's a catch," rejoined Parr. "Something you Martian swine think is a h=
eap big joke. I can see=20

that, captain."  The tufted head wagged. "Underr trreaty between Marrs and =
Earrth, judgess of one=20

planet cannot ssentence to death crriminalss frrom the otherr, not even for=
r murrderr--"  "It wasn't=20

for murder!" exploded Parr. "I struck in self-defense!"  "I cannot arrgue t=
he point. Yourr victim wass=20

a high official perrhapss inssolent, but you Earrth folk forrget how eassy =
ourr crraniumss crrack=20

underr yourr blowss. Anyway, you do not die--you arre exiled. Prreparre to =
dissembarrk."  Behind=20

them three Martian space-hands, sprawling like squids near the control-boar=
d, made flutelike=20

comments to each other. The tentacle of each twiddled an electro-automatic =
pistol.  "Rremove=20

tunic and bootss," directed the skipper. "You will not need them. Quickly, =
ssirr!"  Parr glared at the=20

levelled weapons of the space-hands, then shucked his upper garment and kic=
ked off his boots.=20

He stood up straight and lean-muscled, in a pair of duck shorts. His fists =
clenched at his sides.=20

"Now we grround," the skipper continued, and even as he spoke there came th=
e shock of the=20

landfall. The inner panel opened, then the outer hatch. Sunlight beat into =
the chamber. "Goodbye,"=20

said the skipper formally. "You have thirrty ssecondss, Earrth time, to wal=
k clearr of our blasstss=20

beforre we take off. Marrch."  Parr strode out upon dark, rich soil. He sen=
sed behind him the silent=20

quiver of Martian laughter, and felt a new ecstasy of hate for his late gua=
rds, their race, and the=20

red planet that spawned them. Not until he heard the rumble and swish of th=
e ship's departure did=20

he take note of the Bacach? It is great riches you should have in your pock=
et to be going to those=20

lengths and not to be content with dips.  JOHNNY B. It is lengths I will no=
t be going to the time the=20

life will be gone out of your own body. It is not your corpse I will be wis=
hful to hold in honour the=20

way I hold this corpse in honour.  NANNY. That's the way always: there will=
 be grief and quietness=20

in the house if it is a young person has died, but funning and springing an=
d tricking one another if it=20

is an old person's corpse is in it. There is no compassion at all for the o=
ld.  PAUDEEN. It is he=20

would have got leave for the Gael to be as high as the Gall. Believe me, he=
 was in the prophecies.=20

Let you not be comparing yourself with the like of him.  NANNY. Why wouldn'=
t I be comparing=20

myself? Look at all that was against me in the world; would you be matching=
 me against a man of=20

his sort that had the people shouting for him and that had nothing to do bu=
t to die and to go to=20

heaven?  JOHNNY B. The day you go to heaven that you may never come back al=
ive out of it! But=20

it is not yourself will ever hear the saints hammering at their musics! It =
is you will be moving=20

through the ages chains upon you, and you in the form of a dog or a monster=
! I tell you, that one=20

will go through purgatory as quick as lightning through a thorn bush.  NANN=
Y. That's the way,=20

that's the way:             Three that are watching my time to run         =
   The worm, the devil, and my=20

son.            To see a loop around their neck            It's that would =
make my heart to leap!=20

JOHNNY B. Five white candles. I wouldn't begrudge them to him, indeed. If h=
e had held out and=20

held up, it is my belief he would have=20


_
At first view it wasn't really bad. At second, it wasn't really strange. Th=
e sky, by virtue of an Earth-

type atmosphere, shone blue with wispy clouds, and around the small plain o=
n which he stood=20

sprouted clumps and thickets of green tropical trees. Heathery ferns, with =
white and yellow edges=20

to their leaves, grew under his bare feet. The sun, hovering at zenith, gav=
e a July warmth to the=20

air. The narrow horizon was very near, of course, but the variety of thicke=
ts and the broken nature=20

of the land beyond kept it from seeming too different from the skyline of E=
arth. Parr decided that=20

he might learn to endure, even to enjoy. Meanwhile, what about the other Te=
rrestrials exiled here?=20

And, as Parr wondered, he heard their sudden, excited voices.  Threats and =
oaths rent the balmy=20

Ireland!  PAUDEEN. Wait till the full light of the day and you'll see the b=
urying he'll have. It is not in=20

this place we will be waking him. I'll make a call to the two hundred Ribbo=
ns he was to lead on to=20

the attack on the barracks at Aughanish. They will bring him marching to hi=
s grave upon the hill.=20

He had surely some gift from the other world, I wouldn't say but he had pow=
er from the other side.=20

ANDREW [_coming in, very shaky_]. Well, it was a great night he gave to the=
 village, and it is long=20

till it will be forgotten. I tell you the whole of the neighbours are up ag=
ainst him. There is no one at=20

all this morning to set the mills going. There was no bread baked in the ni=
ght-time; the horses are=20

not fed in the stalls; the cows are not milked in the sheds. I met no man a=
ble=20


_
solid blows. Parr broke into a run, shoved through some broad-leafed bushes=
, and found himself=20

in the midst of the excitement.         *       *       *       *       *  =
A dozen men, with scraggly beards and=20

skimpy rags of clothing, were setting upon an unclassifiable creature that =
snarled and fought back.=20

It was erect and coarsely hairy--Parr saw that much before the enigma gave =
up the unequal fight=20

and ran clumsily away into a mass of bright-flowered scrub. Execrations and=
 a volley of sticks and=20

stones speeded its flight.  Then the mob was aware of Parr. Every man--they=
 were all male=20

Terrestrials--turned toward him, with something like respect. One of them, =
tall and thin, spoke=20

diffidently:  "You just arrived?"  "I was just booted out, ten minutes ago,=
" Parr informed him.=20

"Why?"  "Because you're our new chief," responded the thin man, bowing. "Th=
e latest comer=20

always commands here."  Parr must have goggled, for the thin one smiled thr=
ough tawny stubble.=20

"The latest comer is always highest and wisest," he elaborated. "He is heal=
thiest. Best. The longer=20

you stay on this asteroid, the lower you fall."  Parr thought he was he put=
 it on my own head and=20

on the head of the boy that is lying there before us.... Is there no sign o=
f life in him at all?=20

JOHNNY B. What way would there be a sign of life and the life gone out of h=
im this three hours or=20

more?  ANDREW. He was lying in his sleep for a while yesterday, and he wake=
ned again after=20

another while.  NANNY. He will not waken. I tell you I held his hand in my =
own and it getting cold=20

as if you were pouring on it the coldest cold water, and no running in his =
blood. He is gone sure=20

enough, and the life is gone out of him.  ANDREW. Maybe so, maybe so. It se=
ems to me=20

yesterday his cheeks were bloomy all the while, and now he is as pale as wo=
od-ashes. Sure we all=20

must come to it at the last. Well, my white-headed darling, it is you were =
the bush among us all,=20

and you to be cut down in your prime. Gentle and simple, everyone liked you=
. It is no narrow heart=20

you had; it is you were for spending and not for getting. It is you made a =
good wake for yourself,=20

scattering your estate in one night only in beer and in wine for the whole =
province; and that you=20

may be sitting in the middle of paradise and in=20
