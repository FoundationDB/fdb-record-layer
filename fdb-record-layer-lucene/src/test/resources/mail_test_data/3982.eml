Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project 

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized 

under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue 

Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax members might reasonably be expected to come 

forward at such a juncture; and as Ronald had no part or interest in this matter he made bold to 

turn to Mr. Weems, who sate beside him, and engage him in talk on their own account.  Indeed, he
