College has given him a decided advantage for education and there are few t=
hings that he cannot=20

discuss intelligently. He has come in contact with thousands of students an=
d all of the ministers=20

connected with the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the State of Flori=
da and has attended all=20

of the State and General Conferences of this Church for the past half centu=
ry. He has lived to be=20

85 years of age and says he will live until he is 106. This he will do beca=
use he claims: "Your life is=20

in your hand" and tells these narratives as proof:  "In 1886 when the prese=
nt Atlantic Coast Line=20

Railroad was called the S.F.W. and I was coming from Savannah to Florida, s=
ome tramps intent=20

upon robbery had removed spikes from the bridge and just as the alarm was g=
iven and the train=20

about to be thrown from the track, I raised the window and jumped to safety=
. I then walked back=20

two miles to report it. More than 70 were killed who might have been saved =
had they jumped as I=20

did. As a result, the S.F. and W. gave me a free pass for life with which I=
 rode all over the United=20

States and once into Canada." He proudly displays this pass and states that=
 he would like to travel=20

over the United States again but that the school keeps him too close.  "I h=
ad been very sick but=20

took no medicine; my wife went out to visit Sister Nancy--shortly afterward=

like walking, and in my imagination saw death entering, push the door open =
and draw back to leap=20

 Hodges, a Baptist=20

preacher was hoeing in his garden next door, looked at me and laughed. A th=

their conquests--but they do not found highly organized empires, they do no=

the foster-children of the she-wolf. Plunder, in the animal lust of which a=
lone it originated, remains=20

n, imposed by the extent of=20

its territory, into satrapies, which, as the central dynasty, enervated by =
sensuality, loses its force,=20

revolt, and break up the empire. Even the Macedonian, pupil of Aristotle th=
ough he was, did not=20

create an empire at all comparable to that created by the Romans. He overra=
n an immense extent=20

of territory, and scattered over a portion of it the seed of an inferior sp=
ecies of Hellenic civilization,=20

but he did not organize it politically, much less did he give it, and throu=
gh it the world, a code of=20

law. It at once fell apart into a number of separate kingdoms, the despotic=
 rulers of which were=20

Sultans with a tinge of Hellenism, and which went for nothing in the politi=
cal development of=20

mankind.  What if the very opposite theory to that of the she-wolf and her =
foster- children should=20

be true? What if the Romans should have owed their peculiar and unparallele=
d success to their=20
