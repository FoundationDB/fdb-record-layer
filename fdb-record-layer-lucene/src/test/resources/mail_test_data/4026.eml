out most civilized nations to be the most _
to examine the charge-sheet, and took the accusation as it had been framed =
by the police, without=20

inquiring about its accuracy. The evidence was yet, however, of the flimsie=
st character, and=20

scandalously incomplete. The cheque was not in court; and so many other ess=
ential ingredients of=20

the case were only conspicuous by their absence, that Mr. Snayke should mer=
ely ask the bench to=20

remand the prisoner. An insignificant fact or two were then given in eviden=
ce, and the prisoner,=20

who offered no objection, was remanded for seven days. He would have acquie=
sced in a remand=20

for seven or ten times seventy months. Much as the stupid and mean thief di=
sliked the house of=20

detention, its diet, and its restraints, he had an intenser dread of what i=
s called "a trial," with its=20

inevitable sequel, a conviction. He drew a species or a degree of comfort f=
rom the philosophy of=20

Hamlet. He would very much rather bear the ills he had, than fly to others =
which appalled by their=20

very uncertainty. He had not yet arrived at that other stage of criminal ph=
ilosophy (which a genteel=20

villain named William Roupell found, it is said, in Spain) that draws its o=
nly consolation out of=20

knowing the worst.  After the first examination of the prisoner, Mr. Snayke=
 intimated to Mr. Croak=20

he thought it very desirable to have a consultation as early as possible. M=
r. Croak understood, or--

not to pay him an undue compliment--he roofless houses stood amid the grove=
s. A fragment of the=20

_Eber=E2=80=99s_ bow was high upon the beach. Far up the western reef the _=
Adler_ lay. The _Olga_=20

stood unharmed upon the eastern shoal. Before the consulate, the _Nipsic_ w=
as fast in the sand.=20

Only the bow of the _Vandalia=E2=80=99s_ hull could be seen. By her side wa=
s the _Trenton_, grand though=20

in ruin. And above the desolation floated the Star Spangled Banner, triumph=
ant over the storm.=20

CHAPTER XII.  ELECTRIC STORMS.                            =E2=80=9CFar alon=
g,     From peak to peak the=20

rattling crags among,     Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud, =
    But every mountain=20

now hath found a tongue,     And Jura answers through her misty shroud,    =
 Back to the joyous=20

Alps, who call to her aloud!      And this is in the night:--Most glorious =
night!     Thou wert not sent=20

for slumber! let me be     A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,     A po=
rtion of the tempest and of=20

thee!     How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,     And the big rain c=
omes dancing to the earth!=20

And now again =E2=80=99tis black--and now, the glee,     Of the loud hills =
shakes with its mountain mirth,=20

As if they did rejoice o=E2=80=99er a young earthquake=E2=80=99s birth.=E2=
=80=9D   Who has not quailed before the storm?=20

Few, indeed, are they whose spirits kindle with the flash of the lightning,=
 and joy in the roar of the=20

thunder, that fills the heavens like the voice of many=20


_
therefore indorsed the learned counsel's brief with that potent word "consu=
ltation," and with the yet=20

more potent figure of two guineas.  A meeting between attorney and counsel =
took place that very=20

afternoon at the chambers of Mr. Snayke. Mr. Croak attended it himself, and=
 nobody else was=20

there. It was a secret meeting; but I shall take the liberty of drawing asi=
de the veil, and letting the=20

reader into this consultation. I shall ask him to prick up his ears, so tha=
t he may lose nothing of the=20

conversation, and to concentrate his attention, so that he may understand w=
hat he hears.  "Mr.=20

Croak."  "Yes, sir."  "Pray be seated."  "Thank you, sir."  This was the fr=
igid tone of a greeting=20

between the mouthy criminal advocate and the patron attorney who buttered h=
is bread on both=20

sides. I am told that this bumptiousness on the one hand, and humbleness on=
 the other, is the=20

almost invariable style of intercourse between the technically upper and th=
e technically lower=20

ranks of the legal profession. Much of the power of wig and gown is said to=
 depend upon the=20

maintenance of a relative status in the business of the law.  After a momen=
t or two of iciness, Mr.=20

Snayke's consciousness of what was due to the attorney warmed him, so he gr=
ew polite and more=20

condescending towards his inferior brother and paymaster.  "You see, Croak,=
" said the great=20

Snayke, "that it is very important to frame this charge against the prisone=
r accurately, and I should=20

like to know the real facts of the case--such as can be established in evid=
ence exactly--which I do=20

not yet. Did the prisoner steal a cheque with the amount and so forth fille=
d in, and with his master's=20

signature attached in his master's own handwriting, or did the fellow steal=
 a blank cheque, and fill=20

it in, and sign it with his master's name? The distinction is important to =
the prisoner himself,=20

because the different facts establish different crimes; but the prosecutor =
is far more interested, as=20

it seems to me, in this part of the affair than the accused."  "Pardon me, =
sir, if I say I don't see=20

_that_," the attorney ventured to say.  "Oh, obviously," replied Mr. Snayke=
. "If the cheque had=20

been perfectly drawn by the prosecutor--if it had his signature making the =
50_l._ 4_s._ 1-1/2_d._=20

payable to Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid or bearer--if it was a complete and =
genuine cheque, then=20

it is plain that the loss must be borne by Mr. Crapp. It was an act of embe=
zzlement of a cheque or=20

its proceeds by his own clerk. Suppose, on the other hand, that the prisone=
r stole a blank cheque,=20

and wrote his master's name at the foot thereof, that would be a forgery; a=
nd the bank must bear=20

the loss, because they have no right or authority to pay forged cheques."  =
A light entered the head=20

of the attorney. He was lawyer enough to see a point when his microscopic v=
ision had been=20

sharpened, and when the point was held up to him. He told Mr. Snayke that h=
e could is the heart=20

that in such scenes can mount with a Byron, and say to the Avernian gloom t=
hat wraps the=20

frightened world,                                =E2=80=9CLet me be     A p=
ortion of the tempest and of thee!=E2=80=9D  Only that=20

fiery, untameable spirit, fearless of man or demon, dare so approach the Ki=
ng of the Storm, or pat=20

the mane of Ocean in his wrath. A thousand plaudits has he won--but not a f=
ollower: for when the=20

lightning flames and roars, the cheering rabble slink away in fear, nor dar=
e to emulate that genius,=20

strange and wild as chaos as itself.  [Illustration: THE LYSE FIORD.]  The =
fear of the tempest=20

belongs to every age. The ancient Greeks, from whom the Romans borrowed and=
 modified the=20

myth, told how Hephaistos toiled in his volcanic forge to form the bolts of=
 Zeus, great father of=20

gods and men. These flaming weapons could none oppose. By them rebellious g=
iants were=20

overturned. And the bold Goth, rugged and vigorous, heard the voice of the =
war-god, Thor, shout=20

to him:      =E2=80=9CMine eyes are the lightning,      The wheels of my ch=
ariot      Roll in the thunder!=E2=80=9D  The=20

Arab saw the wild combat of genii, whom the great Solomon had not subdued. =
Woe to the luckless=20



wight who should arouse their ill-will! The Arabian Nights tell us of a con=
test between one of these=20

spirits of fire and a beautiful princess, versed in magic. The swarthy Moor=
 beheld the hand of God,=20

waving on his angels to contest with the hosts of evil: and the same idea o=
f wild combat in the=20

spirit world is found in the myths of the Caribs and Lapps. In the Hindoo c=
osmogony, the lightning=20

and storm are the chief weapons of Siva, the destroyer, who will one day bl=
ot the world out of=20

existence. Only in the red man=E2=80=99s tales do we find the idea of the C=
hristian world, of one Great=20

Spirit who rules all nature. In the Persian mythology, lightning and gloom =
represent the contest=20

between the forces of Ahriman, prince of evil, and Ormuzd, the great creato=
r and preserver of=20

good. And among the old Etruscans, from whom the Romans borrowed many rites=
 and=20

ceremonies, the lightning was one of the chief objects in their system of a=
ugury and divination. A=20

favorable flash of lightning outweighed all portents of ill. The thunder wa=
s the voice of the gods,=20

communicating their will to men.  And so the ancients were content to pass =
the mystery by,=20

unsolved. Now and then a Pliny, a Seneca, an Aristotle, ventured a timid sp=
eculation upon the=20

origin and cause of lightning, but as electricity was an unknown force to t=
hem, their conjectures=20

were as wild as the chim=C3=A6rical tales of Cimmerian darkness in ultra-Sc=
ythian realms, or of the=20

Utopian haven of bliss, where the Hyperboreans dwelt. But one of their vari=
ous conjectures is=20

worthy of note, as it contains an element of truth. It was, that the lightn=
ing was produced by mutual=20

friction or violent concussion of the clouds.  Since electricity has been r=
ecognized as the agent in=20

the=20


_
distinctly say--he had not positively ascertained from the prosecutor--whet=
her or not the cheque=20

was stolen in blank, or after it had been filled up and signed. He would se=
e how the matter stood in=20

this respect, and further instruct Mr. Snayke.  The attorney afterwards had=
 a conference with his=20

client, in which he endeavoured to expound the law of the case to the prose=
cutor before he sought=20

to learn how the facts stood. I don't know what the reader may think of thi=
s order of proceeding. It=20

strikes me as having not been quite logical, or morally correct. It was ver=
y like giving Mr. Crapp a=20

hint how he might shape the facts, and throw off a burden or loss from his =
own shoulders to those=20

of the banker. Until indeed this result of the legal demonstration was made=
 quite apparent to the=20

prosecutor, he could not be induced to tax his memory about the facts.  "Yo=
u see," said Mr. Croak,=20

"if you really did fill up and sign the cheque, and happened to suffer it t=
o lie about unnoticed for an=20

hour or two; or suppose, after filling it up and signing it, you handed it =
to Thinshanks to post to=20

thunder storms, inquiry as to whether it is a cause or a result of the form=
ation of clouds, has=20

produced evidence in favor of the latter fact (though clouds differently ch=
arged have mutual=20

attraction for each other), for rapid motion of gases may be made to genera=
te electricity. A natural=20

sequence would be that thunder storms are most violent where clouds are hea=
viest. Hence,=20

thunder storms are naturally most frequent and violent in the tropics, wher=
e the greater heat=20

produces immense masses of vapor. and are unknown in the polar world, where=
 the comparative=20

dryness of the atmosphere is unfavorable. The unusual amount of electricity=
 in dense clouds in=20

rapid motion is shown by the tremendous electrical displays attendant upon =
tornadoes and=20

cyclones. Another illustration of lightning resulting from cloud agency, ra=
ther than controlling them,=20

may be found in the cloudless Sahara, where evidences of electricity are so=
metimes to be=20

observed in the time of the Khamsin, while the thunder storm is unknown. On=
e notable exception=20

to the rule that thunder storms are violent and frequent in all=20


_
without authority, and appropriated to his own use the proceeds--?"  "Well,=
 suppose he did. That's=20

what he did do, I dare say," replied Mr. Crapp.  "I hope not," rejoined the=
 attorney.  "Hope not!=20

What's the use of hoping not? the blackguard's bad enough for any thing."  =
"No doubt he is; but,=20

you see, if he stole a cheque after you had signed it, we couldn't say that=
 he forged your signature,=20

could we?"  "No, I suppose not; but what matters about that? Isn't it as wi=
cked and abominable to=20

steal a cheque signed, as it would be to steal one unsigned? If it isn't fo=
rgery, it's robbery, felony,=20

isn't it?"  "Yes, yes, my good Mr. Crapp; but I must speak plainer, I see. =
I want to find out who is to=20

be at the loss of the money--the 50_l._ odd."  "Why, I suppose I must be--o=
f course, mustn't I?"  "I=20

don't know. Let us see how the facts and the law stand. I hope I can show t=
hat not my client, but=20

the bank, must bear the loss of the cash."  "Oh, I see your drift; but how =
is that to be made out?"=20

"Why, suppose you left your drawer regions is to be found in Peru, with its=
 cloudless skies and=20

eternal sun, where a rainfall or a thunder storm would be as great a curios=
ity as a palm tree at the=20

north pole. The mere fact of elevation renders the thunder storm more viole=
nt in mountainous=20

regions, in both temperate and tropical worlds.  Knowing the character of t=
his mysterious power,=20

we may not enter upon a lengthy discussion of the changes, chemical, physic=
al and otherwise,=20

that may be produced by it. Within the scope of this work, only its rank as=
 an agent of destruction=20

and a historical factor may be considered. Is electricity to be greatly fea=
red? to be put on a par=20

with the flood, the hurricane, and the earthquake? Has it ever figured in t=
he history of nations=20

sufficiently to directly affect their destinies?  The first and most famili=
ar aspect of its power is the=20

thunder storm, which needs not a word of description. It results merely fro=
m the discharges=20

passing between two bodies oppositely charged. There is one comparatively r=
are form of lightning,=20
