 I am as sure as she is that I don't know the meaning of the word," added t=

you thought I was drunk--possibly too far gone to serve your purpose. I was=

you'd phone your freight agent to see that it is properly taken care of, an=
d that the freight bill is=20

sent to me."  Gantry made no reply, but he went obediently to the house tel=
ephone and gave the=20

necessary instructions. The thing done, he turned shortly upon Blount, scow=
ling morosely.  "Come=20

on in and let's have a drink," he said.  Blount marked the brittleness of t=
one and the half-

quarrelsome light in the eyes which were a little bloodshot.  "No, Dick; yo=
u've had one too many=20

already," he objected firmly.  Gantry put his back against the wall of the =
corridor.  "No," he rasped;=20

"I'm not drunk, but I'm ready to fight you to a finish, and for once in a w=
ay I'm going to get in the=20

first lick. You've been bluffing me from the start, and you're going to try=
 it again. It won't go this=20

time; you've got to show me!"  If Blount hesitated it was only because he w=
as trying to determine=20

whether or not the traffic manager was business-fit. Gantry comprehended pe=
rfectly, and his laugh=20

was derisive and a trifle bitter.  "You're sizing me up and asking yourself=
 if I'm too far gone to be=20

worth while," he jeered. "If I couldn't a desert, part of a zone reaching o=
ver all of Africa and Asia.=20

El-Hasa, along the Persian Gulf in the east, for such a country, is level a=
nd fertile, and is really a=20

Turkish province, like those on the west coast. A short rainy season occurs=
 on the west coast,=20

which only fills up the low places; and there is hardly a river, if there i=
s anything entitled to the=20

name, which is strong enough to go alone to the sea from any distance inlan=
d. Fine fruits are=20

raised, especially in Yemen, as well as coffee, grain, tobacco, cotton, spi=
ces, aloes, frankincense,=20

and myrrh.  "Sheep, goats, oxen, camels, and horses are raised for domestic=
 use. Gazelles and=20

ostriches live in some of the oases, where also the lion, panther, hyena, a=
nd jackal seek their prey.=20

The magnificent Arabian horse has been raised here for a thousand years. Th=
e camel is one of=20

the most useful animals of this country; and some suppose he is an original=
 native, for his likeness=20

is not found among Egyptian drawings and sculptures. There are plenty of fi=
sh and turtle along the=20

coast.  "The original Arab is found here, and there is something about him =
to=20


_
can, I would have been down and out years ago. Show your hand, Evan--if you=
 have any to=20

show."  Blount hesitated no longer. Taking Gantry's arm, he led him out of =
the club and around the=20

block to the Sierra National Bank. It was after banking hours, but the side=
 door giving access to=20

the safe-deposit department was still open. With the traffic manager at his=
 elbow, Blount asked the=20

custodian for his private box, got it, and led the way to one of the cell-l=
ike retiring rooms. Gantry=20

proved his capacity for transacting business by turning on the is sharp and=
 quick-witted by nature.=20

He has some leading virtues, such as hospitality and good faith; he is cour=
ageous and temperate,=20

perhaps because wine and spirits are forbidden in the Koran. But he is a so=
rt of a natural robber,=20

and seeks a terrible revenge for serious injuries. His wife, and there are =
often several of her, does=20

the work, keeps house, and educates the children. Some Arabs are settled in=
 towns or oases, and=20

others lead a wandering life.  "'Blessed is the country that has no history=
,' for it is usually the=20

record of wars.=20


_
squaring himself in a chair at one side of the tiny writing-table.  Blount =
opened the japanned safety=20

box, took out a bulky envelope and tossed it across to the traffic manager.=
  "You can see for=20

yourself whether I've been bluffing or not," he said quietly; and then he t=
urned his back and=20

interested himself in the lithograph of the latest Atlantic liner framed an=
d hanging upon the=20

mahogany end wall of the small room.  For a little time there was a dead si=
lence, broken only by=20

the faint rustling of the papers as Gantry withdrew and unfolded them. When=
 he had glanced at=20

the last folded letter sheet, he snapped the rubber band upon the sheaf and=
 sat back in his chair.=20

Blount turned at the snap and but it has been concerned in the wars of Turk=
ey and Egypt. What=20

there is relates to the birth and life of Mohammed, and his wars to promote=
 the increase of his=20

followers; and I shall tell you the story of the Prophet at another time." =
 The professor retired after=20

the usual applause. Some walked the deck, watching whatever was to be seen,=
 especially the=20

Arabian dhows, and occasionally a large steamer passed; and some went to sl=
eep in their=20

staterooms. The course of the Guardian-Mother had been varied as much as th=
e soundings would=20

permit as she approached the Jubal Strait, which is the entrance to the Gul=
f of Suez, in order to=20

give the passengers a view of some interesting scenery.  "There is the=20


_
the traffic manager smiling curiously up at him.  "Sit down, Evan," was the=
 friendly invitation. And=20

when Blount had dropped into the opposite chair: "We used to be pretty good=
 friends in the old=20

days, Ebee," Gantry went on, falling easily into the use of the college nic=
kname. "I haven't=20

forgotten the time when I would have had to break and of hills, called moun=
tains by courtesy, of a=20

reddish hue. "Those hills are 1,530 feet high, and this locality is famous =
in story. The material of=20

the elevations is haematite, which Dr. Hawkes can explain better than I can=
."  "It is a native=20

sesquioxide of a reddish color, with a blood-like streak," added the surgeo=
n, laughing.  "Do you=20
