for the Little River pulpit. What is more, he is not a real minister of the=

 room, then she tossed the paper up to the ceiling, and finally caught Dais=

do you mean by _
only thing to do," said Noel. "I propose to talk to Miss Egerton about them=
. I will ask her to go into=20

figures with me, and to state what sum she thinks ought to be expended on t=
heir education. She=20

probably knows something about what talents they have by this time. After s=
he and I have talked=20

our plans over together we will ask you whether you are inclined to advance=
 the necessary money.=20

If you say 'Yes,' Miss Egerton will speak to the girls, and tell them quite=
 openly what you are doing,=20

and appeal to their common sense not to reject their only real chance of ob=
taining an=20

independence bye-and-bye. They can, if they think right, arrange to pay you=
 back within a certain=20

term of years. I believe you will do best for them by making such an arrang=
ement."  Mrs.=20

Ellsworthy both frowned and smiled, but finally agreed to allow Arthur Noel=
 to have his own way.=20

That very afternoon the energetic young man went to see Miss Egerton. for y=
ou to recognize,=20

Josiah, that I have you about where I want you. I can make or ruin you in f=
ive minutes, and it all=20

depends on how you reply now. Think hard before you answer."  "That's right=
, Jim, you've got me=20

with a purty tight hip-hold," admitted the Captain. "But I'm waiting just n=
ow for them orders to see if=20

I'm going to sign up."  "You'll sign up, I'm not afraid of that. That is, i=
f you really wish to keep your=20

place. The promise that you are to make to me is concerning the man staying=
 in your house."=20

Captain Pott stiffened, and threw up his guard. He carefully concealed his =
rising anger, however.=20

He must be more certain of his ground before he made any leap that might pr=
ove dangerous.=20

"What in tarnation has he got to do with this affair?"  "He has everything =
to do with it, so far as you=20

are concerned at this particular moment. We must get that man out of this t=
own. You must believe=20

me when I tell you that=20


_
They discussed the subject in an its bearings, and Miss Egerton arranged to=
 speak to Primrose at=20

the first opportunity.     CHAPTER XXXV.  THEIR QUARTER'S ALLOWANCE.   "Two=
 letters," said=20

Daisy, holding them up in her hand; "actually two letters; one for Primrose=
--oh, yes! of course that=20

must be from Mr. Danesfield; and one for Jasmine--oh! Jasmine's is such a f=
unny-looking letter,=20

quite thick and interesting, and with a darling little picture on the back.=
 What can the picture as=20

mine. If he is permitted to stay here----"  "Heave to, there, Jim!" explode=
d the seaman. He leaned=20

across the table and glared at the man on the other side.  "There, now, sit=
 down and compose=20

yourself," soothed the Elder. "I was prepared for you to take it this way a=
t first. I don't mean=20

anything against the man, so far as his personal character is concerned, bu=
t his presence here is=20

a decided menace both to you and me. If I dared to tell you the whole truth=
, you, too,=20


_
Joy-bell_ written over them."  "Give it to me," said Jasmine, her face sudd=
enly turning crimson.=20

"Oh, Daisy! why do you examine my letters so curiously? This was meant to b=
e quite private. Oh,=20

oh, oh! how my fingers tremble."  "We are all alone, you know, Jasmine," sa=
id Daisy; "dear=20

Primrose is not in. She went to her continual reading nearly an hour ago. D=
ear Primrose! she=20

sometimes looks quite pale and tired. Perhaps the letter is about our secre=
t, Jasmine; please do=20

read it to me--please do."  But by this time Jasmine had torn the envelope =
open, and was oblivious=20

to all Daisy's comments. Her eager eyes devoured the contents of an officia=
l-looking sheet of=20

paper, then she danced best that he go for his own good, too. Some physical=
 violence will=20

certainly be done him if he remains. You must see with me that it is best o=
n that one point that we=20

remove him quietly from the town. Sim Hicks has sworn to do him harm. Now, =
you are the logical=20

man to go to Mr. McGowan, and show him the sense of his leaving Little Rive=
r. You seem to be=20

the only one who can influence him in any degree."  "By the Almighty, Jim F=
ox! If it wa'n't for your=20

darter, I'd swipe up this floor with your dirty carcass!"  "It will be best=
 if you take this calmly, Josiah,=20

and stop your foolish raving. Just listen to reason for once in your life. =
There is a past in that man's=20

life known to a very=20
