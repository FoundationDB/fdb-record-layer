philodendron monstera you do, you may give him my compliments, and tell him=
 I preferred to run my own special train."  The conductor grinned and made =
no reply, and he was still grinning when he sauntered into the railroad tel=
egraph office and spoke to the operator.  "I extensive of the Union, and al=
most twenty-six times as large as the State of New York. They do not take a=
 census here; and estimates from the best information that could be obtaine=
d make the population five millions, which is less than that of the philode=
ndron monstera you do, you may give him my compliments, and tell him I pref=
erred to run my own special train."  The conductor grinned and made no repl=
y, and he was still grinning when he sauntered into the railroad telegraph =
office and spoke to the operator.  "I extensive of the Union, and almost tw=
enty-six times as large as the State of New York. They do not take a census=
 here; and estimates from the best information that could be obtained make =
the population five millions, which is less than that of the _
once more at a desert siding where there was no telegraph office. The car w=
as still standing on the=20

siding when Blount went to bed. But in the morning it was in motion again, =
jogging now on its=20

leisurely way up the branch line.  At Lewiston, the town at the end of the =
branch where the right-of-

way trouble had originated, Blount found more delay, carefully planned for,=
 as he had now come=20

firmly to believe. The plaintiffs in the right-of-way case were out of town=
, and their lawyers had=20

gone to the capital. Blount saw that he might wait a week without accomplis=
hing anything, hence=20

he immediately instructed his conductor to get orders for the return.  Afte=
r having been gone a=20

"Don't make yourself ridiculous, Sarah," interposed Mrs. Belgrave in a whis=
per.  "How can a body=20

look on Mount Sinai without being stirred up?" demanded the good woman.  Bu=
t whether it was=20

Jebel Serbal or Jebel Musa, Mount Sinai was there; and doubtless most of th=
e company were as=20

much impressed by the fact as the excellent lady from Von Blonk Park, thoug=
h they were less=20

demonstrative about it. Mrs. Belgrave was silent for a time; and then she s=
truck up one of Watts's=20

familiar hymns, in which the others joined her:--      "Not to the terrors =
of the Lord,       The=20

tempest, fire, and smoke,     Not to the thunder of that word       Which G=
od on Sinai spoke;     But=20

we are come to=20


_
the service-car to say that the single telegraph-wire connecting Lewiston w=
ith the outer world was=20

down, and that the orders for the return journey could not be obtained unti=
l the telegraph=20

connection was restored. At that point Blount took matters into his own han=
ds.  There was a=20

mining company having its headquarters in the isolated town, and Blount had=
 met the manager=20

once in the capital--met him in a social way, and had been able to show him=
 some little attention.=20

Hiring a buckboard at the one livery stable in the place, he drove out to t=
he "Little Mary," and found=20

Blatchford, the friendly manager, smoking a black clay cutty pipe in his sh=
ack office. It did not take=20

Blount over a minute to renew the pleasant acquaintance, and to state his d=
ilemma.  "I'm hung up=20

here with my special train, the wires are down and I can't get out," was hi=
s statement of the crude=20

fact. "Didn't you tell me that you owned a motor-car?"  "I did," was the pr=
ompt reply. "Want to=20

borrow it?"  "You beat me to it," said Blount, laughing. "That was precisel=
y what I was going to beg=20

for--the loan of your car. I believe you told me that you had driven it fro=
m here to the capital."  "Oh,=20

yes; several times, and the road is fairly good by way of Arequipa and Lost=
 River Canyon. It's only=20

about half as far across country as it is around by the railroad. You ought=
 to make it in six hours=20

and a half, or seven at the longest. Drive me down to the burg, and I'll pu=
t you in possession."=20

Blount began to be audibly thankful, but the mine manager good-naturedly cu=
t him short.  "It's all=20

in the day's work, Mr. Blount, and I'm glad to be of service--not because y=
ou are the=20

Transcontinental's lawyer, nor altogether because       The city of our God=
,     Where milder words=20

declare his will,       And spread his love abroad."  As the gong sounded f=
or lunch the ship was off=20

Tur, but too far off to see the place, if there was anything there to see; =
and the commander=20

mentioned it only as the port to which they would have sailed if they had g=
one to Mount Sinai. The=20

"Big Four" were more interested in the Arabian craft they saw near the shor=
e, for they always keep=20

close to the land. Their captains are familiar with all the intricate reefs=
 where large vessels never=20

go. They are very cautious sailors, and on the least sign of foul weather t=
hey run into one of the=20

creeks which indent the coast. They never sail at night; and if they have t=
o cross the sea, they wait=20

for settled weather.  At the hour appointed for the afternoon conference th=
e passengers were all in=20

their places; and however the report of his lectures may read, the listener=
s were deeply interested,=20

partly because they were inspired by a desire for knowledge, and partly on =
account of their=20

proximity to the countries described. A map of the peninsula of Arabia had =
been unrolled on the=20

frame, with enough of its surroundings to enable the audience to fix its lo=
cation definitely in their=20

minds. The professor came up smiling and pleasant as he always was, and the=
 boys saluted him=20

with a round of applause.  "My subject this time is Arabia, which the nativ=
es call Jezirat-al-Arab,=20

and the Turks and Persians Arabistan. It is a peninsula, the isthmus of whi=
ch reaches across from=20

the south-eastern corner of the Mediterranean to the head of the Persian Gu=
lf," the professor=20

began, indicating on the map the localities mentioned with the pointer. "As=
ia abounds in=20


_
forgotten your kindness to me when I was in town three weeks ago. Let's go =
and get out the chug-

wagon."  A little later Blount found himself handling the wheel of a very s=
erviceable knockabout car=20

equipped for hard work on country roads. When he was ready to go, he drove =
down to the railroad=20

yard and hunted up his conductor.  "After you have had your vacation, you m=
ay get orders from=20

Mr. Kittredge and take his car back to peninsulas, and Arabia is the great =
south-western one.=20

From north-west to south-east it extends 1800 miles, and is about 600 wide.=
 It has an area of=20

1,230,000 square miles, which is a very indefinite statement to the mind, t=
hough given in figures,=20

and I will adopt the commander's method of giving a better idea by comparis=
on with some of the=20

States of your own country.  "It is nearly five times as large as the State=
 of=20
