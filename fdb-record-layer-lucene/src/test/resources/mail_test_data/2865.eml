 Half an hour=20

afterwards the same information had been disseminated throughout the camp. =

Townsend had also arrived to award the citations and the Distinguished Serv=

officers and soldiers who had merited the distinction.  Never were Sonya Cl=

movement of the victorious army toward the Rhine.  The clouds of the earlie=

heavier and more snow was falling in larger flakes, so that the earth was c=
overed with a thin white=20

carpet.  A cold wind was blowing across the winter fields.  The American so=

nurses managed to=20

protect themselves a little from the cold by standing behind a group of off=

 the hands of the=20

Commanding Officer.  First Lieutenant Leon De Funiak was a young French off=

 action near St. Mihiel=20

on September 12 when with excellent courage he had captured Roosevelt=E2=80=

which he reviewed the whole controversy, was made public. He declared that =
the court had done=20

substantial justice to Schley. As regards the question of command at Santia=
go, he said that=20

technically Sampson commanded the fleet, and Schley the western division, b=

evealed many serious defects in the American=20

military system, some of which have been remedied by the reorganization of =
the army and the=20

creation of a general staff.[292] It demonstrated the necessity of military=
 evolutions on a large=20

scale in time of peace, so as to give the general officers experience in ha=

ing large bodies=20

of troops; it showed the folly and danger of appointing men from civil life=

to positions of responsibility in any branch of the military or naval servi=

field-artillery, of smokeless powder, and of high-power rifles of the lates=

necessity of having on hand a large supply of the best war material ready f=
or use. While every=20

American is proud of the magnificent record of the navy, it must not be ima=

who stood between her guardian and Nona Davis, shivered.  Unconscious of wh=
