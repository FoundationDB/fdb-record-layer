f evidence that such=20

information was necessary to enable him to act.[418] Where a physician was =
asked whether he=20

treated a person for typhoid fever, and he answered that she was not so dis=
eased, it was held that=20

this information was not necessary to enable him to act.[419] And the same =
was held to be true=20

where a physician examined a prisoner at the jail and testified that he was=
 diseased, the prisoner=20

having been notified at the time of the examination that it was made by dir=
ection of the prosecuting=20

attorney and there being no intention to prescribe or act for the prisoner.=
[420] But it has been=20

stated that all disclosures by a patient to a physician respecting ailments=
 are privileged whether=20

necessary to enable the physician to prescribe or not.[421]  In Minnesota, =
a physician was allowed=20

to disclose statements as to suffering made by his patient, but not for the=
 purpose of enabling him=20



to prescribe or act.[422]  In Missouri, it has been said that information a=
s to the way in which an=20

injury was inflicted is of the greatest necessity for successful treatment;=
 and that it is information=20

which physicians universally demand and receive.[423] In another case, with=
 reference to the=20

cause of a patient=E2=80=99s condition, it was said that while knowledge of=
 the cause may not be=20

necessary, the disclosure of the cause cannot be made without a disclosure =
of the condition, and=20

that as a medical person cannot tell indirectly what he is forbidden to tel=
l directly, the physician=E2=80=99s=20

evidence of the cause is inadmissible.[424] In another case it was said tha=
t any information,=20

necessarily coming to a physician in order to treat his patient, is to be r=
egarded as necessary=20

information though unimportant, and that the test is how it was acquired, n=
ot whether it could have=20

been acquired in a different way, and therefore it was incompetent for a ph=
ysician to testify that his=20

patient was drunk when he treated him.[425]  In New York, in an early case,=
[426] where a man=20

consulted a physician with reference to committing an abortion and told him=
 that a certain woman=20

was pregnant by him, this admission was said not to be essential to enable =
him to prescribe, even=20

if the relation of physician and patient were considered established; but t=
his seems to be at=20

variance with the later case of _People v. Brower_,[427] where the accused =
consulted a physician=20

with reference to the treatment of a woman on whom he had attempted to comm=
it an abortion, and=20

admitted that he had done so, and the physician was not permitted to disclo=
se it. A broader view is=20

now taken of the word _necessary_. It has been held by the Court of Appeals=
 that a physician=20

could not testify that his patient had a venereal disease while under his c=
are as a physician, the=20

presumption being that he learned it for the purpose of prescribing;[428] a=
nd again, that it is=20

assumed from the relationship that the information would not have been impa=
rted except for the=20

purpose of aiding the physician to prescribe.[429] But this presumption doe=
s not attach to=20

information regarding a patient, communicated by a third person.[430]  Wher=
e a person went to a=20

physician to call for medicine, and it appeared that he was not consulting =
for himself and was not=20

representing any one else who needed or desired medical assistance, the phy=
sician was allowed=20

to testify as to=20

demark. It may only be=20

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agre=
e to be bound by the=20

terms of this at that time.[431]  In the case of _Edington v. =C3=86tna Lif=
e Insurance Company_,[432] it=20

was said that before the exclusion, the facts on which it is justified must=
 appear in some way, and=20

the Court must know somewhat of the circumstances; from the opinion it is e=
asy to infer that it is=20

only confidential communications and information as to secret ailments whic=
h may be regarded as=20

necessary within the statute; but this view was overruled in _Grattan v. Me=
tropolitan Life Insurance=20

Company_,[433] and there it was distinctly stated that it is enough that th=
e witness acquired the=20

information in his character as physician and in the due and proper exercis=
e of his calling, and that=20

it is not incumbent on the person objecting, to show by formal proof that t=
he information was=20



necessary to enable the witness to prescribe. In this case the examination =
of the witness was as to=20

the cause of his patient=E2=80=99s death, and the argument urged upon the a=
ttention of the Court was that=20

information regarding the cause of death could not be necessary to enable t=
he physician to=20

prescribe, as the utility of the prescription ceased with the death and bef=
ore the cause was=20

determined; but the Court held that the privilege attached, because, althou=
gh the death was the=20

result of the cause, the facts constituting the cause were learned while th=
e physician was=20

attending the living patient in a professional capacity and from the sympto=
ms manifested at that=20

time.  In consonance with the decision in _Grattan v. Metropolitan Life Ins=
urance Company_,[434]=20

it has been held that a physician who amputated a patient=E2=80=99s leg cou=
ld not testify as to its condition=20

at the time it was amputated.[435]  The fact that the physician does not pr=
escribe does not defeat=20

the privilege; if the information is acquired in the course of professional=
 employment the statute=20

operates, for the decision that neither advice nor medicine is needed is a =
professional act within=20

the spirit of the law.[436] _Medicus optimus, medicamentum minimum_, is the=
 maxim used in=20

another case to illustrate this point.[437]  But it cannot be predicated as=
 matter of law that a=20

physician cannot exclude from his consideration facts learned or opinions f=
ormed while attending=20

as physician; therefore he can testify as to his opinion on hypothetical fa=
cts which might be=20

deemed to relate to another person as well as the patient; and where the ph=
ysician testified that=20

he could so form an opinion, his opinion of such assumptions was held to be=
 admissible in=20

evidence as expert testimony.[438]  But it is not all information which wil=
l be presumed to have=20

been necessary to enable the physician to act; it seems that where the know=
ledge is such that it is=20

evidently immaterial to the physician=E2=80=99s decision, it will be admitt=
ed. Such a case is that of _Hoyt v.=20

Hoyt_,[439] where the testimony of physicians was admitted to show the atti=
tude of their patient=20

toward his daughter and their advice to him concerning her, the evidence be=
ing for the purpose of=20

showing the testator=E2=80=99s opinion and not the physicians=E2=80=99. It =
has also been held that a statement=20

made by a patient on the physician=E2=80=99s last visit as to what occurred=
 at=20
