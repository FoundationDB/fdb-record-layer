lf of his note, I cannot=20

say; but I had caused the print to be divided in such a way (to guard again=
st accidents) that he=20

would see the words "Bank of E," and no more of the title of the establishm=
ent from which it=20

purported to have been issued, and he was too illiterate or inexperienced i=
n bank-notes to=20

discover that the paper itself was not of the kind made for the Old Lady of=
 Threadneedle Street.=20

The patriotic barber was thunderstruck. He was speechless for a moment or t=
wo with=20

disappointment and mortification. When he had partly recovered himself, he =
stamped once, and=20

swore in about two sentences that we were plunderers, and that he would hav=
e us prosecuted for=20

circulating bad money. Our attorney thought this a good joke. It was one of=
 a sort that he could=20

appreciate; so drawing upon his imagination for his law, by way of retort M=
r. Yellowly informed Mr.=20

Shufflebotham that he had been treated as he deserved, that he had "better =
keep a quiet tongue=20

in his head," that, at all events, he must behave himself in that room, or =
he would be kicked out by=20

one of our roughs in close attendance, and that he might also get transport=
ed for bribery.  The=20

barber gnashed his teeth, and went away not rejoicing. I believe he has vot=
ed twice for the Tories=20

since that day, without fee or reward--unless vengeance upon his Liberal be=
trayers was his motive=20

and his compensation.     A ROMANCE OF SOCIAL LIFE.   About four years ago =
there lived, in=20

the neighbourhood of Kentish Town, a the fresh-water fish in ponds far in t=
he interior. As for the=20

tremendous roar of the wind, the commanding officer of the thirty-sixth reg=
iment sought protection=20

by getting under the arch of a lower window outside his house. He did not h=
ear the roof and upper=20

story of the house fall, and only found it out by the dust caused by the fa=
ll.  Far more destructive=20

was the great hurricane of 1780.  [Illustration: HURRICANE IN THE TROPICS.]=
  The French and=20

English were at war. Admiral George Rodney was in the West Indies with an E=
nglish fleet in=20

several divisions. The French had sent a convoy of five thousand troops to =
Martinique. The storm=20

was of immense width, extending from Trinidad, on the extreme southwest, to=
 Antigua. The=20

evening of October 9th was red and lowering. By ten o=E2=80=99clock next mo=
rning, the wind was high, and=20

by one o=E2=80=99clock, vessels in the harbors were dragging their anchors.=
 The water was driven on shore=20

with such force at Barbadoes, that it was four feet deep in the Government =
House. The family took=20

refuge under the cannon, only to find that they were moved about by the win=
d. By morning not a=20

building in town was standing; every tree was either blown away, or strippe=
d of branches and=20

leaves.  The sunny islands were suddenly become as bleak and bare as a Sibe=
rian steppe.  As to=20

the loss, ten thousand perished at Martinique; six thousand at Santa Lucia;=
 four thousand five=20

hundred at St. Eustatia; three thousand five hundred at Barbadoes. Scores o=
f smaller islands were=20

devastated, but the loss in detail is not known. Of the British fleet,=20


_
Mr. Green was a merchant, carrying on business in the City in co-partnershi=
p with a German=20

gentleman; and in the enjoyment of a good income from "a house" at the head=
 of which it was his=20

pride to stand.  The couple had not been long united in the holy bonds of m=
atrimony. When he=20

married, he considered himself fortunate in obtaining for his partner a pre=
tty little brunette of a=20

woman, somewhere about thirty years of age, and of no mean accomplishments.=
 With this lady for=20

his wife, Mr. Green lived for a period of three years in an easy and comfor=
table, not to say happy=20

or blissful, state. The couple had no children; but with that exception the=
y had all the ingredients=20

which should contribute to the material and social happiness of human being=
s.  The disparity in=20

age between Mr. and Mrs. Green was perhaps a circumstance that contributed =
to limit the sources=20

of affection; but, as every body said, they jogged along very cheerily, and=
 the serenity and=20

calmness of their lives made them the objects of a good deal of envy.  Mrs.=
 Green had been the=20

daughter of a confidential clerk to her husband. She had lost her mother ea=
rly in life, and her=20

father died when she was but eighteen years of age. His salary in the house=
 of Messrs. Green and=20

Schnackwether had been, for a long period prior to his death, very liberal,=
 and he might, with=20

reasonable economy, have saved a few hundreds of pounds part was destroyed;=
 only one vessel=20

out of nineteen at St. Eustatia survived. A score of other ships of war and=
 numerous transports=20

were sunk. Of the French convoy, with five thousand troops, the governor wr=
ote laconically that it=20

=E2=80=9Chad disappeared.=E2=80=9D Several English vessels at Barbadoes wer=
e carried far in shore and converted=20

into dwellings. Doubtless, fifty thousand would hardly be too great an esti=
mate of the total loss of=20

life in this storm. In a similar one in 1813, the hurricane drove back the =
Gulf Stream, piling up the=20

water thirty feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship _Ledbury Snow_, ende=
avored to ride out the=20

storm, and when it was over, found herself high and dry. She had let go her=
 anchor among the=20

tree-tops of Elliot=E2=80=99s Key. The Barbadoes region suffered another se=
vere gale in 1782, when the=20

prizes captured by Admiral Rodney were sunk, a number of merchant vessels a=
nd two English=20

war-ships foundered, and three thousand lives were lost at sea alone.  The =
temperate zone has its=20

occasional hurricanes, though they are by no means as powerful or as freque=
nt as those of the=20

tropics. It is stated that in the year 944, one thousand five hundred house=
s were destroyed by a=20

tempest in London. In the year 1090, it is recorded that a violent storm ov=
erturned six hundred and=20

six houses in London alone.  Terrible as is the destruction of the cyclone =
in the western world, its=20

_
certainly, to have left some provision behind him in the shape of a life as=
surance, but he did not.=20

He lived entirely up to, or somewhat beyond, his means. Miss Thomson, his d=
aughter, was=20

consequently obliged to earn her subsequent livelihood, which she did as a =
daily governess. Her=20

experience in this vocation was not, I dare say, much unlike the experience=
 of other young women=20

in that position, of which the reader will have a tolerably accurate notion=
, and therefore I will=20

abstain from describing it. It may be enough to say, that it was a cheerles=
s, hard, and mortifying=20

experience. She confessed that rebuffs and petty insults shut up, and the w=
earing influence of=20

consecutive labour dried up, the wells of female emotion, gave a certain pi=
quancy or sharpness to=20

her thoughts, rendered her, indeed, distrustful of the world, and cynical, =
if not calculating and=20

selfish.  During her girlhood, while her father lived, and after his death,=
 but before her marriage,=20

Mrs. Green had received many kindnesses from her late parent's master. He w=
as attached to his=20

clerk Thomson by that sort of attachment, and to that extent, which long an=
d faithful service begets=20

in the mind of an employer.  To do the father of Mrs. Green simple justice,=
 it must be Oriental=20

regions. All through the Malay archipelago, along the coasts of China, Japa=
n, the Phillipines,=20

Hindostan, and Farther India, the ravages of the Storm King have been appal=
ling, far exceeding=20

even the terrible hurricanes of the West Indies.  Hindostan affords peculia=
r facilities for=20

destructiveness of cyclones. Both its great rivers flow, for the latter par=
t of their course, through=20

low alluvial plains, and their deltas extend into the ocean directly toward=
 the region of monsoons;=20

so that a hurricane may send a great tidal wave up the river: while the low=
 rich plains for miles=20

around are but few feet above tide-water, and teem with a population attrac=
ted by the amazing=20

fertility. So a sudden great storm may totally submerge, without any warnin=
g, hundreds of square=20

miles of these fertile tracts, with all their inhabitants. Even when the se=
a-wave is not added to the=20

horrors of the storm, the losses are fearful. A cyclone at Calcutta in 1867=
, destroyed thirty=20

thousand houses, wrecked or sunk six hundred ships and smaller vessels in t=
he river, and killed=20

ten thousand persons in the city alone. When to this is added the havoc com=
mitted by the storm--

one hundred miles wide--in the rural districts, as it traveled on toward th=

had never robbed; peculated, or been in the slightest degree unfaithful to =
the house he served, or=20

its members.  Just before he died, the clerk received a promise from his ma=
ster, Mr. Green, that=20

little Helen should want for nothing as long as she lived, which promise wa=
s kept during her=20

subsequent spinstership by inquiries, every quarter, with methodical exactn=
ess, how she thankful=20

that such terrible visitants are altogether unknown in our land.  Terrible =
as this storm was, there=20

was a greater one on the 5th of October, 1864. About one hundred ships were=
 lost; and over sixty=20

thousand persons perished; forty-three thousand in Calcutta alone. It was a=
ccompanied by a=20
