ation; those who saw=20

him were suddenly filled with reverence; those who came near him loved him;=

him would say, "I have never seen his like either before or after." He was =
of great taciturnity; but=20

when he spoke it was with emphasis and deliberation, and no one could ever =
forget what he said.=20

He was, however, very nervous and restless withal, often low-spirited, down=
cast as to heart and=20

eyes. Yet he would at times suddenly break through these broodings, become =
gay, talkative,=20

jocular, chiefly among his own. He would then delight in telling little sto=
ries, fairy tales, and the like.=20

He would romp with the children and play with their toys.'  'He lived with =
his wives in a row of=20

humble cottages, separated from one another by palm-branches, cemented toge=
ther with mud. He=20

would kindle the fire, sweep the floor, and milk the goats himself. 'Aisheh=
 tells us that he slept=20

upon a leathern mat, and that he mended his clothes, and even clouted his s=
hoes, with his own=20

hand. For months together ... he did not get a sufficient meal. The little =
food that he had was=20

always shared with those who dropped in to partake of it. Indeed, outside t=
he Prophet's house was=20

a bench or gallery, on which were always to be found a number of the poor, =
who lived entirely on=20

his generosity, and were hence called the "people of the bench." His ordina=
ry food was dates and=20

water or barley-bread; milk and honey were luxuries of which he was fond, b=
ut which he rarely=20

allowed himself. The fare of the desert seemed most congenial to him, even =
when he was=20

sovereign of Arabia.' [13]  Mohammad was full forty before he felt himself =
called to be an apostle=20

INTRODUCTION TO THE TWILIGHT ANIMAL STORIES                               B=
Y THE AUTHOR=20

All little boys and girls who love animals should become acquainted with Bu=
mper the white rabbit,=20

with Bobby Gray Squirrel, with Buster the bear, and with White Tail the dee=
r, for they are all a jolly=20



lot, brave and fearless in danger, and so lovable that you won=E2=80=99t la=
y down any one of the books=20

without saying wistfully, =E2=80=9CI almost wish I had them really and trul=
y as friends and not just storybook=20

acquaintances.=E2=80=9D That, of course,=20


_
some 'religion of Abraham;' he had listened to the stories of the Haggadah:=
 he knew a very little=20

about Jesus of Nazareth. He seems to have suffered long under the burden of=
 doubt and self-

distrust. He used to wander about the hills alone, brooding over these thin=
gs; he shunned the=20

society of men, and 'solitude became a passion to him.'  At length came the=
 crisis. He was=20

spending the sacred months on Mount Hira, 'a huge barren rock, torn by clef=
t and hollow ravine,=20

standing out solitary in the full white glare of the desert sun, shadowless=
, flowerless, without well=20

or rill.' Here in a cave Mohammad gave himself up to prayer and fasting. Lo=
ng months or even=20

years of doubt had increased his nervous excitable disposition. He had had,=
 they say, cataleptic=20

fits during his childhood, and was evidently more delicately and finely con=
stituted than those=20

around him. Given this nervous nature, and the grim solitude of the hill wh=
ere he had almost lived=20

for long weary months, blindly feeling after some truth upon which to rest =
his soul, it is not difficult=20

to believe the tradition of the cave, that Mohammad heard a voice say, 'Cry=
!' 'What shall I cry?' he=20

answers--the question that has been burning his heart during all his mental=
 struggles--     Cry[14]!=20

in the name of thy Lord, who hath created;    He hath created man from a cl=
ot of blood.    Cry! and=20

thy Lord is the Most Bountiful,    Who hath taught [writing] by the pen:   =
 He hath taught man that=20

which he knew not.  Mohammad arose trembling, and went to Khadeejeh, and to=
ld her what he=20

had seen; and she did her woman's part, and believed in him and soothed his=
 terror, and bade him=20

hope for the future. Yet he could not believe in himself. Was he not perhap=
s mad, possessed by a=20

devil? Were these voices of a truth from God? And so he went again on his s=
olitary wanderings,=20

hearing strange sounds, and thinking them at one time the testimony of Heav=
en, at another the=20

temptings of Satan or the ravings of madness. Doubting, wondering, hoping, =
he had fain put an=20

end to a life which had become intolerable in its changings from the heaven=
 of hope to the hell of=20

despair, when again he heard the voice, 'Thou art the messenger of God, and=
 I am Gabriel.'=20

Conviction at length seized hold upon him; he was indeed to bring a message=
 of good tidings to=20

the Arabs, the message of God through His angel Gabriel. He went back to Kh=
adeejeh exhausted=20

in mind and body. 'Wrap me, wrap me,' he said; and the word came unto him--=
     O thou=20

enwrapped in thy mantle    Arise and warn!    And thy Lord,--magnify Him!  =
  And thy raiment,--

purify it!    And the abomination,--flee it!    And bestow not favours that=
 thou mayest receive again=20

with increase,    And for thy Lord wait thou patiently.  is a splendid wish=
; but none of us could=20

afford to have a big menagerie of wild animals, and that=E2=80=99s just wha=
t you would have to do if you=20

went outside of the books. Bumper had many friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbi=
t, Fuzzy Wuzz and=20

Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and Bobby Gray Squirrel had his near cous=
ins, Stripe the=20

chipmunk and Webb the flying squirrel; while Buster and White Tail were fav=
ored with an endless=20

number of friends and relatives. If we turned them all loose from the books=
, and put them in a ten-

acre lot=E2=80=94but no, ten acres wouldn=E2=80=99t be big enough to accomm=
odate them, perhaps not a hundred=20

acres.  So we will leave them just where they are=E2=80=94in the books=E2=
=80=94and read about them, and let our=20

imaginations take us to them where we can see them playing, skipping, singi=
ng, and sometimes=20

fighting, and if we read very carefully, and _think_ as we go along, we may=
 come to know them=20

even better than if we went out hunting for them.  Another thing we should =
remember. By leaving=20

them in the books, hundreds and thousands of other boys and girls can enjoy=
 them, too, sharing=20

with us the pleasures of the imagination, which after all is one of the gre=
atest things in the world. In=20

gathering them together in a real menagerie, we would be selfish both to Bu=
mper, Bobby, Buster,=20



White Tail and their friends as well as to thousands of other little reader=
s who could not share=20

them with us. So these books of Twilight Animal Stories are dedicated to al=
l little boys and girls=20

who love wild animals. All others are forbidden to read them! They wouldn=
=E2=80=99t understand them if=20

they did.  So come out into the woods with me, and let us listen and watch,=
 and I promise you it=20

will be worth while.                                     CONTENTS          =

Mohammad saw these visions and heard these voices. We are not concerned to =
draw the lines of=20

demarcation between enthusiasm and ecstasy and inspiration. It is sufficien=
t that Mohammad=20

_did_ see these things--the subjective creations of a tormented mind. It is=
 sufficient that he=20

believed them to be a message from on high, and that for years of neglect a=
nd persecution and for=20

years of triumph and conquest he acted upon his belief.  Mohammad now (612)=
 came forward as=20

the Apostle of the One God to the people of Arabia: he was at last well ass=
ured that his God was=20

of a truth _the_ God, and that He had indeed sent him with a message to his=
 people, that they too=20

might turn from their idols and serve the living God. He was in the minorit=
y of one, but he was no=20

longer afraid; he had learnt that self-trust which is the condition of all =
true work. At first he spoke to=20

his near kinsmen and friends; and it is impossible to overrate the importan=
ce of the fact that his=20

 limbs showing taut=20

muscles and great springing power; and his neck grew thick and short, which=
 is well for a buck,=20

who must use it in savage thrusts when the head is a battering ram. His hor=
ns were short and=20

bony, but they protruded in front like knobs against which it would be unpl=
easant to fall.  But his=20

antlers were his pride. They spread out fan-shape on his head, crowning it =
with a glory that made=20

Mother Deer supremely happy. At times it seemed as if the antlers were too =
heavy for the head=20

and neck, but White Tail carried them easily, and when he shook them in spo=
rt or anger any one=20

could see they were just fitted to him.  In time he stood as high as Father=
 Buck, and a head taller=20

than Mother Deer. The day the tip of his antlers reached an inch above Fath=
