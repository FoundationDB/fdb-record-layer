not been in fusion might be supposed to do. Can we admit that so many alternating rocks, 

imbedded one in the other, have a common origin? The nature of the phonolites, which are lithoid 

lavas with a feldspar basis, and the nature of the green slates intermixed with hornblende, oppose 

this opinion. In this state of things we may choose between two solutions of the problem in 

question. In one of these solutions the phonolite of the Cerro de Flores is to be regarded as the 

sole volcanic production of the tract; and we are forced to unite the pyroxenic amygdaloids
