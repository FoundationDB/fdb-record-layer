in the person of the blacksmith. Whether this excellent apostle is among th=

refreshed by quotations, which fly from the tongue of the smith like sparks=
 from his anvil. His=20

companion was very ill, and incapable of moving. I went to see the poor fel=

and deadly poisons, that=20

had been provided for them cheaply, by the agent for their society at Cairo=

the stock in trade of a defunct doctor. This had been given to the missiona=

called up to him:  "Stop tolling, you fool, can't you? Show us which way th=

lies."  The bell-ringer pointed to the right.  "You run on in front, Gyuri,=
 and try and get out of her=20

what is the matter with her."  But Gyuri was already gone, through the prie=
st's garden, across=20

see Veronica in her=20

field, then into Gongoly's meadow, and they were face to face.  The girl dr=

when she saw him, and began to tremble violently.  "Where is the fire?" she=
 asked.  "Don't be=20

you run away?"  The girl turned pale, and bit her lip.  "It is enough if I =
know the reason," she said=20

in a low voice. "Please leave me alone."  And she turned round as though to=
 return to the woods.=20

"Veronica, for heaven's sake don't torture me; what have I done?"  The girl=
 looked at him coldly,=20

her eyes were like two bits of ice.  "Leave me alone," she said, "what do y=

Gyuri fell back a few steps.  "Oh!" he exclaimed, "why did you do it? Why?"=
  "Do not try to deceive=20
