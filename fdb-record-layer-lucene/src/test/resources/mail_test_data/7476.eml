helicopters is 20. Russia lost dozens of them hitherto and does not have th=
e wherewithal to=20

replace them.  The Russian command acknowledges 3000 fatalities and 8000 wo=
unded but the=20

numbers are probably way higher. The Committee of Soldiers' Mothers pegs th=
e number of=20

casualties at 12-13,000. Unpaid, disgruntled, and under-supplied troops exe=
rt pressure on their=20

headquarters to air-strafe Chechnya, to withdraw, or to multiply the money =
budgeted to support=20

the ill-fated operation.  Russia maintains c. 100,000 troops in Chechnya, i=
ncluding 40,000 active=20

soldiers and 60,000 support and logistics personnel. The price tag is sizab=
le though not=20

unsustainable. As early as October 1999, the IMF told Radio Free Europe/Rad=
io Liberty: "Yes,=20

we're concerned that it could undermine the progress in improving (Russia's=
) public finances."  As=20

they did in the first Chechen conflict in 1994-6, both the IMF and the Worl=
d Bank reluctantly kept=20

lending billions to Russia throughout the current round of devastation. A $=
4.5 billion arrangement=20

was signed with Russia in July 1999. Though earmarked, funds are fungible. =
The IMF has been=20

accused by senior economists, such as Jeffrey Sachs and Marshall Goldman, o=
f financing the=20

Russian war effort against the tiny republic and its 1.5 million destitute =
or internally displaced=20

citizens. Even the staid Jane's World Armies concurred.  No one knows how m=
uch the war has=20

cost Russia hitherto. It is mostly financed from off-budget clandestine ban=
k accounts owned and=20

managed by the Kremlin, the military, and the security services. Miriam Lan=
skoy, Program=20

Manager at the Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy at =
Boston University,=20

estimated for "NIS Observed" and "The Analyst" that Russia has spent, by No=
vember 2001, c. $8=20

billion on the war, money sorely needed to modernize its army and maintain =
its presence=20

overseas.  Russia was forced to close, post haste, bases in Vietnam and Cub=
a, two erstwhile=20

pillars of its geopolitical and geostrategic presence. It was too feeble to=
 capitalize on its massive,=20

multi-annual assistance to the Afghan Northern Alliance in both arms and ma=
npower. The USA=20

effortlessly reaped the fruits of this continuous Russian support and estab=
lished a presence in=20

central Asia which Russia will find impossible to dislodge.  The Christian =
Science Monitor has=20

pegged the cost of each month in the first three months of offensive agains=
t the separatists at=20

$500 million. This guesstimate is supported by the Russians but not by Digb=
y Waller, an=20

economist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a Lo=
ndon-based military think=20

tank. He put the real, out-of-pocket expense at $110 million a month. Other=
 experts offer=20

comparable figures - $100-150 a month.  Similarly, Jane's Defense Weekly pu=
t the outlay at $40-

50 million a day - but most of it in cost-free munitions produced during So=
viet times. A leading=20

Soviet military analyst, Pavel Felgengauer, itemized the expenditures. The =
largest articles are=20

transport, fuel, reconstruction of areas shattered by warfare, and active d=
uty bonuses to soldiers.=20

The expense of this brawl exceed the previous scuffle's. The first Chechen =
war is estimated to=20

have cost at most $5.5 billion and probably between $1.3 and $2.6 billion. =
Russia allocated c. $1=20

billion to the war in its 2000 budget. Another $263 million were funded par=
tly by Russia's=20

behemoth electricity utility, UES. Still, these figures are misleading unde=
restimates.  According too=20

the Rosbalt News Agency, last year, for instance, Russia was slated to spen=
d c. $516 million on=20

rebuilding Chechnya - but only $158 million of these resources made it to t=
he budget.  Russia has=20

been lucky to enjoy a serendipitous confluence of an export-enhancing and i=
mport-depressing=20

depreciated currency, tax-augmenting inflation, soaring oil prices, and Wes=
tern largesse. It is also=20

a major producer and exporter of weapons. Chechnya serves as testing ground=
s where proud=20



designers and trigger-craving generals can demonstrate the advantages and c=
apabilities of their=20

 war in Chechnya has fully=20

self-financed by reviving the military-industrial complex and adding billio=
ns to Russia's exports of=20

armaments. This surely is a wild hyperbole. Chechnya - a potentially oil-ri=
ch territory - is razed to=20

dust.  Russia is ensnared in an ever-escalating cycle of violence and futil=
