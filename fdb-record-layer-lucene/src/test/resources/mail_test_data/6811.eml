tate up to the act of=20

1844 on this subject will be found in the case of Bailey _v._ Mogg, 4 Denio=
, 60.[154]  At the time of=20

the passage of the act of 1813, and for many years afterward, nearly all of=
 the physicians in New=20

York State practised in accordance with the theories and precepts of what i=
s now called the=20

regular or allopathic school of medicine. That act provided that the physic=
ians in the respective=20

counties of the State of New York should meet in the respective counties an=
d organize county=20

medical societies. As a consequence of the fact that the physicians of that=
 day were chiefly of the=20

allopathic school, they necessarily obtained the control of the county medi=
cal societies and State=20

medical societies. Hence it became difficult, if not impossible, for physic=
ians who wished to=20

practise upon other theories and tenets than those obtaining in that school=
, to obtain licenses to do=20

so. With the growth of the hom=C5=93opathic school of medicine and the ecle=
ctic school of medicine,=20

came applications to the legislature asking for those practising under thos=
e schools the same=20

rights and privileges of organizing county and State societies as had been =
extended to physicians=20

generally by the act of 1813; so that in 1857, by Chapter 384, the legislat=
ure of New York State=20

enacted that the hom=C5=93opathic physicians might meet in their respective=
 counties and organize=20

county medical societies, with boards of censors having the same powers and=
 privileges which=20

were granted by the act of 1813; and by other laws similar privileges were =
granted to the so-called=20

eclectic school. After the passage of the act of 1844, down to about 1874, =
as hereinbefore stated,=20
