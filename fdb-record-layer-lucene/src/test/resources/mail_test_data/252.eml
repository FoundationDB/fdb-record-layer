only be supposed to arise from ignorance, or from a mistaken determination =
to sacrifice it to the=20

Americans: from which, this is not the place to enquire. It will suffice to=
 observe, that in Spain it=20

has been at all times considered as the "ne plus ultra" of expatriation: a =
natural consequence of=20

this was the state of society which has been shewn to exist. [138] Nor is t=
his idea confined to=20

Spain alone: Mr. Whitbread, when addressing the House on the tyranny of Fer=
dinand to the liberal=20

party, concluded in the following manner: "Some have perished on the scaffo=

Japanese, assert shocks are most frequent at the equinoxes. In equatorial A=
merica, the natives=20

say an earthquake is preceded by drought, and is the precursor of rain. In =
the Dauphiny Alps, the=20

people regard earthquakes as the result of avalanches; and the latter are r=
eadily started by the=20

slightest atmospheric disturbances. In Central America the equinoctial idea=
 prevails.  These things=20

set the wise men to investigating. Much to their surprise, they began to di=
scover that the idea of=20

connection between the seasons and shocks seemed well-grounded. In 1834 Pro=
fessor Merian=20

announced that of one hundred and eighteen earthquakes at Basle, the majori=
ty had occurred in=20

the winter. Volger made a list of twelve hundred and thirty shocks in the A=
lps; seven hundred and=20

seventy-four=20

Phillippine islands!"  The islands have suffered too from another cause, th=
e adoption of the=20

Spanish language as that of the courts of justice, &c. &c. and the conseque=
nt neglect of that of the=20

natives amongst the higher classes of Europeans. Hence they are ignorant of=
 the feelings and=20

prejudices of the people they govern, and who look to them for example, or =
at least for precept;=20

and not a little of the extensive influence of the priesthood may be owing =
to their intimate=20

knowledge of the language, and winter. December showed one hundred and sixt=
y-eight; July forty.=20

Of ninety-eight quite severe shocks, but one had occurred in the summer. Of=
 five hundred and=20

thirty-nine earthquakes in the Rhine basin, one hundred and three occurred =
in the spring, one=20

hundred and one in the summer, one hundred and sixty-five in the autumn, on=

seventy in winter. Observations in the Antilles show a slight predominance =
of autumn and winter.=20
