her odd lumbering way. "See these little eggs," continued the Butterfly; "I don't know how long it 

will be before they come to life, and I feel very sick and poorly, and if I should die, who will take 

care of my baby Butterflies when I am gone? Will _you_, kind, mild, green Caterpillar? But you

_your_ rough food. You must give them early dew, and honey from the flowers, and you must let 

them fly about only a little way at first; for, of course, one can't expect them to use their wings 

properly all at once. Dear me! it is a sad pity you cannot fly yourself. But I have no time to look for 

another nurse now, so you will do your best, I hope. Dear! dear! I cannot think what made me 

come and lay my eggs on a cabbage-leaf! What a place for young Butterflies to be born upon! Still 

you will be kind, will you not, to the poor little ones? Here, take this gold-dust from my wings as a 

reward. Oh, how dizzy I am! Caterpillar! you will remember about the food--"  And with these 

words the Butterfly drooped her wings and died; and the green Caterpillar, who had not had the 

opportunity of even saying Yes or No to the request, was left standing alone by the side of the 

Butterfly's eggs.  "A pretty nurse she has      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.

"and a pretty business I have in hand! Why, her senses must have left her or she never would 

have asked a poor crawling creature like me to bring up her dainty little ones! Much they'll mind 

me, truly, when they feel the gay wings on their backs, and can fly away out of my sight whenever 

they choose!"  However, there lay the eggs on the cabbage-leaf; and the green Caterpillar had a 

kind heart, so she resolved to do her best. But she got no sleep that night, she was so very 

anxious. She made her back quite ache with walking all night round her young charges, for fear 

any harm should happen to them; and in the morning says she to herself--  "Two heads are better 

than one. I will consult some wise animal upon the matter, and get advice. How should a poor

But still there was a difficulty--whom should the Caterpillar consult? There was the shaggy Dog 

who sometimes came into the garden. But he was so rough!--he would most likely whisk all the 

eggs off the cabbage-leaf with one brush of his tail. There was the Tom Cat, to be sure, who would 

sometimes sit at the foot of the apple-tree, basking himself and warming his fur in the sunshine; 

but he was so selfish and indifferent! "I wonder which is the wisest of all the animals I know," 

sighed the Caterpillar, in great distress; and then she thought, and thought, till at last she thought 

of the Lark; and she fancied that because he went up so high, and nobody knew where he went to, 

he must be very clever, and know a great deal, for to go up very high (which _she_ could never 

do), was the Caterpillar's idea of perfect glory.  Now in the neighbouring corn-field their lived a 

Lark, and the Caterpillar sent a message to him, to beg him to come and talk to her, and when he 

came she told him all her difficulties, and asked him what she was to do to feed and rear the little 

creatures so different from herself.  "Perhaps you will be able to inquire and hear something about 

it next time you go up high," observed the Caterpillar, timidly.  The Lark said, "Perhaps he should;"

curiosity any further. Soon afterwards, however, he went singing upwards into the bright, blue sky. 

By degrees his voice died away in the distance, till the green Caterpillar could not hear a sound. 

So she resumed her walk round the Butterfly's eggs, nibbling a bit of the cabbage-leaf now and 

then as she moved along.  "What a time the Lark has been gone!" she cried, at last. "I wonder
