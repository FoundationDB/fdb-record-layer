Quebec.  The tidings came too late!  The French general had surrendered; he=
 would not now=20

break his word.  {224} Ramsay dreaded too much the vengeance of the English=
 in case the news=20

borne by the sixty horsemen was not true, but false.  How shall we picture =
the feelings of the town-

major Joanns?  When he returned he hid himself in a cellar and wept, while =
the blood-red cross of=20

St. George was flaunted from the summit of the citadel.  Thus at length, on=
 the 18th September=20

1759, the capital town and rock-bound fortress of New France fell into the =
hands of the English.=20

General Townsend recognised too well the danger of his position not to gran=
t favourable terms to=20



the enemy, whose troops and sailors were allowed to march out of the garris=
on with the honours=20

of war and granted passage in English ships to France.  The persons and pro=
perty of the=20

inhabitants were promised protection, and their religion was not to be inte=
rfered with.  But now the=20

question was with the English, should they keep Quebec or destroy it, as th=
ey had destroyed=20

Louisburg?  For a moment the city's fate trembled in the balance, and then =
it was resolved to keep=20

it. Ten battalions of the artillery and a company of Rangers were ordered t=
o remain behind and=20

through the long Canadian winter hold the ruins of Quebec against the effor=
ts of Lvis and the=20

French, for little more than ruins much of Quebec now was.  It needed enorm=
ous labour to make=20

the town secure against the enemy, or even habitable.  While Townsend saile=
d away to England,=20

leaving General Murray in charge, many working parties of soldiers were dis=
tributed through the=20

town to clear {225} the streets of rubbish and to repair the buildings for =
occupation.  The palace of=20

the Intendant was turned into winter quarters for an English regiment, whic=
h found there quantities=20

of unused firearms, iron-mongery, blankets, cloths and linen, trinkets and =
lace, furs, wine, sugar,=20

moccasins, and other stores.  These were seized upon with alacrity.  Nearly=
 7000 English, with=20

insufficient food and clothing, made ready to face the approaching winter. =
 Outposts in the=20

neighbourhood of Sillery, St. Foye, and Lorette were established in order t=
o guard against a=20

surprise and to cover the safety of the detachments sent out to gather fuel=
 in the surrounding=20

woods.  Canadian winters are cold, and the English soldiers were not yet ha=
rdened to their=20

severities, and this gathering of firewood became a very serious business. =
 Each detachment=20

could make only one trip a day to the forest, returning with a fair-sized l=
oad on a sled drawn by=20

hand.  The soldiers were obliged to go armed as they worked, and keep a sha=
rp lookout for fear of=20

attacks by the Indians, who were always skulking in the neighbourhood.  Win=
ter this year set in=20

even earlier than usual, and the brave soldiers who had served in India and=
 Europe were now face=20

to face with an enemy more terrible than the French.  Their faces, hands, a=
nd feet were often=20

frost-bitten, and on some occasions half the force of a detachment would be=
 borne back entirely=20

disabled.  As if this were not enough, fever and scurvy prevailed in the ga=
rrison the whole winter=20

long, and the brave fellows perished by scores and hundreds.  Those who=20

Meanwhile the inhabitants of the province were disarmed and required to tak=
e the oath of=20

allegiance to King George.  But they could not all be trusted.  The English=
 lived in constant=20

insecurity, and during the winter many rumours came of a projected attack b=
y the French, and=20

several skirmishes took place.  Once in November it was reported that Lvis =
was about to march=20

upon Quebec with 15,000 men the next month, for had he not sworn an oath to=
 eat his Christmas=20

dinner under the French flag within the walls?  So the half-frozen English,=
 each man hugging his=20

musket in his frost-bitten fingers, waited for the enemy. The enemy had a f=
ine sense of humour.  In=20

February a party of French and Indians sent a message to the English office=
rs that a large=20

company of expert hairdressers were prepared to wait upon them whenever the=
ir services were=20

required!  Needless to say, the English took no notice of this handsome off=
er to deprive them of=20

their scalps.  Not until April did the long-expected battle occur.  For mon=
