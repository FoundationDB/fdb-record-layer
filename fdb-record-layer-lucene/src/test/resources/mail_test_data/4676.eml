by restoring the fish to life and causing its scales and fins to return to =
it; at which the standers-by=20

being affrighted, he caused it to become as it was before: that one thousan=
d three hundred men=20

and women, all afflicted with bodily infirmities or poverty, ate of these p=
rovisions and were=20

satisfied, the fish remaining whole as it was at the first: that then the t=
able flew up to heaven in the=20

sight of all; and every one who had partaken of this food were delivered fr=
om their infirmities and=20

misfortunes: and that it continued to descend for forty days together, at d=
inner-time, and stood on=20

the ground till the sun declined, and was then taken up into the clouds. So=
me of the Mohammadan=20

writers are of opinion that this table did not really descend, but it was o=
nly a parable; but most=20

think that the words of the Kur-an are plain to the contrary. A further tra=
dition is that several men=20

were changed into swine [and apes] for disbelieving this miracle and attrib=
uting it to magic art; or,=20

as others pretend, for stealing some of the victuals from off it. Several o=
ther fabulous=20

circumstances are also told, which are scarce worth transcribing.--S. (B.) =
 [338] Some say the=20

table descended on a Sunday, which was the reason of the Christians' observ=
ing that day as=20

sacred. Others pretend this day is still kept among them as a very great fe=
stival; and it seems as if=20

the story had its rise from an imperfect notion of Christ's last supper and=
 the institution of the=20

Eucharist.--S.  [339] To explain this passage, the commentators tell the fo=
llowing story:--The=20

people of Antioch being idolaters, Jesus sent two of his disciples thither =
to preach to them; and=20

when they drew near the city, they found Habeeb, surnamed En-Nejjar, or The=
 Carpenter, feeding=20

sheep, and acquainted him with their errand; whereupon he asked them what p=
roof they had of=20

their veracity, and they told him they could cure the sick and the blind an=
d the lepers; and to=20

demonstrate the truth of what they said they laid their hands on a child of=
 his who was sick and=20

immediately restored him to health. Habeeb was convinced by this miracle an=
d believed; after=20

which they went into the city and preached the worship of one true God, cur=
ing a great number of=20

people of several infirmities; but at length, the affair coming to the prin=
ce's ear, he ordered them to=20

be imprisoned for endeavouring to seduce the people. When Jesus heard of th=
is, he sent another=20

of his disciples, generally supposed to have been Simon Peter; who, coming =
to Antioch, and=20

appearing as a zealous idolater, soon insinuated himself into the favour of=
 the inhabitants and of=20

their prince, and at length took an opportunity to desire the prince would =
order the two persons=20

who, as he was informed, had been put in prison for broaching new opinions =
to be brought before=20

him to be examined; and accordingly they were brought: when Peter, having p=
reviously warned=20

them to take no notice that they knew him, asked them who sent them; to whi=
ch they answered,=20

God, who had created all things and had no companion. He then required some=
 convincing proof=20

of their mission, upon which they restored a blind person to his sight and =
performed some other=20

miracles, with which Peter seemed not to be satisfied, for that according t=
o some he did the very=20

same miracles himself, but declared that if their God could enable them to =
raise the dead he would=20

believe them; which condition the two apostles accepting, a lad was brought=
 who had been dead=20

seven days, and at their prayers he was raised to life; and thereupon Peter=
 acknowledged himself=20

convinced, and ran and demolished the idols, a great many of the people fol=
lowing him and=20

embracing the true faith; but those who believed not were destroyed by the =
cry of the angel=20

Gabriel.--S. (B., Z., &c.)  [340] Some say these two were John and Paul; bu=
t others name different=20

persons.--S.  [341] Simon Peter.  [342] His tomb is still shown near Antioc=
h, and is much visited by=20

the Mohammadans.--S.  [343] Also some said he was taken up into heaven; and=
 others, that his=20



manhood only suffered, and that his godhead ascended into heaven.--S. (B.) =
 [344] Some,=20

referring the relative _his_ to the first antecedent, take the meaning to b=
e that no Jew or Christian=20

shall die before he believes in Jesus; for they say that when one of either=
 of those religions is=20

ready to breathe his last, and sees the angel of death before him, he shall=
 then believe in that=20

prophet as he ought, though his faith will not then be of any avail. Accord=
ing to a tradition of El-

Hajjaj, when a Jew is expiring the angels will strike him on the back and f=
ace, and say to him, 'O=20

thou enemy of God, Jesus was sent as a prophet unto thee, and thou didst no=
t believe on him;' to=20

which he will answer, 'I now believe him to be the servant of God:' and to =
a dying Christian they=20

will say, 'Jesus was sent as a prophet unto thee, and thou hast imagined hi=
m to be God, or the=20

son of God;' whereupon he will believe him to be the servant of God only an=
d His apostle.--Others,=20

taking the above-mentioned relative to refer to Jesus, suppose the intent o=
f the passage to be that=20

all Jews and Christians in general [the dead being raised to life in their =
graves] shall have a right=20

faith in that prophet before his death, that Henry II. and Eleanor of Guien=
ne. Fortunately, this latter=20

lady seems to have inherited none of the bad traits of her mother and names=
ake; at least=20

contemporary accounts call her "chaste, noble, and of good counsel." The fa=
mily of the young=20

Princess Blanche was large and of illustrious connections. We need not note=
 those of the direct=20

Plantagenet line, which are sufficiently familiar, but on her father's side=
 we may mention her eldest=20

sister, Berengere, who, married to her cousin, the King of Leon, had been f=
orced to separate from=20

him in spite of their love, in spite of their children, in spite of importa=
nt reasons of state. Queen=20

Berengere was of a character, it appears, very much like that of her sister=
, and there was much=20

love between the two. Another sister, but a year older than Blanche, marrie=
d Alphonso of Portugal,=20

whose brother was that Count Ferrand de Flandre defeated at Bouvines by Phi=
lippe Auguste and=20

kept in captivity for many years. Of this sister a curious story is told.  =
It appears that, in the=20

negotiations between John and Philippe Auguste, the name of the Princess of=
 Castille who should=20

become the wife of Prince Louis had not been specified. The King of Castill=
e had two unmarried=20

daughters, Urraque and Blanche. When the ambassadors of France came, accomp=
anied by=20

Queen Eleanor, the two princesses were brought before them. They chose Urra=
que, as the elder=20

and the more beautiful; but when they heard her name they protested that wo=
uld never do, it was=20

too hard for the people of France to learn to pronounce; and so the choice =
fell upon Blanche.  After=20

being conducted to Normandy, where was the court of her uncle, John, the li=
ttle princess was=20

married immediately. The treaty for whose ratification and observance she w=
as a sort of pledge=20

was signed on May 22, 1200. John ceded nearly all that Philippe could ask, =
and bestowed twenty=20

thousand marks sterling upon the young husband. The next day the ceremony w=
as performed at=20

Portmort, on the right bank of the Seine, by the Archbishop of Bordeaux, in=
 the presence of a great=20

assemblage of barons and ecclesiastics. The young prince and his bride coul=
d not be married on=20

French soil by reason of the interdict then in force against his father for=
 repudiating Ingeburge;=20

hence the choice of Norman soil and of such an out of the way place. The pr=
ince, aged only twelve=20

years and six months, proceeded with Blanche direct to Paris. There is no r=
ecord of the usual=20

festivities accompanying a royal marriage, despite the accounts of some mod=
ern historians, who=20

claim that there were grand tourneys, and that Louis was wounded in one of =
them.  In one so=20

young as Blanche it is useless to look for the traits of the grown woman; w=
e might conjecture=20

much, but it would be in the light of after events. To those about her at t=
his time Blanche seemed a=20



beautiful girl, deserving of the flattering play upon words which her name =
suggested. She was _la=20

princesse candide_ not only in looks but in conduct, and won the devoted lo=
ve of her boy=20

husband, who seems to have been himself of a lovable disposition. It was at=
 his request that Hugh=20

of Lincoln, at that time in great repute, visited Blanche, whom he found in=
 tears and managed to=20

console. But the times were troublous, and we may well suppose that there w=
as little chance for=20

the fostering of quiet domestic virtues when one had been forced to marry m=
erely for reasons of=20

state. It is rumored, though not positively confirmed, that the crafty King=
 of France made use of his=20

young daughter-in-law to solicit from King John another slice of Normandy, =
which John dared not=20

refuse. Whether this be true or not, it is at least certain that neither im=
mediately nor ultimately did=20

the marriage of Blanche de Castille help the English Plantagenets. For John=
 quarrelled with=20

Alphonso, Blanche's father, and the two were at war with intervals of truce=
, between 1204 and=20

1208, the subject of dispute being Gascony. Blanche naturally sided with he=
r father rather than=20

with her uncle, and when she bore heirs who might inherit the crown of Fran=
ce, made stronger by=20

the accession of the Norman lands which had been taken from John and given =
to her husband, it=20

is easy to see that her sympathies would be with her adopted country.  Blan=
che's first child a=20

daughter, who lived but a short time, and whose name is not known was born =
in 1205. On=20

September 9, 1209, she gave birth to a son, hailed as the heir to the crown=
, and named Philippe,=20

in honor of his grandfather. But this child, too, lived only a few years, d=
ying when between eight=20

and nine. In the interval, on January 26, 1213, Blanche had borne twins, Al=
phonse and Jean, who=20

did not live long. Other domestic joys and sorrows were coming to the young=
 princess. Her father=20

won a great victory over the Moors, at Las Navas de Tolosa, July 16, 1212, =
and her sister=20

Berengere wrote her the glad news: "It is my pleasure to inform you of joyf=
ul news; thanks be to=20

God, from whom all good comes, our king, our lord, our father has vanquishe=
d on the field of battle=20

the Emir Almounmenim, by which, I think, he has won very great honor; for u=
ntil this time it has=20

never happened that a king of Morocco has been defeated in a pitched battle=
." Within two years=20

after this the gallant Alphonso was dead,=20


_
when he descends from heaven and returns into the world, where he is to kil=
l Antichrist and to=20

establish the Mohammadan religion and a most perfect tranquillity and secur=
ity on earth [where he=20

will remain forty years, and then die.--Others again suppose that the words=
 'believe in him' signify=20

'believe in God.']--S. (B., Z., Jelal, &c.)  [345] It is a dispute among th=
e Mohammadans whether=20

Christ actually died or not before his assumption.--S. (B.)  [346] Some, ho=
wever, are of opinion it=20

[this passage] might have been revealed in answer to certain idolaters, who=
 said that the=20

Christians, who received the Scriptures, worshipped Jesus, supposing him to=
 be the son of God;=20

whereas the angels were more worthy of that honour than he.--S. (B.)  [347]=
 As easily as We=20

produced Jesus without a father [B.]. The intent of the words is to show ho=
w just and reasonable it=20

is to think that the angels should bear the relation of children to men rat=
her than to God, they being=20

His creatures as well as men, and equally in His power.--S.  [348] For some=
 time before the=20

resurrection Jesus is to descend on earth according to the Mohammadans near=
 Damascus, or as=20

some say near a rock [or rather a mountain-road] named ['Akabet] Afeek, wit=
h a lance in his hand,=20

wherewith he is to kill Antichrist, whom he will encounter at Ludd, or Lydd=
a, a small town not far=20

from Joppa. They add that he will arrive at Jerusalem at the time of mornin=
g-prayer, that he shall=20

perform his devotions after the Mohammadan institution, and officiate inste=
ad of the Imam, who=20

shall give place to him; that he will break down the cross, and destroy the=
 churches of the=20

Christians, of whom he will also make a general slaughter, excepting only s=
uch as shall profess El-

Islam.--S. (B.)   [349] Either by rejecting and contemning Jesus, as the Je=
ws do; or raising him to=20

an equality with God, as do the Christians.--S. (B.)  [350] For the Eastern=
 writers mention a sect of=20

Christians which held the Trinity to be composed of those three; but it is =
allowed that this heresy=20

has been long since extinct.--S.     INDEX OF CHAPTERS.      CHAP.         =

ken from Blanche, while=20

she was far from them, in a strange land. But her new country was winning a=
 hold upon her heart;=20

in the war then waging between her Uncle John and her father-in-law, all he=
r interests and all her=20

affection were on the side of France. And now another son was born, on Sain=
t Mark's day, April=20

25, 1215, at the royal residence of Poissy. The child was named Louis, and =
his birth seems to=20

have created but little interest, as was natural, since the older brother, =
Philippe, was still living. But=20

this child became the famous Saint Louis, and pious legends must needs gath=
er around his birth=20

and his infancy: it was at the special intervention of Saint Dominique, who=
se prayers Blanche had=20

asked, that this son was born; then, at the time of his birth, the pious qu=
een learned that, out of=20

consideration for her, the bells of the church of Poissy had been silenced,=
 so she had herself=20

removed, though then in childbed. The piety of Blanche was sincere but neve=
r exaggerated; it is=20

easy to see in such a legend the art of those who thought it fitting that a=
 saint, even before birth,=20

should allow nothing to interfere with the services of the church. In like =
manner Blanche's extreme=20



jealousy in regard to her baby is a fiction that has been often repeated. L=
ouis was given to a=20

nurse, Marie la Picarde, and there is no truth in the story which represent=
s Blanche as snatching=20

him from the breast of one of her ladies and forcing the infant to disgorge=
 the milk of the stranger.=20

The little Louis was not two years old when the English barons, in revolt a=
gainst John, called his=20

father to their aid and promised him the throne of England, to which he had=
 no claim except=20

through Blanche. Louis went to England, in spite of the anathemas of the Po=
pe against all who=20

dared oppose John. Successful at first against the English king, the French=
 prince began to suffer=20

serious reverses when the hated John was succeeded by his son, Henry, again=
st whom the=20

English barons had no just cause of complaint. Philippe Auguste had been fr=
om the beginning too=20

politic to lend his son open assistance, or even to sanction his enterprise=
. The task of collecting=20

and sending him reinforcements devolved upon Blanche. For the first time th=
e full energy of her=20

character is displayed. A chronicler, almost contemporary, records an alleg=
ed interview between=20

her and Philippe Auguste, who, deaf to his son's entreaties for help, had d=
eclared that he would do=20

nothing, and that he did not care to risk excommunication. "When Madame Bla=
nche (it is by this=20

title that she is referred to even when queen) heard of this she came to th=
e king and said: 'Would=20

you let my lord, your son, perish thus in a strange land? Sire, for God's s=
ake, remember that he is=20

to reign after you; send him what he needs, at least the revenues of his ow=
n patrimony.' 'Certes,'=20

said the king, 'I will do nothing, Blanche.' 'Nothing, sire?' 'No, truly.' =
'In God's name, then,' replied=20

Blanche, 'I know what I will do.' 'And what will you do?' 'By=20

beautiful children by my husband; I will put them in pledge, and well I kno=
w some who will lend me=20

on their security.' Then she rushed madly from the king's presence; and he,=
 when he saw her go,=20

believed that she had spoken but the truth. He had her called back, and sai=
d to her: 'Blanche, I will=20

give you of my treasure as much as you would have; do whatever you wish wit=
h it; but rest=20

assured that I myself will send him nothing.' 'Sire,' said Madame Blanche, =
'you say well.' And then=20

the great treasure was given to her, and she sent it to her lord."  The det=
ails of this conversation=20

may not be absolutely accurate, but the facts seem to have been correctly r=
ecorded. Blanche went=20

to Calais and there established headquarters for collecting provisions, mun=
itions, and a small army=20

for her husband. She despatched an expedition to his aid, the army being un=
der command of=20

Robert de Courtenay, the fleet under that of the famous pirate and freeboot=
er Eustache le Moine.=20

But the fleet was destroyed by the English off Sandwich, August 24, 1217, a=
nd there was no other=20

course open to Louis than to make the best terms he could with Henry III. a=
nd return to France.=20

Blanche had displayed an energy that elicited the admiration of her contemp=
oraries, but for the=20

next few years she had no part in the larger events of history.  Domestic d=
uties, domestic sorrows,=20

indeed, must have absorbed a good deal of the energy of this devoted wife a=
nd mother. In=20

September, 1216, her son Robert had been born. In 1218 she lost Philippe, h=
er oldest son. Three=20

other children came in rapid succession: John (1219); Alphonse (1220); Phil=
ippe Dagobert (1222).=20

Of these only Alphonse was destined to live to manhood. The anxious mother,=
 having lost so=20

many of her children, would make vows for their recovery when any of them f=
ell ill. Fearing that=20

she might have forgotten to fulfil some of these vows, often made under str=
ess of anguish, she=20

sought and obtained from the Pope (1220) permission to perform charities in=
 place of trying to fulfil=20

her vows in all cases.  In her native land, too, there were events to claim=
 her attention. Her=20

brother, Henry, having been accidentally killed after a short reign, Queen =
Berengere was the next=20

heiress; but she refused the crown for herself, placing it upon the head of=
 her son, Ferdinand III.,=20

whom she continued to counsel and assist very much as Blanche was later to =
counsel her son. It=20

is reported that the discontented subjects of Ferdinand offered the crown t=
o Blanche. Whether this=20



be true or not, she would never have taken sides against her sister Berenge=
re.  On July 14, 1223,=20

the great King Philippe Auguste died, and on August 6th Queen Blanche and K=
ing Louis VIII. were=20

crowned with solemn ceremonial. The Abbot of Saint-Remi, escorted by two hu=
ndred knights,=20

brought the sacred ampulla to the cathedral of Rheims, and the archbishop a=
nointed the royal pair.=20

The king's sword was borne in the procession by his half-brother, Philippe =
Hurepel, son of Agnes=20

de Meranie and Philippe Auguste. There were great festivities, lasting eigh=
t days, and the new=20

king and queen manumitted serfs and showed mercy upon prisoners and captive=
s. Queen=20

Blanche still remains in the background during the brief reign of Louis VII=
I.; but we may note that=20

she used her influence to secure the liberation of Ferrand de Portugal, Cou=
nt of Flanders, who had=20

been in captivity since the battle of Bouvines. Released from prison in 122=
7, Ferrand lived to=20

become one of Blanche's most steadfast and useful allies.  Louis VIII. died=
 in November, 1226,=20

leaving Blanche with eight children to care for; in addition to those alrea=
dy mentioned there were=20

Isabelle, Etienne, and Charles, all born since the accession of Louis. The =
king, who had forced the=20

submission of Languedoc during the expedition on which he died, made his ba=
rons swear to be=20

true to his son Louis. Realizing that his devoted wife could not reach him =
before his death, he=20

provided as best he could for her. With perfect confidence in her, a confid=
ence fully justified by the=20

event, he declared that Prince Louis, his heir, as well as the whole kingdo=
m and all the rest of his=20

children should be under the tutelage of Queen Blanche until they came of a=
ge; to this important=20

portion of the king's will some of the great barons and high church dignita=
ries were witnesses.=20

Blanche and her husband had loved each other tenderly and faithfully, and a=
t first the widowed=20

queen was looked upon with compassion. She was on her way to Louis's bedsid=
e, the younger=20

children in a carriage and Prince Louis riding ahead, when she was met by t=
he news of his death.=20

Her grief was pitiable; but her sense of duty toward her children and her r=
ealization of the=20

difficulties and dangers of her position gave her courage. She was not the =
kind of woman to=20

succumb under grief for the loss of a well-loved husband or anxiety at find=
ing herself obliged to=20

govern a kingdom whose king was yet a boy.  At first the old retainers of L=
ouis were around her=20

and faithful to her. She was politic enough to win the support of the only =
prince of the blood,=20

Philippe, surnamed Hurepel, on account of the great mat of shaggy hair he h=
ad inherited from his=20

father, Philippe Auguste. Ferrand, Count of Flanders, was her friend, and s=
he could rely upon the=20

support of most of the clergy, and especially upon that of the papal legate=
, Romain Frangipani,=20

Cardinal of Saint Angelo. Her surest allies, however, were the immediate se=
rvants of the crown:=20

the chancellor, Guerin, who was unfortunately not to live long; Archambaud =
de Bourbon, Count=20

Amaury de Montfort, the chamberlain, Barthelemy de Roye, and the noble cons=
table, Mathieu de=20

Montmorency. With the aid of such friends, Blanche began her duties as rege=
nt.  How long this=20

regency was to last, how long it really did last, are matters not altogethe=
r easy to determine. In the=20

first place, there were precedents, in the royal line as well as in feudal =
annals, for considering the=20

age of majority as fourteen years; but there seems to have been authority e=
qually as good for=20

holding to the age of twenty-one. Louis was in his twelfth year when his fa=
ther died. Blanche=20

continued to act as regent for about ten years, and there was no protest ba=
sed on the pretext that=20

the young king should have been considered a major at fourteen years.  As s=
oon as possible,=20

Blanche had Louis crowned, a ceremony which did not imply that he was to be=
 considered out of=20

her tutelage, but which did give him a certain amount of prestige and conse=
quent protection. The=20



coronation, which took place on November 29, 1226, at Rheims, was but poorl=
y attended by the=20

nobles. Already there was discontent, and the great house of Dreux, led by =
the crafty and=20

unscrupulous Pierre Mauclerc, Count of Brittany, was at the head of the dis=
affected. Count=20

Thibaud de Champagne, son of Blanche's first cousin, would have come to the=
 coronation, but=20

Blanche ordered the gates of Rheims closed against him; for it was currentl=
y rumored, though the=20

rumor was entirely without justification, that Louis VIII. had died very su=
ddenly because of poison=20

administered by Thibaud. But, with or without the presence of the great bar=
ons, Louis IX. was=20

crowned, and Blanche made for herself and her son such friends as she could=
.  In England Henry=20

III., always restive under the thought of the losses sustained by his fathe=
r in France, was=20

continually scheming to regain the lost territories. He formed alliances wi=
th some of the chief lords=20

of Poitou, entered into negotiations for the hand of Yolande, daughter of P=
ierre Mauclerc, and=20

made abortive, but nevertheless startling, preparations for a descent upon =
the coast of France. His=20

allies among the discontented French nobility took up arms, inspired in par=
t by the jealous Isabelle=20

d'Angouleme, who had been the queen of John Lackland and was now Countess o=
f Marche.=20

Blanche promptly summoned the ban royal to assemble at Tours, whither she w=
ent with Louis in=20

February, 1227. Count Thibaud de Champagne had been in treaty with the rebe=
ls and was=20

marching with his forces as if to join them in Poitou. Tradition says that =
he was diverted by a=20

secret message from Blanche; at any rate, he suddenly turned in his march a=
nd came to Tours,=20

did homage to the boy king, and was graciously received by the queen regent=
. The defection of=20

Thibaud upset the plans of the rebels, who quarrelled among themselves. Man=
y of them came,=20

one by one, to submit to Louis IX., and hostilities were suspended between =
the French and=20

Richard of Cornwall, brother and representative of Henry III.  During the t=
ruce which followed,=20

Blanche was enabled to prosecute the unfinished war in Languedoc against Ra=
ymond VII. of=20

Toulouse and the Albigensian heretics. One is surprised to find that certai=
n churches in France=20

refused at first to grant the king subsidies to conduct this crusade, and t=
hat it was only by the=20

vigorous measures of Cardinal Remain that they were at length compelled to =
yield.  The turbulent=20

barons could not endure being governed by a woman. If Blanche had been a we=
ak ruler the=20

indignity of bearing her rule would have been atoned for by the laxity of t=
hat rule; but she was=20

strong, and could control the barons, who accordingly hated her. Pierre Mau=
clerc and his party=20

declared that France was not meant to be ruled by a foreign woman; they cal=
led her "Dame=20

Hersent," like the she-wolf in the _Roman du Renart_; they circulated odiou=
s calumnies against=20

her. The most noteworthy of these calumnies is that which connected her nam=
e with that of=20

Thibaud de Champagne as an adulteress. They said that Blanche had been his =
paramour even=20

during the life of her husband; nay, that she had connived at the murder of=
 her husband, poisoned=20

by Thibaud. They alleged that she was, moreover, secretly sending the royal=
 treasure into Spain;=20

that she was so vile that one lover did not suffice; that she had illicit r=
elations with Cardinal=20

Remain. It is needless to say that there is no foundation for these tales; =
they are the tax that a=20

good woman paid for being at the same time great.  The malcontents plotted =
to separate the king=20

from his mother, and determined to carry him off by force. Blanche and Loui=
s were near Orleans=20

when warned of the danger. Hastening toward Paris, they were forced to take=
 refuge in the strong=20

castle of Montlhery, for the rebels were assembled in force at Corbeil, bet=
ween them and Paris.=20

Blanche appealed to the citizens of Paris to safeguard the king's approach.=
 There could not have=20



been a better testimonial to the popularity of the royal family and, incide=
ntally, to the good=20

government enjoyed under Blanche than the response made by these _bourgeois=
_. The militia of=20

the surrounding country having been gathered in Paris, the combined forces =
of the city and=20

country marched to Montlhery, deploying along the route. Long after this Sa=
int Louis used to tell=20

Joinville of his triumphal entry: "He told me," says this chronicler, "that=
 from Montlhery, the road=20

was filled with men with arms and men without arms, up to the gates of Pari=
s, and that all shouted=20

and called upon the Lord to grant him long and happy life, and to guard and=
 protect him=20

peaceful submission. England was still in a threatening attitude; while the=
 long and relentless war=20

against the Albigenses was dragging on, with success now on this side, now =
on that. Blanche had=20

need to fortify herself as wisely as she could. She sought the support of t=
he bourgeois. The=20

citizens of Limoges and of Saint-Junien in the Limousin, in charters grante=
d in 1228, swore fealty=20

to the queen as well as to the king. Cardinal Remain, at Blanche's instance=
, came back to France=20

as legate; she found his advice, and the prestige of the papal authority, o=
f material assistance.=20

After some negotiation, the truce with England was renewed for a year, from=
 July, 1228, to July,=20

1229.  Philippe Hurepel, who had been faithful for a time to the interests =
of his sister-in-law and=20

her son, displayed discontent, and now went over to the side of the rebels.=
 It is said that he even=20

had an eye on the throne, and that the barons had some notion of trying to =
set up Enguerrand de=20

Coucy as king that Coucy who was the head of the house with the famous mott=
o:          "Je ne suis=20

roi, ne due, ne prince, ne comte aussi:             Je suis le sire de Couc=
y."  Before actual hostilities=20

began, Blanche had required and received new oaths of fealty from the commu=
nes of the royal=20

domain north of the Seine, as far as Flanders. Magistrates of Amiens, Compi=
egne, Laon, Peronne,=20



and a host of other places, swore to defend the king, Queen Blanche, and he=
r children. The=20

barons had arranged that Pierre Mauclerc should begin hostilities, and that=
 when Blanche=20

summoned the feudal army to march against him each should come, but come wi=
th only two=20

knights, which would make a force so small that Mauclerc would have nothing=
 to fear. Once more=20

Thibaud de Champagne came to the rescue. He gathered all the troops he coul=
d, and came with=20

over three hundred knights, these being, when joined to the contingents fro=
m the loyal communes=20

of the royal domain, enough to save Blanche. In January, 1229, Blanche marc=
hed into the=20

domains of the refractory Mauclerc--who had refused to appear when summoned=
 to the court--and=20

laid siege to the strong castle of Belleme. In a few days, though the stron=
ghold was considered=20

impregnable, the garrison was forced to surrender. The actual military oper=
ations of this=20

successful siege were conducted, of course, by Blanche's general, Jean Clem=
ent, the marshal of=20

France; but she herself looked after the comfort of her army. It was intens=
ely cold; she ordered the=20

soldiers to build great bonfires in the camp, promising pay to those who wo=
uld fetch fuel from the=20

forests; by this means, men and horses were kept warm.  After the capitulat=

concessions which Blanche then made could not bring back all who had gone a=
way. Though her=20

policy may have been mistakenly severe one can but grant that she had cause=
 for being severe.=20

All our sympathies are with the woman whom the students did not hesitate to=
 vilify, reviving the=20

calumny about the relations of Blanche and Cardinal Romain, who had given h=
er able support in=20

this affair. Such currency did this vile story gain that one chronicler tel=
ls us that the queen=20

submitted to an examination to disprove it.  The first real victory for Fra=
nce in the long war of the=20

Albigenses came with the treaty of Paris, sometimes called the treaty of Me=
aux, April 12, 1229. It=20

is, perhaps, fortunate for the reader's good opinion of Blanche that we omi=
t to chronicle the horrors=20

of this war, though most of those horrors were committed before she became =
ruler of France.=20

Raymond VII., Count of Toulouse, the head and front of the resistance in Pr=
ovence, was Blanche's=20

cousin, and she had always shown herself mindful of family ties, so that we=
 may charitably=20

suppose that she did the best she could for the ruined Raymond. We do not k=
now that she=20



assisted at his humiliation,--barefooted, and in his shirt, he was led to t=
he door of Notre Dame and=20

made to swear absolute submission to the Church--but we cannot go wrong in =
assuming that=20

some of the wise provisions of the treaty of Paris were of her suggesting. =
The provisions were very=20

wise indeed, securing to the French crown almost everything that could be h=
oped; in our wildest=20

moments of enthusiasm, however, we could not accuse Blanche of having tempe=
red policy with=20

mercy. As a summary of the situation, we may state that Raymond contracted =
to' surrender to=20

Louis Beaucaire, Nimes, Carcassonne, and Beziers, with other territories on=
 the Mediterranean to=20

the west of the Rhone; that Toulouse and its territory must revert to his d=
aughter Jeanne, who was=20

to be espoused by one of the brothers of Louis IX.; that the dominions rema=
ining to him should=20

also revert to Jeanne, in failure of other heirs of his body. Failing heirs=
 of Jeanne, the domains=20

acquired as her dower were to revert to the crown of France. More complete =
ruin for Raymond=20

could hardly have been compassed. It was the end of Provence both as a poli=
tical and an artistic=20

entity.  We have alluded several times to the famous=20

Chansonnier_, Count of Champagne. His relations with Blanche of Castille ar=
e matter both of=20

history and of legend; it behooves us to try to sift the one from the other=
 and to present some=20

account of the loves of Blanche and Thibaud.  Thibaud's mother, Blanche de =
Navarre, Countess of=20

Champagne, had to play a role not unlike that of her cousin Blanche de Cast=
ille; she acted as=20

regent in the name of her son, and it was due to her good management that h=
e was allowed to=20

inherit his patrimony. This was surely an age of woman, with Berengere ruli=
ng in Castille, Queen=20

Blanche in France, and another Blanche, of the same family, in Champagne. T=
hibaud was of a=20

gallant temperament, priding himself upon his knightly accomplishments, but=
 not less upon his=20

talent as a poet; for he was one of those imitators of the troubadours whom=
 we might almost class=20

with the troubadours themselves. Of his gifts as a poet we shall not speak =
here; in the histories of=20

French literature will be found the record of many of his chansons. As a ma=
n, it is altogether=20

probable that Thibaud did not suffer from an over-scrupulous conscience; we=
 have knowledge of=20

his acting in very bad faith on several occasions. But these manifestations=
 of bad faith were almost=20

always to the advantage of Blanche de Castille. The rebel barons would ente=
r into league with=20

Thibaud, and he would agree to betray his queen, and would even consider se=
riously the question=20

of marrying the daughter and heiress of Pierre Mauclerc. At the critical mo=
ment comes a missive,=20

nominally from the boy king: "Sir Thibaud de Champagne, I have heard that y=
ou have promised to=20

take to wife the daughter of the Count Pierre de Bretagne; I bid you, by al=
l that you hold most dear=20

in this kingdom, that you do not so. The reason, you know full well;... for=
 never have I had one who=20

wished me more ill than this same count." The impulsive Thibaud reads the n=
ote, and he and his=20

knights turn aside to support the fair lady who was the real author of the =
missive. It was this sort=20

and which gave some color to the reports they industriously circulated, all=
eging that Blanche was=20

the mistress of Thibaud. The latter had already been accused of poisoning L=
ouis VIII.; it was now=20

tly:          "Trop est ce=20
