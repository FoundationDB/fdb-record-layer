 regard to water=20

organs, however, I shall not fail with all possible brevity and precision t=
o touch upon their=20

principles, and to give a sufficient description of them. A wooden base is =
constructed, and on it is=20

set an altar-shaped box made of bronze. Uprights, fastened together like la=
dders, are set up on=20

the base, to the right and to the left (of the altar). They hold the bronze=
 pump-cylinders, the=20

moveable bottoms of which, carefully turned on a lathe, have iron elbows fa=
stened to their centres=20

and jointed to levers, and are wrapped in fleeces of wool. In the tops of t=
he cylinders are openings,=20

each about three digits in diameter. Close to these openings are bronze dol=
phins, mounted on=20

joints and holding chains in their mouths, from which hang cymbal-shaped va=
lves, let down under=20

the openings in the cylinders.  2. Inside the altar, which holds the water,=
 is a regulator shaped like=20

an inverted funnel, under which there are cubes, each about three digits hi=
gh, keeping a free=20

space below between the lips of the regulator and the bottom of the altar. =
Tightly fixed on the neck=20

of the regulator is the windchest, which supports the principal part of the=
 contrivance, called in=20

Greek the [Greek: kanon mousikos]. Running longitudinally, there are four c=
hannels in it if it is a=20

tetrachord; six, if it is a hexachord; eight, if it is an octachord.  3. Ea=
ch of the channels has a cock=20

in it, furnished with an iron handle. These handles, when turned, open vent=
holes from the=20

windchest into the channels. From the channels to the canon there are verti=
cal openings=20

corresponding to ventholes in a board above, which board is termed [Greek: =
pinax] in Greek.=20

Between this board and the canon are inserted sliders, pierced with holes t=
o correspond, and=20

rubbed with oil so that they can be easily moved and slid back into place a=
gain. They close the=20

above-mentioned openings, and are called the plinths. Their going and when =
we came out of the=20

theatre we always said good-bye and parted as though we were strangers. Goo=
dness knows what=20

people were saying about us in the town already, but there was not a word o=
f truth in it all!  "In the=20

latter years Anna Alexyevna took to going away for frequent visits to her m=
other or to her sister;=20

she began to suffer from low spirits, she began to recognize that her life =
was spoilt and=20

unsatisfied, and at times she did not care to see her husband nor her child=
ren. She was already=20

being treated for neurasthenia.  "We were silent and still silent, and in t=
he presence of outsiders=20

she displayed a strange irritation in regard to me; whatever I talked about=
, she disagreed with me,=20

and if I had an argument she sided with my opponent. If I dropped anything,=
 she would say coldly:=20

"'I congratulate you.'  "If I forgot to take the opera-glass when we were g=
oing to the theatre, she=20

would say afterwards:  "'I knew you would forget it.'  "Luckily or unluckil=
y, there is nothing in our=20

lives that does not end sooner or later. The time of parting came, as Lugan=
ovitch was appointed=20

president in one of the western provinces. They had to sell their furniture=
, their horses, their=20

summer villa. When they drove out to the villa, and afterwards looked back =
as they were going=20

away, to look for the last time at the garden, at the green roof, every one=
 was sad, and I realized=20

that I had to say goodbye not only to the villa. It was arranged that at th=
e end of August we should=20

see Anna Alexyevna off to the Crimea, where the doctors were sending her, a=
nd that a little later=20

Luganovitch and the children would set off for the western province.  "We w=
ere a great crowd to=20

see Anna Alexyevna off. When she had said good-bye to her husband and her c=
hildren and there=20

was only a minute left before the third bell, I ran into her compartment to=
 put a basket, which she=20

had almost forgotten, on the rack, and I had to say good-bye. When our eyes=
 met in the=20

compartment our spiritual fortitude=20

4. These sliders have iron jacks fixed to them, and connected with the keys=
, and the keys, when=20

touched, make the sliders move regularly. To the upper surface of the openi=
ngs in the board,=20

where the wind finds egress from the channels, rings are soldered, and into=
 them the reeds of all=20

the organ pipes are inserted. From the cylinders there are connecting us bo=
th; I took her in my=20

arms, she pressed her face to my breast, and tears flowed from her eyes. Ki=
ssing her face, her=20

shoulders, her hands wet with tears--oh, how unhappy we were!--I confessed =
my love for her, and=20

with a burning pain in my heart I realized how unnecessary, how petty, and =
how deceptive all that=20

had hindered us from loving was. I=20
