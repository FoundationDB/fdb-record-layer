 that our Dinkie had=20

been found again. And Poppsy, not being quite able to get it through her sl=

promptly began to bawl. But there was little to bawl over, once she was tho=
roughly awake. And=20

then I went careening down to the telephone again, and called up Lossie's b=
oarding-house, and=20

had her landlady root the poor girl out of bed, and heard _her_ break down =
and have a little cry=20

when I told her our Dinkie had been found. And the first thing she asked me=
, when she was able to=20

talk again, was if Gershom Binks had been told of the good news. And I had =
to acknowledge that I=20

hadn't even _thought_ of poor old Gershom, but that Peter Ketley would sure=
ly have passed the=20

good word on to Casa Grande, for Peter always seemed to think of the right =
thing.  And then I=20

remembered about Duncan. For Duncan, whatever he may have been, was still t=
he boy's father.=20

And he must be told. It was my duty to tell him. So once more I climbed the=
 stairs, but this time=20

more slowly. I had to wait a full minute before I found the courage, I don'=
t know why, to knock on=20

Duncan's bedroom door.  I knocked twice before any answer came.  "What is i=
t?" asked the=20

familiar sleepy _bass_--and I realized what gulfs yawned between us when my=
 husband on one=20

side of that closed door could be lying lost in slumber and I on the other =
side of it could find life=20

doing such unparalleled things to me. I felt for him as a girl home, tired =
from her first dance, feels=20

for a young brother asleep beside a Noah's Ark.  "What is it?" I heard Dunc=
an's voice repeating=20

from the bed.  "It's me," I rather weakly proclaimed.  "What has happened?"=
 was the question that=20

came after a moment's silence.  I leaned with my face against the painted d=
oor-panel. It was=20

smooth and cool and pleasant to press one's skin against.  "They've found D=
inkie," I said. I could=20

hear the squeak of springs as my husband sat up in bed.  "Is he all marriag=
e to be. Still, he was=20

married and tenderly attached to his good wife. Thus it was probably not an=
y subtle distinction=20

between Real Presence and Transubstantiation, not misgivings as to the exac=
t degree of worship=20

argument founded on the Butlerian principle of probability as the guide of =
life. But Butler, with all=20

deference to his great name be it said, imports into questions of conscienc=
e and into the spiritual=20

domain a principle really applicable only to worldly concerns. A man will i=
nvest his money or take=20

any other step in relation to his worldly affairs as he thinks the chances =
are in his favour, but he=20

cannot be satisfied with a mere preponderance of chances that he possesses =
vital truth and that=20

he will escape everlasting condemnation. The analogy drawn by Keble between=
 the late=20

recognition of the Prayer Book instead of the too Protestant Articles as th=
e real canon of the=20

Anglican faith and the lateness of the Christian Revelation in the world's =
history was an application=20

of the analogical method of reasoning which showed to what strange uses tha=

"Yes, he's all right," I said with a great sigh. And I listened for an answ=

side of the door.  But instead of that Duncan's voice asked: "Where is he?"=
  "At Alabama Ranch," I=20

said, without realizing what that acknowledgment meant. And again a brief p=
eriod of silence=20

intervened.  "Who found him?" asked my husband, in a hardened voice.  "Pete=
