are not planetary. They are the leading stars of seven     constellations which turned round with 

the Great Bear in     describing the circle of the year.(372) These the Assyrians called     the seven 

Lumazi, or leaders of the flocks of stars, designated     sheep. On the Hebrew line of descent or 

development, these Elohim     are identified for us by the Kabalists and Gnostics, who retained 

the hidden wisdom or gnosis, the clue of which is absolutely     essential to any proper 

understanding of mythology or theology....     There were two constellations with seven stars each. 

_We_ call     them the Two Bears. But the seven stars of the Lesser Bear were     once considered 

to be the seven heads of the Polar Dragon, which     we meet with--as the beast with seven heads-

-in the Akkadian Hymns     and in _Revelation_. The mythical dragon originated in the     crocodile, 

which is the dragon of Egypt.... Now in one particular     cult, the Sut-Typhonian, the first god was 

Sevekh [the seven-     fold], who wears the crocodile's head, as well as the Serpent, and     who is 

the Dragon, or whose constellation was the Dragon.... In     Egypt the Great Bear was the 

constellation of Typhon, or _Kepha_,     the old genetrix, called the Mother of the Revolutions; and 

the     Dragon with seven heads was assigned to her son, Sevekh-Kronus, or     Saturn, called the 

Dragon of Life. That is, the typical dragon or     serpent with seven heads was female at first, and 

then the type     was continued, as male in her son Sevekh, the Sevenfold Serpent,     in Ea the 

Sevenfold, ... Iao Chnubis, and others. We find these     two in _The Book of Revelation_. One is 

the Scarlet Lady, the     mother of mystery, the great harlot, who sat on a scarlet-coloured     beast 

with seven heads, which is the Red Dragon of the Pole. She     held in her hand the unclean things 

of her fornication. That means     the emblems of the male and female, imaged by the Egyptians at 

the     Polar Centre, the very uterus of creation, as was indicated by the     Thigh constellation, 

called the Khepsh of Typhon, the old Dragon,     in the northern birthplace of Time in heaven. The 

two revolved     about the _pole of heaven_, or the Tree, as it was called, which     was figured at 

the centre of the "Why do you doubt it?"  "Because the secret does not belong to him; because, as 

I have told you, it has to do with a great queen."  "And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like 

that?"  "No, my lord, he had three colleagues, three brave men, men such as you were wishing for 

just now."  "And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?"  "As if 

they had been one man--as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast."  "You pique my 

curiosity, dear Rochefort; pray tell me the whole story."  "That is impossible; but I will tell you a true 

story, my lord."  "Pray do so, I delight in stories," cried the cardinal.  "Listen, then," returned 

Rochefort, as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal's motive. 

"Once upon a time there lived a queen--a powerful monarch--who reigned over one of the greatest 

kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much to injure the queen, 

whom once he had loved too well. (Do not try, my lord, you cannot guess who it is; all this 

happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned.) There came to the 

court an ambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost her heart to him; 

and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could 

never be replaced by any like them.  "As these ornaments were given by the king the minister 

persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen's appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball 

which was soon to take place. There is no occasion to tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for 

a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away, beyond 

seas. This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects--fallen from her high estate." 



"Indeed!"  "Well, my lord, four men resolved to save her. These four men were not princes, neither 

were they dukes, neither were they men in power; they were not even rich. They were four honest 

soldiers, each with a good heart, a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it. 

They set out. The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent 

them ever reaching their destination. Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by 


_
Enoch_ these two constellations are identified as Leviathan and     Behemoth-Bekhmut, or the 

Dragon and Hippopotamus = Great Bear, and     they are the primal pair that were first created in 

the Garden of     Eden. So that the Egyptian first mother, Kefa [or Kepha] whose     name signifies 

"mystery," was the original of the Hebrew Chavah,     our Eve; and therefore Adam is one with 

Sevekh the sevenfold one,     the solar dragon in whom the powers of light and darkness were 

combined, and the sevenfold nature was shown in the seven rays     worn by the Gnostic Iao-

Chnubis, god of the number seven, who is     Sevekh by name and a form of the first father as 

head of the     Seven.(373)   All this gives the key to the astronomical prototype of the allegory in 

_Genesis_, but it furnishes no other key to the mystery involved in the sevenfold glyph. The able 

Egyptologist shows also that Adam himself according to Rabbinical and Gnostic tradition, was the 

chief of the Seven who fell from Heaven, and he connects these with the Patriarchs, thus agreeing 

with the Esoteric Teaching. For by mystic permutation and the mystery of primeval rebirths and 

adjustment, the Seven Rishis are in reality identical with the seven Prajapatis, the fathers and 

creators of mankind, and also with the Kumaras, the first sons of of them alone arrived at the port, 

having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him. He crossed the sea and brought 

back the set of ornaments to the great queen, who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the 

appointed day; and this very nearly ruined the minister. What do you think of that exploit, my lord?" 

"It is magnificent!" said Mazarin, thoughtfully.  "Well, I know of ten such men."  Mazarin made no 

reply; he reflected.  Five or six minutes elapsed.  "You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?" 

said Rochefort.  "Yes. And you say that Monsieur d'Artagnan was one of those four men?"  "He 

led the enterprise."  "And who were the others?"  "I leave it to Monsieur d'Artagnan to name them, 

my lord. They were his friends and not mine. He alone would have any influence with them; I do 

not even know them under their true names."  "You suspect me, Monsieur de Rochefort; I want 

him and you and all to aid me."  "Begin with me, my lord; for after five or six years of imprisonment 

it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one's destination."  "You, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, 

shall have the post of confidence; you shall go to Vincennes, where Monsieur de Beaufort is 

confined; you will guard him well for me. Well, what is the matter?"  "The matter is that you have 

proposed to me what is

to procreate and multiply. This apparent contradiction is explained by the seven-fold nature--make 

it four-fold on metaphysical principles and it will come to the same thing--of the celestial men, the 

Dhyan Chohans. This nature is made to divide and separate; and while the higher principles 

Rochefort, shaking his head with an air of disappointment.  "What! impossible? And why is it 

impossible?"  "Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends, or rather, I am one of his. Have 

you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?"  "Since then Monsieur de
