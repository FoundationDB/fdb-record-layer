Meanwhile a motley army of office seekers, personal friends, and sightseers=
--to the number of ten=20

or fifteen thousand--poured into Washington to see the old rgime of Virgini=
a, New York, and=20

Massachusetts go out and the new rgime of the people come in. "A monstrous =
crowd of people,"=20

wrote Webster on Inauguration Day, "is in the city. I never saw anything li=
ke it before. Persons=20

have come five hundred miles to see General Jackson, and they really seem t=
o think that the=20

country is rescued from some dreadful danger." Another observer, who was al=
so not a=20

Jacksonian, wrote:    Parton, Life of Andrew Jackson, Vol. III, p. 168.  No=
 one who was in=20

Washington at the time of General Jackson's inauguration is likely to forge=
t that period to the day=20

of his death. To us, who had witnessed the quiet and orderly period of the =
Adams Administration, it=20

seemed as if half the nation had rushed at once into the capital. It was li=
ke the inundation of the=20

northern barbarians into Rome, save that the tumultuous tide came in from a=
 different point of the=20

compass. The West and the South seemed to have precipitated themselves upon=
 the North and=20

overwhelmed it. . . .  Strange faces filled every public place, and every f=
ace seemed to bear=20

defiance on its brow. It appeared to me that every Jackson editor in the co=
untry was on the spot.=20

They swarmed, especially in the lobbies of the House, an expectant host, a =
sort of Prtorian band,=20

which, having borne in upon their shields their idolized leader, claimed th=
e reward of the hard-

fought contest.  The 4th of March dawned clear and balmy. "By ten o'clock,"=
 says an eye-witness,=20

"the Avenue was crowded with carriages of every description, from the splen=
did baronet and=20

coach, down to wagons and carts, filled with women and children, some in fi=
nery and some in=20

rags, for it was the People's president." The great square which now separa=
tes the Capitol and the=20

Library of Congress was in much beloved, there is a pathetic end, an end th=
at brings no crowning=20

happiness, no reward; but punishment.  One trait in the character of Iseut =
is disconcerting to those=20

who cherish romantic ideals: her cruelty. We could forgive her the love for=
 Tristan, and we learn to=20

feel for her, as we read the romance, some part of the passion that instill=
ed itself into Tristan's=20

veins with the love draught; but what shall we say when she deliberately pl=
ans the murder of a=20

defenceless woman, and one who had performed service unexampled in its fide=
lity and sacrifice?=20

If Iseut represented the poetic ideal in the age of chivalry, was the real =
woman of that age like=20

Iseut? We can answer, unhesitatingly, no. The conditions of life in the rom=
ances were very highly=20

idealized, and certain forms in the romance became purely conventional. The=
 heroine must always=20

be more beautiful than tongue can tell, and she must, in the end, win her l=
over, or be merciful to=20

him, according as she began in disdain or in love sickness. Numerous advent=
ures, wildly fantastic=20

in character, preceded this consummation; but readers even in that day got =
to such a point that=20

their jaded palates could no longer be tickled even by the choicest extrava=
gances. Men knew that=20

in real life they did not love in that way; and women knew it, too, though =
they were perhaps slower=20

to confess it. At any rate, the reaction from the extreme type of romantic =
idealization of woman=20

began even while the romance of chivalry was trying to persuade its readers=
 that all women were=20

like Iseut, Guinever, Elaine, and that these were angels.  The reaction aga=
inst the ideal of chivalry=20

in literature took two main directions, the one, more purely comic or reali=
stic, representing the=20

woman of the middle classes, the other, more intellectual and satiric, repr=
esenting woman in=20

general but especially the lady. The first is represented, we may say, by t=
he great _Roman du=20

Renard_ and=20


_
Thus far the people had been sufficiently impressed by the dignity of the o=
ccasion to keep their=20

places and preserve a reasonable silence. But when the executive party star=
ted to withdraw, men,=20

women, and children rushed past the police and scrambled up the steps in a =
wild effort to reach=20

their adored leader and grasp his hand. Disheveled and panting, the Preside=
nt finally reached a=20

gate at which his horse was in waiting; and, mounting with difficulty, he s=
et off for the White=20

House, followed by a promiscuous popular tales which strolling minstrels we=
re wont to recite, the=20

_Fabliaux_. The second we find chiefly in the _Roman de la Rose_ and its nu=
merous progeny.=20

Renard is, of course, the central personage in the gigantic beast epic, but=
 we hear not a little of his=20

wife Hermeline or Erme, of madam wolf, Dame Hersent, and of Harouge, the le=
opardess. They=20

play before us a little game, which we know is the game of life as women li=
ved it in the days when=20

Renard was still a famous personage. To give but one episode, from=20


_
The late President had no part in the day's proceedings. On arriving in Was=
hington, Jackson had=20

refused to make the usual call of the incoming upon the outgoing Executive,=
 mainly because he=20

held Adams responsible for the newspaper virulence which had caused Mrs. Ja=
ckson such=20

distress and had possibly shortened her life. Deserted by all save his most=
 intimate friends, the=20

New Englander faced the last hours of his Administration in bitterness. His=
 diary bears ample=20

evidence of his ill-humor and chagrin. On the 3d of March he took up his re=
sidence on Meridian=20

Hill, near the western limits of the city; and thence he did not venture un=
til the festivities of the=20

ensuing century, Renard becomes the confidant of Noble (the lion), and lear=
ns of his amour with=20

Dame Harouge; forthwith the subtle Renard begins to intrigue, until at last=
 Harouge becomes his=20

mistress. Besieged in Maupertuis by Noble, Renard sends a flattering love l=
etter to each of his old=20

flames, the lioness, the wolf, and the leopardess. The three ladies are del=
ighted with the proposals=20

of the charming Maitre Renard. They draw lots to see which shall possess fo=
rever the affections of=20

the irresistible Lothario; the lot falls to Dame Hersent, and the three lad=
ies write a joint letter to=20

inform Renard of their choice, a choice not very pleasing to Renard, who is=
, moreover,=20
