that  - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from      the use of Project 

Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method      you already use to calculate your applicable 

taxes.  The fee is      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he      has 

agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 

Foundation.  Royalty payments      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you 

prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax      returns.  Royalty payments should 

be clearly marked as such and      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the 

address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to      the Project Gutenberg Literary 

Archive Foundation."  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies      you 

in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he      does not agree to the terms of the full 

Project Gutenberg-tm      License.  You must require such a user to return or      destroy all copies 

of the works possessed in a physical medium      and discontinue all use of and all access to other 

copies of      Project Gutenberg-tm works.  - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a 

full refund of any      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the      electronic 

work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days      of receipt of the work.  - You comply with 

all other terms of this agreement for free      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.  1.E.9.  If 

you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on 

different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from 

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project 

Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.  1.F.  1.F.1. 

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright 

research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm 

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the toises, when, in 

the rainy season, the rock Curiquima, and the farm of Capuchino near the hill of Pocopocori, 

become islands. The swelling of the Orinoco is augmented by the impulse of the waters of the 

Apure, which, far from forming, like other rivers, an acute angle with the upper part of that into 

which it flows, meets it at right angles.  We first proceeded south-west, as far as the shore 

inhabited by the Guaricoto Indians on the left bank of the Orinoco, and then we advanced straight 

toward the south. The river is so broad that the mountains of Encaramada appear to rise from the 

water, as if seen above the horizon of the sea. They form a continued chain from east to west. 

These mountains are composed of enormous blocks of granite, cleft and piled one upon another. 

Their division into blocks is the effect of decomposition. What contributes above all to embellish 

the scene at Encaramada is the luxuriance of vegetation that covers the sides of the rocks, leaving 

bare only their rounded summits. They look like ancient ruins rising in the midst of a forest. The 

mountain immediately at the back of the Mission, the Tepupano* of the Tamanac Indians is 

terminated by three enormous granitic cylinders, two of which are inclined, while the third, though 

worn at its base, and more than eighty feet high, has preserved a vertical position. (* Tepu-pano, 

place of stones, in which we recognize tepu stone, rock, as in tepu-iri, mountain. We here perceive 

that Lesgian Oigour-Tartar root tep, stone (found in America among the Americans, in teptl; 

among the Caribs, in tebou; among the Tamanacs, in tepuiri); a striking analogy between the 

languages of Caucasus and Upper Asia and those of the banks of the Orinoco.) This rock, which 

calls to mind the form of the Schnarcher in the Hartz mountains, or that of the Organs of Actopan 



in Mexico,* composed formerly a part of the rounded summit of the mountain. (* In Captain 

Tuckey's Voyage on the river Congo, we find represented a granitic rock, Taddi Enzazi, which 

bears a striking resemblance to the mountain of Encaramada.) In every climate, unstratified 

granite separates by decomposition into blocks of prismatic, cylindric, or columnar figures. 

Opposite the shore of the Guaricotos, we drew near another heap

the plain, and has less resemblance to a tumulus than to those masses of granitic stone, which in 

North Holland and Germany bear the name of hunenbette, beds (or tombs) of heroes. The shore, 

at this part of the Orinoco, is no longer of pure and quartzose sand; but is composed of clay and 

spangles of mica, deposited in very thin strata, and generally at an inclination of forty or fifty 

degrees. It looks like
