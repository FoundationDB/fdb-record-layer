  _
Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831. The slave States then had a striking=
 example of what the=20

intelligent Negroes of the South might eventually do. The leader of this up=
rising was Nat Turner.=20

Precocious as a youth he had learned to read so easily that he did not reme=
mber when he first=20

had that attainment.[1] Given unusual social and intellectual advantages, h=
e developed into a man=20

of considerable "mental ability and wide information." His education was ch=
iefly acquired in the=20

Sunday-schools in which "the text-books for the small children were the ord=
inary speller and=20

reader, and that for the older Negroes the Bible."[2] He had received instr=
uction also from his=20

parents and his indulgent young master, J.C. Turner.  [Footnote 1] Drewery,=
 _Insurrections in=20

Virginia_, p. 27.  [Footnote 2: Drewery, _Insurrections in Virginia_, p. 28=
.]  When Nat Turner=20

appeared, the education of the Negro had made the way somewhat easier for h=
im than it was for=20

his predecessors. Negroes who could read and write had before them the revo=
lutionary ideas of=20

the French, the daring deeds of Toussaint L'Ouverture, the bold attempt of =
General Gabriel, and=20

the far-reaching plans of Denmark Vesey. These were sometimes written up in=
 the abolition=20

literature, the circulation of which was so extensive among the slaves that=
 it became a national=20

question.[1]  [Footnote 1: These organs were _The Albany Evening Journal, T=
he New York Free=20

Press, The Genius of Universal Emancipation_, and _The Boston Liberator_. S=
ee _The   While the=20

birds their jubilant hymns repeat,   We chatted at dinner, and afterwards, =
  And the moments=20

pleasantly slid away,   But when Mr. Devize suggested cards,   I laughingly=
 told him I could not=20

play.    The cards are produced; the men begin;   I sit by Harry and watch =
his hand;   I am very=20

eager that he should win,   And when he does so, I feel very grand.    'Twa=
s all very well for once=20

you see;   Its novelty made it a thing to praise;   It was quite a joke for=
 a girl like me,   Living with=20

men and observing their ways.    But when Jack had dined again and again,  =
 And with others=20

enjoy'd the cards and fare.   With a little shiver that felt like pain,   I=
 would say 'good night' and=20

leave Harry there.    Cool is the chamber and pleasant the light,   Tranqui=
l and innocent, tender=20

and calm;   Sweet are the thoughts that approach us at night,   Sweet as th=
e breeze with its=20

perfumy balm.   And if I am reading the happy Word,   Or saying my prayers =
by the taper's glow,   I=20

wish that my Harry had _this_ preferr'd   To the painted toys and the men b=
elow.           *       *=20

*       *       *    'I wish that my Harry had this preferr'd'--   But ough=
t I to wish it, if he does not?   Has=20

my foolish heart from its duty err'd,   And the soft compliance of love for=
got?    There _can_ be no=20

question 'twixt wrong and right;   And surely we all can be brave and stron=
g;   Yet I seem a little=20

perplex'd to-night,   And hardly to know what _is_ right or wrong.    I'm v=
ery young to be anyone's=20

Trying to account for this insurrection the Governor of the State lays it t=
o the charge of the Negro=20

preachers who were in position to foment much disorder on account of having=
 acquired "great=20

ascendancy over the minds" of discontented slaves. He believed that these m=
inisters were in=20

direct contact with the agents of abolition, who were using colored leaders=
 as a means to destroy=20

the institutions of the South. The Governor was cognizant of the fact that =
not only was the=20

sentiment of the incendiary pamphlets read but often the words.[1] To preve=
nt the "enemies" in=20

other States from communicating with the slaves of that section he requeste=
d that the laws=20

regulating the assembly of Negroes be more rigidly enforced and that colore=
d preachers be=20

silenced. The General Assembly complied with this request.[2]  [Footnote 1:=
 _The Richmond=20

Enquirer_, Oct. 21, 1831.]  [Footnote 2: _The Laws of Virginia_, 1831-1832,=
 p. 20.]    And to know=20

about serious things like these--   Must my little hand touch my husband's =
life   With a thought of=20

something _more_ than to please?    What shall I do with this ghost of a ca=
re   That makes my silly=20

heart flutter and sink?   I will first kneel down and will say a prayer,   =
And then I'll ask Harry what I=20

should think!       Harry stalk'd into my room in a rage--   'Hilton and Wi=
lton have clear'd me out=20

quite;   A run of ill luck at every stage--   Fifty pounds lost since you l=
eft us to-night!   I'll have my=20

revenge on the rogues I vow!'   Marks of strange anger disfigure his face, =
  A dry parch'd lip and a=20

thundery brow,   And a sharp bright eye that has lost its grace.    So a lo=
v'd little hand comes=20

smoothing down--   Wandering kisses can anger eclipse;   The beautiful fore=
head has ceased to=20

frown,   And sweet is the kiss I find on my lips.    'Ah, dearest,' I whisp=
er, 'mourn not for this,   On a=20
