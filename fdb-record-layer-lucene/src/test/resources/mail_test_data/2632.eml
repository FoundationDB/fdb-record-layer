things which are habitually used as general conveniences. Hence, we shall b=

termed in Greek [Greek: akrobatikon], another worked by air, which with the=
m is called [Greek:=20

pneumatikon], and a third for hoisting; this the Greeks named [Greek: barou=
lkos]. In the climbing=20

class are machines so disposed that one can safely climb up high, by means =
of timbers set up on=20

end and connected by crossbeams, in order to view operations. In the pneuma=
tic class, air is=20

forced by pressure to produce sounds and tones as in an [Greek: organon].  =
2. In the hoisting=20

class, heavy weights are removed by machines which raise them up and set th=
em in position. The=20

climbing machine displays no scientific principle, but merely a spirit of d=
aring. It is held together by=20

dowels and crossbeams and twisted lashings and supporting props. A machine =
that gets its motive=20

power by pneumatic pressure will produce pretty effects by scientific refin=
ements. But the hoisting=20

machine has opportunities for usefulness which are greater and full of gran=
deur, and it is of the=20

highest efficacy when used with intelligence.  3. Some of these act on the =
principle of the [Greek:=20

mechane], others on that of the [Greek: organon]. The difference between "m=
achines" and=20

"engines" is obviously this, that machines need more workmen and greater po=
wer to make them=20

take effect, as for instance ballistae and the beams of presses. Engines, o=
n the other hand,=20

accomplish their purpose at the intelligent touch of a single workman, as t=
he scorpio or anisocycli=20

when they are turned. Therefore engines, as well as machines, are, in princ=
iple, practical=20

necessities, without which nothing can be unattended with difficulties.  4.=
 All machinery is derived=20

from nature, and is founded on the teaching and instruction of the revoluti=
on of the firmament. Let=20

us but consider the connected revolutions of the sun, the moon, and the fiv=
e planets, without the=20

revolution of which, due to mechanism, we should not have had the alternati=
on of day and night,=20

nor the ripening of fruits. Thus, when our ancestors had seen that this was=
 so, they took their=20

models from nature, and by imitating them were led on by divine facts, unti=
l they perfected the=20

contrivances which are so serviceable in our life. Some things, with a view=
 to greater convenience,=20

they worked out by means of machines him something and send him presents fo=
r Christmas and=20

Easter, but he used to save that too. Once a man is absorbed by an idea the=
re is no doing=20

anything with him.  "Years passed: he was transferred to another province. =
He was over forty, and=20

he was still reading the advertisements in the papers and saving up. Then I=
 heard he was married.=20

Still with the same object of buying a farm and having gooseberries, he mar=
ried an elderly and=20

ugly widow without a trace of feeling for her, simply because she had filth=
y lucre. He went on living=20

frugally after marrying her, and kept her short of food, while he put her m=
oney in the bank in his=20

name.  "Her first husband had been a postmaster, and with him she was accus=
tomed to pies and=20

home-made wines, while with her second husband she did not get enough black=
 bread; she began=20

to pine away with this sort of life, and three years later she gave up her =
soul to God. And I need=20

hardly say that my brother never for one moment imagined that he was respon=
sible for her death.=20

Money, like vodka, makes a man queer. In our town there was a merchant who,=
 before he died,=20

ordered a plateful of honey and ate up all his money and lottery tickets wi=
th the honey, so that no=20

one might get the benefit of it. While I was inspecting cattle at a railway=
-station, a cattle-dealer fell=20

under an engine and had his leg cut off. We carried him into the waiting-ro=
om, the blood was=20

flowing--it was a horrible thing--and he kept asking them to look for his l=
eg and was very much=20

worried about it; there were twenty roubles in the boot on the leg that had=
 been cut off, and he was=20

afraid they would be lost."  "That's a story from a different opera," said =
Burkin.  "After his wife's=20

death," Ivan Ivanovitch went on, after thinking for half a minute, "my brot=
her began looking out for=20



an estate for himself. Of course, you may look about for five years and yet=
 end by making a=20

mistake, and buying something quite different from what you have dreamed of=
. My brother Nikolay=20

bought through an agent a mortgaged estate of three hundred and thirty acre=
s, with a house for=20

the family, with servants' quarters, with a park, but with no orchard, no g=
ooseberry-bushes, and no=20

duck-pond; there was a river, but the water in it was the colour of=20


_
so, whatever they found to be useful for investigations, for the arts, and =
for established practices,=20

they took care to improve step by step on scientific principles.  5. Let us=
 take first a necessary=20

invention, such as clothing, and see how the combination of warp and woof o=
n the loom, which=20

does its work on the principle of an engine, not only protects the body by =
covering it, but also gives=20

it honourable apparel. We should not have had food in abundance unless yoke=
s and ploughs for=20

oxen, and for all draught animals, had been invented. If there had been no =
provision of=20

windlasses, pressbeams, and levers for presses, we could not have had the s=
hining oil, nor the=20

fruit of the vine to give us pleasure, and these things could not be transp=
orted on land without the=20

invention of the mechanism of carts or waggons, nor on the sea without that=
 of ships.  6. The=20

discovery of the method of testing weights by steelyards and balances saves=
 us from fraud, by a=20

brickyard and on the other a factory for burning bones. But Nikolay Ivanovi=
tch did not grieve much;=20

he ordered twenty gooseberry-bushes, planted them, and began living as a co=
untry gentleman.=20

"Last year I went to pay him a visit. I thought I would go and see what it =
was like. In his letters my=20

brother called his estate 'Tchumbaroklov Waste, alias Himalaiskoe.' I reach=
ed 'alias Himalaiskoe'=20

in the afternoon. It was hot. Everywhere there were ditches, fences, hedges=
, fir-trees planted in=20

rows, and there was no knowing how to get to the yard, where to put one's h=
orse. I went up to the=20

house, and was met by a fat red dog that looked like a pig. It wanted to ba=
rk, but it was too lazy.=20

The cook, a fat, barefooted woman, came out of the kitchen, and she, too, l=
ooked like a pig, and=20

said that her master was resting after dinner. I went in to see my brother.=
 He was sitting up in bed=20

with a quilt over his legs; he had grown older, fatter, wrinkled; his cheek=
s,=20
