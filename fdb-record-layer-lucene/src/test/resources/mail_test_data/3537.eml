dracaena marginata in the Bible. She had not given up one folly for the sak=
e of her Lord; she had not through sense of duty ever renounced the smalles=
t gain; her dangerous pleasures had been torn from her,--not yielded up of =
her own free will; she had clutched them as long as she could; she had been=
 made poor, desolate, garden, far out of reach of ugly weeds. I envied her,=
 for I felt how different her sweet, girl's life had been from my stormy if=
 sometimes brilliant career.  "Mr. Dundas sent you to me?" I asked. "When d=
id you see him? Surely not--since--"  "This afternoon," she answered quietl=
y, in a pretty, un-English dracaena marginata in the Bible. She had not giv=
en up one folly for the sake of her Lord; she had not through sense of duty=
 ever renounced the smallest gain; her dangerous pleasures had been torn fr=
om her,--not yielded up of her own free will; she had clutched them as long=
 as she could; she had been made poor, desolate, garden, far out of reach o=
f ugly weeds. I envied her, for I felt how different her sweet, girl's life=
 had been from my stormy if sometimes brilliant career.  "Mr. Dundas sent y=
ou to me?" I asked. "When did you see him? Surely not--since--"  "This afte=
rnoon," she answered quietly, in a pretty, un-English _
so easily through life as never to have a hard word or want a comfort becau=
se I served the=20

Saviour, I would _rather_ have some little scars to show,--not because they=
 would make me=20

deserve anything as a reward from my King, but because they would be snatch=
 my hand. I drew=20

away. He followed, but at this instant Marianne appeared at the door.  "The=
re is a young lady to=20

see Mademoiselle," she announced, her good-natured, open face showing all h=
er dislike of Count=20

Godensky. "A young lady who sends this=20


_
dearly I had loved him."  "Ay, ay," said Isaacs, calmly and even cheerfully=
, "_Blessed are they=20

which are persecuted for righteousness' sake_. It is the Master himself who=
 bade his wounded=20

servants _rejoice and leap for joy_. If we have never received so much as a=
 scratch in the long=20

struggle against the world, the flesh, and the devil, it looks as if our fi=
ghting had been but a sham,--

that we had kept out of the fire, and thought a great deal more of our own =
comfort than of the=20

honor of our Leader. He bore shame and loss for us; we should welcome shame=
 and loss for him."=20

The thought was taking from Isaacs all the venom that had been rankling in =
his wounded at once,=20

and consent to see her."  Thankful that the tete-a-tete had been interrupte=
d, I held out my hand for=20

the letter. Marianne gave it to me. I glanced at the name written below the=
 lines which only half=20

filled the first page of theatre paper, and found it strange to me. But, ev=
en if I had not been ready=20

to snatch at the chance of ridding myself immediately of Godensky, the few =
words above the=20

unfamiliar name would have made me say as I did say, "Bring the young lady =
in at once."      "I=20

come to you from Mr. Dundas, on business which he told me was     of the gr=
eatest and most=20

pressing importance.      "DIANA FORREST."  That was the whole contents of =
the=20


_
"Such sorrows are blessings and honors," cried Benoni, and his pale face br=
ightened as he said it.=20

"But what are sorrows," thought poor Sophy, "that come upon us, not because=
 we have followed=20

the Lord, but because we have wandered from him?" She had listened to the p=
receding=20

conversation in silence, bitterly conscious that the wounds which festered =
in her heart were not=20

those received in Christian warfare, but rather, in part at least, the cons=
equences of her early folly=20

and neglect of religion. Sophy knew too well how entirely her mind had been=
 set on the world. A=20

gay ribbon or dress, a gaudy bead necklace, a Sunday "lark," or a dance, ha=
d been more to her=20

silly, sinful heart than all the truths filled with arguments could not hav=
e moved me more.=20

CHAPTER XVIII   MAXINE MEETS DIANA  Godensky was obliged to take his leave,=
 which he did=20

abruptly, but to all appearance with a good grace; and when he was gone Mar=
ianne ushered in a=20

girl--a tall, beautiful girl in a grey tailor dress built by an artist.  Fo=
r such time as it might have taken=20

us to count twelve, we looked at each other; and as we looked, a little clo=
ck on the mantel softly=20

chimed the quarter hour. In fifteen minutes I should be due upon the stage.=
  The girl was very=20

lovely. Yes, lovely was the right word for her--lovely and lovable. She was=
 like a fresh rose, with=20

the morning dew of youth on its petals--a rose that had budded and was=20
