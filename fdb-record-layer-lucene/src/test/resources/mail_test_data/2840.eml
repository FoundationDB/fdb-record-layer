sudden, with frightful vehemence. He "roared like a camel," his eyes rolled=
 and glowed like red=20

coals, and on the coldest day terrible perspirations would break out all ov=
er his body. When the=20

terror ceased, it seemed to him as if he had heard bells ringing, "the soun=

some of the verses=20

revealed to him well-nigh made his hair turn white.'  No collection of thes=
e revelations was made=20

during Mohammad's lifetime; at his death, the Kur-an existed only as scatte=
red chaotically among=20

the believers. But about a year later, the death in battle of some of the m=
en who had specially=20

committed passages of the Kur-an to memory, and the dread that the whole of=
 Mohammad's=20

teaching might vanish at the end of a generation or two, induced Aboo-Bekr =
to make the=20

innovation from which every one shrank, and he gave orders to the Prophet's=
 secretary, Zeyd ibn=20

there was no bitter feeling carried away. The older ones related to the you=

similar meetings under the Council Tree, and the latter listened eagerly to=
 these tales.  Father=20

Buck and Mother Deer withdrew silently, leaving White Tail in command, with=
 the whole herd=20

crowding around him to flatter and congratulate. There was a new spring in =

chapters in a certain order, and presented Aboo-Bekr with a Kur-an which pr=
obably differed in no=20

essential particular from the book we have now. All scholars are agreed tha=
t Zeyd did his work=20

faithfully, and neither inserted nor omitted anything from party motives. B=
ut he seems to have=20

occasionally mixed up fragments of very different date in one chapter--Moha=
mmad himself=20

countenanced this--and may possibly have omitted some portions that were no=
t found till=20

afterwards.  Some twenty years later a second recension was ordered by the =
Khalif 'Othman.=20

Slight varieties of reading, mainly dialectal, had arisen; swords were near=
 being drawn over them;=20

and it was evident that a serious schism would come about if a uniform auth=
orised text of the Kur-

an were not provided. These slight dialectal differences were not sufficien=
tly settled, it would=20

seem, in Aboo-Bekr's edition, so this new recension was made by Zeyd and th=
ree men of the=20

Kureysh, for they would best know the original dialect of the Kur-an. The n=
ew edition followed the=20

first one, apparently, both in order and in matter; definitely fixing, howe=
ver, the true text in the=20

dialect of the Kureysh, and possibly adding any verses that might have been=
 discovered since=20

Zeyd's first edition. This second recension was conducted with the same car=
eful fidelity and=20

scrupulous impartiality as the first; and it was accepted by all the differ=
ent parties that were then=20

disputing the supremacy. Copies of this edition were then distributed to th=
e principal cities of the=20

empire, and the old copies and fragments were called-in and burned.  This e=
dition of 'Othman,=20

made about A.D. 660, is the one that has ever since been the authorised and=
 only version of the=20

Kur-an throughout the Muslim world and in the studies of European linguists=
. The only differences=20

that have since crept into the text are certain unimportant varieties in pl=
ace. Have I not done=20

White Tail found them together in the woods, talking and smiling, and so ha=
ppy in the possession=20

of each other=E2=80=99s love that neither seemed to regret the loss of auth=
ority. And White Tail, watching=20

them, said to himself:  =E2=80=9CThe honor of being leader of the herd is n=
ot all mine. I owe much of it to=20

them. They have trained me and taught me, and suffered for me, that I might=
 succeed. I shall=20

never forget that.=E2=80=9D  And to the end of his days, which were many, W=
hite Tail never forgot that to=20

had been spoken.=20
