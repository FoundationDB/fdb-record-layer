"You see it was this way. They gave me a bucket of thick clabber to take to the hogs. I was hungry 

and took the bucket and sat down behind the barn and ate every bit of it. I didn't know it would 

make me sick, but was I sick? I swelled up so that I all but bust. They had to doctor on me. They 

took soot out of the chimney and mixed it with salt and made me take that. I guess they saved my 

life, for I was awful sick.  "I never learned to read until I was 26 years old. That was after I left the 

plantation. I was staying at a place washing dishes for Goodyear's at Sapville, Georgia, six miles 

from Waycross. I found a Webster's spelling book that had been thrown away, and I learned to 

read from that.  "I wasn't converted until I went to work in a turpentine still and five years later I 

was called to preach. I am one of thirteen children and none of us has ever been arrested. We 

were taught right.  "I kept on preaching until I came to Miami. I have been assistant pastor at 

Bethel African Methodist Church for the past ten years.  "I belong to a class of Negroes called 

Geechees. My grandfather was brought directly from Africa to Port Royal, South Carolina. My 

grandmother used to hold up her hand and look at it and sing out of her hand. She'd make them 

up as she would look at her hand. She sang in Geechee and also made rhymes and songs in 

English."     FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)  Cora Taylor

Where, and about when, were you born? and dark superstitions. The Etruscan, as he has 

portrayed himself to us in his tombs, seems to have been, in his later development at least, a 

mixture of Sybaritism with a gloomy and almost Mexican religion, which brooded over the terrors 

of the next world, and sought in the constant practice of human sacrifice a relief from its 

superstitious fear. If the Roman could tolerate the Etruscans, be merciful to them, and manage 

them well, he was qualified to deal in a statesmanlike way with the peculiarities of almost any race, 

except those whose fierce nationality repelled all management whatever. In borrowing from the 

Etruscans some of their theological lore and their system of divination, small as the value of the 

things borrowed was, the Roman, perhaps, gave an earnest of the receptiveness which led him 

afterwards, in his hour of conquest, to bow to the intellectual ascendency of the conquered Greek, 

and to become a propagator of Greek culture, though partly in a Latinized form, more effectual 

than Alexander and his Orientalized successors.  In the second place, the geographical 

circumstances of Rome, combined with her character, would naturally lead to the foundation of 

colonies and of that colonial system which formed a most important and beneficent part of her 

empire. We have derived the name colony from Rome; but her colonies were just what ours are 

not, military outposts of the empire, _propugnacula imperii_. Political depletion and provision for 

needy citizens were collateral, but it would seem, in early times at least, secondary objects. Such

Some time in 1850 on John and Mollie Hoover's plantation between Savannah and Charleston 

near the Georgia line.  2. If you were born on a plantation or farm, what sort of farming section was 

it in?  They raised rice, corn wheat, and lots of cotton, raised everything they et--vegetables, taters 

and all that.  3. How did you pass the time as a child? What sort of chores did you do and what did 

you play?  I had to thin cotton in the fields and mind the flies at the table. I chased them with a fly 

bush, sometimes a limb from a tree and sometimes wid a fancy bush.  4. Was your master kind to 

you?  Yes, I was favored by being with my massy.  5. How many slaves were there on the same 

plantation and farm?  I don't know. There was plenty o' dem up in de hundreds, I reckon.  6. Do 

you remember what kind of cooking utensils your mother used?  Yes, dey had spiders an' big iron 

kettles that dey hung in de chimney first of securing those parts of the plain which were beyond 

the sheltering range of the city itself, secondly of guarding the outlets of the hills against the hill 

tribes, and eventually of holding down the tribes in the hills themselves. The custody of the passes 

is especially marked as an object by the position of many of the early colonies. When the Roman 

dominion extended to the north of Italy, the same system was pursued, in order to guard against 

incursions from the Alps. A conquering despot would have planted mere garrisons under military 

governors, which would not have been centres of civilization, but probably of the reverse. The 

Roman colonies, bearing onwards with them the civil as well as the military life of the Republic, 

were, with the general system of provincial municipalities of which they constituted the core, to no 

small extent centres of civilization, though doubtless they were

a long chain. When dey wanted to cook fast dey lowered de chain and when dey wanted to bake 

in the spiders, they's put them under de kettle can cover with coals until dey was hot. Dey'd put de 

pones in does double concerned spiders and turn them around when dey was done on one side. 

7. What were your main foods and how were they cooked?  We had everything you could think of 

to eat.  8. Do you remember making imitation or Roman conquered he dwelt," and the dwelling of 

the Roman was, on the whole, the abode of a civilizing influence. Representation of dependencies 

in the sovereign assembly of the imperial country was unknown, and would have been 

impracticable. Conquest had not so far put off its iron nature. In giving her dependencies municipal 

institutions and municipal life, Rome did the next best thing to giving them representation. A

corn or peanuts?  No. We had real coffee.  9. Do you remember ever having, when you were 

young, any other kind of bread besides corn bread?  Yes, batter and white bread.  10. Do you 

remember evaporating sea water to get salt?  [TR: word illegible] did hit dat way.  11. When you 

were a child, what sort of satrapy, though far below a nation.  Then how came Rome to be the 

foundress and the great source of law? This, as we said before, calls for a separate explanation. 

An explanation we do not pretend to give, but merely a hint which may deserve notice in looking 

for the explanation. In primitive society, in

mother having? Did they have a hanging pot in the fire place, and did they make their candles of 

their own tallow?  Always had fireplaces or open fires on the plantation, but after a long time while 

my massy had hearth stoves to cook on. De would give us slaves pot liquor to cook green in 

sometimes. Dey lit de fires with flint and steel, when it would go out. We all ate with wooden 

paddles for spoons. We made dem taller place of law, in the proper sense of the term, we find only 

tribal custom, formed mainly by the special exigencies of tribal self- preservation, and confined to 

the particular tribe. When Saxon and Dane settle down in England side by side under the treaty 

made between Alfred and Guthurm, each race retains the tribal custom which serves it as a 

criminal law. A special effort seems to be required in order to rise above this
