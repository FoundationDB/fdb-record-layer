imply. I could understand what Peter's presence at Alabama Ranch would come=
 to mean. And I=20

had to shut my eyes to the prospect. I was still the same old single-track =
woman with a clear-cut=20

duty laid out before her. There were certain luxuries, for the sake of my o=
wn soul's peace, I could=20

never afford.  "Why are you going back to your husband?" Peter was asking, =
with real perplexity=20

on his face.  "Because he needs me," I said as I stood watching the childre=
n go racing down the=20

slide.  "Why?" he asked, with what impressed me as his first touch of harsh=
ness.  "Must I explain?"=20

I inquired with my own first movement in self-defense, for it had suddenly =
occurred to me that any=20

such explaining would be much more difficult than I dreamed.  "Of course no=
t," said Peter,=20

changing color a little. "It's only that I'm so tremendously anxious to--to=
 understand."  "To=20

understand what?" I questioned, both hoping and dreading that he would go o=
n to the bitter end.=20

"That _you_ understand," was his cryptic retort. And for once in his life P=
eter disappointed me.  "I=20

can't afford to," I said with an effort at lightness which seemed to hurt h=
im more than it ought. Then=20

I realized, as I stood looking up into his face, that I was doing little to=
 merit that humble and=20

magnificent loyalty of Peter's. _He_ would play fair to the end. He was too=
 big of heart to think first=20

of himself. It was _me_ he was thinking of; it was _me_ he wanted to see ha=
ppy. But I had my own=20

road to go, and no outsider could guide me.  "It's no use, Peter," I said a=
s I put my mittened hand=20

on his gauntleted arm without quite knowing I was doing it. And I went on t=
o warn him that he must=20

not confront me with kindness, that I was a good deal like an Indian's dog =
which neither looks for=20

kindness nor understands it. He laughed a trifle bitterly at that and remin=
ded me, as he stood=20

staring at me, of a the gamblers who brought their fortunes to that vast ha=
zard table, the=20

democratic and aristocratic parties were merely _rouge_ and _noir_. The soc=
ial and political=20

equity, the reign of which we desire to see was, in truth, unknown to the m=
en of Caesar's time. It is=20

impossible to believe that there was an essential difference of principle b=
etween one member of=20

the triumvirate and another. The great adventurer had begun by getting deep=
ly into debt, and had=20

thus in fact bound himself to overthrow the republic. He fomented anarchy t=
o prepare the way for=20

his dictatorship. He shrank from no accomplice however tainted, not even fr=
om Catiline; from no=20

act however profligate or even inhuman. Abusing his authority as a magistra=
te, for party purposes,=20

he tries to put to a cruel and ignominious death Rabirius, an aged and help=
less man, for an act=20

done in party warfare thirty years before. The case of Vettius is less clea=
r, but Dr. Mommsen, at all=20

events, seems to have little doubt that Caesar was privy to the subornation=
 of this perjurer, and=20

when his perjuries had broken down, to his assassination. Dr. Mommsen owns =
that there was a=20

dark period in the life of the great man; in that darkness it could scarcel=
y be expected that the=20

Republicans should see light.  The noblest feature in Caesar's character wa=
s his clemency. But=20

we are reminded that it was ancient, not modern clemency, when we find numb=
ered among the=20

signal instances of it his having cut the throats of the pirates before he =
hanged them, and his=20

having put to death without torture (_simplici morte punivit_) a slave susp=
ected of conspiring=20

against his life. Some have gone so far as to speak of him as the incarnati=
on of humanity. But=20

where in the whole history of Roman conquest will you find a more ruthless =
conqueror? A million=20

of Gauls, we are told, perished by the sword. Multitudes were sold into=20


_
sun. Then he said an odd thing. "I wish I could make it a bit easier for yo=
u," he remarked as=20

impersonally as though he were meditating aloud.  I asked him why he said t=
hat. He evasively=20

explained that he thought it was because I had what the Romans called _cons=
tantia_. So I asked=20

him to explain _constantia_. And he said, with a shrug, that we might regar=
d it as firm=20

consideration of a extermination of the Eburones went to the verge even of =
ancient license. The=20

gallant Vercingetorix, who had fallen into Caesar's hands under circumstanc=
es which would have=20

touched any but a depraved heart, was kept by him a captive for six years, =
and butchered in cold=20

blood on the day of the triumph. The sentiment of humanity was at that time=
 undeveloped. Be it so,=20

but then we must not=20


_
explained, at that, that it wasn't a matter of choice, but of character. He=
 was willing to acknowledge=20

that I was right. But before that altogether unsatisfactory little debate w=
as over Peter made me=20

promise him one thing. He has made me promise that before I leave we have a=
 tramp over the=20

prairie together. And we have agreed that Sunday would be as good a day as =
any.     _Saturday=20

the of humanity.  Vast plans are ascribed to Caesar at the time of his deat=
h, and it seems to be=20

thought that a world of hopes for humanity perished when he fell. But if he=
 had lived and acted for=20

another century what could he have done with those moral and political mate=
rials but found what=20

he did found--a military and sensualist empire? A multitude of projects are=
 attributed to him by=20

writers who=20
