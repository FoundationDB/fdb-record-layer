say. By times, to any lover worthy of the name, the chosen woman figures as=
 a goddess, a tutelary=20

divinity postulating for a mere earthly man all that is high and holy and i=
nerrant; an impeccable=20

standard by which he can measure his own baser desires and ambitions and be=
 shrived of them.=20

At other times the straitly human has its innings, and the longing is for a=
 comrade, a companion, a=20

second self buried, lost, submerged in the loyalty which never questions. H=
aving come slowly to=20

maturity as a lover, Blount had been leaning toward the divinity definition=
 of Patricia Anners. But=20

now the iconoclastic change was breaking many images.  "You are willing to =
believe that I haven't=20

gone altogether backward?" he queried, after the little car had measured an=
 additional stretch of=20

the mesa road.  "You are with that name?"  "Not even a Frenchman."  "I came=
 on board of the=20

Blanche almost angry enough to break something, for certain members of my p=
arty have been=20

hunted and hounded the whole length of the Mediterranean; and I am determin=
ed to put a stop to=20

it," said Captain Ringgold, getting back some of the spirit in which he had=
 boarded the steamer. "I=20

am of the same mind still."  "You will have no further trouble with your tr=
oublesome customer," said=20

Captain Sharp, with a very agreeable smile.  "How do you know?"  "As the bo=
ys say, because I=20

know; I do not guess at it."  "You do not understand the matter."  "I know =
more about it than you=20

do."  "Do you know Ali-Noury Pacha?"  "I do; intimately."  "Then you know t=
hat he is one of the=20

greatest scoundrels that ever went six months without being=20


_
"How do you know I am?"  "I can tell; any woman could tell."  "Is the acqui=
rement of size and=20

strength so great a thing that--"  "I think it is--in a woman's eyes," she =
admitted fearlessly. "We are=20

all more or less primitive and--and, well, 'Stone-Agey,' let us say, in the=
 last analysis; at least,=20

women are." And then: "You don't know women very well, Evan."  "Don't I?"  =
"No, you don't. You=20

judge us by standards which have no existence outside of your own purely ma=
sculine deductions.=20

For example: I suppose you wouldn't admit for a moment that a good woman mi=
ght properly do=20

things which would be entirely discreditable in a man?"  He shook his head =
slowly and said:=20

"Yesterday, or the day before, I might have said 'no,' with all the cocksur=
eness of a boy of twenty.=20

To-day I can only say: 'Who am I, that I should judge any man--or any woman=
?'" Then suddenly:=20

"You are making excuses for my father's wife. You needn't, you know. She ha=
s fought me from the=20

beginning, and I know it. Sometimes I think that she is solely responsible =
for my failure to=20

accomplish the thing I had set my heart upon. Let it go; I don't bear malic=
e. Just now I'm more=20

interested in what you were saying about the sex differences and the woman'=
s point of view. Have=20

you been calling me a weak man, Patricia?"  "No; only--a little--convention=
al," she returned half=20

reluctantly.  "But you are the quintessence of conventionality yourself!" h=
e burst out.  "Am I?=20

Perhaps that was a passing phase, too. Quite probably the little things wil=
l remain--the dressing for=20

dinner and the paying of party calls and all that. But one really big man h=
as made many things=20

seem petty and trifling--things that I used to think were of the greatest p=
ossible importance."  "My=20

father, you mean?"  "Yes. If I should ever marry, Evan, I should be delirio=
usly happy if I could find=20

a man who promised to grow to the stature of your father."  There was manif=
estly no rejoinder to=20

be made to this by David Blount's son, though it pointed to another and sti=
ll more painful=20

involvement. What would Patricia say when the _debacle_ came? Would she los=
e faith in his=20

father, and in all masculinity, in the crash? Or would she borrow yet again=
 from the primitive=20

woman she had been half-acknowledging and still be loyal? In either case Bl=
ount saw his own=20

finish, and he was rather relieved when she left the sex argument indetermi=
nate and began to talk=20

of other things:  "There I must beg to differ from you. He may have been wh=
at you say in the past,=20

but he is not in the present," replied he of the Blanche, quite as decidedl=
y as the other had=20

spoken.  Captain Ringgold proceeded to demonstrate the truth of his remark =
concerning the=20

Pacha by relating his experience from Mogadore to Alexandria, detailing the=
 plots and=20

conspiracies of His Highness and his agents against the peace and safety of=
 his party. Captain=20

Sharp admitted the truth of all the attempts to capture Miss Blanche and Lo=
uis Belgrave.  "Then=20

you must admit that he is an unmitigated scoundrel," added Captain Ringgold=
.  "Much that you=20

charge to him was the work of his agents."  "He hatched up the conspiracy w=
ith Mazagan, for=20

Louis heard every word of it in the cafe at Gallipoli. The attempt was made=
 in Pournea Bay in the=20

Archipelago to take Miss Blanche and Louis out of the Maud."  "I grant it; =
but Mazagan far=20

exceeded his instructions, as he did at Zante."  "How much money did the Pa=
cha offer Mazagan to=20

obtain the persons mentioned?"  "Twenty thousand dollars, or a hundred thou=
sand francs; but that=20

is a bagatelle to him. The Pacha is another man now," added the ex-detectiv=
e impressively.  "How=20

long has he been another man?" asked Captain Ringgold with something like a=
 sneer.  "Over six=20

months."  "But Mazagan has been operating the same old scheme in Egypt with=
in two months,"=20

protested the commander of the Guardian-Mother very vigorously.  "Then he w=
as not acting under=20

the instructions of the Pacha."  "We should have found it difficult to beli=
eve that if you had told it to=20



us in Cairo," said the objector in a manner that might have made one who di=
d not know the=20

captain decidedly belligerent. "Mazagan told Louis that the Pacha had offer=
ed him two hundred=20

thousand francs if he succeeded in his enterprise, or half that sum if he f=
ailed."  "Then the fellow=20

lied!" exclaimed the captain of the Blanche.  "He told Louis if he would pe=
rsuade his trustee to give=20

him half the full amount of the reward, he would collect the other half of =
His Highness, as promised=20

in case of failure."  "That Mazagan is a villain and a scoundrel I have no =
doubt," said Captain=20

Sharp. "Since the affair at Zante, the Pacha has had no hand in the matter.=
"  "But the steamer of=20

His Highness, the Fatime, has been in Rosetta in command of Mazagan," put i=
n the objector with=20

earnestness, believing his reply would demolish the=20


_
of the following week, of the good times she had been having, and of the re=
gret with which she=20

would turn her back upon the wide horizons and the freedom of it all.  "I b=
rought my shell with me=20

when I came," she confessed, laughing, "but I think it is broken into littl=
e pieces by now. You will=20

know how small the pieces are when I tell you that 'Tennessee Jim,' your fa=
ther's horse wrangler,=20

calls me 'Miz' Pat,' and it always makes me want to shake hands with him." =
 Blount made the=20

afternoon last as he could, sending the little car over many miles of the m=
esa roads and=20

encouraging the small confidences which were enabling him to postpone  "Tha=
t can be explained,"=20

answered the commander of the Blanche. "If you believe there is joy in heav=
en over one sinner=20

that repenteth, it is quite time for me to tell my story; and I hope you wi=
ll take a different view of the=20

Pacha's present character, as I believe you will."  "Where is the distingui=
shed Moor now?" asked=20

Captain Ringgold, carelessly and flippantly, as though it was of no consequ=
ence to him where he=20

was.  "He is in the cabin."  "In the cabin!" exclaimed the commander of the=
 Guardian-Mother,=20

leaping out of his chair with an utter lack of dignity for him. "What cabin=
?"  "The cabin of the=20

Blanche, of course."  "Is this his=20


_
dipping toward the Carnadine Hills they returned over a trail which came in=
to the main Quaretaro=20

road at a point where the northern highway begins its descent to the lower =
mesa level. Half-way=20

down the descending gulch they came to the mouth of a small lateral canyon =
breaking into the=20

larger gorge from the eastward; a canyon dry for the  "It is."  "You told m=
e it was General Newry's,"=20

said the visitor with a frown, as he buttoned up his coat as though he was =
about to take his leave=20

of such a disagreeable locality. "General N-e-w-r-y."  "N-o-u-r-y is the wa=
y he spells it," interposed=20

the ex-detective. "Sit down, Captain. He is a general of the highest rank i=
n the army of=20
