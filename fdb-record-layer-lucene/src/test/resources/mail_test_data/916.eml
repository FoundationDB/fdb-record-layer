dracaena marginata Engineer; by Mr. Pike, President of the convention, and =
others who have seen it at work in the field.  LAYING TILE BY MACHINERY.  T=
here was nothing among the devices exhibited at this convention that attrac=
ted more attention or received more favorable private comment than a model =
of Chamberlin Brothers' Patent Apparatus for Tiling. the one nor the other =
is the fact; the face of the country, on either side of the river, is compa=

 to rise considerably above their present level, they would meet with no ob=
struction or impediment, for many miles on either side the river, but would=

.  There was nothing among the devices exhibited at this convention that at=
tracted more attention or received more favorable private comment than a mo=
del of Chamberlin Brothers' Patent Apparatus for Tiling. the one nor the ot=
her is the fact; the face of the country, on either side of the river, is c=

ould be _
brick at paying prices. If it will not pay to produce all tile, or so much =
tile as may be turned out, this=20

will afford relief and keep the machine in motion.  TILE MACHINERY.  Mr. Bi=
llingsby, whose=20

position allows him an excellent opportunity of judging, said there has bee=
n rapid improvement in=20

the machinery for tile-making. Great advance has been made in machines for =
preparing clay,=20

especially in the rapidity of handling it. The buildings for drying tile we=
re a great deal better than=20

five years ago. The means of ventilation are becoming excellent. The kilns =
are better and can be=20

more satisfactorily managed. There is yet need for a cheaper tile factory--=
one where the=20

investment of only a few hundred dollars will answer.  PROTECTING DRAINS.  =
It was generally=20

conceded that it is best to have some device at the end of the drains to ke=
ep out rabbits, water=20

animals, etc. Wires stretched across did pretty well but must be carefully =
looked after to clear=20

away the roots and refuse that come through the drains. Two or three device=
s to take the place of=20

wire were exhibited and were generally thought to be greatly superior.  OPE=
N DITCHES.  An=20

interesting feature of this convention was the introduction, for the first =
time, of the discussion of tile=20

ditching by machinery in a paper prepared by Hon. F. Plumb, of Streator, Il=
l. Mr. Plumb has been=20

experimenting for several years with tile ditches, using both animal and st=
eam power. He gave it=20

as his and with success. Our country yields to no other in the variety, or =
the value of its natural=20

productions. We owe it to ourselves and to the world, to search them out wi=
th diligence and=20

without delay.  _Somers, (N. Y.) Oct. 1818._     ART. II. _On the Origin of=
 Prairies._     _St. Louis,=20

(Missouri Ter.) March 3, 1819._    SIR,  The probable cause of the origin a=
nd continuance of=20

_prairies_ has been the subject of much speculation among the learned and c=
urious. The inquiry=20

is interesting; and many theories have arisen; but although plausible and i=
ngenious, they are, in=20

my opinion, unfounded in fact.  I should be glad to see the following remar=
ks, which were called=20

forth more particularly by the speculations of Caleb Atwater, Esq. (See No.=
 2. p. 116. of this work)=20

appear in your valuable Journal of Science; and they are, for that purpose,=
 at your service.    With=20

high respect, I am, Sir, your's,   R. W. WELLS.    _Benjamin Silliman, Esq.=
_  Mr. Atwater, after=20

describing the prairies and barrens, says, that according to the common opi=
nion, they "were=20

occasioned entirely by the burning of the woods," but, "erroneous informati=
on first propagated=20

such an opinion, and blind credulity has extended it down to us." Mr. A. go=
es on to affirm that,=20

"wherever prairies and barrens are found, there, for a long space of time, =
water once stood, but=20

was gradually drained off." The writer of this having often visited and obs=
erved with attention the=20

nature and=20


_
would be a machine that would perfect the ditch by one passage over the gro=
und. He has=20

perfected and is now manufacturing a steam power machine, at Streator, Ill.=
, which is spoken of=20

very highly by all who have seen it at work in the field. Mr. Plumb claims =
that the machine will cut=20

twenty rods of three-foot ditch in an hour, and give a grade and finish to =
the bottom of the ditch=20

equal to the very best hand work. The capacity of the machine is varied to =
any depth up to four=20

feet, and for any sized tile up to nine-inch. Two men can operate the machi=
ne. The cost of cutting=20

ditches, laying and covering tile is reduced to about ten cents per rod. He=
 has already sold several=20

of his machines, and is to be congratulated on the success he has attained =
in securing a good tile=20

ditcher. We can conceive of no one thing that will conduce to the sale and =
use of tile so much as=20

such a machine as the Plumb Steam Tile Ditcher. The machine is indorsed by =
C. G. Elliott, of=20

Tonica, of the prairies on the Alleghany mountains, in the states of Ohio, =
Indiana, and Illinois, and=20

having long been employed by the United States as a surveyor in the prairie=
 country of the=20

Missouri and Missisippi, thinks he may venture to oppose these speculations=
 without being=20

thought presumptuous. He is of opinion, that the vast prairies and barrens,=
 extending over the=20

greater part of the western states, and over nearly all Louisiana, were pri=
mitively occasioned, and=20

have been since continued, by the _combustion of vegetables_, and that _wat=
er_ had no agency=20

in their formation.  In order to prove the high prairies of the state of Oh=
io to have been once=20

covered by the waters of Lake Erie, Mr. A. maintains, that the channel of t=
he Niagara river has=20

been worn down "_several hundred feet_" by the attrition of its waters. Mr.=
 A. should have shown,=20

that the banks of the Niagara are, at this time, several hundred feet high,=
 or, like the Potomac, at=20

Harper's Ferry, has=20
