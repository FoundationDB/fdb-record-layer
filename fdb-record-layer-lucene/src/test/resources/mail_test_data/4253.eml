with a vengeance."  "And it makes me wish we had set the date of our departure for Camp 

Surprise a week or so earlier," remarked Cora. "I wonder if we could arrange to go any sooner."  "I 

could," declared Bess. "I haven't a thing to do."  "Except reduce," put in her sister tantalizingly. 

"Belle Robinson! If you don't stop those mean, insinuating remarks, I'll--I'll----"  "You won't give me 

any more of those chocolates you sneaked into your bag as we were coming out," finished Belle. 

"I saw you, and you know what Dr. Blake told you would happen if you didn't stop eating sweets. 

You'll get so----"  "These aren't sweet!" interrupted Bess. "They're the bitter kind, and they're 

delicious, too. They have them so fresh at Gordon's."  "It's a wonder she wouldn't give us a chance 

to decide for ourselves, instead of introducing expert testimony on her own account," laughed 

Cora. "Come, Bess, out with them!"  "Certainly," agreed the plump girl, with easy grace. "I 

intended to share them all along, but it was so warm----"  "Don't say warm again!" drawled her 

sister. "Your nose is as shiny now as a tin teakettle."  "Belle Robinson! It is not!"  Instantly Bess 

had her little mirror and vanity box in use, and a quick dab on her rather up-turned nose did away 

with the condition complained of, or at least alleged, by her sister.  "There, does that satisfy you?" 

she asked, turning about for inspection, as Cora swung the big car around a turn in the road.  "Oh, 

I'm easily satisfied," Belle murmured. "What a perfectly gorgeous view!" she cried, as she looked 

down from a a Sauce of Sack and Butter, and fine Sugar grated over them.    _Potatoe-_Pudding 

baked. From _Mr. Shepherd_ of _Windmill-Street._  Boil some fair Potatoes till they are tender; 

then, when they are made clean, bruise them in a Marble Mortar, till they become a Paste, with 

some Mace powder'd, some Sugar, and the Pulp of Oranges, with a _Naples_ Biscuit or two 

grated in, and a large Carrot grated. Add to these some Orange-Flower Water; and when all these 

are well mix'd, put to them some butter'd Eggs, with some slices of Butter laid upon your Pudding, 

when it is put into the Dish, or Pan. A little baking will serve for it; and when it is enough, serve it 

hot, with a garnish of sliced Lemon or Orange. Some will put this into a Paste, but not cover it. 

To make _Whipt Syllabubs._ From Mrs. _Cater_ of _Salisbury._  To a Pint of Cream put a Gill of 

Canary-Wine, and two Ounces of Loaf-Sugar finely beat, and a slice or two of Lemon; then with a 

clean Whisk, whip it together, adding a little Milk, as it grows thick: then have your Glasses clean, 

and put into each of them three or four spoonfuls of any sorts of Wine, red in some, and white in 

others, sweeten'd with fine Sugar powder'd; then fill your Glasses with the Froth of your Cream, as 

it is whipt up.    Of the fashionable Tables, for Persons of Rank, or Figure, where five Dishes are 

serv'd at a Course. From _S.G._ Esq.  The Tables I shall speak of, are so order'd, as to save a

lay nestled in a green valley, girt around by a winding, silvery river, glimpses of which could be had 

now and then between the trees that lined the shores.  "Yes, it is a good view," agreed Cora, 

stopping the car. "Cheerful Chelton looks even more amiable and love-like than usual to-day. It's 

cooler up here, too. Now pass over those chocolates, Bess."  "And watch her get more and more--

well, I'll say plump--before your eyes, like that fat boy Scott tells about," laughed Belle.  "It wasn't 

Scott's fat boy. He was in Dickens," corrected Cora. "Nicholas Nickleby, I think."  "Pickwick 

Papers!" voiced Bess. "There! I know something even if I am--plump. him, without interrupting any 

body. You must have first, a large Table with an hole in the Middle, of an Inch Diameter, wherein 

should be fix'd a Socket of Brass well turn'd, to admit of a Spindle of Brass, that will turn easily in 

it. The Table I speak of, may be, I suppose, five or six Foot diameter; and then have another 

Table-board made just so large, that as it is to act on the Centre of the first Table, there may be 

near a foot vacancy for Plates, _&c._ on every side. Then fix the Spindle of Brass in the Centre of 

the smaller Table, which Spindle must be so long, as, that when one puts it in the Socket of the 

great Table-board, the smaller
