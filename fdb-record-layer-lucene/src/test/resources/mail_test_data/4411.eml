philodendron monstera  It was no novelty for the boys to sleep in a tent at=
 camp, but as the night advanced they found that it was far from being summ=
er, in spite of the hot days, and they were glad of heavy clothing and the =
blankets which they had brought along.  "Now for that he shall be able to s=
ay, with a friend, that he would rather have the other six days weeded out =

ron monstera  It was no novelty for the boys to sleep in a tent at camp, bu=
t as the night advanced they found that it was far from being summer, in sp=
ite of the hot days, and they were glad of heavy clothing and the blankets =
which they had brought along.  "Now for that he shall be able to say, with =
a friend, that he would rather have the other six days weeded out of his me=
mory than the sabbath of his childhood.  PUBLIC WORSHIP.  Make the sabbath =
a day of religious activity. First of all, of course, is _
had there not been the worry about the water. As it was, they enjoyed it at=
 first, for in the cool,=20

moon-lit darkness they did not suffer from thirst. But when daylight came, =
and the sun began to=20

mount into the heavens, pouring down considerable heat on them, their tortu=
res began.  Tanker=20

Ike served out the water with sparing hand. The animals were given barely e=
nough to wet their=20

parched mouths, and the boys and two men got but little more. They made all=
 the speed they=20

could, which was not much, for the wagon held them back.  "Don't eat much,"=
 cautioned Ike as=20

they stopped for a mid-day lunch. "You'll not be so thirsty then."  But eve=
n refraining from food did=20

not seem to make much difference, and as the day wore on and the supply of =
water became lower=20

and lower, with a consequent reduction of the ration, the sufferings of the=
 boys grew acute.  "Oh,=20

for a good glass of ice water," sighed Bony.  "Dry up!" commanded Nat.  "I =
can't be any drier than I=20

am now," responded the bony lad.  Meanwhile, Tanker Ike had been anxiously =
scanning the=20

horizon. He appeared worried, and Jack, seeing this, asked him:  "Do you th=
ink we ought to be at=20

the river now?"  "We ought to, yes, but we're not," was his answer. "I'm af=
raid I've gotten off the=20

trail. I don't see any familiar landmarks, yet I was sure I took the right =
route."  He called a halt and=20

consulted with Mexican Pete. That individual was of the same opinion as Ike=
--that they were on=20

the wrong trail.  "Well, there's no help for it," said the plainsman. "We'l=
l have to go back a ways.=20

I'm sorry, boys. It's my fault. It's the first time I ever did a thing like=
 that."  "Oh, mistakes will=20

happen," said Jack, and he tried to speak cheerfully, but his voice was hus=
ky and his throat was=20

parched.  They turned around, the horses seeming unwilling to retrace their=
 steps, and they were=20

beginning to get restive, as were the mules.  "The last of the water," anno=
unced Tanker Ike at=20

dusk that evening, when they halted for a short meal. "We'll have to push o=
n with all speed to-

night. If we don't find water in the morning----"  He did not finish, but t=
hey all knew what he meant.=20

That night was one of fearful length, it seemed. As it wore on, and the par=
ched throats of the=20

travelers called for water where there was none, it became a torture.  Morn=
ing came, and the sun=20

blazed down hotter than ever. The horses and mules acted as if crazed, but =
they were urged on=20

relentlessly. The tongues of Jack and his comrades began to get thick in th=
eir mouths. Those of=20

the animals were hanging out, and foam was falling from their lips where th=
e bits chafed.  At noon,=20

though Tanker Ike strained his eyes for a sight of the Shoshone River or fo=
r some water hole,=20

there was no sign of either. On and on they pushed, trying to swallow to re=
lieve their terrible thirst.=20

Suddenly the horse which Sam rode gave a leap forward, and then began to go=
 around in a circle.=20

"That's bad," murmured Ike in a low voice. "He's beginning to get locoed fr=
om want of water."  He=20

urged his own beast up to Sam's, and gave the whirling animal a cut with th=
e quirt. That stopped it=20

for a while, and they went on.  Mexican Pete and Tanker Ike said little. Th=
ey were men used to the=20

hardships of the West, and it was not the first time they had suffered in c=
rossing the desert. But it=20

was hard for Jack and his chums. Nevertheless, they did not complain, but t=
aking an example from=20

the men, silently rode their horses. The poor beasts must have suffered dre=
adfully. Tanker Ike,=20

who was riding ahead, suddenly leaped off his horse. At first the boys thou=
ght he had seen a=20

water hole, but he merely picked up some pebbles from the sand.  "Put some =
of these in your=20

mouth and roll them around," he said. "It will help to make the saliva come=
 and keep down your=20

thirst some."  Mexican Pete followed his example, and the boys were about t=
o do likewise, when=20

Budge Rankin, reaching into his pocket, called out:  "What'smatterwithis?" =
 And he held out=20

several packages.     CHAPTER XVIII  LOST IN THE BAD LANDS   "Gum!" cried J=
ack. "Gum!=20



That's the stuff, Budge!"  "The very thing!" added Tanker Ike. "I wonder I =
didn't think to ask for=20

some. That will be better than the pebbles. Pass it around, young man."  Bu=
dge handed out=20

packages of gum, which done away with when they will admit that the other n=
ine are still binding?=20

I believe that the sabbath question to-day is a vital one for the whole cou=
ntry. It is the burning=20

question of the present time. If you give up the sabbath the church goes; i=
f you give up the church=20

the home goes; and if the home goes the nation goes. That is the direction =
in which we are=20

traveling.  The church of God is losing its power on account of so many peo=
ple giving up the=20

sabbath, and using it to promote selfishness.  HOW TO OBSERVE THE SABBATH. =
 "Sabbath"=20

means "rest," and the meaning of the word gives a hint as to the true way t=
o observe the day. God=20

rested after creation, and ordained the sabbath as a rest for man. He bless=
ed it and hallowed it.=20

"Remember _the rest-day_ to keep it _holy_." It is the day when the body ma=
y be refreshed and=20

strengthened after six days of labor, and the soul drawn into closer fellow=
ship with its Maker.  True=20

observance of the sabbath may be considered under two general heads: cessat=
ion from ordinary=20

secular work, and religious exercises.  I.--CESSATION FROM SECULAR WORK.  A=
 man ought to=20

turn aside from his ordinary employment one day in seven. There are many wh=
ose occupation will=20

not permit them to observe Sunday, but they should observe some other day a=
s a sabbath.=20

Saturday is my day of rest because I generally preach on Sunday, and I look=
 forward to it as a boy=20

does to a holiday. God knows what we need.  Ministers and missionaries ofte=
n tell me that they=20

take no rest-day; they do not need it because they are in the Lord's work. =
That is a mistake. When=20

God was giving Moses instructions about the building of the tabernacle, He =
referred especially to=20

the sabbath, and gave injunctions for its strict observance; and later, whe=
n Moses was conveying=20

the words of the Lord to the children of Israel, he interpreted them by say=
ing that not even were=20

sticks to be gathered on the sabbath to kindle fires for smelting or other =
purposes. In spite of their=20

zeal and haste to erect the tabernacle, the workmen were to have their day =
of rest. The command=20

applies to ministers and others engaged in Christian work to-day as much as=
 to those Israelite=20

workmen of old.  WORKS OF NECESSITY AND OF EMERGENCY.  In judging whether a=
ny work=20

may or may not be lawfully done on the sabbath, find out the reason and obj=
ect for doing it.=20

Exceptions are to be made for works of necessity and works of emergency. By=
 "_works of=20

necessity_" I mean those acts that Christ justified when He approved of lea=
ding one's ox or ass to=20

water. Watchmen, police, stokers on board steamers, and many others have en=
gagements that=20

necessitate their working on the sabbath. By "_works of emergency_" I mean =
those referred to by=20

Christ when He approved of pulling an ox or an ass out of a pit on the sabb=
ath day. In case of fire=20

or sickness a man is often called on to do things that would not otherwise =
be justifiable.  A=20

Christian man was once urged by his employer to work on Sunday. "Does not y=
our Bible say that if=20

your ass falls into a pit on the sabbath, you may pull him out?" "Yes," rep=
lied the other; "but if the=20

ass had the habit of falling into the same pit every sabbath, I would eithe=
r fill up the pit or sell the=20

ass."  Every man must settle the question as it effects unnecessary work, w=
ith his own=20

conscience.  No man should make another work seven days in the week. One da=
y is demanded=20

for rest. A man who has to work the seven days has nothing to look forward =
to, and life becomes=20

humdrum. Many Christians are guilty in this respect.  SABBATH TRAVELING.  T=
ake, for instance,=20

the question of sabbath traveling. I believe we are breaking God's laws by =
using the cars on=20

Sunday and depriving conductors and others of their sabbath. Remember the f=
ourth=20



commandment expressly refers to "the stranger that is within thy gates." Do=
esn't that touch=20

sabbath travel?  But you ask, "What are we to do? How are we to get to chur=
ch?"  I reply, on foot.=20

It will be better for you. Once when I was holding meetings in London, in m=
y ignorance I made=20

arrangements to preach four times in different places one sabbath. After I =
had made the=20

appointments I found I had to walk sixteen miles; but I walked it, and I sl=
ept that night with a clear=20

conscience. I have made it a=20


_
all the travelers were busily engaged in chewing it. In a measure it reliev=
ed their thirst at once, and=20

their tongues felt less swollen, and not so much like pieces of leather.  "=
'Stoobad," remarked=20

Budge as he put in a fresh wad.  "What is?" asked Jack.  "That the horses c=
an't chew," replied=20

Budge.  "Hu! I guess it would take a bigger cud than you could muster to sa=
tisfy a horse--or a=20

mule," remarked Tanker Ike. "But it's lucky you had it for us. I was feelin=
g pretty bad."  The little=20

diversion caused by the production of the gum and the relief it brought, he=
lped them to pass over=20

several miles in a comfortable fashion. But the terrible thirst did not lea=
ve them, and as for the=20

horses and mules, they were half crazed, or "locoed," as Tanker Ike express=
ed it.  How they=20

traveled the remainder of that day none of them could tell never to use the=
 cars, and if I have a=20

private carriage, I insist that horse and man shall rest on Monday. I want =
no hackman to rise up in=20

judgment against me.  My friends, if we want to help the sabbath, let busin=
ess men and Christians=20

never patronize cars on the sabbath. I would hate to own stock in those com=
panies, to be the=20

means of taking the sabbath from these men, and have to answer for it at th=
e day of judgment. Let=20

those who are Christians at any rate endeavor to keep a conscience void of =
offence on this point.=20

SABBATH TRADING.  There are many who are inclined to use the sabbath in ord=
er to make=20

money faster. This is no new sin. The prophet Amos hurled his invectives ag=
ainst oppressors who=20

said, "When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabba=
th, that we may set=20

forth wheat?"  Covetous men have always=20


_
beginning to get dusk there was a sudden movement among the animals.  "They=
 smell water,"=20

cried Ike as the mules, drawing the heavy wagon, broke into a run. "They sm=
ell water! They do, for=20

sure!"  And he was right. Half an hour later they came to a small water hol=
e, and here they slaked=20

their thirst, drinking slowly at first, and keeping the animals back from i=
t by main force, until they=20

had each been given a pailful, which they drank greedily. Then, after the l=
ife-giving fluid had had a=20

chance to take off the first pangs of thirst, boys, men and horses drank mo=
re freely.  "Petrified=20

persimmons!" exclaimed Nat. "I used to think ice-cream sodas were the best =
ever, but now I think=20

a cupful of water from a mud hole is the finest thing that ever came over t=
he pike. Let's have=20

another, boys!"  Their sufferings were at an end, and, their thirsts having=
 been slaked, they ate a=20

good meal and rested that night beside the water hole.  The next day they r=
eached the Shoshone=20

River and the end of the desert.  "Well, boys, now I'm going to leave you,"=
 said Tanker Ike. "Long=20

Gun will be here pretty soon, and he'll show you where to get some big game=
. Then you'll have to=20

sort of shift for yourselves. Mexican Pete will take your camp stuff wherev=
er you tell him to, and=20

the rest depends on you."  "Oh, I guess we'll make out all right," replied =
Jack.  "But what about that=20

Indian, Long Gun?" asked Sam. "I thought he was to meet us here."  "He will=
," replied Tanker Ike=20

confidently, and, sure enough, about an hour later there sauntered into the=
 camp a tall, silent=20

Indian guide, who, as he advanced to the fire, uttered but one word:  "How?=
"  "How?" responded=20

the plainsman, and then he introduced the boys.  Long Gun merely grunted hi=
s salutations, and=20

then seating himself near the fire, he took out his pipe and began to smoke=
.  "I wonder why he=20

doesn't pass it around," whispered Nat to Jack.  "Pass what around?"  "His =
pipe? Isn't that a peace=20

pipe? I thought Indians always smoked the pipe of peace with their friends.=
"  Long Gun must have=20

had good ears, for he looked up at Nat's words. Then he smiled grimly.  "No=
 peace pipe. Corn-cob=20

pipe--plenty bad, too," he said. "Yo' got better one?"  "No, Long Gun, they=
 don't use pipes," said=20

Tanker Ike with a smile.  "Say, he understands English," remarked Sam.  "Th=
at's what," put in=20

Bony.  "Pity he wouldn't," remarked Ike. "He's been guiding hunting parties=
 of white men for the=20

last ten years."  Early the next morning Tanker Ike started back, taking a =
longer present time do=20

we find that they have openly counted on sabbath trade to make money. We ar=
e told that many=20

street car companies would not pay if it were not for the sabbath traffic, =
and the sabbath edition of=20

newspapers is also counted upon as the most profitable.  The railroad men o=
f this country are=20

breaking down with softening of the brain, and die at the age of fifty or s=
ixty. They think their=20

business is so important that they must run their trains seven days in the =
week. Business men=20

travel on the sabbath so as to be on hand for business Monday morning. But =
if they do so God will=20

not prosper them.  Work is good for man and is commanded, "Six days shalt t=
hou labor;" but=20

overwork and work on the sabbath takes away the best thing he has.  NECESSA=
RY AND=20

BENEFICIAL.  The good effect on a nation's health and happiness produced by=
 the return of the=20

sabbath, with its cessation from work, cannot be overestimated. It is neede=
d to repair and restore=20

the body after six days of work. It is proved that a man can do more in six=
 days than in seven. Lord=20

Beaconsfield. said: "Of all divine institutions, the most divine is that wh=
ich secures a day of rest for=20

man. I hold it to be the most valuable blessing conceded to man. It is the =
corner-stone of all=20

civilization, and its removal might affect even the health of the people." =
Mr. Gladstone recently told=20

a friend that the secret of his long life is that amid all the pressure of =
public cares he never forgot=20

the sabbath, with its rest for the body and the soul. The constitution of t=
he United States protects=20



the president in his weekly day of rest. He has ten days, "Sundays excepted=
," in which to consider=20

a bill that has been sent to him for signature. Every workingman in the rep=
ublic ought to be as=20

thoroughly protected as the president. If workingmen got up a strike agains=
t unnecessary work on=20

the sabbath, they would have the sympathy of a good many.  "Our bodies are =
seven-day clocks,"=20

says Talmage, "and they need to be wound up, and if they are not wound up t=
hey run down into=20

the grave. No man can continuously break the sabbath and keep his physical =
and mental health.=20

Ask aged men, and they will tell you they never knew men who continuously b=
roke the sabbath,=20

who did not fail in mind, body, or moral principles."  All that has been sa=
id about rest for man is=20

true for working animals. God didn't forget them in this commandment, and m=
an should not forget=20

them either.  II.--RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY.  But "rest" does not mean idleness. =
No man enjoys=20


_
that would not make it necessary for him to cross the desert. On the advice=
 of Long Gun the boys=20

and Mexican Pete started off up into the mountains, where they were to make=
 a camp, and begin=20

to hunt.  "Here good place," remarked Long Gun that afternoon, as they came=
 to a level clearing=20

on the shoulder of the mountain. "Plenty much mule deer and sheep here. Lik=
e um jack-rabbits, or=20

um bear? Plenty git here. We camp."  "Hu! Good!" grunted Mexican Pete, and =
he began to unload=20

the wagon. In a short time all the things Jack and the other boys had broug=
ht were on the ground,=20

beside the two tents length of time. When one goes on a vacation, one does =
not lie around doing=20

nothing all the time. Hard work at tennis, hunting, and other pursuits fill=
s the hours. A healthy mind=20

must find something to do.  Hence the sabbath rest does not mean inactivity=
. "Satan finds some=20

mischief still for idle hands to do." The best way to keep off bad thoughts=
 and to avoid temptation=20

is to engage in active religious exercises.  As regards these, we should av=
oid extremes. On the=20

one hand we find a rigor in sabbath observance that is nowhere commanded in=
 Scripture, and that=20

reminds one of the formalism of=20


_
"At last it begins to look like camping," remarked Bony.  "It'll look a goo=
d deal more like it if you'll=20

give us a correct imitation of a fellow helping put up a tent," said Jack. =
"Every one get busy, now."=20

Mexican Pete started back with the freight wagon, agreeing to come and get =
the camp stuff=20

whenever word was sent to Tanker Ike or him.  They pitched in with a will, =
Budge helping to good=20

advantage, and soon the canvas shelters were up, a fire built, and, under J=
ack's direction, a meal=20

was in progress, Long Gun the spirit of the gospel. Such strictness does mo=
re harm than good. It=20

repels people and makes the sabbath a burden. On the other hand we should j=
ealously guard=20

against a loose way of keeping the sabbath. Already in many cities it is pr=
ofaned openly.  When I=20

was a boy the sabbath lasted from sundown on Saturday to sundown on Sunday,=
 and I remember=20

how we boys used to shout when it was over. It was the worst day in the wee=
k to us. I believe it=20

can be made the brightest day in the week. Every child ought to be reared s=
o=20
