[_Aside._]      Vasantasena is too proud to own.       While I am near, her=
 love for one so crude;=20

So now I leave her here with him alone;       Love's confidences long for s=

[_Aloud._] Very well. I go.  _Vasantasena._ [_Seizing the hem of his garmen=
t._] Did I not throw=20

myself upon your protection?  _Courtier._ Do not fear, Vasantasena. Jackass=
, Vasantasena is a=20

pledge, committed to your hand.  _Sansthanaka._ All right. Jusht let her be=
 committed to my hand.=20

It 's a pledge that I 'll execute.  _Courtier._ Are you honest?  _Sansthana=
ka._ Honesht.=20

_Courtier._ [_Takes a few steps._] No! If I go, the wretch might kill her. =
I will conceal myself for a=20

moment, and see what he intends to do. [_He stands apart._]  _Sansthanaka._=
 Good! I 'll murder=20

her. But no! Perhaps thish tricky trickshter, thish Brahman, thish old jack=
al, has gone and hidden=20

 to deceive him. [_He gathers=20

flowers and adorns himself._] Vasantasena, my love, my love! Come!  _Courti=
er._ Yes, he has=20

turned lover. Good! I am content. I will go.                               =

Why not love me, my clean-toothed girl?     Why worship such a pauper churl=
?=20

lowing verses._]=20

O base and vile! O wretch! What more?       Why tempt me now with gold and =

 however, before all else=20

to study man--that is, human nature--and to distinguish in human nature wha=
t is universal and=20

absolutely new; it suffices to give to what is true a perfect expression. U=
nhappily, human nature,=20

as understood by Boileau, included little beyond the court and the town. Un=
happily his=20

appreciation of classical literature was defective; to justify as true and =
natural the mythology of=20

Greece he has to regard it as a body of symbols or a moral allegory. Unhapp=
ily his survey of=20

literature was too narrow to include the truths and the splendours of Media=
eval poetry and art. For=20

historical truth, indeed, he had little sense; seeking for what is permanen=
t and universal, he had=20

little regard for local colour and the truth of manners. To secure assent f=
rom contemporary minds=20

truth must assume what they take to be its image, and a Greek or Roman on t=
he stage must not=20

shock the demand for verisimilitude made by the courtly imagination of the =
days of Louis=20

Quatorze. Art which fails to please is no longer art.  To the workmanship, =
the technique of poetry,=20

Boileau attaches a high importance. Its several species--idyl, elegy, ode, =
sonnet, epigram,=20

rondeau, ballade, madrigal, satire, epic, tragedy, comedy--are separated fr=
om one another by=20

fixed boundaries, and each is subject to its own rules; but genius, on occa=
sion, may transcend=20

those rules, and snatch an unauthorised grace. It is difficult to understan=
d why from among the=20

_genres_ of poetry Boileau omitted the fable; perhaps he did not regard its=
 form, now in verse and=20



now in prose, as defined; possibly he was insensible of the perfection to w=
hich the fable in verse=20

 with the baseness of a=20

flatterer of the great. It would be more just to notice the honourable inde=
pendence which he=20

maintained, notwithstanding his poetical homage to the King, which=20
