dracaena marginata from the civilized world: the geographical position of t=
hose desert-locked and remote countries shuts them out from personal commun=
ication with strangers: the hardy explorer and the missionary creep through=
 the difficulties of distance in their onward paths, but seldom return: the=
 European merchant is rarely seen, and trade resolves itself into robbery a=
nd piracy upon the White Nile, and other countries, where distance the fain=

eplied Phil, gazing through the smoke of his pipe with a sinister smile, "i=
t makes a feller feel koorious to hear the partiklers about a lady wot _mus=
t_ have things, an' won't take no denial!  If I was you, now, I'd disappoin=
t her, an' see how she'd take it."  He wound up his remark, which was made =
in a bantering tone, with another dracaena marginata from the civilized wor=
ld: the geographical position of those desert-locked and remote countries s=
huts them out from personal communication with strangers: the hardy explore=

  If I was you, now, I'd disappoint her, an' see how she'd take it."  He wo=

cataracts would no longer exist, as the rocks which at present form the obs=

be the navigable channel of Egypt for the extraordinary distance of twenty-=

not only to Egypt, but to civilization, would be incalculable; those remote=

Here Mr Sparks=20

muttered something very like a malediction on ladies in general, and on lad=

dresses in particular.  "Your fire's dead out, Martha," he added, poking am=

of a live ember.  "Yes, Phil, it's out.  I can't afford fire of an evening;=
 besides it ain't cold just now."=20

"You can afford matches, I suppose," growled Phil; "ah, here they are. Usef=

"I believe not," replied Martha, with a faint smile, which, like a gleam of=
 sunshine on a dark=20
