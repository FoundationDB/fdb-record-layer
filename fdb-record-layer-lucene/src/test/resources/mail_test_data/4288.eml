be taken along in the old grub-box, and when that is over we'll patch together something in the 

form of bathing-suits, for there'll be a chance for a dip in the slough-water, and our kiddies have 

arrived at an age imposing fit and proper apparel on their sadly pagan but chastened parents. 

_Wednesday the Fifth_   We have had our day at Dead-Horse Lake, but it wasn't the happy event 

I had anticipated. Worldly happiness, I begin to feel, usually dies a-borning: it makes me think of 

wistaria-bloom, for invariably one end is withering away before the other end is even in flower. At 

any rate, we were off early, the weather was perfect, and the sky was an inverted tureen of lazulite 

blue. Dinkie drove the team part of the way, his dad smoked beside him up on the big driving-seat, 

and I raised my voice in song until Pauline Augusta fell asleep and had to be bedded down in the 

wagon-straw and covered with a blanket.  Dead-Horse Lake is really a slough, dolorously named 

because a near-by rancher once lost eight horses therein, the foolish animals wandering out on 

ice that was too thin to hold them up.  We were hungry by drove Falkland to cast away his life.  In 

the Civil War Falkland was always "ingeminating _Peace, Peace_". Our hearts are with him, but it 

was of no use. It is an unhappy part of civil wars that there can be no real peace till one party has 

succumbed: compromise only leads to a renewal of the conflict. There is sense as well as dignity 

in the deliberate though mournful acceptance of necessity, and the determination to play out the 

part which could not be declined, expressed in the letter written at the outbreak of the conflict by 

the Parliamentarian, Sir William Waller, to a personal friend in the other camp:  "My affections to 

you are so unchangeable that hostility itself cannot violate my friendship to your person; but I must 

be true to the cause wherein I serve. The great God, who is the searcher of my heart, knows with 

what reluctance I go upon this service, and with what perfect hatred I look upon a war without an 

enemy. The God of peace, in His good time, sent us peace, and in the meantime fit us to receive 

it! We are both on the stage, and we must act the parts that are assigned us in this tragedy. Let us

wood and made a fire. And after dinner Dinky-Dunk fell asleep and the children and I tried to 

weave a willow basket, which wasn't a success. Poppsy, in fact, cut her finger with her pater's 

pocket-knife and because of this physical disability declined to don her bathing-suit when we made 

ready for the water.  The slough-water was enticingly warm, under the hot July sun, and we 

ventured in animosities."  A man in this frame of mind, we submit, was likely to get to the end of a 

civil war more speedily than a man in the mood, amiable as it was, of Falkland.  Perhaps, after all, 

the failure, the inevitable failure of Falkland's passionate pleadings for peace may have saved him 

from a worse doom than death on the field even of civil war. In the case of the Five Members, the

It seemed like old times, to bask lazily in the sun and float about on my back with my fingers linked 

under my head. My lord and master even acknowledged that my figure wasn't so bad as he had 

expected, in a lady of my years. I splashed him for that, and he dove for my ankles, and nearly 

drowned me before I could get away.  It was all the mistress of his councils had, for the honour of 

his advisers. The pair might have used Falkland to lure by the pledge of his high character the 

leaders of the Parliament into the acceptance of a treaty? which the King, with his notions of divine 

right, and the Queen with her passionate love of absolute power, would, there can be little doubt, 

have violated as soon as the army of the Parliament had been disbanded, and the power of
