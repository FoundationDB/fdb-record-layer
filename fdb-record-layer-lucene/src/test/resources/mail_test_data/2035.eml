philodendron monstera for crossing a deep river, by holding to the tail of =
the swimming horse. In this I cannot agree; the safety of the man is much e=
ndangered by the heels of the horse, and his security depends upon the leng=
th of the animal's tail. In rivers abounding in crocodiles, which generally=
 follow an animal rushed to Boldizsar and offered him "Lebanon" for 45,000 =
florins; but Boldizsar only laughed, and said:  "Do you take me for a fool?=
"  Whereupon he went to Gaspar and said:  "Well, you may have 'Lebanon' for=
 40,000 florins."  Gaspar shook his head and answered:  "I'm not quite mad =
yet."  And now the philodendron monstera for crossing a deep river, by hold=
ing to the tail of the swimming horse. In this I cannot agree; the safety o=
f the man is much endangered by the heels of the horse, and his security de=
pends upon the length of the animal's tail. In rivers abounding in crocodil=
es, which generally follow an animal rushed to Boldizsar and offered him "L=
ebanon" for 45,000 florins; but Boldizsar only laughed, and said:  "Do you =
take me for a fool?"  Whereupon he went to Gaspar and said:  "Well, you may=
 have 'Lebanon' for 40,000 florins."  Gaspar shook his head and answered:  =
"I'm not quite mad yet."  And now the _
I had not wished to shoot until on our return towards the camp. We were abo=
ut four miles from=20

home, when a nellut (A. Strepsiceros) bounded away from a ravine. I was rid=
ing Tetel, whom I had=20

taught to stand fire, in which he was remarkably steady. I made a quick sho=
t with the little Fletcher=20

from the saddlle; but, as the nellut ran straight before me, the bullet str=
uck the haunch: away went=20

the aggageers after the wounded animal, like greyhounds, and in a few hundr=
ed yards the sword=20

finished the hunt.  The Nellut is the handsomest of all the large antelopes=
; the male is about=20

thirteen hands high, and carries a pair of beautiful spiral horns, upwards =
of three feet in length; the=20

colour of the hide is a dark mouse-grey, ornamented with white stripes down=
 the flanks, and a=20

white line along the back from the shoulder to the tail. The female is with=
out horns, but is in=20

possession, they would be obliged to pay him hush-money to hold his tongue.=
 As Gaspar turned=20

all this over in his mind, he began to find it ridiculous for him and Boldi=
zsar to keep on outbidding=20

each other, thus attracting every one's attention to them, putting money in=
to the boy's pocket, and=20

awakening Mrs. Panyoki's suspicions. And whichever bought "Lebanon" at last=
 would certainly not=20

be left to enjoy it unmolested. So he decided it would be cheaper if they w=
ere to work together,=20

buy the estate, share the contents of the caldron, and pay Prepelicza a cer=
tain sum yearly to hold=20

his tongue.  So one day the brothers came to terms, and Sztolarik was very =
surprised when, the=20

next day, the door opened, and in walked Boldizsar and announced that he ha=
d thought things=20

over, and come to the conclusion that "Lebanon" was decidedly not worth 50,=
000 florins, and he=20

had given=20


_
similar to the male. These beautiful animals do not inhabit the plains like=
 the other varieties of=20

antelopes, but are generally found in deep-wooded ravines. In South Africa =
it is known as the=20

koodoo.  The aggageers quickly flayed and quartered the game, which was arr=
anged upon the=20

horses, and thus it was carried to our camp, at which we arrived late in th=
e evening.  On the=20

following morning, at my usual hour of starting, a little before sunrise, w=
e crossed a deep portion of=20

the river, through which the horses were obliged to swim; on this occasion =
I rode Aggahr, who was=20

my best hunter. In that very charming and useful book by Mr. Francis Galton=
, "The up all idea of=20

buying it.  "That does not matter," said Sztolarik, "your brother will give=
 us 48,000 for it."  And he=20

waited impatiently till he had a chance of speaking to Gaspar about it. But=
 that good man calmly=20

answered:  "It was very stupid of me to offer so much for it, and I am real=
ly grateful to you,=20

Sztolarik, for not taking me at my word at once. Why, I can buy a good-size=
d estate for the money=20

I offered for it."  The lawyer hardly knew what to do next. He was afraid h=
e had made them go=20

back on their bargain, by letting them carry it on so long, and felt sure h=
e would be the laughing=20

stock of the town, and that Gyuri would reproach him with=20
