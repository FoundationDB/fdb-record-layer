philodendron monstera  [Illustration]  6. These notes, from being moveable,=
 take on different qualities; for they may stand at different intervals and=
 increasing distances. Thus, parhypate, which in the enharmonic is at the i=
nterval of half a semitone from hypate, has a semitone interval when transf=
erred to the chromatic. What is called lichanos in the enharmonic is at the=
 interval of a semitone from hypate; but when shifted to painting was the m=
ost ungrateful and boring art, that he was not an artist, that none but foo=
ls thought that he had any talent, and all at once, for no rhyme or reason,=
 he snatched up a knife and with it scraped over his very best sketch. Afte=
r his tea he sat plunged in gloom at the window and gazed at the Volga. And=
 now the Volga was dingy, all of one even colour without a gleam of light, =
cold-looking. philodendron monstera  [Illustration]  6. These notes, from b=
