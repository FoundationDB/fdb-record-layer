should devote her time to the moral and intellectual improvement of Negroes=
.[1] She entered upon=20

her career in Washington in 1851 assisted by Miss Anna Inman, a native of N=
ew York, and a=20

member of the Society of Friends. After teaching the girls French one year =
Miss Inman returned to=20

her home in Southfield, Rhode Island.[2] Finding it difficult to get a perm=
anent location, Miss Miner=20

had to move from place to place among colored people who were generally per=
secuted and=20

threatened with conflagration for having a white woman working among them. =
Driven to the=20

extremity of building a schoolhouse for her purpose, she purchased a lot wi=
th money raised largely=20

by Quakers of New York, Philadelphia, and New England, and by Harriet Beech=
er Stowe.[3] Miss=20

Miner had also the support of Mrs. Means, an aunt of the wife of President =
Franklin Pierce, and of=20

United States Senator W.H. Seward.[4] Effective opposition, however, was no=
t long in developing.=20

Articles appeared in the newspapers protesting against this policy of affor=
ding Negroes "a degree=20

of instruction so far above their social and political condition which must=
 continue in this and every=20

other slaveholding community."[5] Girls were insulted, teachers were abused=
 along the streets,=20

and for lack of police surveillance the house was set afire in 1860. It was=
 sighted, however, in time=20

to be saved.[6]  [Footnote 1: O'Connor, _Myrtilla Miner_, pp. 11, 12.]  [Fo=

was no shadow of doubt; and to that he had given his consent--_only to that=
_. When he knew=20

what had been done, his horror and anguish were unbounded. At last he was n=
ot so much=20

persuaded as compelled to take up the blood-stained sceptre which the consp=
irators laid at his=20

feet. I saw him myself, on the day of his coronation, yonder in the Cathedr=
al of the Assumption,=20

and sadder face have I never seen upon living man than that young handsome =
face of his. Often=20

yet I seem to see it, and to hear the very tones of his voice, as, kneeling=
 before the altar, he=20

recited the solemn coronation prayer: =E2=80=98May I be in a condition to a=
nswer thee without fear in the=20
