decorations of the polished surfaces of the walls ought to be treated with =
due regard to propriety,=20

so as to be adapted to their situations, and not out of keeping with differ=

the smoke from the fire=20

After the vaulting has been treated in the flat  I am an old man, I have be=

years, but I notice neither degeneration nor lack of ideals, and I don't fi=

value, says that the=20
