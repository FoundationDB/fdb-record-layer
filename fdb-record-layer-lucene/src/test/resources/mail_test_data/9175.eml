philodendron monstera for the attempted suicide.     THE INCENDIARY GANG   =
In the year 1833 I was engaged to investigate the circumstances attending a=
 fire--one of a series--which had ended in claims upon several of the great=
 London offices, and which fires were  the sun results in there being an eq=
uinox in one or the other of them about once in each month. So no matter in=
 what month a great storm may occur, the enthusiast can point out that a ne=
ighboring planet is at or near an equinox.  A careful philodendron monstera=
