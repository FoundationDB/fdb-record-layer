2. He shall examine every inmate on his entering the prison, and record    =
   in a book for that=20

purpose his name, date of entrance, date of       examination, nationality =
and race of inmate, and=20

of his parents; his       weight, stature and heredity, so far as affects h=
is criminality or       health;=20

also the condition of his heart, lungs and other organs; the       rate of =
pulse and respiration; the=20

measurement of the chest and       abdomen, and any existing disease, defor=
mity or other=20

acquired or       inherited disability, and he shall immediately vaccinate =
him.    3. He shall keep a=20

record of all admissions to and discharges from the       hospital, and of =
all cases treated by him,=20

with the name, number and       the place of the inmate, and the diagnosis =
and treatment, with=20

such       observations as may assist in forming a perfect record of each  =
     patient.    4. He shall=20

make a written report daily to the Warden of the attendance       at the si=
ck call in the morning, and=20

of the disposition made of       those reported sick. And also of all admis=
sions to, and discharges=20

from the hospital.    5. He shall, every morning, carefully examine all inm=
ates in the       solitary for=20

it is not the business here to pin down the Palate of any one to a certain =
Relish that I may like my=20

self, but to put it in the power of every one to preserve or order such thi=
ngs as a Farm or Garden=20

affords, so that they may be pleased with them. The Receipts which I have h=
ere given, are what I=20

have generally found to be the most approved. We have some who pickle the g=
reen Fruit of the=20

Passion-Tree, the Berougella, and Fig: but for my part I can find nothing t=
o recommend them, but=20

the relish of the Pickle, neither are they by any means wholesome.  The Flo=
wers of the=20

_Nasturtium Indicum_ make an excellent Sallad in this Month, and the Seeds =
of the Plant, while=20

they are green, may be pickled to our satisfaction: the Receipt for picklin=
g them is as follows.    To=20

pickle Nasturtium Seeds.  Gather the Seeds when they are full grown and gre=
en, in a dry day, and=20

lay them in Salt and Water for two or three days; then boil Vinegar, with s=
ome Mace, Ginger=20

sliced, and a few Bay-Leaves, for fifteen Minutes, and pour it boiling hot =
upon them, covering them=20

with a Cloth, as prescribed in this Month for the other Pickles, and repeat=
 the boiling of the Pickle,=20

and scalding them with it for three days=20


_
shall make a written report to the Warden as to the condition of       each=
. He shall be particular to=20

report to the Warden in writing any       inmate whose health he thinks is =
being injured by the=20

punishment or       restraint he is being subjected to, and shall recommend=
 such changes       in=20

such inmate's diet or otherwise as he may think necessary. In the       abs=
ence of the Physician=20

the Assistant Physician shall make similar       examinations every evening=
, and make a written=20

report to the Warden.    6. The Physician shall frequently, and also whenev=
er requested by the=20

Warden, examine all of the cells of the inmates, the plumbing and       cel=
l ventilators, for the=20

purpose of ascertaining whether they are       kept in a proper state of cl=
eanliness and ventilation=20

and in a good       sanitary condition and report their condition to the Wa=
rden and to       the official=20

who made the request.    7. He shall, whenever requested by the Warden, and=
 also whenever he=20

thinks proper, examine the quality of the provisions and condition       of=
 the food provided for=20

inmates. Whenever he shall find that any       provisions are unwholesome, =
or that the food is=20

insufficient, or for       any reason prejudicial to their health, he shall=
 immediately make       report=20

thereof to the Warden.    8. He shall have full control over the patients i=
n the hospital,       subject=20

to the rules of the prison and poured on, let it be cold before you cork it=
 up. The folded Cloth which=20

should be put over the Mouth of the Jar, will suffer some of the Steam of t=
he Pickle to pass thro' it,=20

and by that means the Pickles will not turn mouldy, so soon as they might o=
therwise do, and=20

besides will be much greener than if they were to be close stopped. All the=
se Pickles should be=20

kept in a dry Place, and look'd into every Month, lest by chance they turn =
mouldy; which if you find=20

they incline to, boil the Pickle afresh, and pour it on them as before.  Th=
ere is now the Skerret fit to=20

be eaten; it is a very nourishing and pleasant Root, and is prepared in the=
 following manner for the=20

Table: the Culture of it is set forth at large in my new _Improvements of P=
lanting and Gardening_,=20

printed for Mr. _Mears_, near _Temple-Bar_,  The Skerret, tho' it is none o=
f the largest Roots, yet=20

is certainly one of the best Products of the Garden, if it be rightly dress=
'd; the way of doing which,=20

is to wash the Roots very well, and boil them till they are tender, which n=
eed not be very long.=20

Then the Skin of the Roots must be taken off, and a Sauce of melted Butter =
and Sack pour'd over=20

them. In this manner are they serv'd at the Table, and eaten with the Juice=
 of Orange, and some=20

likewise use Sugar with them, but the Root is very sweet of itself.  Some, =
after the Root is boil'd,=20

and the Skin is taken off, fry them, and use the Sauce as above: So=20


_
and shall give daily instructions as to the treatment of each       patient=
 to the assistant physician=20

and his orders must be followed.    9. In case an inmate claims to be unabl=
e to labor by reason of=20

sickness       or other disability, the Physician shall examine such inmate=
. If, in       his opinion,=20

such inmate is unable to labor, or his occupation       should be changed, =
he shall immediately=20

certify the fact to the       Warden. Such inmate shall thereupon be releas=
ed from labor or his=20

occupation be changed or he be admitted to the hospital or elsewhere       =
for medical treatment,=20

as the Physician shall direct, having due       regard for the safe keeping=
 of such inmate. When he=20

to be prepared for the Table.  The Apple call'd the Codlin is in good perfe=
ction for scalding, the=20

manner of doing which, that they may be brought to Table, of a fine green C=
olour, is as follows.=20

Gather your Codlins half grown, and without Spots, for if they are spotted,=
 they are commonly=20

Worm-eaten; scald them in Water till the Skin will come off easily, then pu=
t them again into cold=20

Water, and a small piece of Allum to green in a Brass Pan over the Fire; wh=
ich they will soon do if=20

they are kept close cover'd.  The following Receipt is sent me by a curious=
 Person for pickling of=20

Codlins, in imitation of Mango.  Gather Codlins green and near full grown, =
blanch them, that is,=20

scald them in soft Water till=20


_
such inmate is sufficiently recovered to be able to labor the inmate       =
may be required to do so.=20

10. He shall, whenever requested to do so by the Warden, make a careful    =
   examination of any=20

inmate, and make a written report of his physical Vinegar and Bay Salt, abo=
ut a large Spoonful of=20

Salt to a Quart of Vinegar, three or four Cloves of Garlick, a quarter of a=
n Ounce of Ginger sliced,=20

and as much whole Pepper; boil this in a Brass Pan, with a piece of Allum a=
s big as a Horse-Bean,=20

for half=20
