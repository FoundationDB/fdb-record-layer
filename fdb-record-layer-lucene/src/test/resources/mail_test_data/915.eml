Lorna was generally left out altogether. Her father wrote to her occasional=
ly, but she had no other=20

friend or relation to send her even a post-card. She accepted the omission =
with the sad patience=20

which was her marked characteristic. Her affection for Irene had been an im=
mense factor in her=20

school life this term, but she was still very different from other girls, a=
nd kept her old barrier of shy=20

reserve. Irene, noticing Lorna's wistful look towards the post-bag, often t=
ried to share her=20

correspondence with her buddy; she would show her all her picture post-card=
s, briefly explaining=20

who the writers were and to what their allusions referred. At first Lorna h=
ad only been languidly=20

polite over them, but later she grew interested. Second-hand articles may n=
ot be as good as your=20

own, but they are better than nothing at all, and the various items of news=
 made topics for=20

conversations and gave her a glimpse of other people's homes.  Irene, finis=
hing her budget one=20

morning, sorted out any which she than they feel shocks from them when swim=
ming or bathing in=20

the Upper and Lower Missions, the basins of stagnant water and the confluen=
ts of the Orinoco (the=20

Rio Guarico and the canos Rastro, Berito, and Paloma) are filled with elect=
ric eels. We at first=20

wished to make our experiments in the house we inhabited at Calabozo; but t=

during three days we could not obtain one, though they are easily caught, a=

the Indians two piastres for every strong and vigorous fish. This fear of t=
he Indians is the more=20

extraordinary, as they do not attempt to adopt precautions in which they pr=
ofess to have great=20

confidence. When interrogated on the effect of the tembladores, they never =
fail to tell the Whites,=20

that they may be touched with impunity while you are chewing tobacco. This=

hand on to her chum.  "Not home letters--yours are sacred, Mummie darling!-=
-and she wouldn't=20

care to hear about Aunt Doreen's attack of rheumatism. There are two post-c=
ards she may like,=20

and this lovely long stave from Dona. Lorna, dear! I've told you about my c=
ousin Dona Anderson?=20

She's at Brackenfield College. She's older than I am, but somehow we've alw=
ays been such=20

friends. I like her far and away the best out of that family. She doesn't f=
ind time to write very often,=20

because she's in the Sixth and a prefect, and it keeps her busy, and beside=
s she never has been=20

much of a scribbler. I haven't heard from her for months. This is ever such=
 a jolly letter, though, if=20

you care to look at it."  "Thanks," said Lorna, accepting the offer. "Yes, =
I remember you told me=20

about her. She must be rather a sport. I wish she were at the Villa Camelli=
a instead of in England."=20

"And Dona thinks there isn't any other school in the world except hers." an=

ery uncertain results=20

from an electric eel which had been brought to us alive, but much enfeebled=
, we repaired to the=20

Cano de Bera, to make our experiments in the open air, and at the edge of t=
he water. We set off=20

on the 19th of March, at a very early hour, for the village of Rastro; then=
ce we were conducted by=20

the Indians to a stream, which, in the time of drought, forms a basin of mu=
ddy water, surrounded=20

by fine trees,* (* Amyris lateriflora, A. coriacea, Laurus pichurin. Myroxy=
lon secundum, Malpighia=20

reticulata.) the clusia, the amyris, and the mimosa with fragrant flowers. =
To catch the gymnoti with=20

nets is very difficult, on account of the extreme agility of the fish, whic=
h bury themselves in the=20

mud. We would not employ the barbasco,=20

But Lorna had opened the closely-written sheets and was already reading as =
follows:           St.=20

Githa's,          Brackenfield College,          March 30th.           Reni=
e dear!           I've been meaning=20

to write to you for ages! Mother          told me the news of how you all p=
acked off to          Naples,=20

and she sent me the address of your school.          I do hope you like it =
and have settled down. I=20

always wanted you to come to Brackenfield! You know   of the Piscidea erith=

therefore told us that=20

they would "fish with horses," (embarbascar con caballos.* (* Meaning to ex=
