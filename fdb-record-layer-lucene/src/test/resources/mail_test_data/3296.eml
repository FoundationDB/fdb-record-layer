limited. Our physical senses cannot take cognizance of vibrations above and below the septenary 

and limited gradations of the prismatic colours, for such vibrations are incapable of causing in us 

the sensation of colour or sound. It will always be the graduated septenary and no more, unless 

we learn to paralyze our Quaternary and discern both the superior and inferior vibrations with our 

spiritual senses seated in the upper Triangle.  Now, on this plane of illusion, there are three 

fundamental colours, as demonstrated by Physical Science, Red, Blue and Yellow (or rather 

Orange- Yellow). Expressed in terms of the human principles they are: (1) Kama Rupa, the seat of 

the animal sensations, welded to, and serving as a vehicle for the Animal Soul or Lower Manas 

(Red and Green, as said, being interchangeable); (2) Auric Envelope, or the essence of man; and 

(3) Prana, or Life Principle. But if from the realm of illusion, or the living man as he is on our Earth, 

subject to his sensuous perceptions only, we pass to that of semi-illusion, and observe the natural 

colours themselves, or those of the principles, that is, if we try to find out which are those that in 

the perfect man absorb all others, we shall find that the colours correspond and become 

complementary in the following way:               Violet. (1) Red               Green. (2) Orange 

Blue. (3) Yellow            Indigo.              Violet.  A faint violet, mist-like form represents the Astral 

Man within an oviform bluish circle, over which radiate in ceaseless vibrations the prismatic 

colours. That colour is predominant, of which the corresponding principle is the most active 

generally, or at the particular moment when the clairvoyant perceives it. Such man appears during 

his waking states; and it is by the predominance of this or that colour, and by the intensity of its 

vibrations, that a clairvoyant, _if_ he be acquainted with correspondences, can judge of the inner 

state or character of a person, for the latter is an open book to every practical Occultist.  In the 

trance state the Aura changes entirely, the seven prismatic colours being no longer discernible. In 

sleep also they are not all "at home." For those which belong to the spiritual elements in the man, 

_viz._, Yellow, Buddhi; Indigo, Higher Manas; and the Blue of the Auric Envelope will be either 

hardly discernible, or altogether missing. The Spiritual Man is free during sleep, and though his 

physical memory may not become aware of it, lives, robed in his highest essence, in realms on 

other planes, in realms which are the land of reality, called dreams on our plane of illusion.  A 

good clairvoyant, moreover, if he had an opportunity of seeing a Yogi in the trance state and a 

mesmerized subject, side by side, would learn an important lesson in Occultism. He would learn to 

know the difference between self-induced trance and a hypnotic state resulting from extraneous 

influence. In the Yogi, the "principles" of the lower Quaternary disappear entirely. Neither Red, 

Green, Red-Violet nor the Auric Blue of the Body are to be seen; nothing but hardly perceptible 

vibrations of the golden- hued Prana principle and a violet flame streaked with gold rushing 

upwards from the head, in the region where the Third Eye rests, and culminating in a point. If the 

student remembers that the true Violet, or the extreme end of the spectrum, is no compound 

colour of Red and Blue, but a homogeneous colour with vibrations seven times more rapid than 

those of the Red,(815) and that the golden hue is the essence of the three yellow hues from 

Orange Red to Yellow-Orange and Yellow, he will understand the reason why: he lives in his own 

Auric Body, now become the vehicle of Buddhi-Manas. On  "To give ten francs to this honest 

fellow," replied Raoul, taking a pistole from his pocket.  "Ten kicks on his back!" said D'Artagnan; 

"be off, you little villain, and forget not that I have your address."  Friquet, who did not expect to be 

let off so cheaply, bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine, and disappeared. 



Raoul mounted his horse, and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne.  D'Artagnan 

watched over the youth as if he had been his own son.  They arrived without accident at the Hotel 

de la Chevrette.  The handsome Madeleine announced to D'Artagnan that Planchet had returned, 

bringing Mousqueton with him, who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well 

as his state would permit.  D'Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned, but he had 

disappeared.  "Then bring some wine," said D'Artagnan. "You are much pleased with yourself," 

said he to Raoul when they were alone, "are you not?"  "Well, yes," replied Raoul. "It seems to me 

I did my duty. I defended the king."  "And who told you to defend the king?"  "The Comte de la 

Fere himself."  "Yes, the king; but to-day you have not fought for the king, you have fought for 

Mazarin; which is not quite the same thing."  "But you yourself?"  "Oh, for me; that is another 

matter. I obey my captain's orders. As for you, your captain is the prince, understand that rightly; 

you have no other. But has one ever seen such a wild fellow," continued he, "making himself a 

Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel! Breathe not a word of that, or the Comte de la Fere will 

be furious."  "You think the count will be angry with me?"  "Think it? I'm certain of it; were it not for 

that, I should thank you, for you have worked for us. However, I scold you instead of him, and in 

his place; the storm will blow over more easily, believe me. And moreover, my dear child," 

continued D'Artagnan, "I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian."  "I do 

not understand you, sir," said Raoul.  D'Artagnan rose, and taking a letter from his writing-desk, 

presented it to Raoul. The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the 

paper.  "Oh, mon Dieu!" he said, raising his fine eyes to D'Artagnan, moist with tears, "the count 

has left Paris without seeing me?"  "He left four days ago," said D'Artagnan.  "But this letter seems 

to intimate that he is about to incur danger, perhaps death."  "He--he--incur danger of death! No, 

be not anxious; he is traveling on business and will return ere long. I hope you have no 

repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim."  "Oh, no, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said 

Raoul, "you are such a brave gentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you!" 

"Eh! Egad! love me too; I will not torment you much, but only on condition that you become a 

Frondist, my young friend, and a hearty Frondist, too."  "But can I continue to visit Madame de 

Chevreuse?"  "I should say you could! and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville; and if the 

worthy Broussel were there, whom you so stupidly helped arrest, I should tell you to excuse 

yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks."  "Well, sir, I will obey you, although I do not 

understand you."  "It is unnecessary for you to understand. Hold," continued D'Artagnan, turning 

toward the door, which had just opened, "here is Monsieur du Vallon, who comes with his coat 

torn."  "Yes, but in exchange," said Porthos, covered with perspiration and soiled by dust, "in 

exchange, I have torn many skins. Those wretches wanted to take away my sword! Deuce take 

'em, what a popular commotion!" continued the giant, in his quiet manner; "but I knocked down 

more than twenty with the hilt of Balizarde. A draught of 


_
mesmeric trance, an effect of unconscious when not of conscious Black Magic, unless produced 

by a high Adept, the whole set of the principles will be present, with the Higher Manas paralyzed, 

Buddhi severed from it through that paralysis, and the red-violet Astral Body entirely subjected to 

the Lower Manas and Kama Rupa (the green and red animal monsters in us).  One who 

comprehends well the above explanations will readily see how important it is for every student, 

whether he is striving for practical Occult powers or only for the purely psychic and spiritual gifts of 

clairvoyance and metaphysical knowledge, to master thoroughly the right correspondences 

between the human, or nature principles, and those of Kosmos. It is ignorance which leads 

materialistic Science to deny the inner man and his Divine powers; knowledge and personal 

experience that allow the Occultist to affirm that such powers are as natural to man as swimming 

to fishes. It is like a Laplander, in all sincerity, denying the possibility of the catgut, strung loosely 

on the sounding-board of a violin producing comprehensive sounds or melody. Our principles are 

the Seven-Stringed Lyre of Apollo, truly. In this our age, when oblivion has shrouded ancient 

knowledge, men's faculties are no better than the loose strings of the violin to the Laplander. But 

the Occultist who knows how  "Oh, I'll answer for you," said the Gascon, filling Porthos's glass to 

the brim; "but when you have drunk, give me your opinion."  "Upon what?" asked Porthos.  "Look 

here," resumed D'Artagnan; "here is Monsieur de Bragelonne, who determined at all risks to aid 

the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de 

Comminges."  "The devil!" said Porthos; "and his guardian, what would he have said to that?"  "Do 

you hear?" interrupted D'Artagnan; "become a Frondist, my friend, belong to the Fronde, and 

remember that I fill the count's place in everything;" and he jingled his money.  "Will you come?" 

said he to Porthos.  "Where?" asked Porthos, filling a second glass of wine.  "To present our 

respects to the cardinal."  Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he 

had imbibed the first, took his beaver and followed D'Artagnan. As for Raoul, he remained 

bewildered with what he had seen, having been forbidden by D'Artagnan to leave the room until 

the tumult was over.     45. The Beggar of St. Eustache.   D'Artagnan had calculated that in not 

going at once to the Palais Royal he would give Comminges time to arrive before him, and 

consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he, D'Artagnan, 

and his friend had rendered to the queen's party in the morning.  They 


_
tighten them and tune his violin in harmony with the vibrations of colour and sound, will extract 

divine harmony from them. The combination of these powers and the attuning of the Microcosm 

and the Macrocosm will give the geometrical equivalent of the invocation "_Om Mani Padme 

Hum_."  This was why the previous knowledge of music and compliments, and announced that 

they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired, namely, D'Artagnan his 

captaincy, Porthos his barony.  D'Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine 

talk, for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform. But, though he 

held the cardinal's
