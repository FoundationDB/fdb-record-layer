you; the wretch is dying, and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him. I 

cannot resist doing so; he must live."  "Zounds!" replied D'Artagnan, "why don't you give yourself 

up directly, feet and hands bound, to that wretch? Ah! Comte de la Fere, you wish to perish by his
