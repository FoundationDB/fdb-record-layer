philodendron monstera is clear that the publisher at least knows that the a=

acter, and very nearly four times as old as the bride he claimed, affirmed =
that _
to aid us in practical remedies. Indeed, to have a literary ambition as we =
contemplate another=E2=80=99s=20

misery, would seem possible only for a fiend; it is in the merit of Mrs. St=
owe=E2=80=99s story of Uncle Tom=20

that the book seems a protest from the soul rather than a work of art. If t=
here are sins and=20

misfortunes, it may be necessary to spread the news, as though the house we=
re on fire, but if we=20

really care for our house we shall not linger to enjoy the cadence of the t=
hrilling call. On the other=20

hand, if we are to lose ourselves in a book or a play, if we are to live in=
 it repeatedly, ourselves the=20

hero, in love with the heroine, and hating the villain, then the book or pl=
ay must give us an=20

experience in some sense better than the life ordinarily available to us; w=
ho would waste a=20

moment on Cleopatra in a book, if he knew where to find her in the world? O=
r perhaps in life she=20

was less charming than Plutarch said she was, or than Shakespeare showed he=
r to be; perhaps=20

we could not be drawn irresistibly to her until the poet made her better th=
an she was=E2=80=94made her,=20

that is, a character proper for the literature which is to be enjoyed as ar=
t.   II  The effect of the=20

excellence or the inferiority of the character on the book was long ago obs=
erved by Aristotle, when=20

he said that tragedy and the epic=E2=80=94that is, all serious literature=
=E2=80=94will aim at representing men as=20

better than in actual life, and that comedy and satire will represent them =
as worse. In this second=20

kind of writing, he added, satire came first, and it was Homer who laid dow=
n the principles of=20

comedy, by dramatizing the ludicrous instead of composing personal satire. =
This famous=20

observation of the ancient critic has been too often read as doctrine, as t=
hough Aristotle were=20

telling us what should take place in literature, whereas he is recording wh=
at actually does take=20

place. If you wish to write a story or a play in which the reader can lose =
himself with delight, you=20

must portray character better than the reader, character which in some degr=
ee satisfies and=20

strengthens his aspirations. If you wish the reader to laugh at the world, =
or to scorn it, or to feel the=20

need of improving it, you portray for him character in a condition inferior=
 to his estimate of himself;=20

if you wish him to profit by that wholesome self-observation which we call =
the comic-spirit, you=20

mingle satire with tragedy=E2=80=94you show him character which satisfies h=
is aspirations, so that he will=20

identify himself with it, and which at the same time is inferior in some re=
spects to what he would=20

prefer to be, so that he must laugh at himself. He will have a tendency to =
save the day for self-

respect by laughing, not at himself, but at human nature, and the universal=
 comic spirit will then=20

have come to birth, akin to both satire and tragedy, but more nearly a dram=
atizing of the ludicrous,=20

as Aristotle said, than a scoring of personal faults.  These principles, it=
 goes without saying, are=20

not accepted by writers today; the average author is not aware of them, or =
if he is, he takes refuge=20

in another remark of Aristotle=E2=80=99s, that perhaps tragedy was destined=
 to develop into something=20

different from the type of poetry produced by =C3=86schylus, Sophocles and =
Euripides; perhaps new=20

principles, we say, in the too familiar formula, are needed for new materia=
l. So think many of our=20

poets and novelists who give us sordid and wretched characters to contempla=
te, yet invite us to=20

feel toward them not the satiric regret, but the old pity and terror of nob=
le tragedy. That the=20

principles do persist, however, very much as Aristotle described them, is e=
videnced by the=20

difficulty the readers still have with such books; the authors argue their =
case, or critics argue it for=20

them, but common humanity remains unconvinced that misery is a proper subje=
ct for permanent=20

contemplation. In our age especially, when the impulse to social good works=
 is highly developed, it=20

is a curious paradox that writers should expect us to associate in art, as =
habitual companions, with=20

types of character which in real life we should hasten to rescue and to cha=
nge. It is generous of=20



the writers to suppose that in a humane age the reader will be ready to dis=
cern the heroic even=20

beneath handicaps and afflictions, and probably the reader is thus ready, b=
ut the writers forget that=20

in any age, particularly in a humane one, we do not like to contemplate, in=
 the permanence of art,=20

heroic character smothered beneath handicaps and afflictions. And in comfor=
t in all this for Louis;=20

and while he was still hesitating in Paris, Anne sent a troop of men-at-arm=
s to arrest him. A hasty=20

flight alone saved him, and he at once repaired to Alencon, where the duke =
received him as a=20

friend in distress; while Anne, hastening back to Paris, deprived Orleans a=
nd his accomplices of=20

their honors and military commands.  The forces of the discontented princes=
 would have been=20

superior to those at the disposal of Anne, if they could have been brought =
together; but their=20

domains were scattered, and they themselves were vacillating, jealous of ea=
ch other, reluctant to=20

resort at once to foreign aid. With her usual promptness, Anne intercepted =
their communications,=20

seized and executed summarily their spies, and herself negotiated with Brit=
tany and with the=20

Flemish towns; while Dunois and Orleans were surprised and captured in Beau=
gency by La=20

Tremoille, commanding for Anne. For the moment, the rebellion had been put =
down without=20

serious loss. Dunois was exiled to Asti, and Louis of Orleans, who had not =
even been able to win=20

the support of his own city, came back to court in October, 1485.  A new da=
nger, however,=20

threatened Anne's supremacy during the next spring, when Maximilian of Aust=
ria, now titular King=20

of the Romans, invaded Artois. Jubilant at the prospect of securing such an=
 ally against Madame=20

la Grande, a new league of the great nobles signed a secret treaty with Max=
imilian in December.=20

With the Dukes of Orleans, Brittany, Lorraine, and Bourbon, the Counts of D=
unois, Nevers,=20

Angouleme, and a host of others thus leagued against her, the situation of =
Madame de Beaujeu=20

was most precarious. Besides actual warfare, she had to fear continual plot=
s having for their object=20

the capture of the young king. The great Philippe de Comines, along with Lo=
uis d'Orleans, was=20

implicated in one of these plots, and was seized by the watchful Anne, whil=
e Louis fled to Brittany=20

and urged its duke to invade France.  Anne did not hesitate as to her cours=
e, but marched into=20

southern France, taking the king, the warrant of her authority, with her. T=
his sudden diversion=20

disconcerted the nobles, and one town after another opened its gates to Cha=
rles VIII., till, in=20

March, 1487, he entered Bordeaux in triumph, and the old Duke of Bourbon an=
d the Count of=20

Angouleme made their submission. The Breton nobles, angry at the interferen=
ce in their affairs by=20

the rebellious French princes, who had completely won the confidence of the=
 weak Duke Francois=20

II., resolved to expel the foreigners, and appealed to Anne to help them. S=
he responded by=20

despatching a force of twelve thousand men into Brittany and besieging the =
duke and Louis=20

d'Orleans in Nantes. But the town having received reinforcements from Maxim=
ilian, the royal army=20

raised the siege and occupied strategic points in Brittany. While the seaso=
n forbade military=20

operations, Anne returned to Paris with her king, and had resort to law in =
her contest with the=20

rebels. She issued a summons to the Dukes of Orleans and Brittany to appear=
 before the court of=20

Parliament. Upon their failure to appear, however, another summons was issu=
ed; but no sentence=20

was passed, since Anne did not care to push matters to extremes in the case=
 of these great=20

personages, whom she hoped to conciliate; but Dunois, Comines, and others o=
f the rebels were=20

condemned for contumacy, their goods were confiscated, and, if their person=
s could be laid hold=20

of, they were imprisoned. Comines, historian and scholar as he was, and fav=
orite of Louis XI, had=20

a taste of imprisonment in one of those famous iron cages of which his old =
master had been so=20



fond.  In the spring of 1488 the power of the house of Beaujeu was increase=
d by the death of the=20

Duke of Bourbon, to whose duchy Anne's husband was heir. Nevertheless, fort=
une was not=20

favoring Anne in all things; for the Breton nobles, having repented of thei=
r rebellion against their=20

own duke, and beginning to suspect that Madame Anne meant to keep her troop=
s in Brittany, now=20

changed sides, and expelled the French garrisons from some of the towns. In=
 retaliation, Anne's=20

general, Louis de La Tremoille, began a vigorous campaign in Brittany early=
 in April, which=20

culminated in the decisive victory of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (July 27th). T=
he Breton army was=20

completely routed, and the rebel nobles, including Louis d' Orleans and the=
 Prince of Orange, fell=20

into the power of Anne. Louis, her most dangerous enemy, was confined in th=
e tower of=20


_
should be added that often the character is not heroic at all, and the only=
 claim put forth for it is=20

that it might have been attractive if it had not been smothered.  Perhaps i=
t is the influence of=20

Wordsworth that still spreads this confusion in our writing. The effect of =
many of his best known=20

poems has never been wholly satisfactory, not even to his admirers; he drew=
 moral lessons from=20

objects humble or mean, and since his own interest was in the moral lesson,=
 he sometimes was=20

careless of the emotional appeal which the object, left standing as it were=
 in the poem, might make=20

on the reader. In one sense he was not a nature-lover, though he had recour=
se to nature for=20

ethical wisdom; it was only the wisdom he cared about, and we have an unple=
asant impression,=20

which Bourges, where he might meditate, without endangering the public peac=
e, upon the injustice=20

of allowing a woman to govern France. Within a month after the battle, Fran=
cois II., humbly suing=20

for peace to his "sovereign" Charles VIII., signed a treaty in which he pro=
mised to exclude from his=20

court and dukedom the enemies of France, and to negotiate no marriage for h=
is daughters without=20

the advice and consent of Charles. In the name of Charles, as usual, all th=
is was done; but it was=20

really a signal triumph for Anne de Beaujeu. The pride of her Breton advers=
ary was broken, and=20

he did not long survive the treaty; some have declared that he died of chag=
rin at being no longer=20

able to betroth his daughters first to one suitor and then to another. Whet=
her of chagrin or of some=20


_
him injustice, that when he had got a moral idea out of the primrose by the=
 river=E2=80=99s brim, he was=20

through with the primrose for the day. The same impression, unfortunately, =
is made by his=20

portrayal of humble or mean characters. He obviously does not identify his =
better fortunes with=20

their misery, nor does he enter dramatically or imaginatively into their li=
ves; he is content to draw a=20

moral from them, and the reader, in his day and still in ours, is surprised=
 that misery in the picture,=20

having produced a moral, is promptly dropped as though of no further concer=
n. The old leech-

gatherer serves a purpose when his courage against frightful odds cheers up=
 a moodish poet; the=20

old beggar at the door moves us to gratitude that another man=E2=80=99s pov=
erty keeps fresh developed=20

that his eldest daughter, Anne, a girl of not quite twelve, had indeed been=
 promised to three=20

parties simultaneously.  Out of the confused situation in Brittany it was M=
adame de Beaujeu's task=20

to make profit for France. The eldest daughter and heiress of the late duke=
, Anne de Bretagne,=20

was enjoined by the royal council from assuming her title of duchess until =
authorized to do so by=20

the king, who claimed not only the feudal wardship of the heiress of Britta=
ny, but her very coronet=20

itself, under the terms of a treaty between the Crown and certain of the gr=
eat barons of Brittany,=20

including Marshal de Rieux, then guardian of Anne de Bretagne. This treaty,=
 dating from 1484,=20

had recognized the claims of the king as superior to those of the female=20


_
us our springs of charity. Much good this does the leech-gatherer or the be=
ggar! And if there is to=20

be no help for them, their presence is a bit disturbing in the background o=
f so much complacence.=20

We wish there were more tenderness in these poems that talk so much of feel=
ing. And when=20

Wordsworth deliberately sets out to enlist our admiration for the heroic, w=
e may find ourselves=20

facing such dumb human misery as we have in enforce the _Loi Salique_. But =
Marshal de Rieux=20

and his friends had now changed their views, seeing that the pretensions of=
 the crown would result=20

in the extinction of Brittany as a distinct and independent province; they =
preferred governing the=20

province through the young duchess to being governed by Madame la Grande.  =
Madame la=20

Grande was well aware that her claims on behalf of the king would not be pe=
aceably admitted; she=20

was=20


_
With relief we turn to the passages in the _Prelude_ where the poet no long=
er looks down benignly=20

on the wretched, but gives expression to the ideal life which he himself de=
sires to attain; there,=20

where he shows life better than it is, we can go with him and lose ourselve=
s in the vision.  It is our=20

poets who chiefly defy Aristotle=E2=80=99s wise warning, and try with Words=
worth to convert into a theme=20

for meditation what is really a subject for philanthropy. Our novelists ten=
d more and more to give=20

us an inferior world, but not for our admiration; we may smile at it, or de=
spise it, or try to cure it.=20

This is satire, an achievement in morals rather than in art, and from resis=
tance, and probably=20

foresaw her opportunity in the quarrels that would inevitably break out amo=
ng the Bretons as to=20

who was to control the heiress, and, above all, as to who was to marry her.=
 The ducal court of=20

Brittany soon became the hotbed of intrigue, where divided counsel prevaile=
d, and where alliances=20

were made on all sides and adhered to on none. With the aid of Maximilian, =
of the Spaniards, and=20

of the English,--all of whom were more or less concerned, and more or less =
willing to support=20

Brittany against France,--the Bretons could have offered successful resista=
nce to the French=20

armies. But the jealousies of the Breton nobles, the craft and ability of=
