unusually severe winter, even for Northern Aroostook. Snow-fall had succeeded snow-fall, with no 

interval that could really be called "thaw," till the "loggers" had finished their work; and as they 

come plodding home on snow shoes, they all agreed that the snow lay from ten to twelve feet 

deep on a level in the woods.  No wonder, then, that the warm March sun came to shine upon it 

day after day, and the copious spring showers fell, there should have been a very unusual "flood," 

or freshet. Every one predicted that when the ice should break in the river, there would be a grand 

spectacle, and danger, too, as well; and all waited with some anxiety for the "break" to come.  One 

morning, we at the village were awakened by a deep, roaring, booming, crashing noise, and 

sprang from our beds, crying:  "The ice has broken up! The ice is running out!"  In hardly more 

time than it takes to tell it, we were dressed and at the back windows, which looked down upon the 

river!  It was indeed a grand sight!  Huge cakes of ice of every shape and size were driving, 

tumbling, crashing past, as if in a mad race with each other. The river, filled to overflowing, 

seemed in angry haste to hurl its icy burden down the falls below.  But after a few days the river 

ran clear, save for the occasional breaking of some "jam" above. Along the margin of the broad 

stream, however, there were here and there slight indentures, or notches, in 4 inches across, are 

common in it; and one specimen of a beautiful blue feldspar, the fragment only of a crystal, 

measured in one direction 8 inches.  Two circumstances in this range give it an interest in the eye 

of a geologist. The one is its proximity to sandstone and puddingstone; and the other, its small 

elevation in comparison with the surrounding rocks of later formations. In some places no other 

rock could be found lying between the granite and puddingstone; though the soil prevented my 

observing whether there is an actual contact. But in general there is a stratum of mica slate a few 

rods wide between these rocks, and not unfrequently gneiss lies between the mica slate and 

granite.  Standing on this range in Leverett, you have on the west, at about 100 rods distant, a 

precipitous mountain of sandstone and puddingstone, five or six hundred feet higher than the 

granite. On the east, a mile or two distant, a mountain of sienite gradually rises to a still greater 

height than the puddingstone; and on the southwest, at nearly the same distance, you can see an 

alluvial formation. In general this granite does not rise so high as the adjacent rocks, whether 

secondary or primitive.   VEINS OF ORE IN THIS GRANITE.  1. _Of Galena in Leverett._  This ore 



forms a narrow vein in the southwest part of the town, on land of Moses Smith, two miles from the 

Congregational meeting-house. The direction of the vein is nearly north and south, and where I 

saw it, only a foot wide. The gangue is sulphate of barytes.  2. _Of Galena, Copper Pyrites, and 

Blende._  This vein is a little more than a mile north of the one above described, and it may be a 

continuation of the same vein. The gangue is nearly an equal admixture of sulphate of barytes and 

quartz; and galena and sulphuret of copper are disseminated through it in about the same, that is, 

equal proportions. The blende, which is of a yellowish aspect when the fractured crystal is held in 

a certain position, appears only occasionally. This vein is several feet wide, has been wrought to a 

small extent in two places, and its direction is nearly north and south. It is on land of Mr. Field. 

_Radiated quartz._ In the above vein. A considerable tendency to crystallization appears at this 

place, not only in the quartz, but in the foliated structure of the barytes.  _Brown spar._ In the 

same place. But little of this mineral was noticed. It exfoliated before the blowpipe, turned black, 

and became magnetic.   3. _Of Specular Oxide of Iron in Montague._  This is found in a partially 

detached eminence, 100 feet high, near the north line of Montague, on land of Mr. Taft, a little 

southwest from the confluence of Miller's river with the 


_
banks, where the ice had escaped the mad rush of waters and still clung in considerable patches. 

It was upon one of these still undisturbed patches that "Jule" Fisher, a rough boy of fourteen, with 

several of his equally rough comrades, was playing on the lovely morning upon which my story 

opens.  These lads were not the sons of the steady, intelligent, church-going inhabitants of this 

quiet Northern hamlet, but were from the families of "lumbermen," "river-drivers" and "shingle-

shavers." For some time they had been having boisterous sport, venturing out upon the extreme 

edges of the ice and with long poles pushing about the stray cakes which occasionally came within 

their reach.  At length they grew tired of this, and began to jump upon ticklish points of ice; and as 

these began to crack and show signs of breaking away, the boys would run, with wild whoops, 

back to shore, the very danger seeming to add to their enjoyment. Then, with poles and "prys," 

they would work upon the cracking mass until it floated clear and went whirling down the rapid 

current.  "Ahoy, boys!" called Jule, who was seemingly their leader. "Up yender's a big cake that 

only wants a shove! Come on! Let's set 'er a-going!"  No sooner said than done. Away went the 

noisy fellows to the projecting point of ice. A few smart jumps sent it creaking and groaning, as 

though still unwilling to quit its snug winter bed. One more jump, and the boys all ran with a shout 

beyond the place where the ice was cracking off--all save Jule.  It had not broken clear, and he 

was determined to set it going, when he would spring on the firm ice beyond, as he had done once 

or twice before.  But this time he was over-bold and not sufficiently watchful. A large cake of ice 

had come floating down the river unnoticed either by him or his friends, and striking the edge of 

the nearly loosened mass, shoved it out into the swift, black water.  Poor Jule! He ran quickly to 

the freshly-broken edge--but, alas! too late for the intended spring. The swiftly-rushing current had 

borne him many yards from the shore and from his companions.  There he stood--for an instant in 

dumb amaze--balancing himself upon his rocking raft with the pole he had been using. To attempt 

to swim ashore would have been useless. He was a clumsy swimmer at best; and the cold, 

rushing waters and floating ice cakes made swimming almost impossible.  He could not get off. To 

stay seemed sure death. Dumb with fright, for a moment he stood in speechless terror. Then there 

rang across the wild, black river and through the quiet streets of the village, such a yell of abject 

fear as only a lusty lad of that age can give. It was a cry that chilled the heart of every one who 

heard it.  A "four-days' meeting" was in session. The village church-goers were just issuing from 

their houses in answer to the church bell, when that pitiful cry and the shouts of "Help! Help! A boy 

in the stream!" reached them, and drew them all quickly to the river bank.  In a few minutes the 

shore was lined with excited men and women. Yet all stood helplessly staring, while poor Jule on 

his ice-raft was floating steadily down toward the falls.  Never shall I forget how he looked as he 

stood there in the middle of his floating white throne! There was something almost heroic in his 

calm helplessness. For after the first wild cry, he had not once opened his lips.  Downward he 

floated, drawn swiftly and surely on by the deep, mighty rush of waters setting into the throat of the 

cataract. The heavy roar from far below sounded like the luckless lad's knell. He stood but a single 

chance--and that was hardly a chance--of his ice-raft lodging against a tilted-up "jam" of cakes and 

logs which had piled against a jagged ledge that rose in mid-stream, just above the brink of the 

precipice.  This "jam" had hung there, wavering in the flood, for thirty-six hours. Every moment it 

seemed about to go off--yet still it clung, in tremor, as it seemed, at the fatal plunge which would 

dash it to pieces in the thundering maelstrom below.  Good fortune--Providence, perhaps--so 



guided Jule's ice-raft that it struck and lodged against the "jam," just as the horrified watchers on 

shore expected to whole hill, not less than 100 rods in circumference at its base, is traversed by 

numerous veins of this ore; and scarcely a foot of the rock is to be seen that does not contain 

these, varying in width from a mere line to several inches. The principal vein appears on the top of 

the hill; and is, as nearly as I could determine, not less than ten feet wide, lying in a north and 

south direction. The ore seems to be abundant, and generally pure. Masses, that have been 

separated by blasting, and weighing from 100 to 200 pounds, lie on the surface. A small proportion 

of sulphuret of iron was observed in some specimens. The gangue is quartz, and the walls and hill 

granite.  No opinion is here intended to be offered concerning the probable value of these ores, if 

worked. If they be useless to the present generation, they may not be so to some future one, when 

labour shall be cheaper; and therefore it was thought to be of some consequence to point out their 

localities.  In the remarks, to which this paper is a supplement, _blue quartz_ was inadvertently put 

down among the minerals found in Deerfield. I presume it does not exist there. It is also probable 

that the variety of garnets found in Conway, is not, as formerly stated, the melanite.   7. _New 

Process for Tanning._  A process for effecting the tanning of leather in a neat, expeditious, and 

thorough manner, has been discovered by a Mr. Steel, of Connecticut: some account of it may be 

given hereafter.   8. _Connexion between Chemistry and Medicine._  This subject has been 

discussed in an able and interesting manner by Professor Cooper, of Philadelphia, in a public 

discourse, which has now been some months before the public.   9. _Brucite._  A new Species in 

Mineralogy, discovered by the late Dr. Bruce. We hope to publish in the next Number a description 

and analysis of it.   10. _Lithography._  We are promised for our next Number, a full account of this 

art, of which we have received a beautiful specimen, _A Minerva_, executed by Mr. Bates Otis, an 

ingenious and enterprising artist of Philadelphia, who, under the patronage of Dr. Samuel Brown, 

is preparing to disseminate the productions of his skill, and to make this important art (executed 

with American materials,) extensively useful in this country.   N. B. As this number has already 

much exceeded its proper size, we are obliged to suppress many articles of domestic, and all 

those of foreign intelligence.     CONCLUSION.   In the prospectus of this work, the expectation 

was expressed that each Number would contain from 64 to 80 pages; that as many as four 

Numbers might be issued within the year, and engravings were promised for such subjects as 

might require them.  The Numbers published, have actually contained from 104 to 132 pages, the 

four have been issued within a period of ten months, and twelve copper-plate engravings and 

several woodcuts, illustrate the present volume.  Of the subjects proposed in the plan of the work, 

our pages contain notices, more or less extensive, of Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, Zoology, 

Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, Useful Arts, Fine Arts, Inventions, Reviews, 

Biography, and Intelligence. How far then we have redeemed our pledge, we leave it for our 

readers to decide.  In the commencement of an enterprise, for the first time attempted in this 

country, an enterprise arduous in its nature and uncertain in its issue, it will not be doubted that 

considerable solicitude was experienced.  To concentrate American efforts in science and the arts, 

by furnishing a Journal to record their proceedings, will, in our view, not only have a direct 

influence in promoting the honour and prosperity of the nation as connected with its physical 

interests, but will also tend in no small degree to nourish an enlarged patriotism, by winning the 

public mind from the odious asperities of party. That entire success will attend our efforts, it would 



perhaps be presumptuous to expect, but we trust that the interesting previous question, whether 

such a work can be adequately sustained, by appropriate materials, may be considered as now 

decided. The support which we have received, and for which we are deeply grateful, has been far 


_
will only hang there!" muttered scores, scarcely daring as yet to speak a loud word.  They could 

see the cake, with Jule on it, heaving up and down with the mighty rhythmic motion of the surging 

torrent; and all ran along down the banks, to come nearer. The boy stood in the very jaws of 

death. Beneath, the cataract roared and hurled up white gusts of spray.  Just at this moment, a 

short, thick-set man, with a round, good-natured face, joined the crowd. For a moment he stood 

looking out at the lad, then slapping another young man on the shoulder, said, hurriedly, "Isn't 

there an old bateau stowed away in your shed, Lanse?"  "Yes," was the reply.  "Quick, then!" 

exclaimed the first speaker. "There isn't a moment to lose."  "But, Mac," answered Lanse, as he 

hurried after him. "I'm afraid she's no good; she's old and she's been stowed away all winter. Ten 

to one the old thing leaks like a riddlin' sieve.  "But we mustn't lose a chance!" exclaimed Mac. 

"That jam will go out within half an hour, if it doesn't within ten minutes!"  By this time the two had 

reached the shed. They quickly drew the bateau from its wintering place, and taking the long, light 

boat upon their shoulders, ran rapidly through the village and down to the river.  Meantime, two or 

three other men had run to fetch "dog warps" and "towing-lines," a large number of which are 

always kept in these backwoods lumbering hamlets, for use on the rivers and lakes, when logs are 

rafted out in the spring.  Acting under Mac's prompt orders, a six-hundred foot warp was at once 

made fast to a ring in the stern of a bateau, and another line laid ready to bend to the first. 

Jumping into the bateau, paddle in hand, and a boat-hook hopes, and has caused us to dispense 

with no small portion of those less important efforts of our own, with which we were prepared to 

succour our infant undertaking.  If we may be allowed to express a wish relative to the nature of 

future communications, it would be, that those of a scientific nature should not be diminished, 

while those relating to the arts, to agriculture, and to domestic economy, should be increased; we 

particularly solicit the communications of practical men, versed in the useful and ornamental arts, 

and they will be acceptable should they not even be clothed in a scientific dress.  Arrangements 

have been made for the reception of an increased number of the best European Journals, both 

from the continent and from Britain; they have already begun to arrive, and we hope to give in 

future numbers, more full details of foreign scientific intelligence, although it is true that this 

species of information has hitherto been stinted, not from poverty of materials, but from the 

pressure of original American communications.         *       *       *       *       *  In justice to the 

publishers of this work, we add, that _this publication is an expensive one_; very heavy advances 

have been already made by them, while only a trivial amount has been received in return. It is 

hoped, therefore, that subscribers will promptly remit, _free from postage_, the small stipulated 

sum, and also make the required advance for the succeeding volume. This last is not due till the 

first number of that volume has been issued, but it would save postage to remit both sums at once, 

and thus also it will be known what subscriptions are continued. In a subscription so widely 

dispersed over a 


_
instant use, the bold young fellow now ordered the men to shove off the skiff into the river and 

then pay out the line, as he should direct--thus lowering him, yard by yard, down toward the "jam" 

where Jule stood.  Rod by rod, they let him down toward the roaring abyss of furious waters, till 

the bateau--guided by the paddle, and held back now by the main strength of twenty men--

touched the ice-cake.  But even as it touched, the cake began to slide off the jam; and Jule was 

thrown on his hands and knees.  Quick as thought, however, his courageous rescuer struck his 

boat-hook into the ice and held fast while Jule, stiff with fright, tumbled in at the bow of the bateau. 

He was hardly in the boat when the whole mass of inattention to _punctual payment_, must soon 

put in hazard the existence of a work, having otherwise the fairest prospects of continuance, and 

we hope of usefulness.  Should this appeal be promptly answered, the first number of the next 

volume (already in considerable forwardness,) will be published in the course of the summer; and 

should men of ability continue to furnish communications, and _the public be willing to pay for the 

work_, it is our wish to publish future numbers with greater frequency, and to complete our 

volumes whenever we are prepared, without confining ourselves to particular periods of time.
