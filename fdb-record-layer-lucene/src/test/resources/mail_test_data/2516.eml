*       *       *       *       *  TALKS ON MANURES  By JOSEPH HARRIS, M. S=
.  Author of "_Walks=20

and Talks on the Farm_," "_Farm Crops_," "_Harris on the Pig_," _etc._  Whi=
le we have no lack of=20

treatises upon artificial fertilizers, there is no work in which the main s=
tay of the farm--the manure=20

made upon the farm is treated so satisfactorily or thoroughly as in this vo=
lume. Starting with the=20

question,  "WHAT IS MANURE?"  the author, well known on both sides of the w=
ater by his=20

writings, runs through in sufficient detail every source of manure on the f=
arm, discussing the=20

methods of making rich manure; the proper keeping and applying it, and espe=
cially the  USES OF=20

MANURE,  and the effects of different artificial fertilizers, as compared w=
ith farm-yard manure,=20

upon different crops. In this he makes free use of the striking series of e=
xperiments instituted years=20

ago, and still continued, by Lawes and Gilbert, of Rothamsted, England. The=
  REMARKABLE=20

TABLES  in which the results of these experiments are given, are here for t=
he first time made=20

accessible to the American farmer. In fact, there is scarcely any point rel=
ating to fertilizing the soil,=20

including suitable manures for special crops, that is not treated, and whil=
e the teachings are=20

founded upon the most elaborate scientific researches, they are so far dive=
sted of the technical=20

language of science as to commend themselves to farmers as eminently "pract=
ical." It is not often=20

that the results of scientific investigations are presented in a manner so =
thoroughly popular. 12mo.=20

*  HOUSE PLANS FOR EVERYBODY.  By S. B. REED, Architect.  One of the most p=
opular=20

Architectural books ever issued, giving a wide range of design from a dwell=
ing costing $250 up to=20

$8,000, and  The same construction will answer for the two remaining cases:=
 for if we suppose=20

that _b_E and _bc_ are two arcs, then will _c_E be their difference, and _z=
r_ the sine of _c_E, as=20

proved above; hence    zr (=3D sin(bE - bc)) =3D  (br =C2=B7 Oz - Or =C2=B7=
 bz)/bO.  But _br_ =3D sin_b_E, and O_r_=20

=3D its cosine; and _bz_ =3D sine _bc_, and O_z_ =3D its cos., hence if _b_=
E be denoted by _a_, _bc_ by=20

_b_, and O_b_ as before, then will    sin(a - b) =3D (sina =C2=B7 cosb - si=
nb =C2=B7 cosa)/r              =3D (if r =3D 1) sina=20

=C2=B7 cosb - sinb =C2=B7 cosa.  Again, AB + BC is the complement of DC or =
_c_E; hence by the first part of=20

the above investigation,    xy =3D sin(AB + BC) =3D coscE:    but xy or sin=
(A + B) =3D cos(a - b) =3D (sinA =C2=B7=20

cosB + sinB =C2=B7 cosA)/r;  and as sinA or AB =3D cosBD =3D cos_b_E, O_x_ =
=3D cosA or AB =3D sinBD =3D=20

sin_b_E, B_y_ =3D _bz_ =3D sin_bc_, and O_y_ =3D O_z_ =3D cos_bc_, we shall=
 have, by substitution,=20

cos(a - b) =3D (cosa =C2=B7 cosb + sina =C2=B7 sinb)/r,              =3D (i=
f r =3D 1) cosa =C2=B7 cosb + sina =C2=B7 sinb.  From what=20

has been said it appears, that if A and B be any two arcs, of which A is th=
e greatest, then    Sin(A=20

=C2=B1 B) =3D (sinA =C2=B7 cosB =C2=B1 sinB =C2=B7 cosA)/r;    Cos(A =C2=B1=
 B) =3D (cosA =C2=B7 cosB  sinA =C2=B7 sinB)/r.  When the radius=20

_r_ is supposed =3D 1, the denominators in these formul=C3=A6 disappear. In=
 the latter, A and B are used=20

for _a_ and _b_, for the sake of homogeneity. The propriety of this is mani=
fest; for as _a_ and _b_=20

denote two indefinite arcs, the same reasoning will apply to A and B, as to=
 _a_ and _b_, the first=20

being supposed in each case the greatest.         *       *       *       *=
