need have any fear; but rather he who makes of the science of       sciences a sinful pretext for 

worldly motives, who should tremble.       The latter will never understand the kabalistic evocations 

of the       supreme initiation.--_Isis Unveiled_, ii. 119.    570 _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 119.    571 See 

_Neo-Platonism_, p. 9.    572 See the Code published by Sir William Jones, Chapter ix. p. 11. 

573 Pliny: _Hist. Nat._, xxx. 1; _Ib._, xvi. 14; xxv. 9, etc.    574 Pomponius ascribes to them the 

knowledge of the highest sciences.    575 Caesar, iii. 14.    576 Pliny, xxx. _Isis Groslow amused 

himself by trying his strength. Well, this man was making signs to another at my left, and turning 

around I recognized the honest Grimaud. 'Oh!' said I to him. Grimaud turned round with a jerk, 

recognized me, and pointed to the man in the mask. 'Eh!' said he, which meant, 'Do you see him?' 

'Parbleu!' I answered, and we perfectly understood one another. Well, everything was finished as 

you know. The mob dispersed. I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman, and we all three 

retired into a corner of the square. I saw the executioner return into the king's room, change his

577 "The care which they took in educating youth, in familiarizing it       with generous and virtuous 

sentiments, did them peculiar honour, and       their maxims and discourses, as recorded by 

historians, prove that       they were expert in matters of philosophy, metaphysics, astronomy, 

morality and religion," says a modern writer. "If kings or princes       desired the advice or the 

blessings of the holy men, they were       either obliged to go themselves, or to send messengers. 

To these men       no secret power of either plant or mineral was unknown. They had       fathomed 

nature to its depths, while psychology and physiology were       to them open books, and the cloak

Athos.  "I should think so, but not without difficulty. Every few minutes he turned around, and thus 

obliged us to conceal ourselves. I might have gone up to him and killed him. But I am not selfish, 

and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter. So we followed him 

through the lowest streets in the city, and in half an hour's time he stopped before a little isolated 

house. Grimaud drew out a pistol. 'Eh?' said he, showing it. I held back his arm. The man in the 

mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key; but before he placed it in the lock he

will have escaped and we shall never find him."  "Come, now, Aramis," said D'Artagnan, "you must 

be taking me for some one else."  "Nevertheless," said Athos, "in your absence----"  "Well, in my
