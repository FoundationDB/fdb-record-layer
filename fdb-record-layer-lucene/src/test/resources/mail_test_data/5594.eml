Principle, the Infinite Potency, born from the concealed Potentiality. This=
 Fire was the primeval=20

cause of the manifested world of being, and was dual, having a manifested a=
nd a concealed, or=20

secret, side.       The secret side of the Fire is concealed in its evident=
 [or     objective] side, and=20

the objective is produced from the secret     side,(796)   he writes, which=
 amounts to saying that=20

the visible is ever present in the invisible, and the invisible in the visi=
ble. This was but a new form=20

of stating Plato's idea of the Intelligible (_Noeton_) and the Sensible (_A=
istheton_), and Aristotle's=20

teaching on the Potency (_Dunamis_) and the Act (_Energeia_). For Simon, al=
l that can be=20

thought of, all that can be acted upon, was perfect intelligence. Fire cont=
ained _all_. And thus all=20

the parts of that Fire, being endowed with intelligence and reason, were su=
sceptible of=20

development by extension and emanation. This is our teaching of the Manifes=
ted Logos, and=20

these parts in their primordial emanation are our Dhyan Chohans, the "Sons =
of Flame and Fire," or=20

higher AEons. This "Fire" is the symbol of the active and companions."  In =
that boat sat three men,=20

unquestionably brave, whose courage no man would have dared dispute; nevert=
heless, at that=20

voice, that accent and those gestures, they felt a chill access of terror c=
ramp their veins. As for=20

Grimaud, his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow.  "Ah!"=
 exclaimed Aramis,=20

"that is the nephew, the monk, and the son of Milady, as he says himself." =
 "Alas, yes," murmured=20

De Winter.  "Then wait," said Aramis; and with the terrible coolness which =
on important occasions=20

he showed, he took one of the muskets from Tony, shouldered and aimed it at=
 the young man,=20

who stood, like the accusing angel, upon the rock.  "Fire!" cried Grimaud, =
unconsciously.  Athos=20

threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was abou=
t to be fired.  "The=20

devil take you," said Aramis. "I had him so well at the point of my gun I s=
hould have sent a ball into=20

his breast."  "It is enough to have killed the mother," said Athos, hoarsel=
y.  "The mother was a=20

wretch, who struck at us all and at those dear to us."  "Yes, but the son h=
as done us no harm."=20

Grimaud, who had risen to=20


_
Nature. Behind it lay "infinite Potentiality in Potentiality," which Simon =
named "that which has=20

stood, stands and will stand," or permanent stability and personified immut=
ability.  From the=20

Potency of Thought, Divine Ideation thus passed to Action. Hence the series=
 of primordial=20

emanations through Thought begetting the Act, the objective side of Fire be=
ing the Mother, the=20

sacred side hopeless, wringing his hands.  The young man burst into a laugh=
.  "Ah, it is certainly=20

you!" he cried. "I know you even better now."  His mocking laugh and threat=
ening words passed=20

over their heads, carried by the breeze, until lost in the depths of the ho=
rizon. Aramis shuddered.=20

"Be calm," exclaimed Athos, "for Heaven's sake! have we ceased to be men?" =
 "No," said Aramis,=20

"but that=20


_
Father. Simon called these emanations Syzygies (a united pair, or couple), =
for they emanated two-

by-two, one as an active, and the other as a passive AEon. Three couples th=
us emanated (or six=20

in all, the Fire being the seventh), to which Simon gave the following name=
s: "Mind and Thought;=20

Voice and Name; Reason and Reflection,"(797) the first in each pair being m=
ale, the last female.=20

From these primordial six emanated the six AEons of the Middle World. Let u=
s see what Simon=20

himself says:       Each of these six primitive beings contained the entire=
 infinite     Potency [of its=20

parent]; but it was there only in Potency, and not     in Act. whether I wa=
s wrong to rid him of his=20

dear nephew."  De Winter only replied by a groan.  "It was all up with him,=
" continued Aramis; "ah I=20

much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal foll=
y."  Athos took Lord de=20

Winter's hand and tried to turn the conversation.  "When shall we land in E=
ngland?" he asked; but=20

De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply.  "Hold, Athos," s=
aid Aramis, "perhaps=20

there is yet time. See if he is still in the same place."  Athos turned aro=
und with an effort; the sight=20

of the young man was evidently painful to him, and there he still was, in f=
act, on the rock, the=20

beacon=20
