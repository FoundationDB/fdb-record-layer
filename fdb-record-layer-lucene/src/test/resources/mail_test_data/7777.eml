Lopez left neither in slavery nor free.  Not to prolong this letter, I do n=
ot relate many other things to=20

Your Highness.  I likewise beg Your Highness to order some relief that is f=
inal and not indefinite,=20

for the men who were thus left neither slaves nor free: because I do not kn=
ow what relief it can be=20

considered, to leave them neither free nor slaves until they die; for meanw=
hile, they are daily=20

treated worse and worse by those who call them slaves and dogs, because the=
y consider that the=20

licentiate Gregorio Lopez approved of their captivity, etc., tying their ha=
nds the more tightly.  I have=20

seen what I state ever since I came here.  Your Highness would both laugh a=
t and abominate the=20

spice dealers of this city, who barter spices for Indians and for gold (as =
it is they who mostly own=20

them), and their fierceness in making war on the Indians, that makes them t=
o seem like dummy=20

lions, painted.  What I wish Your Highness would do to protect all such Ind=
ians as are left neither=20

slaves or freemen and all who are bound in any way, would be to oblige thei=
r owners to exhibit a=20

receipt of the sale: because it is clear to every one, save to those whose =
perceptions God has=20

allowed to be weakened by their malice, audacity, and ambition, that there =
has never been a war=20

in all the Indies for which there was any real authority given by His Majes=
ty or by his royal=20

predecessors.  The royal instructions on this point have never been heeded,=
 as I have seen and=20

on my conscience affirm, and as all those violaters admit.  Consequently, a=
s there was never just=20

cause, it follows that all the wars were unjust and that no Indians down, a=
nd when the must is=20

drunk the skins are thrown on the dung-hill. Grape-skins, that is what I am=
--but you need not look=20

at me so pitifully; I was grapes once, and poor and despised as I am now, n=
o one can take from=20

me what I have had and have been.  Mine has been a life out of a thousand, =
a complete life, full to=20

overflowing of joy and suffering, of love and hate, of delight, despair, an=
d revenge.  Only to talk of=20

it raises me to a seat by thy throne there.  No, let me be, I am used now t=
o squatting on the=20

ground; but I knew thou wouldst hear me to the end, for once I too was one =
of you.  Extremes=20

meet in all things--I know it by experience.  The greatest men will hold ou=
t a hand to a beautiful=20

woman, and time was when I could lead you all as with a rope.  Shall I begi=
n at the beginning?=20

Well--I seldom am in the mood for it now-a-days.  Fifty years ago I sang a =
song with this voice of=20

mine; an old crow like me? sing!  But so it was.  My father was a man of ra=
nk, the governor of=20

Abydos; when the first Rameses took possession of the throne my father was =
faithful to the house=20

of thy fathers, so the new king sent us all to the gold mines, and there th=
ey all died--my parents,=20

brothers, and sisters.  I only survived by some miracle.  As I was handsome=
 and sang well, a=20

music master took me into his band, brought me to Thebes, and wherever ther=
e was a feast given=20

in any great house, Beki was in request. Of flowers and money and tender lo=
oks I had a plentiful=20

harvest; but I was proud and cold, and the misery of my people had made me =
bitter at an age=20

when usually even bad liquor tastes of honey.  Not one of all=20


_
Spaniards attacked them in time of peace and captured millions of them. Thi=
s being the real truth,=20

Your Highness should order that all such owners be obliged to prove the tit=
le of him who sold any=20

such Indian, and so on back till the first one who stole or treacherously c=
aptured him is unearthed.=20

In the meantime the young fellows, princes' sons, and nobles, dared to touc=
h my hand.  But my=20

hour was to come; the handsomest and noblest man of them all, and grave and=
 dignified too--was=20

Assa, the old Mohar's father, and grandfather of Pentaur--no, I should say =
of Paaker, the pioneer;=20

thou hast known him. Well, wherever I sang, he sat=20
