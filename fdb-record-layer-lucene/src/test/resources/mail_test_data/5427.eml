intensified, and the Aura takes on a stronger vibratory or swinging action. The arc of the pulsation 

of the Pituitary Body mounts upward, more and more, until, just as when the electric current strikes 

some solid object, the current finally strikes the Pineal Gland, and the dormant organ is awakened 

and set all glowing with the pure Akashic Fire. This is the psycho-physiological illustration of two 

"To give your majesty's reply to those who await it."  "Stay, marechal; I will not appear to parley 

with rebels."  "Madame, I have pledged my word, and unless you order me to be arrested I shall 

be forced to return."  Anne of Austria's eyes shot glances of fire.  "Oh! that is no impediment, sir," 

said she; "I have had greater men than you arrested--Guitant!"  Mazarin sprang forward.

which are, respectively, the concrete symbols of the metaphysical concepts called Manas and 

Buddhi. The latter, in order to become conscious on this plane, needs the more differentiated fire 

of Manas; _but once the sixth sense has awakened the seventh_, the light which radiates from this 

seventh sense illumines the fields of infinitude. For a brief space of time man becomes omniscient; 

the Past  "Would it be to give up Broussel, sir? If so, you can spare yourself the trouble."  "No," 

said Mazarin; "although, perhaps, that counsel is as good as any other."  "Then what may it be?" 

"To call for monsieur le coadjuteur."  "The coadjutor!" cried the queen, "that dreadful mischief 

maker! It is he who has raised all this revolt."  "The more reason," said Mazarin; "if he has raised it 

he can

disappear and become for him the Present. If an Adept, he will store the knowledge he thus gains 

in his physical memory, and nothing, save the crime of indulging in Black Magic, can obliterate the 

remembrance of it. If only a Chela, portions alone of the whole truth will impress themselves on his 

memory, and he will have to repeat the process for years, never allowing one speck of impurity to 

stain him mentally or physically, before he becomes a fully initiated Adept.  It may seem strange, 

almost incomprehensible, that the chief success of Gupta Vidya, or Occult Knowledge, should 

depend upon such flashes of clairvoyance, and that the latter should depend in man on two such 

insignificant excrescences in his cranial cavity, "two horny _warts_ covered with grey sand 

(acervulus cerebri)," as expressed by Bichat in his _Anatomie Descriptive_; yet so it is. But this 

sand is not to be despised; nay, in truth, it is only this landmark of the internal, independent activity 

of the Conarium that prevents Physiologists from classifying it with the absolutely useless 

atrophied organs, the relics of a previous and now utterly changed anatomy of man during some 

period of his unknown evolution. This "sand" is very mysterious, and baffles the inquiry of every 

Materialist. In the cavity on the anterior surface of this gland, in young persons, and in its 

substance, in people of advanced years, is found       A yellowish substance, semi-transparent, 

brilliant and hard, the     diameter of which does not exceed half a line.(834)   Such is the 

acervulus cerebri.  This brilliant "sand" is the concretion of the gland itself, so say the down."  "And 

hold, madame," suggested Comminges, who was near a window, out of which he could see; "hold, 

the moment is a happy one, for there he is now, giving his blessing in the square of the Palais 

Royal."  The queen sprang to the window.  "It is true," she said, "the arch hypocrite--see!"  "I see," 

said Mazarin, "that everybody kneels before him, although he be but coadjutor, whilst I, were I in 

his place, though I am cardinal, should be torn to pieces. I persist, then, madame, in my wish" (he 

laid an emphasis on the word), "that your majesty should receive the coadjutor."  "And wherefore 

do you not say, like the rest, your will?" replied the queen, in a low voice.  Mazarin bowed. 

"Monsieur le marechal," said the queen, after a moment's reflection, "go and find the coadjutor and 

bring him to me."  "And what shall I say to the people?"  "That they must have patience," said 

Anne, "as I have."  The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal 

made no reply; he bowed and went out.  (D'Artagnan turned to Porthos. "How will this end?" he 

said.  "We shall soon see," said Porthos, in his tranquil way.)  In the meantime Anne of Austria 

approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone, whilst Mazarin glanced 

uneasily at the corner occupied by D'Artagnan and Porthos. Ere long the door opened and the 

marechal entered, followed by the coadjutor.  "There, madame," he said, "is Monsieur Gondy, who 

hastens to obey your majesty's summons."  The queen advanced a few steps to meet him, and 

then stopped, cold, severe, unmoved, with her lower lip scornfully protruded.  Gondy bowed 

respectfully.

Eastern Occultist calls Devaksha, the "Divine Eye." To this day, it is the chief organ of spirituality in 

the human brain, the seat of genius, the magical Sesame uttered by the purified will of the Mystic, 

which opens all the avenues of truth for him who knows how to use it. The Esoteric Science 

teaches that Manas, the Mind Ego, does not accomplish its full union with the child before he is six 

or seven years of age, before which period, even according to the canon of the Church and Law, 

no child is deemed responsible.(835) Manas becomes a prisoner, one with the body, only at that 

age. Now a strange thing was observed in several thousand cases by the famous German 

anatomist, Wengel. With a few extremely rare exceptions, this "sand," or golden-coloured 

concretion, is found only in subjects after the completion of their seventh year. In the case of fools 

these calculi are very few; in congenital idiots they are completely absent. Morgagni,(836) 

Grading,(837) and Gum(838) were wise men in their generation, and are wise men to-day, since 

they are the only Physiologists, so far, who connect the calculi with mind. For, sum up the facts, 

that they are absent in young children, in very old people, and in idiots, and the unavoidable 

conclusion will be that they must be connected with mind.  Now since every mineral, vegetable 

and other atom is only a concretion of crystallized Spirit, or Akasha, the Universal Soul, why, asks 

Occultism, should the fact that these  "Well, sir," said the queen, "what is your opinion of this riot?" 

"That it is no longer a riot, madame," he replied, "but a revolt."  "The revolt is at the door of those 

who think my people can rebel," cried Anne, unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor, whom she 

looked upon, and probably with reason, as the promoter of the tumult. "Revolt! thus it is called by 

those who have wished for this demonstration and who are, perhaps, the cause of it; but, wait, 

wait! the king's authority will put all this to rights."  "Was it to tell me that, madame," coldly replied 

Gondy, "that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence?"  "No, my dear 

coadjutor," said Mazarin; "it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find 

ourselves."  "Is it true," asked Gondy, feigning astonishment, "that her majesty summoned me to 

ask for my opinion?"  "Yes," said the queen, "it is requested."  The coadjutor bowed.  "Your 

majesty wishes, then----"  "You to say what you would do in her place," Mazarin hastened to reply. 

The coadjutor looked at the queen, who replied by a sign in the affirmative.  "Were I in her 

majesty's place," said Gondy, coldly, "I should not hesitate; I should release Broussel."  "And if I do 

not give him up, what think you will be the result?" exclaimed the queen.  "I believe that not a 

stone in Paris will remain unturned," put in the marechal.  "It was not your opinion that I asked," 

said the queen, sharply, without even

analysis, found to be composed of animal matter, phosphate of lime and carbonate, serve as an 

objection to the statement that they are the result of the work of mental electricity upon 

surrounding matter?  Our seven Chakras are all situated in the head, and it is these Master 

Chakras which govern and rule the seven (for there are seven) principal plexuses in the body, 

besides the forty-two minor ones to which Physiology refuses that name. The fact that no 

microscope can detect such centres on the objective plane  "If it is I whom your majesty 

interrogates," replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner, "I reply that I hold monsieur le 

marechal's opinion in every respect."  The color mounted to the queen's face; her fine blue eyes 

seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips, compared by all the poets of the day to a 

pomegranate in flower, were trembling with anger. Mazarin himself, who was well accustomed to 

the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household, was alarmed.  "Give up Broussel!" she cried;
