accomplished little, but I know that all my efforts and energies, in the pa=
st, present and future, are=20

working together for my good.  Therefore, I shall hold the thought that my =
success has already=20

been achieved. I am Success, I have success now and forever! Therefore, I t=
hink only success; I=20

talk only success; I believe only in success; I am demonstrating success, a=
nd I know that success=20

is mine.  The needed lessons I am having now, have had in the past, and may=
 require in the=20

future, are but necessary stepping stones to my greater success. The appare=
nt delay of my=20

greater success means that I am now demonstrating more success than I could=
 otherwise have.=20

Dreams that I have dreamed, visions that I have visualized, and the goal th=
at I have mapped out,=20

are all a part of my ultimate greater success. I have that now! I am succes=
sful now!  As Moses=20

went into the land of Midian, and spent forty years of his life as a shephe=
rd in the wilderness--

(apparently with no future before him--which, however, was the great school=
ing necessary for his=20

greater triumphant success in the future)--so I may be, in _my_ land of Mid=
ian, apparently, only a=20

sheep herder, but in reality getting the necessary training for my greater =
and ultimate success.=20

Therefore, I now rejoice in every experience I have--giving thanks for ever=
y apparent set back, and=20

for every "seeming" blocking of my purposes and aspirations.  I believe tha=
t my past experiences,=20

as well as present happenings, are for my benefit, and that I could not hav=
e been the great=20

success I am, and shall be, had not the discouragements of yesterday, the p=
erplexities of today=20

and the drawbacks of tomorrow come into my life. I realize that I need to g=
o into the land of=20

Midian; that it is as necessary for me, as it was for Moses, to spend a few=
 years in the wilderness=20

of Life's experience. I am happy to know that I am in such company as that =
of the Great Leader of=20

his people, and rejoice in the thought that the Lord has called me to spend=
 my time in the land of=20

Midian, getting the necessary training for the greater things the Lord has =
in store for me.  There is=20

no place in the world where clouds do not gather, and storms do not rage; b=
ut when the storms=20

abate, and the skies clear, then do we appreciate more fully the glories an=
d beauties of God, the=20

the parlor, on the train or boat, it is the height of ill-breeding to make =
a scene and to threaten a=20

punishment of any kind. Were the child properly trained in private, parents=
 and beholders would be=20

spared the humiliating spectacle that too often confronts them in visiting =
and traveling.         *       *=20

*       *       *  One word here as to the child on train or boat. The pers=
on who is truly well-bred will=20

not turn and frown on the mother of the tiny baby who, suffering with colic=
, or sore from traveling,=20

is wailing aloud. Of course the sound is annoying, but it is harder on the =
poor mortified mother=20

than on any one else. I already hear the question, =E2=80=9CWhy doesn=E2=80=
=99t she keep the infant at home=20

then?=E2=80=9D Frequently she can not do this. The child may be ill, and be=
 on its way to seashore or=20

mountains to gain health; or the mother may be summoned to see some relativ=
e, and can not go=20

unless the baby goes too. Whatever the cause of her going, the fact remains=
 that she derives no=20

pleasure from holding a screaming baby, and her discomfort is turned into p=
ositive anguish by the=20

disgusted looks of the women, and the muttered imprecations of the men.  [S=
idenote: A KINDLY=20

TRAVELER]  I saw once under such circumstances a woman who was an honor to =
her sex.=20

Opposite her in the train sat a young mother, and in her arms was a fretful=
 wailing baby. It was=20

evidently the first baby, and the poor girlish mother was white and weary. =
At every scream the=20

baby gave she would start nervously, change the little one=E2=80=99s positi=
on, look about at the passengers=20

with an expression of pathetic apology,=E2=80=94all the time keeping up a c=
rooning =E2=80=9CSh-h-h!=E2=80=9D that=20

produced no effect on the crying atom of humanity. And, as is often the cas=
e, the more nervous=20



the mother became, the more nervous did the baby grow, and the louder did h=
e scream. An=20

exclamation of impatience came from a woman seated behind the suffering twa=
in, and, at the=20

same moment, a man in front threw down his paper with a slam and rushed out=
 of the car and into=20

the smoker. Then the woman who was an honor to her sex came across from the=
 seat opposite,=20

and laid a gentle hand on the mother=E2=80=99s shoulder, smiling reassuranc=
e in the tear-filled eyes lifted to=20

hers.  [Sidenote: TRUE COURTESY]  =E2=80=9CMy dear,=E2=80=9D said the soft =
voice, =E2=80=9Cyou are worn out, and the=20

baby knows it.=20


_
its natural laws, and Infinite Love.  However, I know by experience in the =
land of Midian, where=20

clouds hover low, and where storms try the soul and body, that the dawn of =
a new day shall make=20

life all the sweeter for me and mine.  Moses could not have enjoyed leading=
 his people into the=20

promised land, had he not been in the land of Midian. If he had stayed fore=
ver in the Court of=20

Pharaoh, with its attendant luxuries, life would have taken on a dull, mono=
tonous hue, and his=20

experience would have seemed drab, wearisome and pale.  I am glad for the p=
rivilege accorded=20

me to be in the land of Midian for a short time! I know that, as did Moses,=
 I shall enjoy my=20

promised land all the more when my greater success shall have been well wor=
ked out by the hand=20

of Divinity.  Faith and conviction in my ultimate greater success is strong=
er today than ever! I hold=20

such a strong thought, and such a deep and courageous faith in the workings=
 of God's plan, that I=20

know I now have that which has been intended for me, and nothing can take f=
rom me that which=20

the Lord hath prepared for my success, health and happiness. I know, too, t=
hat I shall learn daily=20

to enjoy, appreciate, and make better use of the success I now possess; tha=
t I shall unfold day by=20

day into greater opportunities for more influence, power, friendship, chari=
ty, love, comradeship and=20

service. I know that my present success is but a part of the greater succes=
s which the Lord has=20

waiting for me--"just around the corner".  my own, and they are all too big=
 for me to hold in my=20

arms now. I just _long_ to feel that baby against my shoulder! Give him to =
me! There, now! you=20

poor, tired little mother, put your head down on the back of the seat, and =
rest!=E2=80=9D  She took the baby=20

across the aisle, laid him over her shoulder with his head against her chee=
k, in the comforting way=20

known to all baby-lovers, and in three minutes the cries had subsided and t=
he baby was asleep in=20

the strong motherly arms, where he lay until Jersey City was reached. And t=
he tired little mother=20

fell into a light slumber, too, comforted by the appreciation that she was =
not alone, nor an=20

intolerable nuisance to all her fellow passengers.  Was not such an act as =
this woman=E2=80=99s the=20

perfection of true courtesy, the courtesy that forgets itself in trying to =
make another comfortable?=20

[Sidenote: TEACHING GOOD MANNERS]  This same spirit spoken of by Saint Paul=
 as =E2=80=9Cin honor=20

preferring one another=E2=80=9D can be inculcated in the children in our ho=
mes. The small of the human=20

species are, like their elders, naturally selfish, and must be taught consi=
deration for others. It is the=20

grafting that makes the rose what it is. You may graft a Jacqueminot or Mar=
=C3=A9chal Neil upon the=20

stump of the wild rose. The grafting, the pruning, and the training are the=
 work of the careful=20

gardener. The mother can never be idle, for, while the stock is there, she =
does the grafting.=20

Obedience must be taught in small things as well as in great. The tiny chil=
d must be=20


_
shall work harder, being more particular in the preparation for my greater =
work, than I have been in=20

the past--never doubting but that every moment spent in this greater prepar=
ation will bring added=20

interests, and a greater success in the future.  Even as Moses did not doub=
t the wisdom of the=20

Lord for a greater future (when in the land of Midian for forty years), so =
shall I not doubt His ways=20

today.  I claim, with a joyful heart and an attitude of thanksgiving, that =
my life could not have been=20

as great in the future had I been denied my his hand readily in greeting, t=
o say =E2=80=9Cplease=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cthank=20

you=E2=80=9D; not to pass in front of people, or between them and the fire;=
 to say =E2=80=9Cexcuse me!=E2=80=9D when he=20

treads on his mother=E2=80=99s foot or dress; to rise when she enters the r=
oom; and to take off his hat when=20

he kisses her. The mother who insists that her child do these things at hom=
e need not fear that he=20

will forget her training when abroad.     CHAPTER XXXII  OUR NEIGHBORS   TH=
E fact that=20

people live next door to you does not make them your neighbors in the highe=
r and better sense of=20

that word.=20
