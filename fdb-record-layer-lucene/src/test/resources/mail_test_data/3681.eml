brought tears to the eyes of those loyal sons of Ridgley whose faces were t=
urned up toward him=20

where he stood in the bright lights of the platform. A hoarse shout of conf=
idence and satisfaction=20

shook the hall.  Instead of jumping down and returning to his seat, Teeny-b=
its left the platform by=20

the back way and hurried out of the building by the rear door. He wanted to=
 be alone just then. The=20

November night air was cool on his flushed face and he strode swiftly towar=
d his room, thinking of=20

all the things that had happened to him in the few short weeks since he had=
 come to Ridgley and=20

of all the friends he had made. Never had he seen the campus so deserted; e=
very one was at the=20

mass meeting, it seemed. There were lights only in the entries of the dormi=
tories. He took a short=20

cut across the tennis courts and approached Gannett Hall from the rear.  Wh=
en the grayish-white=20

bulk of the building was only twenty-five yards away, Teeny-bits heard a su=
dden sound that=20

caused him to gaze upward. What he saw instantly dispelled from his mind th=
e pleasant thoughts=20

in which he had been absorbed. A window in the third story was open; stretc=
hing downward from it=20

was one of the fire-escape ropes with which each room was equipped. Some on=
e was letting=20

himself downward by sitting in the patent sling and allowing the rope to sl=
ide slowly through his=20

hands. Teeny-bits stepped behind one of the beech trees that grew close to =
the building. While he=20

watched, the person on the rope came down even with the second story. There=
 he paused, resting=20

his feet on the ledge of a window. In a moment he had raised the sash and h=
ad climbed inside.=20

Teeny-bits remained behind the tree, peering upward and wondering if he had=
 hit upon the=20

solution of the mystery of the petty thefts. Inside the room on the second =
floor a dim light shone for=20

a moment and then went out; the thief was using a flashlamp. Teeny-bits' fi=
rst thought was to=20

notify long and parallel ranges of mountains, called the Alleghany; and con=
stitutes one of the most=20

prominent features in the geology of the United States. Its height I cannot=
 determine with=20

accuracy. Probably it would not average more than one thousand feet. Its ba=
se may extend in=20

diameter from one to two miles; and yet such is the influence it has on the=
 climate, that vegetation=20

on the eastern, is usually two weeks earlier than on the western side. And =
what is remarkable, this=20

difference obtains, on the former side at least, until you arrive within a =
few hundred yards of the=20

summit. I crossed the mountain in two places, distant from each other one h=
undred miles, but=20

observed nothing essentially different in their mineralogy. At one of them =
called the _Rockfish-

Gap_, on the road from Charlotteville to Staunton, I spent a few hours, and=
 brought away=20

specimens of all the varieties of minerals which I could find. These have b=
een submitted to your=20

inspection. Among them, you will, I think, see greenstone, epidote, and sla=
te more or less allied to=20

the first. These are the most common rocks, and excepting the second, are u=
sually stratified. The=20

epidote is generally associated with quartz, and sometimes is imbedded in i=
t. In some instances it=20

has a porphyritic appearance, and is very beautiful. In others, it is coate=
d with small filaments of a=20

greenish asbestos. Other minerals were found, whose nature I could not so e=
asily determine. I=20

regret exceedingly, that I cannot furnish you with a more complete descript=
ion of this interesting=20

mountain. That its character is peculiar, or different from the country on =
either side of it, must be=20

obvious to the most superficial observer. Its principal rock does indeed be=
ar a resemblance to the=20

trap or whinstone of Albemarle county, and yet I think you will say it is n=
ot the same. One fact of=20

importance cannot be mistaken; this mountain constitutes the great dividing=
 line=20


_
would do better to observe developments and to stay on watch until the thie=
f should come out.=20

Close to the wall of the building grew some shrubs which seemed to offer a =
better vantage point=20

from which to watch. Teeny-bits stepped quickly among them and crouched dow=
n so that, as seen=20

from above, the dark shadow of his body would seem to be part of the shrubb=
ery. Looking upward=20

he could see any object on the side of the building outlined clearly agains=
t the starlit sky. Two or=20

three minutes after he reached this new place of concealment a foot was thr=
ust out of the second=20

story window above him; some one climbed out and after closing the window b=
egan to clamber=20

swiftly upward, using his and limestone countries. For you no sooner reach =
its western base, than=20

the greenstone and epidote disappear; and _limestone_ pervades the country =
for hundreds of=20

miles in every direction. In all the distance from this mountain to New-Orl=
eans, I did not find a=20

single specimen of granite, or greenstone. This may appear singular, since =
Mr. Maclure and=20

Professor Cleaveland have a granite range on their maps, immediately west o=
f the Blue Ridge;=20

and even that mountain is on those maps, in some parts of it, covered with =
the granitic tinge. This=20

may be true. I can answer for only two points of it, and for that part of t=
he country beyond, lying=20

near the main road to Tennessee. In this route I=20


_
feet against the wall.  Teeny-bits at once recognized the person who was pe=
rforming this=20

suspicious-appearing bit of acrobatics but he was astounded by his discover=
y. The person who=20

was fast making his way upward, who even now had reached the third story an=
d was climbing into=20

the open window, was none other than Snubby Turner, the genial and innocent=
-appearing quarter-

back of the scrub team. In the first place it was almost unbelievable that =
Snubby with his=20

tremendous interest in the approaching football game should be absent from =
the mass meeting; in=20

the second place it seemed even more incredible to Teeny-bits that this fri=
end of his should be=20

guilty of stealing the property of his schoolmates.  The newcomer at Ridgle=
y remained standing in=20

the bushes as if frozen to the spot. He was revolving in his mind many thin=
gs: Snubby's seemingly=20

frank and happy manner, the fact that it was he who had first reported a lo=
ss, his interest in the=20

subsequent thefts. It seemed impossible; and yet here was indisputable evid=
ence that Snubby had=20

chosen a moment when the dormitory was deserted to break into one of the ro=
oms.  Whose room=20

was it, anyway? Teeny-bits, still looking upward, suddenly realized that th=
e room into which=20

Snubby had broken was Tracey Campbell's; confusing thoughts were still swee=
ping through his=20

mind when he became aware that some one who was stepping swiftly along the =
walk that passed=20

close behind the hall was almost upon him. Teeny-bits never knew just why h=
e followed the=20

sudden impulse that came over him. His first thought was that he did not wa=
nt any one to see him=20

standing there in the shrubbery apparently without reason; he started to of=
 the great valley=20

included between the Blue Ridge on the east, and the north mountain on the =
west. But in no=20

instance did I meet with specimens of granite; nor west of the Blue Ridge w=
ith any prevailing rock=20

but limestone. I know of no reason why the Blue Ridge should not be regarde=
d as the first great=20

dividing line between the granite and limestone countries. The change in th=
e geological formation=20

is so sudden and striking, that it would be difficult for the most careless=
 traveller with his eyes=20

open, not to observe it. The face of nature, he cannot but perceive, wears =
a different aspect; the=20

air is more cool and lively; even the water which he drinks possesses new p=
roperties perceptible=20

to his taste. The inhabitants no longer speak of their "sandstone water;" b=
ut every where he hears=20

of "limestone water." Indeed for 800 miles in the direction which I travell=
ed, he tastes no other=20

water. Every spring and every rivulet, is strongly impregnated with carbona=
te of lime. The vessels=20

in which it is prepared for culinary use, soon become lined with a white ca=
lcareous crust. Nor is its=20

taste the only inconvenience experienced by the traveller unaccustomed to i=
t. It often injures the=20

health of a stranger, and covers the surface of the body with cutaneous eru=
ptions.   _Limestone=20

country in inclined Strata._  The geological observer has now entered upon =
a very interesting field.=20

Its great extent, and its wonderful uniformity, give new facilities to inve=
stigation. Two divisions of it=20

seem to have been made in nature.  The _first_ is that which includes the l=
imestone lying in=20

INCLINED STRATA. This division extends from the Blue Ridge, to the Cumberla=
nd=20


_
his quick movement caught the eye of the person who was passing. The footfa=
lls came to a=20

sudden pause, and a voice, which Teeny-bits recognized as that of Mr. Steve=
ns, the English=20

master, called out:  "Who's that?"  With a sinking sensation in the of my r=
oute of 500 miles. Of=20

course it includes all the ranges, five in number, of the Alleghany mountai=
ns. The strata lie in a=20

course northeast and southwest, the same as the general course of the mount=
ains. The angle=20

which they make with the=20
