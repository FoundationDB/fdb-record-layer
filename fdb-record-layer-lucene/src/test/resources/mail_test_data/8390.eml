watching her now, Ethel reflected, "She expects me to be like that. If I'm =
not, she'll be=20

disappointed, ashamed. And why shouldn't I be! What do you ever get in this=
 world if you're=20

always saving every cent? You miss your chance and then it's too late. I'll=
 be meeting her friends=20

in a few weeks more. I've simply got to hurry!" And with Amy's dancing teac=
her she arranged for=20

lessons--at a price that made her gasp. But the lessons were a decided succ=
ess.  "You've a=20

wonderful figure for dancing," the teacher said confidingly, "and a sense f=
or rhythm that most of=20

these women haven't any idea of." He smiled down at her and she fairly beam=
ed.  "Oh, how nice!"=20

sighed No. 25, s. 2, April 24th, 1880).  VIOLATION.=E2=80=94The violation o=

punishable by a fine of from $25 to $200 for every offence (_ib._, s. 9).  =

and a board of hom=C5=93opathic examiners for the State (Rev. Stats., 1892,=

board is composed of three practising physicians of known ability, graduate=
s in good standing of a=20

medical college, recognized by the American Medical Association, residents =
of the circuit; the=20


_
flashed between them gave her a thrill of assurance. And this feeling came =
again and again, in the=20

shops and while she was seated at luncheon in some crowded restaurant, or o=
n the streets or=20

back at home, where even Joe was beginning to show his admiring surprise.  =
"You're making a=20

fine little job of it," she heard him say to Amy one night.  She caught oth=
er remarks and glances=20

from strangers, men and women. And Ethel now began to feel physicians of kn=
own ability,=20

graduates in good standing of a medical college recognized by the American =
Institute of=20

Hom=C5=93opathy (_ib._, s. 802).  QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94It is the duty of =

examine thoroughly every applicant, upon the production of a medical diplom=

college, upon anatomy, physiology, surgery, gyn=C3=A6cology, therapeutics, =

but no preference is given to any school of=20


_
what in her high-school club, as they read Bernard Shaw, they had quite fra=
nkly and solemnly=20

spoken of as "Sex." All the work and the business, the scheming and plannin=
g and rush for=20

money, were focussed on this. And for this she was attracting those swift a=
dmiring glances. What=20

she would be, what she wanted to be, what she now ardently longed to become=
, grew clearer to=20

her day by day. For the picture was there before her eyes. Each day it grew=
 more familiar, as at=20

home in Amy's room she watched her beautiful sister, a stranger no longer t=
o her now, seated at=20

her dressing table good-humouredly chatting, and meanwhile revealing by num=
berless deft little=20

things she was doing the secrets of clothes and of figure, and of cheeks an=
d lips and eyes, with=20

subtle hints behind it all of the ancient magic art of Pan. She felt Amy ce=
aselessly bringing her out.=20

This gave her thrills of excitement. And looking at her sister she asked:  =
"Shall I ever be like that?"=20

And they kept talking, talking. And through it all the same feeling was the=
re, the sense of this=20

driving force of the town.  With the sturdy independence which was so deep =
a part of her, Ethel=20

strove to hold up her end of these intent conversations and show that she h=
ad views of her own.=20

She was no old-fashioned country girl, but modern, something different! The=
y had discussed=20

things in her club which would have shocked their mothers, discussed them l=
ong and seriously.=20

his diploma from a college recognized by the American Institute of Hom=C5=
=93opathy, on anatomy,=20

physiology, surgery, gyn=C3=A6cology, materia medica, therapeutics, obstetr=
ics, and chemistry, but no=20

preference is given to any school of medicine (Rev. Stats., 1892, s. 806). =
 When the board is=20

satisfied as to the qualifications of the applicant, they grant a certifica=
te which entitles him to=20

practise medicine in any county, when recorded (_ib._, s. 807). Any two mem=
bers of the board=20

may grant a certificate. Any member may grant a temporary certificate, upon=
 examination, until the=20

next regular meeting, at which time the temporary certificate ceases to be =
of effect (_ib._, s. 808).=20

Before he shall be entitled to practise, the certificate must be recorded i=
n the office of the clerk of=20

the circuit court of the county in which he may reside or sojourn; and the =
clerk must certify thereon,=20

under official seal, the fact and date of the record, and return the certif=
icate (_ib._, s. 809).  A=20

practitioner engaged in the practice of medicine in any department prior to=
 May 31st, 1889, upon=20

the production of a diploma from a medical college recognized by the Americ=
an Medical=20

Association, is granted a certificate, without further examination and with=
