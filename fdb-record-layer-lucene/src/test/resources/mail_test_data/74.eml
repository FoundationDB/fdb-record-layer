the 1837 plow onward stretched an unbroken line of steel moldboard plows. An advertisement for 

John Deere plows in the March 10, 1843, issue of the _Rock River Register_, published weekly in 

Grand Detour, Illinois, gives a detailed description, here presented in full:      John Deere 

respectfully informs his friends and customers, the     agricultural community, of this and adjoining 

counties, and     dealers in Ploughs, that he is now prepared to fill orders for     the same on 

presentation.      The Moldboard of this well, and so favorably known PLOUGH, is     made of 

wrought iron, and the share of steel, 5/16 of an inch     thick, which carries a fine sharp edge. The 

whole face of the     moldboard and share is ground smooth, so that it the answer is, "They are 

keeping the feast of the full moon."  I believe this agitation is most frequently the effect of some 

conflict that has arisen in the depths of the forest. The jaguars, for instance, pursue the peccaries 

and the tapirs, which, having no defence but in their numbers, flee in close troops, and break down 

the bushes they find in their way. Terrified at this struggle, the timid and mistrustful monkeys 

answer, from the tops of the trees, the cries of the large animals. They awaken the birds that live 

in society, and by degrees the whole assembly is in commotion. It is not always in a fine 

moonlight, but more particularly at the time of a storm and violent showers, that this tumult takes 

place among the wild beasts. "May

perfectly bright in any soil, and will not choke in the     foulest of ground. It will do more work in a 

day, and do it     much better and with less labor, to both team and holder, than     the ordinary 

ploughs that do not scour, and in consequence of     the ground being better prepared, the 

agriculturalist obtains     a much heavier crop.      The price of Ploughs, in consequence of hard 

times, will be     reduced from last year's prices. Grand Detour, Feb. 3, 1843.  This raised two 

questions: Why, and for how long, was wrought iron used for the moldboards of the Deere plows? 

Of what material is the the monk who accompanied us to the Rio Negro, when, sinking with 

fatigue, he assisted in arranging our accommodations for the night. It was indeed strange, to find 

no silence in the solitude of woods. In the inns of Spain we dread the sound of guitars from the 

next apartment; on the Orinoco, where the traveller's resting-place is the open beach, or beneath 

the shelter of a solitary tree, his slumbers are disturbed by a serenade from the forest.  We set sail 

before sunrise, on the 2nd of April. The morning was beautiful and cool, according to the feelings 

of those who are accustomed to the heat of these

of the 1838 plow made? During the first few years, when production was very small, there were 

probably enough worn out mill saws available for the relatively few plows made. As production 

increased this source must have become inadequate. Ardrey gives the following figures for the 

production of plows by Deere and Andrus:[16] 1839, 10 plows; 1840, 40 plows; 1841, 75 plows; 

1842, 100 plows; 1843, 400 plows. Ardrey states further that "by this time the difficulty of obtaining 

steel in the quantity and quality needed had become a serious obstacle in the way of further 

development." The statement, quoted above, that the moldboard was of wrought iron and the 

statistics on production of plows during the 1840's and 1850's belie Ardrey's claim that it was a 

serious obstacle, nor is there any suggestion in the advertisement that wrought iron was being 

substituted for steel.  In 1847 John Deere amicably severed relations with the firm of Andrus & 

Deere and moved to Moline, Illinois, to continue plow manufacturing in a site that had better 

transportation facilities than Grand Detour. The new firm produced 700 plows in the first year, 

1600 in 1850, and 10,000 in 1857.[17] Swank[18] states that the first slab of cast plow steel ever 

rolled in the United States was in 1846 and that it was shipped to John Deere of Moline, Illinois. A 

28 degrees in the air, but the dry and white sand of the beach, notwithstanding its radiation 

towards a cloudless sky, retained a temperature of 36 degrees. The porpoises (toninas) ploughed 

the river in long files. The shore was covered with fishing-birds. Some of these perched on the 

floating wood as it passed down the river, and surprised the fish that preferred the middle of the 

stream. Our canoe was aground several times during the morning. These shocks are sufficiently 

violent to split a light bark. We struck on the points of several large trees, which remain for years in 

an oblique position, sunk in the mud. These trees descend from Sarare, at the period of great 

inundations, and they so fill the bed of the river, that canoes in going up find it difficult sometimes 

to make their way over the shoals, or wherever there are eddies. We reached a spot near the 

island of Carizales, where we saw trunks of the locust-tree, of an enormous size, above the 

surface of the water. They were covered with a species of plotus, nearly resembling the anhinga, 

or white bellied darter. These birds perch in files, like pheasants and parrakas, and they remain for 

hours entirely motionless, with their beaks raised toward the sky.  Below the island of Carizales we 

observed a diminution of the waters of the river, at which we were the

until the early 1860's in this country that several firms succeeded in making high grade crucible 

cast steel of uniform quality as a regular product.  [Illustration: Figure 7.--JOHN DEERE'S 1838

takes away water from the Apure. The loss is solely the effect of evaporation, and of filtration on a 

sandy and wet shore. Some idea of the magnitude of these effects may be formed, from the fact 

that we found the heat of the dry sands, at different hours of the day, from 36 to 52 degrees, and 

that of sands covered with
