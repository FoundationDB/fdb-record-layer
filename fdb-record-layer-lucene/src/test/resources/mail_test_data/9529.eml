CHAPTER XII.  OLD NEPTUNE JOINS THE PARTY.  WE started from Geera, on the 2=
3d of=20

December, with our party complete. The Hamran sword-hunters were Abou Do, J=
ali, and=20

Suleiman. My chief tracker was Taher Noor, who, although a good hunter, was=
 not a professional=20

aggahr, and I was accompanied by the father of Abou Do, who was a renowned =
"howarti," or=20

harpooner of hippopotami. This magnificent old man might have been Neptune =
himself; he stood=20

about six feet two, and his grizzled locks hung upon his shoulders in thick=
 and massive curls, while=20

his deep bronze features could not have been excelled in beauty of outline.=
 A more classical figure=20

I have never beheld than the old Abou Do with his harpoon, as he first brea=
sted the torrent, and=20

then landed dripping from the waves to join our party from the Arab camp on=
 the opposite side of=20

the river. In addition to my Tokrooris, I had engaged nine camels, each wit=
h a separate driver, of=20

the Hamrans, who were to accompany us throughout the expedition. These peop=
le were glad to=20

engage themselves, with their camels included, at one and a half dollars (s=
ix shillings) per month,=20

for man and beast as one. We had not sufficient baggage to load five camels=
, but four carried a=20

large supply of corn for our horses and people.  Hardly were we mounted and=
 fairly started, than=20

the monkey-like agility of our aggageers was displayed in a variety of anti=
cs, that were far more=20

suited to must be of him.  In fact the new priest seemed to have taken ever=
y one's fancy, and he=20

spoke a few words with them all, and then said he was tired, and went acros=
s to the=20

schoolmaster's, for he was to live there for a time till he could get his o=
wn place a bit straight, and=20

until he saw some signs of an income.  Only a few of the more important vil=
lagers accompanied=20

him to talk over the state of affairs: Peter Szlavik, the sacristan; Mihaly=
 Gongoly, the nabob of=20

Glogova; and the miller, Gyoergy Klincsok. He began to question them, and t=
ook out his note-

book, in order to make notes as to what his income was likely to be.  "How =
many inhabitants are=20

there in the village?"  "Rather less than five hundred."  "And how much do =
they pay the priest?"=20

They began to reckon out how much wood they had to give, how much corn, and=
 how much wine.=20

The young priest looked more and more serious as they went on.  "That is ve=
ry little," he said=20

sadly. "And what are the fees?"  "Oh, they are large enough," answered Klin=
csok; "at a funeral it=20

depends on the dead person, at a wedding it depends on the people to be mar=
ried; but they are=20

pretty generous on that occasion as a rule; and at a christening one florin=
 is paid. I'm sure that's=20

enough, isn't it?"  "And how many weddings are there in a year?"  "Oh, that=
 depends on the potato=20

harvest. Plenty of potatoes, plenty of weddings. The harvest decides it; bu=
t as a rule there are at=20

least=20


_
party of steady and experienced hunters, who wished to reserve the strength=
 of their horses for a=20

trying journey.  Abou Do was mounted on a beautiful Abyssinian horse, a gre=
y; Suleiman rode a=20

rough and inferior-looking beast; while little Jali, who was the pet of the=
 party, rode a grey mare,=20

not exceeding fourteen hands in height, which matched her rider exactly in =
fire, spirit, and speed.=20

Never was there a more perfect picture of a wild Arab horseman than Jali on=
 his mare. Hardly was=20

he in the saddle, than away flew the mare over the loose shingles that form=
ed the dry bed of the=20

river, scattering the rounded pebbles in the air from her flinty hoofs, whi=
le her rider in the vigour of=20

delight threw himself almost under her belly while at full speed, and picke=
d up stones from the=20

ground, which he flung, and again caught as they descended. Never were ther=
e more complete=20

Centaurs than these Hamran Arabs; the horse and man appeared to be one anim=
al, and that of=20

the most elastic or five."  "That is not many. And how many deaths occur?" =
 "That depends on the=20

quality of the potato harvest. If the potatoes are bad, there are many deat=
hs, if they are good,=20

there are less deaths, for we are not such fools as to die then. Of course =
now and then a falling=20

tree in the woods strikes one or the other dead; or an accident happens to =
a cart, and the driver is=20

killed. You may reckon a year with eight deaths a good one as far as you ar=
e concerned."  "But=20

they don't all belong to the priest," said the nabob of Glogova, smoothing =
back his hair.  "Why,=20

how is that?" asked the priest.  "Many of the inhabitants of Glogova are ne=
ver buried in the=20

cemetery at all. The wolves eat them without ever announcing it in the pari=
sh."  "And some die in=20

other parts of the country," went on Gyoergy Klincsok, "so that only very f=
ew of them are buried=20

here."  "It is a bad lookout," said the priest. "But the parish fields, wha=
t about them?"  Now they all=20

wanted to speak at once,=20
