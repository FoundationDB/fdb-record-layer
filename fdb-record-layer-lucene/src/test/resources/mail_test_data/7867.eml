be cracks at the uprights and cross-sticks, because they must take in moisture when they are 

daubed with the mud, and cause cracks in the stucco when they dry and shrink, the following 

method will prevent this from happening. After the whole wall has been smeared with the mud, nail 

rows of reeds to it by means of "fly-nails," then spread on the mud a second time, and, if the first 

rows have been nailed with the shafts transverse, nail on a second set with the shafts vertical, and 

then, as above described, spread on the sand mortar, the marble, and the whole mass of stucco. 

Thus, the double series of reeds with their shafts crossing on the walls will prevent any chipping or 

cracking from taking place.     CHAPTER IV  ON STUCCO WORK IN DAMP PLACES, AND ON 

THE DECORATION OF DINING ROOMS   1. Having spoken of the method by which stucco work 

should be done in dry situations, I shall next explain how the polished finish is to Fyodorovitch 

takes two packs of cards off the whatnot and begins to play patience. According to him, some 

varieties of patience require great concentration and attention, yet while he lays out the cards he 

does not leave off distracting his attention with talk. Katya watches his cards attentively, and more 

by gesture than by words helps him in his play. She drinks no more than a couple of wine-glasses 

of wine the whole evening; I drink four glasses, and the rest of the bottle falls to the share of Mihail 

Fyodorovitch, who can drink a great deal and never get drunk.  Over our patience we settle 

various questions, principally of the higher order, and what we care for most of all--that is, science 

and learning--is more roughly handled than anything.  "Science, thank God, has outlived its day," 

says Mihail Fyodorovitch emphatically. "Its song is sung. Yes, indeed. Mankind begins to feel 

impelled to replace it by something

accomplished in places that are damp, in such a way that it can last without defects. First, in 

apartments which are level with the ground, apply a rendering coat of mortar, mixed with burnt 

brick instead of sand, to a height of about three feet above the floor, and then lay on the stucco so 

that those portions of it may not be injured by the dampness. But if a wall is in a state of dampness 

all over, construct a second thin wall a little of superstition, been nourished by superstition, and is 

now just as much the quintessence of superstition as its defunct granddames, alchemy, 

metaphysics, and philosophy. And, after all, what has it given to mankind? Why, the difference 

between the learned Europeans and the Chinese who have no science is trifling, purely external. 

The Chinese know nothing of science, but what have they lost thereby?"  "Flies know nothing of 

science,

suited to circumstances, and in the space between these two walls run a channel, at a lower level 

than that of the apartment, with vents to the open air. Similarly, when the wall is brought up to the 

top, leave airholes there. For if the moisture has no means of getting out by vents at the bottom 

and at the top, it will not fail to spread all over the new wall. This done, apply a rendering coat of 

mortar made with burnt brick to this wall, spread on the layer of  "There is no need to be angry, 

Nikolay Stepanovitch. I only say this here between ourselves... I am more careful than you think, 

and I am not going to say this in public--God forbid! The superstition exists in the multitude that the 

arts and sciences are superior to agriculture, commerce, superior to handicrafts. Our sect is 

maintained by that superstition, and it is not for you and me to destroy it. God forbid!"  After 

patience the younger generation comes in for a
