 a member of=20

Company "I", 35th Regiment. She is still a bit breathless when she relates =
the details of the=20

military wedding that followed a whirlwind courtship which had its beginnin=
g on the citadel green,=20

where the soldiers stationed there held their dress parade. After these par=
ades there was dancing=20

by the soldiers and belles who had bedecked themselves in their Sunday best=
 and come out to be=20

wooed by a soldier in blue.  Music was furnished by the military band which=
 offered many patriotic=20

numbers that awakened in the newly freed Negroes that had long been dead--p=
atriotism. Harriett=20

recalls snatches of one of these songs to which she danced when she was 20 =
years of age. It is=20

as follows:    Don't you see the lightning flashing in the cane brakes,   L=
ooks like we gonna have a=20

 Look out the battle is=20

a-falling   The darkies gonna occupy the land.  Harriett believes the two o=
fficers who tendered=20

congratulations shortly after her marriage to have been Generals Gates and =
Beecher. This was an=20

added thrill to her.  As she lived a rather secluded life, Harriett Gresham=
 can tell very little about=20

the superstitions of her people during slavery, but knew them to be very re=
verent of various signs=20

and omens. In one she places much credence herself. Prior to the Civil War,=
 there were hordes of=20

ants and everyone said this was an omen of war, and there was a war.  She w=
as married when=20

schools were set up for Negroes, but had no time for school. Her master was=
 adamant on one=20

point and that was the danger of teaching a slave to read and write, so Har=
riett received little=20

"book learning."  Harriett Gresham is the mother of several children, grand=
children and great=20

grandchildren. Many of them are dead. She lives at 1305 west 31st Street, J=
acksonville, Florida=20

with a grand daughter. Her second husband is also dead. She sits on the por=
ch of her shabby=20

also dead. She=20

N HALL   Bolden=20

Hall was born in Walkino, Florida, a little town in Jefferson County, on Fe=
bruary 13, 1853, the son=20

of Alfred and Tina Hall. The Halls who were the slaves of Thomas Lenton, ow=
ner of seventy-five or=20

a hundred slaves, were the parents of twenty-one children. The Halls, who w=
ere born before=20

slavery worked on the large plantation of Lenton which was devoted primaril=
y to the growing of=20

cotton and corn and secondarily to the growing of tobacco and pumpkins. Len=
ton was very good to=20



his slaves and never whipped them unless it was absolutely of the age. But =
the guiding light, the=20

grand aim, the ennobling influence were gone. The Swedes sank almost to the=
 level of the vile=20

element around, and a torture used by the buccaneers to extract confessions=
 of hidden treasure=20

bore the name of the Swedish draught. The last grand figure left the scene =
in Wallenstein. Nothing=20

remained but mean ferocity and rapine, coarse filibustering among the soldi=
ers, among the=20

statesmen and diplomatists filibustering a little more refined. All high mo=
tives and interests were=20

dead. The din of controversy which at the outset accompanied the firing of =
the cannon, and proved=20

that the cannon was being fired in a great cause, had long since sunk into =
silence. Yet for fourteen=20

years after the death of Wallenstein this soulless, aimless drama of horror=
 and agony dragged on.=20

Every part of Germany was repeatedly laid under heavy war contributions, an=
d swept through by=20

pillage, murder, rape and arson. For thirty years all countries, even those=
 of the Cossack and the=20

Stradiot, sent their worst sons to the scene of butchery and plunder. It ma=
y be doubted whether=20

such desolation ever fell upon any civilized and cultivated country. When t=
he war began Germany=20

was rich and prosperous, full of smiling villages, of goodly cities, of flo=
urishing universities, of=20

active industry, of invention and discovery, of literature and learning, of=
 happiness, of progress, of=20

national energy and hope. At its close she was a material and moral wildern=
ess. In a district,=20

selected as a fair average specimen of the effects of the war, it is found =
that of the inhabitants=20

three-fourths, of the cattle four-fifths had perished. For thirty years the=
 husbandman never sowed=20

with any confidence that he should reap; the seed-corn was no doubt often c=
onsumed by the=20

reckless troopers or the starving peasantry; and if foreign countries had b=
een able to supply food=20

there were no railroads to bring it. The villages through whole provinces w=
ere burnt or pulled down=20

to supply materials for the huts of the soldiery; the people hid themselves=
 in dens and caves of the=20

earth, took to the woods and mountains, where many of them remained swellin=
g the multitude of=20

brigands. When they could they wreaked upon the lansquenets a vengeance as =
dreadful as what=20

they had suffered, and were thus degraded to the same level of ferocity. Mo=
ral life was broken up.=20

The Germany of Luther with its order and piety and domestic virtue, with it=
s old ways and customs,=20

even with its fashions of dress and furniture, perished almost as though it=
 had been swallowed by=20

an earthquake. The nation would hardly have survived had it not been for th=
e desperate tenacity=20

with which the peasant clung to his own soil, and the efforts of the pastor=
s, men of contracted=20

views, of dogmatic habits of mind, and of a somewhat narrow and sour morali=
ty, but staunch and=20

faithful in the hour of need, who continued to preach and pray amidst black=
ened ruins to the=20

miserable remnants of their flocks, and sustained something of moral order =
and of social life.=20

Hence in the succeeding centuries, the political nullity of the German nati=
on, the absence of any=20

strong popular element to make head against the petty despotism of the prin=
ces, and launch=20

Germany in the career of progress. Hence the backwardness and torpor of the=
 Teutonic race in its=20

original seat, while elsewhere it led the world. Hence, while England was p=
roducing Chathams and=20

Burkes, Germany was producing the great musical composers. Hence when the m=
ovement came=20

it was rather intellectual than political, rather a movement of the univers=
ities than of the nation.  At=20

last, nothing being left for the armies to devour, the masters of the armie=
s began to think of peace.=20

The diplomatists went to work, and in true diplomatic fashion. Two years th=
ey spent in formalities=20

and haggling, while Germany was swarming with disbanded lansquenets. It was=
 then that old=20

Oxenstierna said to his son, who had modestly declined an ambassadorship on=
 the ground of=20



inexperience, "Thou knowest not, my son, with how little wisdom the world i=
s governed." The=20

object of=20

o it that their cabins=20

were liveable. He was careful, however, to see that they received no educat=
ional training, but did=20

not interfere with their religious quest. The slaves were permitted to atte=
nd church with their=20

masters to hear the white preacher, and occasionally the master--supposedly=
 un-beknown to the=20

slaves--would have an itinerant colored minister preach to the slaves, inst=
ructing them to obey=20

their master and mistress at all times. Although freedom came to the slaves=
 in January, Master=20

Lenton kept them until May in order to help him with his crops. When actual=
 freedom was granted=20

justice or of the rights of nations, but of the relative force and cunning =
of what are happily called=20
