country, and asking what the Spaniards wished; for if they wanted       gold or women or 

provisions, they should be given them, and begging       that they should not be killed in this way: 

and this the Spaniards       themselves have confessed to be true. 31.31. And the said Francisco 

Garcia told them to go away, that they were       drunk, and that he did not understand them, after 

which he returned       to where the said captain was and they set out to march through all       the 

province, making most cruel war on the natives, plundering and       killing them; and more than 

two thousand souls were carried off from       there between him and his soldiers, all of whom died 

in chains. 32.32. Before they left the inhabited country, they killed more than five       hundred 

persons.  Thus he returned to the province of Calili; and if       on the way some Indian, man or 

woman, became so tired that he could       not walk, they stabbed him; if he was in chains they cut 

off his       head, so as not to undo them and so that the others seeing this,       should not feign 

being ill. 33.33. In this way they all died, and on this journey all the people he       had brought from 

Quito, Pasto, Quilla, Cagua, Paria, Popayan, Lili,       Cali, and Anzerma, perished in very great 

numbers.  On his return       march, as soon as he entered the large town, they killed all they 

could.  And they captured three hundred persons in that day. 34.34. From the province of Lili, he 

sent the said captain, Juan de       Ampudia, with many people to the place and dwellings of Lili, in 

order to capture all the Indians, men and women, that he could, for       carrying the packs; 

because all the numerous people he had brought       from Anzerma, had already died.  And the 

said Juan de Ampudia       brought more than a thousand persons, many of whom he killed. 35.35. 

The said captain took all the people he needed, giving the rest to       the soldiers, who at once put 

them in chains, where they all died:       after depriving the said country of the Spaniards, and of 

the       natives in such great numbers, as is seen by the few that are left,       he set out for 

Popayan. 36.36. On the way he left behind a live Spaniard, whose name was Martin de 

Aguirre, because he could not walk as much as the healthy ones.  On       his arrival at Popayan 

he dwelt in that town, and began to destroy,       and rob the Indians of the surrounding country, 

with the same       disorder as he had done in the others. 37.37. He made a royal stamp here and 

melted all the gold he had gathered,       and that Juan de Ampudia had gathered before he came; 

and without       any accounting or explanation, and without giving any part to any       soldier, he 

took it all for himself, except that he gave what he       chose to some whose horses were dead. 

This done, and after taking       the fifths of His Majesty he said he was going to Cuzco to report to 

his Governor; so he set out for Quito, taking a great number of       Indians, men, and women, all of 

whom died on the journey and in that       place.  And further the said captain returned to destroy 

the royal       stamp he had made. 38.38. It is well at this point to relate a word that this man said of 

himself, showing that he very well knew the evil and cruelty that he       did.  He spoke thus: "In fifty 

years, those that pass by here and       hear of these things, will say: 'It was here that the tyrant so 

and       so marched.' " 39.39. These in-comings and out-goings of this captain in those kingdoms, 

and this way of visiting those people living safely in their       country, and these operations 

practised by him against them, Your       Highness should know and be convinced, have always 

been done by the       Spaniards everywhere in the same way, from the discovery of the       Indies 

till the present day.      APPENDIX II. - THE BULL SUBLIMIS DEUS                                Latin

Set up and electrotyped. Published April, 1908.  Norwood Press J. S. Cushing Co.--Berwick & 

Smith Co. Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.     PREFACE   About seven years ago I began to dictate the 

first of these Plays to Lady Gregory. My eyesight had become so bad that I feared I could 

henceforth write nothing with my own hands but verses, which, as Theophile Gautier has said, can 

be written with a burnt match. Our Irish Dramatic movement was just passing out of the hands of 

English Actors, hired because we knew of no Irish ones, and our little troop of Irish amateurs--as 

they were at the time--could not have too many Plays, for they would come to nothing without 

continued playing. Besides, it was exciting to discover, after the unpopularity of blank verse, what 

one could do with three Plays written in prose and founded on three public interests deliberately 

chosen,--religion, humour, patriotism. I planned in those days to establish a dramatic movement 

upon the popular passions, as the ritual of religion is established in the emotions that surround 



birth and death and marriage, and it was only the coming of the unclassifiable, uncontrollable, 

capricious, uncompromising genius of J. M. Synge that altered the direction of the movement and 

made it individual, critical, and combative. If his had not, some other stone would have blocked up 

the old way, for the public mind of Ireland, stupefied by prolonged intolerant organisation, can take 

but brief pleasure in the caprice that is in all art, whatever its subject, and, more commonly, can 

but hate unaccustomed personal reverie.  I had dreamed the subject of "Cathleen ni Houlihan," but 

found when I looked for words that I could not create peasant dialogue that would go nearer to 

peasant life than the dialogue in "The Land of Heart's Desire" or "The Countess Cathleen." Every 

artistic form has its own ancestry, and the more elaborate it is, the more is the writer constrained 

to symbolise rather than to represent life, until perhaps his ladies of fashion are shepherds and 

shepherdesses, as when Colin Clout came home again. I could not get away, no matter how 

closely I watched the country life, from images and dreams which had all too royal blood, for they 

were descended like the thought of every poet from all the conquering dreams of Europe, and I 

wished to make that high life mix into some rough contemporary life without ceasing to be itself, as 

so many old books and Plays have mixed it and so few modern, and to do this I added another 

knowledge to my own. Lady Gregory had written no Plays, but had, I discovered, a greater 

knowledge of the country mind and country speech than anybody I had ever met with, and nothing 

but a burden of knowledge could keep "Cathleen ni Houlihan" from the clouds. I needed less help 

for the "Hour-Glass," for the speech there is far from reality, and so the Play is almost wholly mine. 

When, however, I brought to her the general scheme for the "Pot of Broth," a little farce which 

seems rather imitative to-day, though it plays well enough, and of the first version of "The 

Unicorn," "Where there is Nothing," a five-act Play written in a fortnight to save it from a plagiarist, 

and tried to 


_
disciplinae capaces existant.  Quod videns ipsius humani generis emulus qui bonis operibus, ut 

pereant semper adversatur, modum excogavit ac temis in auditum, quo impediret, ne verbum Dei 

gentibus salve fierent, predicaretur, ac quosdam suos satelites commovit, qui suam cupiditatem 

ad implere, cupientes occidentales, et meridionales Indos, et alias gentes, quas temporibus istis 

ad nostram notitiam pervenerunt, sub praetextu, quod Fidei Catolicae expertes existant, uti muta 

animalia ad nostra obsequia redigendos esse passim asserere praesumat.  Nos igitur more 

considerable. She would not allow me to put her name to these Plays, though I have always tried 

to explain her share in them, but has signed "The Unicorn from the Stars," which but for a good 

deal of the general plan and a single character and bits of another is wholly hers. I feel indeed that 

my best share in it is that idea, which I have been capable of expressing completely in criticism 

alone, of bringing together the rough life of the road and the frenzy that the poets have found in 

their ancient cellar,--a prophecy, as it were, of the time when 


_
terris, et oves gregis sui nobis commissas, quae extra eius ovile sunt, ad ipsum ovile toto nixu 

exquirimus.  Attendentes Indos ipsos, ut pote veros homines, non solum Christianae Fidei 

capaces existere, sed ut nobis innotuit, ad fidem ipsam promptissime currere.  Ac volentes super 

his congruis remediis providere, prasdictos Indos et omnes alias gentes ad notitiam Christianorum 

imposterum deventuras, licet extra Fidem Christi existant sua libertate ac rerum suarum dominio 

privatos, seu privandos non esse.  Imo libertate et dominio huiusmodi, uti et potiri, et gaudere, 

libere et licite posse, nee in servitutem redigi debere.  Ac si secus fieri contigerit irritum et innane. 

born in the one body.  The chief person of the earlier Play was very dominating, and I have grown 

to look upon this as a fault, though it increases the dramatic effect in a superficial way. We cannot 

sympathise with the man who sets his anger at once lightly and confidently to overthrow the order 

of the world, for such a man will seem to us alike insane and arrogant. But our hearts can go with 

him, as I think, if he speak with some humility, so far as his daily self carry him, out of a cloudy 

light of vision; for whether he understand or not, it may be that voices of angels and archangels 

have spoken in the cloud, and whatever wildness come upon his life, feet of theirs may well
