Although wisdom and experience point to the necessity of showing something =
_
things as may redound to the honour of God, and to the profit of all Christ=
endom and his own=20

kingdom, and not through vain glory nor selfish advantage. We are determine=

state God has intrusted to us,=E2=80=94and whenever we may think it conveni=

possessions on your side of the sea, accompanied by such numbers of persons=

judge expedient to acquire honour in the accomplishment of all your courage=

should it please GOD, our Lady, and my lord St George, you shall not depart=

so long as it may please God to suffer it, which mode I shall prefer to pre=
vent any greater effusion=20

of Christian blood. God knows, we will that no one should be ignorant that =
this our answer does=20

not proceed from pride or presumption of heart, which every wise man who ho=
lds his honour dear=20

should avoid, but solely to abase that haughtiness and over presumption of =
any one, whosoever=20

he may be, that prevents him from knowing himself. Should you wish that tho=
se of your party be=20

without reproach, be more cautious in future of your letters, your promises=
 and your seal, than you=20

 from our knowledge=20

of you, and that we will maintain our right whenever God pleases, we have s=

this present letter. Given at our court of London, the 5th day of December,=
 in the year of Grace=20

1402, and in the 4th of our reign.=E2=80=99       THE LETTER OF ALLIANCE BE=
TWEEN THE DUKE OF=20

ORLEANS AND THE         DUKE OF LANCASTER.  =E2=80=98Louis, duke of Orleans=
, count de Valois,=20

Blois and de Beaumont, to all whom these presents may come, health and gree=
ting. We make=20

known by them, that the most potent prince, and our very dear cousin, Henry=
, duke of Lancaster=20

and Hereford, earl of Derby, Lincoln, Leicester and Northampton, has given =
us his love and=20

friendship. Nevertheless, being desirous of strengthening the ties of this =
affection between us,=20

seeing that nothing in this world can be more delectable or profitable:  =
=E2=80=98In the name of God and the=20

most holy Trinity, which is a fair example and sound foundation of perfect =
love and charity, and=20

without whose grace nothing can be profitably concluded,=E2=80=94to the end=
 that the form and manner of=20

this our friendship may be reputed honourable, we have caused the terms of =
it to be thus drawn=20

up. First, we both hold it just and right to except from it all whom we sha=
ll think proper; and=20

conformably thereto we except, on our part, the following persons: first, o=
ur very mighty and=20

puissant prince and lord Charles, by the grace of God king of France; my lo=
rd the dauphin, his=20

eldest son, and all the other children of my foresaid lord; the queen of Fr=
ance; our very dear=20

uncles the dukes of Berry, Burgundy and Bourbon; those most noble princes, =
our dear cousins,=20

the king of the Romans and of Bohemia; the king of Hungary, his brother and=
 their uncles, and=20

Becop[34] marquis of Moravia; and also all our cousins, and others of our b=
lood, now living, or that=20

may be born, as well males as females, and our very dear father the duke of=
 Milan, whose=20

daughter we have married. This relationship must make us favourable to his =
honour. Also those=20

noble princes, and our very dear cousins, the kings of Castille and of Scot=
land, with all the other=20

allies of our foresaid lord. To whom must likewise be added our very dear c=
ousin the duke of=20

Lorraine[35], the count of Cleves[36], the lord de Clisson, and all our vas=
sals bound to us by faith=20

and oath, whom we hold ourselves obliged to guard from ill, since they have=
 submitted to our=20

obedience and commands.  =E2=80=98Item, The duke of Lancaster and myself wi=
ll be always united in the=20

strictest ties of love and affection, as loyal and true friends should be. =
 =E2=80=98Item, Each of us will be, at=20



all times and places, friendly to one another, and to our friends, and enem=
ies to our enemies, as=20

will be honourable and praise-worthy.  =E2=80=98Item, We will each, in all =
times and places, aid and assist=20

the other in the defence of his person, his fortune, honour and estate, as =
well by words as deeds,=20

diligently and carefully in the most honourable manner.  =E2=80=98Item, In =
times of war and discord we will=20

mutually defend each other against all princes, lords and barons, with the =
utmost good will, and=20

also against any corporation, college or university, by every means in our =
power, engines,=20

councils, force, men at arms, subsidies, or by whatever other means we may =
think most efficient to=20

make war on and oppose the enemies of either of us; and we will exert ourse=
lves to the utmost=20

against every person whatever, excepting those who have been before excepte=
d, in every lawful=20

and honourable manner.  =E2=80=98Item, All the above articles we will stric=
tly observe so long as the truces=20

shall continue between my aforesaid sovereign lord and king and the king of=
 England, and should=20

a more solid peace be formed, so long as that peace shall last, without inf=
ringing an article. In=20

witness of which we have caused these articles to be drawn up, and have app=
ended our seal=20

thereto. Done at Paris the 17th day of June, in the year of Grace 1396.=E2=
=80=99       THE SECOND=20

LETTER OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS, IN REPLY TO THAT         FROM THE KING OF=20

ENGLAND.  =E2=80=98High and mighty prince Henry, king of England,=E2=80=94I=
, Louis, by the grace of God, son=20

and brother to the kings of France, duke of Orleans, write, to make known t=
o you, that I received,=20

as a new year=E2=80=99s gift, the first day of January, by the hands of you=
r herald Lancaster, king at arms,=20

the letter you have written to me, in answer to the one I sent to you by Ch=
ampagne, king at arms,=20

and Orleans my herald, and have heard its contents.  =E2=80=98In regard to =
your ignorance, or pretended=20

ignorance, whether my letter could have been addressed to you, your name wa=
s on it, such as you=20

received at the font, and by which you were always called by your parents w=
hen they were alive. I=20

had not indeed given you your new titles at length, because I do not approv=
e of the manner=20

whereby you have attained them,=E2=80=94but know that my letter was address=
ed to you.  =E2=80=98In regard to=20

your being surprised at my requesting to perform a deed of arms with you du=
ring the existence of=20

the truce between my most redoubted lord the king of France and the high an=
d mighty prince king=20

Richard, my nephew, and your liege lord lately deceased, (God knows by whos=
e orders) as well=20

as an alliance of friendship subsisting between us, of which you have sent =
me a copy,=E2=80=94that treaty=20

is now at an end by your own fault; first, by your having undertaken your e=
nterprise against your=20

sovereign lord king Richard, whom God pardon! who was the ally of my lord t=
he king of France by=20

marriage with his daughter, as well as by written articles, sealed with the=
ir seals, to the=20

observance of which the kindred on each side made oath, in the presence of =
the two monarchs=20

and their relations, in their different countries.  =E2=80=98You may have s=
een in those articles, of which you=20

sent me a copy, that the allies of my said lord the king were excepted, and=
 may judge whether I=20

can honestly now have any friendship for you; for at the time I made the sa=
id alliance I never=20

conceived it possible you could have done against your king what it is well=
 known you have done.=20

=E2=80=98In regard to your objection, that no knight, of whatever rank he m=
ay be, ought to request a deed of=20

arms until he shall have returned the articles of alliance, supposing such =
to exist between them, I=20

wish to know whether you rendered to your lord, king Richard, the oath of f=
idelity you made to him=20

before you proceeded in the manner you have done against his person.  =E2=
=80=98In respect to your=20

throwing up my friendship, know, that from the moment I was informed of the=
 acts you committed,=20

against your liege lord, I had not any expectation that you could suppose y=
ou would place any=20



dependance on me,=E2=80=94for you must have known that I could not have any=
 desire to preserve your=20

friendship.  =E2=80=98With regard to your high situation, I do not think th=
e divine virtues have placed you=20

there. God may have dissembled with you, and have set you on a throne, like=
 many other princes,=20

whose reign has ended in confusion. And, in consideration of my own honour,=
 I do not wish to be=20

compared with you.  =E2=80=98You say, you shall be always eager to defend y=
our honour, which has been=20

ever unblemished. Enough on that head is sufficiently known in all countrie=
s.  =E2=80=98As for your=20

intentions of visiting your possessions on this side of the sea, without in=
forming me of your arrival,=20

I assure you, that you shall not be there long without hearing from me; for=
, if God permit, I will=20

accomplish what I have proposed, if it be not your fault.  =E2=80=98In rega=
rd to your telling me, that your=20

progenitors have not thus been accustomed to be challenged by those of less=
 degree than=20

themselves,=E2=80=94who have been my ancestors, I need not be my own herald=
, for they are well known=20

to all the world. And in respect to my personal honour, through the mercy o=
f God, it is without=20

reproach, as I have always acted like a loyal and honest man, as well towar=
d my God as to my=20

king and his realm: whoever has acted, or may act otherwise, though he hold=
 the universe in his=20

hand, is worthless, and undeserving of respect.  =E2=80=98You tell me, that=
 a prince ought to make his=20

every action redound to the honour of God, to the common advantage of all C=
hristendom, and the=20

particular welfare of his kingdom, and not through vain glory, nor for self=
ish purposes. I reply, that=20

you say well; but if you had acted accordingly in your own country, many th=
ings done there by you,=20

or by your be illustrated than by the citation of one or two cases.  In the=
 celebrated case of=20

=E2=80=9CEugene Aram,=E2=80=9D the bones of his victim were discovered thir=
teen years after the crime had been=20

committed. A man who afterward proved to be Aram=E2=80=99s accomplice was a=
rrested on suspicion. He=20

confessed the crime, and the opinion formed by the medical witnesses was co=
nfirmed by his=20

statements. The skull presented evidence of fracture and indentation of a t=
emporal bone. Aram=20

argued the case in his own behalf, but the testimony was too strong against=
 him: he was convicted=20

and executed.  Taylor records the case of a man, Guerin, who was convicted =
of the murder of his=20

brother from evidence obtained from an examination of the skeleton three ye=
ars after interment.=20

Here, again, blows upon the head were the cause of death, and the fractures=
 were plainly=20

perceptible upon the exhumed skull.  An autopsy upon a body before the soft=
 parts have been=20

entirely destroyed, or upon an embalmed body, should be conducted in much t=
he same manner as=20

ordinary autopsies. In these cases the method of burial should be noted. If=
 it be a case of murder,=20

and the body has been hurriedly put into the ground, it is not likely that =
the custom of Christian=20

nations has been observed=E2=80=94that of laying the body full length, with=
 the head to the west.  In the=20

case of partially destroyed bodies, the remaining soft parts will give litt=
le evidence of the mode of=20

death unless the violence has been very extensive, and even then it may be =
impossible to=20

determine whether a wound was inflicted prior to or after death. Recourse m=
ust be had to the=20

skeleton, and the only evidence it can furnish is of fractures, unless, as =
happened in one case, a=20

rope be found about the cervical vertebr=C3=A6.  When the skeleton only is =
found, Taylor lays stress=20

upon the following points:  (1) Whether the bones belong to a human being o=
r one of the lower=20

animals.  (2) If a human being, whether male or female.  (3) The length of =
time they have probably=20

remained in the ground.  (4) The probable age of the individual to whom the=
y belonged. If the=20

maxillary bones be found, much information may be obtained from an examinat=
ion of the teeth.=20

(5) The probable stature of the individual during life.  (6) The race to wh=
ich he belonged. The=20



conformation of the skull and thickness of the bones will give important in=
formation on this point.=20

(7) It should be determined whether solitary bones belong to the right or l=
eft side, and whether=20

they form parts of one or more than one skeleton.  (8) Whether they have be=
en fractured, and if=20

so, whether it occurred during life, or by accident at the time of the exhu=
mation. If it occurred=20

during life, whether it be recent or of long standing.  (9) The presence or=
 absence of personal=20

deformities, of supernumerary fingers or toes, of curvature of the spine, o=
f ankylosis of one or=20

more joints.  (10) Whether they have been calcined, as murderers sometimes =
try to make away=20

with the bodies of their victims by burning. Especially is this the case in=
 infanticides (see=20

IDENTITY, Vol. I., p. 408 _et seq._; TIME OF DEATH, Vol. I., p. 452 _et seq=
._).   AUTOPSIES OF=20

FRAGMENTS.  These cases are usually cases of murder in the perpetration of =
which the criminal=20

has mutilated the body with a view to destroying all traces of identity.  T=
he importance which=20

attaches to autopsies of fragments rests upon the fact that parts of a body=
 may be found widely=20

separated, and that one portion may be found before the others. In such cas=
es it will be necessary=20

to determine if they belong to one and the same body. The examination is co=
nducted chiefly with a=20

view to establishing this.  The examiner must note the manner in which the =
fragment has been=20

separated; whether it is clean cut, as by one who understood something of a=
natomy, or, whether it=20

has been separated roughly and by one ignorant of the body structure. The d=
etermination of this=20

point will be one link in the chain of evidence which may lead to the detec=
tion of the criminal, or=20

the acquittal of one accused. An anatomist or a butcher would be likely to =
cut through at a joint,=20

and to do it neatly. The exact point at which the severance has taken place=
 should be noted. The=20

place of finding, the circumstances under which found, the condition and ge=
neral appearance of=20

the fragment should all be carefully recorded. The color of the skin will i=
ndicate with some=20

accuracy the race to which the individual belonged. The probable sex may be=
 determined by the=20

presence or absence of hair, and the general conformation. This, however, w=
ill not apply in the=20

case of children. The probable age may be fixed upon from the size and degr=
ee of development of=20

the fragment. The cut surface should be carefully described, and if possibl=
e a drawing should be=20

made of it.  There are special considerations which apply to certain parts =
of the body.  =3DThe=20

Head.=3D=E2=80=94The exact point of severance should be recorded. The numbe=
r of vertebr=C3=A6 which remain=20

attached to the head should be counted, and if the section pass through a v=
ertebra, its number=20

and the amount of it missing should be stated. The sex will be apparent in =
all instances; the race=20

may be determined both by the color of the skin and by the shape of the hea=
d; the age may be=20

approximated, though care must be had in expressing an opinion, for the man=
ner of living is well=20

known to affect the appearance of age. Evidence of violence prior to death =
should be noted, and=20

the presence or absence of fractures ascertained; also observe the color of=
 the hair and whether it=20

be thin or abundant; the presence or absence of beard or mustache, and if p=
resent the color; and=20

the color of the eyes.  =3DThe Arm.=3D=E2=80=94The following points should =
be determined: the color of the=20

skin as indication of race; the probable sex from its shape and general con=
formation; the probable=20

age from its size and degree of development; marks of any kind, such as tat=
tooing; and=20

deformities, such as signs of old or recent fracture, or dislocation; and s=
upernumerary fingers.=20

=3DThe Leg.=3D=E2=80=94The examination of the leg should be conducted in mu=
ch the same manner as that=20

of the arm.  =3DThe Trunk.=3D=E2=80=94An examination of the trunk will reve=
al the race, sex, and probable=20

age, and may give evidence as regards the manner in which the deceased came=
 to his or her=20



death. Any marks or deformities should be recorded, and in all cases the vi=
scera should be=20

examined.   MEDICO-LEGAL REPORTS.[568]  After making a medico-legal autopsy=
, it will be=20

necessary for the medical examiner to draw up a report of his findings, and=
 the conclusions based=20

thereon. The report should be clear and concise, and the language such as a=
 coroner=E2=80=99s jury can=20

understand. Technical terms should be avoided, and when their employment is=
 necessary they=20

should be explained in the margin or in parentheses.  The report should be =
drawn up in somewhat=20

the following manner:  1. When and under what circumstances the body was fi=
rst seen; stating=20

hour of day, day of week and month.  2. When deceased was last seen living,=
 or known to be=20

alive.  3. Any circumstances that would lead to a suspicion of suicide or m=
urder.  4. Time after=20

death at which the examination was made, if it can be ascertained.  5. The =
external appearance of=20

the body: whether the surface is livid or pallid.  6. State of countenance.=
  7. Any marks of violence=20

on the person, disarrangement of the dress, blood-stains, etc.  8. Presence=
 or absence of warmth=20

in the legs, abdomen, arms, armpits, or mouth.  9. Presence or absence of r=
igor mortis.  To give=20

any value to this point it is necessary for the witness to observe the natu=
re of the substance upon=20

which the body is lying; whether the body be clothed or naked, young or old=
, fat or emaciated.=20

These conditions materially influence the rapidity of cooling and the onset=
 of rigor mortis.  10.=20

Upon first opening the body the color of the muscles should be noted. Carbo=
n monoxide poisoning=20

causes them to be of a cherry-red color.  11. The condition of the blood an=
d its color.  12. The=20

state of the abdominal viscera, describing each one in the order in which i=
t is removed (see p.=20

370). If the stomach and intestines are inflamed the seat of the inflammati=
on should be exactly=20

specified; also all evidences of softening, ulceration, effusion of blood, =
corrosion, or perforation.=20

The presence of hardened f=C3=A6ces in the rectum will bear evidence that n=
o purging occurred=20

immediately before death.  13. The state of the heart and lungs. (For speci=
al consideration of the=20

lungs in cases of suspected infanticide, see Vol. II.; and of persons drown=
ed, see Vol. I., p. 805=20

_et seq._).  14. The state of the brain and spinal cord.  After a thorough =
consideration of the=20

results of the examination, conclusions must be drawn from this examination=
; never from the=20

statements of others. The conclusions commonly relate to whether death was =
due to natural or=20

unnatural causes; if to unnatural causes, what are the facts which lead the=
 examiner to this=20

opinion. As the conclusions are intended to form a summary of the whole rep=
ort, they must be=20

brief and tersely stated.       PERSONAL IDENTITY,    INCLUDING    THE METH=
ODS USED FOR=20

=E2=80=98How could you suffer my much redoubted lady the queen of England t=

country after the death of her lord, despoiled, by your rigour and cruelty,=
 of her dower, which you=20

detain from her, and likewise the portion she carried hence on her marriage=
? The man who seeks=20

to gain honour is always the defender and guardian of the rights of widows =
and damsels of=20

myself toward God and toward her, as a relation, I reply, that to avoid eff=

the seal of my arms, and signed it  The great number and variety of facts c=
oncerned in the=20

investigation of questions of identity are of considerable gravity and impo=
rtance in their juridical=20

bearing, and at the same time they are among the most interesting and most =
useful of the=20

applications of modern medicine to the purposes of the law.[569]  Among the=
 varied researches of=20

legal medicine looking to an interpretation of facts, no other question occ=
urs in which the solution=20

depends more upon morphological and anatomical knowledge, and none is more =
dependent upon=20

purely objective, visible, tangible facts.  Personal identity often constit=
utes the entire subject-matter=20

of dispute in a civil case. Upon it may depend the question of absence or o=
f marriage, of kinship or=20

of filiation involving the possession of an estate, in which case the court=
 often requires the most=20

subtle of scientific evidence to assist in its decision. Many anthropologic=
al and medical facts, now=20

appropriated by criminology and penal science, are useful in proving not on=
ly the present but in=20

attesting future identity, thereby preventing in great measure the dissimul=
ation of prisoners,=20

deserters, false claimants to life insurance, fraudulent pensioners, and th=
e like.  Such matters are=20

of daily occurrence. The special agents of the U. S. Pension Office detect =
and cause the=20

punishment of many fraudulent claimants. Stratagems and conspiracies to def=
raud life-insurance=20

companies go much further than mere substitution. Instead of a =E2=80=9Cfra=
udulent=E2=80=9D a positive death may=20

come up for investigation, and in order to defraud an insurance company of =
a large amount, a=20

body may even be procured by homicide to consummate the deception, as was d=
one in the Goss-

Udderzook tragedy near Baltimore in 1872.  A celebrated case now before the=
 Supreme Court of=20

the United States and involving the question of personal identity is=20


_
the 26th day of March, 1402.=E2=80=99       THE REPLY OF KING HENRY TO THIS=
 SECOND LETTER OF=20

THE DUKE OF         ORLEANS.  =E2=80=98Henry, king of England and lord of I=
reland, to Louis de Valois,=20

duke of Orleans.  =E2=80=98We write to inform you, that we have received, t=
he last day of this present=20

month of April, the letter you have sent to us by Champagne king at arms an=
d your herald=20

Orleans, intending it as an answer to the one from us, received by you, on =
the 26th day of last=20

January, from the hands of Lancaster king at arms, our herald. Your letter =
is dated the 26th day of=20

March, in the year 1402, and we have heard its contents.  =E2=80=98Consider=
ing all things, more especially=20

the situation in which it has pleased God to place us, we ought not to make=
 you any reply to the=20

request you make, nor to the replications since your first letter. However,=
 as you attack our=20

honour, we send you this answer, recollecting we did reply to your first re=
quest, which you=20

pretended arose from the hot spirit of youth, and your earnest desire to ga=
in renown in arms. It=20

seems by your present letter, that this desire has taken a frivolous turn, =
and that you wish for a=20

war of words, thinking that by defaming our person, you may overwhelm us wi=
th confusion, which=20

God grant may fall, and more justly, on yourself! We are therefore moved, a=
nd not without cause,=20

to make answer to the principal points of your letter, in manner as will he=
reafter to you more plainly=20

appear, considering that it does not become our state nor honour to do so b=
y chiding; but in=20

respect to such frivolous points, replete with malice, we shall not condesc=
end to make any answer,=20

except declaring that all your reproaches are false.  =E2=80=98First, in re=
gard to the dignity we hold, that you=20

write you do not approve it, nor the manner by which we have obtained it. W=
e are certainly very=20

much surprised at this, for we made you fully acquainted with our intention=
s before we departed=20

from France; at which time you approved of it, and even promised us aid aga=
inst our very dear=20

lord and cousin, king Richard, whom God pardon! We would not accept of your=
 assistance; and=20

we hold your approbation or disapprobation of our undertaking of little wor=
th, since it has pleased=20

God, by his gracious favour, to approve of it, as well as the inhabitants o=
f our kingdom. This is a=20

sufficient reply to such as would deny our right,=E2=80=94and I am confiden=
t in the benign grace of God,=20

who has hitherto guarded us, that he will continue his gracious mercy and b=
ring the matter to so=20

happy a conclusion that you shall be forced to acknowledge the dignity we e=
njoy, and the right we=20

have to it.  =E2=80=98In regard to that passage in your letter, where you s=
peak of the decease of our very=20

dear cousin and lord, whom God pardon! adding, God knows how it happened, a=
nd by whom=20

caused,=E2=80=94we know not with what intent this expression has been used;=
 but if you mean, or dare to=20

say, that his death was caused by our order or consent, it is false, and wi=
ll be a falsehood every=20

time you utter it,=E2=80=94and this we are ready to prove, through the grac=
e of God, in personal combat, if=20

you be willing and have the courage to dare it.  =E2=80=98As to your saying=
, that you would have preserved=20

the alliance made between us, if we had not undertaken such offensive measu=
res against our very=20

dear lord and cousin, who was so intimately related to your lord and brothe=
r by marriage Insurance=20

Company of New York, the New York Life Insurance Company, and the Connectic=
ut Mutual Life=20

Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut (Consolidated), plaintiffs in er=
ror, vs. Sallie E.=20

Hillmon.  It is pre-eminently in criminal trials that the personal identity=
 of the victim often constitutes=20

an essential connecting link. Before it can move, the law requires, at the =
outset, proof of the=20

individuality of both the author of a crime and of the victim. I shall, the=
refore, not touch upon such=20

elusive individuals as Charlie Ross and Jack the Ripper, but limit my remar=
ks to a synthetical=20

exposition of the best-known facts regarding identification of the dead bod=
y and the interpretation=20



of its organic remains.  The identity of a living person, or even our own i=
dentity, is often a difficult=20

point to establish. It may also require medical evidence, oftentimes of a m=
ost involved character,=20

to establish the fact of death. Hence the medico-legal process of connectin=
g a dead body, or the=20

remains or traces of the same, with a human being once known to have lived =
and moved on earth,=20

is beset with difficulties that may give rise to still greater antagonisms =
of evidence. The question of=20

personal identity is one of the hardest that could possibly come before a c=
ourt. Celebrated cases=20

and judicial errors have given it great notoriety. There are consequently f=
ew questions in forensic=20

medicine that require more attention and sagacity, and none upon which the =
medical legist should=20

pronounce with more reserve and circumspection. Medical men are absolutely =
the _only_ persons=20

qualified to assist in resolving the really delicate question of personal i=
dentity; yet the physician=20

and the lawyer pursue the same line of logic and of inquiry. As the former =
must have a subject to=20

dissect or to operate upon, so must the lawyer in pursuing a criminal inves=
tigation first prove a=20

visible material substance known in legal phraseology as the _corpus delict=
i_, which he must=20

connect with some personality, with some human being once known to have liv=
ed. In this=20

important process the physician=E2=80=99s testimony being the indispensable=
 guide of the court=E2=80=99s inference,=20

he should limit himself to purely anatomical and material knowledge. The me=
dical expert has=20

absolutely nothing to do with guilt or innocence, as that is a question for=
 the jury. He should, above=20

all things, be absolutely free from prejudice, suspicion, or undue suggesti=
on, and should=20

remember that in thus sinking his personality his sole function as a skille=
d witness in cases of=20

identity is to furnish testimony which, when taken in connection with other=
 evidence in the case,=20

may establish such a _corpus delicti_ as would justify the inference of a c=
rime.  A nice point may=20

arise as to dispensing with the proof from the body itself, when the substa=
ntial general fact of a=20

homicide is proved _aliunde_, as in the case of a criminal causing the disa=
ppearance of his=20

victim=E2=80=99s body by means of its decomposition in lime or other chemic=
al menstrua, or by submerging=20

it in an unfathomable spot in the sea. Under circumstances such as the foll=
owing: a person is seen=20

to enter a building and is not seen to leave it, although all means of egre=
ss therefrom are watched;=20

another person is seen to ignite the building, which thereupon burns down, =
and the charred=20

remains of a human body are found in the=20


_
that at the time you made the alliance with us, you never imagined we shoul=
d have acted against=20

our very dear lord and cousin, as is publicly known to have been done by us=
,=E2=80=94we reply, we have=20

done nothing against him but what we would have dared to do before God and =
the whole world.=20

=E2=80=98You say, that we might itself might be dispensed with in view of t=
he substantial general fact of a=20

homicide having been committed. In a delicate case where the man of art hes=
itates and finds no=20

_corpus delicti_, the investigation of imprints and stains may give a clew =
of great value to the=20

expert. Yet it is only upon absolute=20


_
were excepted in it, and whether our very dear and well beloved cousin, the=
 lady Isabella, your=20

much honoured lady and niece, was not comprehended in those excepted. We kn=
ow that you=20

excepted them in general; but when, at your request, I entered into this al=
liance, you did not make=20

any specific exceptions of them, like to what you did respecting your fair =
uncle of Burgundy; and=20

yet the principal cause of your seeking our friendship, and requesting this=
 alliance to be made,=20

was your dislike to your uncle of Burgundy, which we can prove whenever we =
please, and then all=20

loyal men will see if you have not been defective in your conduct as to our=
 alliance; and though=20

hypocrisy that the fundamental principle of the _corpus delicti_ is disrega=
rded.  In the case of=20

Ruloff, the child=E2=80=99s body was not produced and no trace of it could =
be alleged to have been found;=20

nevertheless the prisoner was found guilty of murder. This case was speedil=
y overruled (18 N. Y.,=20

179), on the ground that a dangerous precedent had been pronounced.  So ind=
ispensable is the=20

showing of the _corpus delicti_ in cases of recognition that lawyers have c=
ome to regard even the=20

judicial confession of an accused as often the flimsiest and most unsatisfa=
ctory kind of evidence.=20

Numerous cases of demonstrated fallibility of confessions are cited in the =
books, where the=20

statement was=20


_
not avail before God, it may serve to blind mankind.  =E2=80=98When you mai=
ntain that, after you were=20

acquainted with the pretended act done by us against our aforesaid lord and=
 cousin, you lost all=20

hope that I would abide by any agreement entered into with you, or any othe=
r person, we must=20

suppose that you no longer wish to preserve any friendship with us; but we =
marvel greatly that=20

some time after we were lacking in anything except motive or hallucination.=
 In the Proceedings of=20

the New York Medico-Legal Society, December 6th, 1876, Mr. James Appleton M=
organ mentions=20

the case of a German servant-girl who assured her mistress, whose little bo=
y, a child of seven,=20

had just died and been buried, that she (the servant) had poisoned the boy.=
 The servant swore to=20

her crime and was taken into custody, and it=20


_
in possession of the dignity to which it has pleased God to raise us, you s=
hould send to us one of=20

your knights wearing your badges, to assure us that you were eager to remai=
n our very sincere=20

friend, and that, after your lord and brother, the friendship of no prince =
would be so agreeable to=20

you as ours. You charged him also to assure us, that the bonds of alliance =
between us only when=20

no poison was discovered upon exhuming the child=E2=80=99s body and examini=
ng its stomach that against=20

her own protest she was acquitted of the possibility of the crime. Another =
case of the kind that has=20

had medico-legal notoriety was tried a few years ago before a court in Brit=
tany. The accused=20

declared that he had killed his servant and thrown the body in a pond. His =
guilt=20


_
he said you would not that any Frenchman should know.  =E2=80=98You have af=
terward made us=20

acquainted, by some of our vassals, with your good inclinations, and the tr=
ue friendship you bore=20

us; but since you wish not any connexion with us, considering the state we =
hold, (such is your=20

expression) we know not why we should wish your friendship,=E2=80=94for wha=
t you formerly victim put in=20

an appearance, thus reducing the evidence to the strange hallucination that=
 had prompted the=20

confession.  But the most wonderful of these is the celebrated case of Boor=
n, in which medico-

legal evidence took no part. In view of the seeming hopelessness of his cas=
e, the accused=20

confessed to murder in expectation of mercy from the court, but=20
