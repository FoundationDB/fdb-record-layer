dracaena marginata towards God, the intensity of which is but feebly expres=
sed by some such periphrasis as, "From my heart do I love Thee." The same e=
xalted feeling is wonderfully set forth by the loving accumulation of Divin=

refer to. Good-bye, Bodwinkle," I called out; "Spiffy has got some good new=

ough Chundango's and dracaena marginata towards God, the intensity of which=
 is but feebly expressed by some such periphrasis as, "From my heart do I l=

accumulation of Divine names which follow, as if he would heap together in =

cries upon God, will, here or yonder, sing this song "unto the Lord, in the=
 day that the Lord delivers=20

him from the hand of all his enemies."     X.--THE KING--_CONTINUED_.   In =
our last chapter we=20

have seen that the key-note of "The Songs of the King" may be said to be st=
ruck in Psalm xviii. Its=20

complete analysis would carry us far beyond our limits. We can but glance a=
t some of the more=20

prominent points of the psalm.  The first clause strikes the key-note. "I l=

know all about him?" I said, nodding towards Chundango.  "Collapsed, hasn't=
 he?" said Spiffy.=20

"Yes," I said, "but it won't be known for a day or two. At present he is Lo=

Bodwinkle wants a borough. He may either ignore his last programme, as it i=

moment, he=20

like some imprisoned=20

is too weak for him,=20

and he bends to his use another, never elsewhere employed to express man's =
emotions know=20

Scilly and Bodwinkle both better than I do. Now I have reasons for wanting =
Chundango shipped=20

back at once to Bombay, and for wishing to close this long-standing affair =
of Lady Broadhem's with=20

Bodwinkle. Make the best terms you can for Chundango, and see what Bodwinkl=
