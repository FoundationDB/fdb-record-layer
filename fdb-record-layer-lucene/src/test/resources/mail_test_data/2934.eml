philodendron monstera that she was delivered of him within an hour after.--=
S. (B., Yahya.)  [331] Some say the Virgin Mary had really a brother named =
Aaron, who had the same father but a different mother: others suppose Aaron=
 the brother of Moses is here meant, but say Mary is called his sister eith=
er because she was of time, either; for we find them spinning, embroidering=
, or at least making garlands of flowers. We have a pretty picture in the _=
Roman de la Violette_ of a burgher's daughter "who sat in her father's cham=
ber, working a stole and amice in silk, with care and skill, and embroideri=
ng upon her work many a philodendron monstera that she was delivered of him=
 within an hour after.--S. (B., Yahya.)  [331] Some say the Virgin Mary had=

sat in her father's chamber, working a stole and amice in silk, with care a=

hole; and that Solomon distinguished the boys from the girls by the differe=
nt manner of their taking=20

water, and ordered one worm to bore the pearl, and another to pass a thread=
 through the onyx.--S.=20

(B.)  [318] Others, however, suppose it was El-Khidr, or else Gabriel, or s=
ome other angel; and=20

some imagine it to have been Solomon himself.--S. (B.)  [319] This fountain=
 they say was in El-

Yemen.--S. (B.)  [320] Some say these spirits made him two lions, which wer=
e placed at the foot of=20

his throne; and two eagles, which were set above it; and that when he mount=
ed it, the lions=20

stretched out their paws; and when he sat down, the eagles shaded him with =
their wings.--S. (B.)=20

[321] The commentators to explain this passage tell us that David, having l=
aid the foundations of=20

the Temple of Jerusalem, which was to be in lieu of the tabernacle of Moses=
, when he died, left it=20

to be finished by his son Solomon, who employed the genii in the work; that=
 Solomon, before the=20

edifice was quite completed, perceiving his end drew nigh, begged of God th=
at his death might be=20

concealed from the genii till they had entirely finished it; that God there=
fore so ordered it that=20

Solomon died as he stood at his prayers, leaning on his staff, which suppor=
ted the body in that=20

posture a full year; and the genii, supposing him to be alive, continued th=
eir work during that term,=20

at the expiration whereof, the temple being perfectly completed, a worm, wh=
ich had gotten into the=20

staff, ate it through, and the corpse fell to the ground and discovered the=
 king's death.--S. (B.,=20

Jelal.)  [322] It is said that the fish, after it had swallowed Jonah, swam=
 after the ship with its head=20

above water, that the prophet might breathe; who continued to praise God ti=
ll the fish came to land=20

and vomited him out.--S.  [323] Sale states that some imagine Jonah's plant=
 to have been a fig;=20

and others, the moz (or banana), which bears very large leaves and excellen=
t fruit.  [324] The=20

commentators add that this plant withered the next morning, and that Jonah =
being much=20

concerned at it God made a remonstrance to him in behalf of the Ninevites, =
agreeably to what is=20

recorded in Scripture.--S.  [325] When he first began to exhort them to rep=
entance, instead of=20

hearkening to him, they used him very ill, so that he was obliged to leave =
the city, threatening=20

them at his departure that they should be destroyed within three days, or, =
as others say, within=20

forty. But when the time drew near, and they saw the heavens overcast with =
a black cloud which=20

shot forth fire and filled the air with smoke and hung directly over the ci=
ty, they were in a terrible=20

consternation, and getting into the fields, with their families and cattle,=
 they put on sackcloth and=20

humbled themselves before God, calling aloud for pardon and sincerely repen=
ting of their past=20

wickedness. Whereupon God was pleased to forgive them, and the storm blew o=
ver.--S. (B., Jelal,=20

A.F.)  [326] 'Imran, as observed by Sale, is the name of two several person=
s according to the=20

Muslims: one was the father of Moses and Aaron, and the other was the fathe=
r of the Virgin Mary.=20

The latter is here meant, and his wife's name was Hannah.  [327] Or the dev=
il driven away with=20

stones.--See note 1. eight hundred knights, "and there was not a one who di=
d not have lady or=20

maiden to eat from his porringer." There was great profusion if not great d=
elicacy upon the table;=20

we shall content ourselves with echoing what Philippe de Beaumanoir says: "=
If I undertook to=20

describe the dishes they had I should stop here forever.... Each had as muc=
h as he wished and=20

whatever he wished: meats, fowls, venison, or fish cooked in many styles." =
 [Illustration 4: LADIES=20

HUNTING. After the painting by Henri Genois. Sometimes brawls followed the =
too free use of=20

wine, as one romance tells us "you might see them throw at each other chees=
es, and big quartern-

loaves, and hunks of meat, and sharp steel knives." But sometimes the ladie=
s strolled off into the=20

gardens and played games--blindman's-buff, or frog-in-the-middle, or the li=
ke--or sang to the harp,=20



or sewed. A great deal of time, indeed, was spent out of doors, not only in=
 the gentler field sports,=20

such as hawking, in which ladies participated, but also in the mere routine=
 of daily life. In the=20

romances many a scene of revelry as well as of love making takes place unde=
r the trees; and the=20

ladies are not always idling away their time, either; for we find them spin=
ning, embroidering, or at=20

least making garlands of flowers.]  Upon a table so appointed and served we=
 can understand that=20

some of the cautions of Robert de Blois to the ladies would be most useful.=
 "In eating you must=20

avoid much laughing or talking. If you eat with another (out of the same _e=
cuelle_), turn the nicest=20

bits to him, and do not pick out the finest and largest for yourself, which=
 is not good manners.=20

Moreover, no one should try to devour a choice bit which is too large or to=
o hot, for fear of choking=20

or burning herself.... Each time you drink, wipe your mouth well, that no g=
rease may go into the=20

wine, which is very unpleasant to the person who drinks after you. But when=
 you wipe your mouth=20

after drinking, do not wipe your eyes or nose with the tablecloth, and take=
 care not to get your=20

hands too greasy or let your mouth spill too much." The really well-bred la=
dy, then, must be like=20

Chaucer's Prioress:          "At mete was she wel ytaughte withalle;       =
  She lette no morsel from=20

hire lippes falle,         Ne wette hire fingres in hire sauce depe.       =
  Wel coude she carie a morsel,=20

and wel kepe,         Thatte no drope ne fell upon hire brest.         In c=
urtesie was sette ful moche=20

hire lest.         Hire over lippe wiped she so clene,         That in hire=
 cuppe was no ferthing sene=20

Of grese, when she dronken hadde hire draught.         Ful semely after hir=
e mete she raught."=20

One might almost fancy that old Dan Chaucer, the first humorist of modern t=
imes, was copying=20

from and slyly poking fun at our friend Robert de Blois and his fine lady. =
         "Quant mengie=20

eurent, si laverent.         Li menestrel dont en alerent         Cascuns a=
 son mestier servir."  (When=20

they had eaten, they washed their hands; then the minstrels began, each doi=
ng that which he=20

could do best.) The tables cleared, the guests, the ladies not excepted, wa=
tched the tricks of the=20

jugglers and tumblers, listened to the minstrels, or told tales, nearly all=
 of which were horribly=20


_
[328] And for this reason, they say, neither of them was guilty of any sin,=
 like the rest of the=20

children of Adam.--S. (Katadeh.)  [329] That is, between thirty, or thirty-=
four, and fifty-one: and the=20

passage may relate to Christ's preaching here on earth. But as he had scarc=
e attained this age=20

when he was taken up into heaven, the commentators choose to understand it =
of his second=20

coming.--S.  [330] The age of the Virgin Mary at the time of her conception=
 was thirteen, or, as=20

others say, ten; and she went six, seven, eight, or nine months with him, a=
ccording to different=20

traditions; though some say the wine, as one romance tells us "you might se=
e them throw at each=20

other cheeses, and big quartern-loaves, and hunks of meat, and sharp steel =
knives." But=20

sometimes the ladies strolled off into the gardens and played games--blindm=
an's-buff, or frog-in-

the-middle, or the like--or sang to the harp, or sewed. A great deal of tim=

as well as of love making=20
