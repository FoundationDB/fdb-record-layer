single-barrel rifle; this was in two pieces; I mended it, and it become str=
onger than ever. The wood=20

had broken short off in the neck of the stock, I therefore bored a hole abo=
ut three inches deep up=20

the centre of either piece, so that it was hollowed like a marrow-bone; in =
one of them I inserted a=20

piece of an iron ramrod, red-hot, I then drew the other piece over the iron=
 in a similar manner, and=20

gently tapped the shoulder-plate until I had driven the broken joint firmly=
 together. I then took off=20

from a couple of old boxes two strong brass hasps; these I let neatly into =
the wood on each side of=20

the broken stock, and secured them by screws, filing off all projections, s=
o that they fitted exactly. I=20

finished the work by stretching a piece of well-soaked crocodile's skin ove=
r the joint, which, when=20

drawn tight, I sewed strongly together. When this dried it became as hard a=
s horn, and very much=20

stronger; the extreme contraction held the work together like a vice, and m=
y rifle was perfectly=20

restored. A traveller in wild countries should always preserve sundry treas=
ures that will become=20

invaluable, such as strips of crocodile skin, the hide of the iguana, &c. w=

hes in length, and one=20

ade, with an extra=20

supply of gimlets, awls, centre-bits, and borers of every description, also=
 tools for boring iron; at=20

least two dozen files of different sorts should be included."  Wat el Negur=
 was governed by a most=20

excellent and polite sheik of the Jalyn tribe. Sheik Achmet Wat el Negur wa=
s his name and title;=20

being of the same race as Mek Nimmur, he dared to occupy the east bank of t=
he Atbara. Sheik=20

Achmet was a wise man; he was a friend of the Egyptian authorities, to whom=
 he paid tribute as=20

though it were his greatest pleasure; he also paid tribute to Mek Nimmur, w=
ith whom he was upon=20

the best of terms; therefore, in the constant fights that took place upon t=
he borders, the cattle and=20

people of Sheik Achmet were respected by the contending parties, while thos=
e of all others were=20

sufferers. This was exactly the spot for my head-quarters, as, like Sheik A=
chmet, I wished to be on=20

good terms with everybody, and through him I should be able to obtain an in=
troduction to Mek=20

Nimmur, whom I particularly wished to visit, as I had heard that there neve=
r was such a brigand.=20

Accordingly, I pitched the tents and formed a camp upon the bank of the riv=
er, about two hundred=20

yards below the village of Wat el Negur, and in a short time Sheik Achmet a=
nd I became the=20

greatest friends.  There is nothing more delightful when travelling in a st=

imprinted deeply upon the minds and recollections of the people, the good c=

visited Wat el Negur, Mr.=20

Mansfield Parkyns, who has certainly written the best book on Abyssinia tha=
t I have ever read,=20

passed through this country, having visited Mek Nimmur, the father of the p=
resent Mek. He was, I=20

believe, the only European that had ever been in Mek Nimmur's territory, ne=
ither had his footsteps=20

been followed until my arrival. Mr. Parkyns had left behind him what the Ar=
abs call a "sweet=20

name;" and as I happened to have his book, "Life in Abyssinia," with me, I =
showed it to the sheik=20

as his production, and explained the illustrations, &c.; at the same time I=
 told him that Mr. Parkyns=20

FOREWORD   At the Church Congress held this autumn at Birmingham I was hono=
ured by an=20

invitation to speak on "Sexual Relationships."  The subject-matter of that =
speech has aroused=20

widespread interest and some controversy. It is being published in response=
 to numerous requests=20

and because most of the reports, being of necessity condensed, inadequately=
 and even in some=20

instances incorrectly set forth the views I endeavoured to champion; for an=
y speech on a subject=20

so difficult to handle needs to be read in its entirety if misapprehensions=
 are to be avoided.  And=20

first, may I thank numerous correspondents; and those in disagreement equal=
ly with those in=20

agreement with me. One and all they bear testimony, if indeed such were nee=
ded, to how=20

widespread and responsible is the interest on this question, and therefore =
to the wisdom of its full=20

consideration. Amongst the letters are intimate human documents which pathe=
tically disclose, as=20

does professional experience, how frequently happiness is marred by ignoran=
ce of either the=20

principles or the methods which=20


_
in person how much his good reception had been appreciated. The good Sheik =
Achmet=20

immediately promised to present me to Mek Nimmur, and wished particularly t=
o know whether I=20

intended to write a book like Mr. Parkyns upon my return. Should I do so, h=
e requested me to=20

mention HIS name. I promised at once to do this trifling favour; thus I hav=
e the greatest pleasure in=20

certifying that Sheik Achmet Wat el Negur is one of the best and most agree=
able fellows that I=20

have ever met in Africa; he does not keep an hotel, or I would strongly rec=
ommend it to all=20

travellers, but his welcome is given gratis, with the warmest hospitality. =
 The relationships.  I=20

elected to deal with these relationships in their healthy rather than their=
 morbid aspects, because=20

the study of health is a sure way to lessen disease. Mere denunciations of =
evil serve but small=20

purpose. The aim of statesmanship is rather to seek out causes and ponder o=
ver remedies, and=20

prominent among remedies is surely the study of the significance and purpor=
t of sex love in a well-

ordered and Christian community and provision for its healthy outlet. To th=
is the first part of my=20

speech was devoted. The view there upheld has brought forth a large measure=
 of agreement and=20

no reasoned disagreement.  The second part=20


_
Negur was highly cultivated, and several thousand acres were planted with d=
hurra, that was at this=20

season in full grain, and nearly ripe. Much sesame was grown for the manufa=
cture of oil; cotton=20

was also cultivated, and the neighbourhood was a fair example of the wonder=
ful capabilities of the=20

entire country that was allowed to lie in idleness. There was little rest f=
or the inhabitants at this=20

time, as the nights were spent in watching their extensive plantations, and=
 endeavouring to scare=20

away the elephants. These animals, with extreme cunning, invaded the dhurra=
 crops at different=20

positions every night, and retreated before morning to great distances in t=
he thick thorny jungles of=20

the Settite.  Our arrival was welcomed with general enthusiasm, as the Arab=
s were unprovided=20

with fire-arms, and the celebrated aggageers or sword-hunters were useless,=
 as the elephants=20

only appeared at night, and were far too cunning to give them a chance. The=
re was a particular=20

range of almost impenetrable thorny covert in the neighbourhood of Geera, w=
ell known as the=20

asylum for these animals, to which they retreated, after having satiated th=
emselves by a few=20

hours' feeding upon the crops of corn. I promised to assist in protecting t=
he plantations, although=20

the Arabs assured me that, in spite of our rifles, the elephants would retu=
rn every night.  Wishing=20

to judge personally of the damage, I rode up to the dhurra-fields, and for =
a few hours I examined=20

the crops, through which I could ride with ease, as the plants were arrange=
d like hops.  Many=20

acres were absolutely destroyed, as the elephants had not only carefully st=
ripped off the heavy=20

heads of corn, but had trampled down and wilfully broken much more than the=
y had consumed.=20

The Arabs knew nothing about guns, or their effect upon elephants, and I fe=
lt quite sure that a few=20

nights with the heavy rifles would very soon scare them from the fields.  I=
 return to my journal.=20

"November 7.--In the middle of last night I was disturbed by the Arabs, who=
 begged me to get up=20

and shoot the elephants that were already in the plantations. This I refuse=
d to do, as I will not fire a=20

shot until they call in their watchers, and leave the fields quiet. A few n=
ights ago there was a=20

perfect uproar from a score of watchers, that prevented the elephants from =
coming at the very time=20

that the people had induced me to pass the whole night in the fields. I hav=
e arranged that the=20

sheik shall call in all these watchers, and that they shall accompany me to=
-morrow night. I will then=20

post myself in the centre of the plantations, dividing the men into many pa=
rties at all points, to=20

return quietly to me and report the position that the elephants may have ta=
ken.  "This morning I=20

purchased a kid for two piastres (five pence). The sheik is exceedingly civ=
il, and insists upon=20

sending me daily supplies of milk and vegetables.  "This afternoon, accompa=
nied by my wife, I=20

accepted an invitation to shoot a savage old bull hippopotamus that had bee=
n sufficiently=20

impertinent to chase several of the natives. He lived in a deep and broad p=
ortion of the river, about=20

two miles distant. We accordingly rode to the spot, and found the old hippo=
 at home. The river was=20

about 250 yards wide at this place, in an acute bend that had formed a deep=
 pool. In the centre of=20

this was a mud bank, just below the surface; upon this shallow bed the hipp=
o was reposing. Upon=20

perceiving us he was exceedingly saucy, snorting at my party, and behaving =
himself in a most=20

absurd manner, by shaking his head and leaping half-way out of the water. T=
his plunging strict=20

accuracy should be called conception control) has aroused more controversy,=
 but I venture to=20

think that some, at least, of the criticism directed against my argument wi=
ll disappear with a=20

perusal of this full text of my speech. Therein will be found condemnation =
of infertile marriages and=20

a strong plea that children are essential to the health and happiness of ma=
n and woman, are=20

necessary to each other and of vital importance to the nation.  The differe=
nce between my critics=20



and myself is not as to the vital necessity of the family following marriag=
e, but rather this--they=20

would like to see the large families prevalent fifty years ago restored (an=
d where means and=20

circumstances are favourable, such large families may be the source of much=
 happiness);=20

whereas under present-day conditions I should regard them as seldom attaina=
ble and desirable,=20

and would favour smaller families of children born at predetermined interva=
ls.  A married couple=20

who have produced four children in twenty years cannot be said to have igno=
red the precept "be=20

fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth" because they have so selecte=
d the times for the=20

conceptions of their children as to enable them to give those children a be=
tter upbringing rather=20

than have selfishly left the sequence of their offspring to blind chance.  =
The argument that the=20

nation should foster large families in order more quickly to people the unt=
enanted portions of the=20

Empire, and so add to the strength and wealth of the British Dominions, req=
uires serious attention,=20

not in isolation, but in conjunction with other considerations, and calls f=
orth varying opinions from=20

economists.  On the other hand, emigration into _foreign_ lands would seem =
to be a source of=20

weakness to a nation. The feeding, clothing and educating of a young Briton=
 cost the nation a=20

definite sum of money, say, L400; if at the age of twenty, when he is ready=
 to produce, that young=20

Briton emigrates to a foreign state, he is a definite loss to the country o=
f his birth and the country of=20

his adoption is the gainer.  From another standpoint the criticism is made =
that I have not urged the=20

paramount necessity of diminishing the population of these islands. With th=
e economic soundness=20

of this view others are better fitted to deal, but no economic consideratio=
ns would outweigh the=20

importance of child life inspiring the homes of the land, and if the number=
 and sequence of=20

children can be regulated by the parents' circumstances, these homes will i=
ncrease in number, will=20

start when parents are younger and confer greater benefits alike on the fam=
ily and the State. If=20

need be, the State could grant a progressive rebate of taxation, and educat=
ional facilities for each=20

of three children born after the second and where the father is twenty-five=
 years of age or=20

upwards.  It is held by some that artificial birth control is contrary to C=
hristian morals. This is the=20

view firmly held by the Roman Catholic Church, and since the governance of =
the Roman=20

communion is based on "authority," its decisions are binding on its members=
 and command our=20

respect. But pronouncements of Protestant communions do not owe their force=
 to "authority," but=20

to the conviction they carry in the minds and consciences of their people, =
and no clear scriptural=20

sanction for the condemnation of birth control has been given, nor does the=
 report of the Lambeth=20

Conference vouchsafe any reasons why it is physically and morally harmful. =
 A distinguished=20

prelate of our Church has characterised the views herein set forth as "very=
 unguarded."[1] If by=20

that expression he=20


_
I had previously given Bacheet a pistol, and had ordered him to follow on t=
he opposite bank from=20

the ford at Wat el Negur. I now hallooed to him to fire several shots at th=
e hippo, in order to drive=20

him, if possible, towards me, as I lay in ambush behind a rock in the bed o=
f the river. Bacheet=20

descended the almost perpendicular bank to the water's edge, and after havi=
ng chaffed the hippo=20

considerably, he fired a shot with the pistol, which was far more dangerous=
 to us on the opposite=20

side than to the animal. The hippo, who was a wicked solitary old bull, acc=
ustomed to have his=20

own way, returned the insult by charging towards Bacheet with a tremendous =
snorting, that sent=20

him scrambling up the steep bank in a panic, amidst a roar of laughter from=
 the people on my side=20

concealed in the bushes. In "careless," he cannot have done me the honour o=
f reading my=20

speech, which, whatever its demerits, bears ample evidence of carefully con=
sidered thought and=20

expression. If by "unguarded" he means "outspoken," I will plead justificat=
ion. For is it not time that=20

a question which deeply concerns not only the thought, but the practice of =
the thinking portions of=20

communities should be fully considered and its strength and its weakness di=
sclosed by full=20

discussion? The world looks to its leaders for reasoned guidance, not for a=
ssertion which may be=20

but the husk of a thought that has gone. What is wanted is reasoned conside=
ration, not=20

unreasoned condemnation. For churchmen and statesmen alike, opportunism hel=
ps in situations=20

which are small, but never in those which are large; there clarity of=20
