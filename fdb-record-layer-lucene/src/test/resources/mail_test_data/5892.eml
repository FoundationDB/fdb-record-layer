asked my father if I could go the first chance I got. He said I could, and now I've got the chance." 

"What are those bad lands?" asked Fred Kaler. "Any Indians out there?"  "Some, I guess. A few 

Sioux, Crows and some Shoshones. But they're mostly guides. You see, bad lands are what the 

Westerners call a region that isn't very good for anything but hunting. They consist of a lot of 

sandstone peaks, with deserts here and there."  "And what can you hunt there?" asked Nat.  "Oh, 

lots of things. Big-horn sheep, bears, elk, deer, jack-rabbits and birds. It will be lots of sport." 

"Wyoming, eh?" mused Sam. "That's quite a way off."  "Yes, it is, but we've got lots of time. I've 

been making some inquiries, and they say the best spot to aim for is around the town of Cody, 

which is named after Buffalo Bill. You see, we can go to Fort Custer, and from there we have to 

travel in wagons or on horses. I've got a route all mapped out. We'll go along a small stream, 

called Sage Creek, across the Forty-mile Desert, and hunt along the Shoshone River, near Heart 

Mountain. It's a fine hunting ground, and we'll have no end of fun camping out."  "But it'll be cold," 

objected Bony. "There'll be snow."  "What of it?" asked Jack. "It'll do you good. We'll have warm 

tents, warm clothing, and we can build big camp fires that will make the ones here look like a baby 

bonfire."  "Galloping gasmeters!" exclaimed Nat. "When can we start, Jack?"  "Oh, it'll take some 

time to get ready. We've got to get the guns and camping outfit together."  The boys talked for 

some considerable time about the prospective trip. Socker, meanwhile, came in to replenish the 

fire. In some of the rooms there were stoves and gas heaters, and these were soon in operation to 

take the chill off the apartments, for the big building, being without steam heat, was like a barn. 

Budge Rankin came in once with some logs for the fire.  "Goinome?" he said to Jack.  "Going 

home?" repeated our hero. "That's what I am, Budge. Are you?"  "SoonsIkin."  "As soon as you 

can, eh? Well, it will be this afternoon for mine," went on Jack. "Can't stay here and freeze."  Dr. 

Mead and his assistants were busy arranging for the departure of the pupils, while the head of the 

school also telegraphed for new parts of the damaged boiler.  Jack and Nat packed their 

belongings, and prepared to start for Denton.  "Say, who all are going camping and hunting?" 

asked Nat, pausing in the act of thrusting his clothes into his trunk.  "Why, I was thinking if we 

could take the same crowd we had before you and I were captured and taken aboard the _Polly 

Ann_ this summer, it would be nice," replied Jack. "There's you and Bony and Sam and me."  "And 

Budge."  "Oh, yes, Budge. I'll take him along if he'll go. He likes to putter around camp, but he 

doesn't care much about hunting. He'd rather chew gum."  Though Budge worked as assistant 

janitor at Washington Hall, Jack and his chums did not consider that his position was at all 

degrading. Jack felt that Budge was one of his best friends, and though the lad was poor he was 

independent, which quality Jack liked in him.  "And I tell you some one else I'm going to take, if I 

can manage it," went on our hero.  "Who?"  "Bill Williams. I like that Shouts of war and victory rent 

the air. That night the king's blood mingled with the wine of the banquet hall. Judgment came upon 

him unexpectedly, suddenly: and probably ninety-nine out of every hundred judgments come in 

this way. Death comes upon us unexpectedly; it comes upon us suddenly.  Perhaps you say: "I 

hope Mr. Moody is not going to compare me with that heathen king."  I tell you that a man who 

does evil in these Gospel days is far worse than that king. We live in a land of Bibles. You can get 

the New Testament for a nickel, and if you haven't got a nickel you can get it for nothing. Many 

societies will be glad to give it to you free. We live in the full blaze of Calvary. We live on this side 

of the cross, but Belshazzar lived more than five hundred years on the other side. He never heard 



of Jesus Christ. He never heard about the Son of God. He never heard about God except, 

perhaps, in connection with his father's remarkable vision. He probably had no portion of the Bible, 

and if he had, probably he didn't believe it. He had no godly minister to point him to the Lamb of 

God.  Don't tell me that you are better than that king. I believe that he will rise in judgment and 

condemn many of us.  All this happened long centuries ago. Let us get down to this century, to this 

year, to ourselves. We will come to the present time. Let us imagine that now, while I am 

preaching, down come some balances from the throne of God. They are fastened to the very 

throne itself. It is a throne of equity, of justice. You and I must be weighed. I venture to say this 

would be a very solemn audience. There would be no trifling. There would be no indifference. No 

one would be thoughtless.  Some people have their own balances. A great many are making 

balances to be weighed in. But after all we must be weighed in God's balances, the balances of 

the sanctuary. It is a favorite thing with infidels to set their own standard, to measure themselves 

by other people. But that will not do in the Day of Judgment. Now we will use God's law as a 

balance weight. When men find fault with the lives of professing Christians, it is a tribute to the law 

of God.  "Tekel." It is a very short text. It is so short I am sure you will remember it: and that is my 

object, just to get people to remember God's own Word.  GOD'S HANDWRITING.  Let me call 

your attention to the fact that God wrote on the tables of stone at Sinai as well as on the wall of 

Belshazzar's palace.  These are the only messages to men that God has written with His own 

hand. He wrote the commandments out twice, and spoke them aloud in the hearing of Israel.  If it 

were known that God Himself was going to speak once again to man, what eagerness and 

excitement there would be. For nearly nineteen hundred years He has been silent. No inspired 

message has been added to the Bible for nearly nineteen hundred years. How eagerly all men 

would listen if God should speak once more. Yet men forget that the Bible is God's own Word, and 

that it is as truly His message to-day as when it was delivered of old. The law that was given at 

Sinai has lost none of its solemnity. Time cannot wear out its authority or the fact of its authorship. 

I can imagine some one saying--"I won't be

like to do something for him, and I'm going to ask him to come hunting with us."  "S'pose he'll go?" 

"I don't know. Guess I'll go ask him now. Say, you finish crowding my stuff into my trunk, will you? 

We want to catch the twelve o'clock train for Denton."  "Sure," agreed Nat, ending his packing by 

the simple process of crowding all that remained of his clothes into the trunk and then jumping on 

them with both feet, so that they would collapse sufficiently to allow the lid to fasten.  Jack found 

the new boy sitting in his room beside his trunk and valise.  "All ready to go home?" asked Jack. 

"Yes," was the answer in a sad sort of voice.  "Why, you don't seem to be very glad that school 

has closed, giving you an additional vacation," remarked Jack.  "I'm not."  "Why?"  "Because I've 

got to go and live don't believe in it."  Now men may cavil as much as they like about other parts of 

the Bible, but I have never met an honest man that found fault with the Ten Commandments. 

Infidels may mock the Lawgiver and reject Him who has delivered us from the curse of the law, but 

they can't help admitting that the commandments are right. Renan said that they are for all 

nations, and will remain the commandments of God during all the centuries.  If God created this 

world, He must make some laws to govern it. In order to make life safe we must have good laws; 

there is not a country the sun shines upon that does not possess laws. Now this is God's law. It 

has come from on high, and infidels and skeptics have to admit that it is pure. Legislatures nearly 

all over the world adopt it as the foundation of their legal

than you did. I was beginning to like it here, but now I've got to go back. It's tough!"  "Say, how 

would you like to come with me?"  "Come with you? Where?"  "Hunting in the Shoshone 

Mountains."  "Do you mean it?" asked Will eagerly, his eyes  "The law of the Lord is perfect, 

converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is pure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the 

Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." 

Now the question for you and me is--are we keeping these commandments? Have we fulfilled all

to form a sort of gun club, and I'd like to include you in it. Will you come?"  "Will I come? Say, I----" 

Then the lad paused. The light faded from his eyes. He sank back into his chair.  "No--no," he said 

slowly. "I'm much obliged, but I--I guess I can't we know He did, He had a right to make that law; 

and if we don't use it aright it would have been better for us if we had never had it, for it will 

condemn us. We shall be found wanting. The law is all right, but are we right?  AN INFIDEL'S
