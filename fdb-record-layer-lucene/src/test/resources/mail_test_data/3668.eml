onstituted, the cycle=20

of the Gods had all the qualities and attributes of the ONE SUPREME AND UNK=
NOWABLE; for in=20

this collection of divine Personalities, or rather of Symbols personified, =
dwells the ONE GOD, the=20

GOD ONE, that God which, in India, is said to have no Second.       O God A=
ni [the Spiritual Sun],=20

thou residest in the agglomeration     of thy divine personages.(817)   The=
se words show the belief=20

of the ancients that all manifestation proceeds from one and the same Sourc=
e, all emanating from=20

the one identical Principle which can never be completely developed except =
in and through the=20

collective and entire aggregate of Its emanations.  The Pleroma of Valentin=
us is absolutely the=20

Space of Occult Philosophy; for Pleroma means the "Fullness," the superior =
regions. It is the sum=20

total of all the Divine manifestations and emanations expressing the _plenu=
m_ or totality of the=20

rays proceeding from the ONE, differentiating on all the planes, and transf=
orming themselves into=20

Divine Powers, called Angels and Planetary Spirits in the Philosophy of eve=
ry nation. The Gnostic=20

AEons and Powers of the Pleroma are made to speak as the Devas and Siddhas =
of the=20

_Puranas_. The Epinoia, the first female manifestation of God, the "Princip=
le" of Simon Magus and=20

Saturninus, holds the same language as the Logos of Basilides; and each of =
these is traced to the=20

purely esoteric Aletheia, the TRUTH of the Mysteries. All of them, we are t=
aught, repeat at=20

different times and in different languages the magnificent hymn of the Egyp=
tian papyrus,=20

thousands of years old:       The Gods adore thee, they greet thee, O the O=
ne Dark Truth.   And=20

addressing Ra, they add:       The Gods bow before thy Majesty, by exalting=
 the Souls of that=20

which produces them ... and say to thee, Peace to all emanations     from t=
he Unconscious Father=20

of the Conscious Fathers of the     Gods.... Thou producer of beings, we ad=
ore the souls which=20

emanate     from thee. Thou begettest us, O thou Unknown, and we greet thee=
 in     worshipping=20

each God-Soul which descendeth from thee  During this storm, Gondy, who had=
 it in his power to=20

make it most unpleasant for the jesters, remained calm and stern. The queen=
 at last asked him if=20

he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her.  "Yes=
, madame," replied the=20

coadjutor; "I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in=
 the kingdom."  The queen=20

turned her back and the laughing recommenced.  The coadjutor bowed and left=
 the palace, casting=20

upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes. That =
glance was so sharp=20

that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin, who, reading in it a declaration o=
f war, seized D'Artagnan=20

by the arm and said:  "If occasion requires, monsieur, you will remember th=
at man who has just=20

gone out, will you not?"  "Yes, my lord," he replied. Then, turning toward =
Porthos, "The devil!" said=20

he, "this has a bad look. I dislike these quarrels among men of the church.=
"  Gondy withdrew,=20

distributing benedictions on his way, and finding a malicious satisfaction =
in causing the adherents=20

of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet.  "Oh!" he murmured, as he =
left the threshold of the=20

palace: "ungrateful court! faithless court! cowardly court! I will teach yo=
u how to laugh to-morrow--

but in another manner."  But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy =
at the Palais Royal, to=20

increase the hilarity of the queen, Mazarin, a man of sense, and whose fear=
, moreover, gave him=20

foresight, lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes; he went out aft=
er the coadjutor, settled=20

his account, locked up his gold, and had confidential workmen to contrive h=
iding places in his=20

walls.  On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had =
come in after his=20

departure and was waiting for him; he started with delight when, on demandi=
ng the name of this=20

young man, he learned that it was Louvieres. He hastened to his cabinet. Br=
oussel's son was=20



there, still furious, and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with t=
he king's officers. The only=20

precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arq=
uebuse in the hands of=20

a friend.  The coadjutor went to him=20


_
us.   This is the source of the assertion:       Know ye not that ye are Go=
ds and the temple of God.=20

This is shown in the "Roots of Ritualism in Church and Masonry," in _Lucife=
r_ for March, 1889.=20

Truly then, as said seventeen centuries ago, "Man cannot possess Truth (Ale=
theia) except he=20

participate in the Gnosis." So we may say now: No man can know the Truth un=
less he studies the=20

secrets of the Pleroma of Occultism; and these secrets are all in the Theog=
ony of the ancient=20

Wisdom-Religion, which is the Aletheia of Occult Science.     Paper III. A =
Word Concerning the=20

Earlier Papers.   As many have written and almost complained to me that the=
y could find no=20

practical clear application of certain diagrams appended to the first two P=
apers, and others have=20

spoken of their abstruseness, a short explanation is necessary.  The reason=
 of this difficulty in=20

most cases has been that the point of view taken was erroneous; the purely =
abstract and=20

metaphysical was mistaken for, and confused with, the concrete and the phys=
ical. Let us take for=20

example the diagrams on page 477 (Paper II.,) and say that these are entire=
ly macrocosmic and=20

ideal. It must be remembered that the study of Occultism proceeds from Univ=
ersals to Particulars=20

and not the reverse way, as accepted by Science. As Plato was an Initiate, =
he very naturally used=20

the former method, while Aristotle, never having been initiated, scoffed at=
 his master, and,=20

elaborating a system of his own, left it as an heirloom to be adopted and i=
mproved by Bacon. Of a=20

truth the aphorism of Hermetic Wisdom, "As above, so below," applies to all=
 Esoteric instruction;=20

but we must begin with the above; we must learn the formula before we can s=
um the series.  The=20

two figures, therefore, are not meant to represent any two particular plane=
s, but are the abstraction=20

of a pair of planes, explanatory of the law of reflection, just as the Lowe=
r Manas is a reflection of=20

the Higher. They must therefore be taken in the highest metaphysical sense.=
  The diagrams are=20

only intended to familiarize students with him as if he would have read the=
 secret of his heart.  "My=20

dear Monsieur Louvieres," said the coadjutor, "believe me, I am truly conce=
rned for the misfortune=20

which has happened to you."  "Is that true, and do you speak seriously?" as=
ked Louvieres.  "From=20

the depth of my heart," said Gondy.  "In that case, my lord, the time for w=
ords has passed and the=20

hour for action is at hand; my lord, in three days, if you wish it, my fath=
er will be out of prison and=20

in six months you may be cardinal."  The coadjutor started.  "Oh! let us sp=
eak frankly," continued=20

Louvieres, "and act in a straightforward manner. Thirty thousand crowns in =
alms is not given, as=20

you have done for the last six months, out of pure Christian charity; that =
would be too grand. You=20

are ambitious--it is natural; you are a man of genius and you know your wor=
th. As for me, I hate=20

the court and have but one desire at this moment--vengeance. Give us the cl=
ergy and the people,=20

of whom you can dispose, and I will bring you the citizens and the parliame=
nt; with these four=20

elements Paris is ours in a week; and believe me, monsieur coadjutor, the c=
ourt will give from fear=20

what it will not give from good-will."  It was now the coadjutor's turn to =
fix his piercing eyes on=20

Louvieres.  "But, Monsieur Louvieres, are you aware that it is simply civil=
 war you are proposing to=20

me?"  "You have been preparing long enough, my lord, for it to be welcome t=
o you now."  "Never=20

mind," said the coadjutor; "you must be well aware that this requires refle=
ction."  "And how many=20

hours of reflection do you ask?"  "Twelve hours, sir; is it too long?"  "It=
 is now noon; at midnight I=20

will be at your house."  "If I should not be in, wait for me."  "Good! at m=
idnight, my lord."  "At=20

midnight, my dear Monsieur Louvieres."  When once more alone Gondy sent to =
summon all the=20

curates with whom he had any connection to his house. Two hours later, thir=
ty officiating ministers=20

from the most populous, and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Par=
is had assembled=20



there. Gondy related to them the insults he had=20


_
ideas of Occult correspondences, the very genius of metaphysical, or macroc=
osmic and spiritual=20

Occultism forbidding the use of figures or even symbols further than as tem=
porary aids. Once=20

define an idea in words, and it loses its reality; once figure a metaphysic=
al idea, and you=20

materialize its spirit. Figures must be used only as ladders to scale the b=
attlements, ladders to be=20

disregarded when once the foot is set upon the rampart.  Let students, ther=
efore, be very careful to=20

spiritualize the Papers and avoid materializing them; let them always try t=
o find the highest=20

meaning possible, confident that in proportion as they the Count de Villero=
y and Marechal de la=20

Meilleraie. The curates asked him what was to be done.  "Simply this," said=
 the coadjutor. "You=20

are the directors of all consciences. Well, undermine in them the miserable=
 prejudice of respect=20

and fear of kings; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant; and repeat=
 often and loudly, so that=20

all may know it, that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin, her =
lover and her=20

destroyer; begin this work to-day, this instant even, and in three days I s=
hall expect the result. For=20

the rest, if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound, I wi=
ll listen to him with the=20


_
visible in their speculations on the Papers, so far are they from the right=
 understanding of them.=20

This is especially the case with these first Papers and Diagrams, for as in=
 all true arts, so in=20

Occultism, we must first learn the theory before we are taught the practice=
.    Concerning Secrecy.=20

Students ask: Why such secrecy about the details of a doctrine the body of =
which has been=20

publicly revealed, as in _Esoteric Buddhism_ and the _Secret Doctrine_?  To=
 this Occultism would=20

reply: for two reasons:--  (_a_) The whole truth is too sacred to be given =
out promiscuously.  (_b_)=20

The knowledge of all the details and missing links in the exoteric teaching=
s is too dangerous in=20

profane hands.  The truths revealed to man by the "Planetary Spirits"--the =
highest Kumaras, those=20

who incarnate no longer in the Universe during this Mahamanvantara--who wil=
l appear on earth as=20

Avataras only at the beginning of every new human Race, and at the junction=
s or close of the two=20

ends of the small and great cycles--in time, as man became more animalized,=
 were made to fade=20

away from his memory. Yet, though these Teachers remain with man no longer =
than the time=20

required to impress upon the plastic minds of child-humanity the eternal ve=
rities they teach, Their=20

Spirit remains vivid though latent in mankind. And the full knowledge of th=
e primitive revelation has=20

remained always with a few elect, and has been transmitted from that time u=
p to the present, from=20

one generation of Adepts to another. As the Teachers say in the Occult Prim=
er:  _This is done so=20

as to ensure them_ [the eternal truths] _from being utterly lost or forgott=
en in ages hereafter by the=20

Three curates remained--those of St. Merri, St. Sulpice and St. Eustache. T=
he others withdrew.=20

"You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brother=
s?" said Gondy.  "We=20

hope so," answered the curates.  "Let us hear. Monsieur de St. Merri, you b=
egin."  "My lord, I have=20

in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you."  "Who and what=
 is this man?"  "A=20

shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards, who has great influence upon the commer=
ce of his=20

quarter."  "What is his name?"  "He is named Planchet, who himself also cau=
sed a rising about six=20

weeks ago; but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared."  "=
And can you find=20

him?"  "I hope so. I think he has not been arrested, and as I am his wife's=
 confessor, if she knows=20

where he is I shall know it too."  "Very well, sir, find this man, and when=
 you have found him bring=20

him to me."  "We will be with you at six o'clock, my lord."  "Go, my dear c=
urate, and may God=20

assist you!"  "And you, sir?" continued Gondy, turning to the curate of St.=
 Sulpice.  "I, my lord,"=20

said the latter, "I know a man who has rendered great services to a very po=
pular prince and who=20

would make an excellent leader of revolt. Him I can place at your disposal;=
 it is Count de=20

Rochefort."  "I know him also, but unfortunately he is not in Paris."  "My =
lord, he has been for three=20

days at the Rue Cassette."  "And wherefore has he not been to see me?"  "He=
 was told--my lord=20

will pardon me----"  "Certainly, speak."  "That your lordship was about to =
treat with the court."=20

Gondy bit his lips.  "They are mistaken; bring him here at eight o'clock, s=
ir, and may Heaven bless=20

you as I bless you!"=20


_
generations._  The mission of the Planetary Spirit is but to strike the key=
-note of Truth. When once=20

He has directed the vibration of the latter to run its course uninterrupted=
ly along the concatenation=20

of the race to the end of the cycle, He disappears from our earth until the=
 following Planetary=20

Manvantara. The mission of any teacher of Esoteric truths, whether he stand=
s at the top or the foot=20

of the ladder of knowledge, is precisely the same; as above, so below. rema=
ined; "have you=20

anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us?"  "Bett=

think what a solemn engagement you are making; one has offered a wealthy sh=
opkeeper, the=20

other a count; you are going, then, to offer a prince, are you?"  "I offer =
you a beggar, my lord."=20

"Ah! ah!" said Gondy, reflecting, "you are right, sir; some one who could r=
aise the legion of=20

paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris; some one who would know=20
