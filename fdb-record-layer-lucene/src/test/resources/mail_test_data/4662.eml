week for looking after him and feeding him. Only Elmer and I know of his whereabouts. And once 

a week the boy can canter over on Buntie and keep in touch with his pup.  We have a tacit 

understanding that the occurrences of yesterday morning are a closed chapter, are not to be 

referred to by word or deed. Duncan himself found it necessary to team in to Buckhorn and left 

word with Struthers that he would stay in town over night. The call for the Buckhorn trip was, of 

course, a polite fabrication, an expedient _pax in bello_ to permit the dust of battle to settle a little 

about this troubled house of McKail. All day to-day I have felt rather languid. I suppose it's the 

lethargy which naturally follows after all violence. Any respectable woman, I used to think, could 

keep a dead-line in her soul, beyond which the impulses of evil dare not venture. But I must have 

been wrong.... All week I've been looking for a letter from Peter Ketley. But for once in his life he 

seems to have forgotten us.     _Sunday the Twentieth_   I've been wondering to-day just what I'd 

do if I had to earn my own living. I could run a ranch, I suppose, if I still had one, but two or three 

years of such work would see me a hatchet-faced old termagant with fallen arches and a prairie-

squint. Or I could raise chickens and they are neither peculiar to the eternal (?) snows of the 

former, nor to the burning sun of the latter." ... "That we improve to the last, that we revered his 

name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass or desecrate his 

resting-place, shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington." 

Washington's mind, when he rises from his grave at the Last Day, will be immediately relieved by 

the information that no Britisher has ever trodden on his bones.  In debate he was neither bitter 

nor personal in the bad sense, though he had a good deal of caustic humour and knew how to 

make an effective use of it.  Passing from State politics to those of the Union, and elected to 

Congress as a Whig, a party to which he had gradually found his way from his original position as 

a "nominal Jackson man," Mr. Lincoln stood forth in vigorous though discreet and temperate 

opposition to the Mexican War.  Some extra charges made by General Cass upon the Treasury for 

expenses in a public mission, afforded an opportunity for a hit at the great Democratic "war-horse." 

"I have introduced," said Lincoln, "General Cass's name here chiefly to show the wonderful 

physical capacity of the man. They show that he not only did the labour of several men at the 

same _time_,

until the trap-nest of time swallowed me up in oblivion. Or I could take a rural school somewhere 

and teach the three R's to little Slovenes and Frisians and French-Canadians even more urgently 

in need of soap and water. Or perhaps I could be housekeeper for one of our new beef-kings in his 

new Queen-Anne Norman-Georgian Venetian palace of Alberta sandstone with tesselated towers 

and bungalow sleeping-porches. Or I might even peddle magazines, or start a little bakery in one 

of the little board-fronted shops of Buckhorn, or take in plain sewing and dispose of home-made 

preserves to the elite of the community.  But each and all of them would be mere gestures of 

defeat. I'm of no value to the world. There was a time when I regarded myself as quite a 

Somebody, and prided myself on having an idea or two. Didn't Percy even once denominate me 

as "a window-dresser"? There was a time when I didn't have to wait to see if the pearl-handled 

knife was the one intended for the fish-course, and I could walk across a waxed floor without 

breaking my neck and do a bit of shopping in the Rue de la Paix without being taken for a tourist. 

But that was a long, long time ago. And life during the last few years has both humbled me and 

taught me my limitations. I'm a house-wife, now, and nothing more--and not even a successful 

house-wife. I've let everything fall away except the thought of my home and my family. And now I 

find that the basket into which I so carefully packed all my eggs hasn't even a bottom to it.  But I've 

no intention of repining. Heaven knows I've never wanted to sit on the Mourner's Bench. I've never 

tried to pull a sour mug, as Dinky-Dunk once inelegantly expressed it. I love life and the joy of life, 

and I want all of it I can get. I believe in laughter, and I've a weakness for men and women who 

can sing as they work. But I've blundered into a black frost, and even though there was something 

to sing about, there's scarcely a blue-bird left to do the singing. But many hundred miles apart _at 

the same time_. And in eating, too, his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful. From 

October, 1821, to May, 1822, he ate ten rations a day in Michigan, ten rations a day here in 

Washington, and nearly five dollars' worth a day besides, partly on the road between the two 

places. And then there is an important discovery in his example, the art of being paid for what one 

eats, instead of having to pay for it. Hereafter if any nice young man should owe a bill which he 

cannot pay in any other way, he can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we have all heard of the animal 

standing in doubt between two stacks of hay, and starving to death. The like of that could never 

happen to General Cass. Place the stacks a thousand miles apart, he would stand stock still 

midway between them, and eat them both at once; and the green grass along the line would be 

apt to suffer some at the same time. By all means make him President, gentlemen. He will feed 

you bounteously, if--if there is any left after he has helped himself."  Great events were by this time 

beginning to loom on the political horizon. The Missouri Compromise was broken. Parties 

commenced slowly but surely to divide themselves into Pro-slavery and Anti-slavery. The 

"irrepressible conflict" was coming on, though none of the American politicians--not even the 

author of that famous phrase--distinctly recognised its advent. Lincoln seems to have been 

sincerely opposed to slavery, though he was not an Abolitionist. But he was evidently led more 

and more to take anti-slavery ground by his antagonism to Douglas, who occupied a middle 

position, and tried to gain at once the support of the South and that of the waverers at the North, 

by theoretically supporting the extension of slavery, yet practically excluding it from the territories 

by the doctrine of squatters' sovereignty. Lincoln had to be very wary in angling for the vote of the 

Abolitionists, who had recently been the objects of universal

will pass, and I'll break out again. I know it. I don't intend to be held down. I _can't_ be held down. I 

haven't the remotest idea of how it's going to happen, but I'm going to love life again, and be 

happy, and carol out like a meadow-lark on a blue and breezy April morning. It may not come to-

morrow, and it may not come the next day. But it's going to come. And knowing it's going to come, 

I can afford to sit tight, and abide my time....  I've to a large section of the Republican party. On 

one occasion, the opinions which he propounded by no means suited the Abolitionists, and "they 

required him to change them forthwith. _He thought it would be wise to do so considering the 

peculiar circumstances of his case_; but, before committing himself finally, he sought an 

understanding with Judge Logan. He told the judge what he was disposed to do, and said he 

would act upon the inclination if the
