philodendron monstera took the place of the coachman, and drove standing, for reasons known to himself, like Automedon of antiquity.

_Q. We are told in_ The Voice of the Silence _that we have to become __ __"__the path 

itself,__"__ and in another passage that Antahkarana is that path. Does this mean anything more 

than that we have to bridge over the gap between the consciousness of the Lower and the Higher 

Egos?_  _A._ That is all.  _Q. We are told that there are seven portals on the Path: is there then a 

sevenfold division of Antahkarana? Also, is Antahkarana the battlefield?_  _A._ It is the battlefield. 

There are seven divisions in the Antahkarana. As you pass from each to the next you approach 

the Higher Manas. When you have bridged the fourth you may consider yourself fortunate. 

Miscellaneous.   _Q. We are told that_ AUM _"__should be practised physically.__"__ Does this 

mean that, colour being more differentiated than sound, it is only through the colours that we shall 

get at the real sound of each of us? and that_ AUM _can only have its Spiritual and Occult 

signification when turned to the Atma-Buddhi-Manas of each person?_  _A._ AUM means good 

action, not merely lip-sound. You must say it in deeds.  _Q. With reference to the triangle, is not 

the Atma-Buddhi-Manas different for each entity, according to the plane on which he is?_  _A._ 

Each Principle is on a different plane. The Chela must rise to one after the other, assimilating 

each, until the three are one. This is the real root of the Trinity.  _Q. In_ The Secret Doctrine _we 

are had rejoined the cardinal.  "Mousqueton!" exclaimed D'Artagnan, "draw up the blinds of his 

majesty's carriage."  "It is he!" cried Porthos.  "Disguised as a coachman!" exclaimed Mazarin. 

"And driving the coadjutor's carriage!" said the queen.  "Corpo di Dio! Monsieur d'Artagnan!" said 

Mazarin, "you are worth your weight in gold."     53. How D'Artagnan and Porthos earned by 

selling Straw.   Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain, but the queen 

declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her. However, she 

offered the cardinal Laporte's place, which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other. 

It was not without foundation that a report of the king's intention to leave Paris by night had been 

circulated. Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o'clock, and howsoever great 

their prudence might be, they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without 

suspicion being generated. Besides, each individual had one or two others for whom he was 

interested; and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible 

projects of vengeance, every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire; 

so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets. 

The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Conde, with the

Pradhana. Akasha is the Auric Egg of the earth, and yet Akasha is Mahat. What that is the relation 

of Manas to the Auric Egg?_  _A._ Mulaprakriti is the same as Akasha (seven degrees). Mahat is 

the positive aspect of Akasha, and is the Manas of the Kosmic Body. Mahat is to Akasha as 

Manas is to Buddhi, and Pradhana is but another name for Mulaprakriti.  The Auric Egg is Akasha 

and has seven degrees. Being pure abstract ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night 

and did not know what it all was about. The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans, 

the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbe de la Riviere; and the third, the Duke de Longueville 

and the Prince de Conti, brother and brother-in-law of Conde. They all alighted and hastened to 

pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach. The queen fixed her eyes upon the 


_
things.  The Third Logos and Mahat are one, and are the same as the Universal Mind, Alaya.  The 

Tetraktys is the Chatur Vidya, or the fourfold knowledge in one, the four-faced Brahma.    Nadis. 

_Q. Have the Nadis any fixed relationship to the vertebrae; can they be located opposite to or 

between any vertebrae? can they be regarded as occupying each a given and fixed extent in the 

cord? Do they correspond  "But where is Madame de Longueville?"  "Ah, yes, where is my sister?" 

asked the prince.  "Madame de Longueville is ill," said the duke, "and she desired me to excuse 

her to your majesty."  Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin, who answered by an almost 

imperceptible shake of his head.  "What do you say of this?" asked the queen.  "I say that she is a 

hostage for the Parisians," answered the cardinal.  "Why 


_
the divisions of the cord known to Anatomists?_  _A._  H. P. B. believed that the Nadis 

corresponded to regions of the spinal cord known to Anatomists. There are thus six or seven 

Nadis or plexuses along the spinal cord. The term, however, is not technical but general, and 

applies to any knot, centre, ganglion, etc. The sacred Nadis are those which run along or above 

Sushumna. Six are known to Science, and one (near the brother.  "Silence," whispered the duke, 

"she has her reasons."  "She will ruin us!" returned the prince.  "She will save us," said Conti. 

Carriages now arrived in crowds; those of the Marechal de Villeroy, Guitant, Villequier and 

Comminges came into the line. The two musketeers arrived in their turn, holding the horses of 

D'Artagnan and Porthos in their hands. These two instantly mounted, the coachman of the latter
