  The Japanese brought philodendron monstera       where the Christians hav=
e gone and have passed, they ever did the       same murder among the India=
ns, and used tyranny and abominable       oppression against these innocent=
 people; and they added many more       and greater and newer ways of torme=
nt.  They became ever crueller,       because God let them precipitate them=
selves the more swiftly into       reprobate judgments and sentiments.     =
                 The Two Islands of San Juan and Jamaica   In 1509 the Span=
iards practical experts have questioned as to whether it is possible in a c=
limate like this to effect the clean drying so necessary to attain perfecti=
on. London and other cities, on account of their dust-charged atmosphere, a=
re unsuited for lacquer work.  The artist draws his design of landscape or =
figures or birds or flowers, filling his details with gold or silver and su=
perimposed colours built up with mastic, of those parts which are intended =
to be in slight relief.  The Japanese brought _
ordered monks would have given that they should be robbed and       killed,=
 and that those who=20

escaped death, should be placed in       perpetual captivity and servitude,=
 as slaves. 17.17. And=20

furthermore, I attest, that in all the space of time during       which the=
 multitudes of the population=20

of this island were being       killed and destroyed, as far as I can belie=
ve or conjecture, they=20

did not commit a single mortal sin against the Christians that       merite=
d punishment by man.  And=20

of those which are reserved to God       alone, such as the desire of venge=
ance, hatred and=20

rancour, that       these people might harbour against such mortal enemies =
as were the=20

Christians, I believe very few of the Indians committed any such.       The=
y were little more=20

impetuous and harsh, judging from the great       experience I have of them=
, than children or=20

youths of ten or twelve       years. 18.18. I have certain and infallible k=
nowledge, that the Indians=20

always       made most just war on the Christians while the Christians neve=
r had       a single just=20

one with the Indians; on the contrary, they were all       diabolical and m=
ost unjust, and much=20

worse than can be said of any       tyrant in the world; and I affirm the s=
ame of what they have=20

done       throughout the Indies. 19.19. When the wars were finished, and w=
ith them the murder,=20

they divided       among them all the men, (youths, women, and children bei=
ng usually       spared)=20

giving to one, thirty, to another forty, and to another a       hundred and=
 two hundred, according to=20

the favour each enjoyed with       the chief tyrant, whom they called gover=
nor.  Having thus=20

distributed them, they assigned them to each Christian, under the       pre=
tence that the latter=20

should train them in the catholic faith;       thus to men who are generall=
y all idiots, and very cruel,=20

avaricious       and vicious, they gave the care of souls. 20.20. The care =
and thought these=20

Spaniards took, was to send the men to       the mines to dig gold, which i=
s an intolerable labour;=20

and they put       the women into dwellings, which are huts, to dig and cul=
tivate the       land; a=20

strong and robust man's work.  They gave food neither to the       one, nor=
 the other, except grass,=20

and things that have no substance.       The milk dried up in the breasts o=
f nursing women and=20

thus, within a       short time, all the infants died. 21.21. And as the hu=
sbands were separated and=20

never saw their wives,       generation diminished among them; the men died=
 of fatigue and hunger=20

in the mines and others perished in dwellings or huts, for the same       r=
eason.  It was in this way=20

that such multitudes of people were       destroyed in this island, as inde=
ed all those in the world=20

might be       destroyed by like means. 22.22. It is impossible to recount =
the burdens with which=20

their owners       loaded them, more than three and four arobas(82) weight,=
 making them       walk=20

a hundred and two hundred leagues.  The same Christians had       themselve=
s carried by Indians=20

in hamacas, which are like nets; for       they always used them as beasts =
of burden.  They had=20

wounds on their       shoulders and backs, like animals, all wither-wrung. =
 To tell       likewise of the=20

whip-lashings, the beatings, the cuffs, the blows,       the curses, and a =
thousand other kinds of=20

torments to which their       masters treated them, while, in truth, they w=
ere working hard, would=20

take much time and much paper; and would be something to amaze       mankin=
d. 23.23. It=20

marquetry sheets. He began to dominate decoration till happily he was extin=
guished.  =3DThe=20

Incongruities of Marquetry.=3D--To those who have handled a good many examp=
les of marquetry=20

furniture in which panelling is predominant, such as clock-cases, there is =
one feature which always=20

strikes the practised eye. The question arises, How did the marquetry panel=
 come there? It is=20

another way of expressing the view that the proportion is radically wrong. =
A glance at a poor panel=20

of a clock-case, or a faked panel, or a stupidly wrought panel, is enough. =
To the collector of old=20



books nothing is more annoying than to find that the binder with all his fi=
ne tooling has trimmed off=20

the margins of the printed matter and the illustrations. It is an edition w=
ith the space expurgated. It=20

is the binder _versus_ the printer, and similarly in the clock-case it is t=
oo often the cabinet-maker=20

_versus_ the designer of the marquetry panel. This is the sentiment one has=
 on looking at many of=20

the marquetry clock-cases. The persons who received them from Holland did n=
ot always know=20

how to use them correctly. They either cut off their edges or left so littl=
e space as to convey the=20

idea of a curtailed edition of the original. In the case of the panelled pe=
riod, when there were three=20

panels, two of them had more often than not to be cut off in the middle to =
make room for the=20

circular aperture in the door showing the swinging pendulum. When the case-=
maker received his=20

panels according to order from the Continent, one would have thought he wou=
ld have done away=20

with the hole in the case. But perhaps the clockmaker insisted otherwise. A=
t any rate, it is a point=20

showing the absence of intimate relationship between clockmaker and case-ma=
ker. Holland=20

seems to be the answer, in spite of all experts to the contrary.  On the "a=
ll-over" marquetry clock-

cases there is a decided inclination to follow the designs found on contemp=
orary delft ware. As to=20

repetition, however well joined they are, the glue and the wax cannot hide =
the poverty of design.=20

Twice or thrice in one case are patterns repeated. It is the wall-paper art=
ist at work in a smaller=20

area. In this connection one recalls the decadence of the wood-engravers, w=
here three or four=20

artists worked on portions of one picture cut into sections and screwed tog=
ether as one block. The=20

old journals, the _Illustrated London News_, and the _Graphic_ and others o=
f the early 'eighties,=20

tell of this decadence. The thin white lines, as long as ink and paper last=
, record this subterfuge. It=20

was the last note of wood-engraving. Similarly, in marquetry, when we find =
the almost invisible=20

lines denoting several hands, or the piecing together of the same design cu=
nningly to deceive the=20

persons at the period, we at a later stage read this as the note determinin=
g the end, and the end=20

soon came.     CHAPTER IV  THE LONG-CASE CLOCK--THE PERIOD OF LACQUER      =
 What=20

is lac?--Its early introduction into this country--"The      Chinese taste"=
--Colour versus form--

Peculiarities of the lacquered      clock-case--The English school--English=
 amateur imitators--

Painted      furniture not lacquered work--The inn clock.   Lacquered work =
is the most un-English=20

style of decoration that has ever been employed by the cabinet-maker in the=
 embellishment of his=20

furniture. It came from the East and was introduced into this country about=
 the same period as tea-

drinking. At first tea was drunk by fashionable folk from cups without hand=
les, now it is the national=20

beverage. Lac is a natural product of China, the sap of a tree in=20


_
lands was begun when the death of the most Serene Queen, Dona       Isabell=
a was known here,=20

which was in the year 1504.  For up to that       time, only some provinces=
 in the island had been=20

ruined by unjust       wars, but not entirely: and these were nearly all ke=
pt hidden from       the=20

Queen.  Because the Queen, who is in blessed glory, used great       solici=
tude and marvellous=20

zeal for the health and prosperity of       these people, as we ourselves, =
who have seen the=20

examples of it with       our eyes and touched them with our hands, well kn=
ow. 24.24. Another rule=20

to be noted appearance resembling our ash-tree. It is not an artificial com=
pound of resin and oils,=20

worked down by turpentine. This natural gum is refined and coloured red, bl=
ack, golden yellow,=20

green, or grey. The surface of the wood is carefully prepared, and a ground=
 is laid on by degrees,=20

care being taken that each is of the right temperature and perfectly hard a=
nd dry before any layer=20

is applied. Never less than three and sometimes as many as eighteen thin la=
yers are thus applied=20

to the surface of the wood before the actual decoration of this ground by t=
he artist commences. In=20
