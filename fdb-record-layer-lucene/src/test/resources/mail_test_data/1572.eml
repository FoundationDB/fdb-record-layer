you see, my dreams have come true. I have had more than I dared to dream of=

 comrades, I have enjoyed fame and honour. I have loved, married from _
like to have writings on our subject. Another is Gaius Mucius, who, having =
great knowledge on=20

which to rely, completed the cella, columns, and entablature of the Marian =
temple of Honour and=20

Valour, in symmetrical proportions according to the accepted rules of the a=
rt. If this building had=20

been of marble, so that besides the refinement of its art it possessed the =
dignity coming from=20

magnificence and great outlay, it would be reckoned among the first and gre=
atest of works.  18.=20

Since it appears, then, that our architects in the old days, and a good man=
y even in our own times,=20

have been as great as those of the Greeks, and nevertheless only a few of t=
hem have published=20

treatises, I resolved not to be silent, but to treat the different topics m=
ethodically in different books.=20

Hence, since I have given an account of private houses in the sixth book, i=
n this, which is the=20

seventh in order, I shall treat of polished finishings and the methods of g=
iving them both beauty=20

and durability.     CHAPTER I  FLOORS   1. First I shall begin with the con=
crete flooring, which is=20

the most important of the polished finishings, observing that great pains a=
nd the utmost precaution=20

must be taken to ensure its durability. If this concrete flooring is to be =
laid level with the ground, let=20

the soil be tested to see whether it is everywhere solid, and if it is, lev=
el it off and upon it lay the=20

broken stone with its bedding. But if the floor is either wholly or partly =
filling, it should be rammed=20

down hard with great care. In case a wooden framework is used, however, we =
must see that no=20

wall which does not reach up to the top of the house is constructed under t=
he floor. Any wall which=20

is there should preferably fall short, so as to leave the wooden planking a=
bove it an unsupported=20

span. If a wall comes up solid, the unyielding nature of its solid structur=
e must, when the joists=20

begin to dry, or to sag and settle, lead to cracks in the floor on the righ=
t and left along the line of=20

wall.  2. We must also be careful that no common oak gets in with the winte=
r oak boards, for as=20

soon as common oak boards get damp, they warp and cause cracks in floors. B=
ut if there is no=20

winter oak, and necessity drives, for lack of this it seems advisable to us=
e common oak boards cut=20

pretty thin; for the less thick they are, the more easily they can be held =
in place by being nailed on.=20

Then, at the ends of every joist, nail on two boards so that they shall not=
 be able to warp and stick=20

up at the edges. As for Turkey oak or beech or ash, none of them can last t=
o a great age.  When=20

the wooden planking is finished, cover it with fern, if there is any, other=
wise with straw, to protect=20

the wood from being hurt by the lime.  3. Then, upon this lay the bedding, =
composed of stones not=20

smaller than can fill the hand. After the bedding is laid, mix the broken s=
tone in the proportions, if it=20

is new, of three parts to one of lime; if it is old material used again, fi=
ve parts may answer to two in=20

the mixture. Next, lay the mixture of broken stone, bring on your gangs, an=
d beat it the=20

neighbourhood. In short, Nikolay Stepanovitch, you absolutely must go to Ha=
rkov."  "What for?"=20

"You will find out all about him there.... You know the professors there; t=
hey will help you. I would=20

go myself, but I am a woman. I cannot...."  "I am not going to Harkov," I s=
ay morosely.  My wife is=20

frightened, and a look of intense suffering comes into her face.  "For God'=
s sake, Nikolay=20

Stepanovitch," she implores me, with tears in her voice--"for God's sake, t=
ake this burden off me! I=20

am so worried!"  It is painful for me to look at her.  "Very well, Varya," =
I say affectionately, "if you=20

wish it, then certainly I will go to Harkov and do all you want."  She pres=
ses her handkerchief to=20

her eyes and goes off to her room to cry, and I am left alone.  A little la=
ter lights are brought in.=20

The armchair and the lamp-shade cast familiar shadows that have long grown =
wearisome on the=20

walls and on the floor, and when I look at them I feel as though the night =
had come and with it my=20

accursed sleeplessness. I lie on my bed, then get up and walk about the roo=
m, then lie down=20



again. As a rule it is after dinner, at the approach of evening, that my ne=
rvous excitement reaches=20

its highest pitch. For no reason I begin crying and burying my head in the =
pillow. At such times I=20

am afraid that some one may come in; I am afraid of suddenly dying; I am as=
hamed of my tears,=20

and altogether there is something insufferable in my soul. I feel that I ca=
n no longer bear the sight=20

of my lamp, of my books, of the shadows on the floor. I cannot bear the sou=
nd of the voices=20

coming from the drawing-room. Some force unseen, uncomprehended, is roughly=
 thrusting me out=20

of my flat. I leap up hurriedly, dress, and cautiously, that my family may =
not notice, slip out into the=20

street. Where am I to go?  The answer to that question has long been ready =
in my brain. To Katya.=20

III  As a rule she is lying on the sofa or in a lounge-chair reading. Seein=
g me, she raises her head=20

languidly, sits up, and shakes hands.  "You are always lying down," I say, =
after pausing and taking=20

breath. "That's not good for you. You ought to occupy yourself with somethi=
ng."  "What?"  "I say=20

you ought to occupy yourself in some way."  "With what? A woman can be noth=
ing but a simple=20

workwoman or an actress."  "Well, if you can't be a workwoman, be an actres=
s."  She says=20

nothing.  "You ought to get married," I say, half in jest.  "There is no on=
e to marry. There's no=20

reason to, either."  "You can't live like this."  "Without a husband? Much =
that matters; I could have=20

as many men as I like if I wanted to."  "That's ugly, Katya."  "What is ugl=
y?"  "Why, what you have=20

just said."  Noticing that I am hurt and wishing to efface the disagreeable=
 impression, Katya says:=20

"Let us go; come this way."  She takes me into a very snug little room, and=
 says, pointing to the=20

writing-table:  "Look... I have got that ready for you. You shall work here=
. Come here every day=20

and bring your work with you. They only hinder you there at home. Will you =
work here? Will you=20

like to?"  Not to wound her by=20


_
less than three quarters of a foot in thickness when the beating is finishe=
d. On this lay the nucleus,=20

consisting of pounded tile mixed with lime in the proportions of three part=
s to one, and forming a=20

layer not less than six digits thick. On top of the nucleus, the floor, whe=
ther made of cut slips or of=20

cubes, should be well and truly laid by rule and level.  4. After it is lai=
d and set at the proper=20

inclination, let it be rubbed down so that, if it consists of cut slips, th=
e lozenges, or triangles, or=20

squares, or hexagons may not stick up at different levels, but be all joint=
ed together on the same=20

plane with one another; if it is laid in cubes, so that all the edges may b=
e level; for the rubbing=20

down will not be properly finished unless all the edges are on the same lev=
el plane. The herring-

bone pattern, made of Tibur burnt brick, must also be carefully finished, s=
o as to be without gaps=20

or ridges sticking up, but all flat and rubbed down to rule. When the rubbi=
ng down is completely=20

finished by means of the smoothing and polishing processes, sift powdered m=
arble on top, and lay=20

on a coating of lime and sand.  5. In the open air, specially adapted kinds=
 of floors must be made,=20

because their framework, swelling with dampness, or shrinking from dryness,=
 or sagging and=20

settling, injures the floors by these changes; besides, the frost and rime =
will not let them go unhurt.=20

Hence, if necessity drives, we must proceed as follows in order to make the=
m as free from defects=20

as possible. After finishing the plank flooring, lay a second plank floorin=
g over it at right angles,=20

and nail it down so as to give double protection to the framework. Then, mi=
x with new broken=20

stone one third the quantity of pounded tile, and let lime be added to the =
mixture in the mortar=20

trough in the proportion of two parts to five.  6. Having made the bedding,=
 lay on this mixture of=20

broken stone, and let it be not less than a foot thick when the beating is =
finished. Then, after laying=20

the nucleus, as above described, construct the floor of large cubes cut abo=
ut two digits each way,=20

and let it have an inclination of two digits for every ten feet. If it is w=
ell put together and properly=20

rubbed down, it will be free from all flaws. In order that the mortar in th=
e joints may not suffer from=20

frosts, drench it with oil-dregs every year before winter begins. Thus trea=
ted, it will not let the=20

hoarfrost enter it.  7. If, however, it seems needful to use still greater =
care, lay two-foot tiles, jointed=20

together in a bed of mortar, over the broken stone, with little channels of=
 one finger's breadth cut in=20

the faces of all I like the room very much. Then we both sit down in the sn=
ug little room and begin=20

talking.  The warm, snug surroundings and the presence of a sympathetic per=
son does not, as in=20

old days, arouse in me a feeling of pleasure, but an intense impulse to com=
plain and grumble. I=20

feel for some reason that if I lament and complain I shall feel better.  "T=
hings are in a bad way with=20

me, my dear--very bad...."  "What is it?"  "You see how it is, my dear; the=
 best and holiest right of=20

kings is the right of mercy. And I have always felt myself a king, since I =
have made unlimited use=20

of that right. I have never judged, I have been indulgent, I have readily f=
orgiven every one, right=20

and left. Where others have protested and expressed indignation, I have onl=
y advised and=20

persuaded. All my life it has been my endeavour that my society should not =
be a burden to my=20

family, to my students, to my colleagues, to my servants. And I know that t=
his attitude to people=20

has had a good influence on all who have chanced to come into contact with =
me. But now I am not=20

a king. Something is happening to me that is only excusable in a slave; day=
 and night my brain is=20

haunted by evil thoughts, and feelings such as I never knew before are broo=
ding in my soul. I am=20

full of hatred, and contempt, and indignation, and loathing, and dread. I h=
ave become excessively=20

severe, exacting, irritable, ungracious, suspicious. Even things that in ol=
d days would have=20

provoked me only to an unnecessary jest and a good-natured laugh now arouse=
 an oppressive=20



feeling in me. My reasoning, too, has undergone a change: in old days I des=
pised money; now I=20

harbour an evil feeling, not towards money, but towards the rich as though =
they were to blame: in=20

old days I hated violence and tyranny, but now I hate the men who make use =
of violence, as=20

though they were alone to blame, and not all of us who do not know how to e=
ducate each other.=20

What is the meaning of it? If these new ideas and new feelings have come fr=
om a change of=20

convictions, what is that change due to? Can the world have grown worse and=
 I better, or was I=20

blind before and indifferent? If this change is the result of a general dec=
line of physical and=20

intellectual powers--I am ill, you know, and every day I am losing weight--=
my position is pitiable; it=20

means that my new ideas are morbid and abnormal; I ought to be ashamed of t=
hem and think=20

them of no consequence...."  "Illness has nothing to do with it," Katya int=
errupts me; "it's simply=20

that your eyes are opened, that's all. You have seen what in old days, for =
some reason, you=20

refused to see. To my thinking, what you ought to do=20


_
joints. Connect these channels and fill them with a mixture of lime and oil=
; then, rub the joints hard=20

and make them compact. Thus, the lime sticking in the channels will harden =
and solidify into a=20

mass, and so prevent water or anything else from penetrating through the jo=
ints. After this layer is=20

finished, spread the nucleus upon it, and work it down by beating it with r=
ods. Upon this lay the=20

floor, at the inclination above described, either of large cubes or burnt b=
rick in herring-bone=20

pattern, and floors thus constructed will not soon be spoiled.     CHAPTER =
II  THE SLAKING OF=20

LIME FOR STUCCO   1. Leaving the subject of floors, we must next treat of s=
tucco work. This will=20

be all right if the best lime, taken in lumps, is slaked a good while befor=
e it is to be used, so that if=20

any lump has not been burned long enough in the kiln, it will be forced to =
throw off its heat during=20

the long course of slaking in the water, and will thus be thoroughly burned=
 to the same=20

consistency. When it is taken not thoroughly slaked but fresh, it has littl=
e crude bits concealed in it,=20

and so, when applied, it blisters. When such bits complete their slaking af=
ter they are on the=20

building, they break up and spoil the smooth polish of the stucco.  2. But =
when the proper attention=20

has been paid to the slaking, and greater pains have thus been employed in =
the preparation for=20

the work, take a hoe, and apply it to the slaked lime in the mortar bed jus=
t as you hew wood. If it=20

sticks to the hoe in bits, the lime is not yet tempered; and when the iron =
is drawn out dry and=20

clean, it will show that the lime is weak and thirsty; but when the lime is=
 rich and properly slaked, it=20

will stick to the tool like glue, proving that it is completely tempered. T=
hen get the scaffolding=20

ready, and proceed to construct the vaultings in the rooms, unless they are=
 to be decorated with=20

flat coffered ceilings.     CHAPTER III  VAULTINGS AND STUCCO  "You are tal=
king nonsense."=20

"You don't love them; why should you force your feelings? Can you call them=
 a family?=20

Nonentities! If they died today, no one would notice their absence tomorrow=
."  Katya despises my=20

wife and Liza as much as they hate her. One can hardly talk at this date of=
 people's having a right=20

to despise one another. But if one looks at it from Katya's standpoint and =
recognizes such a right,=20

one can see she has as much right to despise my wife and Liza as they have =
to hate her.=20

"Nonentities," she goes on. "Have you had dinner today? How was it they did=
 not forget to tell you=20

it was ready? How is it they still remember your existence?"  "Katya," I sa=
y sternly, "I beg you to be=20

silent."  "You think I enjoy talking about them? I should be glad not to kn=
ow them at all. Listen, my=20

dear: give it all up and go away. Go abroad. The sooner the better."  "What=
 nonsense! What about=20

the University?"  "The University, too. What is it to you? There's no sense=
 in it, anyway. You have=20

been lecturing for thirty years, and where are your pupils? Are many of the=
m celebrated scientific=20

men? Count them up! And to multiply the doctors who exploit ignorance and p=
ile up hundreds of=20

thousands for themselves, there is no need to be a good and talented man. Y=
ou are not wanted."=20

"Good heavens! how harsh you are!" I cry in horror. "How harsh you are! Be =
quiet or I will go=20

away! I don't know how to answer the harsh things you say!"  The maid comes=
 in and summons us=20

to tea. At the samovar our conversation, thank God, changes. After having h=
ad my grumble out, I=20

have a longing to give way to another weakness of old age, reminiscences. I=
 tell Katya about my=20

past, and to my great astonishment tell her incidents which, till then, I d=
id not suspect of being still=20

preserved in my memory, and she listens to me with tenderness, with pride, =
holding her breath. I=20

am particularly fond of telling her how I was educated in a=20


_
1. When vaulting is required, the procedure should be as follows. Set up ho=
rizontal furring strips at=20

intervals of not more than two feet apart, using preferably cypress, as fir=
 is soon spoiled by decay=20

and by age. Arrange these strips so as to form a curve, and make them fast =
to the joists of the=20

floor above or to the roof, if it is there, by nailing them with many iron =
 "At times I used to walk=20

about our seminary garden..." I would tell her. "If from some faraway taver=
n the wind floated=20

sounds of a song and the squeaking of an accordion, or a sledge with bells =
dashed by the garden-

fence, it was quite enough to send a rush of happiness, filling not only my=
 heart, but even my=20

stomach, my legs, my arms.... I would listen to the accordion or=20
