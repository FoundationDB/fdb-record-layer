philodendron monstera  "First," began the lad, who had acted so strangely, "let me introduce to you my uncle, Mr. Andrew Swaim."  "Your uncle!" exclaimed Jack.  "Your uncle!" echoed Sam, Bony and Nat.  "That's right. My uncle, whom I ran away from home could hate him, as much as I've always hated Di, deep down in my heart. At that minute I should have liked to kill her, and watch his face when he found her lying dead--out of his reach for ever.

in the afternoon, and they prepared to spend the night in the hut.  "I wonder if Budge and Long 

Gun will worry about our not coming back?" asked Sam.  "No," replied Jack, "for I told Budge I 

didn't see how we could return, in case we were successful in getting to the mysterious camp." 

"Well, we got here all right," remarked Nat, with an uneasy laugh. "The question is, how to get 

away."  "And rescue Will," added Bony.  "Yes," Foreign Secretary give you exactly what you 

wanted, even if it took you far, far from me."  With that, he looked at me suddenly, and his face 

grew slowly red, under the brown.  "You are a very kind Imp," he said. "Imp" is the name he 

invented for me. I loved to hear him call me by it.  "Kind!" I echoed. "One isn't kind when one--

likes--people."  I saw by his eyes, then, that he knew. But I didn't care. If only I could make him

brain was affected by the blow on the head, following the fright at coming down on the sled. He 

isn't very strong, and it wouldn't take much to upset him. Besides, he's been worrying about finding 

his uncle, and about the mean way his guardian has treated him. I certainly hope nothing has 

happened to him in that shed, but I can't understand why that man Andy should keep him there." 

The boys passed rather an uneasy night, not only because of their strange surroundings, but on 

account of worrying over the fate of Will. Nor were they altogether me, because he had found out 

how I loved him, and because he had really too much of the dark-young-Crusader-knight in him, to 

break my heart! I made up my mind that I would take him at his word, quickly, if he gave me the 

chance; and I would tell Di that he was dreadfully in love with me. That would make her writhe.  I 

kept my eyes on him, and I let them tell him everything. He saw; there was no doubt of that; but he 

did not say the words I hoped for. A moment or two he was silent; and then, gazing away towards 

the door of the ballroom, he spoke

"Well, we're still alive, at any rate," observed Jack, as he arose the next morning, and helped to 

get a simple breakfast. "Did any of you fellows hear anything in the night?"  "It seems to me that I 

heard people sneaking around the cabin," said Bony.  "Same here," added Sam.  "Guess they 

didn't altogether trust us," came from Nat. "They looked in on us every once in a while. I wonder 

how Will slept?"  "Guess we'll have to wait to have that answered," remarked Jack. "If I see Sandy 

I'll ask him----"  He stopped suddenly, and looked from a window.  "Here comes Will now," he 

added.  "And that man Andy is with him!" exclaimed Sam. "Maybe now we'll solve the mystery." 

CHAPTER XXXIV  THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED   Jack opened the cabin door, and stood in it, 

prepared to greet Will. The other captives gathered back of their chum.  "How are you, Will?" 

asked Jack, as soon as his friend came within speaking distance. "We were quite worried about 

you."  "I'm all right," answered the strange lad.  "Why did you run away?" inquired older than Di by 

three or four years.  "Thank you, Imp, for letting me see that you are such a staunch little friend," 

said he. "Now that I know you really do take an interest in my affairs, I think I may tell you why I 

want so much to go to Algiers--though very likely you've guessed already--you are such an 

'intuitive' girl. And besides, I haven't tried very hard to hide my feelings--not as hard as I ought, 

perhaps, when I realise how little I have to offer to your sister. Now you understand all, don't you--

even if you didn't before? I love her, and if I go to Algiers--"  "Don't say any more," I managed to 

cut him short. "I can't bear--I mean, I understand. I--did guess before."  It was true. I had guessed, 

but I wouldn't let myself believe. I hoped against hope. He was so much kinder to me than any 

other man ever took the trouble to be, in all my wretched, embittered twenty-four years of life.  "Di 

might have told me," I went gasping on, rather than let there be a long silence between us just 

then. I had enough pride

The man had a good-natured, smiling face, and Nat's spirits began to rise. He did not think they 

had much to fear from such a man.  "It's a strange story," said Will, as he entered the cabin, 

followed by the man.  The boys crowded around the two, and waited anxiously for Will's next 

words. see me cry--though, if it could have made any difference, I would have grovelled at his feet 

and wet them with my tears. "But she never does tell me anything about herself."  "She's so 

unselfish and so fond of you, that probably she likes better to talk about you instead," he defended 

her.
