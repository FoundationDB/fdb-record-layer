philodendron monstera on the minds of his boys than hours of lecturing on t=

 half the village said another, I'd take Ned Franks's word against all the =

ome into the house," I said, in a low voice, "before you _
of the mass which one can't see,--that's the part hidden beneath the green =
waves, and as that=20

may stretch out much wider than the white peak glistening above, it is clea=
r that a ship might strike=20

on the sunken ice while seeming to give a wide berth to the berg. Now, it's=
 just the same with=20

falsehood. There's an upper part, easily seen, and I hope that we all try t=
o steer clear of it; that no=20

boy here is so mean and base as to tell a downright lie. Every boy here kno=
ws that _lying lips are=20

an abomination to the Lord_. But not all are on their guard against the _su=
nken ice_ stretching=20

below. We strike on it when we exaggerate, or when in any way we deceive, t=
hough not a word=20

may be spoken, or what is spoken may be literal truth. My own keel grated a=
gainst the sunken ice=20

to-day." Ned felt a good deal embarrassed as he went on, all the more so fr=
om the profound=20

silence wished.  "I do not wish, unless Mademoiselle particularly desires m=
e to do so," said she. "I=20

do not rest well when I have not been allowed to undress Mademoiselle."  "S=
it up, then, in your=20

own room, and wait there for me till I ring for you," I replied. "I shan't =
be late, whether Mr. Dundas=20

comes or doesn't come."  "Supposing the gate-bell should ring, and Mademois=
elle should go, yet it=20

should not be the Monsieur she expects, but another person whom she would n=
ot care to admit?"=20

I knew of what she was thinking, and of whom.  "There's no fear of that. No=
 fear of any kind," I=20

answered.  She took off my cloak, and went upstairs reluctantly, carrying m=
y jewel box.  I walked=20

into the drawing-room, which was lighted and looked very bright and charmin=
g, with its many=20

flowers and framed photographs, and the delightful Louis Quinze furniture, =
which I had so enjoyed=20

picking=20


_
there were no better riders than some of our own blue-jackets. Now, that ma=
y be true, or it may=20

not, but I certainly did not speak from my knowledge, and I'm afraid that I=
 ran foul of exaggeration.=20

And I said that when our ship was lying off Alexandria, we tars rode about =
on shore as often as=20

we'd a chance,--and that was true enough, though the chance came but seldom=
; but I suppose=20

that you fancied, from what I said, that we galloped about upon horses?" Th=
ere was a general=20

murmur of assent. "Now, I never mounted a horse in my life; the beasts whic=
h we rode were=20

_donkeys_." There was a here and there at antique shops or at private sales=
.  I flung myself on=20

the sofa, but I could not rest. In a moment I was up again, moving about, l=
ooking at the clock,=20

comparing it with my watch, wondering what could have happened to make Ivor=
 fail in keeping his=20

promise to be prompt on the hour of twelve.  Of course, a hundred harmless =
things might have=20

kept him, but I thought only of the worst, and was working myself up to a f=
renzy when at last I=20

heard the gate-bell. I had been in the house no more than twelve or fourtee=
n minutes, but it=20

seemed an hour, and I gave a sob of relief as I=20


_
almost instantly suppressed, however, for Ned Franks looked unusually grave=
. "Now, my lads, I've=20

thought it best to say all this to you openly, both for my own sake and for=
 yours. I want you to feel=20

how hard it is to keep off altogether from that same smooth, slippery ice o=
f deceit,--to know how=20

treacherously it lies under the surface; and I want you to resolve, if ever=
 you find yourselves=20

touching it, be it ever so slightly, to sheer off at once, like honest Chri=
stians, and let no temptation=20

draw you from the straight course of perfect truth."  The school-master's e=
ffort was over; painful as=20

it had been, Ned Franks was glad that he had made it. His frank confession =
of so small a rushed=20

out, down the garden path, to let my visitor in.  Fumbling a little at the =
lock, always a little difficult if=20

one were in a hurry, I asked myself what if, as Marianne had suggested, it =
were not Ivor Dundas,=20

but someone else--Raoul, perhaps--or the man who had been in her mind: Gode=
nsky.  But it was=20

Ivor.  "What news?" I questioned him, my voice sounding queer and far away =
in my own ears.  "I=20

don't know whether you'll call it news or not, though plenty of things have=
 happened. I'm awfully=20

sorry to be late--"  I wouldn't let him finish, standing there, but took hi=
m by the arm and drew him=20

into the garden, pushing the gate shut behind him as I did so. Yet I forgot=
 to lock it,=20
