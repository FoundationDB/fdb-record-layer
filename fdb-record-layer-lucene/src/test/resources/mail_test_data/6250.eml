as Heat is the occasion of ripening; so, though they want it with us, from =

for preserving, the _St. Peter_ and the Warner Grapes are very good, and I =
may mention the=20

grizled Fronteniac, which is a noble Grape, when it is ripe, as well as the=
 others. And for the other=20

Sorts of Grapes, they are not fit for preserving, unless I take in the Rais=
in Grapes, red and white,=20

and the _Lombardy_ Grape; all which are full of Pulp, and seldom ripen. The=
se are your sorts, and=20

now to proceed.  Take your Grapes, gather'd in a dry Day, though they are n=
ot ripe. You may=20

guess when we come to the end of _September_, and they are not so, they nev=
er will be ripe: pick=20

them then from the Stalks, and stone them carefully, without breaking much =
of the Skin, save the=20

Juice; then take the weight of them in fine Sugar powder'd, and boil your S=
ugar with some Water,=20

wherein Pippins have been boiled before, first straining your Water, and bo=
il them to Syrup, taking=20

off the Scum as it rises. And when the Scum rises no more, put in your Grap=
es, and boil them=20

ed Sorts, let them boil till=20

they are clear, and that the Syrup will jelly; then put them into Glasses, =
and when they are cold,=20

cover them close with white Paper; but mark your Papers, which are of the F=
