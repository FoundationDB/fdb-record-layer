forty to fifty       leagues: and the town of Cuzcatan, which was the capit=

him the kindest of welcomes, sending him more than       twenty or thirty I=
ndians loaded with fowls=20

and other provisions.   10. When he arrived, and had received the gift, he =
commanded that each=20

Spaniard should take from that multitude of people, as many Indians       a=
s he pleased for his=20

service during their stay there, whose duty       should be to bring them e=

 served with all their=20

strength, and almost adored       them.   11. In the meantime this captain =

him much gold,       because it was principally to that end that they came.=
  The Indians       replied=20

gold, though there is little=20

on       them.  The captain ordered that they should be tested and because =
he       saw they were=20

of copper, he said to the Spaniards: "to the devil           And thereby ha=

the forest" drew from his=20

pocket a sundial; it was, no doubt, a pocket-clock, or, in other words, a w=
atch.  The art of dial-

making is a subtle one. It is true that some are pleasing in their balance =
and others are=20

displeasing, which sets us wondering what rules there are to govern the sym=
metrical arrangement=20

of circles and figures and their co-related hands. There is an air of solem=
n grandeur about a fine=20

dial; its dignity is as unruffled as the march of Time itself. The old mast=
ers of dial construction had=20

the art of spacing as completely under control as had Caxton the great typo=
grapher in the balance=20

of his printed page.  What Lord Grimthorpe has said[3] about the dials of t=
urret clocks applies in its=20

principles to the dials of domestic clocks. "The figures are generally made=
 much too large. People=20

have a pattern dial painted; and if the figures are not as long as one-thir=
d of the radius, and=20

therefore occupying, with the minutes, about two-thirds of the area of the =
dial, they fancy they are=20

not large enough to be read at a distance; whereas the fact is, the=20


_
each one put the Indians who serve him, in chains, and I will order       t=
hat they be branded as his=20

slaves."  This was done, and they marked       as slaves with the King's br=
and, all they could bind.=20

And I saw the       son of the prince of that town thus branded.   12. When=
 those Indians who=20

escaped and the others throughout the land       beheld such great iniquity=
, they began to collect=20

and to arm       themselves.  The Spaniards did the greatest slaughter and =
massacre       among=20

them, after which they returned to Guatemala where they built       a town;=
 and it is that one which=20

has now been by righteous decree of       divine justice, destroyed by thre=
e deluges together: the=20

one of       water, the other of earth and the third of stones much bigger =
than       ten, and twenty=20

oxen.   13. Having thus killed all the lords and the men who could have mad=
e       war, they put all=20

the others into the aforesaid infernal slavery;       they demanded slaves =
as tribute, figures, the less=20

distinct they are, and the more difficult it is to distinguish the position=
 of the hands, which is what=20

people want to see, and not to read the figures, which may very well be rep=
laced by twelve large=20

spots.... The rule which has been adopted, after various experiments, as th=
e best for the=20

proportions of the dial is this: Divide the radius into three, and leave th=
e inner two-thirds clear and=20

flat, and of some colour forming a strong contrast to the colour of the han=
ds--black or dark blue if=20

they are gilt, and white if they are black. The figures, if there are any, =
should occupy the next two-

thirds of the remaining third, and the minutes be set in the remainder near=
 the edge."  [3]=20

of the Spandrel.=3D--There=20

daughters as they have no other slaves, all of whom they loaded into       =
ships and sent to be sold=20

in Peru.  By other massacres and murders,       besides the above, they hav=
e destroyed and=20

devastated a kingdom more       than a hundred leagues square, one of the h=
appiest in the way of=20

fertility and population in the world.  This same tyrant wrote that       i=
t was more populous than the=20

kingdom of Mexico; and he told the       truth.   14. He and his brothers, =
difficulties. It is not easy=20

exactly to fill a triangle with a design that is pleasing. Some of the best=
 examples are found in=20

Italian lettering, old sixteenth-century woodcuts of the letter L.  In Engl=
ish clocks, the spandrel in=20

the lantern clock about 1670 had a plain cherub head, as simple in characte=
r as the fine pearwood=20

carving from a Buckinghamshire church we illustrate of a slightly earlier p=
eriod, still rich with=20

unimpaired colour (p. 167). German clocks had this=20


_
four or five million people in fifteen or sixteen years, from the       yea=
r 1524 till 1540, and they=20

continue to kill and destroy those who       are still left; and so they wi=
ll kill the remainder.   15. It=20

was his custom when he went to make war on some town or province,       to =
take with him as=20

many of the Indians as he could, to fight       against the others; and as =
he led ten or twenty=20

thousand and gave       them nothing to eat, he allowed them to eat the Ind=
ians they       captured.=20

And so a solemn butchery British Museum there is one example with this cher=
ub-head as a base=20

ornament at the foot of the clock, which rests on it. This is in date 1600.=
