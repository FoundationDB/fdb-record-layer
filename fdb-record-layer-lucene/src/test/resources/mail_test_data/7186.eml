and all those other things. Now _this_ is all I know about it and I am terr=
ibly sorry that I went=20

butting into things and was responsible for bringing trouble to you----"  S=
nubby Turner was not=20

destined to continue his explanation at that moment, for before he had time=
 to go on with what he=20

had in mind the sound of excited exclamations came from the corridor, and s=
ome one, after=20

knocking loudly on the door, turned the knob and thrust in his head. Teeny-=
bits and Snubby saw=20

that it was Fred Harper.  "Have you heard the news?" the newcomer cried. "B=
assett's been killed=20

and Campbell's in the hospital pretty nearly done for, too! It's in the new=
spapers. Look here!"=20

Behind Fred Harper were half a dozen other Ridgleyites, and Snubby Turner's=
 room quickly=20

became crowded with members of the school whose attention had been attracte=
d by the=20

exclamations. Meanwhile Snubby Turner slipped out of the room and ran down =
to the basement to=20

consult Jerry, the janitor's assistant; he remained in the old fellow's box=
-like room for several=20

minutes.  The result of the conversation that went on between them was that=
 old Jerry pulled a=20

celluloid collar out of a pasteboard box and announced gruffly and with unm=
istakable=20

determination that he was "goin' over to see the Doctor." It was not often =
that old Jerry adorned his=20

neck in any manner, and now he felt that it was entirely unnecessary to put=
 on a tie. The shining=20

collar itself fastened with a button which, if not gold at least had the ap=
pearance of the precious=20

metal, was evidence that he was that it should be very moist, excites no su=
rprise, when it is=20

considered, that in its passage upwards it passes wholly over water, and th=
rough the warm mists=20

and fogs constantly ascending from the Mississippi and its tributaries. Thi=
s current prevails much=20

more along the Ohio river than it does at any considerable distance from it=
. One consequence is,=20

that the climate in the immediate vicinity of the Ohio river is warmer, tha=
n it is either north or south=20

of it, unless you go to the southward a considerable distance. Other causes=
 may, and probably do,=20

in a greater or less degree, contribute to produce this result, and I will =
here state them:  First, The=20

Ohio runs on a surface less elevated above the sea than the country, either=
 north or south of it, but=20

this difference is trifling through the whole of the sandstone formation. T=
his formation prevails from=20

the head of the Ohio to Aberdeen, which is opposite to Marysville in Kentuc=
ky, at least two-thirds=20

of the distance which that river washes the southern shore of this state. T=
he reason is obvious,=20

because there are no falls in a sandstone formation.  Another cause which c=
ontributes to produce=20

a warmer climate, especially in the winter season, in the valley of the Ohi=
o, is, that several=20

considerable streams which empty themselves into the Ohio, have their sourc=
es on the highlands,=20

a great distance to the south of it; for instance, the Great and Little San=
dy, and the Great and Little=20

Kenhawa, which descending from a warm region of country, their waters contr=
ibute to keep the=20

Ohio open in winter.  But these causes are by no means sufficient to produc=
e the one half of the=20

comparative warmth of climate observable in the immediate vicinity of this =
invaluable river. To=20

prove that the climate is much milder in the southern than in the northern =
part of this state, I will=20

proceed to mention several facts, which have fallen under my own observatio=
n.  In the latter=20

house and rang the door bell his fearsome features wore such a murderous ex=
pression that the=20

maid who came in answer to his summons was startled.  "What do you want?" s=
he asked.  "I=20

wanter see the Doctor!" said Jerry and glowered so fiercely that the girl s=
tarted to close the door.=20

With surprising agility the old man thrust his foot into the crack and when=
 the girl said: "The Doctor=20

is very busy; he's received some bad news and he won't want to talk with yo=
u," old Jerry repeated:=20

"I wanter see the Doctor!" and added an imperative "_Now!_" which caused th=
e girl to come to the=20

conclusion that here was a determined and desperate man. She announced to D=
octor Wells that=20

"that terrible looking old janitor" was outside and that he was "bound to c=
ome in."  Doctor Wells=20

immediately came out to the door and ushered old Jerry into his office wher=
e the grizzled janitor's=20

assistant sat on the edge of one of the big chairs and, holding his hat in =
his hand, announced to=20

the head of the school the following:  "I got my ijeers and they ain't no _=
common_ ijeers either,=20

Doctor."  "I know you have, Jerry," said Doctor Wells, who from twenty year=
s' acquaintance with=20

the old-timer was aware that no small matter had induced him to invade what=
 he had always=20

considered as no less than sacred territory.  "Yes," said Jerry, "ijeers ar=
e common until they get=20

backed up by _facts_, Doctor, and then they's uncommon. The boys was tellin=
' me the news about=20

Bassett and on the Whetstone Branch of the Scioto river, between eighty and=
 ninety miles south of=20

Lake Erie, and twenty-five miles north of Columbus, the seat of government,=
 which is near the=20

centre of the state, where I saw a number of gentlemen direct from Detroit,=
 by the way of Lower=20

Sandusky, who informed me that the snow at that time was eighteen inches in=
 depth and upwards=20

all along the lake shore, but gradually decreased as they came south until =
they arrived at=20

Delaware. At that place it was then about twelve inches deep in the open fi=
elds, and somewhat=20

deeper in the woods. I descended the road along the Whetstone to Columbus, =
the snow=20

decreasing in depth all the way as I proceeded. At Columbus it wholly disap=
peared in the fields,=20

and only ice was found in the road, which also decreased until I came to th=
e Big Walnut Creek,=20

thirteen miles south of Columbus, where it disappeared, and the road began =
to be muddy. As I still=20

proceeded south, the mud increased in depth until I came to Chillicothe, ab=
out thirty-two miles=20

south of Big Walnut, where the frost was entirely out of the ground, and th=
e roads were almost=20

impassable. As I still descended southward, along the Scioto, I found that =
at Piketon, on the=20

Scioto, nineteen miles south of Chillicothe, the road had considerably impr=
oved. I proceeded=20

onwards to Portsmouth on the Ohio river, at the mouth of the Scioto, about =
twenty-six miles south=20

of Piketon, where the ground was entirely settled, and the=20

to no good end. I ain't one to talk agin one of them as has passed on, Doct=
or, but them was bad=20

even if I be nigh on to=20

seventy and perhaps a little more, and I heard things along back that sot m=

, where I lodged, was=20

ney was performed in=20

three days, and in travelling only one hundred and fifteen miles from north=
 to south, this=20

extraordinary difference of climate was observed.  A traveller may leave Po=
