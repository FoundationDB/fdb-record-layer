philodendron monstera Spanish race." Moreover, the Europeans settled in the=
 colonies "have too much influence, through their exclusive wealth and conn=
ections, for weakening governmental action there; and care nothing for any =
political changes except as they can find therein hamlets in ravines and al=
ong mountain slopes were speedily destroyed. The town of Alhama lost thirte=

ettled in the colonies "have too much influence, through their exclusive we=
alth and connections, for weakening governmental action there; and care not=
hing for any political changes except as they can find therein hamlets in r=
avines and along mountain slopes were speedily destroyed. The town of Alham=
a lost thirteen hundred and twenty houses at the first shock. Five hundred =
and seventy-six bodies were taken out of the ruins. Two hundred and eighty =
houses were overthrown by _
the villages. The most common method which the Indians of the villages have=
 for proving their=20

territorial property is by tradition, and the depositions of witnesses; and=
 with that powerful weapon=20

they undertake and maintain the most contentious lawsuits, aided by the fis=
cals of the Audiencia--

who often forget that their office of defenders of the Indians is bona fide=
, and for the sake and=20

protection of the natives in the tribunals to which the laws commend them. =
But any person who=20

may have exercised the duties of magistrate for any time in Filipinas will =
know that in the decisions=20

of judges there is nothing more discredited than the evidence presented by =
Indian and mestizo=20

witnesses, who are not restrained from perjury by either an intimate acquai=
ntance with the=20

obligations of religion or by sentiments of conscience, honor, and reputati=
on. It is very common to=20

see, in court cases, that witnesses of that sort will swear, and then contr=
adict their own testimony,=20

according as the witnesses [are affected by] either their own interests or =
the influence of the=20

litigant who presents them.  These causes, besides rendering the lawsuits o=
f this kind eternal,=20

have very frequently produced scandalous disobedience of the villagers to t=
he enactments of the=20

Audiencia of the islands, and uprisings of armed men in order to prevent ef=
fectually even the=20

judicial possession of the crown lands which had been sold, with all the fo=
rmalities of the laws, by=20

the government there; and, finally, they withhold the Spanish families and =
persons of wealth from=20

purchasing rural establishments in order to undertake on a large scale the =
cultivation of the=20

products of the country, which is perhaps the only means of promoting the a=
griculture of the=20

islands.  It is therefore expedient, in order to cut short these noisy cont=
roversies, which have so=20

mischievous consequences for the internal peace of the communities in the i=
slands, that his=20

Majesty be pleased to command that the government there shall oblige all th=
e villages and private=20

land-owners in them to have authenticated before the respective alcaldes-ma=
yor of the provinces=20

the documents for their ownership, both private and communal. Strict obliga=
tion should be=20

imposed on them to surround their lands with trees--achiote, [144] mulberry=
, cotton, cinnamon,=20

cacao--under penalty of losing their title to the land. The documents shoul=
d be registered in the=20

tribunals of the respective alcaldes, who at the end of every year should s=
end to the capital the=20

original books of record, in order that these may be kept there securely in=
 the archives, for which=20

provision shall be made by the government, not admitting in the courts or d=
eclaring lawful any=20

other titles of ownership to lands than those which are supported by those =
necessary conditions.=20

Of the ecclesiastical orders which are conferred on Indians and mestizos  T=
he irregular procedure=20

of the reverend archbishops and bishops of the islands in conferring eccles=
iastical orders on the=20

Indians and mestizos there, will be in that colony, as it has already been =
in America, one of the=20

causes which most incite revolutions. The Indians receive through the pries=
thood a standing which=20

they cannot worthily sustain, because they never lay aside the affections, =
passions, and usages of=20

Indians. Educated by the religious, they afterward come to be their decided=
 enemies; they divide=20

with the religious the opinions of the villagers, who finally, even though =
they know the deficient=20

morals of the native priests, always respect the sacred functions which the=
se exercise. The least=20

political evil which the latter occasion is [through] their neglect of thei=
r obligations as parish priests,=20

the irregularity of their mode of life, and their carelessness in everythin=
g pertaining to divine=20

worship. The inhabitants of the villages administered by Indian curas are v=
ery different from those=20

of the religious from Europa, whose people are distinguished by their simpl=
icity, docility, and=20

religious training. He who knows the active and leading part played by this=
 class of persons in=20



accomplishing the independence of America will not be surprised that in the=
 establishment of the=20

constitution in Filipinas Indian curas have almost all been the directors o=
f the elections in their=20

villages, the electors, and the deputies in Cortes and for the province--in=
 all these functions=20

distinguishing themselves by their officiousness, and their pretensions aga=
inst the legitimate=20

government of the islands.  This class of persons, dominating the conscienc=
es of the ignorant and=20

unfortunate, can easily drag them into error. As simple farmers and artisan=
s, they would have=20

been useful to their families and to the government; but mistakenly raised =
to the dignity of priests,=20

other interests now move them, and they form a commonwealth apart in the sa=
fe retreat of the=20

provinces. A consideration of justice wrongly understood by the prelates of=
 the islands, and a=20

vehement desire in the Indian or mestizo heads of families to ennoble these=
 by placing their sons=20

in the priesthood, have caused there an excessive ordination of Indians--wh=
ich I cannot avoid=20

characterizing as such, since, besides the many clerics who are actually ad=
ministering villages,=20

there is a considerable surplus of others who are scattered through the pro=
vinces. These evils=20

were foreseen in the laws of the Indias (ley iv, tit. vii, lib. i), which c=
autions and exhorts the=20

reverend prelates of the Indias not to ordain so many clerics as they were =
doing; but this has not=20

sufficed, and it is necessary that the government, recognizing the unfortun=
ate experience that it=20

has already had with this abuse, should take the most efficacious measures =
for the purpose of=20

limiting the authority of the prelates in Filipinas, in conferring ecclesia=
stical orders on Indians and=20

mestizos, strictly to the number of clerics which the religious orders of t=
hose islands agree upon=20

and propose as necessary to have for their coadjutors, and for Indian villa=
ges not now occupied,=20

or which in the future the religious shall fail to occupy--ordering the gov=
ernor of Filipinas to secure,=20

by mild and discreet means, that the vacant curacies of clerics be conferre=
d on European=20

religious.    Of the European religious in Filipinas  The lack of European =
religious in the Filipinas=20

Islands for filling at element seemed in conspiracy against the city.  In a=
ddition to threatened=20

famine and pestilence among the survivors, the rabble, as in Calabria, show=
ed a disposition to=20

indiscriminate plunder. Upon this =E2=80=9Cthe King gave orders immediately=
 for gallows to be placed all=20

round the city, and after about one hundred executions, amongst which were =
some English=20

sailors, the evils stopped.=E2=80=9D The King was very prompt and energetic=
, initiating every practicable=20

system of relief, and having the really needy cared  [Illustration: EARTHQU=
AKE AT LISBON.]  for=20

at the expense of the State. Several lighter shocks were felt in the succee=
ding two months. At the=20

end of three months the Government began to rebuild the town. In fifteen ye=
ars it was well=20

restored, and to-day is one of the handsomest in Europe.  The immense area =
over which this=20

earthquake was felt is very remarkable; for not only was every part of Spai=
n and Portugal=20

convulsed, but the shocks were perceived, with greater or less intensity, i=
n England, Holland, Italy,=20

Norway, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Corsica, the West Indies, at Morocco =
and Algiers in=20

Africa, and in a part of South America. At Algiers the shock was so violent=
 as to throw down many=20

buildings; and an oasis, with all its population, not far from Morocco, was=
 swallowed up. Fez and=20

Mesquinez were destroyed, with fifteen thousand people. The town of Setubal=
, seventeen miles=20

from the Tagus and twenty-two miles southeast of Lisbon, was almost entirel=
y swallowed up. The=20

shock was almost as severe at Oporto as at Lisbon. The premonitory roar was=
 compared to the=20

rattling of many carriages over a rough road. The loftiest mountains were s=
haken, and many cleft=20

or shattered. Masses of rock tumbled from the crags into the valleys. At Co=
lares, seventeen miles=20



from Lisbon, flames and smoke were seen to burst from the Alviras, and also=
 out of the sea.=20

These phenomena continued for some days. A chasm fifteen miles long opened =
in the Pyrenees.=20

Towns were seriously damaged in Switzerland, France and Italy. Vesuvius, in=
 a state of eruption=20

for a period, suddenly ceased. The shock was also felt by ships far at sea,=
 and, in several=20

instances, the concussion was such as to make the people suppose their vess=
els had struck on a=20

rock. In one instance, it is said that the people on board a vessel off the=
 West Indies were thrown=20

up a foot and a half from the deck. This circumstance may be  [Illustration=
: RUINED CATHEDRAL,=20

LISBON.]  accounted for by the inelasticity of water; so that a violent and=
 sudden movement of the=20

bottom of the ocean would be communicated to the surface and to the ship, t=
hrough the medium=20

of the fluid, with nearly the same force as though the vessel had been on t=
he ground itself.  Quite=20

as remarkable was the immense wave produced. At Cadiz its height was sixty =
feet, and the=20

damage in proportion. Rolling to the northward it inflicted vast injury upo=
n Cornwall, England. At=20

the Canaries and Azores the waves rose repeatedly to an immense height; and=
 at Madeira the=20

injury was still greater. In less than an hour the wave had traveled to Ley=
den. Norway and Sweden=20

felt its presence, even to the recesses of the Gulf of Finland. On the west=
ern border of the Atlantic,=20

among the lesser Antilles, where the tide scarcely exceeds twenty-nine inch=
es, a black wall of=20

water twenty-two feet high rushed upon the coasts. The steep and rocky isle=
t of Stabia was=20

dashed over by the waves. In Martinique the water rose to the roofs of the =
houses, and then=20

receded from the shore for more than a mile. The unusual commotion stirred =
up the bituminous=20

sediment of the sea bottom, and at Barbadoes the waves were in consequence =
black as ink.=20

There have been numerous earthquakes since in Europe which must pass withou=
t mention. One=20

in 1817 completely destroyed Vostitza, a town in Greece not far from the si=
te of ancient Helice.=20

Another well-remembered one in 1855 desolated the Canton of Valais in Switz=
erland. This country=20

has had numerous shocks--sixteen hundred or more, in the past few centuries=
, and once or twice=20

Basle has been almost totally destroyed. Valais itself is a beautiful vale =
accessible only by a cleft=20

in a mountain range eighty-five hundred feet deep. Numerous small towns and=
 hamlets are=20

scattered about the vale, and the precipitous slopes around are dotted with=
 shepherds=E2=80=99 and=20

hunters=E2=80=99 huts.  On July 25, 1855, after an extremely hot morning, t=
he people were astounded by a=20

great earthquake--an abrupt and vertical shock. Then came wave-like motions=
 throwing every one=20

prostrate. Houses tumbled in all directions. People were rolled about like =
logs of wood. Nearly=20

every village in the canton was destroyed. Great landslips and avalanches r=
ushed down from the=20

hills. So tremendous was the shock that the mountain tops could be seen to =
sway to and fro.=20

Crags and blocks of ice fell into the vales, crushing and grinding. The ter=
rible uproar sounded as=20

though the whole range of the Alps was about to collapse. The terrible shoc=
ks were felt at Lyons,=20

at Paris, at Heidelberg, at Milan, at Genoa. Lisbon had no severer shock. A=
nd this great=20

convulsion, that dandled mountains as though mere puppets, and destroyed to=
wns and villages by=20

the score--killed one person. It is one of the most remarkable occurrences =
in European history.=20

Among the more destructive recent shocks in Europe are those of 1881-84. Ch=
io, one of the most=20

beautiful islands of the Grecian archipelago, and the home of a thrifty and=
 enterprising people, was=20

visited by an earthquake on April 3, 1881. The whole city, with its hospita=
ls, schools, libraries and=20

works of art, was laid in ruins in a few seconds. This convulsion forms a s=
trange contrast to the=20

more violent one just described. Numerous adjacent villages were overthrown=
; and after the shock=20



was past it was found that more than five thousand persons were killed and =
ten thousand others=20

more or less injured. After making all possible efforts at restoration, the=
 authorities were compelled=20

to pull down many still tottering walls and scatter disinfectants over the =
wreck to  [Illustration:=20

SCENE AT CHIO.]  avoid an epidemic from the thousand corpses left beneath t=
he ruin.  The entire=20

adjacent coast of Asia Minor was more or less shaken, and several scores of=
 people were killed in=20

some seaport towns. The shocks continued several days, each being accompani=
ed=20


_
permanent preservation of that colony. It can be safely asserted that the g=
overnment of his=20

Majesty has in this class of ministers the most powerful force for maintain=
ing that possession in=20

attachment to his sovereignty. Their virtuous and unworldly mode of life; t=
heir absolute=20

disinterestedness in regard to temporal matters, which is a marvelous contr=
ast to the greed and=20

ambition of the European trader, the mestizo, and the Chinese; their extrao=
rdinary sacrifices in=20

living apart from the society of their equals for nineteen, twenty, and [ev=
en] thirty years in those=20

almost uninhabited islands, which are unprovided with the sort of nourishme=
nt suitable to their=20

estate; their discretion and patience in correcting and teaching the Indian=
s; their resignation in all=20

kinds of adversity: everything, in short, contributes to make the inhabitan=
ts of that land regard=20

them as supernatural beings, and in the light of this conception the father=
s exercise over the=20

Indians a moral force more powerful than even that of the government. The I=
ndians live in entire=20

moral separation from the Spaniards; they have their own laws of tradition,=
 their own opinions and=20

customs, entirely unknown to any one who is ignorant of their language or h=
as not continual=20

intercourse with them. The European religious are the only persons in the c=
onfidence of the=20

government who by favor of these circumstances, and with a practical and in=
timate knowledge of=20

the nature and inclinations of the natives there, can find a way into their=
 hearts, incline their wills to=20

what is right, enlighten them, and keep them peaceful and submissive; and w=
ithout this larger=20

armies would be of no avail.  [The religious are the only persons who under=
stand the condition of=20

their respective villages, and the alcaldes-mayor are usually indolent and =
inefficient, relying on=20

native interpreters, and caring little for aught save their own profit; the=
y depend on the religious in=20

all cases of difficulty, and the higher authorities are jealous of this sup=
eriority of the religious. The=20

government ought to maintain as many religious as possible in the islands, =
and give them as much=20

political authority as is consistent with their ministry; five hundred of t=
hem should be sent there,=20

and the alcaldes-mayor should be obliged to consult every month with their =
respective curas on=20

the best means of promoting the interests of the people, and the central go=
vernment can then act=20

on reports of these conferences.]    On the settlement of banished and vaga=
bond foreigners in the=20

islands  [The entrance of these persons causes trouble among the people of =
the islands: the=20

Indians are easily influenced by white men, especially those who teach them=
 to live in more=20

freedom and insubordination to authority; foreigners of this sort are almos=
t always of lax morals=20

and dangerous political opinions, which are even more dangerous to "the Spa=
niards of the=20

country, who, although more enlightened than the Indians, are more suscepti=
ble to such=20

corruption." The foreigner thus residing in the islands, "usually from the =
dregs of other nations,"=20

makes light of all the institutions there, and tries to set the people agai=
nst the mother country; and=20

three times recently has occurred] the scandal, unheard-of in that colony, =
of foreigners who,=20

abusing the innocence of the country, have, being already married in their =
own country, again=20

married Philippine Spanish girls, leaving them abandoned and dishonored. Ot=
hers, who feigned to=20

be learned physicians and agriculturists, have deceived and defrauded propr=
ietors in the islands.=20

Others have clandestinely introduced impious, revolutionary, and obscene bo=
oks printed in the=20

Spanish language, but pirated in France, with which they have caused atroci=
ous injury in the=20

morals of families there. In fine, the settlement of foreigners in the isla=
nds would not be expedient,=20

even for the sake of the advantages which their industry and arts would pro=
duce there; for works=20

carried on always with foreign capital, on the account of foreigners, and b=
y the agency of=20



foreigners, would leave to the country very little benefit as compared to t=
hat from labor employed=20

there by Spanish capital, and on the account and for the benefit of Spaniar=
ds. If we desire to=20

preserve intact in Filipinas the religious ideas and the pure morals of our=
 ancestors, and due=20

submission to the government of his Majesty, it is necessary to keep the pe=
ople away from every=20

point of contact with foreigners. In China, Japan, and other nations, the r=
evolutionary spirit has not=20

been able to penetrate, because the laws of those kingdoms keep the gates c=
losed to all=20

strangers. In a colony still in its infancy in customs and enlightenment--w=
hich, like a school of=20

education, needs to have for models men of sound morals--it has been very a=
bsurd to allow to=20

remain and become citizens therein men who have served a term of exile, and=
 polisones [145] or=20

vagabonds, sometimes followed by officers of justice from the Peninsula; an=
d that the Indian=20

people should see (as so many times I have seen) that this sort of men succ=
eeded in obtaining=20

positions as corporals, revenue officials, and even militia captains, solel=
y from the circumstance of=20

their being white men. It is necessary always to remove from the colonies t=
his sort of people, who=20

on account of their principles and their inclinations must be enemies of or=
der and of government,=20

permitting therein the settlement only of respectable Spanish artisans and =
merchants, whose=20

upright conduct may serve as an example to that neophyte people, while at t=
he same time they=20

make fortunes for themselves. But even this point needs careful study, and =
in regard to it I will=20

present the following reflections.    Of the residence of European Spaniard=
s in Filipinas  By a=20

necessary and inevitable effect of certain causes, physical and moral, whic=
h would take too long to=20

explain here, the Spanish race in the colonies--or the descendants of Europ=
eans, and mestizos of=20

these, born and reared there--have from their birth political sentiments wh=
ich are entirely opposite=20

to those of their ancestors and other Europeans. They regard the Indian as =
an entirely passive=20

being, the European as a foreigner, and the land as exclusively their own. =
The educational=20

institutions which thus far have been founded in the colonies, with the obj=
ect of uniting their=20

inhabitants, by means of enlightening them, under the same principles of re=
ligion, morals, and=20

politics, have not been able to uproot those subterranean roaring. Two year=
s later, ere the town=20

was fairly rebuilt, there was another earthquake, which, however, did more =
damage in Asia Minor=20

than in Chio.  But the most striking example of great damage done by an ear=
thquake in a very=20

small tract is the case of the island of Ischia. This tiny islet, the Imari=
na of Horace and Virgil, was=20

well known to the Greeks, who at one time endeavored to establish themselve=
s upon it, but were=20

finally driven away by repeated volcanic outbursts. Since the activity of V=
esuvius, Ischia has=20

remained quiet, though a dozen extinct craters bear witness to its former f=
ury. Its highest point is=20

two thousand, seven hundred and seventy-two feet above the sea, while the e=
ntire island is but six=20

miles in diameter. It is evidently cast up by an ancient, submarine volcano=
.  Situated a few miles=20

from Naples, Ischia has for years been a favorite summer resort for the Ita=
lians of the neighboring=20

coast. A score of little towns and villages dot its shores and hills, and t=
he view of the Gulf of=20

Naples, Baiae, and adjacent islands and coasts forms one of the most beauti=
ful landscapes in the=20

world.  After its abandonment by the Greek colonists the islet was quiet fo=
r sixteen centuries. In=20

1302 an eruption and earthquake occasioned considerable loss of life and pr=
operty. After that,=20

though the main peak, Epomeo, has been occasionally muttering and fuming, n=
o serious=20

disturbance occurred for nearly six centuries. The subterranean heat occasi=
ons numerous hot=20

springs, the water reaching a temperature of 178 degrees. These baths, and =
the abundance of=20



choice fruits afforded by the island, afford additional attractions to visi=
tors, and the twenty-five=20

thousand inhabitants would seem to have an earthly paradise.  March 4, 1881=
, the people were=20

suddenly roused from their slumbering security by two sharp shocks half an =
hour apart, which=20

overthrew seven hundred houses in the little town of Casamicciola, killing =
one hundred and=20

twenty-six people and wounding one hundred and seventy-seven more. The only=
 premonition was=20

that a few minutes before the hot springs suddenly reached the boiling poin=
t.  Yet this disaster was=20

comparatively insignificant when we consider the one of July 28, 1883.  It =
was the height of the=20

summer season. The little island was thronged with pleasure-seeking visitor=
s. The night was dark=20

and cloudy; the sea was unusually agitated. The small theatre at Casamiccio=
la was filled with an=20

animated throng, who cared not for the boding storm. The play opened with a=
n earthquake scene.=20

As the clock pointed to 9:32, the _Punchinello_ rushed on the stage, shouti=
ng, =E2=80=9CUn terremoto! un=20

terremoto! alla mare! alla mare!=E2=80=9D (An earthquake! an earthquake! to=
 the sea! to the sea!) The=20

audience thought it was part of the play; but ere they could applaud the vi=
gorous acting, the lights=20

were out, a thundering sound was heard, and the crashing roof was upon them=
. The appalling roar=20

was followed by profound silence, as clouds of stifling dust were whirled u=
p by the wind. Then in=20

the darkness were heard the cries of terrified people, seeking one another =
in the gloom, and=20

groping for the shore as in the days of Pompeii.  A visitor who was in the =
theater said, that at the=20

first noise, which resembled the discharge of a heavy battery of artillery,=
 =E2=80=9Cnot a cry was uttered,=20

though terror was depicted in every countenance; but when the first shock w=
as followed by several=20

others, a shriek of despair went up from every lip. The lights went out, pi=
eces of timber were falling=20

all about us, and cries of terror were succeeded by shrieks of pain from th=
ose who had been=20

injured. It was a trying moment. When the shocks ceased, I crawled, like ma=
ny others, out of the=20

ruined building in order to reach the shore. The dust was literally blindin=
g. Several times I=20

stumbled over heaps of masonry and rubbish from which heart-rendering groan=
s and shrieks were=20

proceeding. Upon the shore I encountered many others as frightened as I was=
, and endeavoring=20

to escape in fear of there being more shocks. Seeing that all remained quie=
t, we retraced our=20

steps in order to relieve the injured. But it was not until the morning, up=
on the arrival of the=20

authorities and the troops sent from Naples, that it was possible to take a=
ny effective steps for=20

surmounting the difficulties by which we were surrounded. The firemen, assi=

then set to work energetically to clear away the rubbish, laying the dead b=
odies in a row, and=20

handing the injured over to the doctors. It was necessary to go to work ver=
y carefully, so as not to=20

injure those still unhurt; and so the work continued very slowly, during wh=
ich time we felt our heart-

strings torn by the piteous appeals for relief. Some people were covered by=
 so much debris that it=20

took hours to reach them, and when we did so, some of them had succumbed to=
 their injuries,=20

while others had gone out of their minds. The dense clouds of dust had chok=
ed many of those who=20

were not killed on the spot.=E2=80=9D  Some strange scenes occurred; and th=
ere were instances of=20

remarkable coolness. An Italian professor of surgery who had taken his chil=
d to the theatre, coolly=20

took out his watch at the first crash, and noting the exact time, sat  [Ill=
ustration: THE PANIC AT=20

CASAMICCIOLA.]  perfectly still while the surging crowd endeavored to escap=
e. There he sat with=20

his child till morning, when the light enabled him to find his way out of t=
he wreck.  The sea shore=20

was a weird spectacle. Lighted up by a pile of blazing drift might be seen =
scores of naked children,=20

and grown persons in their night clothes, scurrying wildly about. An eye-wi=
tness tells of many=20



crazy with fear and grief. All night long the wreck resounded with groans a=
nd cries. One woman,=20

whom he heard continually moaning, and crying =E2=80=9CMy children! my chil=
dren!=E2=80=9D was found at daybreak=20

on the edge of a shattered terrace, and clad only in a chemise. Wondering w=
hat he could say by=20

way of consolation, he chanced to observe two little ones playing not far a=
way amid a tottering=20

wreck that threatened at every moment to crush them. They were hers.  Furth=
er down a woman=E2=80=99s=20

jewelled arm and shoulder protruded from the wreck, while her husband, buri=
ed nearly, kept crying=20

=E2=80=9Csave her, never mind about me.=E2=80=9D As a helping hand was reac=
hed to her a sudden landslip=20

crushed out the remaining life.  A young English lady sat playing a funeral=
 march. An Italian count=20

sprang up, saying, =E2=80=9CI cannot stand such music!=E2=80=9D Just as he =
cleared the door the hotel fell in=20


_
hand, recent events in the Americas have proved that the men who had most e=
ducation and=20

acquaintance with the sciences were the party leaders [corifeos] of revolut=
ion and independence.=20

It ought to be regarded as an incontestable truth that as soon as the Spani=
sh race in Filipinas=20

reaches a greater number than that of the Europeans, and with this increase=
 acquires a certain=20

degree of moral force, a war for independence will be declared; and accordi=
ng to this idea the=20

educational institutions, when there is not sincerity in the minds of the p=
ersons and in the laws that=20

aim at encouraging this class of population in the colonies, have a tendenc=
y hostile to the=20

preservation of the royal government in them. This class of Spanish familie=
s is, for another reason,=20

very unfortunate in Filipinas, and may be regarded as condemned to perpetua=
l slothfulness and=20

misery. They cannot devote themselves to agriculture, because in that burni=
ng climate only at the=20

piano.  For days the work went on, pressed by the energy of the Italian gov=
ernment. All the native=20

police had been killed in the wreck. King Humbert in person visited the sce=
ne and had the work=20

pressed as rapidly as possible.  There was no more complete wreck of any to=
wn than of Lacco=20

Ameno. Of fifteen hundred and ninety-three people but five escaped. At Casa=
micciola but one=20

house was left intact. Not a few houses in the former place were swallowed =
up in fissures. Floria=20

was totally destroyed. Yet the largest town on the island, Ischia, with the=
 adjacent villages, was=20

scarcely hurt; and at Naples, on the mainland, the news of the catastrophe =
was a complete=20

surprise. Yet on the half of the islet that was most severely shaken the ea=
rthquake numbered four=20

thousand victims. A greater contrast to the great Valais earthquake could h=
ardly be imagined.  Still=20

more recent is the catastrophe of Southern Spain, one of the loveliest regi=
ons in=20


_
because the wages which the Indian and the Sangley mestizo alike earn, whic=
h is sufficient to=20

meet their simple needs, is insufficient to pay for another sort of food an=
d clothing for the=20

Spaniards. For these same reasons, they cannot occupy themselves in the coa=
sting trade; nor,=20

finally, in the commerce of the islands on a large scale, for lack of suffi=
cient capital, since by=20

inheritance is divided among all the sons the wealth which their European p=
arents left to them; and=20

the practice of law is there a career to which resort is very unfortunate. =
All these causes, added to=20

the lassitude which the climate inspires, maintain that class of people in =
such a condition of=20

idleness and poverty, especially the women, that it has been necessary to e=
stablish in the capital=20

alone six seminaries and beaterios in which to shelter and educate Spanish =
girls; and that in the=20

ordinance regarding the Acapulco galleon his Majesty should grant to the Sp=
anish widows of=20

merchants the special favor of a pension or widow's usufruct on the boletas=
 of that vessel, their=20

only means of making a living.  [Bernaldez declares that these European Spa=
niards, "there=20

f Murcia more than=20

four thousand houses were destroyed, with hundreds of the inhabitants. Agai=
n the ground was in a=20

state of constant tremor from November, 1855, to March, 1856.  But more sev=
ere than these was=20

the shock of 1884. About the end of November slight vibrations were percept=
ible in Spain,=20

Portugal, Italy, and Southern France. The shocks did not manifest especial =
intensity at any=20

especial locality, and no attention was paid to them, as such occurrences a=
re so frequent that they=20

cannot be regarded as indicative of greater shocks to come. For example, th=
ere were forty-six=20

hundred and twenty shocks recorded in different portions of the earth durin=
g the years 1850-57;=20

yet none of these were followed by earthquakes of great severity. So in the=
 case of the November=20

shocks of 1884, no one seemed concerned to know where they originated, or i=
f they boded evil.=20
