regret, the gradual widening of the breach between his father and himself. =
In their infrequent=20

meetings there was never anything remotely approaching an open rupture; but=
 in a thousand ways=20

the younger man fancied he could see and feel the steady growth of the rift=
.  That the long arm of=20

the machine of which his father was the acknowledged head was reaching out =
into all corners of=20

the State, was a fact no longer to be doubted, and that the influences thus=
 set in motion were=20

sinister, he took for granted. Therefore, when it came in his way, he score=
d the machine frankly,=20

charging it with much of the mischief which had been wrought in the way of =
arousing public=20

sentiment against the corporations. "The worst in politics joined with the =
worst elements in=20

capitalized industry," was his platform characterization of the alliances o=
f the past, and he usually=20

added that he was fighting it as every honest man was in duty bound to figh=
t it. But it is hard to=20

fight in the dark. After all was said, he could not help admiring the subtl=
ety of the master brain=20

which was able to control and direct such a it for the benefit of the obser=
vers.  "But I cannot=20

translate the bass-relief on the bronze," he added.  "That represents Lieut=
enant Waghorn=20

embarking with the mails in an open boat at Suez, an incident that actually=
 occurred. It is said that=20

this gentleman, after spending the best years of his life in his efforts to=
 establish a quicker route=20

between England and her vast colonies, died in poverty in London in 1850; b=
ut I hope it is not=20

true," the commander explained. "We will now apply for admission to the off=
ice of the manager."=20

The permission was obtained, and the party ascended to the upper room of th=
e building. Monsieur=20

Chartrey, the superintendent of the transit department of the canal, was ve=
ry polite to them, and=20

explained everything to them in English. On a low table which occupied all =
one side of the=20

apartment was what looked like a metal trough about fifteen feet long. A mo=
del of this apparatus=20

was exhibited in England, and there it was called "the toy," a name which i=
s still retained.  On a=20

shelf above the table are about fifty models of ships, each bearing the fla=
g of some=20


_
cleverly that, though the name of the thing was in everybody's mouth, its w=
orkings were so=20

carefully concealed that it was only by the merest chance that he stumbled =
upon them now and=20

then.  In more than one of the short stop-overs in the capital he had found=
 his father still occupying=20

the private suite at the Inter-Mountain, and now and again there was a meal=
 shared in the more or=20

less crowded _cafe_. On such occasions the son leaned heavily upon the publ=
ic character of the=20

place and carefully steered the table-talk--or thought he did--into innocuo=
us channels. But on a=20

day shortly after the meeting with Gantry in Ophir this desultory programme=
 was broken. Reaching=20

the hotel in the evening after an all-day train journey from Lewiston, Blou=
nt found his father waiting=20

for him in the lobby, and when he proposed a _cafe_ dinner the senator shoo=
k his head.  "No, son;=20

not this evening," he said. "I've been feeling sort of set up and aristocra=
tic to-day, and I've just=20

ordered a dinner sent upstairs. I reckon you'll join me?"  The young man wa=
s willing enough; more=20

than willing, since he was now ready to say a thing which must be said befo=
re he could be=20

prepared to set a time limit upon Gantry--a limit beyond which lay the firi=
ng of the fuse and the=20

blowing up of all things mundane.  "Certainly," he agreed. "Give me a few m=
inutes to change my=20

clothes--"  "You look good enough to me just as you are, boy," said the din=
ner-giver, and he took=20

his son by the arm and walked him to the elevator.  In the private dining-r=
oom Blount found the=20

table laid for two, much as if his coming had been pre-figured. He let that=
 go, and for the time the=20

talk was of the doings at Wartrace sidings, stations, and the lakes. When a=
 ship enters the canal at=20

either end, a little ship is placed in the relative position it occupies; a=
nd when one sails out of it, its=20

representative in the trough is removed. All the stations are connected wit=
h this office by=20

telegraph, just as the railroads are controlled in modern times; and when a=
 vessel passes from=20

one section, or block, it is reported to the manager. A man is always watch=
ing; and as news=20

comes in, he makes the proper changes in the model ships. Where a steamer i=
s to tie up for the=20

night is ordered from this office.  Monsieur Chartrey was very heartily tha=
nked for his courtesy and=20

kindness, and the party left to look at the docks, quays, and basins of Ter=
replein; but they were=20

precisely the same as they had seen in various ports of Europe, especially =
at Havre. The=20

commander had ordered the Maud to be in readiness for a trip, and it was de=
cided to spend the=20

rest of the afternoon at Suez.  The first question the captain put on his r=
eturn to the ship was as to=20

whether anything had been seen of the mysterious Arab stranger; for the off=
icers had been=20

cautioned not to admit any person on board. Mr. Gaskette had remained on bo=
ard of the Maud,=20

and made the same report. With the four seamen who had attended the company=
 up the Nile on=20

board, and with the second officer and Don, the little steamer left her lan=
ding-place, provided with=20

a pilot, and steamed by the channel over to the city of the desert, as it h=
as been called.=20

CHAPTER XXV  A VISIT TO THE SPRINGS OF MOSES   The utility of the Maud was =
fully=20

demonstrated at Suez, if there had been any doubt of it before, as a tender=
, and Captain Ringgold=20


_
digging for fossils, of Patricia's keen enjoyment of the life in the open, =
and--this put with gentle=20

hesitation on the part of the news-bringer--of Mrs. Honoria's growing affec=
tion for the young=20

woman whose ambitions reached out toward a sociological career.  "You say P=
atricia is learning to=20

drive a car?" queried Patricia's lover.  "Best woman driver I ever saw," wa=
s the senator's praiseful=20

rejoinder. "Nothing feazes that little girl, and I'm telling you that she c=
an turn the wheels just about=20

as fast as you want to ride."  This was a new aspect of Miss Anners, even t=
o one who knew her as=20

well as Blount thought he knew her, and, lover-like, he found a grain of en=
couragement in it.=20

Patricia had never cared for the out-of-door things save as they bore upon =
the hygienic condition=20

of the poor in the great cities. If she had changed in one respect, she mig=
ht change in another.=20

"I'm glad to know that," he commented. "She was needing an outlet on that s=
ide. There is a good=20

bit of the Puritan in her--all work and no play, you know."  The senator lo=
oked out from beneath his=20

shaggy eyebrows. "Speaking of work; they're working you pretty hard these d=
ays, aren't they,=20

son? If you belonged to my generation instead of your own, you wouldn't be =
cold-shouldering that=20

young woman out yonder at Wartrace the way you do; not for all the politics=
 that were ever=20

hatched."  "I have my work to do, and Patricia Anners would be the last per=
son in the world to put=20

obstacles in the way of it," returned the son gravely. Then he added: "I wi=
sh I could say as much=20

for other people."  The boss shot another keen glance across the table. "So=
mebody been trying to=20

block you, Evan, boy?" he asked.  Blount met the gaze of the shrewd gray ey=
es without flinching.=20

"I don't know of any good reason why we shouldn't be entirely frank with ea=
ch other, dad," he said,=20

using for the first time since his return to the out of the water, and givi=
ng her a place on the upper=20

deck, had been referred to this point in the voyage, and it was yet to be s=
ettled.  Port Ibrahim is the=20

walled basin south-west of Port Tewfik, or Terreplein as the French call it=
, extending out to the=20

deep water of the Gulf of Suez. The shores are bordered with a shoal in eve=
ry part. To a practical=20

person the motive of De Lesseps in avoiding the city of Suez was probably t=
o strike the water at=20

the deepest point, rather than political.  The party took their places in t=
he standing-room of the=20

Maud, which had been prepared for their reception. The "Big Four" were agai=
n in their element,=20

though the pilot had everything his own way. A channel describes about a qu=
arter of a circle from=20

the deep water and the very end of the canal to the north side of the city,=
 in which there is depth=20

enough for the smaller class of vessels engaged in its commerce.  Most of t=
hese crafts were=20

dhows, similar to the felucca with which the party had become familiar in t=
he Archipelago, and the=20

boys observed one just astern of them with great interest. They are used on=
 the Malabar Coast in=20

the East Indies as well as in the Red Sea, where it is called a _baggala_, =
though dhow is the more=20

common name in the far East. They are over two hundred tons burden, and of =
all sizes below that.=20

They have been used for commerce and piracy, which is also true of the felu=
cca of the=20

Mediterranean.  "She sails like the wind," said Captain Scott, after they h=
ad looked the craft over.=20

"She is bigger than the Samothraki, whose acquaintance we made in Pournea B=
ay," added Morris.=20

"I have read something of the craft in stories about the Malays; and a craf=
t of that sort suggests=20

piracy to me every time, especially since our experience in the Archipelago=
," replied Scott.  "There=20

are no pirates up here," said the pilot with a laugh, for he spoke English =
and understood all=20


_
else, I think, what the stumbling-blocks are, and who is putting them in my=
 way."  "Maybe so;=20

maybe I do," was the even-toned answer. "It happens so, once in a while, th=
at I know a heap of=20

things I can't tell, son." Then: "Has McVickar been calling you down?"  "No=
 one has called me=20

down. But some one, or something, is keeping me out of the real fight. I do=
n't mean that I'm not=20

doing what I set out to do: I've got my own particular abomination by the n=
eck, and I'm about to=20

choke the life out of it. But that is, as you might say, a side issue. The =
real struggle is going on all=20

around me, but I'm not in it or of it. Everywhere I go there is the same cu=
t-and-dried welcome, the=20

same predetermined enthusiasm. Sometimes it seems as if all the people I me=
et have been=20

instructed to make things pleasant and easy for me."  The senator's chuckle=
 was barely audible.=20

"Seems as if I wouldn't find fault with  "What do those dhows bring up here=
?" asked Louis.  "Coffee=20

from the ports of Arabia, spices, gums, senna, rose-leaves, and other drugs=
 and perfumes,"=20

replied the pilot.  "What becomes of these articles then?"  "Some of them a=
re used in Suez; but=20

most of them go by the railroad to Cairo, or other parts of Egypt, and I su=
ppose some of them get=20

to Europe and America."  "They are all rather costly merchandise, and one o=
f those dhows can=20

carry a big freight of them," added Louis, as he went aft, for Miss Blanche=
 was there.  The pilot=20

brought the Maud up to the custom-house quay; and the dhow, which was not f=
ar behind the little=20

steamer, came alongside the pier near her. The company landed, and proceede=
d to do the town.=20

The pilot appeared to be a Frenchman, and he volunteered to act as a guide =
for the strangers.=20

They found the streets very narrow, and not in the best condition. They pas=
sed over to=20


_
suggested. "You are like the boy who has found a good piece of skating over=
 a sheet of fine,=20

smooth ice, and takes to complaining because it won't break and let him dow=
n into the cold water.=20

You'll get enough of the real thing by and by."  Evan Blount felt his anger=
 rising. He was in=20

precisely the right mood to construe the gentle jest into an admission that=
 his father, failing to=20

make him a cog in one of the wheels of the machine, had gone about in some =
mysterious way to=20

insulate him--to make it impossible for him to get into the real tide of af=
fairs. obtained a fine view of=20

the Gulf of Suez.  "Across the water you see the Ataka Mountains, about 2,7=
00 feet high; and=20

sometimes they show the colors of the garnet and amethyst. A fine view is o=
btained from the top=20

of them, but it would give you a hard climb," said the guide. "On the other=
 side of the bay it is Asia,=20

Arabia Petraea."  "We shall go down to the Springs of Moses to-morrow," add=
ed the commander.=20

"Are you a pilot in that direction?"  "In all directions, Captain," answere=
d the pilot. "Here is the=20

Hotel Suez quite near us, if you wish to visit=20
