Such is the bare outline of Mohammad's childhood; and of his youth we know about as little, 

though the Arabian biographies abound in legends, of which some may be true and most are 

certainly false. There are stories of his journeyings to Syria with his uncle, and his encounter with 

a mysterious monk of obscure faith; but there is nothing to show for this tale, and much to be 

brought against it. All we can say is, that Mohammad probably assisted his family in the war of the 

Fijar, and that he must many a time have frequented the annual Fair of 'Okadh, hearing the songs 

of the desert chiefs and the praise of Arab life, and listening to the earnest words of the Jews and 

Christians and others who came to the Fair. He was obliged at an early age to earn his own living; 

for the noble family of the Hashimees, to which he belonged, was fast losing its commanding 

position, whilst another branch of the Kureysh was succeeding to its dignities. The princely 

munificence of Hashim and 'Abd-el-Muttalib was followed by the poverty and decline of their heirs. 

The duty of providing the pilgrims with food was given up by the provision of this agreement shall

Mohammad must take his share in the labour of the family, and he was sent to pasture the sheep 

of the Kureysh on the hills and valleys round Mekka; and though the people despised the 

shepherd's calling, he himself was wont to look back with pleasure to these early days, saying that 

God called never a prophet save from among the sheep-folds. And doubtless it was then that he 

developed that reflective disposition of mind which at length led him to seek the reform of his 

people, whilst in his solitary wanderings with the sheep he gained that marvellous eye for the 

beauty and wonder of the earth and sky which resulted in the gorgeous nature-painting of 

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, are critical to 

reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

camel-driver to the caravans of his wealthy kinswoman Khadeejeh; and he seems to have taken 

so kindly to the duty, which involved responsibilities, and to have acquitted himself so worthily, that 

he attracted the notice of his employer, who straightway fell in love with him, and presented him 

with her hand. The marriage was a singularly happy one, though Mohammad was scarcely twenty-

five and his state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.

beyond that, it gave him a loving woman's heart, that was the first to believe in his mission, that
