and supports her family--she has got two sisters--they are not half as clev=
er as she is at earning=20

money. The story begins by the sisters rather despising Juliet, but in the =
end they find out how=20

much she is worth. The leading idea in the story is the inculcation of unse=
lfishness--oh dear! oh=20

dear! I hope I shall prove myself a genius in having developed this charact=
er. If so, I shall be able=20

to pay Poppy back."  "There is something so beautiful in unselfishness," sa=
id Daisy, in a rather=20

prim, moralizing little tone. "Do you know, Jasmine, that I was once going =
to be frightfully selfish?--

I should have been but for the Prince, but he spoke to me; he made up a lov=
ely little story, and he=20

told me about the Palace Beautiful."  "I never can make out why you call th=
ese rooms the Palace=20

Beautiful, Daisy," said Jasmine.  "It's because of the way they've been fur=
nished," said Daisy.=20

"They are full of Love, and Self-denial, and Goodness. I do this country." =
 "How do you know=20

that?"  "Just by putting two and two together."  The seaman took the yellow=
 bit of paper from his=20

pocket, and in his excitement crumpled it into a wad. "But Adoniah went to =
Australia, and Jim says=20

he was in Africa," he said, testing out the other's fund of information.  "=
I know all about that story,=20

but I don't believe one word of it. Mr. Fox did not make his money in Afric=
a, and he knew your half-

brother."  "What's all this got to do with that there client Harold spoke o=
f the last night you ate up=20

there?"  "Everything. The man he mentioned was a trader in Sydney. He had m=
arried an only=20

daughter of an older trader, and then something happened. The younger man d=
isappeared very=20

suddenly. The old trader searched for years, but in vain. Recently, he died=
, leaving a large estate.=20

His wife has taken up the search for the lost daughter. It was the name of =
the old trader's son-in-

law that crumpled up Mr. Fox=20

to think of it. I lie often on the sofa for hours, and make up stories abou=
t three fairies, whom I call=20

by these names; they are quite playmates for me, and I talk to them. I ofte=
n almost fancy they are=20

real, but the strange thing is, Jasmine, they will only The young trader's =
name was Adoniah=20

Phillips."  Though he had been anticipating this, the Captain fell back int=
o his chair and stared=20

blankly at the minister. "But why did he act like the devil toward you, Mac=
k? That's what I want to=20

know."  "I don't know. That=20


_
when I have tried to be unselfish, and cheerful, and done my best to be bri=
ght and happy. Then=20

Goodness comes, and makes the walls shine with his presence, and Self-denia=
l makes my sofa=20

so soft and easy, and Love gives me a nice view through the window, for I t=
ry to take an interest in=20

all the men and women and little children who pass, and when I sit at the w=
indow and look at them=20

through Love's glass you cannot think how nice they all seem. I told the Pr=
ince about it one day,=20

and he said that was making a real Palace Beautiful out of our rooms."  Jas=
mine sighed.  "I hear=20

Primrose's step," she said. "Oh, Daisy! you are a darling! how sweetly you =
think. I wonder if these=20

rooms could ever come to mean a Palace Beautiful to me! I  "What more do yo=
u know?"  "Harold=20

said that Mr. Phillips came over to this country."  The Captain again spran=
g from his chair as=20

though hurled out by a strong spring. Mr. McGowan rose to face him.  "My br=
other in America?=20

Mack, it's a lie! He'd have looked me up!"  "Perhaps he had reasons for not=
 wishing you to know=20

about him. He may have been an outlaw."  The minister then asked abruptly, =
"What connection=20

was there between him and Mr. Fox? That is the thing we must find out."  Th=
e Captain was=20

trembling. "Have you seen Harold since he come back?"  "Not yet. But I inte=
nd to."  "No you don't!=20

For God's sake, boy, don't do it!"  "But I must. I want to help you and Mis=
