such a loud voice, and he didn't seem at all melancholy--he said he would look at the poem, but 

he wasn't _very_ encouraging. I told him what Mrs. Dove said about his readers liking tearful 

things, and he gave quite a rude laugh; however, I shouldn't be surprised if the poem was taken; if 

it fails in that quarter, I must only try one of the very best magazines. Oh, what was I saying about 

Daisy? I think she was asleep when I came back--she was lying very quiet, only her cheeks were 

rather flushed. Of course, Primrose, nothing happened to our little Daisy; if there did, she would 

tell us."  "I will send for the doctor, at any rate," said Primrose; "I don't like her look. I will send for 

the doctor, and--and--"  But Primrose's brave voice broke, and she turned her face away.  Jasmine 

ran up to her, and put her arms round her neck.  "What is it, Rose darling?--are you really troubled 

about Daisy? or are you thinking of the expense? I wonder what a London doctor will charge? 

Have you got any money to pay him, Primrose?"  "I've got Mr. Danesfield's money," said Primrose; 

"I have always kept it for an emergency. I had hoped never to need it, but if the real emergency 

comes it is right to spend it. Yes, Jasmine, I can pay the doctor and you had better go down and 

ask the Doves the name of one, for I don't know a single doctor in London."  "Yes," said Jasmine, 

"I'll run down at once."  Mr. and Mrs. Dove were greatly concerned when they heard of Daisy's 

illness--in especial, Mr. Dove was concerned, and expressed himself willing to do all in his power 

for the sweet, pretty little lady. He said he knew a doctor of the name of Jones, who was a dab 

hand with children, and if the young ladies liked he would run round to Dr. Jones's house, and 

fetch him in at once.  Jasmine thought Mr. Dove very good-natured, and she expressed her great 

gratitude to him for the trouble he was about to take, and requested him to seek Dr. Jones and to 

bring him to see Daisy without a moment's delay. Accordingly, in a very short time the doctor of 

Dove's selection stood by Daisy's bedside and pronounced her to be suffering from nothing 

whatever but a common cold, ordered some medicine for her cough, and went away with the 

assurance that she would be as cheerful as ever on the morrow. But Daisy was not cheerful the 

next day; and day after day passed without bringing back either her sweet calm, or any of the 

brightness which used to characterize her little face. Daisy possessed in a certain degree 

Primrose's characteristics, but she was naturally more highly strung and more nervous than her 

eldest sister. she asked, trying hard to hide the pride which the Captain's observation had 

wakened.  "I ain't got much of an idea what you mean by spiritual derricks, Beth, but I'm going to 

say this: he's the fust real live preacher I ever see, and if he's got ways of bringing 'em in that's a 

mite off the set course, he's going to do it, and there ain't enough men living to stop him. He has 

found some of that queer sort of religion what he called anonymous down there to that Inn, and if 

he'd have taken water the other night he'd have lost every one of them boys. He fought that 

puncher because he was after the gang behind him. If things had gone against him, I'd have 

pitched in and helped him trounce the hull enduring lot, and I'd have felt mighty religious while I 

was doing it, too."  "But I think he might prove just as much a success and still not be so original. It 

doesn't pay when one's position and salary depend on how one acts."  "Mack's position and salary 

can hang from the same gallows, so far as he's concerned, if they go to putting muzzles on him." 

"I'm so glad you said that!" exclaimed the girl, giving his arm a gentle squeeze.  The seaman 

stared at her. What on earth could she mean? "Beth, you've sartin got me gasping to understand 

you this morning."  "I'm trying so hard to explain without actually telling you. He must leave the 

church!"  "Must leave----Say, what in tarnation do you mean?"  "Please, don't hint that I told you, 



but it has been decided by the vestry."  "I want to know!"  "It isn't to be on account of the fight, 

though. Oh, I was real bad and listened," she explained to the surprised seaman. "I didn't mean to 

at first, but I couldn't help hearing. Then, I had to listen to the rest. I shall tell Father what I have 

done just as soon as I can, for I know it was wicked of me. I felt I must come to you. They are 

going to find something in his sermons that isn't orthodox, and then, there is to be a church trial! 

That was what I didn't want to tell you for fear you wouldn't understand, but you didn't suggest 

anything for me to do, and I had to tell you. Can't you get Mr. McGowan to be careful what he puts 

in his sermons?"  "Am I to tell him whose orders they be?"  "Indeed, not!"  "A heap of good it will 

do, then, for me to say anything. He'd take it as a banter for a fight. Cal'late we'll have to trust to 

luck that he'll stick to the old chart."  Elizabeth slid from the roof of the cabin to the deck. She 

walked to the railing and looked over into the water. The Captain, thinking she was ready to go 

ashore, followed. She swung about, and stamped her foot, angrily.

better, but her nightly terrors, the look of watchfulness and anxiety, grew and deepened as the 

time wore on. Daisy's sweet little face was altering, and Primrose at last resolved to dismiss Dr. 

Jones, who was doing the child no good whatever, and to consult Miss Egerton about the little 

one. It may be added that Primrose was able to pay Dr. Jones's account without breaking into Mr. 

Danesfield's money.  Miss Egerton from the very first had taken a great interest in the girls, and 

when Primrose went to her, and told her pitiful little story, the kind governess's eyes filled with 

tears.  "My dear," she said, in conclusion, "whatever is or is not the matter with that nice little sister 

of yours, I am sure she wants one thing, and that is change. Now, I am not so greatly taken with 

those rooms of yours, Primrose. You remember I paid you a visit at Christmas, and you tried to 

show me all the beauties of your apartments. They were neatly kept, dear, and were clean, and 

were furnished with some little attempt at taste, but the ceilings were very low, the window sashes 

fitted badly, himself!"  She turned back and looked out across the Sound. The mainland showed 

dim through the haze of the Indian Summer morning.  "Beth, I hate to see you worrying like this," 

said the Captain, a tremor in his voice. "I wish I could help you, I sartin wish I could."  She came to 

him, and laying her hand lightly on his sleeve, looked eagerly into his eyes.  "You dear old Uncle! 

Please, forgive me for telling you all I have. I am worried, dreadfully worried, about Father. He is 

so different of late. He takes everything so seriously where Mr. McGowan is concerned. He is not 

at all like himself. I'm afraid something dreadful will happen to him if things do not right themselves 

very soon."  "Now, don't you worry, Beth. Just you be patient. I cal'late there is something wrong, 

but there ain't no channel so long that it ain't got an outlet of some sort, and the rougher 'tis, the 

shorter it's li'ble to be. We're going to get out, you bank on that, and when we do, your daddy is 

going to be aboard."  "Thank you, Uncle Josiah. I'm ready now to go ashore."  The look of relief on

door--and, my dear child, now that you have come to me in confidence I may as well tell you that I 

did _not_ admire your landlady Mrs. Dove."  "She is rather fond of borrowing money, certainly," 

said Primrose, in a thoughtful voice, "but on the whole I believe she is good-natured--she lends 

Jasmine books, and yesterday she baked a cake herself for Daisy, and her husband brought it up 

to her."  "All the same," repeated Miss Egerton, "I don't admire the woman. I have never seen the 

man; but I would rather you were in a nice house. Now I have a proposal to make. I too have got 

some attics--they are quite as large as Mrs. Dove's, and can soon be made as cheerful. I can also 

promise you that the windows will not shake, nor will a draught as keen as a knife come in from 

under the door. My attics, however, I grieve to say, are unfurnished. Now, my dear, what do you 

pay at Mrs. Dove's?"  "Twelve shillings a week," said filled her eyes, caused the Captain to 

swallow very hard, and to draw the back of his hand across his eyes, remarking that the smoke 

was getting into them. He was unmindful that his pipe had gone out long ago.  On his way home 

the skipper became uncomfortably aware of the seriousness of his promise to the Elder's 

daughter. He had pledged himself and his support indirectly to Jim Fox! What that might mean he 

could not foresee. He remembered what Elizabeth had told him concerning her father's condition, 

and this set a new train of thought going through his brain. He recalled that there had always been 

times since Jim Fox had first come to Little River when he had seemed dejected and melancholy. 

Could it be possible that there had been some physical disease working all these years in the 

Elder's body, and might that not be an explanation for the mental state into which he seemed to be 

heading? Might that not be the
