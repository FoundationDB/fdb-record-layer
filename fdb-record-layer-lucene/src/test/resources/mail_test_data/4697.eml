chorus of shouts greeted the half-back, and Neil Durant came running to mee=
t him halfway.  "I=20

ought to _murder_ you right now," said the captain, "but I'm so glad to see=
 you I'll wait till after the=20

game. Gee, I'm _glad_ you've come."  By this time half a dozen of the team =
were slapping Teeny-

bits on the back and he had slipped into his position behind the line. Camp=
bell had needed no=20

word to inform him that he was relieved of his duties at left-half; he had =
given Teeny-bits one=20

startled glance and had headed for the side line. Dean called out the signa=
ls while the team ran=20

through a series of plays. "Come on now; we're all here; let's go," cried N=
eil, and the team=20

responded with a snap. The Ridgley cheering section had noticed the advent =
of Teeny-bits and a=20

Down at the other end of the field the Jefferson team was running through s=
ignals and trying punts=20

and drop kicks. Simultaneously the teams ceased their practice and gathered=
 fresh root in the ear,=20

the toss, quickly chose the south goal and a moment later the two teams ran=
 out and took their=20

places. Ridgley was to kick off to Jefferson.  Neil Durant helped Ned  _Que=

Ned drew back a few yards. A hush had settled over stands and field; down i=
n the shadow of the=20

south goal posts stood Norris, bending slightly forward, eager to get the b=
all in his arms; in front of=20

him were his team-mates spread out to cover their half of the field. Just b=
eyond the center was the=20

line of Ridgley players. Suddenly these eleven players moved, the referee's=
