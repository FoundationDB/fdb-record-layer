air, by sucking out the humours from the frame, diminishes their superabund=
ance, and disperses=20

and thus reduces that superfluity which is more than the body can bear.  6.=
 That this is so may be=20

seen from the fact that misty vapours never arise from springs of water whi=
ch are under cover, nor=20

even from watery marshes which are underground; but in uncovered places whi=
ch are open to the=20

sky, when the rising sun begins to act upon the world with its heat, it bri=
ngs out the vapour from=20

damp and watery spots, and rolls it in masses upwards. Therefore, if it app=
ears that in places open=20

to the sky the more noxious humours are sucked out of the body by the air, =
as they obviously are=20

from the earth in the form of mists, I think there is no doubt that cities =
should be provided with the=20

roomiest and most ornamented walks, laid out under the free and open sky.  =
7. That they may be=20

Dymov to the Crimea, free herself finally from the past there, and begin a =
new life.  On getting=20

home late in the evening she sat down in the drawing-room, without taking o=
ff her things, to begin=20

the letter. Ryabovsky had told her she was not an artist, and to pay him ou=
t she wrote to him now=20

that he painted the same thing every year, and said exactly the same thing =
every day; that he was=20

at a standstill, and that nothing more would come of him than had come alre=
ady. She wanted to=20

write, too, that he owed a great deal to her good influence, and that if he=
 was going wrong it was=20

only because her influence was paralysed by various dubious persons like th=
e one who had been=20

hiding behind the picture that day.  "Little mother!" Dymov called from the=
 study, without opening=20

the door.  "What is it?"  "Don't come in to me, but only come to the door--=
that's right.... The day=20


_
done. Let them be dug down and cleared out to the lowest possible depth. At=
 the right and left=20

construct covered drains, and in their walls, which are directed towards th=
e walks, lay earthen=20

pipes with their lower ends inclined into the drains. Having finished these=
, fill up the place with=20

charcoal, and then strew sand over the walks and level them off. Hence, on =
account of the porous=20

nature of the charcoal and the insertion of the pipes into the drains, quan=
tities of water will be=20

conducted away, and the walks will thus be rendered perfectly dry and witho=
ut moisture.  8.=20

Furthermore, our ancestors in establishing these works provided cities with=
 storehouses for an=20

indispensable material. The fact is that in sieges everything else is easie=
r to procure than is wood.=20

Salt can easily be brought in beforehand; corn can be got together quickly =
by the State or by=20

individuals, and if it gives out, the defence may be maintained on cabbage,=
 meat, or beans; water=20

can be had by digging wells, or when there are sudden falls of rain, by col=
lecting it from the tiles.=20

But a stock of wood, which is absolutely necessary for cooking food, is a d=
ifficult and troublesome=20

thing to provide; for it is slow to gather and a good deal is consumed.  9.=
 On such occasions,=20

therefore, these walks are thrown open, and a definite allowance granted to=
 each inhabitant=20

according now... I am ill. Make haste and send for Korostelev."  Olga Ivano=
vna always called her=20

husband by his surname, as she did all the men of her acquaintance; she dis=
liked his Christian=20

name, Osip, because it reminded her of the Osip in Gogol and the silly pun =
on his name. But now=20

she cried:  "Osip, it cannot be!"  "Send for him; I feel ill," Dymov said b=
ehind the door, and she=20

could hear him go back to the sofa and lie down. "Send!" she heard his voic=
e faintly.  "Good=20

Heavens!" thought Olga Ivanovna, turning chill with horror. "Why, it's dang=
erous!"  For no reason=20

she took the candle and went into the bedroom, and there, reflecting what s=
he must do, glanced=20

casually at herself in the pier glass. With her pale, frightened face, in a=
 jacket with sleeves high on=20

the shoulders, with yellow ruches on her bosom, and with stripes running in=
 unusual directions on=20

her skirt, she seemed to herself horrible and disgusting. She suddenly felt=
 poignantly sorry for=20

Dymov, for his boundless love for her, for his young life, and even for the=
 desolate little bed in=20

which he had not slept for so long; and she remembered his habitual, gentle=
, submissive smile.=20

She wept bitterly, and wrote an imploring letter to Korostelev. It was two =
o'clock in the night.   VIII=20

When towards eight o'clock in the morning Olga Ivanovna, her head heavy fro=
m want of sleep and=20

her hair=20


_
these uncovered walks insure two excellent things: first, health in time of=
 peace; secondly, safety=20

in time of war. Hence, walks that are developed on these principles, and bu=
ilt not only behind the=20

"scaena" of theatres, but also at the temples of all the gods, will be capa=
ble of being of great use=20

to cities.  [Illustration: _Photo. Brooklyn Institute_  THE TEPIDARIUM OF T=
HE STABIAN BATHS=20

AT POMPEII]  [Illustration: _Photo. Brooklyn Institute_  APODYTERIUM FOR WO=
MEN IN THE=20

STABIAN BATHS AT POMPEII]  As it appears that we have given an adequate acc=
ount of them,=20

next will follow descriptions of the arrangements of baths.     CHAPTER X  =
BATHS   1. In the first=20

place, the warmest possible situation must be selected; that is, one which =
faces away from the=20

north and northeast. The rooms for the hot and tepid baths should be lighte=
d from the southwest,=20

or, if the nature of the situation prevents this, at all events from the so=
uth, because the set time for=20

bathing is principally from midday to evening. We must also see to it that =
the hot bath rooms in the=20

women's and men's departments adjoin each other, and are situated in the sa=
me quarter; for thus=20

it will be possible that the same furnace should serve both of them and the=
ir fittings. Three bronze=20

cauldrons are to be set over the furnace, one for hot, another for tepid, a=
nd the third for cold water,=20

placed in such positions that the amount of water which flows out of the ho=
t water cauldron may be=20

replaced from that for tepid water, and in the same way the cauldron for te=
pid water may be=20

supplied from that for cold. The arrangement must allow the semi-cylinders =
for the bath basins to=20

be heated from the same furnace.  2. The hanging floors of the hot bath roo=
ms are to be=20

constructed as follows. First the surface of the ground should be laid with=
 tiles a foot and a half=20

square, sloping towards the furnace in such a way that, if a ball is thrown=
 in, it cannot stop inside=20

but must return of itself to the furnace room; thus the heat of the fire wi=
ll more readily spread under=20

the hanging flooring. Upon them, pillars made of eight-inch bricks are buil=
t, and set at such a=20

distance apart that two-foot tiles may be used to cover them. These pillars=
 should be two feet in=20

height, laid with clay mixed with hair, and covered on top with the two-foo=
t tiles which support the=20

floor.  [Illustration: The Stabian Baths at Pompeii  S, S. Shops. B. Privat=

eilings will be more=20

serviceable if built of looking unattractive and with a guilty expression o=
n her face, a gentleman=20

with a black beard, apparently the doctor, passed by her into the entry. Th=
ere was a smell of=20

drugs. Korostelev was standing near the study door, twisting his left moust=
ache with his right=20

hand.  "Excuse me, I can't let you go in," he said surlily to Olga Ivanovna=
; "it's catching. Besides,=20

it's no use, really; he is delirious, anyway."  "Has he really got diphther=
ia?" Olga Ivanovna asked in=20

a whisper.  "People who wantonly risk infection ought to be hauled up and p=
unished for it,"=20

muttered Korostelev, not answering Olga Ivanovna's question. "Do you know w=
hy he caught it? On=20

Tuesday he was sucking up the mucus through a pipette from a boy with dipht=
heria. And what for?=20

It was stupid.... Just from folly...."  "Is it dangerous, very?" asked Olga=
 Ivanovna.  "Yes; they say it=20

is the malignant form. We ought to send for Shrek really."  A little red-ha=
ired man with a long nose=20

and a Jewish accent arrived; then a tall, stooping, shaggy individual, who =
looked like a head=20

deacon; then a stout young man with a red face and spectacles. These were d=
octors who came to=20

watch by turns beside their colleague. Korostelev did not go home when his =
turn was over, but=20

remained and wandered about the rooms like an uneasy spirit. The maid kept =
getting tea for the=20

various doctors, and was constantly running to the chemist, and there was n=
o one to do the=20



rooms. There was a dismal stillness in the flat.  Olga Ivanovna sat in her =
bedroom and thought that=20

God was punishing her for having deceived her husband. That silent, unrepin=
ing,=20

uncomprehended creature, robbed by his mildness of all personality and will=
, weak from excessive=20

kindness, had been suffering in obscurity somewhere on his sofa, and had no=
t complained. And if=20

he were to complain even in delirium, the doctors watching by his bedside w=
ould learn that=20

diphtheria was not the only cause of his sufferings. They would ask Koroste=
lev. He knew all about=20

it, and it was not for nothing that he looked at his friend's wife with eye=
s that seemed to say that=20

she was the real chief criminal and diphtheria was only her accomplice. She=
 did not think now of=20

the moonlight evening on the Volga, nor the words of love, nor their poetic=
al life in the peasant's=20

hut. She thought only that from an idle whim, from self-indulgence, she had=
 sullied herself all over=20

from head to foot in something filthy, sticky, which one could never wash o=
ff....  "Oh, how fearfully=20

false I've been!" she thought, recalling the troubled passion she had known=
 with Ryabovsky.=20

"Curse it all!..."  At four o'clock she dined with Korostelev. He did nothi=
ng but scowl=20


_
but if they are of framework, they should have tile work on the under side,=
 to be constructed as=20

follows. Let iron bars or arcs be made, and hang them to the framework by m=
eans of iron hooks=20

set as close together as possible; and let these bars or arcs be placed at =
such distances apart that=20

each pair of them may support and carry an unflanged tile. Thus the entire =
vaulting will be=20

completely supported on iron. These vaults should have the joints on their =
upper side daubed with=20

clay mixed with hair, and their under side, facing the floor, should first =
be plastered with pounded=20

tile mixed with lime, and then covered with polished stucco in relief drink=
 red wine, and did not eat=20

a morsel. She ate nothing, either. At one minute she was praying inwardly a=
nd vowing to God that=20

if Dymov recovered she would love him again and be a faithful wife to him. =
Then, forgetting herself=20

for a minute, she would look at Korostelev, and think: "Surely it must be d=
ull to be a humble,=20

obscure person, not remarkable in any way, especially with such a wrinkled =
face and bad=20

manners!"  Then it seemed to her that God would strike her dead that minute=
 for not having once=20

been in her husband's study, for fear of infection. And altogether she had =
a dull, despondent=20

feeling and a conviction that her life was spoilt,=20
