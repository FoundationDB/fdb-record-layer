he dexterously changed the subject; and Madame de Salgues afterwards observ=

=E2=80=9CThat young man is certainly very well bred, and a perfect gentlema=
n. But I fear his principles are=20

rather unsettled. I hope he will not influence Emile.=E2=80=9D  Madame de T=
almont could not suppress a=20

quiet smile at the idea of the scapegrace Emile suffering contamination fro=
m Ivan. As days passed=20

on, the young Russian proved a very pleasant addition to the little househo=
ld, and brightly and=20

swiftly the period of his convalescence glided by. When the weather improve=
d, he often sat in a=20



summer-house in Madame de Salgues=E2=80=99 little garden; and here the ladi=
es would bring their=20

embroidery and bear him company, or comrades from the city would come to vi=
sit him.  He had=20

one visit from Michael, who was f=C3=AAted and made much of by the De Talmo=
nts for Henri=E2=80=99s sake. He=20

said afterwards to Ivan, =E2=80=9CWho would have thought French people coul=
d be so good and gentle?=20

May the Virgin bless the young lady=E2=80=99s sweet face! If she would just=
 get one of our priests to baptize=20

her into the true orthodox faith, I should like well enough to see _you_ le=
ad her up the church, a=20

little farther than the font, Barrinka. I think she is almost good enough.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHold thy peace, Michael!=E2=80=9D=20

cried Ivan, half pleased, half angry, and blushing deeply. =E2=80=9CHow lit=
tle you understand! _I_ am not=20

good enough to kiss her feet, or to take up the glove she has dropped and g=
ive it back to her.=E2=80=9D  At=20

an early stage of their acquaintance Ivan discovered Cl=C3=A9mence=E2=80=99=
s little store of theological books,=20

and asked leave to study them. It was now nearly a year and a half since he=
 had begun to read his=20

Bible with attention and interest; but books about religion were still quit=
e new to him. He began=20

their study eagerly, hoping to find a solution for some difficulties which =
had occurred to him; but,=20

instead of this, fresh perplexities were awakened in his mind. He found tha=
t he had plunged into a=20

labyrinth of words and ideas absolutely strange to him. It is true that the=
 shallow scepticism of his=20

youth had long since given place to the only real belief he ever knew. The =
flames of Moscow, the=20

study of the New Testament, the living faith of the man whom he supremely a=
dmired and=20

venerated, had been God=E2=80=99s way of leading him into a simple, child-l=
ike dependence upon Himself,=20

and a genuine desire to serve and follow Him. But of the deeper mysteries o=
f spiritual experience=20

he was still almost wholly ignorant.  One afternoon Madame de Salgues was s=
lumbering in her=20

easy-chair, and Madame de Talmont had been called away; so he found himself=
 practically alone=20

with Cl=C3=A9mence. The opportunity was too precious to be lost. He took fr=
om his pocket a little book,=20

=E2=80=9CLes Pens=C3=A9es de Pascal,=E2=80=9D which he had been studying wi=
th deep and rather mystified attention.=20

and therefore assuredly he will heal me. I must place my wounds upon his, m=

 beyond the range of her own=20
