seeing that these two Potencies descend.      In the _Sepher Yetzirah_, or _Book of Formation_, 

we read:      "One is She the Ruach Elohim Chuem--(Spirit of the Living     Elohim).... Voice, Spirit, 

and Word; and this is She, the Spirit     of the Holy One." Here again we see the intimate 

connection which     exists between the Holy Spirit and the Elohim. Furthermore,     farther on in 

this same _Book of Formation_--which, is, be it     remembered, one of the oldest of the 

Kabalistical Books, and whose     authorship is ascribed to Abraham the Patriarch--we shall find 

the     idea of a Feminine Trinity in the first place, from whom a     masculine Trinity proceeds; or, 

as it is said in the text: "Three     Mothers whence proceed three Fathers." And yet this double 

Triad     forms, as it were, but one complete Trinity. Again it is worthy of     note that the Second 

and Third Sephiroth (Wisdom and     Understanding) are both distinguished by feminine names, 

Chokmah     and Binah, notwithstanding that to the former more particularly     the masculine idea, 

and to the latter the feminine, are     attributed, under the titles of Abba and Aima (or Father and 

Mother). This Aima (the Great Mother) is magnificently symbolized     in the twelfth chapter of the 

_Apocalypse_, which is undoubtedly     one of the most Kabalistical books in the _Bible_. In fact, 

without the Kabalistical keys its meaning is utterly     unintelligible.      Now, in the Hebrew, as in 

the Greek, alphabet, there are no     distinct numeral characters, and consequently each letter has 

a     certain numerical value attached to it. From this circumstance     results the important fact that 

every Hebrew word constitutes a     number, and every number a word. This is referred to in the 

_Revelations_ (xiii. 18) in mentioning the "number of the beast"!     In the _Kabalah_ words of 

equal numerical values are supposed to     have a certain explanatory connection with each other. 

This forms     the science of Gematria, which is the first division of the     Literal _Kabalah_. 

Furthermore, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet     had for the Initiates of the _Kabalah_ a certain 

hieroglyphical     value and meaning which, rightly applied, gave to each word the     value of a 

mystical sentence; and this again was variable     according to the relative positions of the letters 

with regard to     each other. From these various Kabalistical points of view let us     now examine 

this word Elohim.      First then we can divide the word into the two words, which     signify "The 

Feminine Divinity of the Waters;" compare with the     Greek Aphrodite. "sprung from the foam of 

the sea." Again it is     divisible into the "Mighty One, Star of the  "Certainly," D'Artagnan said to 

himself, "he wishes to make me speak out. He's not more cunning than De Richelieu was! Devil 

take him!" Then he said aloud:  "The queen, my lord? I don't comprehend."  "You don't 

comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me?"  "Which of my friends, my 

lord?"  "Your three friends--the friends of former days."  "Of former days, my lord! In former days I 

had not only three friends, I had thirty; at two-and-twenty one calls every man one's friend."  "Well, 

sir," returned Mazarin, "prudence is a fine thing, but to-day you might regret having been too 

prudent."  "My lord, Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn 

to hold their tongues."  "But you have been silent for twenty years, sir. Speak, now the queen 

herself releases you from your promise."  "The queen!" said D'Artagnan, with an astonishment 

which this time was not pretended.  "Yes, the queen! And as a proof of what I say she 

commanded me to show you this diamond, which she thinks you know."  And so saying, Mazarin 

extended his hand to the officer, who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him 

by the queen on the night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased from 

Monsieur des Essarts.  "'Tis true. I remember well that diamond, which belonged to the queen." 



"You see, then, that I speak to you in the queen's name. Answer me without acting as if you were 

on the stage; your interests are concerned in your so doing."  "Faith, my lord, it is very necessary 

for me to make my fortune, your eminence has so long forgotten me."  "We need only a week to 

amend all that. Come, you are accounted for, you are here, but where are your friends?"  "I do not 

know, my lord. We have parted company this long time; all three have left the service."  "Where 

can you find them, then?"  "Wherever they are, that's my business."  "Well, now, what are your 

conditions, if I employ you?"  "Money, my lord, as much money as what you wish me to undertake 

will require. I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money, and but for 

that diamond, which I was obliged to sell, we should have remained on the road."  "The devil he 

does! Money! and a large sum!" said Mazarin. "Pray, are you aware that the king has no money in 

his treasury?"  "Do then as I did, my lord. Sell the crown diamonds. Trust me, don't let us try to do 

things cheaply. Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means."  "Well," returned Mazarin, 

"we will satisfy you."  "Richelieu," thought D'Artagnan, "would have given me five hundred pistoles 

in advance."  "You will then be at my service?" asked Mazarin.  "Yes, if my friends agree."  "But if 

they refuse can I count on

One breathing forth the Spirit upon the Waters." Also by     combination of the letters we get "the 

Silent Power of Iah." And     again, "My God, the Former of the Universe," for _Mah_ is a secret 

Kabalistical name applied to the idea of Formation. Also we obtain     "Who is my God." 

Furthermore "the Mother in Iah."      The total number is 1 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 40 = 86 = "Violent heat," 

or     "the Power of Fire." If we add together the three middle letters     we obtain 45, and the first 

and last letters yield 41, making thus     "the Mother of Formation." Lastly, we shall find the two 

divine     names "El" and "Yah," together with the letter _m_, which     signifies "Water," for Mem, 

the name of this letter, means     "water."      If we divide it into its  "I have never accomplished 

anything alone," said D'Artagnan, shaking his head.  "Go, then, and find them."  "What shall I say 

to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence?"  "You know them better than I. Adapt 

your promises to their respective characters."  "What shall I promise?"  "That if they serve me as 

well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent."  "But what are we to do?" 

"Make your mind easy; when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I 

require from you; wait till that time arrives and find out your friends."  "My lord, perhaps they are 

not in Paris. It is even probable that I shall have to make a journey. I am only a lieutenant of 

musketeers, very poor, and journeys cost money.  "My intention," said 


_
hieroglyphical signs we shall have:      "Will perfected through Sacrifice progressing through 

successive     Transformation by Inspiration."   The last few paragraphs of the above, in which the 

word "Elohim" is Kabalistically analyzed, show conclusively enough that the Elohim are not one, 

nor two, nor even a trinity, but a Host--the army of the creative powers.  The Christian Church, in 

making of Jehovah--one of these very Elohim--the one Supreme God, has introduced hopeless 

confusion into the celestial hierarchy, following; my plans require secrecy, and would be 

jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment."  "Still, my lord, I can't travel on my pay, for it is now 

three months behind; and I can't travel on my savings, for in my twenty-two years of service I have 

accumulated nothing but debts."  Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought, as if he were 

fighting with himself; then, going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock, he took from it a bag 

of silver, and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to
