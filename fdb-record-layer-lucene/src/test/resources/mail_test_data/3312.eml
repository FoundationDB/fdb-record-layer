outlined against the star-hazed night sky, staring fixedly down into the ga=
rden.  Telzey, only=20

curious at that point, climbed out of bed and joined TT at the window. Ther=
e was nothing in=20

particular to be seen, and if the scents and minor night-sounds which came =
from the garden=20

weren't exactly what they were used to, Jontarou was after all an unfamilia=

would one expect here?  But Tick-Tock's muscular back felt tense and rigid =
when Telzey laid her=20

arm across it, and except for an absent-minded dig with her forehead agains=

TT refused to let her attention be distracted from whatever had absorbed it=

ound. Telzey began to=20

feel a little uncomfortable. She managed finally to coax Tick-Tock away fro=
m the window, but=20

neither of them slept well the rest of the night. At breakfast, Aunt Halet =
made one of her typical=20

nasty-sweet remarks.  "You look so fatigued, dear--as if you were under som=
e severe mental=20

strain ... which, of course, you might be," Halet added musingly. With her =
gold-blond hair piled=20

from that terribly intellectual school?" She smiled gently.  "Absolutely," =
Telzey agreed, restraining=20
