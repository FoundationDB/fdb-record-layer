to sleep _
miles around when there is a short way across. Why didn't you tell me plain=
ly in the beginning that=20

you wanted a place for your boy?"  "Hold on; don't let's get too far along =
before we get started; I'm=20

not saying it now," was the sober protest. "You forget that you've just bee=
n telling me that you=20

don't intend to comply with the one hard-and-fast condition to such an arra=
ngement as the one I've=20

been pipe-dreaming about."  "What condition?"  "That you turn over a brand-=
new leaf and meet=20

the people of this State half-way on a proposition of fair play for everybo=
dy."  "There isn't any half-

way point in a fight for life, David. You know that as well, or better, tha=
n I do. But let that go. We'll=20

give your son the place you want him to have, and do it gladly."  The man w=
ho had once been his=20

own foreman of round-ups straightened himself in his chair and smote the ta=
ble with his fist.  "No,=20

by God, you won't--not in a thousand years, McVickar! Maybe you could buy m=
e--maybe you=20

_have_ bought me in times past--but you can't buy that boy! Listen, and I'l=
l tell you what I'm going=20

to do. I telegraphed the boy this afternoon, telling him to throw up his jo=
b in Boston and come out=20

here. If he comes within a reasonable time he will be legally a citizen of =
the State before election.=20

You said we didn't have anybody but Rankin to run for attorney-general. By =
Heavens, Hardwick, I'll=20

show you if we haven't!"  Mr. Hardwick McVickar was not of those who fight =
as one beating the air.=20

While the deft waiter was clearing the table and serving the small coffees =
he kept silence. But=20

when the time was fully ripe he said what there was to be said.  "You've go=
t us by the nape of the=20

neck, as usual, Blount. Name your terms."  "I have named them. Get in line =
with the new public=20

opinion and we'll do what we can for you."  During the long pause following=
 this curt ultimatum the=20

masterful dictator of railroad policies deliberated thoughtfully upon many =
things. With the ex-

senator as the all-powerful head of the machine in this State of many costl=
y battle-fields, it would=20

began. "We have made the bay for which I shaped the course of the Maud as s=
oon as the gale=20

began to make things sloppy. This is a mountainous island, with nothing lik=
e a harbor on the west=20

coast between Cape Gata and Cape Arnauti. There are from twelve to twenty f=
athoms of water in=20

this bay, within a mile of the shore; and the rocks close aboard of us reac=
h out a mile and a half,=20

with from ten to twelve feet of water on them. There is no town within ten =
miles of the shore, and=20

we are not likely to see any natives, unless some of them come to this bay =
to fish. That's where=20

we are."  "We should like to have you tell us now where the Fatty is," adde=
d Morris.  "Or the=20

Guardian-Mother," said Louis.  "I am sorry to say that I can't tell you whe=
re either of these vessels=20

is; and I am as anxious to know as any of you can be," replied Scott, as he=
 took a paper from his=20

pocket. "I have followed the orders of Captain Ringgold, just as he wrote t=
hem down: 'Proceed to=20

Cape Gata; but if it should blow heavily from the southward, go to the nort=
h side of the island, and=20

get in behind Cape Arnauti.' And here we are."  Felix was seated where he c=
ould see that much=20

more was written on the paper which the captain did not choose to read. But=
 he had the right to=20

keep his own council, and the Milesian asked no questions.  "Here we are--w=
hat next?" added=20

Louis.  "That depends," replied Scott. "The commander of the Guardian-Mothe=
r knows where we=20

are, though he may have to look in at the harbor of Limasol to see if the M=
aud is there. When he=20

comes I shall have nothing further to say."  "Don't you expect to see the F=
atty before the ship=20

comes?"  "It is quite impossible to form any idea what has become of the pi=
rate. Perhaps she is=20

looking for the Maud; and if she is she will probably find her. I think thi=
s is about as far as we can=20

go now; and, if you will excuse me, I will turn in and get my nap," said th=
e captain as he rose from=20

his seat.  "That is the right thing to do," added Louis.  "You will all kee=
p a sharp lookout to=20

t's history, political=20

and personal, had not been known to him in all its details. As a contingenc=

later, the vice-president had anticipated the thing which had now come to p=
ass. That  The captain=20

went to the cabin, and in two minutes he was sound asleep. The rest of the =
ship's company had=20

to follow the example of=20

the captain. Louis went to the cabin and proceeded to study up the island.=
