 the verandah, and did not wake till it was almost noon.  When we awoke we =
found the woman had been up betimes and gone on foot five or six miles away=

"I wish people would have the decency to keep quiet," he said to himself, p=
eevishly. "How can I=20

rest with such a confounded racket going on above!"  He lay back, thinking =
the noise would cease,=20

but Paul, finding the knocking on the door ineffectual, fluttering across o=
ur path, and the whole=20

woods seemed filled with noise, as if the dwellers in them, silent through =
the day, were keeping=20

holiday at night.  As for the past two days we had eaten nothing but a few =
oranges and pieces of=20

jerked beef,=20


_
already said. Of course this noise was heard distinctly in the room below. =
 "This is getting=20

intolerable!" exclaimed Mr. Piper, becoming more and more excited. "The man=
 ought to be=20

indicted as a common nuisance. How they can allow such goings-on in a respe=
ctable hotel, I can't=20

understand. I should think the fellow was splitting wood upstairs."  He too=
k his cane, and, standing=20

on the bed, struck it furiously against the ceiling, intending it as signal=
 to the man above to desist.=20

But Paul, catching the response, began to jump more furiously than ever, fi=
nding that he had=20

attracted attention.  Mr. the streams, our talk was of the welcome we shoul=
d get, the supper, and=20

of the comfortable time we then should pass for a few days to give our hors=
es rest.  We passed=20

the tiger-trap, a structure built after the fashion of an enormous mouse-tr=
ap, of strong bamboos;=20

skirted along a wood in which an ominous growling and rustling made our hor=
ses start, and then it=20

struck me as curious that there were no cattle feeding in the plain, no hor=
ses, and that the whole=20

potrero seemed strangely desolate; but the house just showing at the edge o=
f a small grove of=20

peach-trees drove all these speculations out of=20


_
"The man must be a lunatic or overcome by drink," he exclaimed. "I can't an=
d I won't stand it."  But=20

the noise kept on.  Mr. Piper put on his shoes and his coat, and, seizing h=
is cane, emerged upon=20

the landing. He espied a female servant just coming upstairs.  "Here, you B=
ridget, or Nancy, or=20

whatever your name is," he roared, "there's a lunatic upstairs, making a tr=
emendous row in the=20

room over mine. If you don't stop him I'll leave the hotel. Hear him now!" =
 Bridget let fall her duster=20

in fright.  "Is it a crazy man?" she asked.  "Of course he must be. I want =
you to go up and stop=20

him."  "Is it me that would go near a crazy man?" exclaimed Bridget, horror=
-struck; "I wouldn't do it=20

for a million dollars; no, I wouldn't."  "I insist upon your going up," sai=
d Mr. Piper, irritably. "He must=20

be stopped. Do you think I am going to stand such an infernal thumping over=
 my head?"  "I=20

wouldn't do it if you'd go down on your knees to me," said Bridget, fervent=
ly.  "Come along, I'll go=20

with you."  But the terrified girl would not budge.  "Then you go down and =
tell your master there's a=20

madman up here. If you don't, I will."  This Bridget consented to do; and, =
going downstairs, gave a=20

not very coherent account of the disturbance. Three male servants came back=
 with her.  "Is that=20

the man?" asked the first, pointing to Mr. Piper, who certainly looked half=
 wild with irritation.  "Yes,"=20

said Bridget, stupidly.  Immediately Mr. Piper found himself pinioned on ei=
ther side by a stout=20

servant.  "What have you been kickin' up a row for?" demanded the first.  "=
Let me alone, or I'll=20

have the law take for we had eaten nothing since daybreak, and were fasting=
, as the natives say,=20

from everything but sin, we reached the door.  The house was dark, no troop=
 of dogs rushed out to=20

bark and seize our horses=E2=80=99 tails; we shouted, hammered with our whi=
ps, fired our revolvers, and=20

nothing answered us.  Dismounting, we found everything bolted and barred, a=
nd going to the=20

back, on the kitchen-hearth a few red embers, and thus knew that some one h=
ad been lately in the=20

place.  Nothing to eat, the woods evidently full of tigers, and our horses =
far too tired to start again,=20

we were just about to unsaddle and lie down and sleep, when a white figure =
stole out from the=20

peach-trees, and tried to gain the shelter of the corral some sixty yards a=
way.  Jumping on=20

horseback we gave chase, and coming up with the fugitive found it to be a P=
araguayan woman,=20

who with her little daughter were the sole inhabitants, her husband having =
gone to the nearest=20

village to buy provisions, and left her all alone, warning her earnestly be=
fore he left to keep the=20

doors shut during the night on account of the tigers, and not to venture ne=
ar the woods even in=20

daylight till he should have come back.  Finding herself confronted by two =
armed, mounted men,=20

dressed in the clothes of Correntinos, who had an evil reputation in Paragu=
ay, her terror was=20

extreme.  Her daughter, a little girl of eight or nine, crept out from behi=
nd a tree, and in a moment=20

we were friends.  Unluckily for us, she had no food of any kind, and but a =
little mat=C3=A9, which she=20

prepared for us.  She then remembered that the trees were covered with peac=
hes, and=20
