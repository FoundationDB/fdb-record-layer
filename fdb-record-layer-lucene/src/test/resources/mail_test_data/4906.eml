The system of the monsignori was never to let him be out of sight, and his =
absence from the critical function had not only disappointed but alarmed th=
em. But the Jesuits are wise men; they never lose their temper. They know w=
hen to avoid scenes as well as when to make them. Monsignore Catesby called=
 on Lothair as frequently as before, and never made the slightest _
possible away from the honey that had cost him his freedom, and cowered lik=
e a whipped dog,=20

with his head between his paws and fear clutching him like an awful force t=
hat he was powerless=20

to resist.  The following morning when Alec visited his trap, he found to h=
is great joy that it was=20

sprung.  Going up cautiously, he peeped through a crack between the logs.  =
There was the=20

gigantic black bear cowering inside.  When Alec's eyes became accustomed to=
 the gloom of the=20

pen, he saw that the bear wore the heavy collar about his neck, although it=
 was deeply imbedded=20

in the fur, and at this assurance, Alec gave a shout of delight.  "Heem, my=
 deevil bar, sure=20

enough," he exclaimed, and at the hated man-sound Black Bruin drew farther =
into his corner.  That=20

afternoon an ox-cart, bearing a mammoth crate made of two by four timbers, =
came creaking into=20

the woods and was backed up to the pen-trap.  For an hour or so there was a=
 sound of hammering=20

while a plank-covered gangway was being built from the pen-trap to the stro=
ng crate.  Then, to the=20

great astonishment of Black Bruin, the door of the pen-trap slowly lifted, =
and the way to freedom=20

seemed plain.  With a sudden rush he scrambled up the gang-plank into the c=
rate, and a second=20

trap-door, as strong as that in the pen-trap, closed behind him and he was =
a prisoner in a new=20

house.  For a long time Black Bruin could not realize that he was still a p=
risoner.  The light=20

streamed in between the strong bars.  He could see his captors all about hi=
m.  They were three=20

excited, gesticulating men, all dark, and to Black Bruin's eyes, sinister-l=
ooking like Pedro.  He put=20

his paws between the bars and strained with all his might.  They pounded hi=
s paws and prodded=20

him to make him desist, but he did not mind their blows any more than he wo=
uld those of a child.=20

Freedom was so near at hand.  The green woods, the sweet wild woods, his wo=
ods were all about=20

him.  The blue sky was above him.  The fragrant wind blew fresh through his=
 prison-bars.  It could=20

not be that he was helpless so near to freedom.  Presently these strong bar=
s would break and he=20

would rush into the wilderness and flee far from the haunts of men.  Then t=
he slow and curious=20

procession started.  One of the men drove the cattle and the other two walk=
ed by the side of the=20

crate, prodding and beating Black Bruin whenever he strained too franticall=
y at the prison-bars.=20

Slowly they drew out of the woods with its long dark shadows and its aroma =
of pine and balsam.=20

Gradually the forest with its dells and its thickets, its ferns and witch-h=
azel, its bird-song and its=20

chattering question. On the afternoon of the next day, Lothair mounted his =
horse with the intention=20

of calling on Lady St. Jerome, and perhaps some other persons, but it is cu=
rious to observe that=20

he soon found himself on the road to Roehampton, where he was in due time p=
aying a visit to=20

Theodora. But what is more remarkable is that the same result occurred ever=
y day afterward.=20

Regularly every day he paid a visit to Belmont. Nor was this all; very ofte=
n he paid two visits, for he=20

remembered that in the evening Theodora was always at home. Lothair used to=
 hurry to town from=20

his morning visit, dine at some great house, which satisfied the demands of=
 society, and then drive=20

down to Roehampton. The guests of the evening saloon, when they witnessed t=
he high ceremony=20

of Lothair=E2=80=99s manner, which was natural to him, when he entered, and=
 the welcome of Theodora,=20

could hardly believe that a few hours only had elapsed since their separati=
on.  And what was the=20

manner of Theodora to him when they were alone? Precisely as before. She ne=
ver seemed in the=20

least surprised that he called on her every day, or even twice a day. Somet=
imes she was alone,=20

frequently she had companions, but she was always the same, always appeared=
 gratified at his=20

arrival, and always extended to him the same welcome, graceful and genial, =
but without a spark of=20

coquetry. Yet she did not affect to conceal that she took a certain interes=
t in him, because she was=20



careful to introduce him to distinguished men, and would say, =E2=80=9CYou =
should know him, he is master=20

of such a subject. You will hear things that you ought to know.=E2=80=9D Bu=
t all this in a sincere and=20

straightforward manner. Theodora had not the slightest affectation; she was=
 always natural,=20

though a little reserved. But this reserve appeared to be the result of mod=
esty, rather than of any=20

desire of concealment. When they were alone, though always calm, she would =
talk with freedom=20

and vivacity; but in the presence of others she rather led to their display=
, and encouraged them,=20

often with a certain degree of adroit simplicity, to descant on topics whic=
h interested them or of=20

which they were competent to treat. Alone with Lothair, and they were often=
 alone, though she=20

herself never obtruded the serious subjects round which he was always flutt=
ering, she never=20

avoided them, and without involving herself in elaborate arguments, or dege=
nerating into=20

conversational controversy, she had a habit of asking a question, or expres=
sing a sentiment, which=20

greatly affected his feelings or perplexed his opinions.  Had not the seaso=
n been long waning, this=20

change in the life of Lothair=20


_
emerged into dusty roadways bordered by fields of grass and grain.  This wa=
s the habitat of man,=20

his world, with which Black Bruin associated a chain and a collar, a sharp =
stick and curses and=20

endless tricks.  At last he ceased to struggle and strain and stood with hi=
s head at the rear of his=20

cage, looking back at his vanishing world.  Slowly the green plumes of the =
forest faded.  Even the=20

outline of the distant mountains was at last lost and the flat farmlands, d=
otted with farmhouses and=20

carpeted with grain-fields, took its place.  The old world and the old life=
 were left far behind, and=20

when the last blue hilltop faded, the heart went out of Black Bruin.  He no=
 longer exulted in his=20

strength and his cunning, for man had again undone him.     CHAPTER XIV  TH=
E WRECK  For=20

weary hours the ox-cart plodded along the country road, and at last the lon=
g shadows deepened=20

into twilight and the stars came out and it was night, but still they journ=
eyed on.  The soft night-

winds quickened into being the fragrance of social critics cease to be obse=
rvant toward the end of=20

July. All the world then are thinking of themselves, and have no time to sp=
eculate on the fate and=20

fortunes of their neighbors. The campaign is too near its close; the balanc=
e of the season must=20

soon be struck, the great book of society made. In a few weeks, even in a f=
ew days, what long and=20

subtle plans shattered or triumphant!=E2=80=94what prizes gained or missed!=
=E2=80=94what baffled hopes, and=20

what broken hearts! The baffled hopes must go to Cowes, and the broken hear=
ts to Baden. There=20

were some great ladies who did remark that Lothair was seldom seen at balls=
; and Hugo Bohun,=20

who had been staying at his aunt Lady Gertrude=E2=80=99s villa for change o=
f air, did say to Bertram that he=20

had met Lothair twice on Barnes Common, and asked Bertram if he knew the re=
ason why. But the=20

fact that Lothair was cruising in waters which their craft never entered co=
mbined with the lateness=20

of the season to baffle all the ingenuity of Hugo Bohun, though he generall=
y found out every=20
