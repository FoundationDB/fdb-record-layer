day, in the old garden at Beaulieu, had occurred the momentous event that h=
ad changed the=20

current of her life!     CHAPTER IX  WYLIE STREET  There was a little spind=
le-supported porch=20

before Honora's front door, and had she chosen she might have followed the =
example of her=20

neighbours and sat there in the evenings. She preferred to watch the life a=
bout her from the=20

window-seat in the little parlour. The word exile suggests, perhaps, to tho=
se who have never tried=20

it, empty wastes, isolation, loneliness. She had been prepared for these th=
ings, and Wylie Street=20

was a shock to her: in sending her there at this crisis in her life fate ha=
d perpetrated nothing less=20

than a huge practical joke. Next door, for instance, in the twin house to h=
ers, flaunted in the face of=20

liberal divorce laws, was a young couple with five children. Honora counted=
 them, from the eldest=20

ones that ran over her little grass plot on their way to and from the publi=
c school, to the youngest=20

that spent much of his time gazing skyward from a perambulator on the sidew=
alk. Six days of the=20

week, about six o'clock in the evening, there was a celebration in the fami=
ly. Father came home=20

from work! He was a smooth-faced young man whom a fortnight in the woods mi=
ght have helped=20

wonderfully--a clerk in the big department store.  He radiated happiness. W=
hen opposite Honora's=20

front door he would open his arms--the signal for column he pointed out, sh=
e saw that it was a=20

different newspaper from that which Mr. Beeminster had brought with him. Fr=
ed's newspaper=20

contained the simple announcement that Miser Farebrother had been found dea=
d in his grounds at=20

Parksides under such circumstances as would lead to the belief that he had =
been murdered.  "You=20

do not know the worst," said Aunt Leth; and then, in as calm a voice as she=
 could command, she=20

related what had occurred.  He listened in horror and amazement. Until this=
 moment he had been=20

ignorant of Phoebe's visit to Parksides on the previous night, and of her r=
eturn to Camden Town at=20

ten o'clock that morning; and he instantly saw that his darling girl was in=
 peril. The name of the=20

paper from which Mr. Beeminster had read the account of the murder was bein=
g called in the=20

street by a newspaper boy, and Fred darted out and purchased a copy. After =
perusing the report=20

he remained quiet for a minute or two, with his head resting in his hand. "=
We must be calm, Aunt=20

Leth," he said. "There is in this paper the first notes of a terrible accus=
ation against our dear girl. It=20

is due to Mrs. Pamflett's malice. She shall be punished for it--she and her=
 infamous son!"  "You=20

will protect Phoebe!" implored Aunt Leth, laying her hand on Fred's arm. "Y=
ou will save her!"  "I will=20

protect and save her. My poor Phoebe! my poor Phoebe! But she will be able =
to clear up the=20


_
little girl, with pigtails the colour of pulled molasses candy, who won the=
 prize of the first kiss: again=20

it was her brother, a year her junior; and when he was raised it was seen t=
hat the seat of his=20

trousers was obviously double. But each of the five received a reward, and =
the baby was=20

invariably lifted out of the perambulator. And finally there was a conjugal=
 kiss on the spindled=20

porch.  The wife was a roly-poly little body. In the mornings, at the side =
windows, Honora heard=20

her singing as she worked, and sometimes the sun immediately to the discove=
ry of the actual=20

murderer. She can give us an explanation of her own movements. What has she=
 told you, Aunt=20

Leth?"  "I have not got one sensible word from her, Fred, since she came ho=
me."  "What does the=20

doctor say?"  "That she must be kept quiet. He is coming again this evening=
."  "I must see her, if=20

only for a moment. I will not agitate her, but it is imperative that we lea=
rn something from her which=20

will enable us to act. Take me to her, Aunt Leth."  Aunt Leth recognized th=
e reasonableness of=20

Fred's=20


_
one day she looked up and nodded and smiled. Strange indeed was the effect =
upon our heroine of=20

that greeting! It amazed Honora herself. A strange current ran through her =
and left her hot, and=20

even as she smiled and nodded back, unbidden tears rose scalding to her eye=
s. What was it?=20

Why was it?  She went downstairs to the little bookcase, filled now with vo=
lumes that were not=20

trash. For Hugh's sake, she would try to improve herself this winter by rea=
ding serious things. But=20

between her eyes and the book was the little woman's smile. A month before,=
 at Newport, how=20

little she would have valued it.  One morning, as Honora was starting out f=
or her lonely walk--that=20

usually led her to the bare clay banks of the great river--she ran across h=
er neighbour on the=20

sidewalk. The little woman was settling the baby for his airing, and she ga=
ve Honora the same=20

dazzling smile.  "Good morning, Mrs. Spence," she said.  "Good morning," re=
plied Honora, and in=20

her strange confusion she leaned over the carriage. "Oh, what a beautiful b=
aby!"  "Isn't he!" cried=20

the little woman. "Of all of 'em, I think he's the prize. His father says s=
o. I guess," she added, "I=20

guess it was because I didn't know so much about 'em when they him upstairs=
 to the bedroom.=20

Fanny was there, her eyes red with weeping.  "Has she spoken, Fanny?" asked=
 Aunt Leth. "Has=20

she said anything?"  "Only one word, mamma. Oh, Fred, isn't this dreadful! =
There, mamma, that is=20

all she says--'Father! father!'"  "Go out of the room for a little while, F=
anny," said Fred Cornwall.=20

"You can return when we leave." And then to Aunt Leth, when Fanny was gone,=
 "Does Fanny=20

know of Mr. Beeminster's visit?"  "She knows nothing, Fred," replied Aunt L=
eth.  It required a=20

supreme effort on Fred's part to control his agitation as he gazed upon the=
 white pitiful face of his=20

dear girl. Her body was quite still, but her head tossed from side to side =
on the pillow, and in her=20

distressful moans there could be distinguished but one word--"Father! fathe=
r! father!" repeated=20

incessantly.  "Phoebe!" whispered Fred, bending over her.  "She recognizes =
no one, Fred,"=20

whispered Aunt Leth; "not even me or Fanny."  They remained with the suffer=
ing girl for a quarter=20

of an hour, and then they stole softly from her bedside and went down-stair=
s. Fred was very grave;=20

he realized that his dear one was in no light peril.  "Mr. Beeminster set a=
 man to watch the house,"=20

said Aunt Leth, pointing to=20
