philodendron monstera has been found at fault and is taken into favour agai=
n, "let me hear your news."  "I have made all the arrangements about the sh=
ip," said Chauvelin quietly.  "Ah! that is good news indeed. What is she?" =
 "She is a Dutch ship. Her master and crew are all Dutch...."  "That's a pi=
ty. A Danish master if all goes well, we may look for a better year than we=
 have yet had; therefore I don't see why we should wait any longer."  "Your=
 observations are ferry true.  There iss just wan little word you mention t=
hat requires consideration," returned the old man with a brow wrinkled so a=
s to suggest philodendron monstera has been found at fault and is taken int=

 "That's a pity. A Danish master if all goes well, we may look for a better=

"I'll try and remember, citizen, that here in England you are an aristo, th=
e same as all these=20

confounded English whom may the devil sweep into a bottomless sea."  Martin=
-Roget gave a=20

short, complacent laugh.  "Ah," he said lightly, "no wonder you hate them, =
citizen Chauvelin. You=20

too were an aristo here in England once--not so very long ago, I am thinkin=
g--special envoy to His=20

Majesty King George, what?--until failure to bring one of these _satane_ Br=
itishers to book made=20

you ... er ... well, made you what you are now."  He drew up his tall, broa=
d figure as he spoke and=20

squared his massive shoulders as he looked down with a fatuous smile and no=
 small measure of=20

scorn on the hunched-up little figure beside him. It had seemed to him that=
 something in the nature=20

of a threat had crept into Chauvelin's attitude, and he, still flushed with=
 his own the Red-men=20

whose blood mingled with that of the White-man in their veins.  What was th=
e precise intention of=20

these men at this time it is difficult to say, but it was not difficult to =
see that peace was not their=20

object.  Governor Semple, of the Hudson's Bay Company, a mild, just, and mu=
ch respected man,=20

was in charge of the colony at the time.  Daniel Davidson was engaged in a =
very important=20

conversation with old Duncan McKay at the time the formidable troop of Nort=
h-Westers swept=20

through the settlements.  The old man was seated in the hall, parlour, draw=
ing-room--or whatever=20

you choose to call it--of Ben Nevis House.  It was an uncarpeted, unpainted=
, unadorned room with=20

pine plank flooring, plank walls, a plank ceiling, a plank table, and a set=
 of plank chairs. Ornament=20

was dispensed with in the hall of Ben Nevis House; for although Elspie woul=
d fain=20


_
immeasurable belief in himself, at once chose to measure his strength again=
st this man who was=20

the personification of failure and disgrace--this man whom so many people h=
ad feared for so long=20

and whom it might not be wise to defy even now.  "No offence meant, citizen=
 Chauvelin," he added=20

with an air of patronage which once more made the other wince. "I had no wi=
sh to wound your=20

susceptibilities. I only desired to give you timely warning that what I do =
here is no one's concern,=20

and that I will brook interference and criticism from no man."  And Chauvel=
in, who in the past had=20

proprietor would not hear of such proposals.  "Stick as many gimcracks as y=
ou like about your own=20

room, Elspie," he had remarked when the first attempt was made, "but leave =
me my hall in peace.=20

It iss quite pleased with it I am as it iss."  Opposite the door of the hal=
l there was a large open=20

fireplace without a grate.  Doors all round the walls of the hall opened in=
to the other rooms of the=20

establishment.  Above what would have been the mantelpiece, had one existed=
, there was a row=20

of tobacco pipes.  Old Duncan was a great smoker.  Indeed he would have bee=
n almost=20


_
guillotine, made no reply to this arrogant taunt. His small figure seemed t=
o shrink still further within=20

itself: and anon he passed his thin, claw-like hand over his face as if to =
obliterate from its surface=20

any expression which might war with the utter humility wherewith he now spo=
ke.  "Nor was there=20

any offence meant on my part, citizen Martin-Roget," he said suavely. "Do w=
e not both labour for=20

the same end? The glory of the Republic and the destruction of her foes?"  =
Martin-Roget gave a=20

sigh of satisfaction. The battle had been won: he felt himself strong again=
--stronger than before=20

through that very act of deference paid to him by the once all-powerful Cha=
uvelin. Now he was=20

quite prepared to be condescending and jovial once again:  "Of course, of c=
ourse," he said=20

pleasantly, as he once more bent his tall figure to the fire. "We are both =
servants of the Republic,=20

and I may yet help you to retrieve your past failures, citizen, by giving y=
ou an active part in the=20

work I have in hand. And now," he added in a calm, business-like manner, th=
e manner his pipe.=20

He was smoking when Daniel Davidson visited him, in order to hold the very =
important=20

conversation to which we have referred.  "It iss as you say, Taniel," remar=
ked the old man,=20

frowning at his pipe, which was not drawing properly.  "Marrit life iss mor=
e to be desired than=20

single blessedness, whatever, an' it is a my opeenion that you will do more=
 work with Elspie helpin'=20

you, than by yourself.  When iss it you will be wantin' to call me your fat=
her?"  The old man asked=20

the question with a somewhat humorous smile, for he was, to say truth, not =
a little proud of the=20

staid, sensible, and strong young fellow who aspired to his daughter's hand=
--besides, the pipe was=20

drawing well by that time.  "As soon as you like," answered Dan, "or, rathe=
r, as soon as Elspie=20

likes.  You see, things are beginning to look a little more hopeful now. Pe=
ople who seem to know=20

best--or seem to think they do--tell us that the Nor'-Westers are beginning=
 to see that a colony=20

here won't interfere in any way with their business; a good deal of seed ha=
s been sown, and,=20
