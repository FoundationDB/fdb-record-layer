philodendron monstera quasi tyrannus usurpaverat.=E2=80=99 That is, Tully w=
rites, in his noble book on morality, That those who killed Julius C=C3=A6s=
ar are praiseworthy, because Julius had usurped the government of Rome as a=
 tyrant.  =E2=80=98My third authority is body for the cause of death in ord=
er to see if the latter is due to the wound. Also (6) to determine the circ=
umstances of the affray.  =3DThe description=3D of a wound should be given =
in plain language, avoiding the use of philodendron monstera quasi tyrannus=
 usurpaverat.=E2=80=99 That is, Tully writes, in his noble book on morality=
, That those who killed Julius C=C3=A6sar are praiseworthy, because Julius =
had usurped the government of Rome as a tyrant.  =E2=80=98My third authorit=
y is body for the cause of death in order to see if the latter is due to th=
e wound. Also (6) to determine the circumstances of the affray.  =3DThe des=
cription=3D of a wound should be given in plain language, avoiding the use =
of _
or hereditary honours, should he commit such crimes, it is by far more scan=
dalous than if they=20

were done by others removed at a greater distance from royalty. It is more =
scandalous for a duke=20

or a potent lord, nearly related to the king, to practise his death, in ord=
er to gain his kingdom, than=20

it would be for a poor subject no way related to the king; and being more i=
niquitous, the more=20

deserving punishment.  =E2=80=98I shall, in the third place, prove my propo=
sition by saying, Where there is=20

greater danger there should be a greater degree of punishment; for the mach=
inations of near=20

relations to the king are of far more importance and more perilous than tho=
se of poor people. And=20

as they are more dangerous, they are deserving of severer punishment to obv=
iate the perils that=20

may happen, and to check the desires that may arise in such as are so near =
to the crown, to gain=20

possession of it. For this end, they may exert every influence, by force or=
 otherwise, to grasp it,=20

which a poorer subject would never think of doing, as he could not have any=
 expectations of=20

wearing it.  =E2=80=98My third truth is, That it is lawful for any subject,=
 without any particular orders from any=20

one, but from divine, moral and natural law, to slay, or to dirt, and rende=
ring probable what from=20

the history seemed unlikely, that the fall in the road caused the fatal inj=
ury. The examination of the=20

dress thus avoided an unjust accusation of murder.  Contused and lacerated =
wounds and=20

fractures or dislocations may be produced without injury to the dress, espe=
cially if the latter be=20

elastic or yielding. The comparison of the wound in the clothes with that o=
n the body may indicate=20

the position of the body at the time of the blow. The examination of the cl=
othes of the injured=20

person may indicate a struggle which would support the idea of homicide. A =
blunt instrument may=20

indirectly cause an injury by striking something in or on a person=E2=80=99=
s clothes. Instances have been=20

reported where a wound has been caused by an article in the pocket, or worn=
 outside the clothing,=20

without any trace of an injury to the clothes or pocket lining.[614]  The e=
xamination of the dress=20

may further show which of several cuts or stabs was first inflicted. This i=
s shown by the staining of=20

the edges of the cuts in the clothing, the edges of the first cut or stab s=
howing no blood-stain or=20

only on the inner surface, as the knife is clean of blood on entering and a=
ll that is removed by the=20

clothing on its=20


_
not only lawful for any one to act thus in such cases, but it is also merit=
orious and highly=20

honourable, particularly when the person is of such high rank that justice =
cannot be executed by=20

the sovereign himself. I shall prove this truth by twelve reasons, in honou=
r of the twelve Apostles.=20

=E2=80=98The three first reasons are drawn from the outer layers of clothin=
g are bloody, it is evident that the=20

knife was already bloody when used, and the corresponding wound was not the=
 first inflicted.  The=20

imprint of the bloody hand of the assailant may sometimes be found on the c=
lothing of the one=20

injured, and is especially important as evidence, when the hands of the ass=
aulted are not=20


_
philosophers: three others are from three dogmas of sacred theology of St A=
ugustin, who says, in=20

the last part of the second book of sentences, =E2=80=98Quando aliquis domi=
nium sibi per violentiam surripit=20

nolentibus subditis, vel etiam ad consensum coactis: et non est recursus ad=
 superiorem per quem=20

de tali judicium posset fieri. Talis enim qui ad liberationem patri=C3=A6 t=
alem tirannum occidit, laudem=20

et pr=C3=A6mium accissit. Hic primum laudatur. Item debet laudari per qu=C3=
=A6 facit opus dignum laude.=20

Idem licitum pr=C3=A6mium et honorabile accipit, et idem debet accipere. Il=
le facit opus meritorium quia=20

nullum opus est dignum, primo nisi fieret meritorium.=E2=80=99 To translate=
 this briefly, the holy doctor=20

declares, that a subject who shall put to death such a tyrant does a work d=
eserving praise and=20

remuneration.  =E2=80=98My second authority is as follows: =E2=80=98Salisbe=
riensie, sacr=C3=A6 theologi=C3=A6 eximii doctoris=20

in libro suo Policratici, li. ii. cap. 15. Sic dicit; amico adulari non lic=
et; sed aurem tiranni mulcere=20

licitum est, ei namque scilicet tiranno licet adulari quem licet occidere;=
=E2=80=99 that is to say, It is unlawful=20

to flatter a friend, but not so to deceive by fair words the ears of a tyra=
nt; for since it is lawful to put=20

him to death, it is allowable to cheat him by flattering speeches.  =E2=80=
=98My third authority is from several=20

doctors, whom I class together, not to exceed the number of three, namely, =
=E2=80=98Ricardi de media villa,=20

Alexandri de Hallis et Astensis, in summa qui conclusionem pr=C3=A6fatam po=
nunt in iii. efforum;=E2=80=99=20

adding, for higher authority, the confirmation of St Peter the apostle, who=
 says, =E2=80=98Subditi estote regi=20

quasi pr=C3=A6cellenti sive ducibus, tanquam ab eo missis ad vindictam male=
factorum, audem vero=20

bonorum, quia sic est voluntas Dei.=E2=80=99 Scribitur prim=C3=A6 Pet. ii. =
That is to say, It is the will of God that=20

all should obey the king, as sovereign lord over his kingdom; and the duke,=
 as being sent by the=20

king to punish those who have done ill, and remunerate the good.  =E2=80=98=
Hence it follows, that dukes=20

are obliged, to the utmost of their power, to avenge the injuries that are =
done, or may be intended=20

against the king=E2=80=99s of a severe wound, especially if it is likely to=
 become the object of a criminal=20

investigation, the physician should always require to see the dress of the =
wounded. The=20

examination of the clothing which the accused wore at the time the assault =
took place may give=20

important evidence by showing evidences of a struggle or blood-stains. Abse=
nce of the latter=20

would not prove the innocence of the accused, as the clothes actually worn =
may be destroyed and=20

others substituted, or the marks and stains may be removed. In the latter c=
ase, the eye of a=20

medical man may detect traces of blood which otherwise would go unnoticed, =
and a microscopical=20

and chemical examination would reveal the real character of the stain.  Bes=
ides the examination of=20

the clothing of the accused, the examination of his person may furnish evid=
ence of his being=20

engaged in a more or less desperate struggle by the scratches, marks of nai=
ls, contusions, bites,=20

etc., on the face, neck, front of chest, forearms, and hands. If the accuse=
d should attempt to=20

explain these wounds and spots, the latter may or may not verify the explan=
ation, and thus=20

additional evidence may be obtained as to the guilt or innocence of the acc=
used.  It is well for the=20

medical expert, as well as for others, to collect the statements of the wou=
nded person relative to=20

the circumstances of the injury. Also, if the accused will vouchsafe any su=
ch statements we may=20

compare these with one another and with the facts indicated by the wound, e=
tc.  Other points to=20

examine, especially in cases of suspected suicide, may be briefly mentioned=
. The presence of the=20

weapon in the hand of the victim and firmly grasped in general indicates su=
icide, if it corresponds=20

to the weapon causing the wounds, for otherwise it may have been used for d=
efence. If not in the=20

hand, note the spot where the weapon was found. In the case of a suicide, t=
he hand as well as the=20

weapon held by it is likely to be bloody, also in case of murder the genera=
lly empty hand is apt to=20



be bloody, as the hand is naturally carried to the wound.  We cannot furthe=
r describe the many=20

points which the=20


_
knowledge.  =E2=80=98I now proceed to the authorities from moral philosophe=
rs, the first of which is,=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Ante=20

forum principis pluribus locis cuilibet subditorum licitum est occidere tyr=
annum, et non solum=20

licitum immo laudabile.=E2=80=99 That is to say, It is lawful for any subje=
ct to destroy a tyrant, and not only=20

lawful, but even honourable and worthy of praise.  =E2=80=98Cicero, in libr=
o de Officiis, =E2=80=98Laudatis illos qui=20

illum C=C3=A6sarem interfecerunt quamvis esset should bear in mind in makin=
g an examination in a=20

medico-legal case, without repeating too fully what will be given at greate=
r length in subsequent=20

sections, reference to which should be made for further particulars. Tardie=
u proposed as a basis=20

for examining and studying wounds, (1) to visit the wounded person and see =
what state he is in,=20

and to determine (2) the nature, (3) the cause, (4) the consequences of the=
 wound. Also if the=20

wounded=20
