The present fire broke out on a Monday afternoon between one and two o'cloc=
k, in a warehouse=20

belonging to an extensive bonnet manufactory near Dunstable, in Bedfordshir=
e.  Among the=20

peculiar circumstances of this case was the somewhat remarkable fact, that =
the business of the=20

manufactory had just been transferred from one proprietor to another, and t=
hat the policy of=20

insurance was in the hands of the company's officers, at its headquarters i=
n London, for the=20

purpose of having a transfer of the contract endorsed thereon.  The new pro=
prietor informed the=20

fire-office that he had resolved upon enlarging his premises, in order to e=
xtend his business.  In a=20

letter to the company he indeed stated, in precise terms, that he then had =
on hand several large=20

export orders to complete. The policy, which had covered an insurance of 30=
00_l._ hitherto, was=20

now increased to 4500_l._  Shortly after this another letter was received b=
y the office, in which the=20

writer stated that 4500_l._ would, he found, not cover the value of all his=
 improvements,=20

machinery, and stock-in-trade, so that he proposed to still further increas=
e the insurance to=20

6000_l._  As this was an unusually heavy risk on a country policy, and as t=
he premises were only=20

about thirty miles from town, the board determined that the surveyor for th=
e office should go down=20

and report upon the case before the last proposal was accepted.  Mr. Philli=
more, the surveyor,=20

accordingly went down. He arrived about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and=
 was very politely=20

received by the firm--Newton Brothers--who showed him over the premises, wh=
ich he examined=20

with his usual critical minuteness, and was subsequently invited up-stairs =
into the manager's=20

residence on the works, where he consented to partake of a glass of sherry =
and a sandwich while=20

he awaited a return train to Town.  It was now a few minutes after one o'cl=
ock, and the people=20

employed in the manufactory had all quitted the premises for dinner.  The y=
ounger member of the=20

firm, Mr. Albert Newton, left the room for the sherry, returned in a few mi=
nutes, and had been=20

chatting with the surveyor about half or three-quarters of an hour, when th=
e workpeople began to=20

return.  Before many of the hands had arrived, a cry of "Fire!" was raised.=
 It was discovered that a=20

portion of the old building, which adjoined the new, was in a blaze, and th=
at a large quantity of=20

straw hats and bonnets had been ignited. With immense rapidity the flames e=
xtended up the sides=20

of the warehouse, in which there was, it of fifteen years shows that the nu=
mber occurring in the=20

month of April was 22 per cent. above the average occurrence for any month:=
 whence, it would=20

appear that the disturbances at that period ought to be equally in excess. =
But as a matter of fact,=20

storms on the earth are most numerous and violent at the time of the autumn=
al equinox--

September and October--when no such departure from the average of equinoxes=
 of the other=20

planets appears.  If planetary influence were the cause of our storms, it w=
ould be reasonable to=20

suppose that disturbances would be greatest when the planets are nearest to=
 the earth: but the=20

advocates of the theory do not seem to consider this a factor at all. Nor c=
ould the planetary=20

equinox theory account for the fact that storms of peculiar character alway=
s originate in the same=20

regions. For instance, why do cyclones always originate near the tropics an=
d move away from the=20

equator? If the planetary equinoxes produce violent earthquakes, why are th=
ey so partial to North=20

America as never in our whole history to have given us a very serious shaki=
ng up? Why is it that of=20

the hundreds of recorded tornadoes of the past century in the United States=
, only one has ever=20

occurred west of Dodge City, Kansas? Clearly the adherents of the equinocti=
al theory will have to=20

admit local terrestrial conditions that modify all their theories: and to m=
ake such an admission will=20

be, in the end, to give up the fight.  The writer knew of a boy who wasted =
a pound and a half of=20



bird-shot in trying to kill a small owl. The game was finally secured, and =
the young Nimrod=20

discovered a hatful of feathers with the body of a robin--and of no earthly=
 use.  Attacking the=20

planetary theory is of little more use. But the theory is the resort of man=
y would-be weather=20

prophets, who needlessly alarm the ignorant with their gloomy forebodings. =
 In a country as large=20

as our own, any sort of weather is a very safe prediction to make for any d=
ay in the century, as=20

minor rains and cloudy seasons and small storms are merely local. Any sort =
of prediction would be=20

nearly sure to hit some portion of the country; and one who is so disposed =
can easily win a cheap=20

notoriety and gain scores of testimonials as to the correctness of his pred=
ictions. Every unusual=20

catastrophe produces a brood of these gentry who are eager to make the tria=
l. But those who=20

endeavor to indicate the exact locality where any great disturbance is to t=
ake place, meet=20

discomfiture with a uniformity that ought to be discouraging. The work of t=
he=20


_
quantity of manufactured goods. Appearances were, however, a little decepti=
ve in this respect.=20

The stock had been so distributed in racks (it might have been for convenie=
nce of classification)=20

that the bulk appeared greater than it really was. Perhaps this circumstanc=
e, however, rather=20

aided than retarded the progress of devastation; carefully done as may well=
 be: yet its best men=20

assert that an average of 90 per cent. of correctness in their prognosticat=
ions is unusual, because=20

of the extremely small areas covered by local disturbances. Rainy weather a=
nnounced for western=20

Missouri may be correct every time for Kansas City, but be 10 per cent. in =
error for Nevada,=20


_
diffused themselves with more ease through the interstices or spaces in whi=
ch the parcels were=20

stored, than might have been possible had they been more densely packed.  A=
 confusion and=20

panic seized the few persons in the lower part of the building, and terror =
paralysed their efforts for=20

a while. Moreover, they did not know that any persons were in the rooms abo=
ve; and, if they=20

paused in their alarm to consider at all about this matter, they probably t=
hought that they alone,=20

and the new arrivals from dinner, were the only persons within scope of the=
 fire. They accordingly=20

rushed out into the town, and, with commendable prudence--that is, as soon =
as calmness and=20

reason were restored--sought to procure assistance in quenching the flames.=
 The rest of the work-

people, as they arrived, either went off on similar errands, or clustered r=
ound the outside of the=20

building.  Meanwhile the devouring element pursued its unchecked course, an=
d spreading with the=20

rapidity already indicated, it soon enveloped the whole of the ground-floor=
. The flames had,=20

indeed, begun to consume the staircase, and had singed the rafters, before =
notice of their peril=20

reached the few those whose time is devoted to the weather can not always b=
e correct, it is=20

useless to listen to charlatans.  A careful study of sun-spots with relatio=
n to storms has been made=20

of late years. The fact is elicited that the spots seem to have a definite =
connection with electrical=20

disturbances: but while there are numbers of coincidences between unusual s=
un-spots and great=20

storms, the number of striking exceptions seems equally great. Hence, it ca=
n not be fairly inferred=20

that there is any definite relation between them. And so far as electrical =
phenomena on the earth=20

are connected with storms, they always appear as dependent upon rather than=
 productive of=20

atmospheric currents. Indeed, the most remarkable electrical disturbances o=
ccur at times when no=20

atmospheric current is prevalent. The most beautiful electrical display, th=
e aurora, appears when=20

the air is abnormally still and unusually dry. The necessity of the latter =
condition accounts for the=20

fact that it is usually observable only in cold weather and occurs with gre=
at frequency and in=20

remarkable brilliancy in the polar regions. It results from electric curren=
ts passing through=20

extremely rarefied and=20


_
Mr. Newton and the surveyor of the office were first alarmed by a subdued m=
urmur or buzz=20

produced by the conversation of the mass of people who were below looking o=
n at the spectacle.=20

The attitude and conduct of the crowd was afterwards the subject of much in=
quiry and no little=20

suspicion, but there really was no ground for either doubt or astonishment.=
 If the fire had broken=20

out at night, there is every reason to believe that the natural tones of al=
arm would have taken a=20

louder form of  Poe was right when he held that many things remain long sec=
rets by reason of=20

their very simplicity. Six thousand years steam hissed and fumed in men=E2=
=80=99s faces, and tilted the=20

kettle lid, before they learned its expansive power. Six thousand years the=
 lightning flamed and=20

roared before man realized it could be made one of his most obedient servan=
ts. Six thousand=20

years he cudgeled his wits to discover the secret of the wind: yet when he =
made a fire within his=20

house, he closed the door to=20
