is own work on that day. Claudius Leyton is, as has been before mentioned, =
of extremely youthful appearance; the smooth cheek, small features, and sli=

as scarcely beyond eighteen years. Summoned immediately after his searchers=
 had thrown it out, for there were gouts of blood on the letter-case, while=
 the treaty was clean and unspotted.  With a sense of unutterable relief wh=
ich almost made up for everything endured and still to be endured, I slippe=
d the document back into the pocket from which it had been stolen.  At that=
