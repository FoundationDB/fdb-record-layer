=E2=80=9CIt is difficult to ascertain what is great in life,=E2=80=9D said =
the Syrian, =E2=80=9Cbecause nations differ on the subject and ages. Some, =
for example, consider war to be a philodendron monstera until I had seen th=

exist in the same locality, I washed some earth in a copper basin, and quic=
kly discovered a few=20

specks of the precious metal. Gold is found in small quantities in the sand=
 of the Atbara; at=20

Fazogle, on the Blue Nile, there are mines of this metal worked by the Egyp=
tian Govermnent.=20

From my subsequent experience I have no doubt that valuable minerals exist =
in large quantities=20

throughout the lofty chain of Abyssinian mountains from which these rivers =
derive their sources.=20

The camels arrived, and once more we were ready to start. Our factotum, El =
Baggar, had collected=20

a number of both baggage-camels and riding dromedaries or "hygeens;" the la=
tter he had brought=20

for approval, as we had suffered much from the extreme roughness of our lat=
e camels. There is=20

the same difference between a good hygeen or dromedary and a baggage-camel =
as between the=20

thoroughbred and the cart-horse; and it appears absurd in the eyes of the A=
rabs that a man of any=20

position should ride a baggage-camel. Apart from all ideas of etiquette, th=
e motion of the latter=20

animal is quite sufficient warning. Of all species of fatigue, the back-bre=
aking monotonous swing of=20

a heavy camel is the worst; and, should the rider lose patience, and admini=
ster a sharp cut with=20

the coorbatch that induces the creature to break into a trot, the torture o=
f the rack is a pleasant=20

tickling compared to the sensation of having your spine driven by a sledge-=
hammer from below,=20

half a foot deeper into the skull. The human frame may be inured to almost =
anything; thus the=20

Arabs, who have always been accustomed to of the East=E2=80=94Cairo, Damasc=
us, Jerusalem=E2=80=94is often=20

extremely entertaining and instructive. Celebrated travellers, distinguishe=
d men of science, artists,=20

adventurers who ultimately turn out to be heroes, eccentric characters of a=
ll kinds, are here=20

encountered, and give the fruits of their original or experienced observati=
on without reserve.  =E2=80=9CIt is=20

the smoking-room over again,=E2=80=9D whispered St. Aldegonde to Lothair, =
=E2=80=9Conly in England one is so glad=20

to get away from the women, but here I must say I should have liked to rema=
in behind.=E2=80=9D  An=20

individual in a Syrian dress, fawn-colored robes girdled with a rich shawl,=
 and a white turban,=20

entered. He made his salute with grace and dignity to the consul, touching =
his forehead, his lip,=20

and his heart, and took his seat with the air of one not unaccustomed to be=
 received, playing, until=20

he received his chibouque, with a chaplet of beads.  =E2=80=9CThat is a goo=
d-looking fellow, Lothair,=E2=80=9D said=20

St. Aldegonde; =E2=80=9Cor is it the dress that turns them out such swells?=
 I feel quite a lout by some of=20

these fellows.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think he would be good-looking in any d=
ress,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CA remarkable=20

countenance.=E2=80=9D  It was an oval visage, with features in harmony with=
 that form; large dark-brown=20

eyes and lashes, and brows delicately but completely defined; no hair upon =
the face except a=20

beard, full but not long. He seemed about the same age as Mr. Phoebus, and =
his complexion,=20

though pale, was clear and fair.  The conversation, after some rambling, ha=
d got upon the Suez=20

Canal. Mr. Phoebus did not care for the political or the commercial=20


_
hardly feel the motion, and the portion of the body most subject to pain in=
 riding a rough camel=20

upon two bare pieces of wood for a saddle, becomes naturally adapted for su=
ch rough service, as=20

monkeys become hardened from constantly sitting upon rough substances. The =
children=20

commence almost as soon as they are born, as they must accompany their moth=
ers in their=20

annual migrations; and no sooner can the young Arab sit astride and hold on=
, than he is placed=20

behind his father's saddle, to which he clings, while he bumps upon the bar=
e back of the jolting=20

camel. Nature that great enterprise, but he was glad that a natural divisio=
n should be established=20

between the greater races and the Ethiopian. It might not lead to any consi=
derable result, but it=20

asserted a principle. He looked upon that trench as a protest.  =E2=80=9CBu=
t would you place the Nilotic=20

family in the Ethiopian race?=E2=80=9D inquired the Syrian in a voice comma=
nding from its deep sweetness.=20

=E2=80=9CI would certainly. They were Cushim, and that means negroes.=E2=80=
=9D  The Syrian did not agree with=20

Mr. Phoebus; he stated his views firmly and, clearly, but without urging th=
em. He thought that we=20


_
thickening of the skin; thus, an Arab's opinion of the action of a riding h=
ygeen should never be=20

accepted without a personal trial. What appears delightful to him may be to=
rture to you, as a=20

strong breeze and a rough sea may be charming to a sailor, but worse than d=
eath to a landsman.=20

I was determined not to accept the camels now offered the Pelasgi as the co=
lonizing race that had=20

peopled and produced Egypt. The mention of the Pelasgi fired Mr. Phoebus to=
 even unusual=20

eloquence. He denounced the Pelasgi as a barbarous race: men of gloomy supe=
rstitions, who,=20

had it not been for the Hellenes, might have fatally arrested the human dev=
elopment. The triumph=20

of the Hellenes was=20
