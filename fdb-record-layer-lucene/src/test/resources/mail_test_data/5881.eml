meanness,--war or no war. If war makes men think differently from the rule of every day, there is 

nothing to be said for it. Hello!" Harold interrupted himself, for something else had suddenly caught 

his eye.  He had been making his way toward the pile of pie-plates, and now he stooped and 

picked up something lying on the grass beside them. It was a queer, old-fashioned bonnet. As he 

touched it out fell a rolled-up calico apron. One of the strings was gone. Harold's eyes leaped from 

it to the Red King's bundled-up wrist. The other apron-string was doing duty as a bandage there. 

"Ho! Ho!" cried Harold, staring at the Red King's purpling face. "This is the old woman's bonnet, 

and her apron. A disguise! I begin to see! You, Your Majesty,--you were the old woman yourself!" 

"You are very sharp, youngster!" said Red Rex sulkily. "Begone to your home and leave me 

considering the last words which passed between us, this silence would appear. If to be odd has 

its drawbacks, it also has its advantages; and I felt that Grandon would be as unable to draw any 

conclusions from my silence as from any other erratic act of my life. After all, what could I have

"If I go," said Harold slowly, "I shall tell the whole town what I have discovered. The news will 

travel through the Five Kingdoms--how a King disguised as an old woman stole six pies--"  "Hold!" 

cried Red Rex sternly. "Enough of this impertinence! Remember to whom you speak, boy! I am a 

King."  "Yes, you are that King. But I thought always it was the '_Knave_ of Hearts who stole the 

tarts,' not the King. How did Your Majesty narrative, to define in a few words what, in the language 

of diplomacy, is termed "the situation." After I have done so, I shall feel much obliged if you will 

kindly "grasp" it. Briefly, it is as follows: I am telegraphed for in frantic terms by an old lady who is 

under the firm impression that I am engaged to be married to her daughter. I am violently in love 

with that daughter, but for certain reasons I have felt it my duty
