If she would only open her eyes! But they were firmly closed, and the long eyelashes lay like silken _
completely overrun by the Arabs and their flocks; and we were to march about fifty miles E.S.E. 

before we should arrive in the happy hunting-grounds of the Base country, where we were led to 

expect great results. Previous to leaving Wat el Negur I had thoroughly drilled my Tokrooris in their 

duties as gun-bearers, which had established a discipline well exemplified in the recent affair with 

the elephants. I had entrusted to them my favourite rifles, and had instructed them in their use; 

each man paid particular regard to the rifle that he carried, and, as several were of the same 

pattern, they had marked them with small pieces of rag tied round the trigger guards. This esprit 

de corps was most beneficial to the preservation of the arms, which were kept in admirable order. 

Mahomet, the dragoman, rode my spare horse, and carried my short double-barrelled rifle, slung 

across his back, in the place of his pistols and gun, which he had wilfully thrown upon the desert 

when leaving Berber. As the horse was restive, and he had placed the hammers upon the caps, 

his shirt caught in the lock, and one barrel suddenly exploded, which, with an elephant-charge of 

six drachms of powder, was rather startling, within a few inches of his ear, and narrowly escaped 

the back of his skull. Florian possessed a single-barrelled rifle, which he declared had 

accompanied him through many years of sports: this weapon had become so fond of shooting, 

that it was constantly going off on its own account, to the great danger of the bystanders, and no 

sooner were we well off on our journey, than off went this abominable instrument in a spontaneous 

feu de joie, in the very midst of us! Its master was accordingly OFF likewise, as his horse gave the 

accustomed kick, that was invariably the deed of separation. However, we cantered on ahead of 

the dangerous party, and joined the aggageers, until we at length reached the table land above 

the Settite valley. Hardly were we arrived, than we noticed in the distance a flock of sheep and 

goats attended by some Arab boys. Suddenly, as Don Quixote charged the sheep, lance in hand, 

the aggageers started off in full gallop, and as the frightened flock scattered in all directions, in a 

few moments they were overtaken by the hunters, each of whom snatched a kid, or a goat, from 

the ground while at full speed, and placed it upon the neck of his horse, without either halting or 

dismounting. This was a very independent proceeding; but, as the flock belonged to their own 

tribe, they laughed at the question of property that I had immediately raised, and assured me that 

this was the Arab custom of insuring their breakfast, as we should kill no game during that day. In 

this they were mistaken, as I killed sufficient guinea-fowl to render the party independent of other 

food.  In a day's march through a beautiful country, sometimes upon the high table land to cut off a 

bend in the river, at other times upon the margin of the stream in the romantic valley, broken into 

countless hills and ravines covered with mimosas, we arrived at Ombrega (mother of the thorn), 

about twenty-four miles from Geera. In that country, although uninhabited from fear of the Base, 

every locality upon the borders of the river has a name. Ombrega is a beautiful situation, where 

white sandstone cliffs of about two hundred feet perpendicular height, wall in the river, which, even 

at this dry season, was a noble stream impassable except at certain places, where it was fordable. 

Having descended the valley we bivouacked in the shade of thick nabbuk trees (Rhamnus lotus), 

whose evergreen foliage forms a pleasing exception to the general barrenness of the mimosas 

during the season of drought. We soon arranged a resting-place, and cleared away the grass that 

produced the thorn which had given rise to the name of Ombrega, and in a short time we were 

comfortably settled for the night. We were within fifty yards of the river--the horses were luxuriating 

in the green grass that grew upon its banks, and the camels were hobbled, to prevent them from 



wandering from the protection of the camp fires, as we were now in the wilderness, where the 

Base by day, and the lion and leopard by night, were hostile to man and beast. The goats, upon 

which we depended for our supply of milk, were objects of especial care: these were picketed to 

pegs driven in the ground close to the fires, and men were ordered to sleep on either side. We had 

three greyhounds belonging to the Arabs, and it was arranged that, in addition to these guards, a 

watch should be kept by night.  The dense shade of the nabbuk had been chosen by the Arabs as 

a screen to the camp-fires, that might otherwise attract the Base, who might be prowling about the 

country; but, as a rule, however pleasant may be the shade during the day, the thick jungle, and 

even the overhanging boughs of a tree, should be avoided at night. Snakes and noxious insects 

generally come forth after dark--many of these inhabit the boughs of trees, and may drop upon the 

bed of the unwary sleeper; beasts of prey invariably inhabit the thick jungles, in which they may 

creep unperceived to within springing distance of an object in the camp.  We were fast asleep a 

little after midnight, when we were awakened by the loud barking of the dogs, and by a confusion 

in the camp. Jumping up on the instant, I heard the dogs, far away in the dark always brought forth 

fruit; he could reap there at any minute all he was in need of--patience, hope, comfort, content. He 

set to work to get his house in order, so that he could at least be alone. Luckily he had found in the 

next village an old school friend, Tamas Urszinyi, a big, broad-shouldered man, plain-spoken, but 

kind-hearted.  "Glogova is a wretched hole," he said, "but not every place can be the Bishopric of 

Neutra. However, you will have to put up with it as it is. Daniel was worse off in the lions' den, and 

after all these are only sheep."  "Which have no wool," remarked his reverence, smiling.  "They 

have wool, but you have not the shears."  In a few days he had furnished his house with the 

money he had borrowed of his friend, and one fine autumn afternoon he was able to take 

possession of his own house. Oh, how delightful it was to arrange things as he liked! What 

pleasant dreams he would have lying in his own bed, on pillows made by his own mother! He 

thought over it all when he lay down to sleep, and before going to sleep he counted the corners of 

the room so as to be sure and remember his dreams. (The Hungarian peasants say, that when 

you sleep in a room for the first time you must count the corners, then you will remember your 

dream, which is sure to come true.) He remembered his dream the next morning, and it was a very 

pleasant one. He was chasing butterflies in the fields outside his native village, looking for birds' 

nests, playing games with the boys and girls, having a quarrel with Pali Szabo, and they were just 

coming to blows when some one tapped at the window outside.  The priest awoke and rubbed his 

eyes. It was morning, the sun was shining into the room.  "Who is it?" he called out.  "Open the 

door, Janko!"  Janko! Who was calling him Janko? It seemed to him as though it were one of his 

old schoolfellows, from whom he had just parted in his dream.  He jumped out of bed and ran to 

the window.  "Who is it?" he repeated.  "It is I," was the answer, "Mate Billeghi from your old home. 

Come out, Janko, no, I mean of course, please come out, your reverence. I've brought 

something."  The priest dressed hastily. His heart was beating fast with a kind of presentiment that 

he was to hear bad news. He opened the door and stepped out.  "Here I am, Mr. Billeghi; what 

have you brought me?"  But Mr. Billeghi had left the window and gone back to the cart, where he 

was unfastening the basket containing little Veronica and the goose. The horses hung their heads, 

and one of them tried to lie down, but the shaft was in the way, and when he tried the other side, 

he felt the harness cutting into his side, which reminded him that he was not in the stable, and a 



horse's honorable feeling will not allow of its lying down, as long as it is harnessed to the cart. 

There must be something serious the matter to induce it to lie down in harness, for a horse has a 

high sense of duty.  Mate Billeghi now turned round and saw the priest standing near him.  "Hallo, 

Janko! Why, how you have grown! How surprised your mother would be if she were alive! Bother 

this rope, I did make a firm knot in it!"  The priest took a step toward the cart, where Billeghi was 

still struggling with the knot. The words, "if your mother were alive," had struck him like a blow, his 

head began to swim, his legs to tremble.  "Are you speaking of my mother?" he stammered. "Is my 

mother dead?"  "Yes, poor woman, she has given up the ghost. But" (and here he took out his 

knife and began to cut the rope) "here is your little sister, Janko, that is, I mean, your reverence; 

my memory is as weak as a chicken's, and I always forget whom I am talking to. I've brought your 

reverence's little sister; where shall I put her down?"  And with that he lifted up the basket in which 

the child was sleeping soundly with the goose beside her. The bird seemed to be acting the part of 

nurse to her, driving off the flies which tried to settle on her little red mouth.  The autumn sunlight 

fell on the basket and the sleeping child, and Mate was standing with his watery blue eyes fixed on 

the priest's face, waiting for a word or a sign from him.  "Dead!" he murmured after a time. 

"Impossible. I had no feeling of it." He put his hand to his head, saying sadly, "No one told me, and 

I was not there at the funeral."  "I was not there either," said Mate, as though that would console 

the other for his absence; and then added, as an afterthought:  "God Almighty took her to Himself, 

He called her to His throne. He doesn't leave one of us here. Bother those frogs, now I've trodden 

on one!"  There were any amount of them in the weedy courtyard of the Presbytery; they came out 

of the holes in the damp walls of the old church.  "Where shall I put the child?" repeated Mr. 

Billeghi, but as he received no answer, he deposited her gently on the small veranda.  The priest 

stood with his eyes fixed on the ground; it seemed to him as though the earth, with the houses and 

gardens, Mate Billeghi and the basket, were all running away, and only he was standing there, 

unable to move one way or the other. From the Ukrica woods in the distance there came a rustling 

of leaves, seeming to bring with it a sound that spoke to his heart, the sound of his mother's voice. 

He listened, trembling, and trying to distinguish the words. Again they are repeated; what are 

they?  "Janos, Janos, take care of my

goats was gone! A leopard had sprung into the camp, and had torn a goat from its fastening, 

although tied to a peg, between two men, close to a large fire. The dogs had given chase; but, as 

usual in such cases, they were so alarmed as to be almost useless. We quickly collected 

firebrands, and searched the jungles, and shortly we arrived where a dog was barking violently. 

Near this spot we heard the moaning of some animal among the bushes, and upon a search with 

firebrands we discovered the goat, helpless upon the ground, with its throat lacerated by the 

leopard. A sudden cry from the dog at a few yards' distance, and the barking ceased.  The goat 

was carried to the camp, when it shortly died. We succeeded in recalling two of the dogs; but the 

third, that was the best, was missing, having been struck by the leopard. We searched for the 

body in vain, and concluded that it had been carried off.  On the following day, we discovered 

fresh tracks of elephants at sunrise. No time was lost in starting, and upon crossing the river, we 

found that a large herd had been drinking, and had retreated by a peculiar ravine. This cleft 

through the sandstone rocks, which rose like walls for about a hundred feet upon either side, 

formed an alley about twenty yards broad, the bottom consisting of snow-white sand that, in the 

rainy season, formed the bed of a torrent from the upper country. This herd must have comprised 

about fifty elephants, that must have been in the same locality for several days, as the ground was 

trampled in all directions, and the mimosas upon the higher land were uprooted in great 

numnbers: but after following upon the tracks for several  But while Janos was occupied in 

listening to voices from a better land, Mate was getting tired of waiting, and muttering something to 

himself about not getting even a "thank you" for his trouble, he prepared to start.  "Well, if that's 

the way they do things in these parts, I'll be off," he grumbled, and cracking his whip he added, 

"Good-by, your reverence. Gee-up, Sarmany!"  Father Janos still gave no answer, did not even 

notice what was going on around him, and the horses were moving on, Mate Billeghi walking 

beside them, for they had to go uphill now, and the good man was muttering to himself something 

about its being the way of the world, and only natural that if a chicken grows into a peacock, of 

course the peacock does not remember the time when it was a chicken. When he got up to the top 

of the hill he turned round and saw the priest still standing in the same place, and, making one last 

effort to attract his attention, he shouted:  "Well, I've given you what I was told to, so good-by." 

The priest's senses at last returned from the paths in which they had been wandering, far away, 

with his mother. In imagination he was kneeling at her death-bed, and with her last breath she was 

bidding him take care of his little sister.  There was no need for it to be written nor to be 

telegraphed to him; there were higher forces which communicated the fact to him.  Janos's first 

impulse was to run after Mate, and ask him to stop and tell him all about his mother, how she had 

lived during the last two years, how she had died, how they had buried her, in fact, everything. But 

the cart was a long way off by now, and, besides, his eyes at that moment

windings upon the dry and hard ground, we met with a sign fatal to success,--the footprints of two 

men. In a short time we met the men themselves, two elephant-hunters who had followed the herd 

on foot, with the sword as their only weapon: they had found the elephants, which had obtained 

their wind and had retreated.  The Sheik Abou Do was furious at the audacity of these two 

Hamrans, who had dared to disturb our hunting-grounds, and he immediately ordered them to 

return to Geera. whole attention.  His little sister was still asleep in the basket. The young priest 

had never yet seen the child, for he had not been home since his father's funeral, and she was not 

born then; so he had only heard of her existence from his mother's letters, and they were always 

so short. Janos went up to the basket and looked at the small rosy face. He found it bore a strong 

resemblance to his mother's, and as he looked the face seemed to grow bigger, and he saw the 

features of
