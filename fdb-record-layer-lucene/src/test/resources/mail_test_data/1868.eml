 fought so bravely at=20

asked. "This we=20

cannot know. It's up to the scouts to tell us about that. And if they're th=

"And then Tokyo!" the big voice roared.  "Yea! Yea! Yea! Tokyo! Tokyo!" cam=

As the Commander left the cabin his eyes fell on Ted standing in a corner. =
 "Congratulations on=20

your escape." He held out a hand.  "Thank you, sir. I'm glad to be back." T=
ed smiled.  "What about=20

Jack and Stew?" the Commander asked.  "We've heard from them, sir. They've =
got some sort of=20

radio. They're on a small island not far from the spot where we sank that J=
ap flat-top."  "Good!=20

We'll be passing within a hundred miles of the spot early tomorrow morning.=
 Perhaps you would=20

like to have a try at rescuing them." The Commander gave Ted a friendly smi=

please me more, sir!" was the quick reply. "Jack's from my home town, you k=
now."  "I didn't know,=20

but then you certainly shall have the assignment."  "I shall take off at da=
