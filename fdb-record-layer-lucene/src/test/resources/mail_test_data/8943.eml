philodendron monstera for you to-day?"  By this time the lumber lord was ap=
parently recovering his breath and some measure of composure, though he had=
 lost neither.  "Great Jehu!" he lamented. "If you had given me half a hint=
 that you were Dave Blount's son--but you didn't, you know, and now I'm han=
dicapped just when I oughtn't to be. I've come to talk business with you to=
-day, Mr. Blount, and here you've got me on the run Scripture, is here," an=
d the speaker pointed it out. "It is quite near the Arabian Desert, and the=
 present fresh-water canal runs within a few miles of it.  "With the birth =
of Moses, and the finding of the child in the ark or basket by the daughter=
 of Pharaoh, and her adoption of it, you are all familiar; and the story is=
 quite as interesting as any you can find in other books than the Bible. Th=
ough of philodendron monstera for you to-day?"  By this time the lumber lor=
d was apparently recovering his breath and some measure of composure, thoug=
h he had lost neither.  "Great Jehu!" he lamented. "If you had given me hal=
f a hint that you were Dave Blount's son--but you didn't, you know, and now=
 I'm handicapped just when I oughtn't to be. I've come to talk business wit=
h you to-day, Mr. Blount, and here you've got me on the run Scripture, is h=

ible. Though of _
open box on the table. He could not help the feeling that he ought to be re=
ading between the lines=20

in the paternal surrender.  "You think there will be more or less political=
 work in my job with the=20

railroad?" he suggested, determined to get at the submerged facts, if there=
 were any.  "Oh, I don't=20

know; you say McVickar has hired you to do a lawyer's work, and I reckon th=
at is what he will=20

expect you to do, isn't it?"  Blount laid the second cigar aside and crosse=
d the room to readjust a=20

half-opened ventilating transom. Mr. McVickar had not defined the duties of=
 the new counselship=20

very clearly, but there had been a strong inference running through the pri=
vate-car conference to=20

the effect that the headship of the local legal department would carry with=
 it some political=20

responsibilities. At the moment the newly appointed placeman had been rathe=
r glad that such was=20

the case. The vice-president had convinced him of the justice of the railro=
ad company's=20

contention--namely, that the present laws of the State, if rigidly administ=
ered, amounted to a=20

practical confiscation of the company's property. While Mr. McVickar was ta=
lking, Blount had=20

hoped that the new office which the vice-president was apparently creating =
for him would give him=20

a free hand to place the company's point of view fairly before the people o=
f the State, and to do=20

this he knew he would have to enter the campaign in some sort as a politica=
l worker. Surely, his=20

father must know this; and he went boldly upon the assumption that his fath=
er did know it.  "As I=20

have said, I am to be chief of the legal department on this division, and a=
s such it will be=20

necessary for me to defend my client both in court and out of court," he sa=
id finally. "Since I am=20

fairly committed, I shall try to stay on the job."  "Of course you will. Yo=
u've got to be honest with=20

yourself--and with McVickar. I don't mind telling you, son, that I'm flat-f=
ooted on the other side this=20

time, and I had hoped you were going to be. But if you're not, why, that's =
the end of it. We won't=20

quarrel about it."  Now this was not at all the paternal attitude as the yo=
ung man had been=20

prefiguring it. He had looked for opposition; finding it, he would have fou=
nd it possible to say some=20

of the things which were crying to be said and which still remained unsaid.=
 But there was=20

absolutely no loophole through which he could force the attack. If his late=
 decision had been of no=20

more importance than the breaking of a dinner engagement, his father could =
scarcely have=20

dismissed it with less apparent concern. Balked and practically talked to a=
 standstill in the=20

business matter, Blount switched to other things.  "I missed you to-night a=
t dinner," he said,=20

beginning on the new tack. "Two of my Cambridge friends are here, and I wan=
ted you to meet=20

them."  The Honorable David looked up quickly.  "The fossil-digging profess=
or and his daughter?"=20

he queried shrewdly.  "Yes; how did you know? They came in on the Overland,=
 and I find that the=20

professor has made the long journey on the strength of what I once told him=
 about the=20

megatheriums and things. I guess it's up to me to make good in some way."  =
"Don't you worry a=20

minute about that, Evan, boy," was the instant rejoinder. "Honoria's coming=
 in from Wartrace to-

morrow, and if you'll put us next, we'll take care of your friends--mighty =
good care of 'em." Then,=20

almost wistfully Blount thought: "You won't mind letting Honoria do that mu=
ch for you, will you,=20

son?"  "I'd be a cad if I did. And you've taken a load off of my shoulders,=
 I can assure you. If you=20

can persuade Mrs. Blount into it, I'll arrange for a little dinner of five =
to-morrow evening in the=20

_cafe_ where we can all get together. You'll like the professor, I know; an=
d I hope you're going to=20

like Patricia. She's New England, and at first you may think she's a bit ch=
illy. But really she isn't=20

anything of the kind."  The Honorable Senator got up and strolled to the wi=
ndow.  "You'd better go=20

to bed, son," he advised. "It's getting to be mighty late, and you'll want =
to be surging around some=20



with these friends of yours to-morrow. And, before I forget it, the big car=
 is in Heffelfinger's garage.=20

Order it out after breakfast and show the Cambridge folks a good time."  It=
 was late the following=20

evening, several hours after the informal little dinner for five in the Int=
er-Mountain _cafe_, when the=20

senator had himself lifted from the lobby to the private-suite floor and ma=
de his way to the door of=20

his own apartments. As was her custom when they were together, his wife was=
 waiting up for him.=20

"Did you find out anything more?" she asked, without looking up from the ti=
ny embroidery frame=20

which was her leisure-filling companion at home or elsewhere.  "Not enough =
to hurt anything.=20

McVickar has fixed things to suit himself. The boy's law-office job is to b=
e pretty largely nominal; a=20

sort of go-as-you-please and do-as-you-like proposition on the side, with A=
ckerton to do all the=20

sure-enough court work and legal drudgery. Since Ackerton is a pretty clean=
 fellow, and Evan=20

stands up so straight that he leans over backward, this lay-out means that =
the bribing isn't going to=20

be done by the legal department in the coming campaign."  "Is that all?"  "=
All but one little thing.=20

Evan's job is to be more or less associated with the traffic department, an=
d the word has been=20

passed to Gantry and his crowd to see to it that the boy doesn't get to kno=
w too much."  "But they=20

can't keep him from finding out about the underground work!" protested the =
small one.  "If it's an=20

order from headquarters, they're going to try mighty hard. Evan wants to be=
lieve that everything is=20

on the high moral plane, and when a man wants to believe a thing it isn't s=
o awfully hard to fool=20

him. It'll be a winning card for them if they can send the boy out to talk =
convincingly about the=20

cleanness of the company's campaign. That sort of talk, handed out as Evan =
can hand it, if he is=20

convinced of the truth of what he is saying, will capture the honest voter =
every time. I tell you, little=20

woman, there's a thing we politicians are constantly losing sight of: that =
down at the bedrock=20

bottom the American voter--'the man in the street,' as the newspapers call =
him--is a fair man and=20

an honest man. Speaking broadly, you couldn't buy him with a clear title to=
 a quarter-section in=20

Paradise."  This little eulogy upon the American voter appeared to be waste=
d upon the small=20

person in the wicker rocking-chair. "We must get him back," she remarked, r=
eferring, not to the=20

American voter, but to the senator's son. "Have you thought of any plan?"  =
"No."  She smiled up at=20

him sweetly. "You are like the good doctor who cannot prescribe for the mem=
bers of his own=20

family. If he were anybody else's son, you would know exactly what to do." =
 "Perhaps I should."  "I=20

have a plan," she went on quietly, bending again over her embroidery. "He m=
ay have to take a=20

regular course of treatment, and it may make him very ill; would you mind t=
hat?"  David Blount=20

leaned back in his chair and regarded her through half-closed eyelids. "You=
're a wonder, little=20

woman," he said; and then: "I don't want to see the boy suffer any more tha=
n he has to."  "Neither=20

do I," was the swift agreement. Then, with no apparent relevance: "What do =
you think of Miss=20

Anners?"  The senator sat up at the question, with the slow smile wrinkling=
 humorously at the=20

corners of his eyes.  "I haven't thought much about her yet. She's the kind=
 that won't let you get=20

near enough in a single sitting to think much about her, isn't she?"  "She =
is a young woman with=20

an exceedingly bright mind and a very high purpose," was the little lady's =
summing-up of Patricia.=20

"But she isn't altogether a Boston iceberg. She thinks she is irrevocably i=
n love with her chosen=20

career; but, really, I believe she is very much in love with Evan. If we co=
uld manage to win her=20

over to our side as an active ally--"  This time the senator's smile broade=
ned into a laugh.  "You=20

are away yonder out of my depth now," he chuckled. "Does your course of tre=
atment for the boy=20

include large doses of the young woman, administered frequently?"  "Oh, no,=
" was the instant=20



reply. "I was only wondering if it wouldn't be well to enroll her--enlist h=
er sympathies, you know."=20

"Why not?--if you think best? You're the fine-haired little wire-puller, an=
d it's all in your hands."=20

"Will you give me _carte-blanche_ to do as I please?" asked the small plott=
er.  "Sure!" said the=20

Honorable David heartily, adding: "You can always outfigure me, two to one,=
 when it comes to the=20

real thing. You've made a fine art of it, Honoria, and I'll turn the steeri=
ng-wheel over to you any day=20

in the week."  When she looked up she was smiling in the way which had made=
 Evan Blount=20

wonder, in that midnight meeting at Wartrace Hall, how she could look so yo=
ung and yet be so=20

wise.  "You deal with people in the mass, David, and no one living can do i=
t better. I am like most=20

women, I think: I deal with the individual. That is all the difference. Whe=
n do the Annerses go out=20

to the fossil-beds?"  "I don't know; any time when you will invite them to =
make Wartrace their=20

headquarters, I reckon."  "Then I think it will be to-morrow," decided the =
confident mistress of=20

policies. "It won't do to let Evan see too much of Patricia until after his=
 course of treatment is well=20

under way. Shall we make it to-morrow? And will you telephone Dawkins to br=
ing down the biggest=20

car? I have a notion wandering around in my head somewhere that Miss Patric=
ia Anners will stand=20

a little judicious impressing. She is exceedingly democratic, you know--in =
theory."     IX  THE=20

RANK AND FILE   Considerably to his surprise, and no less to his satisfacti=
on, the newly=20

appointed "division counsel," as his title ran, was not required to take ov=
er the old legal=20

department offices in the second story of the station building, where all t=
he other offices of the=20

company were located. Instead, he was directed to fit up a suite of rooms i=
n Temple Court, the=20

capital's most pretentious up-town sky-scraper, and there was something mor=
e than a hint that the=20

item of first cost would not be too closely scrutinized.  It was the vice-p=
resident himself, writing=20

from Chicago, who authorized the new departure and loosened the purse strin=
gs. "Don't be afraid=20

of spending a little money," wrote the great man. "Make your up-town headqu=
arters as attractive=20

as may be, and arrange matters with Ackerton so that your office will not b=
e burdened with too=20

much of the routine legal work. A successful legal representative will be a=
 good mixer--as I am=20

sure you are--and will extend the circle of his acquaintance as rapidly and=
 as far as possible. Your=20

appointment will be fully justified when you have made your up-town office =
a place where the good=20

citizens of the capital and the State can drop in for a cordial word with t=
he company's spokesman."=20

Acting upon this suggestion, Blount opened the Temple Court headquarters at=
 once and threw=20

himself energetically into the indicated field. Ackerton, a technical exper=
t with a needle-like mind=20

and the State code at his fingers'-ends, was left in charge of the working =
offices in the railroad=20

building, with instructions to apply to his chief only when he needed speci=
fic advice.  At the up-

town headquarters, Blount gave himself wholly to the pleasant task of makin=
g friends. With a good=20

store of introductions upon which to make a beginning, and with the open-ha=
nded, whole-souled=20

_camaraderie_ of the West to help, the list of acquaintances grew with amaz=
ing rapidity. For the=20

three or four weeks after Mrs. Blount had whisked the Annerses away to Wart=
race Hall and the=20

habitat of the Megalosauridae, the newly appointed "social secretary" for t=
he railroad, as Honoria=20

had dubbed him, met all comers joyously and accepted all invitations, never=
 inquiring whether they=20

were extended to his father's son, to the railroad company's legal chief, o=
r to Evan Blount in his=20

proper person.  During this social interval he saw little of his father, th=
ough he was still occupying=20

his share of the private dining-room suite at the Inter-Mountain. Part of t=
he time, as he knew, the=20

Honorable Senator was at Wartrace Hall, looking after his mammoth ranch, an=
d helping to=20



entertain the visitors from Massachusetts. But now and again the father cam=
e and went; and=20

occasionally there was a dinner _a deux_ in the hotel _cafe_, with a little=
 good-natured raillery=20

from the senator's side of the table.  "Got you chasing your feet right liv=
ely in the social merry-go-

round these days, haven't they, son? Like it, as far as you've gone?" said =
the ex-cattle-king one=20

evening when Evan had come down in evening clothes, ready to go to madam th=
e governor's=20

wife's strictly formal "informal" a little later on.  "It's all in the day'=
s work," laughed the younger=20

man. "I shall need all the 'pull' I can get a little later on, sha'n't I?" =
 "I shouldn't wonder if you did,=20

son; I shouldn't wonder if you did. And I reckon you're doing pretty good w=
ork, too, mixing and=20

mingling the way you do. Was it McVickar's idea, or your own--this sudden s=
plash into the social=20

water-hole?"  "I don't mind telling you that it is a part of the new policy=
," returned the social=20

splasher, still smiling. "We are out to make friends this time; good, solid=
, open-eyed friends who=20

will know just what we are doing and why we are doing it."  "H'm," mused th=
e senator, "so=20

publicity's the new word, is it?"  "Yes; publicity is the word. The Gordon =
people say they are going=20

to show us up; there won't be anything to show up when the time comes. We a=
re going to beat=20

them to the billboards."  The grizzled veteran of a goodly number of politi=
cal battles put down his=20

coffee-cup; he was still old-fashioned enough to drink his coffee in genero=
us measure with the=20

meat courses.  "You can't do the circus act--ride two horses at once and do=
 the same stunt on=20

both, son," he remarked gravely. "If you're really going to put the saddle =
and bridle on the publicity=20

nag, you've got to turn the other one out of the corral and let it go back =
to the short-grass."  "It is=20

already turned out," asserted the young man, not affecting to misunderstand=
. "We neither buy=20

votes nor spend illegitimate money in this campaign."  The stout assertion =
was good as far as it=20

went; the new division counsel made it and believed it. But on his way to t=
he governor's mansion,=20

a little later, he could not help wondering if he had been altogether candi=
d in making it. The offices=20

in the up-town sky-scraper were not exclusively a railroad social centre wh=
ere the disinterested=20

voter could come and have the facts ladled out to him without fear or favor=
 on the part of the=20

ladler. They had come to be also a rallying-point for a heterogeneous crowd=
 of ward-workers, wire-

pullers, and small politicians, most of whom were anxious to be employed or=
 retained as=20

henchmen. Some of these "stretcher men," as Blount contemptuously called th=
em, had been=20

employed in past campaigns; others were still the beneficiaries of the rail=
road, holding pay-roll=20

places which Blount acutely suspected were chiefly sinecures.  Latterly, th=
is contingent of strikers=20

and heelers had been greatly augmented, and it was beginning to make its de=
mands more=20

emphatic. A dozen times a day Blount had the worn phrase, "nothing for noth=
ing," dinned into his=20

ears, and he was beginning to harbor a suspicion that his office had been m=
ade a dumping-ground=20

for all the other departments.  Seeing Gantry at madam the governor's lady'=
s reception, Blount=20

took an early opportunity of cornering the traffic manager in one of the ot=
herwise deserted=20

smoking-dens, and when he had made sure there were no eavesdroppers plunged=
 at once into=20

the middle of things.  "See here, Dick," he began, "you fellows downtown ar=
e making my office a=20

cesspool, and I won't stand for it. Garrigan, that saloon-keeper in the sec=
ond ward, came up to-

day to ask for a free ticket to Worthington and return; and when I pinned h=
im down he admitted=20

that you'd sent him to me."  "I did," said Gantry, grinning. "Why otherwise=
 have we got a post-

graduate, double-certificated political manager, I'd like to know?"  Blount=
 dropped into a chair and=20

felt in his pockets for his cigar-case.  "I guess we may as well fight this=
 thing to a finish right here=20



and now, Dick," he said coolly. "I'm not chief vote buyer for the Transcont=
inental Company--I'm not=20

any kind of a vote buyer."  "Who said you were?" retorted the traffic manag=
er.  "It says itself, if I=20

am supposed to cut the pie and hand out pieces of it to these grub-stakers =
that you and Carson=20

and Bentley and Kittredge are continually sending to me."  This time Gantry=
's grin was playful, but=20

behind it there was a shrewd flash of the Irish-blue eyes that Blount did n=
ot see.  "I guess the=20

company would be plenty willing to furnish a few small pies for really hung=
ry people, if you think=20

you need them to go along with your Temple Court office fittings," he retur=
ned.  "Ah?" said Blount=20

calmly, giving the exclamation the true Boston inflection. "You are either =
too shrewd or not quite=20

shrewd enough, Dick. You covered that up with a laugh, so that I might take=
 it as a joke if I=20

happened to be too thin-skinned to take it in disreputable earnest. Let us =
understand each other;=20

we are fighting squarely in the open in this campaign; publicity is the wor=
d--I have Mr. McVickar for=20

my authority. Anybody who wants to know anything about the railroad company=
's business in this=20

State can learn it for the asking, and at first-hand. Secrecy and all the v=
arious brands of political=20

claptrap that have been admitted in the past are to be shown the door. This=
 is the intimation that=20

was made to me: wasn't it made to you?"  Gantry did not reply directly to t=
he direct demand. On=20

the other hand, he very carefully refrained from answering it in any degree=
 whatsoever.  "You have=20

your job to hold down and I have mine," he rejoined. "What you say goes as =
it lies, of course; but=20

just the same, I shouldn't be too righteously hard on the little brothers, =
if I were you."  "If by the=20

'little brothers' you mean the pie-eaters, I'm going to fire them out, neck=
 and crop, Richard. They=20

make me excessively weary."  Gantry's playful mood fell away from him like =
a cast-off garment.  "I=20

don't quite believe I'd do that, if I were you, Evan. There are pie-eaters =
on both sides in every=20

political contest, and while they can't do any cause any great amount of go=
od, they can often do a=20

good bit of harm. I wouldn't be too hard on them, if I were you."  "What wo=
uld you do?--or, rather,=20

what did you do when you were managing the State campaign two years ago?" i=
nquired Blount=20

pointedly.  "I cut the pie," said the traffic manager simply.  "In other wo=
rds, you let this riffraff=20

blackmail you and, incidentally, put a big black mark against the company's=
 good name."  "Oh, no;=20

I wouldn't put it quite that strong. Not many of these little fellows ask f=
or money, or expect it. A free=20

ride now and then in the varnished cars is about all they look for."  "But =
you can't give them=20

passes under the interstate law," protested the purist.  "Not outside of th=
e State, of course. But=20

inside of the State boundaries it's our own business."  "You mean it _was_ =
our own business,=20

previous to the passage of the State rate law two years ago," corrected Blo=
unt.  "It is our own=20

business to this good day--in effect. That part of the law has been a compl=
ete dead-letter from the=20

day the governor signed it. Why, bless your innocent heart, Evan, the very =
men who argued the=20

loudest and voted the most spitefully for it came to me for their return ti=
ckets home at the end of=20

the session. Of course, we kept the letter of the law. It says that no 'fre=
e passes' shall be given.=20

We didn't issue passes; we merely gave them tickets out of the case and cha=
rged them up to=20

'expense.'"  "Faugh!" said Blount, "you make me sick! Gantry, it's that sam=
e childish whipping of=20

the devil around the stump by the corporations--an expedient that wouldn't =
deceive the most=20

ignorant voter that ever cast a ballot--it's that very thing that has stirr=
ed the whole nation up to this=20

unreasonable fight against corporate capital. Don't you see it?"  Gantry sh=
rugged his shoulders.  "I=20

guess I take the line of the least resistance--like the majority of them," =
was the colorless reply.=20

"When it comes down to practical politics--"  "Don't say 'practical politic=
s' to me, Dick!" rasped the=20



reformer. "We've got the strongest argument in the world in the fact that t=
he present law is an=20

unfair one, needing modification or repeal. We mustn't spoil that argument =
by becoming law-

breakers ourselves and descending to the methods of the grafters and the ma=
chine politicians the=20

country over. If you have been sending these pie-eaters to me, stop it--don=
't do it any more. I have=20

no earthly use for them; and they won't have any use for me after I open up=
 on them and tell them=20

a few things they don't seem to know, or to care to know."  "I don't believ=
e I'd do anything brash,"=20

Gantry suggested mildly, and he was still saying the same thing in diversif=
ied forms when Blount=20

led the way back to the crowded drawing-rooms.  Dating from this little hea=
rt-to-heart talk with the=20

traffic manager, Blount began to carry out the new policy--the starvation p=
olicy, as it soon came to=20

be known among the would-be henchmen. The result was not altogether reassur=
ing. The first few=20

rebuffs he administered left him with the feeling that he was winning Pyrrh=
ic victories; it was as if=20

he were trying to handle a complicated mechanism with the working details o=
f which he was only=20

theoretically familiar. There were wheels within wheels, and the applicatio=
n of the brakes to the=20

smallest of them led to discordant janglings throughout the whole.  Many of=
 the small grafters were=20

on the pay-rolls of the railroad company, and Blount was soon definitely as=
sured of what he had=20

before only suspected--that they were merely nominal employees given a pay-=
roll standing so that=20

there might be an excuse for giving them free transportation, and a retaine=
r in the form of wages, if=20

needful.  In many cases the ramifications of the petty graft were exasperat=
ingly intricate. For=20

example: one Thomas Gryson, who was on the pay-rolls as a machinist's helpe=
r in the repair=20

shops, demanded free transportation across the State for eight members of h=
is "family."=20

Questioned closely, he admitted that the "family" was his only by a figure =
of speech; that the=20

relationship was entirely political. Blount promptly refused to recommend t=
he issuing of employees'=20

passes for the eight, and the result was an immediate call from Bentley, th=
e division master=20

mechanic.  "About that fellow Gryson," Bentley began; "can't you manage som=
e way to get him=20

transportation for his Jonesboro crowd? He is going to make trouble for us =
if you don't."  Blount=20

was justly indignant. "Gryson is on your pay-roll," he retorted. "Why don't=
 you recommend the=20

passes yourself, on account of the motive-power department, if he is entitl=
ed to them?"  "I can't,"=20

admitted the master mechanic. "I am held down to the issuing of passes to e=
mployees travelling=20

on company business only. We can stretch it a little sometimes, of course, =
but we can't make it=20

cover the whole earth."  "Neither can I!" Blount exploded. "Let it be under=
stood, once for all, Mr.=20

Bentley, that I am not the scape-goat for all the other departments! I have=
 cut it off short; I am not=20

recommending passes for anybody."  "But, suffering Scott, Mr. Blount, we've=
 simply _got_ to take=20

care of Tom Gryson! He's the boss of his ward, and he has influence enough =
to turn even our own=20

employees against us!"  "Influence?" scoffed the young man from the East. "=
How does he acquire=20

his influence? It is merely another illustration of the vicious circle; you=
 put into his hands the club=20

with which he proceeds to knock you down. Let me tell you what I'm telling =
everybody; if we want=20

a square deal, we've got to set the example by being square. And, by Heaven=
s, Mr. Bentley, we're=20

going to set the example!"  The master mechanic went away silenced, but by =
no means=20

convinced; and a week later Gryson, who in appearance was a typical tough, =
and who in reality=20

was a post-graduate of the hard school of violence and ruffianage obtaining=
 in the lawless mining-

camps of the Carnadine Hills, sauntered into Blount's office with his cigar=
 at the belligerent angle=20

and an insolent taunt in his mouth.  "Well, pardner, we got them dickie-bir=
ds o' mine over to=20



Jonesboro, after so long a time, and no thanks to you, neither. I just blew=
 in to tell you that I'm=20

goin' to hit you ag'in about day after to-morrow, and if you don't come acr=
oss there's goin' to be=20

somethin' doin'; see?"  Blount sprang from his chair and forgot to be polit=
ic.  "You needn't come to=20

me the day after to-morrow, or any other time," he raged. "I'm through with=
 you and your tribe. Get=20

out!"  After Gryson, muttering threats, had gone, the young campaign manage=
r had an attack of=20

moral nausea. It seemed such a prodigious waste of time and energy to traff=
ic and chaffer with=20

these petty scoundrels. Thus far, every phase of the actual political probl=
em seemed to be meanly=20

degrading, and he was beginning to long keenly for an opportunity to do som=
e really worthy thing.=20

Notwithstanding, his ideals were still unshaken. He still clung to the beli=
ef that the corporation,=20

which was created by the law and could exist only under the protection of t=
he law, must, of=20

necessity, be a law-abiding entity. It was manifestly unfair to hold it res=
ponsible for the=20

disreputable political methods of those whom it could never completely cont=
rol--methods, too,=20

which had been forced upon it by the necessity, or the fancied necessity, o=
f meeting conditions as=20

they were found.  As if in answer to the wish that he might find the worthi=
er task, it was on this day=20

of Gryson's visit that Blount was given his first opportunity of entering t=
he wider field. A letter from=20

a local party chairman in a distant mining town brought an invitation of th=
e kind for which he had=20

been waiting and hoping. He was asked to participate in a joint debate at t=
he campaign opening in=20

the town in question, and he was so glad of the chance that he instantly wi=
red his acceptance.=20

That evening, at the Inter-Mountain _cafe_ dinner hour, he found his father=
 dining alone and joined=20

him. In a burst of confidence he told of the invitation.  "That's good; tha=
t's the real thing this time,=20

isn't it?" was the senator's even-toned comment. "Gives you a right nice li=
ttle chance to shine the=20

way you can shine best." Then: "That was one of the things McVickar wanted =
you for, wasn't it?--

speech-making and the like?"  "Why, yes; he intimated that there might be s=
ome public speaking,"=20

admitted the younger man.  "Well, what-all are you going to tell these Ophi=
r fellows when you get=20

over there, son?" asked the veteran quizzically. "Going to offer 'em all fr=
ee passes anywhere they=20

want to go if they'll promise to vote for the railroad candidates?"  "Not t=
his year," was the laughing=20

reply. "As I told you a while back, we've stopped all that."  "You have, eh=
? I reckon that will be=20

mighty sorry news for a good many people in the old Sage-brush State--might=
y sorry news. You=20

really reckon you _have_ stopped it, do you, son?"  "I not only believe it;=
 I am in a position to=20

assert it definitely."  "McVickar has told you it was stopped?"  The newly =
fledged political manager=20

tried to be strictly truthful.  "I have had but the one interview with Mr. =
McVickar, but in that talk he=20

gave me to understand that my recommendations would be given due considerat=
ion. And I have=20

said my say pretty emphatically."  The senator's smile was not derisive; it=
 was merely lenient.  "Sat=20

on 'em good and hard, did you? That's right, son; don't you ever be afraid =
to say what you mean,=20

and to say it straight from the shoulder. That's the Blount way, and I reck=
on we've got to keep the=20

family ball rolling--you and I. Don't forget that, when you're making your =
appeal to those horny-

handed sons of toil over yonder at Ophir. Give 'em straight facts, and back=
 up the facts with=20

figures--if you happen to have the figures. When do you pull out for the mi=
ning-camp?"  "To-night,=20

at nine-thirty. I can't get there in time if I wait for the morning train."=
 Then, dismissing the political=20

topic abruptly: "What do you hear from Professor Anners?"  "Oh, he's having=
 the time of his life. I=20

got him a State permit, and scraped him up a bunch of pick-and-shovel men, =
and he is digging out=20

those fossil skeletons by the wagon-load."  "And Miss Anners?" pursued Patr=
icia's lover.  "I=20



shouldn't wonder if she was having the time of her life, too. I've given he=
r the little four-seated car=20

to call her own while she is out here, and she and Honoria go careering aro=
und the country--

breaking the speed limit every minute in the day, I reckon."  "I'm glad you=
 are giving her a good=20

time," said Evan, and he looked glad. Then he added regretfully: "I wish I =
could get a chance to=20

chase around a little with them. I have seen almost nothing of them since t=
hey came West. I=20

should think Mrs. Blount might bring Patricia down to the city once in a wh=
ile."  "Well, now!=20

perhaps the young woman doesn't want to come," laughed the senator. "You to=
ld me you hadn't=20

got her tag, son, and I'm beginning to believe it's the sure-enough truth. =
What has she got against=20

you, anyway?"  "Nothing; nothing in the wide world, save that I don't fit i=
nto her scheme for her life-

work."  The senator was eating calmly through his dessert. "If you hadn't m=
ade up your mind so=20

pointedly to dislike Honoria, you might be getting a few tips on that 'care=
er' business along about=20

now, son," he remarked, and Evan was silent--had to be silent. For, you see=
, he had been=20

charging Patricia's continued absence from the capital to nothing less than=
 spiteful design on the=20

part of his father's wife.  It was at the cigar smoking in the lobby, after=
 the young man had made=20

his preparations for the journey and was waiting for the train-caller's ann=
ouncement, that the=20

senator said quite casually: "It's too bad you're going out of town to-nigh=
t, son. Honoria 'phoned=20

me a little spell ago that she and Patricia would be driving down after the=
ir dinner to take in the=20

Weatherford reception. You'll have to miss 'em, won't you?"  The announcer =
was chanting the call=20

for the night train west, and the joint-debater got up and thrust his hand-=
bag savagely into the=20

hand of the nearest porter.  "Isn't that just my infernal luck!" he lamente=
d. Then: "Give them my=20

love, and tell them I hope they will stay until I get back."  The senator r=
ose and shook hands with=20

the departing debater. "Shall I say that to both of 'em?" he asked, with th=
e quizzical smile which=20

Evan was learning to expect.  "Yes; to both of them, if you like--only I su=
ppose Mrs. Blount will=20

hold it against me. Good-night and good-by. I'll be back day after to-morro=
w, if the Ophir miners=20

don't mob me."  It was only a few minutes after Evan Blount's train had ste=
amed Ophir-ward out of=20

the Sierra Avenue station that a dust-covered touring-car drew up at the cu=
rb in front of the Inter-

Mountain, and the same porter who had put Blount's hand-bag into the taxica=
b opened the=20

tonneau door for two ladies in muffling motor-coats and heavy veils.  The s=
enator met the two late=20

travellers in the vestibule, and while the three were waiting for an elevat=
or a rapid fire of low-toned=20

question and answer passed between husband and wife.  "You got Evan out of =
the way?"=20

whispered the wife.  The husband nodded. "That was easy. I passed the word =
to Steuchfield, and=20

he helped out on that--invited Evan to come to Ophir to speak in a joint de=
bate. He left on the night=20

train."  "And Hathaway? Will he be here?"  "He is here. Gantry has turned h=
im down, according to=20

instructions, and he is clawing about in the air, trying to get a fresh hol=
d. I bluffed him; told him=20

he'd have to make his peace with you for something, I didn't know what, bef=
ore I could talk to him."=20

Miss Anners was watching the elevator signal glow as the car descended, and=
 the wife's voice=20

sank to a still lower whisper.  "He will be at the Weatherfords'?" she inqu=
ired eagerly.  "He is right=20

sure to be; I told him you would be there."  The small plotter nodded appro=
val.  "Give us half an=20

hour to dress, and have the car ready," she directed; and then the senator =
put the two into the=20

elevator and turned away to finish his cigar.     X  IN THE HERBARIUM   The=
 again. The=20

Guardian-Mother did not come into the bay, and I was afraid you had all gon=
e to the bottom in the=20

gale."  "Don't you call me 'grandma' again, Felix," protested the worthy wo=
man quite warmly; for=20



the Milesian had twice applied the opprobrious appellation to her. "If you =
ever do it again, I will=20

never hug you another time!"  "Then I will call you so till my dying day!" =
Felix declared, to the great=20

amusement of all those within hearing.  "I am not your grandma! I am only t=
hirty-six years old, and=20

I am not far enough into years to be the grandmother of a great strapping b=
oy like you."  "It is only=20

a pet name. But you didn't go to the bottom of the sea after all, grandma."=
  "There it is again!"  "Of=20

course it is, grandma. But I will make a fair trade with you. If you will p=
romise never to hug me any=20

more, I will agree never to call you grandma again."  "That is fair," said =
Mrs. Belgrave.  They=20

retired to the boudoir to talk over the matter; but the agreement was ratif=
ied between them. The=20

"Big Four" were cordially greeted by all the passengers and by all the offi=
cers of the ship; but they=20

were careful not to drop any hint of what had transpired in Khrysoko Bay. B=
efore the exchange of=20

salutations was finished the gong rang for dinner.  "For a reason to be giv=
en later on, Captain=20

Ringgold, I must ask you to give the engineers and cook of the Maud their s=
upper to-night," said=20

Captain Scott at a favorable moment.  The commander sent for Baldy Bickling=
, the second cook,=20

and ordered him to provide for them; and Mr. Boulong to send an engineer an=
d a couple of hands=20

on board of the Maud while the party came on board to supper. The company i=
n the cabin were in=20

a very jovial state of feeling, and it would take a chapter to record all t=
he jokes of Dr. Hawkes and=20

Uncle Moses. It was an excellent dinner even for the Guardian-Mother; for b=
oth the chief steward=20

and the chief cook were artists in their line, and it was heartily enjoyed =
by all at the table.  The=20

commander was impatient to hear the report of Captain Scott on his expediti=
on, and the=20

commander of the Maud was almost as impatient to learn what had delayed the=
 ship; but fully an=20

hour was spent at the table, for no one wished to break in upon the agreeab=
le occasion. How he=20

knew it he could not have told in detail; but the commander was satisfied, =
that something=20

important had occurred in the experience of the young navigators, though no=
t a word had yet been=20

spoken, and he had failed to notice the ragged hole through the Maud's deck=
-house at the location=20

of the galley.  He had expected to find the Fatime near the little steamer;=
 but though he had swept=20

the bay with his spy-glass, he could not find her, for she was no longer vi=
sible. Probably she had=20

fallen over on the rocky and irregular bottom, and that had carried even he=
r short masts under=20

water. As soon as the party rose from the table, Louis and Morris detached =
themselves from their=20

mothers, and hastened to the commander's room, where they found Captain Sco=
tt and Felix.  "I=20

don't see anything of the Fatime in this bay," said Captain Ringgold, when =
he had closed and=20

locked his doors.  "But she is there, sir," replied Scott mysteriously to t=
he commander.  "Where? I=20

looked the bay over with my glass, and I think if she were here I should ha=
ve seen her," added=20

Captain Ringgold.  "You could not see her where she is, Captain," replied S=
cott.  "Where is she,=20

then?" demanded the commander.  "On the bottom, Captain Ringgold," said Cap=
tain Scott=20

impressively.     CHAPTER XVI  THE REPORT OF THE BATTLE OF KHRYSOKO   Capta=
in=20

Ringgold looked from one to another of the "Big Four," and a smile passed o=
ver his dignified face.=20

It was evident to him from the expression of all of them that something of =
importance had occurred=20

in Khrysoko Bay, and that Captain Scott, who was, by his position, the spok=
esman of the party,=20

proposed to tell his story in his own way, to which he did not object.  He =
believed the young men=20

were honest, truthful, and straightforward, and he had no suspicions of any=
 kind. As the bearer of=20

heavy and disagreeable intelligence is inclined to approach his topic by de=
grees, the young=20

captain did not like to tell the worst of his report in the beginning.  The=
 commander was not=20



disposed to have the news "broken" to him, and considered himself able to b=
ear the whole of it in=20

a mass without being overwhelmed. But he had no idea of the seriousness of =
the event which had=20

occurred, and he thought it probable that the boys were making a great deal=
 more of it than the=20

occasion required. They had all been to the table at dinner, and were as li=
vely and as full of fun as=20

usual. As none of them had been killed or injured, nothing very terrible co=
uld have happened.=20

"When did you reach this bay, Captain Scott?" he asked, after he had measur=
ed the visages of his=20

audience.  "About eight o'clock this morning, sir," replied Scott.  "You ha=
d a smart gale about all=20

last night," the commander proceeded.  "Yes, sir; but we made very good wea=
ther of it, and it=20

lasted about twelve hours."  "You had no accident?"  "None of any kind, sir=
; everything went on as=20

usual."  "I suppose you expected the ship sooner than she came?"  "I looked=
 for her this morning."=20

"In carrying out the plan which you suggested, Captain Scott, I found that =
the Fatime was not=20

disposed to follow you as long as the Guardian-Mother was in sight," contin=
ued the commander,=20

while the "Big Four" looked at each other, wondering that Captain Ringgold =
had turned aside from=20

the subject which was a burning one to them. "In order to help Captain Maza=
gan in his=20

movements, I picked up a pilot off Ras Bourlos, and stood in behind a neck =
of land. We took the=20

ground there, and stuck hard in the soft mud, though the chart gave water e=
nough to float the=20

ship."  "That was unfortunate," added Scott.  "A government tug hauled us o=
ff on the next tide, and=20

I followed you at the best speed of the ship. I went in at Limasol, though =
I did not believe you=20

would make that port in a southerly gale, and the lookout reported the Maud=
 in this bay. That is the=20

reason of my delay in joining you as arranged," said the commander, finishi=
ng his narrative. "But I=20

expected to find the Fatime here also; for she was pressing on after you th=
e last we saw of her."=20

"We lost sight of her early last night," added Scott. "Her lights disappear=
ed, and we could form no=20

idea as to what had become of her. I think now that we outsailed her; for w=
e carried a reefed=20

foresail before the gale, and it must have helped a good deal."  "She came =
into this bay this=20

morning," added Louis, who thought the conference was moving on very slowly=
.  "I see that you=20

wish me to drag out of you the particulars of your stay here, Captain Scott=
," said the commander=20

with a smile. "As I have not the least idea what you have been about here, =
I find some difficulty in=20

framing my questions. You know that a lawyer, when he examines a witness in=
 court, is in=20

possession of all the facts, as I am not on the present occasion. I have le=
arned that the Fatime=20

came to this bay, and that she is at the bottom now. Perhaps you will be wi=
lling to inform me,=20

Captain, by this time, how the Pacha's steamer happens to be at the bottom.=
"  "We had a fight=20

here, and I ran the Maud into her, stove a big hole in her side, and she we=
nt to the bottom!" almost=20

shouted Scott, who had been not a little perplexed at the manner of proceed=
ing of the commander.=20

"I believe that is telling the whole story in a heap, sir."  Captain Ringgo=
ld sprang out of his chair,=20

evidently startled by the intelligence; and he had never been known to make=
 so much of a=20

demonstration before since he had been in command of the ship. He stood loo=
king into the face of=20

Captain Scott as though he were incredulous in regard to the announcement j=
ust made to him;=20

and that a little steam-yacht only forty feet in length had run into and su=
nk a vessel of four hundred=20

tons was calculated to stagger a man of his experience in nautical affairs.=
  "Do you mean literally,=20

Captain Scott, that you ran into and sank the Fatime?" demanded the command=
er.  "Literally and=20

exactly, sir, that was what was done," replied the young captain very decid=
edly.  "It looks=20

incredible," added the commander, as he resumed his seat.  "It is the exact=
 truth, Captain=20



Ringgold," said Louis.  "I vouch for the truth of the statement, Captain, i=
f my word is good for=20

anything," Felix followed.  "I give my testimony in the same direction," Mo=
rris put in.  "Of course I=20

do not doubt the truth of your statement," replied the commander. "But it l=
ooks like an amazing fact=20

that the little Maud was able to do so much mischief to a steamer of the si=
ze of the Fatime.=20

However, she is about as big as some of the little tug-boats in New York Ha=
rbor that drag ships of=20

five hundred tons after them. In spite of all that has been said in the las=
t six months about the=20

extraordinary strength of the Maud, I should have supposed the blow, if you=
 went at the steamer at=20

full speed, would have crushed in her bow."  "It did not start a bolt or be=
nd a plate," replied Scott.=20

"But, according to the evidence of Don, who knew something about the Pacha'=
s yacht, she was=20

old and nearly worn out when His Highness bought her."  "That may explain i=
t."  "Before we=20

proceed any farther, I ought to report that Captain Mazagan is now in the c=
abin of the Maud,=20

wounded by a rifle ball in the shoulder, and in need of the services of the=
 doctor," said Captain=20

Scott.  "Wounded with a rifle ball," repeated the commander. "Then there is=
 a good deal more of=20

this affair which has not yet come out. But if the villain is suffering, it=
 is proper that he should be=20

attended to at once."  "Pitts has had charge of him."  Pinch, the mess stew=
ard, was sent for, and=20

ordered to make the hospital ready for a patient. Mr. Boulong was called in=
, and directed to=20

superintend the removal of the wounded Moor to this apartment, under the di=
rection of the=20

surgeon. Dr. Hawkes was called from the boudoir, where the company had asse=
mbled by this=20

time, and conducted to the patient.  "With this affair all concealment come=
s to an end for two=20

reasons," said the commander, as soon as he had given the orders for the di=
sposal of the=20

wounded man. "First, there is no longer any necessity for us to keep our ow=
n counsel, for=20

Mazagan is now deprived of the means of following us on our voyage; and sec=
ond, it would be=20

impossible to cover up our movements under the present circumstances. The n=
ervous mothers=20

have no longer any cause for alarm."  "It did not occur to me that we had m=
ade an end of this=20

scare business," said Captain Scott. "I had not thought of the matter in th=
at connection, and all I=20

did was to defend my steamer from the attack of the pirate, who proposed to=
 come on board and=20

take Louis Belgrave out of her."  "Then you did your duty!" exclaimed Capta=
in Ringgold, rising=20

from his arm-chair, and extending his hand to the young man. "I congratulat=
e you on your=20

success, and I am only sorry that the unfortunate grounding of the Guardian=
-Mother compelled=20

you to fight the battle alone. I had no intention of allowing the Maud to b=
e out of my sight more=20

than a few hours."  Louis, Felix, and Morris clapped their hands with all t=
heir might at the=20

indorsement the commander had given Captain Scott.  "I cannot express to yo=
u, Louis, how happy=20

I am to have you still with us," continued the captain of the ship, as he t=
ook the hand of the young=20

millionaire; "for it appears from the report of Captain Scott that you have=
 been in imminent danger=20

of being captured and carried off by that miscreant, and that you have been=
 saved only by the=20

bravery and determination of the commander of the Maud. He has done no more=
 than I would=20

have done in his place, and if the pirate had taken you I would have sunk h=
is steamer at sight to=20

rescue you."  "I am glad you approve the action of Captain Scott, though I =
had no doubt you would=20

do so when you learned the facts," replied Louis, as he pressed the hand of=
 the commander.  "But=20

I have got only a skeleton of the facts yet, and now I should like to hear =
the whole story in detail,"=20

said Captain Ringgold.  Scott took a paper from his pocket, the one he had =
drawn off of the=20

situation of the two steamers in Khrysoko Bay, with the position of the led=
ge, the trend of the=20



shore, and some of the soundings as he had taken them from the chart. He ha=
d marked the=20

course of the Maud in all the movements she had made, and also of the Fatim=
e, giving the=20

position of each vessel at the moment of the collision.  He began his recit=
al with the pointing out of=20

the places of each steamer as soon as the pirate came into the bay. The vis=
it of her boat to the=20

little steamer followed, and the marshalling of the five members of the shi=
p's company armed with=20

the repeating-rifles. The interview with Mazagan was as minutely stated as =
though a skilled=20

reporter of a newspaper had taken it down.  "That was the most amazing, pre=
sumptuous,=20

groundless, and insane demand that one person could make upon another," int=
erposed the=20

commander. "It was sheer piracy!"  Scott had so viewed it, and he proceeded=
 with his narrative.=20

Captain Ringgold had vacated his chair at the desk, on which the captain of=
 the Maud had placed=20

his diagram, and pointed out everything as he spoke. The attempted escape b=
y the supposed=20

channel near the shore was dwelt upon at some length, in order to enable th=
e young captain to=20

prove that he had done his best to avoid a collision with the enemy.  The f=
irst shots the Fatime had=20

fired at the Maud, though they had fallen far short of the mark, were menti=
oned so as to give them=20

their full effect; and Captain Ringgold declared that they were a sufficien=
t declaration of war.  "Only=20

one avenue of escape was open to me," continued Captain Scott, "and that wa=
s directly across=20

the bow of the enemy. If I remained where I was the Fatime could come in wi=
th the rising of the=20

tide, and sink the Maud at her leisure. Then the pirate fired the shot from=
 her starboard gun which=20

passed through the galley, and began to swing to, so as to bring her port g=
un to bear on the Maud.=20

"I won't deny that the shot which went through our upper works made me mad;=
 but I feared that=20

the next one might go through our boiler or engine, and then it would have =
been all over with us. I=20

determined to prevent such a disaster if I could. I had ordered the hands t=
o use the rifles; but most=20

of the crew concealed themselves under the top-gallant forecastle. I shifte=
d the helm, and drove=20

the little steamer's bow square into the broadside of the Fatime, just abaf=
t her fore chains.  "It=20

seemed to me from the feeling that she was going to bore her way through th=
e pirate craft, and I=20

rang to stop and back her. I gave the speed bell as soon as she began to go=
 astern, and the Maud=20

went clear, as I was afraid she would not."  The picking up of Mazagan afte=
r the Fatime had gone=20

down, and the visit of the boat from the shore, were given in detail, and t=
he narrative was=20

completed.  As soon as the story was finished, the commander took the hand =
of Captain Scott=20

again, and pressed it in silence for a moment. He had listened attentively =
to the report, interrupting=20

it but once, and had carefully followed the speaker as he pointed out his m=
ovements on the=20

diagram.  "I approved your conduct, Captain Scott, when I had only a partia=
l knowledge of what=20

you had done," said he. "I can now approve it with a full knowledge of the =
whole affair even more=20

heartily and decidedly than before. You have been resolute and unflinching =
from the beginning,=20

and you have not only fought your ship as bravely and skilfully as any nava=
l officer could have=20

done it, but you have done your best to avoid a conflict. I commend you wit=
h all my heart and=20

mind."  "I thank you, Captain Ringgold, for all the kind words you have spo=
ken, and I am rejoiced=20

to be informed on such authority as you are that I have done my duty faithf=
ully," replied the young=20

commander.  "I suppose the mothers in the boudoir are wondering what has be=
come of their=20

boys," added the commander. "I give you an hour to pass with them, and then=
 we must sail for=20

Port Said."  The conference was ended, and the boys all went to the boudoir=
.     CHAPTER XVII=20

THE INSIDE HISTORY OF THE VOYAGE   While the Guardian-Mother lay aground, t=
he mothers=20



in the cabin had become very anxious about their boys, and both of them had=
 spent wakeful nights=20

in thinking of them. In a comparison of notes it was evident that the wind =
had blown harder on the=20

coast of Egypt than farther to the north. But the ship had escaped from the=
 dilemma in the morning=20

at an early hour, and had made a quick run to Cape Arnauti.  There was ther=
efore great rejoicing=20

in the cabin when it was ascertained that the Maud was safe, with all on bo=
ard of her. Dr. Hawkes=20

operated upon Mazagan in the hospital, and readily removed the bullet from =
his shoulder. Ball,=20

one of the old man-of-war's-men of the crew, who had seen some service as a=
 nurse, was=20

appointed to take care of him.  The fact that the surgeon had a patient soo=
n became known in the=20

boudoir, and curiosity ran to the highest pitch to ascertain who and what h=
e was. All that was=20

known was the fact that he had been brought on board from the Maud, which S=
parks had learned=20

from the sailors who assisted in removing him. The commander and the "Big F=
our" were still=20

closeted on the upper deck, and there was no one to answer any questions.  =
Before Captain Scott=20

had finished his report, Dr. Hawkes rejoined the party; and he was immediat=
ely beset by the=20

curious ones for information. The seal of secrecy had been removed by the c=
ommander, and he=20

had not been instructed to be silent. He knew the patient as soon as he saw=
 him; for Mazagan had=20

been a prisoner on board of the ship for a considerable time after his capt=
ure in Pournea Bay.=20

"What is your patient, Dr. Hawkes?" asked Mrs. Blossom before he had fairly=
 crossed the=20

threshold of the door.  "A wounded man; bullet in the shoulder," replied th=
e surgeon with=20

professional discretion. "It is not a woman, and Ball has been called in as=
 his nurse."  "A bullet in=20

the shoulder!" exclaimed the excellent woman. "Will he die?"  "Undoubtedly =
he will, though=20

perhaps not for twenty or thirty years."  "Is the wound dangerous?"  "I don=
't think so."  "But who is=20

the man?"  "Captain Mazagan."  "Captain Mazagan!" exclaimed the good lady; =
and the name was=20

repeated by several others, for they had known him as the pirate who had at=
tacked the Maud for=20

the purpose of robbery, as they supposed, and they had seen him occasionall=
y on the upper deck=20

when the conferences were in progress there.  "How happened he to be wounde=
d in the shoulder,=20

doctor?" persisted the worthy lady.  "Because the bullet hit him there," re=
plied the stout surgeon=20

with a chuckle, which was promptly communicated to Uncle Moses.  "But who s=
hot him?"  "The=20

man who fired the gun at him."  "Who fired the gun?"  "I don't know."  "Wha=
t was Captain Mazagan=20

doing here?"  "I don't know."  "Has there been a fight here?"  "Not that I =
am aware of."  "Then how=20

did he get wounded?"  "I don't know," replied Dr. Hawkes, who evidently enj=
oyed the defeat of the=20

inquisitor; and Uncle Moses's huge frame was jarring like a pot of jelly un=
der the influence of his=20

inward chuckles.  "Have you dressed the wound of your patient without findi=
ng out anything at all=20

about how the man was wounded?" demanded the good lady, disgusted at her fa=
ilure.  "It was my=20

affair to dress his wound, and not to pump him, as I should have done if he=
 had taken a dose of=20

poison," laughed the doctor. "But I think you need have no anxiety about my=
 patient, for I have no=20

doubt he will do very well."  "But there must have been a quarrel or a figh=
t somewhere about here,=20

and I should like to know something about it," continued Mrs. Blossom, as s=
he dropped herself=20

heavily on one of the divans.  "I can give you no information whatever; for=
 I leave all the fights and=20

quarrels to our worthy and discreet commander, and do not meddle with his a=
ffairs," added the=20

surgeon.  "Do you really know nothing at all about what has happened here, =
Dr. Hawkes?" asked=20

Mrs. Belgrave; and it was plain that the curiosity of the rest of the party=
 was strongly excited,=20

though they were more guarded in manifesting it.  "Absolutely nothing, my d=
ear madam, beyond=20



the fact that the man is Captain Mazagan," replied Dr. Hawkes. "I never inq=
uire into the affairs of=20

my patients beyond what it is necessary for me to know in treating the case=
. I have no doubt=20

Captain Ringgold will give you all the particulars of whatever has happened=
 here; for it looks as=20

though something of importance had occurred."  A little later the commander=
, followed by the four=20

boys, appeared, and Mrs. Blossom renewed the onslaught. The others were, pe=
rhaps, quite as=20

anxious to learn what had taken place; but they were silent, and waited for=
 the captain to answer=20

her questions if he was disposed to do so.  "I am sorry to interrupt this p=
leasant party, ladies and=20

gentlemen, but I have already given the order to weigh the anchor, and we s=
hall go to sea=20

immediately," said Captain Ringgold. "The young gentlemen of the Maud must =
take their leave,=20

and return to the tender."  "Has anything happened here, Captain Ringgold?"=
 asked Mrs.=20

Belgrave, taking him by the arm.  "Something has happened here," replied th=
e commander, loud=20

enough to be heard by all in the boudoir. "But here are the four young men =
in whom you are all=20

more or less interested, and you can see that they are not injured."  "Have=
 you been hurt, Mr.=20

Belgrave?" asked Miss Blanche, by whose side Louis had taken his place when=
 he entered the=20

apartment, as he was very much in the habit of doing when the party assembl=
ed.  "Not a hair of=20

my head has been damaged," he replied.  "As soon as we are under way, and g=
et clear of the=20

shore, I shall tell you the whole story of certain events which have transp=
ired in Khrysoko Bay=20

during our absence," continued the commander. "I am willing to add that it =
will make quite a=20

thrilling narrative. About two o'clock to-morrow afternoon I expect the Gua=
rdian-Mother and the=20

Maud will be at Port Said, at the entrance to the Suez Canal."  The mothers=
 hugged their boys=20

again even for the separation of eighteen hours, and the hands of the other=
s were duly shaken.=20

Mrs. Blossom did not attempt to hug the Milesian this time.  "What has happ=
ened here, Felix?" she=20

asked in a low tone; for the good lady would have been glad to get at the s=
olution of the mystery,=20

in order that she might give a hint of it to the others.  "Captain Ringgold=
 will tell you all about it; it=20

would take me six hours to do so, and I have not the time," replied Felix a=
s he bolted through the=20

door.  "Six hours!" exclaimed the amiable lady. "Then we shall have to sit =
up about all night to hear=20

the story. I wonder what the boys have been doing in this lonely place."  S=
he was no wiser than=20

the rest of the party. The two sons tore themselves away from their mothers=
, and Louis was=20

permitted to take the hand of Miss Blanche in bidding her adieu. The comman=
der had sent four of=20

the old sailors on board of the little steamer to stand the watches during =
the trip; for the "Big Four"=20

were believed to be thoroughly exhausted after a night in the gale and the =
most exciting day of all=20

their lives. This was certainly true of Captain Scott, for he had hardly sl=
ept a wink in the last thirty-

six hours, and the others were tired enough.  The chief engineer had been n=
otified of the=20

immediate departure of the Maud, and the fasts were cast off as soon as the=
 ship's company went=20

on board. Stevens, the carpenter of the ship, had repaired the damage done =
in the galley, and a=20

supply of provisions had been put on board.  Captain Scott had submitted th=
e question as to=20

whether anything was to be done in regard to the ship's company of the Fati=
me. The matter had=20

been decided at once. Captain Mazagan had declared war against the Maud, an=
d had proceeded=20

to enforce his preposterous demand. He had made a failure of it, and outsid=
e of the call of ordinary=20

humanity, the commander believed that it was not his duty to look out for t=
he comfort of the=20

marauders. A sufficient supply of provisions had been sent to those on shor=
e, and the pirate=20

himself was under treatment on board of the ship. What was to be done with =
him was a question=20



for the future.  Captain Scott remained in the pilot-house of the Maud till=
 the steamer was well off=20

the cape, and then gave out the course, south and a half west. It was Morri=
s's watch, and he=20

insisted on remaining on the forecastle, as he had obtained a portion of hi=
s sleep the night before.=20

The ship soon followed her consort; and as soon as the commander had given =
out the course he=20

hastened to the boudoir, where the party were awaiting his appearance.  "It=
 is hardly necessary for=20

me to give the nautical points involved in 'The Battle of Khrysoko,'" said =
Captain Ringgold, as he=20

laid the diagram of the captain of the Maud on the table.  "I beg your pard=
on, Captain--involved in=20

what?" interrupted Mr. Woolridge, who seemed to be bothered by the proper n=
ame.  "'The Battle of=20

Khrysoko,'" repeated the commander with a smile. "That is the name the boys=
 gave to the affair,=20

calling it after the bay in which it occurred, though it is rather a high-s=
ounding designation for it."=20

"Are we to understand that a battle has been fought here, Captain Ringgold?=
" inquired the=20

magnate of the Fifth Avenue, as Louis had called him.  "It did not rise to =
the dignity of a regular=20

naval engagement, though it took place on the waters of the bay," replied t=
he captain. "Perhaps if=20

we call it a contest for superiority, it would cover the idea better. But t=
his party are not prepared to=20

understand what has taken place in Khrysoko Bay; and I must admit that I ha=
ve concealed from=20

you for the last three months certain features of our voyage, a knowledge o=
f which would have=20

rendered some of you very nervous and unhappy.  "I did not consult Dr. Hawk=
es in relation to the=20

effect upon one of his patients, but I am confident he would have advised m=
e to do as I have done.=20

I am equally confident that another of your number would very soon have bec=
ome one of his=20

patients if I had been imprudent enough to put her in possession of all the=
 facts in the situation. If I=20

had done so at Athens, Zante, or Alexandria, I am almost certain that the G=
uardian-Mother would=20

have been speeding her way across the Atlantic to New York; for some of the=
 party would have=20

insisted upon abandoning the voyage as projected.  "My only confidants in t=
he inside history of this=20

voyage for the last six months, or since we visited Mogadore, were the four=
 young men who have=20

just left you. Now I will relate this inside history, and give all the fact=
s without any reservation=20

whatever. I must begin back at Mogadore; and as I mention the incidents of =
our cruise so far, you=20

will remember all of them. 'The Battle of Khrysoko' is the last chapter of =
the story, and for the=20

present at least, and I hope forever, has removed all danger from our path.=
"  By this time the entire=20

party were all attention. The captain began his review of the incidents of =
the voyage at Mogadore.=20

He used the time judiciously, but it took him a full hour to bring the hist=
ory down to the final event.=20

Whatever had been dark and mysterious in the past was made plain. The disco=
very of the plot=20

made by Louis in the cafe at Gallipoli made a tremendous impression, and Dr=
. Hawkes had to=20

attend to Mrs. Belgrave, she became so excited and nervous.  The stirring e=
vents in the bay were=20

given very cautiously by the speaker, though he told the whole truth. He st=
ated enough of the=20

nautical situation to enable the party to understand the affair; and he war=
mly commended Captain=20

Scott for the decisive act by which he had finished the encounter, after he=
 had used every effort to=20

escape a conflict.  "And did that wicked pirate actually fire cannon-balls =
into the Maud while Louis=20

was on board of her?" asked Mrs. Belgrave, very much excited.  "He put one =
shot through her,=20

though Louis was on the upper deck, firing his rifle into the enemy, and he=
 was in no danger,"=20

replied the commander.  It was midnight when the narrative and the comments=
 upon it were=20

finished. The doctor attended to his patient in the cabin, and then to the =
other in the hospital.=20

Mazagan felt better, and wanted to talk; but Dr. Hawkes would not permit hi=
m to do so. The party=20



retired with enough to think about.  At the time stated by the commander, t=
he Guardian-Mother=20

and the Maud were off the red light on the end of the breakwater at the ent=
rance to the Suez=20

Canal.     CHAPTER XVIII  A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SUEZ CANAL   The sea was q=
uite=20

smooth when the Guardian-Mother and her tender arrived off Port Said. There=
 was about thirty=20

feet of water off the breakwater; and though there was an extensive basin a=
t the town, the=20

commander preferred to anchor outside for purposes he had in view. The trip=
 to Cyprus had=20

interrupted the educational work of the tourists, and this was the grand ob=
ject ever uppermost in=20

his mind.  Though this instructive element of the cruise around the world h=
ad been prominent in=20

his thoughts before the steamer sailed from New York, it was rather indefin=
ite in its details, so that=20

he had failed to make some preparations for the work which the experience o=
f a year now=20

suggested to him. In the lectures, conferences, talks, and explanations to =
individuals, the=20

professor and himself had felt the want of suitable maps on a large scale. =
 At Alexandria he had=20

obtained a large map of Egypt, though it was not just what was wanted; but =
it had answered the=20

purpose tolerably well. The subjects which would be next in order were full=
 of interest to him, and=20

were likely to be so to the members of the party; for they included some of=
 the older countries of=20

the world, such as Syria, Babylonia, Assyria, Persia, and Arabia. Geographi=
cally they were=20

comparatively unfamiliar to the members of the party, who, unlike the profe=
ssor, the surgeon, and=20

Uncle Moses, had not been liberally educated.  The instruction given at the=
 various places on the=20

voyage, and the studies of the students on the wing, had demonstrated that =
such maps were=20

indispensable. But Captain Ringgold was a man of expedients. Every steamer,=
 especially those=20

engaged in making long voyages, has a paint-shop on board, more or less abu=
ndantly supplied=20

with all necessary material. All seamen are required to do plain painting; =
for such a ship as the=20

Guardian-Mother had to be kept in the nicest condition.  At Alexandria and =
Cairo the commander=20

had procured such additional material as was needed for the production of t=
he maps desired.=20

Some of the sailors were more skilful in the use of the brush than others; =
and as soon as the=20

captain mentioned his purpose to the first and second officers, they were a=
ble to point out a couple=20

of men who had some artistic ideas in their composition.  All the crew were=
 able seamen, and=20

every one of them was skilled in the use of the sail-needle and palm, thoug=
h of course in different=20

degrees, as in all other occupations. Some of these had sewed the canvas to=
gether on which the=20

maps were to be drawn and painted. It was not expected that anything which =
would pass the=20

scrutiny of an artist would be produced; only such work as would answer the=
 purpose of=20

illustration.  In Mr. P. Lord Gaskette, the second officer of the ship, Cap=
tain Ringgold found his=20

ablest assistant. He was a graduate of one of the most noted colleges of th=
e United States, and=20

had made some progress in the study of the legal profession. Unfortunately =
his health had failed=20

him, and he had turned his attention to artistic pursuits for the sake of t=
he out-door life to be=20

obtained in sketching. He had taken some lessons in drawing and painting; b=
ut his physician had=20

insisted that he should go to sea. He had been seven years a wanderer over =
the world, having=20

shipped before the mast, and reached his present position.  In the paint-sh=
op he was quite at=20

home. He was assisted by the two seamen the most skilled with the brush, wh=
ile he did the=20

drawing himself. The large atlas of the world, a very expensive work, belon=
ging to the commander,=20

supplied accurate maps on a small scale, and these were transferred to the =
canvas, eight feet=20

square. During the voyage to Cyprus three of these maps had been finished. =
One of them was the=20



Delta of Egypt, including the Suez Canal; and the commander declared that i=
t was handsome=20

enough to=20


_
the crisp bank-notes fairly crackled when Mrs. Weatherford spent them, kept=
 their lackeyed and=20

liveried state in a castle-like mansion in Mesa Circle, the most expensive,=
 if not the most=20

aristocratic, no-thoroughfare of the capital city. Weatherford, the father,=
 egged on by Mrs.=20

Weatherford, had political aspirations pointing toward a United States sena=
torship, the election to=20

which would fall within the province of the next legislature. The mine-owne=
r himself, a pudgy little=20

man with a bald spot on top of his head and a corner-grocery point of view =
carefully tucked away=20

inside of it--an outlook upon life which was a survival from his hard-worki=
ng past--would willingly=20

have dodged, but Mrs. Weatherford was inexorable. There were two grown daug=
hters and a=20

growing son, and it was for these that she was socially ambitious.  The rec=
eption for which the=20

senator's wife and her guest had driven thirty miles through the dust of th=
e sage-brush hills was=20

one of the many moves in Mrs. Weatherford's private campaign. For the openi=
ng-gun occasion the=20

great house in Mesa Circle was lighted from basement to turret--to all of t=
he numerous turrets; an=20

awning fringed with electric bulbs sheltered the carpeted walk from the str=
eet to the grand=20

entrance, an army of lackeys paraded in the vestibule, and the wives and da=
ughters of the bravest=20

and best in the capital city's political contingent stood with Mrs. Weather=
ford in the long receiving-

line.  From room to room in the vast house a curiously assorted throng of t=
he bidden ones worked=20

its way as the jam and crush permitted. A firm believer in the maxim that i=
n numbers there is=20

strength, the hostess had made her invitation-list long and catholic. For t=
he gossips there were the=20

crowded drawing-rooms, for the hungry there were Lucullian tables, and for =
the sentimentalists=20

there was the conservatory.  It was a mark of the unashamed newness of the =
Weatherford riches=20

that the conservatory, a glass-and-iron greenhouse, built out as an extensi=
on of one of the=20

drawing-rooms, was called "the herbarium." It was a reproduction, on a gene=
rous scale, of a=20

tropical garden. Half-grown palms and banana-trees made a well-ordered jung=
le of the softly=20

lighted interior; and if, in the gathering of her floral treasures, Mrs. We=
atherford had omitted any=20

precious bit of greenery whose cost would have shed additional lustre upon =
the Weatherford=20

resources, it was because no one had remembered to mention the name of it t=
o her.  Ex-Senator=20

Blount's party of three was fashionably late at the function in Mesa Circle=
, but in the crush filling=20

the spacious drawing-rooms the hostess and her long line of receiving assis=
tants were still on=20

duty. Having successfully passed the line with her husband and Patricia, li=
ttle Mrs. Blount looked=20

about her, saw Mr. Richard Gantry, signalled to him with her eyes, and, wit=
h the traffic manager for=20

her centre-rush to wedge a way through the crowded rooms, was presently los=
t to sight--at least=20

from Miss Anners's point of view.  Whether she knew it or not, from the mom=
ent of her appearance=20

at the hostess's end of the long receiving-line, the senator's wife had bee=
n marked and followed in=20

her slow progress through the rooms by a thin-faced man who seemed to be ne=
rvously trying to=20

hunch himself into better relations with his ill-fitting dress-coat, an eag=
er gentleman whose hawk-

like eyes never lost sight of the little lady with her hand on Gantry's arm=
. Only the senator saw and=20

remarked this bit of by-play, and he looked as if he were enjoying it, the =
shrewd gray eyes lighting=20

humorously as he bent to hear what Patricia was saying.  When his quarry st=
opped, as she did=20

frequently to chat with one or another of the guests, the man with the hawk=
-like profile and the=20

nervous hunch circled warily, and once or twice seemed about to make the op=
portunity which was=20

so slow in making itself. But it was not until the little lady in the clare=
t-colored party-gown had=20

drifted, still with a hand on Gantry's arm, in among the palm and banana tr=
ees of the herbarium=20



that the bird-of-prey person made his swoop. A moment later Gantry, taking =
a low-toned command=20

from his companion, was disappearing in the direction of the refreshment-ta=
bles, and the lady=20

looked up to say: "Dear me, Mr. Hathaway, you almost startled me!"  "Did I?=
" said the lumber-king,=20

rather grimly, if he meant the query to be apologetic. "I am sorry. I didn'=
t mean to; but Mrs. Gordon=20

said I would find you here, and so I took the liberty of following you. I'm=
 needing a little=20

straightening out, you know, and--ah--would you mind letting me talk busine=
ss with you for a=20

minute or two, Mrs. Blount?"  She drew her gown aside, and made room for hi=
m on the carved=20

rustic settee, which was exceedingly uncomfortable to sit in, but which was=
 in perfect harmony=20

with the background of gigantic palmettos. He nodded gratefully and took th=
e place, and the=20

manner of his sitting down was that of a man who wears evening-clothes only=
 under compulsion.=20

"Business?" she was saying. "Certainly not; if you can talk business in suc=
h a place as this"--

giving him the coveted permission.  "Perhaps it ain't what you'd call busin=
ess--maybe it's only=20

politics," he resumed; then, with the abruptness of one whose dealings have=
 been with men=20

oftener than with women: "In the first place, I wish you'd tell me what I'v=
e been doing to get myself=20

into your bad books."  She laughed easily. "Who said you had been doing any=
thing, Mr.=20

Hathaway?" she asked.  "The senator," he answered shortly, adding: "He told=
 me I'd have to make=20

my peace with you."  She had developed a sudden interest in the quaint Japa=
nese figures on the=20

ivory sticks of her fan. "You want something, Mr. Hathaway; what is it?" sh=
e inquired.  "I want to be=20

put next in this pigs-in-clover railroad puzzle," was the blunt statement o=
f the need. "Our freight=20

contract with the Transcontinental is about to expire, and I'd like to get =
it renewed on the same=20

terms as before."  "Well," she said ingenuously, "why don't you do it?"  "I=
 can't," he blustered.=20

"Everybody has suddenly grown mysterious or gone crazy--I don't know which.=
 Kittredge, the=20

general superintendent, don't seem to remember that we ever had any contrac=
t, and Gantry is just=20

as bad. And when I go to the senator he tells me I must make my peace with =
you. I'm left out in=20

the cold; I can't begin to _sabe_ what the senator and these railroad brass=
-collar men are driving=20

at. I've got something to sell; something that the railroad company needs. =
Where the d---- I mean,=20

where's the hitch?"  The small person in the fetching party-gown reached up=
 and pinched a leaf=20

from a fragrant shrub fronting the settee.  "Mr. Gantry has gone to fetch m=
e an ice, and he will be=20

back in a very few minutes," she suggested mildly. "Consider your peace mad=
e, Mr. Hathaway,=20

and tell me what I can do for you."  "You can put me next," said the lumber=
 lord, going back to the=20

only phrase that seemed to fit the exigencies of the case. "Why the--why ca=
n't we get our contract=20

renewed?"  The little lady was opening and shutting her fan slowly. "What w=
as your contract?" she=20

inquired innocently.  "If I thought you didn't know, I'd go a long time wit=
hout telling you," he said=20

bluntly. "But you do know. It's the rebate lumber rate from our mills at Tw=
in Buttes and elsewhere,=20

and it was given us two years ago, a  The Maud had made fast to the ship as=
 usual when she=20

came to anchor, and the "Big Four" were to report on board as soon as they =
had put their craft to=20

rights. The party had mounted the promenade as soon as the low shore was in=
 sight, and were=20

looking about them at the various objects in view. Several large English st=
eamers were in sight,=20

including one of the P. & O. Line, and the Ophir, the largest and finest of=
 the Orient Line, both=20

bound to India and other countries of the Orient.  "How is your patient thi=
s afternoon, Dr.=20

Hawkes?" asked the commander, as he met the physician on his way to the pro=
menade.  "He is=20

doing very well. He has very little pain now; and I think he will be as wel=
l as ever in a fortnight or=20



three weeks, if he will only be reasonable," replied the doctor.  "Reasonab=
le? Doesn't he wish to=20

get well?" asked the commander.  "He wants to talk, and evidently has somet=
hing on his mind. He=20

desires an interview with you, Captain, and has asked me to obtain it for h=
im; but I refused to do=20

anything of the kind, for he has some fever hanging about him, and must be =
kept as quiet as=20

possible."  "I don't know that I have any business with him, or he with me.=
 I consider him one of=20

the most unmitigated villains that ever walked the earth or sailed the seas=
," added Captain=20

Ringgold. "The scoundrel does not seem to have common-sense; for he puts fo=
rward the most=20

absurd claims that ever were invented, and it would not surprise me at all =
if he advanced another=20

against me or Louis, in spite of the overwhelming defeat he has just sustai=
ned."  "He is the coolest=20

and most impudent rascal I ever heard of. He asks Louis for a vast sum of m=
oney, and then=20

politely requests him to become a prisoner in the cabin of the Fatime as se=
curity for the payment=20

of the sum by his trustee;" and the doctor shook his fat sides with laughte=
r at the absurdity.  "Very=20

likely he has some such proposition to make to me. He really believes, I th=
ink, that he has a fair=20

claim for what he has lost, or failed to obtain, by the miscarriage of all =
his plots to make a prisoner=20

of Louis and Miss Blanche. All I desire is to get rid of the villain; and a=
s soon as you inform me that=20

he is off your hands I shall put him on shore."  The captain and the doctor=
 joined the party on the=20

promenade. Mr. Gaskette and his assistant were hanging one of the maps comp=
leted on the upper=20

deck, where the conferences were usually held. He had assigned subjects to =
several members of=20

the party, and he seemed to be anxious to have them disposed of; for he dec=
lared that this locality=20

was one of the most interesting corners of the world to him.  On the promen=
ade the mothers had=20

their sons by their side, and Mrs. Blossom had secured possession of Felix =
in some manner that=20

did not appear; but the good woman seemed to be superlatively happy. The co=
mmander did not=20

take a seat, but took a stand in front of the company. He described the two=
 big steamers that were=20

approaching, in answer to a question put by Mrs. Belgrave.  "Of course you =
all recognize the shore=20

before you," he continued.  "There isn't much shore there, only a strip of =
sand, with water beyond=20

it," added Mrs. Woolridge.  "What country is it?" asked Miss Blanche in a w=
hisper to Louis, who=20

had his mother on one side of him and the fair maiden on the other.  "Egypt=
," replied Louis,=20

wondering that she did not know.  "The water you see is Lake Menzaleh," ans=
wered the captain.=20

"It is not much of a lake, as Americans would look at it. It is a sort of l=
agoon, covering from five=20

hundred to a thousand square miles, according to different authorities; but=
 the inundation of the=20

Nile makes varying areas of water. The Damietta branch of the great river e=
mpties into the sea=20

about thirty miles to the west of us, and this lagoon covers the region bet=
ween it and the Suez=20

Canal.  "The lake is separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow strip of =
land, which you can=20

see, through which are a number of openings, such as we find in the sand-sp=
its along the shore of=20

our own country. But unlike our inlets, they were formerly mouths of the Ni=
le, or at least of streams=20

connected with it; and all of them have names, as the Mendesian Mouth, the =
Tanitic, the Pelusian,=20

and others.  "It is full of islands, on some of which are the remains of Ro=
man towns. The average=20

depth of the water is not more than three feet; but it abounds in fish, and=
 it is the abode of vast=20

flocks of aquatic birds, which are hunted by many English sportsmen, who ca=
mp out there to enjoy=20

the shooting. The morass has been partially drained, which accounts for the=
 low water in the lake=20

at the present time; and undoubtedly it will all be above the ordinary leve=
l of the Nile at no very=20

distant time.  "The Suez Canal extends in a perfectly straight line, north =
and south, through this=20



lake and the low land around it. But we will not meddle with the canal just=
 yet, for we shall have a=20

great deal of time to talk about it while we are going through it; for it i=
s a hundred miles long, and=20

steamers are required to move very slowly, except in the lakes now forming =
part of it. As this canal=20

is one of the most important enterprises ever carried through to a completi=
on, I have asked Mr.=20

Woolridge to give us an account of its construction and uses. Then I shall =
invite you to adjourn to=20

the promenade deck, where I have prepared something more in relation to Egy=
pt, the 'Land of=20

Goshen.'  "This canal takes its name from the isthmus or city of that name,=
 or the Red Sea; more=20

properly from the former, as it makes its passage through it," Mr. Woolridg=
e began. "Our old friend,=20

Ramses II., of whom we have heard so much in the last four weeks, is said t=
o have been the first=20

to dig out a Suez Canal, though I cannot inform you by what name he called =
it in the Egyptian=20

language; but that was a small affair compared with the one before us. But =
our friend's canal got=20

filled up from the amount of mud and sand lying loose around here.  "Darius=
 I. of Persia cleaned it=20

out, though it was suffered to become useless again. Then the Mohammedan co=
nquerors of Egypt=20

opened it once more; but they lacked the modern facilities for handling mud=
 and sand, and it went=20

to ruin again, and was useless till a comparatively modern date.  "When Nap=
oleon I. was in Egypt=20

the subject attracted his attention, and he employed an expert French engin=
eer to examine the=20

matter. This gentleman declared that the level of the Red Sea was thirty fe=
et higher than that of=20

the Mediterranean; and this report knocked the scheme higher than a kite. B=
ut in 1841 the English=20

officers employed in this region proved the fallacy of the French engineer'=
s conclusion, and the=20

subject came up again for consideration.  "This time it was the Vicompte de=
 Lesseps, another=20

French engineer, who took up the subject. He was born at Versailles in 1805=
, had been educated=20

for the diplomatic profession, and had served his country acceptably in thi=
s capacity at Lisbon,=20

Cairo, Barcelona, and Madrid. In 1854 he began upon the work, and two years=
 later obtained a=20

concession of certain privileges for his proposed company, which was duly f=
ormed, and began the=20

actual work of construction in 1860. Nine years after it was completed, and=
 formally opened with=20

extraordinary ceremonies and festivities, and has now been in successful op=
eration about twenty-

two years. Queen Victoria of=20


_
few days before election."  "And the consideration?" she asked, looking up =
quickly.  "You know=20

that, too, Mrs. Blount. It was the swinging of the solid employees' vote of=
 the Twin Buttes Lumber=20

Company over to the railroad ticket."  "And you wish to make the same arran=
gement again?"=20

"Exactly. We've got to have that preferential rate or go out of business." =
 "With whom did you=20

make the contract two years ago?"  "With Mr. McVickar, verbally. Of course,=
 there wasn't anything=20

put down in black and white, but the railroad folks did their part and we d=
id ours."  "I see--a=20

gentleman's agreement," she murmured; and then: "You have tried Mr. McVicka=
r again?"  "Yes,=20

and he referred me to Gantry."  "And what did Mr. Gantry say?"  "I couldn't=
 get him to say anything=20

with any sense in it," said the lumber magnate grittingly. "The most I coul=
d get out of him was that I=20

would have to see the boss."  "And instead of doing that you went to see th=
e senator?" she asked.=20

"Of course I did. Who else would Gantry mean by 'the boss'?" demanded the b=
efogged one.=20

"Possibly he meant the senator's son," she ventured, tapping a pretty cheek=
 with the folded fan.=20

"Have you been leaving Evan Blount out in all of this?"  "I didn't know whe=
re to put him in. That's=20

what brings me here to-night. The senator, or McVickar, or both of them tog=
ether, have set the=20

whole State to running around in circles with this appointment of young Blo=
unt. Some say it's a=20

deal between the senator and McVickar, and some say it's a fight. Half of t=
he professional=20

spellbinders are walking in their sleep over it right now. I thought maybe =
you could tell me, Mrs.=20

Blount."  "I can't tell you anything that would help the people who are wal=
king in their sleep," she=20

returned, "but I might offer a suggestion in your personal affair. Mr. Evan=
 Blount is your man."=20

Hathaway pursed his thin lips and frowned. "I'm in bad there--right at the =
jump," he objected.  "I=20

know," she shot back quickly. "For some reason best known to yourself, you =
saw fit to have Mr.=20

Evan waylaid and man-handled on the first night of his return to his native=
 State. But you needn't=20

worry about that. He won't hold it against you. I'm sure you'll find him en=
tirely amenable to reason."=20

The tyrant of "timber-jacks" frowned again. "H'm--reason, eh? How big a blo=
ck of Twin Buttes=20

stock shall I offer him?"  Her laugh was a silvery peal of derision.  "You =
always figure in dollars and=20

cents, don't you, Mr. Simon Peter Hathaway?" she mocked.  "I have always fo=
und it the cheapest=20

in the end."  "Listen," she said, with the folded fan held up like a monito=
ry finger. "Mr. Gantry may=20

be back any minute, and I can give you only the tiniest hint. You must go t=
o Mr. Evan Blount and=20

appeal to him frankly, as one business man to another."  "But I have heard-=
-they say he's all kinds=20

of a crank."  "Never mind what you have heard. Tell him all the facts and a=
sk him to help you, and=20

for mercy's sake don't offer him a block of your stock. Put it where it wil=
l do the most good. Put it in=20

the name of Professor William J. Anners, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and s=
how Mr. Blount how=20

dreadfully disastrous the loss of the preferential freight rate would be to=
 all the poor people in your=20

list of stock-holders--including Professor Anners."  Hathaway drew down his=
 cuff and made a=20

pencil memorandum of the name and address of the new beneficiary.  "You'll =
notice that I'm not=20

asking any foolish questions about who this Professor Anners is, or why I s=
hould be making him a=20

present of a block of stock. If I don't, it's because what you say goes as =
it lies. Anything else?"=20

"Yes; don't fail to be perfectly frank with Mr. Blount, and don't let him p=
ut you off. He may pretend=20

to be very angry at first, but you won't mind that."  "I won't mind anythin=
g if I can bring this=20

business down to the every-day commonplace earth once more. You and the sen=
ator and Gantry=20

and McVickar are playing some sort of a game, and you ain't showing me anyt=
hing more than the=20

back of the cards. That's all right. I guess I'm fly enough to play my hand=
 blindfolded, if I've got to. I=20



don't care, just so I win the odd trick."  Gantry was coming down the avenu=
e of banana-trees with=20

the ice he had taken so much time to procure, and the lumber magnate rose r=
eluctantly. There=20

was time for only one more question, and he put it hastily.  "When and wher=
e can I find Evan=20

Blount?" he asked.  "The day after to-morrow, at his office in Temple Court=
. He is out of the city=20

now, but--" Here Gantry's coming put an end to the private conference, and =
the president of the=20

Twin Buttes company went his way.  Not until they had served out their full=
 sentence at Mrs.=20

Weatherford's crush, and were back in the private dining-room suite at the =
Inter-Mountain, with=20

Miss Anners safely behind the closed door of her own apartment, did the sma=
ll conspirator pass=20

the word of good hope on to her husband.  "It is working beautifully," she =
exulted. "He will go to=20

see Evan day after to-morrow--and after that, the deluge."     XI  THE GREA=
T GAME   If Evan=20

Blount, as the representative of the unpopular railroad, had been anticipat=
ing an unfriendly=20

reception at the great gold-camp in the Carnadine Hills, he was agreeably d=
isappointed. A=20

committee of citizens, headed by Jasper Steuchfield, the "Paramounter" chai=
rman for Carnadine=20

County, met him at the train, escorted him to the hotel, and, during the af=
ternoon which was at his=20

disposal, gave him joyously and hilariously the freedom of the camp.  The p=
olitical meeting, called=20

for an early hour in the evening, was held in the Carnadine Mining Company'=
s ore-shed, electric-

lighted for the occasion. When the hour came the big shed was packed with a=
n enthusiastic=20

audience, and there were prolonged cheers and hand-clappings when the railr=
oad advocate took=20

his seat on the improvised platform as the guest of the local committee.  L=
ater, when Judge=20

Crowley, candidate prospective on the popular ticket for the State Senate, =
opened the joint debate=20

with a shrewd arraignment of the methods of the railroad company, not only =
in its dealings with the=20

public as a common carrier, but also in the pertinacity with which it invad=
ed the political field, there=20

was tumultuous applause; but it was no heartier than that which greeted Blo=
unt when he rose to=20

present the railroad side of the argument.  During the journey from the cap=
ital, which had=20

consumed the night and the greater portion of the forenoon, he had prepared=
 his speech. His=20

argument--the one unanswerable argument, as it appeared to him--was the abs=
urdity and injustice=20

of a law which presumed to limit the earning power of a corporation by fixi=
ng the maximum rates it=20

might charge, without at the same time making a corresponding regulation fi=
xing the price which=20

the company should pay for its labor and material.  Upon this foundation he=
 was able to build a fair=20

structure of oratory. The judge, his opponent, was a rather turgid man whos=
e speech had=20

abounded in flights of denunciation and whose appeal had been made frankly =
to prejudice and=20

party rancor. Blount took his cue shrewdly. Touching lightly upon the publi=
c grievances, some of=20

which he characterized as just and entirely defensible, he rang the changes=
 calmly and logically=20

upon the square deal, no less for the corporations than for the individual.=
 "Take it to yourselves,=20

you merchants," he urged. "Imagine a law on the statute-books fixing the pr=
ices at which you shall=20

sell your goods, and that same law leaving you at the mercy of those from w=
hom you must buy!=20

Take it to yourselves, you miners. Suppose the legislature had enacted a la=
w fixing the maximum=20

price at which you shall sell your skill and your labor, and at the same ti=
me leaving it optional with=20

every man from whom you buy, the butcher, the baker, the grocer, to charge =
you what he pleases=20

or what he can get! That, my good friends, is the situation of the railroad=
 company in this State to-

day"--and he went on to analyze the hard situation, filling his hour very c=
reditably and, if the=20

frequent bursts of applause could be taken to mean anything, to the complet=
e satisfaction of his=20



hearers. Indeed, at the end of his argument he was given what the local pap=
er of the following day=20

was pleased to call "a spontaneous and pandemonious ovation."  After the ch=
eering and hand-

shaking, Steuchfield and his fellow-committeemen went to the train with the=
 visiting speaker, and=20

no one in the throng of congratulators was more enthusiastic than the oppos=
ition chairman.  "That=20

was a cracking good speech--a great speech, Mr. Blount!" he said, as the br=
anch train rattled in=20

from the north. "If you can go all over the State making as good talks as t=
he one we've just heard,=20

you'll tie the whole shooting-match up in a hard knot for us fellows. But M=
cVickar won't let you do=20

it--not by a long shot!"  The potential tier of hard knots laughed genially=
. "I C. S. I."  "What does=20

that mean, papa?" asked Miss Blanche.  "It is a big distinction, and that i=
s all I know about it,"=20

replied the speaker with a laugh; for he was not student enough to look up =
what he did not=20

comprehend.  "Knight Commander of the Star of India," added Louis, who had =
looked up the=20

abbreviation.  "Thank you, Mr. Belgrave. From 25,000 to 30,000 men were emp=
loyed upon the=20

work. It was delayed by the necessity of completing a fresh-water canal to =
Ismailia, about half way=20

through to Suez, and by some trouble with Ismail, who had succeeded as vice=
roy. The original=20

capital of the company was about forty million dollars of our money; but th=
e total cost, including the=20

auxiliary works required to put it in running order, was one hundred millio=
n dollars. Yet it is good=20

stock to-day; and all the steamers that used to be obliged to go around Cap=
e Good Hope pass=20

through the canal, and did so before some of you were born.  "As the comman=
der observed a little=20

while ago, the canal is 100 miles long. The width of the water surface is f=
rom 150 to 300 feet,=20

though it has changed somewhat since the canal was built. At the bottom it =
was 72 feet wide, and=20

the shoalest place has 26 feet in depth. As you see around you, two breakwa=
ters had to be built,=20

involving an immense amount of labor and expense; for one of them is nearly=
 7,000, and the other=20

a little more than 6,000, feet in length.  "The highest level on the isthmu=
s is 52 feet, so that they=20

did not have to dig very deep anywhere; and there were several depressions =
in the level, which=20

made the work still less. The canal passes through three lakes: first, Menz=
aleh, 28 miles; Timsah,=20

5 miles; and the Bitter Lakes, 23 miles. Every five or six miles there are =
side basins where one=20

ship can pass another. That is all I need say at present; but as we are sai=
ling through, there will be=20

much more to say."  The usual applause followed, and then the commander too=
k the rostrum.=20

CHAPTER XIX  THE JOURNEY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL   Captain Ringgold sugge=
sted=20

to the magnate of the Fifth Avenue that he had omitted something, as he poi=
nted to the long piers=20

which extended out into the sea.  "I had it on my tongue's end to mention t=
hem; but I am not much=20

accustomed to speaking before an audience, and I forgot to do so," replied =
Mr. Woolridge. "But=20

then they are engineering work, and I doubt if this company would be intere=
sted."  "I was=20

wondering where they obtained all the stone to build them in this place, wh=
ere there appears to be=20

nothing but sand and mud," interposed Mrs. Belgrave. "They must be nearly a=
 mile long."  "They=20

are quite a mile long," replied Mr. Woolridge.  "Did they bring the stone f=
rom the quarries away up=20

the Nile, where they got the material of which the pyramids are built?"  "N=
ot at all; that would have=20

been about as big a job as digging out the canal."  "Hardly; for they could=
 have brought them by=20

water about all the way," said the commander. "But the material did not com=
e from those=20

quarries."  "No; they made the rocks," added the magnate.  "Made them!" exc=
laimed Mrs.=20

Blossom. "Do you expect us to believe that?"  "There is a great deal of suc=
h work done in the=20

United States, and in some of our cities there are streets paved and sidewa=
lks built of=20



manufactured stone," replied Mr. Woolridge. "At the town which you see, the=
 piers start out about=20

two-thirds of a mile apart, and approach each other till they are less than=
 a third of a mile from=20

each other. They were built to protect the port from the north-west winds w=
hich sometimes blow=20

very fresh here, and to prevent the harbor of Port Said from being choked u=
p with the Nile mud=20

from the mouths of the great river.  "These piers were constructed by a Fre=
nch firm. The first thing=20

was to manufacture the artificial stone, which was composed of seven parts =
sand, of which there=20

is a plentiful supply in this vicinity, and one part of hydraulic lime, imp=
orted from France. I suppose=20

the latter is something like the cement used in New York in building sewers=
 and drains, or other=20

works in wet places. This concrete was mixed by machinery, then put into im=
mense wooden=20

moulds, just as you make a loaf of sponge cake, Mrs. Blossom, where it was =
kept for several=20

weeks. These blocks weighed twenty tons each."  "Goodness! They were heavie=
r than Mrs.=20

Grimper's sponge cake!" exclaimed Mrs. Blossom.  "Considerably," laughed th=
e magnate. "The=20

solid contents of each were thirteen and a third cubic yards. How big a cub=
ic block would that=20

make in feet, young gentlemen? I hope you are not neglecting your mathemati=
cs for geography=20

and sight-seeing."  "About seven feet," replied Louis, after some mental fi=
guring.  "A little more=20

than that," added the professor.  "Seven feet is about the height of the ca=
bin of this ship, and one=20

of them would just stand up in it," continued Mr. Woolridge. "They made thi=
rty of them every day,=20

and twenty-five thousand were required."  "This is about as wonderful as th=
e immense work of the=20

ancient Egyptians," said Mrs. Belgrave.  "But all this labor was done by ma=
chinery. The moulds=20

were removed from the blocks, and they were exposed to the air in order to =
harden them more=20

effectually. They were then hoisted on peculiar boats, built for the purpos=
e, with an inclined deck,=20

from which they were slid into the sea. They made a tremendous splash when =
they were dumped=20

overboard; and it was a sight worth seeing if we had happened to be here tw=
enty-four years ago."=20

"It wasn't convaynient for some of us to be here at that time," said Felix.=
  "That is so, my broth of a=20

boy; but some things happened before you were born, as well as since."  "Su=
re, the pyramids=20

were built before your honor was barn."  "True for you; some things happene=
d before I was born,=20

and even before the twin cupids came into the world; for I believe they are=
 the oldest persons on=20

board," replied the magnate. "They kept dropping these tremendous blocks in=
to the sea till they=20

came nearly to the level, and then they built the walls as you see them now=
. I suppose you have=20

noticed that lighthouse on the little strip of land between the sea and Lak=
e Menzaleh. That is also=20

built of these artificial stones, and it is one hundred and sixty-four feet=
 high. It is provided with=20

electric lights, which are to be seen from a distance of twenty-four miles.=
 It is, therefore, one of the=20

largest in the world. I believe I have covered the ground now, and I won't =
say anything about Port=20

Said till we are moored in the grand basin."  "You have disposed of the _pi=
erres perdues_ very=20

nicely indeed, Mr. Woolridge," said the professor.  "Who are they?" asked t=
he magnate, who had=20

forgotten all the French he ever knew.  "Literally, 'lost stones,' as they =
were when they went=20

overboard; but that was what the French engineers called them."  "Now, ladi=
es and gentlemen, I=20

desire to invite you to the upper deck, where I wish to say something to yo=
u about the Land of=20

Goshen, and thus finish up Egypt, except the portion we shall have in view =
as we continue on our=20

voyage," said the commander rising from his seat.  The ladies were handed d=
own from the=20

promenade by the gallant gentlemen, though, unfortunately, there were not e=
nough of the former=20

to go round; but no one but the captain and Louis presumed to offer his ser=
vices to Mrs. Belgrave=20



or Miss Blanche. As the party approached the place where the conferences ha=
d usually been held,=20

they saw that a change had been made in the appearance of things.  The firs=
t novelty that=20

attracted their attention was the large map which was suspended on a frame =
rigged against the=20

mainmast. It was brilliant with colors, with all the streams, towns, and la=
kes, properly labelled,=20

upon it. A small table stood at the left, or port side, of it, covered with=
 a cloth, with a Bible and a=20

vase of flowers upon it. Chloe, the stewardess, had provided the latter fro=
m the pots which the=20

ladies had kept in the cabin since their visit to Bermuda.  On the deck a l=
arge carpet had been=20

spread out, and the thirteen arm-chairs had been placed in a semicircle, fa=
cing the map, with one=20

behind the table for the speaker for the occasion. As soon as the company h=
ad taken in this=20

arrangement for the educational feature of the voyage, they halted, and app=
lauded it with right=20

good-will.  "Please to be seated, ladies and gentlemen," said the commander=
, as he handed Mrs.=20

Belgrave to the chair on the right of the table; and at the same time he to=
ok his place behind the=20

table.  The party took their chairs according to their own fancies, and Mrs=
. Blossom managed to=20

get at the side of Felix. At one side stood Mr. Gaskette and the two sailor=
s who had assisted him=20

in his work. They had also arranged the meeting-place from the direction of=
 the captain. Some of=20

the tourists wondered what the commander meant to do in the face of all the=
se preparations. It=20

was not Sunday, or they would have come to=20


_
for wanting to be shown, Mr. Steuchfield. But I can assure you that the new=
 policy has come to=20

stay. I have the management behind me in this thing, and any day you'll com=
e down to the capital=20

I'll put my time against yours and try to show you that we are out for open=
 publicity and a square=20

deal for every man--including the railroad man."  "All right," was the cord=
ial reply. "I'll be down=20

along some of these days, and if you can convince me that McVickar isn't go=
ing into politics any=20

further than you've gone here to-night, I'll promise you to come back to Ca=
rnadine and tell the=20

boys the jig's up."  A few minutes later the branch train pulled out, and t=
he chairman and his=20

fellow-committeemen gave the departing joint-debater three cheers and anoth=
er. After the red tail-

lights of the train had disappeared around the first curve, Steuchfield tur=
ned to the others with a=20

broad grin.  "Well, boys," he said, "there goes a mighty nice young fellow,=
 and I guess we did it up=20

all right for him and accordin' to orders. I don't know any more'n a sheep =
what sort of a game Dave=20

Sage-brush is playin' this time, but whatever he says goes as she lays, and=
 I figure it that we gave=20

the young chip o' the old block a right jubilant little whirl. Anyhow, he s=
eemed to think so."  Blount=20

did not reach his office in the capital until the afternoon of the next day=
. There was an appalling=20

accumulation of letters and telegrams waiting to be worked over, but he let=
 the desk litter go=20

untouched and called up the hotel, only to have a small disappointment sent=
 in over the wire. His=20

father, Mrs. the Bible on the table pointed in this direction. As soon as t=
he party were seated the=20

commander opened the Good Book at a marked place.  "I see that some of you =
are surprised at=20

the altered appearance of our out-door hall," Captain Ringgold began. "I re=
gard the instructive=20

element of our voyage as one of the greatest importance; and if I were to f=
it out the ship again for=20

this cruise, I should provide an apartment on this deck for our conference =
meetings. But I have=20

done the best I could under the circumstances, with the assistance of Mr. G=
askette, the second=20

officer of the ship.  "I see also that the map before you has challenged yo=
ur attention," continued=20

the commander, who proceeded to explain in what manner he had caused the ma=
ps to be made.=20

"Mr. Gaskette has been my right-hand man in this work. He is not only a goo=
d navigator and a=20

thorough seaman, but he is a highly educated gentleman, a graduate of Harva=
rd College, a person=20

of artistic tastes, as you may have learned from your intercourse with him.=
 The map before you is=20

only one of three already completed, and the work is in progress upon sever=
al others."  The=20

company, including the ladies, received this explanation with generous appl=
ause, and all the boys=20

called for the subject of the captain's remarks. He was presented to them, =
and thanked the=20

commander for his kind words, and hoped the maps would prove to be useful i=
n the conferences.=20

"I will begin what I have to say about the Land of Goshen by reading a few =
verses from the first=20

chapter of Exodus: 'And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that=20


_
for Wartrace Hall some time during the forenoon, and there had been nothing=
 said in the clerk's=20

hearing about their return to the city. Blount hung up the receiver, called=
 it one more opportunity=20

missed, and sat down to attack the desk litter.  Almost the first thing his=
 eye lighted upon was a=20

stenographer's note stating that Mr. Hathaway, president of the Twin Buttes=
 Lumber Company,=20

had been in several times, and was very anxious to obtain an interview. Blo=
unt pressed the desk=20

button, and the stenographer came in promptly.  "This man Hathaway; what di=
d he want?" was the=20

brusque question shot at the clerk.  "I don't know. He said he was stopping=
 at the Inter-Mountain,=20

and he asked me to let him know when you got back."  "Phone him and tell hi=
m I'm here," said=20

Blount; and in due time the lumber magnate made his appearance.  It was not=
 at all in keeping=20

with Mr. Simon Peter Hathaway's gifts and adroitness that he should begin b=
y attempting a clumsy=20

bit of acting.  "Well, I'll be shot!" he exclaimed. "So you're the senator'=
s son, are you? If I'd known=20

that, that day on the train when you were trying to make me believe you wer=
e fruitful, and=20

increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the l=
and was filled with=20

them. Now there rose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And h=
e said unto his=20

people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier =
than we: come on, let us=20

deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when =
there falleth out any war,=20

they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up o=
ut of the land.=20

Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their bur=
dens. And they built for=20

Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ramses.'  "Ramses II. is generally rega=
rded as the Pharaoh=20

of the oppression, and doubtless the Israelites suffered a great deal of pe=
rsecution in his reign,"=20

the commander proceeded as he closed the Bible. "But the one who proposed i=
n the verse I have=20

read to 'get them up out of the land, was the successor of Ramses II., 'the=
 new king over Egypt,'=20

Merenptah, the son of Ramses, and now believed to be the Pharaoh of the Exo=
dus. He reigned=20

about 1325 years A.D.  "The Land of Goshen, where the Israelites=20


_
Blount's smile was neither forgiving nor hostile.  "In a way, I had earned =
what was handed out to=20

me afterward, Mr. Hathaway, and I'm not bearing malice," he said briefly. "=
I had no business to let=20

you get away with the wrong impression, but you were so exceedingly anxious=
 to identify me with=20

the Forest Service that it seemed a pity to disappoint you. Since your scou=
ndrels didn't kill me,=20

we'll set one incident against the part of Egypt, the whole of it lying to =
the east of the Damietta=20

branch of the Nile," continued the commander, using his pointer upon the ma=
p. "Through this=20

region then, as now, there were fresh-water canals, by which the country wa=
s made very=20

productive, and the people were very prosperous. The city of Ramses, built =
by the Israelites, was=20

doubtless the most important in Goshen. It is the ancient Tanis, the ruins =
of which are=20
