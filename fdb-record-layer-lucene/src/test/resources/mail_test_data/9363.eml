 year 1802, from a gentleman and a lady, both inhabitants of the town where=
 the person _
serious, half earnest, concerning the latest theory of an English physician=
 as to the prepotent=20

cause of insomnia and nervous disorders generally. It may be remembered tha=
t to the=20

abandonment of the night cap of our grandfathers (the cotton or flannel art=
icle, not the alcoholic)=20

was attributed the modern tendency of sleeplessness that make even a philos=
opher like Herbert=20

Spencer more or less of a crank. What I wanted, and wanted as the fellow di=
d his pistol in Texas,=20

was first-class slumber, just such unmitigated repose as occasionally comes=
 to a highly organized=20

baby, unvexed by colic or pure cussedness. I began to think that perhaps th=
at British doctor was=20

right, and that, if it were possible, I would return to the neglected custo=
m of my ancestors. Just at=20

that moment I plunged my hand into my coat pocket and pulled out a silk smo=
king-cap--a pretty=20

thing, wrought for me long ago by the dainty, delicate, deft fingers of one=
 who now rests in the=20

graveyard at Augusta. This cap was the very thing. I placed it reverently u=
pon my head, with an=20

act of faith, and lay down. The result was magical. Never since I was a boy=
 can I remember to=20

have experienced so perfect and delicious a repose. Not a dream rippled the=
 surface of my calm=20

brain, and I awakened hours afterward with a sense of satisfaction that mus=
t be a foretaste of=20

heaven itself. An incipient headache had vanished. Powers of mind that had =
been dulled were=20

restored to animation and keenness. Not a trace of irascibility remained; b=
ut in its place came=20

trooping the sweet angels that Father Faber says continually hover over the=
 good-humored man. I=20

declare that the metamorphosis was so complete that I almost needed an intr=
oduction to my new=20

self. And this prodigy was created by one grand, complete and unusual slumb=
er, when wearing a=20

nightcap! Subsequent experiments have been relatively successful; so I am g=
etting to be an=20

enthusiast on size as you proceed backward, till at 100 feet from the entra=
nce, it terminates. A=20

remarkable projection of the rock divides the back part into two stories. T=
his grotto, whose walls=20

are hung with ivy, and the bluff crowned with cedars, and surrounded by an =
aged forest, on which=20

the vine clambers most luxuriantly, viewed from the river which winds slowl=
y around it, and reflects=20

its image, is more than beautiful: it is even venerable. But what renders i=
t most interesting to many=20

visitors, is a number of rude paintings, which were, as tradition reports, =
left on it by the Cherokee=20

Indians. These Indians are known to have made this cave a resting-place, as=
 they passed up and=20

down the River Holston. These paintings are still distinct, though they hav=
e faded somewhat within=20

my remembrance. They consist of representations of the sun and moon, of a m=
an, of birds, fishes,=20

&c. They are all of red paint, and resemble in this respect, the paintings =
on Paint Rock near the=20

warm springs.  Much has been said of the objects of curiosity in the countr=
y north of us; and I took=20

the liberty to describe some of them in my preceding communication. Indeed =
we may say, without=20

danger of exaggeration, that the range of Alleghany Mountains presents a va=
riety of the most=20

curious features, and many objects of beauty and sublimity. I have noticed =
a few of the most=20

prominent, but "the half is not told."   _Extract of a Letter, &c._    _Kno=
xville, Nov. 24, 1818._  I was=20

on a visit to a friend a few days since, about 30 miles to the north of thi=
s, and was invited by him to=20

visit an interesting curiosity in the neighbourhood. We crossed the Clynch =
River where it is much=20

confined by mountains, and banks as high as mountains. Our guide conducted =
us to the foot of a=20

steep declivity, where we left our horses, and with some difficulty ascende=
d about 70 yards. Here=20

we came to the mouth of a cave which had been stopped up by a=20


_
freak of the imagination. Be it so. If a nightcap can extinguish my imagina=
tion at bed-time, thank=20

God for the discovery! My good old mother tells me that when I was a little=
 fellow she used to tie a=20

nightcap under my chin, and that I was a famous sleeper in those times. She=
 is a firm believer in=20

the efficacy. Likely enough if a man eats pickled pig's feet at midnight or=
 drinks unlimited whisky,=20

even a silk or harder than the stone itself. It is, without a doubt, artifi=
cial, for besides the evidence=20

afforded by its structure, it contains bones and animal remains.  What was =
this wall built for? There=20

was a tradition among the inhabitants that it contained money, and they wer=
e much disappointed=20

on opening it, not to find any. Like other caves, it contains a variety of =
calcareous concretions, and=20

I obtained some fine=20
