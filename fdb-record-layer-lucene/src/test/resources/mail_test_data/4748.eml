eloquence. From first to last the Kur-an is essentially a book to be heard, not read, but this is 

especially the case with the earliest chapters.  In the soorahs of the second period of Mekka we 

begin to trace the decline of the Prophet's eloquence. There are still the same earnest appeals to 

the people, the same gorgeous pictures of the Last Day and the world to come; but the language 

begins to approach the quiet of prose, the sentences become longer, the same words and phrases 

are frequently repeated, and the wearisome stories of the Jewish prophets and patriarchs, which 

fill so large a place in the later portion of the Kur-an, now make their appearance. The fierce 

passion of the earliest soorahs, that could not out save in short burning verses, gives place to a 

calmer more argumentative style. Mohammad appeals less to the works of God as proofs of his 

teaching, and more to the history of former teachers, and the punishments of the people who 

would not hear them. And the characteristic oaths of the first period, when Mohammad swears by 

all the varied sights of nature as they mirrored themselves in his imagination, have gone, and in 

their place we find only the weaker oath 'by the Kur-an.' And this declension is carried still further 

in the last group of the soorahs revealed at Mekka. The style becomes more involved and the 

sentences longer, and though the old enthusiasm bursts forth ever and anon, it is rather an echo 

of former things than a new and present intoxication of faith. The fables and repetitions become 

more and more dreary, and but for the rich eloquence of the old Arabic tongue, which gives some 

charm even to inextricable sentences and dull stories, the Kur-an at this period would be 

unreadable. As it is, we feel we have fallen the whole depth Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

conciliatory, then denunciatory, and exhortations to spread the faith, and such-like heterogeneous 

matters. Happily the Jewish stories disappear in the latest soorahs, but their place is filled by 

scarcely more palatable materials. The chapters of this period are interesting chiefly as containing 

the laws which have guided every Muslim state, regulated every Muslim society, and directed in 

their smallest acts every Mohammadan man and woman in all parts of the world from the 

Prophet's time till now. The Medina part of the Kur-an is the most important part for Islam, 

considered as a scheme of ritual and a system of manners; the earliest Mekka revelations are 

those which contain what is highest in a great religion and what was purest in a great man.  The 

word _Kur-an_ means the _crying_, _reciting_, _reading_, and is applied not only to the whole 

book, but to any chapter or section of it. The Kur-an is also called El-Furkan, 'the Distinguisher,' 

and El-Mushaf, 'the Volume,' and El-Kitab, 'the Book,' and Edh-Dhikr, 'the Admonition.' The Kur-an 

contains, in its ordinary form, 114 chapters (_soorahs_), 6616 verses (_ayat_, literally 'signs' or 

'wonders'), 77,934 words, and 323,671 letters, according to the estimates of laborious Muslim
