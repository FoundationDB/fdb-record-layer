This waste is growing worse year by year. Enough land could be reclaimed along the Kaskaskia, Little Wabash, Big Muddy, Saline, and Henderson to more than _
cut and tiles laid.  But it is said that this court decision follows the English Common law; and now 

being settled by a decision, it is not open for further consideration. In this progressive age nothing 

is settled until it is settled right. Judge Taney once judicially settled the status of the African race. 

The common law was held to forbid the bridging of navigable streams. Harbors could only be 

made where the water was salt and affected by the tides. The Dartmouth college decision was 

held to so cover railroad corporations as to shield them from legislative control. These have all 

been overturned by the march of events, and this Appellate court decision is not necessarily 

immortal. For fifty years the farmers of Illinois knew no such rule. The public flowers, that send 

forth the most grateful odours. Ascend one of the small hills, and you have a prospect as delightful 

as it is possible for the imagination to conceive. Far as the eye can carry you, a delightful country 

extends, through which numerous streams wind their serpentine courses, with groves and clumps 

of trees at intervals upon their banks. On one hand, at an immense distance, the small hills and 

groves are seen rising above the blue horizon; on the other, the view is pleasantly terminated by 

the wood on the low grounds skirting the river to which the smaller streams are tributary--while 

herds of buffalo, elk, deer, and other animals, are frequently seen slowly travelling to and from the 

watering-places, or grazing on the plains. The inhabited

improved by side ditches which dropped the water into the first depression. In 1873 there was 

placed in the road law a provision that a land owner may drain on the public road by giving timely 

notice, and this stands through all revisions. Blackstone in his commentaries does not class this 

kind of drainage as a nuisance or trespass to lower lands, but he does its opposite, where the 

lower man neglects to "scour" a ditch, and thus sets back the water to the harm of the upper man. 

If this court rule is common law, as claimed, then it may be further said that a rule for the dark 

ages when drainage was exceptional, is not necessarily the true the country present a prospect 

still more pleasing; around the margin of those extensive rich prairies, numerous habitations are 

seen, withdrawn a short distance in the wood, from the winter's cold and summer's heat--their 

finely cultivated fields lie in the prairies, which yield at once to the plough, without the previous 

Herculean labour of demolishing the forest. The area between the farms is a common of pasture 

to the numerous herds during the spring, summer, and autumn, and a small part mowed affords 

hay for the winter. The farmer who takes up his habitation in the neighbourhood of the prairies, 

has _many_ of the advantages of an 


_
good agriculture.  ACTION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.--Early in the last session, bills were 

introduced into each House to overturn this court decision. These were defeated, but late in the 

session there passed with much unanimity a bill of the following title, which became a law: "An act 

to permit owners of land to construct drains for agricultural purposes." Sec. 1 of this act reads as 

follows: "That the owner or owners of land in this State shall be permitted to construct drains for 

agricultural purposes, only, into any natural water-course or any natural depression whereby the 

water will be carried into any natural water-course, or any drain on the public highway, if the road 

commissioners consent thereto, for the purpose of securing proper drainage to such land, without 

being liable in damages therefor to any     ART. III. _Sketch of the Mineralogy and Geology of the 

Vicinity of Williams' College, Williamstown, Mass. By_ PROFESSOR DEWEY, _of Williams' 

College, in a letter to the Editor_.   The following sketch includes a space extending from Hoosack 

mountain on the east, to the State of New-York on the west, and a small distance into Vermont on 

the north. The accompanying map shows the relative situation of the streams, and the principal 

hills and mountains. The map is an enlarged copy of Carleton's map of this part of the state, with 

one or two corrections, which truth required. The latitude and longitude are probably not perfectly 

accurate.  [Illustration: A Geological MAP _of a part of Massachusetts on_ Connecticut River

was intended to establish the right of "individual drainage."  But we are told that the courts will not 

respect this law, for the reason that it seeks to legalize trespass.  Here we join issue with our 

objectors and stand by this declaratory law. It embodies the general opinion and practice of the 

people; it is plainly conformable to the physical laws of  Williams' College is situated in a valley, 

having on the west the hills of the _Taconick_[48] range; on the east, _Saddle Mountain_, which 

separates it for the most part from Adams; and on the north, and northeast, two hills which belong 

to the southwestern part of the range of the _Green Mountains_. _Hoosack River_, rising several

of civilization. Lands are held subject to laws thus grounded, and these considerations will not 

tolerate laws or decisions the very opposite.  These declarations are not much more radical than a 

declaration that we stand by the law of gravity as constitutional.  The public are busy in overturning 

this court decision by everywhere disregarding it. The few who stopped draining in deference to 

the court, have resumed under shelter of the statute. If all violators should be prosecuted with 

vigor, tile-making might decline, but courting would be lively. Courts and judges must be multiplied, 

and every lawyer in the State would have fat business for the next ten years. Some judge will soon 

give us a precedent in accordance with reason, of Williamstown, winds its course northwest, to the 

Hudson. It is an inconsiderable stream, about six rods in width, and its current is rapid. From the 

south, runs _Green River_, a smaller stream, and enters the Hoosack one mile northeast of the 

college. The _green_ colour of this stream, appears to be caused by a _magnesian_ clay, which is 

washed from its banks at the south part of the town. At the west is _Westbrook_, rising in 

Williamstown, and entering the Hoosack one mile and a half northwest of the college. The _soil_ in 

this whole tract is generally _clayey_, rather light for such a soil, and very rich. A gravelly soil 

appears in a few places, especially at the northern part. The _interval_ on the Hoosack extends

the matter as effectually as did one taste of the tree of knowledge reveal good and evil. It will soon 

be seen that individual interest is best promoted by general and free drainage--that presumption 

should be in its favor, and that one man should not be clothed with power to stop others from 

making improvements.  NEW LAWS.--The next legislative work on drainage should be to revise 

and consolidate the law. On some points the law is duplicate, and on one triplicate. It is generally 

demanded that the law shall be less cumbrous and more summary. This can be done to some 

extent when it shall be found that the courts favor drainage. So far they have had a very tender 

feeling for complaints. When drainage shall be acknowledged to be lawful, laudable, and 

necessary, like plowing, laws may and often much less, than half a mile, and presents the 

common appearances of _alluvial_ land. Rising from ten to twenty feet above this interval, the soil 

is in various places filled with rolled stones of quartz and limestone, as if the Hoosack had once 

been much above the banks which confine it at present. It is not improbable that its waters were 

formerly intercepted by the hills in Pownal, five miles at the northwest, forming a small lake in this 

valley.  The hills of the _Taconick_ range, (A[49]) on which passes the line between 

Massachusetts and New-York, have generally an elevation from twelve hundred to fourteen 

hundred feet; _Pownal Mountain_ (B) on the north, about fourteen hundred; and _Oak hill_ (D) on 

the northeast, twelve hundred feet above the east college (C.) _Saddle

simplified and made more effectual.  RIVER DISTRICTS.--Illinois being generally level, many of 

our inland streams waste a large amount of land by overflow and drift. Roads, crops, and bridges 

are insecure. To a large extent this may be remedied by straightening the channels, and hereafter 

keeping them in repair and clear of drift wood. If the lands along these rivers, which would receive 

benefits from this work, were made into a district and classified according to benefits, the burden 

on them Mountain_ (EF) is an insulated mass, separated from the Taconick range by the valley of 

Williamstown, and from Hoosack Mountain, by the valley in Adams. It lies about south southwest, 

and is nearly eight miles in length, and two in breadth. It is composed of two ranges, the eastern 

and highest (FG) being in Adams. The mountain has its name from two of its peaks, which present 

at a distance the appearance of the two elevations of a _saddle_. The west range (E) is divided
