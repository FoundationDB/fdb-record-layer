philodendron monstera as guests of their chief; this etiquette of the Arabs=
 consists in galloping singly at full speed across the line of advance, the=

tte of the Arabs consists in galloping singly at full speed across the line=
 of advance, the rider flourishing the sword over his head, and at the obli=
gation.  The party at the Russian consulate had gone on a grand expedition =
to the Dead Sea, and had been absent for many days from Jerusalem. They wer=
e conveyed by one of the sheiks _
among some shady mimosas, while I sent Mahomet to Abou Sinn with the letter=
, and my firman.  I=20

was busily engaged in making sundry necessary arrangements in the tent, whe=
n Mahomet=20

returned, and announced the arrival of the great sheik in person. He was at=
tended by several of=20

his principal people, and as he approached through the bright green mimosas=
, mounted upon a=20

beautiful snow-white hygeen, I was exceedingly struck with his venerable an=
d dignified=20

appearance. Upon near arrival I went forward to meet him, and to assist him=
 from his camel; but=20

his animal knelt immediately at his command, and he dismounted with the eas=
e and agility of a=20

man of twenty.  He was the most magnificent specimen of an Arab that I have=
 ever seen. Although=20

upwards of eighty years of age, he was as erect as a lance, and did not app=
ear more than=20

between fifty and sixty; he was of Herculean stature, about six feet three =
inches high, with=20

immensely broad shoulders and chest; a remarkably arched nose; eyes like an=
 eagle, beneath=20

large, shaggy, but perfectly white eyebrows; a snow-white beard of great th=
ickness descended=20

below the middle of his breast. He wore a large white turban, and a white c=
ashmere abbai, or long=20

robe, from the throat to the ankles. As a desert patriarch he was superb, t=
he very perfection of all=20

that the imagination could paint, if we would personify Abraham at the head=
 of his people. This=20

grand old Arab with the greatest politeness insisted upon our immediately a=
ccompanying him to=20

his camp, as he could not allow us to remain in his country as know how it =
is=E2=80=94I suppose there is=20

so much to be seen here=E2=80=94but I never seem to have a moment to myself=
. I have got an=20

engagement now to the consulate. We are going to Elisha=E2=80=99s Fountain =
to-day. Why do not you=20

come?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I am engaged too,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=
=80=9CI have settled to go to the Tombs of the Kings to-

day, with Signor Paraclete, and I cannot well get off; but remember the let=
ters.=E2=80=9D  The box of letters=20

arrived at Lothair=E2=80=99s rooms in due season, and their perusal deeply =
interested him. In their pages,=20

alike earnest and lively, and a picture of a mind of high intelligence ador=
ned with fancy and feeling,=20

the name of Lothair frequently appeared, and sometimes accompanied with exp=
ressions that=20

made his heart beat. All the rumors of his adventures, as they gradually ar=
rived in England,=20

generally distorted, were duly chronicled, and sometimes with comments, whi=
ch intimated the=20

interest they occasioned to the correspondent of Bertram. More than once sh=
e could not refrain=20

from reproaching her brother for having left his friend so much to himself.=
 =E2=80=9COf all your friends,=E2=80=9D she=20

said, =E2=80=9Cthe one who always most interested me, and seemed most worth=
y of your affection.=E2=80=9D And=20

then she deplored the absolute ruin of Lothair, for such she deemed his ent=
rance into the Roman=20

Church.  =E2=80=9CI was right in my appreciation of that woman, though I wa=
s utterly inexperienced in life,=E2=80=9D=20

thought Lothair. =E2=80=9CIf her mother had only favored my views two years=
 ago, affairs would have been=20

different. Would they have been better? Can they be worse? But I have gaine=
d experience.=20

gave orders to Mahomet to have the baggage repacked and the tents removed, =
while we were=20

requested to mount two superb white hygeens, with saddle-cloths of blue Per=
sian sheep-skins,=20

that he had immediately accoutred when he heard from Mahomet of our miserab=
le camels. The=20

tent was struck, and we joined our venerable host with a line of wild and s=
plendidly-mounted=20

attendants, who followed us towards the sheik's encampment.   CHAPTER VI.  =

 duties of my=20

position at home=E2=80=94dear home? Perhaps not. And suppose I never had ga=
ined experience, I still=20

might have been happy? And what am I now? Most lone and sad. So lone and sa=
d that nothing=20

but the magical influence of the scene around me saves me from an overwhelm=
ing despondency.=E2=80=9D=20

Lothair passed his life chiefly with Paraclete, and, a few weeks after thei=

her. We had ridden=20

about two miles, when we were suddenly met by a crowd of mounted men, armed=
 with the usual=20

swords and shields; many were on horses, others upon hygeens, and all drew =
up in lines parallel=20

with our approach. These were Abou Sinn's people, who had assembled to  The=
 month of May=20

had disappeared, and June was advancing. Bertram and Saint Aldegonde no lon=

their pair, and their engagements in the House of Commons. There seemed a t=

between them to avoid the subject; remarkable on the part of Bertram, for h=
