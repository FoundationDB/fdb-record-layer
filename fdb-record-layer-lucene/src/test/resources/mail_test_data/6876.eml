Then the Lady Anyse, who lives now at that villa, may be your own far-off c=
ousin."  "She may be,=20

indeed," mused the Red King. "What like is she, Harold?"  "She is tall, and=
 handsome, and has red=20

hair like Your Majesty," said Harold. "I have seen her often when I went to=
 visit the Garden."  "The=20

Garden?" exclaimed Red Rex. "Does the Wonder-Garden, then, still exist?"  "=
Not quite the same=20

as in the day of Gerda and Cedric," answered Harold, "but yet a wonder-gard=
en. It is called 'The=20

Aquarium' now, and is one of the public gardens of Kisington, given to the =
town by the will of=20

Cedric and Gerda. The Lady Anyse has it under her care."  "Verily, I should=
 like to visit it and see=20

both its wonders and my long-lost cousin," muttered the Red King.  "What a =
pity that you are=20

making war upon our city!" exclaimed Harold. "There are so many fine things=
 that cannot be while=20

there is war."  "Yet war must be," answered Red Rex. "And I must be at it s=
traightway." He rose=20

and flourished his sword with a determined air.  "But at least you will spa=
re the east of Kisington,=20

where the Wonder-Garden lay, and not fire gums or arrows in that direction?=
" suggested Harold,=20

pointing eastward. The Red King followed the direction of his finger.  "Yes=
, that I will promise," said=20

Red Rex, after a moment's hesitation. "I promise that; lest otherwise I mig=
ht injure my own blood=20

royal. Because I am King I must not forget that!" He swelled his chest prou=
dly.  "_Noblesse=20

oblige_!" murmured Harold. "It was the motto of the Lion Passant."  "I know=
 that motto well; and=20

what of a lion passant?" inquired Red Rex. "A lion passant is one of the em=
blems in my own royal=20

coat of arms!"  "Then, Your Majesty has not heard the tale of the Lion Pass=
ant?" asked Harold,=20

feigning surprise. "It is one of the best known in our land. You will find =
your royal lion in the arms of=20

our city of Derrydown; and there is a tale to account for that."  Harold be=
gan to smile as if the=20

memory of the tale pleased him.  Red Rex frowned. "It is too late to hear t=
hat tale to-night," he=20

murmured.  "Yes, Your Majesty," agreed Harold. "Besides, I cannot tell it b=
y heart. I should have to=20

get the book from our generous library. I can read it better; there is so m=
uch in the manner of  But=20

Lady Veriphast had put me on the right track: why, I thought as I scrambled=
 back again from my=20

brougham across the wet pavement to my bay-window, should I not begin at on=
ce to write about=20

the civilisation of the day? 'The Civilisation of the British Isles, as exh=
ibited in Piccadilly, a=20

Fragment of Contemporaneous Biography,' that would not be a bad title; peop=
le would think, if I=20

called it a biography, it must be true; here I squared my elbows before a q=
uantity of foolscap,=20

dipped my pen in the ink, and dashed off the introduction as above.  Next m=
orning I got up and=20

began again as follows: Why should I commit the ridiculous error of supposi=
ng that the incidents of=20

my daily life are not likely to interest the world at large? Whether I read=
 the diary of Mr Pepys, or of=20

Lady Morgan--whether I wade through the Journal of Mr Evelyn, or pleasantly=
 while away an hour=20

with the memoirs of "a Lady of Quality," I am equally struck with this trad=
itional practice of the=20

bores and the wits of society, to write at length the records of their dail=
y life, bottle them carefully=20

up in a series of MS. volumes, and leave them to their grandchildren to pub=
lish, and to posterity to=20

criticise. Now it has always appeared to me that the whole fun of writing w=
as to watch the=20

immediate effect produced by one's own literary genius. If, in addition to =
this, it is possible to=20

interest the public in the current events of one's life, what nobler object=
 of ambition could a man=20

propose to himself? Thus, though the circle of my personal acquaintances ma=
y not be increased, I=20

shall feel my sympathies are becoming enlarged with each succeeding mark of=
 confidence I=20

bestow upon the numerous readers to whom I will recount the most intimate r=
elations of my life. I=20

will tell them of my aspirations and my failures--of my hopes and fears, of=
 my friends and my=20



enemies. I shall not shrink from alluding to the state of my affections; an=
d if the still unfulfilled story=20

of my life becomes involved with the destiny of others, and entangles itsel=
f in an inextricable=20

manner, that is no concern of mine. I shall do nothing to be ashamed of, or=
 that I can't tell; and if=20

truth turn out stranger than fiction, so much the better for my readers. It=
 may be that I=20


_
Majesty is in such a hurry to fight, or I might bring that book hither to-m=
orrow and read you the=20

pleasant tale."  The Red King fidgeted. "I am losing time at a terrible rat=
e!" he growled. "Think of=20

what harm I might be doing! When have I wasted hours like this, you wheedli=
ng boy?"  "I do not=20

think these hours are wasted. It is war that wastes," said Harold.  "Fudge!=
" retorted Red Rex; "we=20

must have war. Was that lion a red lion, Harold?"  "A red lion, Your Majest=
y," nodded Harold.  The=20

Red King grew excited. "I must, then, hear about him!" he cried. "It is my =
duty.--What ho, there!"=20

he shouted to his men who were making ready to continue the siege. "I have =
changed my mind.=20

We will not fight for another day. for the future looks vague and complicat=
ed enough; but it is much=20

better to make the world my friend before anything serious occurs, than all=
ow posterity to misjudge=20

my conduct when I am no longer alive to explain it. Now, at least, I have t=
he satisfaction of=20

knowing that whatever happens I shall give my version of the story first. S=
hould the daily tenor of=20

my life be undisturbed, I can always fall back upon the exciting character =
of my opinions.  As I=20

write, the magnitude of the task I propose to myself assumes still larger p=
roportions. I yearn to=20

develop in the world at large those organs of conscientiousness and benevol=
ence which we all=20

possess but so few exercise. I invoke the cooperation of my readers in=20


_
truce until he returns to us."  "Your Majesty is wise," said Harold with sh=
ining eyes. "I think you will=20

not be sorry to hear the tale of the Lion Passant."  So the crisis was dela=
yed for another day; and=20

Kisington blessed Harold. They made a feast at the poor widow's cottage fro=
m presents sent by=20

the Leading Citizens. Richard and Robert sat at the head of the table, one =
on each side of Harold,=20

and all his other boy and girl friends sat down the sides of the table, and=
 he told them all about his=20

adventure with the besieging King. One and all begged him to let them go wi=
th him on the=20

following day. But this, of course, Harold could not promise. He was the on=
ly one who could read=20

well enough to charm I implore them to accompany me step by step in the cru=
sade which I am=20

about to preach in favour of the sacrifice of self for the public good. I d=
emand their sympathy in=20

this monthly record of my trials as an uncompromising exponent of the motiv=
es of the day, and I=20

claim their tender solicitude should I writhe, crushed and mangled by the i=
ron hand of a social=20

tyranny dexterously concealed in its velvet glove. I will begin my efforts =
at reform with the Church;=20

I may then possibly diverge to the Legislature, and I will mix in the highe=
st circles of society in the=20

spirit of a missionary. I will endeavour to show everybody up to everybody =
else in the spirit of love;=20

and if they end by quarrelling with=20
