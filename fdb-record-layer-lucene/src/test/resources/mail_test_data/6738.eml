philodendron monstera his victim and charged furiously at the newcomer, whi=
le Black Bruin limped painfully into the bushes, feeling that he had found =
out something about the genus moose that it was well to remember.  He did n=
ot fully recover from his mauling until he went into winter quarters.  The =
following spring when Black Bruin came forth from hibernation, he made a tr=
ip to a distant lake where It is disgusting, heart-rending; sometimes I fea=
r my own energies are waning. My health is wretched; writing and speaking a=
re decidedly bad for me, and I pass my life in writing and speaking. Toward=
 evening I feel utterly exhausted, and am sometimes, which I thought I neve=
r could be, the victim of despondency. The loss of the doctor was a severe =
blow, but they hurried him out of philodendron monstera his victim and char=

bushes, feeling that he had found out something about the genus moose that =

 sometimes, which I thought I never could be, the victim of despondency. Th=
e loss of the doctor was a severe blow, but they hurried him out of _
beechnuts, when he noticed the herd passing at a distance.  The two cows an=
d the calves were=20

apparently alone, and one of the calves was straggling far behind the rest.=
  For several days the=20

blood-lust had been strong upon Black Bruin, and here was his opportunity. =
 So he began stalking=20

the calf warily.  The wind was in his favor and in half an hour he had work=
ed around within striking=20

distance.  He first peered all about to see that the bull was not in sight,=
 and then made a sudden=20

rush upon the calf.  But awkward as it looked, the calf was agile, and near=
ly eluded him, merely=20

receiving a raking blow across the shoulder, where Black Bruin had intended=
 to break its neck.=20

Terrified and stung with excruciating pain, it ran hither and thither, blea=
ting and making a great=20

outcry.  But Black Bruin was not the hunter to let his prey get away if he =
could help it, so he=20

pursued the calf hotly and soon landed another blow that stretched it upon =
the ground.  He was so=20

intent upon his own silvered the clustering of his raven hair; but intellec=
tual power reigned in his=20

wide brow, while determination was the character of the rest of his counten=
ance, under great=20

control, yet apparently, from the dark flashing of his eye, not incompatibl=
e with fanaticism.=20

=E2=80=9CGeneral,=E2=80=9D he exclaimed, =E2=80=9Cyour presence always rean=
imates me. I shall at least have some news=20

on which I rely. Your visit is sudden=E2=80=94sudden things are often happy=
 ones. Is there any thing=20

stirring in the promised land? Speak, speak! You have a thousand things to =
say, and I have a=20

thousand ears.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy dear Mirandola,=E2=80=9D replied the v=
isitor, =E2=80=9CI will take leave to call into council a=20

friend whose presence is always profitable.=E2=80=9D  So saying, he took ou=
t a cigar-case, and offered it to=20

his companion.  =E2=80=9CWe have smoked together in palaces,=E2=80=9D said =
Mirandola, accepting the proffer with=20

a delicate white hand.  =E2=80=9CBut not these cigars,=E2=80=9D replied the=
 general. =E2=80=9CThey are superb, my only=20

reward for all my transatlantic work, and=20


_
he did not notice the cyclone bearing down upon him.  Suddenly the broad-an=
tlered monster was=20

above him, striking with terrible cutting hoofs, which ploughed deep furrow=
s in his shaggy coat and=20

cut deeper gashes.  Almost before he knew it, he had been knocked down and =
was rapidly being=20

trampled to death.  The only thing that protected him was his fat.  He was =
so rotund and so=20

covered with thick layers of fat, that he slipped about under the fearful c=
utting hoofs.  He struck out=20

viciously, laying open one of the bull's forelegs, but without avail.  In a=
nother minute his fate would=20

have been sealed, had not a deliverer come at the right second.  Suddenly, =
from out the bushes=20

near at hand, charged another bull moose, bellowing frightfully as he came.=
  He was not coming=20

primarily to Black Bruin's assistance, but to do battle with the first bull=
.  One of the cows by right=20

was his, and he proposed to claim his rights, and battle for them like the =
knights of old.  Hearing=20

the challenge one.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd Jenny shall give us a capital cup=
 of coffee,=E2=80=9D said Mirandola; =E2=80=9Cit is the only=20

hospitality that I can offer my friends. Give me a light, my general; and n=
ow, how are things?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CWell, at the first glance, very bad; the French have left Rome, an=
d we are not in it.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, that is=20

an infamy not of today or yesterday,=E2=80=9D replied Mirandola, =E2=80=9Ct=
hough not less an infamy. We talked=20

over this six months ago, when you were over here about something else, and=
 from that moment=20

unto the present I have with unceasing effort labored to erase this stigma =
from the human=20

consciousness, but with no success. Men are changed; public spirit is extin=
ct; the deeds of =E2=80=9848 are=20

to the present generations as incomprehensible as the Punic wars, or the fe=
ats of Marius against=20

the Cimbri. What we want are the most natural things in the world, and easy=
 of attainment=20

because they are natural. We want our metropolis, our native frontiers, and=
 true liberty. Instead of=20

these, we have compromises,=20
