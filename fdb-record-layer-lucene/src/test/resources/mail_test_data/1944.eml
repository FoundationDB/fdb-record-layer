whom she could not see, but whom she hated and feared as she would Satan hi=
mself--now=20

covered her face and throat.  After that she remembered nothing more. Consc=
iousness mercifully=20

forsook her altogether. When she recovered her senses, she was within the p=
recincts of the=20

castle: a confused murmur of voices reached her ears, and her father's arms=
 were round her.=20

Gradually she distinguished what was being said: she gathered the threads o=
f the story which=20

Jean-Marie and the postilion and outriders were hastily unravelling in resp=
onse to M. le duc's=20

commands.  These men of course knew nothing of the poignant little drama wh=
ich had been=20

enacted inside the coach. All they knew was that they had been surrounded b=
y a rough crowd--a=20

hundred or so strong--who brandished scythes and spades, that they had made=
 valiant efforts to=20

break through the crowd by whipping up their horses, but that suddenly some=
 of those devils more=20

plucky than the others seized the horses by their bits and rendered poor Je=
an-Marie quite=20

helpless. He thought then that all would be up with the lot of them and was=
 thinking of scrambling=20

down from his box in order to protect Mademoiselle with his body, and the p=
istols which he had in=20

the boot, when happily for every one concerned, he heard in the distance--a=
bove the clatter which=20

that abominable rabble was making, the hurried tramp of horses. At once he =
jumped to the=20

conclusion that these could be none other than a company of soldiers sent b=
y M. le duc. This=20

spurred him to a fresh effort, and gave him a new idea. To Carmail the post=
ilion who had a pistol in=20

his holster he gave the peremptory order to fire a shot into the air or int=
o the crowd, Jean-Marie=20

cared not which. This Carmail did, and at once the horses, already maddened=
 by the crowd,=20

plunged and reared wildly, shaking themselves free. Jean-Marie, however, ha=
d them well in hand,=20

and from far away there came the cries of encouragement from the advancing =
horsemen who=20

were bearing down on them full tilt. The next moment there was a general me=
lee. Jean-Marie saw=20

nothing save his horses' heads, but the outriders declared that men were tr=
ampled down like flies=20

all around, while others vanished into the night.  What happened after that=
 none of the men knew=20

or cared. Jean-Marie galloped his horses all the way to the castle and neve=
r drew rein until the=20

precincts were reached.   VI  Had M. de Kernogan had his way and a free han=
d to mete out=20

retributive justice in the proportion that he desired, there is no doubt th=
at the hangman of Nantes=20

would have been kept exceedingly busy. As it was a number of arrests were e=
ffected the following=20

day--half the manhood of the countryside was implicated in the aborted _Jac=
querie_ and the city=20

prison was not large enough to hold it all.  A court of justice presided ov=
er by M. le duc, and=20

composed of half a dozen men who were directly or indirectly in his employ,=
 pronounced summary=20

sentences on the rioters which were to have been carried out as soon as the=
 necessary=20

arrangements for such wholesale executions could be made. Nantes was turned=
 into a city of=20

wailing; peasant-women--mothers, sisters, daughters, wives of the condemned=
, trooped from their=20

villages into the city, loudly calling on M. le duc for mercy, besieging th=
e improvised court-house,=20

the prison gates, the town residence of M. le duc, the palace of the bishop=
: they pushed their way=20

into the courtyards and the very corridors of those buildings--flunkeys cou=
ld not cope with them--

they fought with fists and elbows for the right to make a direct appeal to =
the liege-lord who had=20

power of life and death over their men.  The municipality of Nantes held al=
oof from this distressful=20

state of he could possibly squeeze out of the store-keeper, bundled up the =
whole, made many=20

solemn protestations of gratitude and honest intentions, and went off to ch=
eer Slowfoot with the=20

news of his success.  It chanced that Antoine Dechamp, the very man about w=
hom he had been=20



talking to Duncan McKay, had dropped in to see him and his spouse, and was =
sitting beside the=20

fire smoking when he entered.  Displaying his possessions with much pride, =
he assured Dechamp=20

that he had paid for the whole outfit, and meant to return in the spring a =
rich man with means=20

enough to buy a horse and cart, and start with the buffalo-hunters for the =
plains.  "You have a=20

horse to sell--they say?" he remarked to his friend in a careless way.  "Ye=
s--and a good one too,"=20

answered Dechamp.  "Well, if you will loan him to me in the spring, I will =
pay for him when I come=20

back.  It takes all I have to fit me out to start, you see."  Dechamp did n=
ot quite see his way to that-

-but there was plenty of time to think over it!  "Have you heard," said Dec=
hamp, willing to change=20

the subject, "there is some talk that Perrin has been killed?  George McDer=
mid was out, like many=20

others, huntin' about for the starvin' people, an' he came across the wives=
 of Blanc and Pierre--

poor things! they're widows now, for Blanc and Pierre are both dead.  Well,=
 the women had well-

nigh given in. I had dropped down, they were so tired, and were crawlin' on=
 their hands and knees=20

when McDermid found them.  I didn't hear all the outs and ins of it, but th=
ere is no doubt that poor=20

Perrin has been murdered, for he was shot right through the breast."  "Perh=
aps he shot hisself,"=20

suggested La Certe.  "No--that could not be, for the women have brought his=
 coat, which shows=20

that the ball went in at the breast and came _straight_ out at the back. If=
 he had shot himself he=20

must have pulled the trigger with his toe, an' then the ball would have sla=
nted up from his breast to=20

somewhere about his shoulders."  "It was a Saulteaux, may be," said Slowfoo=
t, who had been=20

listening with all the eagerness of a gossip.  "There were no marks of Reds=
kins' snow-shoes=20

about," returned Dechamp, "an' the tracks were too confused to make them ou=
t.  A knife was=20

found, but there were no marks about it to tell who owned it--only it was a=
 settler's knife, but there=20

are lots of them about, an' many have changed hands since the settlers came=
."  At the time we=20

write of, the colony of Red River of the north was in a very unhappy and di=
sorganised condition.=20

There were laws indeed, but there was no authority or force sufficiently st=
rong to apply the laws,=20

and discord reigned because of the two great fur companies--the Hudson's Ba=
y, and the Nor'-

West--which opposed each other with extreme bitterness, carrying fire-water=
, dissension, and=20

disaster all over the wilderness of Rupert's Land.  Happily the two compani=
es coalesced in the=20

year 1821, and from that date, onward, comparative peace has reigned under =
the mild sway of the=20

Hudson's Bay Company.  But at the period which we describe the coalition ha=
d not taken place,=20

and many of the functionaries of the Hudson's Bay Company in Red River, fro=
m the Governor=20

downward, seem to have been entirely demoralised, if we are to believe the =
reports of=20

contemporary historians.  Some time previous to this, the Earl of Selkirk--=
chiefly from philanthropic=20

views, it is said--resolved to send a colony to Red River. At different tim=
es bands of Scotch, Swiss,=20

Danes, and others, made their appearance in the Settlement.  They had been =
sent out by the=20

agents of the Earl, but there was a great deal of mismanagement and misunde=
rstanding, both as=20

to the motives and intentions of the Earl. The result was that the=20


_
things, and the town councillors, the city functionaries and their families=
 shut themselves up in=20

their houses in order to avoid being a witness to the heartrending scenes w=
hich took place=20

uninterruptedly round the court-house and the prison. The mayor himself was=
 powerless to=20

interfere, but it is averred that he sent a secret courier to Paris to M. d=
e Mirabeau, who was known=20

to be a personal friend of his, with a detailed account of the said, by the=
 Nor'-West Company--

received the newcomers with suspicion and ill-will.  The Indians followed t=
he lead of the half-

breeds, to whom they were allied.  Not only was every sort of obstruction t=
hrown in the way of the=20

unfortunate immigrants, but more than once during those first years they we=
re driven from the=20

colony, and their homesteads were burned to the ground.  There must have be=
en more than the=20

usual spirit of indomitable=20


_
reprisal contemplated by M. le duc de Kernogan, together with an earnest re=
quest that pressure=20

from the highest possible quarters be brought to bear upon His Grace so tha=
t he should abate=20

something of his vengeful rigours.  Poor King Louis, who in these days was =
being terrorised by the=20

National Assembly and swept opposition and hardship they had to endure, the=
y returned again=20

and again to their farms, rebuilt their dwellings, cultivated their fields,=
 and, so to speak, compelled=20

prosperity to smile on them--and that, too, although several times the powe=
rs of Nature, in the=20

shape of grass hoppers and disastrous floods,=20
