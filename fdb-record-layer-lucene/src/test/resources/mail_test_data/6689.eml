articles; for butter is not known in Manila, and there is very little use o=
f milk there. The Manilans=20

doubtless find less difficulty (for in that climate people are very fond of=
 repose) in using pork fat in=20

their food than in rearing and keeping cattle and making butter. This sort =
of food, joined to the heat=20

and the great humidity of that country, occasions serious dysentery in many=
 persons." He adds (p.=20

123): "The venereal disease (or 'French disease,' as they call it, I know n=
ot why), is very common=20

there [in Manila]; but they do not die from it; the great heat and copious =
perspiration enable people=20

to live at Manila with this malady, they marry without being frightened at =
it, and the evil passes by=20

inheritance to their children; it is a sort of heritage with which but few =
European families are not=20

stained."--Eds.  [40] Le Gentil thus speaks of the placer-mining practiced =
by the Indians in Luzon=20

(Voyage, ii, p. 32): "It is true that this sort of life shortens the days o=
f these wretched people; as=20

they are perpetually in the water, they swell, and soon as we approached th=
e foot of the mountain=20

range, became exchanged for boulders and loose shale, which rendered walkin=
g most tedious,=20

and played the very mischief with our boots.  Here even this track seemed, =
to our eyes, to die out;=20

but Lizzie led the way confidently, and evidently with a thorough knowledge=
 of what she was=20

about.  We had now been walking for more than three hours, and had apparent=
ly only got half way=20

up a kind of gorge in the mountains, which seemed to become gradually narro=
wer and narrower,=20

and from all appearances afforded every prospect of terminating in a 'cul-d=
e-sac'. A watercourse=20

must at some period have run down this ravine, for the boulders were rounde=
d; but it was now=20

quite dry.  As the sides of the mountains drew nearer, our path led along t=
his watercourse, and the=20

walking became dreadfully fatiguing.  The boulders were sometimes so close =
as to render walking=20

between impossible, and then it became necessary to clamber over them, whic=
h, loaded as we=20

were, was very painful.  If, on the other hand, we attempted to journey on =
the=20


_
the friars say that it is their experience that the Indians who lead that s=
ort of life have no inclination=20

to follow the Christian life, and that they give much trouble to the minist=
ers of God who instruct=20

them. Despite that, it is to the friars and to the alcaldes that these Indi=
ans sell their gold."--Eds.=20

[41] In his "Non-Christian Tribes of Northern Luzon," Worcester calls atten=
tion to the various=20

indefinite modes of of unequal heights, but sometimes so wide apart, that a=
 good spring was=20

requisite to get from one to the other.  Lizzie was the only one of the par=
ty who appeared=20

thoroughly at home; her light figure bounded from rock to rock with the gre=
atest ease and rapidity.=20

Even Cato and Ferdinand, barefooted as they were, seemed to be a long way f=
rom enjoying=20

themselves, and for us wretched Europeans, with our thick boots, that=20


_
among ethnological writers, and proposes (p. 803) the following definition =
as a means of securing=20

clearness and accuracy therein: "A division of a race composed of an aggreg=
ate of individuals of a=20

kind and of a common origin, agreeing among themselves in, and distinguishe=
d from their=20

congeners by, physical characteristics, dress, and ornaments; the nature of=
 the communities=20

which they form; peculiarities of house architecture; methods of hunting, f=
ishing, and carrying on=20

agriculture; rounded shoulders of the rocks, in a way that was anything but=
 pleasant.  Thus we=20

scrambled along for another hour, at the expiration of which we could only =
see a blank wall of=20

mountain before us, up which it would have been both impossible and useless=
 to climb.=20

Wondering where the deuce Lizzie was leading us, we blundered along until w=
e arrived at the=20

base of the perpendicular cliff, and saw that by some convulsion of nature =
the ravine now=20

branched off at a right angle to the left,=20
