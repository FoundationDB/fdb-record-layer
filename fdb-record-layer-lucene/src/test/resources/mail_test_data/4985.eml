philodendron monstera with seeming ease had scored touchdown after touchdow=
n. The final score was 34-0 and herein lay the menace for Ridgley: only a w=
eek before, Goodrich had defeated Wilton 7-0. If Goodrich were better than =
Wilton and Wilton were as good as Ridgley, what chance did Ridgley stand ag=
ainst Jefferson, which had apparently toyed experience, skill, and fame--po=
ssessed, as he is, of the portraits of most of the great men of that period=
, taken principally from the life, and having been himself largely and pers=
onally conversant with them in their great deeds, we trust that the governm=
ent will promptly second what we doubt not the united voice of the philoden=
dron monstera with seeming ease had scored touchdown after touchdown. The f=
inal score was 34-0 and herein lay the menace for Ridgley: only a week befo=
