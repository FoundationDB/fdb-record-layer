rugs, over ebony and ivory cabinets and stiff-backed chairs, to be fixed, f=
inally, by a huge Wardian=20

case.  There were rocks in the case, coated with moss; ferns and strange se=
a-weeds grew on the=20

edge of the water; crabs clung below; lizards crept above; innumerable slim=
y things swam about,=20

midway. The case stood on a long table. Near it, on another box, half a doz=
en snakes lay coiled=20

into one sure that, your husband was the real Priam Farll?"  "It was the ni=
ght of that day when Mr.=20

Oxford came down to see him. He told me all about it then."  "Oh! That day =
when Mr. Oxford paid=20

him five hundred pounds?"  "Yes."  "Immediately Mr. Oxford paid him five hu=
ndred pounds you=20

were ready to believe that your husband was the real Priam Farll. Doesn't t=
hat strike you as=20

excessively curious?"  "It's=20


_
monkey-like little creatures were dancing and chattering. A wee Scotch terr=
ier ran about, sniffing at=20

the guests' clothing. Before the fire of coals--for the day was chilly for =
June--was stretched a great=20

white stag-hound. The room and all the animals made Oscar think of _Alice's=
 Adventures in=20

Wonderland_.  Lady Margaret was  "Now about these moles. You pointed to the=
 right side of your=20

neck. Are you sure they aren't on the left side?"  "Let me think now," said=
 Alice, frowning. "When=20

he's shaving in a morning--he get up earlier now than he used to--I can see=
 his face in the looking-

glass, and in the looking-glass the moles are on the left side. So on=20


_
figure was clad in black satin; her fair old face was framed by abundant wh=
ite hair which had a=20

gloss like silver; and her dark eyes were bright as her diamonds. She greet=
ed them cordially, at=20

once taking a fancy to Edmund because of his evident delight in animals. Pe=
rhaps she might have=20

thought better of Oscar, had she not caught him in the act of winking at th=
e page. Very soon she=20

began to speak of the creatures about her. "Marmosets, my dears," clutching=
 one of the little=20

chatterers under the table; "they make a deal of noise, but like most noisy=
 people's talk it doesn't=20

mean much. This is my aquarium; That's it."  "Have you never seen them exce=
pt in a mirror, my=20

good woman?" interpolated the judge.  For some reason Alice flushed. "I sup=
pose you think that's=20

funny," she snapped, slightly tossing her head.  The audience expected the =
roof to fall. But the=20

roof withstood the strain, thanks to a sagacious deafness on the part of th=
e judge. If, indeed, he=20

had not been visited by a sudden deafness, it is difficult to see how he wo=
uld have handled the=20

situation.  "Have you any idea," Vodrey inquired, "why your husband refuses=
 to submit his neck to=20

the inspection of the court?"  "I didn't know he had refused."=20


_
think? And here," coolly pushing back her sleeve and plunging a plump, whit=
e arm into the water,=20

"this, you know--just a frog! See how tame! And people call them ugly! That=
's all they know about=20

it. Look at his beautiful skin and his honest eye! Isn't he handsome, now? =
Here are some lizards,=20

but they are not so interesting; quite pleasant, you know, but not fascinat=
ing, like frogs and=20

snakes. Yes, my lad, I dare say you will be wanting to see the snakes. Here=
 they are. They are as=20

tame as they are beautiful."  "She isn't going to take _them_ out in her ha=
nds, is she?" Mrs. Morris=20

whispered to her English friend.  "She always does," was the placid answer.=
 "See!"  Lady Margaret=20

had made a bracelet of a snake and was holding out her arm. One by one she =
added the others=20

while Mrs. Morris, having interposed her friend between her and the spectac=
le, controlled her=20

nerves as best she could. "They are quite harmless, quite, I assure you," s=
aid Lady Margaret,=20

making a reassuring gesture with her  "Well," said Alice, "if you hadn't tu=
rned me out of the court=20

while he was being examined, perhaps I could have told you. But I can't as =
it is. So it serves you=20

right."  Thus ended Alice's performances.   _The Public Captious_   The cou=
rt rose, and another=20

six or seven hundred pounds was gone into the pockets of the celebrated art=
istes engaged. It=20

became at once obvious, from the tone of the evening placards and the conte=
nts of evening=20

papers, and the remarks in crowded suburban trains, that for the public the=
 trial had resolved itself=20

into an affair of moles. Nothing else now interested the great and intellig=
ent public. If Priam had=20

those moles on his neck, then he was the real Priam. If he had not, then he=
 was a common cheat.=20

The public had taken the matter into its own hands. The sturdy common sense=
 of the public was=20

being applied to the affair. On the whole it may be said that the sturdy co=
mmon sense of the public=20

was against Priam. For the majority, the entire story was fishily=20
