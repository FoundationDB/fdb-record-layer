 are the centres where=20

the seven Rays of the Logos vibrate, I answer in the affirmative, simply re=
marking that the rays of=20

the Logos vibrate in every atom, for the matter of that.  In these volumes =
it is almost revealed that=20

the "Sons of Fohat" are the personified Forces known in a general way as Mo=
tion, Sound, Heat,=20

Light, Cohesion, Electricity or Electric Fluid, and Nerve-Force or Magnetis=
m. This truth, however,=20

cannot teach the student to attune and moderate the Kundalini of the cosmic=
 plane with the _vital_=20

Kundalini, the Electric Fluid with the Nerve-Force, and unless he does so, =
he is sure to kill himself;=20

for the one travels at the rate of about 90 feet, and the other at the rate=
 of 115,000 leagues a=20

second. The seven Shaktis respectively called Para Shakti, Jnana Shakti, et=
c., are synonymous=20

with the "Sons of Fohat," for they are their female aspects. At the present=
 stage, however, as their=20

names would only be confusing to the Western student, it is better to remem=
ber the English=20

equivalents as translated above. As each Force is septenary, their sum is, =
of course, forty-nine.=20

The question now mooted in Science, whether a sound is capable of calling f=
orth impressions of=20

light and colour in addition to its natural sound impressions, has been ans=
wered by Occult Science=20

ages ago. Every impulse or vibration of a physical object producing a certa=
in vibration of the air,=20

that is, causing the collision of physical particles, the sound of which is=
 capable of affecting the=20

ear, produces at the same time a corresponding flash of light, which will a=
ssume some particular=20

colour. For, in the realm of hidden Forces, an _audible_ sound is but a sub=
jective colour; and a=20

perceptible colour, but an _inaudible_ sound; both proceed from the same po=
tential substance,=20

which Physicists used to call ether, and now refer to under various other n=
ames; but which we call=20

plastic, through invisible SPACE. This may appear a paradoxical hypothesis,=
 but facts are there to=20

prove it. Complete deafness, for instance, does not preclude the possibilit=
y of discerning sounds;=20

medical science has several cases on record which prove that these sounds a=
re received by, and=20

conveyed to, the patient's organ of sight, through the mind, under the form=
 of chromatic=20

impressions. The very fact that the intermediate tones of the chromatic mus=
ical scale were=20

formerly written in colours shows an unconscious reminiscence of the ancien=
t Occult teaching that=20

colour and sound are two out of the seven correlative aspects, _on our plan=
e_, of one and the=20

same thing, _viz._, Nature's first differentiated Substance.  Here is an ex=
ample of the relation of=20

colour to vibration well worthy of the attention of Occultists. Not only Ad=
epts and advanced Chelas,=20

but also the lower order of Psychics, such as clairvoyants and psychometris=
ts, can perceive a=20

psychic Aura of various colours around every individual, corresponding to t=
he temperament of the=20

person within it. In other words, the mysterious records within the Auric E=
gg are not the heirloom=20

of trained Adepts alone, but sometimes also of natural Psychics. Every huma=
n passion, every=20

thought and quality, is indicated in this Aura by corresponding colours and=
 shades of colour, and=20

certain of these are sensed and felt rather than perceived. The best of suc=
h Psychics, as shown=20

by Galton, can also perceive colours produced by the vibrations of musical =
instruments, every note=20

suggesting a different colour. As a string vibrates and gives forth an audi=
ble note, so the nerves of=20

the human body vibrate and thrill in correspondence with various emotions u=
nder the general=20

impulse of the circulating vitality of Prana, thus producing undulations in=
 the psychic Aura of the=20

person which result in chromatic effects.  The human nervous system as a wh=
ole, then, may be=20

regarded as an AEolian Harp, responding to the impact of the vital force, w=
hich is no abstraction,=20



but a dynamic reality, and manifests the subtlest shades of the individual =
character in colour=20

phenomena. If these nerve vibrations are made intense enough and brought in=
to vibratory relation=20

with an astral element, the result is--sound. How, then, can anyone doubt t=
he relation between the=20

microcosmic and macrocosmic forces?  And now that I have shown that the Tan=
tric works as=20

explained by Rama Prasad, and other Yoga treatises of the same character wh=
ich have appeared=20

from time to time in Theosophical journals--for note well that those of tru=
e Raja Yoga are never=20

published--tend to Black Magic and are most dangerous to take for guides in=
 self-training, I hope=20

that students will be on their guard.  For, considering that no two authori=
ties up to the present day=20

agree as to the real location of the Chakras and Padmas in the body, and, s=
eeing that the colours=20

of the Tattvas as given are reversed, _e.g._:  (_a_) Akasha is made black o=
r colourless, whereas=20

corresponding to Manas, it is indigo;  (_b_) Vayu is made blue, whereas, co=
rresponding to the=20

Lower Manas, it is green;  (_c_) Apas is made white, whereas, corresponding=
 to the Astral Body, it=20

is violet, with a silver, moonlike white substratum;  Tejas, red, is the on=
ly colour given correctly--

from such considerations, I say, it is easy to see that these disagreements=
 are dangerous blinds.=20

Further, the practice of the Five Breaths results in deadly injury, both ph=
ysiologically speaking.=20

You know I am not familiar with the French language, which you, monsieur le=
 coadjuteur, both=20

speak and write so well."  ("This is a council of state," D'Artagnan remark=
ed to Porthos; "but we=20

held better ones at La Rochelle, with Athos and Aramis."  "At the Saint Ger=
vais bastion," said=20

Porthos.  "There and elsewhere.")  The coadjutor let the storm pass over hi=
s head and resumed,=20

still with the same tranquillity:  "Madame, if the opinion I have submitted=
 to you does not please=20

you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow. I know too =
well the wisdom of the=20

queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital =
long in trouble that may=20

lead to a revolution."  "Thus, then, it is your opinion," said Anne of Aust=
ria, with a sneer and biting=20

her lips with rage, "that yesterday's riot, which to-day is already a rebel=
lion, to-morrow may=20

become a revolution?"  "Yes, madame," replied the coadjutor, gravely.  "But=
 if I am to believe you,=20

sir, the people seem to have thrown off all restraint."  "It is a bad year =
for kings," said Gondy,=20

shaking his head; "look at England, madame."  "Yes; but fortunately we have=
 no Oliver Cromwell=20

in France," replied the queen.  "Who knows?" said Gondy; "such men are like=
 thunderbolts--one=20

recognizes them only when they have struck."  Every one shuddered and there=
 was a moment of=20

silence, during which the queen pressed her hand to her side, evidently to =
still the beatings of her=20

heart.  ("Porthos," murmured D'Artagnan, "look well at that priest."  "Yes,=
" said Porthos, "I see him.=20

What then?"  "Well, he is a man."  Porthos looked at D'Artagnan in astonish=
ment. Evidently he did=20

not understand his meaning.)  "Your majesty," continued the coadjutor, piti=
lessly, "is about to take=20

such measures as seem good to you, but I foresee that they will be violent =
and such as will still=20

further exasperate the rioters."  "In that case, you, monsieur le coadjuteu=
r, who have such power=20

over them and are at the same time friendly to us," said the queen, ironica=
lly, "will quiet them by=20

bestowing your blessing upon them."  "Perhaps it will be too late," said Go=
ndy, still unmoved;=20

"perhaps I shall have lost all influence; while by giving up Broussel your =
majesty will strike at the=20

root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival=
 of the revolt."  "Have I not,=20

then, that right?" cried the queen.  "If you have it, use it," replied Gond=
y.  ("Peste!" said D'Artagnan=20

to Porthos. "There is a man after my own heart. Oh! if he were minister and=
 I were his D'Artagnan,=20

instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin, mordieu! what fine things =
we would do together!"=20



"Yes," said Porthos.)  The queen made a sign for every one, except Mazarin,=
 to quit the room; and=20

Gondy bowed, as if to leave with the rest.  "Stay, sir," said Anne to him. =
 "Good," thought Gondy,=20

"she is going to yield."  ("She is going to have him killed," said D'Artagn=
an to Porthos, "but at all=20

events it shall not be by me. I swear to Heaven, on the contrary, that if t=
hey fall upon him I will fall=20

upon them."  "And I, too," said Porthos.)  "Good," muttered Mazarin, sittin=
g down, "we shall soon=20

see something startling."  The queen's eyes followed the retreating figures=
 and when the last had=20

closed the door she turned away. It was evident that she was making unnatur=
al efforts to subdue=20

her anger; she fanned herself, smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and=
 down. Gondy, who=20

began to feel uneasy, examined the tapestry with his eyes, touched the coat=
 of mail which he wore=20

under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a go=
od Spanish dagger,=20

which was hidden under his cloak, was well within reach.  "And now," at las=
t said the queen, "now=20

that we are alone, repeat your counsel, monsieur le coadjuteur."  "It is th=
is, madame: that you=20

should appear to have reflected, and publicly acknowledge an error, which c=
onstitutes the extra=20

strength of a strong government; release Broussel from prison and give him =
back to the people."=20

"Oh!" cried Anne, "to humble myself thus! Am I, or am I not, the queen? Thi=
s screaming mob, are=20

they, or are they not, my subjects? Have I friends? Have I guards? Ah! by N=
otre Dame! as Queen=20

Catherine used to say," continued she, excited by her own words, "rather th=
an give up this=20

infamous Broussel to them I will strangle him with my own hands!"  And she =
sprang toward Gondy,=20

whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than Broussel, with outstretch=
ed arms. The=20

coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed; =
only his glance=20

flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen.  ("He wer=
e a dead man" said the=20

Gascon, "if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at t=
his moment; but for my part,=20

before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once; the card=
inal would be infinitely=20

pleased with me."  "Hush!" said Porthos; "listen.")  "Madame," cried the ca=
rdinal, seizing hold of=20

Anne and drawing her back, "Madame, what are you about?"  Then he added in =
Spanish, "Anne,=20

are you mad? You, a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman! And do you not per=
ceive that in the=20

person of this priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it =
is dangerous to insult him=20

at this moment, and if this priest wished it, in an hour you would be witho=
ut a crown? Come, then,=20

on another occasion you can be firm and strong; but to-day is not the prope=
r time; to-day, flatter=20

and caress, or you are only a common woman."  (At=20


_
it is called, Pranayama, or the death of the breath, for it results, for th=
e practiser, in death--in moral=20

death always, and in physical death very frequently.    On Exoteric "Blinds=
" and "the Death of the=20

Soul."   As a corollary to this, and before going into still more abstruse =
teachings, I must redeem=20

the promise already given. I have to illustrate by tenets you already know,=
 the awful doctrine of=20

personal annihilation. Banish from your minds all that you have hitherto re=
ad in such works as=20

_Esoteric Buddhism_, and thought you understood, of such hypotheses as the =
eighth sphere and=20

the moon, and that man shares a common ancestor with the ape. Even the whic=
h he pressed with=20

gradually increasing force. When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos=
 in a low tone:=20

"Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish, or I am a lost man and you a=
re also."  "All right,"=20

said Porthos.)  This rough appeal, marked by the eloquence which characteri=
zed Mazarin when he=20

spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French, =
was uttered with such=20

impenetrable expression that Gondy, clever physiognomist as he was, had no =
suspicion of its=20

being more than a simple warning to be more subdued.  The queen, on her par=
t, thus chided,=20

softened immediately and sat down, and in an almost weeping voice, letting =
her=20


_
_Theosophist_ and _Lucifer_ were nothing like the whole truth, but only bro=
ad general ideas,=20

hardly touched upon in their details. Certain passages, however, give out h=
ints, especially my foot-

notes on articles translated from Eliphas Levi's _Letters on Magic_.(839)  =
Nevertheless, personal=20

immortality is conditional, for there are such things as "soulless men," a =
teaching barely=20

mentioned, although it is spoken of even in _Isis Unveiled_;(840) and there=
 is an Avitchi, rightly=20

called Hell, though it has no connection with, or similitude to, the good C=
hristian's Hell, either=20

geographically or psychically. The truth known to Occultists and Adepts in =
every age could not be=20

given out to a promiscuous public; hence, though almost every mystery of Oc=
cult Philosophy lies=20

half concealed in _Isis_ and the two earlier volumes of the present work, I=
 had no right to amplify=20

or correct the details of others. Readers may now compare those four volume=
s and such books as=20

_Esoteric Buddhism_ with the diagrams and explanations in these Papers, and=
 see for=20

themselves.  Paramatma, the Spiritual Sun, may be thought of as outside the=
 human Auric Egg, as=20

it is also  "Pardon me, sir, and attribute this violence to what I suffer. =
A woman, and consequently=20

subject to the weaknesses of my sex, I am alarmed at the idea of civil war;=
 a queen, accustomed=20

to be obeyed, I am excited at the first opposition."  "Madame," replied Gon=
dy, bowing, "your=20

majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition. Your maj=
esty has none but=20

submissive and respectful subjects. It is not the queen with whom the peopl=
e are displeased; they=20

ask for Broussel and are only too happy, if you release him to them, to liv=
e under your=20

government."  Mazarin, who at the words, "It is not the queen with whom the=
 people are=20

displeased," had pricked up his ears, thinking that the coadjutor was about=
 to speak of the cries,=20

"Down with Mazarin," and pleased with Gondy's suppression of this fact, he =
said with his sweetest=20

voice and his most gracious expression:  "Madame, credit the coadjutor, who=
 is one of the most=20

able politicians we have; the first available cardinal's hat seems to belon=
g already to his noble=20

brow."  "Ah! how much you have need of me, cunning rogue!" thought Gondy.  =
("And what will he=20

promise us?" said D'Artagnan.=20


_
though every particle and atom are, so to speak, cemented with and soaked t=
hrough by this=20

Paramatmic essence, yet it is wrong to call it a "human" or even a "univers=

Porthos.  "For you? I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meiller=
