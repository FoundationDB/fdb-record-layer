Doctor Wells had a habit of conferring with Mr. Stevens in matters that con=
cerned his personal=20

relationship with the members of the school. He had a great respect for the=
 English master's=20

understanding of character. On Tuesday morning he summoned Mr. Stevens to h=
is office and put=20

a blunt question.  "What do you think of Holbrook--Teeny-bits, as they call=
 him?"  "Why, I've=20

always liked him," said Mr. Stevens.  "Are you quite sure of him?"  For an =
instant Mr. Stevens did=20

not answer, and then he said quickly: "Yes, I----, oh, I'm sure he's all ri=
ght. In fact, I've considered=20

him as the same type--though, of course, with a different background--as Ne=
il Durant; and you=20

know what I think of Neil."  If Doctor Wells had noticed the slight pause w=
hich preceded the=20

English master's reply, he gave no sign. "I agree with you," he declared. "=
But I want to tell you=20

about a puzzling incident that happened last night."  Briefly, but omitting=
 no important detail,=20

Doctor Wells told Mr. Stevens of the unsigned letter that accused Teeny-bit=
s, of his conference=20

with the newcomer and of the visit to Gannett Hall. When the Head described=
 the discovery of the=20

stolen property beneath the floor of Teeny-bits' closet, the expression on =
strikes fire with steel, is a=20

milk-white colour, adheres slightly to the tongue, and has no degree of tra=
nslucency on its edges.=20

As Mr. Kain has furnished you with an interesting detail of particular mine=
rals found in East=20

Tennessee and Western Virginia, I need not recapitulate what he has so well=
 said.  (_To be=20

continued._)     ART. III. _Notice of the Scenery, Geology, Mineralogy, Bot=

 bounded on the=20

north by Jefferson and Harrison, on the west by Guernsey, and south by Monr=
oe county, and on=20

the east by the Ohio river. It is 27 miles in length, and 21 in breadth, co=
ntaining 535 square miles.=20

Its name, _Belmont_, or beautiful mountain, indicates its situation, for it=

boundaries a fine body of land, rising gradually as you are travelling from=
 the Ohio to the west,=20

"You actually found those things in his room!" exclaimed the English master=
. He was sitting in the=20

same chair in which Teeny-bits had sat just twelve hours before.  Doctor We=
lls, sitting opposite,=20

smiled slightly at the surprise in Mr. Stevens' voice; he had heard just su=
ch a quality of surprise=20

mingled with indignation in the voice of Teeny-bits.  "It astonishes you as=
 much as it did me," said=20

the Head. "What do you think of it?"  Mr. Stevens sat and looked into the f=
ire and did not answer=20

the question. The room became so quiet that the clock on the mantel seemed =
to raise its voice,--

as if suddenly it had become animate and wished to make itself heard. It ti=
cked out a full minute=20

and sixty seconds more and then--as it were--became silent, for the voice o=
f the English master=20

drowned it out.  "That put a real problem up to me," he said. "I didn't kno=
w at first what to do, but I=20

think I see clearly now. Something happened last night--something I couldn'=
t quite explain; I've=20

been puzzling over it. Unless I were sure--well sure that you know just wha=
t weight to give to=20

outward appearances, I shouldn't tell you this; everything considered, howe=
ver, I think you ought=20

to know it. The incident happened last night only a few minutes before you =
asked me to send=20

Holbrook over to you."  While Doctor Wells listened with an intentness that=
 was revealed by the=20

lines of his contracted brows, Mr. Stevens described how he had found Teeny=
-bits crouching in=20

the shrubbery behind Gannett Hall and mentioned the newcomer's confusion at=
 being discovered.=20

"I've always believed that character inevitably expresses itself in a perso=
n's face," said Doctor=20

the country; you see=20

decay and putrefaction of vegetable substances. Along the Ohio, a wide inte=
rvale of the richest=20

y in the world. On the=20

banks of the creeks which pass through this country the alluvial soil is no=
t so wide as that on the=20

river, but equally rich and productive. On the hills (and there are many of=
 them) there are two kinds=20

of soil, the silicious and the argillaceous, the first is formed from the d=
ecomposition of the rocks=20

which once covered the surface, the latter from the slate which lay under t=

are decomposed, and the country is hilly, it will readily be believed that =
the two kinds of soil are=20
