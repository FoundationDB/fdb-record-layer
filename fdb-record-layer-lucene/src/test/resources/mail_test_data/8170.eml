De Mirville       tries to have what he says of Satan and his Court sending=
 their imps       on earth to=20

tempt humanity and masquerade at _seances_, corroborated       by the ex-so=
rcerer.    300 This=20

does not look like sinful food. It is the diet of Chelas to       this day.=
    301 "Grafted" is the correct=20

_Catechism of Lanoos_.    302 Only the Prince of the World is not Satan, as=
 the translator would=20

make us believe, but the collective Host of the Planetary. This is a       =
little theological back-biting.=20

Aramis.  "My head feels actually cold," said Porthos.  "As for me, I feel a=
nxious to preach a=20

sermon," said D'Artagnan.  "Now," said Athos, "that we cannot even recogniz=
e one another and=20

have therefore no fear of others recognizing us, let us go and see the king=

not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king's arrival. =
A carriage had been=20

sent to meet him, and the gigantic Porthos, who stood a head above the enti=
re rabble, soon=20

announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching. D'Artagnan raised him=
self on tiptoe, and=20

as the carriage passed, saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the othe=
r.  The next day,=20

Athos, leaning out of his window, which looked upon the most populous part =
of the city, heard the=20

Act of Parliament, which summoned the ex-king, Charles I., to the bar, publ=
icly cried.  "Parliament=20

indeed!" cried Athos. "Parliament can never have passed such an act as that=
."  At this moment the=20

landlord came in.  "Did parliament pass this act?" Athos asked of him in En=
glish.  "Yes, my lord,=20

the pure parliament."  "What do you mean by 'the=20

As to Porthos,=20

in Spanish.  "I asked," said Athos, in the same language, "if there are two=
 parliaments, a pure and=20
