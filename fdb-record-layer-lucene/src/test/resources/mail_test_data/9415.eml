ace to such an extent=20

that, as a comrade asserted, his own mother would not have known him--a sto=
ut young man=20

walked smartly one morning through the streets of London towards his own ho=
me.  He was tall=20

and good-looking, as well as stout, and, although wet and weary, had a spri=
ng in his step which=20

proved beyond all question that he was not worn-out.  As the comrade above =
referred to would=20

have said, "there was plenty of go in him=20

with a thin cap of=20

cotton (the tageea). My camel-men had expected to find their families at a =
village that we had=20

passed about six miles from Sherrem, and they had been rejoicing in anticip=
ation, but on arrival=20

we found it deserted,--"family out of town;" the men were quite dejected; b=
ut upon arrival at=20

Sherrem they found all their people, who had migrated for water, as the riv=
er was dry. We waited=20

at Sherrem for a couple of days to rest the men, whose feet were much swoll=
en with marching on=20

the burning soil. Although frequent showers had fallen at Gallabat, we had =
quickly entered the dry=20

country upon steering north, where neither dew nor rain had moistened the g=
round for many=20

months. The country was sailor's cap, and small hatchet, with the brass hel=

be able to live in smoke=20

as if it were their native element; who face the flames as if their bodies =
were made of cast iron;=20

and whose apparent delight in fire is such that one is led to suspect they =
must be all more or less=20

distantly connected with the family of Salamander.  The young man's express=

y season to the river;=20

the earth absorbed the entire rainfall. Our camels were nearly driven mad b=
y the flies which=20

swarmed throughout the fertile districts.  On the 15th of May we arrived at=
 Kook, a small village on=20

the banks of the Rahad, and on the following morning we started to the west=
 for the river Dinder.=20

The country opinion we have already quoted, was wont to say that he ought t=
o change it to=20

Dashwater, that being his chief occupation in life.  We need scarcely say t=
hat this comrade was=20

rather fond of his joke.  Arrived at a small street, not far from the Regen=
t Circus, young Dashwood=20

entered a fire-station there, and found the comrade above referred to in th=
e act of disposing=20

himself on a narrow tressel-bed, on which there was no bedding save one bla=
nket.  The comrade=20

happened to be on duty that night.  It was his duty to repose on the tresse=
l-bedstead, booted and=20

belted, ready at a moment's notice to=20

andering Arabs and=20

their flocks, that migrate at the commencement of the rainy season, when th=
is land becomes a=20

mere swamp, and swarms with the seroot fly. At 6.30 we halted, and slept on=
 the road. This was=20

the main route to Sennaar, from which place strings of camels were passing =
to the Rahad, to=20

purchase corn. On the 16th of May, we started by moonlight at 4.30 A.M. due=
 west, and at 7.30=20

A.M. we arrived at the river Dinder, which, at this point, was eighteen mil=
es from the village of=20

Kook, on the Rahad.  We joined Another fireman lay sleeping at his side, on=
 another tressel-bed,=20

similarly clothed, for there were always two men on duty all night at that =
station.  The guard-room,=20

or, as it was styled, the "lobby," in which they lay, was a very small room=
, with a bright fire in the=20

grate, for it was winter; a plain wooden desk near the window; a plain deal=
 table near the door, on=20

which stood four telegraphic instruments; and having the walls ornamented w=

Wellington boots on one side, and a row of bright brass helmets on the othe=
