of the Rio Negro. These are the five or six languages most generally spoken=

to find at Esmeralda many zambos, mulattos, and copper-coloured people, who=
 called themselves=20

Spaniards (Espanoles) and who fancy they are white, because they are not so=
 red as the Indians.=20

These people live in the most absolute misery; they have for the most part =
been sent hither in=20

Maraguaca contain in=20

open veins fine rock-crystals, some of them of great transparency, others c=
oloured by chlorite or=20

blended with actonite; these were mistaken for diamonds and emeralds.  So n=
ear the sources of=20

the Orinoco we heard of nothing in these mountains but the proximity of El =
Dorado, the lake=20

Parima, and the ruins of the great city of Manoa. A man, still known in the=
 country for his credulity=20

and his love of exaggeration, Don Apollinario Diez de la Fuente, assumed th=
e pompous title of=20

capitan poblador, and cabo militar (military commander) of the fort of Cass=
iquiare. This fort=20

consisted of a few trunks of trees, joined together by planks; and to compl=
ete the deception, a=20

demand was made at Madrid for the privileges of a villa for the mission of =
Esmeralda, which but a=20

hamlet with twelve or fifteen huts. A colony composed of elements altogethe=
r heterogeneous=20



perished by degrees. The vagabonds of the Llanos had as little taste for la=
bour as the natives,=20

who were compelled to live within the sound of the bell. The former found a=
 motive in their pride to=20

justify their indolence. In the missions, every mulatto who is not decidedl=
y black as an African, or=20

copper-coloured as an Indian, calls himself a Spaniard; he belongs to the g=
ente de razon--the race=20

endued with reason; and that reason (sometimes, it must be admitted, arroga=
nt and indolent)=20

persuaded the whites, and those=20

burdens. Who do you think is in the trenches now...is the bourgeois class? =
NO! It's the labouring=20

class. One by one, the bourgeois have slipped out of it. Got themselves the=
 fat jobs at the rear,=20

work in hospitals... anything but to stay out in the front-line trenches wi=
th us poor rats of working-

people! Isn't that so?'  "He appealed to his companion, who answered again =
very calmly (it was=20

extraordinary how they didn't seem to mind differing diametrically from eac=
h other. I suppose they=20

had the long habit of arguing together). 'No, it's not so! In my company th=
ere are as many=20

bourgeois as labouring men.'  "The first man never paid the least attention=
 to these brief denials of=20

everything he was saying. 'It's the proletariat that always pays...isn't it=
 so, Ma'ame! Peace or war,=20

old times or new, it's always the poor who pay all the debts! And they're d=
oing it to such a tune=20

now in France that there won't be any left, when the war is over... oh, it'=
s got to stop. There's no=20

use talking about it...and it WILL, too, one of these days...who CARES how =
it stops! Life...any sort=20

of life...is better than anything else.'  "At this the other soldier said, =
'Don't that to till the ground is a=20

task fit only for slaves (poitos) and the native neophytes. The colony of E=
smeralda had been=20

founded on the principles of that of Australia; but it was far from being g=
overned with the same=20

wisdom. The American colonists, being separated from their native soil, not=
 by seas, but by forests=20

and savannahs, dispersed; some taking the road northward, towards the Caura=
 and the Carony;=20

others proceeding southward to the Portuguese possessions. Thus the celebri=
ty of this villa, and of=20

the emerald-mines of Duida, vanished in a few years; and Esmeralda, on acco=
unt of the immense=20

number of insects that obscure the air at all seasons of the year, was rega=
rded by the monks as a=20

place of banishment. The superior of the missions, when he would make the l=
ay-brothers mindful=20

of their duty, threatens sometimes to send them to Esmeralda; that is, say =
the monks, to be=20

condemned to the mosquitos; to be devoured by those buzzing flies (zancudos=
 gritones) which=20

God appears to have created for the torment and chastisement of man.* (* "E=
stos mosquitos que=20

llaman zancudos gritones los parece cria la naturaleza para castigo y torme=

"Those mosquitos which are called buzzing zancudos, Nature seems to have cr=
eated for the=20

especial punishment and torture of man." Fray Pedro Simon.) These strange p=
unishments have=20

not always been confined to the lay-brothers. There happened in 1788 one of=
