philodendron monstera odor of witch-hazel and other sweet scents that the b=

  With bushes parting and grasses and weeds bending at his coming, the old =
sense of freedom came surging back to the escaped prisoner and he parts gle=
ns and spreading dolls, masses of black pines and savage woods; everywhere,=
 sometimes glittering, and sometimes sullen, glimpses of the largest natura=

 moors, and the first crest of mountains. The park, too, was full of life, =
for there were not only herds of red and philodendron monstera odor of witc=

f underbrush just ahead and into it Black Bruin crashed.  Weeds swished as =
he passed and the brush whipped his face.  With bushes parting and grasses =
and weeds bending at his coming, the old sense of freedom came surging back=
 to the escaped prisoner and he parts glens and spreading dolls, masses of =
black pines and savage woods; everywhere, sometimes glittering, and sometim=
es sullen, glimpses of the largest natural lake that inland England boasts,=
 Muriel Mere, and in the extreme distance moors, and the first crest of mou=
ntains. The park, too, was full of life, for there were not only herds of r=
ed and _
the time in a series of short naps.  Each day he came forth from his improv=
ised den to stretch and=20

to eat.  Toward spring, by dint of much coaxing and liberal rewards of suga=
r and honey, the keeper=20

got upon good terms with him and finally discovered most of his tricks.  Wh=
en the next season=20

opened, the prisoner found that he was to have a little more freedom and a =
rather more varied=20

existence than that of the year before.  Upon the circus bills he appeared =
as Napoleon Bonaparte,=20

the wonderful trick-bear; and there was a striking and astonishing picture =
of him in the act of=20

opening a bottle and drinking from it.  Small boys stood spellbound before =
this picture, and they=20

were still more astonished when the real live bear was led into the ring an=
d marched up and down=20

with a wooden gun upon his shoulder, while the performance of his bottle-tr=
ick always created a=20

rustle all over the tent.  This was the surest sign of a great hit.  So now=
 each day, in addition to=20

appearing in the grand cavalcade and the street-parade, Black Bruin had to =
come into the ring=20

each afternoon and evening and go through his senseless tricks.  The only t=
hing that kept him=20

good-natured and up to the mark, was the fact that his bottle was always fi=
lled with some pleasing=20

drink, so he had that to look forward to after each performance of the tric=
k.  There were also=20

sweets in waiting for him when he came out of the ring.  Thus went the endl=
ess round.  Here to-

day and there to-morrow.  In the evening a magic city of white tents would =
be seen upon the=20

grounds, but by midnight all had been stowed away in four or five long trai=
ns, which soon were=20

thundering over the rails to a distant city, where for the past three weeks=
 posters had announced=20

the coming of the circus.  Thus the days and weeks of Black Bruin's second =
year in the circus=20

passed and they concluded the season at Nashville, Tennessee.  Then all the=
 paraphernalia was=20

loaded with even more care than usual, for they were off for the long trip =
northward, to their winter=20

quarters.  That night when they loaded the elephants and the trick-ponies, =
some of them hung=20

back and refused to board the train, a tendency most unusual on their part;=
 but they finally obeyed=20

the goad and lash and all were stowed away in their customary places.  It w=
as about midnight=20

when the train bearing Black Bruin's van pulled out.  One by one the cars b=
umped over the switch=20

and the long train got under way.  At first the locomotive puffed and pante=
d as though the load=20

were too great for it, but finally the train got up momentum and the car-wh=
eels sang their old song=20

of rat-a-clat-rat-a-clat-rat-a-tat-tat, while the engine assumed its famili=
ar song of    "Rushing,=20

pulling, snatch the train along,   Tugging, pulling, locomotive strong."  T=
his is the song that a=20

locomotive always sings when it is off for a long, hard pull.  On, on throu=
gh the darkness the train=20

sped, the engine sending forth showers of sparks that twinkled in the gloom=
 like fireflies, and then=20

went out.  But the most conspicuous thing about the train was the headlight=
, which threw its long=20

cylindrical shaft       CHAPTER 36 The lodge-gate of Belmont was opening as=
 Lothair one morning=20

approached it; a Hansom cab came forth, and in it was a person whose counte=
nance was strongly=20

marked on the memory of Lothair. It was that of his unknown friend at the F=
enian meeting. Lothair=20

instantly recognized and cordially saluted him, and his greeting, though hu=
rriedly, was not=20

ungraciously returned; but the vehicle did not stop. Lothair called to the =
driver to halt; but the=20

driver, on the contrary, stimulated his steed, and in the winding lane was =
soon out of sight.=20

Theodora was not immediately visible. She was neither in her usual apartmen=
t nor in her garden;=20

but it was only perhaps because Lothair was so full of his own impressions =
from his recent=20

encounter at the lodge, that he did not observe that the demeanor of Mrs. C=
ampian, when she=20

appeared, was hardly marked by her habitual serenity. She entered the room =
hurriedly and spoke=20



with quickness.  =E2=80=9CPray,=E2=80=9D exclaimed Lothair, rather eagerly,=
 =E2=80=9Cdo tell me the name of the gentleman=20

who has just called here.=E2=80=9D  Theodora changed color, looked distress=
ed, and was silent;=20

unobserved, however, by Lothair, who, absorbed by his own highly-excited cu=
riosity, proceeded to=20

explain why he presumed to press for the information. =E2=80=9CI am under g=
reat obligations to that person;=20

I am not sure I may not say I owe him my life, but certainly an extrication=
 from great dander and=20

very embarrassing danger too. I never saw him but once, and he would not gi=
ve me his name, and=20

scarcely would accept my thanks. I wanted to stop his cab to-day, but it wa=
s impossible. He=20

literally galloped off.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe is a foreigner,=E2=80=9D said=
 Mrs Campian, who had recovered herself; =E2=80=9Che was a=20

particular friend of my dear father; and when he visits England, which he d=
oes occasionally, he=20

calls to see us.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9CI h=
ope I shall soon have an opportunity of expressing to him=20

my gratitude.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt was so like him not to give his name an=
d to shrink from thanks,=E2=80=9D said Mrs.=20

Campian. =E2=80=9CHe never enters society, and makes no acquaintances.=E2=
=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am sorry for that,=E2=80=9D said=20

Lothair, =E2=80=9Cfor it is not only that he served me, but I was much take=
n with him, and felt that he was a=20

person I should like to cultivate.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes, Captain Bruges i=
s a remarkable man,=E2=80=9D said Theodora; =E2=80=9Che=20

is not one to be forgotten.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CCaptain Bruges. That, then, =
is his name?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHe is known by the name=20

of Captain Bruges,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, and she hesitated; and then spea=
king more quickly she added:=20

=E2=80=9CI cannot sanction, I cannot bear, any deception between you and th=
is roof. Bruges is not his real=20

name, nor is the title he assumes his real rank. He is not to be known, and=
 not to be spoken of. He=20

is one, and one of the most eminent, of the great family of sufferers in th=
is world, but sufferers for=20

a divine cause. I myself have been direly stricken in this struggle. When I=
 remember the departed,=20

it is not always easy to bear the thought. I keep it at the bottom of my he=
art; but this visit to-day=20

has too terribly revived every thing. It is well that you only are here to =
witness my suffering, but you=20

will not have to witness it=20


_
of fire boring into the darkness.  No matter how hard the engine puffed and=
 panted or how fast the=20

drivers thundered over the rails, this bright cylinder of light was always =
just so far ahead,=20

illuminating the gleaming rails, flashing into deep cuts, lighting up cliff=
s and forest, and long=20

stretches of open fields.  Black Bruin was not asleep in his cage, as he us=
ually was on long=20

journeys like this.  Somehow, he felt restless and ill at ease.  He sniffed=
 his bars often, but the=20

heavy shutters were down and no sign of freedom was at hand.  Yet in some u=
naccountable=20

manner, the wind sucking through the cracks between the shutters blew fresh=
er and sweeter than=20

usual.  It tasted of pine-woods and deep tangles of swamp-land, where all t=
he roots that a bear=20

likes grow.  The train had left the low-lying lands far behind and was comi=
ng into the foothills--

those friendly steps by which tired feet climb to the mountains above.  It =
was rushing down a steep=20

grade, traveling by its own momentum, upon a rather precipitous pathway cut=
 in a side hill, when=20

something happened.  Perhaps it was a broken rail, or maybe a great boulder=
 had toppled down=20

the mountainside and lay upon the track; but the important thing was that s=
uddenly, without a=20

second's warning, the engine bucked like a balky broncho, and after one or =
two mad plunges=20

along the roadbed, toppled over the bank and rolled into will never again s=
peak of these matters.=E2=80=9D=20

Lothair was much touched: his good heart and his good taste alike dissuaded=
 him from attempting=20

commonplace consolation. He ventured to take her hand and pressed it to his=
 lips. =E2=80=9CDear lady!=E2=80=9D he=20

murmured, and he led her to a seat. =E2=80=9CI fear my foolish tattle has a=
dded to pain which I would gladly=20

bear for you.=E2=80=9D  They talked about nothings: about a new horse which=
 Colonel Campian had just=20

purchased, and which he wanted to show to Lothair; an old opera revived, bu=
t which sounded=20

rather flat; something amusing that somebody had said, and something absurd=
 which somebody=20

had done. And then, when the ruffled feeling had been quite composed, and a=
ll had been brought=20

back to the tenor of their usual pleasant life, Lothair said suddenly and r=
ather gayly. =E2=80=9CAnd now,=20

dearest lady, I have a favor to ask. You know my majority is to be achieved=
 and to be celebrated=20

next month. I hope that yourself and Colonel Campian will honor me by being=
 my guests.=E2=80=9D=20

Theodora did not at all look like a lady who had received a social attentio=
n of the most=20

distinguished class. She looked embarrassed, and began to murmur something =
about Colonel=20

Campian, and their never going into society.  =E2=80=9CColonel Campian is g=
oing to Scotland, and you are=20

going with him,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CI know it, for he told me s=
o, and said he could manage the visit to=20

me, if you approved it,=20


_
first impact of the locomotive with the long train behind it, the freight a=
rched its back and writhed=20

and twisted like a mighty serpent.  Three of the cars went over the bank st=
ill attached to the engine=20

and the rest piled up on one another or rolled down into the gulley, as fat=
e willed. There was crash=20

upon crash and thunder upon thunder as the heavy cars piled in a frightful =
heap.  There was the=20

groan of iron and steel being bent and broken, and the crash and creak and =
crackle of breaking,=20

grinding car-floors.  When we add to this the roar of lions, the shrieking =
of horses, the trumpeting=20

of elephants, the snarling and snapping of wolves, jaguars, hyenas and a ch=
orus of other cries=20

with this Scotch visit.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere was some talk once about S=
cotland,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cbut that was a=20

long time ago. Many things have happened since then. I do not think the Sco=
tch visit is by any=20

means so settled as you think.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut, however that may be =
decided,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9Cthere can be=20

no reason why you should not come to me.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is presumptu=
ous in me, a foreigner, to speak of=20

such matters,=E2=80=9D said Theodora; =E2=80=9Cbut I fancy that, in such ce=
lebrations as you contemplate, there is,=20

or there should be, some qualification of blood or family connection for be=
coming your guests. We=20

should be there quite strangers, and in everybody=E2=80=99s way, checking t=
he local and domestic=20

abandon which I=20


_
steam as it escaped through an open valve in the locomotive, and the shriek=
 of the whistle which=20

blew continually, we can get some idea of the wreck, as the gorgeous splend=
or of the barbaric=20

show was piled in ruins.  It was such sights and sounds as these that greet=
ed Black Bruin as he=20

squeezed through the battered, broken door of his cage into freedom.  He ha=
d felt himself rolling=20

over and over.  First he was upon the bottom of his cage and then standing =
upon the inverted roof.=20

Three times he bumped from the top to the bottom and back again in rapid su=
ccession.  What did=20

it mean?  His van had never acted like this.  It was all so quick that he m=
erely emitted a frightened=20

bawl or two and lay still, cowering in the corner of his cage.  Then in som=
e unaccountable way he=20

became aware that his cage-door was open.  His back was to it, but the wind=
 that blew in upon=20

him, was the wind of the woods and the waters, and not the stifling, filter=
ed wind of his prison.  As=20

this sense was borne in upon him, Black Bruin lost no time in scrambling ou=
t through the opening.=20

His first act on coming  =E2=80=9CI have few relations and scarcely a conne=
ction,=E2=80=9D said Lothair rather=20

moodily. =E2=80=9CI can only ask friends to celebrate my majority, and ther=
e are no friends whom I so much=20

regard as those who live at Belmont.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIt is very kind of =
you to say that, and to feel it; and I know=20

that you would not say it if you did not feel it,=E2=80=9D replied Theodora=
. =E2=80=9CBut still, I think it would be better=20

that we should come to see you at a time when you are less engaged; perhaps=
 you will take=20

Colonel Campian down some day and give him some shooting.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CAll I can say is that, if you do not=20

come, it will be the darkest, instead of the brightest, week in my life,=E2=
=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CIn short, I feel I=20

could not get through the business; I should be so mortified. I cannot rest=
rain my feelings or=20

arrange my countenance. Unless you come, the whole affair will be a complet=
e failure, and worse=20

than a failure.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I will speak to Colonel Campian ab=
out it,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, but with little=20

animation.  =E2=80=9CWe will both speak to him about it now,=E2=80=9D said =
Lothair, for the colonel at that moment=20

entered the room and greeted=20


_
stars and the free sky above him, was to stretch.  He then looked about him=
 as though uncertain=20

what was coming next.  As he stood irresolute, looking first at the wreck a=
nd then away to the=20

outline of a great mountain that stretched above him, seeming to reach up i=
nto the very heavens,=20

the long, lithe form of a panther cordially.  =E2=80=9CWe are settling the =
visit to Muriel,=E2=80=9D said Lothair; =E2=80=9CI want=20

to induce Mrs. Campian to come down a day or two before the rest, so that w=
e may have the=20

benefit of her counsel.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 37 Muriel Tower crowned a wo=
oded steep, part of a wild,=20

and winding, and sylvan valley, at the bottom of which rushed a=20


_
and melted into the darkness.  A moment later a jaguar followed it; they we=
re going back to=20

freedom.  Then Black Bruin stretched his nose high in air and sniffed the f=
resh untamed winds.=20

They were sweet with the scent of the southern pine. Suggestions of the per=
simmon fruit stream.=20

On the other side of the castle the scene, though extensive, was not less s=
triking, and was=20

essentially romantic. A vast park spread in all directions beyond the limit=
 of the eye, and with much=20

variety of character=E2=80=94ornate near the mansion, and choicely timbered=
; in other=20
