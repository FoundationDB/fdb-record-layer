Pennsylvania and Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. Ex-slaves who live in =
Florida now but who=20

came here since the Emancipation of the Negro tell of living conditions of =
their respective states;=20

they are very similar to the modes of living in Altoona, during slavery. (2=
)  Soap was made from=20

grease and lye just as it was made in the south. Shin-plaster (paper money =
similar to green back,=20

which represented amounts less than a dollar) were very plentiful and after=
 the Civil War=20

confederate money of all kinds was as so much trash.  Food stuffs which wer=
e raised on the farm=20

at Altoona were: corn, peanuts, white potatoes and peas. Enough peas were r=
aised to feed the=20

stock and take care of the family for 18 months. Potatoes were raised in la=
rge quantities and after=20

they were dug they were banked for the winter. By banked, it is meant, larg=
e holes were dug in the=20

cellar of the house or under the house or inside of an outhouse; pine straw=
 was put into this pit=20

and the potatoes piled in; more straw was laid on and more potatoes piled i=
n until all were in the=20

pit. Dirt was shoveled over the lot and it was left until for using them. N=
orthern people used and=20

still use a large amount of white, or Irish potatoes.  In curing hides of c=
ows for making leather the=20

same method was employed as that used in the south. Hides were first salted=
 and water was=20

poured over them. They were covered with dirt and left to soak a few days. =
A solution of red oak=20

bark was made by soaking the bark in water and this solution was poured ove=
r the hides. After it=20

soaked a few days the hair was scraped off with a stiff brush and when it d=
ried leather was ready=20

for making shoes and harness.  George's father dealt extensively in leather=
 and when he could not=20

get enough cured himself, he bought of others who could supply him.  Now Ge=
orge's mother was=20

very handy at the spinning wheel and loom. He remembers how the bunch of co=
tton was combed=20

in preparation for spinning. Cards with teeth were arranged on the spinning=
 wheel and the mass of=20

cotton was combed through it to separate it into fibers. The fibers were ro=
lled between the fingers=20

and then put upon the spinning wheel to be spun into thread. As it was spun=
, it was wound upon=20

spools. After the spools were filled they were taken off and put on the loo=
m. Threads were strung=20

across the loom some above others and the shuttle running back and forth th=
rough the threads=20

would make cloth. All that was done by hand power. A person working at the =
loom regularly soon=20

became proficient and George's mother was one who bore the name of being a =
very good weaver=20

of cloth. Most of the clothes the family wore were home spun.  Underwear an=
d sleeping garments=20

were made of the natural colored homespun cloth. When colored cloth was wan=
ted a dye was=20

made to dip them in so as to get the desired color. Dyes were made by soaki=
ng red oak bark in=20

water. Another was made of elder berries and when a real blood red was desi=
red polk berries=20

were used. Polk berries made a blood red dye and was considered very beauti=
ful. Walnut hulls=20

were used to make brown dye and it was lasting in its effects.  In making d=
ye hold its color, the=20

cloth and dye were boiled together. After it had "taken" well, the cloth wa=
s removed from the dye=20

and rinsed well, the rinse water was salted so as to set the color.  Tubs f=
or washing clothes and=20

bathing purposes were made of wood. Some were made from barrels out in tew =
parts. In cutting a=20

stay was left longer on each side and holes were cut length wise in it so t=
here would be sufficient=20

room for all of the fingers to fit. That was for lifting the tub about.  A =
very interesting side of=20

George's life was depicted in his statement of the longevity of his innocen=
ce. We may call it=20

ignorance but it seems to be more innocence when compared to the incident o=
f Adam and Eve as=20

told in the Holy Bible in the book of Genesis. He was 33 years of age befor=
e he knew he was a=20

grown man, or how life was given humans. In plain words he did not know whe=
re babies came=20



from, nor how they were bred.  Whenever George's mother was expecting to be=
 confined with a=20

baby's birth, his father would say to all the children together, large and =
small alike, "your mother=20

has gone to New York, Baltimore, Buffalo" or any place he would think of at=
 the time. There was=20

an upstairs room in their home and she would stay there six weeks. She woul=
d science analyse=20

them and then awfulness disappears. If the interaction of all parts of the =
material universe is=20

complete we fail to see why one object or one feeling is more cosmic than a=
nother. However we=20

will not dwell on that which as we have already confessed we do not feel su=
re that we rightly=20

apprehend. What we do clearly see is that to have cosmic emotion or cosmic =
anything you must=20

have a cosmos. You must be assured that the universe is a cosmos and not a =
chaos. And what=20

assurance of this can materialism or any non theological system give? Law i=
s a theological term, it=20

implies a lawgiver or a governing intelligence of some kind. Science can te=
ll us nothing but facts,=20

single or accumulated as experience, which would not make a law though they=
 had been observed=20

through myriads of years. Law is a theological term, and cosmos is equally =
so, if it may not rather=20

be said to be a Greek name for the aggregate of laws. For order implies int=
elligent selection and=20

arrangement. Our idea of order would not be satisfied by a number of object=
s falling by mere=20

chance into a particular figure, however intricate and regular. All the arg=
uments which have been=20

used against design seem to tell with equal force against order. We have no=
 other universe=20

wherewith we can compare this, so as to assure ourselves that this universe=
 is not a chaos, but a=20

cosmos. Both on the earth and in the heavens we see much that is not order,=
 but disorder; not=20

cosmos, but acosmia. If we divine, nevertheless, that order reigns, and tha=
t there is design=20

beneath the seemingly undesigned, and good beneath the appearance of evil, =
it is by virtue of=20

something not dreamed of in the philosophy of materialism.  Have we really =
come to this, that the=20

world has no longer any good reason for believing in a God or a life beyond=
 the grave? If so, it is=20

difficult to deny that with regard to the great mass of mankind up to this =
time Schopenhauer and=20

the Pessimists are right, and existence has been a cruel misadventure. The =
number of those who=20

have suffered lifelong oppression, disease, or want, who have died deaths o=
f torture or perished=20

miserably by war, is limited though enormous; but probably there have been =
few lives in which the=20

earthly good has not been outweighed by the evil. The future may bring incr=
eased means of=20

happiness, though those who are gone will not be the better for them; but i=
t will bring also increase=20

of sensibility, and the consciousness of hopeless imperfection and miserabl=
e futility will probably=20

become a distinct and growing cause of pain. It is doubtful even whether, a=
fter such a raising of=20

Mokanna's veil, faith in everything would not expire and human effort cease=
. Still we must face the=20

situation: there can be no use in self-delusion. In vain we shall seek to c=
heat our souls and to fill a=20

void which cannot be filled by the manufacture of artificial religions and =
the affectation of a spiritual=20

language to which, however persistently and fervently it may be used, no re=
alities correspond. If=20

one of these cults could get itself established, in less than a generation =
it would become hollower=20

than the hollowest of ecclesiasticisms. Probably not a few of the highest n=
atures would withdraw=20

themselves from the dreary round of self mockery by suicide, and if a scien=
tific priesthood=20

attempted to close that door by sociological dogma or posthumous denunciati=
on the result would=20

show the difference between the practical efficacy of a religion with a God=
 and that of a cult of=20

"Humanity" or "Space."  Shadows and figments, as they appear to us to be in=
 themselves these=20

attempts to provide a substitute for religion are of the highest importance=
, as showing that men of=20



great powers of mind, who have thoroughly broken loose not only from Christ=
ianity but from=20

natural religion and in some cases placed themselves in violent antagonism =
to both, are still=20

unable to divest themselves of the religious sentiment or to appease its cr=
aving for satisfaction.=20

There being no God, they find it necessary, as Voltaire predicted it would =
be, to invent one, not for=20

the purposes of police (they are far above such sordid Jesuitism), but as t=
he solution of the=20

otherwise hopeless enigma of our spiritual nature. Science takes cognizance=
 of all phenomena,=20

and this apparently ineradicable tendency of the human mind is a phenomenon=
 like the rest. The=20

thoroughgoing=20


_
as signs of the coming child would present themselves. A midwife came, cook=
ed three meals a=20

day, fed the children and helped keep the place in order.  In older times p=
eople taught their=20

children to respect older persons. They obeyed everyone older than themselv=
es. The large=20

children were just as obedient as the small ones so that it was not hard to=
 maintain peace and=20

order within any home.  The midwife in this case simply told all of the chi=
ldren that she did not=20

want any of them to go upstairs, as she had important papers spread out all=
 over the floor and did=20

not want philosophical exigencies, but he does it by denying Humanity as we=
ll as God and=20

reducing the difference between the organism of the human animal and that o=
f any other animal to=20

a mere question of complexity. Still, even in this quarter, there has appea=
red of late a disposition=20

to make concessions on the subject of human volition hardly consistent with=
 Materialism. Nothing=20

can be more likely than that the impetus of great discoveries has carried t=
he discoverers too far.=20

Perhaps with the promptings of the religious sentiment there is combined a =
sense of the=20

immediate danger=20


_
were asked, she was obeyed.  George does not remember having heard a single=
 cry the whole=20

time they were being born in that upper room, and he said many a baby was b=
orn there. Decorum=20

reigned throughout the household for six weeks or until their mother was re=
ady to come down.=20

When the time was up for sanction threatens social order and morality. As w=
e have said already,=20

the men of whom we specially speak are far above anything like social Jesui=
tism. We have not a=20

doubt but they would regard with abhorrence any schemes of oligarchic illum=
inism for guarding the=20

pleasures of the few by politic deception=20


_
come down, his father would casually say, "children your ma is coming home =
today and what do=20

you recon, someone has given her another baby." The children would say, alm=
ost in concert,=20

"what you say pa, is it a boy or girl?" He would tell them which it lay to =
heart the fact that the=20

existing morality, though not dependent on any special theology, any specia=
l view of the relations=20

between soul and body, or any special theory of future rewards and punishme=
nts, is largely=20

dependent on a belief in the=20


_
any further inquiry made into the happening.  The term "broke her leg" was =
used to convey the=20

meaning of pregnancy. George relates how his mother told him and his sister=
 not to have any=20

thing more to do with Mary Jones, "cause she done broke her leg." George sa=
id "Ma taint nothin=20

matter wid Mary; I conscience, and in that without which conscience can hav=
e no indefeasible=20

authority--the presence of a just and all-seeing God. It may be true that i=
n primaeval society these=20

beliefs are found only in the most rudimentary form, and, as social sanctio=
ns, are very inferior in=20

force to mere gregarious=20
