to treat of the choice of building sites for temples, the forum, and all other public places, with a 

view to general convenience and utility. If the city is on the sea, we should choose ground close to 

the harbour as the place where the forum is to be built; but if inland, in the middle of the town. For 

the temples, the sites for those of the gods under whose particular protection the state is thought 

to rest and for repulsive.  He looked somewhat like an invalid, yet his powerful frame and the 

action of his strong muscular hands were not in keeping with that idea.  The bride, although 

careworn and middle-aged, possessed a singularly sweet and attractive countenance--all the more 

attractive that it wore a habitual expression of sadness.  It was a sympathetic face, too, because it 

was the index to a loving, sympathetic, Christian

commanding a view of the greater part of the city. Mercury should be in the forum, or, like Isis and 

Serapis, in the emporium: Apollo and Father Bacchus near the theatre: Hercules at the circus in 

communities which have no gymnasia nor amphitheatres; Mars outside the city but at the training 

ground, and so Venus, but at the harbour. It is moreover shown by the Etruscan diviners in 

treatises on their science that the fanes of Venus, Vulcan, and Mars should be situated outside the 

walls, in order that the young men and married women may not become habituated in the city to 

the temptations incident to the worship of Venus, and that buildings may be free from the terror of 

fires through the religious rites and sacrifices which call the power of Vulcan beyond the walls. As 

for Mars, when that divinity is enshrined outside the walls, the citizens will never take up arms 

against each other, and he will defend the city from its enemies and save it from danger in war.  2. 

Ceres also should be outside the city in a place to which people need never go except for the 

purpose of sacrifice. That place should be under the protection of religion, purity, and good morals. 

Proper sites should be set apart for the precincts of the other gods according to the nature of the 

sacrifices offered to them.  The principle governing the actual construction of temples and their 

symmetry I shall explain in my third and fourth books. In the second I have thought it best to give 

an account of the materials used in buildings with their good qualities and advantages, and then in 

the succeeding books to describe and explain the proportions of buildings, their arrangements, 

and the different forms of symmetry.     BOOK II     INTRODUCTION   1. Dinocrates, an architect 

who was full of confidence in his own ideas and skill, set out from Macedonia, in the reign of 

Alexander, to go to the army, being eager to win the approbation of the king. He took with him 

from ever-varying indications of feeling, lightened and subdued and modified, but never quite 

removed, the sadness.  The two who composed the remainder of this wedding party were young 

men, apparently in a higher position of life than the principals.  The one was tall and strapping, the 

other rather small, but remarkably active and handsome.  It was evident that they were deeply 

interested in the ceremony in which they took part, and the smaller of the two appeared to enjoy 

some humorous reminiscences occasionally, to judge from the expression of his face when his 

glance chanced to meet that of his tall friend.  As they were leaving the altar, the bridegroom bent 

down and murmured in a deep soft voice--  "It's like a dream, Martha.  It ain't easy to believe that 

such good luck should come to the likes o' me."  The bride whispered something in reply, which 

was inaudible to those who followed.  "Yes, Martha, yes," returned the bridegroom; "no doubt it is 

as you put it.  But after all, there's only one of His sayin's that has gone right home to me.  I've got 

it by heart _now_--`I came not to call the righteous, but _sinners_ to repentance.'  'Twould have 

bin all up with me long ago but for that, Martha."  They reached the door at this point, got into a 

cab, and drove away. The remainder of the wedding party left the little church on foot.  The same 

evening on which this event took place, the strapping young man and the little active youth sat 

together at the open window of a comfortable though small parlour, enjoying a cup of tea.  The 

view from the window was limited, but it possessed the charm of variety; commanding as it did, a 

vista of chimney-pots of every shape and form conceivable--many of which were capped with 

those multiform and hideous contrivances, with which foolish man vainly endeavours to cure 

smoke.  "Well, Jim," asked the strapping youth, as he gazed pensively on this prospect, "what 

d'you think of it?"  "What do

received by them, he asked to be presented to Alexander as soon as possible. They promised, but 

were rather slow, waiting for a suitable opportunity. So Dinocrates, thinking that they were playing 

"The wedding, of course."  "It's hard to say," replied Jim, musing.  "He seemed to be such an 

unmitigated scoundrel when we first made his acquaintance that it is difficult to believe he is a 

changed man now."  "By which you mean to insinuate, Jim, that the Gospel is not sufficient for

lofty stature and pleasing countenance, finely formed, and extremely dignified. Trusting, therefore, 

to these natural gifts, he undressed himself in his inn, anointed his body with oil, set a chaplet of 

poplar leaves on his head, draped his left shoulder with a lion's skin, and holding a club in his right 

hand stalked forth to a place in front of the tribunal where the king was administering justice.  2. 

His strange appearance made the people turn round, and this led Alexander to look at him. In 

astonishment he gave orders to make way for him to draw near, and asked who he with such 

modified scoundrels as you and I were."  "By no means," replied Jim, with a peculiar smile; "but, 

d'you know, Bloater, I never can feel that we were such desperate villains as you make us out to 

have been, when we swept the streets together."  "Just listen to him!" exclaimed the Bloater, 

smiting his knee with his fist, "you can't _feel_!--what have _feelings_ to do with knowledge? Don't 

you _know_ that we were fairly and almost hopelessly _in the current_, and that we should 

probably have been swept off the face of the earth by this time if it had not been for

Macedonian architect, who brings thee ideas and designs worthy of thy renown. I have made a 

design for the shaping of Mount Athos into the statue of a man, in whose left hand I have 

represented a very spacious fortified city, and in his right a bowl to receive the water of all the 

streams which are in that mountain, so that it may pour from the bowl into the sea."  3. Alexander, 

delighted with the bald head and the kindly--"  "There, now, Bloater, don't let us have any more of 

that, you become positively rabid when you get upon that old gentleman, and you are conceited 

enough, also, to suppose that all the gratitude in the world has been shovelled into your own 

bosom.  Come, let us return to the point, what do I think of the wedding--well, I think a good deal of 

it. There is risk, no

inquired whether there were any fields in the neighbourhood that could maintain the city in corn. 

On finding that this was impossible without transport from beyond the sea, "Dinocrates," quoth he, 

"I appreciate your design as excellent in composition, and I am delighted with it, but I apprehend 

that anybody who should found a city in that spot would be censured for bad judgement. For as a 

newborn babe cannot be nourished without the nurse's milk, nor conducted to the approaches that 

lead to growth in life, so a city cannot thrive without fields and the fruits thereof think, moreover, 

that the marriage is founded on _true love_.  He never would have come to his present condition 

but for true love to Martha, which, in God's providence, seems to have been made the means of 

opening his mind to Martha's _message_, the pith of which message was contained in his last 

remark on leaving the church.  Then, as to Martha, our own knowledge of her would be sufficient 

to ease our minds as to her wisdom, even if it were not coupled with the reply she made to me 

when I expressed wonder that she should desire to marry such a man.  `Many waters,' she
