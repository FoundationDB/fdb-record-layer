with every chance=20

apparently of covering the length of the field for a touchdown. Coming from=
 the right was Teeny-

bits, but at first no one gave the new member of the scrub a thought, for D=
urant was a sprinter and=20

he was going down field at his best pace. To every one's surprise, however,=
 Teeny-bits held his=20

position and gradually began to force Durant nearer the side line. No one e=
lse was in the race.=20

The captain glanced sideways and saw who his pursuer was; he veered further=
 toward the left and=20

concentrated on speed; still Teeny-bits held his own. Then suddenly Durant,=
 seeing that the side-

line was dangerously close, shifted direction and tried to pass his pursuer=
. But Teeny-bits was not=20

to be evaded; he gathered himself and plunged, and next moment the captain =
of the big "team"=20

was down at the fifteen-yard line with his smaller opponent gripping him ti=
ghtly around the shins.=20

For the second time Neil Durant had a word of approval for the younger boy.=
  "Good work!" he=20

said. "You got me clean."  The scrub endeavored to live up to the pace that=
 Teeny-bits had set,=20

but they had shot their bolt and the first team pushed the ball over in thr=
ee tries and scored two=20

more touchdowns in the course of the next fifteen minutes.  One result of t=
he day's play was that=20

the scrub received some well-deserved praise; another was that Coach Murray=
 called Teeny-bits=20

carry an import that presaged the realization of one of his fondest hopes. =
 "Teeny-bits," said the=20

coach. "I'm going to pull you up to the first squad; you may not get a chan=
ce to play in many of the=20

games, but I think I can use you as a substitute back. That was a good tack=
le you made and a=20

good run, but you have a lot to learn yet. One thing is change of pace when=
 you carry the ball.   +--
