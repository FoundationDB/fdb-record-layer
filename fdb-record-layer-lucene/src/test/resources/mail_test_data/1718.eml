Beautiful, witty, and full of graces and caprices essentially feminine, as well as of some masculine qualities, she yet appears to have inspired no love, nothing but dread, in _
his brother_, when ye were ignorant _of what would be the result of the case of Joseph?_[243] 

They replied, _after they had recognised him (desiring confirmation)_, Art thou indeed Joseph? He 

answered, I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God hath been gracious unto us, _by bringing us 

together_; for whosoever feareth _God_ and is patient [will be rewarded]: God will not suffer the 

reward of the well-doers to perish. They replied, By God, verily God hath preferred thee above us, 

and we have been indeed sinners. He said, [There shall be] no reproach [cast] on you this day: 

God forgive you; for He is the most merciful of those that show mercy. _And he asked them 

respecting his father: so they answered, His eyes are gone. And he said_, Go ye with this my shirt 

(_it was the shirt of Abraham, which he wore when he was cast into the fire: it was on his_ [that is, 

Joseph's] _neck_ [appended as an amulet] _in the well; and it was from paradise: Gabriel 

commanded him to send it, and said, In it is its odour_ [that is, the odour of paradise], _and it shall 

not be cast upon any one afflicted_ [with a disease] _but he shall be restored to health_), and cast 

it [said Joseph] upon the face of my father: he shall recover his sight; and bring unto me all your 

family.--And when the company of travellers had gone forth _from El-'Areesh[244] of Egypt_, their 

father said, _unto those who were present of his offspring_, Verily I perceive the smell of Joseph 

(_for the zephyr had conveyed it to him, by permission of Him whose name be exalted, from the 

distance of three days' journey, or eight, or none of them seem to have had faith in her or affection 

for her, and the two brothers, Henry and Robert, soon became reconciled to each other and made 

a joint invasion of their father's dominions, pillaging his castles and territories. The poor king, after 

many ravages had been committed, at length bribed his sons to let him sing his last hymns in 

peace. Henry was to succeed to the throne, and Robert became Duke of Burgundy.  The peace 

thus made did not long outlast King Robert. He died in July, 1031, and the monks mourned their 

friend and protector, and many of the poor sincerely bewailed the loss of their "good father"; but 

there is no sign of any excessive grief on the part of Constance. She soon gave the kingdom 

cause to mourn in other fashion; for no sooner was Henry I. seated on his throne than his mother 

began to stir up rebellion against him. She had always been violent in private as in public life, and 

treated Henry in particular "as if she hated him like a stepmother." Her intrigues now were so far 

successful that she won over to her side most of the direct vassals of the crown, and the greater 

number of the towns in the duchy of France declared themselves in favor of placing Robert, Duke 

of Burgundy, on the throne. By surrendering the county of Sens to her old enemy, Eudes, Count of 

Blois, Constance gained his aid. This plot of a mother against her son was successful in all but 

one main point: the other son, in whose name she was preparing to wage civil war, took no active 

part against his brother, and appears to have remained quietly in Burgundy. Perhaps he was wise 


_
_ye would believe me._ They replied, By God, thou art surely in thine old error. And when the 

messenger of good tidings (_namely, Judah_) came _with the shirt_ (_and he had borne the 

bloody shirt; wherefore he desired to rejoice him, as he had grieved him_), he cast it upon his 

face, and he recovered his sight. [Thereupon Jacob] said, Did I not say unto you, I know, from 

God, what ye know not? They said, O our father, ask pardon of our crimes for us; for we have 

been sinners. He replied, I will ask pardon for you of my Lord; for He is the Very forgiving, the 

Merciful.--_He delayed doing so until the first appearance of the dawn_, _that the prayer might be 

more likely to be answered; or, as some say, until the night of_ [that is, preceding] _Friday_. 

_They then repaired to Egypt, and Joseph and the great men came Constance was really 

scheming for was the continuance of her own power, and that if placed on the throne he would 

have been completely under her control.  In this crisis of the affairs of the kingdom, Henry, fleeing 

with a following of but twelve vavasours, called upon Normandy for aid; and most effective aid he 

had from one whose name was to become famous, a nucleus for the gathering of romance. This 

was Duke Robert of Normandy, surnamed Robert the Devil, who carried on a predatory warfare so 

savage and so successful that most of the revolted lords near the borders of Normandy "bowed 

their heads before him." Old Foulques Nerra, probably in one of his edifying fits of repentance, at 

length brought Constance to a reconciliation with Henry, reproaching her with the brutal fury with 

which she was treating her son. 


_
to meet them_; and when they went in unto Joseph, _in his pavilion or tent_, he received unto him 

(_or pressed unto him_) his parents (_his father and his mother and his maternal aunt_), and said 

unto _them_, Enter ye Misr, if God please, in safety.[245] _So they entered; and Joseph seated 

himself upon his couch_, and he caused his much unhappiness to her husband and to her sons, 

did not long survive the peace, dying at Melun in July, 1032. Her ally Eudes continued the struggle 

some little while, but was at last vanquished and forced to disgorge half of the county of Sens 

which Constance had given him as a bribe.  Thus ends the life of one of the first of the French
