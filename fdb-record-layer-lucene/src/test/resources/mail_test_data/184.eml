enough in his legs to wield a heavy boot with almost terrible force.  This =
barber had acquired a=20

degree of influence over sterling, honest working men by his reputed incorr=
uptibility to an extent=20

that he would not otherwise have gained, so that it became rather important=
 to obtain his support=20

on behalf of our candidate.  At the commencement of the struggle it was bel=
ieved that John=20

Shufflebotham would, as a matter of course, vote for our candidate; but thi=
s was a miscalculation.=20

It appeared that something had turned the current of his political sympathi=
es. He was down in the=20

former poll-book as having voted for the Liberals, and so it was expected t=
hat he would vote again,=20

bringing with him to the hustings about twenty honest fellows who believed =
in him.  On the=20

contrary, he soon intimated that he had come to believe the Whigs were a li=
ttle worse than the=20

Tories. aggregate now amounts to about $9,000,000. Next is Minnesota with $=
7,000,000, and=20

Missouri and Mississippi with about $4,000,000 each. Missouri is first in r=
espect to loss of life, and=20

Mississippi next. The months most liable to tornadoes are May, April, June,=
 and July, in order; and=20

the time of day the hottest; that is, from 3 to 5 P.M.  These data suffice =
to show the peculiar acts of=20

the tornado in our land. There is one case of a great storm attended by tor=
nadoes on its southeast=20

border, that is even more noteworthy than the great one so minutely detaile=
d in the preceding=20

pages. A storm center passing over a wider region, on February 9, 1884, pro=
duced, after ten=20

o=E2=80=99clock that day, over sixty tornadoes in Mississippi, Alabama, Geo=
rgia, South Carolina, Kentucky=20

and Tennessee, and North Carolina. Over ten thousand buildings were destroy=
ed, eight hundred=20

people=20


_
of them, for poor working men like him or any of his customers, but that th=
ey (the Whigs and=20

Tories) were both thieves. If he must vote, he would turn and turn about. P=
erhaps he should be=20

inclined to give the Tories a turn this time; but he didn't know. He wasn't=
 at all sure about it either=20

way.  This man's defection from our cause produced a little alarm. The feel=
ing of which he=20

appeared to be the exponent was also, upon inquiry, found rather more exten=
sive than was at first=20

thought possible. It ran beyond the pale or circle of the barber's supposed=
 influence; and to make=20

matters rather worse, the barber, when assailed by a patron for apostasy, o=
r urged to stand by his=20

old colours, was compelled, as he said, to argufy in wounded. The damage do=
ne by any single=20

one was small, while the aggregate was fearful.  The tornado is occasionall=
y seen in Europe: but=20

in the few instances recorded, it has been much smaller, and moved much slo=
wer than the same=20

sort of storm in America, though quite as powerful within the territory tra=
versed. One that was very=20

formidable, was observed near Boulogne, in 1822. It moved about irregularly=
 for an hour, tearing=20

holes in the ground, snapping off trees, and twisting down houses; yet, it =
was not twenty-five feet=20

in diameter. Another one in 1872, swept through a little town in Italy, and=
 was so powerful as to=20

twist iron balcony railings together like so many skeins of thread. Several=
 persons were killed.  In=20
