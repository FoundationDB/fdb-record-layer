 had a right to do, or went farther into the wilderness where the hunting a=

So swift and terrible was its coming that the doe upon whom it sprang was b=

The great cat did not wait for it to recover, but with claw and fang soon t=
hrottled it, while the rest of=20

the herd fled at a breakneck pace, their white flags up.  Here was game alr=
eady killed.  The great=20

cat was not over a third as heavy as Black Bruin.  It would doubtless run a=
way at his approach as=20

did everything else.  So thought the bear as he rushed in to take the kill =
from the cougar, but he=20

had reckoned without his host.  The panther was so intent upon its own game=
 that it did not notice=20

the approach of the bear until the rival hunter was within thirty feet of t=
he prize.  Then it wheeled=20

about and was instantly transformed into a demon.  Its tail lashed its side=
s, its fangs were bared in=20

the ugliest snarl that Black Bruin had ever faced and its eyes fairly blaze=
d.  Black Bruin backed off=20

a few feet to get a better look at the terrible stranger.  He had not expec=
ted opposition and such=20

effrontery was new to him.  But the panther continued to lash her sides wit=
h her tail and to glare=20

and snarl, so the bear circled about and about, trying to get behind his ad=
versary.  champion of=20

God? But then the question of the churches interferes. If there were only o=
ne church, I could see=20

my way. Without a church, there can be no true religion, because otherwise =
you have no security=20

for the truth. I am a member of the Church of England, and when I was at Ox=
ford I thought the=20

Anglican view might be sustained. But, of late, I have given ray mind deepl=
y to these matters, for,=20

after all, they are the only matters a man should think of; and, I confess =
to you, the claim of Rome=20

to orthodoxy seems to me irresistible.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou make no disti=
nction, then, between religion and=20

orthodoxy?=E2=80=9D said Theodora.  =E2=80=9CCertainly I make no difference=
.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAnd yet, what is orthodox at Dover=20

is not orthodox at Calais or Ostend. I should be sorry to think that, becau=
se there was no=20

orthodoxy in Belgium or France, there was no religion.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CY=
es,=E2=80=9D said Lothair, =E2=80=9CI think I see what you=20

mean.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen again, if we go further,=E2=80=9D continued T=

certainly is not orthodox, according to your views. You may not agree with =
all or any of their=20

opinions, but you could scarcely maintain that, as communities, they are ir=
religious.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, you=20

could not,=20


_
giving up the kill, the bear went in search of other game.  But he was not =
afraid of the great cat,=20

only astonished and curious. He knew quite well that the deer did not belon=
g to him and this may=20

have kept him from picking a quarrel.  If he had met the cat in any of the =
forest highways and it=20

had disputed his right to any of the privileges of the ancient woods, he wo=
uld have given battle.=20

So he was still the king of the mountain, although he had left the cat in f=
ull possession of the deer.=20

Spring and summer came and went.  The blueberries ripened in the pastures a=
nd scant clearings,=20

and the blackberries along the edge of the woods.  All the  =E2=80=9CSo you=
 see,=E2=80=9D said Theodora, =E2=80=9Cwhat is=20

view is,=E2=80=9D said Theodora. =E2=80=9CI do not belong to the Roman or t=

are very religious,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CI hope so; I try to be=
 so; and, when I fail in any duty, it is not the=20
