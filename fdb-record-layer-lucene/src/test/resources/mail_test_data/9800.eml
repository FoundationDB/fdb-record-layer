No--she frowned--it had been real, pretty ugly while it lasted. But like a =
bug-a-boo it had gone. And=20

this good, safe man had become transformed in this amazing intimacy and had=
 become a wild=20

delight: a man to laugh at, tease, provoke, and cling to, silent, in a flam=
e; a man to mother, study=20

out, probe into deep with questions; a man to plan and plan with.  "This lo=
ve is to be the love of his=20

life! It's to make us work and grow, make us fine and awake and alive to ev=
erything worth living=20

for! No laziness for you, my dear, no soft, cosy kitten life! You're to be =
a woman, a real one! Don't=20

let there be any mistake about that!"  In the other room Joe was at his pia=
no, and the music he=20

was playing had nothing to do with--any one else. She did not say, "with Am=
y." She frowned a little=20

and cut herself short, as she so often did in her thinking, these days, whe=
n it touched upon her=20

sister. She could feel Amy here at so many points, and she did not want to =
be jealous.  "I wonder=20

where we're going tonight."  What was it Joe was playing? Music she had hea=
rd before. She did=20

not like to ask him and so betray her ignorance. "I ought to know this! Wha=
t is it?" she asked=20

herself impatiently. "Why, of course! It's from 'Boheme'!" She smiled as sh=
e felt he was playing to=20

her. With the thrill now so familiar, she felt her power over him. She reme=
mbered little tussles in=20

which she had been victorious. They had all been over his business. Joe, th=
e poor darling, had=20

formed the idea (she did not say from his first wife) that if a man is in l=
ove with a woman he must=20

express it by loading her down with things which cost a lot of money, that =
he must work for her,=20

slave for her! But Ethel was putting an end to that. They had taken back Su=
sette's old nurse, for it=20

was unfair to one's husband to be a child's slave if there was no need. But=
 she had refused to get=20

other servants. Emily Giles was still in charge, and though Emily of her ow=
n accord had gone to a=20

shop on Fifth Avenue and purchased caps and aprons, "the nattiest things th=
is side of France,"=20

she wore them with a genial air and spoke of them as "my uniform." Ethel to=
ok care of her own=20

room and helped Emily with the cleaning. She had kept expenses firmly down,=
 and she had=20

refused to be loaded with gifts. When Joe had urged that his affairs were g=
oing so much better=20

now, she had said in her new decisive voice:  "I'm so glad to hear it, my l=
ove, for it simply means=20

you've no earthly excuse for staying late at your office. I don't mean I wa=
nt you to loaf, you know,"=20

she had gone on more earnestly. "I want you to work and do, oh, so much, al=
l the things you=20

dreamed of doing--over there in Paris. But I'm not going to have you make y=
our business a mere=20

rush for a lot of money we don't need!" She had gone to him suddenly. "And =
just now I want you=20

so."  By these talks she had already worked a change. No more hasty breakfa=
sts to let him be off=20

by eight o'clock. They had breakfasted later and later each day; she had ma=
de an affair of=20

breakfast. And as at last he kissed her and tore himself away from his home=
, she had smiled to=20

herself delightedly at the guilty look in his eyes. This kind of thing woul=
d cause a decided=20

coolness, no doubt, between Joe and his partner. So much the better, she ha=
d thought, for she=20

detested that man Nourse, and in his case she could quite openly admit, "I'=
m jealous of you and=20

your business devotion! Your time is coming soon, friend Bill!" The office =
was half way uptown,=20

and several times in the last few weeks she had gone there for Joe at five =
o'clock, and once at=20

four-thirty, as though by appointment. She chuckled now as she recalled the=
 black look of his=20

partner that day. Yes, four-thirty had been a blow!  "Where are we going th=
is evening?"  It was=20

delightful to be so free, she told herself repeatedly. Friends? They didn't=
 need any friends. For the=20

present they had each other--enough! "Yes, and for some time to come!" But =
there always came=20

to her a little qualm of uneasiness when her thinking reached this point. H=
ow were friends to be=20



found in this city?  "Oh, later--later--later!"  And rising impatiently wit=
h a shrug, she went into the=20

nursery. The nurse had been so glad to get back that most of her old hostil=
ity toward Ethel had=20

vanished. Still there were signs now and then of a sneer which said, "You'l=
l soon be paying no=20

more attention to this poor bairn than her mother did before you." And it w=
as as well to show the=20

woman how blind and ignorant she was--to make her see the difference.   "Bo=
heme" was the=20

surprise that night. It was Ethel's first night at the opera. And looking u=
p at the boxes, at the=20

women she had read about, the gorgeous gowns and the jewels they wore, and =
watching them=20

laugh and chatter; or looking far above them to the dim tiers of galleries =
reaching up into the dark;=20

or again with eyes glued on the stage feasting upon Paris, art, "Bohemia," =
youth and romance;=20

squeezing her companion's hand and in flashes recollecting dazzling little =
incidents of the fortnight=20

just gone by--her mind went roving into the future, finding friends and wid=
e rich lives shimmering=20

and sparkling like the sunlight on the sea. As that Italian music rose, all=
 at once she wanted to give=20

herself, "To give and give and give him all!" The tears welled up in her ha=
ppy eyes.  "However! To=20

be very gay!"  Later that evening in a cafe she leaned across the table and=
 asked excited=20

questions about "Boheme" and Paris. What was Paris really like? The Latin Q=
uarter, the Beaux=20

Arts? What did he do there, how did he live? In what queer and funny old ro=
oms? Did he live alone=20

or with somebody else? Something was clutching now at her breast. (Farrar h=
ad sung "Mimi" that=20

night). "Don't be silly!" she told herself. "Oh, Joe!" she said, and she lo=
oked down at the fork in her=20

hand which she was fingering nervously. Then she looked quickly up and smil=
ed. "What man did=20

you room with? Any one?" He was smiling across the table still. "You inquis=
itive woman," said his=20

eyes.  "No, I lived alone," he replied. "And I sat at a drafting board--wit=
h a sweater on--it used to=20

be cold."  "Oh, you poor dear!"  "And I worked," he continued, "like a bull=
 pup. And along toward=20

morning I tied a wet towel around my head--"  "Oh, Joe!" Ethel's foot press=
ed his, and they=20

laughed at each other. "But there must have been," she cried, "so much besi=
des! Joe Lanier, you=20

are lying! There were cafes--and student balls and fancy dress--and singing=
--and queer streets at=20

night!"  "That's so," he answered solemnly, "the city of Paris did have str=
eets. You walked on=20

them--from place to place."  "Joe Lanier--"  "First you put the right foot =
forward, then the left--you=20

moved along."  "Joe! For goodness sakes!"  "Look here. Do you know what I w=
ant to do with you?"=20

"No." And Ethel shook her head. She did know, precisely, and it was her mot=
ive for all this talk.=20

"Take you there--and get rooms in the Quarter--not too far from the Luxembo=
urg--"  "Oh, Joe, you=20

perfect darling!"  He went on describing all they would do, in the cafes an=
d on the streets, in old=20

churches and at plays and at the Opera Comique, where she must surely see "=
Louise." They=20

began excitedly planning ways and means, expenses, his business and when he=

=E2=80=94The following law has=20

been enacted whose practical application does not begin until March 1st, 18=
94:]  MEDICAL=20

COUNCIL.=E2=80=94The law provides for a medical council of the State (Act o=
f May 18th, 1893, s. 1).  The=20

council is to supervise the examinations conducted by the State boards of m=
edical examiners for=20

licenses to practise medicine and surgery, and issue licenses to applicants=
 who shall have=20

presented satisfactory and properly certified copies of licenses from the S=

examiners or State boards of health of other States, or who shall have succ=

).  MEDICAL=20

BOARDS.=E2=80=94From and after March 1st, 1894, there are to be three separ=
ate boards of medical=20

examiners, one representing the medical society of the State, one represent=

medical society of the State, and one representing the eclectic medical soc=
iety of the State. Each=20

board is to consist of seven members appointed by the governor from the ful=

of the said medical societies, and is to be composed exclusively of members=
 of the same medical=20

society. Each appointee must be a registered physician in good standing, an=
d shall have practised=20

medicine or surgery under the laws of the State for not less than=20


_
that, and she cried to herself, "Now he's thinking of his friend Bill! Oh, =
what a detestable, tiresome=20

worm!"   Then a man who was passing their table stopped in surprise as he r=
ecognized Joe,=20

bowed, smiled and said something and went on, and joined a hilarious group =
down the room. And=20

Ethel saw him speak to them and she felt their glances turned her way. Joe =
had grown suddenly=20

awkward, his face wore a forced, unnatural smile, and he was talking rapidl=
y--but she heard=20

nothing that he said. The whole atmosphere had changed in an instant.   For=
 those people over=20

there were some of Amy's friends, no doubt, amused at Joe and his young sec=
ond wife, amused=20

that Joe had not had the nerve to ask them to his wedding. Ethel could feel=
 herself burning inside.=20

A mistake not to have asked them? No! What had they to do with it? What rig=
ht had they, what=20

hold on Joe? They had been a mighty poor lot of friends, with empty minds a=
nd money hearts, just=20

clothes and food, late hours and wine! They had been decidedly bad for him,=
 had drawn him off=20

from his real work and plunged him into the rush to be rich! A voice within=
 her, from underneath,=20

was asking, "Or was it Amy?" But she paid no heed to that. It asked, "Are y=
ou sure they are all so=20

bad? Have you taken the trouble to find out?" But angrily she answered that=
 she wanted friends of=20

her own, that she couldn't be just a second wife. "I've got to be all diffe=
rent, new! I've got to be--

and I will, I will!" She swallowed fiercely. Besides, it was what Joe neede=
d, exactly! He showed=20

already what it had meant to be rid of such friends! Had he ever talked of =
Paris before, or his=20

dreams and ambitions or anything real? But the voice retorted sharp and cle=
ar:  "Why hide it then?=20

Why let this foolish dangerous habit of never mentioning Amy's name keep gr=
owing up between=20

you and your husband? It may do a lot of harm, you know. What are you afrai=
d of?"  Nothing=20

whatever, she replied. She decided to speak of it then and there. She would=
 be perfectly natural,=20

and ask him, "Who are your friends over there? Some people Amy used to know=
?" And she grew=20

rigid all at once. Her throat contracted and felt dry. Angrily she bit her =
lip . . . But the habit of=20

silence was too strong. . . . Soon, with a carefully pleasant smile, she wa=
s attending to his talk and=20

by her questions drawing out more and more of his life abroad.  "His work,"=
 she thought, "that's the=20

strongest thing to hold his mind away from those people." And soon she had =
him talking of the=20

Beaux Arts, architecture, plans and "periods" and "styles," things she was =
quite vague about, but=20

she did not have to listen now. That was always so safe, she told herself. =
She was even a little=20

jealous of this puzzling, engrossing work, which could so hold her husband'=
s mind. She frowned.=20

That was as it should be; a man's work was his own concern. But his living,=
 his home, what he did=20

at night?  "This can't go on," she decided. "There will have to be friends =
for both of us. I need=20

them, too. Oh, how I need one woman friend! And where shall I find her? Som=
ewhere in this city=20

there must be just the people I want--if only I could reach them!"  And pre=
sently she was saying=20

aloud in a lazy careless tone of voice:  "Sometimes I get wondering, Joe, i=
f there isn't a Paris in=20

New York."    CHAPTER XI  It was a few weeks later. A doctor had been there=
 and gone, and=20

returning into the living-room Ethel sank down on a chair with a quiet inte=
nsity in her eyes. For=20

some time she had not been feeling herself, but she did not want to worry J=
oe, and so at last she=20

had telephoned to the clergyman who had married her.  "You may not remember=
 me," she had=20

said, "but you married me in December. Perhaps you'll recall it if I say th=
ere were only three=20

friends at the church."  "Oh, yes, I remember it--perfectly."  "Thank you. =
I'm not quite well and I=20

have no friends to turn to, so I'm wondering if you could recommend a good =
doctor I could see."=20

The doctor recommended had just paid his visit. And now as the dusk deepene=
d she had the=20



strangest feelings. Her year and a half in the city seemed hurried and feve=
rish as a dream. Her=20

mind ran back into the past and on into the future. Only a few days before,=
 the round robin letter=20

had come again. In it the girl who had married the mining engineer out West=
 had told of having a=20

baby in a little town in Montana. Ethel had thought of the doctor then.  Sh=
e rose now and got the=20

letter and re-read it slowly. Presently she put it down and began crying so=
ftly, though she felt=20

neither sad nor frightened. Her life had so completely changed. All those g=
irl friends, so scattered;=20

all those years, so far behind. It was like getting on a ship, she thought,=
 to start across the ocean.=20

"You can't get off, you must go across. Oh, Ethel Lanier, how happy you'll =
be." But the happiness=20

seemed a long way off.  How quiet it was. The nurse came in with Susette fr=
om the park. Ethel=20

went into the nursery and kneeling down she began to unbutton Susette's lit=
tle jacket. The child's=20

plump face was so rosy and cold. She kissed it suddenly.  "Martha," she sai=
d, "I'll need you here=20

for a long time now. I'm going to have a baby."  She reddened then and held=
 her breath. Queer,=20

how she had blurted it out! She had not meant to tell any one yet. But the =
look of dawning joy and=20

relief in Martha's eyes made her glad she had spoken. Plainly the nurse had=
 been dreading the=20

time so fast approaching when she would have to leave Susette, who was now =
nearly four years=20

old. But all she said to Ethel was this:  "I'm glad to hear it, Mrs. Lanier=
. I hope you'll be very careful=20

now." She shot a look as keen as a knife, which asked, "Do you really want =
a child? Or are you=20

like her? Was it a mistake?"  And Ethel went quickly out of the room. In th=
e living-room her eye=20

In her cleaning she=20

had put it back. Emily, too, had put it back. They had never spoken Amy's n=
ame. But Ethel faced=20

the picture now for some moments steadily. Somehow it had lost its beauty, =
it looked weak and=20

soul-less, without power any longer over Ethel's future. "Poor Amy. Oh, how=
 much you missed."=20

And she added, "I'll never be like that." For an instant she let her mind d=
well on the past, on how=20

Susette's coming must have been--unwelcomed by her mother.  "But this one w=
ill be welcomed!=20

Our love is so--so different! This will bind us, oh, so close! It's done no=

had never felt it so before. The months of her marriage had been so excitin=
g, and even in the long=20

summer's thinking her love had seemed always a little unreal. "But this is =
real--inside of me!" Her=20

fancy went careering ahead, with joy and wonder, a thrill of dismay. "I was=
 so free, with my life to=20

each board is to hold two or more stated or special meetings in each year a=
fter due public notice.=20

A majority constitutes a quorum, but the examination may be conducted by a =
committee of one or=20

more members authorized by the board (_ib._, s. 9).  The boards not less th=
an one week prior to=20

each examination must submit to the council questions for thorough examinat=
ion in anatomy,=20

physiology, hygiene, chemistry, surgery, obstetrics, pathology, diagnosis, =
therapeutics, practice of=20

medicine, and materia medica; and the council must select therefrom the que=
stions for each=20

examination, and such questions for each examination shall be the same for =
all candidates, except=20

that in the departments of therapeutics, practice of medicine, and materia =
medica the questions=20

shall be in harmony with the teachings of the school selected by the candid=
ate (_ib._, s. 10).  The=20

examinations are to be in writing under rules prescribed by the council. Af=
ter an examination the=20



board must act on it without unnecessary delay and transmit to the council =
an official report of its=20

action stating the examination average of each candidate in each branch, th=
e general average,=20

and the result, and whether successful or unsuccessful. The report must emb=
race all the=20

examination papers, questions, and answers, which shall be kept for referen=
ce and inspection for=20

not less than five years (_ib._, s. 11).  QUALIFICATION.=E2=80=94The counci=
l must forthwith issue to=20

each applicant returned as having successfully passed said examination, and=
 adjudged by the=20

council to be duly qualified, a license to practise medicine and surgery. T=
he council must require=20

the same standard of qualifications from all candidates except in therapeut=
ics, practice of=20

medicine, and materia medica, in which the standard shall be determined by =
the boards=20

respectively. Before the license is issued, it must be recorded in a book i=
n the office of the council,=20

and the number of the book and page containing the record noted on the face=
 of the license; the=20

records shall have the same weight as evidence as that given to conveyance =
of land (_ib._, s. 12).=20

On and after July 1st, 1894, any person not theretofore authorized to pract=
ise medicine and=20

surgery in the State may deliver to the secretary of the council a written =
application for a license=20

 age, is of good moral=20

character, has obtained a competent common-school education, and has receiv=
ed a diploma=20

conferring the degree of medicine from some legally incorporated medical co=
llege of the United=20

States, or a diploma or license conferring the full right to practise all t=
he branches of medicine and=20

surgery in some foreign country. Applicants who have received their degree =
in medicine after July=20

1st, 1894, must have pursued the study of medicine for at least three years=
, including three regular=20

courses of lectures in different years in some legally incorporated medical=
 college or colleges prior=20

to the granting of said diploma or foreign license. Such proof shall be mad=
e, if required, upon=20

affidavit, and if the council is satisfied with the same it shall issue to =
the applicant an order for=20

examination before such one of the boards of examiners as the applicant may=
 select. In case of=20

failure at the examination the candidate, after the expiration of six month=
s and within two years,=20

shall have the privilege of a second examination by the same board without =
additional fee.=20

acquirements adopted by said board is substantially the same as is provided=
 by secs. 11, 12, and=20

13 of this act, shall without further examination receive a license conferr=
ing on the holder all the=20

rights and privileges provided by secs. 14 and 15 (_ib._, s. 13).  From and=
 after March 1st, 1894,=20

no person shall enter upon the practice of medicine or surgery unless he ha=
s complied with this=20

act and shall have exhibited to the prothonotary of the court of common ple=

prohibit the practice of medicine and surgery by any practitioner who shall=
 have been duly=20

registered before March 1st, 1894, according to the Act of June 8th, 1881, =

 grew into weeks and=20

months, the feeling of quiet remained with her. The pang of uneasiness as t=
o how she was to find=20

oe was thirty-six he=20

looked years younger. They could grow. Now she began asking him to read alo=
ud in the evenings,=20

nor was the reading all "mere fluff." Though she picked out amusing things =
to vary the monotony,=20

she insisted on magazines and books which had been recommended by the littl=
e history "prof" at=20

home, to whom Ethel wrote long letters. The books rather appalled her husba=
nd at times; but=20

using her new hold on him, she said:  "Go on, dear, now begin." And she pic=
ked up her sewing=20

with a look which said, "We've got to grow, you know, if we're ever to get =
friends worth while or=20

have a life worth living."  But again she would shut out all that, and smil=
e to herself and grow=20

absorbed. And this habit grew to such a degree that by the beginning of sum=
mer their reading=20

bees had come to an end. In June she took Martha and Susette and went to th=
e seashore for=20

three months. She came back in September, and now the time was drawing near=
. Her husband's=20

love grew anxious and there came troubled gleams in his eyes.  The trained =
nurse had arrived.=20

The doctor kept coming. Martha was plainly "in a state." And Emily Giles, f=
or all her grim ways,=20

had moments almost tender. All centering, swiftly centering, as the long vo=

ng in the practice of=20

medicine or surgery, before doing so, must submit their diplomas to a board=
 consisting of three=20

reputable physicians in each county. The board is appointed by the governor=
 on the=20

recommendation of the medical societies of the counties, and where no medic=
al society exists,=20

upon the recommendation of the senator and members of the House of Represen=
tatives for such=20

counties (Act of 1890, c. 454, s. 1).  The said board must examine said dip=
loma, when submitted,=20

and if the holder is a _bona fide_ holder, and if the college issuing said =
diploma is a reputable=20

medical college, and if he also submits a certificate of good moral charact=
er, the board must certify=20

to the fact, and upon such certificate the diploma shall be registered by t=

voices of its ceaseless life came into her window day and night, the hoots =
and distant bellows of=20

ships, the rattle of wheels, the rush of cars, the long swift thunder of th=
e "L," and bursts of laughter=20

from the streets, and animated voices. She remembered her first night in Ne=

her earlier visions of the city as a place of thrilling aspirations, wide, =
sparkling, abundant lives. And=20
