Ursula, or you will spoil all;' and when, in defiance of this injunction, I=
 did speak to Ursula, she=20

said, in a lackadaisical way, that she had no intention of marrying any one=
 at present; and when I=20

went on to say that in that case she had no business to accept you, she ask=
ed me what reason I=20

had for supposing that she ever had done so; and when I said, 'the assuranc=
e of my mother's ears=20

in the drawing-room at Dickiefield,' she stared at me with amazement, and b=
urst into a flood of=20

tears."  "Under these circumstances, don't you think you would have done be=
tter not to meddle in=20

the matter at all?" I remarked. "However, the mischief is done now, and per=
haps the best plan will=20

be for you to bring about a meeting between your sister and myself. I suppo=
se whatever we=20

arrange will satisfy you and Lady Broadhem?"  "Well, I don't know," said Br=
oadhem, doubtfully;=20

"she does not seem to know her own mind, and I don't feel very sure of you.=
 However, you are=20

master of the situation, and can arrange what you like. My mother is going =
to a May meeting at=20

Exeter Hall to-morrow to hear Caribbee Islands and Chundango hold forth. I =
know the latter is to=20

call for her at eleven, so if you will come at half-past, I will take care =
that you have an opportunity=20

of seeing Ursula alone."  This conversation took place as we were strolling=
 arm-in-arm down St=20

James's Street on our way to the House, thereby enabling the groups of our =
friends who inspected=20

us from divers club-windows to assert confidently the truth of the report. =
 Just as I was parting from=20

Broadhem at the door of the lobby we were accosted suddenly by Grandon. He =
looked very pale=20

as he grasped my hand and nodded to my companion, who walked off towards "a=
nother place"=20



without waiting for a further greeting. "I suppose, now that your marriage =
is publicly announced,=20

Frank, it need no longer be a tabooed subject between us, and that you will=
 receive my=20

congratulations."  My first impulse was to assure him that the announcement=
 was unauthorised so=20

far as I was concerned, but the prospect of the impending interview with Ur=
sula restrained me, and=20

I felt completely at a loss. "Don't you think, Grandon," I said, "that I sh=
ould have told you as much=20

as gossip=20

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any wo=
rd processing or=20

he official version posted=20

on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web I only ask you to trust me for ano=
ther twenty-four hours,=20

and I will tell you everything."  Grandon looked stern. "You are bound not =
to allow the report to go=20

one moment uncontradicted if there is nothing in it; and if there is, you a=
re now equally bound to=20

acknowledge it."  "Surely," I said, in rather a piqued tone, "Broadhem is a=
s=20

, a means of exporting a=20

or other form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenber=

 the matter as you are,=20

and he is satisfied with my conduct."  "I tell you fairly I am not," said G=
randon. "You will do Lady=20

Ursula a great injustice, and yourself a great injury, if you persist in a =
course which is distinctly=20

dishonourable."  At that moment who should come swaggering across the lobby=
 where we=20

happened to be standing but Larkington and Dick Helter! "Well, Frank, when =
is it to be?" said the=20

latter. "You were determined to take the world by surprise, and I must cong=
ratulate you on your=20

success."  "Thanks," said I, calmly, for I was smarting under Grandon's las=
t words: "the day is not=20

yet fixed. What between Lady Broadhem's scruples about Lent and some arrang=
ements I had to=20

make in Ireland, there has been a good deal of delay, but I think," I went =
on, with a slight simper,=20

"that it=20
