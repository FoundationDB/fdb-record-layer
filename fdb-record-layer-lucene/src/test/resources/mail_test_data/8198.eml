" she said; "I have always longed so to be one. If I really am, it will be =
all right about Poppy's money, for, of course, the public will try to buy m=

t he followed the seas?"  "I ain't able to say, exactly, but it wa'n't long=
 after Adoniah left home."  "Cap'n Pott, Mr. Fox knew your half-brother phi=
lodendron monstera enough."  Jasmine laughed.  "I do hope I am a genius," s=
he said; "I have always longed so to be one. If I really am, it will be all=

-" He sniffed a contemptuous conclusion.  "How many years ago was it that h=
e followed the seas?"  "I ain't able to say, exactly, but it wa'n't long af=
ter Adoniah left home."  "Cap'n Pott, Mr. Fox knew your half-brother _
will gladly take a magazine in which you appear. Thus you gain the advantag=
e of having your story=20

widely read and published not at your own expense."  "But please--" began J=
asmine.  "If I might=20

speak who am brought here for the purpose," here burst from Poppy, "what pa=
y is the young lady=20

to have for the words of genius that she has wrote upon the paper? Yes, Mis=
s Jasmine, you said I=20

was to let my voice be heard here--I'm not afraid, not of nobody, and here,=
 I puts down my foot,=20

and I says, 'What's the pay?'"  "The pay?" echoed the editor. "Surely the y=
oung lady does not=20

expect to be paid for anything so very amateur--no, she cannot expect to be=
 paid in money--in=20

another way she is paid, and largely; she obtains a reputation, and what im=
mature talent she has=20

is brought to the fore! I am afraid, Miss Mainwaring, I must not take up an=
y more of your valuable=20

time--I think I have explained myself quite clearly--do you accept my offer=
? If you are willing to=20

become a subscriber for one hundred copies monthly of _The Joy-bell_ your s=
tory shall appear; if=20

not, I must return you your MS. with regret."  Poor Jasmine's white little =
face grew piteous.  "Oh,=20

Poppy!" she began.  "Do you want it, Miss Jasmine?" said Poppy. "I calls it=
 a cheat; but do you=20

want it?"  "Oh, dear Poppy, I thought my words would look so lovely in Prin=
t--I am disappointed!"=20

"Then you shan't be, Miss Jasmine, darling. Here, sir, you're another of th=
e Aunt Flint tribe, but my=20

darling Miss Jasmine shall not look as she does now if I can prevent it. Pl=
ease, sir, will you look in=20

this here little purse given to you by the honest hand of toil, and see if =
it contains the price of a=20

hundred of those nasty _Joy-bells_. There's my three months' wage in that p=
urse, sir, so I expect it=20

will prove sufficient."  The editor opened the little purse gingerly.  "Do =
you wish your friend to=20

subscribe for you?" he asked, looking  "Don't tell me his last name was Phi=
llips?"  "Sartin was....=20

What was that you said, Mack?"  "I didn't speak. I was just thinking."  "I'=
d a heap sight rather you'd=20

speak out loud than grunt like that. What in tarnation is the matter with y=
ou?"  "If you can throw=20

any light on this man Phillips, I wish you'd do it. I've heard his name men=
tioned twice, by two=20

different people, with quite different effects."  "What do you mean by me t=
hrowing light on him?"=20

"Tell me about him, all you know, good and bad. What does Miss Pipkin know =
about him? Where=20

is he?"  "Heave to, there, Mack! One at a time. I don't know if Clemmie has=
 any idea where he is=20

now. She was purty thick with him once, and heerd from him once or twice af=
ter he went off to=20

sea."  "She was in love with him?"  "That's putting it purty tame. I cal'la=
te--Say, has she been=20

speaking to you about him?" asked the seaman eagerly.  The minister nodded.=
 "I'm breaking a=20

promise to her by talking with you about it, but----"  "Breaking a promise =
you made to Clemmie?=20

How's that?"  "She made me promise to say nothing to you. But I must. This =
thing is getting too=20

interesting for me to keep my hands off any longer."  "You mean she made yo=
u say that you'd not=20

tell me that she was in love with Adoniah? That's funny, ain't it? Why, I k=
new----" He broke off=20

abruptly, a new light coming into his tired eyes. He leaned forward and whi=
spered hoarsely:=20

"Mack, it ain't likely she's in love with--well,--with any other feller, is=
 it?"  "She didn't----"  "With me,=20

for example," broke in the seaman. "You don't think maybe that was the reas=
on she made you=20

give that promise, do you?" The Captain made no effort to hide his eagernes=
s. "I don't mind telling=20

you that I love Clemmie. I loved her long afore Adoniah come along and sp'i=
led it. He was smarter=20

than me, and went to school. He was real bright and handsome. It wa'n't tha=
t Clemmie loved him,=20

Jasmine. "I will allow you to have the first instalment at a reduction. The=
 full price for a hundred=20

copies of _The Joy-bell_ at sixpence a copy will be, of course, fifty shill=
ings. On this occasion you=20

shall have these delivered to you at your residence for forty-five shilling=
s."  "It's in the purse, sir,"=20

said Poppy, with an air of modest pride. "Forty-five shillings, and fifteen=
 shillings over, for my wage=20

with Aunt Flint comes exactly to three pounds a quarter. The fifteen shilli=
ngs will find me in boots=20

and house shoes, Miss Jasmine; and as my 'at is fresh trimmed, and I have e=
nough cotton=20

dresses to go on with, you are more than welcome to the two pound five."  "=
We will arrange it so,=20

then," said the editor. "Miss Mainwaring, you must give me your address, an=
d you shall receive=20

proofs in a day or two. This sum of money provides for the appearance of th=
e first instalment of=20

your story. From the sale of the hundred copies you will be provided with f=
unds for the second=20

instalment, and so on."  "But how am I to pay Poppy back if I must give you=
 the money that I get=20

for the magazines?" asked Jasmine, her face becoming more crimson each mome=
nt.  "Ah! that,"=20

said the editor, with a slightly sarcastic smile, "that is surely not my af=
fair."  After this a few=20

comparatively trivial arrangements were made. Jasmine gave the address of t=
he Palace Beautiful=20

to Mr. Potter, and walked downstairs, feeling excited, pleased, and disappo=
inted.  "Oh, Poppy!"=20

she said, "how light, how very light your purse is."  "No, Miss Jasmine," a=
nswered Poppy, "you're=20

out altogether there, for fifteen shillings in silver weighs more than thre=
e pounds in gold. It's my=20

heart, not my purse, that's light, Miss Jasmine--it has done me a sight of =
good to help you, Miss=20

Jasmine; I know he is a cheat in there, but never mind, when your pretty, b=
eautiful tale appears=20

there'll be a run on it, I think, and that _Joy-bell_ will be asked for hig=
h and low. You'll pay me=20

back, never fear, and I'll be real proud to my dying day to feel that I was=
 the first to help you."  That=20

evening, as Jasmine and Daisy sat together waiting for Primrose to return, =
Daisy said suddenly--=20

"Did you soar to-day, Jasmine, when you took Poppy's wages to have your sto=
ry printed?--was=20

that what you call a soaring flight?"  Daisy spoke innocently, and with rea=
l desire for information,=20

but at her words Jasmine covered her face and burst into tears.  "What a cr=
uel remark, Eyebright,"=20

she said. "Do you know I'm quite miserable about this; I've been getting mo=
re and more wretched=20

ever since I left that man's office. Suppose, Daisy, I don't sell a hundred=
 copies of _The Joy-bell_;=20

then I shall never be able to have any more of my story printed, and I shal=
l never have it in my=20

power to pay Poppy back. I think I must have yielded to temptation that tim=
e; perhaps I'm nothing=20

but a vain little girl, and think myself cleverer than I am."  "Oh, I'm sur=
e you're a difference. And I=20

know right well he didn't love her. He had took a spite against me because =
I was left the home=20

place, and he took it out on me by stealing my girl. You don't s'pose she s=
ees now that he didn't=20

really care----" He slowly settled back into his chair, and shook his head.=
 "I cal'late that ain't=20

possible. You heerd what she said about his sacred memory this morning. Goo=
d Lord! Why won't=20

she ever forget!"  "She may some day, Cap'n. No man can predict to-day what=
 a woman may do=20

to-morrow."  "The most of 'em are that way, but Clemmie's different from th=
e common run. I know=20

I'm an old fool for wishing it, but it ain't easy to give up the woman you =
love, even after long years=20

of her saying no to you."  "You're right, Cap'n. It isn't easy to give up t=
he woman you love."  The=20

minister gave the fire a vigorous poke, sending a thick shower of sparks up=
 the chimney. The=20

seaman glanced at him.  "Have you the slightest idea where your brother is?=
"  "No. I ain't heerd=20

from him for more than twenty years, and then it wa'n't direct. He left bec=
ause he was 'feared=20

Clemmie was going to make him marry her, and he knew if he took to sailing =
the seas she'd never=20



foller him. Damn him! He didn't treat her square. That's why I don't have m=
uch use for him. If he'd=20

told her out and out that he wa'n't going to marry her, I'd forgive him. Bu=
t----"  "Did Mr. Fox know=20

this half-brother?"  "About as well as he knew the rest of us about town. H=
e always was sort of=20

h'ity-t'ity, Jim was."  "Did he know him better after they left Little Rive=
r?"  "Mack, I ain't got your=20

tack, yet. Mind telling me where you're heading?"  "You asked me once if an=
ything out of the=20

ordinary took place that night I dined at the Fox home. Do you remember?"  =
"Yes, I rec'lect I did=20

ask you something like that. But----"  "You may also recall that you sugges=
ted that what happened=20

to Mr. Fox took place in his head instead of in his heart."  "Yes, I said t=
hat, too. But, Mack----"=20

"Just wait, and I'll tell you what this is all about. I had mentioned to Ha=
rold that I was born in=20

Australia----"  "Mack!" The Captain was out of his chair in one bound. "You=
 born in Australia? Why=20

in tarnation didn't you ever tell me that afore?"  The minister looked puzz=
led. "My announcement=20

had a similar effect on the Elder."  "Go on, Mack. Don't mind me. I'm a mit=
e narvous. All unstrung,=20

I cal'late."  "As I said I had just mentioned that fact to Harold, and the =
conversation naturally turned=20

back to the days of the early traders who went to that country. Harold then=
 told his father that the=20

law firm, of which he has recently been made a junior member, had put him o=
n a case which=20

necessitated his going over to Australia. It seems that they had been tryin=
g to clear it up for a long=20

time. The case came from Sydney, and had been referred to him because he ha=
d once spent=20

some time over there. It was when he mentioned the name of the client that =
Mr. Fox nearly=20


_
have studied your face a great deal; in the story-books I generally notice =
that the geniuses have=20

the same kind of face that you have--they generally have a little disconten=
ted, surprised look about=20

them. I admire the expression very much myself, and sometimes when I'm alon=
e--for you know=20

you and Primrose have to leave me a good deal alone--I try to practice it b=
efore the glass. I think=20

it's mostly done with a rise of the fainted."  Mr. McGowan gave the fire an=
other vigorous poke=20

before continuing. The Captain slid to the edge of his chair, holding on to=
 the sides.  "Do you know=20

of all the movements of Mr. Fox after he left here?" came the disappointing=
 question from near the=20

fireplace.  "No, I don't. But you was speaking of the case from Sydney, Mac=
k. Who was the feller=20

whose name hit Jim so hard?"  "Was Mr. Fox a sailor?"  "Lordie!"=20
