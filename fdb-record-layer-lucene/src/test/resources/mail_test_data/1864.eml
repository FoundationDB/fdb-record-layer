When the little head bobbed forward two or three times a good-natured neigh=

round the child, and after a little even took her into her arms, where Dais=

deep  "Father,"--her breath came in short gasps,--"you have no right to kee=

man as you say this Phillips person is. There is but one thing for us to do=
: go at once to Uncle=20

 what you want."  "But,=20

eeming to the=20

exasperated passengers scarcely to move at all; but all these weary hours D=
aisy slumbered=20

peacefully, and when she awoke the sun was shining brightly, and a new day =
had begun.  "Well,=20

my dear, you have had a hearty sleep," said the good-natured woman; "and wh=
ere are you bound,=20

if I may make so bold as to ask, little miss?"  "I am going to Rosebury," s=
aid Daisy. "Oh! how kind=20

of you to let me sleep in your arms. I've had quite a nice nap, and I'm not=
 so very tired. Thank you=20

very much for being so very good to me. Are we near Rosebury now, please?" =
 "In half an hour=20

you'll get there, dear. Now I must say good-bye, for this is my station. Go=
od-bye, missy, and a safe=20

journey to you."  "I'm so sorry you are going away," said Daisy, and she ra=
ised her little lips to kiss=20

her friend.  "God bless you, love," said the nice, pleasant-faced woman, an=
d then she got out of=20

the carriage, nodding her head to Daisy as she walked away.  The loneliness=
 which had more or=20

less been soothed or kept in abeyance by this good woman's company now retu=
rned very=20

strongly, and Daisy had to feel a certain empty little purse which she held=
 in her pocket to keep up=20

her resolution. She did not seem so certain about Mrs. Ellsworthy being nic=
e and kind as she was=20

the night before. The third-class carriage in which she had travelled was n=
ow nearly empty, and=20

when she at last arrived at Rosebury she was the only passenger to alight. =
She gave up her ticket=20

and walked out of the station, a forlorn and unnoticed little personage. It=
 was still very early in the=20

morning, not quite six o'clock, and there were very few people about, and t=
he whole place had a=20

strange, deserted, and unhomelike feeling. Could this be the Rosebury where=
 Daisy was born,=20

where she had been so petted and loved? She did not like its aspect in the =
cold grey morning light.=20

There was a little drizzling mist falling, and it chilled her and made her =
shiver.  "I know I've been=20

very, very selfish," she kept murmuring to herself. "I oughtn't to have min=
ded the dungeon. I ought=20

not to have been so terrified at the ogre. I'm afraid God is angry with me =
for being so dreadfully=20

selfish, and for letting the ogre take Primrose's money. I always did think=
 the sun shone at=20

Rosebury, but perhaps even the sun won't get up because he is angry with me=
."  Daisy knew her=20

way down the familiar and straggling village street, but there were one or =
two permit the law to=20

take its course."  "You may be right about the legal part. But how about th=
e moral side? Is there=20

not something at stake there, too?"  "It does seem a moral injustice, but I=
 cannot help that. It is=20

hard, for Josiah will see only the moral side of it, and the people of the =
village will think it unjust.=20

Josiah may find out the facts, that is, enough of them to prove to his mind=
 that I can't foreclose on=20

his property because of the little loan. What more he may discover, I canno=
t even guess. It will=20

depend somewhat on the lawyer who advises him. But no matter what he discov=
ers, my=20

conscience will be clear in that I did not break faith with his renegade br=
other."  "What right have=20

you to keep faith with him?"  "My little Beth, please do not question my ac=
tion," he entreated. "It=20

will all be clear to you some day. I'm willing to wait for my vindication, =
but I must know that my little=20

girl trusts her daddy to do what is right. If you don't, it will kill me!" =
 There was such deep pathos in=20

his voice that she recrossed the room. She laid her hand on the arm of her =
father's chair.  "After=20

all, Father, I am only a girl, and know very little of law and business. Fo=
rgive me if I have hurt you.=20

I don't see why you feel as you do about carrying this thing through at so =
great a sacrifice of=20

lifelong friendships. But I believe that you must be doing the best you can=
 as you see your duty."=20

"I can hope for no more than that, my dear."  Suddenly she shook the hair f=
rom her shining eyes.=20

"Father!"  "Yes?"  "I tell you what I'm going to do!" she cried. "I'm going=
 to Uncle Josiah just as=20



soon as he gets back, and tell him as much as I think he ought to know. May=
 I?"  "Certainly, if you=20

wish. I'll trust to your discretion. He will listen to you. I think you kno=
w what must not be said, from=20

our conversation this evening."  "I'll do it!" she exclaimed eagerly, and s=
tooped above the chair to=20

kiss her father's forehead. "Now, you go right to bed. That is my first rem=
edy. My second is like=20

unto it: don't do one single bit of worrying. Remember! Good night."  The E=
lder rose and smiled=20

benignly on his daughter. At the door he paused, and turned back.  "Beth, t=
his may affect the=20

minister."  "Affect the minister? Affect Mr. McGowan? How can it do that?" =
 "He has doubtless=20

urged Josiah to take this rash step to consult a lawyer, and when all the f=
acts come out he may be=20

forced to leave Little River. As you know, his popularity is quite dubious =
as matters stand at=20


_
became puzzled which to take, and what with the drizzling rain, and her own=
 great fatigue of body,=20

soon really lost her way.  An early laborer going to work was the first per=
son she met. She asked=20

him eagerly if she was on the right road; but he answered her so gruffly th=
at she instantly thought=20

he must be a relation of Mr. Dove's and ran, crying and trembling, away fro=
m him. The next person=20

she came across was a little boy of about her own age, and he was kind, and=
 took her hand, and=20

put her once more in the right direction, so that, foot-sore and weary, the=
 poor little traveller did=20

reach the lodge-gates of Shortlands about nine o'clock.  But here the bitte=
rest of her=20

disappointments awaited her, for the woman who attended to the gates said, =
in a cold and=20

unsympathizing voice, that the family were now in London, and there was no =
use whatever in little=20

miss troubling herself to go up to the house. No use at all, the woman repe=
ated, for she could not=20

tell when the family would return, probably not for several weeks. Daisy di=
d not ask any more=20

questions, but turned away from the inhospitable gates with a queer sinking=
 in her heart, and a=20

great dizziness before her eyes. She had come all this  "But I hardly see--=
--"  "We'll say nothing=20

more about that. Good night, my dear."  Her door closed, and her father cro=
ssed the hall. She was=20

no sooner alone than a rush of unbidden thoughts and emotions swept over he=
r, carrying all her=20

promises like chaff before a hurricane. While her father had been in the ro=
om she had thought=20

herself quite determined to take the hard step of explaining to Uncle Josia=
h just enough to remove=20

the blame from the one she loved to the half-brother. But now that the Elde=
r had gone her will to=20

explain seemed gone, too. Again he rose before her imagination, a white tre=
mbling figure. She=20

heard Harold speak the name of Adoniah Phillips, and saw her father stagger=
 from the table. Had=20

these two things been a mere coincidence? Doubts began to rise. Why must th=
e mortgage be=20

foreclosed on Uncle Josiah's place? Why had her father acted so on the even=
ing when Harold had=20

spoken his client's name? Had her father told her all? Why should all this =
involve the minister,=20

even though he had advised the Captain to seek the counsel of a lawyer?  Lo=
ng into the night she=20

puzzled her brain in seeking for answers to her many questions. Of one thin=
g she felt sure, Mr.=20

McGowan would not=20


_
Poppy's last money for nothing. Oh, now there was no doubt at all that God =
was very angry with=20

her, and that she had been both wicked and selfish. She had still twopence =
in her pocket--for the=20

good-natured omnibus conductor had paid her fare himself. She would go to t=
he nearest cottage=20

and ask for some milk for the Pink, and Little River. Just between waking a=
nd sleeping she at=20

length recalled the words of love which he had spoken to her on the beach, =
spoken as she had=20

never heard them before, and they carried her along dreamy paths into a hap=
py visionary future.=20

CHAPTER XV       "Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!     Ships may come and ship=
s may=20


_
wondered--poor, little, lonely, unhappy child--how long it would take her t=
o die.     CHAPTER XLI.=20

MRS. DREDGE TO THE RESCUE.   High tea at Penelope Mansion was an institutio=
n. Mrs. Flint=20

said in confidence to her boarders that she preferred high tea to late dinn=
er. She said that late=20

dinner savored too distinctly of the mannish element for her to tolerate. I=
t reminded her, she said,=20

of clerks returning home dead-beat after a day's hard toil; it reminded her=
 of sordid labor, and of all=20

kinds of unpleasant things; whereas high tea was in itself womanly, and was=
 in all respects suited=20

to the gentle appetites of ladies who were living genteelly on their means.=
 Mrs.         But I sail on=20

forever!"   Certainly, no audience would be moved to tears, either by the q=
uality of the voice, or by=20

the ditty that was thus rendered. And yet, there was a blue-eyed, fair-hair=
ed girl, seated on the=20

rocks below her father's place, whose eyes filled with tears as she listene=
d. Elizabeth thought she=20

was prepared to fulfill the promise made to her father three days ago, but,=
 now that the opportunity=20

was upon her, she felt her resolution slipping away. She loved her dear old=
 friend as never in all=20

her life.  The singer rounded a projection of sandy beach just beyond the r=
ock-pile where the girl=20

was sitting. He was hurrying up the shore in the=20
