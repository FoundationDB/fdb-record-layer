a certain time the water from the ashes was poured into a pot containing gr=
ease. This was boiled=20

for a certain time and then left to cool. The result was a pot full of soft=
 substance varying in color=20

from white to yellow, this was called lye soap. This was then cut into bars=
 as desired for use.  For=20

dyeing thread and cloth, red oak bark, sweet gum bark and shoe make roots w=

The wash tubs were large wooden tubs having one handle with holes in it for=
 the fingers. Chicken=20

and goose feathers were always carefully saved to make feather mattresses. =
Claude remembers=20

when women wore hoop skirts. He was about 20 years of age when narrow skirt=
s became=20

fashionable for women. During slavery the family only used slats on the bed=
s, it was after the war=20

that he saw his first spring bed and at that tine the first buggy. This bug=
gy was driven by ex-

governor Reid of Florida who then lived in South Jacksonville. It was a fou=
r-wheeled affair drawn=20

by a horse and looked sensible and natural as a vehicle.  The paper money i=
n circulation was=20

called "shin plasters." Claude's uncle, Mark Clark joined the Northern Army=
. His master did not go=20

to war but remained on the plantation. One day at noon during the war the g=
in house was seen to=20

be afire, one of the slaves rushed in and found the master badly burned and=
 writhing in pain. He=20

was taken from the building and given first aid, but his body being burned =
in oil and so badly=20

burned it burst open, thus ended the life of the kindly master of Claude.  =
The soldiers of the=20

southern Army wore gray uniforms with gray caps and the soldiers of the Nor=
thern Army wore=20

blue.  After the war such medicines as castor oil, rhubarb, colomel and blu=
e mass and salts were=20

generally used. The Civil War raged for some tine and the slaves on Dexter'=
s plantation prayed for=20

victory of the Northern Army, though they dared not show their anxiety to M=
ary Ann Dexter who=20

was master and mistress since the master's death. Claude and his family rem=
ained with the=20

Dexters until peace was declared. Mrs. Dexter informed the slaves thay they=
 could stay with her if=20

they so desired and that she would furnish everything to cultivate railroad=
 enterprise. His wife is=20

said, by a happy inspiration, to have decided him in favour of the more imp=
ortant and ambitious=20

sphere. She did so at the sacrifice of her domestic comfort; for in the pro=
secution of her husband's=20

multifarious enterprises they changed their residence eleven times in the n=
ext thirteen years,=20

several times to places abroad; and little during those years did his wife =
and family see of Mr.=20

Brassey.  A high place in Mr. Brassey's calling had now been won, and it ha=
d been won not by=20

going into rings or making corners, but by treading steadily the steep path=
 of honour. Mr. Locke=20

was accused of unduly favouring Mr. Brassey. Mr. Helps replies that the par=
tiality of a man like Mr.=20

Locke must have been based on business grounds. It was found that when Mr. =
Brassey had=20

undertaken a contract, the engineer-in-chief had little to do in the way of=
 supervision. Mr. Locke=20

felt assured that the bargain would be not only exactly but handsomely fulf=
illed, and that no excuse=20

would be pleaded for alteration or delay. After the fall of a great viaduct=
 it was suggested to Mr.=20

Brassey that, by representing his case, he might obtain a reduction of his =
loss. "No," was his reply,=20

"I have contracted to make and maintain the road, and nothing shall prevent=
 Thomas Brassey=20

from being as good as his word."  As a contractor on a large scale, and esp=
ecially as a contractor=20

for foreign railroads, Mr. Brassey was led rapidly to develop the system of=
 sub-contracting. His=20

mode of dealing with his sub-contractors, however, was peculiar. They did n=
ot regularly contract=20

with him, but he appointed them their work, telling them what price he shou=
ld give for it. They were=20

ready to take his word, knowing that they would not suffer by so doing. The=
 sub-contractor who=20

had made a bad bargain, and found himself in a scrape, anxiously looked for=
 the coming of Mr.=20



Brassey. "Mr. Brassey," says one of the witnesses examined for this biograp=
hy, "came, saw how=20

matters stood, and invariably satisfied the man. If a cutting taken to be c=
lay turned out after a very=20

short time to be rock, the sub- contractor would be getting disheartened, y=
et he still persevered,=20


_
them half of what was raised. None of the slaves remained but all were anxi=
ous to see what=20

freedom was like.  Claude recalls that a six-mule team drove up to the hous=
e driven by a colored=20

Union soldier. He helped move the household furniture from their the line a=
s usual with a number=20

of followers, and on coming to the cutting he looked round, counted the num=
ber of waggons at the=20

work, scanned the cutting, and took stock of the nature of the stuff. "This=
 is very hard," said he to=20

the sub-contractor.=20
