Nancy, suddenly stopping in her weeping and drying her eyes. "The young cur=
ate came just after=20

Stone's wife had left. I did not think much of the lad at first, but he, to=
o, spoke what was truth,=20

though in a different way from Bell. What he was a-saying I've been turning=
 over in my mind ever=20

since. 'Twill be hard work, but I'll do it. Then I've been thinking, oh, ma=
ny and many's the time, of=20

that evening I spent with the Frankses just afore I fell into the stream! I=
've been saying to myself,=20

'What a different home Persis gives her husband from what I've given to min=
e!' She has a good=20

husband,--I'll not deny it,--but he don't deserve better of her than you do=
 of me, John Sands, let=20

any one deny that as can!"  "My dear!" repeated the poor clerk, in a soften=
ed tone. It was a new=20

thing to him to have a kind word from his wife.  "Now," continued Nancy, wh=
o did not care to be=20

interrupted, "I've lost an arm, and my right one, and it's not much as I ca=
n do now. But I'd do what I=20

can, John Sands, and I'll _not do_ what I've done," she went on, more vehem=
ently. "I'll _not_ go a-

disgracing you, spending your money, and breaking your heart. I'll take the=
 pledge to-morrow, and,=20

God helping me, I'll keep it; never a drop of the poison shall pass my lips=
 again!"  And this was the=20

piece of good news which had sent the poor clerk on his homeward way almost=
 dizzy with joy, so=20

glad that he could not rest until he had got others to share it, though onl=
y by the very simple=20

means of a scatter of sugar-plums and cakes!  But Nancy's conversation with=
 her husband had not=20

closed with her promise to take the pledge. There was something else on the=
 woman's mind.=20

"We've done nothing yet, John Sands, to show that we're not ungrateful to t=
hat sailor whom I've=20

been a worritting and abusing ever since he came to the village; and who ye=
t jumped into the=20

water and saved me, just as I was drawn under that fearful wheel. I'll neve=
r forget the horror;--I=20

thought all was over with me then!"  "I'd do anything," began the clerk, bu=
t Nancy, as usual, cut=20

him short.  "You go home, and get my pretty cuckoo-clock, the clock as was =
given me on my=20

marriage, and send it over to the Frankses with a letter, a handsome letter=
; you're a scholar, and=20

can write one as good as a parson. And, mind you,"--a grim, strange smile c=
ame over Nancy's=20

features as she added,--"and mind you, don't forget to send the weights, Jo=
hn Sands. Persis told=20

the truth, and I'll never forget it,--a clock can't get on without the weig=
hts."  John Sands did not=20

forget to take down the clock that evening, and to send it to the school-ho=
use, with a letter written=20

so neatly that it looked like copperplate. It was a fine specimen of compos=
ition also, for the clerk=20

could write well, though he could not speak well; and if ever there was a m=
an inspired by grateful=20

joy, that man was the husband of Nancy. He did not, however, in his letter =
make the slightest=20

allusion to his wife's late bad habits, nor to her intention of taking the =
pledge; there was a feeling of=20

delicacy on the part of the husband that made him shrink from unnecessarily=
 touching on so=20

tender a subject. But often and often did the clerk mutter to himself on th=
at evening, before he=20

went to his rest, "Didn't I always say it; she was tempted, poor dear, and =
went wrong, but the metal=20

was always good,--very good!"     XXIV.  The Blind Maiden.   We are now goi=
ng to change the=20

scene of our story, and, leaving for a while the quiet village of Colme, wi=
th its rushing stream and=20

blossoming hedges, turn towards busy, bustling London.  My reader may chanc=
e to remember a=20

slight mention made by Sands, in an earlier chapter, of a Jew and his son, =
of whose conversion=20

Persis and Franks had been the happy instruments more than three years prev=
iously. It is to the=20

humble abode of the converted Jew that I will now direct my reader's attent=
ion.  In a gloomy=20

kitchen in a lodging-house situated in a low street of London, a poor girl =
sat, not on a chair, but on=20



a box, for scanty indeed was the furniture in that dark, close room. The ca=
rpetless floor was=20

uneven, the paper on the walls half peeled away, the plaster in the ceiling=
 smoke-stained, cracked,=20

and broken in several places. But it was not the aspect of the place that d=
istressed Sophy=20

Claymore; had it been adorned by rich tapestry, and pictures in gilded fram=
es, it would have been=20

all the same to her as far as regarded its appearance, for she was totally =
blind. Though years had=20

passed since the heavy affliction had come upon her, the poor young woman h=
ad never yet=20

become reconciled to the loss of her sight. She longed, she pined to look o=
n the sunbeams once=20

more, to see the flowers, and behold again the faces of men.  And then to S=
ophy Claymore=20

poverty was a terrible trial. She had not been accustomed to it in her chil=
dhood. Sophy, the=20

daughter of a worthless sharper, who had spent lavishly what he had gained =
wickedly, had known=20

more of pleasure and folly during the first fifteen years of her life than =
usually falls to the lot of girls=20

in her station. Now she was an orphan, poor, penniless, having hardly the n=
ecessaries of life, and=20

owing even those necessaries to the generous kindness of a friend. Isaacs, =
the converted Jew,=20

though no relative of Sophy, had adopted her as his own child at a time whe=
n he was better able=20

to support her, and would not now throw her off, though he had scarcely a c=
rust to share with the=20

poor blind girl.  Then Sophy had sharp pain added to poverty and blindness.=
 Ever since the terrible=20

illness which had deprived her of sight, she had been subject to attacks of=
 rheumatism, sometimes=20

in her limbs, sometimes in her head. As she sat on the box in that low-ceil=
ed room, dreadful=20

shootings of pain from eye and ear and cheek made her ever and anon start a=
nd draw in her=20

breath, and then utter a low plaintive moan.  But it was not only these tri=
als, sore as they were,=20

that made poor Sophy's blind eyes overflow with tears, and drew from her th=
at impatient wish that=20

she might lie down and die. Sophy had a wounded spirit as well as a sufferi=
ng body. She had not=20

the calm rest of that loving faith which has so often made God's children _=
joyful in tribulation_. She=20

felt very impatient under her troubles, even though well aware that she had=
 partly brought them on=20

herself. Sophy had the fear of God in her heart; but she had as yet but lit=
tle love, and therefore=20

could hardly keep from murmuring, though she tried hard not to rebel.  "Oh,=
 here comes Benoni, at=20

last!" exclaimed Sophy Claymore, hastily drying her eyes, as a light footst=
ep was heard on the=20

dark wooden stair leading down to the kitchen. Sophy had never seen the fac=
e of her little brother,=20

as she called the son of Isaacs; she had never met the smile of the child; =
but she would=20

sometimes say that she could _hear_ the smile in his voice; and she loved t=
o fancy him like the=20

picture of a fair white-winged cherub, with a ray streaming down on his bri=
ght, uplifted face, which=20

she had admired when she was a child. If Sophy could have seen Benoni as he=
 entered the=20

kitchen, she would have beheld something very unlike the image in her mind;=
 he would have=20

appeared as a pale, sickly boy, of about nine or ten years of age, with a J=
ewish cast of feature,=20

and very shabbily dressed. But perhaps Sophy was after all not so much mist=
aken as many might=20

have thought her, and Benoni, seen with the eyes of the soul, might have lo=
oked much like a=20

cherub still. There _was_ a ray streaming down upon him, though not such as=
 can be seen by=20

mortal eyes.  "Oh! have you sold them, Benoni?" cried Sophy anxiously, as s=
he heard her adopted=20

brother softly enter the room.  There was not "a smile in the voice," but t=
here was hope in it as the=20

boy made reply, "Not to-day, dear Sophy. People seemed all so busy and bust=
ling, they would not=20

attend to me. But I hope to-morrow to sell some of your beautiful knitted t=
hings;" and Benoni put=20

down a card-board box containing small cuffs and kettle-holders,--a box, al=
as! just as full as when=20



he had taken it out that morning to try to sell something in the streets.  =
"I wish that the money=20

thrown away on the wool had gone for bread!" said Sophy, desperately. She w=
as dreadfully=20

disappointed at the failure, and ready to burst into tears.  Benoni went an=
d sat upon the box=20

beside her, took her hand in his own, stroked and fondled it, and looked up=
 lovingly into her face.=20

"Poor sister," he said very softly, "I'm afraid you are still in sore pain;=
 I wish I could take it away!"=20

"You feel for me, Benoni, you pity me," replied Sophy, almost with a sob; "=
why does not God pity=20

too?"  "God does!" exclaimed Benoni, looking shocked at what sounded so muc=
h like the=20

expression of a doubt of the love of his merciful Creator.  "It does not se=
em like it," muttered=20

Sophy, half aloud, "or why does God leave us in misery like this?"  "God kn=
ows why, and we must=20

trust him," said Benoni, simply. "Why, you trust even for letting all remem=
brance of my words=20

concerning it be put out of his mind by his "wicked jealousy," as he repent=
antly called it. For me,=20

he had nothing but praise and gratitude for what I had done for him. He beg=
ged me to forgive him,=20

and his remorse for such a small thing, comparatively--wrung my heart.  We =
searched the garden=20

and the whole street, then came back to search the little drawing-room for =
the second time, in=20

vain. It did seem that there was witchcraft in it, as I said to Raoul; but =
at last I persuaded him to go=20

away, and follow his own track wherever he had been since I gave him the ba=
g with the diamonds.=20

It was just possible, as it was so late, and his way had led him through qu=
iet streets, that even=20

after all this time the little brocade bag might be lying where he had left=
 it--or that some honest=20

policeman on his beat might have picked it up. Besides, there was the cab i=
n which he had come=20

part of the distance to my house. The bag might have fallen on the floor wh=
ile he drove: and there=20

were many honest cabmen in Paris, I reminded him, trying to be as cheerful =
as I could.  So he left=20

me. And I was deadly tired; but I had no thought of sleep--no wish for it. =
When I had unlocked the=20

door of my boudoir and found Ivor Dundas gone, as I had hoped he would be, =
the next hope born=20

in my heart was that he might by and by come back, or send--with news. Hour=
 after hour of deadly=20

suspense passed on, and he did not come or make any sign. At five o'clock M=
arianne, who had=20

flitted about all night like a restless ghost, made me drink a cup of hot c=
hocolate, and actually put=20

me to bed. My last words to her were: "What is the use? I can't sleep. It w=
ill be worse to lie and=20

toss in a fever, than sit up."  Yet I did sleep, and heavily. She will alwa=
ys deny it, I know, but I'm=20

sure she must have slyly slipped a sleeping-powder into the chocolate. I wa=
s far too much=20

occupied with my own thoughts, as I drank to please her, to think whether o=
r no there was=20

anything at all peculiar in the taste.  Be that as it may, I slept; and whe=
n I waked suddenly, starting=20

out of a hateful dream (yet scarcely worse than realities), to my horror it=
 was nearly noon.  I was=20

wild with fear lest the servants, in their stupid but well-meant wish not t=
o disturb me, might have=20

sent important visitors away. However, when Marianne came flying in, in ans=
wer to my long peal=20

of the electric bell, she said that no one had been. There were letters and=
 one telegram, and all=20

the morning papers, as usual after the first night of a new play.  My heart=
 gave a spring at the=20

news that there was a telegram, for I thought it might be from Ivor, saying=
 he was on the track of=20

the treaty, even if he hadn't yet got hold of it. But the message was from =
Raoul; and he had not=20

found the brocade bag. He did not put this in so many words, but said, "I h=
ave not found what was=20

lost, or learned anything of it."  From Ivor there was not a line, and I th=
ought this cruel. He might=20

have wired, or written me a note, even if there were nothing definite to sa=
y. He might, unless--

something had happened to him. There was that to think of; and I did think =
of it, with dread, and a=20



growing presentiment that I had not suffered yet all I was to suffer. I det=
ermined to send a servant=20

to the Elysee Palace Hotel to enquire for him, and despatched Henri immedia=
tely. Meanwhile, as=20

there was nothing to do, after pretending to eat breakfast under the watchf=
ul eyes of Marianne, I=20

pretended also to read the newspaper notices of the play. But each sentence=
 went out of my head=20

before I had begun the next. I knew in the end only that, according to all =
the critics, Maxine de=20

Renzie had "surpassed herself," had been "astonishingly great," had done "w=
hat no woman could=20

do unless she threw her whole soul into her part." How little they knew whe=
re Maxine de Renzie's=20

soul had been last night! And--only God knew where it might be this night. =
Out of her body,=20

perhaps--the one way of escape from Raoul's hatred, if he had come to know =
the truth.  Of course=20

the enquiry at the hotel was not for Ivor Dundas, but for the name he had a=
dopted there; yet when=20

my servant came back to me he had nothing to tell which was consoling--rath=
er the other way. The=20

gentleman had gone out about midnight (I knew that already), and hadn't ret=
urned since. Henri=20

had been to the Bureau to ask, and it had struck him, he admitted to me on =
being catechised, that=20

his questions had been answered with a certain reserve, as if more were kno=
wn of the absent=20

gentleman's movements than it was considered wise to tell.  My servant had =
not been long away,=20

though it seemed long to me, and he had delayed only to buy all the evening=
 papers, which he=20

"thought that Mademoiselle would like to see, as they were sure to be fille=
d with praise of her great=20

acting." It was on my tongue to scold him for stopping even one moment, whe=
n he had been told=20

to hurry, but he looked so pleased at his own cleverness that I hadn't the =
heart to dash his=20

happiness. I would, however, have pushed the papers aside without so much a=
s glancing at them,=20

if it hadn't suddenly occurred to me that, if any accident had befallen Ivo=
r, news of it might possibly=20

have got into print by this time.  When I read what had happened--how he wa=
s accused of murder,=20

and while declaring his innocence had been silent as to all those events wh=
ich might have proved=20

it, my heart went out to him in a wave of gratitude. Here was a man! A man =
loyal and brave and=20

chivalrous as all men ought to be, but few are! He had sacrificed himself t=
o the death, no doubt, to=20

keep my name out of the mud into which my business had thrown him, and to s=
ave me from=20

appearing in Raoul's eyes the liar that I was. Had Ivor told that he was wi=
th me, after I had=20

prevaricated (if I had not actually lied) to Raoul about the midnight visit=
or to my house, what would=20

Raoul think of me?  Ivor was trying to save me, if he could; and he had bee=
n trying to save me=20

when he went to the room of that dead man, though how and when he had decid=
ed to go I knew=20

not. If it were not for me, he would be free and happy to-day.  My conscien=
ce cried out that the one=20

thing to do was to go at once to the Chief of Police and say: "Monsieur, th=
is English gentleman=20

they have arrested cannot have committed a murder in the Rue de la Fille Sa=
uvage, between=20

twelve and one last night, for he came to my house, far away in the Rue d'H=
ollande, at a quarter=20

past twelve, and didn't leave it till after one o'clock."  I even sprang up=
 from my chair in the very=20

room where I had hidden Ivor, to ring for Marianne and tell her to bring me=
 a hat and coat, to bid=20

her order my electric brougham immediately. But--I sat down again, sick and=
 despairing,=20

deliberately crushing the generous impulse. I couldn't obey it. I dared not=
. By and by, perhaps. If=20

Ivor should be in real pressing danger, then certainly. But not now.  At fo=
ur o'clock Raoul came,=20

and was with me for an hour. Each of us tried to cheer the other. I did all=
 I could to make him hope=20

that even yet he would have news of the brocade bag and its contents. He, t=
hinking me ill and tired=20

out, did all he could to persuade me that he was not miserable with anxiety=
. At least, he was no=20



longer jealous of Godensky or of any man, and was humbly repentant for his =
suspicions of me the=20

night before. When Raoul is repentant, and wishes to atone for something th=
at he has done, he is=20

enchanting. There was never a man like him.  At five I sent him away, with =
the excuse that I must=20

rest, as I hadn't slept much the night before; but really it was because I =
feared lest I should=20

disgrace myself before him by breaking down, and giving him a fright--or pe=
rhaps even by being=20

mad enough to confess the thing I had done. I felt that I was no longer mis=
tress of myself--that I=20

might be capable of any folly.  I could not eat, but I drank a little beef-=
tea before starting for the=20

theatre, where I went earlier than usual. It would be something to be busy;=
 and in my part I might=20

even forget for a moment, now and then.  Marianne and I were in my dressing=
-room before seven.=20

I insisted on dressing at once, and took as long as I could in the process =
of making up; still, when I=20

was ready there was more than half an hour to spare before the first act. T=
here were letters for=20

me--the kind that always come to the theatre--but I couldn't read them, aft=
er I had occupied myself=20

with tearing open the envelopes. I knew what they would be: vows of adorati=
on from strangers;=20

poems by budding poets; petitions for advice from girls and young men who w=
anted to go on the=20

stage; requests from artists who wanted to paint my picture. There were alw=
ays such things every=20

night, especially after the opening of a new play.  I was still aimlessly b=
reaking fantastic seals, and=20

staring unseeingly at crests and coronets, when there came a knock at the d=
oor. Marianne opened=20

it, to speak for a moment with the stage door keeper.  "Mademoiselle," she =
whispered, coming to=20

me, "Monsieur le Comte Godensky wishes to see you. Shall I say you=20


_
I lead you about in the street; you are sure that I won't bring you into da=
nger, or take you where=20

you would get any harm. You just hold me tight by the hand and walk on, and=
 are never afraid. I=20

think that's how we should feel about greater things. We should let the goo=
d Lord take us by the=20

hand, and then not start back and feel frightened. He sees, you know, thoug=
h we cannot see, what=20

is the best road to take us along."  "I wish that I could feel as you do," =
sighed Sophy. "How do you=20

get such comfort in religion? I scarcely ever have any."  "My comfort comes=
 by thinking all about=20

the Lord Jesus," said Benoni. "I'm often getting anxious and sad, and then =
when I think about him,=20

all seems to grow sunny again."  "I also think of the Lord in his glory," o=
bserved Sophy; "but it=20

seems as if in the midst of all the happiness of heaven he would not care t=
o think about me."  "But=20

I like best to think about the Lord when he was on earth," said Benoni; "mo=
st of all when he was a=20

little boy living at Nazareth with his mother. Then I know he can understan=
d all that I feel, and the=20

little things that trouble me so. Joseph was not a rich or a great man you =
know; he was only a=20

simple carpenter, and had to work for his bread. Don't you think that Josep=
h may sometimes have=20

been ill, or out of work like my father, and that Mary may scarcely have kn=
own how to get food to=20

give to her husband and son?"  "Perhaps so," replied Sophy, thoughtfully, "=
but one can hardly=20

fancy it. All the pictures of the Virgin Mary that I used to see made her l=
ook dressed like a queen,=20

and sitting on clouds, and one can't imagine that either she or the Holy Ch=
ild could ever really=20

want a meal."  "Ah! but one can't trust _pictures_," said Benoni; "it is ve=
ry likely, as I once heard=20

dear Persis say, that the Lord Jesus had a hard, struggling kind of life wh=
en he was a boy. And=20

then he lived in a very wicked place; we know that from the Bible. I dare s=
ay that he often heard=20

bad words and saw things that would grieve him; and I dare say that bad boy=
s would tempt him,=20

and jeer at him, and torment him, because he never would join them in doing=
 anything wrong. You=20

can't think what a comfort it is to me to think that the Lord had such comm=
on troubles as these."=20

"_In all points tempted like as we are_," repeated Sophy, the apostle's wor=
ds recurring to her=20

mind.  "I do love," continued Benoni, "to remember that it was when he was =
a boy, not many years=20

older than I am, that the Lord said, _Wist ye not that I must be about my F=
ather's business_? It=20

showed that _doing_ God's will was in his mind then, that he was preparing =
when he was a child=20

for the great, great work,--the business of saving the world. And perhaps t=
he Lord had something=20

to suffer, too, when he was a boy, preparing him for the terrible trials th=
at came upon him at last;=20

perhaps he had little crosses--like ours--before he had to take up the grea=
t one, and many a thorn=20

to pain him, even in his quiet home, long before the cruel soldiers put the=
 platted crown round his=20

head. Now, being hungry and having very little to eat may have just been on=
e of these thorns."   I=20

thought for a moment. Better see him, perhaps. I might learn something. If =
not--if he had only=20

come to torture me uselessly to please himself, I would soon find out, and =
could send him away.  I=20

went into my little reception-room adjoining, and received him there. He ad=
vanced, smiling, as one=20

advances to a friend of whose welcome one is sure.  "Well?" I asked, abrupt=
ly, when the door was=20

shut and we were alone. He held out his hand, but I put mine behind me, and=
 drew back a step=20

when he had come too close.  "Well--I have news for you, that no one else c=
ould bring, so I=20

thought you would be glad to see--even me," he answered, smiling still.  "W=
hat news? But bad, of=20

course--or you wouldn't bring it."  "You are very cruel. Of course, you've =
seen the evening papers?=20

You know that your English friend is in prison?"  "The same English friend =
whom _you_ would=20

have liked to see arrested early last evening on a ridiculous, baseless cha=
rge," I flung at him. "You=20



look surprised. But you are _not_ surprised, Count Godensky--except, perhap=
s, that I should=20

guess who had me spied upon at the Elysee Palace Hotel. A disappointment, t=
hat affair, wasn't it?=20

But you haven't told me your news."  "It is this: That Mr. Ivor Dundas, of =
England, has been on the=20

rack to-day."  "What do you mean?"  "He has been in the hands of the Juge d=
'Instruction. It is=20

much the same, isn't it, if one has secrets to keep? Would you like to know=
, if some magical bird=20

could tell you, what questions were put to Mr. Dundas, and what answers he =
made?"  Strange,=20

that this very thought had been torturing me before Godensky came! I had be=
en thinking of the=20

Juge d'Instruction, and his terrible cross-examination which only a man of =
steel or iron can answer=20

without trembling. I had thought that questions had been asked and answers =
given which might=20

mean everything to me, if I could only have heard them. Could it be that I =
was to hear, now? But I=20

reminded myself that this was impossible. No one could know except the Juge=
 d'Instruction and=20

Ivor Dundas himself. "Only two men were present at that scene, and they wil=
l never tell what went=20

on," I said aloud.  "Three men were present," Godensky answered. "Besides t=
he two of whom you=20

think, there was another: a lawyer who speaks English. It is permitted nowa=
days that a foreigner, if=20

he demands it, can be accompanied by his legal adviser when he goes before =
the Juge=20

d'Instruction. Otherwise, his lack of knowledge of the language might handi=
cap him, and cause=20

misunderstandings which would prejudice his case."  He paused a moment, but=
 I did not reply. I=20

knew that Ivor Dundas spoke French as well as I; but I was not going to tel=
l this Russian that fact.=20

"The adviser your friend has chosen," Godensky went on, "happens to be a pr=
otege of mine. I=20

made him--gave him his first case, his first success; and have employed him=
 more than once=20

since. Odd, what a penchant Mr. Dundas seems to have for men in whom I, too=
, have confidence!=20

Last night, it was Girard. To-day, it is Lenormand."  This was a blow, and =
a heavy one; but I=20

wouldn't let Godensky see that I winced under it.  "You keep yourself=20


_
abundance even when he was a boy, if he had chosen to do so," said Sophy.  =
"But I don't suppose=20

that he ever did choose to do that," replied Benoni, in a very thoughtful t=
one, for he was a child=20

who reflected much. "The Lord wouldn't make bread for himself when he was a=
 man; it is not at all=20

likely that he would do so when he was a boy. No, I dare say that the Holy =
One tried to help=20

Joseph, and to cheer his mother, and told them that he was sure that their =
heavenly Father would=20

never forget them. I dare say that the Lord looked _then_ at the sparrows a=
nd the lilies, and=20

thought how God clothed and fed them, and then up to the blue, blue sky, wh=
ere his heavenly=20

Father dwells, and never doubted that Father's love, however hungry and poo=
r he himself might=20

be."  Benoni Isaacs expressed himself like a child, but Sophy felt that the=
 love and joy and peace=20

that breathed in his simple words were not of earth, but from above. The li=
ttle one beside her was,=20

like Samuel, early called to listen to the word of God, and to answer in tr=
ustful obedience, _Speak=20

Lord, for thy servant heareth_. Sophy envied Benoni his power of looking up=
wards by faith, and=20

seeing God's love in all things, more than she envied him the sight of his =
bodily eyes. The girl and=20

her adopted brother might be compared to travellers on a wide ocean. With B=
enoni there were=20

heavings and tossings, a gale of trouble lifting the waves on high; but lov=
e to God was like bright=20

sunshine on that stormy sea, turning the foam into crests of pearls, the bi=
llows to waves of gold.=20

But Sophy was like one who journeys towards a frozen north, at a time when =
the sun for long days=20

is absent. All around her was becoming dreary and chill; the ice of mistrus=
t was gradually=20

gathering and thickening around her, till it seemed as if it would hold her=
 fast as in a prison, so that=20

she should make no more progress towards heaven;--never get forward, never =
get through to=20

open water and a brighter sea! There is something more terrible in this gra=
dual freezing round the=20

soul than in the sudden shock of temptation. It seems more impossible to "s=
heer off" from a=20

danger like this. If we can thus find _mistrust_ beginning to spread around=
 us its deadly chill, if the=20

slightest doubt of God's love arise like a film on the water, let us instan=
tly turn our thoughts=20

towards the Sun of Righteousness though his rays may be hidden from our eye=
s; let us not be=20

content to rest for an hour where shoals of unbelief are forming around; le=
t the very north wind of=20

trouble only drive us more rapidly towards the clear south, till we feel at=
 last the warmth of that Sun=20

which has healing and life in each beam.     XXV.  Honorable Scars.   "Here=
's father!" suddenly=20

exclaimed Benoni, as he heard a familiar step on the stair, and rose to mee=
t his parent.  "Oh, may=20

he bring us good news!" sighed Sophy. Instinctively she turned her head in =
the direction of the=20

door, longing to be able to read in the face of her adopted parent whether =
he had met with=20

success in his quest for employment or assistance. All was darkness with So=
phy; but Benoni saw=20

in a moment, from the heavy cloud on his father's brow, the compressed lips=
, the haggard cheek,=20

that he had met with severe disappointment. Benjamin Isaacs almost threw to=
 Benoni the single=20

loaf which he brought, as with suppressed bitterness he said, "Take it--I g=
ot it by pledging the last=20

of my tools."  "God has forsaken us!" muttered Sophy, putting up her hands =
to each side of her=20

head. There had been a shooting pain through it at that moment, but a sharp=
er pang still had=20

pierced through the poor girl's heart.  The one chair in the kitchen had be=
en left for various=20

proteges," I said--"as well as those of your enemies. But if the informatio=
n in the one case is no=20

more trustworthy than in the other--why, you're not faithfully served. I've=
 good reason to know that=20

you've made several mistakes lately, and you're likely to make more."  "Tha=
nks for the warning.=20

But I hope you don't call yourself my 'enemy'?"  "I don't know of a more ap=
propriate name--after=20



the baseness that you haven't even tried to hide, in your dealings with me.=
"  "I thought all was fair=20

in love and war."  "Do you make war on women?"  "No--I make love to them." =
 "To many, I dare=20

say. But here is one who won't listen."  "At least you will listen while I =
go on with the news I came=20

to tell?"  "Oh, yes, I confess to being curious. No doubt what you say will=
 be interesting--even if not=20

accurate."  "I can promise that it shall be both. I called on Lenormand as =
soon as I learned what=20

had happened--that he'd been mixed up in this case--and expressed myself as=
 extremely=20

concerned for the fate of his client, friends of whom were intimate friends=
 of mine. So you see,=20

there was no question of treachery on Lenormand's part. He trusts me--as yo=
u do not. Indeed, I=20

even offered my help for Dundas, if I could give it consistently with my po=
sition. Naturally, he told=20

me nothing which could be used against Dundas, so far as he knew, even if I=
 wished to go against=20

him--which my coming here ought to prove to you that I do not."  "I read th=
e proof rather=20

differently," I said. "But go on. I'm sure you are anxious to tell me certa=
in things. Please come to=20

the point."  "In a few words, then, the point is this: One of the most impo=
rtant questions put by the=20

Juge d'Instruction, after hearing from Mr. Dundas the explanation of a docu=
ment found on him by=20

the police--ah, that wakes you up, Mademoiselle! You are surprised that a d=
ocument was found on=20

the prisoner?"  I was half fainting with fear lest Ivor had regained the tr=
eaty, only to lose it again in=20

this dreadful way; but I controlled myself.  "I rather hope it was not a le=
tter from me," I said. "You=20

know so much, that you probably know I admitted to the police at the Elysee=
 Palace a strong=20

friendship for Mr. Dundas. We knew each other well in London. But London wa=
ys are different=20

from the ways of Paris. It isn't agreeable to be gossipped about, however u=
njustly, even if one is--

only an actress."  "You turn things cleverly, as always. Yes, you are afrai=
d there might have been--

a letter. Yet the public adores you. It would pardon you any indiscretion, =
especially a romantic one-

-any indiscretion _except treachery_. There might, however, be a few person=
s less indulgent. Du=20

Laurier, for instance."  I shivered. "We were speaking of the scene with th=
e Juge d'Instruction," I=20

reminded him. "You have wandered from the point again."  "There are so many=
 points--all sharp=20

as swords for those they may pierce. Well, the important question was in re=
lation to a letter--yes.=20

But the letter was not from you, Mademoiselle. It was written in English, a=
nd it made an=20

appointment at the very address where the crime was committed. It was, as n=
early as I could=20

make out, a request from a person calling himself a jeweller's assistant, f=
or the receiver of the=20

letter to call and return a case containing jewels. This case had been comm=
itted to Mr. Dundas'=20

care, it appeared, while travelling from London to Paris, and without his k=
nowledge, another=20

packet being taken away to make room for this. Mr. Dundas replied to the Ju=
ge d'Instruction that=20

his own packet, stolen from him on the journey, contained nothing but paper=
s _entirely personal,_=20

concerning himself alone.  "'What was in the case which the=20


_
he did not take it; he was too restless to sit down. Under a manner usually=
 quiet, he was a man of=20

passions naturally fierce. These had been kept under control, first by a ha=
bit of reserve, then by=20

the principles which he had adopted with the Christian religion, but now an=
d then they broke=20

through restraint, and a short but vivid glimpse was given of an impetuous,=
 fiery spirit.  [Illustration:=20

"Then go to the Christians," he said, mockingly, waving me out of the shop.=
 p. 244.]  "Man at least=20

has forsaken us!" he exclaimed, with but half-suppressed passion. "I went f=
irst to Elkanah da=20

Costa, him under whom I worked as a journeyman for years. There he was in h=
is shop,=20

surrounded by the silver and the gold and the gems that are dear to him as =
his soul. I told him of=20

my difficulties; how anxious I am to find work, even if my wages be much re=
duced. He knows=20

_how_ I work,--many of the glittering jewels in his cases had been set by t=
hese hands. 'I don't see=20

you, Benjamin Isaacs, in the synagogue now,' he drawled forth; he who cares=
 less for your=20

pocket?' asked the Juge d'Instruction--Lenormand tells me.  "'A necklace,' =
answered Mr. Dundas.=20

"'A necklace of diamonds?'  "'Possibly diamonds, possibly paste, I wasn't m=
uch interested in it.'=20

"'Ah, was this not the necklace which you--staying at the Elysee Palace und=
er another name--gave=20

to Mademoiselle Maxine de Renzie last evening?' was the next question throw=
n suddenly at Mr.=20

Dundas' head. Now, you see, Mademoiselle, that my story is not dull."  "Am =
I to hear the rest--

according to your protege?" I asked, twisting my handkerchief, as I should =
have liked to twist=20

Godensky's neck, till he had no more breath or wickedness left in him.  "Mr=
. Dundas tried his best=20

to convince the Juge d'Instruction, a most clever and experienced man, that=
 if he had, as an old=20

friend, brought you a present of diamonds, it was something entirely differ=
ent, and therefore far=20

removed from this case.  "'Are you not Mademoiselle de Renzie's lover?' was=
 the next enquiry. 'I=20

admire her, as do thousands of others, who also respect her as I do,' your =
friend=20


_
than for the lightest grain of gold dust that falls from the graver! 'No,' =
I replied; 'for these three=20

years and more I have attended a Christian church.' 'Then go to the Christi=
ans,' he said,=20

mockingly, waving me out of the shop. 'You will at least give me a certific=
ate of character,' I began.=20

He cut me short with, 'Go to the Christians for _that_,' with a sneer on hi=
s face which made the=20

blood mount to mine; and I turned my back on that place with its glittering=
 wealth--forever!  "I had=20

not walked many paces from the see what there is in this string of question=
s and answers to bring=20

me straight to you?"  "No, Count Godensky, I do not," I answered steadily. =
But a sudden=20

illuminating ray did show me, even as I spoke, what _might_ be in his schem=
ing mind.  "Then I=20

must be clear, and, above all, frank. Du Laurier loves you. You love him. Y=
ou mean, I think, to=20

marry him. But deeply in love as he is, he is a very proud fellow. He will =
have all or nothing, if I=20

judge him well; and he would not take for his wife a woman who accepts=20
