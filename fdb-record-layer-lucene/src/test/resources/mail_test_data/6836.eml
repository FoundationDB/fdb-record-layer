AEons, synthesized by the seventh, the Parent Potency, passed into Act, and=
 emanated, in their=20

turn, six secondary AEons, which were each synthesized by their respective =
Parents. In the=20

_Philosophumena_ we read that Simon compared the AEons to the "Tree of Life=
." Said Simon in=20

the _Revelation_:(800)       It is written that there are two ramifications=
 of the universal     AEons,=20

having neither beginning nor end, issued both from the same     Root, the i=
nvisible and=20

incomprehensible Potentiality, Sige     [Silence]. One of these [series of =
AEons] appears from=20

above. This     is the Great Potency, Universal Mind [or Divine Ideation, t=
he     Mahat of the=20

Hindus]; it orders all things and is male. The other     is from below, for=
 it is the Great [manifested]=20

Thought, the     female AEon, generating all things. These [two kinds of AE=
ons]=20

corresponding(801) with each other, have conjunction and manifest     the m=
iddle distance [the=20

struggle commenced with parliament. The motive given for all the taxes summ=
arily imposed and to=20

which the parliament had made opposition, was the necessity of sustaining t=
he honor of France=20

and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy. Now, since the affair of Nordl=
ingen, they had=20

experienced nothing but reverses; the parliament had a plea for calling Maz=
arin to account for=20

imaginary victories, always promised, ever deferred; but this time there re=
ally had been fighting, a=20

triumph and a complete one. And this all knew so well that it was a double =
victory for the court, a=20

victory at home and abroad; so that even when the young king learned the ne=
ws he exclaimed,=20

"Ah, gentlemen of the parliament, we shall see what you will say now!" Upon=
 which the queen had=20

pressed the royal child to her heart, whose haughty and unruly sentiments w=
ere in such harmony=20

with her own. A council was called on the same evening, but nothing transpi=
red of what=20

incomprehensible Air which has neither beginning nor end.(802)   This femal=
e "Air" is our Ether, or=20

the kabalistic Astral Light. It is, then, the Second World of Simon, born o=
f Fire, the principle of=20

everything. We call it the ONE LIFE, the Intelligent, Divine Flame, omnipre=
sent and infinite. In=20

Simon's system this Second World was ruled by a Being, or Potency, both mal=
e and female, or=20

active and passive, good and bad. This Parent-Being, like the primordial in=
finite Potency, is also=20

called "that which has stood, stands and will stand," so long as the manife=
sted Kosmos shall last.=20

When it emanated _in actu_ and became like unto its own Parent, it was not =
dual or androgyne. It=20

is the Thought (Sige) that emanated from it which became as itself (the Par=
ent), having become=20

like unto its image (or antetype); the second had now become in its turn th=
e first (on its own plane=20

or sphere). As Simon has it:       It [the Parent or Father] was one. For h=
aving it [the Thought] in=20

itself, it was on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dam=
e in honor of the=20

victory of Lens.  The following Sunday, then, the Parisians arose with joy;=
 at that period a Te=20

Deum was a grand affair; this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and=
 it produced a great=20

effect. The shops were deserted, houses closed; every one wished to see the=
 young king with his=20

mother, and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one=
 wished to be=20

deprived of his presence. Moreover, great liberty prevailed throughout the =
immense crowd; every=20

opinion was openly expressed and chorused, so to speak, of coming insurrect=
ion, as the thousand=20

bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum. The police belonging =
to the city being formed=20

by the city itself, nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this co=
ncert of universal hatred or=20

freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips.  Nevertheless, at eight o'cl=
ock in the morning the=20

regiment of the queen's guards, commanded by Guitant,=20


_
preexisting; but manifesting itself to itself from itself, it     became th=
e second (or dual). Nor was it=20

called Father before it     [the Thought] gave it that name. As, therefore,=
 itself developing     itself=20

by itself, manifested to itself its own Thought, so also     the Thought be=
ing manifested did not act,=20

but seeing the Comminges, marched publicly, preceded by drums and trumpets,=
 filing off from the=20

Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame, a manoeuvre which the Parisians witnesse=
d tranquilly,=20

delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms.  Friquet=
 had put on his Sunday=20

clothes, under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had=20
