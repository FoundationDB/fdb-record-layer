romancer was on the road toward the modern habit of satire, a road which he=
 had marked out for=20

us clearly enough in some of his early sketches and tales.  The trend away =
from the literature of=20

art to the literature of satire is all the more remarkable in our day becau=
se the exigencies of satire=20

compel the American to deny wholesale his better self. There might be some =
apparent reason for=20

not writing in the epic or the tragic tone if in order to do so we had to a=
ssume virtues we all knew=20

we lacked; but why make a religion of writing satire, when to do so we must=
 conceal the few=20

virtues we are sure we have? Mr. Howells took it to be his duty to tell the=
 unvarnished truth about=20

human society as he knew it, but you would not guess from his novels that A=
merica ever produced=20

so charming a man as Mr. Howells and those literary friends of his of whom,=
 outside his novels, he=20

wrote lovingly. So Mr. Lewis pictures America today=E2=80=94leaving out of =
the picture the satirical=20

criticism of America in which he leads, and so Mrs. Wharton shows us the na=
rrower world of=20

fashion, with no one in it so gifted, so admirably trained, as Mrs. Wharton=
. The best of us is hard=20

enough to express, as Rabbi Ben Ezra knew, but how odd that we prefer not t=
o express it, whether=20

difficult or easy=E2=80=94that we deliberately conceal what we have set our=
 hearts on. We name half a=20

dozen characters from his plays in whom Shakespeare seems to be portraying =
himself, and=20

without too subtle a discrimination we recognize ideals of our own in all o=

ourselves that outright that of the former, and so was soon able to regain =
military supremacy in=20

Brittany, and to begin her plans for breaking off the marriage between Anne=
 de Bretagne and=20

Maximilian. Had the latter been a native Burgundian, or had he concentrated=
 his resources for the=20

attainment of one capital object, the whole history of France might have be=
en changed: we might=20

have seen a second Burgundian power, now strengthened by the rugged and yet=
 unsubdued=20

Brittany, hemming France in on the east, on the west, on the north, and utt=
erly stunting the growth=20

of that national unity which was to make France a great and homogeneous pow=
er. But Maximilian=20

was busy patching up the power of his Austrian dominions, and trying to kee=
p on reasonably good=20

terms with his Flemish subjects; meanwhile, he thought his bride might look=
 out for herself, and=20

was not aware that Anne de Beaujeu was preparing a coup that would deprive =
him forever of=20

Brittany.  The influence of Anne de Beaujeu was already showing signs of a =
decline; and it=20

therefore behooved her to work while it was yet day, for the time was fast =
coming when her boy=20

king would no longer submit to sisterly tyranny. Charles was in his twentie=
th year when, in the=20

spring of 1491, he made his first independent move, with a prospect of stil=
l more dangerous=20

manifestations of independence. One evening he left Plessis, as if to go hu=
nting, and rode toward=20

Bourges. He had secretly given orders that Louis d'Orleans should be releas=
ed, and went to meet=20

and be reconciled with this dangerous adversary of his sister. Louis, who h=
ad been sobered by his=20

confinement, was overjoyed at his release,=20

novelist incorporated in those portraits some of our own best features. We=
=E2=80=94and Cervantes=E2=80=94are=20

incarnated in Don Quixote.  The contrast between information and art in our=
 books, and the=20

tendency to stress information with a moral bent, are both thrown into shar=
per relief by the=20

success of American architecture in expressing more and more a significant =
and lasting beauty.=20

Nothing might seem at first more utilitarian than a building, and few thing=
s in our country seem=20

less permanent, we have such a passion for altering. Yet art has made its g=
reatest progress with=20

us in the king with every manifestation of loyal devotion and respect. Fort=
unately, Louis cherished=20

no feelings of resentment against the house of Beaujeu, and willingly acced=
ed to the formal=20

reconciliation proposed by the king, signing, with Pierre de Bourbon, a tre=
aty of amity and fraternal=20

love, in which all past wrongs and differences were to be forgotten. Louis =
was faithful to the spirit=20

of this agreement, and France had no longer to fear his factious activity. =
And when Dunois, always=20

ready to plot, always ready to undo his own plots, also agreed to a reconci=
liation, the=20


_
progress have been accompanied by just such a selection and choice of subje=
ct as Aristotle=E2=80=99s=20

remarks about character would imply. In our cities a genuine impulse toward=
 beauty began to=20

show itself two decades ago in shop-windows. Where else should beauty appea=
r but in the have=20

been weakened, but the ultimate triumph of the principles for which she had=
 contended was=20

assured. Though no longer dominant in all things, she could yet shape the p=
olicy of the kingdom=20

and contrive the ruin of Maximilian's ambitious schemes.  To unite France a=
nd Brittany=20

care most about? Since we were lovers of business, we began to indicate the=
 beauty that=20

business has in our eyes. The shop-window ceased to be, what in country har=
dware stores it still=20

often is, a place where samples of all the merchandise were displayed, an o=
rder card from which=20

you could plan your purchases; it became rather a scene of loveliness to co=
ntemplate for its own=20

sake, an attraction to hold you rooted to the spot rather than a stimulus t=
o hurry you inside to buy.=20

Probably the shop-windows in our great streets could again and again had th=
e dream proved a=20

delusion. Louis XI, always awake to every possible chance of advantage, had=
 bought the claims of=20

the heiress of the ancient line of Charles de Blois and Jeanne de Penthievr=
e; but no opportunity of=20

profiting by these claims had been vouchsafed his greedy soul. Now the cove=
ted province seemed=20

more hopelessly alienated than ever. For Anne de Bretagne was married to Ma=
ximilian, and the=20

young King of France was solemnly betrothed to the daughter of Maximilian, =
Marguerite, who had=20

actually been=20
