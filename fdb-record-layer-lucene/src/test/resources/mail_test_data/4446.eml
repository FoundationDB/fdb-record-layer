the Colored Race in America." She could not find but a few pages of it when interviewed but 

declared she had owned the entire book for years. The pages she had and showed with such 

pride were 415 to 449 inclusive. The book was written in the year 1836 and the few pages 

produced by her gave information concerning the Negro, Lovejoy of St. Louis, Missouri. It is the 

same man for whom the city of Lovejoy, Illinois is named. The other book she holds with pride and 

guards jealously is "The College of Life" by Henry Davenport Northrop D.D., Honorable Joseph R. 

Gay and Professor I. Garland Penn. It was entered, according to the Act of Congress in the year 

1900 by Horace C. Fry, in the office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, D.C. (3)

Florida December 5, 1936  EDWARD LYCURGAS   "Pap tell us 'nother story 'bout do war--and 

'bout de fust time you saw mamma."  It has been almost 60 years since a group of children 

gathered about their father's knee, clamoring for another story. They listened round-eyed to stories 

they already knew because "pap" had told them so many times before. These narratives along 

with the great changes he has seen, were carefully recorded in the mind of Edward, the only one 

of this group now alive.  "Pap" was always ready to oblige with the story they never tired of. He 

could always be depended upon to begin at the beginning, for he loved to tell it.  "It all begun with 

our ship being took off the coast of Newport News, Virginia. We wuz runnin' the beauty; they are a 

priceless part of the heritage of a great industrial nation, and one which lost can never be restored. 

The only difference I ever had with my fellow-citizens in Oxford during a pretty long residence, 

arose out of my opposition to a measure which would have marred the historic character and the 

beauty of our city, while I was positively assured on the best authority that it was commercially 

inexpedient. If Thirlmere can be spared, spare Thirlmere; but if it is really needed to supply those 

masses with a necessary of life, the loveliest lake by which poet or artist ever wandered could not 

be put to a nobler use. I am glad in this to follow the Bishop of Manchester, who is not made of 

coarse clay, though he cares for the health as well as for the religion of his people. A schism 

between aesthetic Oxford and industrial Lancashire would be a bad thing for both; and South 

Kensington, which, while it teaches art, joins hands with industry, surely does well. It is needless to 

debate before this audience the question whether there is any essential antagonism between art 

or esthetic culture, and the tendencies of an age of science. An accidental antagonism there may 

be, an essential antagonism there cannot be. What is science but truth, and why should not truth 

and beauty live together? Is an artist a worse painter of the human body from being a good 

anatomist? Then why should he be a worse painter of nature generally, because he knows her 

secrets, or because they are being explored in his time? Would he render moonlight better if he 

believed the moon was a green cheese? Art and Science dwelt together well enough in the minds 

of Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo. In the large creative mind there is room for both; though 

the smaller and merely perceptive mind being fixed on one may sometimes not have room for the 

other. True, the perfect concord

Northerners. We aint had nothin' to do wid de war, unnerstand, we English folks was at'ter de 

money. Whose War? The North and South's, of course. I hear my captain say many a time as how 

they was playin' ball wid the poor niggers. One side says 'You can't keep your niggers lessen you 

pay em and treat em like other folks.' Mind you dat wasn't de rale reason, they was mad at de 

South but it was one of de ways dey could be hurted--to free de niggers."  "De South says 'Dese is 

our niggers and we'll do dum as we please,' and so de rumpus got wuss dan it was afore. The 

North had all do money, and called itself de Gov'ment. The South aint had nothin', but a 

termination not to be out-did, so we dealt wid de North. De South was called de Rebels."  "So 

when dey see a ship off they coast, they hailed it and when we kep goin', they fired at us. 'Twan't 

long afore we was being unloaded and marched off to the lousiest jail I ever been in. My captain 

kep tellin' em we was English subjects and could not be helt. Me, I was a scairt man, cause I may 

be still to come, and come, we hope, both concords will. One word more before we distribute the 

prizes. A system of prizes is a system of competition, and to competition some object. We can 

readily sympathise with their objection. Work done from love of the subject, or from a sense of 

duty, is better than work done for a prize, and, moreover, we cherish the hope that co-operation, 

not competition, will be the ultimate principle of industry, and the final state of man. But nothing 

hinders that, in working for a prize as in working for your bread, you may, at the same time, be 

working from sense of duty and love of the subject, and though co-operation may be our final 

state, competition is our present. Here the competition is at least fair. There can hardly be any 

doubt that the prize system often calls into activity powers of doing good work which would 

otherwise have lain dormant, and if it does this it is useful to the community, though the individual 

needs to be on his guard against its drawbacks in himself. In reading

all black men should be slaves."  "The jailer felt of my muscles one day, when he had marched me 

out at the point of his musket to fill de watering troughs for de horses. He wanted to know who I 

blong ter, and offered to buy me. When nobody claimed me, they was forced to let me go long wid 

de other Britishers and as our ship had been destroyed, we had to git back home best we could. 

Dey didn't dare hold us no longer."  "As de war was still being fit, we was forced to separate, 

cause a lot of us would cause spicion, Althorp the other day I was struck with the fact, for a fact, I 

think, it evidently was, that England had owed one of her worthiest and most useful statesmen to a 

college competition, which aroused him to a sense of his own powers, and of the duty of using 

them, whereas he would otherwise never have risen above making betting books and chronicling 

the performances of foxhounds. Perhaps about the worst consequence of the prize system, 

against which, I have no doubt, your Instructor guards, is undue discouragement on the

southward and way from de war belt, traveling as far as Saint Augustine. It was a dangerous 

journey, as anybody was liable to pick me off for a runaway slave. I was forced to hide in de day 

time if I was near a settlement and travel at night. I met many runaway slaves. Some was trying to 

get North and fight for de freeing of they people; others was jes runnin' way cause dey could. 

Many of dem didn't had no idea where dey was goin' and told of havin' good marsters. But one 

prize. And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish you were to receive your rewards from a hand 

which would lend them any additional value. But though presented by me they have been awarded 

by good judges; and as they have been awarded to you, I have no doubt you have deserved them 

well.     THE ASCENT OF MAN.   Science and criticism have raised the veil of the Mosaic 

cosmogony and revealed to us the physical origin of man. We see that, instead of being created 

out of the dust
