confidence of every soul in King's Warren.  "I fear, squire, hers is not a =
bodily affection," said Mrs.=20

Dodd with a deep sigh.  "Good Gad! you don't mean to say her mind's giving =
way?" anxiously=20

demanded the prosaic squire.  "Oh no, we fancy it's an affection of the hea=
rt."  "Impossible! at her=20

age. Why she's fifty," emphatically asserted the old gentleman.  "Not fifty=
, Mr. Warrender; Stacey=20

Dodd is but forty-one."  "You don't say so. I should never have thought it.=
"  The opening of the=20

engagement had egregiously failed. At present the campaign seemed most unpr=
omising. When a=20

gentleman of mature years looks upon a lady as fifty, he can hardly be susp=
ected of designs upon=20

her virgin heart, or of a wish to destroy her peace of mind. Beaten in her =
attack on the outposts,=20

Mrs. Dodd changed her strategy with that multiplicity of resource that alwa=
ys distinguishes the=20

greatest generals--she determined at once to carry the war into the enemy's=
 country.  "You must=20

miss the girls very much, squire," she said as she took up a little painted=
 hand-screen, to protect=20

her complexion, on which she lavished much anxious care, from the fierce bl=
aze of the fire. "Yes,"=20

she continued, "you must feel it very dull at The Warren now. Quite lonely,=
 I fear."  "No," answered=20

the squire cheerfully, "I have Miss Hood, you know, and we play bezique or =
backgammon of an=20

evening."  "Ah," replied Mrs. Dodd severely, and horrible visions of those =
dangerous evenings=20

flashed through the mind of the indignant woman. In her there had been occa=
sional=20

correspondence; and, being of a somewhat impetuous disposition, he rode off=
 at once from his=20

hotel to Lincoln=E2=80=99s Inn.  Mr. Giles listened to the narrative with u=
nbroken interest and unswerving=20

patience, with his eyes fixed on his client, and occasionally giving a symp=
athetic nod.  =E2=80=9CAnd so,=E2=80=9D=20

concluded Lothair, =E2=80=9CI thought I would come to you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWe are honored,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Giles. =E2=80=9CAnd,=20

certainly, it is quite absurd that your lordship should want money, and for=
 a worthy purpose, and=20

not be able to command it. Why! the balance in the name of the trustees nev=
er was so great as at=20

this moment; and this very day, or to-morrow at farthest, I shall pay no le=
ss than eight-and-thirty=20

thousand pounds timber-money to the account.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I don=
=E2=80=99t want a fifth of that,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.=20

=E2=80=9CYour lordship has an objection to apply to the trustees?=E2=80=9D =
inquired Mr. Giles.  =E2=80=9CThat is the point of=20

the whole of my statement,=E2=80=9D said Lothair somewhat impatiently.  =E2=
=80=9CAnd yet it is the right and regular=20

thing,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Giles.  =E2=80=9CIt may be right and it may be reg=
ular, but it is out of the question.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThen=20

we will say no more about it. What I want to prevent,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Gil=
es, musingly, =E2=80=9Cis any thing=20

absurd happening. There is no doubt if your lordship went into the street a=
nd said you wanted ten=20

thousand pounds, or a hundred thousand, fifty people would supply you immed=
iately=E2=80=94but you=20

would have to pay for it. Some enormous usury! That would be bad; but the a=
bsurdity of the thing=20

would be greater=20

gazing at Miss Hood's shapely arm and hand, for though Miss Hood was the sa=
me age as her=20

sister-in-law, she still had a very shapely arm and hand.  "Yes," said the =
squire, "and she reads me=20

the girls' letters; they are a great consolation, for Georgie seems so thor=
oughly happy."  What=20

more dangerous occupation for a hale old gentleman than to sit and listen b=
y the hour to the=20

written raptures of his mischief. Roundells, Giles, and Roundell could not =
help you in that manner.=20

That is not our business. We are glad to find money for our clients at a le=
gal rate of interest, and=20

the most moderate rate feasible. But then there must be security, and the b=
est security. But here=20

we must not conceal it from ourselves, my lord, we have no security whateve=
r. At this moment=20

your lordship has no property. An=20
