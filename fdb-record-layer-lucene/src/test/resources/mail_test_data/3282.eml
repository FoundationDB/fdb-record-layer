 Phoebus was highly gratified. He was pleased with his reception. There was=

natched from the=20

back of his camel while crossing, and was carried off by a crocodile. Anoth=
er man had been taken=20

during the last week while swimming the river upon a log. It was supposed t=
hat these accidents=20

were due to the same crocodile, who was accustomed to bask upon a mud bank =
at the foot of the=20

cotton plantation. On the day following our arrival at the Atbara, we found=
 that our camel-drivers=20

had absconded during the night with their camels; these were the men who ha=
d been forced to=20

serve by the Governor of Cassala. There was no possibility of proceeding fo=
r some days, therefore=20

I sent El Baggar across the river to endeavour to engage camels, while I de=
voted myself to a=20

search for the crocodile. I shortly discovered that it was unfair in the ex=
treme to charge one=20

particular animal with the death of the two Arabs, as several large though =
they could invent=20

entered the port of Joppa they observed another English yacht in those wate=
rs; but, before they=20

could speculate on its owner, they were involved in all the complications o=
f landing. On the quay,=20

the Russian vice-consul was in attendance with horses and mules, and donkey=
s handsomer than=20

either. The ladies were delighted with the vast orange-gardens of Joppa, wh=
ich Madame Phoebus=20

said realized quite her idea of the Holy Land.  =E2=80=9CI was prepared for=
 milk and honey,=E2=80=9D said=20

Euphrosyne, =E2=80=9Cbut this is too delightful,=E2=80=9D as she travelled =
through lanes of date-bearing palm-trees,=20

and sniffed with her almond-shaped nostrils the all-pervading fragrance.  T=
hey passed the night at=20

Arimathea, a pretty village surrounded with=20


_
various places. A smaller one was lying asleep high and dry upon the bank; =
the wind was blowing=20

strong, so that, by carefully approaching, I secured a good shot within thi=
rty yards, and killed it on=20

the spot by a bullet through the head, placed about an inch above the eyes.=
  After some time, the=20

large crocodiles, who had taken to the water at hospitality, in an old conv=
ent, but all the comforts=20

of Europe and many of the refinements of Asia had been forwarded for their =
accommodations.  =E2=80=9CIt=20

is a great homage to art,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Phoebus, as he scattered his go=
ld like a great seigneur of=20

Gascony.  The next day, two miles from Jerusalem, the consul met them with =
a cavalcade, and the=20

ladies=20

of the muddy river to their basking-places upon the bank. A crocodile usual=
ly sleeps with its mouth=20

wide open; I therefore waited until the immense jaws of the nearest were we=

a grand row of glittering teeth, when I crept carefully towards it through =
the garden of thickly-

planted cotton. Bacheet and Wat Gamma followed in great eagerness. In a sho=
rt time I arrived=20

within about forty yards of the beast, as it lay upon a flat mud bank forme=
d by one of the numerous=20

torrents that had carried down the soil wearied with their journey, but wer=
e quite prepared, in due=20

time, to join his dinner-party, which he was most anxious they should atten=

English lords=E2=80=9D who had arrived, and whom he had invited to meet the=

know their names, though that, unfortunately, the consul could not tell the=
m, but he had sent to the=20

English consulate to have them written down. All he could assure them was, =
that they were real=20

English lords, not travelling English lords, but in sober earnestness great=
