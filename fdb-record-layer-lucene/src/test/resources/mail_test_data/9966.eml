the arrogance of the aristocrats, the sins of M. le duc and his family, the=
 evil conduct of the King=20

and the immorality of the Queen: and men in ragged coats and tattered breec=
hes came in from=20

Nantes, and even from Paris, in order to harangue these village lads and to=
ld them yet further=20

tales of innumerable wrongs suffered by the people at the hands of the aris=
tos, and stuffed their=20

heads full of schemes for getting even once and for all with those men and =
women who fattened=20

on the sweat of the poor and drew their luxury from the hunger and the toil=
 of the peasantry.=20

Pierre sucked in these harangues through every pore: they were meat and dri=
nk to him. His hate=20

and passions fed upon these effusions till his whole being was consumed by =
a maddening desire=20

for reprisals, for vengeance--for the lust of triumph over those whom he ha=
d been taught to fear.=20

And in the low, narrow room of the auberge the fevered heads of village lad=
s were bent together in=20

conclave, and the ravings and shoutings of a while ago were changed to whis=
perings and low=20

murmurings behind barred doors and shuttered windows. Men exchanged cryptic=
 greetings when=20

ges. M. le duc's=20

overseers saw nothing, heard nothing, guessed nothing. M. le cure saw much =
and old Jean Adet=20

guessed a great deal, but they said nothing, for nothing then would have av=
ailed.  Then came the=20

catastrophe.   II  Pierre pushed open the outer door of the auberge des Tro=
is Vertus and stepped=20

out under the porch. A gust of wind caught him in the face. The night, so t=
he chronicles of the time=20

tell us, was as dark as pitch: on ahead lay the lights of the last?"  "Ay, =
that they have.  At least one=20

Red-skin has got you," said Peter. "Have a care, man, don't struggle so vio=
lently.  Okematan won't=20

scalp you."  The sound of his brother's voice quieted Davidson, and at once=
 restored his memory.=20

"Cast me loose, Peter," he said; "you're a good fellow.  I see you have bro=
ught me along wi' you,=20

and I feel like a giant refreshed now, tho' somewhat stiff.  Have we come f=
ar?"  "I don't know how=20

far we've come, but I know that we've been pegging along the whole night, a=
nd that we must have=20

breakfast before we take another step.  It's all very well for you, Dan, to=
 lie there all night like a=20

mere bag o' pemmican enjoying yourself, but you must remember that your bro=
ther is mortal, and=20

so are the dogs, to say nothing o' the Red-skin."  While he was speaking, t=
he youth undid the=20

fastenings, and set his brother free, but Dan was far too anxious to indulg=
e in pleasantries just=20

then.  After surveying the landscape, and coming to a conclusion as to wher=
e they were, he took a=20

hurried breakfast of dried meat--cold. The dogs were also treated to a hear=
ty feed, and then,=20

resuming the march, the rescuers pushed on with renewed vigour--Dan Davidso=
n now beating the=20

track, and thus rendering it more easy for those who came behind him.  All =
that day they pushed=20

on almost without halt, and spent the next night in a clump of willows; but=
 Dan was too anxious to=20

take much rest. They rose at the first sign of daybreak, and pushed on at t=
heir utmost speed, until=20

the poor dogs began to show signs of breaking down; but an extra hour of re=
st, and a full=20

lowed him in silence.=20

They were a little sobered now that they came out into the open and that th=
e fumes of cider and of=20

hot, perspiring humanity no longer obscured their vision or inflamed their =
brain.  They knew=20

 had to do writers and=20
