"It isn't worth much."  "It cost five dollars."  "Then you got cheated. It =
never was worth half the=20

money. What do you want on it?"  The seamstress intended to ask a dollar an=
d a half, but after=20

this depreciation she did not venture to name so high a figure.  "A dollar =
and a quarter," she said.=20

"A dollar and a quarter!" repeated the old man, shrilly. "Take it home with=
 you. I don't want it."=20

"What will you give?" asked the poor girl, faintly.  "Fifty cents. Not a pe=
nny more."  "Fifty cents!"=20

she repeated, in dismay, and was about to refold it. But the thought of her=
 rent in arrears changed=20

her half-formed intention.  "I'll take it, sir."  The money and similar nat=
ure I had ever seen before.=20

An upright block of wood, burned from the centre of a tree, stood in the st=
ream, hollowed out in the=20

centre to contain the maize; water ran up a little channel, and released a =
pestle, which fell with a=20

heavy thud upon the corn, with the result that if one left a basket full in=
 the great mortar over-night,=20

by morning it was pounded, saving that labour which God Himself seems to ha=
ve thought not so=20

ennobling after all, as He first instituted it to carry out a curse.  So on=

attic-room, coughing as she went.  "Now, ma'am," said Eliakim.  His new cus=
tomer was an Irish=20

woman, by no means consumptive in appearance, red of face and portly of fig=
ure.  "And what'll ye=20

be givin' me for this?" she asked, displaying a pair of pantaloons.  "Are t=
hey yours, ma'am?" asked=20

Eliakim, with a chuckle.  "It's not Bridget McCarty that wears the breeches=
," said that lady. "It's me=20

husband's, and a dacent, respectable man he is, barrin' the drink, which tu=
rns his head. What'll ye=20

give for 'em?"  "Name your price," said Eliakim, whose principle it was to =
insist upon his customers=20

making the first offer.  "Twelve shillin's," said Bridget.  "Twelve shillin=
gs!" exclaimed Eliakim,=20

holding up both hands. "That's all they cost when they were new."  "They co=

"Only six months, and they ain't been worn more'n a month."  "I'll give you=

repeated Mrs. McCarty, turning to the other customers, as if to call their =
attention to an offer so out=20

of proportion to the valuable article she held in her hand. "Only fifty cin=
