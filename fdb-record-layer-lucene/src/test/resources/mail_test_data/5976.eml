dracaena marginata a view of it, and, punctual as the clock, with his black=

  I hadn't looked at the papers yet. My only knowledge of last night's drea=
dful happenings had come from Uncle Eric and Lord Robert West. I had said t=
o myself that I didn't wish to read the newspaper accounts of the murder, a=
nd of Ivor's supposed part in it. I remembered now, however, that I did not=
 even know in what part of Paris the house of the murder was. I recalled on=
ly the name of the street, because it was a curiously grim _
and, at his request, brought the large Bible, which always occupied a consp=
icuous place in Ben's=20

home. Very few words were exchanged, but Franks felt that the portion of Sc=
ripture selected by=20

the curate was peculiarly well suited to deepen any impression which the la=
te conversation might=20

have left. It was the fifty-first psalm which Mr. Leyton read, almost witho=
ut comment, by the sick-

bed of one just beginning to have his eyes opened to the truth that he, too=
, had need to cry, _Have=20

mercy upon me, O Lord! Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right spirit=
 within me!_  The eyes=20

of Ben Stone were never again to be utterly closed to that truth; as life's=
 day waned, a better light=20

dawned on the invalid's soul.  [J] 1 John iii. 3.  [K] Hebrews xii. 10.    =
 XXIII.  The Wife's Resolve.=20

On, on flowed the stream, round and round went the mill-wheel; and even so =
flows the current of=20

time, and the circle of daily occupation goes round and round. Little Bessy=
, the miller's child, used=20

every afternoon to watch Ned and his little band of workers going cheerfull=
y to their toil; for the=20

short cut to Wild Rose Hollow was through the wooded glen. Whistling and si=
nging, laughing and=20

shouting, the boys came along, and often a nosegay from a cottage garden, o=
r a garland of=20

flowers from the hedge, was left on the way for Bessy. The almshouses she a=
lways called _her_=20

cottages, and the boys who labored to repair them _her_ workmen; and must b=
e reported."  With=20

this, he ordered Ivor to leave the room, in a tone which sounded to me so b=
rutal that I should have=20

liked him to be shot, and the whole French police force exterminated. To he=
ar a little underbred=20

policeman dare to speak like that to my big, brave, handsome Englishman, an=
d to know that it=20

would be childish and undignified of Ivor to resist--oh, I could have kille=
d the creature with my own=20

hands--I think!  As for Ivor, he said not another word, except "good-bye," =
smiling half sadly, half=20

with a twinkle of grim humour. Then he went out, with his head high: and ju=
st at the door he threw=20

me back one look. It said as plainly as if he had spoken: "Remember, I know=
 you won't fail me."  I=20

did indeed remember, and I prayed that I should have pluck and courage not =
to fail. But it was a=20

very hard thing that he had asked me to do, and he had said well in saying =
that he would not ask it=20

of me if it did not mean more than his life.  The words he had whispered so=
 hastily and=20

unexpectedly in Spanish, were these: "Go to the room of the murder alone, a=
nd on the window=20

balcony find in a box under flower-pots a folded document. Take this to Max=
ine. Every moment=20

counts."  So it seemed that it was always of her he thought--of Maxine de R=
enzie! And I, of all=20

people in the world, was to help him, with her.  As I thought of this task =
he'd set me, and of all it=20

meant, it appeared more and more incredible that he should=20


_
stream, was to build a whole village of cottages, the prettiest that ever w=
ere seen, so that every=20

poor old woman in England might have one with a garden all brilliant with f=
lowers.  Before Ned and=20

his "jovial crew," as he called the school-boys, had left off working in Wi=
ld Rose Hollow, just at the=20

hour of six they always saw John Sands return from visiting the hospital of=
 B----. The Hollow,=20

though a thing of me. But--it "meant more than his life." And I would do th=
e thing, if it could be=20

done, because of my pride.  As I drove away from the prison a kind of fury =
grew in me and=20

possessed me. I felt as if I had fire instead of blood in my veins. If I ha=
d known that death, or=20

worse than death, waited for me in the ghastly house to which Ivor had sent=
 me, I would still have=20

gone there.  My first=20
