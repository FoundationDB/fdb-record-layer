dracaena marginata collapse.  There was a great fish supper at Forest Lodge=
 that night. The skin, head, tail and fins of Old Muskie were carefully pre=
served and sent to the best taxidermist in Chicago; but there was enough le=

and sent to the best taxidermist in Chicago; but there was enough left of h=
is fifty-three-pound body for the company gathered about the big "Oak Hall"=
 stated in simple language that Whitney C. Witt was claiming seventy-two th=

the life and death of the great painter Priam Farll, and his _
avoid.  Stubbornly the big fish pulled in the opposite direction, and with =
a rush started across the=20

cove. So fast did the line run out that Lee's thumb was almost blistered, b=
ut he held it hard against=20

the spinning reel, and the fish rushed on across the cove.  Straight throug=
h the forest of rushes he=20

dashed, and Lee and Carl held their breath, as the line cut through the wat=
er. Lee held the rod=20

high, Carl sent the canoe along the track taken by the fish; and in a few d=
izzy seconds Old Muskie=20

was through the rushes and out into the open lake. And now Lee made no effo=
rt to check him, but=20

let him run as far as possible from the shore, newspaper of a morning. And =
coffee went cold, and=20

bacon fat congealed, from the Isle of Wight to Hexham, while the latest rum=
ours were being=20

swallowed. It promised to be stupendous, did the case of Witt _v_. Parfitts=
. It promised to be one=20

of those cases that alone make life worth living, that alone compensate for=
 the horrors of climate,=20

in England. And then the day of hearing arrived, and the afternoon papers w=
hich appear at nine=20

o'clock in the morning announced that Henry Leek (or Priam Farll, according=
 to your wish) and his=20

wife (or his female companion and willing victim) had returned to Werter Ro=
ad. And England held=20

its breath; and=20


_
continued his mad rush till less than thirty feet of line remained on his r=
eel.  Forest Lodge was=20

quickly awake and astir. Mr. Gardner was just at the landing for a trip acr=
oss the lake, when out in=20

front of him came the canoe as if being towed by the great fish, which leap=
ed high into the air.  He=20

rushed into Forest Lodge and roused Mr. Cameron and all the rest by beating=
 upon his door and=20

crying, "Get up! Get up! Your fifty-pound maskinonge is hooked, and by a bo=
y!" No further call was=20

needed, and the beach was soon lined with a score of fishermen and their wi=
ves, hastily and some=20

of them grotesquely dressed.  Meanwhile, Lee and Carl had begun working tog=
ether to regain the=20

line that had been run out. The victory could never have come to the young =
fisherman but for the=20

masterly way in which Carl handled the canoe. He made it almost a part of L=
ee. It moved with his=20

motion, always responsive, always steady.  When the fish went out toward th=
e open lake, the boat=20

went with him, that he might go as far as he would. When he made a wild rus=
h for the shore, the=20

paddle sent the boat off at an angle to his course, that the steel rod migh=
t exert a pull sidewise,=20

and thus turn him from his course, and back toward the open lake.  And all =
this time, Lee was=20

putting on his tackle all the strain that he dared, holding the line so tau=
t that his arm ached before=20

the fight had been on ten minutes--and it lasted fifty-five.  When Old Musk=
ie would leap frantically=20

into the air, fiercely shaking himself, down would go the tip of the rod, c=
lear below the surface of=20

the water; and when he would "sound," the tip of the rod pulled upward rele=
ntlessly. Whatever the=20

direction of the rushes of the big fish, always the skilled hand and wiry a=
rm of Lee Henly were=20

ready to baffle and turn aside, to hold back and to weary.  "Pretty fight!"=
 said Herbert Gerrish to=20

Mr. Cameron, who was watching in silence, but with keen admiration.  "Fine!=
" said Mr. Cameron.=20

"Never saw a better."  "Think he'll land the fish?" asked John Newby.  "If =
he does not now, he is=20

bound to do it some day," replied Mr. Cameron. "That fish might just as wel=
l give it up now as any=20

time. I know Lee Henly."  Indeed, it began to look as if victory was near. =
Slowly the rushes of the=20

maskinonge were becoming less fierce. Carl had the gaff at hand for Lee whe=
n stirred in its Celtic=20

dream.   _Mention of Two Moles_   The theatre in which the emotional drama =
of Witt Parfitts was=20

to be played, lacked the usual characteristics of a modern place of enterta=
inment. It was far too=20

high for its width and breadth; it was badly illuminated; it was draughty i=
n winter and stuffy in=20

summer, being completely deprived of ventilation. Had it been under the con=
trol of the County=20

Council it would have been instantly condemned as dangerous in case of fire=
, for its gangways=20

were always encumbered and its exits of a mediaeval complexity. It had no s=
tage, no footlights,=20

and all its seats were of naked wood except one.  This unique seat was occu=
pied by the principal=20

player, who wore a humorous wig and a brilliant and expensive scarlet costu=
me. He was a fairly=20

able judge, but he had mistaken his vocation; his rare talent for making th=
ird-rate jokes would have=20

brought him a fortune in the world of musical comedy. His salary was a hund=
red a week; better=20

comedians have earned less. On the present occasion he was in the midst of =
a double row of=20

fashionable hats, and beneath the hats were the faces of fourteen feminine =
relatives and=20

acquaintances. These hats performed the function of 'dressing' the house. T=
he principal player=20

endeavoured to behave as though under the illusion that he was alone in his=
 glory, but he failed.=20

There were four other leading actors: Mr. Pennington, K.C., and Mr. Vodrey,=
 K.C., engaged by the=20

plaintiff, and Mr. Cass, K.C., and Mr. Crepitude, K.C., engaged by the defe=
ndant. These artistes=20

were the stars of their profession, nominally less glittering, but really f=
ar more glittering than the=20

player in scarlet. Their wigs were of inferior quality to his, and their co=
stumes shabby, but they did=20



not mind, for whereas he got a hundred a week, they each got a hundred a da=
y. Three junior=20

performers received ten guineas a day apiece: one of them held a watching b=
rief for the Dean and=20

Chapter of the Abbey, who, being members of a Christian fraternity, were pa=
ined and horrified by=20

the defendants' implication that they had given interment to a valet, and w=
ho were determined to=20

resist exhumation at all hazards. The supers in the drama, whose business i=
t was to whisper to=20

each other and to the players, consisted of solicitors, solicitors' clerks,=
 and experts; their=20


_
the boat, dared not work the fish round for Carl to gaff, but kept him at t=
he end of the boat where=20

he himself might use the big hook.  But what he had feared came to pass. Th=
e big maskinonge did=20

make a run under the boat. He was straight in front, when with a lightning-=
like dash he made a=20

half-circle and went under the boat from the side.  With a quick motion of =
arm and wrist, Lee threw=20

the end of the rod over the prow of the canoe. It was all there was to do, =
but the rod would surely=20

have struck the end of the boat, and something would probably have broken a=
nd the fish escaped,=20

had not Carl, with a mighty stroke of the paddle, backed the canoe so quick=
ly that Lee was almost=20

thrown overboard. But the fish was saved.  The fight was nearly over. emolu=
ments worked out at=20

the rate of a hundred and fifty pounds a day. Twelve excellent men in the j=
ury-box received=20

between them about as much as would have kept a K.C. alive for five minutes=
. The total expenses=20

of production thus amounted to something like six or seven hundred pounds a=
 day. The=20

preliminary expenses had run into several thousands. The enterprise could h=
ave been made=20

remunerative by hiring for it Convent Garden Theatre and selling stalls as =
for Tettrazzini and=20

Caruso, but in the absurd auditorium chosen, crammed though it was to the p=
erilous doors, the=20

loss was necessarily terrific. Fortunately the affair was subsidized; not m=
erely by the State, but=20

also by those two wealthy capitalists, Whitney C. Witt and Mr. Oxford; and=
=20


_
toward the sandy beach. Mr. Cameron had got a big, long-handled gaff-hook, =
and now, forgetful of=20

his rheumatism, waded out waist-deep into the water. There was a brief but =
decisive struggle that=20

went hopelessly against the fish, and Mr. Cameron gaffed Old Muskie and dra=
gged him ashore.=20

Lee and management were in a position to ignore paltry financial considerat=
ions and to practise=20

art for art's sake.  In opening the case Mr. Pennington, K.C., gave instant=
 proof of his astounding=20

histrionic powers. He began calmly, colloquially, treating the jury as frie=
nds of his boyhood, and=20

the judge=20
