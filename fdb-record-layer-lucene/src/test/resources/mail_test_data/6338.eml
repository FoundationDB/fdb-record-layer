Jack and Nat could hear cries of alarm, and they could see several waving f=
irebrands and note ghostly figures circling about the camp blaze.  "Can you=
 stop your horse, Jack?" called Nat.  "I'm not going that country went down=

It certainly was, and the horses were having no easy task. But they kept on=
, as if they knew just=20

where they were going.  The boys were beginning to get a bit anxious again,=
 wondering if, after all,=20

the horses were taking them right, when the bad lands came to a sudden end.=
 There were no=20

more of the sawtooth peaks.  "Hurrah, we're out of 'em!" cried Jack.  "Yes,=
 and look where we=20

are," said Jack. "Nowhere near camp."  They were on the shoulder of a steep=
 mountain, while=20

below them, wrapped in the fast approaching night, was a great valley. Then=
 something else=20

caught the eyes of the boys.  "There's a fire!" called Nat, pointing to a b=
laze at the foot of the=20

mountain.  "I'll wager it's our camp," declared Jack. "Here goes for a hail=
."  He shouted and fired=20

his gun. In a few seconds there came an answering call, and a firebrand was=
 waved in the air.=20

"That's Bony's neither can be disregarded without suffering. When the child=
ren of Israel went into=20

the Promised Land God told them to let their land rest every seven years, a=
nd He would give them=20

as much in six years as in seven. For four hundred and ninety years they di=
sregarded that law. But=20

mark you, Nebuchadnezzar came and took them off into Babylon, and kept them=
 seventy years in=20

captivity, and the land had its seventy sabbaths of rest. Seven times seven=
ty is four hundred and=20

ninety. So they did not gain much by breaking this law. You can give God Hi=
s day, or He will take=20

it.  On the other hand, honoring the fourth commandment brings blessing. "I=
f thou turn away thy=20

foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the=
 sabbath a delight, the=20

holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways,=
 nor finding thine own=20

pleasure, nor=20


_
knuckle bones."  "Yes, but how are we to get down?" asked Jack. "I don't se=
e the sign of a trail."=20

The next instant his horse answered the question for him by starting right =
down the side of the=20

mountain, which at that point was composed of shaling stones, and quite smo=
oth.  "Where you=20

going?" cried Nat.  "I don't know," answered Jack. "My horse seems to want =
to take a slide."  Then=20

Nat's steed followed the other, and a moment later the two lads, on the bac=
ks of their animals,=20

were sliding, stumbling and slipping down the contrasted with what God enjo=
ins), then shalt thou=20

delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high pl=
aces of the earth, and feed=20

thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father, for the mouth of the Lord hath =
spoken it."  I do not know=20

what will become of this republic if we give up our Christian sabbath. If S=
atan can break the=20

conscience down on one point, he can break it down on all. When I was in Fr=
ance in 1867, I could=20

not tell one day from the other. On Sunday stores were open and buildings w=
