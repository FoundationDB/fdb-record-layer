young gentleman whom I have brought here to our home for a few days until i=
t will be safe for him=20

to be seen in Deadwood. Mr. Redburn, I make you acquainted with Anita."  A =
courteous bow from=20

Redburn, a slight inclination of Anita's head, and the introduction was mad=
e. A moment later the=20

three entered the cabin, a model of neatness and primitive luxury.  "How is=
 it that you are up so=20

early, dear?" young Harris asked, as he unbuckled his belt and hung it upon=
 a peg in the wall.=20

"You are rarely as spry, eh?"  "Indeed! I have not been to bed at all," rep=
lied the girl, a weary smile=20

wreathing her lips. "I was nervous, and feared something was going to happe=
n, so I staid up."=20

"Your old plea--the presentiment of coming danger, I suppose," and the yout=
h laughed, gayly. "But=20

you need not fear. No one will invade our little Paradise, right away. What=
 is your opinion of it,=20

Redburn?"  "I should say not. I think this little mountain retreat is witho=
ut equal," replied Harry, with=20

enthusiasm. "The only wonder is, how did you ever stumble into such a delig=
htful place."  "Of that I=20

will perhaps tell you, another time," said Harris, musingly.  Day soon dawn=

and the early morning sunlight fell with dressed that you can't romp and pl=

good of a book, I say, if it is too pretty for use?  I like to have my book=

like to talk back to them.  "Take my Bible, here," he continued, as he took=
 up an old and much-

worn copy of the book.  "I have a number of copies of the Great Book: one c=
opy I preach from;=20

another I minister from; but this is my own personal copy, and into it I ta=
lk and talk.  See how I=20

talk," and he opened the Book and showed interleaved pages full of comments=
 in his handwriting.=20

"There's where St. Paul and I had an argument one day. Yes, it was a long a=
rgument, and I don't=20

know now who won," he added smilingly.  "But then, no one ever wins in an a=
rgument, anyway, do=20

you think so?  "You see," went on the preacher, "I put into these books wha=

articles and essays for magazines and papers.  I never write for publicatio=

church when something comes to me to say.  There is always danger of a man =
spreading himself=20
