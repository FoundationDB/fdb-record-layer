Nothing came of the President's admonition except committee reports in the two Houses, both 

favorable to the Bank; in fact, the Senate report was copied almost verbatim from a statement 

supplied by Biddle. A year later Jackson returned to the subject, this time with an alternative plan 

for a national bank to be organized as a branch of the Treasury and hence to have "no means to 

operate on the hopes, fears, or interests of large masses of the community." In a set of autograph 

notes from which the second message was prepared the existing Bank was declared not only 

unconstitutional but dangerous to liberty, "because through its officers, loans, and participation in 

politics it could build up or pull down parties or men, because it created a monopoly of the money 

power, because much of the stock was owned by foreigners, because it would always support him 

who supported it, and because it weakened the state and strengthened the general government." 

Congress paid no attention to either criticisms or recommendations, and the supporters of the 

Bank took fresh heart.  When Congress again met, in December, 1831, a presidential election was 

impending and everybody was wondering what part the bank question would play. Most 

Democrats were of the opinion that the subject should be kept in the background. After all, the 

present bank charter had more than four years to run, and there seemed to be no reason for 

injecting so thorny an issue into the campaign. With a view to keeping the bank authorities quiet, 

two members of the reconstructed Cabinet, Livingston and McLane, entered into a modus vivendi 

with Biddle under which the Administration agreed not to push the issue until after the election. In 

his annual report as Secretary of the Treasury, McLane actually made an argument for 

rechartering the Bank; and in his message of the 6th of December the President said that, while 

he still held "the opinions heretofore expressed in relation to the Bank as at present organized," he 

would "leave it for the present to the investigation of an enlightened people and their 

representatives." He had been persuaded that his own plan for a Bank, suggested a year earlier, 

was not feasible.  Biddle now made a supreme mistake. Misled in some degree unquestionably by 

the optimistic McLane, he got the idea that Jackson was weakening, that the Democrats were 

afraid to take a stand on the subject until after the election, and that now was the strategic time to 

strike for a new charter. In this belief he was further encouraged by Clay, Webster, and other 

leading anti-Administration men, as well as by McDuffie, a Calhoun supporter and chairman of the 

Ways and Means Committee of the House. There was small doubt that a bill for a new charter 

could be carried in both branches of Congress. Jackson must either sign it, argued Biddle's 

advisers, or run grave risk of losing Pennsylvania and other commercial States whose support was 

necessary to his election. On the other hand, Biddle was repeatedly warned that an act for a new 

charter would be vetoed. He chose to press the issue and on January 9, 1832, the formal 

application of the Bank for a renewal of its charter was presented to Congress, and within a few 

weeks bills to recharter were reported in both Houses.  Realizing that defeat or even a slender 

victory in Congress would be fatal, the Bank flooded Washington with lobbyists, and Biddle himself 

appeared upon the scene to lead the fight. The measure was carried by safe majorities--in the 

Senate, on the 11th of June, by a vote of 28 to 20, and in the House on the 3d of July, by a vote of 

107 to 86. To the dismay of the bank forces, although it ought not to have been to their surprise, 

Jackson was as good as his word. On the 10th of July the bill was vetoed. The veto message as 

transmitted to the Senate was probably written by Taney, but the ideas were Jackson's--ideas 

which, so far as they relate to finance and banking operations, have been properly characterized 



as "in the main beneath contempt." The message, however, was intended as a campaign 

document, and as such it showed great ingenuity. It attacked the Bank as a monopoly, a "hydra of 

corruption," and an instrumentality of federal encroachment on the rights of the States, and in a 

score of ways appealed to the popular distrust of capitalistic institutions. The message acquired 

importance, too, from the President's extraordinary claim to the right of judging both the 

constitutionality and the expediency of proposed legislation, independently of Congress and the 

Courts.  The veto plunged the Senate into days of acrid debate. Clay pronounced Jackson's 

construction of the veto power "irreconcilable with the genius of representative government." 

Webster declared that responsibility for the ruin of the Bank and for the disasters that might follow 

would have to be borne by the President alone. Benton and other prominent members, however, 

painted Jackson as the savior of his country; and the second vote of 22 to 19 yielded a narrower 

majority for the bill than the first had done. Thus the measure perished.  that the said Robert 

should love the said Countess as his dear aunt, and the said Countess the said Robert as her 

dear nephew" which both swore to do.  While Mahaut was forced to contend in the courts for her 

authority over Artois, the rebellion of the nobles on the death of Philippe le Bel had not been 

without serious results in Artois, where she had found it no easy task to maintain any sort of hold 

upon her vassals. Her chief counsellor, and a faithful servitor he proved, was Thierry d'Hirecon, 

whom the vassals of Artois hated as a parvenu foreigner he was from the Bourbonnais. In 1314 

her vassals began complaining to Mahaut of abuses in the government; but they soon passed 

from peaceful and legitimate remonstrance to active outrages upon the servants and the property 

of their countess. In all this Robert d'Artois was no doubt the hidden instigator. One of Mahaut's 

officers, Cornillot, bailli of Hesdin, who had incurred the enmity of the Sire de Crequi by interfering 

with his hunting over field and forest without regard for the rights of others, was set upon by a mob 

of villains who hanged him to a tree; when the weight of his body broke the limb and brought the 

poor wretch to the ground, they buried him in the earth up to his neck, cut off his head, and carried 

it as a trophy to the Sire de Crequi. Mahaut despatched her son with a considerable force to arrest 

two of the rebel vassals in the act of going to war; they were taken to prison, but unwisely released 

by the intervention of the king, and on the very steps of the prison proclaimed their intention of 

going over to Mahaut's enemy, Robert. Some of the nobles came upon the young count and his 

sister, Jeanne, in a country house, insulted them grossly, and even threw mud in the face of the 

defenceless Jeanne and her brother, who had with them but three knights. Jeanne fled to Hesdin, 

where Mahaut was at the time, and on the road her carriage was surrounded by a mob of knights, 

who terrified her by their insults and their threats. At last both she and Mahaut were forced to 

abandon Artois till quieter days should come, leaving the officers and armies of the king to restore 

order, a task not completed until July, 1319.  The rebels committed so many outrages, and the 

public peace was so frequently disturbed by their quarrels, that the better element was ready to 

welcome Mahaut as a deliverer when she came back, fortified by the recent decree of the king in 

her favor. At Arras a sort of triumphal procession was arranged to welcome her, and "she entered 

seated upon a chariot, preceded by thirteen banners, accompanied by the Constable of France, by 

Thierry d'Hirecon,--who, like his mistress, had been driven to flight,--and, more wonderful still, by 

many bold knights who had long sworn to destroy her." The next day the countess gave a splendid 

banquet, at which were present "the Constable, all the knights, the burgesses and notables (of 



Arras), and besides many ladies." The towns in particular were glad to have their countess once 

more in power; indeed, all the towns except Arras had remained faithful to her, resisting the 

enticing proposals of Robert d'Artois and the rebel nobility, for well the burgesses knew that only a 

strong hand could protect them and their goods from the rapacity of nobles who were always in 

want of money and always ready to take the first that came to hand. To two of the emissaries of 

the rebels the citizens of Saint-Omer gave answer that their countess "was a good guardian of 

their law and their privileges, and if she were not they should make complaint to none but the 

King;" while they told the emissaries of Robert d'Artois, who dared not affirm that the king had 

decided in favor of their patron, "then we are not makers of any Count of Artois."  Though severe 

in her administration of justice and strict in the maintenance of order within her dominions, Mahaut 

appears to have been just, even kind, and hence able to command the respect of her subjects. 

With the citizens of Arras she exchanges courteous greetings and gifts; cloths, wine, fish, come to 

her from the townspeople; and she invites to her table the burgesses and their wives. When she is 

ill, they send to inquire solicitously after her health, and she replies: "Mahaut, Countess d'Artois, 

etc.... to our beloved and faithful _echevin_ and twenty-four burgesses of Arras, greeting and love. 

We are much pleased, and heartily do we thank you for that you sent to inquire concerning our 

health.... Therefore we wish you to know that on the day when this letter was written we were in 

good bodily health, thanks be to God.... Give greeting in our name to all our good subjects, and be 

assured that as soon as we shall be able we will journey into that part of the country. Our Lord 

have you in His care. Given at Bracon, the thirteenth day of August." What a quaint and yet 

dignified and kindly letter is this, showing us at once the great feudal lady and the woman really 

grateful for kindly sympathy.  Another episode, immediately preceding her triumphant reentry into 

Artois, reveals again the feminine

The President was unquestionably right in interpreting his triumph as an endorsement of the veto, 

and he naturally felt that the question was settled. The officers and friends of the Bank still hoped, 

however, to snatch victory from defeat. They had no expectation of converting Jackson or of 

carrying a charter measure at an early date. But they foresaw that to wind up the business of the 

Bank in 1836 it would be necessary to call in loans and to withdraw a vast amount of currency 

from circulation, with the result of a general disturbance, if not a severe crippling, of business. 

This, they thought, would bring about an eleventh-hour measure giving the Bank a new lease of 

life.  Jackson, too, realized that a sudden termination of the activities of the Bank would derange 

business and produce distress, and that under these circumstances a charter might be wrung from 

Congress in spite of a veto. But he had no intention of allowing matters to come to such a pass. 

His plan was rather to cut off by degrees the activities of the Bank, until at last they could be 

suspended altogether without a shock. The most obvious means of doing this was to withdraw the 

heavy deposits made by the Government; and to this to find that this energetic, courageous 

Mahaut can be, at need, such a very woman. The royal troops had restored order in Artois, and 

the vassals of Mahaut, leagued against her authority, had been reduced to submission and had 

consented to a peaceful settlement of their alleged grievances and to the return of their lawful 

countess. On July 3, 1319, the royal commissioners came to her mansion in Paris to read her the 

treaty, in the presence of her counsellors. She protested that the treaty violated her privileges, and 

declared she would not listen to the reading of an agreement in which she could not alter a word. 

Tears flowed, and the excited lady now would, now would not, listen to the reading; and that, too, 

when she admitted that she, like the nobles of the league, had sworn to submit their differences to 

the arbitration of the king, and that she would keep her oath! Summoning her notary to draw up a 

formal act of protest,--"all that she might say or swear would be said or sworn against her will and 

her conscience, and in the fear of losing her county of Artois,"--she hurried to Longchamp, into the 

presence of the king. Philippe assured her that all had been done in good faith to safeguard her 


_
It was not, however, all plain sailing. Under the terms of the charter of 1816 public funds were to 

be deposited in the Bank and its branches unless the Secretary of the Treasury should direct that 

they be placed elsewhere; and such deposits elsewhere, together with actual withdrawals, were to 

be reported to Congress, with reasons for such action. McLane, the Secretary of the Treasury, 

was sake that he would require her to swear to observe the treaty. Presto! the doubts and the 

tears disappear: "I swear it!" And the countess went out in apparent peace of mind. But now she 

was met by two of her relatives, her nephew and her cousin, who pointed out to her that her oath 

was insufficient, because she had not specified exactly what it was that she swore; an oath so 

vague might
