In some unexplainable way he felt that this cruel creature was his master. =
 He was subdued and=20

held by a terrible grip.  To the bear the man was always a mystery.  There =
was something fearful=20

about him that he could not fathom and his source of strength the poor beas=
t could not=20

understand.  There was also an evil-smelling dark bottle in the Italian's i=
nside coat-pocket, which=20

was an enigma.  It was not ginger pop or beer, or any kind of soda water; B=
lack Bruin knew all of=20

these drinks himself, and this drink was like none of them.  One day Pedro =
had fallen into a=20

strange deep sleep and the bottle had slipped from his pocket.  The bear ha=
d at once noticed it,=20

picked it up and pulled out the cork, just as he would have done with a gin=
ger pop bottle, and had=20

taken a small swallow.  But the strange stuff had burned his tongue and cho=
ked him.  So he spat it=20

out and broke the bottle with a single blow of his powerful paw.  He finall=
y licked up considerable=20

of the whisky, as it was a hot day and he was thirsty.  It had made him sle=
epy, so man and beast=20

had lain down together in a drunken stupor.  After this day Black Bruin hat=
ed the bottle, out of=20

which Pedro drank so frequently.  They were also unlucky in getting meals w=
hen his master did=20

this, for the simple country folk did not like to lodge or feed them when t=
he dark, sinister-looking=20

man was half drunk.  So in many ways the bottle brought them ill-luck.  Whe=
n Black Bruin and his=20

companion began their wanderings from town to town, it was early spring-tim=
e.  The buds were=20

just beginning to redden upon the sugar-maple and the grass along sunny sou=
thern slopes, was=20

putting on its first faint touch of green.  The days were warm and sunny, p=
romising buds and=20

blossoms, but the nights were still clear and cold.  At first they had to l=
ie close together at night for=20

warmth, or rather the man had to cuddle down close to his shaggy warm compa=
nion; but spring=20

soon passed and summer came and the two wanderers reveled in the lavish bea=
uty and richness=20

of nature.  In many of the pastures blueberries grew in profusion and Black=
 Bruin needed no=20

teaching to get his share of the palatable fruit.  Along all the country ro=
ads, growing upon the stone=20

walls and fences, were delicious red raspberries, which are much finer flav=
ored than the cultivated=20

kinds.  Later on, when August laid her golden treasures in the lap of Mothe=
r Earth, the blackberries=20

ripened in wild profusion. First in the open pasture came the low bushberri=
es, and then the high=20

bushberries along the edge of the forest.  Last of all came autumn with its=
 treasures of harvest,=20

fruits, nuts, melons and grains.  Wild grapes they found in abundance and a=
ll the nut-bearing trees=20

rattled down their treasures for them.  The melon-patch, the pound sweeting=
 tree, the peach-

orchard and the turnip-field all paid toll to the vagabonds.  So, in spite =
of harsh treatment and hard=20

work, Black Bruin laid on his usual layers of fat, against the long sleep o=
f the coming winter.  What=20

wonderful days these were when they wandered lazily from village to village=
, through long=20

stretches of flaming red and golden forest, where the roadway was spread wi=
th a most gorgeous=20

leaf-carpet.  They heard the jay squalling in the corn-field, and the crows=
 gathering in the clan for=20

their annual caucus.  The squirrels chattered in the trees above them, but =
their old friends, the=20

song-birds, had nearly all flown away to the South to escape the oncoming w=
inter.  When Jack=20

Frost and the merry north winds had robbed the trees of the last of their f=
oliage and they stood out=20

grim and gaunt against the bleak November sky; when the last purple asters =
and the hardiest=20

bright goldenrod had faded, Black Bruin felt the old winter drowsiness slow=
ly stealing upon him.  At=20

last the first snow-storm came and that settled it in both the minds of Ped=
ro and the bear.  So the=20

Italian led his companion far up into a wilderness region, and after search=
ing about for half a day=20

among the ledges found a natural cave which was about the size of a small r=
oom, and here left=20



Black Bruin to sleep away the winter months.  He stayed in the region just =
long enough to make=20

sure that the winter drowsiness had clutched him and also took the precauti=
on to roll against the=20

entrance of the cave, a large stone, which he had to move with a lever, tha=
t he might be sure of=20

finding his partner in Vagabondia when he returned for him in the early spr=
ing.  Pedro would take=20

the precaution to come back a few days before the bear would naturally awak=
en.  A day or two=20

after Black Bruin was left alone in his cavern a heavy storm set in, and be=
fore it ceased, a foot of=20

snow had fallen.  It was now so deep that the passer-by would never have gu=
essed that a bear=20

was soundly sleeping a few feet back of the boulder which Pedro had placed =
countries only for=20

that purpose. And then they talked of horses, and then they talked of women=
.  Lothair was rather=20

silent; for in this society of ancients, the youngest of whom was perhaps n=
ot less than five-and-

twenty, and some with nearly a lustre added to that mature period, he felt =
the awkward modesty of=20

a freshman. The Duke of Brecon talked much, but never at length. He decided=
 every thing, at least=20

to his own satisfaction; and if his opinion were challenged, remained unsha=
ken, and did not=20

conceal it.  All this time a different scene was enacting at the other end =
of the table. St. Aldegonde,=20

with his back turned to his other neighbor, hung upon the accents of Mr. Pi=
nto, and Hugo Bohun=20

imitated St. Aldegonde. What Mr. Pinto said or was saying was quite inaudib=
le, for he always=20

spoke low, and in the present case he was invisible, like an ortolan smothe=
red in vine-leaves; but=20

every now and then St. Aldegonde broke into a frightful shout, and Hugo Boh=
un tittered=20

immensely. Then St. Aldegonde, throwing himself back in his chair, and talk=
ing to himself or the=20

ceiling, would exclaim, =E2=80=9CBest thing I ever heard,=E2=80=9D while Hu=
go nodded sympathy with a beaming=20

smile.  The swells now and then paused in their conversation and glanced at=
 the scene of=20

disturbance.  =E2=80=9CThey seem highly amused there,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Bra=
ncepeth. =E2=80=9CI wish they would pass it=20

on.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI think St. Aldegonde,=E2=80=9D said the Duke of Bre=
con, =E2=80=9Cis the least conventional man of my=20

acquaintance.=E2=80=9D  Notwithstanding this stern sneer, a practiced gener=
al like Mr. Brancepeth felt he=20

had won the day. All his guests would disperse and tell the world that they=
 had dined with him and=20

met St. Aldegonde, and to-morrow there would be a blazoned paragraph in the=
 journals=20

commemorating the event, and written as if by a herald. What did a little d=
isturb his hospitable=20

mind was that St. Aldegonde literally tasted nothing. He did not care so mu=
ch for his occasionally=20

leaning on the table with both his elbows, but that he should pass by every=
 dish was distressing.=20

So Mr. Brancepeth whispered to his own valet=E2=80=94a fine gentleman, who =
stood by his master=E2=80=99s chair=20

and attended on no one else, except, when requisite, his master=E2=80=99s i=
mmediate neighbor=E2=80=94and=20

desired him to suggest to St. Aldegonde whether the side-table might not pr=
ovide, under the=20

difficulties, some sustenance. St. Aldegonde seemed quite gratified by the =
attention, and said he=20

should like to have some cold meat. Now, that was the only thing the side-t=
able, bounteous as was=20

its disposition, could not provide. All the joints of the season were named=
 in vain, and pies and=20

preparations of many climes. But nothing would satisfy St. Aldegonde but co=
ld meat.  =E2=80=9CWell, now I=20

shall begin my dinner,=E2=80=9D he said to Pinto, when he was at length ser=
ved. =E2=80=9CWhat surprises me most=20

in you is your English. There is not a man who speaks such good English as =
you do.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CEnglish is=20

an expressive language,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Pinto, =E2=80=9Cbut not difficult=
 to master. Its range is limited. It consists,=20

as far as I can observe, of four words: =E2=80=98nice,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98jo=
lly,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98charming,=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98bore;=E2=80=99 and s=
ome grammarians=20

add =E2=80=98fond.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D  When the guests rose and returned to =
the saloon, St. Aldegonde was in high spirits,=20

and talked to every one, even to the Duke of Brecon, whom he considerately =
reminded of his=20



defeat in the morning, adding that from what he had seen of his grace=E2=80=
=99s guns he had no opinion of=20

them, and that he did not believe that breech-loaders suited pigeon-shootin=
g.  Finally, when he=20

bade farewell to his host, St. Aldegonde assured him that he =E2=80=9Cnever=
 in his life made so good a=20

dinner, and that Pinto had never been so rich.=E2=80=9D  When the party bro=
ke up, the majority of the=20

guests went, sooner or later, to a ball that was given this evening by Lady=
 St. Jerome. Others, who=20

never went to balls, looked forward with refined satisfaction to a night of=
 unbroken tobacco. St.=20

Aldegonde went to play whist at the house of a lady who lived out of town. =
=E2=80=9CI like the drive home,=E2=80=9D=20

he said; =E2=80=9Cthe morning air is so refreshing when one has lost one=E2=
=80=99s money.=E2=80=9D  A ball at St. Jerome=20

House was a rare event, but one highly appreciated. It was a grand mansion,=
 with a real suite of=20

state apartments, including a genuine ballroom in the Venetian style, and l=
ighted with chandeliers=20

of rock-crystal. Lady St. Jerome was a woman of taste and splendor and roma=
nce, who could do=20

justice to the scene and occasion. Even Lord St. Jerome, quiet as he seemed=
, in these matters=20

was popular with young men. It was known that Lord St. Jerome gave, at his =
ball suppers, the=20

same champagne that he gave at his dinners, and that was of the highest cla=
ss. In short, a patriot.=20

We talk with wondering execration of the great poisoners of past ages, the =
Borgias, the inventor of=20

aqua tofana, and the amiable Marchioness de Brinvilliers; but Pinto was of =
opinion that=20


_
white snowdrift that some freak of the wind had piled upon the mountainside=
.  In the dark and the=20

silence of his underground room Black Bruin slept through the winter blizza=
rds and cold as well as=20

he would have done in warmer and more comfortable quarters.  No sound broke=
 the silence of his=20

cave save his own deep breathing.  If the sun shone, or the winds howled, o=
r the storms beat, he=20

knew it not.  Perhaps in dreamland he still wandered up and down the countr=
y picking blueberries=20

or poking under the dead leaves for nuts, and always and forever doing tric=
ks until his legs and=20

back ached.  As for Pedro, he had no idea of hibernating, so he went away t=
o a distant city and=20

worked for a fellow countryman in a fruit store.  But work was not to his l=
iking and he longed for=20

spring to the darkest, and the most demoralized periods, and then none of t=
hem are punished;=20

which is so strange, he would add, as they are all found out.  Lady St. Jer=
ome received Lothair, as=20

Pinto said, with extreme unction. She looked in his eyes, she retained his =
hand, she said that what=20

she had heard had made her so happy. And then, when he was retiring, she be=
ckoned him back=20

and said she must have some tea, and, taking his arm, they walked away toge=
ther. =E2=80=9CI have so=20

much to tell you,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cand every thing is so interes=
ting. I think we are on the eve of great=20

events. The monsignore told me your heart was with us. It must be. They are=
 your own thoughts,=20

your own wishes. We are realizing your own ideal. I think next Sunday will =
be remembered as a=20

great day in English history; the=20


_
and his companion might again be upon the road living the old free life.   =
  CHAPTER VIII  THE=20

BEAST AND THE MAN  A sense of pain and annoyance penetrated the deep sleep =
of Black=20

Bruin, and with a growl and a start he awoke.  When he had fallen asleep hi=
s mountain cavern had=20

been quite dark.  It had always been dark when he awoke and stretched himse=
lf, but now the full=20

glory of daylight was streaming in.  There before him, dark, sinister and f=
orbidding as ever, stood=20

Pedro, and in his hand was the sharpened stick with which he had been prodd=
ing him, causing=20

him to awaken.  As Black Bruin arose in response to his blows, he shook him=
self, and stretched=20

first one cramped leg and then another, which were stiff after his long sle=
ep.  Pedro could not help=20

but notice how he had grown and what a great brute he was getting to be.  "=
Holy saints," he=20

ejaculated, "but he is one pig deevil-bear.  I must club heem and prod heem=
 much, or he eat me.=20

He em one deevil."  Black Bruin felt a sense of irritation at the coming of=
 his master and followed=20

him sullenly as he led the way out of the winter quarters into the full day=
.  How sweet and fresh=20

was the air and how bright and beautiful the world.  Then, for the first ti=
me, there came an almost=20

overpowering longing for freedom.  He had often felt it slightly, but now i=
t nearly mastered him and=20

he all but broke into open rebellion.  The deep woods were calling to him. =
 The wild free life was=20

his by right.  He was no dog to be led about upon a chain, and to go and co=
me at the beck of man.=20

He was a wild beast whose home was the wilderness, and this cruel creature,=
 who tyrannized over=20

him, and prodded him, for whom he did tricks day after day, had stolen away=
 his freedom.  Of=20

course Black Bruin did not think these thoughts in just this way. To him th=
ey were dim and=20

inexpressible; he only felt a wild rage at being restrained and made a capt=
ive and a hot desire to=20

be off.  So it was with this ill-disguised humor that he followed his maste=
r from town to town and=20

did his tricks.  Pedro, on the other hand, felt that the bear was becoming =
morose and that his spirit=20

must be broken, so he prodded and beat him until his life was almost unbear=
able.  One evening=20

the two camped near the edge of a spruce woods.  Along one side of the road=
 ran a turbulent=20

stream, which was at the bottom of a deep gorge.  At several points one cou=
ld look down from fifty=20

to one hundred feet to the water, foaming and lashing and rushing upon its =
way.  For a part of the=20

distance the bank was almost perpendicular, and here the passer-by was prot=
ected from falling=20

into the abyss by a railing that was spiked to posts or convenient trees.  =
To-night, Pedro was=20

sleeping soundly, his head pillowed upon his great coat, that he carried in=
 the spring and fall=20

against inclement weather. He no longer pillowed his head upon Black Bruin,=
 who was chained to=20

a near-by tree.  The beast now also wore a muzzle and this was one more gri=
evance which he=20

nourished in his heart against the time of vengeance.  Black Bruin was not =
asleep, but was=20

watching first his master and then the flickering light of their camp-fire.=
  As he watched and=20

pondered, the tyranny of his monsignore, I know, has told you all.=E2=80=9D=
  Not exactly; the Oxford visit=20

had deranged a little the plans of the monsignore, but he had partially com=
municated the vast=20

scheme. It seems there was a new society to be instituted for the restorati=
on of Christendom. The=20

change of name from Christendom to Europe had proved a failure and a disast=
rous one. =E2=80=9CAnd=20

what wonder?=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome. =E2=80=9CEurope is not even a q=
uarter of the globe, as the=20

philosophers pretended it was. There is already a fifth division, and proba=
bly there will be many=20

more, as the philosophers announce it impossible.=E2=80=9D The cardinal was=
 to inaugurate the institution=20

on Sunday next at the Jesuits=E2=80=99 Church, by one of his celebrated ser=
mons. It was to be a function of=20

the highest class. All the faithful of consideration were to attend, but th=
e attendance was not to be=20



limited to the faithful. Every sincere adherent of church principles who wa=
s in a state of prayer and=20

preparation, was solicited to be present and join in the holy and common wo=
rk of restoring to the=20

Divine Master His kingdom upon earth with its rightful name.  It was a bril=
liant ball. All the =E2=80=9Cnice=E2=80=9D=20

people in London were there. All the young men who now will never go to bal=
ls were present. This=20

was from respect to the high character of Lord St. Jerome. Clare Arundel lo=
oked divine, dressed in=20

a wondrous white robe garlanded with violets, just arrived from Paris, a pr=
esent from her god-

mother, the Duchess of Lorrain-Sehulenbourg. On her head a violet-wreath, d=
eep and radiant as=20

her eyes, and which admirably contrasted with her dark golden-brown hair.  =
Lothair danced with=20

her, and never admired her more. Her manner toward him was changed. It was =
attractive, even=20

alluring. She smiled on him, she addressed him in tones of sympathy, even o=
f tenderness. She=20

seemed interested in all he was doing; she flattered him by a mode which is=
 said to be irresistible=20

to a man, by talking only of himself. When the dance had finished, he offer=
ed to attend her to the=20

tea-room. She accepted the invitation even with cordiality.  =E2=80=9CI thi=
nk I must have some tea,=E2=80=9D she=20

said, =E2=80=9Cand I like to go with my kinsman.=E2=80=9D  Just before supp=
er was announced, Lady St. Jerome told=20

Lothair, to his surprise, that he was to attend Miss Arundel to the great c=
eremony. =E2=80=9CIt is Clare=E2=80=99s=20

ball,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome, =E2=80=9Cgiven in her honor, and you a=
re to take care of her.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am more than=20

honored,=E2=80=9D said Lothair. =E2=80=9CBut does Miss Arundel wish it, for=
, to tell you the truth, I thought I had=20

rather abused her indulgence this evening?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9COf course she=
 wishes it,=E2=80=9D said Lady St. Jerome.=20

=E2=80=9CWho should lead her out on such an occasion=E2=80=94her own ball=
=E2=80=94than the nearest and dearest=20

relation she has in the world, except ourselves?=E2=80=9D  Lothair made no =
reply to this unanswerable=20

logic, but was as surprised as he was gratified. He recalled the hour when =
the kinship was, at the=20

best, but coldly recognized, the inscrutable haughtiness, even distrust, wi=
th which Miss Arundel=20

listened to the exposition of his views and feelings, and the contrast whic=
h her past mood=20

presented to her present brilliant sympathy and cordial greeting. But he yi=
elded to the magic of the=20

flowing hour. Miss Arundel, seemed,=20


_
his nose and the chain was a continual reminder of his slavery.  Pedro had =
prodded and clubbed=20

him this spring until his body was sore.  He no longer had the slightest sp=
ark of affection for the=20

man, but instead a fearful hate that burned in his breast like living coals=
.  The sound of Pedro's=20

deep breathing also filled him with a to-night, full of vivacity, fancy, fe=
eling=E2=80=94almost fun. She was=20

witty, and humorous, and joyous, and fascinating. As he fed her with cates =
as delicate as her lips,=20

and manufactured for her dainty beverages which would not outrage their pur=
ity, Lothair, at last,=20

could not refrain from intimating his sense of her unusual but charming=20


_
rage.  It seemed as if he could feel all the prods that he had received fro=
m the stick at once, and=20

each stung him with a new pain.  His breath came thick and hot and his eyes=
 glowed with all the=20

deep intensity of hate;--hate, that had long smouldered, fed  =E2=80=9CNo,=
=E2=80=9D she said, turning round with=20

animation, =E2=80=9Cmy natural disposition, always repressed, because I hav=
