philodendron monstera   With regard to the claim made by some Kabalists that there was in antiquity one knowledge and one language, this claim is also our own, and it is very just. Only it must be added, to make the thing clear, that philodendron monstera   With regard to the claim made by some Kabalists that there was in antiquity one knowledge and one language, this claim is also our own, and it is very just. Only it must be added, to make the thing clear, that _
quite a different edition.(324) The Books of Moses and of Joshua are disfigured out of recognition 

by the Talmudists, they say.  (2) The "black Jews" of Cochin, Southern India--who know nothing of 

the Babylonian Captivity or of the _ten_ "lost tribes" (the latter a pure invention of the Rabbis), 

proving that these Jews must have come to India before the year 600 B.C.--have their Books of 

Moses which they will show to no one. And these Books and Laws differ greatly from the present 

scrolls. Nor are they written in the square Hebrew characters (semi-Chaldaic and semi-Palmyrean) 

but in the archaic letters, as we were assured by one of them--letters entirely unknown to all but 

themselves and a few Samaritans.  (3) The Karaim Jews of the Crimea--who call themselves the 

descendants of the true children of Israel, _i.e._, of the Sadducees--reject the _Torah_ and the 

_Pentateuch_ of the Synagogue, reject the Sabbath of the Jews (keeping Friday), will have neither 

the Books of the Prophets nor the _Psalms_--nothing but their own Books of Moses and what they 

call his one and real Law.  This makes it plain that the _Kabalah_ of the Jews is but the distorted 

echo of the Secret Doctrine of the Chaldaeans, and that the real _Kabalah_ is found only in the 

Chaldaean _Book of Numbers_ now in the possession of some Persian Sufis. Every nation in 

antiquity had its traditions based on those of the Aryan Secret Doctrine; and each nation points to 

this day to a Sage of its own race who had received the primordial revelation from, and had 

recorded it under the orders of, a more or less divine Being. Thus it was with the Jews, as with all 

others. They had received their Occult Cosmogony and Laws from their Initiate, Moses, and they 

have now entirely mutilated them.  Adi is the generic name in our Doctrine of all the first men, 

_i.e._, the first speaking races, in each of the seven zones--hence probably "Ad-am." And such 

first men, in every nation, are credited with having been taught the divine mysteries of creation. 

Thus, the Sabaeans (according to a tradition preserved in the Sufi works) say that when the "Third 

First Man" left the country adjacent to India for Babel, a tree(325) was given to him, then another 

and a third tree, whose leaves recorded the history of all the races; the "Third First Man" meant 

one who belonged to the Third Root-Race, and yet the Sabaeans call him Adam. The Arabs of 

Upper Egypt, and the Mohammedans generally, have recorded a tradition that the Angel Azaz-el 

brings a message from the Wisdom-Word of God to Adam whenever he is reborn; this the Sufis 

explain by adding that this book is given to every Seli-Allah ("the chosen one of God") for his wise 

men. The story narrated by the Kabalists--namely, that the book given to Adam before his Fall (a 

book full of mysteries and signs and events which either had been, were, or were to be) was taken 

away by the Angel Raziel after Adam's Fall, but again restored to him lest men might lose its 

wisdom and instruction; that this book was delivered by Adam to Seth, who passed it to Enoch, 

and the latter to Abraham, and so on in succession to the most wise of every generation--relates 

to all nations, and not to the Jews alone. For Berosus narrates in his turn that Xisuthrus compiled 

a book, writing it at the command of his deity, which book was buried in Zipara(326) or Sippara, 

the City of the Sun, in Ba-bel-on-ya, and was dug up long afterwards and deposited in the temple 

of Belos; it is from this book that Berosus took his history of the antediluvian dynasties of Gods 

and Heroes. AElian (in _Nimrod_) speaks of a Hawk (emblem of the Sun), who in the days of the 

beginnings brought to the Egyptians a book containing the wisdom of their religion. The _Sam-

Sam_ of the Sabaeans is also a _Kabalah_, as is the Arabic _Zem-Zem_ (_Well of 

Wisdom_).(327)  We are told by a very learned Kabalist that Seyffarth asserts that the old 

Egyptian tongue was only old Hebrew, or a Semitic dialect; and he proves this, our correspondent 



thinks, by sending him "some 500 words in common" in the two languages. This proves very little 

to our mind. It only shows that the two nations lived together for centuries, and that before 

adopting the Chaldaean for their phonetic tongue the Jews had adopted the old Coptic or 

Egyptian. The Israelitish Scriptures drew their hidden wisdom from the primeval Wisdom-Religion 

that was the source of other Scriptures, only it was sadly degraded by being applied to things and 

mysteries of this Earth, instead of to those in the higher and ever- present, though invisible, 

spheres. Their national history, if they can claim any autonomy before their return from the 

Babylonian captivity, cannot be carried back one day earlier than the time of Moses. The language 

of Abraham--if Zeruan (Saturn, the emblem of time--the "Sar," "Saros," a "cycle") can be said to 

have any language--was not Hebrew, but Chaldaic, perhaps Arabic, and still more likely some old 

Indian dialect. This is shown by numerous proofs, some of which we give here; and unless, 

indeed, to please the tenacious and stubborn believers in _Bible_ chronology, we cripple the years 

of our globe to the Procrustean bed of 7,000 years, it becomes self-evident that the Hebrew 

cannot be called an old language, merely because Adam is supposed to have used it in the 

Garden of Eden. Bunsen says in _Egypt's Place in Universal History_ that in the       Chaldaean 

tribe immediately connected with Abraham, we find     reminiscences of dates disfigured and 

misunderstood as genealogies     of single men, or figures of epochs. The Abrahamic recollections 

go back at least three millennia beyond the grandfather of     Jacob.(328)   The _Bible_ of the 

Jews has ever been an Esoteric Book in its hidden meaning, but this meaning has not remained 

one and the same throughout since the days of Moses. It is useless, considering the limited space 

we can give to this subject, to attempt anything like the detailed history of the vicissitudes of the 

so-called _Pentateuch_, and besides, the history is too well known to need lengthy disquisitions. 

Whatever was, or was not, the Mosaic _Book of Creation_--from _Genesis_ down to the Prophets-

-the _Pentateuch_ of to-day is not the same. It is sufficient to read the criticisms of Erasmus, and 

even of Sir Isaac Newton, to see clearly that the Hebrew Scriptures had been tampered with and 

remodelled, had been lost and rewritten, a dozen times before the days of Ezra. This Ezra himself 

may yet one day turn out to have been Azara, the Chaldaean priest of the Fire and Sun-God, a 

renegade who, through his desire of becoming a ruler, and in order to create an Ethnarchy, 

restored the old lost Jewish Books in his own way. It was an easy thing for one versed in the 

secret system of Esoteric numerals, or Symbology, to put together events from the stray books 

that had been preserved by various tribes, and make of them an apparently harmonious narrative 

of creation and of the evolution of the Judaean race. But in its hidden meaning, from _Genesis_ to 

the last word of _Deuteronomy_, the Pentateuch is the symbolical narrative of the sexes, and is an 

apotheosis of Phallicism, under astronomical and physiological personations.(329) Its 

cooerdination, however, is only apparent; and the human hand appears at every moment, is found 

everywhere in the "Book of God." Hence the Kings of Edom discuss in _Genesis_ before any king 

had reigned in Israel; Moses records his own death, and Aaron dies twice and is buried in two 

different places, to say nothing of other trifles. For the Kabalist they are trifles, for he knows that all 

these events are not history, but are simply the cloak designed to envelope and hide various 

physiological peculiarities; but for the sincere Christian, who accepts all these "dark sayings" in 

good faith, it matters a good deal. Solomon may very well be regarded as a myth(330) by the 

Masons, as they lose nothing by it, for all their secrets are Kabalistic and allegorical--for those few, 



at any rate, who understand them. For the Christian, however, to give up Solomon, the son of 

David--from whom Jesus is made to descend--involves a real loss. But how even the Kabalists 

can claim great antiquity for the Hebrew texts of the old Biblical scrolls now possessed by the 

scholars is not made at all apparent. For it is certainly a fact of history, based on the confessions 

of the Jews themselves, and of Christians likewise, that:       The Scriptures having perished in the 

captivity of Nabuchodonozar,     Esdras, the Levite, the priest, in the times of Artaxerxes, king     of 

the Persians, having become inspired, in the exercise of     prophecy restored again the whole of 

the ancient Scriptures.(331)   One must have a strong belief in "Esdras," and especially in his 

good faith, to accept the now-existing copies as genuine Mosaic Books; for:       Assuming that the 

copies, or rather phonographs which had been     made by Hilkiah and Esdras, and the various 

anonymous editors,     were really true and genuine, they must have been wholly     exterminated 

by Antiochus; and the versions of the Old Testament     which now subsist must have been made 

by Judas, or by some unknown     compilers, probably from the Greek of the Seventy, long after 

the     appearance and death of Jesus.(332)   The _Bible_, therefore, as it is now (the Hebrew 

texts, that is), depends for its accuracy on the genuineness of the _Septuagint_; this, we are again 

told, was written miraculously by the Seventy, in Greek, and the original copy having been lost 

since that time, our texts are re- translated back into Hebrew from that language. But in this 

vicious circle of proofs we once more have to rely upon the good faith of two Jews--Josephus and 

Philo Judaeus of Alexandria--these two Historians being the only witnesses that the Septuagint 

was written under the circumstances narrated. And yet it is just these circumstances that are very 

little calculated to inspire one with confidence. For what does Josephus tell us? He says that 

Ptolemy Philadelphus, desiring to read the Hebrew Law in Greek, wrote to Eleazar, the high-priest 

of the Jews, begging him minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing--

let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to the guards, the Swiss troops and the 

military who surrounded the Palais Royal, that the people were possessed of arms.  The shade of 

Richelieu was Mazarin. Now Mazarin was alone and defenceless, as he well knew.  "Foreigner!" 

he ejaculated, "Italian! that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach--the watchword with which 

they assassinated, hanged, and made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would 

assassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although they have nothing to 

complain of except a tax or two now and then. Idiots! ignorant of their real enemies, they do not 

perceive that it is not the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine things to 

them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.  "Yes, yes," Mazarin continued, whilst 

his wonted smile, full of subtlety, lent a strange expression to his pale lips; "yes, these noises 

prove to me, indeed, that the destiny of favorites is precarious; but ye shall know I am no ordinary 

favorite. No! The Earl of Essex, 'tis true, wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him by his 

royal mistress, whilst I--I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold, with a cipher on it and a date; 

but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the Palais Royal, * so they will never ruin me, as 

they long to do, and whilst they shout, 'Down with Mazarin!' I, unknown, and unperceived by them, 

incite them to cry out, 'Long live the Duke de Beaufort' one day; another, 'Long live the Prince de 

Conde;' and again, 'Long live the parliament!'" And at this word the smile on the cardinal's lips 

assumed an expression of hatred, of which his mild countenance seemed incapable. "The 

parliament! We shall soon see how to dispose," he continued, "of the parliament! Both Orleans 



and Montargis are ours. It will be a work of time, but those who have begun by crying out: Down 

with Mazarin! will finish by shouting out, Down with all the people I have mentioned, each in his 

turn.      _* It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not_     _taken such vows as to 

prevent it, was secretly married to_     _Anne of Austria.--La Porte's Memoirs._  "Richelieu, whom 

they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death, was even less popular 

than I am. Often he was driven away, oftener still had he a dread of being sent away. The queen 

will never banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me; if I 

fly, she will fly; and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen.  "Oh, 

were I not a foreigner! were I but a Frenchman! were I but of gentle birth!"  The position of the 

cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had added to his difficulties. Discontent had long 

pervaded the lower ranks of society in France. Crushed and impoverished by taxation--imposed by 

Mazarin, whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust--the people, as the 

Advocate-General Talon described it, had nothing left to them except their souls; and as those 

could not be sold by auction, they began to murmur. Patience had in vain been recommended to 

them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels, however, were not meat and drink, 

and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent.  Had this been all, it might not, 

perhaps, have greatly signified; for when the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, 

separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, 

seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily, Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the 

magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high 

price; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places, and as the addition of 

twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place, the old functionaries 

formed a union amongst themselves, and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition 

to their number, but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue; and should any one of them 

chance to forfeit his post by this resistance, to combine to indemnify him for his loss.  Now the 

following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties.  On the seventh of 

January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in Paris to discuss a new 

tax which was to be levied on house property. They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the 

Duke of Orleans, who, according to his custom, affected popularity. The duke received them and 

they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax, even if they were obliged to defend 

themselves against its collectors by force of arms. They were listened to with great politeness by 

the duke, who held out hopes of easier measures, promised to speak in their behalf to the queen, 

and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty, "We will see what we can do."  Two 

days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman 

addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded 

and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of Orleans--

that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with that intention a council of state was 

assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned.  This man, named Emery, was the 

object of popular detestation, in the first place because he was superintendent of finance, and 

every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated; in the second place, because he rather 

deserved the odium which he had incurred.  He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, 

who, after becoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal Richelieu 



having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had introduced him with a strong 

recommendation to Louis XIII. under his assumed name, in order that he might be appointed to 

the post he subsequently held.  "You surprise me!" exclaimed the monarch. "I am rejoiced to hear 

you speak of Monsieur d'Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity. I was 

really afraid that you were going to force that villain Particelli upon me."  "Sire," replied Richelieu, 

"rest assured that Particelli, the man to whom your majesty refers, has been hanged."  "Ah; so 

much the better!" exclaimed the king. "It is not for nothing that I am styled Louis the Just," and he 

signed Emery's appointment.  This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent 

of finance.  He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling, 

declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before, near the palace. The 

mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung 

with red velvet edged with gold fringe. This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus, who 

arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became secretary of state, and accumulated 

wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty 

thousand for himself.  The fact was that Emery's son had run a great chance of being suffocated, 

one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed. 

Nothing, therefore, was settled that day, as Emery's head was not steady enough for business 

after such an occurrence.  On the next day Mathieu Mole, the chief president, whose courage at 

this crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de 

Conde--in other words, of the two men who were considered the bravest in France--had been 

attacked in his turn. The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over 

them. But the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness, without betraying either 

disturbance or surprise, that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king's wishes he would 

have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among 

them. To which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected; they 

would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price 

of the people's misery.  Nor was this all. On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre 

Dame, as she always did on Saturdays, was followed by more than two hundred women 

demanding justice. These poor creatures had no bad intentions. They wished only to be allowed to 

fall on their knees before their sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but they 

were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way, haughtily disdainful of 

their entreaties.  At length parliament was convoked; the authority of the king was to be 

maintained.  One day--it was the morning of the day my story begins--the king, Louis XIV., then 

ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small-

pox, to Notre Dame. He took the opportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the 

musketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the quays, and on the Pont 

Neuf. After mass the young monarch drove to the Parliament House, where, upon the throne, he 

hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each one, 

according to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others--a proceeding which drew forth a 

strong remonstrance from the chief president, Mole--whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor 

Broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.  The king returned amidst the 

silence of a vast multitude to the Palais Royal. All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, 



many of the people used threatening language.  At first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the 

king's visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but scarcely 

was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased, when cries of 


_
him six men from each of the twelve tribes_, who should make a translation for him. Then follows 

a truly miraculous story, vouchsafed by Aristeas, of these seventy-two men from the twelve tribes 

of Israel, who, shut up in an island, compiled their translation in exactly seventy-two days, etc.  All 

this is very edifying, and one might have had very little reason to doubt the story, had not the "ten 

lost tribes" been made to play their part in it. How could these tribes, lost between 700 and 900 

B.C., each send six men some centuries later, to satisfy the whim of Ptolemy, and to disappear 

once more immediately afterwards from the horizon? A miracle, verily.  We are expected, 

nevertheless, to regard such documents as the _Septuagint_ as containing direct divine 

revelation: Documents originally written in a tongue about which nobody now knows anything; 

written by authors that are practically mythical, and at dates as to which no one is able even to 

make a defensible surmise; documents of the original copies of which there does not now remain 

a shred. Yet people will persist in talking of the ancient Hebrew, as if there were any man left in 

the world who now knows one word of it. So little, indeed, was Hebrew known that both the 

Septuagint and the _New Testament_ had to be written in a _heathen_ language (the Greek), and 

no better reasons for it given than what Hutchinson says, namely, that the Holy Ghost chose to 

write the New Testament in Greek.  The Hebrew language is considered to be very old, and yet 

there exists no trace of it anywhere on the old monuments, not even in Chaldaea. Among the 

great number of inscriptions of various kinds found in the ruins of that country:       One in the 

Hebrew Chaldee letter and language _has never been     found_; nor has a single authentic medal 

or gem in this new-     fangled character been ever discovered, which could carry it even     to the 

days of Jesus.(333)   The original _Book of Daniel_ is written in a dialect which is a mixture of 

Hebrew and Aramaic; it is not even in Chaldaic, with the exception of a few verses interpolated 

later on. According to Sir W. Jones and other Orientalists, the oldest discoverable languages of 

Persia are the Chaldaic and Blancmesnil!" resounded through the city. For the people had learned 

that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf, and, although the eloquence of 

these deputies had been without avail, it had none the less won for them the people's good-will. All 

attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets, or silence their exclamations, were in vain. 

Orders had just been given to the royal guards and the Swiss guards, not only to stand firm, but to 

send out patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where the people thronged and 

where they were the most vociferous, when the mayor of Paris was announced at the Palais 

Royal.  He was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not 

discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under arms.  Deliberations were being held when a 

lieutenant in the guards, named Comminges, made his appearance, with his clothes all torn, his 

face streaming with blood. The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what 

was going on.  As the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob. The 

tocsin was sounded. Comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be 

hanged near the cross of Du Trahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were 

attacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent had escaped to the Rue des 

Lombards and rushed into a house. They broke open the doors and searched the dwelling, but in 

vain. Comminges, wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead, had left a picket in 

the street and returned to the Palais Royal, followed by a menacing crowd, to tell his story.  This 

account confirmed that of the mayor. The authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious 



revolt. Mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been 

stationed on the quays and on the Pont Neuf, on account of the ceremonial of the day, and that 

they would soon withdraw. In fact, about four o'clock they were all concentrated about the Palais 

Royal, the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards, and 

there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance. 


_
very surprising if there were, since the Hebrew known to the Philologists does not date earlier than 

500 B.C., and its characters belong to a far later period still. Thus, while the real Hebrew 

characters, if not altogether lost are nevertheless so hopelessly transformed--       A mere 

inspection of the alphabet showing that it has been shaped     and made regular, in doing which 

the characteristic marks of some     of the letters _have been retrenched_ in order to make them 

more     square and uniform--(334)   that no one but an initiated Rabbi of Samaria or a "Jain" could 

read them, the new system of the masoretic readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarin--once that of 

Cardinal Richelieu. We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below, 

which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the guns, the firing of which resounded through 

that room. All at once he raised his head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has 

formed a resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten, and 

taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him, he shrilled it twice.  A door 

hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and 


_
all. Punctuation is now to be found everywhere in all the later manuscripts, and by means of it 

anything can be made of a text; a Hebrew scholar can put on the texts any interpretation he likes. 

Two instances given by Kenealy will suffice:       In _Genesis_, xlix. 21, we read:      Naphtali is a 

_hind let loose_; he _giveth  "Bernouin," said the cardinal, not turning round, for having whistled, 

he knew that it was his valet-de-chambre who was behind him; "what musketeers are now within 

the palace?"  "The Black Musketeers, my lord."  "What company?"  "Treville's company."  "Is there 

any officer belonging to this company in the ante-chamber?" 


_
By only a slight alteration of the points Bochart changes this     into:      Naphtali is a _spreading 

tree, shooting forth beautiful branches_.      So again, in _Psalms_ (xxix. 9), instead of:      The 

voice of the Lord _maketh the hind to calve_, and discovereth     the forests;      Bishop Lowth 

gives:      The voice of the Lord _striketh the oak_, and discovereth the     forests.       "A man on 

whom we can depend, I hope."  "Yes, my lord."  "Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers 

and help me to put it on."  The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few 

minutes bringing the dress demanded.  The cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take 

off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament, and
