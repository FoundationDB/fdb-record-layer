horse. Suddenly a shriek and a deafening explosion occurred in the garden. =
"Sixty-pound=20

shrapnel! Evening hate," said an artillery sub. We left! We had been sent u=
p to see the guns fire=20

and not to be fired at.  To go home we had to pass a village completely des=
erted, a village that=20

was once prosperous, where people lived and traded and only wanted to be le=
ft alone. Now grass=20

is growing in the streets. Shops have their merchandise strewn and rotting =
in all directions. On one=20

fragment of a wall a family portrait was still hanging, and a woman's under=
garments. A grand=20

piano, and a perambulator tied in a knot were trying to get down through a =
coal chute. To wander=20

through a village like this one that has been smashed up, and with the know=
ledge that the=20

smashing up may be continued any time, is thrilling. Churches are always ha=
teful to the Germans.=20

They shell them all; bits of the organs are wrapped around the tombstones, =
and coffins, bones and=20

skulls are churned up into a great stew. In some of the villages a few of t=
he inhabitants had stayed=20

and traded with the soldiers. They lived in cellars usually and suffered te=
rribly. British military=20

police direct the traffic when there is any, and are stationed at crossroad=
s with regular beats like a=20

city policeman.  While traveling to another part of the line we had an oppo=
rtunity of seeing the=20

"Archies" (anti-aircraft guns) working. They were mounted on lorries and fi=
re quite good-sized=20

shells. They fired about fifty shots at one Taube, but didn't register a bu=
ll. Later in the evening from=20

a trench we had the satisfaction of seeing another aeroplane set on fire, b=
urn, and drop into the=20

German lines like a shot barrens abound, and which have been formed by wate=
r. Those along=20

Greene river, in Kentucky, have evidently been covered by the waters of tha=
t river. The bed of that=20

stream has been deepened by the constant flowing of the water along its cha=
nnel; the water is=20

drained off, and the prairies and barrens now occupy the soil which the wat=
er had made and=20

formerly covered. The prairies above the falls of Hockhocking, along that r=
iver, have evidently=20

been formed in the same way, and owe their origin and appearances to simila=
r causes. There is=20

near Lancaster, on the last-mentioned river in the State of Ohio, and near =
the great road, a gentle=20

rise of ground in the prairie, which has every appearance of having been an=
 island, and is so=20

called by the people of the vicinity.  In fine, wherever prairies and barre=
ns are found, there, for a=20

long space of time, water once stood, but was gradually drained off. Else w=
hy alluvial soil to such=20

a depth, in low situations, and growing thinner as we ascend on ground more=
 elevated? Else why=20

do we find rocks in more elevated tracts of country, and not in prairies or=
 barrens? Else why do we=20

find no alluvion, no grass, but a thick growth of ancient forest-trees on t=
he higher lands? Else why=20

do we find beneath the alluvion of the prairies, pebbles and shells similar=
 to those at the bottom of=20

lakes and ponds? Else why do the higher grounds to this moment present the =
appearances of so=20

many islands? And all these indications where no stream now in existence co=
uld by possibility=20

have reached them?  That the waters which once covered so great a part of t=
his State (Ohio) were=20

drawn off gradually, we infer from the fact, that there is not a=20


_
as birds. Yesterday a "Pfeil" (arrow) biplane came right over our lines and=
 was chased off by our=20

own machines. The enemy's aeroplanes have their iron cross painted on the u=
nderside of their=20

wings and are more hawkish-looking than ours. They are more often used for =
reconnoitering and=20

taking photographs than for dropping bombs.  We are being moved up closer t=
o the firing line. I=20

have been made billeting officer. I went to headquarters; a staff colonel s=
howed me a subdivision=20

on a map. "Go there and select a place for your unit." The place was a wret=
ched village of about=20

six houses, all of which or volcano, from the foot of the Allegany to the b=
anks of the Mississippi: in=20

this region not a stone nor a layer of earth has been misplaced, nor its po=
sition changed.  But an=20

interesting inquiry here presents itself. Were the hills along the Ohio, be=
fore they were worn away=20

by the streams which now empty themselves into that river, ever high enough=
 to raise the water to=20

the north of them to such a degree that it would overspread the country whe=
re the prairies and=20

barrens are now found? Although the height of these hills has not been asce=
rtained by the proper=20

instruments, yet from appearances,=20


_
less smashed about, windows repaired with sacking and pieces of wood. All o=
f the inhabitants=20

have moved except those who are too poor. Every square inch is utilized. I =
managed to get a cow-

shed for the officers. It looks comfortable. On the door I could just decip=
her, written in chalk, by=20

some previous billeting officer,--       2 Staff Officers     6 Officers   =
  2 Horses   Billeting by any=20

person who examines them and the country towards Lake Erie, these hills are=
 much higher than=20

any land between them and that lake. And from certain indications, (as alre=
ady remarked,) had not=20

the bed of the Niagara been deepened by the running of that mighty river, L=
ake Erie, as formerly,=20

would empty itself into the Ohio by the Scioto and Miami; and the great nor=
thern lakes would=20


_
coast to the front.  The field which we are expecting to put the men into b=
elonged to a miller who=20

lived in a different area. We went to see him. He couldn't speak English or=
 French, so I tried him=20

with German. While we were talking, I noticed some non-coms watching us ver=
y discharge=20

themselves into the Mississippi by the Illinois. Lake Ontario, from some ca=
use, (possibly an=20

earthquake, or the wearing away of its outlet, or both,) is considerably lo=
wer than it was formerly:=20

in that way the land along its banks, once covered by its waters, is draine=
