 It would be her first visit, for she had forfeited her privilege earlier i=
n the term, when she and Lorna lost themselves among the olive groves. Much=
 to their satisfaction dusky olive-green, and of a conchoidal fracture: som=

as nobody replied she continued, "I'm disgusted with the whole set of you. =
I wish to say that I'm=20

not as blind as you seem to think, and I've noticed many points about your =
work that are, to say=20

the least, extremely suspicious. I tell you once and for all _this must sto=
p_! I won't have cheating,=20

practical jokes, or impertinence in this form. Do you all thoroughly unders=
tand me? Very well then,=20

don't let this kind of thing ever happen again. Empty those ink-pots out on=
 to that tray, and,=20

Winnie, fetch the ink-bottle out of the cupboard and refill them. This sens=
eless proceeding has=20

wasted a large part of your examination time, but I shall make no excuse fo=
r it. Your papers will be=20

marked as if you had begun at nine o'clock."  With Miss Bickford on the war=
-path no one dared to=20

say a single word, but at mid-morning interval the injured Camellia Buds sn=
atched their biscuits,=20

and fled to their grotto in the garden to hold an indignation meeting. Here=
 they talked fast and=20

freely.  "It's a jolly shame!"  "_Most_ unfair!"  "Poor old Peachy!"  "Who =
did it?"  "Why, Mabel, of=20

course!"  "Or Bertha?"  "One or other of them!"  "Miss Bickford has noticed=
 their cheating!"  "Yes,=20

and puts it off on to us all!"  "I like that!"  "It's so gloriously fair, i=
sn't it?"  "She may say she's not=20

blind, but she's an absolute cat!"  "What's to be done about it?"  "Those S=
tars won't ever tell!"=20

"Trust them to screen themselves!"  "Oh, it's _too_ bad!"  Letting off stea=
m, though comforting to=20

their feelings, did not bring them any nearer to a solution of their proble=
m. The unpleasant fact=20

remained that the rival sorority had played an abominable trick, and that t=
he blame at present=20

rested upon Peachy. To prove her innocence required the wisdom of Solomon. =
 If they could have=20

explained the whole situation to Miss Bickford she would at once have seen =
for herself that the=20

offender must be among the ranks of the Stars, but such a proceeding would =
mean not only an=20

entire breach of schoolgirl etiquette, but a betrayal of their own secret s=
ociety. It was not to be=20

thought of for a moment.  "Peachy'll have to climb down and apologize," dec=
ided Jess.  "Peachy=20

eat humble-pie? Oh, good-night!"  "Well, she certainly was cheeky."  "Small=
 blame to her!"  "It was=20

very silly of her, though, to flare out."  "She's in the fix of her life no=
w, poor dear."  "Can't we do=20

anything to help her?"  "I don't know. Let's think it over and hold another=
 meeting this afternoon."=20

Peachy's place at the dinner-table was empty that day, and her meal was sen=
t up to the=20

sanatorium upon a tray. Miss Bickford had told her side of the story to Mis=
s Rodgers, who agreed=20

that discipline must be maintained, and ordered the detention of the prison=
er until she showed=20

symptoms of repentance. Meanwhile Peachy, still in an utterly rebellious fr=
ame of mind, stayed=20

upstairs, determined not to give way. It was dull, undoubtedly, to be banis=
hed to solitary=20

confinement, for there was not even a book in the room to amuse her. Her ow=
n thoughts were her=20

sole occupation. She had a very fertile brain, however, and suddenly a most=
 brilliant suggestion=20

occurred to her. The sanatorium was on the top story of the Villa Camellia,=
 and by peeping from its=20

window she could command a view of the iron balcony that fronted the rooms =
below. She=20

calculated that she was probably exactly above dormitory 10, occupied by Jo=
an, Esther, Mary, and=20

Agnes, and that these chums would later on be engaged there at their prepar=
ation. With a little=20

ingenuity it should be possible to communicate with them. She unfortunately=
 had neither pencil nor=20

paper with her, so could not write a note, but she took off her brooch and =
fastened it to the end of=20

a long piece of string, which by extra good luck happened to be in her pock=
et. When she judged=20

that the right moment had arrived she lowered her signal so that it would t=
ap on the balcony. There=20

was, of course, a certain amount of risk about the venture, for she might h=
ave miscalculated, and=20

be dropping her token into the midst of enemies instead of friends. Greatly=
 to her relief, however,=20



Agnes appeared through the French window, and, after examining the brooch w=
ith apparent=20

surprise, glanced upwards and saw Peachy's face. She gave a comprehensive s=
mile, put her=20

fingers on her lips for silence, bolted into her dormitory, and returned wi=
th a package of chocolate=20

which she tied firmly to the end of the string, then waved her hand and dar=
ted back to her=20

preparation.  Peachy drew up her present, chuckling with delight. She felt =
almost like a captive of=20

the Middle Ages, and was beginning to plan a romantic escape down an improv=
ised rope ladder,=20

when it occurred to her that she would scarcely know what to do with her li=
berty if she regained it.=20

"Botheration!" she mused. "Unless I square things up I can't walk in to tea=
, and I can't haunt the=20

garden like a wandering ghost, and I've no money to pay my passage on the s=
teamer, so I can't go=20

home to Naples. Nothing for it but to stay here, I suppose, and see who get=
s tired out first."  When=20

the Camellia Buds were able to meet together again at a secret conclave in =
the garden, Agnes=20

announced the important fact of having established communication with the p=
risoner. After an=20

animated discussion they decided to write her a round-robin letter and set =
forth their idea of the=20

situation. Each composed a sentence in turn, and Lorna acted as scribe. It =
ran thus:            _The=20

Grotto._            _To our noble friend and Camellia Bud_--           _Gre=
eting!_             _The Sorority=20

desires to express a vote           of sympathy for the very unpleasant    =
       occurrence that=20

happened this morning._            A. DALTON.             _Those Stars are =
the meanest things on=20

earth and want spifflicating._            J. LUCAS.             _We admire =
you for the magnificent stand=20

you are making, but we don't see how you           are going to keep it up.=
_            M.=20

FERGUSSON.             _It's frightfully slow without you._            I. B=
EVERLEY.             _We think=20

you'll have to cave in and           apologize._            S. YONGE.      =
       _But, of course, not own=20

up to something           you never did._            J. CAMERON.           =
  _We'll get even with those=20

Stars to make           up for this._            L. CARSON.             _Do=
n't stick in the Sanatorium all=20

night._            E. CARTMELL.             _It's no use getting too mad, o=
ld sport!           Come right=20

down and talk sense._            D. WATTS.  This united effusion was placed=
 in an envelope, and=20

carried by Agnes to her dormitory, where, after scouts in the garden had as=
sured her that the=20

coast was clear, she ventured on to the veranda, and gave a cooee which bro=
ught Peachy to the=20

window above. The latter let down her string and drew up the letter, which =
she pondered upon in=20

private. She was wise enough to accept the good advice, and when Miss Bickf=
ord appeared later=20

on she tendered her apologies. The teacher had possibly repented of her has=
ty accusation, for=20

she did not refer to the matter of the inkwells, but merely required satisf=
action for=20

"insubordination." That being given Peachy was once more free, though she c=
ould hardly consider=20

herself restored to full favor.  "I used to like Miss Bickford," she grumpe=
d, "but I really don't think=20

she's been fair over this. Why couldn't she ask each girl separately what s=
he knew about it?"=20

"Much good that would have done. Bertha and Mabel wouldn't have told the tr=
uth, and things=20

would only have been in a worse muddle. We'll catch those two sometime if w=
e can only think of=20

how to do it."  "Ah! That's just the question."  Even the Stars had been ra=
ther alarmed by Miss=20

Bickford's firm attitude, and for the present they did not dare to cheat op=
enly or to play any more=20

tricks upon the form. Stopped in this direction their ringleaders turned th=
eir attention to other=20

matters. What was the nature of these it was Irene's lot one day to discove=
r. She happened to be=20

walking in a rather quiet part of the garden, a portion reserved mostly for=
 vegetables, which=20

adjoined the great wall that separated the estate from the highroad. As she=
 sauntered along, doing=20



nothing in particular, she noticed Mabel, who was standing under an orange =
tree close to the wall.=20

At the same moment, advancing towards them came the sound of Rachel's voice=
 caroling an old=20

English song. Now there is nothing in the least wrong or unorthodox in thos=
e countries. The=20

province of Caracas,* (* The province, not the capitania-general, consequen=
tly not including the=20

cacao plantations of Cumana, the province of Barcelona, of Maracaybo, of Va=
rinas, and of=20

Spanish Guiana.) at the end of the eighteenth century, produced annually a =
hundred and fifty=20

thousand fanegas, of which a hundred thousand were consumed in Spain, and t=
hirty thousand in=20

the province. Estimating a fanega of cacao at only twenty-five piastres for=
 the price given at Cadiz,=20

we find that the total value of the exportation of cacao, by the six ports =
of the Capitania General of=20

Caracas, amounts to four million eight hundred thousand piastres. So import=
ant an object of=20

commerce merits a careful discussion; and I flatter myself, that, from the =
great number of materials=20

I have collected on all the branches of colonial agriculture, I shall be ab=
le to add something to the=20

information published by M. Depons, in his valuable work on the provinces o=
f Venezuela.  The tree=20

which produces the cacao is not at present found wild in the forests of Ter=
ra Firma to the north of=20

the Orinoco; we began to find it only beyond the cataracts of Ature and May=
pure. It abounds=20

particularly near the banks of the Ventuari, and on the Upper Orinoco, betw=
een the Padamo and=20

the Gehette. This scarcity of wild cacao-trees in South America, north of t=
he latitude of 6 degrees,=20

is a very curious phenomenon of botanical geography, and yet little known. =
This phenomenon=20

appears the more surprising, as, according to the annual produce of the har=
vest, the number of=20

trees in full bearing in the cacao-plantations of Caracas, Nueva Barcelona,=
 Venezuela, Varinas,=20

and Maracaybo, is estimated at more than sixteen millions. The wild cacao-t=
ree has many=20

branches, and is covered with a tufted and dark foliage. It bears a very sm=
all fruit, like that variety=20

which the ancient Mexicans called tlalcacahuatl. Transplanted into the conu=
cos of the Indians of=20

Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro, the wild tree preserves for several generati=
ons that force of=20

vegetable life, which makes it bear fruit in the fourth year; while, in the=
 province of Caracas, the=20

harvest begins only the sixth, seventh, or eighth year. It is later in the =
inland parts than on the=20

coasts and in the valley of Guapo. We met with no tribe on the Orinoco that=
 prepared a beverage=20

with the seeds of the cacao-tree. The savages suck the pulp of the pod, and=
 throw away the=20

seeds, which are often found in heaps where they have passed the night. Tho=
ugh chorote, which=20

is a very weak infusion of cacao, is considered on the coast to be a very a=
ncient beverage, no=20

historical fact proves that chocolate, or any preparation whatever of cacao=
, was known to the=20

natives of Venezuela before the arrival of the Spaniards. It appears to me =
more probable that the=20

cacao-plantations of Caracas were suggested by those of Mexico and Guatimal=
a; and that the=20

Spaniards inhabiting Terra Firma learned the cultivation of the cacao-tree,=
 sheltered in its youth by=20

the foliage of the erythrina and plantain;* (This process of the Mexican cu=
ltivators, practised on the=20

coast of Caracas, is described in the memoirs known under the title of "Rel=
azione di certo=20

Gentiluomo del Signor Cortez, Conquistadore del Messico." (Ramusio, tome 2 =
page 134).) the=20

fabrication of cakes of chocolatl, and the use of the liquid of the same na=
me, in course of their=20

communications with Mexico, Guatimala, and Nicaragua.  Down to the sixteent=
h century travellers=20

differed in opinion respecting the chocolatl. Benzoni plainly says that it =
is a drink "fitter for hogs=20

than men."* (* Benzoni, Istoria del Mondo Nuovo, 1572 page 104.) The Jesuit=
 Acosta asserts, that=20

"the Spaniards who inhabit America are fond of chocolate to excess; but tha=
t it requires to be=20



accustomed to that black beverage not to be disgusted at the mere sight of =
its froth, which swims=20

on it like yeast on a fermented liquor." He adds, "the cacao is a prejudice=
 (una supersticion) of the=20

Mexicans, as the coca is a prejudice of the Peruvians." These opinions remi=
nd us of Madame de=20

Sevigne's prediction respecting the use of coffee. Fernando Cortez and his =
page, the gentilhombre=20

del gran Conquistador, whose memoirs were published by Ramusio, on the cont=
rary, highly praise=20

chocolate, not only as an agreeable drink, though prepared cold,* but in pa=
rticular as a nutritious=20

substance. (* Father Gili has very clearly shown, from two passages in Torq=
uemada (Monarquia=20

Indiana, lib. 14) that the Mexicans prepared the infusion cold, and that th=
e Spaniards introduced=20

the custom of preparing chocolate by boiling water with the paste of cacao.=
) "He who has drunk=20

one cup," says the page of Fernando Cortez, "can travel a whole day without=
 any other food,=20

especially in very hot climates; for chocolate is by its nature cold and re=
freshing." We shall not=20

subscribe to the latter part of this assertion; but we shall soon have occa=
sion, in our voyage on the=20

Orinoco, and our excursions towards the summit of the Cordilleras, to celeb=
rate the salutary=20

properties of chocolate. It is easily conveyed and readily employed: as an =
aliment it contains a=20

large quantity of nutritive and stimulating particles in a small compass. I=
t has been said with truth,=20

that in the East, rice, gum, and ghee (clarified butter), assist man in cro=
ssing the deserts; and so,=20

in the New World, chocolate and the flour of maize, have rendered accessibl=
e to the traveller the=20

table-lands of the Andes, and vast uninhabited forests.  The cacao harvest =
is extremely variable.=20

The tree vegetates with such vigour that flowers spring out even from the r=
oots, wherever the=20

earth leaves them uncovered. It suffers from the north-east winds, even whe=
n they lower the=20

temperature only a few degrees. The heavy showers that fall irregularly aft=
er the rainy season,=20

during the winter months, from December to March, are also very hurtful to =
the cacao-tree. The=20

proprietor of a plantation of fifty thousand trees often loses the value of=
 more than four or five=20

thousand piastres in cacao in one hour. Great humidity is favourable to the=
 tree only when it=20

augments progressively, and is for a long time uninterrupted. If, in the se=
ason of drought, the=20

leaves and the young fruit be wetted by a violent shower, the fruit falls f=
rom the stem; for it=20

appears that the vessels which absorb water break from being rendered turgi=
d. Besides, the=20

cacao-harvest is one of the most uncertain, on account of the fatal effects=
 of inclement seasons,=20

and the great number of worms, insects, birds, and quadrupeds,* (* Parrots,=
 monkeys, agoutis,=20

squirrels, and stags.) which devour the pod of the cacao-tree; and this bra=
nch of agriculture has=20

the disadvantage of obliging the new planter to wait eight or ten years for=
 the fruit of his labours,=20

and of yielding after all an article of very difficult preservation.  The f=
inest plantations of cacao are=20

found in the province of Caracas, along the coast, between Caravalleda and =
the mouth of the Rio=20

Tocuyo, in the valleys of Caucagua, Capaya, Curiepe, and Guapo; and in thos=
e of Cupira,=20

between cape Conare and cape Unare, near Aroa, Barquesimeto, Guigue, and Ur=
itucu. The cacao=20

that grows on the banks of the Uritucu, at the entrance of the llanos, in t=
he jurisdiction of San=20

Sebastian de las Reyes, is considered to be of the finest quality. Next to =
the cacao of Uritucu=20

comes that of Guigue, of Caucagua, of Capaya, and of Cupira. The merchants =
of Cadiz assign the=20

first rank to the cacao of Caracas, immediately after that of Socomusco; an=
d its price is generally=20

from thirty to forty per cent higher than that of Guayaquil.  It is only si=
nce the middle of the=20

seventeenth century, when the Dutch, tranquil possessors of the island of C=
uracoa, awakened, by=20

their smuggling, the agricultural industry of the inhabitants of the neighb=
ouring coasts, that cacao=20



has become an object of exportation in the province of Caracas. We are igno=
rant of everything=20

that passed in those countries before the establishment of the Biscay Compa=
ny of Guipuzcoa, in=20

1728. No precise statistical data have reached us: we only know that the ex=
portation of cacao from=20

Caracas scarcely amounted, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, to t=
hirty thousand fanegas=20

a-year. From 1730 to 1748, the company sent to Spain eight hundred and fift=
y-eight thousand nine=20

hundred and seventy-eight fanegas, which make, on an average, forty-seven t=
housand seven=20

hundred fanegas a-year; the price of the fanega fell, in 1732, to=20


_
instant Irene glimpsed Mabel's face she was certain her schoolmate was in t=
hat particular spot for=20

some reason the reverse of good. She looked uneasily at Irene, glanced in R=
achel's direction,=20

seemed to hesitate, and finally took to her heels and bolted away through t=
he bushes. Next=20

minute, over the top of the high wall descended a little parcel. It caught =
in the branches of the=20

orange tree, fell to the ground, and rolled under a clump of cabbages. Iren=
e took no notice, and=20

sauntered on in the direction of Rachel, but when the prefect had passed ou=
t of sight she returned,=20

groped among the vegetables, found the parcel, and slipped it into her pack=
et.  "Miss Mabel=20

Hughes, I believe I've caught you tripping this time," she chuckled. "I mus=
t send out the fiery cross=20

and call an immediate meeting of the Camellia Buds."  Among the secret prac=
tices of the sorority=20

was a private signal only to be used in times of urgent necessity. It had b=
een suggested by Jess=20

Cameron, who took the idea from _The Lady of the Lake_, in which poem a gat=
hering of the clan=20

is proclaimed by a runner bearing a cross of wood charred in the fire. Two =
burnt matches fastened=20

together with thread served the Camellia Buds for their token, and it was t=
he strictest rite of their=20

order that any one receiving this cryptic symbol must immediately leave wha=
tever she happened=20

to be doing and proceed post-haste to the rendezvous.  So promptly did the =
members of the=20

society respond to the summons that within ten minutes of the issue of the =
fiery cross they were=20

assembled in the summer-house in a state of much expectancy. Irene explaine=
d how a parcel had=20

been thrown over the wall, evidently for Mabel, who undoubtedly had been st=
anding waiting for it.=20

It was not addressed to Mabel, however, and as it bore no direction at all =
on the outside the=20

Camellia Buds considered themselves justified in opening it. It contained a=
 package of cheap=20

chocolate, and a letter written in a foreign hand in rather bad English.   =
        _Beautiful Signorina_,=20

_Make me the compliment to accept of me this few          chocolate. I like=
 the letter you gave to me=20

on          Sunday. I will again present myself near to the          hotel =
to wait upon you as you pass.=20

Accept I pray          you the assurance of my profoundest respects._=20

EMANUELE SUTONI.  "Who is Emanuele Sutoni?" gasped Delia. "And what's he go=
t to do with=20

us?"  "Nothing to do with us," frowned Jess. "But I'm afraid Mabel has been=
 trying to get up some=20

silly love affair. If Miss Morley or Miss Rodgers found this out she'd be e=
xpelled."  "What are we=20

going to do about it? Tell Rachel?"  "I don't think so," pondered Jess. "Yo=
u see, of course, we're=20

perfectly certain among ourselves that the letter was meant for Mabel, but =
it isn't addressed to her=20

so there's no real evidence. Not enough to convince Rachel. It would be bet=
ter really to tell her=20

we've found out and that she's got to stop it."  "I know! Let's tar and fea=
ther her!" squealed Peachy=20

excitedly. "That's the best way to frighten her. Of course, I don't mean _r=
eal_ tar, but soap does=20

just as well. She thoroughly deserves it. I vote we do it to-night. We'll h=
old an inquisition in her=20

dormitory. It will be easy enough to square Elsie."  Peachy's grim idea app=
ealed to the Camellia=20

Buds. They considered it was time that a public demonstration was made agai=
nst Mabel, whose=20

general behavior was very unworthy of the traditions of the Villa Camellia.=
 They decided to have=20

their tribunal immediately after the lights were turned out, while the pref=
ects, who sat up later than=20

the Transition, were still downstairs, and the mistresses were having cocoa=
 in Miss Rodgers'=20

study. The affair was to be a surprise for Mabel, but as Elsie also slept i=
n the same dormitory it=20

was necessary to secure her cooeperation, in case she might give the alarm =
and summon a=20

prefect. Elsie, however, proved an easily won ally.  "I can't bear Mabel," =
she assured Irene. "You=20

may do anything you like to her as far as I'm concerned. I shall pretend to=
 be asleep. Monica and=20



Rosamonde and Winnie can't stand her either. I don't mind telling you that =
we're going to resign=20

from the Starry Circle and found a new sorority of our own. It isn't good e=
nough to be mixed up=20

with such girls as Mabel and Bertha."  "I'm glad you've found them out," sa=
id Irene. "It was high=20

time somebody made a protest."  The four occupants of dormitory 3 went to b=
ed as usual that=20

night, but as soon as the lights were out Lorna and Irene put on their dres=
sing-gowns and=20

stockings, and slipped into the bathroom. Here they hastily completed the d=
etails of their costumes=20

in company with the rest of the Camellia Buds, who had rallied for the occa=
sion. Three minutes=20

afterwards a strange procession entered dormitory 3. Ten dressing-gowned fi=
gures, each wearing=20

a black mask and holding a piece of lighted candle in her hand, startled th=
e astonished eyes of=20

Mabel Hughes, who sat up in bed to stare at them.  "What's all this about?"=
 she asked.  "We've=20

come here to hold an inquisition on your conduct," replied a solemn voice f=
rom behind one of the=20

black masks. "Will you kindly get out of bed and seat yourself upon this ch=
air. We should be sorry=20

to use force, but I warn you you'll have to obey us."  Looking a little sca=
red Mabel apparently=20

thought discretion the better part of valor. She rose, put on her dressing-=
gown, and took the seat=20

indicated. Her inquisitors grouped themselves opposite, placing their candl=
es in a row upon the=20

mantelpiece. Their spokeswoman, unfolding a large sheet of paper, proceeded=
 to read the=20

indictment.            _This is to tell all whom it may concern           t=
hat Mabel Hughes, having broken=20

every           rule of decent and orderly behavior, and           being no=
 longer worthy of the name of=20

gentlewoman, is here arraigned on the           following charges:_        =
     _1. That she habitually=20

takes advantage           of and ill-treats the juniors when           oppo=
rtunity occurs._            _2. That=20

she cheats abominably at her           work._            _3. That she endea=
vors to persuade=20

others to cheat._            _4. That she degrades the name of the         =
  Villa Camellia by receiving=20

letters           which are thrown to her over the wall,           and by h=
anding answers to them on her=20

way to church._  Mabel, who had smiled scornfully at the first three charge=
s, changed color at the=20

fourth.  "What do you know about letters?" she challenged sharply.  "We kno=
w all," ventured the=20

solemn voice. "You had better confess at piastres, when it had before kept =
at eighty piastres. In=20

1763 the cultivation had so much augmented, that the exportation rose to ei=
ghty thousand six=20

hundred and fifty-nine fanegas.  In an official document, taken from the pa=
pers of the minister of=20

finance, the annual produce (la cosecha) of the province of Caracas is esti=
mated at a hundred and=20

thirty-five thousand fanegas of cacao; thirty-three thousand of which are f=
or home consumption,=20

ten thousand for other Spanish colonies, seventy-seven thousand for the mot=
her-country, fifteen=20

thousand for the illicit commerce with the French, English, Dutch, and Dani=
sh colonies. From 1789=20

to 1793, the importation of cacao from Caracas into Spain was, on an averag=
e, seventy-seven=20

thousand seven hundred and nineteen fanegas a-year, of which sixty-five tho=
usand seven=20

hundred and sixty-six were consumed in the country, and eleven thousand nin=
e hundred and fifty-

three exported to France, Italy, and Germany.  The late wars have had much =
more fatal effects on=20

the cacao trade of Caracas than on that of Guayaquil. On account of the inc=
rease of price, less=20

cacao of the first quality has been consumed in Europe. Instead of mixing, =
as was done formerly=20

for common chocolate, one quarter of the cacao of Caracas, with three-quart=
ers of that of=20

Guayaquil, the latter has been employed pure in Spain. We must here remark,=
 that a great deal of=20

cacao of an inferior quality, such as that of Maranon, the Rio Negro, Hondu=
ras, and the island of=20

St. Lucia, bears the name, in commerce, of Guayaquil cacao. The exportation=
 from that port=20



amounts only to sixty thousand fanegas; consequently it is two-thirds less =
than that of the ports of=20

the Capitania-General of Caracas.  Though the plantations of cacao have aug=
mented in the=20

provinces of Cumana, Barcelona, and Maracaybo, in proportion as they have d=
iminished in the=20

province of Caracas, it is still believed that, in general, this ancient br=
anch of agricultural industry=20

gradually declines. In many parts coffee and cotton-trees progressively tak=
e place of the cacao, of=20

which the lingering harvests weary the patience of the cultivator. It is al=
so asserted, that the new=20

plantations of cacao are less productive than the old; the trees do not acq=
uire the same vigour,=20

and yield later and less abundant fruit. The soil is still said to be exhau=
sted; but probably it is=20

rather the atmosphere that is changed by the progress of clearing and culti=
vation. The air that=20

reposes on a virgin soil covered with forests is loaded with humidity and t=
hose gaseous mixtures=20

that serve for the nutriment of plants, and arise from the decomposition of=
 organic substances.=20

When a country has been long subjected to cultivation, it is not the propor=
tions between the azote=20

and oxygen that vary. The constituent bases of the atmosphere remain unalte=
red; but it no longer=20

contains, in a state of suspension, those binary and ternary mixtures of ca=
rbon, hydrogen, and=20

nitrogen, which a virgin soil exhales, and which are regarded as a source o=
f fecundity. The air,=20

purer and less charged with miasmata and heterogeneous emanations, becomes =
at the same time=20

drier. The elasticity of the vapours undergoes a sensible diminution. On la=
nd long cleared, and=20

consequently little favourable to the cultivation of the cacao-tree (as, fo=
r instance, in the West India=20

Islands), the fruit is almost as small as that of the wild cacao-tree. It i=
s on the banks of the Upper=20

Orinoco, after having crossed the Llanos, that we find the true country of =
the cacao-tree; thick=20

forests, in which, on a virgin soil, and surrounded by an atmosphere contin=
ually humid, the trees=20

furnish, from the fourth year, abundant crops. Wherever the soil is not exh=
austed, the fruit has=20

become by cultivation larger and bitter, but also later.  On seeing the pro=
duce of cacao gradually=20

diminish in Terra Firma, it may be inquired, whether the consumption will d=
iminish in the same=20

proportion in Spain, Italy, and the rest of Europe; or whether it be not pr=
obable, that by the=20

destruction of the cacao plantations, the price will augment sufficiently t=
o rouse anew the industry=20

of the cultivator. This latter opinion is generally admitted by those who d=
eplore, at Caracas, the=20

diminution of so ancient and profitable a branch of commerce. In proportion=
 as civilization extends=20

towards the humid forests of the interior, the banks of the Orinoco and the=
 Amazon, or towards the=20

valleys that furrow the eastern declivity of the Andes, the new planters wi=
ll find lands and an=20

atmosphere equally favourable to the culture of the cacao-tree.  The Spania=
rds, in general, dislike=20

a mixture of vanilla with the cacao, as irritating the nervous system; the =
fruit, therefore, of that=20

orchideous plant is entirely neglected in the province of Caracas, though a=
bundant crops of it=20

might be gathered on the moist and feverish coast between Porto Cabello and=
 Ocumare;=20

especially at Turiamo, where the fruits of the Epidendrum vanilla attain th=
e length of eleven or=20

twelve inches. The English and the Anglo-Americans often seek to make purch=
ases of vanilla at=20

the port of La Guayra, but the merchants procure with difficulty a very sma=
ll quantity. In the valleys=20

that descend from the chain of the coast towards the Caribbean Sea, in the =
province of Truxillo, as=20

well as in the Missions of Guiana, near the cataracts of the Orinoco, a gre=
at quantity of vanilla=20

might be collected; the produce of which would be still more abundant, if, =
according to the practice=20

of the Mexicans, the plant were disengaged, from time to time, from the cre=
eping plants by which it=20

is entwined and stifled.  The hot and fertile valleys of the Cordillera of =
the coast of Venezuela=20



occupy a tract of land which, on the west, towards the lake of Maracaybo, d=
isplays a remarkable=20

variety of scenery. I shall exhibit in one view, to close this chapter, the=
 facts I have been able to=20

collect respecting the quality of the soil and the metallic riches of the d=
istricts of Aroa, of=20

Barquesimeto, and of Carora.  From the Sierra Nevada of Merida, and the par=
amos of Niquitao,=20

Bocono, and Las Rosas,* (Many travellers, who were monks, have asserted tha=
t the little Paramo=20

de Las Rosas, the height of which appears to be more than 1,600 toises, is =
covered with=20

rosemary, and the red and white roses of Europe grow wild there. These rose=
s are gathered to=20

decorate the altars in the neighbouring villages on the festivals of the ch=
urch. By what accident=20

has our Rosa centifolia become wild in this country, while we nowhere found=
 it in the Andes of=20

Quito and Peru? Can it really be the rose-tree of our garden?) which contai=
n the valuable=20


_
once, or the affair with Emanuele will be exposed to the prefects."  "It's =
my own business," said=20

Mabel sulkily.  "No, it isn't. It's ours as well, and the whole school's. W=
e don't want the Villa=20

Camellia to be disgraced in the eyes of the town. You ought to be ashamed o=
f yourself. It's so=20

_vulgar_. Now, will you promise to give up all your bad habits and behave l=
ike a lady."  "I'll=20

promise nothing," snapped Mabel.  "Then we shall be obliged to tar and feat=
her you."  Mabel=20

laughed, imagining it was an empty threat, but she was rapidly undeceived. =
Two inquisitors,=20

seizing her by the arms, held her tightly in her chair, while several other=
s smeared soap over her=20

face and stuck on feathers which they took out of a cushion. She would have=
 screamed, but every=20

time she opened her mouth to do so she received a dab of soap upon her tong=
ue. When they=20

considered her countenance was sufficiently ornamented, they presented her =
with a looking-glass=20

to view the effect.  "That's how we feel about it," the spokeswoman assured=
 her. "This is just to=20

show you we won't stand your horrid ways. Will you promise now to behave yo=
urself, or do you=20

want any more?"  Apparently Mabel had had enough. She seemed rather frighte=
ned. She=20

grumbled that she would agree to what they wished.  "Just jolly well take c=
are that you keep your=20

promise then," warned her inquisitor. "If you begin any of your old tricks =
again we have evidence=20

against you, and we shall take it straight to Rachel. If I know anything of=
 Rachel she'll go to Miss=20

Rodgers, and that means you're expelled. So now you know! You'd better be c=
areful, Mabel=20

Hughes. That's all we came to say. You may wash your face if you like befor=
e you get into bed=20

again."  The ten members of the inquisition, knowing that time was passing,=
 and that the prefects=20

would soon be coming upstairs, judged it wise to break up the meeting, and =
taking their candles=20

beat a stately retreat to their respective dormitories. Lorna and Irene, re=
turning to their cubicles,=20

heard Elsie chuckling. She had not interfered in any way with the performan=
ce, but it had evidently=20

entertained her. She told the tale next day to her friends, with the result=
 that Ruth, Rosamonde,=20

Winnie, Monica, and Callie joined her in seceding from the Starry Circle, l=
eaving Mabel and Bertha=20

as sole remaining representatives of that sorority.  "We're fed up with you=
," Winnie assured the=20

pair when they remonstrated. "We're tired of your sneaking ways, and you ma=
y just keep them to=20

yourselves. We're not going to let you copy our exercises any more. And if =
we see you taking=20

those kids' biscuits again there'll be squalls. No, we shan't tell you the =
name of our new sorority.=20

We're not going to have anything to do with you ever again. So there!"  Pub=
lic opinion had for once=20

triumphed on the right side, and Mabel and Bertha, greatly discomfited, fou=
nd their influence over=20

the late Stars was at an end. The threat of telling Rachel had frightened M=
abel; she was uncertain=20

how much the Camellia Buds really knew, and judged it discreet to drop her =
clandestine=20

correspondence. She had no wish for the matter to meet the ears of Miss Rod=
gers, who, she was=20

well aware, would take the most serious view of it. Though she cherished a =
grudge against her=20

late inquisitors, she submitted to their demands, and for the time at any r=
ate gave no outward=20

cause for complaint.     CHAPTER XIII  Peachy's Pranks   "I'm sorry to have=
 to announce it," said=20

Peachy, "but my spirits are fizzing over, and I guess if I don't go just th=
e teeniest weeniest bit on=20

the rampage I'll fly all to pieces and make a scene. Sometimes I'm tingling=
 down to my toes and=20

I've just _got_ to explode. Being good is a lonesome job."  Peachy was sitt=
ing with Irene and Delia=20

on one of the marble seats at the bottom of the lemon pergola. It was a fav=
orite spot with the girls,=20

for it was sheltered from the prevailing wind and the flowers grew particul=
arly luxuriantly. Lovely=20

irises were blooming, white narcissus, wallflowers, and beds of Parma viole=
ts, and the beautiful=20



delicate blossom of the arbutula drooped from an archway that spanned the p=
ath. Irene, who was=20

used by this time to Peachy's whimsical moods, laid aside the book she was =
reading and laughed.=20

"Poor old sport! You've evidently got it badly to-day. What can we do for y=
ou? How, where, and=20

when do you want to rampage?"  Peachy shook her head dolefully.  "I don't k=
now. Only wish I did.=20

I'm tired of doing the same things over and over again every day. Getting u=
p in the morning and=20

dressing myself, having breakfast, going to classes, having dinner, grindin=
g at prep, playing tennis,=20

having tea and supper, and undressing and going to bed. I want to sleep in =
my clothes or go to=20

class in my wrapper just for a change, and I'd like tennis in the morning a=
nd tea instead of dinner.=20

I'm tired of the house and the garden. I want to dodge Antonio and go throu=
gh the big gate and run=20

down the road. I tell you I want to do absolutely anything that's weird and=
 impossible and out of the=20

ordinary. Yes, I know I'm wrought up. I'm just crazy for a real frolic. Who=
'll play 'Follow my=20

Leader'?"  "If you won't do anything _too_ outrageous," ventured Delia, rep=
lacing a dainty piece of=20

sewing inside her workbag, and preparing to fall in with her friend's mood.=
 "I've had one little=20

difference with Miss Bickford this week, and if I have another Miss Rodgers=
 may cut up rough and=20

stop my next exeat."  "Honest Injun, I'll take all the blame if blame there=
 is. Renie, dearie, you're=20

coming too?"  "Got to, I suppose," chuckled Irene. "When the Queen of the S=
outh arises and gives=20

her orders her slaves must 'tremble and obey.'"  "Not much trembling about =
you. Come on and be=20

sports, both of you. Are you ready? Do as your Granny tells you then, and o=
ff we go."  The game=20

of "Follow my Leader," as every schoolgirl knows, consists in exactly imita=
ting everything which is=20

done by your chief, no matter what extraordinary and peculiar antics she ma=
y perform. To submit=20

to Peachy's guidance in the present exalted state of her spirits was a deci=
ded leap in the dark, but=20

Irene and Delia were ready for fun, and prepared to take a few risks. At fi=
rst their light-hearted=20

companion contented herself with running in and out among the lemon trees, =
walking along the=20

low wall of the terrace, jumping the culvert, or easy physical feats, then,=
 having slightly worked off=20

steam, she stood for a moment and paused to reflect.  "Christopher Columbus=
! I guess I know=20

what I'll do. I've an exploring fit on me, and if I can't find America I'll=
 find something else new and=20

undiscovered. Here goes."  Peachy, with her satellites in her train, plunge=
d her way across the=20

garden in the direction of the kitchen. She had suddenly remembered an obje=
ct which had more=20

than once set her curiosity a-galloping. In the yard outside the scullery t=
here was an iron staircase=20

intended for use as a fire-escape from the servants' bedrooms, and also as =
a means of mounting=20

the roof when workmen wished to attend to the chimney-pots. Up here she was=
 determined to go.=20

Fortunately the maids were safely inside the kitchen, and the defenses were=
 left unguarded.  "This=20

is my Jacob's ladder," she proclaimed. "Who'll follow me to the sky?"      =
      "'Will you walk into my=20

parlor?' said the spider to the fly,           ''Tis the prettiest little p=
arlor that ever you did spy!=20

The way into my parlor is up a winding stair,           And I have many cur=
ious things to show you=20

when you're there.'"  "Go on, you lunatic," giggled Irene.  "And be quick a=
bout it if you don't want=20

Dominica clattering at your heels," added Delia.  So they clambered up the =
steep iron stairway,=20

and, passing by the door that led to the servants' apartments, they climbed=
 on till they reached the=20

roof. This part of the Villa Camellia was _terra incognita_ to the school. =
They decided hastily,=20

however, that it would be a very desirable acquisition. It was a large flat=
 expanse covered with=20

lead, and edged with a low battlement. It was evidently used by the maids, =
for a clothes-line was=20

stretched between two chimneys, and a row of towels hung out to dry. The vi=
ew was adorable. It=20



was like being on the top of a mountain. They could see the town of Fossato=
, and a wide expanse=20

of water, and Vesuvius, and the distant outline of Naples all spread in a p=
anorama before them,=20

besides having an excellent bird's-eye prospect of the garden below. Peachy=
, who was ready to=20

do anything wild, went dancing about like a will-o'-the-wisp.            "L=
ight and airy--light and airy,=20

Sure, I feel a sort of fairy,"  she extemporized. "Renie Beverley, you're n=
ot mad enough! Give me=20

your hand. I tell you you've got to dance. We're witches who've flown over =
on our broomsticks and=20

alighted here, and we'll have a frolic before we go back to--wherever we ca=
me from. Hello, what's=20

this business? It looks like a water-tank. Give me a boost, somebody, for I=
'm going up to see."  It=20

was rather a scramble even for Peachy's agile limbs, but she was resolved t=
horoughly to explore=20

the capacities of the roof, and the cistern must not be left unvisited. She=
 clung on to its slippery=20

side and peered from the port of Maracaybo does not come from the territory=
 of Venezuela, but=20

from the mountains of Pamplona in New Grenada, being brought down the Rio d=
e San Faustino,=20

that flows into the lake of Maracaybo. (Pombo, Noticias sobre las Quinas, 1=
814 page 65.) Some is=20

collected near Merida, in the ravine of Viscucucuy.) decreases in height so=
 rapidly, that, between=20

the ninth and tenth degrees of latitude, it forms only a chain of little mo=
untains, which, stretching to=20

the north-east by the Altar and Torito, separates the rivers that join the =
Apure and the Orinoco=20

from those numerous rivers that flow either into the Caribbean Sea or the l=
ake of Maracaybo. On=20

this dividing ridge are built the towns of Nirgua, San Felipe el Fuerte, Ba=
rquesimeto, and Tocuyo.=20

The first three are in a very hot climate; but Tocuyo enjoys great coolness=
, and we heard with=20

surprise, that, beneath so fine a sky, the inhabitants have a strong propen=
sity to suicide. The=20

ground rises towards the south; for Truxillo, the lake of Urao, from which =
carbonate of soda is=20

extracted, and La Grita, all to the east of the Cordillera, though no farth=
er distant, are four or five=20

hundred toises high.  On examining the law which the primitive strata of th=
e Cordillera of the coast=20

follow in their dip, we believe we recognize one of the causes of the extre=
me humidity of the land=20

bounded by this Cordillera and the ocean. The dip of the strata is most fre=
quently to the north-

west; so that the waters flow in that direction on the ledges of rock; and =
form, as we have stated=20

above, that multitude of torrents and rivers, the inundations of which beco=
me so fatal to the health=20

of the inhabitants, from cape Codera as far as the lake of Maracaybo.  Amon=
g the rivers which=20

descend north-east toward the coast of Porto Cabello, and La Punta de Hicac=
os, the most=20

remarkable are those of Tocuyo, Aroa, and Yaracuy. Were it not for the mias=
mata which infect the=20

atmosphere, the valleys of Aroa and of Yaracuy would perhaps be more populo=
us than those of=20

Aragua. Navigable rivers would even give the former the advantage of facili=
tating the exportation=20

of their own crops of sugar and cacao, and that of the productions of the n=
eighbouring lands; as=20

the wheat of Quibor, the cattle of Monai, and the copper of Aroa. The mines=
 from which this=20

copper is extracted, are in a lateral valley, opening into that of Aroa; an=
d which is less hot, and=20

less unhealthy, than the ravines nearer the sea. In the latter the Indians =
have their gold-washings,=20

and the soil conceals rich copper-ores, which no one has yet attempted to e=
xtract. The ancient=20

mines of Aroa, after having been long neglected, have been wrought anew by =
the care of Don=20

Antonio Henriquez, whom we met at San Fernando on the borders of the Apure.=
 The total produce=20

of metallic copper is twelve or fifteen hundred quintals a year. This coppe=
r, known at Cadiz by the=20

name of Caracas copper, is of excellent quality. It is even preferred to th=
at of Sweden, and of=20

Coquimbo in Chile. Part of the copper of Aroa is employed for making bells,=
 which are cast on the=20



spot. Some ores of silver have been recently discovered between Aroa and Ni=
rgua, near Guanita,=20

in the mountain of San Pablo. Grains of gold are found in all the mountaino=
us lands between the=20

Rio Yaracuy, the town of San Felipe, Nirgua, and Barquesimeto; particularly=
 in the Rio de Santa=20

Cruz, in which the Indian gold-gatherers have sometimes found lumps of the =
value of four or five=20

piastres. Do the neighbouring rocks of mica-slate and gneiss contain veins?=
 or is the gold=20

disseminated here, as in the granites of Guadarama in Spain, and of the Fic=
htelberg in Franconia,=20

throughout the whole mass of the rock? Possibly the waters, in filtering th=
rough it, bring together=20

the disseminated grains of gold; in which case every attempt to work the ro=
ck would be useless. In=20

the Savana de la Miel, near the town of Barquesimeto, a shaft has been sunk=
 in a black shining=20

slate resembling ampelite. The minerals extracted from this shaft, which we=
re sent to me at=20

Caracas, were quartz, non-auriferous pyrites, and carbonated lead, crystall=
ized in needles of a=20

silky lustre.  In the early times of the conquest the working of the mines =
of Nirgua and of Buria*=20

was begun, notwithstanding the incursions of the warlike nation of the Gira=
haras. (* The valley of=20

Buria, and the little river of the same name, communicate with the valley o=
f the Rio Coxede, or the=20

Rio de Barquesimeto.) In this very district the accumulation of negro slave=
s in 1553 gave rise to an=20

event bearing some analogy to the insurrection in St. Domingo. A negro slav=
e excited an=20

insurrection among the miners of the Real de San Felipe de Buria. He retire=
d into the woods, and=20

founded, with two hundred of his companions, a town, where he was proclaime=
d king. Miguel, this=20

new king, was a friend to pomp and parade. He caused his wife Guiomar, to a=
ssume the title of=20

queen; and, according to Oviedo, he appointed ministers and counsellors of =
state, officers of the=20

royal household, and even a negro bishop. He soon after ventured to attack =
the neighbouring town=20

of Nueva Segovia de Barquesimeto; but, being repulsed by Diego de Losada, h=
e perished in the=20

conflict. This African monarchy was succeeded at Nirgua by a republic of Za=
mboes, the=20

descendants of negroes and Indians. The whole municipality (cabildo) is com=
posed of men of=20

colour to whom the king of Spain has given the title of "his faithful and l=
oyal subjects, the Zamboes=20

of Nirgua." Few families of Whites will inhabit a country where the system =
of government is so=20

adverse to their pretensions; and the little town is called in derision La =
republica de Zambos y=20

Mulatos.  If the hot valleys of Aroa, of Yaracuy, and of the Rio Tocuyo, ce=
lebrated for their=20

excellent timber, be rendered feverish by luxuriance of vegetation, and ext=
reme atmospheric=20

humidity, it is different in the savannahs of Monai and Carora. These Llano=
s are separated by the=20

mountainous tract of Tocuyo and Nirgua from the great plains of La Portugue=
sa and Calabozo. It=20

is very extraordinary to see barren savannahs loaded with miasmata. No mars=
hy ground is found=20

there, but several phenomena indicate a disengagement of hydrogen.* (* What=
 is that luminous=20

phenomenon known under the name of the Lantern (farol) of Maracaybo, which =
is perceived every=20

night toward the seaside as well as in the inland parts, at Merida for exam=
ple, where M. Palacios=20

observed it during two years? The distance, greater than 40 leagues, at whi=
ch the light is=20

observed, has led to the supposition that it might be owing to the effects =
of a thunderstorm, or of=20

electrical explosions which might daily take place in a pass in the mountai=
ns. It is asserted that, on=20

approaching the farol, the rolling of thunder is heard. Others vaguely alle=
ge that it is an air-

volcano, and that asphaltic soils, like those of Mena, cause these inflamma=
ble exhalations which=20

are so constant in their appearance. The phenomenon is observed on a mounta=
inous and=20

uninhabited spot, on the borders of the Rio Catatumbo, near the junction wi=
th the Rio Sulia. The=20



situation of the farol is such that, being nearly in the meridian of the op=
ening (boca) of the lake of=20

Maracaybo, navigators are guided by it as by a lighthouse.) When travellers=
, who are not=20

acquainted with natural inflammable gases, are shown the Cueva del Serrito =
de Monai, the people=20

of the country love to frighten them by setting fire to the gaseous combina=
tion which is constantly=20

accumulated in the upper part of the cavern. May we attribute the insalubri=
ty of the atmosphere to=20

the same causes as those which operate in the plains between Tivoli and Rom=
e, namely,=20

disengagements of sulphuretted hydrogen?* (* Don Carlos del Pozo has discov=
ered in this district,=20

at the bottom of the Quebrada de Moroturo, a stratum of clayey earth, black=
, strongly soiling the=20

fingers, emitting a powerful smell of sulphur, and inflaming spontaneously =
when slightly moistened=20

and exposed for a long time to the rays of the tropical sun. The detonation=
 of this muddy=20

substance is very violent.) Possibly, also, the mountainous lands, near the=
 llanos of Monai, may=20

have a baneful influence on the surrounding plains. The south-easterly wind=
s may convey to them=20

the putrid exhalations that rise from the ravine of Villegas, and from La S=
ienega de Cabra,=20

between Carora and Carache. I am desirous of collecting every circumstance =
having a relation to=20

the salubrity of the air; for, in a matter so obscure, it is only by the co=
mparison of a great number=20

of phenomena, that we can hope to discover the truth.  The barren yet fever=
ish savannahs,=20

extending from Barquesimeto to the eastern shore of the lake of Maracaybo, =
are partly covered=20

with cactus; but the good silvester-cochineal, known by the vague name of g=
rana de Carora,=20

comes from a more temperate region, between Carora and Truxillo, and partic=
ularly from the=20

valley of the Rio Mucuju,* to the east of Merida. (* This little river desc=
ends from the Paramo de=20

los Conejos, and flows into the Rio Albarregas.) The inhabitants altogether=
 neglect this production,=20

so much sought for in commerce.   CHAPTER 2.17.  MOUNTAINS WHICH SEPARATE T=

"No idea I looked so nice," she perked. "The blue sky makes a charming back=
ground. Really, a=20

pool is quite a becoming mirror. Does anybody else want to come up and peep=
? It's like looking at=20

the view-finder of a camera. Rather painful hanging on, though. I think I'l=
l drop if you're neither of=20

you coming. Oh, botheration! I've lost my hair ribbon. It's gone right down=
 inside the cistern. Well!=20

It's done for now. I can't possibly fish it out."  "It wasn't your best!" c=
onsoled Delia.  "No, but the=20

only scarlet one I possess, and just at present I've a wild fad for scarlet=
. I get crazes for various=20

colors. Last term I'd look at nothing but pale blue, till Bertha Ford got t=
hat new blue chiffon dress,=20

and that, of course, set me against it forevermore. I'd a rage for tartan o=

nasty about it; she thinks no one in the school has a right to wear Scotch =

ure different colors make=20

me good or bad. Don't laugh at me! I mean it! I'm a different person accord=
ing to what I wear."  For=20

a short time the girls loitered about on the roof, enjoying the novelty of =
their position, and=20

particularly the fact that they were on unlicensed ground, and would undoub=
tedly get into trouble if=20

they were caught by Dominica or Anastasia. Naughty Peachy, to play the maid=
s a trick, took down=20

the row of towels, folded them neatly, and placed them in a pile behind the=
 cistern, chuckling over=20

the prospect of Anastasia's consternation when she came up to fetch them an=
d found them=20

missing.  "I owe her something for breaking my pink alabaster vase," she an=
nounced. "She's an=20

awful smasher with her duster--just goes surging ahead over our mantelpiece=
 and sends our=20

ornaments flying. Mary's Pompeii pots went to smithereens yesterday. Now, S=
ignorina Anastasia,=20

you won't find your towels in too big a hurry. I guess I've paid you out." =
 "She'll pay _you_ out if=20

she catches us up here," suggested Delia, who was anxious not to forfeit he=
r exeat. "Hadn't we=20

better be getting a move on?"  "Words of wisdom, my child, fall from your l=
ips like pearls and=20

diamonds. The same sage thought was occurring to your humble servant. Anast=
asia has what is=20

commonly called a tart tongue, and an inconvenient and inconsiderate habit =
of reporting trifles at=20

headquarters. It would be quite unnecessary of her to mention to Miss Rodge=
rs that she had seen=20

us here, but I believe she'd go out of her way to do it."  "I'm sure she wo=
uld, bad luck to her. Lead=20

on, MacDuff! Let's descend from the Highlands to the Lowlands."  "We may fi=
nd further sport=20

farther afield. I'm not at the end of my resources yet. I've an idea or two=
 more in my head," nodded=20

Peachy, escorting her friends down the staircase to the comparative safety =
of the back yard.=20

There was no doubt that Peachy was in an exceedingly mischievous mood and r=
eady for any=20

prank which came to hand. She dodged with her followers successfully past t=
he kitchen door,=20

without attracting the hostile attention of Anastasia or any other of the s=
ervants. She was bent on=20

exploring a patch of the garden which was only accessible from the rear of =
the scullery. She had=20

observed it from the vantage-ground of the roof, and had decided that, by c=
limbing on to a low=20

shed, it would be quite possible to scale the wall which divided the ground=
s of the Villa Camellia=20

from those of its next door neighbor. The girls had always been extremely c=
urious about the Villa=20

Sutri. From their dormitory windows they could catch a glimpse of its green=
 shutters and creeper-

covered walls, set away among a thick grove of trees, and they had decided =
that its garden looked=20

immensely superior to their own. The estate belonged to Count Sutri, who of=
ten spent part of the=20

winter and spring among his orange groves and his flowery pergolas. He was =
supposed to have a=20

reputation for gardening, and rumors of his wonderful exotics had circulate=
d round the school.=20



None of the girls, however, had ever actually been inside the grounds.  Pea=
chy's project was, of=20

course, extremely audacious, and had the Count been at home she would hardl=
y have dared to let=20

it materialize. She had heard Mrs. Clark mention on Sunday that their neigh=
bor had started for a=20

cruise in his yacht, and that he would probably be away for a considerable =
time.  "The Villa will be=20

shut up, and only a few gardeners left about the place," declared Peachy, "=
and if I know anything=20

of Italian gardeners, they'll all be sitting smoking inside the summer-hous=
e, so we needn't trouble=20

ourselves to worry about them. It's the opportunity of a lifetime. I saw th=
e whole thing in a flash=20

from the roof. There's a shed on our side of the wall and a shed on his. Al=
l you have to do is to=20

step over and get down. Nothing could be simpler. I'm just aching to explor=
e that garden."  Delia,=20

still thinking of her exeat, demurred, and even Irene's valor slightly quai=
led.  "Oh, come on! Be=20

sports!" tempted Peachy. "You'll never get such a chance in your lives agai=
n--never."  So they=20

hesitated, and were lost, and finally followed their leader up the low, slo=
ping roof of the shed.  As=20

Peachy had prophesied, it was really remarkably easy. They had only to scal=
e quite a low piece of=20

wall, and drop on to the roof of the shed on the other side, then scramble =
down into Count Sutri's=20

garden. In less than five minutes the feat was accomplished, and three rath=
er awed but delighted=20

girls were speeding along a green alley in quest of adventure.  There was n=
o doubt about it being=20

a beautiful garden. It was more carefully kept than that of the Villa Camel=
lia, and contained choicer=20

and rarer flowers. There were glorious tanks of water-lilies, and there wer=
e pergolas of sweet-

scented creepers, and the statues and arbors utterly eclipsed even those of=
 a public park. It was=20

evidently the Count's favorite hobby, and he had spared no expense in layin=
g out the grounds.=20

Rather fearful of being caught by some chance gardener the girls walked on,=
 holding themselves=20

in readiness to dive away if necessary and make a quick escape.  "Do you fe=
el like Adam and Eve=20

in Paradise?" queried Delia tremulously.  "Not a bit, because they never go=
t back after they were=20

once turned out. I wish we could annex this place and add it on to the Vill=
a Camellia. The Count=20

can't want it while he's away."  The girls wandered about in breathless enj=
oyment. Stolen waters=20

are sweet, and somebody else's garden seemed much more attractive than thei=
r own. They did=20

not dare to venture too near the Villa, and kept carefully away from anythi=
ng that looked like a=20

grotto or a summer-house, in which they might find a gardener seated, enjoy=
ing his cigarette. At=20

the end of a rose pergola, however, Peachy made a discovery. It was neither=
 more nor less than a=20

flight of steps leading down to a door in the ground. She stood gazing at i=
t with curiosity.  "Now I=20

wonder what that is?" she exclaimed.  [Illustration: "'I WONDER WHAT THAT I=
S?' SHE=20

EXCLAIMED"  --_Page 183_]  "Looks like the entrance to a mausoleum," shudde=
red Delia.  "Or=20

the strong room where the Count keeps his money," laughed Irene.  "I don't =
believe it's either. I=20

shouldn't be surprised if it's the passage leading to the sea. I know there=
 is one in the Sutri garden,=20

to get down to the bathing cove. How priceless if we've happened to light u=
pon it. Is that door=20

open? I'm going to see."  Peachy ran down the steps, turned the handle, and=
 somewhat to her=20

own astonishment found the door unlocked. She was peering into a long dark =
tunnel, at the end of=20

which could be distinguished a faint glint of light. This was indeed an adv=
enture. It seemed a deed=20

of daring to explore such hidden depths, but she was out to take risks that=
 afternoon.  "Come=20

along!" she commanded, bracing up the spirits of her more timorous comrades=
.  Holding one=20

another's arms particularly tightly, the three entered the doorway and bega=
n to walk along the=20

underground passage. It sloped sharply downwards, and was rough under foot,=
 but the farther=20



they descended the brighter grew the light in front of them. Presently they=
 had stumbled out of the=20

darkness, and were emerging from a tunnel at the foot of the cliffs, and st=
epping out on to the=20

sandy shore of a little cove.  It had always been a great grievance at the =
Villa Camellia that the=20

school had no bathing place, and the girls had greatly coveted the creek wh=
ich was the exclusive=20

property of their neighbor, Count Sutri. To find themselves on a level with=
 the sea, facing the=20

lapping waves, was exactly what they had hoped. They ran along the sand in =
huge delight, to the=20

very edge of the water. It was really a beautiful cove. There were groups o=
f rocks with smooth=20

pools amongst them, and in the silvery sand were numbers of tiny fragile sh=
ells, very pretty and=20

delicate, and just the thing for a collection.  "It's a shame it should all=
 belong to one man who=20

probably hardly ever uses it," flamed Peachy. "Now, if only we could all co=
me down here to bathe,=20

wouldn't it be a stunt? The cove is really mostly under the garden of the V=
illa Camellia. _I_ say it=20

ought to belong to us."  "It's ours for the moment at any rate," said Irene=
.  "Yes, isn't it great?=20

We've got it all to ourselves," rejoiced Delia, dancing along the beach wit=
h outstretched arms, like=20

an incarnation of Zephyr or a spring vision of a sea-nymph. She skimmed ove=
r the sand almost as=20

if she were flying, but, as she reached the largest group of rocks, her exa=
lted mood suddenly=20

dissipated and her high spirits came down to earth with a thud. Sitting on =
the other side of the=20

rock, calmly smoking a cigar, was a middle-aged individual in a tweed coat =
and a soft hat. The=20

creek, which they had imagined was their private paradise, was occupied aft=
er all.  Delia fled back=20

to her friends, this time on wings of fright, and communicated her awful di=
scovery.  "It must be=20

Count Sutri," gasped Peachy.  "He can't have started off in his yacht after=
 all," agreed Irene.  "I=20

don't _think_ he saw me, but I'm not sure about it," panted Delia breathles=
sly.  "Whether he did or=20

he didn't we'd better scoot quick," opined Peachy.  So three agitated girls=
 dashed back over the=20

sands and into the dark tunnel, and hurried as fast as they could up the un=
derground passage,=20

expecting every moment to hear a footstep behind them and a voice demanding=
 to know what=20

they were doing trespassing upon the premises. At the top of the tunnel a h=
orrible surprise awaited=20

them. The door through which they had entered was shut and bolted. At first=
 they could hardly=20

believe their ill luck. They groped for the handle in the darkness, and pus=
hed CARACAS. VILLA=20

DE CURA. PARAPARA. LLANOS OR STEPPES. CALABOZO.  The chain of mountains,=20

bordering the lake of Tacarigua towards the south, forms in some sort the n=
orthern shore of the=20

great basin of the Llanos or savannahs of Caracas. To descend from the vall=
eys of Aragua into=20

these savannahs, it is necessary to cross the mountains of Guigue and of Tu=
cutunemo. From a=20

peopled country embellished by cultivation, we plunge into a vast solitude.=
 Accustomed to the=20

aspect of rocks, and to the shade of valleys, the traveller beholds with as=
tonishment these=20

savannahs without trees, these immense plains, which seem to ascend to the =
horizon.  Before I=20

trace the scenery of the Llanos, or of the region of pasturage, I will brie=
fly describe the road we=20

took from Nueva Valencia, by Villa de Cura and San Juan, to the little vill=
age of Ortiz, at the=20

entrance of the steppes. We left the valleys of Aragua on the 6th of March =
before sunrise. We=20

passed over a plain richly cultivated, keeping along the south-west side of=
 the lake of Valencia,=20

and crossing the ground left uncovered by the waters of the lake. We were n=
ever weary of=20

admiring the fertility of the soil, covered with calabashes, water-melons, =
and plantains. The rising=20

of the sun was announced by the distant noise of the howling monkeys. Appro=
aching a group of=20

trees, which rise in the midst of the plain, between those parts which were=
 anciently the islets of=20



Don Pedro and La Negra, we saw numerous bands of araguatos moving as in pro=
cession and=20

very slowly, from one tree to another. A male was followed by a great numbe=
r of females; several=20

of the latter carrying their young on their shoulders. The howling monkeys,=
 which live in society in=20

different parts of America, everywhere resemble each other in their manners=
, though the species=20

are not always the same. The uniformity with which the araguatos* (* Simia =
ursina.) perform their=20

movements is extremely striking. Whenever the branches of neighbouring tree=
s do not touch each=20

other, the male who leads the party suspends himself by the callous and pre=
hensile part of his tail;=20

and, letting fall the rest of his body, swings himself till in one of his o=
scillations he reaches the=20

neighbouring branch. The whole file performs the same movements on the same=
 spot. It is almost=20

superfluous to add how dubious is the assertion of Ulloa, and so many other=
wise well-informed=20

travellers, according to whom, the marimondos,* (* Simia belzebuth.) the ar=
aguatos, and other=20

monkeys with a prehensile tail, form a sort of chain, in order to reach the=
 opposite side of a river.*=20

(* Ulloa has not hesitated to represent in an engraving this extraordinary =
feat of the monkeys with=20

a prehensile tail.--See Viage a la America Meridional, Madrid 1748.) We had=
 opportunities, during=20

five years, of observing thousands of these animals; and for this very reas=
on we place no=20

confidence in statements possibly invented by the Europeans themselves, tho=
ugh repeated by the=20

Indians of the Missions, as if they had been transmitted to them by their f=
athers. Man, the most=20

remote from civilization, enjoys the astonishment he excites in recounting =
the marvels of his=20

country. He says he has seen what he imagines may have been seen by others.=
 Every savage is=20

a hunter, and the stories of hunters borrow from the imagination in proport=
ion as the animals, of=20

which they boast the artifices, are endowed with a high degree of intellige=
nce. Hence arise the=20

fictions of which foxes, monkeys, crows, and the condor of the Andes, have =
been the subjects in=20

both hemispheres.  The araguatos are accused of sometimes abandoning their =
young, that they=20

may be lighter for flight when pursued by the Indian hunters. It is said th=
at mothers have been=20

seen removing their young from their shoulders, and throwing them down to t=
he foot of the tree. I=20

am inclined to believe that a movement merely accidental has been mistaken =
for one=20

premeditated. The Indians have a dislike and a predilection for certain rac=
es of monkeys; they love=20

the viuditas, the titis, and generally all the little sagoins; while the ar=
aguatos, on account of their=20

mournful aspect, and their uniform howling, are at once detested and abused=
. In reflecting on the=20

causes that may facilitate the propagation of sound in the air during the n=
ight, I thought it important=20

to determine with precision the distance at which, especially in damp and s=
tormy weather, the=20

howling of a band of araguatos is heard. I believe I obtained proof of its =
being distinguished at=20

eight hundred toises distance. The monkeys which are furnished with four ha=
nds cannot make=20

excursions in the Llanos; and it is easy, amidst vast plains covered with g=
rass, to recognize a=20

solitary group of trees, whence the noise proceeds, and which is inhabited =
by howling monkeys.=20

Now, by approaching or withdrawing from this group of trees, the maximum of=
 the distance may be=20

measured, at which the howling is heard. These distances appeared to me som=
etimes one-third=20

greater during the night, especially when the weather was cloudy, very hot,=
 and humid.  The=20

Indians pretend that when the araguatos fill the forests with their howling=
, there is always one that=20

chaunts as leader of the chorus. The observation is pretty accurate. During=
 a long interval one=20

solitary and strong voice is generally distinguished, till its place is tak=
en by another voice of a=20

different pitch. We may observe from time to time the same instinct of imit=
ation among frogs, and=20



almost all animals which live together and exert their voices in union. The=
 Missionaries further=20

assert, that, when a female among the araguatos is on the point of bringing=
 forth, the choir=20

suspends its howlings till the moment of the birth of the young. I could no=
t myself judge of the=20

accuracy of this assertion; but I do not believe it to be entirely unfounde=
d. I have observed that,=20

when an extraordinary incident, the moans for instance of a wounded araguat=
o, fixed the attention=20

of the band, the howlings were for some minutes suspended. Our guides assur=
ed us gravely, that,=20

to cure an asthma, it is sufficient to drink out of the bony drum of the hy=
oidal bone of the araguato.=20

This animal having so extraordinary a volume of voice, it is supposed that =
its larynx must=20

necessarily impart to the water poured into it the virtue of curing affecti=
ons of the lungs. Such is=20

the science of the vulgar, which sometimes resembles that of the ancients. =
 We passed the night=20

at the village of Guigue, the latitude of which I found by observations of =
Canopus to be 10 degrees=20

4 minutes 11 seconds. The village, surrounded with the richest cultivation,=
 is only a thousand=20

toises distant from the lake of Tacarigua. We lodged with an old sergeant, =
a native of Murcia, a=20

man of a very original character. To prove to us that he had studied among =
the Jesuits, he recited=20

the history of the creation of the world in Latin. He knew the names of Aug=
ustus, Tiberius, and=20

Diocletian; and while enjoying the agreeable coolness of the nights in an e=
nclosure planted with=20

bananas, he employed himself in reading all that related to the courts of t=
he Roman emperors. He=20

inquired of us with earnestness for a remedy for the gout, from which he su=
ffered severely. "I=20

know," said he, "a Zambo of Valencia, a famous curioso, who could cure me; =
but the Zambo would=20

expect to be treated with attentions which I cannot pay to a man of his col=
our, and I prefer=20

remaining as I am."  On leaving Guigue we began to ascend the chain of moun=
tains, extending on=20

the south of the lake towards Guacimo and La Palma. From the top of a table=
-land, at three=20

hundred and twenty toises of elevation, we saw for the last time the valley=
s of Aragua. The gneiss=20

appeared uncovered, presenting the same direction of strata, and the same d=
ip towards the north-

west. Veins of quartz, that traverse the gneiss, are auriferous; and hence =
the neighbouring ravine=20

bears the name of Quebrada del Oro. We heard with surprise at every step th=
e name of "ravine of=20

gold," in a country where only one single mine of copper is wrought. We tra=
velled five leagues to=20

the village of Maria Magdalena, and two leagues more to the Villa de Cura. =
It was Sunday, and at=20

the village of Maria Magdalena the inhabitants were assembled before the ch=
urch. They wanted to=20

force our muleteers to stop and hear mass. We resolved to remain; but, afte=
r a long altercation,=20

the muleteers pursued their way. I may observe, that this is the only dispu=
te in which we became=20

engaged from such a cause. Very erroneous ideas are formed in Europe of the=
 intolerance, and=20

even of the religious fervour of the Spanish colonists.  San Luis de Cura, =
or, as it is commonly=20

called, the Villa de Cura, lies in a very barren valley, running north-west=
 and south-east, and=20

elevated, according to my barometrical observations, two hundred and sixty-=
six toises above the=20

level of the ocean. The country, with the exception of some fruit-trees, is=
 almost destitute of=20

vegetation. The dryness of the plateau is the greater, because (and this ci=
rcumstance is rather=20

extraordinary in a country of primitive rocks) several rivers lose themselv=
es in crevices in the=20

ground. The Rio de Las Minas, north of the Villa de Cura, is lost in a rock=
, again appears, and then=20

is ingulphed anew without reaching the lake of Valencia, towards which it f=
lows. Cura resembles a=20

village more than a town. We lodged with a family who had excited the resen=
tment of government=20

during the revolution at Caracas in 1797. One of the sons, after having lan=
guished in a dungeon,=20



had been sent to the Havannah, to be imprisoned in a strong fortress. With =
what joy his mother=20

heard that after our return from the Orinoco, we should visit the Havannah!=
 She entrusted me with=20

five piastres, "the whole fruit of her savings." I earnestly wished to retu=
rn them to her; but I feared=20

to wound her delicacy, and give pain to a mother, who felt a pleasure in th=
e privations she=20

imposed on herself.  All the society of the town was assembled in the eveni=
ng, to admire in a=20

magic lantern views of the great capitals of Europe. We were shown the pala=
ce of the Tuileries,=20

and the statue of the Elector at Berlin.  An apothecary who had been ruined=
 by an unhappy=20

propensity for working mines, accompanied us in our excursion to the Serro =
de Chacao, very rich=20

in auriferous pyrites. We continued to descend the southern declivity of th=
e Cordillera of the coast,=20

in which the plains of Aragua form a longitudinal valley. We passed a part =
of the night of the 11th=20

of March at the village of San Juan, remarkable for its thermal waters, and=
 the singular form of two=20

neighbouring mountains, called the Morros of San Juan. They form slender pe=
aks, which rise from=20

a wall of rocks with a very extensive base. The wall is=20


_
thumped on the door and called, hoping to attract the attention of a garden=
er, but there was no=20

reply. They were hopelessly locked inside the underground passage.  Now tho=
roughly frightened=20

they were almost in tears.  "We shall have to go back to the cove," faltere=
d Irene.  "And show=20

ourselves to Count Sutri, and ask him to take us back somehow," gulped Peac=
hy.  "We're in for=20

the biggest row of our lives with Miss Rodgers," choked Delia.  There was c=
ertainly nothing else to=20

be done. Time was passing quickly, and unless they could return at once to =
the Villa Camellia they=20

would be late for preparation. Very sadly and soberly they walked back alon=
g the seashore to the=20

rocks.  "_You_ explain, Peachy," urged the others, and Peachy, though she d=
id not relish the task=20

thus thrust upon her, acknowledged that she was the instigator of the whole=
 affair and therefore=20

responsible for helping her companions out of a decidedly awkward situation=
.  The gentleman in=20

the soft hat was still sitting under the shadow of the rock smoking, but he=
 rose and threw away his=20

cigar as the deputation of three advanced to address him. Peachy, in her ve=
ry best Italian, began=20

to stammer out an explanation and excuses. He listened for a moment or two,=
 then shook his head=20

and interrupted.  "Sorry I don't speak much Italian. I'm afraid I don't qui=
te understand."  "O-o-h!=20

You're American!" gasped Peachy, her face one broad smile of relief. "We--w=
e thought you were=20

Count Sutri."  "I haven't that honor! I'm only plain Mr. Bond. I've taken t=
he Count's villa, though, for=20

two months. Can I be of any service to you?"  "We're Americans too," sparkl=
ed Peachy; "at least=20

Delia and I are. We're at school at the Villa Camellia up there. I--I'm sor=
ry to say we're trespassing=20

here. We climbed over the wall into your garden and came down the passage t=
o the shore, and=20

now the door's locked and we can't get back again."  "And it's nearly prepa=
ration time," added=20

Delia desperately.  Mr. Bond's eyes twinkled with amusement.  "I'll take yo=
u back," he offered. "It=20

was hard luck to find the door locked. I've hardly explored the place prope=
rly myself yet. I came=20

down in the lift."  "The lift!" exclaimed Irene in surprise.  "Yes, here it=
 is, and a very convenient=20

arrangement too," said Mr. Bond, leading the way into an artificial cave cl=
ose at hand.  Here to the=20

girls' amazement was a perfectly modern and up-to-date "ascenseur," nicely =
upholstered and=20

lighted by electricity. Mr. Bond ushered his visitors inside, closed the do=
or, pressed a button, and=20

immediately they shot aloft, landing ultimately in a kiosk in Count Sutri's=
 garden at the top of the=20

cliff. Feeling as if a magician had used occult means to transport them bac=
k to safety, the girls=20

gazed round highly delighted to find themselves out of the cove. Their host=
, to whom they hastily=20

confided some details of how they had penetrated into his premises, fetched=
 a ladder, and by its=20

aid they mounted to the roof of the shed, and skipped over the wall on to t=
he top of their own=20

wood-hut.  "You won't tell Miss Rodgers?" begged Peachy, waving a good-by t=
o their rescuer after=20

they had all protested their gratitude.  "I guess I know how to keep a secr=
et," he laughed. "I won't=20

betray you. Hope you'll be in time. There goes your school bell. You've run=
 it fine but I believe=20

you'll just do it if you hustle up."  Three breathless girls, with minds mu=
ch too agitated to apply=20

themselves properly to French translation, slipped into the Villa Camellia =
at the eleventh hour, and=20

answered "present" as their names were read on the roll-call. Peachy's dish=
eveled hair drew down=20

a rebuke from Miss Bickford, but this was such a very minor evil that she t=
ook it meekly, smoothed=20

the offending elf-locks with her fingers, and composed her dimples to an ex=
pression of docile=20

humility.  "We got out of that very well," she purred in private afterwards=
.  "Thanks to Mr. Bond and=20

the lift," agreed Irene.  "I guess I'm not going to try anything so risky a=
gain," declared Delia. "It was=20

the fix of my life. I'll be down with nervous prostration to-morrow. Should=
n't wonder if I raise a=20



temperature to-night. Peachy Proctor, you may coax and tease as you like, b=
ut nothing you say=20

will of the group of mountains in the Hartz.* (* Die Teufels Mauer near Wer=
nigerode in Germany.)=20

These peaks, when seen from afar in the Llanos, strike the imagination of t=
he inhabitants of the=20

plain, who are not accustomed to the least unequal ground, and the height o=
f the peaks is=20

singularly exaggerated by them. They were described to us as being in the m=
iddle of the steppes=20

(which they in reality bound on the north) far beyond a range of hills call=
ed La Galera. Judging=20

from angles taken at the distance of two miles, these hills are scarcely mo=
re than a hundred and=20

fifty-six toises higher than the village of San Juan, and three hundred and=
 fifty toises above the=20

level of the Llanos. The thermal waters glide out at the foot of these hill=
s, which are formed of=20

transition-limestone. The waters are impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen=
, like those of=20

Mariara, and form a little pool or lagoon, in which the thermometer rose on=
ly to 31.3 degrees. I=20

found, on the night of the 9th of March, by very satisfactory observations =
of the stars, the latitude=20

of Villa de Cura to be 10 degrees 2 minutes 47 seconds.  The Villa de Cura =
is celebrated in the=20

country for the miracles of an image of the Virgin, known by the name of Nu=
estra Senora de los=20

Valencianos. This image was found in a ravine by an Indian, about the middl=
e of the eighteenth=20

century, when it became the object of a contest between the towns of Cura a=
nd San Sebastian de=20

los Reyes. The vicars of the latter town asserting that the Virgin had made=
 her first appearance on=20

the territory of their parish, the Bishop of Caracas, in order to put an en=
d to the scandal of this long=20

dispute, caused the image to be placed in the archives of his bishopric, an=
d kept it thirty years=20

under seal. It was not restored to the inhabitants of Cura till 1802.  Afte=
r having bathed in the cool=20

and limpid water of the little river of San Juan, the bottom of which is of=
 basaltic grunstein, we=20

continued our journey at two in the morning, by Ortiz and Parapara, to the =
Mesa de Paja. The road=20

to the Llanos being at that time infested with robbers, several travellers =
joined us so as to form a=20

sort of caravan. We proceeded down hill during six or seven hours; and we s=
kirted the Cerro de=20

Flores, near which the road turns off, leading to the great village of San =
Jose de Tisnao. We=20

passed the farms of Luque and Juncalito, to enter the valleys which, on acc=
ount of the bad road,=20

and the blue colour of the slates, bear the names of Malpaso and Piedras Az=
ules.  This ground is=20

the ancient shore of the great basin of the steppes, and it furnishes an in=
teresting subject of=20

research to the geologist. We there find trap-formations, probably more rec=
ent than the veins of=20

diabasis near the town of Caracas, which seem to belong to the rocks of ign=
eous formation. They=20

are not long and narrow streams as in Auvergne, but large sheets, streams t=
hat appear like real=20

strata. The lithoid masses here cover, if we may use the expression, the sh=
ore of the ancient=20

interior sea; everything subject to destruction, such as the liquid dejecti=
ons, and the scoriae filled=20

with bubbles, has been carried away. These phenomena are particularly worth=
y of attention on=20

account of the close affinities observed between the phonolites and the amy=
gdaloids, which,=20

containing pyroxenes and hornblende-grunsteins, form strata in a transition=
-slate. The better to=20

convey an idea of the whole situation and superposition of these rocks, we =
will name the=20

formations as they occur in a profile drawn from north to south.  We find a=
t first, in the Sierra de=20

Mariara, which belongs to the northern branch of the Cordillera of the coas=
t, a coarse-grained=20

granite; then, in the valleys of Aragua, on the borders of the lake, and in=
 the islands, it contains, as=20

in the southern branch of the chain of the coast, gneiss and mica-slate. Th=
ese last-named rocks=20

are auriferous in the Quebrada del Oro, near Guigue; and between Villa de C=
ura and the Morros=20



de San Juan, in the mountain of Chacao. The gold is contained in pyrites, w=
hich are found=20

sometimes disseminated almost imperceptibly in the whole mass of the gneiss=
,* and sometimes=20

united in small veins of quartz. (* The four metals, which are found=20


_
again. It's not worth the thrills. Sorry to be a crab, but I mean it."     =
CHAPTER XIV  The Villa Bleue=20

Delia's good resolution remained only half fulfilled, for after all she vis=
ited Count Sutri's cove again.=20

This time, however, it was in a perfectly orthodox fashion. Mr. and Mrs. Bo=
nd, meeting Miss=20

Morley at the house of an American resident in Fossato, invited the whole s=
chool to come and=20

view the garden on Sunday afternoon, and clad in their best dresses the gir=
ls paraded in through=20

the gate, and were shown the beauties of the lovely grounds. They were take=
n in relays down in=20

the lift to the creek by the sea, and afterwards entertained with ice-cream=
 and biscuits on the=20

terrace in front of the villa, which was all very interesting and delightfu=
l, though not nearly so=20

exciting as the surreptitious peep which the naughty trio had previously ob=
tained on their own=20

account. Mr. Bond might indeed be silent on the subject of that afternoon's=
 adventure, but the=20

expedition into his grounds had been only a part of Peachy's pranks in her =
game of "Follow the=20

Leader," and for one of her sins at any rate she was to be called to accoun=
t. The cistern on the top=20

of the roof supplied a tap on the upper landing from which Anastasia, one o=
f the chambermaids,=20

was accustomed to draw water with which to fill the bedroom jugs.  On the m=
orning after the=20

events just narrated she took her can as usual, but was utterly horrified, =
when she turned the tap,=20

to find the water running red. She was intensely superstitious, and immedia=
tely jumped to the=20

conclusion that she was the victim of witchcraft, so she flung her apron ov=
er her head,=20

commenced to sob, and deplored the early death which would probably overtak=
e her. She sat on=20

the landing making quite a scene, prophesying evil to the other servants wh=
o crowded round to=20

condole and marvel, and showing the bewitched water in her jug with a mixtu=
re of importance and=20

horror. The girls who occupied rooms on the upper landing were duly thrille=
d, and, after debating=20

every possible or impossible solution of the mystery, were on the point of =
carrying the tale to Miss=20

Rodgers when Peachy came hurrying along.  "I've only just heard. Don't, _do=
n't_ go to the 'Ogre's=20

Den' about it. If you love me don't. I guess I know what's happened. The wa=
ter's _not_ bewitched.=20

If you've any sense left in your silly head come with me on to the roof and=
 we'll look at the cistern.=20

We'll soon find out what's the matter. Callie, lend me your butterfly-net, =
that's a saintly girl!"=20

Anastasia, though somewhat protesting, allowed herself to be persuaded, and=
 went with Peachy=20

first to the kitchen floor and then up the iron staircase to the roof. Appr=
oaching the formation, are=20

gold, tin, titanium, and cobalt.) Most of the torrents that traverse the mo=
untains bear along with=20

them grains of gold. The poor inhabitants of Villa de Cura and San Juan hav=
e sometimes gained=20

thirty piastres a-day by washing the sand; but most commonly, in spite of t=
heir industry, they do=20

not in a week find particles of gold of the value of two piastres. Here, ho=
wever, as in every place=20

where native gold and auriferous pyrites are disseminated in the rock, or b=
y the destruction of the=20

rocks, are deposited in alluvial lands, the people conceive the most exagge=
rated ideas of the=20

metallic riches of the soil. But the success of the workings, which depends=
 less on the abundance=20

of the ore in a vast space of land than on its accumulation in one point, h=
as not justified these=20

favourable prepossessions. The mountain of Chacao, bordered by the ravine o=
f Tucutunemo, rises=20

seven hundred feet above the village of San Juan. It is formed of gneiss, w=
hich, especially in the=20

superior strata, passes into mica-slate. We saw the remains of an ancient m=
ine, known by the=20

name of Real de Santa Barbara. The works were directed to a stratum of cell=
ular quartz,* full of=20

polyhedric cavities, mixed with iron-ore, containing auriferous pyrites and=
 small grains of gold,=20

sometimes, it is said, visible to the naked eye. (* This stratum of quartz,=
 and the gneiss in which it=20



is contained, lie hor 8 of the Freyberg compass, and dip 70 degrees to the =
south-west. At a=20

hundred toises distance from the auriferous quartz, the gneiss resumes its =
ordinary situation, hor 3=20

to 4, with 60 degrees dip to the north-west. A few strata of gneiss abound =
in silvery mica, and=20

contain, instead of garnets, an immense quantity of small octohedrons of py=
rites. This silvery=20

gneiss resembles that of the famous mine of Himmelsfurst, in Saxony.) It ap=
pears that the gneiss=20

of the Cerro de Chacao also furnishes another metallic deposit, a mixture o=
f copper and silver-

ores. This deposit has been the object of works attempted with great ignora=
nce by some Mexican=20

miners under the superintendance of M. Avalo. The gallery* directed to the =
north-east, is only=20

twenty-five toises long. (* La Cueva de los Mexicanos.) We there found some=
 fine specimens of=20

blue carbonated copper mingled with sulphate of barytes and quartz; but we =
could not ourselves=20

judge whether the ore contained any argentiferous fahlerz, and whether it o=
ccurred in a stratum,=20

or, as the apothecary who was our guide asserted, in real veins. This much =
is certain, that the=20

attempt at working the mine cost more than twelve thousand piastres in two =
years. It would no=20

doubt have been more prudent to have resumed the works on the auriferous st=
ratum=20


_
edge, lowered her butterfly-net, and presently fished up a wet and draggled=
 scarlet ribbon which=20

stained her fingers red as she held it out to Anastasia's astonished gaze. =
 "I guess it's this that has=20

been bleeding inside the tank and has stained the water," she explained.  "=
But, Signorina, I ask=20

how it place itself there?" demanded the still puzzled chambermaid in her h=
alting English, then=20

mother-wit overmastering native superstition, she burst into laughter. "Oh!=
 Oh! Oh! It is no magic=20

but you, Signorina. Who hid my towels? I go to tell Mees Barbara.  The zone=
 of gneiss just=20

mentioned is, in the coast-chain from the sea to the Villa de Cura, ten lea=
gues broad. In this great=20

extent of land, gneiss and mica-slate are found exclusively, and they const=
itute one formation.* (*=20

This formation, which we shall call gneiss-mica-slate, is peculiar to the c=
hain of the coast of=20

Caracas. Five formations must be distinguished, as MM. von Buch and Raumer =
have so ably=20

demonstrated in their excellent papers on Landeck and the Riesengebirge, na=
mely, granite,=20

granite-gneiss, gneiss, gneiss-mica-slate, and=20


_
"No, Anastasia, don't tell," implored Peachy. "It was only a joke. Look her=
e! Are you fond of=20

chocolates? I had a box sent me yesterday, and you shall have them all. It =
won't do any good to=20

tell Miss Rodgers, will it?"  "You not come on to this roof again and touch=
 my towels?" conceded=20

Anastasia doubtfully.  "Never! I promise faithfully."  "Then I not tell."  =
"Good! You're a white angel.=20

I'll square the girls and get them not to mind washing in pink water for a =
day or two. It ought to=20

improve their complexions. So we'll just say nothing at all about it at hea=
dquarters. That's settled.=20

Anastasia, your English is improving wonderfully; I guess I'll teach you so=
me American next--it's=20

the finest language in the world. Botheration, I've soused Callie's butterf=
ly-net. I don't know what=20

she'll say about it. I'm out of one scrape into another the whole time. Wel=
l, I'd rather face Callie=20

than Miss Rodgers anyhow. She may storm, but she can't give me bad marks or=
 stop my=20

Geologists whose researches have been confined to a small tract of land, ha=
ving confounded=20

these formations which nature has separated in several countries in the mos=
t distinct manner,=20

have admitted that the gneiss and mica-slate alternate everywhere in superi=
mposed beds, or=20

furnish insensible transitions from one rock to the other. These transition=
s and alternating=20

superpositions take place no doubt in formations of granite-gneiss and gnei=
ss-mica-slate; but=20

because these phenomena are observed in one region, it does not follow that=
 in other regions we=20

may not find very distinct circumscribed formations of granite, gneiss, and=
 mica-slate. The same=20

considerations may be applied to the formations of serpentine, which are so=
metimes isolated, and=20

sometimes belong to the eurite, mica-slate, and grunstein.) Beyond the town=
 of Villa de Cura and=20

the Cerro de Chacao the aspect of the country presents greater geognostic v=
ariety. There are still=20

eight leagues of declivity=20


_
along, Anastasia. We'll take the ribbon with us to show as a trophy. It wil=
l give them a little bit of a=20

surprise downstairs if I'm not mistaken."  Owing to luck, and to the kindne=
ss of Anastasia,=20

Peachy's pranks did not on this occasion meet with any punishment. Irene, w=
ho had been greatly=20

fearing an exposure of the whole escapade, once more breathed freely. If th=
e matter had come to=20

the ears of Miss Rodgers the three girls would certainly have been "gated,"=
 and Irene was Llanos;=20

and on the southern slope of the mountains of the coast, four different for=
mations of rock cover the=20

gneiss. We shall first give the description of the different strata, withou=
t grouping them=20

systematically.  On the south of the Cerro de Chacao, between the ravine of=
 Tucutunemo and=20

Piedras Negras, the gneiss is concealed beneath a formation of serpentine, =
of which the=20

composition varies in the different superimposed strata. Sometimes it is ve=
ry pure, very=20

homogeneous, of a=20
