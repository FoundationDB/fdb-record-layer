Nature has strewn her bounties, there is a picturesque group of wooded isle=

clear blue waters of the Neva, and conspicuous for the splendour of the =E2=

contains an imperial residence, a castle surrounded by gardens; and here, w=

may be enabled to save from your earnings, something for the education of y=

your support in time of sickness and in old age: and let all those who by a=

admonition, have acquired the means, send their children to school as soon =

  I, Thaddeus=20

Kosciuszko, being just on my departure from America, do hereby declare and =
direct, that, should I=20

make no other testamentary disposition of my property in the United States,=
 I hereby authorize my=20

friend, Thomas Jefferson, to employ the whole thereof in purchasing Negroes=
 from his own or any=20

others, and giving them liberty in my name, in giving them an education in =
trade or otherwise, and=20

in having them instructed for their new condition in the duties of morality=
, which may make them=20

good neighbors, good fathers or mothers, husbands or wives in their duties =
as citizens, teaching=20

them to be defenders of their liberty and country, and of the good order of=
 society, and in=20

whatsoever may make them happy and useful. And I make the said Thomas Jeffe=
rson my=20

executor of this.  (Signed) happened to be on duty as sentinel, perceived h=

the Emperor was still here, even his very guards had been despatched to the=
 seat of war. Michaud=20

briefly gave his name, and asked for an audience.  He was introduced at onc=
e into the cabinet of=20

the Czar. Alexander looked worn and anxious; young as he was, a few threads=
 of silver showed=20

themselves already in his chestnut hair. He saluted Michaud courteously; bu=
t asked immediately,=20

with a keen and searching look, =E2=80=9CDo you not bring me sad tidings, c=
olonel?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CVery sad, sire;--the=20

 our inferior forces.=20

The marshal[30] thought he did well in preserving your army, whose loss wit=
hout saving Moscow=20

would have been of the greatest consequence; and which, by the reinforcemen=
ts your Majesty has=20

just procured, and which I met everywhere along my road, will soon resume t=

make the French repent of invading Russia.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHas the enemy=
 actually entered the city?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYes,=20

sire. At this moment Moscow is in ashes. I left it in flames.=E2=80=9D Here=
 Michaud stopped abruptly, for the=20

agony depicted on the Emperor=E2=80=99s face, =E2=80=9Cthe expression of hi=
s eyes,=E2=80=9D completely unmanned him,--

he could say no more.  It was Alexander who, after a few bitter moments, an=
d maintaining his self-

control with a strong effort, resumed the conversation.  =E2=80=9CI see tha=
t God requires from us great=20

sacrifices. I am ready to submit to his will. But, Michaud, tell me frankly=
, what of the army? What=20

do my soldiers say upon seeing my ancient capital abandoned without a strug=
gle? Must not this=20

have exercised a most disastrous influence upon the spirit of the troops?=
