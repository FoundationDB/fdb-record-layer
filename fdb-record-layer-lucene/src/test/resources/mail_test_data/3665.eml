, performing a circle of=20

about fifty yards' diameter as though in a circus. I never saw such an exhi=
bition! "Warranted quiet=20

to ride, of easy action, and fit for a lady!" This had been the character r=

brute, who now, with head and tail erect, went tearing round the circle, sc=
reaming and roaring like=20

a wild beast, throwing his fore-legs forward, and so difficult to ascertain=
 what is good. For man has=20

sometimes a foot high in the air; arms, head, legs, hands appeared like a c=

which the consul recommended and ordered to be produced. Some of the guests=
