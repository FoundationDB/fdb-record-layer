"Are you all right?" asked Irene anxiously.  "Fixed splendidly, thanks. Sti=
ck that flower-pot back on=20

the top and nobody'll ever guess I'm inside. Now scoot, quick, for it won't=
 do for them to see you=20

haunting round. The place must look absolutely innocent when they arrive." =
 "We won't go too far.=20

Shout for us if you get so you Benzoni.)  Lopez de Aguirre, or as he is sti=
ll called by the common=20

people, the Tyrant, was killed at Barquesimeto, after having been abandoned=
 by his own men. At=20

the moment when he fell, he plunged a dagger into the bosom of his only dau=
ghter, "that she=20

might not have to blush before the Spaniards at the name of the daughter of=

_
longer," said Jess, putting the geraniums on like a stopper, and dragging I=
rene away.  Peachy's=20

position was certainly not one of comfort, squatting at the bottom of the g=
reat jar, and she was=20

relieved that she had not long to wait before the rival sorority arrived to=
 hold its meeting. The girls=20

came scurrying, flushed after their games of tennis, and flung themselves d=
own, some on the=20

marble steps and some on the tiled seat. Bertha, as the Camellia Buds had s=
uspected, was=20

evidently the high priestess, and opened the ceremony without delay.  "Memb=
ers of the Starry=20

Circle," she began hurriedly, "repeat your oath."  "We vow to be loyal to o=
ne another and to our=20

President, and never to reveal the secrets of our society," recited seven v=
oices in reply.  ("Aha!"=20

chuckled Peachy to herself, in the depths of the gigantic jar. "Got the nam=
e of your precious=20

sorority slap-bang off!")  "We've met together this afternoon," continued B=
ertha, "to settle finally=20

what parts we're going to take at the carnival. Ruth, just look round, plea=
se, and be _sure_ none of=20

those wretched Camellia Buds is anywhere about."  Bertha paused, while Ruth=
 made a tour=20

among the bushes, and seemed slightly puzzled when the latter reported:  "C=
oast clear."  "It's a=20

funny thing," commented the President, "but I declare I can smell the tyran=
t (such is the belief of=20

the natives) wanders in the savannahs, like a flame that flies the approach=
 of men.* (* See volume=20

1 chapter 1.4.)  The second historical event connected with the name of Val=
encia is the great=20

incursion made by the Caribs of the Orinoco in 1578 and 1580. That cannibal=
 horde went up the=20

banks of the Guarico, crossing the plains or llanos. They were happily repu=
lsed by the valour of=20

Garcia Gonzales, one of the captains whose names are still most revered in =
those provinces. It is=20

gratifying to recollect, that the descendants of those very Caribs now live=
 in the missions as=20

peaceable husbandmen, and that no savage nation of Guiana dares to cross th=
e plains which=20

separate the region of the forests from that of cultivated land. The Cordil=
lera of the coast is=20

intersected by several ravines, very uniformly directed from south-east to =
north-west. This=20

phenomenon is general from the Quebrada of Tocume, between Petares and Cara=
cas, as far as=20

Porto Cabello. It would seem as if the impulsion had everywhere come from t=
he south-east; and=20

this fact is the more striking, as the strata of gneiss and mica-slate in t=
he Cordillera of the coast=20

are generally directed from the south-west to the north-east. Most of these=
 ravines penetrate into=20

the mountains at their southern declivity,=20


_
fond of. I suppose it's only fancy?"  "I can smell it too," confirmed Elsie=
, sniffing the air.  "Are there=20

any lilies-of-the-valley out anywhere near?" asked Mabel.  "No, it's too ea=
rly for them."  "Then=20

somebody else must have the same scent, or have picked up Peachy's _mouchoi=
r_ by mistake."=20

A general examination of handkerchiefs followed, but each girl disclaimed a=
ll responsibility for the=20

delicate odor.  "Queer! I can't understand it. However, let's get to busine=
ss. Our waxworks are=20

absolutely going to take the shine out of their stupid old toy-shop. The on=
ly trouble is how we're=20

going to get hold of the right costumes. There's Queen (abra) on the meridi=
an of Nueva Valencia,=20

which leads towards the coast, and by which a cooling sea-breeze penetrates=
 every evening into=20

the valleys of Aragua. This breeze rises regularly two or three hours after=
 sunset.  By this abra, the=20

farm of Barbula, and an eastern branch of the ravine, a new road is being c=
onstructed from=20

Valencia to Porto Cabello. It will be so short, that it will require only f=
our hours to reach the port;=20

and the traveller will be able to go and return in the same day from the co=
ast to the valleys of=20

Aragua. In order to examine this road, we set out on the 26th of February i=
n the evening for the=20

farm of Barbula.  On the=20

ly flowered silk=20

dressing-gown," remarked Mabel. "It would be just the thing."  "Suppose she=
 uses it herself=20

though."  "I won't give her a chance. I'll take it out of her cubicle the n=
ight before and hide it."  "O-

o-h! You will! Will you?" exploded a voice from the interior of the Greek j=
ar. "We'll just see about=20

that."  The fact was that Peachy's crouching position had grown intolerable=
. She was bound to=20

move and reveal herself, and her indignation at Mabel's cool suggestion fla=
med forth through three=20

leagues from Valencia. The ravine is very large, and the descent almost con=
tinual from the banks=20

of the lake to the sea-coast. La Trinchera takes its name from some fortifi=
cations of earth, thrown=20

up in 1677 by the French buccaneers, who sacked the town of Valencia. The h=
ot springs (and this=20

is a remarkable geological fact,) do not issue on the south side of the mou=
ntains, like those of=20

Mariara, Onoto, and the Brigantine; but they issue from the chain itself al=
most at its northern=20

declivity. They are much more abundant than any we had till then seen, form=
ing a=20
