distressful in his lot, by making it all the basis of his cry for help, he =
rises again to hope, and stirs=20

up himself to lay hold on God, to be strong and bold, because his expectati=
on is from Him. A noble=20

picture of a steadfast soul; steadfast not because of absence of fears and =
reasons for fear, but=20

because of presence of God and faith in Him.  Having abandoned Adullam, by =
the advice of the=20

prophet Gad, who from this time appears to have been a companion till the e=
nd of his reign (2=20

Sam. xxiv. 11), and who subsequently became his biographer (1 Chron. xxix. =
29), he took refuge,=20

as outlaws have ever been wont to do, in the woods. In his forest retreat, =
somewhere among the=20

now treeless hills of Judah, he heard of a plundering raid made by the Phil=
istines on one of the=20

unhappy border towns. The marauders had broken in upon the mirth of the thr=
eshing-floors with=20

the shout of battle, and swept away the year's harvest. The banished man re=
solved to strike a=20

blow at the ancestral foes. Perhaps one reason may have been the wish to sh=
ow that, outlaw as=20

he was, he, and not the morbid laggard at Gibeah, who was only stirred to a=
ction by mad jealousy,=20

was the sword of Israel. The little band bursts from the hills on the spoil=
-encumbered Philistines,=20

recaptures the cattle which like moss troopers they were driving homewards =
from the ruined=20

farmsteads, and routs them with great slaughter. But the cowardly townspeop=
le of Keilah had less=20

gratitude than fear; and the king's banished son-in-law was too dangerous a=
 guest, even though=20

he was of their own tribe, and had delivered them from the enemy. Saul, who=
 had not stirred from=20

his moody seclusion to beat back invasion, summoned a hasty muster, in the =
hope of catching=20

David in the little city, like a fox in his earth: and the cowardly citizen=
s meditated saving their=20

homes by surrendering their champion. David and his six hundred saved thems=
elves by a rapid=20

flight, and, as it would appear, by breaking up into detachments. "They wen=
t whithersoever they=20

could go" (1 Sam. xxiii. 13); whilst David, with some handful, made his way=
 to the inhospitable=20

wilderness which stretches from the hills of Judah to the shores of the Dea=
d Sea, and skulked=20

there in "lurking places" among the crags and tangled underwood. With fierc=
e perseverance "Saul=20

sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand." One breath =
of love, fragrant and=20

strength-giving, was wafted to his fainting heart, when Jonathan found his =
way where Saul could=20

not come, and the two friends met once more. In the woodland solitudes they=
 plighted their faith=20

again, and the beautiful unselfishness of Jonathan is wonderfully set forth=
 in his words, "Thou=20

shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee;" while an awful g=
limpse is given into that=20

mystery of a godless will consciously resisting the inevitable, when there =
is added, "and that also=20

Saul, my father, knoweth." In such resistance the king's son has no part, f=
or it is pointedly noticed=20

that he returned to his house. Treachery, and that from the men of his own =
tribe, again dogs=20

David's steps. The people of Ziph, a small place on the edge of the souther=
n desert, betray his=20

haunt to Saul. The king receives the intelligence with a burst of thanks, i=
n which furious jealousy=20

and perverted religion, and a sense of utter loneliness and misery, and a s=
trange self-pity, are=20

mingled most pathetically and terribly: "Blessed be ye of the Lord, for ye =
have compassion on me!"=20

He sends them away to mark down his prey; and when they have tracked him to=
 his lair, he=20

follows with his force and posts them round the hill where David and his ha=
ndful lurk. The little=20

band try to escape, but they are surrounded and apparently lost. At the ver=
y moment when the=20

trap is just going to close, a sudden messenger, "fiery red with haste," ru=
shes into Saul's army with=20

news of a formidable invasion: "Haste thee and come; for the Philistines ha=
ve spread themselves=20

upon the land!" So the eager hand, ready to smite and crush, is plucked bac=
k; and the hour of=20



deepest distress is the hour of deliverance.  At some period in this lowest=
 ebb of David's fortunes,=20

we have one short psalm, very simple and sad (liv.) It bears the title, "Wh=
en the Ziphims came and=20

said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?" and may probably be ref=
erred to the former of=20

the two betrayals by the men of Ziph. The very extremity of peril has made =
the psalmist still and=20

quiet. The sore need has shortened his prayer. He is too sure that God hear=
s to use many words;=20

for it is distrust, not faith, which makes us besiege His throne with much =
speaking. He is confident=20

as ever; but one feels that there is a certain self-restraint and air of de=
pression over the brief=20

petitions, which indicate the depth of his distress and the uneasiness of p=
rotracted anxiety. Two=20

notes only sound from his harp: one a plaintive cry for help; the other, th=
anksgiving for deliverance=20

as already achieved. The two are bound together by the recurrence in each o=
f "the name" of GOD,=20

which is at once the source of his salvation and the theme of his praise. W=
e have only to read the=20

lowly petitions to feel that they speak of a spirit somewhat weighed down b=
y danger, and relaxed=20

from the loftier mood of triumphant trust.    (1) O God, by Thy name save m=
e,       And in Thy=20

strength do judgment for me    (2) O God, hear my prayer,       Give ear to=
 the words of my mouth.=20

(3) For strangers are risen against me,       And tyrants seek my life.    =
   They set not God before=20

them.  The enemies are called "strangers;" but, as we have seen in the firs=
t of these songs of the=20

exile, it is not necessary, therefore, to suppose that they were not Israel=
ites. The Ziphites were=20

men of Judah like himself; and there is bitter emphasis as well as a gleam =
of insight into the=20

spiritual character of the true Israel in calling them foreigners. The othe=
r name, oppressors, or=20

violent men, or, as we have rendered it, tyrants, corresponds too accuratel=
y with the character of=20

Saul in his later years, to leave much doubt that it is pointed at him. If =
so, the softening of the=20

harsh description by the use of the plural is in beautiful accordance with =
the forgiving leniency=20

which runs through all David's conduct to him. Hard words about Saul himsel=
f do not occur in the=20

psalms. His counsellors, tell you the especial motive he had in view?"  "Ye=
s, I recommended him=20

to go, as I think he is too much accustomed to walk in the groove in which =
he has always found=20

himself, and as I do not see much difference, in a matter of that kind, bet=
ween wanting to go and=20

going. He came back thoroughly dissatisfied, having failed to do more than =
exchange a few words=20

with Miss Wylde, by whom he seems quite infatuated. Can you tell me somethi=
ng about her?"  I=20

gave Ursula an account of Wild Harrie, based on Spiffy's information, not v=
ery flattering, I am=20

afraid, to that young lady, and wound up with something about putting Broad=
hem on his guard.  "I=20

don't quite agree with you there," she replied; "opposition will not improv=
e matters in his case, and=20

you must forgive me for not taking the unfavourable view of Miss Wylde's ch=
aracter that you have=20

given me. I really think Broadhem has, for the first time in his life, fall=
en in love, and the best way=20

to take care of him will be to know intimately the lady of his choice, so I=
 shall interrupt their _tete-a-

tete_ with the view of cultivating Miss Wylde."  "But what will Lady Broadh=
em say to such an=20

alliance? Miss Wylde has not got a farthing."  "I don't think he need antic=
ipate any opposition from=20

mamma,--at all events not just now," said Lady Ursula, with a sigh, and I k=
new there was a secret=20

grief which she could not tell hidden in her words. "I am so glad that Broa=
dhem is above the=20

consideration of money, and has really allowed himself to be carried away b=
y his feelings, that I=20

feel quite grateful to Miss Wylde, and inclined to love her already."  "I t=
hink they are going to=20

commence operations of some sort again," I said, as I saw the enemies I lov=
e, but who don't=20

return the affection, ranging themselves behind the table; "part two is abo=
ut to begin, so I shall=20



make my escape. Perhaps I shall see you to-morrow; I am coming to call on L=
ady Broadhem," and=20

I left Lady Ursula, and had to squeeze past Broadhem and Wild Harrie. "You =
seem interested," I=20

said to the latter, "as you are going to stay."  "I suppose you don't inten=
d to show any more sport,=20

Lord Frank, as you are going, so the best of the fun is over. I was just te=
lling Lord Broadhem how I=20

enjoyed that brilliant burst of yours; it was worth anything to watch the e=
xpressions on the=20

countenances of all our friends here who have 'given up the world,' and who=
 thought they were=20

having it all their own way till you got up. I want Lord Broadhem to follow=
 your lead, but it seems=20

he considers himself 'a dear Christian friend.' We must break him of that, =
mustn't we? It is a very=20

bad 'form.' I suppose you don't know what that expression means," Wild Harr=
ie went on, her eyes=20

dancing with mischief as she turned to Broadhem.  The struggles which that =
young gentleman's=20

conscience was having with his affections were manifestly portrayed on his =
countenance, and Wild=20

Harrie evidently was amusing herself by shocking his feelings. I must do he=
r the justice to say that=20

I don't think she could play the hypocrite if she tried; and I began to hop=
e, as I looked at her frank=20

reckless face, that her sins were more on the surface than in the heart. "I=
 suppose you mean a=20

form of worship," said Broadhem; "I wish you would not talk in this way. Wh=
enever I try to have a=20

little serious conversation with you, you turn it off with a joke. I must s=
ay," he added, sententiously,=20

"that the style of young ladies' conversation in the present day is open to=
 great improvement."  "I=20

tell you what, Lord Broadhem," she retorted, "we will put each other throug=
h a course of training;=20

you shall improve my conversation and 'style of going' generally, while I t=
ry to bring you into a little=20

harder condition than you are at present. You have no idea of his innocence=
, Lord Frank,=20

considering that he is a rising statesman upon whom the hopes of the Libera=
l party are fixed. I=20

asked him just now, apropos of the speech he threatens us with, 'if he felt=
 fit,' and he blushed to=20

that degree that I felt quite shy. There was no harm in my saying that, was=
 there?"  "None that I=20

know of," said I; "but we are attracting general attention by talking so lo=
ud. Good-bye, Miss Wylde.=20

I am afraid I must disturb you, Broadhem; your sister can't hear where she =
is, and wants your=20

place;" and I walked off the young gentleman, to Wild Harrie's disgust, and=
 saw with satisfaction=20

that Lady Ursula took his vacated seat.  "What a curious thing it is," said=
 Broadhem, "that I should=20

find in Miss Wylde something which is to me so attractive! I daresay you th=
ink it odd my taking you=20

so much into my confidence; but, except Ursula, I have no one to whom I can=
 speak openly, and it=20

is such a relief sometimes."  "On these occasions specially," said I.  "Do =
you know, I think that if I=20

had her all to myself I could cure her faults, for I am quite alive to them=
. Don't you think there is=20

something very fresh and natural about her?"  "Fresh, certainly, in what sh=
e would call the 'skittish'=20

sense. As for the natural part of it, I should require to know her better b=
efore giving my opinion."=20

"You know," he went on, "she is the last person in the world with whom I im=
agined it possible I=20

could have been in love: she says the most dreadful things sometimes--and I=
 am afraid they=20

amuse me more than they should; there is no doubt about her being immensely=
 clever, but she is=20

quite taken up with the world as yet."  "Not more than you are, my dear Bro=
adhem; come and walk=20

home with me: you will be back in time to put the Wyldes into their carriag=
e, and I want to speak to=20

you." I led him unresistingly to his coat and hat in the hall, and braved t=
he stern gaze of a butler=20

who apparently dressed after Mr Beevy, and who, when I arrived, had smiled =
blandly upon me as=20

being 'one of us,' for all the servants in Lady Broadhem's establishment we=
re guaranteed=20

converted. "No servants, whose principles are not strictly Evangelical, and=
 who are unable to=20



produce unexceptionable testimony as to their personal piety, need apply"--=
that was the form of=20

the advertisement, and the consequence was, that every menial in the house =
had brought a=20

certificate of his or her entire change of heart from their last place. Lad=
y Broadhem was also very=20

particular about the theological views of the family they had just left.  T=
he butler frowned severely=20

upon me now, for=20


_
to him, and for their own ends played upon his suspicious nature,--the tool=
s who took care that the=20

cruel designs suggested by themselves should be carried out, kindle David's=
 wrath, but it scarcely=20

ever lights on the unhappy monarch whom he loved with all-enduring charity =
while he lived, and=20

mourned with magnificent eulogy when he died. The allusion is made all the =
more probable,=20

because of the verbal correspondence with the narrative which records that =
"Saul was come out to=20

seek his life" (1 Sam. xxiii. 15.)  A chord or two from the harp permits th=
e mind to dwell on the=20

thought of the foes, and prepares for the second part of this psalm. In it =
thanksgiving and=20

confidence flow from the petitions of the former portion. But the praise is=
 not so jubilant, nor the=20

trust so victorious, as we have seen them. "The peace of God" has come in a=
nswer to prayer, but=20

it is somewhat subdued:    "Behold, God is my helper;    The Lord is the su=
pporter of my life."  The=20

foes sought his life, but, as the historical book gives the antithesis, "Sa=
ul sought him every day,=20

but God delivered him not into his hand." The rendering of the English vers=
ion, "The Lord is with=20

them that uphold my soul," is literally accurate, but does not convey the m=
eaning of the Hebrew=20

idiom. God is not regarded as one among many helpers, but as alone the supp=
orter or upholder of=20

his life. Believing that, the psalmist, of course, believes as a consequenc=
e that his enemies will be=20

smitten with evil for their evil. The prophetic lip of faith calls things t=
hat are not as though they=20

were. In the midst of his dangers he looks forward to songs of deliverance =
and glad sacrifices of=20

praise; and the psalm closes with words that approach the more fervid utter=
ances we have already=20

heard, as if his song had raised his own spirit above its fears:    (6) Wit=
h willinghood will I sacrifice=20

unto Thee.       I will praise Thy name for it is good.     (7) For from al=
l distress it has delivered me.=20

And on my enemies will mine eye see (my desire)  The name--the revealed cha=
racter of God--was=20

the storehouse of all the saving energies to which he appealed in verse 1. =
It is the theme of his=20

praise when the deliverance shall have come. It is almost regarded here as =
equivalent to the=20

Divine personality--it is good, _it_ has delivered him. Thus, we may say th=
at this brief psalm gives=20

us as the single thought of a devout soul in trouble, the name of the Lord,=
 and teaches by its=20

simple pathos how the contemplation of God as He has made Himself known, sh=
ould underlie=20

every cry for help and crown every thanksgiving; whilst it may assure us th=
at whosoever seeks for=20

the salvation of that mighty name may, even in the midst of trouble, rejoic=
e as in an accomplished=20

deliverance. And all such thoughts should be held with a faith at least as =
firm as the ancient=20

psalmist's, by us to whom the "name" of the Lord is "declared" by Him who i=
s the full revelation of=20

God, and the storehouse of all blessings and help to his "brethren." (Heb. =
ii. 12.)  A little plain of=20

some mile or so in breadth slopes gently down towards the Dead Sea about th=
e centre of its=20

western shore. It is girdled round by savage cliffs, which, on the northern=
 side, jut out in a bold=20

headland to the water's edge. At either extremity is a stream flowing down =
a deep glen choked=20

with luxurious vegetation; great fig-trees, canes, and maiden-hair ferns co=
vering the rocks. High up=20

on the hills forming its western boundary a fountain sparkles into light, a=
nd falls to the flat below in=20

long slender threads. Some grey weathered stones mark the site of a city th=
at was old when=20

Abraham wandered in the land. Traces of the palm forests which, as its name=
 indicates, were=20

cleared for its site (Hazezon Tamar, The palm-tree clearing) have been foun=
d, encrusted with=20

limestone, in the warm, damp gullies, and ruined terraces for vineyards can=
 be traced on the bare=20

hill-sides. But the fertility of David's time is gone, and the precious str=
eams nourish only a jungle=20

haunted by leopard and ibex. This is the fountain and plain of Engedi (the =
fount of the wild goat), a=20



spot which wants but industry and care to make it a little paradise. Here D=
avid fled from the=20

neighbouring wilderness, attracted no doubt by the safety of the deep gorge=
s and rugged hills, as=20

well as by the abundance of water in the fountain and the streams. The pict=
uresque and touching=20

episode of his meeting with Saul has made the place for ever memorable. The=
re are many=20

excavations in the rocks about the fountain, which may have been the cave--=
black as night to one=20

looking inward with eyes fresh from the blinding glare of sunlight upon lim=
estone, but holding a=20

glimmering twilight to one looking outwards with eyes accustomed to the glo=
om--in the innermost=20

recesses of which David lay hid while Saul tarried in its mouth. The narrat=
ive gives a graphic=20

picture of the hurried colloquy among the little band, when summary revenge=
 was thus=20

unexpectedly put within their grasp. The fierce retainers whispered their s=
uggestion that it would=20

be "tempting providence" to let such an opportunity escape; but the nobler =
nature of David=20

doorway with the curacoa when I was addressing the meeting, no doubt sympat=
hising keenly with=20

Mr Beevy (I found out afterwards that Lady Broadhem was educating his son f=
or the "work"), and=20

said to Broadhem, "Does her ladyship know you are going away, my lord?"  "N=
o," said Broadhem,=20

with some hesitation; "I don't think she does. I am coming back again soon.=
"  "I think, my lord, I=20

shall have to let her ladyship know--perhaps your lordship will wait. James=
, mind the door." This=20

meant that James was not to open it.  "Stop, my friend," I said; "your cons=
cience tells you that you=20

should not be a party to this irregularity on the part of his lordship,--is=
 not that so?" I asked.  "Yes,=20

my lord," said the butler, rigidly.  "I will accompany you to Lady Broadhem=
, then, to explain the=20

circumstances. Be good enough to follow me," and I led the way up-stairs.  =
Now it so happens that=20

I have a remarkable faculty of remembering faces, and I had been conscious =
for some weeks past=20

of being familiar with the particularly ill-favoured countenance of Lady Br=
oadhem's butler; but it=20

was not until now that the circumstances under which I had first seen it fl=
ashed upon me. Not=20

many years have elapsed since I achieved considerable renown in Australia a=
s an amateur hunter=20

of bushrangers. The sport exhilarated me, combining, as it did, an exciting=
 physical with a=20

wholesome moral exercise. I now remembered distinctly having caught Lady Br=
oadhem's butler=20

with a lasso. Indeed I had good reason not to forget it, for a shot he fire=
d at me at the moment=20

killed my favourite horse. That he should have failed to recognise in Lord =
Frank Vanecourt the=20

notorious Mr Francis who had been the means of capturing not only himself, =
but a good many of=20

his fraternity, was not wonderful. The discovery tickled me, and restored m=
y good temper, which=20

had been slightly ruffled.  "What a delightful change you must find it to b=
e in the society of all these=20

good people after having passed so many years in the bush!" I said, and my =
tone of anger=20

suddenly became one of easy familiarity, as I turned sharply upon him, and,=
 leaning against the=20

banisters, benevolently scanned his distorted physiognomy. The play of his =
facial muscles, and=20

changes of hue, interested me, so I continued--"But I will venture to say t=
hat you have never since=20

paid such attention to any sermon as you did to mine that Sunday morning wh=
en I had you and=20

your seven friends strapped to eight trees in a semicircle, and concluded m=
y remarks, you may=20

remember, with a few strokes of 'practical application.' I should like to h=
ear the story of your=20

escape from prison."  "Oh, my lord," he groaned, and his teeth chattered an=
d his knees trembled,=20

"I'm a reformed character--I am indeed. Perhaps if your lordship would kind=
ly please to walk this=20

way," and he opened a side door off the landing. "Knowing your lordship's g=
enerosity, and your=20

lordship's interest in the family, and my own unworthiness, your lordship w=
ouldn't be too hard upon=20



a poor man whose repentance is genuine, and I could tell your lordship some=
thing of the very=20

highest importance to her ladyship, and to Lady Ursula, and to your lordshi=
p, and to the whole=20

family."  I knew the man to be a clever scoundrel, and saw that he evidentl=
y had some information=20

which might prove of value. A mystery did exist--of that I had had abundant=
 evidence. Was I=20

justified in refusing to find the key?--besides, if this man really possess=
ed some secret, could it be=20

in more dangerous hands? This last consideration decided me, and I followed=
 the returned convict=20

to a little sanctum of his own, which opened off the pantry, from which I e=
merged five minutes later=20

a wiser if not a better man.  "What a time you have been!" said Broadhem. "=
I suppose you have=20

been arguing the point with my mother?"  "No, I left that to Drippings here=
." I did not know his=20

name, but my spirits were high, and I gave him the first my imagination sug=
gested. "You have no=20

idea what a treasure your mother has got in this man. I assure you there is=
 no knowing what you=20

may not owe to the influence for good of one devoted Christian servant of t=
his kind--the proof of it=20

is, as you see, that Lady Broadhem is perfectly willing that you should do =
what you like for the rest=20

of the evening. Good-night, Drippings," and I passed the bewildered James, =
who evidently thought=20

that both I and the terrified-looking butler had gone suddenly mad.  "Broad=
hem," said I, "I have hit=20

upon an entirely new and original idea. I am thinking of trying it myself, =
and I want you to try it too."=20

"Well," said Broadhem, "I am never surprised at anything you say or do; wha=
t is it?"  "It has been=20

suggested to me by what I have seen at your mother's this evening--and you =
may depend upon it=20

there is a great deal to be said in its favour; it is an odd thing it has n=
ot occurred to anybody=20

before, but that leaves all the better opening for you and me."  "Go on," s=
aid Broadhem, whose=20

curiosity was getting excited.  "Don't be in a hurry; it is possible you ma=
y not like the idea when=20

you hear it, and under no circumstances must you tell it to anybody."  "All=
 right," said Broadhem,=20

"but I=20


_
is flecked by no cruelty nor lust of blood. He cannot, however, resist the =
temptation of showing his=20

power and almost parading his forbearance by stealing through the darkness =
and cutting away the=20

end of Saul's long robe. It was little compared with what he could as easil=
y have done--smite him=20

to the heart as he crouched there defenceless. But it was a coarse practica=
l jest, conveying a rude=20

insult, and the quickly returning nobleness of his nature made him ashamed =
of it, as soon as he=20

had clambered back with his trophy. He felt that the sanctity of Saul's off=
ice as the anointed of the=20

Lord should have saved him from the gibe. The king goes his way all unaware=
s, and, as it would=20

seem, had not regained his men, when David, leaving his band (very much out=
 of temper no doubt=20

at his foolish nicety), yields to a gush of ancient friendship companies--I=
 hate dabbling in=20

companies. I believe one does more harm to one's name by making it common t=
han one gets=20

good through the money one pockets."  "Well, there is more truth than elega=
nce of expression in=20

that remark: it needs not have to do with companies unless you like."  "Now=
, if it has anything to do=20

with politics, I am your man."  "You would make a great _coup_ in politics =
with it; it is especially=20

adapted for politics, and has never been tried."  "You don't say so," said =
Broadhem, delighted;=20

"don't go on making one guess as if it was a game. Has it anything to do wi=
th the suffrage?"  "It=20

has to do with everything," I said; "I don't think I can do it myself; I ma=
de a lamentable failure just=20

now by way of a start," and I paused suddenly--"Who am I," I thought, "that=
 I should venture to=20

preach? What act have I done in life=20


_
generous emotion. The pathetic conversation which ensued is eminently chara=
cteristic of both=20

men, so tragically connected and born to work woe to one another. David's r=
emonstrance (1 Sam.=20

xxiv. 9-15) is full of nobleness, of wounded affection surviving still, of =
conscious rectitude, of=20

solemn devout appeal to the judgment of God. He has no words of reproach fo=
r Saul, no weak=20

upbraidings, no sullen anger, no repaying hate with hate. He almost pleads =
with the unhappy king,=20

and yet there is nothing undignified or feeble in his tone. The whole is fu=
ll of correspondences,=20

often of verbal identity, with the psalms which we assign to this period. T=
he calumnies which he so=20

often complains of in these are the subject of his first words to Saul, who=
m he regards as having=20

had his heart poisoned by lies: "Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying=
, Behold! David=20

seeketh thy hurt." He asserts words?" but the fervour was on me, and I coul=
d no more check the=20

burning thoughts than the trumpet can control the sound it emits.  "Well," =
he said impatiently.=20

"LIVE THE LIFE."  "I don't understand you," said Broadhem.  "If you did," I=
 said, "do you suppose I=20

should feel my whole nature yearning as it is? What better proof could I de=
sire that the life has yet=20

to be lived than that you don't understand me? Supposing, now, that you and=
 I actually put into=20

practice what all these friends of your mother profess, and, instead of jud=
ging people who go to=20

plays, or play croquet on Sunday, or dance, we tried to live the _inner_ li=
fe ourselves. Supposing,=20

in your case, that your own interest never entered your head in any one thi=
ng you undertook;=20

supposing you actually felt that you had nothing in common with the people =
around you, and=20

belonged neither to the world of publicans and sinners, nor=20


_
innocence of anything that warranted the king's hostility, just as he does =
so decisively in the=20

psalms. "There is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not=
 sinned against thee."=20

As in them he so often compares himself to some wild creature pursued like =
the goats in the cliffs=20

of Engedi, so he tells Saul, "Thou huntest my life to take it." And his app=
eal from earth's slanders,=20

and misconceptions, and cruelties, to the perfect tribunal of God, is couch=
ed in language, every=20

clause of which may be found in his psalms. "The Lord, therefore, be judge,=
 and judge between=20

me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand." =
 The unhappy Saul=20

again breaks into a passion of tears. With that sudden flashing out into ve=
hement emotion so=20

characteristic of him, and so significant of his enfeebled self-control, he=
 recognises David's=20

generous scribes and Pharisees, but were working on a different plane, in w=
hich self was=20

altogether ignored--that you gave up attempting to steer your own craft any=
 longer, but put the=20

helm into other hands, and could complacently watch her drive straight on t=
o the breakers, and=20

make a deliberate shipwreck of every ambition in life,--don't you think you=
 would create rather a=20

sensation in the political world? Supposing you could arrive at the point o=
f being as indifferent to=20

the approval as to the censure of your fellow-men, of caring as little for =
the highest honours which=20

are in their power to bestow now, as for the fame which posterity might awa=
rd to you hereafter;=20

supposing that wealth and power appeared equally contemptible to you for th=
eir own sakes, and=20

that you had no desire connected with this earth except to be used while up=
on it for divine ends,=20

and that all the while=20


_
at all events, he sees, as by a lightning flash, the mad hopelessness of th=
e black road he is=20

treading in resisting the decree that has made his rival king--and he binds=
 him by an oath to spare=20

his house when he sits on the throne. The picture moves awful thoughts and =
gentle pity for the=20

poor scathed soul writhing in its hopelessness and dwelling in a great soli=
tude of fear, but out of=20

which stray gleams of ancient nobleness still break;--and so the doomed man=
 goes back to his=20

gloomy seclusion at Gibeah, and David to the free life of the mountains and=
 the wilderness.     VII.-

-THE EXILE--_CONTINUED_.   There are many echoes of this period of Engedi i=
n the Psalms.=20

Perhaps the most distinctly audible of these are to be found in the seventh=
 psalm, which is all but=20

universally recognised as David's, even Ewald concurring in the general con=
sent. It is an irregular=20

ode--for such is the meaning of Shiggaion in the title, and by its broken r=
hythms and abrupt=20

transitions testifies to the emotion of its author. The occasion of it is s=
aid to be "the words of Cush=20

the Benjamite." As this is a peculiar name for an Israelite, it has been su=
pposed to be an=20

allegorical designation for some historical person, expressive of his chara=
cter. We might render it=20

"the negro." The Jewish commentators have taken it to refer to Saul himself=
, but the bitter tone of=20

the psalm, so unlike David's lingering forbearance to the man whom he never=
 ceased to love, is=20

against that supposition. Shimei the Benjamite, whose foul tongue cursed hi=
m in rabid rage, as he=20

fled before Absalom, has also been thought of, but the points of correspond=
ence with the earlier=20

date are too numerous to make that reference tenable. It seems better to su=
ppose that Cush "the=20

black" was one of Saul's tribe, who had been conspicuous among the calumnia=
tors of whom we=20

have seen David complaining to the king. And if so, there is no period in t=
he Sauline persecution=20

into which the psalm will fit so naturally as the present. Its main thought=
s are precisely those which=20

he poured out so passionately in his eager appeal when he and Saul stood fa=
ce to face on the=20

solitary hill side. They are couched in the higher strain of poetry indeed,=
 but that is the only=20

difference; whilst there are several verbal coincidences, and at least one =
reference to the story,=20

which seem to fix the date with considerable certainty.  In it we see the p=
salmist's soul surging with=20

the ground swell of strong emotion, which breaks into successive waves of v=
aried feeling--first=20

(vers. 1, 2) terror blended with trust, the enemy pictured, as so frequentl=
y in these early psalms, as=20

a lion who tears the flesh and breaks the bones of his prey--and the refuge=
 in God described by a=20

graphic word very frequent also in the cotemporaneous psalms (xi. 1; lvii. =
1, etc.). Then with a=20

quick turn comes the passionate protestation of his innocence, in hurried w=
ords, broken by feeling,=20

and indignantly turning away from the slanders which he will not speak of m=
ore definitely than=20

calling them "this."    (3) Jehovah, my God! if I have done this--       If=
 there be iniquity in my hands-

-    (4) If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me--       Y=
ea, I delivered him that=20

without cause is mine enemy--    (5) May the enemy pursue my soul and captu=
re it,       And=20

trample down to the earth my life,       And my glory in the dust may he la=
y!  How remarkably you,=20

you were striving and working and toiling in the midst of this busy world, =
doing exactly what every=20

man round you was doing, but doing it all from a different motive,--it woul=
d be curious to see=20

where you would land--how you would be abused and misunderstood, and what a=
 perplexity you=20

would create in the minds of your friends, who would never know whether you=
 were a profound=20

intriguer or a shallow fool. How much you would have to suffer, but what a =
balance there would be=20

to the credit side! For instance, as you could never be disappointed, you w=
ould be the only free=20

man among slaves. There is not a man or woman of the present day who is not=
 in chains, either to=20



the religious world or the other, or to family or friends, and always to se=
lf. Now, if we could get rid=20

of the bonds of self first, we could snap the other fetters like packthread=
. What a grand sensation it=20

would be to expand one's chest and take in a full, free, pure breath, and u=
plift the hands=20

heavenward that have been pinioned to our sides, and feel the feeble knees =
strong and capable of=20

enabling us to climb upwards! With the sense of perfect liberty we should l=
ose the sense of fear,=20

no man could make us ashamed, and the waves of public opinion would dash th=
emselves in vain=20

against the rock upon which we should then be established. The nations of t=
he earth are beating=20

the air for freedom, and inventing breech-loaders wherewith to conquer it, =
and they know not that=20

the battlefield is self, and the weapons for the fight not of fleshly make.=
 Have you ever been in an=20

asylum for idiots, Broadhem?" I asked, abruptly.  "No," he said, timidly.  =
"Then you are in one now.=20

Look at them; there is the group to which you belong playing at politics. L=
ook at the imbecile smile=20

of gratified vanity with which they receive the applause that follows a suc=
cessful hit. That poor little=20

boy has just knocked a political tobacco-pipe out of Aunt Sally's mouth, an=
d he imagines himself=20

covered with a lasting glory. There is another going to try a jump: he make=
s a tremendous effort=20

before he gets to the stick, but balks, and carries it off in his hand with=
 a grin of triumph. Look,=20

there is a man with a crotchet; he keeps on perpetually scratching his left=
 ear and his right palm=20

alternately, and then touching the ground with the tips of his fingers. He =
never varies the process.=20

Look at the gluttons who would do nothing but eat if they were allowed, lik=
e men who have just got=20

into office, and see how spiteful they are, and what faces they make at eac=
h other, and how=20

terribly afraid they are of their masters, and how they cringe for their fa=
vour, and how naughty they=20

are when their backs are turned. Look, again, at these groups drawing, and =
carpentering, and=20

gardening, imagining that they are producing results that are permanently t=
o benefit mankind; but=20

they are drawing with sticks, and carpentering with sham tools, and plantin=
g stones. And see,=20

there is a fire-balloon going up; how delighted they all are, and how they =
clap their hands as the=20

gaudy piece of tissue-paper inflated with foul gas sails over their heads. =
Is there one of the noisy=20

crowd that knows what its end will be or that thinks of to-morrow? Is there=
 one of them, I wonder,=20

that suspects he is an idiot? If you find out, Broadhem, that you are not o=
ne of them, they will call=20

you an idiot--be prepared for that. The life of a sound and sane man in=20


_
evil nor transgression in my hand, ... yet thou huntest my soul to take it"=
 (1 Sam. xxiv. 11); and=20

how forcible becomes the singular reiteration in the narrative, of the phra=
se "my hand," which=20

occurs six times in four verses. The peculiarly abrupt introduction in ver.=
 4 of the clause, "I=20

delivered him that without cause is mine must be an enigma to those around =
him. If he is afraid of=20

them, they will turn and rend him; if he is fearless, they will hate him, b=
ecause 'he testifies of the=20

evil.' His life will be a martyrdom, but his spirit will be free, his sense=
s new-born; and think you he=20

would exchange the trials and labours which his sanity must=20

at David's mind is still=20

full of the temptation to stain his hands with Saul's blood, and is vividly=
 conscious of the effort=20

which he had had to make to overcome it. And the solemn invocation of drive=
lling pleasures which=20

he has lost? Tell me, Broadhem, what you think of my idea?"  "It is not alt=
ogether new to me,=20

though I did not exactly understand what you meant at first," said Broadhem=
, who spoke with more=20

feeling than I gave him credit for possessing. "I have=20
