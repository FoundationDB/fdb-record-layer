years.(149)   But this is an arbitrary and fanciful system adopted by Chris=
tians to make Biblical=20

chronology fit with facts or theories, and does not represent the original =
thought. The "days" stand=20

for the undetermined periods of the Side-Races, and the "weeks" for the Sub=
-Races, the Root-

Races being referred to by an expression that is not even found in the Engl=
ish translation.=20

Moreover the sentence at the bottom of page 150:       Subsequently, in the=
 fourth week ... the=20

visions of the holy and     the righteous shall be seen, the order of gener=
ation after     generation=20

shall take place,(150)   is quite wrong. It stands in the original: "the or=
der of generation after=20

generation had taken place on the earth," etc.; that is, after the first hu=
man race procreated in the=20

truly human way had sprung up in the occurring in conditions of normal alim=
entation.  While the=20

normal diurnal variation in the fully nourished is about 0.3=C2=B0 to 1.0=
=C2=B0 C. (0.5=C2=B0 to 1.7=C2=B0 F.), in the=20

starving this variation reaches 3.28=C2=B0 C. (5.4=C2=B0 F.). This rises to=
 nearly double this amount during the=20

latter days of life, and is greatly increased above this figure during the =
day preceding death. The=20

temperature at the close falls to a mean of 24.9=C2=B0 C. (76=C2=B0 F.), an=

A very considerable loss of weight can be sustained by the ordinary individ=
ual without a fatal=20

result.  Chossat[958] fully demonstrated the effects of inanition upon the=

Enoch. But here, the Seer who compiled the present _Book of Enoch_ is disti=
nctly shown as=20

reading out from a book:       I have been born the seventh in the first we=
ek [the seventh     branch,=20

or Side-Race, of the first Sub-Race, after physical     generation had begu=

conclusion that a loss of weight exceeding four-tenths of the entire weight=
 of the body is productive=20

of a fatal result. These deductions may be adopted as applicable to the hum=
an species. This=20

statement must be accepted as a mean, as it is capable of variation by circ=
umstances, such as=20

age, obesity, etc.  Death may occur before so great a loss has been reached=
 in some cases, and=20

in the obese the fat may disappear entirely and cause a loss reaching five =
per cent of the entire=20

weight of the body, in a very fat animal, without a fatal result.  Bouchard=
at[959] considers that the=20

important question is the extent to which the blood and organs of the body =
contribute to this loss of=20

weight. Impoverishment of the blood by inanition, which at the time of deat=
h has been found to=20

amount to six-tenths of its solid constituents, is one of the most vitally =
serious elements of this=20

loss; and a relative increase of its watery portion appears, without regard=
 to the employment of=20

water as a beverage.  It must be remembered that in wasting diseases=20

 take place, in which mankind=20

shall be safe. But when the     first is completed iniquity shall grow up.(=

no sense. As it stands in the Esoteric text, it simply means, that the occu=
r under a liberal diet, and=20

may continue for a considerable time before death.[960]  _The muscular syst=
