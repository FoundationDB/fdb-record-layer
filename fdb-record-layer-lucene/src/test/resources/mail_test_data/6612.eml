"That's the proper spirit," the Commander approved. "But let me tell you so=
mething, son. You'll be=20

a better flier longer if you go back to that violin for an hour or two ever=
y day."  "What do you mean,=20

sir?" The boy voiced his surprise.  "Ever draw a string tight and leave it =
for a long time?" the=20

Commander asked.  "Sure did, sir."  "What happened?"  "It snapped, sir."  "=
Of course. It's the=20

same with fliers. It's the fellow with one string, one thought, who snaps f=
irst. Relax, Jack my boy.=20

Relax with your fiddle and you'll ride through this war right into a concer=
t hall."  "Sounds a bit=20

strange. But I'll try it, sir," Jack agreed.  "Good night and good hunting =
to you tomorrow." The=20

Commander disappeared.  Before turning in, Jack took a closer look at his n=
ew treasure, his=20

precious violin. "It's a honey," he told Stew. "Bet it cost a thousand doll=
ars."  "Why not," said Stew.=20

"What's a thousand dollars to a man like Ted's dad?"  "That's just it," Jac=
k agreed. "Seems sort of=20

wonderful, doesn't it, that you and I who've never had a lot of anything, a=
nd Kentucky and Red,=20

who've had even less, should be messin' round with fellows like Ted and two=
 or three other rich=20

guys on the old _Black Bee_?"  "Well, we're all in the same boat, aren't we=
?" Stew drawled.  "Yes,=20

and the same-sized Jap bullet will down one of them just as quick as it wil=
l one of us. For all that,"=20

Jack paused, "it looks as if ours should be a better world to live in after=
 the war is over, all of us=20

getting along together the way we do."  "Oh! It will!" Stew agreed. "And he=
re's one bombardier=20

who's going to try to be around when it's over. Fight hard, but take no foo=
l chances, that's my=20

motto."  "Mine too," Jack agreed. "I've got folks waiting for me back home.=
"  "Same here. And=20

besides, we can't help Uncle Sam much down there in Davy Jones's locker." A=
t that they lapsed=20

into silence.  Jack slept with his violin that night, and next morning befo=
re dawn he stowed it away=20

in his plane. "Why not?" he asked himself. "Red's got a dog he takes along.=
 Blackie carries a=20

parrot, and Bill, a monkey. A violin makes just as good a mascot, and not h=
alf the bother."  When=20

he and Stew worked their way to the flight deck that morning they found it =
crowded with planes.=20

The _Black Bee_ was one of the largest carriers in the Navy and carried mor=
e than a hundred=20

planes.  Because they required only a short run to clear the deck, and also=
 because in case of an=20

attack they must be the first ships up, the fighters stood in front of all =
the others on the deck. Back=20

of these were scout planes; next rode dive bombers; and last of all, torped=
o planes.  Already the=20

air was filled with the roar of motors warming up. Fighters would soon be t=
aking off for a look at the=20

skies close at hand and for practice runs. Scout planes would cut the sky i=
nto a great four-

hundred-mile-wide pie and each would take its own sector of air and sea for=
 a close search. Lucky=20

the scout-ship pilot who could announce, "Enemy task force a hundred miles =
north by east." Even=20

the discoverer of a Jap snooper, a huge four-motored flying boat, would rec=
eive his reward, and=20

besides, with luck, might send the air giant flaming into the sea. Little w=
onder then that Jack's=20

fingers trembled as he gripped the controls and waited for the flight offic=
er's signal for the take-off.=20

Slowly at first, then more swiftly, their wheels rolled across the deck unt=
il they glided out over the=20

dark, gray waters into the approaching dawn.  They climbed a thousand, two,=
 three, five thousand=20

feet. Jack examined and tested his instruments. Stew swung his machine guns=
 back and forth.=20

Then pressing the button, he sent a burst of fire into the limitless blue-g=
ray of the sky. "This is our=20

day!" Jack exulted. "I feel it in my bones."  "Hope you're right," Stew gru=
mbled. "We're due for=20

some luck. Three months in the Pacific and we haven't sighted a single snoo=
per or sneaking Jap=20

ship. It's rotten luck!"  "Cheer up, there'll come a time," Jack sang. He w=
as in fine spirits. The feel=20

of violin strings under his fingers had done things to him. And besides, th=
ere was much more=20



involved in that simple ceremony of swapping a cheap radio for a priceless =
violin than the=20

onlookers realized. He and the fighter Ted Armour had a secret all their ow=
n.  The two boys in=20

their scout plane flew straight away for some time. Fighter planes would gu=
ard the air close to their=20

task force. At last they began crisscrossing the sky. Each time, as they we=
nt farther out to sea and=20

their sectors widened, their crisscrosses increased in length.  "We're head=
ing into a mess of black=20

clouds," Stew grumbled. "Won't be able to see a thing."  "Not so thick, at =
that," Jack called back=20

cheerfully. "Wait until the sun is up and you'll see."  Soon dark clouds tu=
rned purple, faded into=20

dark red, then pink, to take on at last the fluffy white of full day.  "Wha=
t a day for duck hunting!"=20

Stew exclaimed.  "I'll say!" Jack agreed. "But give me Japs, not ducks! The=
 things they did to our=20

prisoners in the Philippines make my blood boil!"  "Mine too. I'm aching to=
 get a crack at them.=20

We--"  "Look!" Jack exclaimed. "Off there to the east!"  "Ships!" Stew expl=
oded.  "Yep! And we've=20

got no task force out there!"  "Duck into that long white cloud, quick!" St=
ew suggested.  Jack's=20

head was in a whirl as he gripped the controls, banked his plane, then vani=
shed from sight into the=20

cloud.  "Contact," he whispered hoarsely. "Contact at last! And there'll be=
 a fight!"=20

CHAPTER III                             FRIENDLY ENEMIES   "Boy, oh boy!" S=
tew exulted as they slid=20

into the cloud. He set his radio with trembling fingers. "Here's where we s=
core a scoop!"  "Wait!"=20

Jack warned. "We can't risk a false alarm. Might pull the entire task force=
 off its course for=20

nothing!"  Jack was thinking. What a lovely cloud this is! There's sure to =
be a carrier in that Jap=20

convoy down there, if they're really Jap ships--a carrier and Zeros. There'=
s sure to be a fight, and=20

this ship of ours is good for only 260 M.P.H. at most! But this is what she=
 was built for, and what=20

we were trained for. This is our zero hour. He drew in three deep breaths o=
f air and felt better.=20

Jitters, he decided. They all get them. Old Ironsides says we'd be no good =
if we didn't.  Stew had=20

not advised going into a cloud without a reason. They were still some dista=
nce from the task force-

-too far to be sure of anything. By following it in the cloud they could ob=
tain a better view.  The=20

cloud was miles long and appeared to dip down toward the sea. They were con=
stantly running into=20

thin filmy fringes and being obliged to drop lower. They didn't want to be =
spotted by a Zero. Not=20

yet. They must make sure that this was really a Jap task force, and get in =
a report. Then let the=20

Zeros come if they would. They'd give them a grand exhibition of cloud hopp=
ing and, if need be, a=20

glorious shooting match as well.  "No shooting if we can help it," Jack tol=
d himself. "Our job is to=20

spot the enemy task force and sit above them, sending in reports until our =
bombers and torpedo=20

planes come to attack. We--"  His thoughts broke off sharply. What was this=
 he was hearing? A=20

high-pitched whistle like a country fire alarm. No doubt about it. It was o=
n the same key as the one=20

they had heard the night before. Stew had heard it too--Jack could tell by =
the look in his eyes.=20

"Some Jap trick!" Jack exclaimed, gripping the controls hard. "Got to be re=
ady for anything!" Stew=20

was swinging his gun about as a ballplayer swings his bat before a try at t=
he ball.  The screaming=20

noise increased. It filled the air, and seemed almost upon them. Acting by =
instinct, Jack went into a=20

sudden steep dive.  The next instant he looked up to see a shadowy bulk sho=
ot through the misty=20

clouds above them to lose itself at terrific speed in the distance.  "That,=
" said Stew, with a shudder,=20

"was a torpedo. The   EVIDENCE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE WOUND.  It has bee=
n=20

generally noted that suicidal wounds are for the most part confined to the =
front or lateral parts of=20

the body; gunshot wounds of this character being found usually in the regio=
n of the heart, the face,=20

and the temples. The presence of an injury to these parts is not necessaril=
y indicative of suicide,=20



but the existence of such injuries in other parts of the body is at least n=
egative evidence of=20

homicidal attempt. Moreover, Orfila has observed that it is not so much the=
 situation as the=20

direction of the wound which gives evidence for or against the presumption =
of suicide. The=20

question has been raised whether it were possible to have a gunshot wound w=
ithout external=20

evidence. There has been recorded more than one case where a bullet enterin=
g through the open=20

mouth has penetrated the brain without passing through the vertex of the sk=
ull and has killed=20

instantly without leaving any external mark.  It is very necessary to estab=
lish, if possible, the=20

direction of such a wound, and this may be coupled with a knowledge of the =
right-handedness or=20

the left-handedness of the person who inflicted it, or may shed light in th=
is way upon some=20

personal peculiarity which may lead to the detection of the guilty person. =
Thus it is said of Sir=20

Astley Cooper that in one instance he remarked that a certain wound could n=
ot have been inflicted=20

except by a left-handed person, and that his observation led to the detecti=
on of the murderer. It=20

has been stated that for the detection of the weapon or instrument used it =
should be placed first in=20

one hand of the deceased and then in the other, while the other extremities=
 are so manipulated=20

that it may be clearly determined whether suicidal attempt were possible or=
 no. There is ordinarily=20

little difficulty experienced in distinguishing suicidal from accidental wo=
unds. In the former case=20

extraneous signs and circumstances point more clearly to the intent of the =
deceased than do,=20

perhaps, the peculiarities of the wound itself. This is to be settled mainl=
y by the evidence of those=20

who find the body; in other words, by circumstantial evidence.  In suicides=
 ordinarily one wound=20

only is met with. At any rate, probably one only that has destroyed life. C=
onsequently the presence=20

of several wounds, each of which was necessarily fatal, constitutes almost =
conclusive evidence of=20

murder, the strength of the same depending upon the necessary fatality of m=
ore than one of these.=20

Thus it is hardly conceivable that a suicide should shoot himself through t=
he heart and through the=20

brain; the coexistence of two such wounds would be almost conclusive of hom=
icide. The existence=20

of multiple wounds is a rather strong presumption of insanity or drunkennes=
s of the person who=20

inflicted them. Men who kill when under the influence of liquor not infrequ=
ently inflict injuries=20

enough to be several times fatal.  The coexistence of wounds made by cuttin=
g weapons, as well=20

as firearms, is not unknown. These are occasionally suicidal, ordinarily th=
ey betoken murderous=20

attempt. If suicidal the deceased will ordinarily be found to have been a l=
unatic.  But evidence is to=20

be obtained also from signs and circumstances separable from the wound itse=
lf. Thus the position=20

of the body may be such as to invalidate the theory of accident or suicide.=
 The position of the=20

weapon, too, is something to be noted with great care. Whether, for instanc=
e, this be firmly held=20

within the hand of the corpse, or whether it had been simply placed there a=
fter his death; whether=20

it be found where it would seem to have been most naturally dropped after i=
ts discharge, or found=20

somewhere where it could scarcely have been placed or thrown by the decease=
d; whether it be=20

found at such a point that it is clearly evident from other signs it could =
not have been dropped by=20

the deceased, since death must have been caused too quickly for him to have=
 traversed the=20

intervening space.   EVIDENCE FROM THE WEAPON AND PROJECTILE.  Evidence of =
great=20

value may be obtained often from the weapon itself. First of all, from the =
position in which it is=20

found, as stated above; second, from a careful examination of itself. It sh=
ould be noted whether=20

there be any blood upon it, and whether this be so fresh as not to have cau=
sed any rust; whether it=20

may possibly be so smeared with blood as to indicate a hand-to-hand conflic=
t; or whether any part=20



of the weapon may have been used as a club or bludgeon, as would be shown b=
y the presence=20

upon it of hair entangled in dry blood. When such blood is removed from the=
 weapon it should be=20

carefully examined with the microscope, since from the detection and identi=
fication of hair or fibres=20

of fabric evidence of the greatest value may be adduced. Next it should be =
ascertained whether a=20

weapon shows signs of having been recently discharged or whether it be evid=
ent that it could not=20

have been so, and such determination of the time element as may be afforded=
 by a study of this=20

kind should be contrasted with that made after a study of the wound. If the=
 weapon be a revolver=20

or a repeating arm of any kind, it should be determined if possible how man=
y cartridges or bullets=20

have been fired, and whether at or about the same time, and this informatio=
n should be compared=20

with the evidences obtained from the body and from the room or locality in =
which the suicide or=20

murder occurred. If, for instance, it be determined that three cartridges h=
ave been fired and but=20

two bullet-wounds are found in the body, an examination of the room may sho=
w where went the=20

third bullet. Next the calibre of the weapon should be noted and the weight=
 of the ball which it=20

discharged and its dimensions should be compared with any which may be foun=
d in or about the=20

body. The weight of the bullets attached to cartridges of various sizes and=
 makes is usually=20

stamped upon the packages in which they are sold, or can readily be obtaine=
d from the makers of=20

the same. A bullet taken from a body weighing after its removal more than d=
o the other bullets=20

undischarged in the weapon by which an injury is alleged to have been infli=
cted is rather=20

presumptive evidence against the injury from that source.  CAN A BULLET LOS=
E IN WEIGHT=20

BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN IT LEAVES THE BORE OF A GUN AND ITS DISCOVERY IN A=20

BODY?=E2=80=94Here springs up a question upon which some very interesting e=
vidence has been=20

adduced in different trials. To discuss this matter completely the question=
 should be divided into=20

two, the first being:  DOES A BULLET SUFFER LOSS OF WEIGHT DURING ITS COURS=
E=20

THROUGH THE PIECE AND THE AIR BEFORE IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BODY?=E2=
=80=94A=20

personal letter received from Captain Charles Shaler, of the Ordnance Depar=
tment of the United=20

States Army, in reply to certain questions, tends to fully settle that a le=
ad bullet suffers a certain=20

loss of weight in the barrel due to the friction between the bullet and the=
 bore; this is known as=20

=E2=80=9Cleading=E2=80=9D and varies according to circumstances. =E2=80=9CP=
atching=E2=80=9D the bullet is often resorted to in order=20

to reduce the leading; lubrication is also practised. The fusing of a bulle=
t takes place especially=20

with lead bullets. A ball which has been partly fused in the bore will lose=
 the fused portions in the=20

bore or in flight, and will move irregularly on account of the resulting ir=
regularity of form. A .45-

calibre, 500-grain service bullet, lead alloyed with tin, was weighed witho=
ut lubricant and was=20

found to weigh 500.5 grains. It was then lubricated in the cannelures and w=
as fired into a butt=20

composed of three barrels placed end to end and filled with sawdust. Tho bu=
llet was recovered, no=20

lubricant being found in the cannelures, and re-weighed, the weight obtaine=
d being 485.5. The=20

loss of weight was, therefore, 15 grains or three per cent, some of which m=
ay have been due to=20

the bullet penetrating the sawdust. A German-silver =E2=80=9Cjacketed=E2=80=

e was little time for=20

wondering, for suddenly they were out of the clouds, not far from the sea. =
And directly beneath=20

them lay the enemy task force. So near was it that it looked almost like a =
when recovered and re-

weighed was found to have suffered a loss of weight of one-half grain or on=
e-quarter of one per=20

cent. The other part of the main question is:  DOES THE BULLET LOSE IN WEIG=
HT IN ITS=20

COURSE THROUGH THE BODY?=E2=80=94This is, of course, intended to pertain on=
ly to=20


_
display against a field of blue.  "Zeros!" Stew warned suddenly. "Three of =
them over to the left!"=20

Jack dipped a wing, touched the accelerator, cut an astonishingly short cir=
cle, and re-entered the=20

same cloud.  "Ann to Mary! Ann to Mary!" Stew repeated in a strained voice,=
 talking into his mike.=20

"Enemy task force southeast, hundred and eighty miles. One carrier, five cr=
uisers, eight=20

destroyers, and three cargo ships."  He waited ten seconds. He, you have gu=
essed, was Ann. The=20

operator on the carrier was Mary. Twice, at brief intervals, he repeated th=
e messages.  "Watch it!"=20

Jack exclaimed, banking his plane so sharply it stood on a wing. In his exc=
itement he had come so=20

close to the edge of the cloud that he had sighted a shadow. The shadow had=
 a voice, a sudden=20

_rat-tat-tat_ that made small round holes in his right wing. A Zero had nea=
rly winged them.=20

"Close," he murmured. "Got to have a care."  They circled about in the clou=
d for fully five minutes.=20

"What's your idea about that screamer?" Stew asked.  "I know what it can't =
be," was Jack's reply.=20

"What?"  "It can't be a meteor. You can see a meteor."  "Probably a rocket =
from a plane. The=20

Jerries have them."  "I wonder!" Jack said once more. "Well, guess we'll sl=
ip down for another=20

look. Tell you what--we'll zoom out of this cloud full speed. That'll take =
the Zeros by surprise. By=20

the time they close in we'll be safe in another cloud."  Jack's idea was a =
good one. Stew had one=20

more good look at the task force. He corrected his report--one less destroy=
er than he had thought,=20

and one more cargo vessel. The distance was shorter, perhaps nearer one hun=
dred and seventy=20

miles. Their trick of dashing full speed from cloud to cloud fooled the Jap=
s. But they would soon=20

run out at an edge of the cloud they had just entered, small-circle it as t=
hey might.  "The Nips will=20

corner us like rabbits in a hayfield," Stew grumbled.  "Let 'em try it!" Ja=
ck's spirits were rising. This=20

was their day. "We'll come out shooting. We've just got to cut one notch in=
 the handle of your gun=20

before this hour gets away."  "Here's hoping." Stew patted his gun.  Despit=
e his rising courage=20

Jack's knees began shaking when, for a second time, they barely escaped a b=
last of fire from a=20

Zero.  At last he exclaimed, "Shucks! This cloud is too thin and ragged. We=
'll make another run for=20

it."  Another run it was, and this time two Jappies were right after them. =
But to his surprise Jack=20

found the enemy unwilling to press home the attack. They would make a run, =
then as soon as they=20

were close enough for a possible shot, circle away. The first time one did =
this Stew gave him a=20

short quick burst of fire, without result.  "Huh!" he grunted the second ti=
me, "I know their game.=20

They want me to shoot out my belts of ammunition. Then, while I'm reloading=
, they'll slip in for the=20

kill. Oh no you don't, Jappie!" He withheld his fire.  So interesting was t=
he game that for the time=20

being they forgot both the clouds and the task force. But not for long. Sud=
denly Stew exclaimed:=20

"Say! Look! That Jap task force is smaller!"  Jack did not look, for sudden=
ly he threw his plane into=20

full speed.  "What the--"  "That fellow was sneaking in too close," Jack ex=
claimed. "Tell you what.=20

We'll take him on!"  "Take him on!"  "Sure. Let him try another sneak, then=
 I'll whirl on him with our=20

left wing lowered."  "Say! You're right! I'll just swing there is no eviden=

h, 1878, in Saratoga County,=20

Mrs. Jesse Billings was accidentally killed by a bullet. Her husband was ar=
rested and tried for=20

murder. On the first trial he was acquitted. A second trial, however, was h=
eld, and some very=20

interesting expert testimony was brought out on matters pertaining to these=
 questions. The=20

medical evidence is published in full by Dr. Lewis Balch, of Albany, in the=
 Transactions of the=20

Medical Society of the State of New York for 1881. The rifle from which the=
 bullet was supposed to=20

have been fired was found in a well, and was sworn to have belonged to Jess=
e Billings. In it was=20



found a cartridge of the type known as the Commercial Long No. 44. This gun=
 became an=20

important factor in the case, and most of the evidence as to whether it was=
 the weapon with which=20

the murder had been committed was referred to the medical experts. The defe=
nce in the first trial=20

claimed that all the lead fired was found in Mrs. Billings=E2=80=99 head. O=
n the second trial the same claim=20

was not made, but that it was a smaller bullet than a .44 and its weight le=

a .44 ball, and that it would have thrown a bullet with such force that it =
must have gone entirely=20

through the head. They further claimed that powder-marks and grains of powd=
er were found in the=20

window-sash, showing that the weapon was fired near the window, and that th=
e hole in the glass=20

was not large enough to admit a full-sized .44 ball. The verdict was mainly=
 won upon these=20

statements. A question for the medical experts to answer was, what would be=
 the effect upon the=20

skull of a .44-calibre ball fired from a Ballard rifle, the ball weighing 2=
20 grains and the charge of=20

powder being 28 grains? also what would be the effect upon the ball? Expert=
s from the Ordnance=20

Corps and from the rifle factories were able to testify that the bullet fou=
nd in Mrs. Billings=E2=80=99 head=20

was originally a .44-calibre ball; also that its markings showed the peculi=
ar left-handed twist used=20

in rifling this particular arm. The defence maintained that it could not ha=
ve been a .44, claiming=20

that the hole in the window-pane showed that. The original window produced =
in court was no=20

criterion, since from repeated handling the hole made by the bullet had bec=
ome enlarged and=20

changed in shape. Both of the experts for the defence believed that the bal=
l could not make a hole=20

smaller than itself when passing through glass. This necessarily supposes t=
hat the ball after being=20

fired is the same calibre as before, which, as shown above, is not always t=
he case. So Dr. Balch=20

fired forty-five rounds from the Billings rifle with 220 grains of lead and=
 28 grains of powder. The=20

shots were fired through glass set in sashes, the glass being 28=C3=9713=C2=
=BC, double thick and American=20

make. The rifle was discharged at varying angles and at distances varying f=
rom two to seventy=20

feet, and he obtained one shot where the hole made would not admit a full-s=
ized ball. His=20

summary was as follows:    Balls unable to pass through   1   Balls partly =
passed            3   Balls=20

ns in the nose. Watch=20

now. On your toes!" Jack warned.  He slackened his speed a little. The Jap =
pressed in. Suddenly=20

Jack's motor roared like an attacking lion. The left wing dipped. The plane=
 cut a half circle. Its guns=20

flashed in unison. The Zero faltered, fell away to the right, began to smok=
e, then went into a spin.=20

Twenty seconds later, just as three Zeros dropped at them from above, the b=
oys lost themselves=20

in one more cloud.  "Chalk up one Zero!" Stew exulted. "That's one up for u=
s!"  "And say!" he=20

added, "that reminds me. I've got to get a message off."  A few seconds lat=
er he was droning into=20

his microphone:  "Ann to Mary! Ann to Mary! Task force split. Two cargo ves=
sels, three destroyers,=20

going due east. Remainder of force same as before."  "We'd better stick to =
this cloud for a while,"=20

was Jack's decision. "It's a good big one, and fairly thick. Those Zeros wi=
ll be swarming round it=20

like angry bees, but  Other rounds were fired from a Colt=E2=80=99s navy re=

distances varying from ten to twenty feet. The holes made were so large tha=
t the barrels and=20

ramrods could be passed without touching. The examination of the one instan=
ce noted above=20

where the aperture in the glass was smaller than the ball is explained by B=
alch as follows: =E2=80=9CA ball=20

conoidal in form, passing with great velocity, strikes glass, penetrates, b=
ut does not break the=20

glass at the point of entrance. The point struck is instantly disintegrated=
, and so rapid is the stroke=20

that it has not time to call upon the surrounding particles for support; he=
nce the smallness of the=20

hole. As glass is made it varies in elasticity; some parts which are to be =
cut into panes cool faster=20

than others. A bullet striking the portion of the glass which has cooled qu=
ickly strikes an object=20

which will yield somewhat to the force; in doing this a hole will be made s=
maller than if that more=20

brittle had been struck. Furthermore, all=20

"All the same, we've got to find out what that break in their task force me=
ans!" Stew insisted.  Jack=20

caught low words in his earphones:  "Jack! Where are you?"  Jack jumped. He=
 knew that voice. It=20

was Ted Armour speaking. "In a cloud over a Jap task from breech to muzzle,=
 that is, the muzzle=20

will measure one or more thousandths or hundredths less than the breech. Th=

"In a cloud over a Jap task force," Ted laughed softly. "Picked up your mes=
sage. I was quite a=20

-that's swell!" Jack=20

swallowed hard. "We're coming out for a look."  "Good! I'm coming too. I'll=
 be seeing you."  That=20

was all, found to be .44 at the breech or chamber and .423 at the muzzle. C=
onsidering these=20

various facts, statements that a ball of known size will make a hole throug=
h glass smaller than the=20

size of the ball when fired do not admit of doubt as to their verity. Some =
