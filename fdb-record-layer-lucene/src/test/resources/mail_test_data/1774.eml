s sacrifice will be=20

plain only to those who, to the minute knowledge of His earthly life, add t=
hat of a thorough=20

comprehension of the laws of Karma. Such occurrences, however, belong to th=
e most exceptional=20

cases.  As tradition goes, the Brahmans had committed a heavy sin by persec=
uting  "Let us go=20

and see whether they are quite dead, or if they can still be helped," sugge=
sted Raoul. "Olivain, we=20

have come into possession of two horses, but I have lost my own. Take for y=
ourself the better of=20

the two and give me yours."  They approached the spot where the unfortunate=
 victims lay.     31.=20

The Monk.   Two men lay prone upon the ground, one bathed=20


_
with the tenets of pure Vaidic Brahmanism, as was done later by Shankaracha=
rya. Gautama had=20

never gone against the _Vedas_, only against the exoteric growth of preconc=
eived interpretations.=20

The Shruti--divine oral revelation, the outcome of which was the _Veda_--is=
 eternal. It reached the=20

ear of Gautama Siddartha as it had those of the Rishis who had written it d=
own. He accepted the=20

revelation, while rejecting the later overgrowth of Brahmanical thought and=
 fancy, and built His=20

doctrines on one and the same basis of imperishable truth. As in the case o=
f His Western=20

successor, Gautama, the "Merciful," the "Pure," and the "Just," was the fir=
st found in the Eastern=20

Hierarchy of historical Adepts, if not in the world-annals of divine mortal=
s, who was moved by that=20

generous feeling which locks the whole of mankind within one embrace, with =
no petty differences=20

of race, birth, or caste. It was He who first enunciated that grand and nob=
le principle, and He again=20

who first put it into practice. For the sake of the poor and the reviled, t=
he outcast and the hapless,=20

invited by Him to the king's festival table, He had excluded those who had =
hitherto sat alone in=20

haughty seclusion and selfishness, believing that they would be defiled by =
the very shadow of the=20

disinherited ones of the land--and these non-spiritual Brahmans turned agai=
nst Him for that=20

preference. Since then such as these have never forgiven the prince- beggar=
, the son of a king,=20

who, forgetting His rank and station, had flung widely open the doors of th=
e forbidden sanctuary to=20

the pariah and the man of low estate, thus giving precedence to personal me=
rit over hereditary=20

rank or fortune. The sin was theirs--the cause nevertheless Himself: hence =
the "Merciful and the=20

Blessed One" could not go out with his face toward the earth; this one was =
dead. The other leaned=20

against a tree, supported there by the two valets, and was praying ferventl=
y, with clasped hands=20

and eyes raised to Heaven. He had received a ball in his thigh, which had b=
roken the bone. The=20

young men first approached the dead man.  "He is a priest," said Bragelonne=
, "he has worn the=20

tonsure. Oh, the scoundrels! to lift their hands against a minister of God.=
"  "Come here, sir," said=20

Urban, an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his cam=
paigns; "come here,=20

there is nothing to be done with him, whilst we may perhaps be able to save=
 the other."  The=20

wounded man smiled sadly. "Save me! Oh, no!" said he, "but help me to die, =
if you can."  "Are you=20

a priest?" asked Raoul.  "No sir."  "I ask, as your unfortunate companion a=
ppeared to me to belong=20

to the church."  "He is the curate of Bethune, sir, and was carrying the ho=
ly vessels belonging to=20

his church, and the treasure of the chapter, to a safe place, the prince ha=
ving abandoned our town=20

yesterday; and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about =
the country, no one=20

dared to accompany the good man, so I offered to do so.  "And, sir," contin=
ued the wounded man,=20

"I suffer much and would like, if possible, to be carried to some house."  =
"Where you can be=20

relieved?" asked De Guiche.  "No, where I can confess."  "But perhaps you a=
re not so dangerously=20

wounded as you think," said Raoul.  "Sir," replied the wounded man, "believ=
e me, there is no time=20

to lose; the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines."  "=
Are you a surgeon?"=20

asked De Guiche.  "No, but I know a little about wounds, and mine, I know, =
is mortal. Try,=20

therefore, either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or=20


_
world of illusion and created causes without atoning for the sin of all--th=
erefore of these Brahmans=20

also. If "man afflicted by man" found safe refuge with the Tathagata, "man =
afflicting man" had also=20

his share in His self-sacrificing, all-embracing and forgiving love. It is =
stated that He desired to=20

atone for the sin of His enemies. Then only was He willing to become a full=
 Dharmakaya, a=20

Jivanmukta "without remains."  The close of Shankaracharya's life brings us=
 face to face with a=20

fresh mystery. Shankaracharya retires to a cave in the Himalayas, permittin=
g none of his disciples=20

to follow him, and disappears therein for ever from the sight of the profan=
e. Is he dead? Tradition=20

and popular belief answer in the negative, and some of the local Gurus, if =
they do not emphatically=20

corroborate, do not deny the rumour. The truth with its mysterious details =
as given in the Secret=20

Doctrine is known but to them; it can be given out fully only to the direct=
 followers of the great=20

Dravidian Guru, and it is for them alone to reveal of it as much as they th=
ink fit. Still it is maintained=20

that this Adept of Adepts lives to this day in his spiritual entity as a my=
sterious, unseen, yet=20

overpowering presence among the Brotherhood of Shamballa, beyond, far beyon=
d, the snowy-

capped Himalayas.      SECTION XLIV. "REINCARNATIONS" OF BUDDHA.   Every se=
ction in the=20

chapter on "Dezhin Shegpa"(675) (Tathagata) in the Commentaries represents =
one year of that=20

great Philosopher's life, in its dual aspect of public and private teacher,=
 the two being contrasted=20

and commented upon. It shows the Sage reaching Buddha-hood through a long c=
ourse of study,=20

meditation, and saved; as for my body, it is lost."  "To die whilst doing a=
 good deed! It is=20

impossible. God will help you."  "Gentlemen, in the name of Heaven!" said t=
he wounded man,=20

collecting all his forces, as if to get up, "let us not lose time in useles=
s words. Either help me to=20

gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will sen=
d me the first monk, the=20

first cure, the first priest you may meet. But," he added in a despairing t=
one, "perhaps no one will=20

dare to come for it is known that the Spaniards are ranging through the cou=
ntry, and I shall die=20

without absolution. My God! my God! Good God! good God!" added the wounded =
man, in an=20

accent of terror which made the young men shudder; "you will not allow that=
? that would be too=20

terrible!"  "Calm yourself, sir," replied De Guiche. "I swear to you, you s=
hall receive the consolation=20

that you ask. Only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can dema=
nd aid and a village=20

from which we can fetch a priest."  "Thank you, and God reward you! About h=
alf a mile from this,=20

on the same road, there is an inn, and about a mile further on, after leavi=
ng the inn, you will reach=20

the village of Greney. There you must find the curate, or if he is not at h=
ome, go to the convent of=20

the Augustines, which is the last house on the right, and bring me one of t=
he brothers. Monk or=20

priest, it matters not, provided only that he has received from holy church=
 the power of absolving in=20

articulo mortis."  "Monsieur d'Arminges," said De Guiche, "remain beside th=
is unfortunate man and=20

see that he is removed as gently as possible. The vicomte and myself will g=
o and find a priest."=20

"Go, sir," replied the=20


_

n" being missed. The=20

Bodhisattva became a Buddha and a Nirvani through personal effort and merit=
, after having had to=20

undergo all the hardships of every other neophyte--not by virtue of a divin=
e birth, as thought by=20

some. It was only the reaching of Nirvana while still living in the body an=
d on this earth that was=20

due to His having been in previous births high on the "Path of Dzyan" (know=
ledge, wisdom).=20

ow the axiom, 'Non bis in=20

idem.'"  "Courage, sir," said Raoul to the wounded man. "We are going to ex=
ecute your wishes."=20

"May Heaven prosper you!" replied the dying man, with an accent of gratitud=
e impossible to=20

describe.  The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in=
 ten minutes reached=20

the inn. Raoul, without dismounting, called to the host and announced that =
a wounded man was=20

about to=20
