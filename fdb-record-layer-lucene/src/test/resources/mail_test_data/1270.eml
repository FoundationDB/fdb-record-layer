philodendron monstera Only--tell Lady Lindores."  She held out her hand to him, which he stooped to touch--it was all he could do--and once more gave him an anxious, tender smile. "You may trust both mamma and me," she said.  And in another moment, so it seemed, the dogcart stopped again. John went over the streets of philodendron monstera Only--tell Lady Lindores."  She held out her hand to him, which he stooped to touch--it was all he could do--and once more gave him an anxious, tender smile. "You may trust both mamma and me," she said.  And in another moment, so it seemed, the dogcart stopped again. John went over the streets of _
status.  It was n't a public dinner, such as a politician gives to another politician; it was n't an 

automobile ride or a club affair.  It was a private dinner, very private!  They introduced him to the 

select few, the inner circle,--him and his wife,--his wife!!" she wailed.  "But what does that lead to?" 

"We might not go there, but we could have had the Skinners here."  "What good would that do?  It 

would n't put you in direct touch with the Wilkinsons, even if you did have the Skinners here."  "No, 

but it would help.  The J. Matthews Wilkinsons dine them one day, the Willard Jacksons dine them 

another day.  See--the connecting link?"  "Oh, damn these social distinctions," said Jackson.  "It's 

you women that make 'em.  We men don't!"  "I can't eat any breakfast," Mrs. Jackson sobbed. 

"I'm too upset.  I must go to my room!"  Jackson did n't eat much breakfast either.  When his wife 

had gone, he threw the paper to the floor and kicked it under the table, then he jammed his hat on 

to his head, and with a whole mass of profanity bubbling and boiling within him, he left the house. 

In the calm that succeeded the storm within, Jackson reflected that his present domestic 

tranquillity was threatened by the presence of these Skinners, and not only that, but their coming, 

if he could not avail of it, would be a source of reproach for years to come.  Being something of a 

bookkeeper, he figured out that if, on the one hand, he might be compelled to eat a bit of humble 

pie,--not customarily a part of the curmudgeon's diet,--on the other hand, he would gain perhaps 

years of immunity from reproaches and twitting.  Many times he passed and re-passed The Hotel, 

first with a grim determination to go in, and then with as grim a determination not to go in.  But at 

last his wife's troubled, haunting eyes won, as they always did, and he went in.  Jackson waited an 

hour before Skinner appeared.  Skinner had reckoned that about that time the curmudgeon would 

be lounging around downstairs, waiting to meet him quite accidentally, so he permitted himself a 

cigar and a stroll in the office, which stroll was made to appear casual.  The curmudgeon had 

disposed himself in a huge armchair, which commanded a view of the nearer hame or a's done." 

"Eh, Tammas, man! what do you ca' nearer hame? My heart's just broken; and what will his 

mammaw say?" the faithful creature cried.  Meanwhile it might have been a party of pleasure that 

threaded its way among the trees, somewhat closely packed in the dogcart, but no more than they 

might have been, starting for the moors. John Erskine drove himself to the examination which was 

to decide his fate one way or another, with all the appearance of a perfectly free agent. The horse 

was fresh, the morning bright; and though the four men were a heavy load, they skimmed along 

the country road as gaily as if all had been well. Tinto was visible for the greater part of the way. 

They passed by the very gates of Lindores. John had shaken himself together as he took the reins 

in his hand, and with perhaps a little unconscious bravado, paused now and then to indicate a 

favourite point of view to his friend. But he had harder work in store. Just before they reached 

Dunearn, he perceived drawn up by the roadside Lady Lindores's carriage, in which Edith was 

seated alone. Impossible to describe the feelings with which, as across a gulf of pain and trouble, 

the unfortunate young man, at this crisis of his fate, looked at the girl with whom, when he last saw 

her, he had been so near the edge of a mutual understanding. It was impossible for him now to do 

other than draw up by the side of the carriage to speak to her; and there, in the hearing of the two 

men who formed his escort, and whose presence was heavy on his heart, the following 

conversation took place. Edith looked up at him with a smile and an expression of pleasure which 

brightened her whole aspect. She was in mourning, and somewhat pale.  "I am waiting for 

mamma," she said. "One of her pensioners is ill in that cottage. I was glad of the chance of 



bringing her out for a little air. We are with poor Carry, you know."  "How is Lady Caroline?" John 

asked.  "Oh, well enough, when one considers all things," said Edith, hastily; and to escape that 

subject, which was not to be entered on before strangers, she said, "You are going to Dunearn?" 

"On painful business," he said. "I wonder if I may ask you one thing?" She looked up at him 


_
busied himself assiduously staring at, but not perceiving, the pages of the Sunday magazine 

section.  With equal assiduity, Skinner, who as soon as he had left the elevator had observed 

Jackson, avoided seeing him, although he clearly perceived him.  Thus they played at cross-

purposes for a while, these two overgrown boys.  "Hello," said Jackson, looking up from his paper 

as Skinner strolled past for the fourth time.  "You here yet?"  "I hate to tear myself away," said 

Skinner.  "Have a cigar?"  Jackson took the weed and indicated a chair next his own.  "By belief, 

which might have encouraged any man to speak. Edith had no fear of what he might ask her. For 

John it was more difficult to command himself and his voice at that moment than at any previous 

one since his trial began. He cleared his throat with an effort, and his voice was husky. "You will 

hear things said of me--that may make you turn from--an old friend altogether. I want you not to 

believe them. And tell Lady Lindores. Do not believe them. It is not true."  "Mr Erskine, what is it--

what is it? You may be sure I shall believe nothing against you--nor

comfortably, "I like this town.  Wonderful climate, fine people--and"--he turned to Jackson--

"devilish good grub."  "Have you had a trout dinner yet?" said Jackson.  "Yes.  Out at the Lake the 

other day."  "I mean a _real_ one--cooked by a _real_ cook--all the trimmings."  "No, I can't say 

that I have."  Jackson paused, drummed on the arm of his chair, and swallowed hard. "I've got the 

best cook in the upon him anxiously and upon the stranger beside him, whose face was unknown 

to her, and who sat blank and passive like a servant, yet who was not a servant. Edith rose in the 

carriage in her great anxiety, and gazed as if she would have read a volume in John's face. What 

it cost him to look at her and to keep a kind of smile on his, it would be hard to tell.  "I cannot enter 

into explanations now. I may not
