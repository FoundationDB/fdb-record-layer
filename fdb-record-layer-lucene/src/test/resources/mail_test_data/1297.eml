Therefore he determined upon the course that would at least give him a chan=

secretly, and was with his wife in Nantes before the king was aware that th=
e bird had flown. The event justified his distrust, for on September 7, 134=
1, the Court of Peers adjudged the duchy of Brittany to Jeanne de Penthievr=
e and _
Oregon--although not to fifty-four forty--was soon to be duly made American=
 soil. But Jackson did=20

not live to witness the event. Early in 1845 his health began to fail rapid=
ly and on the very day of=20

Polk's inauguration he was at the point of death. Rallying, he struggled ma=
nfully for three months=20

against the combined effects of consumption, dropsy, and dysentery. But on =
Sunday, the 8th of=20

June, the end came. In accordance with a pledge which he had given his wife=
 years before, he=20

had become a communicant of the Presbyterian church; and his last words to =
the friends about his=20

bedside were messages of Christian cheer. After two days the body was laid =
to rest in the=20

Hermitage garden, beside the grave of the companion whose loss he had never=
 ceased to mourn=20

with all the feeling of which his great nature was capable. The authorities=
 at the national capital=20

ordered public honors to be paid to the ex-President, and gatherings in all=
 parts of the country=20

listened with much show of feeling to appropriate eulogies.  "General Jacks=
on," said Daniel=20

Webster to Thurlow Weed in 1837, "is an honest and upright man. He does wha=
t he thinks is right,=20

and does it with all his might. He has a violent temper, which leads him of=
ten to hasty conclusions.=20

It also causes him to view as personal to himself the public acts of other =
men. For this reason=20

there is great difference between Jackson angry and Jackson in good humor. =
When he is calm,=20

his judgment is good; when angry, it is usually bad. . . . His patriotism i=
s no more to be questioned=20

than that of Washington. He is the greatest General we have and, except Was=
hington, the=20

greatest we ever had."  To this characterization of Andrew Jackson by his g=
reatest American=20

contemporary it is impossible to make noteworthy addition. His was a charac=
ter of striking=20

contradictions. His personal virtues were honesty, bravery, open-heartednes=
s, chivalry toward=20

women, hospitality, steadfastness. His personal faults were irascibility, e=
gotism, stubbornness,=20

vindictiveness, and intolerance of the opinions of others. He was not a sta=
tesman; yet some of the=20

highest qualities of statesmanship were in him. He had a perception of the =
public will which has=20

rarely been surpassed; and in most, if not all, of the great issues of his =
time he had a grasp of the=20

right end of the question.  The country came to the belief that the Nationa=
l Bank should not be=20

revived. It accepted and perpetuated Van Buren's independent treasury plan.=
 The annexation of=20

Texas, which Jackson strongly favored, became an accomplished fact with the=
 approval of a=20

majority of the people. The moderated protective tariff to which Jackson in=
clined was kept up until=20

the Civil War. The removal of the Indians to reservations beyond the Missis=
sippi fell in with the=20

views of the public upon that subject and inaugurated an Indian policy whic=
h was closely adhered=20

to for more than half a century. In his vindication of executive independen=
ce Jackson broke new=20

ground, crudely enough it is true; yet, whatever the merits of his ideas at=
 the moment, they=20

reshaped men's conception of the presidency and helped make that office the=
 power that it is=20

today. The strong stand taken against nullification clarified popular opini=
on upon the nature of the=20

Union and lent new and powerful support to national vigor and dignity.  Ove=
r against these=20

achievements must be placed the introduction of the Spoils System, which de=
bauched the Civil=20

Service and did the country lasting harm; yet Jackson only responded to pub=
lic opinion which held=20

"rotation in office to be time of the good Charlemagne, king of France, the=
re never fell so great=20

adventures."  The history of the Hundred Years' War is quite beyond the sco=
pe of this volume; but=20

let us be humble camp followers of the great armies that march across Frois=
sart's pages, where=20

perchance we may find some women as amazons, as heroines, or as pitiful vic=
tims in this=20

sanguinary and ruinous conflict.  The first woman whom we note in this peri=
od, Jeanne de=20



Montfort, was a veritable heroine of the wars, one known to us, through the=
 enthusiastic record of=20

Froissart, as an amazon, but hardly known at all as a woman. The only reall=
y interesting part of=20

her career is that occurring during the wars in Brittany, and so we shall b=
egin her history with=20

these events. Marguerite, or Jeanne,--as she was called, perhaps because he=
r husband's name=20

was Jean,--de Montfort, wife of the Count de Montfort, was sister to the Co=
unt of Flanders. The=20

countess, whom we shall call Jeanne, was already a matron when events in he=
r husband's native=20

Brittany called for his and her presence there. For generations, Brittany h=
ad been ruled by a line of=20

princes who were regarded by the native population with far greater affecti=
on and respect than any=20

king of France could inspire; for they were of an ancient house, associated=
 with all the poetic=20

legends of the land which, poets tell us, had been of the domain of the nob=
le King Arthur. Half of=20

Brittany was rather inclined to sympathy with France, owing to admixture of=
 French blood, while=20

the other half, _Bretagne bretonnante_, clung to the Celtic traditions and =
to those of England, the=20

land once dominated by their race across the channel; but Bretons of any pa=
rt of Brittany were=20

Bretons first and always; the allegiance to their dukes was paramount; that=
 to the King of France=20

was quite an afterthought.  When John III., Duke of Brittany and a descenda=
nt of that Pierre=20

Mauclerc who caused such serious trouble to Blanche de Castille, died witho=
ut issue in 1341, he=20

left the succession to his duchy in a very uncertain state. He himself had =
intended that the ducal=20

crown should go to his niece, Jeanne de Penthievre, the wife of Charles de =
Blois, rather than to=20

Jean de Montfort, who was only a half-brother on the mother's side. To the =
ordinary mind it would=20

seem that Jean de Montfort had at least a reasonable claim; but the Count d=
e Blois was a nephew=20

of Philippe VI., who would therefore throw all his influence against the fa=
mily of Montfort, long=20

allied in one way or another with England.  Both Montfort and his wife real=
ized that if the=20

succession were left to the adjudication of the French Court of Peers, thei=
r claim would receive no=20

consideration. Supported in his bold act by the ambitious and courageous Je=
anne, the Count de=20

Montfort, immediately after his half-brother's death, "went incontinent to =
Nantes, the sovereign city=20

of all Bretayne," where his liberal promises and general fair conduct won h=
im the confidence of the=20

citizens, so that "he was received as their chief lord, as most next of blo=
od to his brother=20

deceased, and so (they) did to him homage and fealty. Then he and his wife,=
 who had both the=20

hearts of a lion, determined with their counsel to call a court and to keep=
 a solemn feast at Nantes=20

at a day limited, against the which day they sent for all the nobles and co=
unsels of the good towns=20

of Bretayne, to be there to do their homage and fealty to him as to their s=
overeign lord."  While the=20

new duke and duchess were waiting and hoping for a large accession of Breto=
n knights on the day=20

appointed for=20

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE  The events of the period covered in this volume are d=
escribed with=20

some fullness in all of the general American histories. Of these, two are e=
specially noteworthy for=20

literary quality and other elements of popular interest: Woodrow Wilson's H=
istory of the American=20

People, 5 vols. (1902), and John B. McMaster's History of the People of the=
 United States, 8 vols.=20

(1883-1913). The Jacksonian epoch is treated in Wilson's fourth volume and =
in McMaster's fifth=20

and sixth volumes. On similar lines, but with more emphasis on political an=
d constitutional matters,=20

is James Schouler's History of the United States under the Constitution, 7 =
vols. (1880-1913), vols.=20

III-IV. One seeking a scholarly view of the period, in an adequate literary=
 setting, can hardly do=20

better, however, than to read Frederick J. Turner's Rise of the New West (1=
906) and William=20

MacDonald's Jacksonian Democracy (1906). These are volumes XIV and XV in Th=
e American=20

Nation, edited by Albert B. Hart.  Biographies are numerous and in a number=
 of instances=20

excellent. Of lives of Jackson, upwards of a dozen have been published. The=
 most recent and in=20

every respect the best is John S. Bassett's Life of Andrew Jackson, 2 vols.=
 (1911). This work is=20

based throughout on the sources; its literary quality is above the average =
and it appraises Jackson=20

and his times in an duke heard of a large treasure collected by the late du=
ke and stored at=20

Limoges. Leaving Jeanne at Nantes, he took a small body of knights and went=
 to Limoges, where=20

he was favorably received, and secured the treasure, with which he returned=
 to Nantes in time for=20

the appointed day of homage. But the Breton nobles were not at all inclined=
 to flock to his banner=20

and hail him as rightful duke, only one knight, Herve de Leon, appeared to =
do homage; and though=20

seven out of nine bishops, and the burgesses of Nantes, Limoges, and some o=
ther towns, had=20

declared for Montfort, his position was by no means secure. Nevertheless, h=
e and Jeanne held=20

their little court with what state they could, and determined to use the tr=
easure taken from Limoges=20

to pay for the defence of their duchy, hiring mercenaries, "so that they ha=
d a great number afoot=20

and a-horseback, nobles and other of divers countries." With the aid of the=
se forces,--not always=20

required, for some places were quite ready to receive him as their lord,--M=
ontfort took certain=20

towns and fortresses, such as Brest, Rennes, Hennebon, and Vannes.  Charles=
 de Blois, baffled=20

by the promptness and activity of Montfort and appalled at the rapidity wit=
h which the latter was=20

making himself actual if not rightful Duke of Brittany, appealed to the Kin=
g of France, presenting=20

the claim of his wife, Jeanne de=20

force with which=20

Montfort presented himself before the king did not have the effect of intim=
idating the latter, if it had=20

been so intended, and Montfort moderated his tone in the interview with Phi=

positively that he had sworn fealty to Edward III., and merely urging his r=
ights as nearest of kin to=20

Court of Peers to sit in=20

judgment on the claims of the two heirs, and forbade Montfort to leave Pari=
s during the next fifteen=20

days. Montfort saw, from the reception accorded him by the crafty Philippe,=
 that his case was=20

already judged; "he sat and imagined many doubts"; if he remained in Paris =
and the verdict of the=20

Peers went against him there was the certainty of arrest and imprisonment u=
ntil he should have=20

made an accounting for the treasure seized at Limoges=20
