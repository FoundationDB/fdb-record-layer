Israel," passes immediately to the other side of the dual character, with, =
"These be the names of=20

the mighty men whom David had."  Thus, on the one side, we see the true poe=
tic temperament,=20

with all its capacities for keenest delight and sharpest agony, with its tr=
emulous mobility, its=20

openness to every impression, its gaze of child-like wonder, and eager welc=
ome to whatsoever=20

things are lovely, its simplicity and self-forgetfulness, its yearnings "af=
ter worlds half realized," its=20

hunger for love, its pity, and its tears. He was made to be the inspired po=
et of the religious=20

affections.  And, on the other side, we see the greatest qualities of a mil=
itary leader of the antique=20

type, in which personal daring and a strong arm count for more than strateg=
ic skill. He dashes at=20

Goliath with an enthusiasm of youthful courage and faith. While still in th=
e earliest bloom of his=20

manhood, at the head of his wild band of outlaws, he shows himself sagaciou=
s, full of resource,=20

prudent in counsel, and swift as lightning in act; frank and generous, bold=
 and gentle, cheery in=20

defeat, calm in peril, patient in privations and ready to share them with h=
is men, modest and self-

restrained in victory, chivalrous to his foes, ever watchful, ever hopeful-=
-a born leader and king of=20

men.  The basis of all was a profound, joyous trust in his Shepherd God, an=
 ardour of personal=20

love to Him, such as had never before been expressed, if it had ever found =
place, in Israel. That=20

trust "opened his mouth to show forth" God's praise, and strengthened his "=
fingers to fight." He=20

has told us himself what was his habitual temper, and how it was sustained:=
 "I have set the Lord=20

always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. The=
refore my heart is=20

glad, and my glory rejoiceth." (Psa. xvi. 8, 9.)  Thus endowed, he moved am=
ong men with that=20

irresistible fascination which only the greatest exercise. From the day whe=
n he stole like a=20

sunbeam into the darkened chamber where Saul wrestled with the evil spirit,=
 he bows all hearts=20

that come under his spell. The women of Israel chant his name with song and=
 timbrel, the=20

daughter of Saul confesses her love unasked, the noble soul of Jonathan cle=
aves to him, the rude=20

outlaws in his little army peril their lives to gratify his longing for a d=
raught from the well where he=20

had watered his father's flocks; the priests let him take the consecrated b=
read, and trust him with=20

Goliath's sword, from behind the altar; his lofty courtesy wins the heart o=
f Abigail; the very king of=20

the Philistines tells him that he is "good in his sight as an angel of God;=
" the unhappy Saul's last=20

word to him is a blessing; six hundred men of Gath forsake home and country=
 to follow his=20

fortunes when he returns from exile; and even in the dark close of his reig=
n, though sin and self-

indulgence, and neglect of his kingly duties, had weakened his subjects' lo=
yalty, his flight before=20

Absalom is brightened by instances of passionate devotion which no common c=
haracter could=20

have evoked; and even then his people are ready to die for him, and in thei=
r affectionate pride call=20

him "the light of Israel." It was a prophetic instinct which made Jesse cal=
l his youngest boy by a=20

name apparently before unused--David, "Beloved."  The Spirit of God, acting=
 through these great=20

natural gifts, and using had entirely deserted me. I think this arose from =
the extreme desire I felt=20

that Lady Ursula should not at that moment imagine that I was mad. Perhaps,=
 my reader, it may=20

have happened to you to have to broach the most delicate of all topics to a=
 young lady who=20

regarded you in the light of a rather dangerous lunatic, and you can theref=
ore enter into my=20

feelings. I was not sorry to find myself blushing and stammering, as it mig=
ht have the effect of=20

reassuring her, and making her feel that for the moment at least I was quit=
e harmless.  "I am glad,=20

Lord Frank," she said, observing my confusion, "that you have given me this=
 opportunity of seeing=20

you, as I am sure you would not willingly inflict pain, and should you find=
 that you have=20



unintentionally done so, will make all the reparation in your power."  At t=
his moment I glanced=20

significantly at Broadhem, who left the room.  "Unfortunately it too often =
happens, Lady Ursula," I=20

said, "that it is necessary to inflict a temporary pain to avert what might=
 become a permanent=20

misery."  "I cannot conceive," replied she, "to what permanent misery, as a=
ffecting myself, you can=20

allude, in which your intervention should be necessary, more especially whe=
n exhibited in a form=20

which places me in such a false position. I need not say that the announcem=
ent which I saw for=20

the first time in a newspaper caused me the greatest annoyance; but when I =
found afterwards that=20

my mother, my brother, and even Lord Grandon, had heard it from your own li=
ps many weeks=20

before, and that in fact you had given my mother, under a promise that she =
would not allude to the=20

subject to me, such a totally erroneous idea of what passed at our intervie=
w at Dickiefield,--when I=20

thought of all this, I could only account for it by the last revelation you=
 made to me there."  She=20

maintained her self-possession perfectly until she was obliged to allude to=
 my insanity, then she=20

dropped her eyelids, and the colour for the first time rushed into her chee=
ks as she shrank from=20

touching on this delicate subject. At the moment I almost felt inclined to =
tell her that I was as sane=20

as she was, but refrained, partly because I was not sure of it myself, part=
ly because I did not think=20

she would believe me, partly because, after all, it might be the best justi=
fication I could offer for my=20

conduct, and partly because I was not quite ready to enter upon an explanat=
ion of the ruse by=20

which I had hoped to save her from the persecution of her mother to marry C=
hundango. This=20

suddenly reminded me of my idea that she was in the position of one drownin=
g. I therefore said, in=20

a careless way, for the purpose of showing her that her allusion to my insa=
nity had produced no=20

unfavourable impression upon me,----  "Lady Ursula, would you have any obje=
ction to regarding=20

me in the light of a straw?"  "A what!" said Lady Ursula, in a tone in whic=
h amazement seemed=20

blended with alarm.  "A straw," I repeated; "I assure you you are drowning,=
 and even an unworthy=20

being like myself may be of use to you, if you would but believe it. Rememb=
er Chundango's=20

conduct at Dickiefield--remember the view Lady Broadhem took of it, until I=
 interposed, or as I=20

should more accurately say, until the current swept me past her--remember t=
hat up to this moment=20

she has never recurred to the subject of Mr Chundango, who, although he=20


_
inspiration. The Law was the revelation of the mind, and, in some measure, =
of the heart, of God to=20

man. The Psalm is the echo of the law, the return current set in motion by =
the outflow of the Divine=20

will, the response of the heart of man to the manifested God. There had, in=
deed, been traces of=20

hymns before David. There were the burst of triumph which the daughters of =
Israel sang, with=20

timbrel and dance, over Pharaoh and his host; the prayer of Moses the man o=
f God (Psa. xc.), so=20

archaic in its tone, bearing in every line the impress of the weary wildern=
ess and the law of death;=20

the song of the dying lawgiver (Deut. xxxii.); the passionate paean of Debo=
rah; and some few=20

briefer fragments. But, practically, the Psalm began with David; and though=
 many hands struck the=20

harp after him, even down at least to the return from exile, he remains emp=
hatically "the sweet=20

psalmist of Israel."  The psalms which are attributed to to Lady Broadhem h=
erself; and, allow me to=20

say it, you owe it all to a timely straw."  Lady Ursula seemed struck by th=
e graphic way in which I=20

put her position before her, and remained silent for a few moments. It had =
evidently never=20

occurred to her, that I had indirectly been the means of securing her tranq=
uillity. She little thought it=20

possible that her mother could have talked her matrimonial prospects over w=
ith a comparative=20

stranger in the mercantile terms which Lady Broadhem had used in our interv=
iew at Dickiefield.=20

And I am well aware that society generally would consider such conduct on t=
he part of her=20

ladyship coarse and unladylike. It showed a disregard of _les convenances_ =
which good society is=20

the first to resent. Those who have never secretly harboured the designs wh=
ich Lady Broadhem in=20

the agony of a financial crisis avowed, might justly repudiate her conduct;=
 but "conscience does=20

make cowards of us all,"=20


_
similarity of manner. Their characteristics have been well summed up as "cr=
eative originality,=20

predominantly elegiac tone, graceful form and movement, antique but lucid s=
tyle;"[A] to which may=20

be added the intensity of their devotion, the passion of Divine love that g=
lows in them all. They=20

correspond, too, with the circumstances of his life as given in the histori=
cal books. The early=20

fashionable mothers will naturally be the first to censure in Lady Broadhem=
 a practice to which, in=20

a less glaring and obnoxious form, they are so strongly addicted. If in sil=
very accents she had=20

confided her projects to Lady Mundane, the world would have considered it n=
atural and ladylike=20

enough; the coarseness consisted in her telling them to me. O generation of=
 slave-owners! why=20

persist=20
