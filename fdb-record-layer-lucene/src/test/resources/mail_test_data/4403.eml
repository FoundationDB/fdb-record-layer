had no field pieces to use abroad, and our artillery was equipped with the French .75. A few naval 

guns were landed and mounted toward the termination of hostilities. The aeroplane scandal is 

known of all men. And it was a year after we declared war before we entered Europe in force, and 

equipped then with English rifles and French field guns; and our men were transported to Europe 

mainly on British ships.  But in this trying period several things stand out clear and bright, and as 

inspirations for the future. Two are psychological: the spirit of Americans of alien descent, and the 

participation of our great educational institutions; one, official as well as psychological, the 

selective service draft. The patriotism of the native American of the old stock goes, of course, 

without saying.  The true ring of our heterogeneous population of foreign extraction was to many a 

joyful surprise. That so many who had never seemed to amalgamate with our customs, were 

largely uneducated, and did not even speak our language, should respond so willingly and gladly 

to the call to the colors, was a source of some amazement. Not being in their confidence or 

intimacy, many of us little realized their loyalty: which reminds me of an Italian bootblack who in 

conversation told me that he wished to travel. I spoke of the beauties of Naples and Sorrento and 

that neighborhood, and was rather abashed when he said: "Yes, but I would rather see my own 

country first." I hope that lesson will always be fresh in memory.  The same spirit of Americanism 

marked all nationalities, not excepting the German. The lists of draft registrants from, let us say, 

the east side of Manhattan Borough, reminded one of the Epistle for Whitsunday: "Parthians, and 

Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Juda, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, 

and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Jews and 

proselytes, Cretes and Arabians," all heard, and, with the deep realization of newly liberated 

peoples, showed themselves proud to answer the call.  A recent war or Liberty loan poster is most 

suggestive. You read on it a list of men's names, mostly unpronounceable, and suggestive, in the 

language of the same Scripture just quoted, "of every nation under heaven," and this is summed 

up in the phrase, "Americans all." Truly, a fitting tribute to our adopted citizenry, equal in loyalty, 

bravery, and self-sacrifice to the best of the old Americans. Among them, as just noted, the 

German names stand out boldly. They are so numerous, in fact, as to attract less notice in this 

country than they deserve; let us hope that they will be noticed and taken to heart in the misguided 

country where such names originated. I would that our American army, made up in large part of 

such men, could occupy Germany for a time as it formally occupied Cuba, for its own good, and 

give a much needed object lesson in the theory and practice of free institutions.  These men, as I 

have said, were largely uneducated. I turn now for a Herbs, according to your Taste; some strong 

Gravey, and some Wine, and thicken the Sauce, taking out the bunch of sweet Herbs. You may 

put then some Juice of Limes to them, or Chadocks or Lemons, to make them fine. _N.B._ This is 

a dainty Dish, if they are broil'd, after the first stewing, because as they are sinewey, the Sinews 

ought to be a little scorched by broiling, or else they will not be so tender as one would have them. 

There are two Sorts of Tortoises, the Land, and the Sea-Tortoise; but the Sea-Tortoise or Turtle, is 

what I mean, which is that which we have about the _West-Indies_. This is a fine Animal, 

partaking of the Land and Water. Its Flesh between that of Veal, and that of a Lobster, and is 

extremely pleasant, either roasted or baked. There are some of these Creatures that weigh near 

two hundred Weight. They are frequently brought to _England_ in Tubs of Sea Water, and will 

keep alive a long time.    To roast a Piece of _Turtle,_ or _Tortoise._ From the same.  Take a 



piece of the Flesh of about five or six Pounds, and lay it in Salt and Water two Hours; then stick a 

few Cloves in it, and fasten it to the Spit, baste it at first with Wine and Lemon-Juice; and when it is 

near enough, drudge some Flour over it, with the raspings of Bread sifted; and then baste it well, 

either with Oil, or Butter, strewing on, from time to time, more Flour and Raspings till it is enough; 

then take the Liquor in the Pan, and pouring off the Fat, boil it with some Lemon-Peel, and a little 

Sugar and Salt, and pour it over the Turtle. So serve it hot.    To make a _Turtle,_ or _Tortoise-

_Pye. From the same.  Cut the Flesh of Turtle, or Tortoise, into Slices, about an Inch thick; then 

take Cloves beaten fine, with some Pepper and Salt, and a little sweet Herbs, and season your 

Pieces with them; then lay them in your Crust, with some Lemons sliced, and a quarter of a Pint of 

Oil-Olive pour'd over them, Or else some Butter laid in bits upon them. In the cutting your Pieces, 

distribute your Fat and Lean, equally as may be; and though the Fat is of a greenish colour, it is 

yet very delicious: then close your Pye, and just before you put it in the Oven, pour in some White 

Wine, and bake it in a gentle Oven till it is tender. Then serve it hot.    To preserve _Ginger-

Roots._ From the same.  Take Roots of Ginger, as we have them dry in _England_; wash them 

well, and lay one Pound of them to steep, ten or twelve Days, in White Wine and Water, stirring 

them every Day. Then take two Quarts of White Wine, and about half a Pint of Lemon-Juice, and 

boil them together a quarter of an Hour; then add two Pounds and a half of fine Sugar, and boil it 

to a Syrup, taking off the Scum as it rises; then put in your Ginger, and boil it a quarter of an Hour; 

then let it cool in a glazed Pan till the next Day, and then boil it again in the Syrup for half an Hour, 

and let it cool, as before, till the Day following, and repeat the boiling and cooling till your Ginger is 

clear, and put it into your Glasses, and cover them with

faculties and trustees of those institutions. Their stand was doubtless one to be expected, but is 

still worthy of remark. That the best blood in England suffered the most losses I think is conceded. 

That would have been the case with us if the war had broken on us as it did on Great Britain. As it 

was, our boys courted the posts of danger--aviation; submarine chasers; balloon observation, and 

so on. Some left college to enter the service; others stayed at college awhile, but in order to train 

and perfect themselves in the art of war. The colleges themselves became military schools; the 

dormitories barracks. For a short time some anxious mothers held back, and it is little wonder that 

they did. But it was not for long, and soon the woman who could wear a pin, with one, two, or more 

stars in it on her bosom, gloried in it, while she who wore a star of gold, in all her grief still 

cherished the solemn pride, as Lincoln called it, of having laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar 

of her country. Whether the son was a student or ploughboy, a bootblack or factory hand, or the 

son of a millionaire, the feeling was the same. In fact, there was a tendency at first    To preserve 

_Ginger-Roots,_ fresh taken out of the Ground. From the same.  As Ginger is very common in the 

_West-Indies_, so the Roots are either preserved or pickled, when they are fresh taken out of the 

Ground, and we have now Ginger, growing in Pots, almost in every Garden where there is a 

Stove; and in a Year's time a single Root will almost fill a Pot; so that one might easily have 

enough of our own, to preserve every Year. We must take them up, when they have no Leaves 

upon them; and then scald them in Water, and rub them with a coarse Cloth till they are dry; then 

put them into White Wine and Water, and boil them half an. Hour; then let them cool, and boil 

them again half an Hour. Then make a Syrup with White Wine two Quarts, half a Pint of Lime or 

Lemon-Juice, and two Pounds and a half of fine Sugar, with two Ounces of the Leaves of Orange-

Flowers. When these boil together, put in your Ginger, and boil it gently half an Hour; then let it 

cool in an earthen glaz'd Vessel, and continue to boil it every Day, and cooling it till the Roots of 

your Ginger are clear. Then put it up in Gallypots, or in Glasses, and cover them with Papers, to 

keep for use. 


_
suspect the well-to-do and moneyed classes of holding back their sons. This soon wore off; and 

one of the most inspiring as well as instructive sights I ever saw was on this very island; the 

parade of war mothers on the Bar Harbor fair grounds; women in all walks of life, some with gold 

stars on their badges.  College presidents who encouraged the entry of students into military 

service came To make Paste of _Pippins,_ or other fine Apples. From the same.  Take large 

Golden-Pippins, or Golden-Rennets, and scald them, with their Skins on; then pare them, and take 

out the Cores, and beat them in a Marble Mortar very well, with a little Lemon-Peel grated. Take 

then their weight of fine Sugar, and a little Water, and boil that in a Skillet to a candy height; then 

put in your Apples,
