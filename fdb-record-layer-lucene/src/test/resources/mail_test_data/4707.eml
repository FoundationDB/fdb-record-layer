intervals they lay single stones which run through the entire thickness of the wall. These stones, 

which show at each end, are called [Greek: diatonoi], and by their bonding powers they add very 

greatly to the solidity of the walls.  [Illustration: Photo. Moscioni  OPUS RETICULATUM FROM

AT TIVOLI]  8. One who in accordance with these notes will take pains in selecting his method of 

construction, may count upon having something that will last. No walls made of rubble and finished 

with delicate beauty--no such walls can escape ruin as time goes on. Hence, when arbitrators are 

chosen to set a valuation on party walls, they do not value them at what they cost to build, but look 

up the written contract in each case and then, after deducting from the cost one eightieth for each 

year that the wall has been standing, decide that the remainder is the sum to be paid. They thus in 

effect pronounce that such walls cannot last more than eighty years.  9. In the case of brick arms 

round my waist and laid on my breast his big soft head, with the hair combed down on the 

forehead like a Little Russian's, and went off into a thin, aged laugh.  "And you go on getting 

younger," he said through his laugh. "I wonder what dye you use for your hair and beard; you 

might let me have some of it." Sniffing and gasping, he embraced me and kissed me on the cheek. 

"You might give me some of it," he repeated. "Why, you are not forty, are you?"  "Alas, I am forty-

six!" I said, laughing.  Ivan Ivanitch smelt of tallow candles and cooking, and that suited him. His 

big, puffy, slow-moving body was swathed in a long frock-coat like a coachman's full coat, with a 

high waist, and with hooks and eyes instead of buttons, and it would have been strange if he had 

smelt of eau-de-Cologne, for instance. In his long, unshaven, bluish double chin, which looked like 

a thistle, his goggle eyes, his shortness of breath, and in the whole of his clumsy, slovenly figure, 

in his voice, his laugh, and his words, it was difficult to recognize the graceful, interesting talker 

who used in old days to make the husbands of the district 


_
that they are still standing plumb, but they are always valued at what they cost to build. Hence in 

some states we may see public buildings and private houses, as well as those of kings, built of 

brick: in Athens, for example, the part of the wall which faces Mt. Hymettus and Pentelicus; at 

Patras, the cellae of the temple of Jupiter and Hercules, which are brick, although on the outside 

the entablature and columns of the temple are of stone; in Italy, at Arezzo, an ancient wall 

excellently built; at Tralles, the house built for the kings of the dynasty of Attalus, which is now 

always granted to the man who holds the state priesthood. In Sparta, paintings have been taken 

out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, then have been placed in wooden frames, and so 

brought to the Comitium to adorn the aedileship of Varro and Murena.  10. Then there is the house 

of Croesus which the people of Sardis have set apart as a place of repose for their fellow-citizens 

in the retirement of age,--a "Gerousia" for the guild of the elder men. At Halicarnassus, the house 

of that most potent king Mausolus, though decorated throughout with Proconnesian marble, has 

walls built of brick which are to this day of extraordinary strength, and are covered with stucco so 

highly polished that they seem to be as glistening as glass. That king did not use brick from 

poverty; for he was choke-full of revenues, being ruler of all Caria.  11. As for his skill and 

ingenuity as a builder, they may be seen from what follows. He was born at Melassa, but 

recognizing the natural advantages of Halicarnassus as a fortress, and seeing that it was suitable 

as a  "I am in great need of your assistance, my friend," I said, when we were sitting in the dining-

room, drinking tea. "I want to organize relief for the starving peasants, and I don't know how to set 

about it. So perhaps you will be so kind as to advise me."  "Yes, yes, yes," said Ivan Ivanitch, 

sighing. "To be sure, to be sure, to be sure...."  "I would not have worried you, my dear fellow, but 

really there is no one here but you I can appeal to. You know what people are like about here." 

"To be sure, to be sure, to be sure.... Yes."  I thought that as we were going to have a serious, 

business consultation in which any one might take part, regardless of their position or personal 

relations, why should I not invite Natalya Gavrilovna.  "_Tres faciunt collegium_," I said gaily. 

"What if we were to ask Natalya Gavrilovna? What do you think? Fenya," I said, turning to the 

maid, "ask Natalya Gavrilovna to come upstairs to us, if possible at once. Tell her it's a very 

important matter."  A little later Natalya Gavrilovna came in. I got up to meet her and said: 

"Excuse us for troubling you, Natalie. We are discussing a very important matter, and we had the 

happy thought that we might take advantage of your good advice, which you will not refuse to give 

us. Please sit down."  Ivan Ivanitch kissed her hand while she kissed his forehead; then, when we 

all sat down to the table, he, looking at her tearfully and blissfully, craned forward to her and 

kissed her hand again. She was dressed in black, her hair was carefully arranged, and she smelt 

of fresh scent. She had evidently dressed to go out or was expecting somebody. Coming into the

his residence there. The place had a curvature like that of the seats in a theatre. On the lowest 

tier, along the harbour, was built the forum. About halfway up the curving slope, at the point where 

the curved cross-aisle is in a theatre, a broad wide street was laid out, in the middle of which was 

built the Mausoleum, a work so remarkable that it is classed among the Seven Wonders of the 

World. At the top of the hill, in the centre, is the fane of Mars, containing a colossal acrolithic 

statue by the famous hand of Leochares. That is, some think that this statue is by Leochares, 

others by Timotheus. At the extreme right of the summit is the fane of Venus and Mercury, close to 

the spring of Salmacis.  12. There is a mistaken idea that this spring infects those who drink of it 

with an unnatural lewdness. It will not be out of simple friendliness, and smiled to me as graciously 

as she did to Ivan Ivanitch--that pleased me; but as she talked she moved her fingers, often and 

abruptly leaned back in her chair and talked rapidly, and this jerkiness in her words and 

movements irritated me and reminded me of her native town--Odessa, where the society, men and 

women alike, had wearied me by its bad taste.  "I want to do something for the famine-stricken 

peasants," I began, and after a brief pause I went on: "Money, of course, is a great thing, but to 

confine oneself to subscribing money, and with that to be satisfied, would be evading the worst of 

the trouble. Help must take the form of money, but the most important thing is a proper and sound 

organization. Let us think it over, my friends, and do something."  Natalya Gavrilovna looked at me 

inquiringly 


_
how this idea came to spread throughout the world from a mistake in the telling of the tale. It 

cannot be that the water makes men effeminate and unchaste, as it is said to do; for the spring is 

of remarkable clearness and excellent in flavour. The fact is that when Melas and Arevanias came 

there from Argos and Troezen and founded a colony together, they drove out the Carians and 

Lelegans who were barbarians. These took refuge in the mountains, and, uniting there, used to 

make raids, plundering the Greeks and laying their country waste in a cruel manner. Later, one of 

the colonists, to make money, set up a well-stocked shop, near the spring because the water was 

so good, and the way in which he carried it on attracted the barbarians. So they began to come 

down, one at a time, and to meet with society, and thus they were brought back of their own 

accord, giving up their rough and savage ways for the delights of Greek customs. Hence this water 

acquired its peculiar reputation, not because it really induced unchastity, but because those 

barbarians were softened by the charm of civilization.  [Illustration: THE MAUSOLEUM AT 

HALICARNASSUS AS RESTORED BY FRIEDRICH ADLER]  13. But since I as though to say, 

"What do I know about it?"  "Yes, yes, famine..." muttered Ivan Ivanitch. "Certainly... yes."  "It's a 

serious position," I said, "and assistance is needed as soon as possible. I imagine the first point 

among the principles which we must work out ought to be promptitude. We must act on the military 

principles of judgment, promptitude, and energy."  "Yes, promptitude..." repeated Ivan Ivanitch in a 

drowsy and listless voice, as though he were dropping asleep. "Only one can't do anything. The 

crops have failed, and so what's the use of all your judgment and energy?... It's the elements.... 

You can't go against God and fate."  "Yes, but that's what man has a head for, to contend against 

the elements."  "Eh? Yes... that's so, to be sure.... Yes."  Ivan Ivanitch sneezed into his 

handkerchief, brightened up, and as though he had just woken up, looked round at my wife and 

me.  "My crops have failed, too." He laughed a thin little laugh and gave a sly wink as though this 

were really funny. "No money, no corn, and a yard full of labourers like Count Sheremetyev's. I 

want to kick them out, but I haven't the heart to."  Natalya Gavrilovna laughed, and began 

questioning him 


_
fortified place, it remains to finish my account of it. Corresponding to the fane of Venus and the 

spring described above, which are on the right, we have on the extreme left the royal palace which 

king Mausolus built there in accordance with a plan all his own. To the right it commands a view of 

the forum, the harbour, affairs. Her presence gave me a pleasure such as I had not felt for a long 

time, and I was afraid to look at her for fear my eyes would betray my secret feeling. Our relations 

were such that that feeling might seem surprising and ridiculous.  She laughed and talked with 

Ivan Ivanitch without being in the least disturbed 


_
fortifications, while just below it, to the left, there is a concealed harbour, hidden under the walls in 

such a way that nobody could see or know what was going on in it. Only the king himself could, in 

case of need, give orders from his own palace to the oarsmen and soldiers, without the knowledge 

of anybody else.  14. After the death of Mausolus,  "And so, my friends, what are we to do?" I 

asked after waiting for a pause. "I suppose before we do anything else we had better immediately 

open a subscription-list. We will write to our friends in the capitals and in Odessa, Natalie, and ask 

them to subscribe. When we have got together a little sum we will begin buying corn and fodder 

for the
