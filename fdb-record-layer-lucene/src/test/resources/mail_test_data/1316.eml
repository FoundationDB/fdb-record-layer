ill, frantic dismay pervaded the servants' quarters. As her last moments dr=
ew near, Mrs. Pinckney=20

called the weeping Hannah to her bedside and laid a bag of money in her han=
d.  "To get you and=20

the children back to old Virginia," she whispered with her last breath.  Wh=
en the beloved "Missus"=20

was laid to rest by the side of her husband in the Catholic cemetery, the b=
ewildered Hannah took=20

the money to a white man, an old friend of the family, and asked him to buy=
 the tickets back to=20

Virginia. He advised against it; said that the old home would not be there =
to comfort them. Houses=20

had been burned, trees cut down and old landmarks destroyed. He suggested t=
hat they take the=20

hundred dollars in gold and buy a little home in Key West, which they did. =
 Reconstruction days=20

were as trying to Key Westers as to others all over the devastated land of =
Dixie. Slave owners,=20

stripped of their possessions, taxed with an immense war debt and with no m=
oney or equipment to=20

begin the slow climb back to normalcy were pathetic figures as they blister=
ed their hands at toil=20

that they had never known before. Many of the slaves were more than willing=
 to stay with their=20

former masters, but with no income, the problem of feeding themselves was t=
he main issue with=20

the whites, so it was out of the question to try to fill other mouths, and =
ex-slaves often had to shift=20

for strong commercial cities ruled by artisans oppressed their weaker neigh=
bours of the same=20

class. No one agency has done so much to raise the condition of the working=
man as machinery;=20

yet the workingman resisted the introduction of machinery, rose against it,=
 destroyed it, maltreated=20

its inventors. There is a perpetual warning in the name of Hargreaves, the =
workingman who, by his=20

inventive genius, provided employment for millions of his fellows, and was =
by them rewarded with=20

outrage and persecution.  Flushed with confidence at the sight of their ser=
ried phalanxes and=20

extending lines, the unionists do like most people invested with unwonted p=
ower; they aim at more=20

than is possible or just. They fancy that they can put the screw on the com=
munity, almost without=20

limit. But they will soon find out their mistake. They will learn it from t=
hose very things which are=20

filling the world with alarm--the extension of unionism, and the multiplica=
tion of strikes. The builder=20

strikes against the rest of the community, including the baker, then the ba=
ker strikes against the=20

builder and the collier strikes against them both. At first the associated =
trades seem to have it all=20

their own way. But the other trades learn the secret of association. Everyb=
ody strikes against=20

everybody else, the price of all articles rises as much as anybody's wages,=
 and thus when the=20

wheel=20


_
hopeless task for a race that had never been called upon to exert initiativ=
e.  Hannah Taylor and=20

her numerous offspring were a fair example of these irresponsible people. L=
ike a ship adrift=20

without skipper or rudder, they were at the mercy of every adverse wind of =
misfortune. Each=20

morning they went out with frantic energy to earn or in some way procure su=
stenance for one=20

more day. Young Dave hounded the sponge fishermen until they gave him an ex=
tra job. He made=20

the rounds of the fishing docks, continually on the lookout to be of help, =
anxious to do anything at=20

any time in exchange for a few articles of food that he could carry proudly=
 home to his mother.=20

"Dem was mighty tryin' times," mused the old man, "an' I don't blame my mam=
my fer warmin' my=20

pants when she had so much to worry 'bout. She had a way o' grabbin' me by =

 scairt o' dese=20

bout dat.  "One day my=20

mammy gimme fifteen cents an' say 'Go down to de market and fetch me some f=

p. 'You see dat spit,'=20

she say. 'Ef hit be dry w'en you git back, I gonna beat de meat offen yo' b=
ones. Git goin', now.'=20

"Well, I stahted, an I she' wasn't losin' no time. 'Bout hahf way to de mah=

an' a tough-lookin' Chink motion fer us to foller him. We go down a dark st=
reet an' turn thoo an=20

alley, then into a big room lighted with colored paper lanterns. On de flo'=
 we see some folks=20

ee de sights, but=20

nevah hear one mo' word o' English; so ahftah a time we go back to de ship =
gainer. In fact long=20

before the wheel has come full circle the futility of a universal strike wi=
ll be manifest to all. The=20

world sees before it a terrible future of unionism ever increasing in power=
 and tyranny, but it is=20

more likely that in a few years unionism as an instrument for forcing up wa=
ges will have ceased to=20

exist. In the meantime the working classes will have impressed upon themsel=
ves by a practical=20

experiment upon the grandest scale and of the most decisive kind the fact t=
hat they are=20

consumers as well as producers, payers of wages as well as receivers of wag=
es, members of a=20

community as well as workingmen.  The unionists will learn also after a few=
 trials that the=20

community cannot easily be cornered, at least that it cannot easily be corn=
ered more than once by=20

unions any more than by gold rings at New York or pork rings at Chicago. It=
 may apparently=20

succumb once being unable to do without its bread or its newspapers or to s=
top buildings already=20

contracted for and commenced, but it instinctively prepares to defend itsel=
f against a repetition of=20

the operation. It limits consumption or invents new modes of production, im=
proves machinery,=20

encourages non union men, calls in foreigners, women, Chinese. In the end t=
he corner results in=20

loss. Cornering on the part of workingmen is not a bit worse than cornering=
 on the part of great=20

financiers; in both cases alike it is as odious as anything can be, which i=
s not actually criminal; but=20

depend upon it a bad time is coming for corners of all kinds.  I speak of t=
he community as the=20

power with which the strikers really have to deal. The master hires or orga=
nizes the workmen, but=20

the community purchases their work; and though the master when hard pressed=
 may in his=20

desperation give more for the work than it is worth rather than at once tak=
e his capital out of the=20

trade the community will let the trade go to ruin without compunction rathe=
r than give more for the=20

article than it can afford. Some of the colliers in England, we are informe=
d, have called upon the=20

masters to reduce the price of coal, offering at the same time to consent t=
o a reduction of their own=20

wages. A great fact has dawned upon their minds. Note too that democratic c=
ommunities have=20

more power of resistance to unionist extortion than others, because they ar=
e more united, have a=20

keener sense of mutual interest, and are free from political fear. The way =
in which Boston, some=20

years ago, turned to and beat a printers' strike, was a remarkable proof of=
 this fact.  Combination=20

may enable, and, as I believe, has enabled the men in particular cases to m=
ake a fairer bargain=20

with the masters, and to get the full market value of their labour, but nei=
ther combination nor any=20

other mode of negotiating can raise the value of labour or of any other art=
icle to the consumer, and=20

that which cannot raise the value cannot permanently raise the price.  All =
now admit that strikes=20

peaceably conducted are lawful. Nevertheless, they may sometimes be anti-so=
cial and immoral.=20

Does any one doubt it? Suppose by an accident to machinery, or the falling =
in of a mine, a number=20

of workmen have their limbs broken. One of their mates runs for the surgeon=
, and the surgeon=20

puts his head out of the window and says-- "the surgeons are on strike." Do=
es this case much=20

differ from that of the man who, in his greed, stops the wheel of industry =
which he is turning,=20

thereby paralysing the whole machine, and spreading not only confusion, but=
 suffering, and=20



perhaps starvation among multitudes of his fellows? Language was held by so=
me unionist=20

witnesses, before the Trades Union Commission, about their exclusive regard=
 for their own=20

interests, and their indifference to the interests of society, which was mo=
re frank than=20

philanthropic, and more gratifying to their enemies than to their friends. =
A man who does not care=20

for the interests of society will find, to his cost, that they are his own,=
 and that he is a member of a=20

body which cannot be dismembered. I spoke of the industrial objects of the =
International as=20

chimerical. They are worse than chimerical. In its industrial aspect, the I=
nternational was an=20

attempt to separate the interests of a particular class of workers througho=
ut the world from those=20

of their fellow workers, and to divide humanity against itself. Such attemp=
ts can end only in one=20

way.  There are some who say, in connection with this question, that you ar=
e at liberty to extort=20

anything you can from your fellow men, provided you do not use a pistol; th=
at you are at liberty to=20

fleece the sailor who implores you to save him from a wreck, or the emigran=
t who is in danger of=20

missing his ship. I say that this is=20


_
"Nex' we sails fo' Panama. W'en we ties up dere, Jack an' me goes ashore. A=

n was a fightin' fool.=20

Weighed only 90 pounds, but strong an' wiry. Co'se he man would say so hims=
elf if the same thing=20

were done to him.  A strike is a war, so is a lock out, which is a strike o=
n the other side. They are=20

warrantable, like other wars, when justice cannot be obtained, or injustice=
 prevented by peaceful=20

means, and in such cases only. Mediation ought always to be tried first and=
 it will often be=20

effectual, for the wars of carpenters and builders, as well as the wars of =
emperors, often arise from=20

commonly personal or local, and does not affect the central government of a=
 union extending over=20

a whole nation. The governments of great unions have seldom recommended str=
ikes. A strike or=20
