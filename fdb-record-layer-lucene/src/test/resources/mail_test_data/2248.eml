their considerable population, and the fertility of their soil--which is ca=
pable of yielding all the=20

products which are grown between the two tropics--require from his Majesty'=
s paternal=20

government a carefully planned system of measures which shall strengthen th=
eir peace and=20

internal security, and at the same time advance their agriculture, industry=
, and commerce to that=20

high degree to which they have been destined by Providence.  As I am charge=
d by order of the=20

king our sovereign to furnish information regarding the measures which can =
contribute to objects=20

so important, it will be my plan to point out (but with that circumspection=
 which is so necessary in=20

matters of colonial policy and administration) the causes which today are a=
ntagonizing both the=20

internal and external security of those islands and their successful admini=
stration--civil, economic,=20

and commercial--proposing in regard to each one of these the correctives wh=
ich have been=20

impressed upon me by my experience as consulting attorney [asesor] and judg=
e in all the public=20

affairs of justice, army and navy, the government, revenues, and commerce; =
and my own=20

observations under popular revolutions, changes in the system of government=
, and other=20

vicissitudes and critical positions in which that colony has been seen duri=
ng the long period of my=20

residence therein.     OF THE CAUSES WHICH ANTAGONIZE THE INTERNAL SECURITY=
 OF=20

THE FILIPINAS ISLANDS, AND OF CORRECTIVES FOR THEM   Of the present composi=
tion of=20

the divisions of the army  The army of the Filipinas Islands, in view of th=
e class of men of whom it=20

now consists, offers very little (if any) moral confidence for their resist=
ing the force of the  The=20

character of the motion is well known. Each point of the surface begins to =
move with the vibration=20

first upwards, then away from the center of shock, then downward and backwa=
rds. Thus, each=20

point describes a small ellipse, which is repeated with each wave of vibrat=
ion. If the longer axis of=20

the ellipse be vertical, the main force of the concussion is directed upwar=
ds; if the shorter one be=20

upright, the shock is an undulatory one. An alternation of the two forms th=
e most destructive=20

combination. The difference is readily perceived in the effects produced. A=
 sudden upward shock=20

may wreck the roofs or floors of buildings, while an undulatory one brings =
down the walls.  Houses=20

erected on sand, immediately overlaying compact rock, usually suffer most d=
uring earthquakes.=20

The effect is that of the vibration of a sheet of glass covered with sand. =
But, if a second sheet of=20

glass be placed on that, the vibration is hardly communicated to it at all.=
 So, while sand is a bad=20

foundation, a sand-bed beneath the surface seems to deaden the shock.  It i=
s not difficult to=20

understand that lofty buildings, and those of stone or brick, must be vastl=
y more dangerous than=20

those of wood, and low and broad. Throughout many portions of Central and S=
outh America, the=20

people endeavor to compromise, by building houses of stone, but low and mas=
sive, with very light=20

roofs. These are far less safe than light structures of wood; also, it is c=
lear that cupolas and towers=20

must be peculiarly liable to injury. For this reason, churches have often s=
uffered more from shocks=20

than other buildings, and the throngs of penitents who flock to them in the=
 hope of propitiating an=20

offended=20


_
in the very bosom of the islands. It is officered, in great part, by Spania=
rds of the country, and by=20

some Americans and mestizos; and the disposition, tendencies, and education=
 of the latter class=20

are (with very rare exceptions) absolutely different from those of the othe=
r and European  =E2=80=9CIt is to=20

earthquakes, rather than to barbarians, from the fifth to the ninth century=
, that Rome owed the loss=20

of so many superb palaces and temples. One might imagine that in these grea=
t disasters, the=20

architect is the ally of the subterranean scourge. The Indian=E2=80=99s hut=
 and the Arab=E2=80=99s=20


_
classes, from the outset, a certain insuperable disunion of feeling, betwee=
n not only individuals but=20

the two classes. The officer who is a native of the country has all the lax=
 characteristics which the=20

climate induces. He lives in exclusive intercourse with his neighbors, and =
separated from the=20

Europeans. He likes the military career solely for the conveniences connect=
ed with his office; he is=20

incapable of a noble emulation, and limits himself in the service to the ou=
tside and very inexact=20

fulfilment of the necessary obligations of his position; and when the cause=
 of the legitimate=20

government exacts on his part sacrifices incompatible with his own interest=
s or those of his=20

neighbors, he disowns and absolutely abandons his duties. For these reasons=
 the officers born in=20

that country have never come to merit the confidence of their chiefs; and i=
f from the rank of cadets=20

they have been promoted to that of captain, it has been more from the perem=
ptory necessity of=20

completing the military corps and protecting the service than on account of=
 their fitness, military=20

spirit, or appreciation of the confidence and honor which the king bestows =
on them. Such=20

sentiments they can never possess until they undergo a rigid training moral=
 and political, in the=20

colleges of Espaa. This mental divergence, and the natural contrariety of t=
heir temperaments, so=20

mischievous in the ordinary service of military bodies, are much more lamen=
table in the crisis of a=20

revolution. The officers of the country, being nearer to the Indian soldier=
s in their customs and=20

owners; but the marble of the patrician crushes him as it falls, and the in=
habitants of a great city=20

meet their death under the ruins of their sumptuous buildings. The Peruvian=
s of old were not far=20

wrong in making merry at the folly of their Spanish conquerors, who, in ere=
cting great buildings=20

upon a soil so constantly agitated, were preparing, at great expense, their=
 own tombs.=E2=80=9D  It will be=20

shown, by and by, how the motions of earthquakes are becoming so carefully =
noted that their path=20

can be pointed out beforehand. Ere many years are past, the prediction of e=
arthquakes may=20

become as important a feature of the Signal Service Department, as the fore=
telling of storms.=20

CHAPTER XXIV.  EUROPEAN EARTHQUAKES.      =E2=80=9CThe thunder roared his s=
ignal to the sea,=20

While shook the frightened earth through all her coasts,      And mountains=
 bowed their trembling=20

heads in awe,      And yawning gulfs leaped up amid the plains.      The fo=
untains of the mighty=20

deep were rent,      The waves, long prisoned in their rocky bounds,      R=
oared, in a strange new=20

freedom rushing forth,      And sprang on forest, plain, and mount, and hil=
l, and vale,      Exulting in=20

destruction; while the frightened hordes      Of men, with birds and beasts=
 of every sort,      Fought=20

each with each for refuge from the flood,              Yet none escaped.=E2=
=80=9D   Records and myths of great=20

earthquakes go back almost to prehistoric times. The Greeks tell of an imme=
nse flood--perhaps a=20

sea wave--which overwhelmed Attica immediately after an earthquake in the n=
ineteenth=20


_
them into their own faction, with a marvelous readiness; this I have repeat=
edly seen in the mutinies=20

of military bodies which have occurred in the Americas, and especially in t=
hat of the troops in the=20

kingdom of Guadalajara in the year '21, and in that at Manila in the year '=
23.  The army of Filipinas=20

also contains a considerable number of Indian sergeants and corporals, and =
this is another of the=20

causes from which have already arisen, and always will arise, seditions in =
the corps. Whoever has=20

observed the natural disposition of the Filipino Indian will recognize two =
things: First, that he=20

always imitates and obeys only that which is directly commanded, explained,=
 and taught to him;=20

and, second, that while he is kept in his simple condition of laborer, arti=
san, or soldier he is entirely=20

void of ambition. The Indian soldier serves very contentedly during the eig=
ht years of his term, and=20

returns to his own land without aspiring to anything; but when he is placed=
 in command, of any=20

degree whatever, he is filled with pride, and vehemently desires to be at t=
he head [serlo todo],=20

without changing, for all that, his station as an Indian. [The writer state=
s that even these non-

commissioned officers were formerly always Spaniards; [141]] the appointmen=
t of Indians to these=20

posts has been only in these last years, in which a system of commerce whic=
h entirely separated=20

those islands from their center of government has rendered impossible the d=
espatch of=20

renforcements, so necessary to those islands. From that very time may be no=
ted much laxity in the=20

military service and discipline; and I have witnessed the insurrections and=
 disorders which never=20

were known in former days. In the popular uprisings in the suburbs of Manil=
a, at the end of name=20

of the reigning king. Some three centuries later is the story of a great ea=
rthquake and flood in=20

Thessaly, from which Deucalion and Pyrrha escaped. There is a still vaguer =
legend of an immense=20

earthquake about 2400 B. C., that shook all Southern Europe, and Asia Minor=
, opening an outlet=20

for the Black Sea, which had before been entirely inland. In the convulsion=
 of the seas, we are told=20

almost all the people of Greece and Asia Minor perished. Chinese traditions=
 and monuments tell of=20

an immense earthquake at the same period, which suddenly raised the bottom =
of the great=20

Northern Sea, pouring its waters out upon all North China and drowning the =
people. Where the=20

great sea once was is now the great Mongolian Desert.  [Illustration: THE D=
ELUGE.]  Likewise the=20

Egyptian priests told Plato of a great island, Atlantis, lying off the coas=
t of North Africa, stretching=20

an unknown distance to the west; the home of a mighty nation that ruled all=
 the western world, to=20

the shores of the Mediterranean, and threatened the liberty of the European=
 world. It is said that=20

they made war on the combined forces of Greece and Egypt; and in the crisis=
 of the struggle a=20

fearful earthquake swallowed up the Grecian soldiery in a single night, and=
 sunk Atlantis in the=20

ocean since called from its name, Atlantic.  Doubtless all these traditions=
 relate to the same=20

terrible catastrophe described in Genesis. The Chinese even tell us in what=
 way the =E2=80=9Cfountains of=20

the great deep were broken up.=E2=80=9D It would seem that a great sea once=
 extended northeastward=20

from the present basin of the Caspian over the deserts of Central Asia; and=
 that an awful upheaval=20

of this basin was the chief factor in the flood. Isthmuses were torn asunde=
r: vast oceans hurled=20

their gigantic=20


_
[142] the detachments commanded by Indian corporals who were sent out to pa=
cify the villages=20

took such part in the lawlessness that they even attacked houses, and it wa=
s by their gunshots=20

that many foreigners were butchered. In the military insurrection of June 3=
, 1823, parties of troops=20

commanded by only one officer (a Philippine Spaniard), without any previous=
 plan or any=20

combination, and simply by appearing before islands engulfed forever. The e=
xtraordinary=20

evaporation from the unusual expanse of water, the sudden chilling of the a=
tmosphere, produced=20

torrents of rain. =E2=80=9CThe same day were all the fountains of the great=
 deep broken up, and the=20

windows of heaven were opened.=E2=80=9D Whatever be the truth of the tradit=
ions, it is certain they=20

preserve the memory of a catastrophe unparalleled in recent days.  Of a lat=
er date, there is the=20
