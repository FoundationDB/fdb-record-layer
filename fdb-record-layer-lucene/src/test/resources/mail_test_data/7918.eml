philodendron monstera bull comes back?"  "That bull won't get us down here, Nell," returned her brother, laying hold of the roots of the hollow tree and trying to turn it over.  But although he and Ruth both exerted themselves to the utmost, in the county; and if ever there could be a funeral important enough for the introduction of a new ceremonial to mark it, it was this one: but what if the Presbytery were to take notice of the innovation? Perhaps the thrill philodendron monstera bull comes back?"  "That bull won't get us down here, Nell," returned her brother, laying hold of the roots of the hollow tree and trying to turn it over.  But although he and Ruth both exerted themselves to the utmost, in the county; and if ever there could be a funeral important enough for the introduction of a new ceremonial to mark it, it was this one: but what if the Presbytery were to take notice of the innovation? Perhaps the thrill _
could scarcely have stood upright against that charge, let alone this rotten stump.  Crash!  The 

rotten roots gave way. They were torn out of the frozen ground, the stump toppled over, and, 

carrying a great ball of earth with it, plunged down the bank of the creek.  Tom had clutched the 

girls by their hands again and the three were running along the narrow shore under shelter of the 

bank. The bull no longer saw them. Indeed, the shock had thrown him to the ground, and when he 

scrambled up, he ran off, bellowing and tossing his head, in an entirely different direction.  But the 

uprooted stump went splash! into the icy waters of the creek, and as it plunged beneath the 

surface--all but its roots--the trio of frightened friends heard remarked that Dalrulzian was the only 

gentleman of the county who was absent from the funeral, and half-a-dozen voices together 

proclaimed the reason,--"He couldna be twa places at once; he's in the jyel for murder," Peggy 

was quenched altogether. Grief and shame were too much for her. She continued to sob, "No' our 

master!" till her voice ceased to be articulate in the midst of her tears.  Dr Stirling was seated in full 

canonicals--black silk gown and cambric bands--in one of the first carriages. It was he that his wife 

looked for when the procession passed the manse; and she put on her black bonnet, and covered 

herself with a veil, and went out very solemnly to the churchyard to see the burial. But it was not 

the burial she thought 


_
"It's from the hollow trunk! I tell you, some body's in there!" declared Tom.  But the uprooted stump 

had fallen into the water with the opening down. If there really was anybody in it, the way in which 

the stump had fallen served to hold such person prisoner.  Ruth Fielding was as quick as Tom to 

turn back to the spot where the old stump had been submerged; but Helen had fallen in her tracks, 

and sat there, hugging her knees and rocking her body to and fro, as she cried:  "He'll be drowned! 

Don't you see, he _is_ drowned? And nor poor Tinto, nor even Lady Car, for whom all day she had 

been uttering notes of compassion: it was the innovation of the funeral service which occupied the 

mind of the minister's wife. With mingled pride and trembling she heard her husband in the silence 

begin his prayer by the side of the vault. It was a beautiful prayer--partly, no doubt, taken from the 

English liturgy, for which, she said, "the Doctor always had a high admiration;" but partly--"and that 

was far the best"--his own. It was the first time anything of the kind
