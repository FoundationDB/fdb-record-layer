because they       die without faith and without sacraments. 39.39. They le=
ad the Indians such a=20

wretched life that they ruin and waste       them in a few days; for it is =
impossible for men to live=20

much under       water without respiration, especially because the cold of =

e, the       Spaniards=20

completed the destruction of all the Indians of the       Lucayan Islands w=
ho were there when they=20

set themselves to making       these gains; each one was worth fifty and a =
hundred crowns, and=20

they       were sold publicly, although it had been prohibited by the      =
 magistrates themselves; it=20

was even more unjust elsewhere for the       Lucayans were great swimmers. =
 They have caused=20

regions.=20

The Yuyapari River   On a river called the Yuyapari, which flows for more t=
han two hundred=20

leagues through the province of Paria, a wretched tyrant(98) sailed a great=
 distance in the year=20

1539, accompanied by four hundred or more men; and he did very great slaugh=
ter, burning alive=20

and putting to the sword numberless innocent and inoffensive people who wer=
e in their towns or=20

houses, unsuspicious of danger; and he left immense tracts of country burnt=
, terrorized, and the=20

inhabitants scattered.  He finally died a bad death and his fleet was dispe=
rsed.  Other tyrants=20

succeeded him and continued this wickedness and tyranny: and to-day they go=
 through those=20

regions destroying, killing, and sending to hell those souls that were rede=

in 1766, was the maker of a remarkable clock of most elaborate nature, with=
 organ that played,=20

and a series of moving figures striking the hours, and bellringers and othe=
r intricate diversions.=20

This clock was exhibited at the International Exhibition in 1851, and is no=
w at the Liverpool=20

Museum.  A fine long-case clock in Chippendale style by Cockey, of Warminst=
er, is illustrated (p.=20

 character.=20

Spaniards injure them.  3.3. More cruel beyond comparison than any of the o=
ther tyrants we have=20

told of, was their invasion; and more irrational and furious were       the=
y than the cruellest tigers,=20

or raging wolves and lions.  Their       liberty of action was the greater =
because they held all the=20

jurisdiction of the country; with greater eagerness and blind       greedin=
ess of avarice, and with=20

ways and arts for stealing and       accumulating gold and silver more exqu=
isite than their=20

predecessors,       they abandoned all fear of God and the King and all sha=
me of men,=20

forgetting that they were mortal beings.  4.4. These devils incarnate have =
devastated, destroyed,=20

and depopulated       more than four hundred leagues of most delightful cou=
ntry containing=20

large and marvellous provinces, valleys extending for forty leagues,       =
pleasant regions, very=20

large towns, most rich in gold.  5.5. They have killed and entirely cut to =
pieces divers large nations=20

and       destroyed many languages, so that not a person who speaks them   =
    remains, except a=20

few, who have hidden in caverns and in the bowels       of the earth to esc=
ape from the pestilential=20

sword of the       foreigners.   66. They have killed, destroyed, and sent =
to hell, (according to my=20

belief), more than four or five millions of those innocent races by       m=
eans of various strange and=20

new kinds of cruel iniquity and       impiety; nor do they, at the present =
day, cease sending them=20

there.  7.7. I will relate no more than three or four instances of the endl=
ess       injustice, outrages,=20

and slaughter they have done, and are doing       to-day; it may be imagine=
d from these what they=20

must have done to       accomplish the great destruction and depopulation w=
e have described.=20

8.8. They took the supreme lord of all the province, putting him to       t=
orture, for no other reason=20

than to obtain his gold.  He escaped       and fled to the mountains, where=
 he remained in hiding=20

amongst the       rocks, with his enraged and terrified people.  The Spania=
rds       attacked them in=20

their search for him; they recaptured him and,       after cruel slaughter,=
 they sold at auction all=20

whom they took       alive.  9.9. Before they captured that ruler, they had=
 been received in many,=20

nay       in all the provinces, wherever they went, with singing and dances=
       and many gifts of=20

large quantities of gold; the payment they made       the Indians was to pu=
t them to the sword and=20

cut them to pieces in       order to terrorise the whole country. 10.10. On=
ce, when the inhabitants=20

had come out to meet him in the       aforesaid way, the tyrant German capt=
ain put a great number=20

of       people into a large straw louse and cut them to pieces.  As the   =
    house had some beams=20

at the top and many climbed up to escape from       the bloody hands and sw=
ords of those men or=20

pitiless beasts, this       infernal man caused fire to be set to the house=
; thus all who       remained=20

were burnt alive. This action caused the depopulation of a       great numb=
er of towns as all the=20

people fled to the long-case clock signed thus, and there is Isaac Johnson =
(Yarmouth), who=20

apparently made wall clocks. John Page, of Ipswich, is the maker of a very =
handsome bracket=20

clock, in date about 1740 (illustrated p. 187). The name of Henry Terold, I=
pswich, is found on a=20

round silver watch with chased interlacing bands and silver dial, of sevent=
eenth-century period.=20

Joseph Chamberlain, of Norwich, is a name found on a late seventeenth-centu=
ry watch. The=20

names of Mann and Jon. Nevill, both of Norwich, are found on late eighteent=
h-century grandfather=20

clocks.  =3DKent and Sussex.=3D--The name of William Gill or Gilt, of Maids=
tone, is found on a fine=20

long-case clock of the eighteenth century. William Gardner, of Sandwich, an=

 the eighteenth century.=20

The dial of a clock by a Sussex maker, Beeching, of Ashburnham, from a thir=
ty-hour clock with=20

single hand and alarum (illustrated p. 243), is of mid-eighteenth century p=
eriod, and shows in its=20



decorations the various phases of the iron industry carried on at Ashburnha=
m.  =3DWelsh Clocks.=3D--

At the Amgueddfa Genedlaethol Cymru, at Cardiff, the National Museum of the=
 Principality, there=20

is a long-case clock by B. C. Vaughan, of Pontypool, and a brass block with=
 movement by=20

"Shenkyn Shon, Black Cock Inn, Pontnedd Fechan, 1714," and also there exhib=
ited are the works=20

of the old clock from St. David's Cathedral.  Illustrated on p. 245 is a un=
ique long-case clock with=20

brass plate on door, with date 1761, with dragon above. The particular feat=
ure of especial interest=20

in this clock is its oval dial (which is separately illustrated, p. 249). T=
his dial is enamelled white,=20

and has a medallion at top representing the figure of Hope with an anchor. =
The other decoration is=20

interesting as exhibiting the attempt of the provincial maker to simulate i=
n pigment the marquetry=20

work of the Sheraton school, the design being similar to that found on tea-=
caddies, no doubt well=20

known to the painter of the dial. There are two subsidiary dials, one for s=
econds and the other=20

showing the days of the month.  [Illustration: DIAL OF CLOCK ILLUSTRATED P.=

r's name is "Marston=20

(Salop)" there is an especially Welsh interest attaching to this clock. It =
once was in the possession=20

of Daniel Owen, the famous Welsh novelist, who is buried in Mold churchyard=
, and whose=20

monument is in the County Hall Field at Mold. He introduced this clock into=
 his novel, _Rhys=20

Lewis_. The grandmother of the youthful hero of the story had gone to the f=
air; in her absence the=20

boy took this clock to pieces, so the story goes. But as the hours wore on =
he found it was easier to=20

take it to pieces than to put it together again. The scene on the=20


_
they hoped to be safe. 11.11. They came to another large province on the bo=
rders of the province=20

and kingdom of Santa Marta, where they found the Indians in their       tow=
ns and houses,=20

peaceably occupied with their affairs.  They       stayed with them a long =
time, eating their=20

substance while the       Indians served them as though it were their duty =
to give them life       and=20

succour; they bore with their continual oppressions and usual       exactio=
ns, which are intolerable,=20

for one parasite Spaniard eats as       much in one day as would be suffici=
ent for an Indian=20

household of       ten persons for a month. 12.12. During this time, the In=
dians spontaneously gave=20

them great       quantities of gold, besides the best of treatment.  At las=
t when the       tyrants=20

wished to depart, they determined to repay their hospitality       in this =
following manner. 13.13.=20

The German governor, who was a tyrant and, for what we know also a       he=
retic--for he never=20

attends mass neither does he let many others       go, besides which, other=
 signs mark him as a=20

Lutheran,--ordered his       men to capture all the Indians they could, wit=
h their wives and=20

children, and to confine them in a large yard or wooden enclosure       pre=
pared for the purpose;=20

he then announced that whoever wished to       go out and be free, must ran=
som himself according=20

to the will of the       iniquitous governor, giving so much gold for himse=
lf, so much for       his wife=20

and for each of his children; and to force them the more,       he commande=
d that nothing whatever=20

should be given them to eat,       until they brought him the gold he deman=
ded as ransom. 14.14.=20

Many who were able, sent to their houses for gold and redeemed       themse=
lves.  They were set=20

free, and returned to their occupations       and to their houses to provid=
e themselves with the=20

necessaries of       life. The tyrant sent certain villainous Spanish thiev=
es to       recapture these=20

miserable Indians, who had once ransomed themselves;       they brought the=
m back to the=20

enclosure and tortured them with       hunger and thirst to make them ranso=
m themselves again.=20

15.15. Many who were captured were ransomed two and three times.  Others   =
    who could not,=20

because they had given all the gold they possessed       and had not enough=
 left, he left=20

languishing in the enclosure till       they died of hunger. 16.16. By this=
 deed, he left ruined,=20

desolate, and depopulated, a most       populous province most rich in gold=
, which has a valley of=20

forty       leagues, where he burnt a town that had a thousand houses. 17.1=
7. This infernal tyrant=20

determined to go inland, as he eagerly desired       to discover the hell o=
f Peru in those parts.  To=20

make this unhappy       journey, he, and the others brought numberless Indi=
ans, chained to=20

one another, carrying loads of sixty, and seventy pounds each. 18.18. If on=
e tired, or fainted from=20

hunger, fatigue, and weakness, they       at once cut off his head at the c=
ollar of the chain so as not=20

to       stop to loosen the others in the line; and the head fell to one si=
de       and the body to the=20

other, and they distributed his load among the       other bearers. 1919. T=
o tell of the provinces he=20

destroyed, the towns, and places he       burnt (for all the houses are bui=
lt of straw)--the people he=20

killed,       the cruelty he displayed in the several massacres during this=
       journey, would make=20

an incredible and terrifying story, but it would       be true, nevertheles=
s. 20.20. These journeys=20

were afterwards undertaken by other tyrants who       followed in the same =
Venezuela, and others=20

from the province of       Santa Marta, animated by the same holy intention=
 of discovering this=20

holy house of gold in Peru; and they found all the country for more       t=
han two hundred leagues,=20

so much burnt, depopulated, and deserted,       from formerly being most po=
pulous and=20

prosperous, as has been said,       that though they themselves were cruel =
tyrants, they marvelled=20

and       were horrified to behold the traces of such lamentable devastatio=
n. 21.21. Many witnesses=20



have proved these things before the chancellor of       the exchequer of th=
e India Council and the=20

proofs are in the       possession of the same Council but they have never =
burnt alive any       of=20

these nefarious tyrants. 22.22. But what has been proven is as nothing comp=
ared to the=20

massacres       and great wickedness that have been committed, because all =
the       officers of=20

justice in the Indies are so mortally blind that they do       not investig=
ate the crimes, destruction,=20

and slaughter that have       been, and are to-day wrought by all the tyran=
ts of the Indies,=20

beyond declaring that as such and such a one has used cruelty       towards=
 the Indians, the King's=20

revenue has lost so many thousand       crowns; they are satisfied with lit=
tle proof, and that of a=20

very       general and confused character. 23.23. And even this they do not=
 verify, nor make it as=20

clear as they       should; for if they did their duty to God and the king,=
 they would       discover that=20

the said German tyrants have robbed the king of more       than three milli=
on crowns' worth of gold,=20

because that province of       Venezuela, with the others they have ruined,=
 devastated, and=20

depopulated for an extent of more than four hundred leagues, (as I       ha=
ve said) was the most=20

prosperous, the richest in gold, and the       most populous of the univers=
e. 24.24. During the=20

sixteen years those tyrants, enemies of God, devastated       it, they have=
 wasted and caused the=20

loss of more than two millions       of revenue that the king of Spain woul=
d have drawn from that=20

kingdom. Nor is there hope of repairing this damage between now and       t=
he end of the world,=20

unless God, through a miracle, should       resuscitate so many million per=
sons. 25.25. These are=20

the temporal injuries to the king. It would be well to       consider what,=
 and how many are the=20

injuries, the dishonour,       blasphemies, and insults to God and His law,=
 and with what will be=20

requited so many numberless souls, burning in hell, because of the       av=
arice and cruelty of=20

these tyrant animals or Germans. (100) 26.26. To sum up this wickedness and=
 ferocity, I will only=20

say that from       the day the Germans entered the country till the presen=
t time, that       is in these=20

sixteen years, the Indians they have transported in       their ships amoun=
t to more than a million=20

who were sold as slaves in       Santa Marta, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the =
island of San Juan.=20

27.27. And even now, in the year 1542, the traffic continues, for the      =
 royal Audiencia of=20

Hispaniola dissembled--nay favoured this and all       the other numberless=
 acts of tyranny and=20

destruction done along all       that coast of the continent, which is more=
 than four hundred leagues=20

from Venezuela to Santa Marta, and is under their jurisdiction,       thoug=
h they could have=20

prevented and corrected them. 28.28. There has been no other reason to make=
 slaves of all these=20

Indians       except the perverse, blind, obstinate will of these most avar=
icious       tyrants, and to=20

satisfy their insatiable avarice for money; just as       all the others ha=
ve always done everywhere=20

in the Indies, taking       those lambs and sheep away from their houses, t=
heir wives, and their=20

children in the said cruel and wicked ways, marking them with the       kin=
g's brand to sell them as=20

slaves.        The Provinces of that Part of the Continent which is Called =
Florida      1. These=20

provinces(101) have been visited at divers times since the       year 1510 =
or 1511 by three tyrants=20

who imitated the deeds done by       the others, and also by two of them in=
 other parts of the Indies=20

seeking to advance to a degree disproportioned to their merit, at       the=
 cost of the blood and=20

destruction of their fellow creatures.  2.2. And all three died a bad death=
, and their families and=20

properties       established in human blood, perished, for I am witness of =
all three,       whose very=20

memory is already as extinct in the world as though they       had never li=
ved.  3.3. The infamy and=20

horror of their names scandalised all the land       because of some massac=
res they perpetrated:=20



these were not many,       however, for God killed them before they did mor=
e, for He had=20

reserved till that hour the punishment for the wickedness that I       know=
 and saw they committed=20

in other parts of the Indies.  4.4. The fourth tyrant went there recently, =
in the year 1538, with his=20

plans made and with great preparations. Since three years nothing       has=
 been seen or heard of=20

him.  5.5. We are sure, that as soon as he landed he committed cruel deeds =
and       at once=20

disappeared: and that, if he be alive, he and his men have       destroyed =
numbers of people in=20

these three years, if he encountered       any on his march, for he is one =
of the notorious, and=20

experienced       ones who, together with his other companions, has done th=
e most harm       and=20

wickedness, and has destroyed many provinces, and kingdoms.  But       we r=
ather believe that=20

God has given him the same end as the others.  6.6. Three or four years aft=
er the above things=20

were written, three of       the other tyrants returned from the land calle=
d Florida; they had=20

accompanied the chief tyrant whom they left dead, and we learned       from=
 them what cruelty and=20

unheard of wickedness, these inhuman men       committed there against thos=
e innocent and=20

harmless Indians,       principally during the life of their commander and =
also after his       unhappy=20

death: therefore what I foretold above has not turned out       wrong.  7.7=
. And so many things=20

confirm the rule I laid down at the beginning:       that the more they con=
tinue to discover, ruin, and=20

destroy both       peoples and countries, the more notorious are the cruelt=
ies and       iniquities they=20

commit against God and their fellow creatures.  8.8. It is already wearisom=
e to us to relate so=20

many, and such execrable,       horrible, blood-thirsty operations, not by =
men, but by ferocious=20

beasts, hence I will not stop to relate any but the following.  9.9. They f=
ound large towns full of=20

people who were friendly,       intelligent, politic, and orderly.  They di=
d great slaughter among=20

them, according to their custom, in order to impregnate the hearts       of=
 those people with fear of=20

them. 10.10. They tormented and killed them, loading them like animals.  Wh=
en       one became=20

tired, or fainted, they cut off his head at the neck, in       order not to=
 free those in front from the=20

chain that bound them, and       the body fell to one side and the head to =
the other, as we have=20

told       elsewhere above. 11.11. In one town where they went they were re=
ceived with joy, and=20

over-abundant food was given them, while more than six hundred       Indian=
s carried their loads,=20

like beasts of burden, and cared for       their horses; when the tyrants h=
ad left there, a captain who=20

was a       relative of the chief tyrant, turned back to rob the entire tow=
n       whose people felt=20

themselves safe; and with a lance, he killed the       lord and king of the=
 town, and did other cruel=20

deeds. 12.12. Because the inhabitants of another large town seemed to them =
to be       a little=20

more on their guard, on account of the infamous and       horrible deeds of=
 which they had heard,=20

they put to the sword large       and small children and old people, subjec=
ts and lords, without=20

sparing any one. 13.13. It is said that the chief tyrant had the faces of p=
iquantly described. The=20

clock-work ran like a thing demented, and the tell-tale hands revealed the =
secret of the culprit, who=20

uneasily fingered a missing wheel in his pocket, and he had forgotten to pu=
t on the pendulum.=20

The hood of the clock is of original decoration. The upper spandrels have a=
 blue-and-gold floral=20

design, covered with glass. The two lower spandrels are delicately carved. =
The frame around the=20

oval dial is of beaded work cut in broad and effective style.  Altogether t=
his clock possesses=20

features appealing to collectors. The provincial maker followed his own lin=
es, and has in so doing=20

produced something unique.         *       *       *       *       *  In co=
nclusion, some apology should be=20

made for an attempt to sketch in makers of repute, scattered over so wide a=
n area, which resulted=20



in a mere outline. The meagre lists may in many cases be said to be notewor=
thy for their=20

omissions. But want of space has precluded the writer from pursuing the sub=
ject further, and he=20

may be permitted to express a hope that the perusal of these facts may stim=
ulate local efforts to=20

worthier records.     CHAPTER IX  SCOTTISH AND IRISH CLOCKS       David Ram=
say,=20

Clockmaker Extraordinary to James I--Some      early "knokmakers"--List of =
eighteenth-century=20

Scottish      makers--Character of Scottish clocks--Irish clockmakers: Dubl=
in,      Belfast, Cork--List=20

of Irish clockmakers.   Among the most notable of the early Scottish makers=
 was David Ramsay,=20

who was clockmaker to James VI of Scotland and followed that monarch to Lon=
don. In Sir Walter=20

Scott's _Fortunes of Nigel_, Ramsay is introduced as a character. "David Ra=
msay by name, who,=20

whether recommended by his great skill in his profession, as the courtiers =
alleged, or, as was=20

murmured among his neighbours, by his birthplace, in the good town of Dalke=
ith, near Edinburgh,=20

held in James's household the post of maker of watches and horologes to his=
 Majesty. He scorned=20

not, however, to keep open shop within Temple Bar, a few yards to the eastw=
ard of St. Dunstan's=20

Church."  It appears that he was of a mystical turn of mind, and conceived =
the idea of treasure=20

buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. Dean Withnam gave permission =
to dig, and prudently=20

stipulated as a condition that he came in for a share. One John Scott, pret=
ending to the skilled use=20

of the divining rod, Ramsay, and several others, according to the astrologe=
r Lilly in his _Life and=20

Times_, dug 6 feet deep with the aid of labourers and came to a coffin, but=
 as it was not heavy=20

they did not open it, "which we afterwards much repented." When at this imp=
ious task a terrific=20

storm arose, and "we verily believed the west end of the church would have =
fallen upon us."=20

Candles and torches, except one, were extinguished. "John Scott, my partner=
, was amazed,=20

looked pale, knew not what to think or do until I gave directions and comma=
nd to dismiss the=20

demons; which when done, all was quiet again, and each man returned unto hi=
s lodging late,=20

about twelve o'clock at night." The share of the Dean in the treasure there=
fore came to nought.=20

The _Dictionary of National Biography_ supplements and corrects Sir Walter.=
 "Clockmaker=20

Extraordinary" was Ramsay's title, and his son says: "When James I succeede=
d to the crown of=20

England, he sent into France for my father, who was there, and made him pag=
e of the=20

bedchamber and keeper of his Majesty's clocks and watches."  He was of cons=
iderable reputation,=20

as, when the charter of incorporation was granted by Charles I to the Clock=
makers' Company of=20

London, he was appointed as the first master in 1631. He apparently was not=
 of a worldly=20

disposition, and it is believed that when the destinies of the Stuarts were=
 under a cloud he was in=20

great poverty. His son writes of his father: "It's true your carelessness i=
n laying up while the sun=20

shone for the tempests of a stormy day, hath given occasion to some inferio=
r spirited people not to=20

value you for what you are by nature and in yourself, for such look not to =
a man longer than he is=20

in prosperity, esteeming none but for their wealth, not wisdom, power, nor =
virtue."  The knowledge=20

of what manner of man was this old Scottish clockmaker adds a pleasure to t=
he contemplation of=20

his work. At the Guelph Exhibition were shown a clock and alarum watch with=
 single hand, dated=20

1636, signed _D. Ramsay_. This was on the eve of the Civil War, a year befo=
re Hampden refused=20

to pay ship money in England and the introduction of a new Prayer Book in S=
cotland. But the=20

Prayer Book was no sooner opened at St. Giles's, Edinburgh, than a murmur r=
an through the=20

congregation, and the murmur soon grew into a formidable riot. The Covenant=
 signed in the=20

churchyard of the Greyfriars at Edinburgh set a flame alight throughout Sco=
tland. "Such was the=20



zeal of subscribers that for a while many subscribed with tears on their ch=
eeks"--some were=20

indeed reputed to have "drawn their own blood and used it in place of ink t=
o underwrite their=20

names."  In such times old David Ramsay, away in the South, saw Stuart magn=
ificence come to a=20

close. At the British Museum is a watch he signs "_David Ramsay, Scotus me =
fecit_." In signing=20

thus, he shows he was proud of being a Scotsman, and as a great Scottish cl=
ockmaker his name=20

and record are given the place of honour at the front of this sketch of Sco=
ttish work. His watches=20

are richly decorated in the French style; doubtless he learned his craft in=
 France. His last years=20

were passed in the stormy period of the Revolution, and he lived to see Cro=
mwell and the=20

Roundheads defeat Leslie at Dunbar. He died in Holborn in 1654, the year of=
 the union of England=20

and Scotland under Cromwell by Ordinance.  =3DSome Early "Knokmakers."=3D--=
A clock in Scottish is=20

a _knok_. It would appear that the early "knokmakers" were more conversant =
with the Kirk knok,=20

the Tolbooth knok, and the College knok, than with the domestic clock or wa=
tch.  In the middle of=20

the seventeenth century, as in England at a slightly previous date, clockma=
kers formed=20

themselves into trade guilds. London was incorporated in 1631. Edinburgh fo=
llowed in 1646,=20

Glasgow, 1649, Haddington, 1753, and Aberdeen not till 1800. The metal-work=
ers of Scotland=20

have always been renowned, and at the above dates clockmakers were eligible=
 to enter the=20

Hammermen's Incorporations as affiliated with the craft of locksmith, which=
 was of ancient lineage.=20

During the seventeenth century the Scottish clockmakers, in common with Eng=
lish, came under=20

foreign inspiration. But the eighteenth century saw a complete school of ma=
kers springing up in=20

various parts of the country, flowing to, and again flowing from, Edinburgh=
 and the Canongate=20

(including Leith), which were the earliest centres of Scottish clockmaking.=
  [Illustration: BRASS=20

LANTERN CLOCK.  With brass dial and fine fretwork. Inscribed "Humphry Mills=
 at Edinburgh=20

Fecit." Date, about 1670.  (_In the Glasgow Museum. Reproduced by permissio=
n of the Glasgow=20

Corporation._)]  We mention a few of the early makers. There was Humphry Mi=
lls, who is referred=20

to in the minutes of the Incorporation of Hammermen, Edinburgh, in 1661. Th=
ere is an example of=20

his work in the Antiquarian Museum, Edinburgh, and we illustrate another in=
 the Corporation=20

Museum at Glasgow (p. 259). This lantern clock, with brass dial and fine fr=
etwork with floriated=20

design, is inscribed _Humphry Mills at Edinburgh fecit_.  Richard Mills, or=
 Milne, was apparently=20

the nephew of Humphry, and was admitted a freeman clockmaker at Edinburgh i=
n 1678. He died=20

in 1710. Another early maker is John Alexander, of Edinburgh, made a freema=
n in 1671, his trial=20

being to make "ane Knok and mounting and ane sun dyall," also a "Kist lock =
and key," this part of=20

the locksmith's craft being one of the necessary proofs of craftsmanship fo=
r admission as a fully=20

qualified Hammerman. He died in 1707. It is interesting to note that he had=
 to construct a sundial.=20

The art of dialling is intricate, and this indicates that the old clockmake=
r had a sound technical and=20

scientific knowledge. He was evidently no maker of clocks as "bits o' mecha=
nism," or an=20

assembler of parts. He understood principles.  Thomas Gordon, apprentice to=
 Andrew Brown,=20

Edinburgh, 1688, was in business for forty years and died in 1743. His neph=
ew, Patrick Gordon,=20

was the son of Alexander Gordon, of Briggs, and seems to have been a man of=
 wealth, apart from=20

his trade as a clockmaker. A fine example of his work is illustrated (p. 26=
3), a long-case clock=20

having the door of lacquered work in the "Chinese taste." On the case witho=
ut the panel is=20

stencilled work, attempting to follow out the style of the imported panel. =
This example indicates=20

what has already been advanced in the chapter on Lacquered Cases (pp. 110, =
114), that such=20



work was of foreign origin. This panelled door is of oak.  Other seventeent=
h-century makers=20

include Paul Roumieu, 1677 to 1694, the first practical watchmaker who came=
 to Edinburgh.=20

Before that date only clocks were attempted.  Paul Roumieu, jun., son of th=
e above, was admitted=20

as a freeman of Edinburgh in 1692, and died in 1710.  =3DList of Eighteenth=
-century Scottish=20

Makers.=3D--In regard to the activities of Scottish clockmakers in comparis=
on with their fellow-

craftsmen across the border, it is interesting to note that there are very =
few examples of the early=20

crown and verge escapement by Scotch makers, but there are a great number o=
f the anchor=20

escapement. Although invented by Hooke in 1675, this was not taken up readi=
ly. This=20

unwillingness to adopt new styles is a feature in clockmaking in the provin=
ces and in Scotland. The=20

works of a clock are not unfrequently put by the maker into a case belongin=
g to a period of cabinet=20

work of some forty years previous. The clockmaker was an autocrat, and comp=
elled the case-

maker to follow old traditions in making cases.  [Illustration: LONG-CASE C=

year 1522 some captains have visited       Rio della Plata, (102) where the=
re are large kingdoms=20

and provinces,       and very friendly and intelligent people.  2.2. We kno=
w, in general, that they=20

have committed many homicides and       much injury.  In particular, as it =
is so distant from the=20

Indies, we       have nothing signal to tell.  3.3. We have no doubt at all=
, however, but that they=20

have and do carry on       the same practices as in other places; because t=
hey are the same=20

Spaniards, and some among them have visited other regions, and       becaus=
e they go to get=20

wealth and power just like the others; it is       impossible for this to c=
ome about, except by=20

destruction, massacres,       robbery, and the extermination of the Indians=
 by the adoption of the=20

perverse rule and system they have all alike followed.  4.4. After writing =
the above, we have=20

learned, with ample proof, that       they have destroyed and depopulated g=
reat provinces and=20

kingdoms of       that country, murdering, and cruelly treating those unfor=
tunate       people; they=20

have thereby made themselves even more notorious than       the others, bec=
ause, being at a=20

greater distance from Spain, they       could do more as they pleased and c=
onsequently lived in=20

greater       disorder and with less justice.  As for justice, however, the=
re has       never been any in=20

all the Indies, as is seen from what has been       related above.  5.5. Am=
ong infinite other cases,=20

the three following have been read       before the Council of the Indies. =
 A tyrant governor=20

commanded       certain of his people, to go to some Indian town and, if fo=
od was       not given=20

them, to kill all the inhabitants.   Thus authorised, they       started an=
d, because the Indians=20

considered them their enemies and       more out of fear and the desire to =
escape from them, than=20

from a       want of generosity, refused to supply them, the Spaniards put =
more       than five=20

thousand persons to the sword.  6.6. Another time a certain number of peopl=
e presented=20

themselves       peaceably for their service, or perhaps they had been summ=
oned by       the=20

Spaniards; and because they did not come quickly enough, or       because, =
as is their habit and=20

common usage, they wished to inspire       them with fear and horrible frig=
ht, the Governor=20

commanded that they       should all be consigned into the hands of their I=
ndian enemies.  7.7.=20

They wept and cried, praying that the Spaniards  would kill them,       rat=
her than deliver them to=20

their enemies. (103) And as they would       not leave the house where they=
 were, they were cut to=20

pieces there,       weeping, and crying out: "We came peaceably to serve yo=
u and you       kill us?=20

May our blood, remain on these walls as testimony of our       unjust death=
 and of your cruelty!"=20

This was, in truth, a notorious       action, and worthy of consideration, =
but much more of being=20

lamented.                   The Vast Kingdoms and Great Provinces of Peru  =
    1. In the year 1531=20



another great tyrant went with certain people to       the kingdoms of Peru=
,(104) which he invaded=20

by virtue of the same       title, intentions, and principles as all the fo=
rmer ones, because he=20

was one of the most experienced, and since a long time had taken       part=
 in all the cruelties and=20

massacres that had been committed on       the continent since the year 151=
0; he was devoid of=20

faith and       honour, and he did more cruelty and slaughter, destroying t=
owns,       killing and=20

exterminating the people of them and causing such great       mischief in t=
hese countries that, I am=20

certain, it would be       impossible for any one to recount and describe t=
hem till we shall       see=20

and know them clearly in the day of judgment. I could not, nor       should=
 I know how to describe=20

the deformity, the character, and the       circumstances of some incidents=
 that I would relate, and=20

which       greatly aggravate their hideousness.  2.2. From his unhappy lan=
ding, he killed and=20

destroyed some peoples and       robbed them of a large quantity of gold.  =
In an island near the=20

same       province called Pugna which is very populous and pleasing, they =
were       received by=20

the lord and people like angels from heaven and, after       having eaten a=
ll their provisions in six=20

months, the Indians again       uncovered the store of corn they had laid u=
p for themselves and=20

their families in time of drought and barrenness, tearfully offering       =
it for their consumption.  The=20

payment that was finally awarded the       natives, was to put them to the =
sword, for they killed=20

great numbers       with lances, and those whom they captured alive, they m=
ade slaves;       in=20

consequence of this and the other great notorious cruelties done       ther=
e, they left this island=20

almost deserted.  3.3. From there the Spaniards went to the province of Tum=
bala, which is       on=20

the continent, where they killed and destroyed everything they       could.=
  And because all the=20

people fled from their fearful and       horrible operations, they declared=
 they had revolted and were=20

in       rebellion against the king.  4.4. This tyrant employed the followi=
ng artifice.  He demanded=20

still more       from all who either offered or whom he asked to present hi=
m with       gold, silver, and=20

their other possessions, until he saw that they       either had no more, o=
r brought no more: he then=20

declared that he       received them as vassals of the king of Spain and em=
braced them; he=20

caused two trumpets to be sounded, giving them to understand that       for=
 the future he would=20

take nothing more from them, nor do them any       harm; he esteemed it per=
missible to rob them=20

or to take all they       gave, out of fear inspired by the abominable repo=
rts they heard of       him,=20

before he received them under the shelter and protection of the       king,=
 as though after they were=20

received under the royal protection       he would no more oppress, rob, de=
solate, and destroy=20

them.  5.5. A few days later came the universal king and emperor of those  =
     kingdoms, who was=20

called Atabaliba with many naked people armed with       ridiculous weapons=
 and ignorant of how=20

swords cut, and lances wound,       and horses run; nor did they know the S=
paniards, who would=20

assault       the very devils if they had gold, to rob them of it.  He arri=
ved at       the place where=20

they were, and said: "Where are these Spaniards? let       them come forwar=
d, for I shall not stir=20

from here till satisfaction       is rendered me for my vassals whom they h=
ave killed, for the town=20

they have desolated, and for the riches they have stolen from me."  6.6. Th=
e Spaniards attacked=20

him--killing infinite numbers of his people;       they took him prisoner f=
rom the litter in which he was=20

carried and       after they had captured him, they negotiated with him for=
 his       ransom: he=20

promised to give four million crowns, and paid them       fifteen, after wh=
ich they promised to set=20

him free.  7.7. They ended by keeping no faith nor truth, for they have nev=
er been       kept by the=20

Spaniards in their dealings with the Indians: they       calumniated him, s=
aying that by his orders=20



the people were       assembling, and he replied that not a leaf moved in a=
ll the country       save by=20

his will and that if the people were assembling, they might       believe t=
hat he was the cause of it:=20

as he was their prisoner, they       might therefore kill him.  8.8. In spi=
te of all this they condemned=20

him to be burned alive, although       later, some of them begged the capta=
in, to have him=20

of print, and a new and enlarged edition containing no less than 2,700 name=

No student or collector of Scottish clocks can afford to be without this vo=
lume, as it is the only one=20

dealing with its subject.  In regard to districts in England and Wales, the=
re is an opportunity for=20

local antiquarian societies to gather and tabulate county lists on the line=
s of this Scottish volume.=20

The records of provincial makers are still exasperatingly incomplete.  Ther=
e is the authoritative=20

volume by the late F. J. Britten, _Old Clocks and Watches and their Makers_=
, with a list of over=20

10,000 names. But in the main these are of London makers.  =3DCharacter of =
Scottish Clocks.=3D--It is=20

seldom that a clock by a Scottish maker is found to be cased in old oak. Mo=
st of the long-case=20

clocks are of mahogany, which was not in general use till about 1740. It is=
 true that there are=20

exceptions, some few being found in lacquered or Dutch marquetry cases, but=
 the majority are in=20

mahogany.  In regard to clockmaking on a lower plane, there are the interes=
ting clocks, with the=20

works entirely constructed of wood, usually beech, as being the best wood a=
dapted to cutting the=20

teeth for the wheels; other woods used were holly and boxwood. Very few old=
 examples now=20

remain.  There seems, too, to have been a strong proclivity towards the mus=
ical clock. Several=20

great makers produced fine examples of this class of clock which played pop=
ular airs. No doubt in=20

the days of musical boxes, prior to the age of the gramophone, the great fo=
lk at Edinburgh, when=20

the "Wizard of the North" enchanted society, had a penchant for these music=
al sweet-chiming=20

clocks. Daniel Brown, of Mauchline, made the modest clock that stood in the=
 cottage of Robert=20

Burns; and James Gray, or John Smith, or Patrick Toshach, or one of the oth=
er clockmakers who=20

made the hours "fading in music," may have constructed some musical marvel =
for the master of=20

Abbotsford.  [Illustration:  DIAL OF LONG PENDULUM CLOCK.  With single weig=

the four seasons. This is a feature found on Dutch dials. In date this is a=
bout 1750. The=20

enlargement of the dial (p. 267) shows that the engraver went wrong in his =
spacing. He had to put=20

the last letter above the others. Indeed, it suggests that another hand tha=
n that which engraved=20

the decoration and the name of the maker contributed the place. It is somew=
hat puzzling, and=20

leads to conjecture as to its history. It is just such examples, out of the=
 main stream of leading=20

makers, which so often provide exceptional interest to the collector.  =3DI=
rish Clockmakers.=3D--The art=20

of the clockmaker in Ireland, although having by no means lagged behind tha=
t of Scotland, has not=20



received the attention of collectors and connoisseurs which it deserves.  R=
esearches are being=20

made, and new data are coming to hand which will assist the student to dete=

Irish clockmakers' work. There are some 1,100 names already known of makers=
, and those=20

interested await the results of close and painstaking investigation which w=

following names are here given, tabulating a few of the leading Irish maker=
s of the eighteenth=20

century:--       George Aicken (Cork), 1770-95.        A clock by this make=

Brechin Town Hall.      George Graydon (Dublin), 1764-1805 (died).        A=
 clock by this maker is=20

illustrated (p. 269).      Martin Kirkpatrick (Dublin), 1720-69 (died).    =
  John Knox (Belfast), 1729-

83.      Frederick May (Dublin), 1770-96.      Thomas Meeking (Dublin), 168=

k), 1820-24.=20

Richard Wyatt (Dublin), 1731-55 (died).  These dates do not represent the m=
akers' complete=20

history. Some may have worked prior to the first date and after the last da=
te, except when stated=20

as having died then.  In regard to Belfast, the late Isaac W. Ward contribu=
ted some notes to the=20

_Belfast Evening Telegraph_ in 1909 on "Early Belfast Clock and Watchmakers=
," which enable=20

some interesting particulars to be given. In 1791 one Job Rider announced t=
hat he had=20

commenced business in Belfast, "where he makes clocks and watches of all ki=
nds in the common=20

manner with Harrison's and other modern improvements." It would appear that=
 he had been to=20

London, where possibly he was apprenticed, and had visited Dublin and Hills=
borough. From 1805=20

to 1807 he was in partnership with R. L. Gardner. After 1807 he seems to ha=
ve been associated=20

with William Boyd.  [Illustration: MUSICAL CLOCK BY GEORGE AICKEN (CORK).  =

791, set up business in=20

Belfast in 1803 and joined R. L. Gardner from 1809 to 1818. At this date th=
e firm became known=20

as Robert Neill & Sons. Robert Neill died in 1857. His descendants still ca=
rry on business at=20

Belfast. Another Belfast maker was James Wilson, who worked in the middle o=
f the eighteenth=20

century. There is a record of a musical clock being advertised by him in 17=
55, which he had=20

constructed to play a number of tunes.  The wall clock by George Graydon, o=
f Dublin (illustrated p.=20

269), shows some interesting features. The circle round the dial is carved =
wood gilt; the dial itself=20

is painted and very much cracked. The lower part is harewood inlaid. In dat=
e this example is about=20

1796, as it will be seen the volunteer in uniform on panel has G.R. on his =
cartouche-box.  The=20

bracket clock by George Aicken, of Cork (illustrated p. 273), is of fine pr=
oportions and sound=20



design. It has striking and chiming movements, and plays six tunes marked o=
n lunette, "Minuet,=20

March, Jigg, Air, Minuet, Gavot."  An early nineteenth century clock by Sha=
rp, of Dublin, is=20

illustrated (p. 275). It is a miniature long-case clock, being only 3 feet =
5-1/2 inches high. It is made=20

to hang on the wall, as there are two rings at the back of the case for thi=
s purpose. Its glass door,=20

showing the pendulum, indicates the French influence, which in the early ni=
neteenth century made=20

itself felt in Ireland as elsewhere.  In 1783 a company of Swiss watchmaker=
s came to Ireland, and=20

establishing themselves near Waterford, termed their settlement New Geneva.=
 By 23 & 24 George=20

III, 1784, they were granted power to assay gold and silver. An earlier Act=
 of George II provided for=20

only one standard of gold--22 carats. This new Act admitted three--22, 20, =
and 18 carats. These=20

facilities were granted to encourage the manufacture of watches and watch-c=
ases in Ireland. This=20

Assay Office at New Geneva did not continue in operation more than six year=
s.  The office at New=20

Geneva had=20


_
burn him afterwards. When he learned this he said: "Why do you wish       t=
o burn me?  What have=20

I done to you?  Have you not promised to free       me, after my ransom was=
 paid?  Have I not=20

given you more than what I       promised you?  Send me, as thus you wish i=
t, to your King of=20

Spain."       He said many other things showing condemnation and detestatio=
n of       the great=20

injustice of the Spaniards: and at last they burnt him.  9.9. Let the justi=
ce of these deeds be=20

considered: the reason of this       war: the imprisonment, death sentence,=
 and execution of this=20

monarch; and how conscientiously these tyrants hold the great       treasur=
es they steal in those=20

kingdoms from such a great king and       from numberless other lords and p=
rivate people. 10.10.=20

Of the countless notoriously wicked and cruel acts committed in the       e=
xtirpation of these people=20

by those who call themselves Christians,       I will relate some few that =
a friar of St. Francis=20

witnessed in the       beginning; and he signed depositions with his name, =
sending some of       the=20

copies to those regions and others to the kingdoms of Castile:       and I =
have one of the copies in=20

my possession with his own       signature, in which he makes the following=
 statements. 11.11. "I,=20

Fray Marcus de Nizza of the Order of St. Francis, commissary of       the f=
riars of the same Order=20

in the provinces of Peru, who were       among the first monks who entered =
the said provinces with=20

the first       Christians, speak to render truthful testimony of some of t=
he things       that I saw with=20

my own eyes in that country; chiefly concerning the       treatment of the =
Indians and the=20

acquisition of property taken from       the natives." 12.12. "First of all=
 I am eye-witness, and from=20

actual experience know,       that these Indians of Peru are the most affab=
le people that have=20

been seen among the Indians, and were very well inclined and       friendly=
 towards the=20

Christians." 13.13. "And I saw that they gave gold abundantly to the Spania=
rds, and       silver and=20

precious stones and all that was asked of them, and that       they rendere=
d them every good=20

service; and the Indians never went       forth in war fashion, but always =
peaceably, as long as no=20

cruelty       and ill-treatment provoked them; on the contrary, they receiv=
ed the       Spaniards with=20

all benevolence and honour in their towns, giving       them provisions and=
 as many male and=20

female slaves for their       service, as they asked." 14.14. "I am also wi=
tness, and I testify, that=20

without the Indians giving       them any cause or occasion, the Spaniards,=
 as soon as they entered=20

their country, and after the chief lord Atabaliba had paid them more       =
than two millions of gold=20

and had left all the country in their       power, without resistance, imme=
diately burnt the said=20

Atabaliba, who       was ruler of all the country: and after him, they burn=
t alive his       captain-

general Cochilimaca who had come peaceably to the governor,       accompani=
ed by other high=20

personages." 15.15. "Within a few days after these executions they likewise=
 burned       Chamba=20

another very high lord of the province of Quito, without him       giving t=
hem any cause." 16.16.=20

"Thus too they burnt unjustly Chapera lord of the Canaries." 17.17. "Likewi=
se they burnt the feet of=20

Luis who was one of the great       lords in Quito, and tortured him in man=
y other ways, to force=20

him to       reveal the hiding place of Atabaliba's gold, of which treasure=
 it       was known that he=20

knew nothing whatever." 18.18. "They likewise burnt in Quito, Cozzopanga, w=
ho was governor of=20

all       the provinces of Quito and who had responded to the intimations o=
f       Sebastian de=20

Benalcazza, the governor's captain, by coming       peaceably; but because =
he did not give them=20

as much gold as they       asked, they burnt him, with many other lords and=
 principal persons.=20

As far as I could understand, it was the intention of the Spaniards       t=
hat no lord should survive in=20

all the country." 19.19. "The Spaniards assembled a large number of Indians=
, and shut up as=20



many as could enter, in three large houses which they then set on       fir=
e and burnt them all,=20

although they had never done the slightest       thing against any Spaniard=
, nor given the least=20

cause." 20.20. "It once happened, that when a priest called Ocana, pulled a=
 child       out of the fire=20

in which it was burning, another Spaniard snatched       it out of his hand=
s and threw it back in the=20

middle of the flames,       where it became ashes together with the others;=
 while the aforesaid=20

Spaniard, who had thus thrown the Indian into the fire was returning       =
to his dwelling the same=20

day, he suddenly fell dead in the road; and       it was my opinion, that t=
hey should not give him=20

[Christian]       burial." 21.21. "Moreover I affirm, that I myself saw the=
 Spaniards cut off the=20

hands, noses, and ears of the Indian men and women, for no purpose       wh=
atever but just=20

because the fancy struck them; and in so many       places and regions did =
this occur that it would=20

be a long story to       tell." 22.22. "I also saw the Spaniards setting do=
gs onto the Indians, to tear=20

them to pieces; and thus I saw many of them torn to pieces." 23.23. "I like=
wise saw so many=20

houses and towns burned that I could not       tell the number, so great wa=
s their multitude." 24.24.=20

"It is likewise true that they took nursing children by the arms       and =
hurled them in the air as=20

high as they could; and their other       injustice and aimless cruelties t=
errified me, besides=20

innumerable       other things that I saw, and which it would take long to =
tell." 25.25. "I saw=20

moreover that they called the Indian lords and chiefs, to       come peacea=
bly, promising them=20

safety, but as soon as they arrived       they burnt them. And in my presen=
ce they burnt "The=20

Early makers of English watches do not crowd the stage. On the Continent po=
cket clocks had had=20

a long life before they made their appearance in this country. Queen Elizab=
eth had only one pair of=20

silk stockings--she had been used to "cloth hose"--before her lady-in-waiti=
ng presented her with a=20

pair straight from the Continent. Italian and French ideas were fast acclim=
atizing themselves here.=20

Shakespeare laid many of his plays in Italy; the modern Elizabethan English=
man became quite=20

Italian; the Queen read Tasso and Ariosto in the originals. In Germany the =
watch had taken=20

various forms. The watchmakers of Nuremberg were renowned throughout Europe=
. "Nuremberg=20

eggs," as they were styled, set the fashion for watches of all shapes suite=
d to the conceits of the=20

owner. Some were in the form of a skull, with appropriate mottoes concernin=
g Time and Death;=20

others were in the form of a cross, of a book, or shaped like a tulip or ot=
her flowers, or simulating=20

butterflies and insects. The earliest styles had closed cases, these cases =
being subjected to=20

various forms of ornament. The dial was not visible till the outer case was=
 opened.  Collectors of=20

watches are collecting something that is dead. The wheels are silent for ev=
er. The interest lies in=20

the remoteness of the conception of a pocket clock. Possibly there is no on=
e alive who could now=20

set the wheels into motion, as there are no designers who could originate t=
he exquisite tracery and=20

filigree work, the perfect enamelling and the delicacy of metal work these =
old watches exhibit.=20

They belong to a world apart. Clocks of old masters still carry on their fu=
nctions: the hand still=20



revolves in unison with the slow swing of the "royal pendulum." As timekeep=
ers they equal most of=20

the modern, and excel the cheap clock, hardly worth designating as a timeke=
eper. But the Swiss=20

and the American factory-made watch, claiming no equality of artistic embel=
lishment, have=20

dethroned the antique watch in regard to accuracy. Curious and rare example=
s of the latter crowd=20

the shelves of museums as being representative of that mysterious past when=
 Time was of less=20

moment than it is now. They belong to the age of the missal and the illumin=
ated manuscript, and of=20

the advent of printing with Caxton's well-balanced page. They are at varian=
ce with modernity.=20

They were machines before the age of machinery--their very mechanism protes=
ts against being=20

regarded as scientifically accurate. One lingers over their ornament with l=
oving regard and forgets=20

their purport. As timekeepers they fell short of the abbey clock, or of the=
 sundial--a perennial=20

stickler for truth when the sun shone. When the long pendulum, under the au=
spices of Christopher=20

Huygens, commenced swinging, a timekeeper ready to hand eclipsed their gold=
 and enamelled=20

triumphs. But as fashionable baubles they had their continuous evolution, f=
rom Thomas=20

Chamberlaine de Chelmisforde to Pinchbeck, and from Tompion to Eardley Nort=
on. A=20

considerable amount of ingenuity was given to producing examples of diminut=
ive size which=20

should perform adequately the correct functions of a timekeeper. But accura=
cy and scientific=20

exactitude came late in the story of evolution. At length man's ingenuity t=
riumphed. There are=20

watches no larger than filberts which keep exact time, but there are thousa=
nds which do not.=20

which our grandfathers termed a "turnip," was the stage prior to modern dev=
elopment, and at that=20

stage collecting ends.  A scientific classification of watches would resolv=
e itself under the following=20

heads:--  I. _Early watches_, prior to the invention and general adoption o=
f the fusee, that is, from=20

about 1500 to 1540. This period would be further subdivided into (_a_) thos=
e with movements=20

entirely of steel; (_b_) the next stage, with plates and pinions of brass a=
nd the wheels and pinions=20

of steel; and the latest stage, (_c_), in which the plates and wheels were =
brass and the pinions of=20

steel, as at the present day.  II. _Watches from about 1540 to 1640_, all h=
aving fusees, and being=20

made of every conceivable shape and size: octagonal, oval, cruciform, in th=
e shape of a book, and=20

so on. The cases were sometimes of crystal or bloodstone, and enamelled des=
igns and chased=20

gold work were predominant features.  III. _Watches of the seventeenth cent=
ury_, from 1610 to=20

1675, at which date the pendulum spring was invented. These are mainly roun=
d in shape,=20

according to the fashion about 1620, which superseded the ancient quaint fo=
rms. The cases, both=20

of silver and gold, were richly enamelled, and moving calendars and astrono=
mical details were=20

frequently made.  IV. _Late seventeenth and early eighteenth century watche=
s._ These would=20

embrace the period from 1675 to 1720, after the invention of the pendulum s=
pring.  V. _The=20

eighteenth century watch._ This should=20


_
and the other in Tumbala, nor was I able for all I preached to them,       =
to prevent them burning=20

them." 26.26. "I call God and my own conscience to witness that, as far as =
I can       understand,=20

the Indians only revolted on account of this ill       treatment which suff=
iciently justified their action=20

as may be       clearly seen by everybody." 27.27. "The Spaniards have neve=
r dealt honestly with=20

them nor kept their       word but, contrary to all reason and justice, the=
y have tyrannically=20

ruined them and all their country, doing such things against them,       th=
at they [the Indians] have=20

resolved sooner to die, than suffer       such deeds." 28.28. "I say moreov=
er, that the Indians are=20

right in affirming that there       is more gold hidden, than has been disc=
overed, for they have=20

refused       to disclose it because of the injustice and cruelty shown the=
m by       the Spaniards;=20

nor will they disclose it as long as such treatment       continues, but ra=
ther will they die like the=20

others." 29.29. "God our Lord has been much offended by these deeds, and Hi=
s       Majesty very=20

badly served and defrauded, for they have made him lose       countries tha=
t could very well=20

provide food for the whole of       Castile, and in my opinion, it will be =
very difficult and expensive=20

to recover them." 30.30. All these are the formal words of the said monk; a=
nd bear the=20

signature also of the Bishop of Mexico, testifying that everything       wa=
s affirmed by the said=20

Father, Fray Marcus. 31.31. What this Father says he has seen, should be co=
nsidered here:=20

because this happened throughout fifty or a hundred leagues of       countr=
y and during nine or ten=20

years, at the beginning, when there       were very few Spaniards: afterwar=
ds the sound of gold=20

drew thither       four or five thousand Spaniards, who spread through many=
 large       kingdoms=20

and provinces, covering more than five hundred or seven       hundred leagu=
es, all of which they=20

have destroyed by practising the       same deeds and others still more fer=
ocious and cruel. 32.32.=20

Truly, from that time to the present day, a thousand times more       peopl=
e have been destroyed=20

and dispersed than he was told of; being       devoid of mercy and the fear=
 of God and the King,=20

the Spaniards have       destroyed a very large part of the human race. 33.=
33. Within the space of=20

ten years they have killed, up to the present       day, more than four mil=
lions of persons; and they=20

are still killing. 34.34. A short time since they pursued and killed a grea=
t queen, wife of       Elingue,=20

he who was left king of those kingdoms which the Christians       had tyran=
nically seized and=20

provoked to rise in the present       rebellion.  They captured the queen, =
his wife who, it is said,=20

was       pregnant and, contrary to all justice, they killed her, only to  =
     grieve her husband. 35.35.=20

If the cruelties and different murders committed by the Christians,       a=
nd their daily deeds in=20

those kingdoms of Peru were to be told,       they would doubtless be so ho=
rrible and so numerous=20

that what we       have recounted of the other countries would fade, and se=
em little,       compared=20

with their number and their gravity.                           Of the New K=
ingdom of Granada      1. In the=20

year 1539 many tyrants joined together and started from       Venezuela, Sa=
nta Marta, and=20

Cartagena for Peru: and others came back       from the same Peru to explor=
e those countries.=20

Three hundred       leagues inland behind Santa Marta and Cartagena, they f=
ound some       very=20

delightful and marvellous provinces, full of numberless people,       as mi=
ld and kind as the others,=20

and very rich in gold, and in those       precious stones called emeralds. =
 2.2. To these provinces=20

they gave the name of the new kingdom of Granada;       because those tyran=
ts who first came to=20

these countries were natives       of the kingdom of Granada in Spain.  3.3=
. As many iniquitous and=20

cruel men among those who gathered from all       parts, were notorious but=
chers and shedders of=20

human blood who were       very inured to, and experienced in the great sin=
s that we have said=20



were committed in many parts of the Indies, it follows that their       fie=
ndish operations, and the=20

circumstances and qualities that       blackened and aggravated them, were =
such that they have=20

surpassed       very many, or indeed all, that the others and they themselv=
es have       committed=20

elsewhere in the Indies.  4.4. Of the multitude they have committed in thes=
e three years, and=20

continue without ceasing to commit, I will briefly relate a few.  As       =
a man who was robbing and=20

murdering in the said kingdom would not       allow a governor to also rob =
and kill, the latter=20

brought a suit       against him, calling many witnesses to prove the slaug=
hter,       injustice, and=20

massacres he had done, and is doing; this evidence       was read, and is t=
o be found in the=20

Council of the Indies.  5.5. The witnesses in the said law-suit affirm that=
 all the kingdom was=20

quiet, and subject to the Spaniards; the Indians continually       laboured=
 to furnish them=20

provisions, and to accumulate property for       them; they brought them al=
l the gold and precious=20

emeralds they       possessed or could obtain: the lords and inhabitants of=
 the towns       had been=20

divided among the Spaniards, who lay claim to them as the       means for o=
btaining their final=20

object, which is gold.  Having thus       reduced everybody to the usual ty=
ranny and slavery, the=20

principal       tyrant captain commanding them, captured the sovereign of a=
ll that       country,=20

without any cause or reason, and kept him for six or seven       months, de=
manding gold and=20

emeralds of him.  6.6. The said king, who was called Bogota, being overcome=
 by fear said       that=20

he would give a house of the gold they demanded, hoping to free       himse=
lf from the hands of his=20

tormenters: he sent some Indians to       bring him the treasure, and sever=
al times they brought a=20

large       quantity of gold and stones: because he did not give the house =
of       gold, the Spaniards=20

declared that he should be killed, because he       did not fulfil his prom=
ise.  7.7. The tyrant said=20

that he should be tried by process of law, so they       prosecuted him, ac=
cusing the said king of=20

the country.  The tyrant       gave sentence, condemning him to tortures, i=
f he did not give the=20

house of gold.  8.8. They tortured him with the cord: they threw burning fa=
t on his       belly; they=20

put his feet in irons fastened to a stake, tied his neck       to another, =
while two men held his hands;=20

and in this position they       put fire to his feet.  9.9. Every now and t=
hen, the tyrant entered and=20

told him, that they would       kill him by inches with tortures if he did =
not give the gold.  And=20

thus they did, and killed this lord with tortures.  While they were       t=
ormenting him, God gave a=20

sign of destestation of that cruelty, by       causing all that town, where=
 it was committed to be=20

burnt. 10.10. The other Spaniards imitated their good captain and, since th=
ey       only know how to=20

rend these people, they did the same; torturing the       lord of the town =
or towns, that had been=20

confided to them, with       divers and fierce tortures while those lords a=
nd their people felt=20

themselves safe, and were giving them all the gold and emeralds they       =
could: the Spaniards=20

tortured them only to extort more gold and       jewels.  And in this way t=
hey burnt and cut to pieces=20

all the lords       of that country. 11.11. Terror-stricken by the excessiv=
e cruelty practised upon the=20

Indians       by one of those particular tyrants a great lord called Daytam=
a fled,       with many of his=20

people from such inhumanity, and retreated to the       mountains.  This, i=
f it did but avail, they=20

conceive to be the       remedy and refuge, and this is what the Spaniards =
call revolt and=20

rebellion. 12.12. The principal tyrant captain hearing this, sent a force t=
o that       cruel man, whose=20

ferocity and wickedness towards the peaceful and       submissive Indians h=
ad driven them to the=20

mountains; the latter went       in pursuit of the natives, and because it =
sufficed not to hide in=20

the bowels of the earth, they found a large number of people whom       the=
y killed, cutting to=20



pieces more than five hundred men, women,       and children, and sparing n=
o one. 13.13. The=20

witnesses also say that before his death, the same Prince       Daytama had=
 been to see that cruel=20

man and had taken him four or       five thousand crowns, but notwithstandi=
ng this, he committed=20

the       said slaughter. 14.14. Another time a great number of people havi=
ng come to serve the=20

Spaniards, and feeling themselves safe, serving with their humility       a=
nd simplicity, the captain=20

entered the town one night where the       Indians were and commanded that =
all those Indians=20

should be put to       the sword while some of them were sleeping, and some=
 supping and=20

resting from the labours of the day. 15.15. He perpetrated this massacre be=
cause it seemed good=20

to him to make       himself feared by all the people of the country. 16.16=
. Another time the captain=20

put all the Spaniards on oath, to lead at       once as many lords and chie=
fs and common people as=20

each had in his       household service, to the square, where he had all th=
eir heads cut       off, thus=20

killing four or five hundred people.  And the witnesses       say that he t=
hought in this way to pacify=20

the country. 17.17. The witnesses depose that one particular tyrant did gre=
at cruelty,       killing,=20

and cutting off the hands and noses of many men and women,       and destro=
ying many people.=20

18.18. Another time the captain sent the afore-named cruel man, with       =
certain Spaniards to the=20

province of Bogota, to make inquiry as to       who had succeeded to that d=
ominion since they had=20

tortured the       universal lord to death: he marched through many leagues=
 of country,=20

capturing as many Indians as he could. 19.19. And because the people did no=
t show him the lord=20

who had succeeded,       he cut off the hands of some and gave others to fe=
rocious dogs,=20

which tore them to pieces both men, and women; and in this way he       kil=
led, and destroyed=20

many Indian men and women. 20.20. One day, near sunrise, he went to attack =
some lords, or=20

captains       and many Indians who felt tranquil and secure, because he ha=
d       assured them=20

and given them his word that they should receive no       hurt or harm; con=
fiding in this assurance=20

they had come down from       the mountains, where they were hidden, to dwe=
ll in this town on the=20

plain; thus he captured a great many of these unsuspecting and       confid=
ing people, women and=20

men, and making them put their hands       flat on the ground he himself cu=
t them off with a=20

scimitar, saying       that improvements, changes in decorative style, and =
other details bringing the=20

watch up to the threshold of the nineteenth century and modernity.  We can =
only indicate the type=20

of watch as falling under the various periods, and specimens of the leading=
 types are illustrated=20

(pp. 283, 287).  The watches are numbered in the illustrations from one to =
ten, and can thus be=20

fine case shows the quality of the chased and repousse open-work design.  _=
No. 2_ is a James I=20

oval watch, and the maker is Yate, of London. This watch is dated 1620, in =
the reign of James I,=20

the year when the _Mayflower_ sailed to America and New England was founded=
 by those wise=20

Puritans who foresaw the oncoming civil war of the next reign. The Earl of =
Ashburnham exhibited=20

at the Stuart Exhibition in 1889 a gold watch which formerly belonged to Ch=
arles I, inscribed=20

"Henricus Jones, Londini." Another maker of watches of this period is Edwar=
d East. The silver=20



alarum clock given by Charles I on his way to execution to Thomas Herbert w=
as made by Edward=20

East. "Through the garden the King passed into the park, where making a sta=
nd, he asked Mr.=20

Herbert the hour of the day: and taking the clock into his hand, gave it hi=
m, and bade him keep it in=20

memory of him." This silver alarum watch is still treasured in the Mitford =
family.  _No. 3_ is a=20

Cromwellian silver watch, plum-shaped. As coats of arms were not so sinful =
as painted cherubs=20

and stained-glass windows, this bauble with elaborately engraved crest surv=
ived the wreckers'=20

despoiling hand. Cromwell himself boasted of a crest, and in some respects =
it resembled that used=20

by royalty.  _No. 4_ is a Restoration watch made by Snow, of Lavington, nea=
r Bath. It exhibits fine=20

ornamentation and is a beautiful specimen of Late Stuart style when sumptuo=
usness, under the=20

guiding influence of the French Louis Quatorze grandeur, made itself felt i=
n this country.  _No. 5_=20

is worthy of respect and admiration as being the work of that great maker, =
Thomas Tompion. It is=20

of the William and Mary period. The craftsman had arrived at the period of =
a scientific endeavour=20

to create a perfect timekeeper. The case indicates utility; ornament is in =
due subjection. The=20

Arabic figures showing the seconds on the dial should be observed.  _No. 6_=
, of which the back is=20

shown, is a watch by Peter Garon. It is in black pique case, finely decorat=
ed in a subdued and=20

reticent manner. Peter Garon flourished between 1694 and 1706. But in that =
year, when=20

Marlborough's campaigns were at their full height, poor Garon felt the stre=
ss of commercial=20

depression and became bankrupt.  _No. 7_, showing the front and open case, =
is a fine watch by=20

Duhamel, about 1740, bringing us to the days of George I and Walpole.  _No.=
 8_, with its fine=20

broad repousse case, is by Haydon, and the case is signed "V. Haut."  _No. =
9_ shows an=20

illustration of the back, where the movement is visible. The maker of this =
is Daniels, of Leighton,=20

1760.  _No. 10_ is by Kemp, London, and is decorated in Battersea enamel an=
d shagreen. This=20

brings us to the age of Pinchbeck, "the toyman in the Strand," and suggests=
 the gewgaws and=20

trifles, the enamelled heads for malacca canes, the snuff-boxes, and all th=
e fashionable=20

paraphernalia of a man about town. The watch in some respects had begun to =
lose its old=20

character and was again a toy.  [Illustration: CALENDAR WATCH. SEVENTEENTH =

He worked in the brightest days of Charles I, when the arts were receiving =
stimulation from the=20

Court. A new era seemed as though it might be about to dawn. The picture ga=
llery of Charles I at=20

Hampton Court showed his catholic taste, and his Queen, Henrietta Maria, wa=
s a patron of the=20

arts. Vandyck and other great artists flocked to this country, and highly t=
rained craftsmen=20

commenced to build a reputation which later iconoclasts swept aside as of B=
aal.  In the watch=20

illustrated by Thomas Chamberlaine there is something delightfully simple a=
nd chaste. He was a=20

maker whose work promised much. There is a specimen of his work signed "Cha=
mberlain=20

Chelmisford" at the British Museum, but in the specimen illustrated the nam=
e is chased "Thomas=20

Chamberlaine de Chelmisforde."  The study of watches of the various periods=
 is a fascinating one.=20

When the collector leaves the path of clocks, with their more Gargantuan pr=
oportions, to become a=20

student of the intricacies of the art of the watchmaker as exemplified in s=
