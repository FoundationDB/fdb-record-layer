 his intentions undisclosed,=20

and bequeath a negative legacy of trouble, distrust, suspicion, heart-burni=

rs contended that=20

there was nothing remarkable in a solicitor's not making a will. These pers=
ons may be divided into=20

two classes. One lot cynically remarked that shoemakers' children were usua=
lly worse shod than=20

other brats; that the offspring of tailors were to be usually known by the =
seediness of their=20

costume; that publicans never drank the liquors they vended; that parsons r=
arely illustrated, by=20

their practice the virtues they taught in their pulpits; and that a lawyer =
should betray a crowning=20

want of prudence was not, therefore, wonderful. This was the reasoning by w=
hich some were led=20

up to the belief that Mr. Franklin had certainly not made a will. Another l=

that all the land to the southward has been produced partly by slow upheava=

and partly by the alluvial deposits of the river and the gradual extension =
of its delta, which now=20

projects many miles into the gulf. This would account for the low and swamp=
