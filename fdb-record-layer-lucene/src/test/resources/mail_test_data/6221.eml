is daily withdrawn, and stretched out with pegs upon the ground; _
hands, utterly regardless of all remonstrance (which, being in English, he =
did not understand), he=20

quickly hauled our turtle to the surface, and held it, struggling and gnash=
ing its jaws, close to the=20

steep bank. In a few moments the line slackened, and the turtle disappeared=
. The fight was over!=20

The sharp horny jaws had bitten through treble-twisted brass wire as clean =
as though cut by=20

shears. My visions of turtle soup had faded.  The heavy fish were not in th=
e humour to take; I=20

therefore shot one with a rifle as it came to the surface to blow, and, the=
 water in this spot being=20

shallow, we brought it to shore; it was a species of carp, between thirty a=
nd forty pounds; the=20

scales were rather larger than a crown piece, and so hard that they would h=
ave been difficult to=20

pierce with a harpoon. It proved to be useless for the table, being of an o=
ily nature that was only=20

acceptable to the Arabs.  In the evening I went out stalking in the desert,=
 and returned with five=20

fine buck gazelles. These beautiful creatures so exactly resemble the colou=
r of the sandy deserts=20

which they inhabit, that they are most difficult to distinguish, and their =
extreme shyness renders=20

stalking upon foot very uncertain. I accordingly employed an Arab to lead a=
 camel, under cover of=20

which I could generally manage to approach within a hundred yards. A buck g=
azelle weighs from=20

sixty to seventy pounds, and is the perfection of muscular development. No =
person who has seen=20

the gazelles in confinement in a temperate climate can form an idea of the =
beauty of the animal in=20

its native desert. Born in the scorching sun, nursed on the burning sand of=
 the treeless and=20

shadowless wilderness, the gazelle is among the antelope tribe as the uncom=
mon one. It will wear=20

off with returning health. King George IV believed that he was at the battl=
e of Waterloo, and indeed=20

commanded there; and his friends were at one time a little alarmed; but Kni=
ghton, who was a=20

sensible man, said, =E2=80=98His majesty has only to leave off Curacao, and=
 rest assured he will gain no=20

more victories.=E2=80=99 The rest of this statement, which is to-day offici=
ally communicated to the whole=20

world, and which in its results will probably be not less important even th=
an the celebration of the=20

centenary of St. Peter, is established by evidence so incontestable=E2=80=
=94by witnesses so numerous,=20

so various=E2=80=94in all the circumstances and accidents of testimony so s=
atisfactory=E2=80=94I may say so=20

irresistible, that controversy on this head would be a mere impertinence an=
d waste of time.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am=20

not convinced,=E2=80=9D said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CHush!=E2=80=9D said the car=
dinal; =E2=80=9Cthe freaks of your own mind about=20

personal incidents, however lamentable, may be viewed with indulgence=E2=80=
=94at least for a time. But=20

you cannot be permitted to doubt of the rest. You must be convinced, and on=
 reflection you will be=20

convinced. Remember, sir, where you are. You are in the centre of Christend=
om, where truth, and=20

where alone truth resides. Divine authority has perused this paper and appr=
oved it. It is published=20

for the joy and satisfaction of two hundred millions of Christians, and for=
 the salvation of all those=20

who, unhappily for themselves, are not yet converted to the faith. It recor=
ds the most memorable=20

event of this century. Our Blessed Lady has personally appeared to her vota=
ries before during that=20

period, but never at Rome. Wisely and well she has worked in villages and a=
mong the illiterate as=20

at the beginning did her Divine Son. But=20


_
superlative beauty of the race. The skin is as sleek as satin, of a colour =
difficult to describe, as it=20

varies between the lightest mauve and yellowish brown; the belly is snow-wh=
ite; the legs, from the=20

knee downwards, are also white, and are as fine as though carved from ivory=
; the hoof is=20

beautifully shaped, and tapers to a sharp point; the head of the buck is or=
namented by gracefully-

curved annulated horns, perfectly black, and generally from nine to twelve =
inches long in the bend;=20

the eye is the well-known perfection--the full, large, soft, and jet-black =
eye of the gazelle. Although=20

the desert appears incapable of supporting animmial life, there are in the =
undulating surface=20

numerous shallow sandy ravines, in which are tufts of a herbage so coarse t=
hat, as a source of=20

nourishment, it would be valueless to a domestic animal: nevertheless, upon=
 this dry and wiry=20

substance the delicate gazelles subsist; and, although they never fatten, t=
hey are exceedingly=20

fleshy and in excellent condition. Entirely free from fat, and nevertheless=
 a mass of muscle and=20

sinew, the gazelle is the fastest of the antelope tribe. Proud of its stren=
gth, and confident in its=20

agility, it will generally bound perpendicularly four or five feet from the=
 ground several times before=20

it starts at full speed, as though to test the quality of its sinews before=
 the race. The Arabs course=20

them with greyhounds, and sometimes they are caught by running several dogs=
 at the same time;=20

but this result is from the folly of the gazelle, who at first distances hi=
s pursuers like the wind; but,=20

secure in its speed, it halts and faces the dogs, exhausting itself by boun=
ding exultingly in the air;=20

in the meantime the greyhounds are closing up, and diminishing the chance o=
f escape. As a rule,=20

notwithstanding this absurdity of the ripe for terminating the infidelity o=
f the world. In the eternal=20

city, amid all its matchless learning and profound theology, in the sight o=
f thousands, this great act=20

has been accomplished, in a manner which can admit of no doubt, and which c=
an lead to no=20

controversy. Some of the most notorious atheists of Rome have already solic=
ited to be admitted to=20

the offices of the Church; the secret societies have received their deathbl=
ow; I look to the=20

alienation of England as virtually over. I am panting to see you return to =
the home of your fathers,=20

and re-conquer it for the Church in the name of the Lord God of Sabaoth. Ne=
ver was a man in a=20

greater position since Godfrey or Ignatius. The eyes of all Christendom are=
 upon you as the most=20

favored of men, and you stand there like Saint Thomas.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CP=
erhaps he was as bewildered as I am,=E2=80=9D=20

said Lothair.  =E2=80=9CWell, his bewilderment ended in his becoming an apo=
stle, as yours will. I am glad=20

we have had this conversation, and that we agree; I knew we should. But now=
 I wish to speak to=20

you on business, and very grave. The world assumes that, being the favored =
of Heaven, you are=20

naturally and necessarily a member of the Church. I, your late guardian, kn=
ow that is not the case,=20

and sometimes I blame myself that it is not so. But I have ever scrupulousl=
y refrained from=20

attempting to control your convictions; and the result has justified me. He=
aven has directed your=20

life, and I have now to impart to you the most gratifying intelligence that=
 can be communicated by=20

man, and that the Holy Father will to-morrow himself receive you into the b=
osom of that Church of=20

which he is the divine head. Christendom will then hail you as its champion=
 and regenerator, and=20

thus will be realized the divine dream with which you were inspired in our =
morning walk in the park=20

at=20


_
the best of the race, and the greyhounds return crestfallen and beaten. Alt=
ogether it is the most=20

beautiful specimen of game that exists, far too lovely and harmless to be h=
unted and killed for the=20

mere love of sport. But when dinner depends upon the rifle, beauty is no pr=
otection; accordingly,=20

throughout our desert march we lived upon gazelles, and I am sorry to confe=
ss that I became very=20

expert at stalking these wary little animals. The flesh, although tolerably=
 good, has a slight flavour=20

of musk; this is not peculiar to the gazelle, as the odour is common to mos=
t of the small varieties of=20

antelopes.  Having a good supply of meat, all hands were busily engaged in =
cutting it into strips=20

and drying it for future use; the bushes were covered with festoons of fles=
h of gazelles and=20

hippopotami, and the skins of the former were prepared for making girbas, o=
r water-sacks. The=20

CHAPTER 69 It was the darkest hour in Lothair=E2=80=99s life. He had become=
 acquainted with sorrow; he=20

had experienced calamities physical and moral. The death of Theodora had sh=
aken him to the=20

centre. It was that first great grief which makes a man acquainted with his=
 deepest feelings, which=20

detracts something from the buoyancy of the youngest life, and dims, to a c=
ertain degree, the=20

lustre of existence. But even that bereavement was mitigated by distraction=
s alike inevitable and=20

ennobling. The sternest and highest of all obligations, military duty, clai=
med him with an unfaltering=20

grasp, and the clarion sounded almost as he closed her eyes. Then he went f=
orth to struggle for a=20

cause which at least she believed to be just and sublime; and if his own co=
nvictions on that head=20

might be less assured or precise, still there was doubtless much that was i=
nspiring in the contest,=20


_
operation, as the knife must be so dexterously used that no false cut shoul=
d injure the hide. The=20

animal is hung up by the hind legs; an incision is then made along the insi=
de of both thighs to the=20

tail, and with some trouble the skin is drawn off the body towards the head=
, precisely as a stocking=20

might be drawn from the leg; by this operation the skin forms a seamless ba=
g, open at both ends.=20

To form a success of himself and his comrades that tended to the elevation =
of man.  But, now,=20

there was not a single circumstance to sustain his involved and sinking lif=
e. A renegade=E2=80=94a=20

renegade without conviction, without necessity, in absolute violation of th=
e pledge he had given to=20

the person he most honored and most loved, as he received her parting spiri=
t. And why was all=20

this? and how was all this? What system=20
