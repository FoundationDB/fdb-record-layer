meeting-place. He had drawn a chair to the balustrade, and was glooming tho=
ughtfully down at the=20

lobby gathering, upon which even the lateness of the hour appeared to have =
no dispersing effect,=20

when a mellow voice behind him said: "Well, son, taking a quiet little squi=
nt at the menagerie?"=20

Blount got up and gave the speaker his chair, dragging up another for himse=
lf. The senator sat=20

down and stretched his great frame like a man wearied. "Ah, Lord!" he said.=
 "The old man isn't as=20

young as he used to be, Evan, boy. There was a time once when eleven o'cloc=
k didn't seem any=20

later to me than it does now to you; but it's gone by, son, and I don't rec=
kon it'll ever come back=20

again."  Blount drew his chair nearer. "I have a hard thing to say to you t=
o-night, dad," he began,=20

"and you mustn't make it harder by speaking of your--of the things that get=
 near to me. I am a man=20

grown, and a Blount, like yourself; I want you to give me back those papers=
 which your dynamiter=20

or somebody else in your pay took from my office safe three nights ago."  T=
he senator's eyes=20

lighted with the gentle smile, and the tips of the great mustaches twitched=
 slightly.  "So McVickar's=20

been telling tales out of school, has he?" he inquired half-jocularly.  "I =
have had no communication=20

with Mr. McVickar. It wasn't and all the countries of the Red Sea had been =
treated historically and=20

geographically; and though the passengers still occupied the promenade, no =
more conferences=20

were needed for the present. But it became a place for conversation, and al=
l kinds of subjects=20

were discussed there.  The commander pointed out the location of all the im=
portant places, or=20

where any notable event had occurred; but none of them were of any great co=
nsequence, and=20

they were too far off to be seen distinctly. The ship had reached the wides=
t part of the sea, and all=20

the rest of the course to the entrance was through the deep water in the mi=
ddle; for the shores=20

were studded with reefs, reaching out from forty to sixty miles from the la=
nd.  "How deep is the=20

water here, Captain Ringgold?" asked Dr. Hawkes, at one of these conversati=
on parties on the=20

third day from Suez.  "The last time I looked at the chart, just on the par=
allel of 20 deg. of north=20

latitude, the sounding was 500 fathoms," replied the commander.  "Indeed? T=
hat is 3,000 feet; I=20

did not suppose it was so deep as that," added the doctor.  "The bottom is =
very irregular in all=20

parts of the Red Sea; and in some places it is more than double the figure =
just mentioned. When=20

we were about sixty miles north of Jiddah, the sounding was 1,054 fathoms, =
or=20


_
is it needful for us to go aside out of the straight road. I want those pap=
ers. They are mine, and=20

they were stolen."  The elder man smiled again. "What if I should say that =
I haven't got 'em, son--

what then?" he asked mildly.  "I don't want you to say that. I want to beli=
eve that, however bitter=20

this fight may grow, we shall still speak the truth to each other."  There =
was silence for a little=20

"How deep has the water been found to be in the ocean?"  "As much as 4,000 =
fathoms of line=20

have been paid out, with no bottom as the result. Soundings of 3,000 fathom=
s have been=20

obtained. In the library you will find the 'Cruise of the Challenger,' whic=
h is the latest authority on=20

this subject."  "I shall refer to it; thank you, Captain."  "On a little ro=
