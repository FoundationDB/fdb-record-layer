But he only said, "It reads a devilish sight better than plain Skinner, doe=
s n't it?"  "Well," said the=20

clerk, trying to be consoling and diplomatic and failing in both, "you must=
 n't always judge a man=20

by his name."  After breakfast next morning Skinner and Honey remained in t=
heir rooms, waiting=20

for the message that was to come from the Wilkinsons, for Skinner had recko=
ned that any friend of=20

the Colbys would receive prompt attention.  "She'll call you up, Honey, and=
 ask us to dine to-night.=20

There, there, don't ask any questions.  I've figured it all out.  But we're=
 engaged until Saturday."=20

"Engaged every night?  Why, Dearie, this is only Wednesday.  You had n't to=
ld me anything about=20

it."  "Quite right," said Skinner, "I had not."  "What are we going to do?"=
  "I have no plans.  I a=20

quarrel is always painful for the third person; and it was so entirely unex=
pected, out of the way of=20

all his habits, that Beaufort felt himself exceptionally incapable of deali=
ng with it. "Millefleurs," he=20

said with hesitation, "I don't understand all this. That was a very strange=
 tone to take in speaking=20

to--a friend."  He felt for the first time like a tutor discharging an unco=
mfortable office, knowing that=20

it must be done, yet that he was not the man to do it, and that of all the =
youthful individuals in the=20

world, the last person to be so lectured was Millefleurs.  "Naturally you t=
hink so. The=20

circumstances make all the difference, don't you know," said Millefleurs, w=
ith his ordinary=20

composure. "And the situation. In 'Frisco it might not have been of any gre=
at consequence.=20

Helping=20


_
theater."  "Well," said Honey, "it beats me."  On reading the morning paper=
, Mrs. J. Matthews=20

Wilkinson said to her husband, "They're here--the Skinners--Jennie Colby's =
friends, you know. We=20

must have them to dinner."  "When?" said Wilkinson, looking up from his pap=
er.  "I dare say they'll=20

be here but a short time.  Better make it to-night."  "You're the doctor," =
said Wilkinson, resuming=20

his paper.  "We'll send out a hurry call for the Armitages and the Bairds a=
nd the Wendells," said=20

Mrs. Wilkinson, mentally running over her list of the most select of St. Pa=
ul's inner circle.  "We'll=20

show these people that we're not barbarians out here."  "Can you corral all=
 those folks for to-night?=20

Is n't it rather sudden, my dear?"  "I've dined with them on shorter notice=
 than that, just to=20

accommodate them.  I 'll call up the Skinners right away."  Honey answered =
the 'phone.  Of course=20

they'd be delighted to dine at the Wilkinsons, but every night was filled u=
p to Saturday.  A pause.=20

Hold Saturday for them?  She should say they would.  There was another it's=
 never hushed up. No=20

one makes a secret of it: that is the thing that sets one's blood up, don't=
 you know. Not for=20

Torrance's sake--who, so far as I can make out, was a cad--or poor Lady Car=
's, to whom it's=20

something like a deliverance----"  "Torrance!" cried Beaufort, with a gasp.=
 "Lady--Car! Do you=20

mean to say----"  "Then----" said Millefleurs, "he never told you? That is =
a curious piece of=20

evidence. They do things straightforward in Denver City--not like that. He =
never spoke of an event=20

which had made the country ring----"  "Torrance!" repeated Beaufort, bewild=
ered. The world=20

seemed all to reel about him. He gazed at his companion with eyes wide open=
ed but scarcely=20

capable of vision. By-and-by he sat down abruptly on the nearest chair. He =
did not hear what=20

Millefleurs was saying. Presently he turned to him, interrupting him uncons=
ciously. "Torrance!" he=20

repeated; "let there be no mistake. You mean the man--to whom Carry--Lady C=
aroline--was=20

married?"  Millefleurs fixed upon him his little keen black eyes. He recall=
ed to himself tones and=20


_
and turned to Skinner.  "Can we take a spin with them this afternoon, Deari=
e?"  "You bet.  We've=20

nothing else to do."  "You fraud," said Honey, when she had hung up the rec=
eiver, "you said you=20

had engagements."  "I tried to convey to you," observed Skinner, somewhat l=
oftily, "that we=20

couldn't dine at the Wilkinsons' before Saturday.  That covers it, I think.=
"  According to Skinner's=20

plans, the dinner at the Wilkinsons' was to be the big, climactic drive at =
the fortress of Willard=20

Jackson's stubbornness.  As Skinner had reckoned, Mrs. Curmudgeon W. Jackso=
n nosed out the=20

paragraph in the morning paper, first thing.  "Who is this Mr. Skinner, Wil=
lard?  Do you know him?"=20

"What Skinner?"  had not been able to put any interpretation. He nodded his=
 head without saying=20

anything. He was as keen after any piece of human history as a hound on a s=
cent. And now he=20

was too much interested, too eager for new information, to speak.  "And it =
happened," said=20

Beaufort, "on Thursday--on the day I arrived?" He drew a long breath to rel=
ieve his breast, then=20

waved his hand. "Yes; if that is all, Erskine told me of it," he said.  "Yo=
u have something to do with=20

them also, old fellow," said Millefleurs, patting him on the shoulder. "I k=
new there was something.=20

Come along and walk with me. I must see it out; but perhaps we had better n=
ot meet again just=20

now--Erskine and I, don't you know.=20
