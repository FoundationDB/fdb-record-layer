with a humorous little scowl: "Now see here, young woman, the sooner you le=
arn that every=20

apartment in this city has a complete equipment of ghosts, the better it wi=
ll be for you. I don't care=20

who lived here, nor how she lived nor what she said. I don't need her advic=
e, and her life is not to=20

affect mine in the slightest!" She stopped short. Of whom was she speaking,=
 Mrs. Grewe or Amy?=20

There were two of them now! Both had given her advice, and in each case the=
 life portrayed had=20

been very much alike, so much so as to be rather disturbing. Things were ce=
rtainly queer in this=20

town!  "Very well, my dears," she said amiably, "if I must be haunted, it's=
 much more gay and=20

sociable to have two instead of one. Remember tea will be served at five, a=
nd from the present=20

outlook there's little chance of our being disturbed by the intrusion of an=
y live woman in New=20

York."  "At least the ghosts are friendly." She suddenly compressed her lip=
s and looked about:=20

"However!" She went to the telephone in the hall: "Please hurry up those po=
rters! I'm up here=20

waiting to begin!"  And in the days that followed, she was far too engrosse=
d in "settling" to spare=20

any time for brooding on phantoms. "A home of my own and a life of my own, =
to be lived with my=20

own husband!" But when at last they were settled, and Joe in a dear, genial=
 mood had gone about=20

admiring, and taking no notice apparently of the scarcity of Amy's things--=
he turned to Ethel with=20

an air which was meant to be easy and natural:  "Well, now that we're takin=
g a fresh start, the time=20

has come for a little talk."  "What about?" she asked, endeavouring to make=
 her smile as easy as=20

his.  "It will take about one minute." His gruff voice was low and kind. "I=
'm not going to force my=20

friends on you. If you want to make friends of your own, go ahead. And when=
 you get them let me=20

know--and they'll be mine, too, if I have to break a leg in the effort. I'l=
l dance in front of them, so to=20

speak, until they're all enchanted. But in the meantime, on your side, I wa=
nt you to let me down=20

easy with these people I once knew. I don't want to hurt them or be a cad. =
A few I may keep in=20

touch with for years."   "Fanny!" flashed into Ethel's mind.  "And all I as=
k of you is this. You'll soon=20

be going away for the summer. Let's do the decent thing--just once--and hav=
e a little party here. I=20

give you my word we won't do it again."  "All right, Joe--that's fair, of c=
ourse--and I'll do my best to=20

make it exactly what you want."  And in the dinner that she gave, Ethel liv=
ed up to her bargain.=20

The dinner was large; there were twenty guests. The caterer was as before, =
and so were the food=20

and the flowers. And all through the evening Ethel was gracious and affable=
. But behind her=20

affability, hidden but subtly conveyed to each guest, was a serene good-bye=
 to them. This was=20

their dismissal. Did they all feel it, every one? To her at least it seemed=
 so. Again and again she=20

caught the men throwing looks of regret at Joe, and the women glancing abou=
t the rooms as=20

though in search of what was gone. Amy's things! Oh, more than that. The wh=
ole atmosphere was=20

gone. This was the home of the second wife.  "Well, dear, did I live up to =
our bargain?" she asked=20

her husband when they were alone.  "You did," said Joe. He looked at her th=
en in such a puzzled,=20

masculine fashion. What she had done and how she had done it was plainly su=
ch a mystery to=20

him. "You did," he repeated loyally. She slipped her arms about his neck.  =
"Thank you, love," she=20

answered. And in a moment or two she murmured, "Have them again in the Fall=
 if you like."  "No,"=20

said Joe. "Once was enough."   "Now," she asked herself the next day, "let'=
s try to see what all this=20

means." She was almost speaking aloud. She was growing so accustomed to the=
se sociable little=20

chats with herself. "It means that I am getting on. But Fanny Carr will sti=
ll be about. She won't=20

come here except just enough to keep up appearances, but she'll still have =
her business dealings=20

with Joe in the management of her property. He means to keep in touch, he s=
aid, 'with a few of=20



them'--meaning her, of course--and his tone conveyed quite plainly that I a=
m to leave him alone in=20

that until I can produce friends of my own. Whereupon, my dear," she threw =
up her hands, "we=20

come back to exactly the same point at which we have been all along. Where =
am I going to find=20

friends?" And she gave an angry, baffled sigh. "Oh, damn New York!"  As she=
 glared viciously=20

about the pretty, sunny living room, the image of its former tenant rose up=
 in her memory. And=20

Ethel's expression changed at once, became intent and thoughtful. How much =
more attractive was=20

Mrs. Grewe than were any of Amy's set. Immoral? Yes, decidedly. But what di=
d "immoral" mean in=20

this town? Who was moral? Fanny Carr? Did these wives and divorcees do any =
good with their=20

"moral" lives? She recalled what Mrs. Grewe had said: "And whether you marr=
y or whether you=20

don't, for the life of me I can't see any difference." And again: "With you=
r face and figure, my dear,=20

you don't have to put up with any one man." Ethel sat frowning straight bef=
ore her.  "What kind of=20

a life am I going to find? I'm going to stay with my husband--that's sure. =
I'm in love with him and he=20

with me. That much is decided."  She rose abruptly, and walking the floor s=
he firmly resolved to=20

"be wholesome" and look on the bright side of things. In the next few weeks=
 she busied herself=20

described in Schedule A, on the payment of a fee not exceeding =C2=A35, are=
 entitled to register on the=20

production to the registrar of the branch council for England, Scotland, or=
 Ireland the document=20

conferring or evidencing the qualification in respect whereof he seeks to b=
e registered, or upon=20

transmitting by post to such registrar information of his name and address,=
 and evidence of his=20

qualifications and of the time or times at which they were obtained. The se=
veral colleges and=20

bodies mentioned in Schedule A may transmit from time to time to the regist=
rar, under their=20

respective seals, lists of the persons who by grant of such colleges and bo=
dies respectively, are=20

for the time being entitled to register, stating the qualifications and res=
idences of such persons,=20

and it shall be lawful for the registrar on the payment of the said fee to =
enter in the register the=20

persons mentioned in such lists with their qualifications and places of res=
idences as therein stated=20

without other application (_ib._, s. 15).  The general council is required =
to make orders for=20

regulating the registers from time to time (_ib._, s. 16).  Persons actuall=
y practising medicine in=20

England before August 1st, 1815, were entitled to register under the act (_=
ib._, s. 17).  Any two or=20

more of the colleges and bodies in the United Kingdom mentioned in Schedule=
 A may, with the=20

sanction and under the direction of the general council, unite or co-operat=
e in conducting the=20

examinations required for qualifications to be registered (_ib._, s. 19, 37=
 and 38 Vict., c. 34).  The=20

privy council may suspend the right of registration in respect of qualifica=
tions granted by any=20

college or body (_ib._, s. 21).  After such revocation, no person shall be =
entitled to register in=20

respect to any qualification granted by such college before revocation (_ib=
._, s. 22).  The privy=20

council may issue an injunction directing any body entitled to grant qualif=
ications to desist from=20

imposing upon any candidate for examination an obligation to adopt or refra=
in from adopting the=20

practice of any particular theory of medicine or surgery as a test or condi=
tion of admitting him to=20

examination or granting him a certificate; and in the event of their not co=
mplying, may order that=20

such body cease to have the power of conferring a right to be registered so=
 long as they shall=20

continue such practice (_ib._, s. 23).  Where any person entitled to be reg=
istered applies to the=20

registrar of any branch council for that purpose, such registrar is require=
d forthwith to enter in a=20

local register the name and place of residence, and the qualifications in r=
espect of which the=20

person is so entitled and the date of registration; and in case of the bran=
ch council for Scotland or=20



Ireland, to send to the registrar of the general council a copy of the entr=
y, and the registrar of the=20

general council is required to cause the same to be entered in the general =
register; and such=20

registrar is required to cause all entries made in the local register for E=
ngland to be entered in the=20

general register (_ib._, s. 25).  No qualification is entered on the regist=
er, on the first registration or=20

by way of addition to a regular name, unless the registrar be satisfied by =
proper evidence that the=20

person claiming it is entitled to it. Any appeal from the decision of the r=
egistrar may be decided by=20

the general council or by the council for England, Scotland, or Ireland, as=
 the case may be. Any=20

entry proved to the satisfaction of such general council or branch council =
to have been fraudulently=20

or incorrectly made may be erased from the register by an order in writing =
of such general council=20

or branch council (_ib._, s. 26).  MEDICAL REGISTER.=E2=80=94The registrar =
of the general council is=20

required to cause to be printed, published, and sold under the direction of=
 such council, every=20

year, a correct register of the names with the respective residences and me=
dical titles, diplomas,=20

and qualifications conferred by any corporation or university or by a docto=
rate of the Archbishop of=20

Canterbury, with the dates thereof, of all persons appearing on the general=
 register as existing on=20

January 1st in every year. Such register is called the _Medical Register_, =
and a copy of the=20

_Medical Register_ for the time being is evidence that the persons therein =
specified are registered=20

according to the act, and the absence of the name of any person from such c=
opy is evidence, until=20

the contrary be made to appear, that such person is not so registered; prov=
ided, that in the case of=20

any person whose name does not appear in such copy, a certified copy under =
the hand of the=20

registrar of the general council or a branch council of the entry of the na=
me of such person on the=20

general or local register shall be evidence that such person is so register=
ed (_ib._, s. 27).  If any=20

college or body exercise any power it possess of striking off from its list=
 the name of any one of its=20

members, it shall signify his name to the general council and the said coun=
cil may, if they see fit,=20

direct the registrar to erase from the register the qualification derived f=
rom such college or body in=20

respect of which such member was registered, and the registrar shall note t=
he same therein, but=20

the name of no person shall be erased from the register on the ground of hi=
s having adopted any=20

theory of medicine or surgery (_ib._, s. 28).  If any registered medical pr=
actitioner shall be=20

convicted in=20


_
plenty to occupy her mind. There were finishing touches to give to the room=
s; there were Spring=20

clothes to buy for Susette; and the baby was ready for short dresses and a =
baby carriage. There=20

was the life in the nursery, a cheerful little world in itself. There was M=
artha, grown more friendly=20

now, and Emily and the new waitress, Anne, and the telephone girl and the c=
hauffeur and the=20

clerks in various shops who had become acquaintances--altogether quite a ci=
rcle of people who=20

greeted Ethel on her rounds. One day as she passed a laundry shop she spied=
 this sign in the=20

window: "Fine linen respectfully treated." And Ethel chuckled at the though=
t that she herself was=20

treated like that. On the whole it was rather pleasant, though, and she mad=
e the most of it. She=20

was being carefully "wholesome."  Now it was well along in June, time for t=
he children to go to the=20

seashore, so she began to hunt for a place. At the traveller's bureaus she =
visited she found the=20

clerks more than ready to give advice by the hour to this gracious young cr=
eature so stylishly clad.=20

And she had soon selected a quiet little resort in Rhode Island.  But what =
was Joe doing all this=20

time? She did not mean to keep prying, but for the life of her she Ireland =
of any felony or=20

misdemeanor, or in Scotland of any crime or offence, or shall be after due =
inquiry judged by the=20

general council to have been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional=
 respect, the general=20

council may, if they see fit, direct the registrar to erase the name of suc=
h medical practitioner from=20

the register (_ib._, s. 29).  Every person registered who may have obtained=
 any higher degree or=20

other qualification is entitled to have it inserted in the register in subs=
titution for or in addition to his=20

qualification previously registered, on the payment of such fee as the coun=
cil may appoint (_ib._,=20

s. 30).  COMPENSATION.=E2=80=94No person is entitled to receive for any med=
ical or surgical advice, or=20

attendance, or for the performance of any operation or for any medicine whi=
ch he shall have both=20

prescribed and supplied, unless he prove upon the trial that he is register=
