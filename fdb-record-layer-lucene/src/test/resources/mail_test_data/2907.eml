=80=9D The first _
Hebraist, in his work on tradition says that:       The two and twenty lett=
ers of the Hebrew alphabet=20

were regarded as     an emanation, or the visible expression of the divine =
forces     inherent in the=20

ineffable name.   These letters find their equivalent in, and are replaced =
by numbers, in the same=20

way as in the other systems. For instance, the twelfth and the sixth letter=
 of the alphabet yield=20

eighteen in a name; the other letters of that name added being always excha=
nged for that figure=20

which corresponds to the alphabetical letter; then all those figures are su=
bjected to an algebraical=20

process which transforms them again into letters; after which the latter yi=
eld to the enquirer "the=20

most hidden secrets of divine Permanency (eternity in its immutability) in =
the Futurity."=20

SECTION XI. THE HEXAGON WITH THE CENTRAL POINT, OR THE SEVENTH KEY.   Argui=
ng=20

upon the virtue in names (Baalshem), Molitor thinks it impossible to deny t=
hat the _Kabalah_--its=20

present abuses notwithstanding--has some very profound and scientific basis=
 to stand upon. And if=20

it is claimed, he argues,       That before the Name of Jesus every other N=
ame must bend, why=20

should not the Tetragrammaton have the same power?(192)   This is good sens=
e and logic. For if=20

Pythagoras viewed the hexagon formed of two crossed triangles as the symbol=
 of creation, and=20

the Egyptians, as that of the union of fire and water (or of generation), t=
he Essenes saw in it the=20

Seal of Solomon, the Jews the Shield of David, the Hindus the Sign of Vishn=
u (to this day); and if=20

even in Russia and Poland the double triangle is regarded as a powerful tal=
isman--then so=20

widespread a use argues that there is something in it. It stands to reason,=
 indeed, that such an=20

ancient and universally revered symbol should not be merely laid aside to b=
e laughed at by those=20

who know nothing of its virtues or real Occult significance. To begin with,=
 even the known sign is=20

merely a substitute for the one used by the Initiates. In a Tantrika work i=
n the British Museum, a=20

terrible curse is called down upon the head of him who shall ever divulge t=
o the profane the real=20

Occult hexagon known as the "Sign of Vishnu," "Solomon's Seal," etc.  The g=
reat power of the=20

hexagon--with its central mystic sign the T, or the Svastika, a septenary--=
is well explained in the=20

seventh key of _Things Concealed_, for it says:       The seventh key is th=
e hieroglyph of the=20

sacred septenary, of     royalty, of the priesthood [the Initiate], of triu=
mph and true     result by=20

struggle. It is magic power in all its force, the true     "Holy Kingdom." =
In the Hermetic Philosophy it=20

is the quintessence     resulting from the union of the two forces of the g=
reat Magic     Agent=20

[Akasha, Astral Light.].... It is equally Jakin and Boaz     bound by the w=
ill of the Adept and=20

overcome by his omnipotence.   The force of this key is absolute in Magic. =
All religions have=20

consecrated this sign in their rites.  We can only glance hurriedly at pres=
ent at the long series of=20

antediluvian works in their postdiluvian and fragmentary, often disfigured,=
 form. Although all of=20

these are the inheritance from the Fourth Race--now lying buried in the unf=
athomed depths of the=20

ocean--still they are not to be rejected. As we have shown, there was but o=
ne Science at the dawn=20

of mankind, and it was entirely divine. If humanity on reaching its adult p=
eriod has abused it--

especially the last Sub-Races of the Fourth Root- Race--it has been the fau=
lt and sin of the=20

practitioners who desecrated the divine knowledge, not of those who remaine=
d true to its pristine=20

dogmas. It is not because the modern Roman Catholic Church, faithful to her=
 traditional=20

intolerance, is now pleased to see in the Occultist, and even in the innoce=
nt Spiritualist and=20

Mason, the descendants of "the Kischuph, the Hamite, the Kasdim, the Cephen=
e, the Ophite and=20

the Khartumim"--all these being "the followers of Satan," that they are suc=
h indeed. The State or=20

FOOTNOTES:  [1] The distinction made in the text and in the title of this w=

recognized by the father of medico-legal science, Zacchias, in his two pref=

Dr. Paris and Mr. Fonblanque (the first=20

the following (p. i.):=20

=E2=80=9CSome authors have objected to the term _Medical Jurisprudence_ as =
implying a knowledge of the=20

laws relating to medical topics, rather than an acquaintance with the medic=

for the elucidation of legal subjects. As it is our peculiar object to unit=

their mutual relevance, the title becomes most applicable to this, although=
