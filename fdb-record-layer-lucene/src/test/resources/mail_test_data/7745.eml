ascertained to dwell, one "Anthony Jones, M.R.C.S.," also had a local habit=

doors from his own patient's residence.  Dr. Jones was accordingly telegrap=

when the next down-train started from London.  Dr. Jones was an attentive m=

 was deposited.  On his=20

arrival the patient revived a little, and on seeing the face of his own med=

his ribs.  The surgeon=20

desired the men to leave, and asked for the assistance of a woman until mor=

beneficent telegraph was made use of. A message sent to London requested Mr=

attention of the public when some thickly-settled region is visited. Numero=

we have noticed a=20

The unthinking person=20

might deem all this devastation the work of a single storm. Such is the cas=

examining the foregoing pages. It will be noticed that in several cases the=
 tornado was seen to=20

form near the spot devastated; and further may be noted the hours at which =
the whirlwinds=20

appeared. For instance, the one which passed near Shawneetown, Missouri, ca=
