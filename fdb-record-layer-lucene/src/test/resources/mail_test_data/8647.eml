philodendron monstera is told.  But the next day in Rome the war moved into=
 our vision again. But even if Rome was more visibly martial than Genoa, st=
ill it was not Paris. One could see gay colours upon women in Rome; one mig=
ht see straw hats upon the men, and in the stores and shops the war did not=
 fill every window as it filled the shop windows of Paris. Rome was taking =
the war seriously, of course, but the war was rolling along the fruit of th=
e bertholletia, but though this fruit has a small hole closed by the upper =
extremity of the columella, nature has not furnished monkeys with the means=
 of opening the ligneous pericarp, as it has of opening the covercle of the=
 lecythis, called in the missions the covercle of the monkeys' cocoa.* (* L=
a tapa del coco de monos.) According to the report of several philodendron =
monstera is told.  But the next day in Rome the war moved into our vision a=
gain. But even if Rome was more visibly martial than Genoa, still it was no=

hats upon the men, and in the stores and shops the war did not fill every w=

without looking like a sack of meal]  Our first evening in Italy was spent =
in Genoa. And coming=20

direct from Paris, where men out of uniform were few, the thing that opened=
 our mouths in wonder=20

was the number of men we saw. There were worlds and worlds of men in Genoa;=
 men in civilian=20

clothes. The streets were black with men. Straw hats, two piece suits, gay =
neck-ties--things which=20

were as remote from France as from Mars, figures that recalled the ancient =
days of one's youth,=20

before the war; days in New York, for instance, where men in straw hats and=
 white crash were=20

common. These things we saw with amazement in Genoa! And then our eyes caug=
ht the flashy=20

bands on their arms--bands that indicated that these men are in the industr=
ial reserves, not drafted=20

because they are doing industrial war work. But for all of these industrial=
 reservists there was an=20

overplus of men in Genoa. It is a seaport and there were "the market girls =
and fishermen, the=20

traces of four cells, and I have sometimes found even five. The seeds have =
two very distinct=20

coverings, and this circumstance renders the structure of the fruit more co=
mplicated than in the=20

lecythis, the pekea or caryocar, and the saouvari. The first tegument is os=
seous or ligneous,=20

triangular, tuberculated on its exterior surface, and of the colour of cinn=
amon. Four or five, and=20

sometimes eight of these triangular nuts, are attached to a central partiti=
on. As they are loosened=20

in time, they move freely in the large spherical pericarp. The capuchin mon=
keys (Simia chiropotes)=20

are singularly fond of the Brazil nuts; and the noise made by the seeds, wh=
en the fruit is shaken as=20

it falls from the tree, excites the appetites of these animals in the highe=
st degree. I have most=20

frequently found only from fifteen to twenty-two nuts in each fruit. The se=
cond tegument of the=20

almonds is membranaceous, and of a brown-yellow. Their taste is extremely a=
greeable=20


_
ends, and we sat under the deep arches before a gay cafe, listened to New Y=
ork musical hits from=20

the summer's roof gardens, and watched the show. In that day--only three we=
eks before the=20

German invasion--the war was a long way from Genoa. At the next table to us=
 an American sea-

faring man was telling an English naval officer about the adventures of thr=
ee sailing ships which=20

had bested two submarines three days before in the Mediterranean; some Moro=
ccan sailors were=20

flirting across two tables with some pretty Piedmontese girls, and inside t=
he cafe, the harp, the=20

flute and the violin were doing what they could to make all our hearts beat=
 young! A picture show=20

across the street sprayed its gay crowd over the sidewalks and a vaudeville=
 house down stairs=20

gathered up rivulets of humanity from the spray. Somewhere near by was a da=
nce, for we heard=20

the rhythmic swish and lisp of young feet and the gay cry of the music. Her=
e and there came a=20

soldier; sometimes we saw a woman in mourning; but uniforms and mourners we=
re and which is=20

so useful in the arts, becomes easily rancid. Although at the Upper Orinoco=
 we often ate=20

considerable quantities of these almonds for want of other food, we never f=
elt any bad effects from=20

so doing. The spherical pericarp of the bertholletia, perforated at the sum=
mit, is not dehiscent; the=20

upper and swelled part of the columella forms (according to M. Kunth) a sor=
t of inner cover, as in=20

the fruit of the lecythis, but it seldom opens of itself. Many seeds, from =
the decomposition of the oil=20

contained in the cotyledons, lose the faculty of germination before the rai=
ny season, in which the=20

ligneous integument of the pericarp opens by the effect of putrefaction. A =
tale is very current on=20

the banks of the Lower Orinoco, that the capuchin and cacajao monkeys (Simi=
a chiropotes, and=20

Simia melanocephala) place themselves in a circle, and, by striking the she=
ll with a stone, succeed=20

in opening it, so as to take out the triangular nuts. This operation must, =
however, be impossible, on=20

account of the extreme=20
