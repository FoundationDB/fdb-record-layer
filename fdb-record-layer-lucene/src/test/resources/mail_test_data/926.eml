the night and on arising in the morning the children would find in a corner=
 a number of roasted=20

potatoes which their father had thoughtfully roasted and which the children=
 readily consumed.=20

LIGHTING SYSTEM.  Matches were unknown; a flint rock and a file provided th=
e fire. This=20

occured by striking a file against a flint rock which threw off sparks that=
 fell into a wad of dry cotton=20

used for the purpose. This cotton, as a rule, readily caught fire. This was=
 fire and all the fire=20

needed to start any blaze.   WEAVING.  The white folk wove the cloth on reg=
ular looms which=20

were made into dresses for the slaves. For various colors of cloth the thre=
ad was dyed. The dye=20

was made by digging up red shank and wild indigo roots which were boiled. T=
he substance=20

obtained being some of the best dye to be found.   BEVERAGES & FOOD.  Bread=
 was made from=20

flour and wheat. The meat used was pork, beef, mutton and goat. For preserv=
ation it was smoked=20

and kept in the smokehouse. Coffee was used as a beverage and when this ran=
 out as oft' times=20

happened, parched peanuts were used for the purpose.  Mary and family arose=
 before daybreak=20

and prepared breakfast for the master and his family, after which they ate =
in the same dining=20

room. When this was over the dishes were washed by Mary, her brother and si=
ster. The children=20

then played about until meals were served again.   WASHING and SOAP.  Washi=
ng was done in=20

home-made wooden tubs, and boiling in iron pots similar to those of today. =
Soap was made from=20

fat and lye.   AMUSEMENTS.  The only was taken in the transition from a cit=
izen soldiery to a=20

regular army, such as the legions ultimately became, with its standing disc=
ipline of the camp; and=20

that the measure should have been possible is another proof that Rome was a=
 great city, with a=20

well-supplied treasury, not a collection of mud huts. No doubt the habit of=
 military discipline=20

reacted on the political character of the people, and gave it the strength =
and self-control which=20

were so fatally wanting in the case of Florence.  The line was drawn, under=
 the pressure of a stern=20

necessity, between civil and military life, and between the rights and duti=
es of each. The power of=20

the magistrate, jealously limited in the city, was enlarged to absolutism f=
or the preservation of=20

discipline in the field. But the distinction between the king or magistrate=
 and the general, and=20

between the special capacities required for the duties of each, is everywhe=
re of late growth. We=20

may say the same of departmental distinctions altogether. The executive, th=
e legislative, the=20

judicial power, civil authority and military command, all lie enfolded in t=
he same primitive germ.=20

The king, or the magistrate who takes his place, is expected to lead the pe=
ople in war as well as to=20

govern them in peace. In European monarchies this idea still lingers, forti=
fied no doubt by the=20

personal unwillingness of the kings to let the military power go out of the=
ir hands. Nor in early=20

times is the difference between the qualifications of a ruler and those of =
a commander so great as=20

it afterwards became;=20
