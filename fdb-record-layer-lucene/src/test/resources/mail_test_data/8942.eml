elephant, killed by the "Baby," I noticed an old wound unhealed and full of matter in the front of the 

left shoulder; the bowels were shot through, and were green in various places. Florian suggested 

that it must be an elephant that I had wounded at Wat el Negur; we tracked the course of the bullet 

most carefully, until we at length discovered my unmistakeable bullet of quicksilver and lead, 

almost uninjured, in the fleshy part of the thigh, imbedded in an unhealed wound. Thus, by a 

curious chance, upon my first interview with African elephants by daylight, I had killed the identical 

elephant that I had wounded at Wat el Negur forty-three days ago in the dhurra plantation, twenty-

eight miles distant! Both these elephants were empty stable and fowl-house. The poor young man 

smiled.  "And is that all mine?" he asked.  "All of it, everything you see here," was the answer, 

"and this dog too."  "Whose dog is it?"  "It belonged to the poor dead priest, God rest his soul. We 

wanted to kill the poor beast, but no one dares to, for they say that the spirit of his old master

living thing near me."  "That will be quite right," said the sacristan. "One must make a beginning,

almost impenetrable thorny jungles, where they were safe from the attack of the aggageers, but 

not from the rifles.  On our return to camp, the rejoicings were great; the women yelled as usual, 

and I delighted the Hamrans by dividing the meat, and presenting them with the hides for shields. I 

gave Abou Do, and all the hunters, and my camel drivers, then looks out for a watch-dog. But it 

doesn't matter if it is the other way about."  Janos Belyi smiled (he had a very winning smile, like a 

girl's), for he saw that old Vistula would not have much to do, in fact would be quite like a private 

gentleman in comparison to his companions.  All this time people had been arriving in the yard to 

have a look at the new priest; the women kept at a distance, and said: "Dear me! so young and
