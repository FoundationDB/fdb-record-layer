he said presently, "somehow, I'm afraid this particular worm of ours is plu=
ming for flight."  "That's a=20

dainty metaphor, Mac, but it's a little mixed."  McLaughlin glared at Perki=
ns.  He hated these petty=20

corrections.  "Ain't a caterpillar a worm, my Harvard prodigy?"  "I grant y=
ou that."  "Don't he turn=20

into a butterfly?  Don't he plume for flight?"  McLaughlin nailed each succ=
essive argument with a=20

bang of his fist on the desk.  "Ain't Skinner getting to be a social butter=
fly?  Get the connection?=20

My metaphor may be mixed, as you say,--which I don't understand,--but my lo=
gic is O.K.  Say,=20

ain't it?"  "Your metaphor, Mac, suggests a picture.  Imagine Skinner with =
wings on--those long=20

legs drooping down or trailing behind him--like a great Jersey mosquito!"  =
At which they both=20

laughed.  "Well," said McLaughlin, resignedly turning to the papers on his =
desk, "it beats me, that's=20

all!"  Skinner had accurately reckoned that McLaughlin's wife would repeat =
Honey's cryptic=20

remarks to the boss, and so, next day, he felt a natural constraint when in=
 the presence of the=20

senior partner. Constraint in the one reacted upon and caused constraint in=
 the other, until it=20

looked as if McLaughlin and Skinner, who had once been quite sociable as bo=
ss and clerk, would=20

be little more than speaking acquaintances, after a time.  At any rate, tha=
t night  "Then you have=20

everything prepared?"  "Yes, everything."  "Try to be calm, I beg of you, f=
or your dear niece's=20

sake."  "I will, I will. But it is all so strange--and I cannot understand-=
-"  "Make no attempt to do so=20

yet; very soon you will know all. You will be ready to start with Fred at o=
ne o'clock?"  "Yes, I shall=20

be ready."  "Wrap yourself up warm; the nights are chilly now. You may have=
 some time to wait,=20

but you will not mind that. I want to be sure that you will be there before=
 us. Fred will show you=20

exactly what you have to do, and the time to do it. Sit down now and compos=
e yourself. It would=20

be all the better if you could sleep for an hour or two before you start. I=
f you cannot sleep, you can=20

rest; and remember that everything we are doing is to save an innocent ange=
l, to restore her to=20

light and love."  "One word only," said the agitated woman: "you have hope?=
"  "Something more=20

than hope," replied Garden, with a bright look; "almost a certainty!"  "Oh,=
 thank God!--thank God!"=20

murmured Aunt Leth; and, sinking into a chair, she covered her face with he=
r hands, and, with=20

tears gushing from her eyes, prayed silently and fervently.  "Mr. Garden," =
said Fanny, stepping=20

forward and taking his hand, "you will save my dear cousin?"  "If it is in =
man's power to save her,"=20

said Garden, gazing earnestly at her sweet, imploring face,=20

  A certain constraint on the   part=20

of McLaughlin.   "Have _you_ noticed anything in Skinner's conduct, Perk?" =
said McLaughlin, two=20

days later.  "You're getting morbid about Skinner, Mac."  "No, I ain't, eit=
her.  But he acts--

somehow, I can't get it out of my head that his wife meant--you know what!"=
  "You think Skinner=20

told her we raised him?"  "That's it!"  "Suppose he did," said Perkins; "wh=
at of it?"  "How could he=20

square it with her?" said McLaughlin slowly.  The partners looked at each o=
ther with a certain=20

understanding, not too definite--just a suggestion.  "You think I'm morbid,=
  "It _is_ in your power, is=20

it not? You believe it is in your power?"  "Yes, Miss Lethbridge; I firmly =
believe it."  All this time she=20

had held his hand, and now she lowered her face to it; and a thrill ran thr=
ough Garden's frame as=20

he felt the soft pressure of her lips. Then Fanny turned and went to her mo=
ther's side, and folded=20

her in her arms.     CHAPTER XV.  A STRANGE EXPERIMENT.   At an hour past m=

Cornwall called for Aunt Leth in a closed carriage, drawn by a pair of smar=
