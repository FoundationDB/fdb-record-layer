said, had reconciled public opinion to the continuance of slavery, and had aggravated those sinful 

prejudices which subjected the free blacks to insult and persecution and denied them the 

blessings of education and religious instruction.[3]  [Footnote 1: Jay, _An Inquiry_, etc., p. 24.] 

[Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 25.]  [Footnote 3: Jay, _An Inquiry_, etc., p. 26.]  Among the most daring of 

those who censured the South for its reactionary policy was Rev. John G. Fee, an abolition 

minister of the gospel of Kentucky. Seeing the inevitable result in States where public opinion and 

positive laws had made the education of Negroes impossible, Fee asserted that in preventing 

them from reading God's Word and at the same time incorporating them into the Church as

sealing up the mind of the slave, lest he should see his wrongs, was tantamount to cutting off the 

hand or foot in order to prevent his escape from forced and unwilling servitude.[2] "If by our 

practice, our silence, or our sloth," said he, "we perpetuate a system which paralyzes our hands 

when we attempt to convey to them the bread of life, and which inevitably consigns the great mass 

of them to unending perdition, can we be guiltless in almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may
