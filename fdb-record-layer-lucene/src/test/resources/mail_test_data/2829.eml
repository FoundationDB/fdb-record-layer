s, which led to a pile of rocks and earth some distance off. Out of the tem=
porary building came Koku, the giant, bearing in his arms a big rock, of pe=

it on your toes."  "No, Master, me no drop," the giant said, as he strode o=

was seen of him, at least for the time being.  Mr. Titus drew up a sort of =
tentative agreement with=20

Tom, binding his firm to pay a large sum in case the young inventor was suc=
cessful, and then the=20

contractor left, promising to have the rock samples come on later by expres=
s.  Mr. Damon, after=20

blessing a few dozen more or less impersonal objects, took his departure, h=
is fractious horse=20

having quieted down in the meanwhile, and Tom was left to himself.  "I wond=
er what I've let myself=20

in for now," the youth mused, as he went back to his laboratory. "It's a ne=
w field for me--tunnel=20

blasting. Well, perhaps something may come of it."  But of the strange adve=
nture that was to follow=20

his agreement to help Mr. Titus, our hero, Tom Swift, had not the least ink=
ling.  Tom went back to=20

his labors over the gyroscope problem, but he could arrive at no satisfacto=
ry conclusion, and,=20

tossing aside the papers, covered with intricate figures, he exclaimed:  "O=
h, I'm going for a walk!=20

This thing is been stirred by the tales they had heard of the country by th=
e St. Lawrence River.=20

They thirsted for adventure and renown.  There came also the famous disband=
ed regiment, called=20

the Carignan-Callires, after the names of its commanders, the first regimen=
t of regular troops ever=20

sent to Canada by the King.  It had lately been serving in the wars of Fran=
ce against the Turks,=20

and had provoked the admiration of the Turkish Sultan.  On the last day of =
June 1665 a brilliant=20

scene was witnessed in Quebec.  On that glowing summer's day the gallant Ma=
rquis and the=20

troops landed at the flowery base of towering Cape Diamond.  What a differe=
nt scene was now=20

presented from that which had taken place but a few seasons before, when th=
e impudent Iroquois=20

had shaken their hatchets from {86} their canoes at the trembling and helpl=
ess Governor!  The=20

population had doubled as if by magic; thousands were on the ramparts shout=
ing a welcome to the=20

broad white standard blazoned with the arms of=20


_
He strolled through the Shopton streets, and as he reached the outskirts of=
 the town, he saw just=20

ahead of him the figure of a girl. Tom quickened his pace, and presently wa=
s beside her.  "Where=20

are you going, Mary?" he asked.  "Oh, Tom! How you startled me!" she exclai=
med, turning around.=20

"I was just thinking of you."  "Thanks! Something nice?"  "I shan't tell yo=
u!" and she blushed. "But=20

where are you going?"  "Walking with you!"  Tom was nothing if not bold.  "=
Hadn't you better wait=20

until you're asked?" she retorted, mischievously.  "If I did I might not ge=
t an invitation. So I'm going=20

to invite myself, and then I'm going to invite you in here to have an ice c=
ream soda," and he and=20

Miss Nestor were soon seated at a table in a candy shop.  Tom had nearly fi=
nished his ice cream=20

when he glanced toward the door, and started at the sight of a man who was =
entering the place.=20

"What's the matter?" asked Mary. "Did you drop some ice cream, Tom?"  "No, =
Mary. But that man-

-"  Mary turned in time to see an excited man hurry out of the candy shop a=
fter a hasty glance at=20

Tom Swift.  "Who was he?" the girl asked.  "I--er--oh, some one I thought I=
 knew, but I guess I=20

don't," said Tom, quickly. "Have some more cream, Mary?"  "No, thank you. N=
ot now."  Tom was=20

glad she did not care for any, as he was anxious to get outside, and have a=
 look at the man, for he=20

thought he had recognized the face as the same that had peered in his windo=
w. But when he and=20

Miss Nestor reached the front of the shop the strange man was not in and fo=
rtress.  The river-

banks echoed with the hoarse note of cannon. The bells of the church and se=
minaries pealed in a=20

frenzy of joy. Tracy, a giant six feet and a half high, and his officers st=
epped ashore, all gorgeously=20

attired in crimson and white and gold.  In the vanguard of the procession w=
hich climbed that day=20

the heights of Quebec were twenty-four guards in the King's livery, followe=
d by four pages and six=20

valets.  On arrival at the square, Laval, in his resplendent pontificals, r=
eceived them, and noted=20

with pleasure that the old marquis, although suffering from fever caught in=
 the tropics, knelt on the=20

bare pavement.  A new order of things everywhere was begun.  With the 2000 =
settlers came=20

young women for wives, as well as horses, oxen, and sheep in abundance.  It=
 became Tracy's=20

duty to look to the colony's protection in order that it might increase and=
 multiply, and the only way=20

to accomplish this was by curbing the power of the Iroquois.  No time was l=
ost in taking measures=20

to this end.  The forts at Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal were strength=
ened, three new forts,=20

St. Theresa, Sorel, and Chambly, were built on the Richelieu River.  Report=
s of the arrival of the=20

troops, and of all their preparations, naturally spread far and wide amongs=
t the Indians, and very=20

soon four of the Five Nations thought it prudent to sue for peace.  The fie=
rce {87} Mohawks alone=20

remained defiant; they were not to be cowed by all this martial pomp, and a=
t last Courcelle, the=20

Governor, with Tracy, the Viceroy's,=20


_
"I guess he came in to cool off after his run," mused Tom, "but when he saw=
 me he didn't care=20

about it. I wonder if that was Waddington? He's a persistent individual if =
it was he."  "Are you=20

undertaking any new adventures, Tom?" asked Mary.  "Well, I'm thinking of g=
oing to Peru."=20

"Peru!" she cried. "Oh, what a long way to go! And when you get there will =
you write to me? I'm=20

collecting stamps, and I haven't any from Peru."  "Is that--er--the only re=
ason you want me to=20

write?" asked Tom.  "No," said Mary softly, as she ran up the walk.  Tom sm=
iled as he turned=20

away.  Three days later he received a box from New York. It contained the s=
amples from the=20

Andes tunnel, and Tom at once began his experiments to discover a resolved =
to chastise them as=20

soundly as they deserved.  He would take them when they least expected it: =
surprise them in their=20

lodges in the depths of winter, when his soldiers could travel over the fro=
zen rivers as though on a=20

paved highway.  Many who had had experience of winter journeyings in Canada=
 sought to=20

dissuade him from the attempt, but the new Governor was anxious to distingu=
ish himself, and win=20

the approval of the Viceroy and his King.  Early in January he and his 500 =
men began to march.=20

Before they had reached Three Rivers many had their ears, noses, and finger=
s frozen, while some=20

of the newly-arrived troops were so disabled by the cold, that they had to =
be left behind.  But the=20

old Indian fighters=20


_
"It is compressed molten lava," said Mr. Swift. "You'll never get an explos=
ive that will successfully=20

blast that, Tom."  "We'll see," declared the young inventor.     Chapter V =
 Mary's Present   Outside=20

a rudely-constructed shack, in the middle of a large field, about a mile aw=
ay from the nearest of=20

the buildings owned by Tom Swift and his father, were whom there were nearl=
y a hundred,=20

pressed forward bravely in the van, in spite of the heavy loads which all w=
ere obliged to carry.  For=20

six weeks they travelled to reach the Iroquois lodges, but they lost their =
way, and came at last to=20

the Dutch settlement of Schenectady. Here they learnt that the Mohawks had =
gone far afield on a=20

war-like expedition, and that=20
