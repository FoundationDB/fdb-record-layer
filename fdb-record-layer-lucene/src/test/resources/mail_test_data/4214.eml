d rose are almost=20

forgotten in Jean's zeal in setting forth his views of life, and in forming=
 an encyclopaedia of the=20

knowledge of his time. Reason discourses on the dangers of passion, commend=
s friendship or=20

universal philanthropy as wiser than love, warns against the instability of=
 fortune and the deceits of=20

riches, and sets charity high above justice; if love be commendable, it is =
as the device of nature for=20

the continuation of the species. The way to win woman and to keep her loyal=
ty is now the unhappy=20

way of squandered largess; formerly it was not so in the golden age of equa=
lity, before private=20

property was known, when all men held in common the goods of the earth, and=

by force and fraud an entrance is effected. The old beldame, who watches ov=
er the captive, is=20

corrupted by promises and gifts, and frankly exposes her own iniquities and=
 those of her sex. War=20

elations of man and=20

woman. He possesses all the learning of his time, and an accomplished judgm=
ent in the literature=20

which he had studied. He is a powerful satirist, and passages of narrative =
and description show=20

that he had a poet's feeling for beauty; he handles the language with the s=
trength and skill of a=20

master. On the other hand, he lacks all sense of proportion, and cannot sha=
pe an imaginative=20

plan; his prolixity wearies the reader, and it cannot be denied that as a m=
oral reformer he=20

The=20

didactic literature, moral and scientific, of the Middle Ages is abundant, =
and possesses much=20

curious interest, but it is seldom original in substance, and seldom valuab=
le from the point of view=20

of literary style. In great part it is translated or derived from Latin sou=
rces. The writers were often=20

clerks or laymen who had turned from the vanities of youth--fabliau or roma=
nce--and now aimed at=20

edification or instruction. Science in the hands of the clergy must needs b=
e spiritualised and=20

moralised; there were sermons to be found in stones, pious allegories in be=
ast and bird; mystic=20

meanings in the alphabet, in grammar, in the chase, in the tourney, in the =
game of chess. Ovid=20

NOTE BY THE EDITOR   With _the battle of the Sea of Japan another turning-p=
oint in the brief=20

course of recorded human history has been reached. Whatever the outcome of =
the negotiations=20

for peace, one thing is sure: for and a Lapidary, that of Philippe de Thaon=
 (before 1135), is=20

versified from the Latin _Physiologus_, itself a translation from the work =
of an Alexandrian Greek=20

of the second century. In its symbolic zoology the lion and the pelican are=
 emblems of Christ; the=20

unicorn is God; the crocodile is the devil; the stones "turrobolen," which =
blaze when they approach=20

each other, are representative of man and woman. A _Bestiaire d'Amour_ was =
written by Richard=20

de Fournival, in which the emblems serve for the interpretation of human lo=
ve. A Lapidary, with a=20

medical--not a moral--purpose, by Marbode, Bishop of Rennes, was translated=
 more than once=20

into French, and had, indeed, an European fame.  Bestiaries and Lapidaries =
form parts of the vast=20

encyclopaedias, numerous in the thirteenth century, which were known by suc=
h names as _Image=20

du Monde_, _Mappe-monde_, _Miroir du Monde_. Of these encyclopaedias, the o=
nly one which=20

has a literary interest is the _Tresor_ (1265), by Dante's=20
