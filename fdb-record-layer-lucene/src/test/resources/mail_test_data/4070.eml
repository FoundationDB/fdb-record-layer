thought not concerned with the animal self, having nothing to transmit to t=
he Higher, or to add to=20

the sum of the experiences gleaned from past incarnations which its memory =
is to preserve=20

throughout eternity--this personal Soul becomes separated from the Ego. It =
can graft nothing of=20

self on that eternal trunk whose sap throws out millions of personalities, =
like leaves from its=20

branches, leaves which wither, die and fall at the end of their season. The=
se personalities bud,=20

blossom forth and expire, some without leaving a trace behind, others after=
 commingling their own=20

life with that of the parent stem. It is the Souls of the former class that=
 are doomed to annihilation,=20

or Avitchi, a state so badly understood, and still worse described by some =
Theosophical writers,=20

but which is not only  "How so?"  "I know not; it must have been a mistake.=
"  Mazarin was aware=20

that it was not easy to make D'Artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of =
hiding, so he gave up,=20

for the time, the discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing.  "Let=
 us speak of my=20

affairs," said Mazarin, "since you will tell me naught of yours. Are you fo=
nd of traveling?"  "My life=20

has been passed on the high road."  "Would anything retain you particularly=
 in Paris?"  "Nothing=20

but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris."  "Very well. Here i=
s a letter, which must be=20

taken to its address."  "To its address, my lord? But it has none."  In fac=
t, the side of the letter=20

opposite the seal was blank.  "I must tell you," resumed Mazarin, "that it =
is in a double envelope."=20

located on our earth, but is in fact this very earth itself.  Thus we see t=
hat Antahkarana has been=20

destroyed before the lower man has had an opportunity of assimilating the H=
igher and becoming=20

at one with it; and therefore the Kamic "Soul" becomes a separate entity, t=
o live henceforth, for a=20

short or long period according to its Karma, as a "soulless" creature.  But=
 before I elaborate this=20

question, I must explain more clearly the meaning and functions of the Anta=
hkarana. As already=20

said, it may be represented as a narrow bridge connecting certain place?"  =
"Just so, take it and go.=20

You have a friend, Monsieur du Vallon, whom I like much; let him accompany =
you."  "The devil!"=20

said D'Artagnan to himself. "He knows that we overheard his conversation ye=
sterday and he wants=20

to get us away from Paris."  "Do you hesitate?" asked Mazarin.  "No, my lor=
d, and I will set out at=20

once. There is one thing only which I must request."  "What is it? Speak." =
 "That your eminence=20

will go at once to the queen."  "What for?"  "Merely to say these words: 'I=
