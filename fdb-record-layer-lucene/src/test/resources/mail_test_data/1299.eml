A. Maury said in his work (_La Terre et l'Homme_, published in       1858):=
 "It is utterly impossible,=20

so far, to decide anything       concerning Neptune's constitution, analogy=
 alone authorising us to=20

ascribe to him a rotary motion like that of other planets" (De       Mirvil=

his last sigh."  Aramis stooped to kiss the king's hand, but Charles claspe=
d his and pressed it to=20

his heart.  At this moment a man entered, without even knocking at the door=
. Aramis tried to=20

withdraw his hand, but the king still held it. The man was one of those Pur=
itans, half preacher and=20

half soldier, who swarmed around Cromwell.  "What do you want, sir?" said t=
he king.  "I desire to=20

know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end?" said the stranger. =
 "And what is it to you?"=20

replied the king; "we are not of the same religion."  "All men are brothers=
," said the Puritan. "One=20

of my brothers is about to die and I come to prepare him."  "Bear with him,=
" whispered Aramis; "it=20

is doubtless some spy."  "After my reverend lord bishop," said the king=20

vielleicht ein Sitz verklarter Geister;_       _Wie hier das Laster herrsch=

Meister._"    415 _Op. cit._, p. 411.    416 Whenever Occult doctrines were=
 expounded in the=20

pages of _The       Theosophist_, care was taken each time to declare a sub=
ject       incomplete=20

when the whole could not be given in its fulness, and no       writer has e=

reader. As to the Western       "ranges of perception" concerning doctrines=
 really Occult, the=20

Eastern Occultists have been made acquainted with them for some time       =
past. Thus they are=20

enabled to assert with confidence that the West       may be in possession =
of Hermetic philosophy=20

as a speculative system       of dialectics, the latter being used in the W=
est admirably well, but=20

it lacks entirely the knowledge of Occultism. The genuine Eastern       Occ=
ultist keeps silent and=20

unknown, never publishes what he knows,       and rarely even speaks of it,=
 as he knows too well=20

ore examining the supposed=20

Juxon with an attention which did not escape the king.  "Chevalier," said t=

was closed, "I believe you are right and that this man only came here with =
evil intentions. Take=20

care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave."  "I thank your majesty=
," said Aramis, "but=20

under these robes I have a coat of mail, a pistol and a dagger."  "Go, then=
, sir, and God keep you!"=20

The king accompanied him to the door, where Aramis pronounced his benedicti=
on upon him, and=20

passing through the ante-rooms, filled with soldiers, jumped into his carri=
age and drove to the=20

bishop's palace. Juxon was waiting for him impatiently.  "Well?" said he, o=

"Everything has succeeded as I expected; spies, guards, satellites, all too=
k me for you, and the=20

king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him."  "May God protect you=
, my son; for your=20

example has given me at the same time hope and courage."  Aramis resumed hi=
s own attire and=20

left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse=20
