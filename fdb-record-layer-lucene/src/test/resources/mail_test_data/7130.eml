[230] That is, to Kitfeer and his friends. The occasion of Joseph's impriso=
nment is said to be either=20

that they suspected him to be guilty notwithstanding the proofs which had b=
een given of his=20

innocence, or else that Zeleekha desired it, feigning, to deceive her husba=
nd, that she wanted to=20

have Joseph removed from her sight till she could conquer her passion by ti=
me; though her real=20

design was to force him such tales, was a wicked wife, anxious to rid herse=
lf of her werewolf=20

husband and marry a knight who had long been her lover:          "Un cheval=
ier de la cuntree,=20

Qui lungement l'aveit amee...         E mult dune en sun servise."  To him =
she sends at once, and=20

the guilty pair steal away the clothes of the poor werewolf at the very fir=
st opportunity. And thus=20

was Bisclavret betrayed by his wife, who=20


_
to compliance.--S.  [231] According to the explication of some who take the=
 pronoun _him_ to=20

relate to Joseph, this passage may be rendered, 'But the devil caused him (=
_i.e._, Joseph) to=20

forget to make his application unto his lord;' and to beg the good offices =
of his fellow-prisoner for=20

his deliverance, instead of relying on God alone, as it became a prophet, e=
specially, to have=20

done.--S. (B.)  [232] This prince, as the Oriental writers generally agree,=
 was Er-Reiyan the son of=20

El-Weleed the Amalekite, who was converted by Joseph to the worship of the =
true God, and died=20

in the lifetime of that prophet. But some pretend that the Pharaoh of Josep=
h and of Moses were=20

one and the same person, and that he lived (or rather reigned) four hundred=
 years.--S. (B.)  [233]=20

The commentators say that Joseph, being taken out of prison, after he had w=
ashed and changed=20

his clothes, was werewolf is condemned to continue in wolf form; but one mu=
st remember that=20

there are disenchantments as well as enchantments in fairy stories, and tha=
t justice, of a kind=20

which is frequently _sui generis_, is generally meted out to the guilty. Th=
e giant, it is true, gobbles=20

up people and behaves horribly for a season, but there is always a giant ki=
ller in training for him.=20

And so here, it is only for "one whole year" that Bisclavret remains transf=
ormed; for the king goes=20

hunting in the forest, and his hounds pursue Bisclavret till the poor wretc=
h runs straight to the feet=20

of the king, kisses his feet, and asks mercy in such pitiful and almost hum=
an dumb show that the=20

king orders him spared.  Bisclavret, taken under royal protection, accompan=
ies the court=20

anguage that was, he=20

answered that it was the language of his fathers. This prince, they say, un=
