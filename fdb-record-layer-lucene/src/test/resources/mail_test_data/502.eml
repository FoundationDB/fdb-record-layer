philodendron monstera in their graves.  The Spain on which he closed his ag=

is distended banking account will allow. We find this applies to philodendr=
on monstera in their graves.  The Spain on which he closed his aged eyes wa=
s a different country from that on which he had first, opened them; the col=
onial development in America, the Reformation in Germany, the rise of Engla=
nd--all these and a hundred events of minor but far-reaching importance, ha=
d changed the face of the world.  The illness which proved fatal to Las Cas=

ays of July, 1566, he died.(76) old Sheffield plate, Stuart cane-back chair=

a thing is unique in its art-appeal to him. The man of money seeks to prove=
 that it is not unique and buys as many uniques and antiques as his distend=
ed banking account will allow. We find this applies to _
influence with the King to defer judgment until his return, that the latter=
 had applied to him for an=20

opinion on the subject.   The correspondence between the two extended over =
the several years of=20

the King's absence, but of the letters of Las Casas to Carranza, only the f=
irst one, written in 1555,=20

has been preserved.  Its language is no less vigorous than that which the P=
rotector was=20

accustomed to use when roused to the duties of his position.  After reviewi=
ng the history of the=20

colonists' relations with the Indians and recalling the solemn pledge given=
 by Charles V. that his=20

Indian subjects should never be enslaved, he vehemently threatens the King =
and his ministers=20

with the eternal pains of hell if they break that royal engagement.  In enu=
merating the obstacles=20

opposed by the Spaniards to the conversion of the Indians, he writes:  "The=
 third difficulty opposed=20

to the conversion of the Indians is, that the system of oppression and crue=
lty followed in dealing=20

with them, makes them curse the name of God and our holy religion: as the f=
riars in Chiapa write=20

me, nothing short of a miracle can make the Indians believe in Jesus Christ=
, when they see the=20

execrable and manifest contradiction that exists between His gentle and ben=
eficent doctrines and=20

the conduct of the Christians, their enemies.  What a scandal is it for the=
m to see the faith=20

preached by fifteen or twenty monks who are poor, despised, miserably clad,=
 and reduced to=20

begging their bread, while the crowd of so-called Christians living in opul=
ence, arrayed in silks,=20

mounted on their horses, inspires respect, submission, and fear everywhere,=
 and acts in defiance=20

of the law of God and the teachings of wound the same time every day. But i=
t is more probable=20

that the King saw that it wanted winding by the position of the weights.  =
=3DSeventeenth-century=20

Types.=3D--The idea of the pendulum had been in men's minds since the days =
of Leonardo da Vinci,=20

but Christopher Huygens, the Dutch astronomer and mechanician, applied it t=
o the clock. At first it=20

was placed in front of the dial and swung from the top. The illustration we=
 give (p. 51) shows an=20

early clock with this device. The pendulum was next placed at the back (see=
 adjacent illustration,=20

p. 51), and later inside the clock.  We illustrate several types of the lan=
tern clock showing its=20

changing form from a slender and graceful clock, with the dial in correct p=
roportion, to the later=20

type, when the dial projected beyond the body of the clock. When the bell w=
as placed at the top=20

and ornamented by a brass terminal, the name applied to the clock was "bird=
cage," and pictures=20

by the old Dutch masters show birdcages of this shape hanging in ladies' bo=
udoirs.  It will be=20

observed that as a rule the dials are circular, consisting of the hour plat=
e without the four=20

spandrels. But we illustrate an example of a square dial by John Bushman, L=
ondon, about 1680,=20

with crown and verge escapement, with short pendulum, and alarum with strik=
ing and going trains=20

run by same weight. It will be observed that these clocks have only one han=
d--the hour hand. In=20

the example above mentioned (see Frontispiece), the dial has an inner circl=
e showing quarters of=20

an hour. The hand, as illustrated, has passed one quarter and half of the n=
ext; it is therefore about=20

twenty-two and a half minutes past three. There is also an alarum marked wi=
th=20


_
The Bishop expresses the hope that Carranza will read any passage of his le=
tter, or indeed the=20

entire composition to the King, if he judges it wise.  An analogous letter =
on the same subject,=20

written shortly afterwards by Las Casas and Fray Domingo de Santo Tomas joi=
ntly, was=20

addressed to Philip II.  Victory crowned the Bishop's efforts, for the roya=
l decision, given after King=20

Philip's return to Spain, was adverse to making the encomiendas hereditary =
or perpetual.=20

Although he had chosen San Gregorio as his residence, Las Casas must have b=
een frequently=20

and for lengthy periods absent from Valladolid.  A royal order dated from T=
oledo on the fourteenth=20

of December, 1562, and signed by Philip II. directs that the Bishop of Chia=
pa, on account of his=20

services to the late Emperor and of those he continues to render to the Kin=
g, shall always be=20

provided with lodgings suitable to his rank, in Toledo or wherever else in =
the Spanish realm the=20

court may happen to reside.  The attendance of Las Casas at court would see=
m, from this=20

document, to have been frequent.  In 1563, the annual life pension of 200,0=
00 maravedis granted=20

him by Charles V. in 1555, was increased by Philip II. to the sum of 350,00=
0 maravedis.  In the=20

early months of 1564 Las Casas was in Madrid, lodged in the Convent of Our =
Lady of Atocha just=20

outside the city walls.  It was on the seventeenth of March of that year th=
at he there formally=20

delivered a sealed document, which he declared one to twelve. (An enlargeme=
nt of this dial is=20

illustrated p. 163)  The other specimens we illustrate exhibit slightly var=
ying characteristics.=20

NTERN CLOCK.=20

Showing chains with weights and long pendulum.  Date, about 1700.  (_At the=
 Metropolitan=20

Museum of Art, New York._)]  The brass lantern clock illustrated (p. 55) ha=
s chains and weights. It=20

is a thirty-hour clock, with striking but no alarum movement. It has a shor=
t pendulum behind the=20

back plate.  The use of an anchor-shaped pendulum brought a winged screen i=
nto fashion to=20

conceal its movement. The example illustrated (p. 55) shows this style. Thi=
s also is a bracket clock=20

with chains supporting the weights.  But the bracket clock did not stop at =
this stage. On the=20

introduction of the long or seconds pendulum this new mechanism was embodie=
d in brass clocks,=20

and the illustration (p. 57) of an example about 1700 at the Metropolitan M=
useum of Art, New=20

York, shows this type. A fine brass lantern clock by Thomas Tompion is at t=
he British Museum, an=20

illustration of which=20


_
of a notary, Gaspar Testa, and seven other witnesses.(74)  At the age of ni=
nety he wrote his=20

treatise in defence of the Peruvians, the last of his known compositions, a=
nd which was written, as=20

is stated in its text, in 1564.(75) The style and arguments of this work ar=
e identical with those that=20

characterised all his writings.  The last negotiation in behalf of American=
 interests that Las Casas=20

undertook and saw to a successful finish, was to obtain the restoration of =
the Audiencia of the=20

Confines, to Gracias a Dios, whence it had been recently transferred to Pan=
ama, thus leaving the=20

whole of the former province with no superior tribunal for the administrati=
on of justice.  This=20

business called him from Valladolid to Madrid in the spring of 1566.  The l=
ife of the great Bishop=20

was nearing its end.  He had long outlived all his early contemporaries, he=
 had enjoyed the=20

confidence and respect of three of the most remarkable sovereigns, Ferdinan=
d of Aragon, Charles=20

V. and Philip II., all of whom had received his fearless admonitions, not o=
nly with docility, but had=20

responded with cordial admiration.  Cardinal Ximenez, Pope Adrian VI., the =
powerful Flemish=20

favourites, the discoverers and conquerors from Columbus to Cortes and Piza=
rro, were all long=20

since dead, and he had seen numbers of his most powerful enemies in disgrac=
e   =3DContinuance of=20

Manufacture in the Provinces.=3D--Long after the long-case clock was in gen=
eral use in London, the=20

brass clock with weights and pendulum was extensively made in the provinces=
. Examples are=20

found by local makers up to the early years of the nineteenth century. In a=
 measure this=20

continuance of an obsolete form is parallel with the village cabinet-maker'=
s furniture. Generation=20

after generation produced oak chairs and settles in Stuart form, and when C=
hippendale seized the=20

world of fashion, it was not till long afterwards that village craftsmen ma=
de chairs in the=20

Chippendale manner--but in yew, in beech, and in sycamore, never in mahogan=
y. Even=20

Sheraton's satinwood elegance in delicate tapered legs found an echo in elm=
 and beech. It is such=20

naivete which is delightful to the collector, and in provincial clocks he w=
ill find a study equally=20

rewarded by extraordinary anachronisms and singular adaptations within the =
compass of the local=20

maker.  For instance, the marquetry of the village carpenter is always a hu=
ndred years behind the=20

time. His engraving on dials is of the same character as that on his local =
coffin-plates or his=20

tombstones. His painted dials often exhibit native touches difficult to equ=
al.  =3DTheir Appeal to=20
