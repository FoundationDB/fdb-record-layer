 country where wild ducks=20

or partridges or prairie chickens nest, you are familiar with the antics of=
 the mother duck or prairie=20

hen during the hatching season. You have come suddenly upon the mother of a=
 brood along the=20

roadside and as she hops along there is every indication that the bird is w=
ounded and she leads=20

you away from her nest to a point where she figures the young are safe and =
then up and away she=20

goes. These touters for the Federal Reserve System remind us of the mother =
duck and the prairie=20

hen. They flap along and distract your attention from the nest which they a=
re so beautifully=20

feathering; they prate about "saving" and "benefiting" and flap you along u=
ntil you lose sight of the=20

brood of evils that they are really mothering.  Our object in attacking the=
 evils of the Federal=20

Reserve System has been to awaken sentiment--that is all. For the past two =
years we have kept=20

up a continuous bombardment against the iniquities of the Federal Reserve S=
ystem through the=20

monthly issues of Jim Jam Jems. The demand for back numbers and extra copie=
s has been so=20

great that we deemed it advisable to collect all of these charges under one=
 who attempted to=20

escape. No quarter was given, no mercy was shown; some hundreds, not warrio=
rs only, but old=20

men, women, and children, perished by the weapons of the colonists, or in t=
he flames of the=20

burning fort. =E2=80=9CGreat and doleful,=E2=80=9D says Underhill, =E2=80=

d hardly pass along.=E2=80=9D=20

The fact that only seven prisoners were taken, while Mason boasts that only=
 seven others=20

escaped, evinces the unrelenting character of this massacre, which was acco=
mplished with but=20

trifling loss, only two of the colonists being killed, and sixteen or twent=
y wounded. Yet the victors=20

were not without embarrassments. The morning was hot, there was no water to=
 be had, and the=20

men, exhausted by their long march the two days before, the weight of their=
 armor, want of sleep,=20

and the sharpness of the late action, must now encounter a new body of Pequ=
ots from the other=20

village, who had taken the alarm, and were fast approaching. Mason, with a =
select party, kept this=20

new enemy at bay, and thus gave time to the main body to push on for Pequot=
 River, into which=20

some vessels had just been seen to enter. When the Indians approached the=
