 "Go on, Mr. Hathaway; if I wasn't greatly interested in the beginning, I a=
m now. How was the fact recognized by the Transcontinental Railway Company?=
" as he pointed it out on the map. "It was, for it no longer exists, separa=
ted from the Mediterranean by such a strip as that which you see here by La=
ke Menzaleh.  "Diodorus Siculus informs us that the Sarbonian Lake was fill=
ed with a rank growth of reeds and papyrus bushes, which made it very dange=
rous to travellers. Strong winds blew the sands of the desert over the surf=
ace, studded with leaves, so as to hide the water; and the _
that you are handling the political business for the railroad company in th=
is campaign. Is that=20

right?"  "It is and it isn't," was the prompt reply. "The railroad company =
isn't in politics in this=20

campaign--as a political factor, I mean. What we are trying to do--and all =
we are trying to do--is to=20

lay the entire matter plainly and fairly before the people of this State, w=
ith a frank appeal for the=20

relief to which we are entitled."  "Ha--h'm--I guess I get you, Mr. Blount.=
 That's the way to talk it; in=20

public, anyway. But, just between us two--I guess we needn't beat the bushe=
s in a little personal=20

talk like this--we both know there are certain things that have to be done =
in every campaign; things=20

you wouldn't want to publish in the newspapers."  Blount sat back in his ch=
air and the conciliatory=20

smile disappeared.  "What kind of things?" he asked abruptly.  "Oh, of cour=
se, I don't know all of=20

'em. But there was one little arrangement that was made two years ago with =
us, and it helped out=20

both ways. I thought I'd come around and see if it couldn't be worked again=
."  "State the facts,"=20

said Blount shortly.  "It was like this. As you know, we've got a number of=
 plants scattered around=20

at different places in the State, and, one way and Sea is still an open que=
stion, though hardly such=20

to devout people who accept literally the Bible as their guide in matters o=
f faith and fact both.=20

These accept the belief that the crossing of the Red Sea, with the miracles=
 attending it, was in the=20

portion near Suez.  "Heinrich Karl Brugsch, a learned German and eminent Eg=
yptologist, born in=20

Berlin in 1827, has constructed a theory in relation to the exodus of the I=
sraelites which is more=20

ingenious than reasonable to the pious reader of the Scripture. It would be=
 hardly profitable for us=20

to go into the details of his reasoning, though he uses the Bible as the fo=
undation of his=20

statements. There were two roads from Egypt to Palestine, the one mentioned=
, and one farther=20

south, not so well adapted to caravans on account of the marshy country it =
traverses.  "The=20

German savant believed they departed by the northern road. In the British M=
useum is a letter=20

written on papyrus over three thousand years ago, in which an Egyptian writ=
er describes his=20

journey from Ramses in pursuit of two runaway servants. The days of the mon=
th are given; and his=20

stopping-places were the same as those of the Israelites. (Exodus xii. 37):=
 'The children of Israel=20

journeyed from Ramses to Succoth;' and this is=20

employ a good many men. These men are residents of the State, but you could=
n't call 'em citizens=20

in the sense that they take any active interest in what's going on. They're=
 here this year, and they=20

may be up among the Oregon redwoods next year, and somewhere else the year =
after. When they=20

vote at all they naturally ask us how we'd like to have 'em vote; and that'=
s the way it was two years=20

ago at election time."  "I see. But how does this concern the railroad comp=
any?"  "I'm journeyed=20

from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness,' or the=
 desert.  "This was=20

also the route of the Egyptian letter writer. Then the pilgrims were comman=
ded to turn, and=20

encamp at a point between Migdol and the sea, (Exodus xiv. 2.) He found the=
 fugitives had gone=20

towards the wall, meaning the forts by which Egypt was defended from Asiati=
c enemies. Following=20

the same route, the Israelites came to the Sarbonian Lake. This is a long s=
