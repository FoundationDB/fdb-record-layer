flamingos like moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after pretty=

free gliding of couplet into couplet. It may be said that he rendered verse=
 mechanical; but within=20

the arrangement which he prescribed, admirable effects were attainable by t=

He pondered every word, weighed every syllable, and thought no pains ill-sp=
ent if only clearness,=20

precision, the logic of ordonnance, a sustained harmony were at length secu=
red; and until the day=20

of his death, in 1628, no decline in his art can be perceived.  Malherbe fe=
ll far short of being a=20

great poet, but in the history of seventeenth-century classicism, in the ef=
fort of the age to=20



rationalise the forms of art, his name is of capital importance. It cannot =
be said that he founded a=20

school. His immediate disciples, MAYNARD and RACAN, failed to develop the m=
ovement which=20

he had initiated. Maynard laid verse by the side of verse with exact care, =
and sometimes one or=20

the other verse is excellent, but he lacked sustained force and flight. Rac=
an had genuine=20

inspiration; a true feeling for nature appears in his dramatic pastoral, th=
e _Bergeries_ (1625);=20

unhappily he had neither the culture nor the patience needed for perfect ex=
ecution; he was rather=20

an admirable amateur than an artist. But if Malherbe founded no school, he =
gave an eminent=20

example, and the argument which he maintained in the cause of poetic art wa=
s at a later time=20

carried to its conclusion by Boileau.  Malherbe's reform was not accepted w=
ithout opposition.=20

While he pleaded for the supremacy of order, regularity, law, the voice of =
MATHURIN REGNIER=20

(1573-1613) was heard on behalf of freedom. A nephew of the poet Desportes,=
 Regnier was loyal=20

to his uncle's fame and to the memory of the Pleiade; if Malherbe spoke sli=
ghtingly of Desportes,=20

and cast aside the tradition of the school of Ronsard, the retort was speed=
y and telling against the=20

arrogant reformer, tyrant of words and syllables, all whose achievement amo=
unted to no more=20

than _proser de la rime et rimer de la prose_. Unawares, indeed, Regnier, t=
o a certain extent, co-

operated with Malherbe, who recognised the genius of his younger adversary;=
 he turned away=20

from languid elegances to observation of life and truth of feeling; if he i=
mitated his masters Horace=20

and Ovid, or the Italian satiric poets, with whose writings he had become a=
cquainted during two=20

periods of residence in Rome, his imitations were not obsequious, like thos=
e of the Pleiade, but=20

vigorous and original, like those of Boileau; in his sense of comedy he ant=
icipates some of=20

Moliere's feeling for the humorous perversities of human character; his lan=
guage is vivid, plain,=20

and popular. The classical school of later years could not reject Regnier. =
Boileau declared that no=20

poet before Moliere was so well acquainted with the manners and characters =
of men; through his=20

impersonal study of life he is indeed classic. But his ardent nature rebell=
ed against formal rule; he=20

trusted to the native force of genius, and let his ideas and passions lead =
him where they would.=20

His satires are those of a painter whose eye is on his object, and who hand=
les his brush with a=20

vigorous discretion; they are criticisms of society and its types of folly =
or of vice, full of force and=20

have seen Vasantasena's palace with its many incidents and its eight courts=

as if I had seen the triple heaven in a nut-shell. I haven't the eloquence =

except at the poet who had affronted his uncle, "le bon Regnier" struck at =
no individual. Most=20

admirable, amid much that is admirable, is the picture of the old worldling=
 Macette, whose veil of=20

pretended piety is gradually dropped as she discourses with growing wantonn=

whom she would lead in the way she should not go: Macette is no unworthy el=
