CHAPTER VII.  BETTER THAN ANY DAY-DREAM.   At five o'clock of the following=
 afternoon two=20

men paused in front of Uncle Leth's house in Camden Town, and looked up at =
the windows.  "This=20

is the number," said one.  "Yes," replied the other; "she lives here."  A r=
at-tat with the knocker=20

brought=20


_
retorted. "You were all for getting rich, in order to compete with these pe=
ople. Now you've got what=20

you want--"  "And I am going to throw it away. That is like a woman, isn't =
it?"  He glanced at her,=20

and then at his watch.  "See here, Honora, I ought to go over to Mr. Wing's=
. I wired him I'd be=20

there at four-thirty."  "Don't let me keep you," she replied.  "By gad, you=
 are pale!" he said. "What's=20

got into the women these days? They never used to have these confounded ner=
ves. Well, if you=20

are bent on it, I suppose there's no use trying to stop you. Go off somewhe=
re and take a rest, and=20

when you come back you'll see things differently."  She held out her hand. =
 "Good-by, Howard,"=20

she said. "I wanted you to know that I didn't--bear you any ill-will--that =
I blame myself as much as=20

you. More, if anything. I hope you will be happy--I know you will. But I mu=
st ask you to believe me=20

when I say that I shan't come back. I--I am leaving all the valuable things=
 you gave me. You will=20

find them on my dressing-table. And I wanted to tell you that my uncle sent=
 me a little legacy from=20

my father-an unexpected one--that makes me independent."  He did not take h=
er hand, but was=20

staring at her now, incredulously.  "You mean you are actually going?" he e=
xclaimed.  "Yes."  "But-

-what shall I say to Mr. Wing? What will he think?"  Despite the ache in he=
r heart, she smiled.=20

"Does it make any difference what Mr. Wing thinks?" she asked gently. "Need=
 he know? Isn't this=20

a matter which concerns us alone? I shall go off, and after a certain time =
people will understand=20

that I am not coming back."  "But--have you considered that it may interfer=
e with my prospects?"=20

he asked.  "Why should it? You are invaluable to Mr. Wing. He can't afford =
to dispense with your=20

services just because you will be divorced. That would be ridiculous. Some =
of his own associates=20

are divorced."  "Divorced!" he cried, and she saw that he had grown pasty w=
hite. "On what=20

grounds? Have you been--"  He did not finish.  "No," she said, "you need fe=
ar no scandal. There=20

will be nothing in any way harmful to your--prospects."  "Is Mr. Lethbridge=
 at home?" asked one of=20

the men.  "No, sir," replied 'Melia Jane; "he's at his bank."  "Is Mrs. Let=
hbridge in?"  "Yes, sir."=20

"Her niece, Miss Phoebe Farebrother, is stopping here, is she not?"  "Yes, =
sir."  "Is _she_ in?"=20

"Yes, sir; but you can't see her, if that's what you've come for."  "Why ca=
n't we see her?"  "'Cause=20

she's too ill to be seen by anybody but us. Poor thing! she's no sooner out=
 of one fit than she's into=20

another."  "Ah!" And the speaker glanced at his companion. "I'm sorry to he=
ar it--very, very sorry."=20

His voice was soothing and sympathizing, and 'Melia Jane, who had not been =
too favourably=20

impressed by the strangers, became instantly mollified. "How long has she b=
een ill?"  "Oh, come!"=20

exclaimed 'Melia Jane, relapsing into her original view. "_You_ don't belon=
g to the family, as I'm=20

aware of."  "No, we do not, my good girl," observed the man; "but that woul=
d not prevent me from=20

feeling pity for any young lady who is ill, I hope." He smiled so kindly up=
on 'Melia Jane that she did=20

not know what to think of him. "Perhaps it's what occurred last night that =
has upset her?"  "I don't=20

know what occurred last night," said 'Melia Jane, sharply; "do you?"  "Why,=
 my girl, a number of=20

things occur every night. Which particular one do you refer to?"  "I once k=
nowed a girl," said 'Melia=20

Jane, with an air of scornful defiance, "who knowed another girl who had a =
friend who lived in=20

Pump Court."  "Well?" said the stranger, seemingly much amused.  "In Pump C=
ourt he lived," said=20

'Melia Jane. "And he lived _by_ it as well as _in_ it. Lor' bless you! The =
artful way in which he'd=20

pump people, so's to get out of 'em every blessed thing he wanted to know--=
it was a sight, that's=20

what it was!"  The man laughed heartily. "So you think we've come to pump y=
ou, my good girl!=20

Perhaps you're right and perhaps you're wrong. Now if I were to ask you whe=
ther Miss Phoebe=20

Farebrother slept at home last night--I mean here, in her aunt's house--I s=
uppose you would call=20



that pumping?"  "I should--and I shouldn't answer you."  "But why, my good =
girl?--why? Is there=20


_
"What can I do?" he said, though more to himself than to her. Her quick ear=
 detected in his voice a=20

note of relief. And yet, he struck in her, standing helplessly smoking in t=
he middle of the floor,=20

chords of pity.  "You can do nothing, Howard," she said. "If you lived with=
 me from now to the=20

millennium you couldn't make me love you, nor could you love me--the way I =
must be loved. Try to=20

realize it. The wrench is what you dread. After it is over you will be much=
 more contented, much=20

happier, than you have been with me. Believe me."  His next remark astonish=
ed her.  "What's the=20

use of being so damned precipitate?" he demanded.  "Precipitate!"  "Because=
 I can stand it no=20

longer. I should go mad," she answered.  He took a turn up and down the roo=
m, stopped=20

suddenly, and stared at her with eyes that had grown smaller. Suspicion is =
slow to seize the=20

complacent. Was it possible that simple a matter? However, I will _not_ ask=
 you, and in proof that=20

I'm not quite the bad sort of fellow you take me for, I will just inquire w=
hether this brooch belongs=20

to Miss Farebrother."  He produced the brooch which Mrs. Pamflett had given=
 to Phoebe on her=20

birthday.  "Yes, it's hern," said 'Melia Jane, holding out her hand for it.=
  "Did she wear it=20

yesterday?"  "Pumping ag'in!"  "My good girl, you're enough to put one out =
of patience. Isn't it an=20

act of kindness to restore lost property? But one must be sure first that i=
t gets back into the hands=20

of the right owner. Can you remember whether Miss Farebrother wore this bro=
och yesterday?"=20

"No, I can't remember. And now I come to think of it, I 'ain't seen her wea=
r it for a long time past."=20

"But she wore this yesterday." He produced a veil.  "Yes," said 'Melia Jane=
, a little eagerly; "she=20

had it on when she went away last night=20


_
Honora, with an instinct of what was coming, held up her head. Had he been =
angry, had he been a=20

man, how much humiliation he would have spared her!  "So you're in love!" h=
e said. "I might have=20

known that something was at the bottom of this."  She took account of and q=
uivered at the many=20

meanings behind his speech --meanings which he was too cowardly to voice in=
 words.  "Yes," she=20

answered, "I am in love--in love as I never hoped to be--as I did not think=
 it possible to be. My love=20

is such that I would go through hell fire for the sake of it. I do not expe=
ct you to believe me when I=20

tell you that such is not the reason why I am leaving you. If you had loved=
 me with the least spark=20

of passion, if I thought I were in the least bit needful to you as a woman =
and as a soul, as a helper=20

and a confidante, instead of a mere puppet to advertise your prosperity, th=
is would not--could not--

have happened. I love a man who would give up the world for me to-morrow. I=
 have but one life to=20

live, and I am going to find happiness if I can."  She paused, afire with a=
n eloquence that had=20

come unsought. But her husband only stared at her. She was transformed beyo=
nd his recognition.=20

Surely he had not married this woman! And, if the truth be told, down in hi=
s secret soul whispered=20

a small, congratulatory voice. Although he did not yet fully realize it, he=
 was glad he had not.=20

Honora, with an involuntary movement, pressed her handkerchief to her eyes.=
  "Good-by,=20

Howard," she said. "I--I did not expect you to understand. If I had stayed,=
 I should have made you=20

miserably unhappy."  He took her hand in a dazed manner, as though he knew =
not in the least=20

what he was doing. He muttered something and found speech impossible. He gu=
lped once,=20

uncomfortably. The English language had ceased to be a medium. Great is the=
 force of habit! In=20

the emergency he reached for his cigarette case.  Honora had given orders t=
hat the carriage was=20

to wait at the door. The servants might suspect, but that was all. Her maid=
 had been discreet. She=20

drew down her veil as she descended the steps, and told the coachman to dri=
ve to the station.  It=20

was raining. Leaning forward from under the hood as the horses started, she=
 took her last look at=20

the lilacs.     CHAPTER VIII  IN WHICH THE LAW BETRAYS A HEART  It was stil=
l raining when=20

she got into a carriage at Boston and drove under the elevated tracks, thro=
ugh the narrow, slippery=20

business streets, to the hotel. From the windows of her room, as the night =
fell, she looked out=20

across the dripping foliage of the Common. Below her, and robbed from that =
sacred ground, were=20

the little granite buildings that housed the entrances to the subway, and f=
or a long time she stood=20

watching the people crowding into these. Most of them had homes to go to! I=
n the gathering gloom=20

the arc-lights shone, casting yellow streaks on the glistening pavement; wa=
gons and carriages=20

plunged into the maelstrom at the corner; pedestrians dodged and slipped; l=
ightnings flashed from=20

overhead wires, and clanging trolley cars pushed their greater bulk through=
 the mass. And=20

presently the higher toned and more ominous bell of an ambulance sounded on=
 its way to the=20

scene of an accident.  It was Mathilde who ordered her dinner and pressed h=
er to eat. But she had=20

no heart for food. In her bright sitting-room, with the shades tightly draw=
n, an inexpressible=20

loneliness assailed her. A large  "Why don't you finish, my good girl? When=
 she went away last=20

night to Parksides." He returned the brooch and the veil to his pocket. "I =
won't trouble you any=20

more. Be kind enough to tell Mrs. Lethbridge that we wish to see her."  "Wh=
at name shall I say?"=20

"Never mind the name; she will not know it. You can say, on particular busi=
ness."  Leaving the=20

men in the passage with the street door open, 'Melia Jane went up to Phoebe=
's bedroom, and=20

gave the message to her mistress, who came down at once, and asked the stra=
nger what his=20

business was.  "It will be best for me to speak to you in private," said th=
e man.  Aunt Leth led the=20



visitors into the parlour, and the one who had spoken all through commenced=
 the conversation.=20

"My name is Beeminster, and I am attached to the police force. I am engaged=
 upon an inquiry of a=20

serious nature, and it has, in the first place, led me to your house."  Aun=
t Leth's heart fainted within=20

her. Knowing nothing whatever of business, or of the pains and penalties at=
tending the=20

dishonouring of an acceptance for three hundred pounds, she feared that the=
 terrible anxieties=20

through which she had passed with respect to her husband's liability were a=
bout to be renewed.=20

She had believed that this special difficulty had been happily tided over f=
or a time, and her reason=20

for this belief needs in this place a word of explanation.  Almost heart-br=
oken, Uncle Leth had left=20

his home on this morning to walk to the bank in which he had held an honour=
able though humble=20

position all his life. He could not touch his breakfast; he could not speak=
; he could scarcely see=20

before him. So utterly prostrate was he that his wife had refrained from ut=
tering a single word upon=20

another anxious subject which filled her with alarm. Phoebe had been absent=
 all the night, and had=20

returned as Uncle Leth was getting out of bed. Her condition was so pitiabl=
e as to cause Aunt Leth=20

and Fanny the utmost distress. There were marks of violence upon her, she w=
as bruised and=20

bleeding, her clothes were torn, her mind was distraught. They could get no=
thing from her but sobs=20

and tears. On the previous night when her absence was remarked, and they le=
arnt from 'Melia=20

Jane that she had gone to Parksides, they were almost distracted. Tom Barle=
y, being off duty, was=20

sought for immediately, and upon being made acquainted with what had taken =
place, had started=20

off instantly for Parksides to protect Phoebe and bring her back. He had no=
t much time to spare,=20

as he had to go on his beat again early in the morning; but he managed to g=
et to Parksides and to=20

reconnoitre for half an hour. He did not succeed in finding Phoebe, and he =
was compelled to=20

return to London without her--determined, however, to go back to Parksides =
when he was free=20

again, and restore Phoebe to her relatives. Phoebe's reappearance in Camden=
 Town rendered the=20

carrying out of his resolution unnecessary. He had seen something at Parksi=
des which perplexed=20

and troubled him; but he had mentioned it to no one.  Utterly absorbed and =
overwhelmed by the=20

disgrace and ruin with which he was threatened, Uncle Leth knew nothing of =
Phoebe's absence or=20

return, and he started for his bank with so heavy a weight upon his heart t=
hat he almost prayed for=20

death. No day-dreams on this morning; the reality was too crushing. He thou=
ght it was a dull=20

morning; but the sun was shining and the air was sweet So he walked on--to =
ruin, as=20


_
could not bear to look at it, and yet her eyes, from time to time, were fat=
ally drawn thither. It was of=20

a young girl taking leave of her lover, in early Christian times, before en=
tering the arena. It haunted=20

Honora, and wrought upon her imagination to such a pitch that she went into=
 her bedroom to write.=20

For a long time nothing more was written of the letter than "Dear Uncle Tom=
 and Aunt Mary": what=20

to say to them?     "I do not know what you will think of me. I do not know=
, to-night,    what to think=20

of myself. I have left Howard. It  But a wonderful thing occurred, and yet =
a simple thing. For,=20

surely, when, within a quarter of a mile of the bank he was clapped on the =
shoulder by Fred=20

Cornwall, an incident so trivial was scarcely worth a second thought. But w=
hen he reflected upon it=20

afterward, he was of the opinion that it was worth much more than a second =
thought, and that=20

indeed it was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to him, that for =
the first time in his life=20

he should be clapped on his shoulder by Fred Cornwall while he was walking =
to business. Not=20


_
was cruel to me, or untrue. He does not love me, nor I him. I    cannot exp=
ect you, who have=20

known the happiness of marriage, to    realize the tortures of it without l=
ove. My pain in telling you=20

this now is all the greater because I realize your belief as to the    sacr=
edness of the tie--and it is=20

not your fault that you wonderful thing, but the most fortunate, as it turn=
ed out.  Fred greeted him=20

heartily and cordially, and he made no reply. At first Fred did not notice =
his strange silence, for the=20

young man was bubbling over with an event of great importance which had on =
this morning=20

occurred in his own career. He had received a brief in a case=20
