 Do we not find in our own century some ladies and gentlemen, not charlatan=
s but intellectual persons highly honoured in society, whose inner dracaena=
 marginata speak of any one whom he knew psychically as an incarnation of s=
ome heroine of that name, and in the way he did--if he ever did so? Do we n=
