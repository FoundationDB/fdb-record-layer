 Adams has yet put forth, and will be as eagerly perused as any that has bo=

Again the vice-president shook his head.  "Your methods are always pretty c=
rude, Kittredge," he=20

commented. "You took another long chance when you forged my name to a teleg=
ram for as=20

shrewd a young lawyer as Evan Blount. But go on. You got Blount out of the =
way--then what?"=20

"Then I went after Gryson again. The little woman's hint hit the bull's-eye=

Another little mystery bobbed up there. Chief Robertson winked one eye at m=

summing-up rejoinder. And then: "I think that is all--for this morning. Go =
