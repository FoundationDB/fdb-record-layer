Special rules, set forth in the from the south, and no Ronald there, to manage everything for them.  For her heart was very affectionate; and she had but few friends; and Glasgow was a great distance away.  There were some other fancies too, and _
for the lack of the proper courage. Let your speech continue during the whole run of an honest 

statement. But it's all right. I have some indisputable proofs--"  "Good morning!" It was young 

Riggins who joined us. "I read that story of yours, sir. It was good, I must say. It is just like 

something that happened in my own personal experience. A few months ago, I was down at 

Homosassa, Florida; and, while I was there, some clam diggers discovered a large chest of old 

Spanish coin. They sold them to the Government for thirty thousand dollars, and have now retired 

from the clam business."  That was a tale rather to the point, and Jamesby received it soberly; but 

I laughed out of sheer appreciation of another good yarn.  I did not see Jamesby for several days. 

I knew it was his busy season; but I really wished to know how he fared. So, I decided to look him 

up. He was a happy, enthusiastic, ingenuous young fellow, and I had become quite accustomed to 

having his cheerful company occasionally.  I found him sitting at his desk in intense abstraction; 

but he soon observed me standing before him, and quickly arose with a hearty welcome, such as 

he alone knew how to extend.  "I tell you, sir," he said enthusiastically, "it is a magnificent project!" 

"What is?" I answered. "I don't know--"  "Oh," he continued, absently, "I forgot; it was my brother I 

was talking with. But I have investigated thoroughly the whole subject of those blockade runners, 

and I believe the said, with emphasis.  'Oh, Meenie, do you think if Ronald were to get on well and 

make more money than he has now, he would come back here, and bring me too, for a week 

maybe, just to see every one again?'  'I cannot tell you that, Maggie,' the elder girl said, rather 

absently.  After this their discussion of the strange and unknown future that lay before them 

languished somehow; for Meenie seemed preoccupied, and scarcely as blithe and hopeful as she 

had striven to appear.  But when Maggie rose to return home--saying that it was time for her to be 

looking after Ronald's supper--her friend seemed to pull herself together somewhat, and at once 

and cheerfully accepted Maggie's invitation to come and have tea with her the following afternoon. 

'For you have been so little in to see us lately,' the small Maggie said; 'and Ronald always 

engaged with the American people--and often in the evening too as well as the whole day long.' 

'But I must make a great deal of you now that you are going away,' said Miss Douglas, smiling. 

'And Ronald--will I ask him to stay in till you come?'  But here there was some hesitation.  'Oh no, I 

would not do that--no doubt he is busy just now with his preparations for going away.  I would not 

say anything to him--you and I will have tea together by ourselves.'  The smaller girl looked up 

timidly.  'Ronald is going away too, Meenie.'  Perhaps there was a touch of reproach in the tone; at 

all events Meenie said, after a moment's

effort for the recovery of some of that money from the sea. There must be untold quantities of it 

lying there, inviting even a meagre attempt to get it. The boats can be chartered cheaply; and I 

have learned that the necessary divers can be secured on an equitable division of the spoils. 

There are many details of the organization of the enterprise which I have thought out."  His voice 

had an eager ring, and his eyes sparkled with interest.  "Jamesby, my boy," I answered calmly, 

"you are decidedly on  'Of course I should be very glad if he happened to be in the house--and--

and had the time to spare; but I think he will understand that, Maggie, without your saying as much 

to him.'  'He gave plenty of his time to the American young lady,' said Maggie, rather proudly.  'But 

I thought you and she were great friends,' Meenie said, in some surprise.  'It takes a longer time 

than that to make friends,' the girl said; and by and by she left.  Then Meenie went up to her room 

again, and sate down in front of

works from public dull, smouldering peat-fire, with its heavy lumps of shadow, and its keen edges 

of crimson, and its occasional flare of flame and shower of sparks.  There were many pictures 

there--of distant things; of the coming spring-time, with all the new wonder and gladness somehow 

gone out of it; and of the long long shining summer days, and Inver-Mudal grown lonely: and of the
