their final and for ever binding vow. It is this that was meant in _Isis Unveiled_, when it was stated 

that few of the _fakirs_ (the word _chela_ being unknown to Europe and America in those days) 

however       Pure, and honest, and self-devoted, have yet ever seen the astral     form of a purely 

_human pitar_ (an ancestor or father), otherwise     than at the solemn moment of their first and 

last initiation. It     is in the presence of his instructor, the Guru, and just before     the _vatou_-fakir 

[the just initiated chela] is despatched into     the world of the living, with his seven-knotted 

bamboo wand for     all protection, that he is suddenly placed face to face with the     unknown 

PRESENCE [of his Pitar or Father, the glorified invisible     Master, or disembodied Mahatma]. He 

sees it, and falls prostrate     at the feet of the evanescent form, but is not entrusted with the 

great secret of its evocation, for it is the supreme mystery of     the holy syllable.   The Initiate, 

says Eliphas Levi, _knows_; therefore, "he dares all and keeps silent." Says the great French 

Kabalist:       You may see him often sad, never discouraged or desperate; often     poor, never 

humbled or wretched; often persecuted, never cowed     down or vanquished. For he remembers 

the widowhood and the murder     of Orpheus, the exile and solitary death of Moses, the 

martyrdom     of the prophets, the tortures of Apollonius, the Cross of the     Saviour. He knows in 

what forlorn state died Agrippa, whose memory     is slandered to this day; he knows the trials that 

broke down the     great Paracelsus, and all that Raymond Lully had to suffer before     he arrived 

at a bloody death. He remembers Swedenborg having to     feign insanity, and losing even his 

reason before his knowledge     was forgiven to him; St. Martin, who had to hide himself all his 

life; Cagliostro, who died forsaken in the cells of the     Inquisition(532); Cazotte, who perished on 

the guillotine.     Successor of so many victims, he dares, nevertheless, but     understands the 

more the necessity to keep silent.(533)   Masonry--not the political institution known as the Scotch 

Lodge, but real Masonry, some rites of which are still preserved in the Grand Orient of France, and 

that Elias Ashmole, a celebrated English Occult Philosopher of the XVIIth century, tried in vain to 

remodel, after the manner of the Indian and Egyptian Mysteries--Masonry rests, according to 

Ragon, the great authority upon the subject, upon three fundamental degrees: the triple duty of a 

Mason is to study _whence he comes_, _what he is_, and _whither he goes_; the study that is, of 

God, of himself, and of the future transformation.(534) Masonic Initiation was modelled on that in 

the lesser Mysteries. The third degree was one used in both Egypt and India from time 

immemorial, and the remembrance of it lingers to this day in every Lodge, under the name of the 

death and resurrection of Hiram Abiff, the "Widow's Son." In Egypt the latter was called "Osiris;" in 

India "Loka-chakshu" (Eye of the World), ind "Dinakara" (day-maker) or the Sun--and the rite itself 

was everywhere named the "gate of death." The coffin, or sarcophagus, of Osiris, killed by 

Typhon, was brought in and placed in the middle of the Hall of the Dead, with the Initiates all 

around it and the candidate near by. The latter was asked whether he had participated in the 

murder, and notwithstanding his denial, and after sundry and very hard trials, the Initiator feigned 

to strike him on the head with a hatchet; he was thrown down, swathed in bandages like a 

mummy, and wept over. Then came lightning and thunder, the supposed corpse was surrounded 

with fire, and was finally raised.  Ragon speaks of a rumour that Heaven, that the Duc de Beaufort 

is to escape, he will escape; and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it."  Mazarin 

started. He was an Italian and therefore superstitious. He walked straight into the midst of the 

guards, who on seeing him were silent.  "What were you saying?" he asked with his flattering 



manner; "that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped, were you not?"  "Oh, no, my lord!" said the 

incredulous soldier. "He's well guarded now; we only said he would escape."  "Who said so?" 

"Repeat your story, Saint Laurent," replied the man, turning to the originator of the tale.  "My lord," 

said the guard, "I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel, who 

believes that, be he ever so closely watched and guarded, the Duke of Beaufort will escape before 

Whitsuntide."  "Coysel is a madman!" returned the cardinal.  "No," replied the soldier, tenacious in 

his credulity; "he has foretold many things which have come to pass; for instance, that the queen 

would have a son; that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc de Guise; and 

finally, that the coadjutor would be made cardinal. Well! the queen has not only one son, but two; 

then, Monsieur de Coligny was killed, and----"  "Yes," said Mazarin, "but the coadjutor is not yet 

made cardinal!"  "No, my lord, but he will be," answered the guard.  Mazarin made a grimace, as if 

he meant to say, "But he does not wear the cardinal's cap;" then he added:  "So, my friend, it's 

your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will escape?"  "That's my idea, my lord; and if your 

eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes, I should 

refuse it. After Whitsuntide it would be another thing."  There is nothing so convincing as a firm 

conviction. It has its own effect upon the most incredulous; and far from being incredulous, 

Mazarin was superstitious. He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room, 

where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he 

had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive.  The guard 

had, in fact, touched the cardinal in the tenderest point. During the whole five years in which the 

Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a 

secret dread of his escape. It was not possible, as he knew well, to confine for the whole of his life 

the grandson of Henry IV., especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age. But 

however and whensoever he did escape, what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he 

owed his long imprisonment; who had taken him, rich, brave, glorious, beloved by women, feared 

by men, to cut off his life's best, happiest years; for it is not life, it is merely existence, in prison! 

Meantime, Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke. But like the miser in the fable, he 

could not sleep for thinking of his treasure. Often he awoke in the night, suddenly, dreaming that 

he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beaufort. Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of 

hearing that the prisoner played, drank, sang, but that whilst playing, drinking, singing, he often 

stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to 

enter into at Vincennes.  So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep, that when 

at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him, his first words were: "Well, what's the 

matter? Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes?"  "I do not think so, my lord," said 

Bernouin; "but you will hear about him, for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your 

eminence."  "Tell him to come in," said Mazarin, arranging his pillows, so 


_
one time enacting the part of the Initiator--with having played this part in the initiatory drama so 

seriously that he actually killed the postulant when dealing him the blow with the hatchet. This 

shows that the _lesser_ Mysteries had not quite died out in the second century A.D.  The 

Mysteries were carried into South and Central America, Northern Mexico and Peru by the 

Atlanteans in those days when       A pedestrian from the North [of what was once upon a time 

also     India] might have reached--hardly wetting his feet--the Alaskan     Peninsula, through 

Manchooria, across the _future_ Gulf of     Tartary, the Kurile and Aleutian Islands; while another 

traveller,     furnished with a canoe and starting from the South, could have     walked over from 

Siam, crossed the Polynesian Islands and trudged     into any part of the continent of South 

America.(535)   They continued to exist down to the day of the Spanish invaders. These destroyed 

the Mexican and Peruvian records, but were prevented from laying their desecrating hands upon 

the many Pyramids--the lodges of an ancient Initiation--whose ruins are scattered over Puente 

Nacional, Cholula, and Teotihuacan. The ruins of Palenque, of Ococimgo in might receive the 

visitor sitting up in bed.  The officer entered, a large fat man, with an open physiognomy. His air of 

perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy.  "Approach, sir," said the cardinal.  The officer obeyed. 

"Do you know what they are saying here?"  "No, your eminence."  "Well, they say that Monsieur de 

Beaufort is going to escape from Vincennes, if he has not done so already."  The officer's face 

expressed complete stupefaction. He opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth, to inhale 

better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him, and ended by a burst of laughter, so 

violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague.  "Escape! my 

lord--escape! Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is?"  "Yes, I do, sir; 

in the donjon of Vincennes."  "Yes, sir; in a room, the walls of which are seven feet thick, with 

grated windows, each bar as thick as my arm."  "Sir," replied Mazarin, "with perseverance one 

may penetrate through a wall; with a watch-spring one may saw through an iron bar."  "Then my 

lord does not know that there are eight guards about him, four in his chamber, four in the 

antechamber, and that they never leave 


_
Central America are known to all. If the pyramids and temples of Guiengola and Mitla ever betray 

their secrets, the present Doctrine will then be shown to have been a forerunner of the grandest 

truths in Nature. Meanwhile they have all a claim to be called Mitla, "the place of sadness" and 

"the abode of the (desecrated) dead."      SECTION XXXII. TRACES OF THE MYSTERIES.   Says 

the _Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia_, art. "Sun:"       In all times, the Sun has necessarily played an 

important part as     a symbol, and especially in Freemasonry. The W.M. represents the     rising 

sun, the J.W. the sun at the meridian, and the S.W. the     setting sun. In the Druidical rites, the 

Arch-Druid represented     the sun, and was aided by two other officers, one representing the 

Moon in the West, and the other the Sun at the South in its     meridian. It is quite unnecessary to 

enter into any lengthened     discussion on this symbol.   It is the more "unnecessary" since J. M. 

Ragon has discussed it very fully, as one may find at the end of Section XXIX., where part of his 

explanations have been quoted. Freemasonry derived her rites from the East, as we have said. 

And if it be true to say of the modern Rosicrucians that "they are invested with a knowledge of 

chaos, not perhaps a very desirable acquisition," the remark is still more true when applied to all 

the other branches of Masonry, since the knowledge of their members about the full signification of 

their symbols is _nil_. Dozens of hypotheses are resorted to, one more unlikely than the other, as 

to the "Round Towers" of Ireland; one fact is enough to show the ignorance of the Masons, 

namely, that, according to the _Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia_, the idea that they are connected 

with Masonic Initiation may be at once dismissed as unworthy of notice. The "Towers," which are 

found throughout the East in Asia, were connected with the Mystery-Initiations, namely, with the 

Vishvakarma and the Vikarttana rites. The candidates for Initiation were placed in them for three 

days and three nights, wherever there was no temple with a subterranean crypt close at hand. 

These round towers were built for no other purposes. Discredited as are all such monuments of 

Pagan origin by the Christian clergy, who thus "soil their own nest," they are still the living and 

indestructible relics of the Wisdom of old. Nothing exists in this objective and illusive world of ours 

that cannot be made to serve two purposes--a good and a bad one. Thus in later ages, the 

Initiates of the _Left_ Path and the anthropomorphists took in hand most of those venerable ruins, 

then silent and deserted by their first wise inmates, and turned them indeed into phallic 

monuments. But this was a deliberate, wilful, and vicious misinterpretation of their real meaning, a 

deflection from their first use. The Sun--though ever, even for the multitudes, {~GREEK SMALL

UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA WITH 

PERISPOMENI~}, "the God of Good Counsel" of Orpheus--had in every exoteric popular religion a 



dual aspect which was anthropomorphised by the profane. Thus the Sun was Osiris-_Typhon_, 

Ormuzd-_Ahriman_, Bel-Jupiter and _Baal_, the life-giving and the _death_-giving luminary. And 

thus one and the same monolith, pillar, pyramid, tower or temple, originally built to glorify the first 

principle or aspect, might become in time an idol-fane, or worse, a phallic emblem in its crude and 

brutal form. The Lingam of the Hindus has a spiritual and highly philosophical meaning, while the 

missionaries see in it but an "indecent emblem;" it has just the meaning which is to be found in all 

those baalim, chammanim, and the bamoth with the pillars of unhewn stone of the Bible, set up for 

the glorification of the male Jehovah. But this does not alter the fact that the pureia of the Greeks, 

the nur-hags of Sardinia, the teocalli of Mexico, etc., were all in the beginning of the same 

character as the "Round Towers" of Ireland. They were sacred places of Initiation.  In 1877, the 

writer, quoting the authority and opinions of some most eminent scholars, ventured to assert that 

there was a great difference between the terms _Chrestos_ and _Christos_, a difference having a 

profound and Esoteric meaning. Also that while _Christos_ means "to live" and "to be born into a 

new life," _Chrestos_, in "Initiation" phraseology, signified the death of the inner, lower, or 

personal nature in man; thus is given the key to the Brahmanical title, the twice-born; and finally, 

There were _Chrestians_ long before the era of Christianity, and     the Essenes belonged to 

them.(536)...   For this epithets sufficiently opprobrious to characterise the writer could hardly be 

found. And yet then as well as now, the author never attempted a statement of such a serious 

nature without showing as many learned  "But he leaves his room, he plays at tennis at the Mall?" 

"Sir, those amusements are allowed; but if your eminence wishes it, we will discontinue the 

permission."  "No, no!" cried Mazarin, fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he 

would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement. He then asked 

with whom he played.  "My lord, either with the officers of the guard, with the other prisoners, or 

with me."  "But does he not approach the walls while playing?"  "Your eminence doesn't know 

those walls; they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life 

to risk his neck by jumping off."  "Hum!" said the cardinal, beginning to feel more comfortable. 

"You mean to say, then, my dear Monsieur la Ramee----"  "That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can 

contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird, I will continue answerable for him."  "Take care! 

you assert a great deal," said Mazarin. "Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to 

Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison, and that 

he had found out forty ways of escaping."  "My lord, if among these forty there had been one good 

way he would have been out long ago."  "Come, come; not such a fool as I fancied!" thought 

Mazarin.  "Besides, my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes," 

continued La Ramee, "and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beaufort." 

"Yes, but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes absent."  "When he is absent I am there."  "But 

when you leave him, for instance?"  "Oh! when I leave him, I place in my stead a bold fellow who 

aspires to be his majesty's special guard. I promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner. 

During the three weeks that he has been with me, I have only had to reproach him with one thing--

being too severe with the prisoners."  "And who is this Cerberus?"  "A certain Monsieur Grimaud, 

my lord."  "And what was he before he went to Vincennes?"  "He was in the country, as I was told 

by the person who recommended him to me."  "And who recommended this man to you?"  "The 

steward of the Duc de Grammont."  "He is not a gossip, I hope?"  "Lord a mercy, my lord! I thought 



for a long time that he was dumb; he answers only by signs. It seems his former master 

accustomed him to that."  "Well, dear Monsieur la Ramee," replied the cardinal "let him prove a 

true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a 

uniform to make him respectable, and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the 

king's health."  Mazarin was large in promises,--quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so 

bepraised by La Ramee; for he said nothing and did much.  It was now nine o'clock. The cardinal, 

therefore, got up, perfumed himself, dressed, and went to the queen to tell her what had detained 

him. The queen, who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort than the cardinal himself, 

and who was almost as superstitious as he was, made him repeat word for word all La Ramee's 

praises of his deputy. Then, when the cardinal had ended:  "Alas, sir! why have we not a Grimaud 

near every prince?"  "Patience!" replied Mazarin, with his Italian smile; "that may happen one day; 

but in the meantime----"  "Well, in the meantime?"  "I shall still take precautions."  And he wrote to 

D'Artagnan to hasten his return.     17. Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of 

Vincennes.   The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means 

of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court, was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused 

at the Palais Royal.  He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the 

fruitlessness of any attempt at escape. His vengeance, therefore, consisted in coining curses on 

the head of Mazarin; he even tried to make some verses on him, but soon gave up the attempt, for 

Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying, he had the 

greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose.  The duke was the grandson of Henry IV. and 

Gabrielle d'Estrees--as good-natured, as brave, as proud, and above all, as Gascon as his 

ancestor, but less elaborately educated. After having been for some time after the death of Louis 

XIII. the favorite, the confidant, the first man, in short, at the court, he had been obliged to yield his 

place to Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor; and eventually, as he was 

stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position, the queen had had him arrested and sent to 

Vincennes in charge of Guitant, who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this 

history and whom we shall see again. It is understood, of course, that when we say "the queen," 

Mazarin is meant.  During the five years of this seclusion, which would have improved and 

matured the intellect of any other man, M. de Beaufort, had he not affected to brave the cardinal, 

despise princes, and walk alone without adherents or disciples, would either have regained his 

liberty or made partisans. But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the 

cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister. 

After having failed in poetry, Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing. He drew portraits, with a piece of 

coal, of the cardinal; and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness, he 

wrote under the picture that there 


_
was said:       Lepsius shows that the word _Nofre_ means Chrestos, "good," and     that one of 

the titles of Osiris, "Onnofre," must be translated     "the goodness of God made manifest." "The 

worship of Christ was     not universal at this early date," explains Mackenzie, "by which I     mean 

that Christolatry had not been introduced; but the worship of     _Chrestos_--the Good Principle--

had preceded it by many centuries,     and even survived the general adoption of Christianity, as 

shown     on monuments still in existence...." Again, we have an inscription     which is pre-

Christian on an epitaphial tablet (Spon. _Misc.     Erud._, Ant., x. xviii. 2). {~GREEK CAPITAL

xxi.) gives     us another example from the catacombs--"AElia Chreste, in     Pace."(537)   To-day 

the writer is able to add to all those testimonies the corroboration of an erudite author, who proves 

whatever he undertakes to show on the authority of geometrical demonstration. There is a most 

curious passage with remarks and explanations in the _Source of Measures_, whose author has 

probably never heard of the "Mystery-God" Visvakarma of the early Aryans. Treating on the 

difference between the terms Chrest and Christ, he ends by saying that:       There were two 

Messiahs: one who went down into the pit for the     salvation of this world; this was the Sun shorn 

of his golden     rays, and crowned with blackened ones (symbolising this loss), as     the thorns: 

the other was the triumphant Messiah mounting up to     the summit of the arch of heaven, and 

_personified as the Lion of     the Tribe of Judah_. original: "Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb, 

Mazarin." Monsieur de Chavigny, the governor of Vincennes, waited upon the duke to request that 

he would amuse himself in some other way, or that at all events, if he drew likenesses, he would 

not put mottoes underneath them. The next day the prisoner's room was full of pictures and 

mottoes. Monsieur de Beaufort, in common with many other prisoners, was bent upon doing things 

that were prohibited; and the only resource the governor had was, one day when the duke was 

playing at tennis, to efface all these drawings, consisting chiefly of profiles. M. de Beaufort did not 

venture to draw the cardinal's fat face.  The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having, as he 

said, cleaned his drawing-paper for him; he then divided the walls of his room into compartments 

and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarin's life. In one was depicted 



the "Illustrious Coxcomb" receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio, whose servant he 

had been; another, the "Illustrious Mazarin" acting the part of Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that 

name; a third, the "Illustrious Mazarin" stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de 

Chavigny, who had expected to have it; a fourth, the "Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin" refusing to 

give Laporte, the young king's valet, clean sheets, and saving that "it was quite enough for the 

king of France to have clean sheets every three months."  The governor, of course, thought proper 

to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to 

deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner. To this Monsieur de Beaufort 

replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him, he 

wished to make himself celebrated in the arts; since he could not be a Bayard, he would become a 

Raphael or a Michael Angelo. Nevertheless, one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in 

the meadow his fire was put out, his charcoal all removed, taken away; and thus his means of 

drawing utterly destroyed.  The poor duke swore, fell into a rage, yelled, and declared that they 

wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior of 

Vendome; but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained 

without any fire in the room all the winter.  His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his 

keepers. With this animal, which he called Pistache, he was often shut up for hours alone, 

superintending, as every one supposed, its education. At last, when Pistache was sufficiently well 

trained, Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a 


_
humiliation and once holding it in his control as the law of     creation, He being Jehovah.   And 

then the author proceeds to give "the fact" that "there were two Messiahs," etc., as quoted above. 

And this--leaving the divine and mystic character and claim for Jesus entirely independent of this 

was going to have in his apartment.  The party assembled, the room was lighted with waxlights, 

and the prisoner, with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room, had traced a long 

white line, representing a cord, on the floor. Pistache, on a signal from his master, placed himself

into which the Eastern Initiate was made to descend was, as shown before, Patala, one of the 

seven regions of the raised himself on his hind paws, and holding in his front paws a wand with 

which clothes used to be beaten, he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a 

rope-dancer. Having been several times up and down it, he gave the wand back to his master and 

began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again.  The intelligent creature was 

received with loud applause.  The first part of
