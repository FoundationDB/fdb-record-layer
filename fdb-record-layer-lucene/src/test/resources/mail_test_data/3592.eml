the beginning."  The next year, 1837, Mercer, now in West Virginia but adjoining Giles County, 

Virginia, was formed. The Act authorizing its creation is as follows: "All that part of the counties of 

Giles and Tazewell contained within the following boundary lines ... shall form one distinct and 

new county and be called and known by the name of Mercer county in memory of general Hugh 

Mercer who fell at Princeton." Appropriately Harvard University, began at an earlier period to 

enlighten the public on this subject; they began to form collections; Harvard received a select 

cabinet from France and England; and Mr. Smith, of Philadelphia, (although, returning from 

Europe fraught with scientific acquisitions, he perished tragically near his native shores,) left his 

collection to enrich the Museum of the American Philosophical Society.  Still, however, 


_
seat of Mercer County is Princeton.  In 1838 the Virginia counties of Greene and Roanoke were 

set up.  The Act for the former county is as follows: "So much of the county of Orange as it lies 

next to and adjoining the counties of Madison, Rockingham and Albemarle and west of a line 

beginning at Cave's old mill (now James Jackson's) on the Madison county line and running 

thence a straight line to where Whitelow's mill run intersects the Albemarle county line shall form 

one distinct and new county and be called and known by the name of Greene county in memory of 

general Nathaniel Greene who served his country in the revolutionary war."  It may be mentioned 

that this is the second county in Virginia honoring General Greene. The correct spelling for his first 

name is Nathanael.  In Greene County lies Swift Run Gap. This is the gap in the Blue Ridge 

mountains over which in September 1715, Governor Spotswood led his adventurous band into the 

beautiful Valley of Virginia. Westward expansion began at this date.  The second county created in 

1838 was Roanoke composed of that portion of Botetourt lying next to the southwestern parts of 

Montgomery, Franklin and Bedford. Roanoke was the name applied by the early colonists to the 

shell-beads of different colors used by the Indians as a medium of exchange. The river had long 

been known as Roanoke, hence it seems likely that the county took its name from the river. 

Roanoke County is thus bounded: "beginning at a point on the Blue ridge which divides the 

counties of Bedford and Botetourt, thence northwest to the house now the residence of John 

Bonsack on Glade creek so as to include the said Bonsack in the new county, thence a line to the 

house of Thomas Barnes including said Barnes in the county, and so as to leave John W. 

Thompson in the county of Botetourt, thence a straight line crossing the Catawba Valley at a point 

one mile due north of Mrs. Garwood's; thence crossing Craig's creek (passing the house of John 

Spessard on Craig's creek so as to leave the said Spessard in the old county) to the top of the 

mountain which divides the waters of Craig's creek and Sinking creek, thence westwardly along 

the top of the mountain to the point where the lines of Botetourt, Montgomery and Giles counties 

meet, thence with the line which divided the county of Botetourt impression was produced on the 

public mind; a few lights were indeed held out, but they were lights twinkling in an almost 

impervious gloom.  The return of the late Benjamin D. Perkins, and of the late Dr. A. Bruce, from 

Europe, in 1802 and 3, with their collections, then the most complete and beautiful that this 

country had ever seen; the return of Colonel Gibbs, in 1805, with his extensive and magnificent 

cabinet; his consequent excursions and researches into our mineralogy; the commencement, 

about this time, of courses of lectures on mineralogy, in several of our colleges, and of collections 

by them and by many individuals; the return of Mr. Maclure, in 1807; his Herculean labour in 

surveying the United States geologically, by personal examination; and the institution of the 

American Journal of Mineralogy, by Dr. Bruce, in 1810;--these are among the most prominent 

events, which, in the course of a few years, have totally changed the face of this science in the 

United States.  During the last ten years, it has been cultivated with great ardour, and with great 

success: many interesting discoveries in American mineralogy have been made; and this science, 

with its sister science, Geology, is fast arresting the public attention. In such a state of things, 

books relating to mineralogy would of course be eagerly sought for.  No work, anterior to Kirwan, 

could be consulted by the student with much advantage, on account of the wonderful progress, 

which, within forty or fifty years, has been made in mineralogy. Even Kirwan, who performed a 

most important service to the science, was become, in some considerable degree, imperfect and 



obsolete; the German treatises, the fruitful fountains from which the science had flowed over 

Europe, were not translated; neither were those of the French; and this was the more to be 

regretted, because they had mellowed down the harshness and enriched the sterility of the 

German method of description, besides adding many interesting discoveries of their own. It is true 

we possessed the truly valuable treatise of Professor Jameson, the most complete in our 

language. But the expense of the work made it unattainable by most of our students, and the 

undeviating strictness with which the highly respectable author has adhered to the German mode 

of description, gave it an aspect

the county of Montgomery to the point at which the said line joins the Bedford line, thence with the 

Bedford line to the beginning."  In this same area in the following year the county of Pulaski was 

created from the western end of Montgomery and the eastern end of Wythe. Its name honored the 

Polish patriot Count Casimir Pulaski who, exiled from his homeland, came to America and joined 

General Washington's army. He participated in important engagements and finally fell on 11 

October 1779 unsuccessfully defending Savannah, Georgia.  The bounds of Pulaski County are 

thus set forth: "beginning at a line dividing the county of Giles from Montgomery on New river, 

thence with same line to the head of a hollow above Hiram Davis's on Little Walker's creek; thence 

to a point on the main road between the lands of John T. Sayers and Harvey Shepherd including 

the plantation of David G. Shepherd, thence to the mouth of Pine run on New river, thence to the 

Grayson county line; including Sally King's plantation on Reed island; thence with the Grayson line 

to the Floyd line, and with the same to the mouth of Indian creek on Little river, and with the same 

including the farm of Creed Taylor to New river, and with the other book. We are, however, well 

aware of the value of this work, especially in the improved edition. It must, without doubt, be in the 

hands of every one who would be master of the science; but it is much better adapted to the 

purposes of proficients than of beginners.  The mineralogical articles dispersed through Aikin's 

Dictionary are exceedingly valuable; but, from the high price of the work, they are inaccessible to 

most persons.  The most recent of the French systems, that by Brongniart, seemed to combine 

nearly all the requisites that could be desired in an elementary treatise; and a translation of it 

would probably, ere this, have been given to the American public, had we not been led to expect 

the work of Professor Cleaveland, which, it was anticipated, would at least possess one important 

advantage over the work of Brongniart, and every other; it would exhibit, more or less extensively, 

_American localities_, and give the leading features of our natural mineral associations.  Thus it 

appears[8] that the work of Professor Cleaveland was eminently needed; the science, at large, 

needed it; and to American mineralogists it was nearly indispensable. It appeared too at a very 

opportune moment. 


_
1840-1850 FLOOD TIDE, SIXTEEN NEW COUNTIES  Three years elapsed before another 

county was needed and it was not until 1842 that the county of Marion was formed from the 

southern part of Monongalia and the northern part of Harrison. The name given it was "in honor to 

and in memory of general Francis Marion who served his country in the war of the revolution." This 

county now lies in West Virginia.  Also in 1842, a new county in the southwestern area of Virginia 

was formed from Grayson. It was thus bounded: "beginning on the North Carolina line at or near 

Fisher's peak and running thence a straight line across the said county of Grayson (so as to cross 

Chestnut creek not have found many readers. Now it is sustained by the prevailing curiosity, and 

diffused state of information regarding mineralogy; and, in turn, no cause could operate more 

effectually to cherish this curiosity, and to diffuse this information still more widely, than this book. 

Professor Cleaveland is therefore entitled to our thanks for undertaking this task; and, in this age 

of book-making, it is no small negative praise if an author be acquitted of _unnecessarily_ adding 

to the already onerous mass of books.  With respect to the PLAN of this work, Professor 

Cleaveland has, with good judgment, availed himself of the excellencies of both the German and 

French

thence along said Wythe line to the line of Pulaski county thence along said Pulaski line to line of 

Floyd county, thence along said Floyd line to the line of Patrick; thence along the said Patrick line 

to the North Carolina line thence along said North Carolina line to the point of beginning ... and be 

called and known by the name of Carroll in memory of Charles Carroll of Carrollton." Charles 

Carroll, one of the Maryland Signers of the Declaration of Independence, had been the last 

survivor of this noble group, dying in 1832 at the age of 95 years.  The third  Mr. Werner, of 

Fribourg, in some sense not only the founder of the modern German school of mineralogy, but 

almost of the science itself, is entitled to our lasting gratitude for his system of external characters, 

first published in 1774. In this admirable treatise he has combined precision and copiousness, so 

that exact ideas are attached to every part of the descriptive language, and every character is 

meant to be defined.  It is intended that a full description of a mineral upon this plan shall entirely 

exhaust the subject, and that although many properties may

Cabell lay along the Ohio river and is now in West Virginia. This new division was to "be called 

and known by the name of Wayne county in memory and in honor of general Anthony Wayne." 

Two counties destined to be in West Virginia were set up in 1843. The first of these was Ritchie in 

the western part of the state created from portions of Lewis, Harrison and Wood. The name 

honors Thomas Ritchie, "founder and long the able editor of the _Richmond Enquirer_ and 'father 

of democracy' in Virginia."  The other county, Barbour, lying in the northeastern part of the state 

was established from areas of Harrison, Lewis and every picture shall contain _peculiar_ features, 

not to be found in any other. It would certainly appear, at first view, that this method must be 

perfect, and leave nothing farther to be desired. It has, however, been found in practice, that the 

full descriptions of the Wernerian writers are heavy and dry; they are redundant also, from the 

frequent repetition of similar properties; and from not giving due prominence to those which are 

peculiar, and therefore distinctive, they frequently fail to leave a distinct impression of any thing on 

the mind, and thus, in the midst of what is called by the writers of this school a
