The Librarian started at his words and jumped to his feet. "You give me an idea, my Lord Mayor!" 

he cried. "Can we not cause him to change his mind? Can we not interest him in our books, 

enthrall him in the Chronicles of Kisington, so that he will cease to make war? Can we not at least 

gain time until our King Victor and his allies shall come to our aid?"  _Boom!_ went the cannon, 

and _Crash!_ the statue of a great poet fell from the portal of the library.  The Lord Mayor 

shuddered. "It is an idea," he agreed. "There is a faint hope. Something must be done, and that 

quickly. How shall we begin, Sir Librarian?"  The Librarian turned to the shelves behind him and 

took down at random a book bound in red-and-gold. "Here, let us begin with this," he said. "It may 

not be the best of all our Chronicles, but if the warlike King can be induced to read it through, it 

may serve to hold his wrath for a space."  "Who will go with the volume into the enemy's camp?" 

asked the Lord Mayor dubiously.  "We must send our best reader," said the Librarian. "Red Rex 

must hear the tale read aloud, the better to hold his unaccustomed attention."  "Surely, you are the 

best reader, Sir Librarian," urged the Lord Mayor generously. "How we all admire your style and 

diction!"  _Crash!_ The rainbow window above their heads was shivered into a thousand pieces. 

The Lord Mayor turned pale. "We must make haste!" he urged, pushing the Librarian gently by the 

elbow.  "Nay," said the Librarian coolly, releasing himself. "There is one who reads far better than 

I. It is a young boy, the son of a poor widow living on the High Street. Harold is his name, and he 

reads as sweetly as a nightingale sings. Let us send for him at the same time when our 

messenger goes to King Victor."  "Let it be done immediately!" commanded the Lord Mayor.  This 

happened on a Saturday, when the boys were not at school. But on account of the bombardment 

of the city, the Lord Mayor had already given orders that every child should remain in his own 

home that morning. So Harold was with his mother when the messenger from the Lord Mayor 

knocked on the door of the little cottage in the High Street, and Robert and Richard did not know 

anything about it.  "Come with me!" said the messenger to Harold. "You are needed for important 

service."  "Oh, where is he going?" cried the poor, trembling mother, holding back her boy by the 

shoulders.  "He is to come directly to the library," said the messenger. "The Gutenberg-tm

"Ah! The Librarian!" The mother sighed with relief, and let her hands fall from the shoulders of 

Harold. "To that good man of peace I can trust my son, even amid this wicked bombardment." 

When Harold came to the library with the messenger, they found the beautiful portal of the building 

quite destroyed, and the windows lying in pitiful shattered fragments. They entered under a rain of
