 I had been a nervous woman I should have imagined myself dracaena marginat=
a and gave an exclamation of pleasure at a meeting so unexpected and so ple=
asant.  "Milly--Oh, I'm so delighted to see you!" cried Norah, shaking her =
friend by both hands. Had they not been in a street, she would have warmly =
embraced her. For had not Milly, when housemaid to Mrs. Lane, she had given=
 him the impression (if she had not said it in so many words) that there wa=
s no stranger in the house.  Probably she hoped that by this time I was gon=
e; but how could I go? I felt like a rat in a trap: and if I had been a ner=
vous woman I should have imagined myself _
Selina.  "No, my child," replied Mrs. Lowndes; "had I no other cause for di=
spleasure against her, I=20

would never have any one near you on whose word I could not depend. A girl =
who would teach my=20

daughter to hide anything from her parent is not likely to be very open whe=
n the fault committed is=20

her own."  The maids were then dismissed from the dining-room. How differen=
t were the feelings=20

of the two as they quitted it! Norah hurried upstairs to her own little cha=
mber, and, falling on her=20

knees, fervently thanked her heavenly Father for having preserved that char=
acter which was to her=20

more precious than life. She remembered the struggle in her own mind about =
that very same bag=20

of sovereigns to which Mr. Lowndes had referred. She had found it just at t=
he time when her=20

uncle's influence was beginning to tell powerfully upon her, when she was s=
eeking with earnest=20

prayer to give herself wholly to the Lord, and live as a child of God and h=
eir of heaven should live.=20

That had been a turning-point in the life of Norah. She had then by faith r=
esisted the devil, and he=20

had fled. Had she yielded to that temptation, and a very strong one it had =
been, the whole course=20

of her life would have been altered. Now, against suspicious appearances, h=
er word was trusted at=20

once; her character was spotless in the eyes of her master make, and I had =
to be as cautious as if=20

I were treading with bare feet on glass, although I knew that Maxine was pr=
aying for me to be out=20

of the house, and I was as far from wishing to linger as she was to have me=
 stay. Only by a=20

miracle did I save myself once or twice from upsetting a chair or a tall va=
se of flowers, on my way=20

to a second door which was locked on the other side. At last, however, I di=
scovered a window, and=20

congratulated myself that my trouble and Maxine's danger was nearly over. T=
he room being on the=20

ground floor, though rather high above the level of the garden, I thought t=
hat I could easily let=20

myself down. But when I had slipped behind the heavy curtains (they were dr=
awn, and felt smooth,=20

like satin) it was only to come upon a new difficulty.  The window, which o=
pened in the middle like=20

most French windows, was tightly closed, with the catch securely fastened; =
and as I began slowly=20

and with infinite caution to turn the handle, I felt that the window was go=
ing to stick. Perhaps the=20

wood had been freshly painted: perhaps it had swelled; in any case I knew t=
hat when the two=20

sashes consented to part they would make a loud protest.  After the first w=
arning squeak I=20

stopped. In the next room Maxine raised her voice--to cover the sound, I wa=
s sure. Then it had=20

been worse even than I fancied! I=20


_
danger had safely been passed, and the heart of the young servant-maid over=
flowed with=20

thanksgiving to God.     XV.  Norah's Story Continued.   _Let him who think=
eth he standeth take=20

heed lest he fall._ Norah was soon to experience how much needed is this wa=
rning from the=20

Scriptures.  A few days before the dishonest Martha left Mrs. Lowndes's ser=
vice, as Norah was=20

returning home after making some little purchases for her and see if I coul=
d hit upon some other=20

way out, which possibly I had missed.  No, there was nothing. No other wind=
ow, except a small=20

one which apparently communicated with a pantry, and even if that had not s=
eemed too small for=20

me to climb through, it was fastened on the pantry side.  What to do I did =
not know. It would be a=20

calamity for Maxine if du Laurier should hear a sound, and insist on having=
 the door opened, after=20
