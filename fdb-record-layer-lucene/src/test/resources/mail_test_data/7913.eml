 is another and a=20

principal cause of the very confined state of the commerce of this valuable=
 colony. A few remarks=20

will be sufficient to justify the apparent paradox.  The merchant of Manila=
 (says Comyn), is=20

"entirely different from the merchant of other parts of the world; he has n=
o extensive=20

correspondence, no books, or intricate accounts; his operations are confine=

only one or two instances=20

books to the=20

Consulado (or Chamber of Commerce)!" This description was doubtless correct=
 at the time when it=20

was written (1809); but it is just to observe that they are now much improv=
ed, and though not=20

excessively enterprising, are better acquainted with the true principles of=
 commerce. Such were=20

the merchants: let us examine a little the trade.  The basis of it was, and=
 is, the funds called=20

"Obras Pias" [105] (Pious Works). These are funds under various denominatio=
ns, whose origin=20

was the piety of well-meaning Spaniards, who dying rich have bequeathed lar=
ge sums for the=20

purpose of lending to deserving traders to commence or continue their caree=
r with. The=20

administration of these is confided to various religious and charitable ins=
titutions, or to civil=20

associations--the trustees forming a board, at which the sums to be lent, &=

=E2=80=9C        1,212   =E2=80=9C  When we remember that our powerful stea=
m engines are operated by pressures=20

varying from one hundred and twenty to two hundred pounds per square inch, =
it is evident we can=20

have no adequate conception of the magnitude of a force of twenty-seven tho=
usand pounds to the=20

square inch. And yet such a power must be but a tithe of the force exerted;=
 for it represents only=20

the force necessary to throw the lava from the surface to the tops of the m=
ountains; whereas the=20

lava reservoirs are far beneath the surface. Also, the above calculation co=
nsiders only the mere=20

weight of the lava; it allows nothing for the resistance of cohesion, frict=
ion, or a heavy crust to be=20

often burst through. When we consider all these, each of which must far sur=
pass the weight of the=20

single column of lava, it is evident that the pressure that can hurl lava b=
locks of two hundred and=20

eighty tons nine miles from a mountain must reach a million pounds per squa=
re inch. These are=20

meaningless figures. Human thought cannot grasp so stupendous a power.  Per=

respondentia at certain rates of interest, which are fixed according to the=
 risk of the voyages; and=20

these, when repaid, shall be added, principal and interest, to the original=
 fund. The interests are 25=20

per cent. to Acapulco, 15 to Bengal, and so in proportion. The total of the=
 capitals of these=20

establishments (there are 12 or 14 of them), amounted to about three millio=
ns and a half of dollars=20

in 1820, of which about two millions are due to the funds on various risks,=
 principally those of New=20

Spain: of this the major part is considered as lost by those best qualified=
 to judge of the subject.=20

The principal employ of these funds has been in the commerce to Acapulco; a=
nd from the facility=20

with which capital was procured, the excessive gambling spirit which this i=
ntroduced, as well as=20

the system of mutual accommodations from the trustees of different funds, a=
nd the utter absence=20

of the wholesome restraint of public examinations of their accounts, it has=
 resulted that more harm=20

than good has been done by these establishments. The original intentions ar=
e entirely perverted, a=20

few small sums being lent to young adventurers (when they have powerful fri=
ends), but far the=20

greatest part is employed by the trustees themselves under the name of a re=
lation or friend. [107]=20

When, without risking any capital of his own, the merchant might thus share=
 the enormous profits=20

of this trade, with no more exertion than signing the invoices and letters =
(they were written by=20

Indian clerks), and receiving the treasure on the return of the vessel, it =
is not surprising that for=20

nearly two centuries they neglected all the other commercial advantages whi=
ch surrounded them,=20

or that such a commerce produced such merchants: the history of it and of t=
hem for that period=20

may be confined to a few words:--they were the agents of the merchants of M=
adras and Bengal,=20

receiving and shipping their goods, and returning their proceeds, while the=
ir profits were confined=20

to a large commission on them. [108]  This trade was anciently confined to =
a single ship annually,=20

the famous Galleon. She was fitted out, manned and armed, at the king's exp=
ense, and=20

commanded by a king's officer. This was reimbursed by a duty of 33 1/3 per =
cent. on the=20

registered cargo, the merchants contributing to her provisionment, and to t=
he payment of 20,000=20

dollars as a bounty to her commander. She was calculated to carry 3,000 bal=
es of a certain size,=20

and the privilege of shipping these was confined to the holders of 1,000 ti=
ckets called "boletas,"=20

which were divided amongst different public bodies, charitable and religiou=
s institutions, the=20

widows of the officers, &c., these tickets being saleable to others: [109] =
and of the enormous profit=20

on this trade, some idea may be formed, when it is known, that with the ver=
y heavy expenses=20

attendant on every stage of it, 500 dollars have been paid for a ticket ent=
itling the holder to ship=20

three bales!  By regulation, the invoice was not to exceed 500,000 dollars;=
 but this was always=20

evaded. The vessels were crammed with goods, and generally netted 100 per c=
ent. or even 150=20

on every thing taken out. [110] By applications from private merchants, the=
 permissions have of=20

late years been extended to their ships, and even brigs; but they still wer=
e encumbered with many=20

useless restrictions and conditions, which of course were evaded by every m=
eans that could be=20

devised.  By the adoption of the new constitution, and the late declaration=
 of the independence of=20

Mexico, [111] which began in the seizure of a convoy of nearly a million of=
 dollars belonging to the=20

merchants of Manila, this trade is now almost annihilated.  As has been rem=
arked, their=20

intercourse with the other countries is very limited. The Phillippine Compa=
ny, who were in=20

possession of the exclusive trade of Europe, have for many years taken no a=
dvantage of their=20

privilege (the last ship which arrived from Spain was in 1817); [112] but p=
rivate merchants were=20

still debarred from doing so, till the promulgation of the constitution. [1=
13] Foreigners have been,=20



however, gradually admitted since 1800; and they have supplied the wants of=
 the country by=20

introducing European articles, and carrying off the surplus produce, when a=
 sufficient quantity=20

could be procured to employ their capital, which rarely happens without muc=
h delay. So rapid has=20

been the augmentation of this trade, that though in 1813 only 15,000 pekuls=
 of sugar were=20

exported, it had increased in 1818 to 200,000, at from 6 1/2 to 9 dollars p=
er pekul. The other=20

exports of the same year were as follows:--  Coffee, about 400 pekuls, at 2=
8 dollars; Cotton, 1,000,=20

at 20 to 25 dollars; Indigo, 1,000 quintals, at 90 to 110 dollars per quint=
al; wax, 600 pekuls at 40 to=20

50 dollars; red wood, &c. &c. in large quantities. In a printed account, th=
e number of foreign=20

vessels for that year (1818) are stated to be, English, 18; American, 10; F=
rench, 4; Portuguese, 2;=20

Chinese Junks, 10, and 8 Spanish vessels. The value of imports as follows: =
                       Goods,=20

 correct, not only from the=20

very imperfect nature of the custom-house valuations, but from the smugglin=
g, which is carried on=20

to an immense amount. It will be nearer the truth to estimate the imports a=
t about 3,8, or=20

3,900,000, and the exports at 3 1/4 or 3,500,000. [114]  The imports consis=
t of piece-goods for the=20

Acapulco market, and for home consumption from Bengal; cambrics and handker=
chiefs of plaided=20

patterns from Madras; woollens, wines, spirits, silks, printed cottons, hos=
iery, hardware, &c. from=20

Europe (principally from France); bird's nests, tortoise and mother-of-pear=
l shell, bich-de-mar [i.e.,=20

balate], wax, dried fish, &c. from Soolo, Borneo, and other islands of the =
Archipelago; toys, silks,=20

nankeens, teas, and dollars from China; dollars from the United States; and=
 from South America,=20

silver, cochineal, and cacao. Of these articles the specie and cochineal ar=
e mostly exported to=20

Bengal and Madras, and the produce of the Soolos and Borneo to China; the o=
ther exports have=20

been noticed in a preceding page.  An active coasting trade [115] is carrie=
d on by the natives=20

amongst the islands, though they suffer dreadfully from the pirates; but su=
ch is their enterprising=20

turn, that with these in sight, they will often cross from one island to an=
other, when they have a fair=20

start; and frequently set out on a long trip in a small prow [i.e., prau], =
armed only with their spears=20

and "campilans," [116] though knowing the pirates to be in the neighbourhoo=
d of their track. They=20

are well known in the piratical states, where a Manila slave always command=
s a higher price than=20

any other. They have been much stigmatized in British country-ships, as the=
 leaders of mutinies,=20

&c.; but though no doubt can exist that they have often assisted in cutting=
 off vessels, yet I=20

question much whether the fault was not in a great measure to be attributed=
 to a want of=20

discrimination between the high spirit of the Philippine islander, and the =
meek sufferance of the=20

patient Lascar--a fatal mistake, when both are trampled on, as it is to be =
feared they but too often=20

are.  This trade is carried on in pontines, [117] great dead crater of Hale=
akala, in East Maui, is=20

thirty miles in circumference. The crater of Kilauea, on the flank of Mauna=
 Loa, is about seven=20

miles in circumference. Several great eruptions have occurred in these isla=
nds during the past fifty=20

years; and in one of these convulsions the volume of lava poured out was at=
 least equal to the=20

great outburst of Skaptar Jokul in Iceland. And when we consider the freque=
nt recurrence of the=20

Hawaiian eruptions, it at once appears that in this region lies the greates=
t lava producer on the=20

globe.  But in regard to destruction of life or property, there has so far =
been no more harmless=20

region in the world. There are two reasons: The lava poured out is very liq=
uid, and cools slowly;=20

hence a cone formed from it has a very gradual slope. The actual grade of M=
auna Loa is but five=20



or six degrees. So a lava stream descends it very slowly; and the light on =
the mountain warns the=20

people of the outbreak. The shore region is the only one inhabited, the int=
erior being covered with=20

dense forests. So the lava may burn a path directly through to the sea, and=
 yet do no great=20

damage to the interests of the people. The greatest damage done to the isla=
nd has not been from=20

an outpour of lava, but from earthquakes and sea-waves. The great eruption =
of 1868 was=20

accompanied by continual shocks--two thousand being felt in a fortnight, an=
d numerous tidal=20

waves being produced; yet the total fatality was but one hundred, and nearl=
y all of these were old=20

or weak persons who were unable to swim well enough to escape from waves th=
at overtook them.=20

A few were overwhelmed by a torrent of soft, red clay that broke from a fis=
sure in the mountain.=20

Cliffs and crags were thrown down by the earthquakes, and the top of one hi=
ll was thrown one=20

thousand feet. The lava stream reached the sea at Nanawale, fifty miles fro=
m its source, and=20

pushed three-fourths of a mile into the sea.  Again, in an eruption in 1880=
, two lava streams=20

poured out toward the town of Hilo; and though the great crater continued i=
n full blast, it was nine=20

months before the people could be sure whether the streams would destroy th=
e town or not. At=20

length the lava was within five minutes walk of the town. Many collected th=
eir chattels and left.=20

Then the action on the mountain suddenly subsided; and in a few days the =
=E2=80=9Cgreat red dragon=E2=80=9D lay=20

stiff and cold, almost at the people=E2=80=99s doors.  Since the natives bu=
ild their houses almost invariably=20

of one story and of the lightest materials, earthquakes can do comparativel=
y little damage to most=20

property. Hence, with all the activity of the great volcanoes, the inhabita=
nts are far more secure=20

than those of many other regions apparently not so dangerous. Persons may r=
eadily visit the great=20

crater in eruption, though at full blast; and excursion parties are organiz=
ed to visit this =E2=80=9CNiagara of=20

fire=E2=80=9D on every occasion of unwonted activity. Nowhere else in the w=
orld can volcanic action on the=20

grandest scale be so carefully observed.  The details given hitherto will s=
erve to illustrate the=20

terrible havoc wrought by subterranean forces. So far only outpouring of vo=
lcanic matter has been=20

especially noticed. But ere examining the terribly destructive force of ear=
thquakes alone, it is meet=20

that the story of the tremendous eruptions of the century be closed with th=
e story of the greatest of=20

the age; and indeed, when all details are considered, it may rank as the mo=
st tremendous=20

convulsion of all history. In certain details, Skaptar may have exceeded it=
: in destruction of life.=20

=C3=86tna surpassed it in 1669; but as a whole, it is simply without a para=
llel.  The reader will rightly=20

judge that such a convulsion could hardly occur elsewhere than in the Malay=
an archipelago.=20

Already the terrible outburst in Sumbawa has been noted; also several other=
s in Java.  Java and=20

Sumatra formerly formed a single island, but were separated by a terrific e=
arthquake in 1115.=20

Shocks are felt in one of the two islands nearly every month. The list of c=
alamities occurring there=20

during the past hundred years is appalling. Besides the convulsions before =
noted, an eruption of=20

Galung-gung, in 1822, overwhelmed one hundred and fourteen villages and des=
troyed four=20

thousand people. In 1843 Mt. Guntur cast forth 30,000,000 tons of ashes, do=
ing immense injury to=20

life and property. In 1867 there was a tremendous earthquake which killed m=
any thousands in the=20

interior of the island, and dried up or greatly obstructed the water course=
s. Immediately afterward=20

the volcano of Gunung-Salak ejected such a quantity of cinders and lava tha=
t the work of=20

obliterating or obstructing the streams was complete. The cess-pools and ma=
rshes bred pestilence=20

and epidemics, which have carried off from Batavia alone nearly a million o=
f inhabitants in the past=20

twenty-two years. In 1872 the volcano of Mirapi burst out and destroyed sev=
eral thousand people=20



in the province of Kadu. Sixteen severe earthquakes were felt in 1878, and =
another one in 1879.=20

At length, in 1883, Krakatoa, a volcano on a small island in the Straits of=
 Sunda, in the very center=20

of the greatest subterranean furnace on the globe, began to manifest some u=
neasiness. As in the=20

case of Cosequina, people had almost forgotten to call it a volcano. And wh=
en the mountain=20

muttered and fired a little in February, they regarded it with some curiosi=
ty, and then, when it=20

quieted down, thought no more about it.  On the 25th of August the people o=
f Batavia heard=20

peculiar subterranean mutterings, as they thought, but the roar increased t=
ill it might have been=20

compared to a battery of fortress artillery. An avalanche of stones and ash=
es began to fall, and=20

continued all night. Krakatoa had begun.  By morning it was impossible for =
Batavians to reach the=20

Straits of Sunda. The bridges were down and the roads impassable. The water=
s of the straits were=20

in fearful turmoil. Explosions beneath the sea followed each other in rapid=
 succession. The waters=20

were sixty degrees hotter than usually. The rebounding waves were dashing u=
pon Madura, five=20

hundred miles away, mountains high.  [Illustration: CATTLE IN VOLCANIC MUD.=
]  The dance of=20

death had hardly begun. Louder and louder roared Krakatoa; ere noon, Maha-M=
eru, the greatest=20

of Javanese volcanoes, had joined in. Then Gunung-guntur opened; others rap=
idly followed, till=20

fifteen volcanoes of Java were in eruption; most of them in full blast. The=
 awful scene was beyond=20

description. Krakatoa could still be heard thundering above all the rest.  =
Before nightfall Gunung-

guntur, the greatest active crater in the world, four miles in diameter, wa=
s spouting enormous=20

streams of lava and sulphurous mud. Tremendous explosions followed with sho=
wers of cinders=20

and stones, as though the old giant were endeavoring to out-do the leader o=
f the dance. Terrible=20

was the slaughter by the flying fragments.  The sea was more violently agit=
ated. Dense clouds of=20

hot, sulphurous vapors, charged with electricity, hung over the waters, and=
 added whirlwinds and=20

thunderstorms to the scene. Fifteen large waterspouts could be seen at one =
time.  On the shore,=20

men, women and children ran wildly about. There was no safety upon sea or l=
and. Houses were=20

crumbling, the atmosphere darkening, the storm increasing. Hundreds of peop=
le were buried=20

beneath ruined houses. Hundreds more were struck down in their flight. Imme=
nse crevices opened=20

and=20


_
prows or boats of all sizes. The pontines are stout-built vessels of Europe=
an models, from 80 to=20

150 tons, with two long mat sails, like a Chinese junk. The "galeras" are s=
maller, and carry a=20

lateen sail, like those of the Mediterranean. The feluccas have been alread=
y described, and their=20

prows and boats resemble nearly those of their Malay brethren. Large proper=
ty is often embarked=20

in these vessels, and they are conducted entirely by natives.  They have bu=
t a few manufactures:=20

the principal one is that of coarse gauzes, and rope from the Abaca plant, =
the first of which has a=20

very extensive consumption and is universally worn by all classes of the na=
tives. It is principally=20

carried on in the province of Camarines, at the S. E. angle of the island. =
 Considerable quantities=20

of coarse canvas and striped cloths are manufactured from cotton in the pro=
vince of Ylocos; and in=20

those in the more immediate vicinity of the capital, the striped cloths cal=
led "tapis" are universally=20

worn by the native women over their petticoat. None of these articles excep=
t the Abaca rope are=20

exported, and probably the whole of the cloths might be imported at a cheap=
er rate than they are=20

made. The Phillippine Company, by a mistaken policy, expended large sums in=
 endeavoring to=20

render these seemed as though Java were to buried, with a rain of fire, in =
the unfathomable=20

depths of the sea.  Towards midnight, it seemed as though the Prince of Dar=
kness might be=20

present in person to direct the work of destruction. =E2=80=9CA luminous cl=
oud far more colossal than that=20

which had appeared above Gunung-guntur, gathered above the chain of the Kan=
dangs, which run=20

along the southeast coast of Java. This cloud increased in size each minute=
, until at last it came to=20

form a sort of a gray and blood-red color, which hung over the earth for a =
