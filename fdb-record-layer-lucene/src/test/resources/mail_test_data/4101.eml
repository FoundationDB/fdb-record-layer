 enter on no common=20

theme. He pressed the hand of the sick man, and, with no other form of taki=
ng leave, quitted the=20

carpenter's cottage. The sailor sighed heavily as he passed from the darken=
ed sick-room into the=20

glowing sunshine without.  "How weakly I have spoken, how little have I sai=
d of what I wished to=20

say!" he murmured to himself. "The words of my Persis are true indeed: it i=
s only the Holy Spirit=20

that can convince of sin. Then I know that my manner is too impetuous. I am=
 always running the=20

chance of offending, rather than persuading; and I don't know how to put in=
to words the thoughts=20

that are swelling within me like a stream that is bursting its bounds. I ca=
nnot restrain myself, when=20

any one would put aside (as if they could be worn out by time) those Old-Te=
stament Scriptures=20

which our Lord himself bade us search, as testifying of him; when any look =
upon the faith of=20

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as quite a distinct thing from that required of =
us; when, like poor=20

Stone, they seem to conclude that justice and holiness are confined to the =
Old Testament, mercy=20

and love to the New! Ah! the truth is"--Franks quickened his steps, as if t=
o keep pace with the=20

current of his thoughts--"the truth is, that Satan knows that he has a terr=
ible advantage over us, if=20

he can but persuade us to try any way but God's way to reach the kingdom of=
 heaven. Satan is=20

willing that we should look on the Lord as a great example, or a great teac=
her, or even as a great=20

king, if he can only keep us from acknowledging Christ as also a great sacr=
ifice for sins, for _our_=20

sins; and so prevent us from throwing ourselves entirely upon his mercy and=
 merits. To draw us=20

back from the ark, that is Satan's chief aim; to make us believe that we do=
 not require a Saviour.=20

As if the Son of God would have died, had there been any less costly means =
of purchasing=20

heaven for his people; as if we did not see most clearly, in his sufferings=
 on the cross, the=20

_holiness_ of God that abhors sin, the _justice_ of God in punishing it, jo=
ined with the boundless=20

_mercy_ and _love_, which made God not spare even his Son, but give him fre=
ely for our=20

salvation!"  [C] Isaiah ix. 6.  [D] Micah v. 2.  [E] Zechariah xiii. 7.  [F=
] Isaiah liii. 5, 6.  [G] Hebrews=20

ll, Bell, my dear," said the=20

carpenter, as his wife returned from afternoon service, "tell me what you'v=
e heard to-day, and I'll=20

tell you what I've heard."  "Mr. Leyton preached as usual," replied Mrs. St=
one, as she unloosed the=20

red strings of her bonnet. "I think he's getting less shy, and more earnest=
. His text was, '_If we say=20

that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us._'"  =
"Why, that would ha' done=20

for the text of the sermon I've had all to myself," said Ben Stone.  "Sermo=
n,--what do you mean?"=20

asked his wife, pausing in the act of taking off her shawl.  "There's Ned F=
ranks been here, and--

talk of earnestness--he's earnest with a vengeance! There was nothing would=
 content him but that=20

I should own myself to be a downright, miserable sinner; and he threw out s=
omething more than a=20

hint, that I'm like to come to the same end as those who wouldn't go into t=
he ark, and so were=20

drowned in the flood."  "I wish that Ned Franks would mind his own business=
," exclaimed Mrs.=20

Stone, indignantly. "I'm sure that he, and every one knows that there's not=
 a better man in the=20

parish than you are; it would be well if, with all his fine talking, Mr. Fr=
anks lovely, fresh flowers=20

seemed a mockery, Aunt Lil began asking questions.  For some reason, Uncle =
Eric apparently did=20

not like answering. It was almost as if he had had some kind of previous kn=
owledge of the affair, of=20

which he didn't wish to speak. But, I suppose, it could not have been that.=
  It was Lord Robert who=20

told us nearly everything; and always I was conscious that he was watching =
me, wondering if this=20

were a cruel blow for me, asking himself if he were speaking in a tactful w=
ay of one who had been=20



his rival.  "There was that engagement of Dundas' last night, which he was =
just going to keep=20

when we saw him," said Lord Bob, carefully, but clumsily. "I'm afraid there=
 must have been=20

something fishy about that--I mean, some trap must have been laid to catch =
him. And, it seems, he=20

wasn't supposed to be in Paris--though I don't see what that can have to do=
 with the plot, if there is=20

one. He was stopping in the hotel under another name. No doubt he had some =
good reason,=20

though. There's nothing sly about Dundas. If ever there was a plucky chap, =
he's one. Anyhow,=20

apparently, he wanted to get hold of a man in Paris he couldn't find, for h=
e called last evening on a=20

detective named Girard, a rather well-known fellow in his line, I believe. =
It almost looks as if=20

Dundas had made an enemy of him, for he's been giving evidence pretty freel=
y to the police--lost=20

no time about it, anyhow. Girard says he was following up the scent, tracki=
ng down the person=20

he'd been hired by Dundas to hunt for, and had at last come to the house wh=
ere he was lodging,=20

when there he found Dundas himself, ransacking the room, covered with blood=
, and the chap who=20

was wanted, lying dead on the floor, his body hardly cold."  "What time was=
 all that?" enquired=20

Lisa sharply. It was the first question she had asked.  "Between midnight a=
nd one o'clock, I think=20

the papers said," answered Lord Bob.  "Well, of course it's all nonsense," =
exclaimed Aunt Lil=20

impatiently. "French people are so sensational, and they jump at conclusion=
s so. The idea of their=20

daring to accuse a man like Ivor Dundas of murder! They ought to know bette=
r. They'll soon be=20

eating humble-pie, and begging England's pardon for wrongful treatment of a=
 British subject, won't=20

they, Eric?"  "I'm afraid there's no question of jumping at conclusions on =
the part of the authorities,=20

or of eating humble-pie," Uncle Eric said. "The evidence--entirely circumst=
antial so far, luckily--is=20

dead against Ivor. And as for his being a British subject, there's nothing =
in that. If an Englishman=20

chooses to commit a murder in France, he's left to the French law to deal w=
ith, as if he were a=20

Frenchman."  "But Ivor hasn't committed murder!" cried Aunt Lilian, horrifi=
ed.  "Of course not. But=20

he's got to prove that he hasn't. And in that he's worse off than if this t=
hing happened in England.=20

English law supposes a man innocent until he's been proved guilty. French l=
aw, on the contrary,=20

presumes that he's guilty until he's proved innocent. In face of the eviden=
ce against Ivor, the=20

authorities couldn't have done otherwise than they have done."  For the fir=
st time in my life I felt=20

angry with Aunt Lilian's husband. I do hate that cold, stern "sense of just=
ice" on which men pride=20

themselves so much, whether it's an affair of a friend or an enemy!  "Surel=
y Mr. Dundas must have=20

been able to prove an--an--don't you call it an alibi?" asked Lisa.  "He di=
dn't try to," replied Lord=20

Bob. "He's simply refused, up to the present, to tell what he was doing bet=
ween twelve o'clock and=20

the time he was found, except to say that he=20


_
"Softly, softly, my dear," said Ben Stone, amused and pleased at her warm d=
efence. "Ned Franks=20

is a capital fellow; a brave, noble-hearted man."  "Let him be what he like=
s," exclaimed Mrs. Stone,=20

angrily pulling off her boots. "If he comes here a worritting and lecturing=
 you, I shall shut the door=20

upon him!"  "His visit was certainly very unlike that which the young curat=
e paid me. Mr. Leyton,=20

with his gentle way and soft voice, spoke of my trials and my hope; and sai=
d that a true Christian is=20

not afraid even of death. Then says I, 'Sir, I'm never afraid of death;' so=
, of course, he takes it for=20

granted that I'm a true Christian, and all right, and goes away quite pleas=
ed and happy. But as for=20

Ned Franks,"--Ben Stone gave his little chuckling laugh, though it sounded =
less merry than usual,-

-"he'll take nothing for granted, except that I _must_ be a sinner. He lean=
s forward and looks right=20

into your eyes, as if he meant to read you through and through, and let you=
 see right into his soul=20

also. I can just fancy," continued the sick carpenter, laughing again, "wha=
t sort of a sailor he was=20

when he served the to the house where Girard afterwards found him. Of cours=
e he denies killing=20

the man: says the fellow had stolen something from him, on the boat crossin=
g from Dover to=20

Calais yesterday, and that after applying to the detective, he got a note f=
rom the thief, offering to=20

give the thing back if he would call and name a reward. Says he found the r=
oom already=20

ransacked and the fellow dead, when he arrived at the address given him; th=
at he was searching=20

for his property when Girard appeared on the scene."  "Couldn't he have sho=
wn the note sent by=20

the thief?" asked Aunt Lil.  "He did show a note. But it does him more harm=
 than good. And he=20

wouldn't tell what the thing was the thief had taken from him, except that =
it was valuable. It does=20

look as if he were determined to make the case as black as possible against=
 himself; but then, as I=20

said before, no doubt he has good reasons."  "He has no good luck, anyhow!"=
 sighed Aunt Lil, who=20

always liked Ivor.  "Rather not--so far. Why, one of the worst bits of evid=
ence against him is that=20

the concierge of this house in the Rue de la Fille Sauvage swears that thou=
gh Dundas=20


_
by his colors, and go slap-bang at an enemy!"  "But you're no enemy," cried=
 Mrs. Stone, "neither=20

his nor any one else's, and I'll not let him go slap-bang at you! Let him p=
reach away as much as he=20

likes to that wretched Nancy Sands whom he pulled out of the mill-stream!" =
 "There's not much=20

chance of _her_ deceiving herself, and saying that she has no sin," observe=
d Stone.  "It was small=20

kindness to her husband to save her," continued the carpenter's wife; "Sand=
s has little cause to=20

thank Ned. The poor clerk is growing thinner every day, and looked at churc=
h this afternoon as if=20

he was going to be hanged. He knows that when Nancy comes out of hospital s=
he'll be at her old=20

tricks again, drinking him out of house and home; far better for _him_ if a=
ll had been over at once!=20

I couldn't help giving her a bit o' my mind about that, when I went to see =
her yesterday!"  "You did!"=20

exclaimed Stone, in amused surprise; "how did she take it? If Nancy returne=
d you a bit o' _her_=20

mind," he continued, with a laugh, "I guess you'd the worst of the exchange=
. You never were a=20

match for Nancy, my dear."  "She said nothing, but looked as if she could h=
ave eaten me," replied=20

Mrs. Stone.  "Her accident must have pulled her down a bit, if she'd not so=
mething sharper than a=20

look to fling at you," observed Ben. "You and she used to go at it like pok=
er and tongs, but Nancy=20

could hit hardest and longest; she'd a tongue like a mill-wheel if once you=
 set it a-going. But put=20

the kettle on the fire, my dear, and lets have a drop of good tea. In the e=
vening I'll do what I've=20

been intending to do for these many years past,--look over that box of old =
things belonging to my=20

poor mother, whom I lost when I was a little chap but nine years of age. I =
want to sort 'em,--put by=20

what I mean to keep, and burn what's of use to no one. Ned Franks himself w=
ould say it was right=20

for a sick man to put his house in order."  The task of looking over the co=
ntents of that old box,=20

which had been stowed away in a cupboard for a great length of time, was on=
e which the=20

carpenter had put off from day to day, and year to year, perhaps because--t=
ill illness came--he had=20

led a busy, active life, or more probably because his cheerful, easy nature=
 disliked any occupation=20

that might awaken melancholy thoughts. And who but is saddened by turning o=
ver memorials of=20

one loved and lost, even though, as in the case of Stone, forty or fifty ye=
ars may have elapsed=20

since the friend departed. This Sunday evening, as twilight came on, Ben St=
one fulfilled the long-

deferred task. His wife brought the old box,--a deal one covered with faded=
 paper,--and placed it=20

on a chair close to his bed, that he might examine its contents with ease. =
She lighted a candle and=20

put it on the table beside her husband, and then sat down with some little =
curiosity to see her=20

mother-in-law's hoarded treasures, but a secret conviction that the box wou=
ld hold nothing but=20

"old-fashioned rubbish."  The late Mrs. Stone had not been an orderly woman=
, or perhaps death=20

had taken her by surprise, so that she had left her things in confusion,--s=
uch was the silent=20

reflection of her son's wife, as Ben went slowly over the contents of the b=
ox. They were a strange=20

medley. There were two gilt lockets, a nutmeg-grater, an old tooth-brush an=
d silver thimble, a=20

collar, an hour when the detective arrived, he was there then _for the seco=
nd time_, that he=20

admitted it when he came. The first visit he made, according to the concier=
ge, was about an hour=20

before the second: the concierge was already in bed in his little box, but =
not asleep, when a man=20

rang and an English-sounding voice asked for Monsieur Gestre. On hearing th=
at Gestre was=20

away, the visitor said he would see the gentleman who was stopping in Gestr=
e's room. By and by=20

the Englishman went out, and on being challenged, said he might come back a=
gain later. After a=20

while the concierge was waked up once more by a caller for Gestre, who anno=
unced that he'd=20

been before; and now he vows that it was the same man both times, though Du=
ndas denies=20



having called twice. If he could prove that he'd been in the house no more =
than half an hour, it=20

might be all right, for two doctors agree that the murdered man had been de=
ad more than an hour=20

when they were called in. But he can't or won't prove it--that's his luck a=
gain!--and nobody can be=20

found who saw him in any of the streets through which he mentions passing. =
The last moment that=20

he can be accounted for is when a cabman, who'd taken him up at the hotel j=
ust after he left us,=20

set him down in the Rue de Courbvoie, not so very far from the Elysee Palac=
e. Then it was only=20

between five and ten minutes past twelve, so he could easily have gone on t=
o the Rue de la Fille=20

Sauvage afterwards and killed his man at the time when the doctors say the =
fellow must have=20

died. It's a bad scrape. But of course Dundas will get out of it somehow or=
 other, in the end."  "Do=20

_you_ think he will, Eric?" asked Aunt Lil.  "I hope so with all my heart,"=
 he answered. But his face=20

showed that he was deeply troubled, and my heart sank down--down.  As I rea=
lised more and=20

more the danger in which Ivor stood, my resentment against him began to see=
m curiously trivial.=20

Nothing had happened to make me feel that I had done him an injustice in th=
inking he cared more=20

for Maxine de Renzie than for me--indeed, on the contrary, everything went =
to prove his supreme=20

loyalty to her whose name he had refused to speak, even for the sake of cle=
aring himself. Still,=20

now that the world was against him, my soul rushed to stand by his side, to=
 defend him, to give=20

him love and trust in spite of all.  Down deep in my heart I forgave him, e=
ven though he had been=20

cruel, and I yearned over him with an exceeding tenderness. More than anyth=
ing on earth, I=20

wanted to help him; and I meant to try. Indeed, as the talk went on while t=
hat terrible meal=20

progressed, I thought I saw a way to do it, if Lisa and I should act togeth=
er.  I was so anxious to=20

have a talk with her that I could hardly wait to get back to our own hotel,=
 from the Ritz. Fortunately,=20

nobody wanted to sit long at lunch, so it wasn't yet three when I called he=
r into my room. The men=20

had gone to make different arrangements about starting, for we were not to =
leave Paris until they=20

had had time to do something for Ivor. Uncle Eric went to see the British A=
mbassador, and Aunt=20

Lilian had said that she would be busy for at least an hour, writing letter=
s and telegrams to cancel=20

engagements we had had in London. For awhile Lisa and I were almost sure no=
t to be interrupted;=20

but I spoke out abruptly what was in my mind, not wishing to lose a=20


_
several skeins of silk and cotton of various colors in a tangled mass toget=
her, fragments of gimp=20

and tape, a red leather pocket-book much the worse for wear, a prayer-book =
without a cover, and=20

a padlock without a key. There were also heaps of papers, recipes for cures=
, and recipes for=20

dishes, old patterns, old letters, old bills, a jumble of all sorts of thin=
gs which it was scarcely matter=20

of wonder that no one had cared to reduce into order.  "You may use all the=
se receipted bills to=20

light the fire with, my dear," said Ben Stone; "they at least can be useful=
 to nobody. But I'll keep=20

this old bit of an Almanac,--1815! Well, well; how time passes! It seems st=
range to look back to the=20

days when this  "I think the only thing for us to do," I said, "is to tell =
what we know, and save Ivor in=20

spite of himself."  "How can anything you know save him?" she asked, with a=
 queer, faint=20

emphasis which I didn't understand.  "Don't you see," I cried, "that if we =
come forward and say we=20

saw him in the Rue d'Hollande at a quarter past twelve--going into a house =
there--he couldn't have=20

murdered the man in that other house, far away. It all hangs on the time." =
 "But you didn't see him=20

go in," Lisa contradicted me.  I stared at her. "_You_ did. Isn't it the sa=
me thing?"  "No, not unless I=20

choose to say so."  "And--but you will choose. You want to save him, of cou=
rse."  "Why?"=20

"Because he's innocent. Because he's=20
