philodendron monstera that nothing serious would come of it. On the other hand, Paul Friche might be right about these aristos; there might be forty or fifty francs to be made out of them, and in any case they had one or two things upon their CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.  A NEW DISASTER.  "I mean to go off to-morrow on a shooting trip to the lake," said Dan Davidson to Archie Sinclair.  "I've had a long spell at farming operations of late, and am tired of it.

The double _
thought had come to her and to her father in this rough guise. In another moment mayhap he 

would have forced her to follow him, to leave milor in the lurch, to jeopardise for ever every chance 

of safety.  "It is all for the best, father dear," she managed to cry out over her shoulder, for she had 

just caught sight of him being seized round the shoulders by Lemoine and heard him protesting 

loudly:  "I'll not go! I'll not go! Let me go!" he shouted hoarsely. "My daughter! Yvonne! Let me go!

about the other's protests. He hated all this row inside his house, but there had been rows in it 

before and he was  "Impossible," answered the seaman, promptly.  "Couldn't wait."  "But we might 

compromise the matter.  I might have mine a little sooner and you could have yours a little later."

we might consider it.  Hold a sort o' drum-head court-martial over it, with Elise and Elspie as 

judges."  When the said court-marital--as Dan called it--was held, the compromise was agreed to, 

and it was finally fixed that six weeks thereafter the two couples should be united in Ben Nevis 

Hall.  But the current of these parallel streams of true love was not yet destined to run smooth--as 

the next chapter will show.
