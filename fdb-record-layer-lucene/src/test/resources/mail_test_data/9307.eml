ROY ROCKWOOD  Author of the "Speedwell Boys Series" and the "Great Marvel Series."  12mo. 

Illustrated. Price per volume, 65 cents, postpaid.  Never was there a more clever young aviator 

than Dave Dashaway. All up-to-date lads will surely wish to read about him.   DAVE DASHAWAY 

THE YOUNG AVIATOR you it's to help her as well: therefore I owe you the whole truth, or you will 

be handicapped. For several years Mademoiselle de Renzie has done good service--secret 

service, you must understand--for Great Britain."  "By Jove! Maxine a political spy!" Ivor broke out 

impulsively.  "That's rather a hard name, isn't it? There are better ones. And she's no traitor to her 

country, because, as you perhaps know, she's Polish by birth. I can assure you we've much for 

which to thank her cleverness and tact--and beauty. For our sakes I'm sorry that she's serving our 

interests professionally for the last time. For her own sake, I ought to rejoice, as she's engaged to 

be married. And if you can save her from coming to grief over this very ticklish business, she'll 

probably live happily ever after. Did you know of her engagement?"  "No," replied Ivor. "I saw Miss 

de Renzie often when she was acting in London a year ago; but after she went to Paris--of course, 

she's very busy and has crowds of friends; and I've only crossed once or twice since, on hurried 

visits; so we haven't met, or written to each other."  ("Very good reason," I thought bitterly, behind 

my sofa. "You've been busy, too--falling in love with Diana Forrest.")  "It hasn't been announced 

yet, but I thought as an old friend you might have been told. I believe Mademoiselle wants to 

surprise everybody when the right time comes--if the poor girl isn't ruined irretrievably in this affair 

of ours."  "Is there really serious danger of that?" "The most serious. If you can't save her, not only 

will the _Entente Cordiale_ be shaken to its foundations (and I say nothing of my own reputation, 

which is at stake), but her future happiness will be broken in the crash, and--she says--she will not 

live to suffer the agony of her loss. She will kill herself if disaster comes; and though suicide is 

usually the last resource of a coward, Mademoiselle de Renzie is no coward, and I'm inclined to 

think I should come to the same resolve in her place."  "Tell me what I am to do," said Ivor, 

evidently moved by the Foreign Secretary's strange words, and his intense earnestness.  "You will 

go to Paris by the first train to-morrow morning, without mentioning your intention to anyone; you 

will drive at once to some hotel where you have never stayed and are not known. I will find means 

of informing the lady what hotel you choose. You will there give a fictitious name (let us say, 



George Sandford) and you will take a suite, with a private sitting-room. That done, you will say that 

you are expecting a lady to call upon you, and will see no one else. You will wait till Mademoiselle 

de Renzie appears, which will certainly be as soon as she can possibly manage; and when you 

and she are alone together, sure that you're not being spied upon, you will put into her hands a 

small packet which I shall give you before we part to-night."  "It sounds simple enough," said Ivor, 

"if that's all."  "It is all. Yet it may be anything but simple."  "Would you prefer to have me call at her 

house, and save her coming to a hotel? I'd willingly do so if--"  "No. As I told you, should it be 

known that you and she meet, those who are watching her at present ought not to suspect the real 

motive of the meeting. So much the better for us: but we must think of her. After four o'clock every 

afternoon, the young Frenchman she's engaged to is in the habit of going to her house, and 

stopping until it's time for her to go to work. He dines with her, but doesn't drive with her to the 

theatre, as that would be rather too public for the present, until their engagement's announced. He 

adores her, but is inconveniently jealous, like most Latins. It's practically certain that he's heard 

your name mentioned in connection with hers, when she was in London, and as a Frenchman 

invariably fails to understand that a man can admire a beautiful woman without being in love with 

her, your call at her house might give Mademoiselle Maxine a _mauvais quart d'heure_."  "I see. 

But if she sends him away, and comes to my hotel--"  "She'll probably make some excuse about 

being obliged to go to the theatre early, and thus get rid of him. She's quite clever enough to 

manage that. Then, as your own name won't appear on any hotel list in the papers next day, the 

most jealous heart need have no cause for suspicion. At the same time, if certain persons whom 

Mademoiselle--and we, too--have to fear, do find out that she has visited Ivor Dundas, who has 

assumed a false name for the pleasure of a private interview with her, interests of even deeper 

importance than the most desperate love affair may still, we'll hope, be guarded by the pretext of 

your old friendship. Now, you understand thoroughly?"  "I think so," replied Ivor, very grave and 

troubled, I knew by the change in his manner, out of which all the gaiety had been slowly drained. 

"I will do my very best."  "If you are sacrificing any important engagements of your own for the next 

two days, you won't suffer for it in the end," remarked the Foreign Secretary meaningly.  No doubt 

Ivor saw the consulship at Algiers dancing before his eyes, bound up with an engagement to Di, 

just as a slice of rich plum cake and white bride cake are tied together with bows of satin ribbons 

sometimes, in America. I didn't want him to have the consulship, because getting that would 

perhaps mean getting Di, too.  "Thank you," said Ivor.  "And what hotel shall you choose in Paris?" 

asked the Foreign Secretary. "It should be a good one, I don't need to remind you, where 

Mademoiselle de Renzie could go without danger of compromising herself, in case she should be 

recognised in spite of the veil she's pretty certain to wear. Yet it shouldn't be in too central a 

situation."  "Shall it be the Elysee Palace?" asked Ivor.  "That will do very well," replied the other, 

after reflecting for an instant. And I could have clapped my hands, in what Ivor would call my 

"impish joy," when it was settled; for the Elysee Palace is where Lord and Lady Mountstuart stop 

when they visit Paris, and they'd been talking of running over next day with Lord Robert West, to 

look at a wonderful new motor car for sale there--one that a Rajah had ordered to be made for 

him, but died before it was finished. Lady Mountstuart always has one new fad every six months at 

least, and her latest is to drive a motor car herself. Lord Robert is a great expert--can make a 

motor, I believe, or take it to pieces and put it together again; and he'd been insisting for days that 



she would be able to drive this Rajah car. She'd promised, that if not too tired she'd cross to Paris 

the day after the ball, taking the afternoon train, via Boulogne, as she wouldn't be equal to an early 

start. Now, I thought, how splendid it would be if she should see Maxine at the hotel with Ivor!  The 

Foreign Secretary was advising Ivor to wire the Elysee Palace for rooms without any delay, as 

there must be no hitch about his meeting Maxine, once it was arranged for her to go there. "Any 

misunderstanding would be fatal," he went on, as solemnly as if the safety of Maxine's head 

depended upon Ivor's trip. "I only wish I could have got you off to-night; and in that case you might 

have gone to her own house, early in the morning. She is in a frightful state of mind, poor girl. But 

it was only to-day that the contents of the packet reached me, and was shown to the Prime 

Minister. Then, it was just before I hurried round here to see you that I received a cypher telegram 

from her, warning me that Count Godensky--of whom you've probably heard--an attache of the 

Russian embassy in Paris, somehow has come to suspect a--er--a game in high politics which she 

and I have been playing; her last, according to present intentions, as I told you. I have an idea that 

this man, who's well known in Paris society, proposed to Mademoiselle de Renzie, refused to take 

no for an answer, and bored her until she perhaps was goaded into giving him a severe snub. 

Godensky is a vain man, and wouldn't forgive a snub, especially if it had got talked about. He'd be 

a bad enemy: and Mademoiselle seems to think that he is a very bitter and determined enemy. 

Apparently she doesn't know how much he has found out, or whether he has actually found out 

anything at all, or merely guesses, and 'bluffs.' But one thing is unfortunately certain, I believe. 

Every boat and every train between London and Paris will be watched more closely than usual for 

the next day or two. Any known or suspected agent wouldn't get through unchallenged. But I can 

see no reason why you should not."  "Nor I," answered Ivor, laughing a little. "I think I could make 

some trouble for anyone who tried to stop me."  "Caution above all! Remember you're in training 

for a diplomatic career, what? If you should lose the packet I'm going to give you, I prophesy that 

in twenty-four hours the world would be empty of Maxine de Renzie: for the circumstances 

surrounding her in this transaction are peculiar, the most peculiar I've ever been entangled in, 

perhaps, in rather a varied experience; and they intimately concern her fiance, the Vicomte Raoul 

du Laurier--"  "Raoul du Laurier!" exclaimed Ivor. "So she's engaged to marry him!"  "Yes. Do you 

know him?"  "I have friends who do. He's in the French Foreign Office, though they say he's more 

at home in the hunting field, or writing plays--"  "Which don't get produced. Quite so. But they will 

get produced some day, for I believe he's an extremely clever fellow in his way--in everything 

except the diplomatic 'trade' which his father would have him take up, and got him into, through 

Heaven knows what influence. No; Du Laurier's no fool, and is said to be a fine sportsman, as well 

as almost absurdly good-looking. Mademoiselle Maxine has plenty of excuse for her infatuation--

for I assure you it's nothing less. She'd jump into the fire for this young man, and grill with a Joan 

of Arc smile on her face."  This would have been pleasant hearing for Ivor, if he'd ever been really 

in love with Maxine; but I was obliged to admit to myself that he hadn't, for he didn't seem to care 

in the least. On the contrary, he grew a little more cheerful.  "I can see that du Laurier's being in 

the French Foreign Office might make it rather awkward for Miss de Renzie if she--if she's been 

rather too helpful to us," he said.  "Exactly. And thereby hangs a tale--a sensational and even 

romantic tale almost complicated enough for the plot of a novel. When you meet Mademoiselle to-

morrow afternoon or evening, if she cares to take you into her confidence, in reward for your 



services, in regard to some private interests of her own which have got themselves wildly mixed 

up with the gravest political matters, she's at liberty to do so as far as I'm concerned, for you are to 

be trusted, and deserve to be trusted. You may say that to her from me, if the occasion arises. I 

hope with all my heart that everything may go smoothly. If not--the _Entente Cordiale_ may burst 

like a bomb. I--who have made myself responsible in the matter, with the clear understanding that 

England will deny me if the scheme's a failure--shall be shattered by a flying fragment. The 

favourite actress of Paris will be asphyxiated by the poisonous fumes; and you, though I hope no 

worse harm may come to you, will mourn for the misfortunes of others. Your responsibility will be 

such that it will be almost as if you carried the destructive bomb itself, until you get the packet into 

the hands of Maxine de Renzie." "Good heavens, I shall be glad when she has it!" said Ivor.  "You 

can't be gladder than she--or I. And here it is," replied the Foreign Secretary. "I consider it great 

luck to have found such a messenger, at a house I could enter without being suspected of any 

motive more subtle than a wish to eat a good supper, or to meet some of the prettiest women in 

London."  I would have given a great deal to see what he was giving Ivor to take to Maxine, and I 

was half tempted to lift myself up and peep at the two from behind the lounge, but I could tell from 

their voices that they were standing quite near, and it would have been too dangerous. The 

Foreign Secretary, who is rather a nervous man, and fastidious about a woman's looks, never 

could bear me: and I believe he would have thought it almost as justifiable as drowning an ugly 

kitten, to choke me if he knew I'd overheard his secrets.  However, Ivor's next words gave me 

some inkling of what I wished to know. "It's importance evidently doesn't consist in bulk," he said 

lightly. "I can easily carry the case in my breast pocket."  "Pray put it there at once, and guard it as 

you would guard the life and honour of a woman," said the Foreign Secretary solemnly. "Now, I, 

must go and look for my wife. It's better that you and I shouldn't be seen together. One never 

knows who may have got in among the guests at a crush like this. I will go out at one door, and 

when you've waited for a few minutes, you can go, by way of another."  A moment later there was 

silence in the room, and I knew that Ivor was alone. What

stake. Not only would I hate to have him scorn me for an eavesdropper, but I had already built up 

a great plan for the use I could make of what I had overheard.     CHAPTER III   LISA MAKES 

MISCHIEF  When Ivor was safely out of the room, my first thought was to escape from behind the 

lounge, and get upstairs to my own quarters. But just as I had sat up, very cramped and wretched, 

with one foot and one arm asleep, Lord Mountstuart came in again, and down I had to duck.  He 

had brought a friend, who was as mad about old books and first editions, as he; a stuffy, elderly 

thing, who had never seen Lord Mountstuart's treasures before. As both were perfectly daft on the 

subject, they must have kept me lying there an hour, while they fussed about from one glass-

protected book-case to another, murmuring admiration of Caxtons, or discussing the value of a 

Mazarin Bible, with their noses in a lot of old volumes which ought to have been eaten up by 

moths long ago. As for me, I should have been delighted to set fire to the whole lot.  At last Lord 

Mountstuart (whom I've nicknamed "Stewey") remembered that there was a ball going on, and that 

he was the host. So he and the other duffer pottered away, leaving the coast clear and the door 

wide open. It was just my luck (which is always bad and always has been) that a pair of flirting 

idiots, for whom the conservatory, or our "den," or the stairs, wasn't secluded enough, must needs 

be prying about and spy that open door before I had conquered my cramps and got up from 

behind the sofa.  The dim light commended itself to their silliness, and after hesitating a minute, 



the girl--whoever she was--allowed herself to be drawn into a room where she had no business to 

be. Then, to make bad worse, they selected the lounge to sit upon, and I had to lie closely wedged 

against the wall, with "pins and needles" pricking all over my cramped body, while some man I 

didn't know proposed and was accepted by some girl I shall probably never see.  They continued 

to sit, making a tremendous fuss about each other, until voices were "heard off," as they say in the 

directions for theatricals, whereupon they

summons."  By that time I was more dead than alive, but I did manage to crawl out of my prison, 

and creep up to my room by a back stairway which the servants use. But it was very late now, and 

people were going, even the young ones who love dancing. As soon as I was able, I scuttled out 

of my ball dress and into a dressing gown. Also I undid my hair, which is my one beauty, and let it 

hang over my shoulders, streaming down in front on each side, so that nobody would know one 

shoulder is higher than the other. It wasn't that I was particularly anxious to appear well before Di 

(though I have enough vanity not to like the contrast between us to seem too great, even when 

she and I are alone), but because I wanted her to think, when she came to my room, that I'd been 

there a long time.  I was sure she would come and peep in at the door, to steal away if she found 

me asleep, or to enquire how I felt if I were awake.  By and by the handle of the door moved softly, 

just as I had expected, and seeing a light, Di came in. It was late, and she had danced all night, 

but instead of looking tired she was radiant. When she spoke, her voice was as gay and happy as 

Ivor's had been when he first came into Lord Mountstuart's study with the Foreign Secretary.  I 

said that I was much better, and had had a nice rest; that if I hadn't wanted to hear how everything 

had gone at the ball, I should have been in bed and asleep long ago.  "Everything went very well," 

said she. "I think it was a great success."  "Did you dance every dance?" I asked, working up 

slowly to what I meant to say.  "Except a few that I sat out."  "I can guess who sat them out with 

you," said I. "Ivor Dundas. And one was number thirteen, wasn't it?"  "How did you know?"  "He 



told me he was going to have thirteen with you. Oh, you needn't try to hide anything from me. He 

tells most things to his 'Imp.' Was he nice when he proposed?"  "He didn't propose."  "I'll give you 

the sapphire bracelet Lady Mountstuart gave me, if he didn't tell you he loved you, and ask if 

there'd be a chance for him in case he got Algiers."  "I wouldn't take your bracelet even if--if--. But 

you're a little witch, Lisa."  "Of course I am!" I exclaimed, smiling, though I had
