aned back with a little gasp. But Nourse added relentlessly, "And Joe didn'=

with indignant eyes, as though he alone were to blame.  "You mean to regist=

 time when he was not domiciled in the United Kingdom, or in the course of =

small heed to the details. But this had in it what she had craved ever sinc=
e she had come to the=20

city--beauty and creative work--and this had been in Joe's "business"!  "Th=
ere was only one point=20

against it," she heard Nourse saying presently. "Those insufficient, the pr=

ey loser. . . . And Joe met=20

your sister then." The voice had changed, and its hostile tone brought Ethe=
l back with a sharp=20

turn. The man, as though uneasy at the revelations he had made, was looking=
 at her as at first,=20

with suspicion and dislike. "I won't go into details of how she got her hol=
d on Joe. You know how=20

that's done, I suppose. I'm speaking of the effect on his work. He soon put=
 off that plan of his--and=20

any others of the kind. For now he had to have money. And he has been putti=
ng it off ever since--

not dropping it, he'll tell you, only putting it off till he's rich. But if=
 he isn't rich enough soon, it'll be=20

too late. For that part of him is nearly dead.  "But to go back to your sis=
ter. It was not only his=20

money, it was his time she needed. First it was a wedding trip, and after t=
hat late hours--a short=20

day in his office. And he wasn't half the man he had been. He was thinking =
of the night before, and=20

then of the night that was coming. She came for him at five o'clock." He sa=
w Ethel start, and he=20

added, "Just as you did later on.  "And when he did wake up to work, it was=
 different--it was for=20

money alone. He began to throw over his ideals, and very soon there was onl=
y me to hold him=20

back. You see, he had had so many friends before he met your sister, men an=
d even women, too,=20

who had been a spur to him. But when he brought his wife around, they would=
n't have her, turned=20

her down--and that made her bitter against them all and she kept Joe from t=
hem. All but me. I=20

stayed in the office, and now and then I got some of his friends and we wou=
ld take him out to=20

lunch. But then even that stopped. Joe hadn't time. He was too busy getting=
 the cash.  "He had=20

dropped all pretence of any work that was really worth while, and had turne=
d his art into a=20

business. He became a real estate gambler and an architect, all in one. He =
