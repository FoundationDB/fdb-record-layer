philodendron monstera they obtained those articles, as they said that the H=

replied, that about two days' sail in their canoes to leeward, there was a =
large group of islands, known generally by the name of Manicolo, to which t=
hey were in the habit of making frequent voyages, and that they had procure=

ands, known generally by the name of Manicolo, to which they were in the ha=

 summoned them to this secluded rendezvous from many a distant state and ci=
ty. Unruffled, but with an inspiring fire in his pleased keen eye, that gen=
eral answered their devoted salute, whom hitherto we have known by his trav=
elling name of Captain Bruges.  It was _
ascertained, a result that is owing to the active and spirited exertions of=
 our gallant and=20

enterprising countryman Captain Dillon.  It is a remarkable circumstance, t=
hat the discovery of the=20

relics of La Perouse, arose out of the massacre of the ship Hunter's crew, =
at the Feejee Islands, in=20

1813.  In this unfortunate affair, fourteen persons in all, from the ship H=
unter, lost their lives. The=20

two that escaped with Mr. Dillon, were William Wilson and Martin Buchart, a=
 Prussian, who resided=20

for two years at Bough. The latter entreated captain Robson to give him and=
 his Bough wife a=20

passage to the first land at which he might arrive, as they would certainly=
 be sacrificed if they=20

returned to the island. Having made Tucopia on the 20th of September, Bucha=
rt, his wife, and a=20

Lascar, were put on shore, and the Hunter proceeded on her voyage to Canton=
.  On the 13th of=20

May, 1826, while in command of the St. Patrick, bound from Valparaiso to Po=
ndicherry, captain=20

Dillon came in sight of the island of Tucopia. Prompted by curiosity, as we=
ll as regard for old=20

companions in danger, he lay to, anxious to ascertain whether the persons l=
eft there in 1813, were=20

still alive. A canoe, in which was the Lascar, soon afterwards put off from=
 land and came=20

alongside. This was immediately succeeded by another canoe, containing Mart=
in Buchart, the=20

Prussian. They were both in excellent health, and exceedingly rejoiced to s=
ee him. They informed=20

him, that the natives had treated them very kindly; and that no ship had to=
uched at the island from=20

the time they were first landed, until about a year previous to his arrival=
, when an English which in=20

England we should consider rare, bounds the natural turf and ascends someti=
mes to no=20

inconsiderable height the nearest hills.  Into this valley, toward the midd=
le of September, there=20

defiled one afternoon through a narrow pass a band of about fifty men, all =
armed, and conducting=20

a cavalcade or rather a caravan of mules laden with munitions of war and ot=
her stores. When they=20

had gained the centre of the valley and a general halt was accomplished, th=
eir commander,=20

accompanied by one who was apparently an officer, surveyed all the points o=
f the locality; and,=20

when their companions had rested and refreshed themselves, they gave the ne=
cessary orders for=20

the preparation of a camp. The turf already afforded a sufficient area for =
their present wants, but it=20

was announced that on the morrow they must commence clearing the brushwood.=
 In the mean=20

time, one of the liveliest scenes of military life soon rapidly developed i=
tself: the canvas houses=20

were pitched, the sentries appointed, the videttes established. The commiss=
ariat was limited to=20

bread and olives, and generally the running stream, varied sometimes by cof=
fee, and always=20

consoled by tobacco.  On the third day, amid their cheerful though by no me=
ans light labors, a=20

second caravan arrived, evidently expected and heartily welcomed. Then, in =
another eight-and-

forty hours, smaller bodies of men seemed to drop down from the hills, gene=
rally without stores,=20

but always armed. Then men came from neighboring islands in open boats, and=
 one morning a=20

considerable detachment crossed the water from Corsica. So that at the end =
of a week or ten days=20

there was an=20


_
soon after followed by a second. The Lascar had an old silver sword-guard, =
which he bartered for=20

a few fishing-hooks. Captain Dillon inquired where he had obtained it; the =
Prussian informed him,=20

that on his arrival at the island, he saw it in the possession of the nativ=
es, also several chainplates=20

belonging to a ship, a number of iron bolts, five axes, the handle of a sil=
ver fork, a few knives, tea-

cups, glass beads and bottles, one silver spoon with a crest and a cipher, =
a sword, &c. As soon as=20

he became men in this once silent valley, now a scene of constant stir and =
continual animation, for=20

some one or something was always arriving, and from every quarter; men and =
arms and stores=20

crept in from every wild pass of the mountains and every little rocky harbo=
r of the coast.  About=20

this time, while the officer in command was reviewing a considerable portio=
n of the troops, the rest=20

laboring in still clearing the brushwood and establishing the many works in=
cidental to a camp, half=20

a dozen horsemen were seen descending=20
