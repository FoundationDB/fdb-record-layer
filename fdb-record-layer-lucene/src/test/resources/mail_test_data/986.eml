Persis Franks stopped, Mrs. Sands laughed.  "I suppose," she said, "that th=
e moral of your fable is=20

that wives get on better with the clogs of duty and      "ALEXIS."  If anyt=

pleasure at that moment, it would have been to tear the letter in little pi=
eces, with the writer looking=20

on. Then to throw those pieces in his hateful face, and say, "That's your a=
nswer."  But he was not=20

looking on, and even if he had been I could not have done what I wished. He=
 knew that I would=20

have to consent to see him, that he need have no fear I would profit by my =
knowledge of his=20

intentions, to order him sent away from the stage door. I would have to see=
 him. But how could I=20

manage it after refusing--as I must refuse--to let Raoul go home with me? R=
aoul was coming to=20

me after my death scene on the stage. At the very least, he would expect to=
 put me into my=20

carriage when I left the theatre, even if he went no further. Yet there wou=
ld be Godensky, waiting,=20

and Raoul would see=20


_
without them! But I find that _my_ hands will move fast enough, and my clap=
per strike readily=20

enough without my bothering myself to please my man, much less to obey him!=
 But you're not=20

going away yet, Mrs. Franks?" Persis had risen as if to depart.  "I hope to=
 see you so soon again;=20

you are coming,--at least will you not come and take tea with us this eveni=
ng? You will not wish to=20

stay all alone."  "Oh! I'll not be alone anyhow," said Nancy, also rising f=
rom her seat; "I thought I'd=20

look in on Mrs. Fuddles."  This made Persis press her invitation. "You've n=
ever passed an evening=20

with me since my marriage," she said; "I'd take it so kind if you'd come." =
 "Humph!" said Nancy,=20

doubtfully. An evening at the public-house was more suited to her degraded =
taste than one at the=20

school-house; but she felt the advantage of being able to say to her neighb=
ors that she had taken=20

tea at Mrs. Franks's.  "I want you to see more of my husband," pleaded Pers=
is.  A suspicion=20

flashed across Nancy that there might be some design to convert her. Sudden=
ly and almost=20

fiercely she asked, "Franks won't be after preaching goodness and that sort=
 of thing?"  "No, he'll=20

not preach," answered Persis, quietly, "but he will _practise_," she added =
to herself. "My husband=20

has many amusing sea-stories," said Persis aloud. "Did you ever hear of his=
 crocodile adventure=20

in Madagascar?"  "Well, I'll come; seven is your hour, I think, that you to=
ld me."  "Yes, we take our=20

meal later now, as Ned goes after lessons, with his boys, to work in Wild R=
ose Hollow."  The=20

invitation being accepted, Persis was about to leave the place, when her ey=
e fell on the bottle=20

which Nancy had taken out of the cupboard. The scent which pervaded the roo=
m told that its=20

contents must be gin.  "What avails it to keep her from the public-house," =
thought Persis, "if she=20

has the poison with her at home?" Mrs. Franks's foot was on the threshold, =
but she suddenly=20

turned and came back; her heart fluttered and her cheek flushed, but her re=
solution was taken.=20

"Mrs. Sands," she said rather nervously, "I see that you have a bottle of s=
pirits in the house. Poor=20

Walter Baynes, who is almost sinking, has been ordered strong stimulant by =
the doctor; it is almost=20

necessary to keep him alive. As you happen to have gin at hand, will you, t=
o do me a favor, let me=20

carry that bottle to him?"  Persis was astonished at the boldness of her ow=
n request, and Nancy=20

was scarcely less so.  "He can get it elsewhere," she said sharply.  "I sho=
uld like so much, so very=20

much, to take it to him now from you. I pass his cottage on my way."  Mrs. =
Sands put her stout=20

arms a-kimbo, and Persis was alarmed at the savage expression which came ov=
er her features as=20

she said, "Don't you think I don't guess what you're after. Some one has be=
en slandering me to=20

you. You think that that bottle is safer in your hands than mine."  Franks'=
s wife, trembling, pressed=20

her baby closer to her heart, but she did not utter any denial of the truth=
.  "You'd be a-wanting to=20

get me to give up the drink, not just for to-day, but always."  "And if I c=
ould do so," said Persis,=20

speaking with agitation, for she was nervous and frightened, "if I could pe=
rsuade you to give it up=20

for your own sake, your husband's, the father of your poor boy, should I be=
 acting the part of an=20

enemy or of a friend?"  Nancy Sands was silent for some moments, painful mo=
ments to Persis.=20

She could not read that woman's heart; she did not venture to glance into h=
er face, or she might=20

have seen in the heart the pang of remorse, in the face the sullenness of s=
hame. Mrs. Sands=20

knew, felt, that she was being drawn into misery and degradation, and that =
Persis, the gentle,=20

pure-minded wife, was only acting as a guardian angel might act, seeking to=
 save a perishing soul.=20

Anything like stern rebuke Nancy's proud spirit would not have borne; but P=
ersis, trembling while=20

she pleaded, with moisture glistening on her downcast lashes, did not stir =
up all the fierce wrath=20

and resentment that would in a moment have silenced conscience. Suddenly, h=
alf fiercely, Nancy=20



cried, "Take the bottle; I don't care; I can get more; the poor fellow is w=
elcome to the gin."  Persis=20

did not let the opportunity slip. In a minute she had possessed herself of =
the dangerous bottle, and=20

after stammering thanks, to which Nancy would not listen, Mrs. Franks hurri=
ed away from the=20

place.  "Oh, I'm so thankful that visit is over!" she exclaimed half aloud =
as she passed through the=20

garden gate; "and I shall be thankful when the evening also is over. I hope=
, oh, I do hope, that=20

she'll come to us sober!"     X.  A Happy Home.   Nancy did come perfectly =
sober, and Ned Franks=20

kept his engagement made for him by his wife. Not a word was uttered which =
even the irritable=20

Mrs. Sands, conscious of her own evil habit, could possibly twist into a re=
proach. On the contrary,=20

Persis took care to thank her guest for her kindness in sending what had be=
en valuable medicine=20

to Baynes, and let her know how the poor sinking sufferer from such an _imp=
asse_?     CHAPTER=20

IX   MAXINE GIVES BACK THE DIAMONDS  I tried to answer the question, to dec=
ide something;=20

but my brain felt dead. "I can't think now. I must trust to luck--trust to =
luck," I said to myself,=20

desperately, as Marianne dressed me. "By and by I'll think it all out."  Bu=
t after that my part gave=20

me no more time to think. I was not Maxine de Renzie, but Princess Helene o=
f Hungaria, whose=20

tragic fate was even more sure and swift than miserable Maxine's. When Prin=
cess Helene had=20

died in her lover's arms, however (died as Maxine had not deserved to die),=
 and I was able to pick=20

up the tangled threads of my own life, where I'd laid them down, the questi=
ons were still crying out=20

for answer, and must somehow be decided at once.  First, there was Raoul to=
 be put off and got=20

out of the way--Raoul, my best beloved, whose help and protection I needed =
so much, yet must=20

forego, and hurt him instead.  The stage-door keeper had orders to let him =
"come behind," and so=20

he was already waiting at the door of my little boudoir by the time Helene =
had died, the curtain had=20

gone down, and Maxine de Renzie had been able to leave the stage.  As we we=
nt together into=20

the room, he caught both my hands, crushing them tightly in his, and kissin=
g them over and over=20

again. But his face was pale and sad, and a new fear sprang up in my heart,=
 like a sudden live=20

flame among red ashes.  "What is it, Raoul?--why do you look like that?" I =
asked; while inside my=20

head another question sounded like a shriek. "What if some word had come to=
 him in the theatre--

about the treaty?"  Then I could have cried as a child cries, with the snap=
ping of the tension, when=20

he answered: "It was only that terrible last scene, darling. I've seen you =
die in other parts. But it=20

never affected me like this. Perhaps it's because you didn't belong to me i=
n those days. Or is it that=20

you were more realistic in your acting to-night than ever before? Anyway, i=
t was awful--so horribly=20

real. It was all I could do to sit still and not jump out of the box to sav=
e you. Prince Cyril was a poor=20

chap not to thwart the villain. I should have killed him in the third act, =
and then Helene might have=20

been happily married, instead of dying."  "I believe you would have killed =
him," I said.  "I know I=20

should. It's a mistake not to be jealous. I admit that I'm jealous. But suc=
h jealousy is a compliment=20

to a woman, my dearest, not an insult."  "How you feel things!" I exclaimed=
. "Even a play on the=20

stage--"  "If the woman I love is the heroine."  "Will you ever be blase, l=
ike the rest of the men I=20

know?" I laughed, though I could have sobbed.  "Never, I think. It isn't in=
 me. Do you despise me=20

for my enthusiasm?"  "I only love you the more," I said, wondering every in=
stant, in a kind of horrid=20

undertone, how I was to get him away.  "I admit I wasn't made for diplomacy=
," he went on. "I wish,=20

I had money enough to get out of it and take you off the stage, away into s=
ome beautiful, peaceful=20

world, where we need think of nothing but our love for each other, and the =
good we might do=20

others because of our love, and to keep our world beautiful. Would you go w=
ith me?"  "Ah, if I=20



could!" I sighed. "If I could go with you to-morrow, away into that beautif=
ul, peaceful world. But-

who knows? Meanwhile--"  "Meanwhile, you don't mean to send me away from yo=
u?" he pleaded,=20

in a coaxing way he has, which is part of his charm, and makes him seem lik=
e a boy. "You don't=20

know what it is, after that scene of your death on the stage, where I could=
n't get to you--where=20

another man was your lover--to touch you again, alive and warm, your own ad=
orable, vivid self.=20

You _will_ let me go home with you, in your carriage, anyhow as far as the =
house, and kiss you=20

good-night there, even if you're so tired you must drive me out then?"  I w=
ould have given all my=20

success of that night, and more, to say "yes." But instead I had to stumble=
 into excuses. I had to=20

argue that we mustn't be seen leaving the theatre together--yet, until ever=
yone knew that we were=20

engaged. As for letting him come to me at home, if he dreamt how my head ac=
hed, he wouldn't=20

ask it. I almost broke down as I said this; and poor Raoul was so sorry for=
 me that he immediately=20

offered to leave me at once.  "It's a great sacrifice, though, to give up w=
hat I've been looking=20

forward to for days," he said, "and to let you go from me to-night of all n=
ights."  "Why to-night of all=20

nights?", I asked quickly, my coward conscience frightening me again.  "Onl=
y because I love you=20

more than ever, and--it's a stupid feeling, of course, I suppose all the fa=
ult of that last scene in the=20

play--yet I feel as if--But no, I don't want to say it."  "You must say it,=
" I cried.  "Well, if only to hear=20

you contradict me, then. I feel as if I were in danger of losing you. It's =
just a feeling--a weight on=20

my heart. Nothing more. Rather womanish, isn't it?"  "Not womanish, but foo=
lish," I said. "Shake off=20

the feeling, as one wakes up from a nightmare. Think of=20


_
its effect.  Everything was done by the Frankses to make the evening pass p=
leasantly to their=20

guest. Their parlor with its jars of fresh flowers, the snow-white cloth sp=
read on the table covered=20

with the pretty tea-service, which had been a wedding-gift to Persis, tempt=
ing bread and butter and=20

the home-made cake for which the school-master's wife was famous,--all form=
ed a picture of=20

neatness and comfort. Mrs. Sands could not help contrasting Franks's cottag=
e with her own. How=20

different the home where holiness and love went hand in hand, from the unti=
dy, comfortless=20

dwelling of the drunkard!  Ned made himself exceedingly amusing; the sweete=
r." As I spoke, it was=20

as if a voice echoed mine, saying different words mockingly. "If there be a=
ny meeting--to-morrow,=20

or ever."  I shut my ears to the voice, and went on quickly:  "Before we sa=
y good-bye, I've=20

something to show you--something you'll like very much. Wait here till I ge=
t it from the next room."=20

Marianne was tidying my dressing-room for the night, bustling here and ther=
e, a dear old,=20

comfortable, dependable thing. She was delighted with my success, which she=
 knew all about, of=20

course; but she was not in the least excited, because she had loyally expec=
ted me to succeed,=20

and would have thought the sky=20


_
stories, and Nancy, under the genial influence of pleasant society, brought=
 out some of her own,=20

which she related with a good deal of spirit. Persis was surprised to find =
that her guest could be=20

really agreeable, and Franks, for the first time, was able to guess what co=
uld possibly have made=20

poor John Sands take a fancy to Nancy. There was nothing to ruffle Mrs. San=
ds's temper, much=20

placid as she was on other, less important nights, far more placid than she=
 would have been if she=20

had known that she was guarding not only my jewellery, but a famous diamond=
 necklace, worth at=20

least five hundred thousand francs.  There it was, under the lowest tray of=
 my jewel box. I had felt=20

perfectly safe in leaving it there, for I knew that nothing on earth--short=
 of a bomb=20
