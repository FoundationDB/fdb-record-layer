funeral. It's your deal."  The cards were dealt, and the game played, resul=

the tough won every time. Still the youth kept on, a quiet smile resting on=
 his pleasant features, a twinkle in his coal-black eye. The youth, dear re=
ader, you have met before.  _He_ is not he, but instead--Calamity Jane.  "B=
ut, Mr. Beecher," replied the sexton with wounded pride, "it doesn't need i=

the eye; and the sexton understood.  Mr. Beecher was constantly thoughtful =
of a struggling young man's welfare, even at the expense of his own materia=

that settled it for him.  "What's the=20

was plain to see that he was a desperate character.  The game was poker. Th=
e youth had won=20

three straight games and now laid down the cards that ended the fourth in h=
is favor.  "You're=20

flaxed ag'in, pardner!" he said, with a light laugh, as he raked in the sta=
kes. "This takes your all,=20

eh?"  "Every darned bit!" said the "Cattymount"--for it was he--with an oat=

_The Eagle_ can stand it better than this boy; don't you think so?"  To the=

 man.  "Looked hard=20

for it?" was the next question.  "I have," and the man looked Mr. Beecher i=

some?" asked Mr. Beecher.  "I do," said the man.  "Come with me," said the =
preacher.  And then=20
