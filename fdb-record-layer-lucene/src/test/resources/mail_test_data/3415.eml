ffee, but had hardly begun to drink it when I heard the ominous sound of a =
scattering skirmish fire, apparently in the direction of Appomattox Court-h=
ouse. Hastily swallowing what remained of the coffee, I reported to General=
 Sheridan, who directed me to go to the front at once. Springing into the s=

deal that's wicked and weak to talk about. For I said it before, and I says=
 it again--a man's=20

conscience isn't always as clean as it might be.  MANDERS. Give me your han=

his hand]. There we are!  ENGSTRAND. And if I might humbly beg your Reveren=

MANDERS. You? On the contrary, it is I who ought to beg your pardon--  ENGS=
TRAND. Lord, no,=20

Sir!  MANDERS. Yes, assuredly. And I do it with all my heart. Forgive me fo=

you. I only wish I could give you some proof of my hearty regret, and of my=
 good-will towards you--=20

ENGSTRAND. Would your Reverence do it?  MANDERS. With the greatest pleasure=
.=20

ENGSTRAND. Well then, here's the very chance. With the bit of money I've sa=
ved here, I was=20

thinking I might set up a Sailors' Home down in the town.  MRS. ALVING. You=
?  ENGSTRAND.=20

Yes; it might be a sort of Orphanage, too, in a manner of speaking. There's=
 such a many=20

temptations for seafaring folk ashore. But in this Home of mine, a man migh=
t feel like as he was=20

under a father's eye, I was thinking.  MANDERS. What do you say to this, Mr=
s. Alving?=20

ENGSTRAND. It isn't much as I've got to start with, Lord help me! But if I =
could only find a helping=20

hand, why--  MANDERS. Yes, yes; we will look respective cavalry commands, h=
ad charged into=20

the station and captured four railway trains of commissariat supplies, whic=
h had been sent here to=20

await the arrival of the Confederate army, together with twenty-six pieces =
of artillery. For a few=20

moments the artillery had greatly surprised and astonished us, for its pres=
ence was entirely=20

unexpected, and as it suddenly opened on the charging columns of cavalry it=
 looked for a short=20

time as though we might have all unwittingly fallen upon a division of infa=
ntry. However, it turned=20

out otherwise. Our cavalry, after the first recoil, boldly charged in among=
 the batteries, and the=20

gunners, being without adequate support, sensibly surrendered. The whole af=
fair was for us a=20

most gratifying termination of a long day=E2=80=99s ride, as it must have p=
roved later on a bitter=20

disappointment to the weary and hungry Confederates pressing forward from P=
etersburg and=20

Richmond in the vain hope of escape from the Federal troops, who were strai=
ning every nerve to=20

overtake them and compel a surrender. To-night the cavalry corps was in the=
ir front and squarely=20

across the road to Lynchburg, and it was reasonably certain, should our inf=
antry get up in time on=20

the morrow, that the almost ceaseless marching and fighting of the last ten=
 days were to attain=20

their legitimate result in the capitulation of General Lee=E2=80=99s army. =

get the candles=20

lighted, so as to give the place an air of festivity. And then we will pass=
 an edifying hour together,=20

my good fellow; for now I quite believe you are in the right frame precedin=

upon me with startling emphasis that to-morrow=E2=80=99s sun would rise big=
 with the fate of the Southern=20
