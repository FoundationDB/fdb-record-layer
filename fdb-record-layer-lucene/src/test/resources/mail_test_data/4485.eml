serious condition. Notwithstanding his care, I grew worse, and the swelling of my feet gradually

times it seemed almost as if it would burst. My feet were painfully cold, and even when surrounded 

with hot flannels and irons felt as if a strong wind were blowing on them. Next my right leg became 

paralyzed. This gave me no pain, but it was exceedingly annoying. About this time I began to spit 

blood most freely, although my lungs were in perfect condition, and I knew it did not come from 

them. My physicians were careful and untiring in their attentions, but unable to relieve my 

sufferings. My neighbors and friends thought I was dying and many called to see me, fully twenty-

five on a single Sunday that I now recall. At last my agony seemed to culminate in the most 

intense, sharp pains I have ever known or heard of. If red hot knives sharpened to the highest 

degree had been run through my body constantly they could not have hurt me worse. I would 

spring up in bed, sometimes as much as three feet, cry out in my agony and long for death. One 

night the misery was so intense that I arose and attempted to go into the next room, but was 

unable to lift my swollen feet above the little threshold that obstructed them. I fell back upon the 

bed and gasped in my agony, but felt unable even to breathe. It seemed like death.  "Several 

years ago Rev. Dr. J. E. Rankin, now of Washington, was stationed here as pastor of the 

Congregational church. We all admired and respected him, and my wife remembered seeing 

somewhere that he had spoken in the highest terms of a preparation which had cured some of his 

intimate friends. We provided that  * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive

it, and, to make a long story short, it completely restored my health, brought me back from the 

grave, and I owe all I have in the way of health and strength to Warner's Safe Cure, better known 

as Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure. I am positive that if I had taken this medicine when I felt 

the first symptoms above described, I might have avoided all the agony I afterward endured, to 

say nothing of the narrow escape I had from death."  In order that all possible facts bearing upon 

the subject might be known, I called on Dr. Oscar F. Fassett, who was for nineteen years United 

States Examining Surgeon, and who attended Mr. Jacques during his sickness. He stated that Mr. 

Jacques had a most pronounced case of Albuminuria or Bright's disease of the kidneys. That an 

analysis showed the presence of albumen and casts in great abundance and that he was in a 

condition where few if any ever recover. His recovery was due to Warner's Safe Cure.  Mr. John 

W. Hobart, General Manager of the Vermont Central railroad, stated that Mr. Jacques was one of 

the best and most faithful of  1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

employes, that his sickness had been an exceedingly severe one and the company were not only 

glad to again have his services, but grateful to the remedy that had cured so valuable a man.  Mr. 

James M. Foss, assistant superintendent and master mechanic of the Vermont Central railroad, is 

also able to confirm this.  I do not claim to be a great discoverer, but I do think I have found in the 

above a most remarkable case and knowing the unusual increase of Bright's disease feel that the 

public should have the benefit of it. It seems to me a remedy that can accomplish so much in the 

last stages ought do even more for the first approach of this deceptive yet terrible trouble.  F. B.
