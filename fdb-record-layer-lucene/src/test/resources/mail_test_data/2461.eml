infrequently, alas, the pride of learning mars her verse; it is overloaded =
with pedantic allusions, stiff=20

with learning, and too manifestly the product of a learned head rather than=
 of an overflowing heart.=20

Where these faults appear less, or not at all, is in the poems inspired by =
genuine feeling for her=20

loved ones; there the real heart of the woman, bravely struggling to bear u=
p and smile before the=20

world, is laid bare to us in sudden glimpses of unpremeditated poetry. It i=
s an old theme, but one=20

of pathos ever fresh, that we find in the following lines:          "Je cha=
nte par couverture (_i. e._,=20

contenance),         Mais mieux pleurassent mes oeil (yeux),         Ne nul=
 ne sait le travail         Que=20

mon pauvre coeur endure.         Pour ce (je) muce (cache) ma douleur      =
   Qu'en nul je ne vois=20

pitie.         Plus on a cause de pleur (pleurer),         Moins on trouve =
d'amitie.         Pour ce plainte=20

ne murmure         Ne fais de mon piteux deuil.         Aincois (plutot) (j=
e) ris quand pleurer veuil=20

(veux),         Et sans rime et sans mesure         Je chante par couvertur=
e."  It is, you see, the old=20

_motif_, in melodramatic pathos that of the harlequin Dorkins, who must pla=
y his part in the=20

pantomime even though his child lie dying, in tragedy that of Lady Macbeth,=
 who must play the=20

queen by day and suffer the torments of the murderess at night. It is not t=
he novelty but the=20

universality and truth of the idea or sentiment that makes Christine's vers=
es rank as poetry.  But=20

love songs alone could not support a family of five; the Church, so often t=
he refuge of forlorn=20

women, might have offered Christine a refuge, but not support for those dep=
endent on her, since=20

she had not sufficient influence to assure herself of any office of dignity=
 and emolument in the=20

convents of the proud and wealthy. Her pen must be her resource; and thus C=
hristine de Pisan=20



became not merely an authoress, but the first authoress to support herself =
by her pen. For some=20

of her shorter poems she received not inconsiderable sums; but longer works=
, works of more=20

permanent value must be undertaken, and Christine valiantly set to work.  H=
er first task was to=20

secure a patron, for only some great lord could afford to pay sums sufficie=
nt to enable her to live:=20

there was no eager public of thousands, educated by the printing press to e=
xpect, to welcome, to=20

demand fresh intellectual food. One of her patrons was the great Duke of Bu=
rgundy, Philippe le=20

Hardi, to whom she dedicated a very long and partly autobiographical poem c=
alled _La Mutation=20

de Fortune_. She tells her story with rather too much display of the fact t=
hat she knows all the=20

famous apologues and anecdotes that might apply to her case; still, it is a=
n earnest and in some=20

ways interesting account of how she had been compelled to take up a profess=
ion not then=20

regarded as befitting a woman how,--as she says, she had turned herself "fr=
om woman to man."=20

She read this work to Philippe de Bourgogne in that same palace where she h=
ad once been a=20

familiar inmate, where she had played as a child, where she had learned to =
know the famous men=20

through whose aid Charles V. had well-nigh regenerated France. It is not su=
rprising that Philippe=20

de Bourgogne should think of her as specially fitted to undertake a task re=
quiring intimate=20

knowledge of that king and his time. The duke, sending for her one day as s=
he sat in the midst of a=20

pile of books, pen in hand, asked her to undertake the writing of a life of=
 his great brother.  With=20

ready devotion she set about writing the life of Charles V., of the king wh=
o, "when I was a child,=20

gave me my bread." In due time her book, _Le Livre des faits et bonnes moeu=
rs du roi Charles=20

V._, was completed; but he for whom she had written it had died in 1404, be=
fore half was done.=20

The loss of her generous friend and protector was a serious blow to the poe=
tess. Her mother had=20

also died; while Christine must plod wearily on, though "her heart was fill=
ed with joy when she=20

remembered that the day was not very far off when she herself would go to j=
oin the loved ones."=20

The history of Charles V. is a work of which one hardly knows what to say. =
As history, it is=20

manifestly a failure, for Christine had either no wish or no opportunity to=
 present facts in a=20

narrative at once accurate, detailed, and clear; her work lacks both the ac=
curacy and the breadth=20

of view of genuine history; it is rather, as one critic remarks, an _eloge_=
, a eulogy upon Charles=20

V.--which, indeed, had been what Philippe desired. The book is in prose, an=
d though the style=20

lacks the clearness and vividness to which we are accustomed in such men of=
 genius as=20

Villehardouin, Joinville, and her own contemporary, Froissart, we must reme=
mber that these men=20

had reached the high-water mark of French style, not to be equalled, in sob=
er truth, till the=20

Renaissance, the "New Birth," had regenerated the fallen life and literatur=
e of Europe. As prose of=20

the early fifteenth century, Christine's work is better than any other then=
 written, except that of=20

Froissart; and not a little of his charm comes less from the style than fro=
m the matters of which he=20

chose to write. There is in Christine's book little of the gorgeousness of =
chivalry: was not the king=20

in whose praise she wrote a king who won his battles at the council table, =
while Du Guesclin, upon=20

the field of battle, gave the hard knocks which his sovereign, weak and sic=
kly, could neither give=20

nor take? Where Christine does succeed is in her portraits of the king and =
his courtiers, whose=20

characters she knew perfectly and whose good and bad traits she does not sc=
ruple to depict with=20

such even justice as she may. To quote the words of one of her most recent =
critics, who does not=20

fail to call attention to the awkward Latinisms of her diction and the lops=
ided Ciceronian periods in=20

her attempts at elevation or eloquence: "No one has made us feel more disti=
nctly the winning=20



grace of the Duke d'Orleans, brother of Charles VI., nor has any one better=
 depicted the physical=20

aspect of Charles V.; clearly do we see the long face, the broad forehead,=

ce thin to=20

emaciation; it is the face of an ascetic, tempered by the gentleness of the=
 expression and=20

something staid and thoughtful in the whole look. Nor is there mere banalit=
y and commonplace in=20

the moral portrait of the king; if she praises his chevalerie (chivalry), s=
he does not conceal the fact=20

that, weak and sickly, his hand never drew the sword from the day of his ac=
cession to the day of=20

his death."  The mere list of Christine's works would fill much space, and =
in the end we should not=20

be much edified thereby; for she was a=20
