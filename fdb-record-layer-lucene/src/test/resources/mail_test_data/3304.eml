the desolation of the moor is not to be found by its riversides, unless it =
be in their boggy cradles.=20

Here by the young Dart is a plentiful growth of trees and luxuriance of pla=
nt life; the boulders are=20

draped with weeds and water-mosses. There is variety also in the colouring =
of the lichens; and in=20

their due season who shall describe the glory of the flaming ferns, the gol=
d of the gorse, the=20

purples of ling and heather? This is the moor and the river in their gentle=
r aspects; there are times=20

when both become a fierce passion, a wild dream, almost a horror.  It is im=
possible as well as=20

undesirable to mention all the prehistoric remains that cluster so thickly =
on the central moorland.=20

This is not a guidebook, and there are excellent publications, such as the =
writings of Mr. Crossing=20

and the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, in which all necessary details are given.  Fo=
r one of the most typical=20

features, the clapper-bridges, we cannot claim the greatest antiquity, as t=
he surviving specimens=20

are on the pack-horse routes, and not on the moor's more ancient trackways.=
 There was one at=20

Two Bridges, but it has gone; and, still nearer to Princetown, there is one=
 over the Ockery, a=20

rugged structure of unwrought boulders, to which later parapets have been a=
dded. The true=20

Dartmoor bridge has no parapet. One of the finest is at Postbridge, in the =
very heart of the moor;=20

there are others at Teign Head and Dartmeet. In these bridges the huge "cla=
ppers" or blocks of=20

granite lie absolutely unmorticed. Two of the horizontal blocks at Postbrid=
ge are about fifteen feet=20

in length. At Scaur Hill there is a bridge of a single massive boulder. Tho=
ugh essentially=20

characteristic of Dartmoor, there are similar bridges elsewhere, as at Torr=
 Steps over the Exmoor=20

Barle, and in the   It soon became obvious that the salmon-fishers from the=
 other side of the=20

Atlantic had got into a long spell of deplorably fine weather; and a gentle=
 melancholy settled down=20

upon the souls of the gillies.  In vain, morning after morning, the men sea=
rched every quarter of=20

the heavens for any sign of even a couple of days' deluge to flood the rive=
rs and send the kelts=20

down and bring the clean salmon up from the sea.  This wild and bleak regio=
n grew to be like=20

 far treeless stretches=20

Clebrig's snows had nearly all melted away.  Nor could the discontented boa=
tmen understand how=20

the two strangers should accept this state of affairs with apparent equanim=
ity.  Both were now=20

provided with a book; and when the rods had been properly set so as to be r=
eady for any=20

emergency, they could pass the time pleasantly enough in this perfect still=
ness, gliding over the=20

smooth waters, and drinking in the sweet mountain air.  As for Miss Carry, =
she had again attacked=20

the first volume of Gibbon--for she would hot be beaten; and very startling=
 indeed it was when a=20

fish did happen to strike the minnow, to be so suddenly summoned back from =
Palmyra to this=20

Another special interest attaches to Postbridge: it is here that the ghostl=
y and indistinct Lych Way=20

starts on its route to Lydford church. By this track in old days burial par=
ties carried their dead to=20

Lydford, which is still the parish church of a larger section of the moorla=
nd. Before the year 1260=20

Lydford had to be resorted to for find the rod being violently shaken and t=
he reel screaming out its=20

joyous note.  Moreover, in this still weather, the unusual visitor not unfr=
equently brought some=20

other element of surprise with him.  She acquired a considerable experience=
 of the different forms=20

of foul-hooking and of the odd manoeuvres of the fish in such=20

religious purposes; from that date permission was given to inhabitants of t=
he eastern moors to use=20

the church of Widecombe. In days before education had done something to kil=
l picturesque=20

imaginings, it is not surprising that many a phantom cortege was supposed t=
o wend its way along=20

this haunted track; and the moor folk were very careful not to pass that wa=
y alone at night-time.=20

But the ghosts have been laid now, or men's eyes are sealed by their incred=
ulity; the only night-

haunters of Dartmoor are mist, and rain, and storm.  In making a tour of th=

Lydford, the mother-parish, which, with an extent of 56,333 acres, claims t=
o be the largest parish=20

in England. Lydford boasts of importance even as far back as the Roman inva=
sion, but this is very=20

dubious; there is no sign of anything Roman either at Lydford or on the moo=
rland. The town was=20

burnt by the Danes in 997, when they also destroyed Tavistock Abbey. It is =
certain that Lydford=20

ranked high among the Stannary towns, and was a place of consequence. Its c=
astle, dating from=20

soon after the Conquest, is by no means imposing in its present appearance,=
 but as a Stannary=20

f to him by speaking of=20

the shooting----'  'You know very well, Carry,' he would answer--trying to =
draw her into the fields of=20

common sense--'I can say nothing about that till I see how mother's health =
is.'  'I am sure she=20
