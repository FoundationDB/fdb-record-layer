Scipio and Edith were sold to Arthur Randolph, a physician and large plantation owner of Fort Louis, about five _
them that they were free. Mr. Snellings showed no resistance and he was not harmed. The slaves 

on hearing this good news of freedom burst out in song and praises to God: it was a gala day. No 

work was done for a week; the time was spent in celebrating. The master told his slaves that they 

were free and could go wherever they wanted to, or they could remain with him if they wished. 

Most of his 200 slaves refused to leave him because he was considered a good master.  They 

were thereafter given individual farms, mules and farm implements with which to cultivate the land; 

their former master got a share out of what was raised. There was no more whipping, no more 

forced labor and hours were less drastic.  Mack Mullen's parents were among those slaves who 

remained; they lived there until Mr. Snellings died, and then moved to Isonvillen, near Americus, 

Georgia, where his father opened a black-smith shop, and made enough money to buy some 

property. Another child was added to the family, a girl named Mariah. By this time Mack had 

become a young man with a strong desire to travel, so he bade his parents farewell and headed 

for Tampa, Florida. After living there awhile he came to Jacksonville, Florida. At the time of his 

arrival in Jacksonville, Bay Street was paved with blocks and there were no hard surfaced streets 

in the city.  He was one of the construction, foremen of the Windsor Hotel. Mack Mullen is tall, grey 

haired, sharp featured and of Caucasian strain (his mother was a mulatto) with a keen mind and 

an appearance that belies his 75 years. He laments that he was freed because his master was 

good to his slaves; he says "we had everything we wanted; working itself clear. The basis of the 

rational belief in the immortality of the soul, or, to speak more correctly, in the continuance of our 

spiritual existence after death is the conviction, common, so far as we know, to all the higher 

portions of humanity, and apparently ineradicable, that our moral responsibility extends beyond 

the grave; that we do not by death terminate the consequences of our actions, or our relations to 

those to whom we have done good or evil; and that to die the death of the righteous is better than 

to have lived a life of pleasure even with the approbation of an undiscerning world. So far from 

growing weaker, this conviction appears to grow practically stronger among the most highly 

educated and intelligent of mankind, though they may have cast off the last remnant of primitive or 

medieval superstition, and though they may have ceased to profess belief in any special form of 

the doctrine. The Comtists certainly have not got rid of it, since they have devised a subjective 

immortality with a retributive distinction between the virtuous and the wicked; to say nothing of 

their singular proposal that the dead should be formally judged by the survivors, and buried, 

according to the judgment passed upon them, in graves of honour or disgrace.  With regard to 

religion generally there is the same tendency to exaggerate the significance of "survivals," and to 

neglect, on the other hand, the phenomena of disengagement. Because the primitive fables and 

illusions which long adhere to religion are undeniably dying out, it is asserted, or suggested, that 

religion itself is dying. Religion is identified with mythology. But mythology is

proper down the old Saint Augustine Road lives one Louis Napoleon an ex-slave, born in of 

religion. Mythology is the embodiment of man's childlike notions as to the universe in which he 

finds himself, and the powers which for good or evil influence his lot; and, when analysed, it is 

found beneath all its national variations to be merely based upon a worship of the sun, the moon, 

and the forces of Nature. Religion is the worship and service of a moral God and a God who is 

worshipped and served by virtue. We can distinctly see, in Greek
