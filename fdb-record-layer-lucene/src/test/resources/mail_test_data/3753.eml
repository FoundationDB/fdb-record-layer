   Mack Mullen,=20

a former slave who now lives at 521 W. First Street, Jacksonville, Florida,=
 was born in Americus,=20

Georgia in 1857, eight years before Emancipation, on a plantation which cov=
ered an area of=20

approximately five miles. Upon this expansive plantation about 200 slaves l=
ived and labored. At its=20

main entrance stood a large white colonial mansion.  In this abode lived Di=
ck Snellings, the=20

master, and his family. The Snellings plantation produced cotton, corn, oat=
s, wheat, peanuts,=20

potatoes, cane and other commodities. The live stock consisted primarily of=
 hogs and cattle. There=20

was on the plantation what was known as a "crib," where oats, corn and whea=
t were stored, and a=20

"smoke house" for pork and beef. The slaves received their rations weekly, =
it was apportioned=20

according to the number in the family.  Mack Mullen's mother was named Elle=
n and his father=20

Sam. Ellen was "house woman" and Sam did the blacksmithing, Ellen personall=
y attended Mrs.=20

Snellings, the master's wife. Mack being quite young did not have any parti=
cular duties assigned to=20

him, but stayed around the Snellings mansion and played. Sometimes "marster=
" Snellings would=20

take him on his knee and talk to him. Mack remembers that he often told him=
 that some day he=20

was going to be a noble man. He said that he was going perception, and that=
 no other faculties or=20

means of communication with the universe can ever in the course of evolutio=
n be developed in=20

man? Around us are animals absolutely unconscious, so far as we can discern=
, of that universe=20

which Science has revealed to us. A sea anemone, if it can reflect, probabl=
y feels as confident that=20

it perceives everything capable of being perceived as the man of science. T=
he reasonable=20

supposition, surely, is that though Science, so far as it goes, is real, an=
d the guide of our present=20

life, its relation to the sum of things is not much more considerable than =
that of the perceptions of=20

the lower orders of animals. That our notions of the universe have been so =
vastly enlarged by the=20

mere invention of astronomical instruments is enough in itself to suggest t=
he possibility of further=20

and infinitely greater enlargement. To our bodily senses, no doubt, and to =
physical science, which=20

is limited by them, human existence seems to end with death; but if there i=
s anything in our nature=20

which tells us, with a distinctness and persistency equal to those of our s=
ensible perceptions, that=20

hope and responsibility extend beyond death, why is this assurance not as m=
uch to be trusted as=20

that of the bodily sense itself? There is apparently no ultimate criterion =
of truth, whether physical or=20

moral, except our inability, constituted as we are to=20


_
him the head overseer. He would often give him candy and money and take him=
 in his buggy for a=20

ride.   Plantation Life: The slaves lived in cabins called quarters, which =
were constructed of lumber=20

and logs. A white man was their overseer, he assigned the slaves their resp=
ective tasks. There=20

was also a slave known as a "caller." He came around to the slave cabins ev=
ery morning at four=20

o'clock and blew a "cow-horn" which was the signal for the slaves to get up=
 and prepare=20

themselves for work in the fields.  All of them on hearing this horn would =
arise and prepare their=20

meal; by six o'clock they were on their way to the fields. They would work =
all day, stopping only for=20

a brief period at midday to eat. Mack Mullen says that some of the most bea=
utiful spirituals were=20

sung while they labored.  The women wore towels wrapped around their heads =
for protection from=20

the sun, and most of them smoked pipes. The overseer often took Mack with h=
im astride his horse=20

as he made his "rounds" to inspect the work being done. About sundown, the =
"cow-horn" of the=20

caller was blown and all hands stopped work, and made their way back to the=
ir cabins. One=20

behind the other they marched singing "I'm gonna wait 'til Jesus Comes." Af=
ter arriving at their=20

cabins they would prepare their meals; after eating they would sometimes ga=
ther in front of a=20

cabin and dance to the tunes played on the fiddle and the drum. The popular=
 dance at that time=20

was known as the "figure dance." At nine p.m. the overseer would come aroun=
d; everything was=20

this criterion seems to be satisfied by a universal and ineradicable moral =
conviction as well as by a=20

universal and irresistible impression of sense.  We are enjoined, some time=
s with a vehemence=20

approaching that of ecclesiastical anathema, to refuse to consider anything=
 which lies beyond the=20

range of experience. By experience is meant the perceptions of our bodily s=
enses, the absolute=20

completeness and finality of which, we must repeat, is an assumption, the w=
arrant for which must=20

at all events be produced from other authority than that of the senses them=
selves. On this ground=20

we are called upon to discard, as worthy of nothing but derision, the ideas=
 of eternity and infinity.=20

But to dislodge these ideas from our minds is impossible; just as impossibl=
e as it is to dislodge any=20

idea that has entered through the channels of the senses; and this being so=
, it is surely=20

conceivable that they may not be mere illusions, but real extensions of our=
 intelligence beyond the=20

domain of mere bodily sense, indicating an upward progress of our nature. O=
f course if these=20

ideas correspond to reality, physical science, though true as far as it goe=
s, cannot be the whole=20

truth, or even bear any considerable relation to the whole truth, since it =
necessarily presents Being=20

as limited by space and time.  Whither obedience to the dictates of the hig=
her part of our nature=20

will ultimately carry us, we may not be able, apart from Revelation, to say=
; but there seems no=20

substantial reason for refusing to believe that it carries us towards=20


_
slaves would "turn in" for the night while others would remain up as long a=
s they wished or as long=20

as they were quiet.  The slaves were sometimes given special holidays and o=
n those days they=20

would give "quilting" parties (quilt making) and dances. These parties were=
 sometimes held on=20

their own plantation and sometimes on a neighboring one. Slaves who ordinar=
ily wanted to visit=20

another plantation had to get a permit from the imperfection of our percept=
ive powers, of the mode=20

in which we shall pass into that better state, or of its precise relation t=
o our present existence,=20

cannot cancel an assurance, otherwise valid, of our general destiny. A tran=
smutation of humanity,=20

such as we can conceive to be brought about by the gradual prevalence of hi=
gher motives of=20

action, and the gradual elimination thereby of what is base and brutish, is=
 surely no more=20


_
going off the plantation without a permit, they were severely whipped by th=
e "patrolmen" (white=20

men especially assigned to patrol duty around the plantation to prevent pro=
miscuous wandering=20

from plantations and "runaways.")   Whipping: There was a white man assigne=
d only to whip the=20

slaves when they were insubordinate; however, they were not allowed to whip=
 them too severely=20

as "Marster" Snellings would not permit it. He would say "a slave is of no =
use to me beaten to=20

death."   Marriage: When one slave fell in love with another and wanted to =
marry they were given=20

a license and the matrimony was "sealed." There was no marriage ceremony pe=
rformed. A license=20

was all that was necessary to be considered married. In the event that the =
lovers lived on separate=20

plantations the master of one of them would buy the other lover or wedded o=
ne so that they would=20

be together. When this could not be arranged they would have to visit one a=
nother, but live on=20

their respective plantations.   Religion: The slaves had a regular church h=
ouse, which was a small=20

size building constructed of boards. now, out of a lower animal form or out=
 of inorganic matter.=20

What the bearing of the automatic theory of human nature would be upon the =
hopes and=20

aspirations of man, or on moral philosophy generally, it might be difficult=
, no doubt, to say. But has=20

any one of the distinguished advocates of the automatic theory ever acted o=
n it, or allowed his=20

thoughts to be really ruled by it for a moment? What can be imagined more s=
trange than an=20

automaton suddenly becoming conscious of its own automatic character, reaso=
ning and debating=20

about it automatically, and coming automatically to the conclusion that the=
 automatic theory of=20

itself is true? Nor is there any occasion here to entangle ourselves in the=
 controversy about=20

Necessarianism. If the race can act progressively on higher and more unself=
ish motives, as history=20

proves to be the fact, there can be nothing in the connection between our a=
ctions and their=20

antecedents inconsistent with the ascent of man. Jonathan Edwards is undoub=
tedly right in=20

maintaining that there is a connection between every human action and its a=
ntecedents. But the=20


_
minister especially assigned to this duty. On Tuesday evenings prayer meeti=
ng was held; on=20

Thursday evenings, preaching; and on Sundays both morning and evening preac=
hing. At these=20

services the slaves would "get happy" and shout excitedly. Those desiring t=
o accept Christ were=20

admitted for baptism.   Baptism: On nature of the connection remains a myst=
ery. We learn its=20

existence not from inspection, but from consciousness, and this same consci=
ousness tells us that=20

the connection is not such as to preclude the existence of liberty of choic=
e, moral aspiration, moral=20

effort, moral responsibility, which are the=20


_
they had made, marched down to the river where they were immersed by the mi=
nister. Slaves=20

from neighboring plantations would come to witness this sacred ceremony. Ma=
ck Mullen recalls=20

that many times his "marster" on going to view a baptism took him along in =
his buggy. It was a=20

happy scene, he relates. The slaves would be effect_, and others of that ki=
nd, which the=20

imperfection of psychological language compels us to use in speaking of the=
 mental connection=20

between action and its antecedents, are steeped from their employment in co=
nnection with=20

physical science, in physical association, and the import with them into th=
e moral sphere the=20
