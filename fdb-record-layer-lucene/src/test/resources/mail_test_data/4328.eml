  The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that dracaena margin=
ata distinguish between the Dhyani Buddhas and the human Buddhas, and must =
not apply to the great BUDDHA of the Fifth Race all that is ascribed to "th=
e Buddha" in books where, as said, blinds are constantly introduced.  In on=
e of these books some strange and obscure statements are made which the wri=

 the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur d'Arminges. =
The youths spurred on.  "There is the wounded man," said De Guiche, passing=
 close to the Augustine brother. "Be good enough to hurry yourself a little=
, monsieur monk."  As for Raoul, he avoided the monk by the whole width of =
the road and passed him, turning his head away in repulsion.  The young men=
 rode up to the wounded man to announce that _
of Knowledge. In both the Dragon steals some of this, and is exiled from he=
aven by Vishnu, or=20

Vajradhara, or the chief God, whatever may be his name. We find the same in=
 the Book of=20

_Enoch_, and it is poetized in St. John's _Revelation_. And now the allegor=
y, with all its fanciful=20

ornamentations, has become a dogma!  As will be found mentioned later, the =
Tibetan Lamaseris=20

contain many secret and semi-secret volumes, detailing the lives of great S=
ages. Many of the=20

statements in them are purposely confused, and in others the reader becomes=
 bewildered, unless=20

a clue be given him, by the head."  "Yes, count, it is a strange thing and =
one which might astonish=20

you, but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man. Have yo=
u ever seen a snake rise=20

up on your path?"  "Never," answered De Guiche.  "Well, it has happened to =
me to do so in our=20

Blaisois forests, and I remember that the first time I encountered one with=
 its eyes fixed upon me,=20

curled up, swinging its head and pointing its tongue, I remained fixed, pal=
e and as though=20

fascinated, until the moment when the Comte de la Fere----"  "Your father?"=
 asked De Guiche.=20

cover many individuals who follow the same line of teaching. Thus there is =
a succession of "living=20

Buddhas'" and the name "Buddha" is given to teacher after teacher. Schlagin=
tweit writes:       To=20

each human Buddha belongs a Dhyani-Buddha, and a Dhyani-     Bodhisattva, a=
nd the unlimited=20

number of the former also involves     an equally unlimited number of the l=
atter.(680)   [But if this=20

be so--and the exoteric and semi-exoteric use of the name justify the state=
ment--the reader must=20

depend on his own intuition  "Very well----"  "Until the moment when the Co=

resumed Raoul, "said, 'Come, Bragelonne, draw your sword;' then only I rush=

and cut it in two, just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hi=
ssing, ere it sprang upon=20

me. Well, I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when=
 he said, 'Why do you=20

ask me that?' and looked so strangely at me."  "Then you regret that you di=

in two morsels?"  "Faith, yes, almost," said Raoul.  They had=20
