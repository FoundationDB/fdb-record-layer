you can no more tie him up than you can tie up a sunbeam. You could keep hi=

you, of course, when he was small. But he's bound to grow away from you as =
he gets bigger, just=20

as I grew away from my mother and you once grew away from yours. It's a nat=
ural law, and there's=20

no use crocking your knees on it. The boy's got his own life to live, and y=
ou can't live it for him. It=20

won't be long, now, before you begin to notice those quiet withdrawals, tho=
se slippings-back into=20

his own shell of self-interest. And unless you realize what it means, it's =
going to hurt. And unless=20

you reckon on that in the way you order your life you're not only going to =
be a very lonely old lady=20

but you're going to bump into a big hole where you thought the going was sm=
oothest!"  I sat=20

thinking this over, with a ton of lead where my heart should have been.  "I=
've already bumped into=20

a big hole where I thought the going was smoothest," I finally observed.  M=
y husband looked at me=20

and then looked away again.  "I was hoping we could fill that up and forget=
 it," he ventured in a=20

valorously timid tone which made it hard, for reasons I couldn't quite fath=
om, to keep my throat=20

from tightening. But I sat there, shaking my head from side to side.  "I've=
 got to love something," I=20

found myself protesting. "And the children seem all that is left."  "How ab=
out me?" asked my=20

husband, with his acidulated and slightly one-sided smile.  "You've changed=
, Dinky-Dunk," was all=20

I could say.  "But some day," he contended, "you may wake up to the fact th=
at I'm still a human=20

being."  "I've wakened up to the fact that you're a different sort of human=
 being than I had=20

thought."  "Oh, we're all very much alike, once you get our number," assert=
ed my husband.  "You=20

mean men are," I amended.  "I mean that if men can't get a little warmth an=
d color and sympathy=20

in the home-circle they're going to edge about until they find a substitute=
 for it, no matter how=20

shoddy it may be," contended Dinky-Dunk.  "But isn't that a hard and bitter=
 way of writing life down=20

to one's own level?" I asked, trying to swallow the choke that wouldn't sta=
y down in my throat.=20

"Well, I can't see that we get much ahead by trying to sentimentalize the s=
ituation," he said, with a=20

gesture that seemed one of frustration.  We sat staring at each other, and =
again I had the feeling=20

of abysmal gulfs of space intervening between us.  "Is that all you can say=
 about it?" I asked, with=20

a foolish little gulp I couldn't control.  "Isn't it enough?" demanded Dink=
y-Dunk. And I knew that=20

nothing was to be gained, that night, by the foolish and futile clash of wo=
rds.     _Tuesday the=20

Twenty-Third_   I've been doing a good deal of thinking over what Dinky-Dun=
k said. I have been=20

trying to see things from his standpoint. By a sort of mental ju-jutsu I've=
 even been trying to justify=20

what I can't quite understand in him. But it's no use. There's one bald, ha=
rd fact I can't escape, no=20

matter how I dig my old ostrich-beak of instinct under the sands of self-de=
ception. There's one=20

cold-blooded truth that will have to be faced. _My husband is no longer in =
love with me._ Whatever=20

else may have happened, I have lost my heart-hold on Duncan Argyll McKail. =
I am still his wife, in=20

the eyes of the law, and the mother of his children. We still live together=
, and, from force of habit, if=20

from nothing else, go through the familiar old rites of daily communion. He=
 sits across the table=20

from me when I eat, and talks casually enough of the trivially momentous pr=
oblems of the minute,=20

or he reads in his slippers before the fire while I do my sewing within a s=
pool-toss of him. But a=20

row of invisible assegais stand leveled between his heart and mine. A slow =
glacier of green-iced=20

indifferency shoulders in between us; and gone forever is the wild-flower a=
roma of youth, the=20

singing spirit of April, the mysterious light that touched our world with w=
onder. He is merely a man,=20

drawing on to middle age, and I am a woman, no longer young. Gone now are t=
he spring floods=20



that once swept us together. Gone now is the flame of adoration that burned=
 clean our altar of=20

daily intercourse and left us blind to the weaknesses we were too happy to =
remember. For there=20

was a time when we loved each other. I know that as well as Duncan does. Bu=
t it died away, that=20

ghostly flame. It went out like a neglected fire. And blowing on dead ashes=
 can never revive the=20

old-time glow.  "So they were married and lived happy ever afterward!" That=
 is the familiar ending=20

to the fairy-tales I read over and over again to my Dinkie and Poppsy. But =
they are fairy-tales. For=20

who lives happy ever afterward? First love chloroforms us, for a time, and =
we try to hug to our=20

bosoms the illusion that Heaven itself is only a sort of endless honeymoon =
presided over by=20

Lohengrin marches. But the anesthetic wears away and we find that life isn'=
t a bed of roses but a=20

rough field that rewards us as we till it, with here and there the cornflow=
er of happiness laughing=20

unexpectedly up at us out of our sober acres of sober wheat. And often enou=
gh we don't know=20

happiness when we see it. We assuredly find it least where we look for it m=
ost. I can't even=20

understand why we're equipped with such a hunger for it. But I find myself =
trending more and=20

more to that cynic philosophy which defines happiness as the absence of pai=
n. The absence of=20

pain--that is a lot to ask for, in this life!  I wonder if Dinky-Dunk is ri=
ght in his implication that I am=20

getting hard? There are times, I know, when I grate on him, when he would p=
robably give anything=20

to get away from me. Yet here we are, linked together like two convicts. An=
d I don't believe I'm as=20

hard as my husband accuses me of being. However macadamized they may have m=
ade life for=20

me, there's at least one soft spot in my heart, one garden under the walls =
of granite. And that's the=20

spot which my two children fill, which my children keep green, which my chi=
ldren keep holy. It's=20

them I think of, when I think of the future--when I should at least be thin=
king a little of my grammar=20

and remembering that the verb "to be" takes the nominative, just as discont=
ented husbands seem=20

to take the initiative! That's why I can't quite find the courage to ask fo=
r freedom. I have seen=20

enough of life to know what the smash-up of a family means to its toddlers.=
 And I want my children=20

to have a chance. They can't have that chance without at least two things. =
One is the guardianship=20

of home life, and the other is that curse of modern times known as money. W=
e haven't prospered=20

as we had hoped to, but heaven knows I've kept an eagle eye on that savings=
-account of mine, in=20

that absurdly new and resplendent red-brick bank in Buckhorn. Patiently I'v=
e fed it with my butter=20

and egg money, joyfully I've seen it grow with my meager Nitrate dividends,=
 and grimly I've made it=20

bigger with every loose dollar I could lay my hands on. There's no heroism =
in my going without=20

things I may have thought I needed, just as there can be little nobility in=
 my sticking to a husband=20

who no longer loves me. For it's not Chaddie McKail who counts now, but her=
 chicks. And I'll have=20

to look for my reward through them, for I'm like Romanes' rat now, too big =
to get into the bottle of=20

cream, but wary enough to know I can dine from a tail still small enough fo=
r insertion. I'm merely a=20

submerged prairie-hen with the best part of her life behind her.  But it bo=
thers me, what Duncan=20

says about my always thinking of little Dinkie first. And I'm afraid I do, =
though it seems neither right=20

nor fair. I suppose it's because he was my first-born--and having come firs=
t in my life he must=20

come first in my thoughts. I was made to love somebody--and my husband does=
n't seem to want=20

me to love him. So he has driven me to centering my thoughts on the child. =
I've got to have=20

something to warm up to. And any love I may lavish on this prairie-chick of=
 mine, who has to face=20

life with the lack of so many things, will not only be a help to the boy, b=
ut will be a help to me, the=20

part of Me that I'm sometimes so terribly afraid of.  Yet I can't help wond=
ering if Duncan has any=20



excuses for claiming that it's personal selfishness which prompts me to kee=
p my boy close to my=20

side. And am I harming him, without knowing it, in keeping him here under m=
y wing? Schools are=20

all difficulty of those sacrifices will perhaps hereafter be explained by t=
hose who knew the secret of=20

the political circumstances and the personal character of the men with whom=
 he was brought in=20

contact; and who would not think of weighing imponderable sacrifices on the=
 balance of vulgar=20

gain.  "The man whose feelings for his own country rested on so firm a foun=
dation could not be=20

dishonest or unfair towards foreign countries. The same right understanding=
, fairness, and=20

moderation, which he evinced in his treatment of internal affairs, guided P=
eel in his treatment of all=20

foreign questions. The wish frequently expressed by him, to see the welfare=
 of all nations=20

improved, was thoroughly sincere. He knew France and Italy from his own obs=
ervation, and he=20

had studied the political history of the former with great industry. For Ge=
rmany he had a good will,=20

nay, a predilection, particularly for Prussia.  "In his private life, Peel =
was a real pattern. He was the=20

most loving, faithful, conscientious husband, father, and brother, unchangi=
ng and indulgent to his=20

friends, and always ready to help his fellow-citizens according to his powe=
r.  "Of the vulnerable=20

parts of his character his enemies may have many things to tell. What had b=
een observed by all=20

who came into closer contact with him, could not escape my own observation.=
 I mean his too great=20

prudence, caution, and at times, extreme reserve, in important as well as i=
n unimportant matters,=20

which he showed, not only towards more distant, but even towards his nearer=
 acquaintances. If he=20

was but too often sparing of words, and timidly cautious in oral transactio=
ns, he was naturally still=20

more so in his written communications. The fear never left him that he migh=
t have to hear an=20

opinion once expressed, or a, judgment once uttered by him, repeated by the=
 wrong man, and in=20

the wrong place, and misapplied. His friends were sometimes in despair over=
 this peculiarity. To=20

his opponents it supplied an apparent ground for suspicion and incriminatio=
n. It seemed but too=20

likely that there was a doubtful motive for such reserve, or that it was in=
tended to cover=20

narrowness and weakness of thought and feeling, or want of enterprise and c=
ourage. To me also=20

this peculiarity deemed often injurious to himself and to the matter in han=
d; and I could not help=20

being sometimes put out by it, and wishing from the bottom of my heart that=
 he could have got rid=20

of it. But when one came to weigh the acts of the man against his manner, t=
he disagreeable=20

impression soon gave way. I quickly convinced myself, that this, to me, so =
objectionable a trait=20

was but an innate peculiarity; and that in a sphere of activity where thoug=
htless unreserve and=20

_laisser aller_ showed themselves in every possible form, Peel was not like=
ly to find any incentive,=20

or to form a resolution to overcome, in this point, his natural disposition=
.  "I have been told, or I=20

have read it somewhere, that Peel was the most successful type of political=
 mediocrity. In=20

accepting this estimate of my departed friend as perfectly true, I ask Heav=
en to relieve all=20

Ministers, within and without Europe, of their superiority, and to endow th=
em with Peel's=20

mediocrity: and I ask this for the welfare of all nations, and in the firm =
conviction that ninety-nine=20

hundredths of the higher political affairs can be properly and successfully=
 conducted by such=20

Ministers only as possess Peel's mediocrity: though I am willing to admit t=
hat the remaining=20

hundredth may, through the power and boldness of a true genius, be brought =
to a particularly=20

happy, or, it may be, to a particularly unhappy, issue."  Of the late Lord =
Derby, on the other hand,=20

Stockmar speaks with the greatest contempt, calling him "a frivolous aristo=
crat who delighted in=20

making mischief. "It does not appear whether the two men ever came into col=
lision with each=20



other, but if they did, Lord Derby was likely enough to leave a sting.  Sto=
ckmar regularly spent a=20

great part of each year with the English Royal Family. Apartments were appr=
opriated to him in=20

each of the Royal residences, and he lived with the Queen and Prince on the=
 footing of an=20

intimate, or rather of a member, and almost the father, of the family. Inde=
ed, he used a familiarity=20

beyond that of any friend or relative. Having an objection to taking leave,=
 he was in the habit of=20

disappearing without notice, and leaving his rooms vacant when the fancy to=
ok him. Then we are=20

told, letters complaining of his faithlessness would follow him, and in cou=
rse of time others urging=20

his return. Etiquette, the highest of all laws, was dispensed within his ca=
se. After dining with the=20

Queen, when Her Majesty had risen from table, and after holding a circle ha=
d sat down again to=20

tea, Stockmar would generally be seen walking straight through the drawing-=
room and returning to=20

his apartment, there to study his own comfort. More than this, when Mordeca=
i became the King's=20

favorite, he was led forth on the royal steed, apparelled in the royal robe=
, and with the royal crown=20

upon his head. A less demonstrative and picturesque, but not less signal or=
 significant, mark of=20

Royal favor was bestowed on Stockmar. In his case tights were dispensed wit=
h, and he was=20

allowed to wear trousers, which better suited his thin legs. We believe thi=
s exemption to be without=20

parallel, though we have heard of a single dispensation being granted, afte=
r many searchings of=20

heart, in a case where the invitation had been sudden, and the mystic garme=
nt did not exist, and=20

also of a more melancholy case, in which the garment was split in rushing d=
own to dinner, and its=20

wearer was compelled to appear in the forbidden trousers, and very late, wi=
thout the possibility of=20

explaining what had occurred.  Notwithstanding the enormous power indicated=
 by his privileged=20

nether limbs, Stockmar remained disinterested. A rich Englishman, described=
 as an author, and=20

member of Parliament, called upon him one day, and promised to give him L10=
,000 if he would=20

further his petition to the Queen for a peerage. Stockmar replied, "I will =
now go into the next room,=20

in order to give you time. If upon my return I still find you here, I shall=
 have you turned out by the=20

servants."  We are told that the Baron had little intercourse with any circ=
les but those of the court--

a circumstance which was not likely to diminish any bad impressions that mi=
ght prevail with regard=20

to his secret influence. Among his intimate friends in the household was hi=
s fellow-countryman Dr.=20

Pratorius, "who ever zealously strengthened the Prince's inclinations in th=
e sense which Stockmar=20

desired, and always insisted upon the highest moral considerations." Nature=
, in the case of the=20

doctor; had not been so lavish of personal beauty as of moral endowments. T=
he Queen was once=20

reading the Bible with her daughter, the little Princess Victoria. They cam=
e to the passage, "God=20

created man in his own image, in the image of God created He him." "O Mamma=
," cried the=20

Princess, "not Dr. Pratorius!"  Stockmar's administrative genius effected a=
 reform in the Royal=20

household, and as appears from his memorandum, not before there was occasio=
n for it. "The=20

housekeepers, pages, housemaids, etc., are under the authority of the Lord =
Chamberlain; all the=20

footmen, livery-porters and under-butlers, by the strangest anomaly, under =
that of Master of the=20

Horse, at whose office they are clothed and paid; and the rest of the serva=
nts, such as the clerk of=20

the kitchen, the cooks, the porters, etc., are under the jurisdiction of th=
e Lord Steward. Yet these=20

ludicrous divisions extend not only to persons, but likewise to things and =
actions. The Lord=20

Steward, for example, finds the fuel and lays the fire, and the Lord Chambe=
rlain lights it. It was=20

under this state of things that the writer of this paper, having been sent =
one day by Her present=20

Majesty to Sir Frederick Watson, then the Master of the Household, to compl=
ain that the dining-



room was always cold, was gravely answered: 'You see, properly speaking, it=
 is not our fault, for=20

the Lord Steward lays the fire only, and the Lord Chamberlain lights it.' I=
n the same manner the=20

Lord Chamberlain provides all the lamps, and the Lord Steward must clean, t=
rim and light them. If=20

a pane of glass or the door in a cupboard in the scullery requires mending,=
 it cannot now be done=20

without the following process: A requisition is prepared and signed by the =
chief cook, it is then=20


_
mother can do as much in the molding of a boy's mind as a boarding-school w=
ith a file of Ph.D.'s=20

on its staff. But am I a good mother? And should I trust myself, in a matte=
r like this, to my own=20

feelings? Men, in so many things, are better judges than women. Yet it has =
just occurred to me=20

that all men do not think alike. I've been sitting back and wondering what =
kindly old Peter would=20

say about it. And I've decided to write Peter and ask what he advises. He'l=
l tell the truth, I know, for=20

Peter is as honest as the day is long....  I've just been up to make sure t=
he children were properly=20

covered in bed. And it disturbed me a little to find that without even thin=
king about it I went to=20

Dinkie first. It seemed like accidental corroboration of all that Duncan ha=
s been saying. But I stood=20

studying him as he lay there asleep. It frightened me a little, to find him=
 so big. If it's true, as=20

Duncan threatens, that time will tend to turn him away from me, it's someth=
ing that I'm going to=20

fight tooth and nail. And I've seen no sign of it, as yet. With every month=
 and every year that's=20

added to his age he grows more companionable, more able to bridge the chasm=
 between two=20

human souls. We have more interests in common, more things to talk about. A=
nd day by day=20

Dinkie is reaching up to my clumsily mature way of looking at life. He can =
come to me with his=20

problems, knowing I'll always give him a hearing, just as he used to come t=
o me with his baby cuts=20

and bruises, knowing they would be duly kissed and cared for. Yet some day,=
 I have just=20

remembered, he may have problems that can't be brought to me. But that day,=
 please God, I shall=20

defer as long as possible. Already we have our own little secrets and priva=
te compacts and=20

understandings. I don't want my boy to be a mollycoddle. But I want him to =
have his chance in the=20

world. I want him to be somebody. I can't reconcile myself to the thought o=
f him growing up to=20

wear moose-mittens and shoe-packs and stretching barb-wire in blue-jeans an=
d riding a tractor=20

across a prairie back-township. I refuse to picture him getting bent and gr=
ay wringing a livelihood=20

out of an over-cropped ranch fourteen miles away from a post-office and a w=
orld away from the=20

things that make life most worth living. If he were an ordinary boy, I migh=
t be led to think=20

differently. But my Dinkie is not an ordinary boy. There's a spark of the u=
nusual, of the exceptional,=20

in that laddie. And I intend to fan that spark, whatever the cost may be, u=
ntil it breaks out into=20

genius.     _Sunday the Twenty-Eighth_   I've had scant time for introspect=
ion during the last five=20

days, for Struthers has been in bed with lumbago, and the weight of the hou=
sework reverted to=20

me. But Whinstane Sandy brought his precious bottle of Universal Ointment i=
n from the bunk-

house, and while that fiery mixture warmed her lame back, the thought of it=
s origin probably=20

warmed her lonely heart. I have suddenly wakened up to the fact that Struth=
ers is getting on a bit.=20

She is still the same efficient and self-obliterating mainstay of the kitch=
en that she ever was, but=20

she grows more "sot" in her ways, more averse to any change in her daily ro=
utine, and more=20

despairing of ever finally and completely capturing that canny old Scotsman=
 whom we still so=20

affectionately designate as Whinnie, in short for Whinstane Sandy. Whinnie,=
 I'm afraid, still nurses=20

the fixed idea that everything in petticoats and as yet unwedded is after h=
im. And it is only by=20

walking with the utmost circumspection that he escapes their wiles and by m=
aintaining an=20

unbroken front withstands their unseemly advances.  The new school-teacher =
has arrived, and is=20

to live with us here at Casa Grande. I have my reasons for this. In the fir=
st place, it will be a help to=20

Dinkie in his studies. In the second place, it means that the teacher can p=
ack my boy back and=20

forth to school, in bad weather, and next month when Poppsy joins the ranks=
 of the learners, can=20

keep a more personal eye on that little tot's movements. And in the third p=
lace the mere presence=20



of another male at Casa Grande seems to dilute the acids of home life.  Ger=
shom Binks is the=20

name of this new teacher, and I have just learned that in the original Hebr=
ew "Gershom" not=20

inappropriately means "a stranger there." He is a sophomore (a most excelle=
nt word, that, when=20

you come to inquire into its etymology!) from the University of Minnesota a=
nd is compelled to teach=20

the young idea, for a time, to accumulate sufficient funds to complete his =
course, which he wants=20

to do at Ann Arbor. And Gershom is a very tall and very thin and very short=
-sighted young man,=20

with an Adam's apple that works up and down with a two-inch plunge over the=
 edge of his collar=20

when he talks--which he does somewhat extensively. He wears glasses with bi=
g bulging lenses,=20

glasses which tend to hide a pair of timid and brown-October-aleish eyes wi=
th real kindliness in=20

them. He looks ill-nourished, but I can detect nothing radically wrong with=
 his appetite. It's merely=20

that, like Cassius, he thinks too much. And I'm going to fatten that boy up=
 a bit, before the year is=20

out, or know the reason why. He may be a trifle self-conscious and awkward,=
 but he's also=20

amazingly clean of both body and mind, and it will be no hardship, I know, =
to have him under our=20

roof. And for all his devotion to Science, he reads his Bible every night--=
which is more than=20

Chaddie McKail does! He rather took the wind out of my sails by demanding, =
the first morning at=20

breakfast, if I knew that one half-ounce of the web of the spider--the arac=
hnid of the order=20

_Araneida_, he explained--if stretched out in a straight line would reach f=
rom the city of Chicago to=20

the city of Paris. I told him that this was a most wonderful and a most int=
eresting piece of=20

information and hoped that some day we could verify it by actual test. Yet =
when I inquired whether=20

he meant merely the environs of the city of Paris, or the very heart of the=
 city such as the Place de=20

l'Opera, he studied me with the meditative eye with which Huxley must have =
once studied beetles.=20

Dinky-Dunk, I notice, is as restive as a bull-moose in black-fly season. He=
's doing his work on the=20

land, as about every ranch-owner has to, whether he's happily married or no=
t, but he's doing it=20

without any undue impression of its epical importance. I heard him observe,=
 yesterday, that if he=20

could only get his hands on enough ready money he'd like to swing into land=
 business in a live=20

center like Calgary. He has a friend there, apparently, who has just made a=
 clean-up in city real=20

estate and bought his wife a Detroit Electric and built a home for himself =
that cost forty thousand=20

dollars. I reminded Dinky-Dunk, when he had finished, that we really must h=
ave a new straining-

mesh in the milk-separator. He merely looked at me with a sour and morose e=
ye as he got up and=20

went out to his team.  Surely these men-folks are a dissatisfied lot! Gersh=
om to-night complained=20

that his own name of "Gershom Binks" impressed him as about the ugliest nam=
e that was ever=20

hitched on to a scholar and a gentlemen. And later on, after I'd opened my =
piano and tried to=20

console myself with a tu'penny draught of Grieg, he inspected the instrumen=
t and informed me=20

that it was really evolved from the six-stringed harps of the fourth Egypti=
an dynasty, which in the=20

fifth dynasty was made with a greatly enlarged base, thus giving the rudime=
ntary beginning of a=20

soundboard.  I am learning a lot from Gershom! And so are my kiddies, for t=
hat matter. I begin, in=20

fact, to feel like royalty with a private tutor, for every night now Dinkie=
 and Poppsy and Gershom sit=20

about the living-room table and drink of the founts of wisdom. But we have =
a teacher here who=20

loves to teach. And he is infinitely patient and kind with my little toddle=
rs. Dinkie already asks him=20

questions without number, while Poppsy gratefully but decorously vamps him =
with her infantine=20

gazes. Then Gershom--Heaven bless his scholastic old high-browed solemnity-=
-has just assured=20

me that Dinkie betrays many evidences of an exceptionally bright mind.     =
_Friday the Second_=20



My then it is taken to be signed by the Master of the Household, thence it =
is taken to the Lord=20

Chamberlain's office, where it is authorized, and then laid before the Cler=
k of the Works under the=20

office of Woods and Forests; and consequently many a window and cupboard ha=
ve remained=20

broken for months" Worse than this--"There is no one who attends to the com=
forts of the Queen's=20

guests on their arrival at the Royal residence. When they arrive at present=
 there is no one=20

prepared to show them to or from their apartments; there is no gentleman in=
 the palace who even=20

knows where they are lodged, and there is not even a servant who can perfor=
m this duty, which is=20

attached to the Lord Chamberlain's department. It frequently happens at Win=
dsor that some of the=20

visitors are at a loss to find the drawing-room, and, at night, if they hap=
pen to forget the right=20

entrance from the corridor, they wander for an hour helpless, and unassiste=
d. There is nobody to=20

apply to in such a case, for it is not in the department of the Master of t=
he Household, and the only=20

remedy is to send a servant, if one can be found, to the porter's lodge, to=
 ascertain the apartment=20

in question." People were rather surprised when the boy Jones was discovere=
d, at one o'clock in=20

the morning, under the sofa in the room adjoining Her Majesty's bedroom. Bu=
t it seems nobody=20

was responsible--not the Lord Chamberlain, who was in Staffordshire, and in=
 whose department=20

the porters were not; not the Lord Steward, who was in London, and had noth=
ing to do with the=20

pages and attendants nearest to the royal person; not the Master of the Hou=
sehold, who was only=20

a subordinate officer in the Lord Steward's department. So the King of Spai=
n, who was roasted to=20

death because the right Lord-in-Waiting could not be found to take him from=
 the fire, was not=20

without a parallel in that which calls itself the most practical of nations=
. Stockmar reformed the=20

system by simply inducing each of the three great officers, without nominal=
ly giving up his=20

authority (which would have shaken the foundations of the Monarchy), to del=
egate so much of it as=20

would enable the fire to be laid and lighted by the same power. We fancy, h=
owever, that even=20

since the Stockmarian reconstruction, we have heard of guests finding thems=
elves adrift in the=20

corridors of Windsor. There used to be no bells to the rooms, it being assu=
med that in the abode of=20

Royalty servants, were always within call, a theory which would have been f=
ull of comfort to any=20

nervous gentleman, who, on the approach of the royal dinner hour, might hap=
pen to find himself=20

left with somebody else's small clothes.  In 1854 came the outbreak of publ=
ic feeling against=20

Prince Albert and Stockmar, as his friend and adviser, to which we have ref=
erred at the beginning=20

of this article. The Prince's lamented death caused such a reaction of feel=
ing in his favor that it is=20

difficult now to recall to recollection the degree of unpopularity under wh=
ich he at one time=20

laboured. Some of the causes of this unpopularity are correctly stated by t=
he author of the present=20

memoir. The Prince was a foreigner, his ways were not those of Englishmen, =
he did not dress like=20

an Englishman, shake hands like an Englishman. He was suspected of "Germani=
zing" tendencies,=20

very offensive to high churchmen, especially in philosophy and religion. He=
 displeased the=20

Conservatives by his Liberalism, the coarser Radicals by his pietism and cu=
lture. He displeased=20

the fast set by his strict morality; they called him slow, because he did n=
ot bet, gamble, use bad=20

language, keep an opera dancer. With more reason he displeased the army by =
meddling, under=20

the name of a too courtly Commander-in-Chief, with professional matters whi=
ch he could not=20

understand. But there was a cause of his unpopularity scarcely appreciable =
by the German author=20

of this memoir. He had brought with him the condescending manner of a Germa=
n Prince. The=20

English prefer a frank manner; they will bear a high manner in persons of s=
ufficient rank, but a=20



condescending manner they will not endure; nor will any man or woman but th=
ose who live in a=20

German Court. So it was, however, that the Prince, during his life, though =
respected by the people=20

for his virtues, and by men of intellect for his culture, was disliked and =
disparaged by "Society,"=20

and especially by the great ladies who are at the head of it. The Conservat=
ives, male and female,=20

had a further grudge against him as the reputed friend of Peel, who was the=
 object of their almost=20

demoniac hatred.  The part of a Prince Consort is a very difficult one to p=
lay. In the case of Queen=20

Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark, nature solved the difficulty by n=
ot encumbering his=20

Royal Highness with any brains. But Prince Albert had brains, and it was mo=
rally impossible that=20

he should not exercise a power not contemplated by the Constitution. He did=
 so almost from the=20

first, with the full knowledge and approbation of the Ministers, who had no=
 doubt the sense to see=20

what could not be avoided had better be recognised and kept under control. =
But in 1851 the Court=20

quarrelled with Palmerston, who was dismissed from office, very properly, f=
or having, in direct=20

violation of a recent order of the Queen, communicated to the French Ambass=
ador his approval of=20

the coup d'etat, without the knowledge of Her Majesty or the Cabinet. In 18=
54 came the rupture=20

with Russia, which led to the Crimean war. Palmerston, in correspondence wi=
th his friend the=20

French Emperor, was working for a war, with a separate French alliance. Pri=
nce Albert, in=20

conjunction with Aberdeen, was trying to keep the Four Powers together, and=
 by their combined=20

action to avert a war. Palmerston and his partizans appealed through the pr=
ess to the people,=20

among whom the war feeling was growing strong, against the unconstitutional=
 influence of the=20

Prince Consort and his foreign advisers. Thereupon arose a storm of insane =
suspicion and fury=20

which almost recalled the fever of the Popish Plot. Thousands of Londoners =
collected round the=20

Tower to see the Prince's entry into the State Prison, and dispersed only u=
pon being told that the=20

Queen had said that if her husband was sent to prison she would go with him=
. Reports were=20

circulated of a pamphlet drawn up under Palmerston's eye, and containing th=
e most damning=20

proofs of the Prince's guilt, the publication of which it was said the Prin=
ce had managed to prevent,=20

but of which six copies were still in existence. The pamphlet was at last p=
rinted _in extenso_ in the=20

_Times_, and the bottled lightning proved to be ditchwater. Of course Stock=
mar, the "spy," the=20

"agent of Leopold," did not escape denunciation, and though it was proved h=
e had been at Coburg=20

all the time, people persisted in believing he was concealed about the Cour=
t, coming out only at=20

night. The outcry was led by the _Morning Post_, Lord Palmerston's personal=
 organ, and the=20

_Morning Advertiser_, the bellicose and truly British journal of the Licens=
ed Victuallers; but these=20

were supported by the Conservative press, and by some Radical papers. A deb=
ate in Parliament=20

broke the waterspout as quickly as it had been formed. The people had compl=
ained with=20

transports of rage that the Prince Consort exercised an influence unrecogni=
sed by the Constitution=20

in affairs of State. They were officially assured that he _did_; and they a=
t once declared=20

themselves perfectly satisfied.  Our readers would not thank us for taking =
them again through the=20

question of the Spanish marriages, a transaction which Stockmar viewed in t=
he only way in which=20

the most criminal and the filthiest of intrigues could be viewed by an hone=
st man and a gentleman;=20

or through the question of German unity, on which his opinions have been at=
 once ratified and=20

deprived of their practical interest by events. The last part of his life h=
e passed in Germany,=20

managing German Royalties, especially the Prince and Princess Frederick Wil=
liam of Prussia, for=20

whom he had conceived a profound affection. His presence, we are told, was =
regarded by German=20



statesmen and magnates as "uncanny," and Count K., on being told that it wa=
s=20


_
harping on the city string again and asked me if I intended to live and die=
 a withered beauty on a=20

back-trail ranch.  That "withered beauty" hurt, though I did my best to ign=
ore it, for the time at least.=20

And Dinky-Dunk went on to say that it struck him as one of life's little ir=
onies that _I_ should want=20

to stick to the sort of life we were leading, remembering what I'd come fro=
m.  "Dinky-Dunk," I told=20

him, "it's terribly hard to explain exactly how I feel about it all. I supp=
ose I could never make you=20

see it as I see it. But it's a feeling like loyalty, loyalty to the land th=
at's given us what we have. And=20

it's also a feeling of disliking to see one old rule repeating itself: what=
 has once been a crusade=20

becoming merely a business. To turn and leave our land now, it seems to me,=
 would make us too=20

much like those soulless soil-robbers you used to rail at, like those squat=
ters who've merely=20

squeezed out what they could and have gone on, like those land-miners who t=
ake all they can get=20

and stand ready to put nothing back. Why, if we were all like that, we'd ha=
ve no country here. We'd=20

be a wilderness, a Barren Grounds that went from the Border up to the Circl=
e. But there's=20

something bigger than that about it all. I love the prairie. Just why it is=
, I don't know. It's too=20

fundamental to be fashioned into words, and I never realized how deep it wa=
s until I went back to=20

the city that time. One can just say it, and let it go at that: _I love the=
 prairie._ It isn't merely its=20

bigness, just as it isn't altogether its freedom and its openness. Perhaps =
it's because it keeps its=20

spirit of the adventurous. I love it the same as my children love _The Arab=
ian Nights_ and _The=20

Swiss Family Robinson_. I thought it was mostly cant, once, that cry about =
being next to nature,=20

but the more I know about nature the more I feel with Pope that naught but =
man is vile, to speak=20

as impersonally, my dear Diddums, as the occasion will permit. I'm afraid I=
'm like that chickadee=20

that flew into the bunk-house and Whinnie caught and put in a box-cage for =
Dinkie. I nearly die at=20

the thought of being cooped up. I want clean air and open space about me." =
 "I never dreamed=20

you'd been Indianized to that extent," murmured my husband.  "Being Indiani=
zed," I proceeded,=20

"seems to carry the inference of also being barbarized. But it isn't quite =
that, Dinky-Dunk, for=20

there's something almost spiritually satisfying about this prairie life if =
you've only got the eyes to=20

see it. I think that's because the prairie always seems so majestically bea=
utiful to me. I can see=20

your lip curl again, but I know I'm right. When I throw open my windows of =
a morning and see that=20

placid old never-ending plain under its great wash of light something lifts=
 up in my breast, like a=20

bird, and no matter how a mere man has been doing his best to make me miser=
able that=20

something stands up on the tip of my heart and does its darnedest to sing. =
It impresses me as life=20

on such a sane and gigantic scale that I want to be an actual part of it, t=
hat I positively ache to=20

have a share in its immensities. It seems so fruitful and prodigal and gene=
rous and patient. It's so=20

open-handed in the way it produces and gives and returns our love. And ther=
e's a completeness=20

about it that makes me feel it can't possibly be wrong."  "The Eskimo, I su=
ppose, feels very much=20

the same in his little igloo of ice with a pot of whale-blubber at his elbo=
w," observed my husband.=20

"You're a brute, my dear Diddums, and more casually cruel than a Baffin-lan=
d cannibal," I retorted.=20

"But we'll let it pass. For I'm talking about something that's too fundamen=
tal to be upset by a bitter=20

tongue. There was a time, I know, when I used to fret about the finer thing=
s I thought I was losing=20

out of life, about the little hand-made fripperies people have been forced =
to conjure up and=20

carpenter together to console them for having to live in human beehives mad=
e of steel and=20

concrete. But I'm beginning to find out that joy isn't a matter of geograph=
y and companionship isn't=20

a matter of over-crowded subways. And the strap-hangers and the train-catch=
ers and the first-



nighters can have what they've got. I don't seem to envy them the way I use=
d to. I don't need a=20

Louvre when I've got the Northern Lights to look at. And I can get along wi=
thout an AEolian Hall=20

when I've got a little music in my own heart--for it's only what you've got=
 there, after all, that just=20

crossed a bridge, asked the acquaintance why he had not pitched the Baron i=
nto the river. That=20

Stockmar did not deserve such a fate, the testimony cited at the beginning =
of this paper is=20

sufficient to prove. He was the unrecognised Minister of Constitutional Sov=
ereigns who wanted,=20

besides their regular Parliamentary advisers, a personal adviser to attend =
to the special interests=20

of royalty. It was a part somewhat clandestine, rather equivocal, and not e=
xactly such as a very=20

proud man would choose. But Stockmar was called to it by circumstances, he =
was admirably=20

adapted for it, and if it sometimes led him further than he was entitled or=
 qualified to go, he played=20

it on the whole very well.     THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CONQUEROR OF QUEBEC  =
 A=20

discussion which was raised some time ago by a very pleasant article of Pro=
fessor Wilson in the=20

_Canadian Monthly_ disclosed the fact that Wright's "Life of Wolfe," though=
 it had been published=20

some years, was still very little known. It is not only the best but the on=
ly complete life of the=20

soldier, so memorable in Canadian annals, whom Chatham's hand launched on o=
ur coast, a=20

thunderbolt of war, and whose victory decided that the destiny of this land=
 of great possibilities=20

should be shaped not by French but by British hands. Almost all that is kno=
wn about Wolfe is here,=20

and it is well told. Perhaps the biographer might have enhanced the interes=
t of the figure by a=20

more vivid presentation of its historic surroundings. It is when viewed in =
comparison with an age=20

which was generally one of unbelief, of low aims, of hearts hardened by vic=
e, of blunted affections,=20

of coarse excesses, and in the military sphere one of excesses more than us=
ually coarse, of=20

professional ignorance and neglect of duty among the officers, while the ha=
bits of the rank and file=20

were those depicted in Hogarth's _March to Finckley_ that the life of this =
aspiring, gentle,=20

affectionate, pure and conscientious soldier shines forth against the dark =
background like a star.=20

Squerryes Court, near Westerham, in Kent, is an ample and pleasant mansion =
in the Queen Anne=20

style, which has long been in the possession of the Warde family--they are =
very particular about=20

the _e_. In later times it was the abode of a memorable character in his wa=
y--old John Warde, the=20

"Father of Fox-hunting." There it was that the greatest of all fox-hunters,=
 Asheton Smithe, when on=20

a visit to John Warde, rode Warde's horse _Blue Ruin_ over a frozen country=
 through a fast run of=20

twenty-five minutes and killed his fox. On the terrace stands a monument. I=
t marks the spot where=20

in 1741, James Wolfe, the son of Lieut-Col. Wolfe, of Westerham, then barel=
y fourteen years of=20

age, was playing with two young Wardes, when the father of the playmates ap=
proached and=20

handed him a large letter "On His Majesty's Service" which, on being opened=
, was found to=20

contain his commission in the army. We may be sure that the young face flus=
hed with undisguised=20

emotion. There cannot be a greater contrast than that which the frank, impu=
lsive features,=20

sanguine complexion, and blue eyes of Wolfe present to the power expressed =
in the commanding=20

brow, the settled look, and the evil eye [Footnote: The late Lord Russell, =
who had seen Napoleon=20

at Elba, used to say that there was something very evil in his eye.] of Nap=
oleon.  James Wolfe was=20

a delicate child, and though he grew energetic and fearless, never grew str=
ong, or ceased to merit=20

the interest which attaches to a gallant spirit in a weak frame. He escaped=
 a public school, and=20

without any forfeiture of the manliness which public schools are supposed e=
xclusively to produce,=20

retained his home affections and his tenderness of heart. He received the c=
hief part of his literary=20



education in a school at Greenwich, where his parents resided, and he at al=
l events learned=20

enough Latin to get himself a dinner, in his first campaign on the Continen=
t, by asking for it in that=20

language. He is grateful to his schoolmaster, Mr. Stebbings, and speaks of =
him with affection in=20

afterlife. But no doubt his military intelligence, as well as his military =
tastes, was gained by=20

intercourse with his father, a real soldier, who had pushed his way by meri=
t in an age of corrupt=20

patronage, and was Adjutant-General to Lord Cathcart's forces in 1740. Bred=
 in a home of military=20

duty, the young soldier saw before him a worthy example of conscientious at=
tention to all=20


_
"All of which means," concluded my husband, "that you are most unmistakably=
 growing old!"  "You=20

have already," I retorted, "referred to me as a withered beauty."  Dinky-Du=
nk studied me long and=20

intently. I even felt myself turning pink under that prolonged stare of app=
raisal.  "You are still easy=20

to look at," he over-slangily and over-generously admitted. "But I do regre=
t that you aren't a little=20

easier to live with!"  I could force a little laugh, at that, but I couldn'=
t quite keep a tremor out of my=20

voice when I spoke again.  "I'm sorry you see only my bad side, Dinky-Dunk.=
 But it's kindness that=20

seems to bring everything that is best out of us women. We're terribly like=
 sliced pineapple in that=20

respect: give us just a sprinkling of sugar, and out come all the juices!" =
 It was Dinky-Dunk's color=20

that deepened a little as he turned and knocked out his pipe.  "That's a Ch=
addie McKail=20

argument," he merely observed as he stood up. "And a Chaddie McKail argumen=
t impresses me=20

as suspiciously like Swiss cheese: it doesn't seem to be genuine unless you=
 can find plenty of=20

holes in it."  I did my best to smile at his humor.  "But this isn't an arg=
ument," I quietly corrected.=20

"I'd look at it more in the nature of an ultimatum."  That brought him up s=
hort, as I had intended it=20

to do. He stood worrying over it as Bobs and Scotty worry over a bone.  "I'=
m afraid," he finally=20

intoned, "I've been repeatedly doing you the great injustice of underestima=
ting your intelligence!"=20

"That," I told him, "is a point where I find silence imposed upon me."  He =
didn't speak until=20

profession--not only to the fighting of battles, but to the making of the s=
oldiers with whom battles=20

are to be fought.  Walpole's reign of peace was over, the "Patriots" had dr=
iven the nation into war,=20

and the trade of Colonel Wolfe and his son was again in request. Before he =
got his commission,=20

and when he was only thirteen years-and a-half old, the boy's ardent spirit=
 led him to embark with=20

his father as a volunteer in the ill-fated expedition to Carthagena. Happil=
y, though he assured his=20

mother that he was "in a very good state of health," his health was so far =
from being good that=20

they were obliged to put him on shore at Portsmouth. Thus he escaped that m=
asterpiece of the=20

military and naval administration of the aristocracy, to the horrors of whi=
ch his frail frame would=20

undoubtedly have succumbed. His father saw the unspeakable things depicted =
with ghastly=20

accuracy by Smollett, and warned his son never, if he could help it, to go =
on joint expeditions of=20

the two services--a precept which the soldier of an island power would have=
 found it difficult to=20

observe.  Wolfe's mother had struggled to prevent her boy from going, and a=
ppealed to his love of=20

her. It was a strong appeal, for he was the most dutiful of sons. The first=
 in the series of his letters=20

is one written to her on this occasion, assuring her of his affection and p=
romising to write to her by=20

"Well, I'm glad we've cleared the air a bit anyway," he said with a grim lo=
ok about his Holbein=20

Astronomer old mouth as he went out.  But we haven't cleared the air. And i=
t disturbs me more=20

than I can say to find that I have reservations from my husband. It bewilde=
rs me to see that I can't=20

be perfectly candid with him. But there are certain deeper feelings that I =
can no longer uncover in=20

his presence. Something holds me back from explaining to him that this fixe=
d dread of mine for all=20

cities is largely based on my loss of little Pee-Wee. For if I hadn't gone =
to New York that time, to=20

Josie Langdon's wedding, I might never have lost my boy. They did the best =
they could, I suppose,=20

before their telegrams brought me back, but they didn't seem to understand =
the danger. And little=20

did I dream, before the Donnelly butler handed me that first startling mess=
age just as we were=20

climbing into the motor to go down to the Rochambeau to meet Chinkie and Ta=

week I was to sit and watch the cruelest thing are full of warm feeling, sc=
arcely interrupted by a=20

little jealousy of temper which there appears to have been on the mother's =
side.  Wolfe's first=20

commission was in his father's regiment of marines, but he never served as =
a marine. He could=20

scarcely have done so, for to the end of his life, he suffered tortures fro=
m sea-sickness. He is now=20

an Ensign in Duroure's regiment of foot. We see him a tall slender boy of f=
ifteen, in scarlet coat,=20

folded back from the breast after the old fashion in broad lapels to displa=
y its white or yellow lining,=20

breeches and gaiters, with his young face surmounted by a wig and a cocked =
hat edged with gold=20

lace, setting off, colours in hand, with his regiment for the war in the Lo=
w Countries. If he missed=20

seeing aristocratic management at Carthagena, he shall see aristocratic and=
 royal strategy at=20

Dettingen. His brother Ned, a boy still more frail than himself, but emulou=
s of his military ardour,=20

goes in another regiment on the same expedition.  The regiment was accident=

child die. I was to watch my own Pee-Wee pass quietly away.  I have often w=
ondered, since, why I=20

never shed a tear during all those terrible three days. I couldn't, in some=
 way, though the nurse=20

herself was crying, and poor old Whinnie and Struthers were sobbing togethe=
r next to the window,=20

and dour old Dinky-Dunk, on the other side of the bed, was racking his shou=
lders with smothered=20

sobs as he held the little white hand in his and the warmth went forever ou=
t of the little fingers=20

where his foolish big hand was trying to hold back the life that couldn't b=
e kept there. The old are=20

ready to die, or can make themselves ready. They have run their race and ha=
d their turn at living.=20

But it seems cruel hard to see a little tot, with eagerness still in his he=
art, taken away, taken away=20

with the wonder of things still in his eyes. It stuns you. It makes you reb=
el. It leaves a scar that=20

Time itself can never completely heal.  Yet through it all I can still hear=
 the voice of valorous old=20

Whinnie other sex, who landing unexpectedly by themselves at Ostend caused =
some perplexity to=20

the Quartermaster. The home affections must have been strong which could ke=
ep a soldier pure in=20

those days.  The regiment was at first quartered at Ghent, where, amidst th=
e din of garrison riot=20

and murderous brawls, we hear the gentle sound of Wolfe's flute, and where =
he studies the=20

fortifications, already anxious to prepare himself for the higher walks of =
his profession. From Ghent=20

the army moved to the actual scene of war in Germany, suffering of course o=
n the march from the=20

badness of the commissariat. Wolfe's body feels the fatigue and hardship. H=
e "never comes into=20

quarters without aching hips and thighs." But he is "in the greatest spirit=
s in the world." "Don't tell=20

me of a constitution" he said afterwards, when a remark was made on the wea=
kness of a brother=20

officer, "he has good spirits, and good spirits will carry a man through ev=
erything."  All the world=20

knows into what a position His Martial=20


_
as he patted my shoulder and smiled with the brine still in the seams of hi=
s furrowed old face.=20

"We'll thole through, lassie; we'll thole through!" he said over and over a=
gain. Yes; we'll thole=20

through. And this is only the uncovering of old wounds. And one must keep o=
ne's heart and one's=20

house in order, for with us we still have the living.  But Dinky-Dunk can't=
 completely understand,=20

I'm afraid, this morbid hankering of mine to keep my family about me, to ha=
ve the two chicks that=20

are left to me close under my wing. And never once, since Pee-Wee went, hav=
e I actually=20

punished either of my children. It may be wrong, but I can't help it. I don=
't want memories of=20

violence to be left corroding and rankling in my mind. And I'd hate to see =
any child of mine cringe,=20

like an ill-treated dog, at every lift of the hand. There II., with the hel=
p of sundry persons of quality,=20

styling themselves generals, got the British army at Dettingen, and how the=
 British soldier fought=20

his way out of the scrape. Wolfe was in the thick of it, and his horse was =
shot under him. His first=20

letter is to his mother--"I take the very first opportunity I can to acquai=
nt you that my brother and=20

self escaped in the engagement we had with the French, the 16th June last, =
and, thank God, are=20

ours and three=20

quarters, and fighting with small arms two hours and one quarter, but lay t=
