Greensboro--and within recent years his life had been greatly changed through the fortunes of 

war. To many homes in the busy town of Greensboro the struggle in Europe had brought privation 

and to some it had brought tragedy, but to the Campbells it had brought prosperity. Campbell, 

Senior, was a wholesale dealer in leather; he had caught the market just right and, in the 

expressive words of his neighbors, had made "a mountain of money." He had moved from his 

modest home in the town and had built a pretentious house on a hillock two miles to the west. 

Those of the townspeople who had been inside "the mansion" declared that every chair and every 

picture on the wall was screaming aloud, "He got rich quick! He got rich quick!"  Campbell, Senior, 

did not believe that the son of a man who had made a million should remain in the public school, 

and so he had arranged to have Tracey go to Ridgley. The younger Campbell had come to 

anomalous sharp beats of the 3ds, in the last column. These are derived from the perfect ratio 6 : 

7, because these 3ds are, in reality, much nearer to the ratio of 6 : 7 than to that of 5 : 6; and 

hence could their beats be counted, they would be those of the table, and not those which would 

be derived from considering these 3ds as having flat temperaments of the ratio 5 : 6. But although 

the beats are slower, the nearer they approach the ratio 6 : 7, this ought not to be regarded as any 

sufficient reason for admitting so large temperaments into the scale, were it not absolutely 

necessary, in order to accommodate those 3ds which are of far more frequent occurrence. 

Although the beats of these 3ds grow slower as their temperaments are increased, yet they are 

losing their character in melody; and become, in this respect, more and more offensive, the more 

they are tempered. Hence the harmony and melody of the several

corresponding numbers in Table IX., that the harshness of the several concords, especially of the 

IIIds and 3ds, is, in general, nearly in the inverse
