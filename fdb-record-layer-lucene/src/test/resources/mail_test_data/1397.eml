Confound you! I was peaceably going about the king's business, when you and=
 we can hardly lend credence to the amendment in his mendacious habit when =
he applies the art of dissimulation to generous purposes.  [Footnote 2: _Po=
lyeucte_ may possibly be as early as 1641.]  These are the masterpieces of =
Corneille. Already in _Pompee_, although its date is that of _Polyeucte_, w=
hile the great dramatist is present throughout, he is not always present at=
 his best. _
But the time to use force has not yet come. [_Chandanaka enters the cart an=
d looks about._] I=20

seek your protection.  _Chandanaka._ [_Speaking in Sanskrit._] He who seeks=
 protection shall be=20

safe.  _Aryaka._      Whene'er he fight, that man will suffer hurts,       =
Will be abandoned of his=20

friends and kin,     Becomes a mock forever, who deserts       One seeking =
aid; 't is an unpardoned=20

sin.                  18  _Chandanaka._ What! the herdsman Aryaka? Like a b=
ird that flees from a=20

hawk, he has fallen into the hand of the fowler. [_Reflecting._] He is no s=
inner, this man who seeks=20

my protection and sits in Charudatta's cart. Besides, he is the friend of g=
ood Sharvilaka, who=20

saved my life. On the other hand, there are the king's orders. What is a ma=
n to do in a case like=20

this? Well, what must be, must be. I promised him my protection just now.  =
    He who gives aid to=20

frightened men,       And joys his neighbor's ills to cure,     If he must =
die, he dies; but then,       His=20

reputation is secure.                                  19  [_He gets down u=
neasily._] I saw the gentleman--

[_correcting himself_] I mean, the lady Vasantasena, and she says "Is it pr=
oper, is it gentlemanly,=20

when I am going to visit Charudatta, to insult me on the highway?"  _Viraka=
._ Chandanaka, I have=20

my suspicions.  _Chandanaka._ Suspicions? How so?  [103.2. S.  _Vir._ You g=
urgled in your=20

craven throat; it seems a trifle shady.        You said "I saw the gentlema=
n," and then "I saw the=20

lady."      20  That's why I'm not satisfied.  _Chandanaka._ What's the mat=
ter with you, man? We=20

southerners don't speak plain. We know a thousand dialects of the barbarian=
s--the Khashas, the=20

Khattis, the Kadas, the Kadatthobilas, the Karnatas, the Karnas, the Pravar=
anas, the Dravidas,=20

and the nurse of heroic virtue. In the _Cid_ the dramatic conflict is betwe=
en love and filial duty; in=20

_Horace_ it is between love, on the one side, united with the domestic affe=
ctions, and, on the=20

other, devotion to country. In both plays the inviolable will is arbiter of=
 the contention. The story of=20

the Horatii and Curiatii, as told by Livy, is complicated by the union of t=
he families through love and=20

marriage; but patriotism requires the sacrifice of the tenderer passions. I=
t must be admitted that=20

the interest declines after the third act, and that our sympathies are alie=
nated from the younger=20

Horace by the murder of a sister; we are required to feel that a private cr=
ime, the offence of=20

overstrained patriotism, is obliterated in the glory of the country. In _Ci=
nna_ we pass from regal to=20

imperial Rome; the commonwealth is represented by Augustus; a great monarch=
y is glorified, but=20

in the noblest way, for the highest act of empire is to wield supreme power=
 under the sway of=20

magnanimity, and to remain the master of all self-regarding passions. The c=
onspiracy of Cinna is=20

discovered; it is a prince's part to pardon, and Augustus rises to a higher=
 empire than that of Rome=20

by the conquest of himself. In both _Horace_ and _Cinna_ there are at times=
 a certain overstrain,=20

an excess of emphasis, a resolve to pursue heroism to all extremities; but =
the conception of moral=20

grandeur is genuine and lofty; the error of Corneille was the error of an i=
magination enamoured of=20

the sublime.  But are there not heroisms of religion as pure as those of pa=
triotism? And must we=20

go back to pagan days to find the highest virtue? Or can divine grace effec=
t no miracles above=20

those of the natural will? Corneille gives his answer to such a challenge i=
n the tragedy of=20


_
the Chinas, the Barbaras, the Kheras, the Khanas, the Mukhas, the Madhughat=
as, and all the rest=20

of 'em, and it all depends on the way we feel whether we say "he" or "she,"=
 "gentleman" or "lady."=20

_Viraka._ Can't I have a look, too? It's the king's orders. And the king tr=
usts me.  _Chandanaka._ I=20

suppose the king doesn't trust _me_!  _Viraka._ Is n't it His Majesty's com=
mand?  _Chandanaka._=20

[_Aside_] If people knew that the good herdsman escaped in Charudatta's car=
t, then the king=20

would make Charudatta suffer for it.  What's to be done? [_Reflecting._] I'=
ll stir up a quarrel the=20

way they do down in the Carnatic. [_Aloud._] Well, Viraka, I made one inspe=
ction myself--my=20

name is Chandanaka--and you want to do it over again. Who are you?  _Viraka=
._ Confound it!=20

Who are you, anyway?  _Chandanaka._ An honorable and highly respectable per=
son, and you=20

don't remember your own family.  _Viraka._ [_Angrily._] Confound you! What =
is my family?=20

_Chandanaka._ Who speaks of such things?  _Viraka._ Speak!  _Chandanaka._ I=
 think I'd better=20

not.      I know your family, but I won't say;     'T would not be modest, =
such things to betray;=20

What good's a rotten apple anyway?                           21  _Viraka._ =
Speak, speak! [_Chandanaka=20

makes a significant gesture._] Confound you! What does that mean?  P. 175.1=
]  _Chand._      A=20

broken whetstone in one hand--a thing     That looks like scissors in the o=
ther wing--     To trim the=20

scrubby beards that curl and cling,     And you--why, you 're a captain of =
the king!                 22=20

rendered to absolute self-devotion to the ideal; a canticle intoned in cele=
bration of heavenly grace.=20

Polyeucte, the martyr, sacrifices to his faith not only life, but love; his=
 wife, who, while she knew=20

him imperfectly, gave him an imperfect love, is won both for God and for he=
r husband by his=20

heroism; she is caught away from her tenderness for Severe into the flame o=
f Polyeucte's devout=20

rapture; and through her Severe himself is elevated to an unexpected magnan=
imity. The family,=20

the country, the monarchy, religion--these in turn were honoured by the gen=
ius of Corneille. He=20

had lifted the drama from a form of loose diversion to be a great art; he h=
ad recreated it as that=20

noblest pastime whose function is to exercise and invigorate the soul.  The=
 transition from=20

_Polyeucte_ to _Le Menteur_, of the same year, is among the most surprising=
 in literature.[2]=20

From the most elevated of tragedies we pass to a comedy, which, while not b=
elonging to the great=20

comedy of character, is charmingly gay. We expect no grave moralities here,=
 nor do we find them.=20

The play is a free and original adaptation from a work of the Spanish drama=
tist Alarcon, but in=20

Corneille's hands it becomes characteristically French. Young Dorante, the =
liar, invents his fictions=20

through an irresistible genius for romancing. His indignant father may just=
ly ask, Has he a heart?=20

Is he a gentleman? But how can a youth with such a pretty wit resist the fa=
scination of his own=20

lies? He is sufficiently punished by the fact that they do not assist, but =
rather trouble, the=20


_
don't remember your own family either.  _Chandanaka._ Tell me. What is the =
family I belong to, I,=20

Chandanaka, pure as the moon?  _Viraka._ Who speaks of such things?  _Chand=
anaka._ Speak,=20

speak! [_Viraka makes a significant gesture._] Confound you! What does that=
 mean?  _Viraka._=20

Listen.      Your house is pure; your father is a drum,     Your mother is =
a kettledrum, you scum!=20

Your brother is a tambourine--tum, tum!     And justice. In Corneille's art=
, tragedy had defined itself,=20

and comedy was free to be purely comic; but it is also literary--light, yet=
 solid in structure; easy, yet=20

exact in style. The _Suite du Menteur_, founded on a comedy by Lope de Vega=
, has a curious=20

attraction of its own, half-fantastic as it is, and half-realistic; yet it =
has shared the fate of all=20

continuations, and could not attain the popularity of its predecessor. It l=
acks=20
