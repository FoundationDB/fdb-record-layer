Tom.  "We'll walk down and meet Mr. Titus, and ask him what it all means." =
 Shortly afterward they=20

came up to the contractor, who was breathing heavily after his run, for he =
was evidently not used=20

to such exercise.  "I beg your pardon, Tom Swift, for leaving you and Mr. D=
amon in such a=20

fashion," said Mr. Titus, "but I had to act quickly or lose the chance of c=
atching that rascal. As it=20

had to give up the chase.  The escape from the Onondagas was a very clever =
and daring deed,=20

and shows the material the colonists of New France were made of in those da=

more daring and important was to follow.  The Iroquois threw off the mask a=

on Montreal and then=20

"Well, I didn't have as close a look as I could have wished for," the contr=
actor said, as he walked=20

back toward the house with Tom and Mr. Damon, "but I'm pretty sure the face=
 that peered in at us=20

through the library window was that of Isaac Waddington."  "And who is he, =
if it isn't asking=20

tainly. I can tell you,"=20

said the contractor.  "Only perhaps we had better wait until we get back to=
 the house.  "Since one=20

but we were lower in our=20
