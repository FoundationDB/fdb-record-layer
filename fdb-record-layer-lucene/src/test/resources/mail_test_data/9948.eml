Jack.  "Or else that big bird or beast, whatever it was they were chasing, has eaten them up," 

suggested Budge, preparing to stow away a fresh wad of gum.  "Nonsense!" exclaimed Nat. "I 

don't believe it was a big bird."  "Waitansee," was all Budge said.  Though the boys discussed the 

matter for some time longer, they could arrive at no satisfactory explanation. As for Long Gun, it 

was useless to ask him his opinion of the mysterious noise. He cowered under his blankets, 

murmured something about "bad spirits," and predicted that evil would befall any one who sought 

to solve the secret.  The night was not disturbed by any further alarms, and they were all up bright 

and early the next morning, with fine appetites.  "The big bird, or whatever it was, didn't steal any 

of us," remarked Jack as he was washing for breakfast. "I hope it didn't steal the ram I shot 

yesterday. We must go after that meat as soon as we have breakfast."  Leaving Budge and Long 

Gun in camp, the others went to where Jack and Nat had slain the ram. It was quite a long ride, 

and they took their time.  "Look here, Jack," called Nat, as, riding slightly in advance, he was first 

to arrive at where the carcass had been tied in a tree. "Something's been here at it. There's none 

of it left."  "Do you mean that?" cried Jack, riding up.  "Sure. You can see it's gone."  The boys 

dismounted and went closer to the tree. There was no doubt but that the choice portions of the 

ram were gone. And at the foot of the tree the dirt was trampled down as if whatever it was that 

had stolen the meat had been put to considerable trouble to get it.  "It was a bear that took it!" 

cried Sam.  "How do you know?" asked Jack.  "Look where he climbed the tree. The bark's torn off 

with his claws, and you can see the marks of his paws in the soft dirt."  "That's right," agreed Nat. 

"Lopsided lollypops! but it must have been a big one, too! Look where the first marks of his claws 

begin," and he pointed to abrasions in the bark a good distance above the ground.  "Do bears eat 

meat?" asked Bony, cracking all his finger knuckles excitedly.  "Sometimes, I believe," answered 

Jack. "Anyway, if the bear that stole my ram didn't get it for himself he must have pulled it down for 

some friends of his."  "What do you mean?" asked Nat.  "Here are the marks of footsteps," went 

on Jack, "and they aren't ours, either. Look, whoever made these had heavy boots with hobnails in 

them, made in the shape of an arrow."  He pointed to the ground. There, in addition to the paw-

marks left by the bear, were footprints, clearly to be seen, and it needed but a glance to show that 

they had not been made by any of the boys or Long Gun.  "Some one--some men, that is--have 

been here since Nat and I were here yesterday," went on Jack. "Either they or the bear took the 

ram."  "Maybe they were the men we heard yelling last night," suggested Nat.  "Yes, and maybe 

they have a trained bear, that goes around stealing meat for them," added Sam with a laugh. 

"Don't get such crazy ideas," objected Nat.  "Well, that might happen," went on Sam. "Almost 

anything is likely to happen in this queer country. I wonder what we'd better do about it?"  "I know 

what I'm going to do," said Jack.  "What?"  "I'm going to trail that bear. He's left plenty of marks, 

and maybe I can get a shot at him. I owe him something for taking my meat, and he'll make a 

good substitute."  "That's the way to talk," cried Bony. "I'm with you, Jack."  The marks of the 

bear's paws were plainly visible for some distance, leading off to the right, and up the sloping side 

of a mountain. As for the footprints of the man or men, they were soon lost to sight. But the boys 

decided to trail the bear. They lost the marks after about a mile, but arguing that the taken, it is 

made light of! If a man should push a young lady into the river and she should be drowned, the law 

would lay hold of him, and he would be tried for murder and hung. But if he wins her affection and 

ruins her, and then casts her off, isn't he worse, than a murderer? There are some sins that are 



worse than murder, and that is one of them. If some one should treat your wife or sister so, you 

would want to shoot him as you would a dog. Why do you not respect all women as you do your 

mother and sister? "What law of justice forgives the obscene bird of prey, while it kicks out of its 

path the soiled and bleeding dove?"  GOD'S COMING JUDGMENT.  God has appointed a day 

when this matter will be set right. "Be not deceived: God is not mocked: whatsoever a man 

soweth, that shall he also reap." He will render to every man according to his deeds. You may 

walk down the aisle of the church and take your seat, thinking that no one knows of your sin. But 

God is on the throne, and He will surely bring you to judgment. Do you believe that God will allow 

this infernal thing to go on,--women bearing all the blame while guilty men go unpunished? God 

has appointed a day when He will judge this world in righteousness, and the day is fast 

approaching.  If you are guilty of this sin, do not let the day pass until you repent. If you are living 

in some secret sin, or are fostering impure thoughts, make up your mind that by the grace of God 

you will be delivered. I don't believe a man who is guilty of this sin is ever going to see the 

kingdom of God unless he repents in sackcloth and ashes, and does all he can to make restitution. 

AN EVIL HARVEST.  Even in this life adultery and uncleanness bring their awful results, both 

physical and mental. The pleasure and excitement that lead so many astray at the beginning soon 

pass away, and only the evil remains. Vice carries a sting in its tail, like the scorpion. The body is 

sinned against, and the body sooner or later suffers. "Every sin that a man doeth is without the 

body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body," said Paul. Nature herself 

punishes with nameless diseases, and the man goes down to the grave rotten, leaving the effects 

of his sin to blight his posterity. There are nations whose manhood has been eaten out by this 

awful scourge.  It drags a man lower than the beasts. It stains the memory. I believe that memory 

is "the worm that never dies," and the memory is never cleansed of obscene stories and unclean 

acts. Even if a man repents and reforms he often has to fight the past.  Lust gave Samson into the 

power of Delilah, who robbed him of his strength. It led David to commit murder and called down 

upon him the wrath of God, and if he had not repented he would have lost heaven. I believe that if 

Joseph had responded to the enticement of Potiphar's wife, his light would have gone out in 

darkness.  It ends in one or other of two ways: either in remorse and shame because of the 

realization of the loss of purity, with a terrible struggle against a hard taskmaster; or in hardness of 

heart, brutalizing of the finer senses, which is a more dreadful condition.  We hear a good deal 

about intemperance nowadays. That sin advertises itself; it shows its marks upon the face and in 

the conduct. But this hides itself away under the shadow of the night. A man who tampers with this 

evil goes on step by step until his character is blasted, his reputation ruined, his health gone, and 

his life made as dark as hell. May God wake up the nation to see how this awful sin is spreading! 

Will any one deny that the house of the strange woman is "the way to hell, going down to the 

chambers of death," as the Bible says? Are there not men whose characters have been utterly 

ruined 


_
den, after he had the meat, the young hunters laid their course as well as they could by compass 

and kept on.  They had to travel slowly, because the road was not very good for the horses, and at 

noon they had not come up to bruin. Eating a light lunch, they kept on, and it was mid-afternoon 

when Jack, who was ahead, noticed that his horse suddenly stopped and began to shiver. 

"Fellows," he cried, "we're near the bear. That's what ails the horse."  The other steeds began to 

exhibit signs of terror, so it was decided to dismount and lead them back a short distance.  "I'll stay 

with the horses," volunteered Bony. "I--er--I don't exactly feel up to hunting bears to-day."  "You're 

not afraid, are you?" asked Sam.  "No, not exactly. You might call it--out of practice," and Bony 

began cracking his knuckles.  They tried to persuade him to go with them, but he would not, so 

Jack, Will, Nat and Sam went on. It did not take much searching to discover a trail leading farther 

up the side of the mountain, and following this a little way they smelled the unmistakable odor of 

wild animals.  "His cave's near here," whispered Jack.  They came in sight of it a moment later, 

and then there was no doubt as to who had stolen part of the ram. For in front of a black opening 

in the side of the big hill was a portion of the carcass.  "I wonder if he's in there?" said Jack. 

"Maybe you'll wish he wasn't," commented Sam.  "I will not," was Jack's bold reply. "I'm going to 

get a shot at him now."  "How are you going to get him out?"  "I'll show you."  Jack quickly made a 

torch of some dry bark, and lighting it, tossed it into the mouth of the cave. Then he ran quickly 

back, and with his chums stood waiting with ready rifle.  "We'd better separate a bit," said Nat. "If 

he comes out with a rush, and you miss him, Jack, we can take a crack at him."  This was voted 

good advice, and Sam, Will and Nat moved down the slope a short distance, leaving Jack nearer 

the cave.  "I guess he isn't going to come out," called Jack to his chums. "He's asleep, maybe. I'll 

try to wake him up."  He caught up a large stone, and tossed it into the cave. Hardly had he done 

so than there sounded a series of angry growls, and with a loud "woof!" bruin appeared at the 

mouth of the cavern, his little eyes glistening with wrath, and the fur on his back raised in a long 

ridge.  "Shoot him, Jack!" cried Nat.  But Jack did not need this advice. Dropping on one knee he 

took quick aim and pulled the trigger. At the sound of the shot bruin lurched forward, and without 

the loss of a second Jack pumped in another cartridge and let him have it right in the head.  Then 

the big, tawny brute, with a scream, launched himself forward, and doubling up into a ball, began 

to roll down the mountain-side, straight toward where Sam and Nat stood.  "Look out!" cried Jack, 

for he saw that the bear was in his death struggle, and might attack his chums.  Sam and Nat 

needed no warning, but as they turned to get out of the way of the infuriated creature, Nat's foot 

slipped. He fell, and, to save himself, he clutched at Sam. They both went down in a heap, rolling 

over and over, but a few feet in front of the bear, that came bounding after them, clawing up dirt, 

stones and little shrubs as it tried to stay its progress.     CHAPTER XXV  SOME PECULIAR 

MARKS   "Shoot! Shoot!" cried Will Williams, who had remained to one side. "Shoot him again, 

Jack!"  "I can't! I may hit Sam or Nat!"  Jack did not know what to do. He and Will had to stand 

there and watch their chums rolling and slipping down the mountain-side, with the bear, in its 

death struggle, slowly gaining on them.  Suddenly the beast struck a large boulder, bounded up 

into the air, and came down nearly on top of the two lads. Jack's heart almost stopped beating, 

and Will turned his head aside. Bear and boys seemed to be in one indistinguishable heap. 

"They'll be killed!" cried Will.  Jack started down the hill on the run. He had not taken a dozen 

steps, his gaze all the while fixed on that heap, which had now reached a little ledge, where it 



came to a stop, when he saw Sam and Nat slowly extricate themselves.  "They're alive, anyway," 

he murmured.  He heard Will following after him, but did not look back. He wanted to see what the 

bear would do. Sam and Nat appeared bewildered, but Jack noticed that they moved away from 

bruin. The brute was quiet.  "I wonder if I killed him?" thought Jack. Then he called out: "Is he 

dead?"  "As a door-nail," replied Sam.  "Are you hurt?" sung out Will.  "Only bruised some," 

answered Sam, rubbing several places on his body.  By this time Jack had reached his chums. 

Their clothing was disheveled, and their hands and faces were covered with dirt, but the bear had 

not harmed them.  "I thought it was all up with you," said Jack with relief in his voice.  "So did I," 

admitted Nat. "But I guess that bear was dead when he started to roll. It was when it hit us, 

anyway, for it never made a move. It rolled right on top of us, and Sam yelled----"  "So did you," 

spoke Sam quickly. "You were just as frightened as I was."  "I guess that's right," admitted Nat. 

"But you got your bear, all right, Jack."  They looked at the dead animal. It was a large grizzly. 

"Another trophy for the gun club," remarked Sam. "Say, we're doing all right for amateurs. Jack's 

new organization is a success.  "It's all to the bear steaks!" exclaimed Nat with a grin, as he gently 

caressed his elbow, where the skin was rubbed off.  "How are we going to get this back to camp?" 

asked Will.  "Oh, I guess we can pile it on the horses," said Nat.  "Not until it's cut up," remarked 

Jack. "Did you ever try to lift a dead bear?"  None of them had, and when they tried to raise the 

lifeless bruin they found it beyond their strength. They had keen hunting knives with them, 

however, and soon had the bear skinned and the choicest portions cut off. Jack took the skin, 

intending to have a rug made of it. Then the horses were brought up, and the meat tied on the 

backs of the saddles. Satisfied with their day's hunt thus far, the boys headed for camp, Will 

getting a shot at a fine ram on the way back, but missing it, much to his regret.  "Better luck next 

time," consoled Jack.  Long Gun and Budge had a fine supper ready for the young hunters, and 

never was a meal better enjoyed. Then, as it grew dark, they all sat about the camp fire, listening 

to the story of killing the bear.  "Oh, this is the kind of life to lead," said Nat with a sigh. "It's simply 

perfect."  "And to think that we'll soon have to go back to Washington Hall," put in Bony.  "I know 

where Jack would rather be than here," said Sam with a grin barely visible in the flickering light of 

the camp fire.  "Where?" asked Nat.  "Over at Pryor's Gap, where a certain girl with brown eyes----

"  Plunk!  A wad of dried leaves took Sam squarely in the face.  "You dry up!" commanded Jack as 

he looked around for another missile.  "Oh, of course; but I thought you'd like to be reminded of 

her," went on Sam.  "I guess he can think of her without you reminding him," added Nat.  "I'm 

going to turn in," announced Jack suddenly, and the laughs of his chums did not seem to 

disconcert him. They all retired a few minutes later and slept soundly.  "Well, what's the program 

to-day?" asked Sam as they stepped from the tent the next morning into the cold, crisp air. "Hello," 

he added, "it's been snowing again."  "Plenty good for track sheep," announced Long Gun.  "Oh, 

we don't need any fresh meat. What's the use of going hunting again?" asked Jack.  "What will we 

do, then--go fishing?" demanded Nat.  "I have an idea that it would be fun to take a trip back over 

the mountain," went on Jack. "We've never been in that direction."  "It's quite a climb," said Bony 

as he looked up the immense hill, at the foot of which they were camped.  "I know it, but Long Gun 

says there's a good trail, and we can go on our horses and take it easy. What do you say?"  "I say 

let's go," put in Will. "I heard there was some sort of a camp over there, and maybe I could get a 

trace of my uncle."  "Then we'll go," decided Jack. "What sort of a camp is it?"  "I don't know 



exactly. I met a man during my wanderings who told me he had been delivering supplies at a 

camp over on the eastern slope of Rattlesnake Mountain. This is Rattlesnake Mountain, isn't it?" 

"That's the name it goes by," said Jack. "But what sort of supplies did he take?"  "That's the queer 

part of it. He couldn't tell. They were in boxes, and he was never allowed to go very close to the 

camp. He always had to halt quite a way off, leave his stuff and drive away."  "That's queer," 

commented Jack. "I wonder through this accursed sin? Are there not wives who would rather sink 

into their graves than live? Many a man went with a pure woman to the altar a few years ago, and 

promised to love and cherish her. Now he has given his affections to some vile harlot, and brought 

ruin on his wife and children!  ARE YOU GUILTY?  Young man, young woman, are you guilty, 

even in thought? Bear in mind what Christ said: "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old 

time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to 

lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart." How many would repent but 

that they are tied hand and foot, and some vile harlot, whose feet are fastened in hell, clings to him 

and says: "If you give me up, I will expose you!" Can you step on the scales and take that harlot 

with you?  If you are guilty of this awful sin, escape for your life. Hear God's voice while there is 

yet time. Confess your sin to Him. Ask Him to snap the fetters that bind you. Ask Him to give you 

victory over your passions. If your right eye offends, pluck it out. If your right hand offends, cut it 

off. Shake yourself like Samson, and say:  "By the grace of God I will not go down to an adulterer's 

grave."  There is hope for you, adulterer. There is hope for you, adulteress. God will not turn you 

away if you truly repent. No matter how low down in vice and misery you may have sunk, you may 

be washed, you may be sanctified, you may be justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the 

Spirit of our God. Remember what Christ said to that woman which was a sinner--"Thy sins are 

forgiven thee; thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace;" and to that woman that was taken in 

adultery--"Go, and sin no more."    Eighth Commandment  "Thou shalt not steal."  During the time 

of slavery, a slave was preaching with great power. His master heard of it, and sent for him, and 

said:  "I understand you are preaching?"  "Yes," said the slave,  "Well, now," said the master, "I will 

give you all the time you need, and I want you to prepare a sermon on the Ten Commandments, 

and to bear down especially on stealing, because there is a great deal of stealing on the 

plantation."  The slave's countenance fell at once. He said he wouldn't like to do that; there wasn't 

the warmth in that subject there was in others.  I have noticed that people are satisfied when you 

preach about the sins of the patriarchs, but they don't like it when you touch upon the sins of to-

day. That is coming too near home. But we need to have these old doctrines stated over and over 

again in our churches. Perhaps it is not necessary to speak here about the grosser violations of 

this eighth commandment, because the law of the land looks after these; but a man or woman can 

steal without cracking safes and picking pockets. Many a person who would shrink from taking 

what belongs to another person, thinks nothing of stealing from the government or from large 

public corporations, such as streetcar companies. If you steal from a rich man it is as much a sin 

as stealing from a poor man. If you lie about the value of things you buy, are you not trying to 

defraud the storekeeper? "It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, 

then he boasteth."  On the other hand, many a person who would not steal himself, holds stock in 

companies that make dishonest profits; but "though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go 

unpunished."  A young man in our Bible Institute in Chicago got on the grip-car, and before the 



conductor came around to take the fare, they reached the Institute and he jumped off without 

paying his fare. In thinking over that act he said: "That was not just right. I had my ride and I ought 

to pay the fare."  He remembered the face of the conductor, and he went to the car barns and paid 

him the five cents.  "Well," the conductor said, "you are a fool not to keep it." "No," the young man 

said, "I am not. I got the ride, and I ought to have paid for it." "But it was my business to collect it." 

"No, it was my business to hand it to you." The conductor said, "I think you must belong to that 

Bible Institute."  I have heard few things said of the Institute that pleased me so much as that one 

thing. Not long after that the conductor came to the Institute and asked the student to come to see 

him. A cottage-meeting was started in his house; and not only himself but a number of others 

around there were converted as a result of that one act.  You can hardly take up a paper now 

without reading of some cashier of a bank who has become a defaulter, or of some large swindling 

operation that has ruined scores, or of some breach of trust, or fraudulent failure in business. 

These things are going on all over the land.  I would to God that we could have all gambling swept 

away. If Christian men take the right stand, they can check it and break it up in a great many 

places. It leads to stealing.  WHERE THE STREAM STARTS.  The stream generally starts at 

home and in the school. Parents are woefully lax in their condemnation and punishment of the sin 

of stealing. The child begins by taking sugar, it may be. The mother makes light of it at first, and 

the child's conscience is violated without any sense of wrong. By and by it is not an easy matter to 

check the habit, because it grows and multiplies with every new commission.  The value of the 

thing that is stolen has nothing to say to the guilt of the act. Two people were once arguing upon 

this point, and one said: "Well, you will not contend that a theft of a pin and of a dollar are the 

same to God?" "When you tell me the difference between the value of a pin and of a dollar to 

God," said the other, "I will answer your question."  The value or amount is not what is to be 

considered, but whether the act is _right_ or _wrong_. Partial obedience is not enough: obedience 

must be entire. The little indulgences, the small transgressions are what drive religion out of the 

soul. They lay the foundation for the grosser sins. If you give way to little temptations, you will not 

be able to resist when great temptations come to you.  GOD'S WEIGHTS.  _Extortioner_, are you 

ready to step into the scales? What will you do with the condemnation of God--"Thou has taken 

usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbor's by extortion, and hast 

forgotten me, saith the Lord God?"  _Employer_, are you guilty of sweating your employees? Have 

you defrauded the hireling of his wages? Have you paid starvation wages? "Thou shalt not 

oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers 

that are in thy land within thy gates. . . . What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind 

the faces of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts. . . . Behold, the hire of the laborers who have 

reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which 

have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."  And you, _employee_, have you 

been honest with your employer? Have you robbed him of his due by wasting your time when he 

was not looking? If God should summon you into His presence now, what would you say?  Let the 

_merchant_ step into the scales. See if you will prove light when weighed against the law of God. 

Are you guilty of adulterating what you sell? Do you substitute inferior grades of goods? Are your 

advertisements deceptive? Are your cheap prices made possible by defrauding your customers 

either in quantity or in quality? Do you teach your clerks to put a French or an English tag on 



domestic manufactures, and then sell them as imported goods? Do you tell them to say that the 

goods are all wool when you know they are half cotton? Do you give short weight or measure? 

See what God says in His Word: "Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the 

bag of deceitful weights? Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small: thou 

shalt not have in thy house divers measures, a great and a small: but thou shalt have a perfect 

and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in 

the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. . . . Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in 

meteyard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah and a just hin, shall 

ye have." Are you like those who said: "When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? 

and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and 

falsifying the balances by deceit? that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of 


_
do with----"  Then he stopped suddenly, without finishing his sentence.  "Well, with what?" asked 

Bony.  "Never mind," replied Jack as he began oiling his gun. "Let's get ready to go over the top of 

the mountain."  They found it a hard climb, but they took it by degrees and did not hurry the 

horses, who were used to mountain trails. They reached the summit at noon, and after a rest and 

lunch, they started down the slope.  The newly-fallen snow made a white mantle over the earth, 

and it was undisturbed by any marks until they came along.  "No signs of game," said Jack, "but I 

guess we don't need any. Long Gun and Budge will be able to get up a good supper with what's in 

camp," for the Indian and the gum-chewing lad had remained behind.  They traveled on for a few 

miles farther, admiring the view of a much more wild and desolate country than was visible on the 

side of the mountain where they were staying.  "Well, I guess we'd better turn back," called Sam 

as he noted that the sun was getting low in the sky.  "No; let's ride down to that little level spot and 

look over," proposed Jack. "Then we'll come back."  They were not long in reaching the place. Nat, 

who had urged his horse ahead, was the first to get to it. Suddenly he pulled his animal back and 

uttered a cry.  "What is it?" called Jack.  "Some peculiar tracks," replied Nat. "Look here!"  They all 

rode up. There in the snow were many strange marks. The white crystals were scattered, and in 

some places the ground was swept bare. In other spots there were many footprints.  "See!" cried 

Jack. "The man with the arrow made in hobnails on the soles of his shoes has been here!"  He 

pointed to the impressions.  "Yes, and there's been a fight or a struggle here," added Sam. And, 

indeed, it did seem so, for in some places the ground was torn up, the dirt being scattered over the 

snow.     CHAPTER XXVI  THE SPRING TRAP   For several moments the boys gazed in silence 

at the strange marks they had come across. Then Jack said:  "Well, fellows, we seem to be up 

against some more of that mystery."  "Why?" asked Bony. "Do you think this has anything to do 

with the other?"  "I do."  "You mean the strange sound we heard at night?" asked Will.  "That's it," 

went on Jack. "I think we are on the track of something queer."  "And do you intend to look 

further?" was Nat's query.  "Well, not to-day," answered Jack. "But I will sooner or later. I believe 

something happened here which has to do with that queer  "Show me a people whose trade is 

dishonest," said Fronde, "and I will show you a people whose religion is a sham." Unless your 

religion can keep you honest in your business, it isn't worth much; it isn't the right kind. God is a 

God of righteousness, and no true follower of his can swerve one inch to the right or left without 

disobeying Him.  STOLEN GOODS A BURDEN.  I heard of a boy who stole a cannon-ball from a 

navy-yard. He watched his opportunity, sneaked into the yard, and secured it. But when he had it, 

he hardly knew what to do with it. It was heavy, and too large to conceal in his pocket, so he had 

to put it under his hat. When he got home with it, he dared not show it to his parents, because it 

would have led at once to his detection. He said in after years it was the last thing he ever stole. 

The story is told that one of Queen Victoria's diamonds valued at $600,000 was stolen from a 

jeweler's window, to whom it had been given to set. A few months afterward a miserable man died 

a miserable death in a poor lodging-house. In his pocket was found the diamond and a letter 

telling how he had not dared to sell it lest it should lead to his discovery and imprisonment. It never 

brought him anything but anxiety and pain.  Everything you steal is a curse to you in that way. The 

sin overreaches itself. A man who takes money that does not belong to him never gets any lasting 

comfort. He has no real pleasure, for he has a guilty conscience. He cannot look an honest man in 

the face. He loses peace of mind here, and all hope of heaven hereafter. "As the partridge sitteth 



on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the 

midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool. . . . Let no man go beyond and defraud his brother 

in any matter; because that the Lord is the avenger of all such."  I may be speaking to some clerk 

who perhaps took five cents to-day out of his employer's drawer to buy a cigar; perhaps he took 

ten cents to get a shave, and thinks he will put it back to-morrow--no one will ever know it. If you 

have taken a cent, you are a thief. Do you ever think how those little stealings may bring you to 

ruin? Let your employer find it out. If he doesn't take you into court, he will discharge you. Your 

hopes will be blasted, and it will be hard work to get up again. Whatever condition you are in, do 

not take a cent that does not belong to you. Rather than steal, go up to heaven in

have an idea," came from Bony.  "Don't let it get away from you," advised Nat.  "No, I'm serious," 

went on the lanky youth. "I think these men have some strange beast or through the world in a 

gilded chariot of stolen riches.  RESTITUTION.  If you have ever taken money dishonestly, you 

need not pray God to forgive you and fill you with the Holy Ghost until you make restitution. If you 

have not got the money now to pay back, will to do it,

times. Maybe that's what happened here, and they had to fight to capture it again."  "That's 

nonsense!" exclaimed Sam.  "Not so nonsensical, either," Jack hastened to say. "If it was an 

immense bird, like a big eagle, it would account for the noises we heard--at least, some of them." 

"But there is no eagle large enough for men to ride on its back," objected Nat.  "How do you know

point. If the plough has gone deep, if the repentance is true, it will bring forth fruit. What use is 

there in my coming to God until I am willing to make it good, like Zacchaeus, if I have done any 

man wrong or have taken anything from him falsely? "If the wicked restore the pledge, give again
