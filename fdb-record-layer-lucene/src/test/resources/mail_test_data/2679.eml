dracaena marginata commentator, "Krishna had reclaimed from the sea a porti=
on of the country," which means in plain language that the continents had a=
ll been changed meanwhile--and "had renovated the city"--or rather built a =
new one, Dvaraka; for one reads in the _Bhagavad Purana_(487) that Kushasth=
ali was founded and built by Raivata within the sea; and subsequent discove=
ries showed that it was the same, or on the same spot, as Dvaraka. Therefor=
e any large establishment of servants."  D'Artagnan smiled; Porthos wanted =
to lengthen out his names, Mousqueton to cut his short.  "Well, my dear Mou=
ston," he said, "rest satisfied. I will call thee Mouston; and if it makes =
thee happy I will not 'tutoyer' you any longer."  "Oh!" cried Mousqueton, r=
eddening with joy; "if you do me, sir, such honor, I shall be grateful all =
my life; it is too much to ask."  "Alas!" thought dracaena marginata commen=
tator, "Krishna had reclaimed from the sea a portion of the country," which=
 means in plain language that the continents had all been changed meanwhile=
--and "had renovated the city"--or rather built a new one, Dvaraka; for one=
 reads in the _Bhagavad Purana_(487) that Kushasthali was founded and built=
 by Raivata within the sea; and subsequent discoveries showed that it was t=
he same, or on the same spot, as Dvaraka. Therefore any large establishment=
 of servants."  D'Artagnan smiled; Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names=
, Mousqueton to cut his short.  "Well, my dear Mouston," he said, "rest sat=
isfied. I will call thee Mouston; and if it makes thee happy I will not 'tu=
toyer' you any longer."  "Oh!" cried Mousqueton, reddening with joy; "if yo=
u do me, sir, such honor, I shall be grateful all my life; it is too much t=
o ask."  "Alas!" thought _
explained his perplexity. Then Brahma asked him whom he wished for a son- i=
n-law, and upon=20

hearing a few personages named, the Father of the World smiled and said: "O=
f those whom you=20

have named the third and fourth generation [Root-Races] no longer survive, =
for many successions=20

of ages [Chatur-Yuga, or the four Yuga cycles] have passed away while you w=
ere listening to our=20

songsters. Now on earth the twenty-eighth great age of the present Manu is =
nearly finished and=20

the Kali period is at hand. You must therefore bestow this virgin-gem upon =
some other husband.=20

For you are now alone."  Then the Raja Raivata is told to proceed to Kushas=
thali, his ancient=20

capital, which was now called Dvaraka, and where reigned in his stead a por=
tion of the divine=20

being (Vishnu) in the person of Baladeva, the brother of Krishna, regarded =
as the seventh=20

incarnation of Vishnu whenever Krishna is taken as a full divinity.  "Being=
 thus instructed by the=20

Lotus-born [Brahma], Raivata returned with his daughter to earth, where he =
found the race of men=20

dwindled in stature [see what is said in the Stanzas and Commentaries of th=
e races of mankind=20

gradually decreasing in stature]; ... reduced in vigour, and enfeebled in i=
ntellect. Repairing to the=20

city of Kushasthali, he found it much altered," put before his three names,=
 a tiny coronet to paint=20

upon the panels of his carriage!  "I shall pass all my life," thought D'Art=
agnan, "in seeking for a=20

man who is really contented with his lot."  Whilst making this reflection, =
chance seemed, as it=20

were, to give him the lie direct. When Porthos had left him to give some or=
ders he saw=20

Mousqueton approaching. The face of the steward, despite one slight shade o=
f care, light as a=20

summer cloud, seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity.  "Here is what I a=
m looking for,"=20

thought D'Artagnan; "but alas! the poor fellow does not know the purpose fo=
r which I am here."=20

He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him.  "Sir," said the servant=
, "I have a favour to=20

ask you."  "Speak out, my friend."  "I am afraid to do so. Perhaps you will=
 think, sir, that prosperity=20

has spoiled me?"  "Art thou happy, friend?" asked D'Artagnan.  "As happy as=
 possible; and yet, sir,=20

you may make me even happier than I am."  "Well, speak, if it depends on me=
."  "Oh, sir! it=20

depends on you only."  "I listen--I am waiting to hear."  "Sir, the favor I=
 have to ask of you is, not to=20

call me 'Mousqueton' but 'Mouston.' Since I have had the honor of being my =
lord's steward I have=20

taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors=
