The date of the expected crisis--February 1, 1833, when the nullification o=
rdinance was to take=20

effect--was now near at hand, and on both sides preparations were pushed. D=
uring the interval,=20

however, the tide turned decidedly against the nullifiers. A call for a gen=
eral convention of the=20

States "to determine and consider . . . questions of disputed power" served=
 only to draw out strong=20

expressions of disapproval of the South Carolina program, showing that it c=
ould not expect even=20

moral support from outside. On the 16th of January Jackson asked Congress f=
or authority to alter=20

or abolish certain ports of entry, to use force to execute the revenue laws=
, and to try in the federal=20

courts cases that might arise from the present emergency. Five days later a=
 bill on these lines--

popularly denominated the "Force Bill"--was introduced; and while many men =
who had no=20

sympathy with nullification drew back from a plan involving the coercion of=
 a State, it was soon=20

settled that some sort of measure for strengthening the President's hand wo=
uld be passed.=20

Meanwhile a way of escape from the whole difficulty was unexpectedly opened=
. The friends of Van=20

Buren began to fear that the disagreement of North and South upon the tarif=
f question would cost=20

their favorite the united support of the party in 1836. Accordingly they se=
t on foot a movement in=20

Congress to bring about a moderate reduction of the prevailing rates; and i=
t was of course their=20

hope that the nullifiers would be induced to recede altogether from the pos=
ition which they had=20

taken. Through Verplanck of New York, the Ways and Means Committee of the H=
ouse brought in=20

a measure reducing the duties, within two years, to about half the existing=
 rates. Jackson=20

approved the plan, although personally he had little to do with it.  But th=
ough the Verplanck Bill=20

could not muster sufficient support to become law, it revived tariff discus=
sion on promising lines,=20

and it brought there was living a son of Mahaut's brother, Philippe; and th=
is young Robert de=20

Beaumont, calling himself Robert d'Artois, was the person who, instigated b=
y his mother, now=20

attacked Mahaut's title, appealing for judgment to the king and the court o=
f peers. Robert=20

demanded the recognition of his rights to the countship of Artois, or, fail=
ing that, to an indemnity of=20

considerable amount. This latter had been already provided for by a convent=
ion between his=20

grand-fathers at the time of the marriage of Philippe d'Artois and Blanche =
de Bretagne, and Robert=20

was perfectly justified in demanding its payment. When the cause was tried =
before Philippe le Bel,=20

October, 1309, he rendered fair judgment, confirming Mahaut in the possessi=
on of Artois and=20

granting certain lands and a large sum of money to Robert.  But mediaeval p=
olitics were very=20

uncertain; what one king did or said might well be reversed by his successo=
r; and so the death of=20

Philippe le Bel (1314) was the signal for a renewed attempt to dispossess M=
ahaut and her=20

children. At this time there was much disquiet over all the kingdom, and Ma=
haut had the dreadful=20

shame of her daughter to harass her; it seemed, therefore, a peculiarly opp=
ortune time to begin=20

the attack upon her. Robert addressed a most insolent letter to his aunt: _=
A tres haute et tres=20

noble dame, Mahaut d'Artoys, comtesse de Bourgogne, Robert d'Artoys, cheval=
ier_. But we will=20

translate: "Since you have wrongfully denied me my rights to the countship =
of Artois, at which I=20

have been and still am greatly troubled, and which I neither can nor will l=
onger suffer, therefore I=20

notify you that I shall take counsel to recover mine own as soon as may be.=
" Not content with this=20

formal claim, which he pushed before the king, Robert resorted to most unwo=
rthy weapons in his=20

contest with Mahaut, stirring up the vassals and communes of Artois, inciti=
ng them to acts of=20

violence against her and her children, and=20


_
In this juncture patriots of all parties turned to the one man whose leader=
ship seemed=20

indispensable in tariff legislation--the "great pacificator," Henry Clay, w=
ho after two years in private=20

life had just taken his seat in the Senate. Clay was no friend of Jackson o=
r of Van Buren, and it=20

required much sacrifice of personal feeling to lend his services to a progr=
am whose political=20

benefits would almost certainly accrue to his rivals. Finally, however, he =
yielded and on the 12th of=20

February he rose in the Senate and offered a compromise measure proposing t=
hat on all articles=20

which paid more than twenty per cent the amount in excess of that rate shou=
ld be reduced by=20

stages until in 1842 it would ready to credit accusations of the sort that =
Mahaut had employed=20

sorcery against her son-in-law, Philippe le Long, and had poisoned the King=
, Louis X.  We have=20

had occasion to mention now and again this subject of witchcraft; it may be=
 permissible, therefore,=20

to give some few details brought out in the investigation, in 1317, of the =
charges of evil practices=20

brought against Mahaut d' Artois. The belief in witchcraft was almost a car=
dinal article of faith=20

throughout many centuries, even among the educated classes, and one might s=
ay that the cynical=20

author of the second part of the _Roman de la Rose_, Jean de Meung, is almo=
st a unique=20

exception in his scepticism regarding the power of sorcery. Many=20


_
Stormy debates followed on both the Compromise Tariff and the Force Bill, b=
ut before the session=20

closed on the 4th of March both were on the statute book. When, therefore, =
the South Carolina=20

convention, in accordance with an earlier proclamation of Governor Hamilton=
, reassembled on the=20

11th of March, the wind had been taken out of the nullifiers' sails; the la=
ws which they had=20

"nullified" had been repealed, and miserable old woman had suffered horribl=
e tortures at the hands=20

of justice or had been hounded to her death by superstitious neighbors who =
credited her with=20

causing diseases of men and cattle, dearth, drouth, storms, or any other un=
toward misfortunes;=20

and many a monk, devoting himself to rational study of the phenomena of nat=
ure, to chemistry,=20

astronomy, medicine, or any other science, had incurred suspicion of=20


_
So the tempest passed. Both sides claimed victory, and with some show of re=
ason. So far as was=20

possible without an actual test of strength, the authority of the Federal G=
overnment had been=20

vindicated and its dignity maintained; the constitutional doctrines of Webs=
ter acquired a new=20

sanction; the fundamental point was enforced that a law--that every law--en=
acted by Congress=20

must be obeyed until repealed or until set aside by the courts as unconstit=
utional. On the other=20

hand, the nullifiers had brought about the repeal of the laws to which they=
 objected and had been=20

largely instrumental in turning the tariff policy of the country for some d=
ecades into a new channel.=20

Moreover they expressed no regret for their acts and in no degree renounced=
 the views upon=20

which those acts had been based. They submitted to the authority of the Uni=
ted States, but on=20

terms fixed by themselves. And, what is more, they supplied practically eve=
ry constitutional and=20

political argument to be used by their sons in 1860 to justify secession.  =
   CHAPTER IX THE WAR=20

ON THE UNITED STATES BANK  "Nothing lacks now to complete the love-feast," =
wrote Isaac Hill=20

sardonically to Thomas H. Benton after the collapse of nullification, "but =
for Jackson and Webster=20

to solemnize the coalition [in support of the Union] with a few mint-juleps=
! I think I like Gerbert=20

himself, who lived to become Pope. The Church authorized the belief in evil=

 his emissaries, a certain=20

had come to her and asked her to compound a sort of philtre or potion to re=
store the love of Count=20

Philippe de Poitiers for her daughter Jeanne, then imprisoned at Dourdan un=
der the charge of=20

adultery. Isabelle required Mahaut to procure for her and deliver to her, i=

, and daisy,=20

 produced into a=20

powder, which was to be administered to Philippe in his food or drink or=20
