as we may dislike literature in translation, it is perhaps salutary to reme=
mber that literary=20

masterpieces must survive in translation or not at all. In what language we=
re the parables spoken?=20

If Homer were not Homer still in English or French or German, how much of H=
omer would the=20

world know? Some bouquet of his own time is gone, but perhaps we should not=
 have liked it if it=20

had remained. At least we have kept what we liked; we have kept what suited=
 our spiritual needs,=20

we have loved Andromache and Hector, and favored daughter. And when, in the=
 imminence of=20

death, he determined that the silly dauphin, jealously guarded at Amboise, =
should learn something=20

and should know that the power of the sceptre was soon to pass to him, it w=
as Anne de Beaujeu=20

again on whom he relied. He enjoined the dauphin Charles to keep about him =
the faithful servants=20

who had made France; especially did he recommend "Master Oliver," without w=
hom, he said, "I=20

should have been nothing." But, before all others, the dauphin was to honor=
 and obey=20


_
Agamemnon should quarrel, and have decided, as all our fathers have done, t=
hat for so beautiful a=20

woman as Helen to waste her time on so mean a fellow as Paris, there must h=
ave been queer=20

influences at work. To live in art in this timeless way, is to satisfy what=
 is eternal in ourselves; it is=20

to leave behind us the limitations of our hour, our place, and our language=
. And unless art is wide=20

enough for us to live in it so, we shall trifle with it only for an hour, a=
nd without regret let it go the=20

way of other contemporary things.     V  THE CHARACTERS PROPER TO LITERATUR=
E   I  Our=20

impulse might be to say that any character at all is proper to literature, =
or to any phase of=20

literature, for we have long ago discarded that convention foolish woman in=
 the world.  In spite of=20

astrologers; in spite of liberal doses of that expensive panacea, potable g=
old, administered by his=20

insolent physician, Jacques Coictier; in spite of a second anointing from t=
he sacred _ampulla_,=20

brought from Rheims for that special purpose; in spite of all the silver sa=
ints stuck on the rim of his=20

cap the spirit went out of the body of Louis XI, and France welcomed his de=
ath as a deliverance.=20

In his zeal for the destruction of feudalism and the upbuilding of a nation=
al government, he had=20

become a tyrant. But the work he had begun must go on, if France was not to=
 step back fifty or a=20

hundred years in progress. The new king, Charles VIII, was but a boy of fou=
rteen, and deplorably=20

immature.=20


_
always as nobly born, or if at first they were not gentlefolk, yet in the l=
ast chapter they were shown=20

to be prince and princess in disguise. Our leading characters now may have =
whatever origin God=20

wills; the author does not interfere. No longer do we reserve the peasant, =
the poor or the ignorant=20

for the foot of our list of _dramatis person=C3=A6_, nor do we smuggle them=
 into the scene at resting=20

moments, for comic relief. Since human nature is the subject of art, and si=
nce the supply the=20

defects of education; for he was weak in mind, weak in body, and easily inf=
luenced for good or for=20

ill. With such a tool ready for the hand of any ambitious noble who would d=
estroy France, the=20

outlook was not cheering. But it was the good fortune of France to find a r=
uler who could and did=20

control the king till such time as the fruits of the wise despotism of Loui=
s could be safely gathered;=20

and this ruler was a woman.  As Charles had already attained the legal=20

reating common folk=20

in the vast majority, we have even followed the example with an excess of e=
nthusiasm, until the=20

elect are pretty well put down from their former seat in literature, and in=
 their stead are the socially=20

humble and the mentally weak. For a heir to the throne, there could be no r=
egency. But Anne de=20

Beaujeu and her husband had been named by the late king as the tutors of Ch=
arles, to the=20

exclusion of Louis d'Orleans, who, as first prince of the blood royal, had =
a prescriptive right to the=20

guardianship. And just as Blanche de Castille, under different conditions a=
