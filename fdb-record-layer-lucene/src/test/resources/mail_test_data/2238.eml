in revenues from the increased commerce and manufactures, but in the great =
saving in the=20

expenses of furnishing the army with weapons, made in the country at so muc=

before. In the arsenal reform is needed; all its workmen except the gunsmit=
hs should be replaced=20

gradually by Indians, who are so skilful and work for less wages than the S=
paniards; and the=20

gunsmiths should have a regular military organization. Better provision sho=
uld also be made for a=20

supply of gunpowder. At the beginning of the century, a powder factory was =
erected, which cost=20

eighty thousand hard dollars, although it was made of only bamboo and nipa;=
 with this a large=20

supply of powder was made, but its quality was poor, on account of the impu=
rities in the saltpetre,=20

which they had to obtain from India. There has been talk of building anothe=
r factory (the former=20

one being apparently no longer in existence); it is likely to be as costly =
an enterprise, because the=20

lack of a strong current in the rivers "has rendered impracticable the inst=
allation of hydraulic=20

machinery." The Spanish government ought to take measures to provide the la=
rge amount of=20

powder needed for the use of the forts, army, navy, and revenue service. Be=
rnaldez advises that=20

this be done by making contracts (with either Spaniards or foreigners), by =
which they can secure=20

powder of better quality and at lower prices; and besides this they ought t=
o send immediately to=20

the islands a scientist (whose salary ought to be paid from the funds of th=
e Economic Society and=20

the consulate of commerce)--"whose mission shall be not only to establish i=
n the capital a chair of=20

mineralogy (which is so necessary for exploring the hitherto unknown interi=
or of the islands), but=20

himself to make researches in the provinces of the archipelago for places w=
here the saltpetre can=20

be found--which he will find, without fail." Then gunpowder can be made in =
the islands, and they=20

will be independent in the means for their defense.]    Of the forts of Man=
ila and Cavite  No=20

location like that of Manila could have been selected by the conquistadors =
of the island of Luzon=20

for fortifying themselves and founding the capital of an infant colony. [It=
s position is described, with=20

mention of its earlier fortifications; but these were only suitable for the=
 defense of its inhabitants=20

against piratical attacks. Its present condition is a dangerous one, for it=
s fortifications are unable to=20

withstand a siege by European troops; it has no bomb-proof magazine, and ho=
stile batteries=20

across the Pasig River could easily reduce the city to ashes. Manila is not=
 suitable for a military=20

center, and the efforts of the government ought to be bent toward the forti=
fication of Cavite, which=20

would render that place a first-class fortress; its advantages for this are=
 enumerated in detail, and=20

the ancient grandeur. They have contended with a force more terrible than e=
ver was shot or shell=20

of the cannonier. Thousands are familiar with the views of such massive col=
umns and walls of the=20

Temple of Jupiter as are still standing, eighty-four feet high from base to=
 capital. The marvel is,=20

that after such a succession of fearful quakings there is the slightest sem=
blance of their former=20

condition remaining.  Terrible as these calamities are, not a great deal be=
yond the bare fact is=20

known of many of them. To learn more exactly the dreadful capabilities of t=
his stupendous agent, it=20

is necessary to examine European and South American earthquakes that have c=
ome directly=20

under the observation of scientific men. From these we may learn more parti=
cularly of the details=20

of various fearful shocks.  In all Italy, so famed for its warmth and beaut=
y, there is not a more=20

lovely district than Calabria, which lies in the Southern portion of the pe=
ninsula. Yet no part of Italy=20

has suffered such great calamities. An earthquake in 1693 shook the whole o=
f Calabria and Sicily,=20

totally destroying sixty towns and villages, and not fewer than one hundred=
 thousand people.=20

Eighteen thousand perished at Catania alone. Forty-eight years later a viol=
ent earthquake=20



shattered one hundred and ninety towns in Calabria and completely swallowed=
 up Eufemia,=20

leaving only a stinking lake. But these were before the day of minute scien=
tific observation.  In=20

1783, a series of shocks, unequalled in recent years in violence, began in =
Calabria and continued=20

through four years. The scene was visited and carefully examined by several=
 able men, and from=20

their accounts a fine conception of the whole may be obtained.  The subterr=
anean concussions=20

were felt beyond the confines of Sicily; but if the city of Oppido, in Cala=
bria, be taken as the center,=20

a circle around it, whose radius is twenty-two miles, would include the spa=
ce which suffered the=20

greatest calamities. Within this circle all the towns and villages were alm=
ost entirely destroyed. A=20

radius of seventy-two miles would include the whole region affected.  It wa=
s a calm, hazy day in=20

February, 1783. At a  [Illustration: REMAINS OF ANCIENT HEBREW MASONRY.]  q=
uarter to one=20

o=E2=80=99clock was felt the first shock, which =E2=80=9Cthrew down, in the=
 space of two minutes, a greater part of=20

the houses within the whole space above described. The convulsive motion of=
 the earth is said to=20

have resembled the rolling of the sea, and that in many instances it produc=
ed swimming of the=20

head, like sea-sickness. This rolling of the surface, like the billows of t=
he sea, was like that which=20

would have been produced by the agitation of a vast mass of liquid matter u=
nder the ground.  In=20

some walls which were shattered, the separate stones were parted from the m=
ortar, so as to leave=20

an exact mold where they=20


_
feeble fortifications of Manila and its citadel may be preserved for the pr=
esent, in order to shelter=20

the government and the property of the Spaniards from a sedition; but in ca=
se of war and the=20

landing of an enemy let them be abandoned and destroyed, in order to procee=
d for safety to the=20

impregnable point of Cavite. In this manner will be laid the foundation for=
 the perpetual security of=20

the [Spanish] government in those islands, and for their preservation again=
st all enemies, whether=20

within or without.    Of the piracies of the Moros  Longer tolerance of the=
 piratical raids by the=20

Moros is another cause which in time must compromise our secure possession =
of the islands,=20

through the plundering of their maritime villages and the captivity of thei=
r inhabitants, and the=20

stoppage of the commerce and the coasting trade. Much more is this true bec=
ause some ports of=20

the islands, which are in the possession of those pirates, are already freq=
uented by foreign=20

vessels, which provide the pirates with military supplies and firearms; and=
 it is to be feared that=20

later the foreigners will furnish them with plans, vessels, leaders, and ot=
her aids, like those which=20

they have furnished to the disaffected peoples in the Americas, to wage ste=
ady war on the=20

Spanish government. [The Spanish colony has carried on defensive warfare wi=
th the Moros ever=20

since the conquest, but has gained no permanent advantage therein, while th=
e enemy have=20

increased in numbers and strength, inflicting ravages on the southern provi=
nces that are=20

"continually greater and more scandalous." The Spaniards have spent enormou=
s sums in forts,=20

vessels, and other defenses; but with little though the stone had been care=
fully raised from its bed=20

in a perpendicular direction; but in other instances the mortar was ground =
to powder between the=20

stones, as though they had been made to revolve on each other.  It was foun=
d that the swelling, or=20

wave-like motions, and those which were called _vorticose_, or whirling, of=
ten produced the most=20

singular and unaccountable effects. Thus, in some streets in the town of Mo=
nteleone, every house=20

was thrown down, except one, and in some other streets all but two or three=
;=E2=80=9D and these were left=20

uninjured, though differing in no respect from others. In some houses which=
 were wrecked, deep=20

foundations were thrown clear out of the ground, as though upheaved by a di=
rect lifting.=20

Sometimes very massive buildings escaped; sometimes they suffered most. Obe=
lisks and pillars=20

made in sections showed the effects of the vorticose motion. The separate p=
ortions were partly=20

turned upon each other, without being thrown down.  The number and size of =
the fissures in the=20

soil is astonishing. =E2=80=9CIn many instances, these fissures were so wid=
e, as in an instant to swallow up=20

men, trees, and even houses; and when the earth sunk down again, it closed =
upon them so=20

entirely, as not to leave the least vestige of what had happened, nor were =
any signs of them ever=20

discovered afterwards. In the vicinity of Oppido, the center of these convu=
lsions, many houses=20

were precipitated into the same great fissure, which immediately closed ove=
r them; and,=20

[Illustration: GREAT EARTHQUAKE IN CALABRIA.]  in the same neighborhood, fo=
ur farm-houses,=20

several oilstores and dwelling-houses were so entirely ingulfed that not a =
vestige of them was=20


_
the coasts of Filipinas and the great number of uninhabited places where th=
e pirates can hide=20

themselves from pursuit.] Their vessels, called pancos, are of extraordinar=
y swiftness. The Moros=20

make these of planks lashed together with rattans, without nails or any [ot=
her] ligature. Their masts=20

are three bamboos, their rigging a few pieces of rattan or the bark of tree=
s, their sails are certain=20

petates, or mats, which they call saguran; and their provisions are reduced=
 to the flour made from=20

a tree, called yoro [i.e., sago] and dried shellfish. Nearly all their panc=
os have two banks of oars,=20

and two men for each oar. And with this  In some instances these chasms did=
 not close. In one=20

district a ravine, formed in this manner, a mile long, one hundred feet bro=
ad and thirty feet deep,=20

remained open; and in another a similar one remained, three-quarters of a m=
ile long, one hundred=20

and fifty feet wide, and one hundred feet deep; in another instance there r=
emained such a chasm,=20

thirty feet wide and two hundred and twenty-five feet deep.=E2=80=9D In ano=
ther place a gulf three hundred=20

feet square was left open; again, we are told of one seven hundred and fift=
y feet square. A=20

calcareous mountain, Zefirio, was rent in twain for half a mile. Similar ef=
fects were observed in=20


_
harpoons, javelins, campilans, and arrows (in handling which weapons they a=
re very dextrous),=20

and with their swarming crews--composed of their slaves, who row under the =
lash; and of a=20

multitude of pirates, who thus make their living, and traffic in their boot=
y--they attack, among many,=20

with the odds on their side, surround, and jump aboard, any Christian vesse=
l which cannot defend=20

itself on account of a small crew or the inaccurate firing of its cannon. [=
If they are caught in some=20

bay by ruins devoured by the flames. =E2=80=9CIn various places the ground =
sunk down, and lakes were=20

formed, which, being fed by springs, have remained ever since. The convulsi=
ons also removed=20

immense masses of earth from the sides of steep hills into the valleys belo=
w; so that, in many=20

instances, oaks, olive-orchards, vineyards and cultivated fields, were seen=
 growing at the bottoms=20
