ward the example of citizens who made a law for the defence of their city, =
that no one, under pain of death, should mount the is usually scarcely any =
hemorrhage after the first two to four hours. This applies also to subcutan=
eous hemorrhages or ecchymoses. These post-mortem hemorrhages are passive a=
nd not active, consequently there is less infiltration of blood into the su=
rrounding tissues, which _
justifiable cause for it, no punishment, but remuneration, should follow.  =
=E2=80=98With regard to that part of=20

the argument which says, =E2=80=98Quod hominem homini insidiari nefas est, =
et qu=C3=A6 magis insidiatur=20

homini,=E2=80=99 &c. it alludes to a tyrant who is continually practising t=
he death of his king and sovereign=20

lord. =E2=80=98Et homo est nefas, et perditio, et iniquitas.=E2=80=99 As fo=
r him who slays a man, by watching a=20

=E2=80=98nefas,=E2=80=99 but acquits himself of his duty toward his the mar=
ks of the jets of blood about the wound or=20

on the clothes or surrounding objects. When a large vessel has been divided=
 and the exit for the=20

blood is free, this may run off without infiltrating the tissues or even st=
aining the edges to any=20

considerable extent, and there may remain but little in the wound. In the c=
ase of lacerated and=20

contused wounds the amount of hemorrhage is less, but rarely fails entirely=
, and if the wound is in=20

a vascular part it is liable to cause death from hemorrhage, though a whole=
 limb may possibly be=20

torn off=20

=E2=80=98Et homo est nefas, et perditio, et iniquitas;=E2=80=99 and therefo=
re he who kills such an one, by watching a=20

proper opportunity, does it to save the life of his king.  =E2=80=98In rega=
rd to that passage which says, =E2=80=98Non=20

facias aliis, &c. alterum non l=C3=A6dere,=E2=80=99 &c. I reply, that it ma=
kes against the tyrant, and in favour of=20

him who slays him; for he (the tyrant) does against his king that which he =
would not have to be=20

done against himself, =E2=80=98et ipsum regem injuriatur et l=C3=A6dit.=E2=
=80=99 For which reason, he who has put to=20

death such a person, according to his deserts, has done nothing contrary to=
 the laws, but has=20

preserved the meaning of them, namely, true equity and loyalty towards his =
king and sovereign=20

lord.  =E2=80=98To the other quotation from the laws that says, =E2=80=98Ho=
minem occidere, capitale esse omnis=20

usus armorum,=E2=80=99 &c. I answer, that there are no laws nor usages so v=
ery general but that there may=20

be some exceptions made from them. I say, that the case of killing a tyrant=
 is exempted, more=20

especially when he is guilty of the crimes before mentioned. How can any gr=
eater cause of=20

exemption be shewn than that, when the murder is done through necessity, to=
 save the king from=20

being put to death?  =E2=80=98Even when conspiracies against his royal pers=
on have been so far found=20

clots of blood adhering to the edges of the lacerated wound and the ends of=
 the vessels. In=20

contusions where there is no wound of the skin the blood is prevented from =
flowing externally, and=20

its accumulation and distribution form an ecchymosis. Here again we see the=
 active power of the=20

hemorrhage which infiltrates between the tissues, stains them deeply, and a=
ppears either as a=20

mere stain or in fine clots incorporated, as it were, with the tissues or p=
artly occupying a cavity=20

formed by an extensive displacement of the surrounding parts. The amount of=
 blood varies under=20

the same conditions as in incised wounds, and also according to the greater=
 or less disintegration=20

of the tissues by the blow, allowing a larger or smaller central cavity to =
be formed. In =E2=80=9Cbleeders=E2=80=9D the=20

amount of the hemorrhage does not vary under the normal conditions, but a f=
atal hemorrhage may=20

occur from a very insignificant wound. After hemorrhage from a wound made d=
uring life the veins=20

are empty about the wound, especially those situated centripetally, while n=
ormally after death the=20

blood is mostly aggregated in the veins. They are the source of post-mortem=
 hemorrhage, but do=20

not empty themselves to any great extent.  The _hemorrhage from a wound mad=
e after=20

administering justice; and the tyrant being found deserving of that punishm=
ent, the king, from=20

weakness of intellect, cannot, or will not, punish him, the killing of him,=
 in such cases, is not=20

against the law, properly speaking, for all laws have two meanings: the fir=
st is the textual=20

signification, the other is the =E2=80=98quo animo,=E2=80=99=E2=80=94the pe=
rson committing a the blood remains fluid as in=20

the cases mentioned above, _i.e._, after death from drowning or asphyxia or=
 after the=20

commencement of putrefaction. Otherwise the amount of hemorrhage decreases =
with the length of=20

time after death, until the blood loses its fluidity and hemorrhage no long=
er occurs. In general, it is=20
