consult the chaplain of the prison or the pastor of his particular denomination in regard to spiritual 

matters is always accorded the utmost liberty to do so. The chaplains also attend the sick in the 

prison hospital and conduct the burial services of the unfortunates who die in prison. Upon 

entering the chapel the men take their places on the benches and must remain seated, with their 

arms folded and eyes to the front. When it is necessary to arise the deputy warden gives a signal 

and also when to be seated. The benches contain hymn books, and all prisoners are permitted the 

privilege of joining in the singing.                                  THE DINING ROOM    Two of the inmates' 

dining rooms are located just above the officers' kitchen and beneath the prison chapel. The 

population of the prison, however, has increased so rapidly during the past few years that it was 

found necessary to make room for the overflow in the chapel and mess room opposite the officers' 

kitchen. One of the rooms in the main dining hall is devoted to first-grade prisoners and the other 

to the second grade.  Entering the dining room, the prisoner promptly takes his seat and remains 

with his arms folded until the signal to eat is given by the deputy warden. There are six waiters in 

each dining room, and it is their business to see that the men are promptly served. Some pass 

nothing but bread, others coffee or water, and the rest attend to distributing the miscellaneous 

items on the bill of fare. Talking is forbidden in the dining room at all times. The food is very plain, 

but wholesome, and there is always plenty of it. The following bills of fare, one for the winter 

months and the other for summer, will give an idea of the food served. They were selected from 

the house steward's records and are authentic copies for that date:    PRISONERS' BILL OF

grade only. Items in small caps are served to the first grade only. Third-grade prisoners are 

required to eat in their cells and are not allowed in the dining room while in that grade.  On 

holidays, especially Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years, an excellent meal is served to every 

inmate in the institution, and they are allowed on all legal holidays to spend three hours in the 

prison park where they are given the privilege of talking.                               THE IMPLEMENT 

FACTORY   At present, although still in embryo, there is in the Stillwater penitentiary a factory 

devoted exclusively to the manufacture of rakes, mowers and binders, but this branch is just 

emerging from the experimental stage and may require a year or two to reach a scale large 

enough to supply the needs of the Minnesota farmers.  This factory is in charge of Supt. Downing, 

an experienced machine man, with years of experience in this kind of work. At present all 

preliminary work is being carried out and field tasks made with the machines. These machines had 

to be constructed along entirely new lines so as not to infringe patent rights controlled by the 

harvester trust. An appropriate name has been chosen for the binders,--"The Minnesota."  The 

legislature of this state has been very liberal in supplying the farmers with cheap twine, rakes, 

mowers and binders, and, it is presumed that as soon as some trust controls the price of wagons 

these, too, will be made by convict labor at greatly reduced prices.                                   PRISON 

LIBRARY   The inmates of the Minnesota State Prison have a fine library of about 6,000 volumes 

at their disposal, and it is well patronized. The books have been carefully selected, and enclosed; 

but the Juices being press'd and boil'd, will ripen and become pleasant. In my _New 

Improvements of Planting and Gardening,_ I have given large Directions for making of Wine of 

Grapes, and in this, have also given variety of Receipts for making of Wines of Fruits of our own 

growth; from whence we may learn the Use of boiling Juices of Fruits, and what will require 

fermenting by Yeast, and what do not. You will find that such Wines as are boiled with Sugar, are 

to be fermented with Yeast; and such as have Raisins for their foundation, will ferment in some 

measure of themselves. And especially observe, that while any Liquor is fermenting, the Vessel it 

is enclosed in must be kept open till it has quite done working; for if we should stop it up before 

that Action is over, it will certainly burst the Vessel; or if it has room enough, will turn sour, and be 

always thick and troubled. Again, all Wines, and other Liquors, must be stopt close as soon as 

they have done working, or else the Liquors will grow flat and dead. Some Wines will ferment six 

Weeks or two Months after they are in the Vessel, as one may know by the hissing noise which 



they make; but when that is done, then the ferment is over, and they should be closed up. But 

some Wines will ferment much longer than two Months, and then it is a sign that they stand too 

hot; then they must be put in a cooler place, or the outside of the Vessel frequently cool'd or 

refresh'd with Water, which will stop the ferment. Again, some will not ferment as they ought to do, 

and then they must be set in warmer places, which will raise the ferment.  In very bad Years we 

may help our Wines with a small quantity of Sugar, perhaps a Pound to a Gallon of Juice, to boil 

together; but whether we add Sugar or no, we must be sure to take the Scum off the Wines as it 

rises when they are boiling.  In the colder Climates, we ought not to press the Grapes so close as 

they do in the hot Countries, because in the colder parts of the World, and in places the most 

remote from the Sun, the Skins of the Grapes are much thicker, and carry a Sourness in them 

which should not be too much press'd to mix with the richer part of the Grape; but in the hotter 

Climes, the Skins of the Grapes are thin, and the Sourness rectify'd by the Sun, and will bear 

pressing without injuring the finer Juices.  There is one thing which I shall mention with regard to 

the Endeavours that have been used to make Wine in the Island of _St. Helena_; a Place so 

situate, that it lies as a resting-place between these Northern Parts, and the _East-Indies_, and so 

remote from other places, that could there be good Wine made there, it would be of great help and 

assistance to the Ships that sail that way: But I am informed by a curious Gentleman, who has had 

many good Accounts of that Place, that the Vines which have been planted there, are of such 

sorts, as bring the Grapes ripe and rotten on one side of the Bunch, and green on the other at the 

same time, which surely can never make good Wine. But upon enquiry, they are only such sorts of 

Grapes as grow in close Clusters, and therefore the side next the Sun must be ripe much sooner 

than the other; for the Climate there is so violent hot, that there are no Walls used behind them to 

reflect the Heat to ripen the Backs of the Bunches.  Therefore, I suppose that the best way to have 

good Wine made in those Parts, is to furnish that Place with Vines which may bring their Grapes in 

open or loose Bunches, such as the Raisin-grape, and some others, which do not cluster; for then 

the Sun would have an equal effect upon all the Grapes, and good Wine might be made of them: 

But the worthy Gentleman who told me of this, has, I hear, sent to _St. Helena_ a Collection of 

such Grapes as will answer the desired end.  This is likewise the Month when Saffron appears 

above ground; sometimes sooner, sometimes later, according as the Season is earlier or later. 

This Year, 1726, I was in the Saffron Country, and in the beginning of _August_ the Saffron-heads 

or Roots had shut up so long in the flowering part, that the Planters were forced to put them into 

the Ground: I mean, such as were design'd for new Plantations, which is sooner by near a Month 

than they used to sprout, though they lay dry in Heaps, the Weather had so great an effect upon 

them.  About _Littlebury_, _Chesterford_, _Linton_, and some other Places thereabouts, is 

certainly now the greatest Quantity of Saffron of any part of the Kingdom; the famous Place noted 

formerly for it, call'd _Saffron Walden_, being at this time without it. However, the People of the 

Places which I have named, do not forbear bringing it to _Walden_ Market, or driving Bargains 

there for large Quantities of it, tho' the Market at _Linton_ is look'd upon to be much the best. What 

I have said in my _Country Gentleman and Farmer's Monthly Director_, gives ample Inductions for 

the Management of Saffron, but I may here add a word or two more concerning it; which is, that 

considering how many Accidents the Saffron is subject to, that is dry'd upon the common Kilns, by 

the scorching of it by too hot a Fire, and the Unskilfulness of the Dryers; I do not wonder that there 



is so much Saffron spoiled. Where there are unskilful Hands employ'd in the drying part, one ought 

to provide such Kilns for them as are large enough to distribute the Heat moderately, and as 

constant as possible; which may partly be help'd by providing such a Fire as may be constant, and 

not give more Heat at one time than another; for there is a great deal of Judgment in that. I find, 

that by the common way, some Saffron is scorch'd, and some unequally dry'd, for which reason I 

have contriv'd such a Kiln as must necessarily answer the end which is proposed in the drying of 

Saffron; that is, to put it into a state of keeping with its Virtue in it, and to put it out of the danger of 

being scorch'd in the drying. This I shall publish in my _Natural History of_ Cambridgeshire _and_ 

Essex, which will soon appear in the World.  As for the way which is now commonly practised in 

the drying of Saffron, it is, when you have provided a Kiln, such as I have described in my 

_Farmer's Monthly Director_, with a Cloth made of Horse-hair on the top, strain the Hair-cloth 

tight, and lay on two Sheets of Saffron-paper, that is, a sort of Paper made on purpose for that 

Use, which is very large; and prepare a little Vessel with some Small beer, and as many Chives of 

Saffron as will make it of a deep Colour to stand by you; sprinkle over the Paper with a Brush or 

Feather dipt in this Liquor, and spread your Saffron upon it, either in a square or a round Figure, 

about three Inches thick, and cover the Saffron with two Sheets more of the same kind of Paper, 

and lay a woollen Cloth upon them, and over that a Board, which will cover the top of the Kiln: 

view this now and then, till you see that the Steam of the Saffron comes through the upper Papers. 

Then take off the Board and Woollen-cloth, and taking the Papers on each side with your Hands, 

turn the Saffron in the Papers, so that the under-side be uppermost; taking off 


_
"Dead-Eye-Dick" variety have been excluded. Here are many volumes pertaining to history, 

biography, science, art and fiction, bound magazines, poetry, reference books, etc. However, the 

intellectual pabulum mostly preferred by the inmates is fiction and bound magazines. The state 

subscribes for all the best magazines, and, after they have been withdrawn from circulation, they 

are sent to the bindery, bound and later listed in the catalogue ready for reissue among the 

prisoners.  There are two prisoners employed in the library who circulate the books and papers 

among the inmates. The prison has what is known as an "exchange box." All papers and 

magazines subscribed for by inmates are permitted to be exchanged for others. Papers circulate 

ten days from date of issue, and magazines thirty days. For instance, a prisoner subscribes for the 

Weekly Dial; after he has read it he can place five or six of his friends' numbers on the margin 

thereof and then drop it in the exchange box in the morning as he comes down the main stairway 

to work. It is the duty of the librarian to see that such papers and magazines are delivered to the 

room numbers indicated. When the first man has finished the paper he erases his number and 

again places it in the exchange box. This procedure is continued until the last number has been 

reached or until the prescribed limit that it has to circulate has expired.  Every inmate in the 

institution is given a library catalogue and permitted to draw out two books a week. He is his own 

free agent in the selection of books, receiving just what he has ordered on his library slips. These 

slips contain the numbers of the books selected by him and are gathered up by the night guards. If 

an inmate mutilates a book he is denied the privilege of the library.                                 THE 

MIRROR OFFICE   The Prison Mirror, with the exception of the Summary, published at the Elmira 

reformatory, is the oldest institutional paper in the country. It is also the only paper exclusively 

managed by prisoners, all other penal and reformatory periodicals being conducted by a high-

salaried superintendent or else the policy is under the supervision of the chaplain.  The Mirror is 

issued each Thursday, has a circulation of about 1,500, and is distributed free to the inmates of 

the institution, who are permitted to send the same to relatives or friends free of charge The 

subscription price to the general public is $1.00, and it goes to nearly every state in the Union. 

This publication is edited and managed by a prisoner, who has full charge of the printing 

department. Each Wednesday chase proofs of the following day's issue are submitted to the 

warden for approval, but he is rarely called upon to exercise his censorship, as the editor is 

instructed to eliminate all personalities and sensational topics.                        [Editor's Room,

inmate can contribute articles to the Mirror, which, if found satisfactory upon being carefully 

examined by the editor, are published. Quite a number of the inmates are very competent writers, 

contributing regularly to the columns of their home paper.  This bright little publication was founded 

in 1887 by the prisoners.  For the benefit of those who have never seen this paper, we select at 

random the following extracts written by prisoners:  "It makes a batsman hot to have the pitcher 

fan him."  "The only prisoners in this place who have a pull are the barbers."  "A New Year's 

resolution will not keep by preserving it in alcohol."  "The wife of a big-mitt politician always wears 

imported kid gloves."  "When a mouse hoves in sight, a woman acts as if she had rats in her 

garret."  "Sometimes the lady pickpocket will faint in your arms in order to pull your leg."  "It makes 



a man awful hot under the collar to accuse him of having cold feet."  "A Stillwater girl is so modest 

that she cannot take the pajamas off a murphy without blushing."  "A boose fighter usually 

continues to take his little drop until the big drop of--five feet or more."  "In a game of freeze out 

Thanksgiving afternoon I got cold feet when some one raised six windows."  "When a woman 

becomes afflicted with St. Vitus dance it generally goes to her tongue instead of her feet."  "Just 

because a boy can grow a baseball mustache is no reason why a saloon keeper should sell him a 

highball."  "I do not know whether there are any lady 'bugs' in here or not, but there are quite a 

number of the other sex."  " 'Y is the Fourth of July. J is the first, u is the second, l is the third and y 

is the fourth--of July.' Marvelous!"  "Count Boni has taken part in many duels, but the only thing he 

ever killed was down the side of the Saffron that was first next the Fire with a Knife, so that it lie all 

equal. Then cover it as it was at first, and after a little time turn the Saffron as you did before, and 

spread then the upper-side even with a Knife, as you did at first; then sprinkle your Saffron with 

the Brush dipt in the prepared Liquor upon the dry part's of the Cake, and cover it as before; let it 

lie then a little, and turn it as occasion requires, which may be sooner or later, as the Fire in the 

Kiln is quick or slow, minding every time, as you turn it, to sprinkle the dry parts with the Liquor; 

the more it shrinks, the oftner you must turn your Cake of Saffron, minding still to sprinkle the dry 

parts; and when it has shrunk about three fourths of the first thickness, lay a Stone or Weight upon 

the Board at the top of the Kiln, of about seven or eight Pound weight, the Board already being 

about ten or a dozen Pounds; when it is dry enough, take it off the Kiln, and the Paper it was dried 

in will be of good use; remember to keep your Fire gentle and clear. We may note, that a Gatherer 

of Saffron has this Year about ten Pence _per_ Drain, and that about six Pounds, or six Pounds 

and a half of raw Saffron will dry to a Pound; but generally they allow only six Pounds of wet 

Saffron to a Pound of dry Saffron: but that depends upon the Dryers, who sometimes out of a 

Willingness to get Money, do not dry it so much as they ought to do. It is a Rule among the 

Saffron-Planters in _Cambridgeshire,_ that sixteen Quarters of Saffron-Roots, or Heads, will plant 

an Acre; and that a full Acre this Year produces about seventeen or eighteen Pounds of dry 

Saffron, tho' the common rate is about sixteen Pounds.  About this time you have many green 

Melons upon the Vines which will not ripen; and besides, if they would, that Fruit would now be too 

cold for the Stomach: therefore it is advisable to pickle them, to make them imitate Mango's, which 

some prefer before Mango Cucumbers. The following is the Receipt to pickle them.    To pickle 

green Melons, in imitation of Mango.  The Mango is a Fruit brought to us from the _East Indies,_ 

about the Shape and Bigness of a small Melon; it has a large Stone in it, and comes to us in a 

Pickle, which is strong tasted of Garlick, but approved by most People. When we gather Melons 

for this use, we must wash them and cut them, as directed for the Mango Cucumbers, then lay 

them in Salt and Water, shifting the Salt and Water every four and twenty Hours, for nine Days 

successively; after which, take them out and wipe them dry, and put into the inside of each, which 

has been already scraped, the same Ingredients directed for your Mango Cucumbers, and tie 

them up: then boil your Pickle of Vinegar, Bay-Salt, and Spices, with these Mangoes in it; 

scumming it as it rises, and with it a piece of Allum as directed in the Receipt for Mango 

Cucumbers, and afterwards follow that Receipt till your Melons are fit to use.  Now we have Wild-

Ducks fit for the Table, and it is to be noted, that these should not be larded as Land-Fowls, in the 

roasting of them. It must be observed, that they be sent to Table with the Gravey in them; but 



before they are laid down to the Fire, it is practis'd in many places, to chop Onions, the Leaves of 

red Sage, and mix these with Pepper and Salt, to be put in the Belly of the Ducks; and when they 

are brought to Table, pour a Glass of Claret warm'd through the Body of the Ducks, which with 

some Gravey, that must be sent in the Dish, under the Ducks, will make a proper Sauce for them. 

Another agreeable way of eating Ducks, is roasting them, and eating them with boil'd Onions; they 

are sometimes used in Soups, and baked, and they likewise eat very well when they are half 

roasted, and then cut to pieces and stew'd with their own Gravey and Claret.  Now Stubble Geese 

will be in season, after they have been taken up and fed for a Fortnight or thereabouts, in a close 

place, with Barley and Water; but during their Confinement, they must never want Victuals. Note, 

the Barley must have no more Water with it than will just cover it, and they must never have their 

Corn dry. If during the time of their feeding, you happen to let them out to ramble for a few hours, 

they will lose more good Flesh in that time, than they can regain in three Days; therefore when you 

have once put them up, keep them up till they are fit to kill: but if you would have them very fat, put 

them in a Coop for a Week or ten Days before you kill them, and feed them with Barley-Meal and 

Water, made almost as thick as Paste; and always let there be several of them together, for a 

single one will pine, and lose Flesh, instead of increasing it by Eating. As to the dressing of this 

Fowl while it is young, in the Spring, under the Character of a Green-Goose, it is fatted in a Coop 

with Barley-Meal and Water, and being kill'd and scalded when 'tis fat, 'tis roasted and eaten with 

green Sauce, or scalded Goosberries: but being full grown as at this time of the Year, is

"The trial judge hit me so hard that I not only saw stars, but have been seeing stripes ever since 

he landed on me."  "A writer says that there is no room in this country for anarchists. But I think we 

could find room for a few in here."  "The one who cherishes the picture of his or her mother is 

scarcely beyond hope, no matter how far from the narrow path."  "It is admitted that the tariff is the 

mother of trusts, but their papa, like the father of John D. Rockefeller, is clouded in mystery."  "The 

people of Pennsylvania are now convinced that the contractor who built the bootblack stand in the 

capitol is a polished rascal."  "When the courts register a fine against Standard and salted without 

side. Some put an Onion, and some Sage-Leaves into the Body of the Goose, when it is laid down 

to the Fire, and when it is brought to Table, it is serv'd with Apples stew'd and mash'd in a Plate by 

the Side; but for the Sauce in the Dish, there need be none but some Claret heated, and pour'd 

thro' the Body of the Goose, to mix with its own Gravey. Some also salt Geese, and boil them with 

Greens, as with other salt Meat; a Goose may also be bak'd in a Pye to be eaten cold. A Goose is 

to be kill'd, by pulling first the Feathers at the back of the Head, and cutting pretty deep with a 

sharp Penknife, between the back of the Head and the Neck, taking care that it

trainers and Governor Johnson for jockey the meek-eyed mule is apt to show his heels to all 

competitors in the presidential race of 1912."  "Throw a few ponies of whiskey into a young man 

who does not possess horse sense, then arm him with a Colt pistol, and he will make an ass out of 

for that will spoil them: and 'tis to be noted, the Feathers of a full grown Goose are worth four 

Pence to be sold in the Country; this I had from a Gentlewoman in _Surrey._ In _Holland_ they slit 

Geese down the Back, and salt them with Salt-Petre, and other Salt, and then dry them like 

Bacon; they eat very well, if they are boiled tender.         *       *       *       *       *
