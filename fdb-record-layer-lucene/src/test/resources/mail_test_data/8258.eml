governor of the State."  "I know you did; and I said--and I say it again--h=
e isn't going to be--not if=20

we can help it," declared the railway magnate, with emphatic determination.=
  "The methods you=20

will take to defeat him will insure his election, McVickar. You fellows are=
 mighty slow to learn your=20

lesson; mighty slow and obstinate, Hardwick. You don't know anything but wi=
re-pulling and=20

crookedness and bribery. The times have changed, and you haven't had the co=
mmon-sense or=20

the courage or the business shrewdness to change with them. I say Gordon wi=

governor."  Again there was a strained silence like that which follows the =
hand-shake in the prize-

ring when the two antagonists by a lucky chance?" demanded the captain, mor=
e as an argument=20

than as a question to be answered. "You got off by the skin of your teeth; =
and you may thank your=20

stars that you are not shut up at this moment in some dungeon in Mogadore, =
where they don't ask=20

hard questions as to what has become of troublesome Christians. If the shop=
 had not been=20

invaded by creditors, you would have been conveyed to Rosetta, and taken aw=
ay on board the=20

pirate. The rest of the party would not have known what had become of you; =
for we could not find=20

you when we searched for you in Cairo."  "That is all very nice, Captain Sc=
ott," replied Louis,=20

laughing out loud. "I would not have given two cents to have the guard of s=
ailors who made things=20

so sad for the Arabs at Gizeh in the cellar with me. Make as much=20

and are warily watching each for his opening. After the pause the vice-pres=
ident said:  "If we had=20

the safest kind of a majority in both houses of the legislature, we couldn'=
t be sure of accomplishing=20

anything worth while with Gordon in the governor's office; you know that, B=
lount. If Gordon runs=20

and is elected, his platform will be flatly anti-railroad."  "Oh, I don't k=
now," was the calm rejoinder.=20

"Gordon is a mighty square fellow; an honest man and a fair one. If you cou=

and go to him with clean hands--but you couldn't do that, McVickar; you're =
too badly out of=20

practice."  "We needn't go into that phase of it. We are so savagely handic=

decidedly.  "Master of the situation!" exclaimed the captain. "You might as=
 well call the trout the=20

master of the situation after he has the hook in his gills. I don't see it =
in that light."  "I had fired one=20

shot from my revolver, and wounded Mazagan's assistant in the outrage; and =
I had five balls more=20

in the weapon. I think the pirate counted upon the custom-house officers to=
 deprive me of the=20

pistol, or he would not have gone to work just as he did. My shot demoraliz=
