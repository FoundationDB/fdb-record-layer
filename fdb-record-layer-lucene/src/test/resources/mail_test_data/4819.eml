evidently he was not very well and Yvonne after the spark in the clump refe=

should have trusted me, my child," he wrote: and indeed Yvonne could not be=
lieve her eyes. "I had=20

no idea that your happiness was at stake in this marriage, or I should neve=
r have pressed the=20

claims of my own wishes in the matter. I have only you in the world left, n=
ow that misery and exile=20

are to be my portion! Is it likely that I would allow any personal desires =
to weigh against my love=20

for you?"  Happy as she was Yvonne bare necessaries of life, but here you a=
re forced to put off=20

the merritch because our hooses wass burnt, and you are obleeged to wait ti=
ll you get a sort o'=20

palace built, I suppose, and a grand farm set a-goin'."  "Indeed, Fergus, y=
ou touch me on a sore=20

point there, but with all your scorn of luxury, I'm sure you'd be the last =
man to let his sister marry a=20

fellow who could take her only to a hut or a wigwam."  "You are right, Tan.=
=20


_
when she read that letter. How could she have been so blind, so senseless a=
s to misjudge her=20

father so? Her young husband found her in tears, and had much ado to consol=
e her: he too read=20

the letter and was deeply touched by the kind reference to himself containe=
d therein: "My lord=20

Anthony is a gallant gentleman," wrote M. le duc de Kernogan, "he will make=
 you happy, my child,=20

and your old father will be more than satisfied. All that grieves me is tha=
t you did not trust me=20

sooner. A clandestine marriage is not worthy of a daughter of the Kernogans=
."  "I did speak most=20

earnestly to M. le duc," said Lord Tony reflectively, "when I begged him to=
 allow me to pay my=20

addresses to you. But then," he added cheerfully, "I am such a clumsy lout =
when I have to talk at=20

any length--and especially clumsy when I have to plead my own cause. I supp=
ose I put my case=20

so badly before your father, m'dear, that he thought me three parts an idio=
t and would not listen to=20

me."  "I too begged and entreated him, dear," she said with a smile, "but h=
e was very determined=20

then and vowed that I should marry M. Martin-Roget despite my tears and pro=
testations. Dear=20

father! I suppose he didn't realise that I was in earnest."  "He has certai=
nly accepted the inevitable=20

very gracefully," was my lord Tony's final comment.   II  Then they read th=
e letter through once=20

more, sitting close together, he with one arm round her shoulder, she nestl=
ing against his chest,=20

her hair brushing against his lips and with an' a wigwam since I came to Re=
d River.  I wish the=20

place wass more peaceable."  "It will never be more peaceable as long as th=
ere are two rival=20

companies fighting for the furs," said Davidson; "but there's worse than th=
at goin' on, for some of=20

the Indians, it seems, are mad at the agreement made between them and Lord =
Selkirk."  "Wow!=20

that iss a peety.  Where heard ye that?"  "I heard it from La Certe, whose =
wife Slowfoot, you know,=20

is a Cree Indian.  It seems that the Crees have always claimed Red River as=
 their lands; but when=20

Lord Selkirk came to make a treaty with the natives he found some Saulteaux=
 livin' on the soil, an'=20

his lordship, in ignorance, gave them an interest in the treaty, though the=
y were mere visitors--an'=20

indeed don't even claim to be owners of the soil--their lands lying far to =
the east of Red River."=20

"Well," continued Dan, guiding his horse carefully down the next hollow, fo=
r the moon had gone=20

behind a cloud just then, "when the Crees found out what had been done, the=
y were naturally very=20

angry--an' I don't wonder--an' they threaten now to expel the Saulteaux fro=
m Red River altogether,=20

an' the white men along wi' them, unless the names of the Saulteaux chiefs =
are wiped out o' the=20

contract, an' the annual payment made to the Crees alone."  "That iss bad, =
Taniel, ferry bad," said=20

Fergus, as they reached the bottom of the hollow and began to ascend the su=
cceeding undulation,=20

"an' I am all the more sorry to hear it because our goot frund Okematan is=
=20


_
she could scarcely read for the tears of joy which filled her eyes.  "I don=
't feel very well to-day," the=20

letter concluded; "the dampness and the cold have got into my bones: moreov=
er you two young=20

love birds will not desire company just yet, but to-morrow if the weather i=
s more genial I will drive=20

over to Combwich in the afternoon, and perhaps you will give me supper and =
a bed Cree."  "Ay,=20

Fergus, he is a great chief of the Crees, and a man of considerable influen=
ce among his people.  I=20

should not like to have him for an enemy."  "Stop!" said Fergus in a whispe=
r at that moment, laying=20

his hand on Davidson's arm.  Dan drew rein at once and looked at his friend=
, but could not clearly=20

see his face, for the moon was still behind thick drifting clouds.  They=20


_
will forthwith return to Bath if this will be agreeable to you both."  Coul=
d anything be more=20

adorable, more delightful? It was just the last drop that filled Yvonne's c=
up of happiness right up to=20

the brim.   III  The next afternoon she sat at her desk in order to tell La=
dy Blakeney all about it. She=20

made out a copy of her father's letter and put that in with her own, and be=
gged dear Lady=20

Blakeney to see Lady Ffoulkes forthwith and tell her all that had happened.=
 She herself was=20

expecting her father every minute and milor Tony had gone as far as the gat=

barouche was in sight.  ascending, to be able to see over it, and Dan could=
 perceive by the=20

outstretched neck of his companion that he was gazing intently at something=
 directly in front.=20

"What do you see, Fergus?" he asked in a low voice.  "Do you see nothin', T=
aniel?" was the=20

Highlander's reply.  "Why, yes.  I see the plains stretching away to the ho=
rizon--an' dark enough=20

they are, too, at this moment.  I also see a few small clumps that look lik=
e bushes here an' there."=20

"Don't you see the clump that's nearest to you--right foment your nose?" sa=
id the other.  "Of=20

course I do," and he stopped abruptly, for at that=20
