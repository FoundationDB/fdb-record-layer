philodendron monstera Scott's historical novels that his impartiality is most severely tried and is most apparent; though it is apparent in all his works. Shakespeare was a pure dramatist; nothing but art found a home in that lofty, smooth, idealistic brow. He stands apart not only from the philodendron monstera Scott's historical novels that his impartiality is most severely tried and is most apparent; though it is apparent in all his works. Shakespeare was a pure dramatist; nothing but art found a home in that lofty, smooth, idealistic brow. He stands apart not only from the _
ranks of ex-slaves who can give a clear picture of life "befo' de wah."  She was born in Jones 

County, Georgia of Martha and Pleasant Lowe, who were slaves of William Lowe. The mother was 

the mulatto offspring of William Lowe and a slave woman who was half Cherokee. The father was 

also a mulatto, purchased from a nearby plantation.  Because of this blood mixture Rebecca's 

parents were known as "house niggers," and lived on quarters located in the rear of the "big 

house." A "house nigger" was a servant whose duties consisted of chores around the big house, 

such as butler, maid, cook, stableman, gardner and personal attendant to the man who owned 

him.  These slaves were often held in high esteem by their masters and of course fared much 

better than the other slaves on the plantation. Quite often they were mulattoes as in the case of 

Rebecca's parents. There seemed to be a general belief among slave owners that mulattoes said 

that Scott is thoroughly ideal as well as thoroughly real? There are vague traditions that this man 

and the other was the original of some character in Scott. But who can point out the man of whom 

a character in Scott is a mere portrait? It would be as hard as to point out a case of servile 

delineation in Shakespeare. Scott's characters are never monsters or caricatures. They are full of 

nature; but it is universal nature. Therefore they have their place in the universal heart, and will 

keep that place for ever. And mark that even in his historical novels he is still ideal. Historical 

romance is a perilous thing. The fiction is apt to spoil the fact, and the fact the fiction; the history to 

be perverted and the romance to be shackled: daylight to kill dreamlight, and dreamlight to kill 

daylight. But Scott takes few liberties with historical facts and characters; he treats them, with the 

costume and the manners of the

not stand as much laborious work as pure blooded Negro slaves. This accounts probably for the 

fact that the majority of ex-slaves now alive are mulattoes.  The Lowes were originally of Virginia 

and did not own as much property in Georgia as they had in Virginia. Rebecca estimates the 

number of slaves on this plantation as numbering no more than 25.  They were treated kindly and 

cruelly by turns, according to the whims of a master and mistress who were none too The 

personages with whom he deals freely, are the Peverils and the Nigels; and these are his lawful 

property, the offspring of his own imagination, and belong to the ideal.  III. _The Lamp of 

Impartiality_.--The novelist must look on humanity without partiality or prejudice. His sympathy, like 

that of the historian, must be unbounded, and untainted by sect or party. He must see everywhere 

the good that is mixed with evil, the evil that is mixed with good. And this
