dracaena marginata too hard. Mr. Merrimac may come through later on. As for his claim that the money box belongs to him--well, I don't know what to think about that."  "It's probably just another fake claim," Brad declared.  "Was he able to tell the amount books I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us dracaena marginata too hard. Mr. Merrimac may come through later on. As for his claim that the money box belongs to him--well, I don't know what to think about that."  "It's probably just another fake claim," Brad declared.  "Was he able to tell the amount books I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us _
as if he's scared."  Apparently reassured to see that the two at the door were boys, the elderly 

man opened it a few inches.  "Good morning, Mr. Merrimac," greeted Brad, doffing his cap.  The 

old man relaxed somewhat. Though appearing none too pleased to see visitors, he grudgingly 

opened the door a little wider.  "I guess you didn't hear the bell at first," Dan said pleasantly. "Or 

maybe it's out of order."  "The bell's in good order," Mr. Merrimac muttered. "So are my ears. I'd 

have come sooner only--one never knows who's at the door. Since my butler left a week ago, I've 

had an unpleasant time of it. Only the other night--but never mind. You wanted to see me?" 

"We're here in behalf of the church building fund," Brad explained. "Your name is on our list of 

prospects."  "Seems as if my name is on every list of prospects," the old man retorted. "Seems like 

every time I turn around it's, 'Mr. Merrimac, will you contribute five dollars for this? Mr. Merrimac, 

will you donate ten dollars for that?'"  Brad and Dan exchanged an uneasy glance. Obviously, their 

prospect was not in the best of moods. It might take super salesmanship to gain his pledge.  "May 

we come in for a few minutes to talk about it?" Brad requested.  "I'm busy this morning. With my 

butler gone, I have to prepare my own lunch, and I'm no hand at it."  "We won't take much of your 

time, Mr. Merrimac," Dan urged.  "Oh, all right, come in," the old man consented. "I warn you 

though, you must come directly to the point. I haven't felt well lately, and it makes me nervous to 

hear a lot of chatter."  Brad and Dan followed their unwilling host into the living room.  The 

evidence was overpowering that Mr. Merrimac lived alone. Although the room was well furnished, 

everything was covered with dust.  Newspapers had been dropped where read. Cigar ashes 

littered the rugs. Blinds which were three-quarters lowered, gave the entire room a gloomy 

atmosphere.  "I had a bad scare the other night," Mr. Merrimac said, picking up a book so that Dan 

could seat himself on the sofa. "Someone tried to break in."  "You live here by yourself?" Brad 

inquired.  "I do since Hayes left me. He was my butler. Said he could make more than I was 

paying. So the ungrateful scoundrel quit on three days notice. I've been unable to find anyone to 

take his place."  "You have had your troubles," Brad said. "Maybe you'd rather we came back 

some other day."  "No, we may as well get this over with," the old man sighed. "If my name is on 

the list, I'll be pestered until I give 'em something. How much am I down for? Ten dollars?"  Brad 

let him have it straight.  "Five hundred, Mr. Merrimac."  "Five hundred!" The elderly man's voice 

rose to an indignant screech. "What do they think I am? A wealthy man?"  "I believe you 

contributed that much last year to the Community Chest," Brad said, consulting a memorandum on 

the back side of the pledge card. "The church really needs snow, when the whole country is 

stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron. We agreed that no one who had not grown up in a little 

prairie town could know anything about it. It was a kind of freemasonry, we said.  Although Jim 

Burden and I both live in New York, and are old friends, I do not see much of him there. He is legal 

counsel for one of the great Western railways, and is sometimes away from his New York office for 

weeks together. That is one reason why we do not often meet. Another is that I do not like his wife. 

When Jim was still an obscure young lawyer, struggling to make his way in New York, his career 

was suddenly advanced by a brilliant marriage. Genevieve Whitney was the only daughter of a 

distinguished man. Her marriage with young Burden was the subject of sharp comment at the 

time. It was said she had been brutally jilted by her cousin, Rutland Whitney, and that she married 

this unknown man from the West out of bravado. She was a restless, headstrong girl, even then, 

who liked to astonish her friends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing something 



unexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage headquarters, produced one of her 

own plays at the Princess Theater, was arrested for picketing during a garment-makers' strike, etc. 

I am never able to believe that she has much feeling for the causes to which she lends her name 

and her fleeting interest. She is handsome, energetic, executive, but to me she seems 

unimpressionable and temperamentally incapable of enthusiasm. Her husband's quiet tastes 

irritate her, I think, and she finds it worth while to play the patroness to a group of young poets and 

painters of advanced ideas and mediocre ability. She has her own fortune and lives her own life. 

For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden.  As for Jim, no disappointments have 

been severe enough to chill his naturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though 

it often made him seem very funny when he was a boy, has been one of the strongest elements in 

his success. He loves with a personal passion the great country through which his railway runs 

and branches. His faith in it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its 

development. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in Wyoming or Montana, and 

has helped young men out there to do remarkable things in mines and timber and oil. If a young 

man with an idea can once get Jim Burden's attention, can manage to accompany him when he 

goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which 

means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams. 

Though he is over forty now, he meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by 

which his boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color 

and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those

"It certainly does," added Dan. "The heating plant is shot and a good stiff wind might blow the 

building over!"  Mr. Merrimac permitted himself a tight, half-amused smile. "It's hardly that bad, 

Dan," he said. "I'll admit though, that we need a new church. The cause is a worthy one."  "Then 

how much may we put you down for?" Brad asked, taking out a fountain pen.  "I'm not prepared to 

make any pledge at this time."  "But Mr. Merrimac, you're our best prospect--"  "I hate to disappoint 

you, Brad," Mr. Merrimac said soberly. "I honestly do. The truth is, I've had rather distressing 

business losses recently. I can't afford to make a pledge at this time."  Brad and Dan were at a 

loss for an argument. Mr. Hatfield had warned them that Mr. Merrimac might be inclined to whittle 

down the five hundred dollar pledge. But even the Cub leader had not expected such stiff 

resistance as this.  "How much have you lost?" Dan inquired. After speaking, he realized that the 

question was a very personal one.  "Several thousand," Mr. Merrimac answered shortly. "It was 

stolen from my library. I kept the money in a metal box locked in a desk."  "A metal box!" Dan 

exclaimed. "Oh, can you beat that!"  "I'm sure I don't understand," said Mr. Merrimac in perplexity. 

"You must have heard about the Cubs finding a money box at the church," Brad replied quietly. He 

was watching the elderly man very closely, wondering whether or not he might be acting a part. 

"The Cubs found a money box? My box?"  "We don't know whose box it is," Brad said. "That's for 

the police to decide."  Mr. Merrimac had grown rather excited. "If you found a box at the church it 

must have been the one that was stolen from me!"  "If you can prove your claim, you're welcome 

to it," Brad returned, arising to leave. "It's only fair to warn you though, that two other persons 

already have said it belongs to them."  Mr. Merrimac pursued the boys to the door. Eagerly he 

plied them for more information. Dan and Brad, however, were in no mood to be pumped.  "You'll 

have to see Mr. Hatfield or the police about it," Brad told him firmly. "It's none of our affair. We 

merely came here in the interests of the building fund campaign."  "Oh, yes, the building fund," the 

old man recalled. "Boys, if you'll help me recover my money, I'll make it right with you. I'll pledge 

the five hundred dollars. I might even give more."  Brad and Dan had reached the end of their 

patience.  "Thanks, Mr. Merrimac," Dan said dryly. "We'll remember."  Scarcely bidding the old 

man goodbye, the two Cubs hurriedly left the house.  Once beyond hearing, they gave vent to 

their feelings.  "Three claimants now!" Dan exclaimed. "This positively is the last straw!"  "We 

come here to get a pledge from old Money Bags, and what does he do?" Brad added. "Why, he 

turns around and tries to file claim to the money box. I give up!"                                    CHAPTER 7 

The Last Straw   Discouragement weighed heavily upon Dan and Brad as they left Mr. Merrimac's 

home.  The bakery owner had been their No. 1 his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as 

youthful as it is Western and American.  During that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our 

talk kept returning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known long ago and whom 

both of us admired. More than any other person we remembered, this girl seemed to mean to us 

the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood. To speak her name was to call 

up pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one's brain. I had lost sight of her 

altogether, but Jim had found her again after long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a 

great deal to him, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that friendship. His 

mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again, feel her presence, revived all my old 

affection for her.  "I can't see," he said impetuously, "why you have never written anything about 

Antonia."  I told him I had always felt that other people--he himself, for one--knew her much better 



than I. I was ready, however, to make an agreement with him; I would set down on paper all that I 

remembered of Antonia if he would do the same. We might, in this way, get a picture of her.  He 

rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often announces a new 

determination, and I could see that my suggestion took hold of him. "Maybe I will, maybe I will!" he 

declared. He stared out of the window for a few moments, and when he turned to me again his 

eyes had the sudden clearness that comes from something the mind itself sees. "Of course," he 

said, "I should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It's through myself 

that I knew and felt her, and I've had no practice in any other form of presentation."  I told him that 

how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had 

opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not.    Months afterward Jim 

Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio 

sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with 

some pride as he stood warming his hands.  "I finished it last night--the thing about Antonia," he 

said. "Now, what about yours?"  I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling 

notes.  "Notes? I did n't make any." He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. "I did n't 

arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia's 

name recalls to me. I suppose it has n't any form. It has n't any title, either." He went into the next 

room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, "Antonia." He 

frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it "My Antonia." That seemed to 

satisfy him.  "Read it as soon as you can," he said, rising, "but don't let it influence your own story." 

My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim's manuscript, substantially as he 

brought it to me. 


_
from him they knew the Den never could make a good showing in the solicitation.  "Mr. Hatfield 

gave us Mr. Merrimac's name because he thought we were the best collectors," Brad said in 

disgust. "Well, we muffed it."  "We caught him in a bad mood," Dan replied, equally sunk in gloom. 

"Do you think the old cod really lost money as he claimed? Or was it just another trick?"  "Search 

me, Dan. It's a cinch three persons couldn't have lost that cash. The whole thing is fantastic."  "I 

almost wish we hadn't found that box, Brad."  "So do I. It's going to make a peck of trouble. Well, 

what do we do now? Report to Mr. Hatfield?"  "May as well. He ought to know about Mr. 

Merrimac's claim, even if it should prove phoney."  The boys found the Cub leader in his front 

yard, raking leaves. Leaning on his rake, he listened attentively to their account of what had 

happened at Mr. Merrimac's place.  "It's a bad break not getting      BOOK I-- THE SHIMERDAS 

I   I FIRST heard of Antonia(1) on what seemed to me an interminable journey across the great 

midland plain of North America. I was ten years old then; I had lost both my father and mother 

within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in 

Nebraska. I traveled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the "hands" on my 

father's old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather. 

Jake's experience of the world was not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway 

train until the morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world.  We went all the 

way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought 

everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and 

for me a "Life of Jesse James," which I
