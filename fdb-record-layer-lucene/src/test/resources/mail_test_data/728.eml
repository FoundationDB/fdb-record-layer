philodendron monstera have just named differ totally from that of La Peca, and from the poison of Lamas and of Moyobamba. I enter into these details because the vestiges of plants which we were able to examine, proved to us (contrary to the common opinion) that the three poisons of the Ticunas, philodendron monstera have just named differ totally from that of La Peca, and from the poison of Lamas and of Moyobamba.

with the soldiers that was the talk of the town. His game was a tug of war. He announced that he 

would give fifty dollars to any soldier who could withstand him. The strong man sat the soldier 

down on the floor, foot to foot before him. Both grasped a pole, and it was the strong man's "act" 

to throw the soldier the different poisons sold by the same name at the Orinoco and the Amazon 

are identical, and derived from the same plants. Orfila, therefore, in his excellent work On Poisons, 

has very judiciously separated the wourali of Dutch Guiana, the curare of the Orinoco, the ticuna 

of the Amazon, and all those substances which have been too vaguely united under the name of 

American poisons. Possibly at some

from Canada, from South Africa, from Morocco, from China, from and strychnia, will be found in 

poisonous plants belonging to different genera.  At the Orinoco the curare de raiz (of the root) is

we learned to distinguish the poisons of the Ticuna, Yagua, Peva, and Xibaro Indians, which being 

all obtained from the same plant, perhaps differ only by a more or less careful preparation. The

strong man didn't fudge a little, pinch the favourite son's hands on the pole and make him let go, 

almost every night the strong man would be worsted. The struggle sets the house yelling. It is the 

only real drama in Paris. We noticed that the shows of Paris which appealed to the eyes and ears 

were far below the American standard. In comedy which appeals to something behind much 

celebrity in Europe, and which somewhat improperly begins to bear the name of ticuna, is 

extracted from a liana which grows in the island of Mormorote, on the Upper Maranon. This poison 

is employed partly by the Ticunas, who remain independent on the Spanish territory near the 

sources of the Yacarique; and partly by Indians of the same tribe, inhabiting the Portuguese
