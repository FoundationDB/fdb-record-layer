If the story of Adams's Administration could be told in detail, it would be=
 one long record of=20

rancorous warfare between the President and the Jacksonian opposition in Co=
ngress. Adams, on=20

the one hand, held inflexibly to his course, advocating policies and recomm=
ending measures=20

which he knew had not the remotest chance of adoption; and, on the other ha=

which in the last two years of the Administration controlled the Senate as =
well as the House of=20

Representatives--balked at no act that would humiliate the President and ma=
ke capital for its=20

western idol. At the outset the Jacksonians tried to hold up the confirmati=
on of Clay. It fell furiously,=20

and quite without discrimination, upon the President's great scheme of nati=
onal improvements,=20

professing to see in it evidence of an insatiable desire for "concentration=
." In the discussion of a=20

proposed amendment to the Constitution providing for direct election of the=
 President by the=20

people it was constantly assumed and frequently stated that Adams had no mo=
ral right to the=20

position which he occupied. The President's decision to send delegates to t=
he Panama Congress=20

of 1826 raised a storm of acrimonious debate and brought the Administration=
's enemies into closer=20

unison. To cap the climax, Adams was solemnly charged with abuse of the fed=
eral patronage, and=20

in the Senate six bills for the remedy of the President's pernicious practi=
ces were brought in by=20

Benton in a single batch! Adams was able and honest, but he got no world, a=
nd false of my=20

promise."  All was made ready for the voyage, and la Belle Iseut was commit=

Tristan: "a fairer couple or one more meet for marriage had no man seen." S=
he was accompanied=20

into the strange land by her gentlewoman, dame Brangian, to whom the Queen =
of Ireland had=20

given a powerful love philtre to be administered to the husband and wife on=
 the wedding day:=20

whoso drank of that philtre with another, should love that other with a lov=
e that knows no ending.=20

By a fatal error, it was to Tristan and Iseut that the philtre was given du=
ring the voyage; and from=20

that time an invincible passion drew them toward each other. Love so overma=
stered Tristan that=20

he was false to his knightly vows, false to the trust imposed, and yet happ=

betrothed of King Mark. And Iseut returned his love, and moaned at the thou=

generally suggests fresh complications. In this case it was arranged that t=

Brangian, should personate the bride at night, trusting that King Mark, fud=
