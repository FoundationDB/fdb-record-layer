dracaena marginata one spiritual deed, or potentiality to serve as a thread=

 thinking moral nature=20

being grafted on our Divine Triune Monad, Atma-Buddhi-Manas, the three in o=
ne and one in three=20

(aspects). For the Monad manifested on earth by the incarnating Ego is that=
 which question.=20

"Friend Porthos," said D'Artagnan, handing the letter to him, "this time, a=
t least, you are sure of=20

your title of baron, and I of my captaincy. Read for yourself and judge."  =
Porthos took the letter and=20

with a trembling voice read the following words:  "The queen wishes to spea=
k to Monsieur=20

d'Artagnan, who must follow the bearer."  "Well!" exclaimed Porthos; "I=20


_
only be approached by eating the fruit of knowledge, the Knowledge of Good =
and Evil, or of=20

GNOSIS, Divine Wisdom.  In the Esoteric teachings, this Ego is the fifth Pr=
inciple in man. But the=20

student who has read and understood the first two Papers, knows something m=
ore. He is aware=20

that the seventh is not a human, but a universal Principle in which man par=
ticipates; but so does=20

equally every physical and subjective atom, and also every blade of grass a=
nd everything that=20

lives or is in Space, whether it be sensible of it or not. He knows, moreov=
er, that if man is more=20

closely connected with it, and assimilates it with a hundredfold more power=
, it is simply because=20

he is endowed with the highest consciousness on this earth; that man, in sh=
ort, may become a=20

Spirit, a Deva, or a God, in his next transformation, whereas neither a sto=
ne nor a vegetable, nor=20

an animal, can do so before they become men in their proper turn.  (2) Now =
what are the functions=20

of Buddhi? On this plane it has none, unless it is united with Manas, the c=
onscious Ego. Buddhi=20

stands to the divine Root Essence in the same relation as Mulaprakriti to P=
arabrahman, in the=20

Vedanta School; or as Alaya the Universal Soul to the One Eternal Spirit, o=
r that which is beyond=20

Spirit. It is its human vehicle, one remove from that Absolute, which can h=
ave no relation whatever=20

to the finite and the conditioned.  (3) What, again, is Manas and its funct=
ions? In its purely=20

metaphysical aspect, Manas, though one remove on the downward plane from Bu=
ddhi, is still so=20

immeasurably higher than the physical man, that it cannot enter into direct=
 relation with the=20

personality, except through its reflection, the lower mind. Manas is _Spiri=
tual Self-Consciousness_=20

in itself, and Divine Consciousness when united with Buddhi, which is the t=
rue "producer" of that=20

"production" (vikara), or Self-Consciousness, through Mahat. Buddhi-Manas, =
therefore, is entirety=20

unfit to manifest during its periodical incarnations, except through the hu=
man mind or lower=20

Manas. Both are linked together and are inseparable, and can have as little=
 to do with the lower=20

Tanmatras,(845) or rudimentary atoms, as the homogeneous with the heterogen=
eous. It is,=20

therefore, the task of the lower Manas, or thinking personality, if it woul=
d blend itself with its God,=20

the Divine Ego, to dissipate and paralyze the Tanmatras, or properties of t=
he material form.=20

Therefore, Manas is shown double, as the Ego and Mind of Man. It is Kama-Ma=
nas, or the lower=20

Ego, which, deluded into a notion of independent existence, as the "produce=
r" in its turn and the=20

sovereign of the five Tanmatras, becomes _Ego-ism_, the selfish Self, in wh=
ich case it has to be=20

considered as Mahabhutic and finite, in the sense of its being connected wi=
th Ahankara, the=20

personal "I-creating" faculty. Hence       Manas has to be regarded as eter=
nal and non-eternal;=20

eternal in     its atomic nature (paramanu rupa), as eternal  "But I see mu=
ch that is very=20

extraordinary in it," replied D'Artagnan. "It is evident, by their sending =
for me, that matters are=20

becoming complicated. Just reflect a little what an agitation the queen's m=
ind must be in for her to=20

have remembered me after twenty years."  "It is true," said Porthos.  "Shar=
pen your sword, baron,=20

load your pistols, and give some corn to the horses, for I will answer for =
it, something lightning-like=20

will happen ere to-morrow."  "But, stop; do you think it can be a trap that=
 they are laying for us?"=20

suggested Porthos, incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome t=
o inferior people.  "If=20

it is a snare," replied D'Artagnan, "I shall scent it out, be assured. If M=
azarin is an Italian, I am a=20

Gascon."  And D'Artagnan dressed himself in an instant.  Whilst Porthos, st=
ill in bed, was hooking=20

on his cloak for him, a second knock at the door was heard.  "Come in," exc=
laimed D'Artagnan;=20

and another servant entered.  "From His Eminence, Cardinal Mazarin," presen=
ting a letter.=20

D'Artagnan looked at Porthos.  "A complicated affair," said Porthos; "where=
 will you begin?"  "It is=20



arranged capitally; his eminence expects me in half an hour."  "Good."  "My=
 friend," said=20

D'Artagnan, turning to the servant, "tell his eminence that in half an hour=
 I shall be at his=20

command."  "It is very fortunate," resumed the Gascon, when the valet had r=
etired, "that he did not=20

meet the other one."  "Do you not think that they have sent for you, both f=
or the same thing?"  "I do=20

not think it, I am certain of it."  "Quick, quick, D'Artagnan. Remember tha=
t the queen awaits you,=20

and after the queen, the cardinal, and after the cardinal, myself."  D'Arta=
gnan summoned Anne of=20

Austria's servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the qu=
een's presence.  The=20

servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left =
entered the little=20

garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu; then they gained the private st=
aircase and D'Artagnan=20

was ushered into the oratory. A certain emotion, for which he could not acc=
ount, made the=20

lieutenant's heart beat: he had no longer the assurance of youth; experienc=
e had taught him the=20

importance of past events. Formerly he would have approached the queen as a=
 young man who=20

bends before a woman; but now it was a different thing; he answered her sum=
mons as an humble=20

soldier obeys an illustrious general.  The silence of the oratory was at la=
st disturbed by the slight=20

rustling of silk, and D'Artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry rai=
sed by a white hand,=20

which, by its form, its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal ha=
nd which had one day=20

been presented to him to kiss. The queen entered.  "It is you, Monsieur d'A=
rtagnan," she said,=20

fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer=
, "and I know you well.=20

Look at me well in your turn. I am the queen; do you recognize me?"  "No, m=
adame," replied=20


_
finite (karya rupa) when linked as a duad with Kama (animal desire     or h=
uman _egoistic_=20

volition), a lower production, in short.(846)   While, therefore, the INDIV=
IDUAL EGO, owing to its=20

essence and nature, is immortal throughout eternity, with a form (rupa), wh=
ich prevails during the=20

whole life cycles of the Fourth Round, its _Sosie_, or resemblance, the per=
sonal Ego, has to win=20

its immortality.  (4) Antahkarana is the name  "But are you no longer aware=
," continued Anne,=20

giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will, "that=
 in former days the queen=20

had once need of a young, brave and devoted cavalier--that she found this c=
avalier--and that,=20

although he might have thought that she had forgotten him, she had kept a p=
lace for him in the=20

depths of her heart?"  "No, madame, I was ignorant of that," said the muske=
teer.  "So much the=20


_
lies between the Divine and the human Egos, for they are _Egos_, during hum=
an life, to re-

become _one_ Ego in Devachan or Nirvana. This may seem difficult to underst=
and, but in reality,=20

with the help of a familiar, though fanciful illustration, it becomes quite=
 simple. Let us figure to=20

ourselves a bright lamp in the middle of a room, casting its light upon the=
 wall. Let the lamp=20

represent the Divine Ego, and the light thrown on the wall the least for th=
e queen, for to-day she=20

has need of the same courage and the same devotion."  "What!" exclaimed D'A=
rtagnan, "does the=20

queen, surrounded as she is by such devoted servants, such wise counselors,=
 men, in short, so=20

great by merit or position--does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure s=
oldier?"  Anne=20

understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it. Sh=
e had many a time felt=20

humiliated by the self-sacrifice=20


_
portion of the atmosphere which transmits the ray from the lamp to the wall=
, will then represent the=20

Antahkarana. We must further suppose that the light thus cast is endowed wi=
th reason and=20

intelligence, and possesses, moreover, the faculty of dissipating all the e=
vil shadows which pass=20

across the wall, and of attracting all brightnesses to itself, receiving th=
eir indelible impressions.=20

Now, it is in the power of the human Ego to chase away the shadows, or sins=
, and multiply the=20

brightnesses, or good deeds, which make these impressions, and thus through=
 Antahkarana,=20

ensure its own permanent connection, and its final re-union, with the Divin=
e Ego. Remember that=20

the latter cannot take place while there remains a single taint of the terr=
estrial, or of matter, in the=20

purity of that light. On the other hand, the connection cannot be entirely =
ruptured, and final re-

union disinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman. She had allowed hers=
elf to be=20

exceeded in generosity.  "All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrou=
nded, Monsieur=20

d'Artagnan, is doubtless true," said the queen, "but I have confidence in y=
ou alone. I know that you=20

belong to the cardinal, but belong to me as well, and I will take upon myse=
lf the making of your=20

fortune. Come, will you do to-day what formerly the gentleman you do not kn=
ow did for the=20

queen?"  "I will do everything your majesty commands," replied D'Artagnan. =
 The queen reflected=20

for a moment and then, seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer:  "Per=
haps you like=20

repose?" she said.  "I do not know, for I have never had it, madame."  "Hav=
e you any friends?"  "I=20

had three, two of whom have left Paris, to go I know not where. One alone i=
s left to me, but he is=20

one of those known, I believe, to the=20
