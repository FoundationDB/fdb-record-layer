science and proved to come=20

from the Gnostics.       Professor Draper shows it as hardly known in the d=

as having 'originated among the Gnostic heretics' (see _Conflict       Betw=

other Kabalistic books=20

are found to belong to the first century before our era, if not to       be=
 far older still.        "The=20

Gnostics entertained many of the Essenean ideas; and the       Essenes had =
their greater and=20

minor Mysteries at least two centuries       before our era. They were the =
_Isarim_ or _Initiates_,=20

the       descendants of the Egyptian hierophants, in whose country they ha=
d       been settled for=20

several centuries before they were converted to       Buddhistic monasticis=
m by the missionaries of=20

King Asoka, and       amalgamated later with the earliest Christians: and t=
hey existed,=20

probably, before the old Egyptian temples were desecrated and leave the roo=
m. "Remain, Parry. I=20



have nothing to say that cannot be said before all."  Juxon sat down, and t=
he king, kneeling=20

humbly before him, began his confession.     66. Remember!   The mob had al=
ready assembled=20

when the confession terminated. The king's children next arrived--the Princ=
ess Charlotte, a=20

beautiful, fair-haired child, with tears in her eyes, and the Duke of Glouc=
ester, a boy eight or nine=20

years old, whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride. He=
 had wept all night=20

long, but would not show his grief before the people.  Charles's heart melt=
ed within him at the sight=20

of those two children, whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now m=
et at the moment=20

of death. He turned to brush away a tear, and then, summoning up all his fi=
rmness, drew his=20

daughter toward him, recommending her to be pious and resigned. Then he too=
k the boy upon his=20

knee.  "My son," he said to him, "you saw a great number of people in the s=
treets as you came=20

here. These men are going to behead your father. Do not forget that. Perhap=
s some day they will=20

want to make you king, instead of the Prince of Wales, or the Duke of York,=
 your elder brothers.=20

But you are not the king, my son, and can never be so while they are alive.=
 Swear to me, then,=20

never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right =
to the crown. For one=20

day--listen, my son--one day, if you do so, they will doom you to destructi=
on, head and crown, too,=20

and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience, as I die. Swea=
r, my son."  The child=20

stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said, "I swear =
to your majesty."  "Henry,"=20

said Charles, "call me your father."  "Father," replied the child, "I swear=
 to you that they shall kill=20

me sooner than make me king."  "Good, my child. Now kiss me; and you, too, =
Charlotte. Never=20

forget me."  "Oh! never, never!" cried both the children, throwing their ar=
ms around their father's=20

neck.  "Farewell," said Charles, "farewell, my children. Take them away, Ju=
xon; their tears will=20

deprive me of the courage to die."  Juxon led them away, and this time the =
doors were left open.=20

Meanwhile, Athos, in his concealment, waited in vain the signal to recommen=
ce his work. Two=20

long hours he waited in terrible inaction. A deathlike silence reigned in t=
he room above. At last he=20

determined to discover the cause of this stillness. He crept from his hole =
and stood, hidden by the=20

black drapery, beneath the scaffold. Peeping out from the drapery, he could=
 see the rows of=20

halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the p=
opulace swaying and=20

groaning like the sea.  "What is the matter, then?" he asked himself, tremb=
ling more than the wind-

swayed cloth he was holding back. "The people are hurrying on, the soldiers=
 under arms, and=20

among the spectators I see D'Artagnan. What is he waiting for? What is he l=
ooking at? Good God!=20

have they allowed the headsman to escape?"  Suddenly the dull beating of mu=
ffled drums filled=20

the square. The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head. The next mom=
ent the very=20

planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession, =
and the eager faces of=20

the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had pr=
evented him till then=20

believing. At the same moment a well-known voice above him pronounced these=
 words:  "Colonel,=20

I want to speak to the people."  Athos shuddered from head to foot. It was =
the king speaking on=20

the scaffold.  In fact, after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bre=
ad, Charles, weary of=20

waiting for death, had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the =
signal for movement.=20

Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open, an=
d the people had=20

seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber, first, a mas=
ked man, who, carrying=20

an axe in his hand, was recognized as the executioner. He approached the bl=
ock and laid his axe=20

upon it. Behind him, pale indeed, but marching with a firm step, was Charle=
s Stuart, who=20



advanced between two priests,=20


_
in the incessant invasions of Persians, Greeks, and other conquering       =
hordes. The hierophants=20

had their atonement enacted in the Mystery       of Initiation ages before =
the Gnostics, or even the=20

Essenes, had       appeared. It was known among hierophants as the Baptism =
of Blood,       and=20

was considered not as an atonement for the 'fall of man' in       Eden, but=
 simply as an expiation for=20

the past, present, and future       sins of ignorant, but nevertheless poll=
uted mankind. The=20

hierophant       had the option of either offering his pure and sinless lif=
e as a       sacrifice for his=20

race to the gods whom he hoped to rejoin, or an       animal victim. The fo=
rmer depended entirely=20

on their own will. At       the last the execution and attended by two file=
s of partisans who took their=20

places on opposite sides of the scaffold.  The sight of the masked man gave=
 rise to a prolonged=20

sensation. Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown execution=
er could be who=20

presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spect=
acle, when the=20

people believed it had been postponed until the following day. All gazed at=
 him searchingly.  But=20

they could discern nothing but a man of middle height, dressed in black, ap=
parently of a certain=20

age, for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask tha=
t hid his features.  The=20

king's request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign, for =
in firm, sonorous=20

accents,=20


_
word' to the initiated, and immediately after the latter had a       weapon=
 placed in his right hand,=20

and was ordered _to strike_. This       is the true origin of the Christian=
 dogma of atonement."=20

As Ballanche says, quoted by Ragon: "Destruction is the great God of       =
the World," justifying=20

therefore the philosophical conception of the       Hindu Shiva. According =
to this immutable and=20

sacred law, "the       Initiate was compelled to kill the Initiator; otherw=
ise initiation       remained=20

incomplete.... It is death that generates life."       _Orthodoxie maconniq=
ue_, p. 104. All that,=20

however, was emblematic       and exoteric. Weapon and killing must be unde=
rstood in their=20

allegorical sense.    510 _Orthodoxie maconnique_, pp. 102-104.    511 _Op.=
 cit._, i. 15.    512=20

_Five Years of Theosophy_, p. 258. A curious question to start and       to=
 deny, when it is well-

known even to the Orientalists that, to       take but one case, there is Y=
aska, who was a=20

predecessor of Panini,       and his work still exists; there are seventeen=
 writers of Nirukta=20

(glossary) known to have preceded Yaska.    513 _La Mere d'Apis_, p. 47.   =
 514 One just initiated=20

is called the "first-born," and in India he       becomes dwija, "twice bor=
n," only after his final and=20

supreme       Initiation. Every Athos's heart, the king began his speech, e=
xplaining his conduct and=20

counseling the welfare of the kingdom.  "Oh!" said Athos to himself, "is it=
 indeed possible that I=20

hear what I hear and that I see what I see? Is it possible that God has aba=
ndoned His=20

representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably? And I have not =
seen him! I have not=20

said adieu to him!"  A noise was heard like that the instrument of death wo=
uld make if moved upon=20

the block.  "Do not touch the axe," said the king, and resumed his speech. =
 At the end of his=20

speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people. Then unfastening th=
e diamond ornament=20

which the queen had sent him, he placed it in the hands of the priest who a=
ccompanied Juxon.=20

Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds, which, like th=
e order, had been the gift=20

of Henrietta Maria.  "Sir," said he to the priest, "I shall keep this cross=
 in my hand till the last=20

moment. Take it from me when I am--dead."  "Yes, sire," said a voice, which=
 Athos recognized as=20

that of Aramis.  He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the gro=
und. One by one he=20

undid the buttons of his doublet, took it off and deposited it by the side =
of his hat. Then, as it was=20

cold, he asked for his gown, which was brought to him.  All the preparation=
s were made with a=20

frightful=20


_
receiving the "Word," when he becomes the "Word" himself, after       recei=
ving the seven divine=20

attributes or the "lyre of Apollo."    515 See De Mirville, iv. 15.    516 =
II. _Kings_, xxiii. 4-13.    517=20

_Judges_, xiii. 18. Samson, Manoah's son, was an Initiate of that       "My=
stery" Lord, Ja-va; he=20

was consecrated before his birth to become       a "Nazarite" (a chela) an =
Adept. His sin with=20

Dalilah, and the       cropping of his long hair that "no razor was to touc=
h" shows how       well he=20

kept his sacred vow. The allegory of Samson proves the       Esotericism of=
 the _Bible_, as also=20

the character of the "Mystery       Gods" of the Jews. True, Movers gives a=
 definition of the=20

Phoenician       idea of the ideal sunlight as a spiritual influence issuin=
g from the       highest=20

thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin.  "Will these be in=
 your way?" he said to the=20

executioner, raising his long locks; "if so, they can be tied up."  Charles=
 accompanied these words=20

with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman. His cal=
m, noble gaze=20

forced the man to turn away his head. But after the searching look of the k=
ing he encountered the=20

burning eyes of Aramis.  The king, seeing that he did not reply, repeated h=
is question.  "It will do,"=20

replied the man, in a tremulous voice, "if you separate them across the nec=
k."  The king parted his=20

hair with his hands, and looking at the block he said:  "This block is very=
 low, is there no other to=20

be had?"  "It is the usual block," answered the man in the mask.  "Do you t=
hink you can behead=20

me with a=20


_
physical and spiritual Principle of all things; out of which the       soul=
 emanates." It was the male=20

Essence, or Wisdom, while the       primitive matter or _Chaos_ was the fem=
ale. Thus the first two=20

principles, co-eternal and infinite, were already with the primitive     "I=
 hope so," was the reply.=20

There was something so strange in these three words that everybody, except =
the king, shuddered.=20

"I do not wish to be taken by surprise," added the king. "I shall kneel dow=
n to pray; do not strike=20

then."  "When shall I strike?"  "When I shall lay my head=20
