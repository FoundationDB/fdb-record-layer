s too long. He was dead within two weeks. The wrath of God rested upon him =

g very miserly, begin to scatter, like a wealthy farmer in New York state I=
 heard of. He was a noted miser, but he was converted. Soon after, a poor m=
an who had been burned out and had no provisions, _
and pulled the trigger.  At the instant the report rang out, the buck raise=
d his head, wheeled=20

around, and catching sight of Jack standing on the edge of the clearing, ca=
me at him almost as=20

fast as an express train. He had been only slightly wounded, and, full of r=
age, he had only one=20

desire--to annihilate the person responsible for the stinging pain he felt.=
  Jack saw him coming,=20

and threw down the lever of his rifle to pump another cartridge into the ch=
amber. But, to his horror,=20

the lever refused to work. It had become jammed in some way, and the explod=
ed shell could not=20

be ejected. He pulled and tugged at it, the buck coming nearer by leaps and=
 bounds.  "Jump--

jump!" Jack heard Will cry, and realizing that he could not get in another =
shot, he leaped to one=20

side, hoping to get out of the way of the infuriated animal.  But his foot =
caught in the entangled=20

branch of a bush, and he fell backward, full length, right in the path of t=
he advancing buck, that=20

was snorting with rage.  Jack tried to roll over, but the bush held him fas=
t. He felt that it was all up=20

with him, and he closed his eyes, expecting the next instant to feel the bu=
ck leap on him, to pierce=20

him with its keen hoofs.  Jack could hear the thundering approach of the bi=
g creature, and he=20

could feel the tremor of the ground as the brute came nearer. He fancied he=
 could see the big bulk=20

in the air over him.  Then there sounded a sharp crack, followed by a thud,=
 and the black shape=20

seemed to pass to one side. There was a shock as a big body hit the ground,=
 a great crashing=20

among the bushes, and Jack opened his eyes to see the buck lying dead a few=
 feet away from=20

him.  Then he saw something else. It was Will, running toward him, a smokin=
g rifle in his hands.=20

"Are you--are you all right?" asked Will, his voice trembling.  "Yes," said=
 Jack, hardly able to=20

speak, because of the reaction of the shock through which he had just passe=
d. "I'm all right. Did=20

you shoot the buck?"  "I--I guess so," replied Will with a nervous laugh. "=
I aimed my rifle at him=20

and pulled the trigger, anyhow."  Jack went over to the big body, that had =
not ceased quivering.=20

"Right through the heart," he said, as he saw where the bullet had gone in.=
 "Bill, you saved my=20

life!"     CHAPTER XXIX  THE BLIZZARD   Jack extended his hand, and clasped=
 that of Will's in a=20

firm grip.  "This would have ended my hunting days if you hadn't fired," he=
 said.  "Maybe he would=20

have leaped over you," said Will. "He was coming very fast."  "I saw he was=
. He'd have jumped=20

right on me, too, and that would have been the finish of yours truly. My, b=
ut that was a crack shot=20

of yours."  "I didn't seem to take any aim. As soon as I saw him coming for=
 you, I seemed to get=20

steady all at once, and I didn't tremble a bit."  "Lucky for me you didn't.=
 My rifle went back on me=20

just at the wrong minute."  "What's the matter with it?"  "I don't know. I =
must take a look. It's risky to=20

be hunting with such a rifle."  Jack looked for the cause of the trouble, a=
nd found that in taking the=20

gun apart to clean it he had not screwed in far enough a certain bolt, whic=
h projected and=20

prevented the breech mechanism from working. The trouble was soon remedied,=
 and the rifle was=20

ready for use again.  "Well, you can shoot the next buck," remarked Will as=
 the two looked at the=20

carcass of the big animal.  "Not to-day. I'd shake worse than you did if I =
tried to aim. We'll do no=20

more hunting to-day. We'll go back and get Nat, and take this to camp. Ther=
e's enough for a=20

week."  It was with no little difficulty that the three boys loaded the bes=
t parts of the buck on their=20

horses and started back to camp. They found that Sam and Bony had arrived a=
head of them, Sam=20

having killed a fine ram.  "Well, I know what I'm going to do to-day," rema=
rked Jack the next=20

morning.  "What?" inquired Nat.  "I'm going to have another try at that mys=
tery."  "Do you think it'll=20

be safe?"  "I don't see why. I'm going to try to get to that camp from anot=
her trail, and if they see=20

me the worst they can do will be to order me away again."  "I'm with you," =
declared Nat, and the=20



others agreed to accompany the senior member of the gun club.  They started=
 directly after=20

breakfast, Jack, Nat, Sam, Bony and Will. Jack, making inquiries of Long Gu=
n, learned of another=20

trail that could be taken. They rode along this for several miles, and then=
 proceeded cautiously, as=20

they judged they were near where the hostile men had their camp.  Suddenly =
Nat, who was riding=20

along beside Jack, stopped his horse and began sniffing the air.  "Smell an=
ything?" he asked his=20

chum.  Jack took several long breaths. Then he nodded.  "Gasolene, eh?" que=
stioned Nat.=20

"Caesar's pancakes! but I believe we're on the track of those same bogus ce=
rtificate printers=20

again!"  "It can't be," declared Jack.  "But smell the gasolene."  "I know =
it, but it might be from an=20

automobile."  "An automobile out here? Nonsense! Listen, you can hear the p=
ounding of the=20

engine."  Certainly there was an odd throbbing noise, but just as Jack was =
beginning to locate it=20

Lot coveted the rich plains of Sodom, and what did he gain? After twenty ye=
ars spent in that=20

wicked city, he had to escape for his life, leaving all his wealth behind h=
im.  What did the thirty=20

pieces of silver do for Judas? Weren't they a snare?  Think of Balaam. He i=
s generally regarded as=20

a false prophet, but I do not find that any of his prophecies that are reco=
rded are not true; they=20

have been literally fulfilled. Up to a certain point his character shone ma=
gnificently, but the devil=20

finally overcame him by the bait of covetousness. He stepped over a heavenl=
y crown for the riches=20

and honors that Balak promised him. He went to perdition backwards. His fac=
e was set toward=20

God, but he backed into hell. He wanted to die the death of the righteous, =
but he did not live the=20

life of the righteous. It is sad to see so many who know God, miss everythi=
ng for riches.  Then=20

consider the case of Gehazi. There is another man who was drowned in destru=
ction and perdition=20

by covetousness. He got more out of Naaman than he asked for, but he also g=
ot Naaman's=20

leprosy. Think how he forfeited the friendship of his master Elisha, the ma=
n of God! So to-day=20

lifelong friends are separated by this accursed desire. Homes are broken up=
. Men are willing to=20

sell out peace and happiness for the sake of a few dollars.  Didn't David f=
all into foolish and hurtful=20

lusts? He saw Bathsheba, Uriah's wife, and she was "very beautiful to look =
upon," and David=20

became a murderer and an adulterer. The guilty longing hurled him into the =
deepest pit of sin. He=20

had to reap bitterly as he had sowed.  I heard of a wealthy German out west=
, who owned a lumber=20

mill. He was worth nearly two millions of dollars, but his covetousness was=
 so great that he once=20

worked as a common laborer carrying railroad ties all day. It was the cause=
 of his death.  "_And=20

Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God =
of Israel, and thus=20

and thus have I done: When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garme=
nt, and two=20

hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, the=
n I_ coveted them,_and=20

took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, =
and the silver under it_."=20

He saw--he coveted--he took--he hid! The covetous eye was what led Achan up=
 to the wicked=20

deed that brought sorrow and defeat upon the camp of Israel.  We know the t=
errible punishment=20

that was meted out to Achan. God seems to have set danger signals at the th=
reshold of each new=20

age. It is remarkable how soon the first outbreaks of covetousness occurred=
. Think of Eve in Eden,=20

Achan just after Israel had entered the Promised Land, Ananias and Sapphira=
 in the early=20

Christian Church.  A ROOT EXTRACTOR.  "_For the love of money is the root o=
f all evil, which=20

while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced thems=
elves through with=20

many sorrows_."  The Revised Version translates it--"_a root of all kinds o=
f evil_." This tenth=20

commandment has therefore been aptly called a "root-extractor," because it =
would tear up and=20



destroy this root. Deep down in our corrupt nature it has spread. No one bu=
t God can rid us of it.=20

Matthew tells us that the deceitfulness of riches chokes the Word of God. L=
ike the Mississippi=20

river, which chokes up its mouth by the amount of soil it carries down. Isn=
't that true of many=20

business-men to day? They are so engrossed with their affairs that they hav=
e not time for religion.=20

They lose sight of their soul and its eternal welfare in their desire to am=
ass wealth. They do not=20

even hesitate to sell their souls to the devil. How many a man says, "We mu=
st make money, and if=20

God's law stands in the way, brush it aside."  The word "lucre" occurs five=
 times in the New=20

Testament, and each time it is called "_filthy_ lucre."  "A root of all kin=
ds of evil." Yes, because=20

what will not men be guilty of when prompted by the desire to be rich? Gree=
d for gold leads men to=20

commit violence and murder, to cheat and deceive and steal. It turns the he=
art to stone, devoid of=20

all natural affection, cruel, unkind. How many families are wrecked over th=
e father's will! The=20

scramble for a share of the wealth smashes them to pieces. Covetous of rank=
 and position in=20

society, parents barter sons and daughters in ungodly marriage. Bodily heal=
th is no consideration.=20

The uncontrollable fever for gold makes men renounce all their settled pros=
pects, and undertake=20

hazardous journeys--no peril can drive them back. It destroys faith and spi=
rituality, turning men's=20

minds and hearts away from God. It disturbs the peace of the community by p=
rompting to acts of=20

wrong. Covetousness has more than once led nation to war against nation for=
 the sake of gaining=20

territory or other material resources. It is said that when the Spaniards c=
ame over to conquer Peru,=20

they sent a message to the king, saying, "Give us gold, for we Spaniards ha=
ve a disease that can=20

only be cured by gold."  Dr. Boardman has shown how covetousness leads to t=
he transgression of=20

every one of the commandments, and I cannot do=20


_
"Never mind, fellows," he said. "We'll follow the smell of the gasolene. I =
don't believe it's the same=20

gang that we were on the trail of before, but we'll soon find out. Keep tog=
ether, now."  They went=20

on for perhaps half a mile farther, when there was a sudden motion among th=
e bushes on the trail=20

ahead of them, and a man's voice called out:  "Halt!"  It was one of the th=
ree men who had, a few=20

days previous, warned Jack and Nat away.  "Where are you going?" the man de=
manded.  "We=20

were looking for your camp," said Jack boldly.  "Our camp?"  The man seemed=
 much surprised.=20

"Yes. We wanted to see what sort of a place you had. We smelled the gasolen=
e, and heard the=20

engine, and----"  "Now look here!" exclaimed the man angrily. "You've been =
told once to keep=20

away from here, and this is the second time. The next time you won't hear u=
s tell you. We'll shoot=20

without warning. And we won't shoot you, either, for we think you're here m=
ore out of curiosity than=20

anything else, but we'll shoot your horses, and you know what it means to b=
e without a horse out=20

here. So if you know what's good for you, keep away."  "Yes," added another=
 voice. "You'd better=20

keep away from here, Jack Ranger, if you don't want to get into trouble."  =
"Oh, it's you, is it, Jerry=20

Chowden?" spoke our hero. "I wonder if your new friends know as much about =
you as we do?"=20

"Never you mind!" exclaimed Jerry quickly. "You mind your own business, and=
 let me alone."=20

"That's what I've often wished you to do for me," spoke Jack. "Do you know =
that there is a warrant=20

out for your arrest if you ever come back in the neighborhood of Denton?"  =
Jerry gave a frightened=20

look over his shoulder. The man who had halted the lads had stepped back in=
to the bushes.  "You=20

clear out of here, Jack Ranger. And you, too, Nat Anderson and the words: "=
Coveting tempts us=20

into the violation of the first commandment, worshipping Mammon in addition=
 to Jehovah.=20

Coveting tempts us into a violation of the second commandment, or idolatry.=
 The apostle Paul=20

expressly identifies the covetous man with an idolater: 'Covetousness, whic=
h is idolatry.' Again:=20

Coveting tempts us into violation of the third commandment, or sacrilegious=
 falsehood: for=20

instance, Gehazi, lying in the matter of his interview with Naaman the Syri=
an, and Ananias and=20

Sapphira, perjuring themselves in the matter of the community of goods. Aga=
in: Coveting tempts=20

us into the violation of the fourth commandment, or Sabbath-breaking. It is=
 covetousness which=20

encroaches on God's appointed day of sacred rest, tempting us to run trains=
 for merely secular=20

purposes, to vend tobacco and liquors, to hawk newspapers. Again: Coveting =
tempts us into the=20

violation of the fifth commandment, or disrespect for authority; tempting t=
he young man to deride=20

his early parental counsels, the citizen to trample on civic enactments. Ag=
ain: Covetousness=20

tempts us into violation of the sixth commandment, or murder. Recall how Ju=
das' love of money=20

lured him into the betrayal of his Divine Friend into the hand of His murde=
rers, his lure being the=20

paltry sum of--say--fifteen dollars. Again: Covetousness tempts us into the=
 violation of the seventh=20

commandment, or adultery. Observe how Scripture combines greed and lust. Ag=
ain:=20

Covetousness tempts us into the violation of the eighth commandment, or the=
ft. Recall how it=20

tempted Achan to steal a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels =
of silver, and a=20

wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight. Again: Covetousness tempts us into t=
he violation of the ninth=20

commandment, or bearing false witness against our neighbor. Recall how the=

_
rest of the bunch!" snapped Jerry, and then he drew from his pocket a revol=
ver.  "Look out, Jerry,=20

that might go off," remarked Jack with a laugh.  "Don't you make fun of me!=
" ordered the bully. "I'm=20

working here, and I've got authority to order you away."  "That's right, Je=
rry, tell 'em to vamoose,"=20

added the man who had first spoken, as he again came into view. "We don't w=
ant any spies=20

around here."  Another man joined the first, and the two looked Belial to b=
ear blasphemous and=20

fatal testimony against Naboth, saying, 'Thou didst curse God and the king.=
'"  HOW TO=20

OVERCOME.  You ask me how you are to cast this unclean spirit out of your h=
eart? I think I can=20

tell you.  In the first place, make up your mind that by the grace of God y=
ou will overcome the spirit=20

of selfishness. You must overcome it, or it will overcome you. Paul said: "=
Mortify therefore your=20

members which are upon the earth;=20

intruders. They were armed with shotguns.  "What do you want?" asked the se=
cond man.  "Oh,"=20

said Nat lightly, "we just came to call on an acquaintance of ours--Jerry C=

East would like to see him, and we've just told him."  "That's not so!" cri=
ed Jerry angrily.  "You're=20
