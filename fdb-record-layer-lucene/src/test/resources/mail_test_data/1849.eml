Finally, however, this easy job began to pall on the epileptic prisoner's n=
erves; and he asked the=20

deputy warden to be transferred to the shops. "I can't do it," said the dep=
uty, "as it would be=20

against the physician's orders to change your work."  "Well, if that is the=
 case I will have to cut out=20

the fit business," replied the prisoner.  "What do you mean?" asked the dep=
uty warden.  "These=20

fits are all Herbs, and a slice or two of Lemmon-Peel; keep this close cove=
red, and stew it gently=20

till 'tis tender, then strain off the Sauce, and brown it with fry'd Flower=
, or burnt Butter: pour the=20

Sauce hot over the Hare, and serve it With a Garnish of Lemmon in Slices; b=
ut if you would have=20

your Sauce of brighter Colour, instead of the burnt Butter, or fry'd Flower=
, thicken it with the Yolks=20

of three or four=20


_
cut them out any time."  "The only way you can convince me that these epile=
ptic fits are not=20

genuine is to stop having them. If you do this for thirty days, I will give=
 you any job you want."  The=20

prisoner got the job, greatly to the mystification of the physicians and th=
e deputy warden.=20

ESCAPES FROM PRISON   There has been but one successful escape during the e=
ighteen years=20

that Warden Wolfer has had charge of the prison. A capture was, however, ef=
fected a few days=20

later.  The escape was neatly planned, and the "loophole" through which he =
crawled could only=20

have been detected by one who was constantly looking for a chance to "fly t=
he coop," using a=20

prisoner's expression. Opportunity came to him in the following manner: It =
was the custom of the=20

captain of the cellhouse to unlock the doors immediately after the men had =
left their cells. In the=20

fall of the year it is still quite dark when the prisoners march into the d=
ining room to breakfast. On=20

the morning that Mr. B. made his escape he simply remained in his cell, and=
 as soon as the=20

captain of the cell house unlocked the side doors and went back to his desk=
 came out of his cell,=20

cautiously made his way out of one of the side doors and made a beeline for=
 the wall near the=20

railroad gate, negotiating the same near this point. The wall guard imagine=
d that he saw some one=20

go over the top of the wall and fired several shots in that direction, but =
it was still very dark and he=20

was a Hare, and more generally admired than any other.  This being the Seas=
on for taking Honey,=20

I shall here set down the Method of making of Mead, after two ways, which a=
re both extraordinary.=20

To make Mead, from Lady _G._  Take eight Gallons of Water, and as much Hone=
y as will make it=20

bear an Egg; add to this the Rind of six Lemmons, and boil it well, scummin=
g it carefully as it rises.=20

When 'tis off the Fire, put to it the Juice of the six Lemmons, and pour it=
 into a clean Tub, or open=20

earthen Vessel, if you have one large enough, to work three Days; then scum=
 it well, and pour off=20

the clear into the Cask, and let it stand open till it has done making a hi=
ssing Noise; after which,=20

stop it up close, and in three Months time it will be fine, and fit for bot=
tling.    To make Hydromel, or=20

Mead.  Take eight Gallons of Water, and as much Honey as will make the Wate=
r bear an Egg; put=20

to this a quarter of a pound of Cloves tied in three or four pieces of Musl=
in or Linnen Cloth, and set=20

it to boil till the Scum has done rising, scumming it as it rises; then tak=
e it off the Fire, and take out=20

the Cloves, which may be wash'd and dry'd for other Uses, and pour your Mea=
d into an open Tub=20

to ferment for about three days, till the Violence of the Working is over; =
after which, scum it very=20

well, and pour the clear into a Vessel, leaving the Bung open till it has d=
one hissing, which you=20

may know by holding your Ear close to it, for at a distance you can hardly =
discover it.=20


_
as previously stated, was recaptured a few days later. Shot by a farmer who=
m he tried to rob and=20

received a bad bullet wound in one of his ankles. The farmer, however, was =
not aware of his=20

identity,--had ordered him off his premises, but the prisoner acted in a th=
reatening manner and=20

was thereupon shot.  About seventeen years ago another attempt to escape wa=
s made by a=20

desperate young fellow and two companions. They evaded the guard, slipped o=
ut of the shop near=20

the wagon gate and then waited where they were not observed; then a dash th=
ree Months till it is=20

fine, before you bottle it; remember in bottling this, as well as all other=
 Liquors, that the Bottles=20

must be clean, and perfectly dry, and that every Bottle be well cork'd. Thi=
s will keep good several=20

Years.  Besides this way of making Mead, there is another which I have appr=
oved to be very good,=20

which, in all particulars, except the Water, is the same with this; and ins=
tead of the Water, put the=20

like Quantity of small Ale-Wort, brew'd with pale Malt: but this will requi=
re less Honey than the=20

former, and will=20


_
open to permit a team to pass out. All three were apprehended shortly after=
wards under the=20

warehouse building of the Minnesota Thresher Co., where they had sought tem=
porary refuge. This=20

was just opposite the prison. It is very improbable that any more attempts =
will be made through=20

this gate, a guard now being stationed on the wall above the gate and one a=
cross the street.=20

Formerly there was but one guard in charge of the gate, which had a tendenc=
y to invite attack at=20

this quarter.                                [Prison Band ]                =

Yard to be Loaded with Twine ]        Prison Train Backing Into Prison Yard=
 to be Loaded with=20

Twine                bottle; but it will last many Years good, and will dri=
nk like _Cyprus_ Wine when it is=20

a Year old. In this Liquor, take particular care that your Cloves are fresh=
 and sound, for else you=20

must add a Quantity in proportion.  _N.B._ We may make these Meads in the S=
pring of the Year,=20

as well as at this Season; only the advantage of making it now, is, that yo=
u have an opportunity of=20

washing the Honey-Combs after the Honey is run off, and thereby will save E=
xpence in Honey.=20

The Potatoe now begins to be gather'd, and is a very useful Root, being eit=
her boil'd or roasted in=20

hot Embers; and after it is boiled, to be broiled, or after boiling it tend=
er, and beaten in a Mortar, it=20

is used to thicken Sauces, and for making of rich Puddings, as I am inform'=
d by a skilful Person in=20

this way.  The Roots of red Beets now begin to=20

soner, Frank Landis by=20

name, made as successful an escape as was ever made from any institution. H=
e sawed the bars=20

on one of the cell house windows, squeezed himself through and has never be=
en heard from=20

since. boiled, and sliced, to be put in a Pickle of Vinegar only: thus you =
may keep them to garnish=20

Sallads of small Herbs, and in some Intervals put Horse-Radish scraped. The=
se Roots will hold all=20

the Winter. The Root of the red Beet makes an excellent Dish, prepared afte=
r the following=20
