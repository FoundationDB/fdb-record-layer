dracaena marginata unable to escape from the fire, I ran towards the spot. =
As I approached, first one and then another dog ran screaming from the flam=
es, until a regular pack of about twenty scorched animals appeared in quick=
 succession, all half mad with fright and fire. I was informed that hydroph=
obia was very prevalent in the country, and that the certain preventive fro=
m that frightful malady was to make all the dogs of the village pass throug=
h the fire. Accordingly  Among others he imparted this information to Lotha=
ir, and it set Lothair a thinking; and he went to a ball that evening solel=
y with the purpose of making social observations like Hugo Bohun. But Lady =
Corisande was not there, though the Duke of Brecon was, apparently in high =
spirits, and waltzing more than once with Lady Grizell Falkirk. Lothair was=
 not very fortunate in his attempts to see Bertram. He called more than onc=

ornamented, but I imagine the custom had originated from the necessity of s=
caring the wild=20

animals that might have exhumed the body.  Although the grave of this rever=
ed Faky was=20

considered a sacred spot, the women had a curious custom that we should not=
 consider an=20

honour to the sanctity of the place: they met in parties beneath the shade =
of the mimosas that=20

covered the grave, for the express purpose of freeing each other's heads fr=
om vermin; the=20

creatures thus caught, instead of being killed, were turned loose upon the =
Faky.  Although the=20

Arabs in places remote from the immediate action of the Egyptian authoritie=
s are generally=20

lawless, they are extremely obedient to their own sheiks, and especially to=
 the fakeers: thus it is=20

important to secure such heads of the people as friends. My success=09 as a=
 physician had gained=20

me many friends, as I studiously avoided the acceptance of any present in r=
eturn for my services,=20

which I wished them to receive as simple acts of kindness; thus I had place=
d the Sheik Hassan bel=20

Kader under an obligation, by curing him of a fever; and as he chanced to c=
ombine in his own=20

person the titles of both sheik and faky, I had acquired a great ascendency=
 in the village, as my=20

medicines had proved more efficacious than the talismans. "Physician, cure =
thyself," applied to the=20

in such affairs. She is the person most interested in the event. I never in=
fluenced her sisters in=20

their choice, and she also must be free. The other subject is more grave.=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CIf we could only=20

ascertain who she really is,=E2=80=9D said the duchess.  =E2=80=9CAccording=
 to Bertram, fully our equal; but I=20

confess I am no judge of Levantine nobility,=E2=80=9D his grace added, with=
 a mingled expression of pride=20

and despair.  =E2=80=9CThat dreadful travelling abroad!=E2=80=9D exclaimed =
the duchess. =E2=80=9CI always had a foreboding=20

of something disastrous from it. Why should he have gone abroad, who has ne=
ver been to Ireland,=20

or seen half the counties of his own country?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThey all w=
ill go,=E2=80=9D said the duke; =E2=80=9Cand I thought, with=20

St. Aldegonde, he was safe from getting into any scrape of this kind.=E2=80=

Granville about it,=E2=80=9D said the duchess. =E2=80=9CWhen he is serious,=
 his judgment is good.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am to see St.=20

Aldegonde before I speak to Bertram,=E2=80=9D said the duke. =E2=80=9CI sho=
uld not be surprised if he were here=20

immediately.=E2=80=9D  One of the social mysteries is, =E2=80=9Chow things =

that such a proposal was either expected or=20

tartar emetic more powerful than a whole chapter of the Koran.  We frequent=
ly had medical=20

discussions, and the contents of my large medicine-chest were examined with=
 wonder by a=20

curious crowd; the simple effect of mixing a seidlitz powder was a source o=
f astonishment; but a=20

few drops of sulphuric acid upon a piece of strong cotton cloth which it de=
stroyed immediately,=20

was a miracle that invested the medicine-chest with a specific character fo=
r all diseases. The Arab=20

style of doctoring is rather rough. If a horse or other animal has inflamma=
tion, they hobble the legs=20

and throw it upon the ground, after which operation a number of men kick it=
 in the belly until it is=20

relieved--(by death). Should a man be attacked with fever, his friends pres=
cribe a system of diet, in=20

addition to the Koran of the Faky: he is made to drink, as hot as he can sw=
allow it, about a quart of=20

melted sheep's fat or butter. Young dogs, as a cure for distemper, are thro=
wn from the roof of a=20

house to the ground--a height of about ten feet. One night we were sitting =
at dinner, when we=20

suddenly heard a great noise, and the air was illumined by the blaze of a h=
ut on fire. In the midst=20

of the tumult I heard the unmistakeable cries of dogs, and admired Lady Cor=
isande, so did many=20

others; and many others were admired by the Duke of Brecon. The duchess eve=
n hoped that, as=20

the season was waning, it might break up, and people go into the country or=
 abroad, and nothing=20

be observed. And yet it =E2=80=9Cgot about.=E2=80=9D The way things get abo=
ut is through the Hugo Bohuns.=20

Nothing escapes their quick eyes and slow hearts. Their mission is to peer =
into society, like=20

professional astronomers ever on the watch to detect the slightest change i=
n the phenomena.=20

Never embarrassed by any passion of their own, and their only social schemi=
ng being to maintain=20

their transcendent position, all their life and energy are devoted to the d=
iscovery of what is taking=20

place around them; and experience, combined with natural tact, invests them=
 with almost a=20

supernatural skill in the detection of social secrets. And so it happened t=
hat scarcely a week had=20

passed before Hugo began to sniff the air, and then to make fine observatio=
ns at balls, as to whom=20

certain persons danced with, or did not dance with; and then he began the c=
urious process of what=20

he called putting two and two together, and putting two and two together pr=
