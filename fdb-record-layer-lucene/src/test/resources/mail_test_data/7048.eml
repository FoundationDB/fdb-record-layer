"Say," exclaimed Henry, "the Aunt of the Gilded Youth!"  "You mean our ambu=
lance boy who=20

came over on the boat with you--the multimillionaire?" asked the head of th=
e American Ambulance=20

service.  "The same," answered Henry, who turned to me and said in his orat=
orical voice: "The plot=20

thickens." Then the Frenchman told us the story of the raid: How the airmen=
 had come at=20

midnight, dropped their bombs, killing nurses and doctors, and how the disc=
ipline of the hospital=20

did not even flutter. He said that the head nurse summoned all her nurses, =
marched them to the=20

abri at the rear of the hospital, and stood at the door of the abri, while =
the girls filed in, and just as=20

the last nurse was going into the dugout with the head nurse standing outsi=
de, the airmen dropped=20

a bomb upon her and erased her! None of the nurses inside was hurt. Two doc=
tors were killed and=20

a number of patients. Landrecourt was on our way and we hurried to it.  [Il=
lustration: He had some=20

trouble lighting his cigarette and was irritated for a second at his inconv=
enience]  Was there ever a=20

martial adventure without a love story in it? Little did it seem to Henry a=
nd me as we left our=20

humble homes in Wichita and Emporia to make the world safe for democracy, t=
hat we two thick-

set, sedentary, new world replicas of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza should b=
e the chaperons=20

and custodians of a love affair. We were not equipped for it. We were trave=
lling light, and our=20

wives were three or four thousand miles away. No middle-aged married man ge=
ts on well with a=20

love affair who is out of daily reach of his wife. For when he gets into th=
e barbed wire tangle of a=20

love affair, he needs the wise counsel of a middle-aged woman. But here we =
were, two fat old=20

babes in the woods and here came the Gilded Youth, the Eager Soul and the Y=
oung Doctor--

sping! like a German shell--right into our midst, as it were.  There at Lan=
drecourt we found the=20

Eager Soul, a badly scared young person--but tremendously plucky! And mad--=
say, that girl was=20

doing a strafing job that would have made the kaiser blush! And the fine pa=
rt of it was, that its=20

expression was entirely in repression. There was no laugh in her face, no j=
oy in her heart, and we=20

scarcely knew the sombre, effective, business-like young person who greeted=
 us. And then across=20

the court we saw something else that interested us. For there, walking with=
 his patrician aunt, we=20

saw the Gilded Youth. Evidently he had heard of the raid, had run over from=
 Valaincourt on some=20

sort of military permission.  "Oh, yes," answered the Eager Soul to our enq=
uiring eyes. "Mrs.=20

Chesman--this is practically her hospital. I mean she and her group are kee=
ping it equipped and=20

going--a wonderful work. I mean here is a real thing for a woman to do. And=
, oh, the need of it!"=20

[Illustration: "Oh, yes," answered the Eager Soul to our horizontal. The gr=
ouping of the rocks of=20

Guanari is so symmetrical that they might be taken for the ruins of an anci=
ent edifice. Are they the=20

remains of islets in the midst of an inland sea, that covered the flat grou=
nd between the Sierra=20

Parime and the Parecis mountains?* (* The Sierra de la Parime, or of the Up=
per Orinoco, and the=20

Sierra (or Campos) dos Parecis, are part of the mountains of Matto Grosso, =
and form the northern=20

back of the Sierra de Chiquitos. I here name the two chains of mountains ru=
nning from east to=20

west, and bordering the plains or basins of the Cassiquiare, the Rio Negro,=
 and the Amazon,=20

between 5 degrees 30 minutes north, and 14 degrees south latitude.) or have=
 these walls of rock,=20

these turrets of granite, been upheaved by the elastic forces that still ac=
t in the interior of our=20

planet? We may be permitted to meditate a little on the origin of mountains=
, after having seen the=20

position of the Mexican volcanoes, and of trachyte summits on an elongated =
crevice; having found=20

in the Andes of South America primitive and volcanic rocks in a straight li=
ne in the same chain;=20

and when we recollect the island, three miles in circumference, and of a gr=
eat height, which in=20



modern times issued from the depths of the ocean near Oonalaska.  The banks=
 of the Cassiquiare=20

are adorned with the chiriva palm-tree with pinnate leaves, silvery on the =
under part. The rest of=20

the forest furnishes only trees with large, coriaceous, glossy leaves, that=
 have plain edges. This=20

peculiar physiognomy* of the vegetation of the Guainia, the Tuamini, and th=
e Cassiquiare, is=20

owing to the preponderance of the families of the guttiferae, the sapotae, =
and the laurineae, in the=20

equatorial regions. (* This physiognomy struck us forcibly, in the vast for=
ests of Spanish Guiana,=20

only between the second and third degrees of north latitude.) The serenity =
of the sky promising us=20

a fine night, we resolved, at five in the evening, to rest near the Piedra =
de Culimacari, a solitary=20

granite rock, like all those which I have described between the Atabapo and=
 the Cassiquiare. We=20

found by the bearings of the sinuosities of the river, that this rock is ne=
arly in the latitude of the=20

mission of San Francisco Solano. In those desert countries, where man has h=
itherto left only=20

fugitive traces of his existence, I constantly endeavoured to make my obser=
vations near the mouth=20

of a river, or at the foot of a rock distinguishable by its form. Such poin=
ts only as are immutable by=20

their nature can serve for the basis of geographical maps. I obtained, in t=
he night of the 10th of=20

May, a good observation of latitude by alpha of the Southern Cross; the lon=
gitude was determined,=20

but with less precision, by the chronometer, taking the altitudes of the tw=
o beautiful stars which=20

shine in the feet of the Centaur. This observation made known to=20


_
eyes. "Mrs. Chessman--this is practically her hospital"]  "Nice sort?" This=
 from Henry, observing=20

that there was no move toward us, on the part of the Gilded Youth and Aunti=
e. Henry may have=20

had his theory for their splendid isolation. But it received no stimulus wh=
en the Eager Soul=20

answered:  "Oh, yes, I believe so. I haven't met her yet. They all say she =
is charming." Henry=20

looked at me. She caught the glance. Then to cover his tracks he grinned an=
d said: "Charm=20

seems to run in their family."  "Yes," she returned amiably. "One meets so =
many nice people on=20

the boat."  And Henry, still in pursuit of useful social information, insis=
ted: "Well, are they as nice in=20

the war zone as they are--on the boat?"  We got our first dimple then, and =
the Eager Soul tucked=20

in a wisp of red hair, as she answered: "Well, really, I've been too busy t=
o know." She turned=20

absent-mindedly toward the figure of the Gilded Youth, across the court. Bu=
t the dimples and the=20

smile faded and she closed the door firmly and finally on romance, when she=
 said: "On the record=20

of service shown by my entrance card, they have made me assistant to the ne=
w head nurse who=20

is coming over from Souilly to-night."  After we had told her that we were =
going to American=20

headquarters soon, she smiled again, to show us that she knew that when we =
went probably we=20

would see the Young Doctor. But she let the smile stand as her only respons=
e to Henry's=20

suggestion of a message. In another moment she turned to her work.  "Well,"=
 said Henry, "some=20

pride! 'One meets so many nice people on the boat!' The idea being that her=
 outfit at home is just=20

as good as Auntie's group in New York, even if he didn't introduce her! You=
 know I rather like the=20

social spunk of our Great Middle West!"  While we were talking the Gilded Y=
outh began moving=20

Auntie slowly but rather directly around the court to us. It occurred to me=
 that perhaps he realized=20

that we were the only social godfathers that the Eager Soul had in Europe, =
and that if he=20

introduced us to Auntie it would be an indication that the affair of the bo=
at, if it was an affair, was to=20

be put upon a social basis! And in two precision for the purposes of geogra=
phy, the positions of=20

the mouth of the Pacimoni, of the fortress of San Carlos, and of the juncti=
on of the Cassiquiare=20

with the Rio Negro. The rock of Culimacari is precisely in latitude 2 degre=
es 0 minutes 42 seconds,=20

and probably in longitude 69 degrees 33 minutes 50 seconds.  Satisfied with=
 our observations, we=20

left the rock of Culimacari at half past one on the morning of the 12th. Th=
e torment of mosquitos,=20

to which we were exposed, augmented in proportion as we withdrew from the R=
io Negro. There=20

are no zancudos in the valley of Cassiquiare, but the simulia, and all the =
other insects of the=20

tipulary family, are the more numerous and venomous. Having still eight nig=
hts to pass in the open=20

air in this damp and unhealthy climate, before we could reach the mission o=
f Esmeralda, our pilot=20

sought to arrange our passage in such a manner as might enable us to enjoy =
the hospitality of the=20

missionary of Mandavaca, and some shelter in the village of Vasiva. We went=
 up with difficulty=20

against the current, which was nine feet, and in some places (where I measu=
red it with precision)=20

eleven feet eight inches in a second, that is, almost eight miles an hour. =
Our resting-place was=20

probably not farther than three leagues in a right line from the mission of=
 Mandavaca; yet, though=20

we had no reason to complain of inactivity on the part of our rowers, we we=
re fourteen hours in=20

making this short passage.  Towards sunrise we passed the mouth of the Rio =
Pacimoni, a river=20

which I mentioned when speaking of the trade in sarsaparilla, and which (by=
 means of the Baria)=20

intertwines in so remarkable a way with the Cababuri. The Pacimoni rises in=
 a hilly ground, from=20

the confluence of three small rivers,* not marked on the maps of the missio=
naries. (* The Rios=20

Guajavaca, Moreje, and Cachevaynery.) Its waters are black, but less so tha=
n those of the lake of=20



Vasiva, which also communicates with the Cassiquiare. Between those two tri=
butary streams=20

coming from the east, lies the mouth of the Rio Idapa, the waters of which =
are white. I shall not=20

recur again to the difficulty of explaining this coexistence=20


_
more he had docked Auntie at our pier. A large, brusk, well-groomed, good-l=
ooking woman of fifty=20

was Auntie. Her Winthrop and Endicott blood advertised itself in her Boston=
ese, but she was=20

sound and strong and the way she instantly got at the invoice price of Henr=
y and his real worth,=20

pleased me. She was genuine American. The territory, but shall merely obser=
ve, that at the mouth=20

of the Pacimoni, and on the borders of the lake Vasiva, we were again struc=
k with the purity and=20

extreme transparency of the brown waters. Ancient Arabian travellers have o=
bserved, that the=20

Alpine branch of the Nile, which joins the Bahr el Abiad near Halfaja, has =
green=20


_
thing that troubled me was the fear that Henry would begin too soon to lamb=
ast onion soup. But he=20

didn't and in a few moments we were having this dialogue:  HENRY: "Oh, yes,=
 indeed; we've=20

grown fond of her. Her father was--"  AUNTIE: "Oh, yes, I knew her father. =
Mr. Chesman and he=20

were interested together in New Mexican mining claims in the eighties; I be=
lieve they made some=20

money. But--"  THE GILDED YOUTH: "Well, Auntie--would you are so transparen=
t, that the fish=20

may be seen at the bottom of the river.  We passed some turbulent rapids be=
fore we reached the=20

mission of Mandavaca. The village, which bears also the name of Quirabuena,=
 contains only sixty=20

natives. The state of the Christian settlements is in general so miserable =
that, in the whole course=20

of the Cassiquiare, on a length of fifty leagues, not two hundred inhabitan=
ts are found. The banks=20

of this=20
