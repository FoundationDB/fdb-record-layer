dracaena marginata Paul, as had been agreed upon, carried them up to Mr. Pr=
eston. He was fortunate enough to find him at home.  "I hope they will suit=
 you," said Paul.  "I can see that the sewing is excellent," said Mr. Prest=
on, examining them. "As to the fit, I can tell better after I have jumping =
into the air, and coming down again on the same spot repeatedly, the Brazil=

"As to the fit, I can tell better after I have jumping into the air, and co=
ming down again on the same spot repeatedly, the Brazilians said that it wa=
s fighting with a snake, for =E2=80=9CGod has given such instinct to those =
beasts that they attack and kill all snakes, knowing that they are enemies =
of man.=E2=80=9D {32}  A scheme of _
custody, he felt a degree of satisfaction, remembering the trick Jerry had =
played on him.  "Where=20

are you goin', Jerry?" he asked, with a grin, as he passed him. "Did ye buy=
 that barrel to kape your=20

shirt in?"  Jerry scowled but thought it best not to answer, lest his unlaw=
ful possession of the shirt=20

might also be discovered, and lead to a longer sentence.  "He's goin' down =
to the island to show=20

his new shirt," thought Mike, with a grin. "Maybe he'll set the fashion the=
re."  Mike was right. Jerry=20

was sent to the island for two months, there introducing Mr. Preston's shir=
t to company little=20

dreamed of by its original proprietor.    CHAPTER XIII  OUT OF BUSINESS  Th=
e next day Mrs.=20

Hoffman commenced work upon Mr. Preston's shirts. She worked with much more=
 cheerfulness=20

now that she was sure of obtaining a liberal price for her labor. As the sh=
irts were of extra size,=20

she found herself unable to finish one in a day, as she had formerly done, =
but had no difficulty in=20

making four in a week. This, however, gave her five dollars weekly, instead=
 of a dollar and a half=20

as formerly. Now, five dollars may not seem a very large sum to some of my =
young readers, but to=20

Mrs. Hoffman it seemed excellent compensation for a week's work.  "If I cou=
ld only earn as much=20

every week," she said to Paul on Saturday evening, "I should feel quite ric=
h."  "Your work will last=20

three weeks, mother, and perhaps at the end of that time some of Mr. Presto=
n's friends may wish=20

to employ you."  "I hope they will."  "How much do you think I have made?" =
continued Paul.  "Six=20

dollars."  "Seven dollars and a half."  "So between us we have earned over =
twelve dollars."  "I wish=20

I could earn something," said little Jimmy, looking up from his drawing.  "=
There's time enough for=20

that, Jimmy. You are going to be a great artist remembered in his youth, an=
d said he recollected=20

eating them whilst in Navarre, and that they were better than all the fruit=
 of all Brazil; thinking, like=20

Naaman, that Abana and Pharpar were better than all the waters of Israel, o=
r rivers of Damascus;=20

or perhaps moved in some mysterious way by the remembrance of the chestnut =
forests, the old=20

grey stone-roofed houses, and the wind whistling through the pine woods of =
some wild valley of=20

Navarre.  At the old Spaniard=E2=80=99s house a difficulty cropped up with =
our men.  I having told a man to=20

catch a horse which looked a little wild, he answered he was not a horse-br=
eaker, and I might ride=20

the beast myself.  I promptly did so, and asked him if he knew what a wild =
horse was, and if it was=20

not true that horses which could be saddled without tying their hind legs w=
ere tame, and the rest=20

laughing at him, he drew his knife, and running at me, found himself lookin=
g down the barrel of a=20

pistol which my partner with some forethought had produced. This brought th=
ings to a crisis, and=20

they all left us, with a hundred horses on our hands.  Several Brazilians h=
aving volunteered, we=20

took them, bought a tame horse accustomed to carry packs, procured a bulloc=
k, had it killed, and=20

the meat =E2=80=9Cjerked=E2=80=9D; and making bags out of the hide, filled =
them with food, for, as the Spaniard said,=20

=E2=80=9Cin the country you intend to cross you might as well be amongst Mo=
ors, for even money will not=20

serve to get a piece of beef.=E2=80=9D  A kindly soul the Spaniard, his nam=
e has long escaped me, still he=20

was interesting as but the truly ignorant can ever be.  The world to him wa=
s a great mystery, as it=20

is even to those who know much more than he; but all the little landmarks o=
f the narrow=20

boundaries of his life he had by heart; and they sufficed him, as the great=
 world itself cannot=20

one of these days."  "Do you really think I shall?" asked the little boy, w=
istfully.  "I think there is a=20

good chance of it. Let me see what you are drawing."  The picture upon whic=
h Jimmy was at work=20

represented a farmer standing upright in a cart, drawn by a sturdy, large-f=
ramed horse. The copy=20

bore a close resemblance to the original, even in the most difficult portio=
ns--the face and=20

expression, both in the man and the horse, being carefully reproduced.  "Th=
is is wonderful,=20

Jimmy," exclaimed Paul, in real surprise. "Didn't you find it current, see =
its muddiness.  So one day=20

told another, and each night found us on horseback riding round the drove. =
 Through forest, over=20

baking plain, up mountain paths, through marshes, splashing to the saddle-f=
laps, by lone=20

=E2=80=9Cfazendas,=E2=80=9D and again through herds of cattle dotting the p=
lain for miles, we took our way.  Little=20

straw huts, each with a horse tied day and night before them, were our fair=
way marks.  Day=20

followed night without adventure but when a horse suddenly threw its rider =
and a Brazilian peon=20

uncoiled his lasso, and with a=20


_
"Rather hard," said Jimmy; "I had to be careful, but I like best the parts =
where I have to take the=20

most pains."  "I wish I could afford to hire a teacher for you," said Paul.=
 "Perhaps, if mother and I=20

keep on earning so much money, we shall be able to some time."  By the life=
, and in a moment the=20

long snaky rope flew through the air and settled round the runaway just und=
erneath his ears.=20

Once in a clearing, as we plodded on, climbing the last barrier of the moun=
tain range, to emerge=20
