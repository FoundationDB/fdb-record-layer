(a) doctrine that in order to constitute a crime there must be either an in=
tent to do the wrong, or=20

such a degree of negligence in the performance of a given act as to supply =
the place of the intent=20

to do wrong, and require punishment for the protection of society, upon the=
 ground that the=20

carelessness of the defendant is so great as to make it necessary and prope=
r to punish him, in=20

order to deter others from following his example.  _Doctrine of Leading Cas=
e of Com. v.=20

Thompson._=E2=80=94In Com. _v._ Thompson (6 Mass., 134), Parsons, C. J., ob=
serves: =E2=80=9CThere was no=20

evidence to induce the belief that the prisoner by his treatment intended t=
o kill or injure the=20

deceased and the ground of express malice must fall. It has been said that =
implied malice may be=20

inferred from the rash and presumptuous conduct of the prisoner in administ=
ering such violent=20

medicines. Before implied malice can be inferred, the judges must be satisf=
ied that the prisoner by=20

his treatment of his patient was wilfully regardless of his social duties, =
being determined on=20

mischief.... To constitute manslaughter, the killing must have been the con=
sequence of some=20

unlawful act. Now there is no law which prohibits any man from prescribing =
for a sick person with=20

his consent; and it is not a felony, if through his ignorance of the qualit=
y of the medicine=20

prescribed, or of the nature of the disease, or of both, the patient, contr=
ary to his expectations,=20

should die. The death of a man killed by voluntarily following a medical pr=
escription cannot be=20

adjudged felony in the party prescribing unless he, however ignorant of med=
ical science in=20



general, had so much knowledge or probable information of the fatal tendenc=
y of the prescription=20

that it may be reasonably presumed by the jury to be an act of wilful rashn=
ess at least, and not of=20

honest intention and expectation to cure.=E2=80=9D  _The Doctrine of the Th=
ompson Case Too=20

Broad._=E2=80=94This lax statement of the law, made by the learned chief ju=
stice in this case, has been=20

much doubted and criticised. It appears to be unsound in the length to whic=
h it goes in requiring, in=20

order to constitute criminal liability, what may be termed excessive gross =
carelessness or wilful=20

http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made ava=

Internet United States, although it is followed and approved in Rice _v._ T=
he State, 8 Mo., 561.  In=20

Rex _v._ Long (4 Car. & P., 308-310), Park, J., said: =E2=80=9CI call it ac=
ting wickedly when a man is=20

grossly ignorant and yet affects to cure people, or when he is grossly inat=
tentive to their safety.=E2=80=9D=20

So in Rex _v._ Spiller (5 Car. & P., 353), the Court said: =E2=80=9CIf a pe=
rson, whether a medical man or=20

not, professes to deal with the life and health of another, he is bound to =
use competent skill and=20

sufficient attention; and if he causes the death of another through gross w=
ant of either he will be=20

guilty of manslaughter.=E2=80=9D  Bishop, in his work on Criminal Law, lays=
 down the rule that not every=20

degree of carelessness renders a practitioner liable to criminal prosecutio=
n, and that it must be=20

gross, or, as more strongly expressed, =E2=80=9Cthe grossest ignorance or m=
ost criminal inattention.=E2=80=9D[189]=20

Nevertheless he quotes with approval (2 Bishop Crim. Law, 264) the remark o=
f Willes, J., that a=20

medical man is taking a leap in the dark if he knew he was using medicines =
beyond his=20

knowledge; and also the remarks of Bayley, J., in Rex _v._ Simpson (1 Lewin=
, 172), who said in=20

that case: =E2=80=9CI am clear that if a person not having a medical educat=
ion, and in a place where a=20

person of a medical education might be obtained, takes it upon himself to a=
dminister medicines=20

which may have an injurious effect, and such medicines destroy the life of =
the person to whom=20

they are administered, it is manslaughter. The party may not mean to cause =
death, or the=20

medicine may produce beneficent effects, but he has no right to hazard medi=
cine of a dangerous=20

tendency when medical assistance can be obtained. If he does, he does it at=
 his peril.=E2=80=9D[190]=20

_Gross Negligence Defined._=E2=80=94In general it may be stated that gross =
negligence is necessary to=20

constitute criminal liability, but this may be predicated upon, or inferred=
 from, such want of ordinary=20



care and skill as shows gross ignorance, or such want of attention as indic=
ates wilful disregard of=20

the well-known laws of life and health.[191]  _Gross Negligence Resulting i=
n Injury a=20

Misdemeanor._=E2=80=94It has also been held that although death does not bu=
t injury does ensue, as the=20

result of gross negligence or inattention, that constitutes a misdemeanor p=
unishable=20

criminally.[192]  _In Determining Degree of Negligence Circumstances and Co=
nditions=20

Govern._=E2=80=94It should be noted, however, that the circumstances and co=
nditions attending the act of=20

alleged criminal malpractice should be given much weight. So also should du=
e weight be given to=20

the advancement of knowledge and education in the world in general, and in =
the medical=20

profession in particular. In an early English case, one of the judges remar=
ked that not as much=20

knowledge and skill could be expected of a surgeon or physician in a sparse=
ly settled country=20

district as in a city, and that he was at a loss to know what degree of kno=
wledge and skill should=20

be required of such a person. But in Gram _v._ Boener, 56 Ind., 447, Worden=
, J., said: =E2=80=9CIt seems=20

to us that physicians or surgeons practising in small towns, or in poorly o=
r sparsely settled country=20

districts, are bound to possess and exercise at least the average degree of=
 skill possessed and=20

exercised by the profession in such localities generally. It is not true, a=
s we think, to say that if a=20

physician and surgeon has exercised such a degree of skill as is ordinarily=
 exercised in the=20

particular locality in which he practises, that would be sufficient. There =
might be but few practising=20

in the given locality, all of whom might be quacks, ignorant pretenders to =
knowledge not=20

possessed by them, and it would not do to say that because one possessed an=
d exercised as=20

much skill as the other, he could not be chargeable with the want of reason=
able care and=20

skill.=E2=80=9D[193]  _Unlicensed Practitioner Causing Death Guilty of Mans=
laughter._=E2=80=94Since the adoption=20

by most civilized states and countries of the salutary practice of regulati=
ng by statute the practice=20

of medicine and surgery, and forbidding persons not duly licensed from prac=
tising, and making it a=20

misdemeanor to violate any of these statutes, it is clear that any person n=
ot having the requisite=20

medical education and a license, who attempted to administer drugs and medi=
cines or to perform=20

operations, and through want of ordinary knowledge and skill caused the dea=
th of another, would=20

be held guilty of manslaughter, because he brought about the death while he=
 himself was engaged=20

in a violation of the law. In some states where no discrimination in this r=
espect is made between=20

misdemeanors and felonies, the crime would be murder, punishable by death; =
and it has always=20

been the law that an empiric or quack holding himself out as a regular phys=
ician is bound to have=20

and exhibit the degree of skill and care which he professes, and will be st=
rictly held to the standard=20

of skill of educated and licensed medical men.[194]  As to the legal meanin=
g of the term =E2=80=9Cordinary=20

care and skill,=E2=80=9D and the rules of evidence applicable in cases of m=
alpractice, a full discussion will=20

be had below, when considering the subject of civil liability for malpracti=
ce.   CIVIL LIABILITY FOR=20

MALPRACTICE.  Any person holding himself out to be a physician or surgeon, =
or any physician or=20

surgeon, who is guilty of malpractice, is liable for damages, to be recover=
ed in a civil action,=20

instituted by the person injured, or by those having a legal right to such =
person=E2=80=99s services. This is=20

so whether the injured person actually employed the defendant to prescribe =
or treat him, or not.=20

The liability flows out of the relationship, without regard to the element =
of employment, and it may=20

result from negligence in treatment, or in prescribing, or in giving inform=
ation and instructions to=20

the patient as to how to take care of himself when under treatment. The rul=
es of law applicable to=20

the duties of a physician to his patient are stated and the authorities sup=
porting them cited in=20

advancing from step to step with the greatest circumspection. It is in cons=

, and that mere errors of=20

judgment shall be overlooked, if the general character of treatment has bee=

 of the responsibility to=20
