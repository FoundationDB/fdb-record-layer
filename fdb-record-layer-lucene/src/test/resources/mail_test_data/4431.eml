 philodendron monstera Grainger's study, where this latter gentleman, when =
awake, carried on his lifework of keeping a record of prize winners.  "I be=

"You know," he said to Cecil Grainger, who happened to be gracing his wife'=
s dinner-party, "she's=20

the sort of woman for whom a man might consent to live in Venice."  "And sh=
e's the sort of=20

woman," replied, "a man couldn't get to go to Venice."  Lord Ayllington's s=
igh was a proof of an=20

intimate knowledge of the world.  "I suppose not," he said. "It's always so=
. And there are few=20

American women who would throw everything overboard for a grand passion."  =
"You ought to see=20

her on the beach," Mr. Grainger suggested.  "I intend to," said Ayllington.=
 "By the way, not a few of=20

your American women get divorced, and keep their cake and eat it, too. It's=
 a bit difficult, here at=20

Newport, for a stranger, you know."  "I'm willing to bet," declared Mr. Gra=
inger, "that it doesn't pay.=20

When you're divorced and married again you've got to keep up appearances--t=
he first time you=20

don't. Some of these people are working pretty hard."  Whereupon, for the E=
nglishman's=20

enlightenment, he recounted a little gossip.  This, of course, was in the s=
moking room. In the=20

drawing-room, Mrs. Grainger's cousin did not escape, and the biography was =
the subject of=20

laughter.  "You see something of him, I hear," remarked Mrs. Playfair, a la=
dy the deficiency of=20

whose neck was supplied by jewels, and whose conversation sounded like liqu=
id coming out of an=20

inverted bottle. "Is he really serious about the biography?"  "You'll have =
to ask Mr. Grainger,"=20

replied Honora.  "Hugh ought to marry," Mrs. Grenfell observed.  "Why did h=
e come back?"=20

inquired another who had just returned from a prolonged residence abroad. "=
Was there a woman=20

in the case?"  "Put it in the plural, and you'll be nearer right," laughed =
Mrs. Grenfell, and added to=20

Honora, "You'd best take care, my dear, he's dangerous."  Honora seemed to =
be looking down on=20

them from a great height, and to Reginald Farwell alone is due the discover=
y of this altitude; his=20

reputation for astuteness, after that evening, was secure. He had sat next =
her, and had merely put=20

two and two together--an operation that is probably at the root of most pro=
phecies. More than once=20

that summer Mr. Farwell had taken sketches down Honora's lane, for she was =
on what was known=20

as his list of advisers: a sheepfold of ewes, some one had called it, and h=
e was always piqued=20

when one of them went  "We could get his hidden treasure as well, mother," =
Jeremiah had said.=20

"No one but ourselves knows of that. If it were necessary, we could leave E=
ngland for a time." But=20

this suggestion had been stoutly opposed by Mrs. Pamflett. "It would never =
do," she had said.=20

"Our disappearance would draw instant suspicion upon us. We have managed fo=
r him so many=20

years--I here in Parksides, you in the London office. No, Jeremiah; we must=
 stop and brave it out. I=20

am certain there would be very little to fear, and that neither the policem=
an nor the cabman would=20

be able to identify you. Besides, the bracelet restored, there would be no =
charge. The lady's maid=20

stole it, not you, and she will not come back. She is in sure hiding, and s=
o is that monster Captain=20

Ablewhite. You would be safe, Jeremiah--you would be safe." And then she re=
peated, "If Miser=20

Farebrother were out of the way!" Already their dark thoughts had compassed=
 the result. The=20

means had not been mentioned or discussed, but they were ready for any expe=
dient, however=20

desperate which would bring it about and remove the threatened danger. Mrs.=
 Pamflett, to insure=20

her son's safety, was prepared for any risk to herself, for any sacrifice. =
 And here, sitting within a=20

few inches of Jeremiah, was the man whose death meant life and liberty for =
him--was the man=20

who could make a felon of him, who could ruin him absolutely and for ever a=
nd ever! "If he were to=20

die now in his chair!" thought Jeremiah. Then came the thought that Miser F=
arebrother was an old=20

man, weak and nerveless, and that two strong hands around his neck would sq=
ueeze the life out=20

of him in a very few moments. It would be soon over, and there would be an =
end to the tortures=20



Jeremiah was suffering. Meanwhile Miser Farebrother was speaking again.  "W=
ere those the office=20

keys jingling in your pocket, Jeremiah, when you took out your handkerchief=
? Let me see them; it=20

may be the last opportunity I shall have of handling the old friends. Yes, =
here they are, all on a=20

single ring--the key of the office door, the key of the room in which you s=
leep, the keys of the safe=20

and the deed and cash boxes. All here, all here! Have you duplicates of the=
m? No! Then without=20

these keys you could not enter the office, you could not open the safe? Com=
e, old friends, into=20

_my_ drawer you go--and you are=20


_
this, intuition told him that he had taken the name of a deity in vain--and=
 that deity was Chiltern.=20

These reflections resulted in another after-dinner conversation to which we=
 are not supposed to=20

listen.  He found Jerry Shorter in a receptive mood, and there, and the key=
 in my pocket!"  And=20

now, to Jeremiah's astonishment and consternation, Miser Farebrother rose t=
o his feet and stood=20

upright before his knavish clerk. All his apparent weakness had disappeared=
; his face was flushed=20

with anger; in his=20
