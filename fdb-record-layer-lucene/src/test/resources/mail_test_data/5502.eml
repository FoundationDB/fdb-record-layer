rolled in his head and he swayed ecstatically, like a poet composing a rhym=
e.  "And yet you have=20

seen but a wee wedge of one pie!" exclaimed Harold. "It must have pleased Y=
our Majesty, indeed,=20

to make your impression so true."  Red Rex eyed him strangely. "H'm, yes," =

the grass not far from the Red King's seat. He took a step forward now, ben=
ding low. Then he=20

uttered an exclamation.  "Five pies, Your Majesty!" he cried, looking strai=
ght at the King. "There=20

were six, which the old woman stole. Here are five empty pie-plates!"  "Wha=
t a strange=20

uneasily. "These=20

coincidences do happen quite startlingly sometimes. Ha-hum!" He coughed and=
 frowned=20

forbiddingly.  "Surely,     The bale-tree, that our naked hands are riving,=
       Unites to crush us. Ere=20
