This desertion having been planned, they came to me in a body, just as the =
camels and Jali were=20

about to depart, and commenced a series of absurd excuses for their intende=
d desertion. The old=20

grey-headed Moosa, by whose fortune-telling and sorcery the party were inva=
riably guided, had=20

foretold evil. This had confirmed them in their determination to return hom=
e. They were not a bad=20

set of fellows, but, like most of their class, they required peculiar manag=
ement. If natives are=20

driven, they invariably hate their master, and turn sulky; if you give in t=
o them, they lose respect,=20

and will never obey. They are exceedingly subject to sudden impulses, under=
 the influence of=20

which they are utterly unreasonable. As the expedition depends for success =
entirely upon the=20

union of the party, it is highly necessary to obtain so complete a control =
over every individual, that=20

the leader shall be regarded with positive reverence, and his authority in =
all matters accepted as=20

supreme. To gain such a complete ascendancy is a work of time, and is no ea=
sy matter, as an=20

extreme amount of tact and judgment is necessary, combined with great kindn=
ess and common=20

sense, with, at times, great severity. The latter should be avoided as long=
 as possible.  In this=20

instance, the desertion of my Tokrooris would have been a great blow to my =
expedition, as it was=20

necessary to have a division of parties. I had now Tokrooris, Jaleens, and =
Hamran Arabs. Thus=20

they would never unite together, and I was certain to have some upon my sid=
e in a difficulty.=20

Should I lose the Tokrooris, the Hamran Arabs would have the entire prepond=
erance.  The whole=20

of my Tokrooris formed in line before me and my wife, just as the camels we=
re about to leave;=20

each man had his little bundle prepared for starting on a journey. Old Moos=
a was the spokesman,-

-he said that they were all very sorry: that they regretted exceedingly the=
 necessity of leaving us,=20

but some of them were sick, and they would only be a burden to the expediti=
on; that one of them=20

was bound upon a pilgrimage to Mecca, and that God would punish him should =
he neglect this=20

great duty; others had not left any money with their families in Katariff, =
that would starve in their=20

absence. (I had given them an advance of wages, when they engaged at Katari=
ff, to provide=20

against this difficulty.) I replied, "My good there had been two vintages i=
n Tokay in twelve months,=20

one in February, and one in October. Only kings can drink the like of it. O=
n account of the=20

mildness of the winter the vines had been left uncovered, had flowered and =
borne fruit, so that in=20

February they were able to have a vintage, and you can imagine what a flavo=
r those grapes had.=20

There was never anything like it before nor after. Old Gregorics's father u=
sed to call it the "Life-

giver," and often said:  "If a man intending to commit suicide were to drin=
k a thimbleful of it=20

beforehand, he would, if unmarried, go and look up a 'best man,' or, if mar=
ried, would go and sue=20

for a divorce; but kill himself he would not."  The two friends drank to ea=
ch other's health, and=20

Gregorics smacked his lips.  "It's devilish good," he said.  Then he gave t=
he lawyer a sealed=20

packet.  "In that you will find my will," he said. "I sent for you in order=
 to give it you."  He rubbed his=20

hands and smiled.  "There will be some surprises in that."  "Why are you in=
 such a hurry with it?=20

There is plenty of time," said Sztolarik, taking the packet.  Gregorics smi=
led.  "I know more about=20

that than you, Sztolarik. But take a drop more, and don't let us talk of de=
ath. And now I'll tell you=20

how my father got this wine. Well, he was a very sly customer, and if he co=
uldn't get a thing by fair=20

means, he got it by foul, and I have inherited some of his slyness from him=
. But mine is not the=20

genuine article; however, that does not matter. In Zemplin there lived a ve=
ry, very rich man, a=20

count, and an ass into the bargain; at least he was a good-hearted man, and=
 liked to give pleasure=20

to others, thus proving that he was an ass. My father used to buy his wine =
of him, and if they had=20



struck a good bargain the count used to give him a glass of this nectar. Be=
ing an assiduous wine=20

merchant, of course my father was always worrying him to sell him some of t=
he wine, but the count=20

would not hear of it, and said, 'The Emperor Ferdinand has not enough money=
 to buy it!' Well,=20

once when they were drinking a small glass of the 'Life-giver,' my father b=
egan sighing deeply: 'If=20

my poor wife could only drink a thimbleful of this every day for two months=
, I am sure she would=20

get quite well again.' Upon which the count's heart softened, and he called=
 up his major-domo and=20

said: 'Fill Mr. Gregorics's cask=20


_
sorry to hear all this, especially as it comes upon me so suddenly; those w=
ho are sick, stand upon=20

one side" (several invalids, who looked remarkably healthy, stepped to the =
left). "Who wishes to go=20

to Mecca?" Abderachman stepped forward (a huge specimen of a Tokroori, who =
went by the=20

nickname of "El Jamoos," or the buffalo.) "Who wishes to remit money to his=
 family, as I will send it=20

and deduct it from his wages?" No one came forward. During the pause, I cal=
led for pen and=20

paper, which Mahomet brought. I immediately commenced writing, and placed t=
he note within an=20

envelope, which I addressed, and gave to one of the camel-drivers. I then c=
alled for my medicine=20

chest, and having weighed several three-grain doses of tartar emetic, I cal=
led the invalids, and=20

insisted upon their taking the medicine before they started, or they might =
become seriously ill upon=20

the road, which for three days' march was uninhabited. Mixed with a little =
water, the doses were=20

swallowed, and I later several visitors arrived at the castle, and the coun=
t ordered some of the=20

wine to be brought. 'There is none left, sir,' said the butler. 'Why, what =
has become of it?' asked=20

the count. 'Mr. Gregorics took it with him, there was not even enough to fi=
ll his cask!' It was true,=20

for my father had ordered an enormous cask of Mr. Pivak (old Pivak is still=
 alive and remembers=20

the whole story), took the cask in a cart to Zemplin, and, after filling it=
 with the wine, brought it=20

home. Not bad, was it? Drink another glass before you go, Sztolarik."  When=
 the lawyer had gone,=20

Gregorics called his man-servant in.  "Go at once to the ironmonger's and b=
uy a large caldron;=20

then find me two masons and bring them here; but don't speak to a soul abou=
t it."  Now that was=20

Matyko's weak point, but if he had not been told to hold his tongue he migh=
t have managed to do=20

so later on, when the opportunity for speaking came.  "Off you go, and mind=
 you are back in=20

double quick time!"=20


_
for that day, and that the others would not start without them.  I now agai=
n addressed my would-be=20

deserters: "Now, my good fellows, there shall be no misunderstanding betwee=
n us, and I will=20

explain to you how the case stands. You engaged yourselves to me for the wh=
ole journey, and you=20

received the two men into his room, and carefully shut the door.  "Can you =
keep silence?" he=20

asked.  The masons looked at each other surprised, and the elder one answer=
ed.  "Why, of course=20

we can keep silence, that is the first thing a man does on his arrival in t=
his world."  "Yes, until he=20

has learnt to=20
