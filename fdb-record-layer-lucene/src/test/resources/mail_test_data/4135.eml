in spite of the heartbroken protests of Jeanne, Alexander, and his son Caes=
ar Borgia, having received their price, granted a decree _
on moral grounds by asserting that his hero, after whom so many lives were =
patterned, was really=20

not deserving of any imitation; just as an Oriental reformer from India mig=
ht tell us that the traffic=20

and travel of which our architecture is an expression are both of them triv=
ial enterprises, mere=20

distractions from the contemplative ends of life. But such criticism lies o=
utside of art. To=20

understand the discipline which art imposes on us it is enough to observe t=
he kind of character=20

which does make an ideal effective in literature, and the kind that precipi=
tates us into satire.  The=20

real difficulty for the writer is not, then, in his widow could marry none =
but the successor or the heir=20

presumptive to the crown of France; but this stipulation now seemed about t=
o prove unavailing.=20

For the heir presumptive at the time of Anne's widowhood was the little Cou=
nt Francois=20

d'Angouleme, a boy not yet out of the nursery, while the successor of Charl=
es VIII. was already=20

married to Jeanne, sister of the late king. It was a dilemma as serious as =
that solved by Anne de=20

Beaujeu seven years before. But, as has been shown in this case, "be there =
a will, and wisdom=20

finds a way," or if not wisdom, the hocus-pocus of diplomacy. In the presen=
t case it was soon=20

apparent that, on both=20


_
characters which embody his ideal, and which therefore are better than in a=
ctual life; what he will=20

chiefly need for his success is to have the ideals. But even with a conscio=
usness of deep=20

aspiration he may wish to include in the picture whole characters or parts =
of character which are=20

not what they should be, and which yet are likable, even lovable; and to gi=
ve this double effect of=20

inferiority in some sense, together with charm in some sense, is, it seems,=
 very difficult, for this is=20

the effect of comedy, and comedy is rare in any literature, almost entirely=
 absent from our own. If=20

you represent a character as worse than in actual life, the condescending a=
ttitude of the reader will=20

not automatically draw the portrait into some universal relation; the write=
r must add something=20

universally admirable to the particular weakness we look down on. Beatrice =
and Benedick have=20

exhausted their wit, and they are the victims of a plot to marry them off t=
o each other; for such=20

inferiority to their companions we cannot admire them. But Shakespeare make=
s them both loyal to=20

their friends and generous in their delight in life, and Beatrice has the g=
ood sense to know=20

innocence when she sees it; these qualities we can identify with our own vi=
rtues, and for these we=20

admire the hero and heroine. The poet further generalizes both characters b=
y reminding us=20

through their meditations that to fall in love is not the work of reason, a=
nd that even the wittiest=20

scoffers succumb; here too we gladly recognize our own experience. We can t=
herefore smile at=20

the foibles of the young people, partly because these foibles are incident =
to all human nature, and=20

partly because, even with the the bleeding heart of a good woman, that way =
was found and=20

followed by Louis XII.  Before the death of Charles, no one had suspected t=
hat Louis cherished=20

any sentiments but those of loyal respect for Anne de Bretagne. When he saw=
 her go away, taking=20

with her the dowry that had cost so dear, the court discovered that the new=
 king was hopelessly=20

enamored of the mourning Breton widow. Anne was, it is true, personally att=
ractive, and Louis was=20

known to be not only susceptible to feminine charms but deplorably unhappy =
with his own wife;=20

nevertheless, one cannot accord unquestioning faith to the genuineness of a=
n affection that was=20

so obviously politic, whether genuine or counterfeit. Anne, too, despite he=
r widow's weeds and her=20

tears, could not help showing that she left the court with regret. In justi=
ce to her, it cannot be said=20

that she had betrayed her willingness to return Louis's sentiments; yet he =
must have felt=20

reasonably sure of his standing in her heart before he undertook to make ro=
om for her by his side.=20

Almost the first scene of our history has to do with just such an instance =
of shameless quibbling=20

about sacred things as that we must now record. Louis's wife, Jeanne de Fra=
nce, was a good,=20

gentle, loving woman, who had clung with despairing affection to a husband =
who despised her,=20

who was unfaithful to her, who was now to humiliate her. The poor creature =
was unfortunately=20

ugly, and deformed, and twenty-two years of unfailing devotion it was in gr=
eat part owing to her=20

incessant appeals that the young Charles VIII. had liberated Louis from Bou=
rges--had not=20

reconciled the ungrateful husband to the marriage. He now bethought himself=
 that this marriage=20


_
in imagination with the supplementary virtues. Socrates was trying to persu=
ade Aristophanes and=20

Agathon, in the gray dawn after the Symposium, that the art of comedy and t=
he art of tragedy are=20

the same; and so far at least he was right, in that the universal rendering=
 which character must=20

receive in both, gives to the comic effect some of the pity, though none of=
 the terror, which under=20

threat of death from Louis XI, that Jeanne had borne him no children, and t=
hat they were related=20

within the degrees prohibited by the Church. He appealed to the head of the=
 Church, the notorious=20

Alexander VI., to annul an incestuous union that was a burden to his consci=
ence. Needless to say=20

that, in the corrupt papal court of that period, the appeal was supported b=
y arguments=20
