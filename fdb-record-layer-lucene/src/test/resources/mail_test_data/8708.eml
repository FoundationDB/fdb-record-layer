that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the w=

equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000=

important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is=

complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in al=

have shown in a previous chapter how outrageous was the literary attitude t=
oward the fair sex,=20

whom the satirists, big and little, were never tired of belaboring as the a=
uthors of all the evil in the=20

world. Marriage and love are, of course, fertile subjects of satiric humor,=
 as when the groom is=20

age), that, from the=20

 will stay," and stay, and=20

pilgrimage of marriage, "'tis a road to which there is no end till the weak=

was this attitude against which Christine entered a vigorous protest, and s=
he got into a little war of=20

words with two of her contemporaries.  In several of the minor poems noted =
above there are=20

allusions to the wrong of boastfulness, mendacity, and evil speaking about =
women; but in the=20

_Epitre au Dieu d'Amour_ (properly the Epistle _of_, not _to_, the God of L=

What honor is=20

Rose_. Her _Dit de la Rose_ is dated on a day of all others most propitious=
 to lovers, Saint=20

Valentine's day, in the year 1402. Her poem contains the graceful conceptio=
