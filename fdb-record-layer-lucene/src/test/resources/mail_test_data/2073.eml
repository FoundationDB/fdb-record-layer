or she meant it."  "She told me, weeks ago, that she would never be your wife!"  His colour rose, 

his brow darkened; when his answer came, it was as calm as the last.  "Indeed!" he said.  "Then it 

is only one baseness more.  She told me that she had refused you; and that was why we kept our 

engagement secret."  "Tell the truth, Mat Price," I said, well-nigh beside myself with suspicion. 

"Confess that every word of this is false!  Confess that Gianetta will not listen to you, and that you 

are afraid I may succeed where you have failed.  As perhaps I shall--as perhaps I shall, after all!" 

"Are you mad?" he exclaimed.  "What do you mean?"  "That I believe it's just a trick to get me 

away to England--that I don't credit a syllable of your story.  You're a liar, and I hate you!"  He 



rose, and, laying one hand on the back of his chair, looked me sternly in the face.  "If you were not 

Benjamin Hardy," he said, deliberately, "I would thrash you within an inch of your life."  The words 

had no sooner passed his lips than I sprang at him.  I have never been able distinctly to remember 

what followed.  A curse--a blow--a struggle--a moment of blind fury--a cry--a confusion of tongues-

-a circle of strange faces.  Then I see Mat lying back in the arms of a bystander; myself trembling 

and bewildered--the knife dropping from my grasp; blood upon the floor; blood upon my hands; 

blood upon his shirt.  And then I hear those dreadful words:  "O, Ben, you have murdered me!"  He 

did not die--at least, not there and then.  He was carried to the nearest hospital, and lay for some 

weeks between life and death.  His case, they said, was difficult and dangerous.  The knife had 

gone in just below the collarbone, and pierced down into the lungs.  He was not allowed to speak 

or turn--scarcely to breathe with freedom.  He might not even lift his head to drink.  I sat by him 

day and night all through that sorrowful time.  I gave up my situation on the railway; I quitted my 

lodging in the Vicolo Balba; I tried to forget that such a woman as Gianetta Coneglia had ever 

drawn breath.  I lived only for Mat; and he tried to live more, I believe, for my sake than his own. 

Thus, in the bitter silent hours of pain and penitence, when no hand but mine approached his lips 

or smoothed his pillow, the old friendship came back with even more than its old trust and 

faithfulness.  He forgave me, fully and freely; and I would thankfully have given my life for him.  At 

length there came one bright spring morning, when, dismissed as convalescent, he tottered out 

through the hospital gates, leaning on my arm, and feeble as an infant.  He was not cured; neither, 

as I then learned to my horror and anguish, was it possible that he ever could be cured.  He might 

live, with care, for some years; but the lungs were injured beyond hope of remedy, and a strong or 

healthy man he could never be again.  These, spoken aside to me, were the parting words of the 

chief physician, who advised me to take him further south without delay.  I took him to a little 

coast-town called Rocca, some thirty

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with 

the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers 

including obsolete, old, Genoa--a sheltered lonely place along the Riviera, where the sea was 

even bluer than the sky, and the cliffs were green with strange tropical plants, cacti, and aloes, 

and Egyptian palms.  Here we lodged in the house of a small tradesman; and Mat, to use his own 

words, "set to work at getting well in good earnest."  But,

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of 

life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are 

critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm 

collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg 

Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project 

Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

the sea air and watching the sails that came and went in the offing.  By-and-by he could go no 

further than the garden of the house in which we lived.  A little later, and he spent his days on a 

couch beside the open window, waiting patiently for the end.  Ay, for the end!  It had come to that. 

He was fading fast, waning with the waning summer, and conscious that the Reaper was at hand. 

His whole aim now was to soften the agony of my remorse, and prepare me for
