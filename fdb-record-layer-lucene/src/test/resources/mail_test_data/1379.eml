wonderfully Master Rebhila sang!  [44.1. S  _Maitreya._ There are just two =
things that always=20

make me laugh. One is a woman talking Sanskrit, and the other is a man who =
tries to sing soft and=20

low. Now when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like a heifer with a new rope =
through her nose; all=20

you hear is "soo, soo, soo." And when a man tries to developed by Jean Vauq=
uelin de la=20

Fresnaye, and to him we owe an _Art Poetique_ (1575) which adapts to his ow=
n time the teaching=20

of Aristotle and Horace. More interesting than these is JEAN PASSERAT (1534=
-1602), whose=20

spirit is that of old France in its mirth and mockery, and whose more serio=
us verse has the=20

patriotism of French citizenship; his field was small, but he tilled his fi=
eld gaily and courageously.=20

The villanelle _J'ai perdu ma tourterelle_ and the ode on May-day show Pass=
erat's art in its=20

happiest moments.  The way for a reform in dramatic poetry had been in some=
 degree prepared=20

by plays of the sixteenth century, written in Latin--the work of Buchanan, =
Muret, and others--by=20

translations from Terence, Sophocles, Euripides, translations from Italian =
comedy, and renderings=20

of one Spanish model, the highly-popular _Celestina_ of=20

p. No, I don't like it!=20

_Charudatta._ My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully this evening.=
 And still you are not=20

satisfied.      The notes of love, peace, sweetness, could I trace,       T=
he note that thrills, the note=20

of passion too,     The note of woman's loveliness and grace--       Ah, my=
 poor words add nothing,=20

nothing new!     But as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,     I thought i=
t was my hidden love who=20

sang.                    4      The melody of song, the stricken strings   =
  In undertone that half-

unconscious clings,     More clearly sounding when the passions rise,     B=
ut ever sweeter as the=20

music dies.     Words that strong Fernando de Rojas. The Latin plays were a=
cted in schools. The=20

first performance of a play in French belonging to the new tendency was tha=
t of Ronsard's=20

translation of the Plutus of Aristophanes, in 1549, by his friends of the C=
ollege de Coqueret. It was=20

only by amateurs, and before a limited scholarly group of spectators, that =
the new classical=20

tragedies could be presented. Gradually both tragedy and comedy came to be =
written solely with a=20

view to publication in print. The mediaeval drama still held the stage.  JO=
DELLE'S _Cleopatre_=20

(1552), performed with enthusiasm by amateurs, was therefore a false start;=
 it was essentially=20

literary, and not theatrical. Greek models were crudely imitated, with a la=
ck of almost everything=20

that=20

Yet checks their second utterance--in vain;     For music sweet as this liv=
es on, until     I walk as=20

hearing sweetest music still.                      5  _Maitreya._ But see, =
my friend! The very dogs are=20

sound asleep in the shops that look out on the market. Let us go home. [_He=
 looks before him._]=20

Look, look! The blessed moon seems to give place to darkness, as she descen=
ds from her palace=20

in heaven.  _Charudatta._ True.      The moon gives place to darkness as sh=
e dips     Behind the=20

western mountain; and the tips     Of her uplifted horns alone appear,     =
Like two sharp-pointed=20

tusks uplifted clear,     Where bathes an elephant in waters cool,     Who =
shows naught else above=20

the jungle pool.                 6  P. 89.1]  _Maitreya._ Well, here is our=
 house. Vardhamanaka,=20

Vardhamanaka, open the door!  _Vardhamanaka._ I hear Maitreya's voice. Char=
udatta has=20

returned. I must open the door for him. [_He does so._] Master, I salute yo=
u. Maitreya, I salute you=20

too. The couch is ready. Pray be seated. [_Charudatta and Maitreya enter an=
d seat themselves._]=20

_Maitreya._ Vardhamanaka, call Radanika to wash our feet.  _Charudatta._ [_=
Compassionately._]=20

She sleeps. Do not wake her.  _Vardhamanaka._ I will bring more accessible =
than Sophocles, and=20

his faults were easy to imitate--his moralisings, his declamatory passages,=
 his excess of=20

emphasis. The so-called Aristotelian dramatic canons, formulated by Scalige=
r in his Poetic, were=20

rigorously applied. Unity of place is preserved in _Cleopatre_; the time of=
 the action is reduced to=20

twelve hours; there are interminable monologues, choral moralities, a ghost=
 (in Seneca's manner),=20

a narration of the heroine's death; of action there is none, the stage stan=
ds still. If Jodelle's=20

_Didon_ has some literary merit, it has little dramatic vitality. The orato=
rical energy of Grevin's=20

_Jules Cesar_, the studies of history in _La Mort de Daire_ and _La Mort d'=
Alexandre_, by=20

Jacques de La Taille, do not compensate their deficiency in the qualities r=
equired by the theatre.=20

One tragedy alone, _La Sultane_, by Gabriel Bounin (1561), amid its violenc=
es and=20

extravagances, shows a feeling for dramatic action and scenic effect.  Coul=
d the mediaeval=20

mystery and classical tragedy be reconciled? The Protestant Reformer Beze, =
in his _Sacrifice=20

d'Abraham_, attempted something of the kind; his sacred drama is a mystery =
by its subject, a=20

tragedy in the conduct of the action. Three tragedies on the=20

he son of a slave that=20

he is, for he is bringing water. But he makes me wash your feet, and I am a=
 Brahman.=20

_Charudatta._ Good Maitreya, do you bring the water, and Vardhamanaka shall=
 wash my feet.=20

_Vardhamanaka._ Yes, Maitreya. Do you bring the water. [_Maitreya does so. =
Vardhamanaka=20

published in 1556 by Loys Des-Masures: the stage arrangements are those of =
the mediaeval=20

drama, but the unity of time is observed, and chorus and semi-chorus respon=
d in alternate strains.=20

No junction of dramatic systems essentially opposed proved in the end possi=
ble. When Jean de La=20
