mesteads for miles=20

around, no cattle grazing, no pastures, no hedges, nothing--just arid waste=
land with here and=20

peech, although not=20

so broad as that of his father, was tinged with similar characteristics.  "=
It will be better to rescue=20

than to kill."  This was so obvious a truism that his companions laughed, b=
ut Duncan had uttered it=20

almost as a soliloquy, for he was thinking at the moment of poor Perrin, wh=

ad just stumbled and=20

the inexperienced rider had been very nearly pitched over into the mud.  "I=

as you are, Mounzeer," observed the countryman laconically.  "I thought you=

muttered the stranger.  "'Ave I not brought you safely through the darkness=

back from him a little, and kept a watchful eye on his movements.  So did V=
