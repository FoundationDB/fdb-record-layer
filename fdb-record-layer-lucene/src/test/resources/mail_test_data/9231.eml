s where the tourists=20

used to feed the doves, but to me it seemed as beautiful. For upon the squa=
re was the famous=20

arcade which Palladio erected around the city-hall of the place. It stood b=
eautiful and gloomy=20

before us in the moonlight, one of the world's real bits of architecture. A=
s Americans we had a=20

special interest in the arcade because it was typical of the best of Pallad=
io's work and our own=20

Thomas Jefferson, studying it, had reproduced it and Americanized it in som=
e of the buildings of=20

the University of Virginia, buildings that have had a the Guainares; others=
 insist, from hatred to the=20

Capuchins of the Carony, and the Observantins of the Orinoco, that the fair=
 Indians are what are=20

called in Dalmatia muso di frate, children whose legitimacy is somewhat dou=
btful. In either case=20

the Indios blancos would be mestizos, that is to say, children of an Indian=
 woman and a white=20

man. Now, having seen thousands of mestizos, I can assert that this supposi=
tion is altogether=20

inaccurate. The individuals of the fair tribes whom we examined, have the f=
eatures, the stature,=20

and the smooth, straight, black hair which characterises other Indians. It =
would be impossible to=20

take=20


_
American architecture! A number of Palladio's other works we saw that night=
, softened and=20

glorified by the moonlight. And we saw also an old French house, not twenty=
-five feet wide, but a=20

gem of French architecture erected before the discovery of America. Finally=
 we went back and=20

stood by the statue of Palladio and listened to the low rumble of the guns =
on the front and=20

wondered what the Germans would do with such a lovely thing as this Vicenza=
 if by any chance=20

they ever took it. That day we had looked down from a mountain-top upon an =
Austrian town lying=20

peacefully in the valley below us directly under the Italian guns. The guns=
 of the Austrians and the=20

Italians were smashing away at each other from the mountain-tops over and a=
cross the town.=20

"You could pulverize that town easily enough," Henry said to the Italian wh=
o was taking the=20

Americans through the trenches.  "Oh, yes," he answered. "But it's a beauti=
ful little town! Why ruin=20

it?" His theory was that if the Italians took it they would want it whole a=
nd would want descendants=20

of natives and Europeans. Some of these people are very little, others are =
of the ordinary stature=20

of the copper-coloured Indians. They are neither feeble nor sickly, nor are=
 they albinos; and they=20

differ from the copper-coloured races only by a much less tawny skin. It wo=
uld be useless, after=20

these considerations, to insist on the distance of the mountains of the Upp=
er Orinoco from the=20

shores inhabited by the Dutch. I will not deny that descendants of fugitive=
 negroes may have been=20

seen among the Caribs, at the sources of the Essequibo; but no white man ev=
er went from the=20

eastern coast to the Rio Gehette and the Ocamo, in the interior of Guiana. =
It must also be=20

observed, although we may be struck with the singularity of several fair tr=
ibes being found at one=20

point to the east of Esmeralda, it is no less certain, that tribes have bee=
n found in other parts of=20

America, distinguished from the neighbouring tribes by the less tawny colou=
r of their skin. Such=20

are the Arivirianos and Maquiritares of the Rio=20


_
the town; if they did not take it, why smash a beautiful little town just t=
o be smashing?  The=20

German theory, of course, is exactly opposite to this. They would smash the=
 town, if they were to=20

take it, to put fear into the hearts of the inhabitants and command obedien=
ce; and if they knew=20

they could not take it they would smash it to cripple the enemy that much! =
We of the Allies desire=20

respect and loyalty that come from reason. The Germans demand unreasoning o=
bedience and=20

denied that, they destroy. One philosophy is Christian; the other Babylonia=
n. But the devilish=20

strength of the German philosophy came to us more forcibly in Italy than it=
 came elsewhere=20

because of certain contrasts. They were contrasts in what might be called p=
ublic wisdom. The=20

Germans take better care of their poor than some of the Allies. The Germans=
 know that poverty is=20

a curse to a nation, and during the past generation they have done much to =
alleviate it. And in=20

alleviating poverty they have kept their poor docile; and they go into batt=
le feeling that they have=20

something to fight for. In the allied countries too often we have let the d=
evil take the hindermost.=20

As we rode one afternoon from Vicenza to Milan we wondered, looking at the =
farms and the=20

farmers along the road, why those farmers should be asked to die for a coun=
try that kept them in=20

so low an estate. And yet they were better off than the farmers of Southern=
 Italy. But in socializing=20

industry the Italian farmer has been forgotten, and when the press came upo=
n the Italian front,=20

thousands of ignorant peasant soldiers lay down their arms, deluded by a Ge=
rman spy ruse so=20

simple that it should have fooled no intelligent soldier. But they were not=
 intelligent. Their=20

intelligence had been eaten up by their landlords for generations, and in a=
 crisis the German=20

civilization overcame its enemy! You cannot shake the sleeping peasant on t=
he wine-cart from a=20

thousand years' sleep and make him get up and go out and whip a soldier Ere=
vato, the Viras and=20

Araguas of the Caura, the Mologagos of Brazil, and the Guayanas of the Urug=
uay.* (* The=20

Cumanagotos, the Maypures, the Mapojos, and some hordes of the Tamanacs, ar=
e also fair, but=20

in a less degree than the tribes I have just named. We may add to this list=
 (which the researches=20

of Sommering, Blumenbach, and Pritchard, on the varieties of the human spec=
ies, have rendered=20

so interesting) the Ojes of the Cuchivero, the Boanes (now almost destroyed=
) of the interior of=20

Brazil, and in the north of America, far from the north-west coast, the Man=
dans and the Akanas=20

(Walkenaer, Geogr. page 645. Gili volume 2 page 34. Vater, Amerikan. Sprach=
en page 81.=20

Southey volume 1 page 603.) The most tawny, we might almost say the blackes=
t of the American=20

race, are the Otomacs and the Guamos. These have perhaps given rise to the =
confused notions of=20

American negroes, spread through Europe in the early times of the conquest.=
 (Herrera Dec 1 lib 3=20

cap 9, volume 1 page 79. Garcia, Origen de los Americanos page 259.) Who ar=
e those Negros de=20

Quereca, placed by Gomara page 277, in that very isthmus of Panama, whence =
we received the=20

first absurd tales of an albino American people? In reading with attention =
the authors of the=20

beginning of the 16th century, we see that the discovery of America and of =
a new race of men, had=20

singularly awakened the interest of travellers respecting the varieties of =
our species. Now, if a=20

black race had been mingled with copper-colored men, as in the South-sea Is=
lands, the=20

conquistadores would not have failed to speak of it in a precise manner. Be=
sides, the religious=20

traditions of the Americans relate the appearance, in the heroic times, of =
white and bearded men=20

as priests and legislators; but none of these traditions make mention of a =
black race.)  These=20

phenomena are so much the more worthy of attention as they are observed in =
that great branch of=20

the American nations generally ranked in a class totally opposite to that=
=20


_
is even half awake!  As we rode from Vicenza to Milan we had a curious expe=
rience. There=20

entered our compartment at twilight one of the carabinieri! We had been loo=
king with admiration at=20

the carabinieri for days. They were well-set-up soldiers, apparently of a p=
icked grade of men, who=20

wore wide cocked hats, like those worn by the British troops in the Tschoug=
az-Esquimaux,* whose=20

children are fair, and who acquire the Mongol or yellowish tint only from t=
he influence of the air and=20

the humidity. (* The Chevalier Gieseke has recently confirmed all that Kran=
tz related of the colour=20

of the skin of the Esquimaux. That race (even in the latitude of seventy-fi=
ve and seventy-six=20

degrees, where the climate is so=20
