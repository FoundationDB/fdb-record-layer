Charudatta appears, seated._]  _Charudatta._ [_Looks up._]      An untimely storm[60] is 

gathering. For see!     The peacocks gaze and lift their fans on high;       The swans forget their 

purpose to depart;     The untimely storm afflicts the blackened sky,       And the wistful lover's 

heart.                             1  And again:      The wet bull's belly wears no deeper dye;       In the 

_Guirlande de Julie_ on Mademoiselle's fete; they gravely debated the question which should be 

the approved spelling, _muscadin_ or _muscardin_. In 1649 they were sundered into rival parties--

_Uranistes_ and _Jobelins_--tilting in literary lists on behalf of the respective merits of a sonnet by 

Voiture and a sonnet by Benserade. The word _precieux_ is said to date from 1650. The Marquise 

de Rambouillet survived Moliere's satiric comedy _Les Precieuses Ridicules_ (1659) by several

illustrious personages of the decline of her _salon_. We smile at its follies and affectations; but, 

while it harmed literature by magnifying things that were petty, it did something to refine manners, 

to quicken ideas, to encourage clearness and grace of expression, and to make the pursuit of 

letters an avenue to social distinction. Through the Hotel de Rambouillet, and the

instead of bugle strains,       And garmented in lightning's silken robe.     Approaches now the

literature became a power for good and for evil.  The "Works," as they were styled, of VINCENT 

VOITURE (1598-1648)--posthumously published--represent one side of the spirit of the _salon_. 

Capable of something higher, he lived to exhibit his ingenuity and wit in little ways, now by a
