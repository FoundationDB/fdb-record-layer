Mr. Hatfield squatted by the fire and said in a friendly way: "How are things hole in the bank.  Jake helped grandmother to the ground, saying he would bring the provisions after he had blanketed his horses. We went slowly up the icy path toward the door sunk in the _
smoke rising lazily from the woods.  "Someone must have a camp fire back in there," he 

remarked.  "It's a rather dangerous place to start a fire," Mr. Hatfield said. "Suppose we 

investigate."  Turning aside from the road, the Cubs climbed a rail fence and made their way 

through the thickets. Picking a trail carefully, Mr. Hatfield led them single file.  "Quiet, boys," he 

advised as Babe kept shuffling his feet through the dry leaves. "No use advertising ourselves." 

Before the Cubs had gone far into the woods, they could smell the aroma of food cooking.  Mr. 

Hatfield signaled for the boys to slow their pace. Treading noiselessly, they approached with 

caution.  At the edge of a small clearing the Cub leader abruptly halted.  Eager to see what it was 

that had drawn and held their leaders attention, the boys closed in about him.  "Can you beat that!" 

Dan whispered.  Directly ahead was a wind-sheltered hollow, framed by bare trees. A camp fire 

had been built close to the banks of a winding stream. On a crudely constructed spit, a dressed 

rabbit slowly broiled over the coals.  The one who turned the spit had his back to the Cubs. He 

was wrapped deeply in a heavy coat many sizes too large for his lean frame. Beside him lay a 

rifle.  But even though the Cubs could not see the lad's face, they recognized him instantly. The 

one who sat so contentedly by his fire, gazing off into space, was Jack Phillips. 

CHAPTER 15                             A Hint from Jack   Mr. Hatfield did not fail to note the rifle, which 

he knew had been taken from Mrs. Jones' home. Undoubtedly it was loaded, he reasoned. If Jack 

were disposed to make trouble, he easily could do so.  take his hard feeling out on that poor 

woman; but he had a sullen eye for me, all right! Now, did you ever hear of a young feller's having 

such hard luck, Mrs. Burden?"  Grandmother told him she was sure the Lord had remembered 

these things to his credit, and had helped him out of many a scrape when he did n't realize that he 

was being protected by Providence.     X   FOR several weeks after my sleigh-ride, we heard 

nothing from the Shimerdas. My sore throat kept me indoors, and grandmother had a cold which 

made the housework heavy for her. When Sunday came she was glad to have a day of rest. One 

night at supper Fuchs told us he had seen Mr. Shimerda out hunting.  "He's made himself a rabbit-

skin cap, Jim, and a rabbit-skin collar that he buttons on outside his coat. They ain't got but one 

overcoat among 'em over there, and they take turns wearing it. They seem awful scared of cold, 

and stick in that hole in the bank like badgers."  "All but the crazy boy," Jake put in. "He never 

wears the coat. Krajiek says he's turrible strong and can stand anything. I guess rabbits must be 

getting scarce in this locality. Ambrosch come along by the cornfield yesterday where I was at 

work and showed me three prairie dogs he'd shot. He asked me if they was good to eat. I spit and 

made a face and took on, to scare him, but he just looked like he was smarter'n me and put 'em 

back in his sack and walked off."  Grandmother looked up in alarm and spoke to grandfather. 

"Josiah, you don't suppose Krajiek would let them poor creatures eat prairie dogs, do you?"  "You 

had better go over and see our neighbors to-morrow, Emmaline," he replied gravely.  Fuchs put in 

a cheerful word and said prairie dogs were clean

boldly into the clearing.  Hearing the crackle of a stick, Jack whirled around.  Instinctively, he 

reached for the rifle. Then, recognizing Mr. Hatfield, he merely allowed his hand to rest on the butt. 

His attitude however, was wary.  "How are you, Jack?" the Cub leader greeted him. "A nice little 

camp you have here. Did you shoot the ought to be good for food, but their family connections 

were against them. I asked what he meant, and he grinned and said they belonged to the rat 

family.  When I went downstairs in the morning, I found grandmother and Jake packing a hamper 

basket in the kitchen.  "Now, Jake," grandmother was saying, "if you can find that old rooster 


_
"Who else?" Jack retorted a trifle defiantly.  "You did a good job of cleaning it too," the Cub leader 

praised him. "I can see you're handy and know how to get along."  Jack made no reply. Guardedly 

he eyed the Cubs, who gradually had circled in around the camp fire.  "No biscuits?" demanded 

Red, scanning every inch of the camp.  "I never learned how to bake 'em," Jack admitted, relaxing 

a bit. "You have to have an oven for that."  "A reflector oven isn't hard to make," Mr. Hatfield said. 

"Any of the Cubs could teach you."  "They could?" Jack along. There's no good reason why Mrs. 

Shimerda could n't have got hens from her neighbors last fall and had a henhouse going by now. I 

reckon she was confused and did n't know where to begin. I've come strange to a new country 

myself, but I never forgot hens are a good thing to have, no matter what you don't have."  "Just as 

you say, mam," said Jake, "but I hate to think of Krajiek getting a leg of that old rooster." He 

tramped out through the long cellar and dropped the heavy door behind him.  After breakfast 

grandmother and Jake and I bundled

learn."  "You come with us on our next hike, and we'll show you," Mr. Hatfield promised.  "But I'm 

not a Cub."  "That makes no difference. Glad to have you." Jack's face lighted up, and then the old 

look of frustration returned.  "Thanks," he said, "but I can't make it. The Widow wouldn't let me go. 

She keeps me chop, chop, chopping wood night and day."  climbed into the cold front wagon-seat. 

As we approached the Shimerdas' we heard the frosty whine of the pump and saw Antonia, her 

head tied up and her cotton dress blown about her, throwing all her weight on the pump-handle as 

it went up and down. She heard our wagon, looked back over her shoulder, and catching up her 

pail of water, started at a run for the
