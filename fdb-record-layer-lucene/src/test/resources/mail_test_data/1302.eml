The Frenchman read the letter, reseated himself, and with a bow handed back=
 the note.  "I was=20

precipitate, Milor. All this is very irregular; but we advance, though slow=
ly."  "Yes, I suppose we do,=20

worse luck. I'll tell you what I'll do. Old Pepper is stopping in this hote=
l; there seems to be nothing=20

else for it, I'll send for him," said his lordship with a sigh, and he rang=
 the bell.  The waiter who=20

answered it was directed to present his lordship's compliments to General P=
epper, and to request=20

his immediate presence.  The Indian warrior had just breakfasted, and enter=
ed the room in a few=20

minutes. He was introduced to the Frenchman; a few words from Lord Spunyarn=
 sufficiently=20

explained the matter.  "I understand then, Monsieur de Kerguel," said the g=
eneral, "that we are the=20

challenged party. As such we are entitled to a choice of weapons?"  Monsieu=
r de Kerguel bowed.=20

"Assuredly, Monsieur le General," he replied.  "You will excuse us then for=
 an instant?" said he, as=20

he motioned Spunyarn to the window. "This is a beastly affair, your lordshi=
p. It won't admit of=20

arrangement. Do you know if the Frenchman is best at swords or pistols?"  "=
Can't say, I'm sure,"=20

replied his lordship; "probably he's a dab at both. I know he was a newspap=
er man. They all are=20

fighting men."  "It's most unfortunate for our man; they'll have to fight. =
Is Haggard any good at=20

either?"  "I don't think he can shoot, at least not in a regulation affair.=
 I know he can use a revolver,=20

and he is very good at single-stick."  "It's a heavy responsibility," repli=
ed the general seriously. "If it=20

had been arranged for this morning at dawn we might have had a chance with =
the pistols, for=20

perhaps the Frenchman's hand would have been unsteady. I suppose it was a g=
ood knock-down=20

blow?"  "A regular snorter!" said his lordship with enthusiasm.  "Most unfo=
rtunate. Well, we must=20

try our luck with a regulation sabre; they can't well refuse it; ours is th=
e stronger and bigger man. I=20

don't think there's any room for doubt, eh? But it's a precious nuisance. M=
an's got his wife here=20

too. It's sure to be in the papers. Beastly nuisance; we shall all have to =
clear out, for I suppose it=20

won't be a mere matter of scratches. It must come off at once too, or we sh=
all be suspected of=20

shirking. I think that's the only course," said the general as he pulled do=
wn his wristbands.  "I'm=20

afraid so," said his lordship.  They rejoined the Frenchman.  "Monsieur de =
Kerguel," said the=20

general, seating himself, "we have elected to choose sabres, regulation sab=
res; you have no=20

objection, I suppose?"  "Sir, the weapon is unusual. As you are doubtless a=
ware, between civilians=20

the small-sword, the rapier and the pistol are what are usually employed. T=
he sabre is unusual,=20

and as a rule only employed in settling the little differences of officers =
of cavalry."  "Monsieur de=20

Kerguel, his lordship and I are here in the interests of our friend Haggard=
. You are possibly=20

unaware that among English gentlemen the duel has ceased to be a means in t=
hese degenerate=20

days of settling disputes. Unfortunately our principal has directed us in w=
riting to agree to your=20

wishes; and his lordship here has, somewhat indiscreetly, I must remark, ta=
ken you into his=20

confidence. As he has done so, sir," said the general, "and bearing in mind=
 that we are in a foreign=20

country, and that unfortunately a blow has been struck, we feel ourselves r=
eluctantly compelled to=20

accept the proposed meeting. It is therefore our duty, sir, to protect our =
principal, and we cannot=20

consent to abate one jot or tittle of our rights. Should you decline the we=
apon proposed no=20

meeting can evidently take place," here the general gave a little sigh; "Lo=
rd Spunyarn is of the=20

same opinion. It is then for you to accept or refuse; in the latter case th=
e matter must definitely end=20

here."  The Frenchman paused and thought.  "Unfortunately, gentlemen," he r=
eplied, "my principal=20

has left me no choice; he naturally declines any apology----"  "You will pl=
ease to observe.=20

Monsieur de Kerguel, that we have offered none," interrupted the general; "=
in our humble opinion=20



the original insult, as well as the challenge, comes from you, and we canno=
t deviate from our=20

position. We decline to modify our terms in any way. And I would respectful=
ly suggest that this=20

interview must definitely terminate the matter one way or the other. I woul=
d remark," fiercely added=20

the general, "that neither we nor our principal are to be cajoled or intimi=
dated."  "It shall be as you=20

say, general. Nothing remains then, I think, for us but to name a time and =
place. The weapons, the=20

most unusual weapons, we are reluctantly compelled to accept under protest.=
 Have you any=20

suggestion to offer, general?"  "None whatever, sir. One party shall provid=
e a surgeon, the other a=20

pair of ordinary cavalry sabres. You as a resident in this infernal hole ca=
n doubtless suggest a=20

suitable spot for the meeting. Of course you will be provided with a second=
 friend. As to time, the=20

sooner the better. We then, if it suits you, will bring a pair of regulatio=
n sabres. You, perhaps, will=20

bring a doctor who will act for both men. Perhaps you will also oblige us b=
y naming the time and=20

place of clearly not that of an Englishman, for he wore ear-rings.  The car=
riage drove off, and the=20

passenger, somewhat forcing his way through the clustering group, continued=
 his course until he=20

reached the cab-stand near the Marble Arch, when he engaged a vehicle and o=
rdered to be driven=20

to Leicester Square. That quarter of the town exhibits an animated scene to=
ward the witching=20

hour; many lights and much population, illuminated coffee-houses, the stir =
of a large theatre,=20

bands of music in the open air, and other sounds, most of them gay, and som=
e festive. The=20

stranger, whose compact figure was shrouded by a long fur cape, had not the=
 appearance of=20

being influenced by the temptation of amusement. As he stopped in the squar=
e and looked around=20

him, the expression of his countenance was moody, perhaps even anxious. He =
seemed to be=20

making observations on the locality, and, after a few minutes, crossed the =
open space and turned=20

up into a small street which opened into the square. In this street was a c=
offee-house of some=20

pretension, connected indeed with an hotel, which had been formed out of tw=
o houses, and=20

therefore possessed no inconsiderable accommodation.  The coffee-room was c=
apacious, and=20

adorned in a manner which intimated it was not kept by an Englishman, or mu=
ch used by=20

Englishmen. The walls were painted in frescoed arabesques. There were many =
guests, principally=20

seated at small tables of marble, and on benches and chairs covered with a =
coarse crimson=20

velvet. Some were sipping coffee, some were drinking wine, others were smok=
ing or playing=20

dominoes, or doing both; while many were engaged in reading the foreign jou=
rnals which=20

abounded.  An ever-vigilant waiter was at the side of the stranger the inst=
ant he entered, and=20

wished to know his pleasure. The stranger was examining with his keen eye e=
very individual in the=20

room while this question was asked and repeated.  =E2=80=9CWhat would I wis=
h?=E2=80=9D said the stranger, having=20

concluded his inspection, and as it were summoning back his recollection. =
=E2=80=9CI would wish to see,=20

and at once, one Mr. Perroni, who, I believe, lives here.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=
=9CWhy, =E2=80=98tis the master!=E2=80=9D exclaimed the=20

waiter.  =E2=80=9CWell, then, go and tell the master that I want him.=E2=80=
=9D  =E2=80=9CBut the master is much engaged,=E2=80=9D=20

said the waiter, =E2=80=9C=E2=80=94particularly.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI dare =
say; but you will go and tell him that I particularly want to=20

see him.=E2=80=9D  The waiter, though prepared to be impertinent to any one=
 else, felt that one was=20

speaking to him who must be obeyed, and, with a subdued, but hesitating man=
ner, said, =E2=80=9CThere is=20

a meeting to-night up-stairs, where the master is secretary, and it is diff=
icult to see him; but, if I=20

could see him, what name am I to give?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou will go to hi=
m instantly,=E2=80=9D said the stranger, =E2=80=9Cand you=20

will tell him that he is wanted by Captain Bruges.=E2=80=9D  The waiter was=
 not long absent, and returning=20

with an obsequious bow, he invited the stranger to follow him to a private =
room, where he was=20



alone only for a few seconds, for the door opened and he was joined by Perr=
oni.  =E2=80=9CAh! my=20

general,=E2=80=9D exclaimed the master of the coffee-house, and he kissed t=
he stranger=E2=80=99s hand. =E2=80=9CYou=20

received my telegram?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI am here. Now what is your busine=
ss?=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThere is business, and great=20

business, if you will do it; business for you.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, I a=
m a soldier, and soldiering is my trade, and I=20

do not much care what I do in that way, provided it is not against the good=
 cause. But I must tell=20

you at once, friend Perroni, I am not a man who will take a leap in the dar=
k. I must form my own=20

staff, and I must have my commissariat secure.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CMy genera=
l, you will be master of your own=20

terms. The Standing Committee of the Holy Alliance of Peoples are sitting u=
pstairs at this moment.=20

They were unanimous in sending for you. See them; judge for yourself; and, =
rest assured, you will=20

be satisfied.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI do not much like having to do with commi=
ttees,=E2=80=9D said the general. =E2=80=9CHowever, let it=20

be as you like=E2=80=94I will see them.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CI had better jus=
t announce your arrival,=E2=80=9D said Perroni. =E2=80=9CAnd will=20

=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CA glass of sugar-and-

water. You know, I am not easily tired. And, I agree with you, it is better=
 to come to business at=20

once: so prepare them.=E2=80=9D       CHAPTER 11 The Standing Committee of =
the Holy Alliance of=20

Peoples all rose, although they were extreme republicans, when the general =
entered. Such is the=20

magical influence of a man of action over men of the pen and the tongue. Ha=
d it been, instead of a=20

successful military leader, an orator that had inspired Europe, or a journa=
list who had rights of the=20

human race, the Standing Committee would have only seen men of their own ki=
dney, who, having=20

been favored with happier opportunities than themselves, had reaped a harve=
st which, equally=20

favored, they might here have garnered.  =E2=80=9CGeneral,=E2=80=9D said Fe=
lix Drolin, the president, who was=20

looked upon by the brotherhood as a statesman, for he had been in his time,=
 a member of a=20

provisional government, =E2=80=9Cthis seat is for you,=E2=80=9D and he poin=
ted to one on his right hand. =E2=80=9CYou are=20

ever welcome; and I hope you bring good tidings, and good fortune.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CI am glad to be among my=20

friends, and I may say,=E2=80=9D looking around, =E2=80=9Cmy comrades. I=20

"Gentlemen, the mill at St. Stefano is only four miles off; it is secluded;=
 we shall not be disturbed.=20

You know the place? Five o'clock will, I think, suit us all? Is it agreed?"=
  The general bowed.=20

"Gentlemen, I have the honour to salute you," said Monsieur de Kerguel with=
 a profound=20

obeisance.  The general rang the bell, and Monsieur Barbiche's friend took =
his leave.  "Thank=20

God!" piously exclaimed the general. "I had him there; Haggard is the bigge=
r and more powerful=20

man, of that there is no doubt. It shall not be my fault if they don't sett=
le their differences with the=20

longest and heaviest pair of regulation sabres to be had in Rome for love o=
r money. It's quite=20

against the rule, you know, but you say our man is good at single-stick, so=
 he may have the luck to=20

smash him or cut him down before the Frenchman spits him, as he is bound to=
 do if he gets the=20

chance. And I'll tell you what it is, my lord, I'll take a glass of curacao=
, for I'm dry with talking."  The=20

curacao was duly brought, and certainly the general deserved it. The experi=
enced warrior had=20

perceived that De Kerguel was bent on mischief, and by his own coyness he h=
ad succeeded in=20

beguiling the  =E2=80=9CBut now they have left Rome,=E2=80=9D said the pres=
ident, =E2=80=9Cevery day we expect good=20

news.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CAy, ay! he has left Rome, but he has not left Rome=
 with the door open. I hope it is not on=20

such gossip you have sent for me. You have something on hand. What is it?=
=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CYou shall hear it=20

from the fountain-head,=E2=80=9D said the president, =E2=80=9Cfresh from Ne=
w York,=E2=80=9D and he pointed to an individual=20

seated in the centre of the table.  =E2=80=9CAh! Colonel Finucane,=E2=80=9D=
 said the general, =E2=80=9CI have not forgotten=20

James River. You did that well. What is the trick now?=E2=80=9D  Whereupon =
a tall, lean man, with a=20

decided brogue, but speaking through his nose, rose from his seat and infor=
med the general that=20

the Irish people were organized and ready to rise; that they had sent their=
 deputies to New York;=20

all they wanted were arms and officers; that the American brethren had agre=
ed to supply them=20

with both, and amply; and that considerable subscriptions were raising for =
other purposes. What=20

they now required was a commander-in-chief equal to the occasion, and in wh=
om all would have=20

confidence; and therefore they had telegraphed for the general.  =E2=80=9CI=
 doubt not our friends over the=20

water would send us plenty of rifles,=E2=80=9D said=20


_
accepting a weapon of the use of which his principal was probably totally i=
gnorant. The men would=20

then theoretically meet on an equality. But a cavalry sabre is a big and co=
mparatively awkward=20

weapon, and supposing that both were equally unskilled in its use, Haggard,=
 as the taller and=20

stronger man, would certainly have know men now in the States from whom I c=
ould form a good=20

staff; but how about the people of Ireland? What evidence have we that they=
 will rise, if we land?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThe best,=E2=80=9D said the president. =E2=80=9CWe have a head-cen=
tre here, Citizen Desmond, who will give you=20

the most recent and the most authentic intelligence on that head.=E2=80=9D=
=20


_
this the old general meant it, when he had stated his design to provide a s=
pecially heavy pair of=20

weapons.  In his great anxiety to secure a meeting at any price, De Kerguel=
 had been compelled=20

to accept the general's ultimatum with regard to weapons, "these or none;" =
but he knew that his=20

principal thirsted for blood, so he gave way, and it seemed to him at the t=
ime that the trifling matter=20

of providing the weapons was of little moment. But ere he reached his frien=
d's hotel he felt that he=20

had been caught napping.  Barbiche was extended upon a couch. A huge piece =
of black court=20

plaister hid the wound on his swollen lip, a cup of _tisane_ stood upon the=
 table. He was dabbing=20

his forehead with toilet vinegar. His head was bound with a scarlet and yel=
low silk handkerchief=20

which he wore after the manner of a nightcap, as is the custom of his count=
ry. As his friend=20

entered he sprang to his feet.  "Have you arranged it, De Kerguel? Will he =
meet me, or are these=20

Englishmen brave only with their fists?"  "Do not excite yourself, Emile; y=
ou will have need of all=20

your skill, of all your courage."  "He will come, then, this protector of t=
he _demi-monde_, this model=20

moral English husband. Say, is it sword or pistols, De Kerguel?"  "Ah! my p=
oor Barbiche, I fear that=20

I have, as our American friends say, 'given you away.'"  "You don't mean to=
 say that the coward=20

has apologized? This was no case for an apology, De Kerguel, as you know." =
 "I wish it had been,"=20

said his friend; "unfortunately you are to fight."  Barbiche instantly thre=
w himself into a Napoleonic=20

attitude. Under such circumstances a Frenchman always feels himself a hero,=
 and invariably=20

unconsciously assumes the favourite pose of the Little Corporal.  "Yes, you=
 are to fight, my poor=20

friend, but with cavalry sabres."  Barbiche suddenly buried his face in his=
 hands, and exclaimed in=20

a broken voice, "Oh, my mother!"  When a Frenchman is in a very deep hole i=
ndeed, he always=20

apostrophizes his mother; on ordinary occasions he thinks little enough abo=
ut her.  "Kerguel," he=20

cried at length, looking up reproachfully at his friend, "you must have bee=
n mad. The sabre, as you=20

know, is only used among cavalry officers; the pistol or the small-sword ar=
e the arms of=20

gentlemen."  "And also of journalists, my friend. Of that the _ruse_ old ge=
neral, our man's friend,=20

was unfortunately too well aware. You had tied me down too tightly, my Barb=
iche; my instructions=20

were to obtain a meeting at any price. It was the  =E2=80=9CThe whole count=
ry is organized,=E2=80=9D said the head-

centre; =E2=80=9Cwe could put three hundred thousand men in the field at an=
y time in a fortnight. The=20

movement is not sectarian; it pervades all classes and all creeds. All that=
 we want are officers and=20

arms.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CHem!=E2=80=9D said the general; =E2=80=9Cand as to=
 your other supplies? Any scheme of commissariat?=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThere will be no lack of means,=E2=80=9D replied the head-centre. =
=E2=80=9CThere is no country where so much=20

money is hoarded as in Ireland. But, depend upon it, so far as the commissa=
riat is concerned, the=20

movement will be self-supporting.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, we shall see,=E2=
=80=9D said, the general; =E2=80=9CI am sorry it is an Irish=20

affair, though, to be sure, what else could it be? I am not fond of Irish a=
ffairs: whatever may be=20

said, and however plausible things may look, in an Irish business there is =
always a priest at the=20

bottom of it. I hate priests. By-the-by, I was stopped on my way here by a =
cardinal getting into his=20

carriage. I thought I had burnt all those vehicles when I was at Rome with =
Garibaldi in =E2=80=9848. A=20

cardinal in his carriage! I had no idea you permitted that sort of cattle i=
n London.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CLondon is a=20

roost for every bird,=E2=80=9D said Felix Drolin.  =E2=80=9CVery few of the=
 priests favor this movement,=E2=80=9D said=20

Desmond.  =E2=80=9CThen you have a great power against you,=E2=80=9D said t=
he general, =E2=80=9Cin addition to England.=E2=80=9D=20

=E2=80=9CThey are not exactly against; the bulk of them are too national fo=

with precipitation. An Irish business is a thing to be turned over several =
times.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CBut yet,=E2=80=9D said a=20

ourselves on the altar, and in vain! Greece is too small, and Roumania=E2=

ready to do any thing; but they would be the mere tools of Russia. Ireland =
alone remains, and she=20

is at our feet.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CThe peoples will never succeed until the=

could land as many rifles as you like, or any thing else. To have a fleet w=

They did so with effusion.  De Kerguel explained all the arrangements to hi=

drove to the nearest cavalry barrack, where they had acquaintances; and tha=

Monsieur Barbiche, received an hour's lesson in the use of the sabre from t=

But he found the weapon unwieldy, and he returned to his hotel a sadder man=
 than he left it.  Old=20

General Pepper ate his lunch with considerable relish. He was sick and tire=
d of Rome, its=20

churches, its ruins, and its priests. He longed, with an ardent longing, fo=
r that paradise of retired=20

military men, "the sweet shady side of Pall Mall;" he longed, too, for the =
whist tables at the=20

Pandemonium, and his so-called friends at that establishment. He felt that =
if he only got safely=20

across the frontier he would be one of the lions of the season; for he was =
certain that the business=20

he was bent upon that afternoon would be no child's play. He himself was no=
 particular friend of=20

Haggard's; but he was proud of having done his best for his man. "After all=
," said he to himself,=20

"it's six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other. It's lucky for is the land=
