Bordeaux,=E2=80=94thence to the country of Foix, to the kingdoms of Navarre=
 and Castille, to the shrine of=20

my lord St James at Compostella. On my return, if it please God, I will pas=

to perform my vow, excepting the kingdom of France and county of Hainault. =
 =E2=80=98That this proposal=20

may have the fullest assurance, I have put my seal to this letter, and sign=

in the year of the incarnation seven inches in depth by three and one-half =
inches in thickness.  The=20

gall bladder is first examined to determine the character and amount of the=
 bile and the presence=20

or absence of gall stones, inflammatory lesions, and tumors.  At autopsies =
the surface of the liver,=20

especially along the free border, is generally seen to be of a greenish or =
dark-brown color. This=20

discoloration is due to the action of the gases developed by decomposition =
on the coloring matter=20

of the blood, and has no pathological significance. The character of the su=
rface of the liver is now=20

noted, whether smooth or rough. The organ is opened by deep incisions in va=
rious directions, and=20

the color, consistency, and blood supply of the liver tissue carefully reco=

appointed day. In a few days, he set out on his pilgrimage to the shrine of=

CHAP. IX.      THE DUKE OF ORLEANS, BROTHER TO THE KING OF FRANCE, SENDS A=
=20

CHALLENGE TO THE KING OF ENGLAND.=E2=80=94THE ANSWER HE         RECEIVES.  =
 In the year=20

1402, Louis duke of Orleans, brother to the king of France, sent a letter t=
o the king of England,=20

proposing a combat between them, of the following tenor:  =E2=80=98I Louis,=
 by the grace of God, son and=20

brother to the kings of France, duke of Orleans, write and make known to yo=
u, that with the aid of=20

God and the blessed Trinity, in the desire which I have to gain renown, and=
 which you in like=20

manner should feel, considering idleness as the bane of lords of high birth=
 who do not employ=20

themselves in arms, and thinking I can no way better seek renown than by pr=
oposing to you to=20

meet me at an appointed place, each of us accompanied with one hundred knig=
hts and esquires,=20

of name and arms without reproach, there to combat together until one of th=
e parties shall=20

surrender; and he to whom God shall grant the victory shall do with his pri=
soners as it may please=20

him. We will not employ any incantations that are forbidden by the church, =
not be overlooked. It=20

should be remembered that, of all the poisons, phosphorus alone leaves char=
acteristic=20

appearances in the liver.  =3DThe Pancreas.=3D=E2=80=94The pancreas is now =
easily removed, and its size=20

and weight recorded. Normally it should weigh three ounces and measure eigh=
t inches in length=20

by one and one-half inches in breadth by one inch in thickness. The organ s=
hould be opened by a=20

longitudinal cut and examined for evidences of acute or chronic inflammatio=
n, fat-necrosis, tumors,=20

calculi, and amyloid degeneration.  =3DGenito-Urinary Organs.=3D=E2=80=94It=
 is very important in medico-legal=20

cases that all the urine should be preserved and obtained uncontaminated; t=
herefore before the=20

bladder is opened a catheter should be introduced and the urine drawn off i=
nto a clean bottle=20

which has previously been rinsed with distilled water. If more convenient t=
he bladder itself can be=20

punctured at its upper portion, a pipette introduced, and the urine drawn o=
ff in this manner.  The=20

genito-urinary organs are removed together. This is done in the following m=
anner. The body of the=20

penis is pushed backward within the skin and cut off just behind the glans =
penis; the remaining=20

portion of the rectum is raised. This with the prostate gland, bladder, and=
 penis attached is=20

removed by carrying the knife around the pelvis close to the bone and separ=
ating the pubic=20

attachments. The organs are then laid on a clean board and the urethra is o=
pened on a grooved=20

director passed into the bladder, and the incision prolonged so that the in=
ternal surface of the=20

bladder itself will be completely exposed. Examine the=20


_
having armour as may be most agreeable to every one for the security of his=
 person, and with the=20

usual arms; that is to say, lance, battle-axe, sword and dagger, and each t=
o employ them as he=20

shall think most to his advantage, without aiding himself by any bodkins, h=
ooks, bearded darts,=20

poisoned needles or razors, as may be done by persons unless they be positi=
vely ordered to the=20

contrary.  =E2=80=98To accomplish this enterprise, I make known to you, tha=
t if GOD permit, and under the=20

good pleasure of our Lady and my lord St Michael, I propose (after knowing =
your intentions) to be=20

at my town of Angoul=C3=AAme, accompanied by the aforesaid number of knight=
s and esquires. Now, if=20

your courage be such as I think it is, for the fulfilment of this deed of a=
rms, you may come to=20

Bordeaux, when we may depute the _bladder_ for congestion, hemorrhages, inf=
lammation, and=20

ulcers of its mucous surface, and note the thickness of its walls. Open the=
 _rectum_ and examine=20

for ulcers, strictures, tumors, and the evidence of hemorrhage. The _prosta=
te_ gland is opened by=20

a number of incisions into its substance. Examine for hypertrophies, tumors=
, and inflammatory=20

lesions. Force the _testicles_ through the inguinal canal, and cut them off=
. Weigh, open, and=20

examine them for evidence of inflammation, tuberculosis, and tumors.  =3DFe=
male=20

Organs.=3D=E2=80=94Before removing these organs, any abnormalities such as =
adhesions, malpositions,=20

and tumors should be noted. Dissect the organs away from the pelvic bones b=
y carrying the point=20

of the knife around the pelvis close to the bone. Cut through the vagina at=
 its lower third, and=20


_
persons to fix on a spot for the combat, giving to them full power to act t=
herein as if we ourselves=20

were personally present.  =E2=80=98Most potent and noble prince, let me kno=
w your will in regard to this=20

proposal, and have the goodness to send me as speedy an answer as may be; f=
or in all affairs of=20

arms, the shortest determination is the best, readily be removed. Examine t=
he _vulva_ for ulcers,=20

hypertrophies, and tumors. Open and examine the _bladder_. Open the _vagina=
_ along its=20

anterior border and carefully examine its mucous surface for evidences of i=
nflammation.  THE=20

UTERUS.=E2=80=94Before opening the uterus, its size and shape should be rec=
orded. The average=20

normal weight of the organ is=20
