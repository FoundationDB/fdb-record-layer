philodendron monstera   IDEAL FOR YACHTING AND CRUISING.  One can pass the =
entire summer on Puget Sound without seeing a bit of rough weather. The lar=
gest ocean liners ride here safe from the storms that pound sometimes again=
st the outer coast line; for its waters compose one great harbor, protected=
 by the forests and mountains. One may see "Uncle Sam's" powerful fighting =
machines almost any day steaming toward Bremerton, one of the U. have felt =
like this before. He wondered miserably what could be the reason why he fel=
t so torpid and shivery, disinclined to move, and yet so uncomfortable when=
 he sat still.  After his bath, on that first night in London, tucked into =
a little bed with a nice warm eiderdown over him, he still felt that horrid=
 little trickle of ice-cold water down his spine and could not sleep.  His =
cot was in Auntie Jan's room with philodendron monstera   IDEAL FOR YACHTIN=
