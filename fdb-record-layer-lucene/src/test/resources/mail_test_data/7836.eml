in the second grade are clothed in a black and grey check suit and cap. The=

write one letter a fortnight, to draw a ration of tobacco weekly and to see=
 visitors once a month.=20

They also have a dining room of their own, but the food served therein is n=
ot as varied as that=20

served to first grade men. The latter, for example, are served with butter =

the cellhouse. In none of=20

o' they all feed on the=20

same Pasture, even so that the Milk of one Cow will cover or enrich the But=
ter made from nine or=20

ten other Cows; her Milk will make Butter of a rich yellow Colour, full of =
Fatness, and the others=20

will only produce a pale, lean Butter, but all together will be good: I kno=
w several Instances of this,=20

and every one who is skilful in a Dairy may observe it. I have already trea=
ted largely concerning=20

this Particular, in my Works of Husbandry, and I shall therefore proceed to=
 speak of the=20

Management of Milk in the Dairy for making Butter; for I am very sensible, =
that many Farmers=20

might have twice the Benefit from their Dairies, if the Articles of Butter =
and Cheese were=20

consider'd in a rational way, and the old Custom could be broke through; an=
d moreover, if the best=20

Rules for managing of the Dairy were known, and put in practice, the whole =
Country would be the=20

better for it, every one might enjoy the benefit of good things: whereas fo=
r want of knowledge=20

among some Farmers, their Goods are of small value, and the People are also=
 disatisfied.  In=20

many parts of _England_, it is common to set Milk in Brass Pans, and that g=
ives an ill Taste to=20


_
excepting those in the third grade, all are permitted to wear their hair lo=
ng enough to comb during=20

good behavior. The prisoner, after his bath, is again brought into the cell=
house and the captain has=20

one of the inmate barbers clip his hair and shave him. If the new arrival b=
elongs to the respectable=20

class, wearing a mustache and dressed well he will hardly recognize himself=
 if he should chance=20

to look into a mirror. In a few moments the proud American citizen has been=
 supplanted by the=20

convict. Those who belong to the so-called "criminal" class are not affecte=
d upon donning the=20

prison uniform, but it is different with the first offender. If he is a pro=
ud, sensitive man the change is=20

great enough to almost wrench his heart strings asunder. Many a new arrival=
, spending his first=20

night in his cell, with its iron bed, whitewashed walls, scant furnishings,=
 iron floor and the=20

dimensions of the room only five by seven feet, has been known to break dow=
n completely. After=20

such an ordeal (not your make-believe imprisonment, where some author has h=
imself locked up=20

for an hour or so to gain local coloring for a novel) one gets a clear idea=
 of what prison life really is=20

and places a higher valuation on the liberty that he so recklessly trampled=
 under foot in his mad=20

rush for riches, position and fame.  After the tonsorial artist has complet=
ed his task the prisoner is=20

conducted to the deputy warden's office, where he is weighed, asked innumer=
able questions, etc.,=20

instructed as to the rules of the institution, measured according to the Be=
rtillon system, which is=20

the standard adopted in this country and throughout Europe.                =
               BERTILLON=20

MEASUREMENTS   To Dr. Alphonse Bertillon, the celebrated French anthropolog=
ist, the world is=20

indebted for the knowledge of the scientifically demonstrated fact that no =
two persons are exactly=20

alike in physical measurements. In fact any single individual can be identi=
fied from thousands of=20

others by this cleverly thought-out system, which was first adopted in this=
 country in 1887. The=20

accompanying illustrations are self-explanatory.  The system embraces three=
 distinct parts: First,=20

the measurement of certain unchangeable "bony lengths" of the body; second,=
 a careful=20

description of the features of the face; third, a careful localization of a=
ll scars and marks on the=20

body. While the face may change, be even mutilated beyond recognition; whil=
e the scars and=20

other marks may be removed, the "bony lengths" of the body remain unchangea=
ble in adults. The=20

parts measured of the bony lengths of the body are the length and width of =
the head, the cheek=20

width, length of foot, the middle and little finger and the cubit, i. e., f=
rom the elbow to the tip of the=20

little finger; the height standing, the height seated, the reach of outstre=
tched arms, right ear length=20

(which most authorities assert remains the same through life), the median l=
ine in front from the fork=20

or hollow below the "Adam's apple" down, and, in the rear, the spinal colum=
n from the seventh=20

vertebra to the base of the spine, are the anatomical or "guiding points" f=
rom which all descriptions=20

of the body are recorded; in the fingers, the joints and flanges,--the flan=
ges being the portions of=20

the fingers between the joints. The calipers for measuring the head are pro=
vided with a graduated=20

arch and are similar to a compass. In taking the length of the head the lef=
t point of the caliper is=20

held at the root of the nose and the right point is brought against the occ=
ipital bone in the back of=20

the head; the thumb screw is then tightened and the measurement checked by =
passing the=20

instrument again over the head. The width of the head over the cheeks is ta=
ken in the same way.=20

The measurement of the foot is taken with a caliper rule similar to that us=
ed by a shoemaker; the=20

prisoner is posed standing on his left foot and steadying himself as shown =
in the illustration. The=20

graduate stem is placed against the inside of the foot with the fixed arm i=
n contact with the heel=20

and the sliding arm then brought in tightly against the toe. setting the Cr=
eam in Brass-Kettles over=20



the Fire, and as it warms to stroak the Butter as it rises to the edge of t=
he Kettle: this way is very=20

bad for Butter, for the warm Brass assuredly will spoil the Taste of the Cr=
eam, and it is often=20

smoak'd. The surest way is to set the Milk in glaz'd Earthen Pans or in Lea=
den Pans, but the=20

Earthen Pans are preferable. It should be particularly observ'd, that the D=
airy be kept cool, for that=20

in hot Weather contributes greatly to the Advantage of the Butter: I have k=
nown some that have=20

had Streams of Water running thro' them, and at the same Places, instead of=
 Glass Windows,=20

there have been no Lights at all to them but thro' Wyer, and Shutters to th=
em, to open or close as=20

the Sun chang'd its Course. The thatching of the Dairy is much cooler also =
than Tyling; and=20

whatever will contribute to keep off the Sun, should be practis'd. There ar=
e yet in some Places in=20

_England_ some Farmers that do not know the use of the Churn; however, it i=
s certain, that there=20

is no better way of making Butter than by that means, or something equivale=
nt to it; that is, by=20

beating the Cream, so that the Oily, or Fat Parts separate from the Watery =
Parts, in the most=20

constant and gentle way that is possible, for to use this beating of the Cr=
eam too violently, will=20

make the Butter like Grease; whereas a gentle beating of the Cream will ren=
der it more firm or stiff:=20

and besides, when the Cream is beat with too much hurry, the Butter will fe=
rment, and presently=20

change to be of a bad Taste; but if it be gently beat or churn'd, it will b=
e firm, and will be fit for=20

keeping. Again, it must be observ'd, that as the beating or churning of Cre=
am, to bring it to Butter,=20

is only to separate the oily from the watery Parts of the Cream, so when on=
ce you begin to churn,=20

or beat the Cream, you must continue to churn or beat it in the most consta=
nt manner you can, till=20

the Butter is made: for if you had perhaps beat the Cream within three or f=
our Minutes of its=20

becoming Butter, if you leave off the Work but a Minute, the oily and water=
y Parts will return to one=20

another, and will require as much Labour as before to separate them: it is =
like Oil and Vinegar that=20

have been mix'd by Labour, and then let alone for a Minute or two, they wil=
l divide and separate=20

from one another, as much as if they had never been mix'd; but the beating =
of it too violently, will=20

make the Butter oily, as observ'd before. As for the Figure of our common C=
hurn, I shall not give a=20

draught of it, because such as are unacquainted with it may understand it m=
uch better by seeing a=20

Model of it, which may be had at any Toy-Shop in _London_; nay, the very be=
ating of Cream with=20

a Spoon, in a small Bowl, will bring it to Butter; but it must be beat regu=
larly.  In the great Dairies in=20

_Holland_, where one Farmer keeps four or five hundred Cows, the Cream is p=
ut into a large Well,=20

lined with Lead, and a large Beam set with cross Bars is turn'd in the Crea=
m by a Horse; but the=20

violence of the Motion makes the Butter rather like Oil than Butter; and th=
e consequence is, that it=20

will not keep long, and as I have heard say, will not melt well, like the B=
utter that is made by more=20

gentle means. Where a gentle way is used in making Butter, it will cut like=
 Wax, and it should=20

especially be well wrought with the Hands, when it is fresh, taken from the=
 Churn and salted for=20

common use; for if the Milk be not well work'd out of it, the Butter will n=
ot keep. However, if Butter=20

begins to decay in goodness, or change to an ill Taste, let it be work'd we=
ll, and wash'd with=20

Water, and it will come to itself, and will bear salting and potting as wel=
l as fresh Butter; but always=20

observe not to put up Butters of several sorts into the same Pot or Vessel,=
 but chuse that of the=20

same Dairy, and of the same making, if possible. One of the most curious Wo=
men I have met with=20

in this way, is Mrs. _Cowen,_ a Shopkeeper at _Newport Pond_ in _Essex,_ wh=
o pots great=20

quantities every Year; there are undoubtedly many others who are very good =
in this way, but as I=20

do not know them,=20


_
of the caliper rule is used, two small projections being provided on the fi=
xed and sliding arms. The=20

finger is bent at right angles to the back of the hand and the measurement =
taken from the tip of the=20

finger to the knuckle.                         [Head Length Measurements.] =
                         Head Length=20

Measurements.   The registering and record made of the foregoing, together =
with an accurate=20

description of the face and all marks on the body, constitute the third and=
 complete part of this=20

system. To illustrate this part briefly,-- measurements are all based on th=
e French metric system,=20

viz: Height, 1 metre, 71 centimetres, 3 millimitres; width, 14 therefore I =
may be excus'd if I mention=20

her in particular.  Again, Butter that was good originally, and well potted=
, may be wash'd and=20

beaten in the Winter, so as to be made more sweet and palatable than fresh =
Butter, made in many=20

Places, at that time of the Year; and this is frequently practiced about _L=
ondon,_ where the=20

workers of it get more than twice the first Price of the Butter, by their C=
are and Labour.  Before I=20

conclude this Article, it may be necessary to observe, that the best manage=
rs of the Dairy=20

frequently fill up their Churns with cold Water, before they put in the Cre=
am to churn, in the heat of=20

the Summer, for fear of over-heating the Butter=20
