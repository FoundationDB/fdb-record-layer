never felt the full force of his cruelties, she often felt sorry for the ot=
her slaves who were given a=20

task too heavy to be completed in the given time; this deliberately, so tha=
t the master might have=20

some excuse to vent his pentup feelings. Punishment was always in the form =
of a severe whipping=20

or revocation of a slave's privilege, such as visiting other plantations et=
c.  The Lowes were not=20

wealthy and it was necessary for them to raise and manufacture as many thin=
gs on the plantation=20

as possible. Slaves toiled from early morning until night in the corn, cott=
on sugar cane and tobacco=20

fields. Others tended the large herds of cattle from which milk, butter, me=
at and leather was=20

produced. The leather was tanned and made into crude shoes for the slaves f=
or the short winter=20

months. No one wore shoes except during cold weather and on Sundays. Fruit =
orchards and=20

vegetables were also grown, but not given as much attention as the cotton a=
nd corn, as these=20

were the main money crops.  As a child Rebecca learned to ape the ways of h=
er mistress. At first=20

this was considered very amusing. Whenever she had not knitted her required=
 number of socks=20

during the week, she simply informed them that she had not done it because =
she had not wanted=20

to--besides she was not a "nigger." This stubbornness accompanied by hyster=
ical tantrums=20

continued to cause Rebecca to receive many stiff punishments that might hav=
e been avoided. Her=20

master had given orders that no one was ever to whip her, so devious method=
s were employed to=20

punish her, such as marching her down the road with hands tied behind her b=
ack, or locking her in=20

a dark room for several hours with only bread and water.  Rebecca resembled=
 very much a=20

daughter of William Lowe. The girl was really her aunt, and very conscious =
of the resemblance.=20

Both had brown eyes and long dark hair. They were about the same height and=
 the clothes of the=20

young mistress fitted Rebecca "like a glove." To offset this likeness, Rebe=
cca's hair was always=20

cut very short. Finally Rebecca rebelled at having her hair all cut off and=
 blankly refused to submit=20

to the treatment any longer. After this happening, the girls formed a disli=
ke for each other, and=20

Rebecca was guilty of doing every mean act of which she was capable to torm=
ent the white girl.=20

Rebecca's mother aided and abetted her in this, often telling her things to=
 do. Rebecca did not fear=20

the form of punishment administered her and she had the cunning to keep "on=
 the good side of the=20

master" who had a fondness for her "because she was so much like the Lowes.=
" The mistress'=20

demand that she be sold or beaten was always turned aside with "Dear, you k=
now the child can't=20

help it; its that cursed Cherokee blood in her."  There seemed to be no ver=
y strong opposition to a=20

slave's learning to read and write on the plantation, so Rebecca learned al=
ong with the white=20

children. Her father purchased books for her with money he was allowed to e=
arn seeming hardly to=20

have any historical surroundings, but to shine like a planet suspended by i=
tself in the sky. So it is=20

with that female Shakespeare in miniature, Miss Austen. But Scott took the =
most intense interest=20

in the political struggles of his time. He was a fiery partisan, a Tory in =
arms against the French=20

Revolution. In his account of the coronation of George IV. a passionate wor=
ship of monarchy=20

breaks forth, which, if we did not know his noble nature, we might call sla=
vish. He sacrificed, ease,=20

and at last life, to his seignorial aspirations. On one occasion he was eve=
n carried beyond the=20

bounds of propriety by his opposition to the Whig chief. The Cavalier was h=
is political ancestor, the=20

Covenanter the ancestor of his political enemy. The idols which the Covenan=
ting iconoclast broke=20

were his. He would have fought against the first revolution under Montrose,=
 and against the=20

second under Dundee. Yet he is perfectly, serenely just to the opposite par=
ty. Not only is he just,=20

he is sympathetic. He brings out their worth, their valour, such grandeur o=
f character as they have,=20



with all the power of his art, making no distinction in this respect betwee=
n friend and foe. If they=20

have a ridiculous side he uses it for the purposes of his art, but genially=
, playfully, without malice. If=20

there was a laugh left in the Covenanters, they would have laughed at their=
 own portraits as=20

painted by Scott. He shows no hatred of anything but wickedness itself. Suc=
h a novelist is a most=20

effective preacher of liberality and charity; he brings our hearts nearer t=
o the Impartial Father of us=20

all.  IV. _The Lamp of Impersonality_.--Personality is lower than partialit=
y. Dante himself is open to=20

the suspicion of partiality: it is said, not without apparent ground, that =
he puts into hell all the=20

enemies of the political cause, which, in his eyes, was that of Italy and G=
od. A legend tells that=20

Leonardo da Vinci was warned that his divine picture of the Last Supper wou=
ld fade, because he=20

had introduced his personal enemy as Judas, and thus desecrated art by maki=
ng it serve personal=20

hatred. The legend must be false, Leonardo had too grand a soul. A wretched=
 woman in England,=20

at the beginning of the last century, Mrs. Manley, systematically employed =
fiction as a cover for=20

personal libel; but such an abuse of art as this could be practiced or coun=
tenanced only by the=20

vile. Novelists, however, often debase fiction by obtruding their personal =
vanities, favouritisms,=20

fanaticisms and antipathies. We had, the other day, a novel, the author of =
which introduced=20

himself almost by name as a heroic character, with a description of his own=
 personal appearance,=20

residence, and habits as fond fancy painted them to himself. There is a nov=
elist, who is a man of=20

fashion, and who makes the age of the heroes in his successive novels advan=
ce with his own, so=20

that at last we shall have irresistible fascination at seven score years an=
d ten. But=20


_
work done on some other plantation during his time off. He was not permitte=
d to buy his freedom,=20

however.  On Sundays Rebecca attended church along with the other slaves. S=
ervices were held=20

in the white churches after their services were over. They were taught to o=
bey their masters and=20

work hard, and that they should be very thankful for the institution of sla=
very which brought them=20

from darkest Africa.  On the plantation, the doctor was not nearly as popul=
ar as the "granny" or=20

midwife, who brewed medicines for every ailment. Each plantation had its ow=
n "granny" who also=20

served the mistress during confinement. Some of her remedies follows:  For =
colds: Horehound tea,=20

pinetop tea, lightwood drippings on sugar. For fever: A tea made of pomegra=
nate seeds and=20

crushed mint. For whooping cough: A tea made of sheep shandy (manure); catn=
ip tea. For=20

spasms: garlic; burning a garment next to the skin of the patient having th=
e fit.  Shortly before the=20

war, Rebecca was married to Solomon, her husband. This ceremony consisted o=
f simply jumping=20

over a broom and having some one read a few words from a book, which may or=
 may not have=20

been the Bible. After the war, many couples were remarried because of this =
irregularity.  Rebecca=20

had learned of the war long before it ended and knew its import. She had co=
nfided this information=20

to other slaves who could read and write. She read the mischievous way in w=
hich personality=20

breaks out is pamphleteering under the guise of fiction. One novel is a pam=
phlet against lunatic=20

asylums, another against model prisons, a third against the poor law, a fou=
rth against the=20

government offices, a fifth against trade unions. In these pretended works =
of imagination facts are=20

joined in support of a crotchet or an antipathy with all the license of fic=
tion; calumny revels without=20

restraint, and no cause is served but that of falsehood and injustice. A wr=
iter takes offence at the=20

excessive popularity of athletic sports; instead of bringing out an accurat=
e and conscientious=20

treatise to advocate moderation, he lets fly a novel painting the typical b=
oating man as a seducer=20

of confiding women, the betrayer of his friend, and the murderer of his wif=
e. Religious zealots are=20

very apt to take this method of enlisting imagination, as they think, on th=
e side of truth. We had=20

once a high Anglican novel in which the Papist was eaten alive by rats, and=
 the Rationalist and=20

Republican was slowly seethed in molten lead, the fate of each being, of co=
urse, a just judgment=20

of heaven on those who presumed to differ from the author. Thus the voice o=
f morality is=20

confounded with that of tyrannical petulance and self-love. Not only is Sco=
tt not personal, but we=20

cannot conceive his being so. We cannot think it possible that he should de=
grade=20
