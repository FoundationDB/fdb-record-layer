These relic-hunters, commonly of genteel appearance, were in force at Johns=

Spanish government to send more Spanish friars to the islands as parish pri=
ests. The political=20

disturbances in Spain at this time are reflected in Filipinas, and a strong=
 Carlist faction oppose=20

Governor Camba (who assumes that office in August, 1837), and finally procu=
re his recall to=20

Spain, little more than a year afterward. Under his successor, Lardizbal, t=
he status of the Chinese=20

in the islands is determined, provision is made for the official censorship=
 of books brought to=20

Filipinas, a school of commerce is established at Manila and various import=
ant changes are made=20

in financial and municipal administration. In February, 1841, Lardizbal is =
succeeded by Marcelino=20

de Ora.  In 1828 was published at Calcutta an interesting book entitled, Re=
marks on the Phillippine=20

Islands, 1819 to 1822, "by an Englishman"--as he states therein, a naval of=
ficer; this is here=20

presented, with additional annotations from various sources. It throws much=
 light on conditions in=20

Manila at that time, and is of especial value as coming from an enlightened=
 foreigner, rather than a=20

Spaniard. He praises the natural resources and advantages of the islands, a=
nd makes various=20

comments on their climate (which "is remarkably temperate and salubrious"),=
 diseases, and=20

population; he then classifies this last, describing in succession the vari=
ous races, white, colored,=20

and mixed, who inhabit the islands. He defends the natives from accusations=
 which have been=20

made against them, and considers their defects as the natural result of the=
 oppression and=20

injustice which they have suffered, and the general insecurity of property =
in the islands. Robbery=20

and piracy prevail there, outside of the new Spanish towns; and even in Man=
ila there are=20

numerous acts of pillage committed by the lawless soldiery. Justice is negl=
ected or corrupted; and=20

the Church exacts so many holidays, pilgrimages, etc., that the natives are=
 obliged to neglect=20

=E2=80=9Cwhere the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.=
=E2=80=9D Residents guarding silverware=20

and other valuables were, in some instances, overpowered in broad daylight =
and their goods taken=20

away from before their eyes. These crimes were diligently laid at the door =
of the Hungarians, but=20

better knowledge acquitted them of the charge and proved that they were not=
 more guilty than=20

others.  The American, accustomed by republican training to regard himself =
as the chief source of=20

law, is never slow to take things into his own hands in cases of extremity.=
 We are told that a few of=20

these ghouls were summarily dealt with; and under the circumstances the mos=
t conservative find it=20

hard to condemn the grief-crazed men. One correspondent asked Deputy Sherif=
f =E2=80=9CChall=E2=80=9D Dick if the=20

reports of summary execution were true. Chall replied slowly:  =E2=80=9CThe=
re are some men whom their=20

friends will never again see alive.=E2=80=9D  =E2=80=9CWell, now, how many =
did you shoot?=E2=80=9D was the next question.=20

=E2=80=9CSay,=E2=80=9D said Chall. =E2=80=9COn Saturday morning I was the f=
irst to make my way to Sang Hollow, to see if I=20

could not get some food for people made homeless by the flood. There was a =
car-load of=20

provisions there, but the vandals were on hand. They broke into the car, an=
d in spite of my=20

protestations carried off box after box of supplies. I only got half a wago=
n load. They were too=20

many for me. I know when I have no show. There was no show there, and I got=
 out.  =E2=80=9CAs I was=20

leaving Sang Hollow and got up the mountain road a piece, I saw two Hungari=
ans and one woman=20

engaged in cutting the fingers off of corpses to get some rings. Well, I go=
t off that team and--well,=20

there are three people who were not drowned and who are not alive.=E2=80=9D=
  =E2=80=9CWhere are the bodies?=E2=80=9D=20

ber appeared in the relic-hunter. He is a=20

phenomenon inexplicable--at least to the writer of these pages. Why men sho=

they also are burdened by many church taxes and impositions. Our writer pro=
ceeds to describe=20

the government of the islands, general, municipal, and provincial, and the =
abuses prevalent in the=20

last-named; then the ecclesiastical administration, the character of the cl=
ergy, and their influence=20

over the natives. The sources of the colonial revenue are enumerated, with =
the chief branches of=20

expense, the main part of this being for the coffin, or from the granite sa=
rcophagus in the great=20

pyramid, and carry them home and put them in a cabinet, and call people to =
admire them, without=20

thereby simply advertising themselves as vandals, passes comprehension. Why=
 a chip from=20

Johnstown should be better than the same kind of a chip from any other plac=
